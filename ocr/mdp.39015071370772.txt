ION PROPULSION

October, 1960



The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers is con-
structing this operational intercontinental
missile base in Wyoming. In front of the
partially completed Launch and Service Build-
ings are Col. Sidney T. Martin, in charge of
construction, and Maurice K. Graber, a con-
struction engineer for the Corps.

This Is the inside of the blast pit of one of the
launcher buildings. In all six of these build-
ings there are 1,040 tons of structural steel,
1,950 tons of reinforcing steel, over 48,000 tons
of concrete aggregate, blocks and cement,
and 8,040 tons of mechanical steel items.

Fuel lines and process piping are Stainless
Steel and operate at pressures up to 15,000
psi. The pipes are kept almost surgically clean
to prevent contamination of fuel and subse-
quent malfunction. Vapor degreasing and
chemical cleaning processes are used on
the pipes.

LdrdmiB, on one of Wyoming's
plains, you'll find the strangest
government housing project ever
built. Six concrete and steel build-
ings are being constructed to house
Atlas missiles. The site is one of the
operational intercontinental missile
bases to be operated by the Strate-
gic Air Command. This base is being
constructed on the surface. Others
will burrow deep into the earth.
Generally, the missiles are all
you ever hear or read about. Ac-
tually, they're only a small part of
the missile program. Most of the
manpower and material go into
ground support equipment. There
are over 11,000 tons of steel and
over 48,000 tons of concrete aggre-
gate, blocks and cement in the six
launching service buildings at this
site alone.
United States Steel can supply
virtually all of the material for a
missile program — carbon steels,
high-strength low-alloy steels, ultra-
high-strength alloy steels, Stain-
less Steel, steel fence, electrical
cable, cement and wire rope.
The success of our whole missile
program depends upon these ma-
terials. And upon manpower. Here's
where you fit in: it takes trained en-
gineers and men of many other pro-
fessions, such as those interested
in financial analysis or sales to
research, develop and produce
these steels. If you would like to

On the riddle of
rolling friction
General Motors is pioneering research into the mystery of energy losses in the rolling ball. "With a unique
measuring device (above), investigators have not only confirmed the hypothesis of how a rolling ball loses
energy (Answer: elastic hysteresis), but have also learned -where this lost energy is dissipated (Answer:
in the interior of the material, not on the surface).
The effectiveness of automation depends upon the ingenuity of the scientist and engineer. If
you are about to begin a career in the field of technology you'll benefit yourself by working
where ingenuity and enthusiasm pay off. At General Motors they do, and in a big way.
What is your main interest? GM's diversification covers many fields. Automotive research,
production engineering and manufacturing, electronics and astronautics are just a few. With
so many and varied divisions, GM can offer men -who qualify the choice of specialization or
the opportunity to work on vastly different projects.
If you are an undergraduate, or if you are working on a postgraduate degree, GM has a
financial aid program that you should look into. For complete information, write to General
Motors, Personnel Staff, Detroit 2, Michigan.

10,000 traffic signals controlled by a computer.
Imagine a computer that could solve the downtown
traffic problem. This is the long-range potential of a
new kind of computer invented by Westinghouse, one
that "learns" by experience, and adapts instantly to
changing problems. One pilot model has been running
a refinery process. Tomorrow this new-concept com-
puter will improve the making of cement, paper, and
almost anything else made by a continuous process.
Compared to standard computers, it will be smaller,
cheaper, more reliable.
Interest in tomorrow is one reason Westinghouse
is the best place for talented engineers. For more rea-

"Tlte £ditot'&amp; Pen —
Here at the start of another school year it seems fitting to
devote a portion of this space to a discussion of what the
late Dean George Granger Brown described as "a highly
successful and respected tradition"—the Honor System in
the College of Engineering. We do this not in the form of
an admonition or an appeal but as a basis for enlightenment
of new students and a basis for reflective thinking by old
students.
Our feeling towards the Honor System is aptly expressed
by a statement in the booklet given to all incoming students:
"It has become a fine tradition of the students of the Engi-
neering College . . . How much this tradition means to you,
you will not appreciate till you have been here for a time."
It doesn't take too much effort to recall our freshman
days several years back and the fact that the Honor System
meant little at the time. Among our classmates there seemed
to be a general attitude of doubt and cynicism towards the
Honor Code and its value. Quite possibly this is the early
attitude of most freshman classes.
After we had "been here for a time" however, this atti-
tude began to change, slowly and unnoticeably, but moving
toward a new viewpoint. For most of us a day came—maybe
it was the first time we had a class in Lit school or during
that first tense final exam when we discovered we were free
to leave the room and wander in the halls till we had re-
laxed—when we suddenly did appreciate the value of the
Honor System to ourselves and to the profession of engi-
neering. It is our conviction that students, whether they be
new or old, eventually come to feel this way towards the
Honor System, just as students in the College of Engineering
have felt since the system was founded in 1916.
We hope that the day when all the Colleges in the Uni-
versity will adopt a similar system is not far hence because
we cannot express strongly enough the value of the Honor
System in the development of character and in the exercising
of a responsibility by the student to himself and his fellow
engineers.
Another subject of interest to most students, especially
seniors, is the engineering placement picture. In a later issue
the Technic will deal more fully with this subject but a few
highlights from the 1959-60 College of Engineering Place-
ment Report should be of interest.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


both salaries and recruiting activity reflected a substantial
increase in the demand for engineers, according to Prof. J.
G. Young of the Placement Office. However, this didn't lead
to a complacent attitude on the part of the students because
their efforts to find a job appeared to increase as well.
These trends lead us to the fact that Mr. Average Student
interviewed 10 companies, received 5 offers that averaged
$537/month, and accepted an offer at about $524/month.
Prof. Young reports two other interesting trends, one
being the slowing down of a flight to the West Coast in
favor of the Mid-West. This is probably due to the general
slowdown in the aircraft industry. More important was the
fact that the number of students accepting employment with
medium sized firms (500-5000 employees) jumped from
18% to 34% while those going with large firms (over 5000
employees) dropped from 72% to 55%.
Although the Placement Office offers no predictions for
this coming year it seems quite likely that the upward trend
that has existed for several years will continue as long as the
economy as a whole remains steady.
As a rebuttal of the oft-repeated charge that engineers
are good for only running a slide-lrule, I urge you to read
the winning Tau Beta Pi pledge essay entitled "On Intel-
lectual Duality" which appears on page 32. Not only is it a
fine piece of writing and evidence of sound thinking but the
challenge it presents warrants our utmost consideration.
Another short essay which appears on the last page of
this issue is an interesting footnote to history. Originally
appearing in the January, 1933 Technic, it is amazing how
apropos this essay is to the present situation.
After having the opportunity to work in industry for a
summer it is our conclusion that on the job experience is im-
measureably beneficial to the educational process. It would
be our suggestion, although probably an impractical one to
implement, that all students be required to gain some prac-
tical industrial experience in industry during the summer
between their junior and senior years.

UPGRADING
ENERGY
-OUR MOST IMPORTANT JOB
FOR EIGHTY YEARS, America's electric power industry has been advancing the science of upgrading
energy resources into the most usable, flexible and economical of all the forms of energy—electricity. The
progress of our abundant industrial society has depended very largely on the refinement of "crude" energy
—either in the form of heat from fossil fuels like coal, or in the form of falling water—into infinitely
versatile electric power. [_J Today the development of atomic electric power offers another means for even
more efficient upgrading of our energy sources. In the near future this new development may lead to large
scale direct conversion machines—enabling us to produce electricity directly from heat without steam
generators and turbines. [ ] At Detroit Edison, research and development of new power sources through
fission, fuel cells, thermoelectric and thermionic generation is being continuously appraised. Applications of
this research for energy upgrading offer a challenge to young engineers coming into the electric power industry.

research. "Find the truth of a matter first, then adapt that
truth to the industrial needs of the day." This is the attitude
of the research staff of The Dow Chemical Company. In
new and expanded facilities across the United States, in
Canada, and overseas, Dow research continues to embody
this philosophy on which the company was built. It is note-
worthy in the history of Dow that parallel to the steady
growth of the company has been a steady increase in the
number of research personnel. With this attitude toward
research, Dow will continue to find and invent new and better

resources. When someone told Herbert H. Dow that there
wasn't enough bromine available in the earth, he made his
now famous statement, "We'll have to mine it out of the
ocean, then." This is characteristic of the Dow attitude
toward resources. It is true that the chief raw materials for
virtually all the Dow products are sea water, brine, petro-
leum, coal, and oyster shells. It is also true that the Dow
attitude toward resources has led to an extremely broad and
beneficial exploitation of these common materials. Dow
thoroughness in the handling of all resources has led to the
industry axiom, "If it's Dow, it's backed by complete
technology."

Dow employs, a complete exploration of these materials will
take you into medicine and biochemistry, agriculture, metal-
lurgy, dyestuffs, solvents, plastics, and just about every other
field as well. And Dow gets results. Many of these bear
well-known names like saran and Saran Wrap*, Dowgard*,
Styrofoam®, Lurex®, and hundreds of others. And the end
is not in sight. Each new product suggests its successor, and
it's the rare item that can't be improved. Hence, as it must
be in every healthy company, every effort is made at Dow

resources.

A Technic editor returns from a summer in
Alaska and reports on the opportunities for
young engineers that he found there.
by BRYAN WHIPPLE,
Associate Edifor
Alaska's largest atomic power
plant Is rapidly being completed.
The plant, a pilot project, is lo-
cated at Fort Greely, and is Alas-
ka's second atomic power plant.
I have recently returned from a rather
extended tour of Alaska. My pri-
mary concern while shuttling about the
49th state was not sightseeing, however,
so much as a sort of "prospecting." With
my senior year at the University now
dead ahead, instead of just a foggy vision
in the indefinite future, I have been
jogged into a more serious contempla-
tion of what is to become of me after
leaving the halls of ivy. This is not an
unusual phenomenon. Hundreds of my
classmates are now casting about for the
most interesting, or rewarding, or re-
munerative job prospect. Interviews, of-
fers, and applications will be the leading
topic of thought and of "bull sessions" in
the months to come. And additional
thousands of underclassmen are also (or
should also) be keeping abreast of late
trends in engineering employment.
So, while in Alaska, I prospected for
jobs. The results of my investigation were
rather surprising, even though I have
followed Alaskan affairs with consider-
able interest for years. But before any
presentation of specifics, let's look at
some of the reasons why our huge new
state should be of interest to young
engineers.
First, I would like to consider the
character of an engineer. He is tradition-
ally (and I hope that the tradition will
be maintained) a man of vision, of defi-
nite creative ability, with an ambition to
design and build newer, greater things
to serve mankind better. He must never
become a mere technician, nor allow the
caliber of his work and thought to rele-
gate him to the dustbin of the well-super-
vised engineering team. His ambition
should force him above the anonymity
of being a well-oiled cog in a solution-
cranking-out machine. His task is to lend
useful form to the discoveries of science,
and to do so well he must not only pos-
sess a superior grade of technical know-
how, but he must give plentifully from
his integrity, his understanding of the
significance of a job, and his desire to
surmount all problems in a personally
satisfying way. If any of these personal
elements is missing, the engineer risks
becoming a mere hack or drudge.
These qualities of the character of an
engineer tend to make new frontiers
necessary to him. These frontiers can be
scientific or technical, but they can also
be geographical.
If we think back to high school days,
or whenever the desire to enter engineer-
ing first came to us, these notions may
seem more familiar. What was it that
first sold us on engineering? Was it the
lure of high pay? Was it our skill in
science or math? Or mechanically-oriented
hobbies? Perhaps. But very likely many
of us will recall a sort of pioneering in-
stinct calling to us. The urge to build.
To develop. To conquer. To see cities
rise from the wilderness and bridges
span great rivers. Possibly it was a dream
of great dams and high-tension wires,
bringing factories, towns, and cities into

The energetic and forward-looking citizens of Anchorage have made this one of the
fastest-growing cities in America.
existence where yesterday there were
none. Or was it mines and wells, tapping
the wealth of the earth, where but a
short time ago the sod lay unbroken and
the riches therein unknown and unused?
Whatever your dream was, friend engi-
neer, where is it now? Will graduation
find your talents forever entombed in
some antique pesthole of an industrial
complex, cobwebby and mired in policy,
red tape, lines of authority, committees,
et al.? Or will you risk a few fringe
benefits on the possibility of a refreshing,
rewarding career on the frontiers of
knowledge or of civilization?
There are a number of such frontiers.
It is by no means necessary to exile ones-
self to the ends of the earth to find them.
However, Alaska has so much to offer,
and so much can be said here without
exhausting the subject, that this discus-
sion will be limited to this state. Need-
less to say, no such restriction applies
to the philosophical content of this re-
port, but I must limit my factual account-
ing to what I have seen.
Alaska is big. Plunk it down on top
of the older 48 states, and it reaches
from North Carolina to California, and
from Mexico to Canada. This is the result
of a very irregular shape, but the actual
land area alone is about 2/5 the size of
the older states. The climate varies enor-
mously, from strictly Arctic to Minne-
sota type. About half of the state is mild
enough so that Michiganders would ex-
perience no great discomfort upon living
there year-round.
Cities up there are few, extremely few,
considering the size of the place. How-
ever, they lack none of the comforts of
other U. S. cities, and Anchorage, the
largest (82,500) is one of the finest
cities to be found anywhere. With two
TV and five radio stations, two daily
papers, wide, paved streets, and all man-
ner of completely modern stores and
buildings, Anchorage is a comfortable,
sophisticated place to live. The same is
true to a lesser extent of the other Alas-
kan cities, many of which present an un-
usual contrast between pioneer and mod-
ern character.
Outside the cities and towns, the emp-
tiness of the countryside is quite a reve-
lation. The desolation is at once exciting
and depressing. An enormous amount of
hard work and money is needed to
raise it above the level of an economic
desert, yet the magnificence of the op-
portunity is invigorating.
Despite the rapid pace at which the
development of Alaska has proceeded in
the last decade or so, it is fair to say
that the surface has scarcely been
scratched. Perhaps the thing that strikes
the visiting engineer most strongly (as
far as job opportunities go) is that most
of the potential jobs for him haven't
even been created yet.
In Alaska, an engineer does not merely
visit a • company recruiter,.- or scan the
classified ads to get a job. Sure, this can
be done sometimes. But most of the jobs
in Alaska have not even been created,yet.
To get started up there, a young man will
likely need more than a sheepskin or a
few years' experience. He will need a
fistfull of dough. He will need brains
and ambition .and guts. But if he is
lucky, he will get back everything he puts
in, and plenty more.
The present economy of Alaska seems,
to me, to be very unsoundly based on
military expenditures. Presently, federal
spending is at the root of a very active
economy, with timber harvesting, some
oil exploration, transportation, fishing,
some farming, and an infant mining in-
dustry riding along. Any significant de-
crease in military construction would kick
the stilts out from under the economy in
very unceremonious fashion. Recovery,
while certain, would be painful and slow.
Nonmilitary economic activity in Alas-
ka is either extractive in nature (lumber-
ing, farming, fishing) or in support of
military operations (most mining and
transportation). There is no noteworthy
process or manufacturing industry. In
the event of military pullout, the sup-
porting industries would be curtailed.
The extractive industries are generally
seasonal, largely staffed with migratory
or native labor, and do not support any
substantial resident White population.
An unusual condition exists in the
skilled trades. Despite very high wages,
there is a great deal of unemployment,
and local unions advise those seeking em-
ployment in carpentry and steelworking,
or electricians, plumbers, truck drivers,
and masons not to try Alaska without
prior assurance of a job.
For engineers, the prospects are a
little brighter. Immediate employment
for virtually any kind of engineer or
architect can be obtained with the State
Department of Public Works, or with
other State or Federal agencies. These
jobs generally involve road, bridge, and
highway location and construction; equip-
ment maintenance; school design and
construction, or like fields. Electrical en-
gineers with a yen to work outdoors can
secure well-paid jobs in communications
or in radar and missile-defense setups.
And there is usually a scattering of other
openings in any field outside of manu-
facturing and most types of research.
The enormous opportunity for engi-
neers, however, is in the opportunities
that are never advertised—those for men
with a lot of initiative and a little capi-
tal. For in Alaska's resources lies the fu-
ture of a good portion of U. S. industrial
production. While the present market
and transportation picture deals Alaska
out as a supply, production (and there-
fore) population center, the outlook must
certainly change as we use up the re-
sources and. even the empty space of the
rest of the nation. Indeed, some phases
of the unprecedented Alaska boom to
come can already be forecast without too
much supposition.
The Army Corps of Engineers is cur-
rently making an extensive study of a

generation capacity would exceed 5,750,-
000 kilowatts—more than Hoover Dam
and Grand Coulee combined, or more
than the whole of the TVA. Several
auxiliary dams would raise the total
even higher—near eight million kilo-
watts. The price tag—a billion dollars—
but that's still dirt cheap power. This
project may be under way in ten years
or less.
Another project of enormous scope,
but also a ten-to-twenty year prospect, is
the construction of a rail link to Alaska.
Presently there is a modern, well-main-
tained 470-mile railroad in Alaska, but
no connection to the rest of the U. S.
An economic study is being prepared for
the government at Battelle Memorial In-
stitute. It is anticipated that the report
will be unfavorable for the present, but
that it will recommend construction after
Alaska has matured somewhat further.
Price tag—about 300 million.
(In the case of the two projects listed
above, note that the government has been
the only party to express an interest in
building them. It is to be hoped that
private capital will also give considera-
tion to these projects, both of which
seem to possess great merit as invest-
ments.)
Fossil fuels will undoubtedly contrib-
ute to the industrial economy for which
Alaska appears destined. Both coal and
oil seem to be present under the state
in large quantity. Several operating coal
mines serve local needs, and a possible
export market to Japan. A few oil wells
have been brought in, as well as good
gas wells. Development of this industry
awaits further exploration, and the con-

struction of storage, transport, and pos-
sible refining facilities. Most major oil
companies have teams in Alaska this
year.
Iron ore is only one of the minerals
that are present in abundance. A moun-
tain of magnetite near Klukwan has been
assayed at a billion tons. The bugbear
again is transportation plus wages, but
as we go farther and farther afield for
iron ore, its commercial possibility looms.
Coupled with hydro power, Alaska could
support a large electric-furnace steel in-
dusty. Suitable alloying materials are
nearby—chromium, vanadium, tungsten,
manganese, and others.

features which will someday support a
population of millions would only be
repetitious. There are thousands of small-
er opportunities, some of which can be
opened up by a single engineer with a
few thousand bucks to invest. They arc-
not all in mining, although that field
dominates the immediate picture. What
about chemicals? With countless ores,
and lots of coal, gas, and cheap power,
there is a future industrial giant. Or
forest products industries—lumber, pulp,
plywood, furniture, cellulose, and chem-
icals? Telephone communications is an
open field, with private interests grad-

future industrial prospects of note. All
forms of transportation offer expansion
opportunity. Various types of heavy-
goods manufacturing will also come in

industries such as metallurgy and power.

This month's cover story explains an intriguing
method for propelling rockets through space
which may be the key to conquest of the
universe.
by ARTHUR CHARMATZ
One pound of thrust is seemingly a
small force in this age of 100,000
pound thrust rockets. Indeed, it is so
small that many a person cannot con-
ceive of a pound of thrust being used
anywhere in the realm of rocketry. Yet,
there is a domain in that world where
even one pound thrusts are ten thousand
times bigger than those considered high.
This domain is known as electromagnetic
propulsion, with propulsion by means of
ions an outstanding member of the do-
main.
With all the large, powerful rocket
motors that exist today, why then do
scientists work with such minute in-
fants? . . . solar system traveling would
be extremely expensive if not almost im-
possible by large rocket. The fuel of an
Atlas or Thor is used within the first
few minutes of flight time, and guidance
thereafter must be based on how good
guidance was before flame-out. Surely,
small vernier rockets and rockets of the
type which have motors which start and
stop would do the job after burnout . . .
but how long would the fuel last?
Travel between planets is not now
measured in hours, days or weeks, but in
weeks, months and years!!! In such
travels, maneuvering would certainly be
necessary for both orbital positioning and
evasion of space debris. These travels
facilitate the need for an ion propulsion
system; one with a long life, as few
parts as possible and one which can create
enough thrust to accelerate a vehicle at
a reasonable rate.
Long life is probably the one most im-
portant factor in an ion propulsion motor,
as the other factors can be reasonably met
once this is achieved. In order to achieve
long life for any one motor, certain pre-
requisites must be met. One specific con-
dition is ion beam neutralization. In or-
der to have an effective thrust the ion
beam must be neutralized either by elec-
trons or negatively charged ions if the
source of the beam is positive or by posi-
tively charged ions if the source is nega-
tive. The ion beam must be kept as close
to neutral as possible as any charge in-
crease, either positive or negative, will
result in a decrease of the interelectrode
field and the ion beam will be cut off
(and thusly no thrust will be created).
Whatever the neutralization media may
be (let us use electrons), acceleration
into the ion source electrode must be
prevented. Then, energy loss due to space
charge buildup is equal to the final po-
tential about the ion thrust system minus
the potential of the electron source. This
energy loss can be minimized by having
the final potential about the system just
slightly positive with respect to the elec-
tron source (and thus enabling the motor
by having as high an efficiency as possible
to have a longer life).
By neutralization of the ion beam we
mean that we are not usually recombin-
ing ion and electron but there will be
some tendency for this to happen. While
being accelerated not only recombina-
tion but collision may occur between ion
and electron. The chance of recombina-
tion or collision happening is relatively
slim and both seem to have a minor effect
on the ion beam.
A second condition of long life is
termed "ion source efficiency." Assume
that the final velocity of the ions and the
interelectrode spacings are fixed. Assume
further that the ion source is space charge
limited. The electrical power output per
cm2 of the ion source is then found to
vary as the square of the charge-to-mass
ratio of the ion. The ratio of the power
output of the ion beam to the power
input of the ion source is called the figure
or merit of a ion source. A useful ion
source has a figure of merit greater than
10, and a source lifetime comparable to
17,000 hours. The surface ionization of
cesium is a simple way of obtaining an
abundant supply of heavy ions. It shows
the most promise of having a high figure
of merit and a long lifetime.
A third proviso for long life has to
18

prevention of sputtering, an erosion of
material due to the bombardment of
high energy ions. This is an extremly
serious problem and upper limits to the
allowable sputtering must be set. If H
is the fraction of the accelerated ions
striking an electrode, it is found that if
electrode geometry is not to be appre-
ciably altered by sputtering, H must be
less than approximately 0.01%. If elec-
trode material is replenished, the upper
limit to H is approximately 1%. The
electric fields in an ion motor are always
adjusted so that the majority of the
accelerated ions pass right by the acceler-
ating electrode due to their high velocity
(almost the speed of light). A potential
positive with respect to the accelerating
electrode will extend in the region of the
beam an appreciable distance away from
the motor. Low energy ions formed in
this region will be accelerated to the
high voltage electrode. A good deal of
sputtering and electrode erosion will re-
sult which again lessens the lifetime of
the ion motor. These low energy ions
can be formed by charge exchange of a
high energy ion with a low energy neu-
tral and by the ionization of neutral
atoms by the neutralizing electrons.
Since we are to be traveling in deep
space the weight of the vehicle (on earth
at take off) is severely critical. Conven-
tional rockets must be used for the
nitial escape of the earth's gravitational
pull since an ion motor has no effect
on the earth's surface. Thus the ten-
dency has been toward making the
motor as light and as simple as possible.
As mentioned before the lifetime of the
ion source must approach 17,000 hours
or approximately two years. This source

Tungsten in combination with cesium will probably be used as the ion source. The
sputtering, or wearing away of material, is one of the most undesirable things that
can happen to the ion source. This must be prevented to allow a long lifetime for
the source.
is the basic fuel and is a great weight
reduction compared with liquid or solid
fuels. We cannot say how much the en-
tire motor will weigh as there are many
designs all having different weights but
none probably half as heavy as any of
the big rocket motors today. Parts within
the motor are few (no valves, etc.) and
can easily be replaced.
One thing that has not been mentioned
is the source of power to run the ion
source. This can be accomplished either
by having a small atomic power plant
aboard the vehicle or by using sunlight
itself. Preferably, sunlight would be best
as then there is no need for the rocket
to lift a somewhat heavy and bulky
atomic power plant from the earth. Also,
proponents of sunlight say that their
best argument is that the sunlight is
FREE.

Art Charmatz, author of Ion
Propulsion, is a junior in the
Chemical and Metallurgical Engi-
neering Department.
A native Detroiter, Art has been
with the Technic for several semes-
ters as a writer. Among his previous
articles was "Gyros . . . From Toys
to Guidance Systems," which ap-
peared as cover article in Novem-
ber, 1959.
Once out in deep space (free of the
earth's gravitational pull) we can sit
back, turn on the motor and start to ac-
celerate. We must realize that accelera-
tion will be enormously slow because as
mentioned before the thrust of an ion
motor is measured in micropounds. The
velocity of the beam of ions is about the
speed of light and the velocity that the
vehicle could achieve would be the vel-
ocity of these ions . . . but we must re-
member that we have a destination in
mind and that we also must slow down
before we get to wherever we are going.
To slow down or decelerate, all we have
to do is reverse the direction that the
motor is pointing towards and let the
motor run until we acquire the velocity
that pleases us. This is a delicate problem
as a velocity too high or too low may
send us traveling into deeper space or
plunging like a meteor into a planet's
atmosphere. The strange thing about ion
propulsion is the time involved to get
anywhere. One might think that the ex-
haust velocity of approximately the speed
of light would get us somewhere fast but
again the mass of the vehicle and the
need to reverse engines to slow down
makes any trip quite long. An average
trip would take us to Mars in eight
months to a year depending upon the
mean distance of that planet from the
earth at traveling time. Of course, the
most important thing is that after spend-
ing a year and a half to get out to Jupiter
we know that we have the fuel (and
naturally the time) to get back to good
old terra.

THE TINY TUNNEL DIODE
The transistor and the vacuum tube now have
a rival with many unusual properties which may
yet further revolutionize schemes for electronic
amplification.

pany may not be the only people
possessing wrist radios. A new semi-
conductor device, the tunnel-diode, may
make possible such varied articles as
wrist radios, practical UHF television,
and faster computers. Just as the transis-
tor caused a revolution in electronics
when it replaced the vacuum tube, the
tunnel diode will probably cause another
revolution by replacing the transistor for
many uses.
In spite of its advantages, the transis-
tor has many drawbacks. It is a very noisy
amplifier, not very resistant to environ-
mental conditions such as heat or atomic
radiation, and, although much smaller
than the electron tube, the transistor still
leaves much to be desired in size reduc-
tion. The runnel diode promises to elimi-
nate these and other disadvantages of the
transistor without adding any major dis-
advantages of its own.
The tunnel diode was not an American
invention. It was invented in Japan by
Dr. Leo Esaki, a thirty-four year old
physicist working for the Sony Corpora-
tion. Dr. Easki was engaged in basic
research on electrical "tunneling" in ger-
manium when he discovered the funda-
mental concept of the tunnel diode. Much
of the work involved in making the
tunnel diode a practical device was per-
formed in the General Electrical Research
laboratories in Schenectady, New York
by scientists Jerome Tiemann and Robert
Hall. More extensive research in tun-
nel diodes is now being conducted in the
RCA laboratories, Bell Telephone labor-
atories, and Air Force Cambridge Re-
search Center. The device is now being
marketed in sample quantities by General
Electric and RCA.
Theory
The concept which makes the tunnel
diode possible is a law of quantum me-
chanics. This law controls the action of
electrons through the semiconductor,
which forms the diode. Electrons can
possess only certain energy levels. The
range of energies between these certain
levels are "forbidden" levels. These levels
vary according to the material. By using
this fact, the tunnel diode makes it pos-
sible for electrons to "tunnel" through a
P-N junction causing amplification at
special energy levels. The P-N junction
in the tunnel diode is between the two
parts of the diode, a P-type semiconduc-
tor, and an N-type semiconductor. The
P-type semiconductor acts as an electron
acceptor because it contains vacant elec-
tron sites in the atomic structure of its
crystals. The N-type has a surplus of
electrons, therefore it acts as an electron
donor. When no outside source of elec-
trons is applied to the diode, the elec-
trons in both parts of the diode reach a
common energy level, and tunnel both
ways across the junction at the same
rate, causing no change in the net
voltage. This is known as zero voltage.
As the energy of the electrons in the
N-type semi-conductor is increased by
the addition of voltage from an outside
source, a current of electrons flows from
the N-type across the junction into the
P-type. The current in the diode at this
point behaves as it would in any regular
conductor, increasing as the added out-
side voltage is increased.
As the voltage is increased more, a
portion of the electrons in the N-type
semiconductor reach the energy levels
which are forbidden in the P-type area.
This means that fewer electrons can pass
from the N-type into the P-type, while
the same number as before can pass from
the P-type to the N-type region. This
causes a net flow of current into the N-
type region. In other words, an increase
in voltage at the N-type has caused a
decrease in current flowing from this
region. This phenomenon is known as
negative resistance. Any device of this
type, that is, one which can provide
negative resistance, can be used as an
amplifier or oscillator. Amplification is
accomplished by keeping the voltage in
the diode just below the point at which
negative resistance begins. At this point,
the small additional voltage caused by
a signal results in a large drop in voltage,
hence amplification. If the voltage is in-
creased appreciably beyond the forbidden
regions it again comes to a permitted
energy level, hence the diode again be-
haves like a normal conductor.
The design of the diode creates a
few problems. Because it can perform
amplification in only certain voltage
ranges, circuits will have to be redesig-
nated to allow its utilization. Also, the
P-type semiconductor has to be made
impure. This process, known as doping,
establishes the rate and position at which
negative resistance occurs. Therefore,
doping is a very delicate operation, de-
manding exact control.
Advantages
These are the main disadvantages of
the tunnel diode. The advantages are
many. The transistor, small in itself, is a
giant next to the tunnel diode. This size
reduction could make possible wrist ra-
dios, small size computers, and other
miniature devices.
Because of the extremely high speed
at which the change from regular to
negative resistance and back occurs, the
tunnel diode provides a high speed
switch—about a hundred times faster
than the transistors—for computers.
The tunnel diode is versatile because it
can handle a wide variety of frequencies.
This ability is especially important when
high frequencies are encountered, since
at these frequencies, transistors are use-
less, and vacuum tubes leave much to
be desired.
It uses very little power, one thousand
less than the transistor, one hundred
thousand times less than the vacuum
tube. This feature may make possible

At low temperatures, remarkable changes take
place in conducting materials so that electric
currents flow virtually without resistance.
By IRVING SALMEEN
The development of the relatively
new science of cryogenics, more
commonly known as low temperature
physics, has brought about the discovery
of a startling phenonmenon: super con-
ductivity. This phenomenon was first
observed a little over fifty years ago by
Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, a Dutch inves-
tigator into the behavior of substances at
very low temperatures. Onnes had cooled
a sample of mercury to about 4.2 degrees
Kelvin and passed an electric current
through the sample. A startling event
occurred: the mercury lost all of its
resistance to the flow of electricity; it
had become superconducting. Further in-
vestigations by Onnes and others showed
that many metals, when cooled to a few
degrees above absolute zero, would ex-
hibit the property of superconductivity.
Shortly after Onnes's discovery, W.
Meissner, a German physicist, observed
a strange property of metals in the super-
conducting state: they were impervious
to a magnetic field. When a supercon-
ducting sample was placed between the
poles of a magnet, the lines of force
passed around the sample and the field
was expelled by the metal. Since these
initial observations, a great deal of work
has been done in an attempt to construct
a comprehensive theory that adequately
explains the properties of superconduc-
tivity and the events that occur which
cause a metal to become superconducting.
The work began with the theory of nor-
mal conductivity.
Normal Conductivity
In a normal state, metals conduct a
current because of free valence electrons.
When voltage is applied the electrons
are accelerated by the added energy and
move through the crystal lattice of the
metal forming a continual flow or cur-
rent of electrons. But the electrons can-
not move unhindered because the paths
are distorted and obstructed by collisions
with atoms in an imperfect crystal lattice
and when other atoms, moving about as
a result of thermal agitation, collide with
the electrons. The greater the imperfec-
tions and the more intense the thermal
agitation, the greater the resistance the
metal offers to the flow of current.
By eliminating the obstructions, it
seems reasonable to assume that a metal
would become superconducting. There-
fore if one cooled a metal thermal agita-
tion would subside, and if the sample
were cooled to zero degrees Kelvin,
where thermal agitation would cease,
the sample should become super conduct-
ing if the crystal lattice were perfect.
But a law of quantum theory, Heisen-
berg's uncertainty principle, rules out any
possibility that a metal could become
superconducting even at zero degrees
absolute by showing that the vibrations
of the atoms are not totally dependent
on temperature. Briefly the principle
states that on the subatomic scale the
momentum and position of a particle
cannot be simultaneously and exactly de-
termined, and the greater the certainty
in determining one, the greater the un-
certainty in detrmining the other. Now,
if at zero degrees agitation nof the atoms
stopped, it would be possible to deter-
mine both position and momentum of
the atoms; momentum being zero and the
position easily observed. However, un-
certainty says that this cannot be done;
therefore only one conclusion can be
drawn: the atoms reach a so-called zero
point vibration at absolute zero. Because
the atoms never cease vibrating, a metal
cannot become super conducting accord-
ing to the theory of normal conductivity.
First Theories
For a long time no one ventured to
suggest a theory that would explain the
phenomenon, then about twenty years
ago a German physicist working in Eng-
land, Fritz London, suggested a theory
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


theorized that in the superconducting
state the electrons revolving about the
nucleus could move n unobstructed or-
bits. The orbital electrons were, in a sense,
in the same state as the free electrons of
a superconductor, that is they could move
uninhibited. London thought that an
external magnetic field would shift the
orbits in such a manner that they would
set up a counter magnetic field, one that
would expel the applied field. At the
time of the theory it appeared as though
a magnetic field was totally expelled by
the superconductor; however, later inves-
tigators determined that in many cases
there was slight penetration at the sur-
face, the depth of penetration being de-
pendent on the intensity of the applied
field and the temperature.
London's theory did not explain the
events that lead to the superconducting
state, rather it established a set of equa-
tions which reproduced the macroscopic
phenomena of superconductivity in a
similar manner as Maxwell's equations
describe the electro-magnetic field with-
out closely inspecting its origin. In re-
cent experiments, the equations have
become very useful in determining the
depth of magnetic field penetration be-
cause they are the only equations which
yield an exact solution.
In 1950, two men working independ-
ently, John Bardeen and H. Frohlich,
proposed a theory in an attempt to ex-
plain the events that caused a metal to
become superconducting. Their theory
was based on the interaction of the elec-
trons and the vibrations of the atoms in

the crystal lattice. The theory held that at
low temperatures the vibrating atoms
oscillate in a wave pattern and become
synchronized with the motion of the
electrons so that the electrons ride along
with the lattice vibration as a wave. In
effect the lattice becomes the agent of
conduction. Such a theory was suggested
by the fact that metals that were poor
conductors at normal temperatures were
most likely to become superconductors.
At normal temperatures the poor con-
ductors would have a strong ordering

Transition temperature, or temperature
at which a substance becomes super-
conducting, is related to the number of
its valence electrons. For example, the
transition temperature of lanthanum (La)
is 4.37 degrees Kelvin; while that of
technetium (Tc) is 11 degrees Kelvin.
Only one group of 13 superconducting
elements is shown; there is a second
group of 10 elements and a large num-
ber of compounds and alloys.
effect. Furthermore, the heavy elements
and compounds would be less likely to
become superconducting than light ma-
terials because the low temperature vibra-
tions would be slower for the heavy
metals than for the light ones. Later
tests proved this to be true.
Characteristics of Superconductors
The theory seemed to be sound, but it
still offered no dependable means of pre-
dicting which metals would become su-
perconductors. In 1950, John K. Hulm
and B. T. Matthias, working at Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories, began a series of
experiments by which they sought to
establish a pattern of physical and chemi-
cal properties that would characterize

metals that would become superconduc-
tors. The two experimenters began test-
ing compounds and elements, one by one.
Finally after three years the pattern be-
came clear. The most characteristic fea-
ture was the number of valence electrons
per atom. They found that compounds or
elements with an average of two to eight
valence electrons per atom were the ones
that became superconductors and those
within this range with an odd number
became superconductors easiest (at the
highest temperature). They also found
that crystal structure was important.
Compounds with a bulky structure and
a relatively large amount of empty space
were most conducive to the superconduct-
ing state.
After establishing this pattern the two
experimenters verified its reliability with
some striking tests. Technetium, a prod-
uct of uranium fission, has seven valence
electrons per atom, and becomes super-
conducting at the relatively high tempera-
ture of 11°K. The element before tech-
netium in the periodic table is molyb-
denum, with six valence electrons per
atom; it will not become superconducting
at the lowest attainable temperature of
one tenth of one degree Kelvin. The
element after technetium, ruthenium with
an average number of valence electrons
of eight, becomes superconducting at
.5°K.
They discovered that it was even
possible to make a superconductor of
two totally unfit materials. They made
an alloy of silicon and cobalt, silicon
being unsuitable because it is a nonmetal
and a nonconductor and cobalt because

ence electrons per atom. The two com-
bined to form a cubic structure, the
silicon neutralized cobalt's magnetic prop-
erties, the average number of electrons
was reduced to the proper range, and the
combination became superconducting.
Present Theory
With this empirical data to work with
and the Bardeen-Frolich theory, another
theory was presented in 1957 by John
Bardeen, Leon N. Cooper, and J. Robert
Schrieffer, which appears to account for
all of the important properties of super-
conductivity. The new theory, like the
first one of Bardeen and Frolich, was
based on the interactions between elec-
trons and the vibrational motions of a
metal's atoms.
They theorized that at low tempera-
tures interactions between the vibrations
of the atoms in the crystal lattice and the
motion of the electrons causes th? elec-
trons in a superconductor to be associ-
ated in pairs. When voltage is applied
each pair is set into motion in such a way
that the net momentum of each pair is
the same, and when there is no voltage
the net momentum is zero. In the super-
conducting state there are no erratic
motions over the whole superconduc-
tor because each pair moves in the same
way. There is little or no interference by
the crystal lattic because it is the agent
by which the electrons move and be-
come associated in pairs.
Pardeen points out that to a small de-
gree electron scattering does occur local-
ly; however, this local scattering is not
sufficient to change the common momen-
tum of the electrons or the total current.
Once a current is started only an external
force that acts on all the electrons at the
same time, can change the current. The
theory appears to be sound in everything
except one point: the mathematical treat-
ment of the magnetic effect. Bardeen
feels, however, that the main part of
this explanation is in showing how the
electronic structure of the superconduct-
ing state with its associated electron pairs
differs from that found in normal mentals.
Superconducting Thin Films
With the London and Bardeen-Cooper-
Schreiff theories to work, with experi-
menters have begun to investigate the
properties of the state in greater detail
and with more confidence. In 1956 super-
conducting thin films were developed.
(A thin film is an extremely thin layer
of a substance on the order of several
hundred to several thousand Angstroms
thick depending on the type of film.)
Before the advent of thin films most ex-
periments had to be performed on a
bulk superconductor, however this was
not too desirable because such things as
impurities and absorbed gas can have an
appreciable effect on the superconducting
properties. But the technology of making
a thin film makes it possible to greatly
decrease the chances of contamination.
Using thin films in superconductor ex-
periments, considerable work has been
done toward verifying the BSC theory.
Another useful application of thin
films has been in investigating the mag-
neic effect, particularly the penetration
depth. Experimentally it is easier to in-
vestigate this on a thin film than on a
bulk superconductor because the thin
film can be made of the same magnitude
as the penetration depth itself. While
using thin films, accuracy is increased
because the penetration value can be
obtained to the same accuracy to which
the dimensions of the sample are known.
However, with a bulk superconductor,
experimenters are only able to detect
changes in the depth and then to a small
degree. Both theories predict such pene-
tration and give equations for determin-
ing the depth, however, because of the
nature of each theory, the predicted depth
is different for each. In this aspect, the
London theory becomes more applicable
because the equations can be exactly
solved.
Applications
There are many conceivable applica-
tions of superconductivity, but present
technical knowledge is not sufficient to
make such applications feasible. More
work must be done on basic theory and
the technology of making superconduct-
ing metals and maintaining them in the
superconducting state. Once the phe-
nomenon is fully understood and super-
conducting metals can be made easily
and maintained in the state, one of the
first applications will be in high speed
computers. Speed and efficiency of a
computer are often severely limited be-
cause of power losses due to imperfec-
tions and natural deficiencies of present
electronic devices. Employing supercon-
ductors in a circuit would eliminate this
problem. Other applications would be in
devices that operate on very small currents
such as the transmission line from the
antenna to the amplifier of a radio tele-
scope, high speed switches and ultra
sensitive electrical measuring devices. As
indicated by these few applications,
superconductors will enable engineers to
design electronic machines using a mini-
mum amount of current without loss of
energy.

"SHOP-TALK" SESSION FOR SCIENTISTS

In a company where scientific research
ranges all the way from palynology to
metal stress, the need for an exchange of
information is imperative. Much of this
can be accomplished with written reports.
However, Standard Oil has found that a
"Shop-Talk" conference once each year
accomplishes a meeting of scientific minds
that is even more satisfactory.
This year, at Standard's 18th Annual
Joint Technical Meeting more than 80
technical papers were presented to 350
technical experts and representatives of
other departments. Discussed were such
subjects as the potential use of atomic
energy as a commercial fuel source, elec-
tronic computer controls, and the use of
$80-an-ounce platinum in making higher
octane gasolines. In addition to these
formal meetings, small discussion groups
and conversations between individuals
contributed to the exchange of ideas. The
result was a stimulating five-day period
that saw new ideas take shape. The meet-
ing benefited everyone—scientists, the
company, and consumers.
This type of meeting, which Standard
pioneered, is another example of scientific
leadership by Standard, and another rea-
son why men with technical training find
a Standard Oil career offers unusual cre-
ative encouragements.

telescope disks like these have been developed for use in missiles,

Lightweight Mirors for Space
Telescope
New lightweight mirrors of fused sil-
ica have been developed for use in mis-
sile, satellite, and airborne telescope
systems. Corning Glass Works is pro-
ducing mirror blanks made by an unusual
sandwich construction that reduces size
and weight of mounting and auxiliary
equipment, vital considerations in aero-
space telescopes.
Because they require less elaborate sup-
porting structures, these reflective disks
also offer an advantage in ground obser-
vatory installations. The mirror blanks
consist of two fused silica plates sepa-
rated by walls or tubes of the same high
purity glass. The rigs are permanently
sealed to each plate under intense heat.
With this type of construction, and de-
pendent on design, mirror weight can be
reduced to half that of a solid disk with
equal surface area, Corning said.
The near zero thermal expansion of
fused silica means the mirrors will retain
their shape under sudden and extreme
temperature changes. The ribs help main-
tain rigidity. These qualities assure dis-
tortion-free images even in hostile en-

mirror blanks in a wide range of sizes
and shapes and a variety of rib construc-
tions. Fused silica can be formed to meet
design requirements of virtually all tele-
scope systems.
Perfection of improved manufacturing
techniques enables the company to fabri-
cate the blanks in minimum time. Surface
of the blanks will accept any standard
reflective coatings and can be precision
ground and finished with standard optical
equipment. Clarity of the material allows
minute inspection of the piece before
finishing gets underway. Corning fused
silica, formed by a special technique de-
veloped by company research scientists,
is one of the purest man-made substances.
Impurities average less than one part
per million.
Thermoelectric-Thermonionic
Generator
Scientists have combined two ad-
vanced forms of power generation to
convert the heat of fission inside a nu-
clear reactor directly into electricity.
Dr. William E. Shoupp, technical di-
rector of the Westinghouse atomic pow-
er department, said that, for the first
time, a thermionic and thermoelectric
generator was built into a nuclear fuel
assembly and inserted into a reactor to
produce electricity.
This experiment, conducted by Peter
J. McCoy, was operated at the Westing-
house Testing Reactor at Waltz Mill,
Pa., and produced about one watt of
power. It was designed to determine the
feasibility of such a "dual" generator
without consideration of optimum effi-
ciency or high power output. Taking
part in the six-month development pro-
gram leading up to the experiment were
Dr. G. R. Feaster of the Westinghouse
electronic tube division, Elmira, N. Y.,
and scientists of the research laboratories
near Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dr. Shoupp said there are significant
inherent power losses in today's nuclear
powered generating stations, caused by
the large temperature drop from the
center of the fuel elements to the outside
surfaces in contact with the cooling water.
While some fuel elements themselves
reach temperatures above 4000 degrees
F in the fission process, he explained,
nuclear scientists can get only about 600-
degree temperatures out of the fuel ele-
ments and into the surrounding water.
This limits the amount of heat which
can be taken from the fuel.

Diagram of the thermionic-thermoelectric generator. It converts the heat of fission
inside a nuclear reactor directly into electricity.
To use the heat energy at the higher
temperatures, Westinghouse scientists
built a fuel element with the thermionic
generator in its center and a thermoelec-
tric generator surrounding it. Both meth-
ods of converting heat directly to elec-
tricity operate on similar principles, but
operate most efficiently at widely diver-
gent temperatures. A thermionic gener-
ator operates at about 3500 degrees F—
but will not function efficiently at tem-
peatures below 2700 degrees F. A therm-
oelectric unit, on the other hand, does
not operate at such elevated tempera-
tures, but works well in the temperature
range of 600 to 1800 degrees F.
By putting the two types of generators
in tandem, the heat passing through the
thermionic generator flows through the
thermoelectric unit. The elements are
wired in series to give a combined elec-
trical output over a very wide tempera-
ture range.
Dr. Joseph C. Danko, manager of di-
rect conversion activities at the atomic
power department said, "While this
experiment was just to determine feasi-
blity of the heat conversion system, the
development program will continue to-
ward the goal of increasing the efficiency
of the device."

IDEAS CAN COME FROM ANYWHERE AT IBM
The expansion of data systems technology at
IBM continues at a dynamic pace. To maintain
this pace requires the continual infusion and
cross-pollination of new and highly original
ideas. These ideas must come from all fields
including programming, research, manufactur-

DUALITY
The Technic presents this year's winning Tau
Beta Pi pledge essay.
by FRED SWINEHART
Not in definition, but discussion, let
us look at the nature of Intellec-
tualism, and especially the form it has
taken in modern society.
Looking back in time to the days of
Euripides and Aeschylus, to the times of
the Orestia and the other wonderful
works of the 4th and 5th century Athe-
nians, we become aware of the classical
ideas regarding the highest circles of
man's mental endeavor. Here is the con-
cern with the qualitative: the study of
man, the state; of the creative truths;
poetry, song, and the perfection of
sculpture. Surely, some of the most
moving and fundamental questions had
their initiation and first discussion here.
But even this early in man's efforts to-
ward the understanding of himself and
his world were spread the germs of a
coming schism, one that today affects
us all. One that we, as technical men,
must strive to mend.
The early natural philosophers, men
like Pythagoras and Archimedes, arc fine
examples of the blending of mental
directions. These men, at this time,
could comprehend and be sympathetic
to the prime achievements by their con-
temporaries, whether in the fine arts, the
mathematics, or the enginering of the
day.
This ability, and indeed the desire of
men to know and hold the TOTAL pic-
ture of intellectual accomplishment as
a thing of high value is spread through
the ages; highlighted by names like
Michaelangelo, Galileo, Francis Bacon,
Ben Franklin and thousands of lesser
lights. This desire is with us still, but
since Maxwell's time, it has become in-
creasingly difficult to satisfy.
The first real jolt the classical intcl-
lectual received was, I suppose, when
Darwin's theory was formally proposed.
Here was an interesting situation. This
was, of course, a scientific triumph of
the first magnitude. Yet it was couched
in terms that an intelligent layman could
think in, and was able to discuss. I feel
that this was probably the last of the
great achievements of the mind of man
that the bold intellect, whatever his
training, could intelligently discuss.
How long did Maxwell's truly phe-
nomenal results go unknown to the "ed-
ucated man"? What is known today, by
many of our own most celebrated "in-
tellectuals" of Einstein, or Bohr or
Schroedinger? How about our "egghead"
statesmen, our "high powered" play-
wrights; our lawmakers and lecturers,
those pillars of society that have no more
feeling for an orbiting sputnik than for
hydro-electric power; and for either less
than the mere word "infinity." (One of
many which they find themselves alto-
gether too eager to use.)
What has happened? Here are the
supposed giants of our culture walking
around in ignorance (not of existence
but of content) of what are unquestion-
ably the supreme mental achievements of
the ages.
A wall seems to have arisen between
the technical man and the classic scholar.
Its magnitude you may judge for your-
self. Just look around. Get away from
your workbench and ask your banker, or
your lawyer, "What is Hooke's Law?",
or "does E = IR?", or "What keeps the
moon up there?" Some may know, but
fewer than you may realize. Something
has sprung up between our worlds; al-
though this wall doesn't bother you and 1
when we go the other way. For cannot
we read Shakespeare and Voltaire, appre-
ciate Renoir and Gaugin, or hear Beetho-
ven and Tschaikowsky? Certainly the
works of T. S. Eliot and W. H. Auden
are familiar to us all. Or are they? And
if not, why not? It may sound foolish at
first, but the reason is clear. There are
very real and definite doubts and fears
that linger in us all when we are faced
with departures as radical as these from
our accustomed thought patterns.
To us, as technical people, brought
up in a world speaking the language of
the great masters just mentioned, this
departure is not one tenth as evident as
the one the classically educated man
faces. Our world's literature is displayed
in a field of differential equations, its
pastoral scenes in the flowing curves of
a thousand data correlations, its sym-
phonies the blending of an algebraic
language and mathematical thought. It
is no wonder that the non-professional,
upon first contact, finds himself amazed
and recoils from the further probing of
our seemingly incomprehensible and ter-
rifying environment.
I feel that we as technical people must
do what we can to heal the cleft that
has opened before us. The exact man-
ner of accomplishing this is a personal
matter, but as ever, the first step is the
definition of the problem. What follows
is, I suppose, in the form of a challenge,
and one well worth taking up ... I
charge you, scientist, engineer, and
mathematician, to discover the wall;
look over it and around it . . . above all,
destroy it. To replace it by a door asks
too much, but a dear pane of glass
would be a wonderful thing!

AND
RESEARCH
Edited by CHARLES MASSER
Radio Waves From Space
University of Michigan scientists have
measured radio waves from the planet
Saturn and from a planetary nebula—a
remote and gas-surrounded dying star,
the University's head of radio astron-
omy reported here today. U-M Professor
Fred T. Haddock reported these first
clear and unambiguous detections and
measurements of Saturn and a planetary
nebula to the 13th General Assembly of
the International Scientific Radio Union.
The findings are basic contributions to
scientific knowledge. They could also
help save money in future planetary ex-
ploration and possibly lead to modifica-
tion of theories of planetary nebulae.
The measurements were made with
the U-M's high precision 85-foot radio
telescope through the use of a new and
highly-sensitive ruby maser amplifier.
This amplifier was developed by the
University's Willow Run Laboratories in
an application of its earlier discovery, in
1957, of maser action in ruby. "The
maser developed by WRL made it prac-
tical to get these results," Professor Had-
dock said. "Without it, it would be a
long-time, uncertain and tedious process."
The measurements were made by Jerald
J. Cook, 27, (of Kalamazoo} and Lloyd
G. Gross, 25, (of Flint), of Willow Run
Laboratories and by Alan E. Barrett
(Ph.D.) and William E. Howard III
(Ph.D.), (both of Ann Arbor) of the
Radio Astronomy Observatory. Cook and
Cross also designed, built, and installed
the ruby maser amplifier.
Saturn's atmospheric temperature was
found to be 100 degrees Kelvin (minus
283 degrees F.), about the temperature
expected on the basis of optical studies.
The naturally-generated radio waves are
emitted from various depths in the plan-
et's atmosphere, Prof. Haddock pointed
out. The measurement may make possible
study of the temperature and density of
the rings of Saturn and of the distribu-
tion of gases in Saturn's atmosphere.
Precise measurements at a number of
frequencies are needed for this, Profes-
sor Haddock pointed out. The U-M find-
ings are accurate within 10 per cent,
which Haddock termed "pretty good."
Planetary nebulae are stars, like our
sun, which, however, are in the last
stages of their lives. Each consists of a
small hot central star surrounded by a
very thin "high vacuum" gas cloud some
millions of millions of miles in diameter.
The central star in each is atomically
burning itself up; its mass turning into
energy which excites the gas particles
giving off radio waves. Measurement of
a planetary nebula—in this case one
3,000 light years away designated NCG
(New Galactic Catalog) 6543—is sig-
nificant because these sources are small
and very distant. Their radio emission
has been looked for for some time but had
not been definitely measured before. Such
measurements can help determine elec-
tron densities in the gas envelope, Prof.
Haddock said.
"Combined with optical and addi-
tional radio measurements, it will be
possible to shed light on the evolutionary
processes of stars, the physical character-
istics of planetary nebulae, and perhaps
detect both the existence of magnetic
fields in nebulae and cosmic ray elec-
trons surrounding these nebulae," he
pointed out. Together, optical and radio
observations can thus help astronomers
determine how stars age and die.
Professor Haddock said radio astro-
nomical observations of the planets will
be basic to their later exploration by
space probe instrumentation and by man,
and could thus save millions of dollars
in space exploration planning. For in-
stance, radio studies of Jupiter revealed
intense radiation belts that could dam-
age electronic equipment and photo-
graphic recording film on a space probe
sent there. And the surface temperature
of Venus has been found by radio as-
sronomers to be much hotter than ex-
pected—around 580 degrees (F). Only
radio astronomy could discover this be-
cause the planet is enshrouded in a
permanent cloud cover.
The measurement of Saturn and NGC
6543 are due largely to the ruby maser
amplifier. The maser's value to radio
astronomy lies in its relative absence of
the self-produced static inherent in stand-
ard radio receivers. This static can drown
out weak incoming signals in conven-

was developed by Willow Run Labora-
tories as part of its Project MICHIGAN,
under the sponsorship of the U.S. Army
Combat Surveillance Agency. This par-
ticular application is but one of many
now underway throughout the country,
based upon WRL's discovery in 1957 of
"maser" (Aficrowage .simplification by
Stimulated Emission of .Radiation) action
in ruby.
The U-M's radio telescope, dedicated
last October, was built by the U-M with
the support of the Office of Naval Re-
search. The scientists of WRL and the
observatory are now striving for other
findings and further equipment develop-
ments. Cook and Cross are planning im-
proved maser receivers for the telescope,
while they and the astronomers are con-
tinuing to search for and measure new
and significant celestial sources. They
are enthusiastic over the prospects. "New
technological developments make it ap-
pear possible to improve the performance
of the maser receiver 10-fold, while
making its operation very much easier,"
said George Mahkov, acting head of
WRL's Solid-State Physics Laboratory.
In 1958, radio astronomers Frank
Drake and Harold Ewen reported briefly
getting one signal from both Saturn and
another planetary nebula using a 28-foot
telescope and a traveling wave tube (con-
ventional) receiver. The uncertainty of
this reported single observation has led
radio astronomers generally to regard
their findings as inconclusive.
Aid For Phoenix Project
A check for $50,000 has been received
by The University of Michigan as the
first of five payments comprising a gift
of $250,000 from the Ford Motor Com-
pany Fund to the U-M's Phoenix Project.
Similar checks will be presented by the
Ford Motor Company Fund each June
over the next four years to aid the Uni-
versity's Michigan - Memorial - Phoenix
Project, a campus-wide research program
in peaceful uses of atomic energy.
The Ford Motor Company Fund gift,
accepted by the Regents at their last
meeting, brought to over $1.9 million
the University's campaign for $2.5 mil-
lion to support the Project over the next
five years.
The Ford Motor Company Fund was
incorporated in 1950 for philantrophy
in the fields of health, social welfare,
education, the humanities and scientific
research.
Orbiting Astronomical
Observatory
An orbiting astronomical observatory
satellite weighing "tens of tons" might
be preferable to a moon-based space ob-
servatory. Prof. Leo Goldberg, chairman
of The University of Michigan's Depart-
ment of Astronomy, stated this opinion
in a lecture on "Studying the Universe
from a Space Platform," part of a series
on "Peacetime Uses of Space" sponsored
by the University of California at Los
Angeles. Either the satellite or moon ob-
servatory probably could be established
within 20 years, he said.
Professor Goldberg said that, while
the moon might seem more suitable be-
cause it offers a more firm foundation
for an observatory, the absence of grav-
ity in a satellite would be a very great
advantage in achieving accurate pointing
of telescopes. A man might function bet-
ter on the moon, he continued, but "It
is also not clear that the physical pres-
ence of a man will even be necessary for
the successful operation of the (satellite)
observatory." In fact, he said, "the pres-
ence of a man in the same package with
the telescope would be a serious and
almost impossible liability to overcome,
because even the slightest movement or
shifting of weight would cause the satel-
lite and telescope to revolve and would
make accurate pointing well nigh im-
possible."
It is "perfectly feasible," Dr. Goldberg
said, "to launch a large telescope into
orbit around the earth, to point it ac-

HEART OF THE POWER-SEAT MECH-
ANISM ... Two slave units, on the left
and right sides of seat, are driven by flexi-
ble shafts to provide three-way motion.
A single !4-hp motor attached to a
geared drive unit is the power source.
Flexible shafts rotate at 1250 rpm, carry
9 in.-lbs. of torque at running load (three
persons) and 15 in.-lbs. at full stall speed.

Flexible Shafts Solve Space Problems in Chrysler Power-Seat
Chrysler Corporation faced a design challenge
in its power-operated seat adjuster. Six-way mo-
tion was called for: fore and aft, up and down,
and tilt. Yet there was limited space under the
seat for the mechanism. After much Chrysler
testing and development, a design submitted by
subcontractor Ferro Stamping Company was
approved, utilizing flexible shafts.
According to Chrysler, the decision to go to
flexible shafts was based on the following ad-
vantages:
1. SPACE ECONOMY..."flexible shafts pro-
vided means to transmit power from a single elec-
tric motor, without compromising seat design."
2. REDUCED STRESSES.. ."flexible shafts
act as torsion bars to reduce motor armature
stresses induced when the mechanism was
stopped or stalled suddenly."
3. RELIABILITY..."not a single shaft fatigue
failure reported from the field to date."
4. LOW COST.. ."flexible shafts definitely rep-
resented savings without sacrificing design ad-
vantages."
Investigate for yourself how flexible shafts
can solve many of your design problems and at
the same time reduce costs!

Forthcoming space exploration
will require exotic fuels and new concepts in
energy conversion to keep men alive and equip-
ment operating for long periods of time beyond
the earth's atmosphere. Advanced hydrogen sys-
tems recently developed by The Garrett Corpora-
tion have solved this problem of providing the
electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic power, plus
cooling and heating required aboard a satellite or
space capsule during launching, outer space flight
and re-entry.
Besides such spacecraft and missile systems,
other product areas in which Garrett engineers
work include small gas turbine engines, flight
data systems for air and underwater use, nuclear
and solar power systems, cryogenic systems and

controls, and air conditioning and pressurization
systems for conventional aircraft and advanced
flight vehicles.
Such diversity of interest not only makes work
more interesting at Garrett, but gives the engineer
an opportunity to increase his knowledge and
chances for responsibility and advancement.
An orientation program lasting a period of
months is also available for the newly graduated
engineer, working on assignments with experi-
enced engineers in laboratory, preliminary design
and development projects. In this way his most
profitable area of interest can be found.
Should you be interested in a career with The
Garrett Corporation, write to Mr. G. D. Bradley

TECHNIC TEASERS
1) There was recently a sale of various
articles of ladies' apparel on the second
floor of a downtown department store. A
young woman and her grandmother were
rushing to get to the sale before the best
bargains were all gone. They reached the
foot of the escalator going from the first
floor to the second floor at the same time
and stepped on the first step together.
Since they were in a hurry to get to the
sale, they did not stand still and ride the
escalator up, but walked up, both at a
constant rate until they reached the top.
The young lady forgot that her grand-
mother could not keep up with her, and
walked as fast as she could. The older
woman was only able to take one step
for every three that her younger com-
panion took. Of course, when the young
woman reached the top, she had to wait
for her grandmother, so she didn't gain
anything by her rushing. The grand-
mother took 24 steps and the grand-
daughter took 36 steps. How many steps
were in sight at one time on the moving
staircase?
2) A church hymn board has four
grooved rows on which the numbers of
four hymns chosen for the service are
placed: the hymn book in use contains
700 hymns. What is the smallest number
of numbers, each carrying one digit,
which must be kept in stock so that the
numbers of any four different hymns
selected can be displayed; and how will
the result be affected if an inverted 6
can be used for a 9?
3) Once upon a time, there lived a
rich farmer who had 30 children, 15 by
his first wife, who was dead, and 15 by
his second wife. The latter woman was
eager that her eldest son should inherit
the property. Accordingly one day, she
said to him, "Dear Husband, you are
getting too old. We ought to settle who
shall be heir. Let us arrange our 30
children in a circle, and counting from
one of them, remove every tenth child
until there remains but one, who shall
succeed to your estate."
Quite astonished was the old man, as
the first 14 children eliminated were by
his first wife. Noticing this he realized
that the odds were 15 to 1 that the lat-
ter wife's children would be chosen.
"From this point on," the old man sug-
gested that they count backwards from
the lone remaining child from the de-
ceased wife. Which one became heir?
What order did they start?
4) A man is going to make a trip of
27,000 miles. His tires are guaranteed
for 12,000 miles each. What is the small-
est number of tires that he must take
(including the four tires that are on the
car) in order to make the trip? Explain.
5) There are four kegs all having
small leaks. One fills a mug in two hours,
another fills the same mug in three
hours, another in four hours, and the
remaining keg fills the mug in one
half hour. If the liquid being lost from
each keg is all funneled into the same
mug, how long will it take to fill the
mug.

projects one inch above the top of the
vessel. When the pestle is sloped, the
top of it rests even with the edge of
the vessel. What is the length of the

Boron-10 vs. brain tumors
Physicians and scientists working in
cancer research at Brookhaven National
Laboratory, Upton, N. Y., are probing
the use of Boron-10 isotope in treating
a common type of brain tumor (glio-
blastoma multiforme).
Results of this therapy are so encour-
aging that Brookhaven and at least two
other institutions are constructing addi-
tional nuclear reactors used in this
therapeutic venture.
The method. In a technique known as
Neutron Capture Therapy, the patient
receives an injection of a Boron-10 com-
pound. Cancerous tissue absorbs most
of the neutrons.
In the split second that the Boron-10
becomes radioactive, it produces short-
ranged alpha particles which destroy
cancerous tissue with a minimum of
damage to healthy tissue.
Producing the isotope. The plant fur-
nishing Boron-10 to Brookhaven ordi-
narily turns out about three pounds
during a 24-hour work day. Separation
of the isotope takes place in what is
described as "the world's most efficient
fractionating system." In 350 feet of
total height, six series-connected Monel*
nickel-copper alloy columns enrich a
complex containing 18.8% Boron-10 iso-
tope to one containing 92% Boron-10.
Purification. To purify the 92% con-
centrate, a whole series of complicated
processing steps are needed . . . includ-
ing deep freeze. Columns, reboilers,
condensers, vessels, pumps, and piping
abound —each a constant challenge . . .
both to the metal and to those concerned
with equipment design and operation.
How would you meet such chal-
lenges? Some problems, of course, were
unique and demanded ingenuity of a
high order. But answers to most, 90%
or more, could be found in the vast
"experience bank" maintained by Inco
... some 300,000 indexed and cross-
referenced reports of metal perform-
ance under all manner of conditions.
Make a mental note: (1) that The
International Nickel Company is a rich
source of information on high-tempera-
ture and corrosion-resisting alloys; (2)
that Inco makes this experience avail-
able tO you. flW, Inco

Gallium arsenide tunnel diodes like the one shown have closely controlled peak
point currents for use in computers.
portable television sets, and will be es-
pecially valuable for space satellites and
other uses where the power supply is
severely limited.
Environmental conditions have little
effect on it. It has worked at temperatures
as high as 650 degrees F., much higher
than possible with transistors. At the
other end, it can work as low as — 450
degrees F. Neutron irradiation has al-
most no effect—about one thousand times
less than the transistor—on it. It is also
unaffected by humidity.
As important as the previous facts are,
none is more important than the fact
that the tunnel diode is a quiet ampli-
fier. Only the maser and the group of
amplifiers known as parametric ampli-
fiers or junction diodes are quieter. Both
require much power, and the maser is
extremely complicated and needs liquid
helium for operation. Therefore, the
tunnel diode becomes the quietest of the
more practical amplifiers, the transistor,
vacuum tube, and the tunnel diode.
Manufacture
Manufacturing the tunnel diode is in
some ways much simpler than manufac-
turing its rival, the transistor. Transis-
tors need extremely pure crystals. Be-
cause of subsequent doping, this is un-
necessary in the tunnel diode. Also sur-
face problems, present in transistors, are
eliminated. The simple structure of the
diode makes it easy and inexpensive to
produce.
A variety of materials have been used
for the tunnel diode. Bell Labs have used
indium antimonide and RCA, gallium
arsenide. Silicon and germanium, the
materials of the transistor, have also
been used extensively.
The first tunnel diodes produced were
samples which sold for about $75 each
by General Electric. These samples ap-
peared a little over a year ago. General
Electric and Bell are now actively en-
gaged in sample production. It is hoped
that the diode will soon be cheaper to
produce than the transistor.
Many uses have been proposed for
the tunnel diode. The small radio, port-
able television, and faster computer have
already been mentioned. The diode can
be used for amplification, occilation, con-
version, limiting, detection, automatic
frequency control, gating, switching and
other functions. These abilities make the
diode very useful. It is quite probable
that it will make possible UHF televi-
sion, which would greatly increase the
number of broadcasting stations. The
problems with UHF television up to this
time has been the need for a low noise
amplifier to boost the signals which
weaken quickly after leaving the trans-
mitting equipment. With quieter ampli-
fication the UHF stations could reach a
sizeable audience which would make
them practical.
The tunnel diode will not replace older
electronic devices, the vacuum tube, the
transistor, and others, nor will it make
the newer devices, the parametric ampli-
fiers, masers, and so forth, useless. Rather
it will augment and supplement them.
For many uses the tunnel diode is ideal,
for others the other devices are better
suited. In any case, the tunnel diode is
certain to enlarge the scope of electron-
ic miracles at our fingertips.

curately at any chosen star by radio
command from the earth, and to receive
data at a ground-station, also by radio."
Furthermore, the relative closeness of a
satellite to the earth would make control
and communication easier, he pointed
out. "The role of man in the operation
of a space observatory is likely to be
limited to occasional visits to replace
worn out parts or to change equipment
attached to the telescope."
The satellite observatory would con-
tain a variety of telescopes up to perhaps
100-inches in diameter as well as one or
more radio telescopes and photometers,
spectroscopes, image tubes and radio as-
tronomy receivers. These will provide
astronomers with new and much more
accurate data, Professor Goldberg point-
ed out, because they will be out of the
earth's atmosphere which obscures and
distorts light and blocks other informa-
tion-bearing radiation from stars, plan-
ets and galaxies.
Studies made from such a platform
(Continued from page 35)
would range over nearly the entire prov-
ince of astronomy. They would include:
1. Whether there is plant life on Mars
or Venus (and prepare the way for
later space vehicle approaches and
exploration which will produce "the
most significant revelations").
2. The Sun, "both because it controls
the environment in which we live
and because it allows us to exam-
ine the anatomy of a star in very
fine detail."
3. The history and evolution of the
universe.
4. The evolution and the chemical
compositions of stars.
The moon, however, would provide
some advantages a space platform can-
not, Professor Goldberg said. The moon
could shield men from lethal solar radi-
ation, provide a rigid foundation for
radio astronomy antennas as much as a
few miles long, and block from radio
astronomy antennas man-made radio in-
terference coming from the earth by

As an Engineer, I will participate in none but honest enterprise. To
him that has engaged my services, as employer or client, I will give the ut-
most of performance and fidelity.
When needed, my skill and knowledge shall be given without reser-
vation for the public good. From special capacity springs the obligation to
use it well in the service of humanity; and I accept the challenge that this
implies.
Jealous of the high repute of my calling, I will strive to protect the
interests and the good name of any engineer that I know to be deserving;
but I will not shrink, should duty dictate from disclosing the truth regard-
ing anyone that, by unscrupulous act, has shown himself worthy of the
profession.
Since the Age of Stone, human progress has been conditioned by the
genius of my profesional forbears. By them have been rendered usable to
mankind Nature's vast resources of material and energy. By them have
been visualized and turned to practical account the principles of science and
the revelations of technology. Except for this heritage of accumulated ex-
perience, my efforts would be feeble. I dedicate myself to the dissemina-
tion of engineering profession in all its arts and traditions.
To my fellows I pledge, in the same full measure I ask of them, in-
tegrity and fair dealing, tolerance, and respect, and devotion to the stan-
dards and the dignity of our profession; with the consciousness, always,
that our special expertness carries with it the obligation to serve humanity
with complete sincerity.

to Mars. Both Earth time and Mars time are shown on the dials.
Space Navigation
ANN ARBOR—Man can find his way
to Mars or Venus, once he has the
equipment to make the trip.
"Means of solving all technical prob-
lems associated with interplanetary navi-
gation are available today if one is will-
ing to pay a price for them," concludes
a report on a study for the Air Force
completed recently by The University of
Michigan's Willow Run Laboratories
(WRL).
The study considered basic problems
and points out areas for future research.
Several methods of navigation were
examined and the conclusion was that
problems of navigation can be solved
now if 'trade-off" problems of selecting
equipment can be resolved. Then only
development of hardware would stand
in the way of man's reaching at least
the nearer planets.
It was assumed that a chemically-pro-
pelled space ship with multi-member
crew would be used.
In space travel, the report notes, the
shortest distance between two points will
not be a straight line. In fact, the straight
line path won't exist in space travel, and

choose careers
with Du Pont
Every year, several hundred new college graduates choose
DuPont. Many Masters and Ph.D.'s do, too.
From time to time we learn from recent graduates the
factors which led to their decision to join this company. They
cite more than half a dozen reasons. Here are four of the most
important:
OPPORTUNITY AND RECOGNITION
They were aware that college-trained beginners
go right to work with men who have achieved.
For example, research chemists work with individuals who've
done successful research. New engineers work with pros, some of
whom have designed new plants, or devised new manufacturing
methods, or distinguished themselves in some other way. And other
graduates, with B.A. or M.B.A. degrees, go to work with leaders
who've been successful in Sales or Advertising or Treasurer's, or
another of Du Pont's many departments.
They had been told —and rightly —that DuPont rewards indi-
vidual achievement. And they were eager to start achieving.
RESEARCH CREATES NEW PRODUCTS;
NEW PRODUCTS CREATE NEW JOBS
Men like working for a company that believes in
research, enough to invest in it...$90 million a year!
The fact is that important new products come from DuPont
laboratories and go to DuPont manufacturing plants with frequency.
Here are but a few since World War II: "Orion"* acrylic fiber
followed nylon (soon after the war). Then came "Dacron"* poly-
ester fiber, "Mylar"* polyester film, "Lucite"* acrylic lacquer and
"Delrin"* acetal resin.
These, and many others, have created thousands of new jobs... in
research, manufacturing, sales ... in fact, in all Du Pont departments.
DUPONT BACKS EMPLOYEES WITH HUGE INVESTMENT
New graduates feel that every facility is provided for doing the job well.
Last year, Du Pont's operating investment per employee was
$32,500. Since much of this was expended to provide the most
modern and best of equipment to work with, it further increases
the chance for individual achievement.
This applies to men in lab, plant and office.
DUPONT PROVIDES STEADY EMPLOYMENT
Career seekers appreciate the importance of security.
Today, the average annual turnover rate at DuPont is less
than one-third that of industry nationally.
• • •
These, and many other reasons, draw new talent to Du Pont each year.
Prospective graduates, M.S.'s and Ph.D.'s interested in learning
more about job opportunities at Du Pont are urged to see their Place-
ment Counselor, or to write direct to E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.
(Inc.). They should tell us the course they are majoring in so we can
send literature that is most appropriate.

space navigation will involve finding
and following the best curve to other
planets.
Because early phases of the flight
would be worked out by earth-bound
computers, the WRL report concentrates
on extra-planetary phases. Complexity
of the problem makes selection of a
single technique nearly impossible, it
points out.
Earlier investigations had centered
around a pre-computed elliptical orbit to
Mars. But using pre-computed orbits,
the report states, requires extreme accur-
acy, and knowing just where you are and
where you should be at any given time
on the trip. Presently, however, finding
celestial distances and one's velocity in
space would not be easy.
The best presently-known way to de-
termine speed is to find where you were,
where you are, and how long it took to
go between the two points. Currently,
optical angle-measuring techniques—sim-
ilar to those used by Columbus—com-
bined with extremely accurate clocks
(Continued from page 46)
seem best for this. But such equipment
is heavy and would boost fuel require-
ments.
A subsequent study by the Willow
Run group suggests alternative methods
which would require far less equipment
and simplify the navigator's job.
One alternative assumes ionic propul-
sion would be used. Building an ionic
rocket is now close enough to feasibility
to warrant consideration, WRL scien-
tists believe.
An ion engine electronically expels
bits of molecules (ions) at higher speeds
than the chemical rocket can expel whole
molecules by heat-expansion alone. The
ionic engine can reach higher speeds in
space but doesn't produce enough thrust
for launching.
Ionic propulsion would give the navi-
gator continuous steering control.
With such control, "homing" tech-
niques—guiding the ship on a charac-
teristic of the target—are attractive and
worthy of further study.
Two examples of such techniques are
cited: 1) The ship would travel a line
formed by the sun and Mars, always
moving away from the sun, to eventually
reach Mars; 2) The navigator would
stay on a line formed by Mars and a
"reference" star far enough away so
lines from the star to any point on Mars'
orbit always seems parallel. Again, con-
tinuing away from the sun and maintain-
ing this bearing would eventually put
the ship at Mars.
In either case the "homing" would
eliminate the need to keep careful checks
of time, velocity, orbit, or position in
space for navigational purposes.
The Countermeasures Department at
WRL directed the project, assisted by
WRL's Special Projects Group and Com-
putation Department and the U-M De-
partments of Astronomy and Mathemat-
ics.

Modern board-lift forging hammer
By designing front-end spindles to be forged, automobile and truck
manufacturers practically eliminate danger of failure of these vital parts, even
under sudden turning stress that can reach thousands of foot-pounds.
Start your designs by planning to use forgings everywhere there's a high
degree of stress, vibration, shock, or wear. Forged parts withstand them all better
than parts made by other fabrication methods. And forgings have no hidden
voids to be uncovered after costly machining hours have been invested
. . . the hammer blows or high pressures of the forging process
compact the belter forging metal, make it even better.
Write for literature on the design, specification,
and procurement of forgings.

A young man in a cocktail lounge
saw a blonde sitting at a table nearby
and was struck by her extraordinary
beauty. In fact, he decided he had never
seen such a gorgeous girl. And, almost
before he realized what he was doing,
he got up, went over to her and asked
her to dance. She consented and soon
he found she was not only beautiful,
but she danced divinely.
When the music stopped, he sat with
her and they had a drink. To his amaze-

himself, "here at last is THE woman."
Unable to contain himself any longer,
he asked if he might take her home. She

preferably...
a big FISH in the right-sized STREAM
We've been told frequently that engineering graduates arc attracted to a
company our size because of an honest and understandable desire to be
"a big fish in a little pond". Perhaps others prefer to think of the future as
the challenge of "swimming up-stream".
We believe that Sikorsky Aircraft is actually the "right-sized stream" for
young engineers who would enjoy diversified, small-group activities, as
well as stature opportunities in a field that is not limited nor professionally
confining. Sikorsky Aircraft is the company which pioneered the modern
helicopter; and our field today is recognized as one of the broadest and most
challenging in the entire aircraft industry.
Because of this, we can offer stimulating experiences in an ideal environ-
ment. Work associations could include joining an electronic team of twenty
to thirty associates—or—working with a highly selective group of four or
five on interesting problems of radiation, instrumentation, auto pilotage,
automatic stabilization, etc.
And what of your future?
That, of course, involves your own potential for growth. As
a far-sighted company, we're more than willing to help you
meet the challenge of "going up-stream"!

At a party recently a professor felt
that he had partaken rather freely of the
champagne and was determined to be
careful and avoid any of the usual signs
of tipsiness.
When they arose from the table, some-
one suggested that the hostess exhibit
the latest addition to her family. She
agreed and presently a nurse appeared
with a dainty pink basket containing
twins.
The prof was nearest, and, mindful of
his determination he steadied and said, as
he gazed into the basket: "What a beau-
tiful baby."
A wealthy Detroiter, returning from
his grand tour abroad, was asked by an
artistic friend whether he had managed
to pick up a Van Gogh or Picasso abroad.
"Naw," said the traveler. "They're all

got three Buicks anyway."
An aging farmer who had little pa-
tience with prankish children finally suc-
cumbed to the wiles of his young and
attractive housekeeper, the mother of a
seven-year-old brat. Soon after the mar-
riage she took off for the big city to do
some personal shopping. Upon her return
some days later she asked her son how he
got along with his new father.
"Just fine," exclaimed the boy.
"Every morning he took me out on
the lake in a rowboat and let me swim
back."
"Heavens—isn't that a long distance
for you to swim?" his mother gasped.
"Oh, I made it all right," said the
boy.
During a grouse hunt one sportsman

sorry—have a shot at mine over there."

"That's four cents?" asked the Scots-
man.
"Do you have any security?" asked
the banker.
"I do. Fifty thousand dollars in U.S.
bonds."
The bank accepted the bonds and gave
him the dollar. At the end of a year,
the Scotsman came back with a dollar
and four cents to clear up his debt and
asked for his fifty thousand in bonds
back.
As he returned the bonds, the banker
asked, "I don't want to be personal, but
if you have all these bonds, why did you
have to borrow a dollar?"
"Well," replied the Scotsman, "do
you know any other way I can get a

growth that can be
important to your future career
Did you know that the chemical industry has grown at a rate of about
10% per year since 1929, as compared with only 3% for the econ-
omy as a whole? It's a fact! And there's every reason to believe that
this favorable growth rate will continue.
For the graduating chemist or chemical engineer, this spells oppor-
tunity. Opportunity to grow with a growing industry.
Allied Chemical, for example, now produces more than 3,000 diver-
sified chemicals at over 100 plants throughout the country. Many of
these products are basic—used in volume by almost every industry.
Allied is at the heart of the nation's economy and looks forward
to continued growth and stability.

their Earth-to-Mars timetable, according
to a University of Michigan report to
the Air Force on interplanetary naviga-
tion.
The two types of time are: "Reference
to astronomical time for example, the
time of day and reference to some event
during the course of the flight," which
may take more than a year.
Space pilots, accordingly, will need
an extremely accurate, compact, and de-
pendable timepiece, calibrated in micro-
seconds for computations, but also able
to tell the human crew the passage of
hours, days, months.
For the astronauts will have much
time on their hands, out in weightless
space.
During the mid-course phase," the re-
port suggests, "days or even weeks may
be available for navigational computa-
tion." When the first manned space ship
nears Mars, however, split-second deci-
sions will have to be made to orbit in
for a safe landing.
Pioneer astronauts, at least, won't have
to worry about the "Einstein effect." The
(Continued from page 48)
father of relativity predicted that clocks
on interstellar space ships would "slow
down," and that passengers would age
less than if they spent the equivalent time
on earth.
No chance of this on the first Mars
launch. A clock would have to zoom
through space close to the speed of light,
186,000 miles a second, to slow down
significantly, according to Einstein. On
the way to Mars, the crew will travel
sedately at only about 20 miles a second.
Cell Research
ANN ARBOR — Living cells, like
computers, have built-in feedback" mech-
anisms which help control their activi-
ties, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist de-
clared March 8 at The University of
Michigan.
Sir Hans Krebs of Oxford University,
England, addressed an overflow audience
of 600 students and faculty at an Insti-
tute of Science and Technology lecture.
Recent research suggest that cellular
growth and destruction are cyclical in
nature, he declared. The steps involved
in synthesis of living matter are basic-
ally different from those involved in its
decomposition. Previously, the two were
regarded as a single, reversible process.
For example, he noted most cells have
the ability to make far more of their
constituent parts than they actually need.
If a particular component is in short
supply, the cell will go "all out" to try
and produce it. But once its needs are
satisfied, the cell will tend to restrict
further activity of the same sort.
Like the driver of a car, the cell will
use its metabolic machinery only when
it needs to, keeping lots of "power" in
reserve. In this way, the cell works to
maintain a fairly stable balance in its
activity, much as a driver might do in
maintaining a steady rate of speed over
a hilly highway.
In both the cell and man, he conclud-
ed, hormones and the central nervous
system play important parts in helping
maintain overall balance in the rate of
metabolic activity in different tissues.

Take advantage of the
MECHANICAL
ADVANTAGE
The screw is a combination of two
mechanical principles: the lever,
and the inclined plane in helical
form. The leverage applied to the
nut combines with motion of the nut
around the bolt to exert tremendous
clamping force between the two.
One of the greatest design errors
today, in fact, is failure to realize
the mechanical advantages that
exist in standard nuts and bolts.
Smaller diameters and less costly
grades of fasteners tightened to
their full capacity will create far
stronger joints than those utilizing
bigger and stronger fasteners tight-
ened to only a fraction of their
capacity. Last year, one of our engi-
neers showed a manufacturer how
he could save $97,000 a year simply
by using all the mechanical advan-
tages of a less expensive grade.
When you graduate, make sure
you consider the mechanical advan-
tages that RB&amp;W fasteners provide.
And make sure, too, that you con-
sider the career advantages RB&amp;W

summer vacation, plastered to the gills.
They stood in front of the house of one
of their number and called for the father.
"Will you please do us a favor?" said
one.
"What do you want?" asked the father.
"Will you please come out and pick
out Clyde so the rest of us can go home?"

An engineer of a large instrument
company was looking over drawings and
specifications for a new instrument which
had been ordered by one of the firm's
largest clients. Attached to the paper
were the coded instructions, "MILTDD-
41." Not being familiar with these des-
ignations, the engineer looked in his
technical journals, but was unable to
find them. Finally he placed a long-dis-
tance call to the customer.
"Would you mind telling me what
'MILTDD-41' means?" he asked .
"Sure, I'll tell you," the customer

said. "It means, 'Make it like the damned
drawing for once.'"
* * *
Then there was the Army wife whose
husband had been in the South Pacific
for three years. She started receiving
letters from him in which he told of the
beautiful South Sea Island belles, and
of their growing fascination for him.
Worried at this, she went to her phy-
sician for advice. "Well," said the doc-
tor, "There is a chemical that can be
introduced into a man's food to lessen
his natural emotions. Here's a prescrip-
tion; get some of this and put it into
some cookies or candy, then send it to
him and see what happens." The wife
got the chemical and, wishing to be
certain, put a triple dose of it into
some cookies, which she sent to her hus-
band. She didn't get another letter from
him for seven months. When a letter
finally arrived, she opened it hurriedly
with trembling fingers. The letter began:
"Dear Friend . . ."
* * *
An inmate of the lunatic asylum was
to be examined for dismissal. The first
question he was asked was: "What are
you going to do when you get out of
here?"
The inmate replied: "I'm going to
get me a slingshot and come back and
break every window in this place."
After another six months in the pad-
ded cell, he was again examined and
the same question was put to him.
"Well, I'm going to get a job," was
the reply.
"Fine," said the examiner, "And then
what?"
"Then I'm going to buy a big car."
"Good."
"And then I'm going to meet a beau-
tiful blonde."
"Then I'm going to take her out
driving on a lonely road."
"Yes."
"Then I'm going to grab her garter,
make a slingshot, and come back here
and break every window in this place."

Engineering Materials
The electron microscope (left) is used for investigations of the structure of materials, such
as asbestos (right). The knowledge of the structure of materials is important in understand-
ing their properties. These control the applications and design of materials. The most ad-
vanced mechanisms in use today are critically dependent on the microscopic structure of
materials. Improved utilization of present materials and the discovery of new ones will
permit breakthroughs in the fields of mechanisms, communications, space exploration, and
maximum utilization of energy.
The Engineering Materials curriculum of the niversity of Michigan is designed to train
students in fundamentals so that they may be among those who will be developing and
uilizing materials to meet the more exacting electrical, mechanical, thermal, and radiation
requirements of advanced engineering designs.

The most hopelessly futile attempts at controlling
student functions on the campus of the University of
Michigan by the same sort of universal democracy as is
used in managing the affairs of our national govern-
ment has finally instituted demands for a new deal. From
all sides of the campus the barbs have been levelled
rather justly on that utterly useless group of boy politicians
called the Student {Government) Council and agitation has
finally reached a serious enough vein to threaten the life
of this body. But the question is probably arising in many
serious students' thoughts as to whether the dropping of
the Student Council and the turning over of its few
meager functions to the Union will entirely solve the
problem. The real nature of the attack has not changed
much through the last several years and is actually not a
specific charge against any specific organization such as
the Student {Government) Council or Engineering Council
itself. The outcry is the wholly justified one against the
entire unwholesome setup of student politics. In past years,
its clear voice, raised above the muddled babblings of
so-called student leaders, has brought about a divorce of
the Union and the publication boards from the political
jamboree. But there is more to be done now before it is
stilled for good.
As one well known professor rather appropriately puts
it, "It has been interesting to be on the outside looking in
and watching the children playing about with the deceits
and treacheries of the really grown up political world.
But, frankly, it is more damaging to their later usefullness
as good citizens than anything we could allow them to do
for it destroys every bit of their respect for public office."
It is very soundly asserted that the most able men in the
country do not hold political office and would not con-
sider entering politics under present characteristics. And
it is just as true and much more easily proven that those
organizations and activities which are carried on under
student election principles have always been the weakest
and most mis-managed on the campus. A good cleanup
seems imperative, does it not?
Class elections are the great farce comedy of the fall
term. Whoever heard of a class organizing and doing
anything? It has become so bad that it's almost a sacrilege
to speak of such a thing. Class officers cost money to elect,
to keep, and to publicize enough to satisfy their vanities.
Dues are assessed to try and cover this but the wary stu-
dent has finally come to want something for his dollars
and never pays. So why in the world should we keep them?
Let's pull down the curtain on the last act and close the
comedy for keeps.
The Student {Government) Council, the Engineering
Council, and those few other committees and organizations
which are filled by student voting have long ago ceased to
accomplish enough to justify their further existences. It
has already been suggested that the few duties of the
Student {Government) Council could well be taken care of
by the Union by expanding its personnel somewhat and
this view should certainly be approved. The Union is
admirably suited to handle the routine duties of student
self government. Its members are all working for advance-
ment under merit system rules, are not connected with
political machinations in the least, and are thus likely to
be able, hard working, and conscientious. And it is just
as reasonable to suppose that a proper organization of this
committee would enable it to handle all the details of
student self-government now distributed among several
groups, rotting away under the politician's touch.
Politics on this campus with its resultant evils of
student over-organization and inefficiency must ultimately
go if the ideals of a successful student self-government
are to be realized. As long as student offices are to be
created solely for the satisfaction of personal vanities and
over-inflated egos and for the collection of as much graft
as is possible and are to be filled by the office juggling
childishness of psuedo politicians and B.M.O.C.'s in name
but not in deed, the disadvantages of student self-govern-
ment will far outweigh its advantages. We can only hope
that the agitation which has been lately aroused will
gather an increment so strong that it will ultimately banish
the whole machinery of student politics and cut down the
number of "ego" pages in the yearly Michiganensian.
Anyway its an idea worth backing.

Already engineers working with
nuclear power have learned that only
utmost purity of materials and metic-
ulous accuracy in manufacture can be
tolerated in a reactor. Steels for the
reactors and reactor vessels are checked
for make-up and molecular structure
with photomicrography and x-ray dif-

moderators flawless with radiography.
And stresses likely to occur are studied
in advance with photo-elastic stress
analysis.
In this new-day industry, as in any
field on which you set your sights,
photography plays a part in making a
better product, in producing it easier,
in selling it faster. It cuts costs and
saves time all along the line.
So, in whatever you plan to do, take
full advantage of all the ways photog-
raphy can help.
CAREERS WITH KODAK:
With photography and photographic proc-
esses becoming increasingly important in
the business and industry of tomorrow,
there are new and challenging opportunities
at Kodak in research, engineering, elec-
tronics, design, sales, and production.

Interview with
General Electric''s Byron A. Case
Manager—Employee Compensation Service
Your Salary
at General Electric
Several surveys indicate that salary is
not the primary contributor to job
satisfaction. Nevertheless, salary con-
siderations will certainly play a big
part in your evaluation of career op-
portunities. Perhaps an insight into the
salary policies of a large employer of
engineers like General Electric will
help you focus your personal salary
objectives.
Salary—a most individual and per-
sonal aspect of your job—is difficult to
discuss in general terms. While recog-
nizing this, Mr. Case has tried answering
as directly as possible some of your
questions concerning salary:
Q Mr. Case, what starting salary does
your company pay graduate engineers?
A Well, you know as well as I that
graduates' starting salaries are greatly
influenced by the current demand for
engineering talent. This demand es-
tablishes a range of "going rates" for
engineering graduates which is no doubt
widely known on your campus. Be-
cause General Electric seeks outstand-
ing men, G-E starting salaries for these
candidates lie in the upper part of the
range of "going rates." And within
General Electric's range of starting sal-
aries, each candidate's ability and
potential are carefully evaluated to de-
termine his individual starting salary.
Q How do you go about evaluating
my ability and potential value to your
company?
A We evaluate each individual in the
light of information available to us:
type of degree; demonstrated scholar-
ship; extra-curricular contributions; work
experience; and personal qualities as
appraised by interviewers and faculty
members. These considerations deter-
mine where within G.E.'s current sal-
ary range the engineer's starting salary
will be established.
Q When could I expect my first salary
increase from General Electric and how
much would it be?
A Whether a man is recruited for a
specific job or for one of the principal
training programs for engineers—the
Engineering and Science Program, the
Manufacturing Training Program, or
the Technical Marketing Program—his
individual performance and salary are
reviewed at least once a year.
For engineers one year out of col-
lege, our recent experience indicates a
first-year salary increase between 6 and
IS percent. This percentage spread re-
flects the individual's job performance
and his demonstrated capacity to do
more difficult work. So you see, salary
adjustments reflect individual perform-
ance even at the earliest stages of
professional development. And this
emphasis on performance increases
as experience and general competence
increase.
Q How much can I expect to be making
after five years with General Electric?
A As I just mentioned, ability has a
sharply increasing influence on your
salary, so you have a great deal of per-
sonal control over the answer to your
question.
It may be helpful to look at the cur-
rent salaries of all General Electric
technical-college graduates who re-
ceived their bachelor's degrees in 1954
(and now have five years' experience).
Their current median salary, reflect-
ing both merit and economic changes,
is about 70 percent above the 1954
median starting rate. Current salaries
for outstanding engineers from this
class are more than double the 1954
median starting rates and, in some
cases, are three or four times as great.
Q What kinds of benefit programs
does your company offer, Mr. Case?
A Since I must be brief, I shall merely
outline the many General Electric em-
ployee benefit programs. These include
a liberal pension plan, insurance plans,
an emergency aid plan, employee dis-
counts, and educational assistance pro-
grams.
The General Electric Insurance Plan
has been widely hailed as a "pace
setter" in American industry. In addi-
tion to helping employees and their
families meet ordinary medical expen-
ses, the Plan also affords protection
against the expenses of "catastrophic"
accidents and illnesses which can wipe
out personal savings and put a family
deeply in debt. Additional coverages in-
clude life insurance, accidental death
insurance, and maternity benefits.
Our newest plan is the Savings and
Security Program which permits em-
ployees to invest up to six percent of
their earnings in U.S. Savings Bonds
or in combinations of Bonds and Gen-
eral Electric stock. These savings are
supplemented by a Company Propor-
tionate Payment equal to 50 percent
of the employee's investment, subject
to a prescribed holding period.

ENGINEERS
A number of recent events—the emergence of several new
nations during the past year, the Congo crisis, the presidential
campaign—have focused the attention of the world on the devel-
oping countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America.
Out of this attention has come the realization by many people
that these emerging nations are almost wholely lacking in the
facilities, resources, and personnel to develop at more than a pitiful-
ly slow rate. The Congo is a good example of such a situation.
In this country of millions there are less than 100 trained citizens
to handle the administration of the government, law enforcement,
public health, and the schools. In this type of situation it is vir-
tually impossible to think about doctors, engineers, technicians,
lawyers, labor experts, and agricultural specialists. Our understand-
ing of the complexity of this problem is heightened immeasurably
when we contrast it with what has become known as "the American
way of life and standard of living."
Out of this concern, with the impetus of speeches by President
Kennedy and Chester Bowles here at the University, has come the
formation of a group of students at Michigan dedicated to the
purpose of urging the United States and/or the United Nations
to develop
large-scale programs {that) would send young, capable
teachers, doctors, engineers and the like to the developing
countries of the world that ask for our assistance.
It is because of the integral part that engineers would play in such
a program that we feel it is important to discuss this subject here.
It is not our intent to simply describe this movement, the Americans
Committed to World Responsibility, which the local group of stu-
dents started and are helping to establish on campuses across the
nation. What is more important is why such an organization exists,
what its goals are, and how these goals affect us as engineers.
First of all, we have discussed the situation that exists in these
developing countries. Many of them are living under what we
would term sixteenth and seventeenth century conditions. The prob-
lem is that we live in the twentieth century. From this we con-
clude that there should be no doubt in our minds that these people
need outside help, most of which must come from the United
States. We speak not from the materialistic standpoint that if we
don't the Communists will. We agree that this is important but
more important is our moral obligation as a prosperous, democratic
nation to help these developing nations in their formative years.
It is our obligation to help reduce the almost endless number of
years of growth before they will be able to stand, unaided, in the
brotherhood of nations.
For many years we, as a nation, have supported this type of
view. Now, however, we have a movement of students sweeping
across this campus and the nation who are willing to accept this
obligation as individuals, who are willing to contribute their talent
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


and ACWR
and lives for several years in order to make the world a better
place by serving in these needy nations, who are willing to sacri-
fice part of their lives for the cause of peace.
Today there is very little opportunity for the realization of
these goals. Support by President Kennedy of this movement, prin-
cipally in his speech suggesting a United States Peace Corp and in
conversations with the leaders of ACWR, indicates that within a few
months the opportunity to individually accept world responsibility
may be available. And this brings us to the final point—what does
this mean to us as engineers? In part we have already answered that
question. There should be no doubt that—along with doctors,
agricultural experts, public health personnel, teachers, and admin-
istrators—engineers are needed in these developing nations. The
final portion of the answer must come from each of us individually.
It may appear that the question is whether we can afford to
forego certain economic and professional advantages by participating
in such a program. However, we feel that the basic question which is
most important in the long run is: Is a temporary personal sacrifice
worth a personal contribution to a better world? Only we can decide
this issue ourselves. Only we as individuals can commit our-
selves to world responsibility.
If you feel that this idea, this movement, is important and are
interested in learning more about or lending your support to it, we
here at the Technic office would appreciate hearing from you.

Prior to recent S.G.C. elections, Hectorians—the fraternity
honorary—publicly supported several candidates for the Council.
This has been a standard procedure of Hectorians in recent years.
We are very pleased to see the group support Mary Wheeler,
president of the local NAACP. There is no doubt that Hectorians
based their selections solely on the individuals and their views on
the issues rather than on race, religion or sex. In our thinking this
action went a long way in changing the public image of the fra-
ternity system. We hope this indicates a changing attitude within
the fraternity system itself.
For several years a few of the local technical societies have been
sponsoring weekly noon luncheons followed by short but inter-
esting programs. Last spring another group, the ASME, adopted
this idea. We would like to see more societies do the same. After
attending several of these noon sessions we can say that the meal
was good, the speakers interesting, and it did not cut into study
time as evening sessions of these groups do.

individuals. Chemistry seems to draw a particular kind of
person. Whether he's a scientist or a salesman, an engineer
or a marketing man, when he chooses the chemical industry
for his career he singles himself out as an individual. This is
the kind of person who makes up the Dow organization. At
Dow, teamwork has its place, but it is recognized, too, that
most great ideas are born in the mind of an individual as he
thinks about the problem.

someone as "a dreamer and an idealist." But these are
exactly the qualities of all the men who seek to make some-
thing great out of something commonplace. When Herbert
H. Dow turned an insignificant brine well into a vast chem-
ical empire, he established the Dow philosophy that "every-

room for ideas than a chemical company. In the first place,
new chemicals, most of them never before existent at all,
are made at an astounding rate. If the chemical is made for
a specific job, then at least one application is known for it.
But many others are the result of pure research or are
by-products. These require ideas to put them to work, or to

A CASE FOR THEORY
"Ah, this could be a good course, but that guy doesn't
teach anything but theory! Why doesn't he give us something
practical, something that we can use?"
How many times have you heard this complaint as you
walked out of a classroom? How many times have you ut-
tered similar sentiments yourself? Possibly frequently. At any
rate, it's very likely that such words are not unfamiliar gripes
to you, unless you are one of the few engineers enrolled in a
curriculum where basic theory is the expected thing. Our so-
called "T-schedule" engineers have an ingrained reluctance
to consider anything not immediately useful or practical to
them as really worth their valuable time.
But why do so many instructors throw the graphs and the
handbooks out the window and resort to developing formulas
and stating hypotheses in the engineering classroom? Why
have special programs been developed which emphasize basic
fundamentals rather than the past and present applications
of these fundamentals? Is it possible that there is, indeed, a
sound, down-to-earth, practical reason why engineers should
have their noggins crammed full of "impractical" theory?
I believe so. Further, I believe that there are an overpow-
ering number of reasons why this is so. This issue of the
Technic is primarily devoted to a discussion of just a few of
these theories and their significance. Therefore, it is appro-
priate to "kick off" this issue with a brief discussion of why
these "hairy beasts" of engineering science can and should
be domesticated to become our "beasts of burden."
The first reason for studying theory is that it is interesting.
"Truth is stranger than fiction," and scientific theory is truth
in its most primoridal form. Theory is always more interest-
ing than the somewhat dry conclusions and applications that
can be amassed by "plugging in to it."
Perhaps it requires a little more mental effort to really
comprehend something that is a bit abstract. Possibly it is
more difficult to understand a theory than to memorize an
equation or to recall a faint. But, once understood, a theory
will fascinate the imagination to a degree that it will be
forgotten with difficulty.
Next, theory gives us an insight into realms that are often
far removed from the engineering conclusions that are drawn
from it. In this respect, a study of theory will make us some-

thing more than engineers. For example, a study of the
theory of extrophy-will lead us into some very interesting
pnilosophical ramifications that might never occur to us if
we understand entropy merely as the integral of d0 over T.
Further, theory will permit us to draw an infinite number
of conclusions instead of the finite number of conclusions
which we can have at our fingertips if we study only the con-
clusions. As a very simple example, knowing how to integrate
gives us a great deal more flexibility in performing mathe-
mat.cal operations than we will have if we restrict our inter-
est in the subject to the rote memorization of a table of
integrals.
Akin to this is the ever-increasing difficulty of carrying in
mind all the necessary facts for the solution of problems in
a given engineering field. A chemical engineer cannot prac-
tice successfully merely by stringing together a sequence of
reactions and other operations in his pilot plant. He must be
able to predict what will happen to various substances in the
presence of heat, reagents, catalysts, etc. This entails the
memorization of a basic list of properties of common sub-
stances, but also demands the ability to predict on the bash
of a sound theoretical background whether his present prob-
lem will also behave as experience might indicate.
This leads to the final, and perhaps most important, reason
for having a background in theory:' one can never make a
new contribution to science or engineering if he restricts his
thought and imagination to presently-held techniques and
concepts. In order to make advances that are not mere adap-
tations or rehashes of already-familiar techniques or problem-
solutions, it is necessary to resort to the basic natural laws
upon which engineering techniques are developed. (Devel-
opment of new engineering techniques must always be con-
sidered as an appropriate field for the engineer as well as the
pure scientist.) Indeed, it is often helpful to question the
truth of the theory itself, and to overturn an inadequate
theory in favor of one containing a greater degree of truth.
I his is the scientific method; increasingly it is destined to
become the engineering method. But how can one overturn
a theory if one knows it not?
Let's have a little less griping if the Prof, wants to teach
the fundamentals of his discipline rather than the formulae
and data that can always be gleaned from a handbook!


SIGNIFICANCE
ENTROPY?
Entropy's mysteries are brushed away in this
broad discussion of a much - misunderstood,
often-misused term.
by PROF. GORDEN J. VAN WYLEN
Entropy! For many students in intro-
ductory thermodynamics and physi-
cal chemistry—and even philosophy—
the term has a mysterious aspect. Even
though some facility may have been
gained in solving problems involving en-
tropy, a thorough and basic understand-
ing of entropy is often lacking. The true
university student, however, is anxious
to push beyond superficial knowledge
and gain an insight into the basis and
significance of entropy. The purpose of
this article is, within the limits of the
author, to aid such students in their
"pursuit of entropy" and to show its
relevance to many areas of life.
The concept of entropy is based on the
Second Law of Thermodynamics, the be-
ginnings of which were first set forth by
Carnot in 1824. In the following four
decades the Second Law was clarified,
from a classical point of view, by several
scientists, the leading contributors being
Kelvin and Clausius. It was the latter
who first introduced the term entropy.
Later the microscopic or statistical ap-
proach to the Second Law was developed,
primarily by Boltzmann, Gibbs, and Max-
well. Let us first, therefore, briefly con-
sider the Second Law of Thermody-
As in the case of all scientific laws,
the Second Law of Thermodynamics is
in essence a description or systematiza-
tion of observed facts. For purposes of
this paper let us consider the Second Law
as it applies to an isolated system. An iso-
lated system is a quantity of matter which
has no interactions or transfer of mass
or energy with the surroundings. For an
isolated system only certain changes of
state are possible. For example, suppose
the isolated system consists of a spinning
disc in a container. The disc might pos-
sibly retain its given angular velocity,
but in the long run we would expect it
to slow down. It certainly will not speed
up. Or consider a storage battery. The
"charge" in the battery will probably
decrease with time, or in the limit remain
constant, but certainly it will not increase
in "charge" while sitting on the shelf.
Every macroscopic process which we
know, be it heat transfer, chemical reac-
tion, mechanical motion, or other process,
has associated with it certain irreversibili-
ties. This means that if an isolated sys-
tem undergoes a process which has an ir-
reversibility associated with it, it can
never be restored to its former state, with-
out violation of its isolation. Even though
an ideal process, which is called a re-
versible process, can be visualized, it is
never achieved in practice. The best
conceivable process is a reversible one,
and in one sense the work of an engineer
is to approach as closely as possible to a
reversible process, consistent with eco-
nomic considerations.
In the examples cited above, the disc
continuing to rotate at constant angular
velocity would be a reversible process,
and the slowing down would be an irre-
versible process. Similarly, the decrease
in "charge" of the battery would be due
to irreversibilities, and the maintaining
of a constant charge would be a rever-
sible process (or perhaps more accurately,
no process at all). The Second Law of
Thermodynamics states that only rever-
sible or irreversible processes will occur
in an isolated system. There are many
conceivable processes which simply will
not occur, and this is stated by the Sec-
ond Law.
The term entropy is used to give quan-
titative expression to the Second Law.
The greater the irreversibility in a pro-
cess which the isolated system may expe-
rience, the greater its gain in entropy.
For a reversible process the change in
entropy of the isolated system is zero.
Thus the isolated system will undergo
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


entropy increases or, in the limit, remains
at its initial value. It cannot undergo a
change of state which would result in a
decrease in its entropy.
From a microscopic point of view the
Second Law can be thought of in terms
of a transition from less probable to more
probable states. Entropy can be conceived
of as the logarithm of the probability of
being in a given state. Thus if W2 repre-
sents the probability of the second state
(the more probable state) and Wt that of
the initial or less probable state, the in-
crease of entropy would be:
W2
S» - S» = log — .
Since W.2 &gt; W„ the increase in entropy
is positive as the system undergoes the
change from the less probable to the
more probable state. Two equally prob-
able states would have the same entropy.
Slightly more than fifty years ago
Nernst formulated his "New Heat The-
orem," which he subsequently referred
to as the Third Law of Thermodynamics.
Although this law was challenged for a
considerable period, it has won an estab-
lished place as a fundamental law of
science. This law asserts that for a sys-
tem in thermodynamic equilibrium at
the absolute zero of temperature, the
entropy of all components is less than all
other states. The entropy therefore is
assumed to be zero in this equilibrium
state at the absolute zero and absolute
entropies are measured relative to this
base. The two main methods used to
measure absolute entropy are the calori-
metric method and the spectroscopic
method. The former method involves
cooling the substance to less than 1°K
and carefully measuring the heat capacity
as a function of temperature. Professor
Edgar Westrum of the Chemistry Depart-
ment of The University of Michigan has
an excellent laboratory for this purpose.
The second method involves a determina-
tion of the fundamental frequence of vi-
bration, the moments of inertia, and the
symmetry number of a molecule from
spectroscopic data, and a calculation of
the absolute entropy from the formulae
of statistical mechanics. When thermo-
dynamics is applied to chemical reac-
tions, the absolute entropy plays an im-
portant role, particularly as regards chem-
ical equilibrium.
Let us now proceed to discuss the con-
sequences of the Second Law to a num-
ber of different areas.
1. First let us consider the relation be-
tween entropy and time. Entropy has been
called "time's arrow," for the direction
of time, as time goes from past to pres-
ent to future, is associated with an in-
crease of entropy. We are in effect on a
one way street. We might stop for awhile,
but every movement carries us in a cer-
tain direction—the direction of the in-
crease of entropy. The passing of time
is thus related to an increase of entropy.
If time could be reversed after an irre-
versible process takes place in an isolated
system, a decrease in entropy would re-
sult, and this we know to be impossible
on the basis of the Second Law. Thus,
time and the increase in entropy of a
closed system are inseparably linked.
2. The second thing to note is that the
Second Law does not tell us anything
about how fast the entropy will increase.
A container filled with oxygen and hy-
drogen might exist for a year with no
significant change of state and hence no
increase of entropy. Yet within a mo-
ment after a spark is introduced in the
mixture a tremendous increase in en-
tropy takes place. The Second Law gives
no information on the rate of increase of
entropy; this is determined by various
factors in the given situation. Thus a
catalyst may be used to promote the in-
crease of entropy. The freezing and pres-
ervation of foods are a sort of "negative
catalyst" which serves to slow down the
rate of increase of entropy.
3. The question naturally arises as re-
gards the consequences of the Second
Law as applied to the universe. Does
the Second Law apply to the universe?
Can the universe be considered as an
isolated system? If it does apply, how
did the universe get in the state of low
entropy and what is the future of the
universe?
First of all, we must be careful to note,
as stated previously, that a scientific law
does not come to us as a decree from a
supreme being, but simply represents a
systematization of observed results from
many experiments. As such it applies only
to the range of experimentation, and
cannot necessarily be extrapolated beyond
this. For example, classical mechanics
was a very well established theory, but
did not apply to fast particles. Relativity
was necessary to explain these phe-
nomena.
So the question arises, what is the
domain of applicability of the second
law? Basically it applies to an isolated
system. When we apply it to a non-iso-
lated system we do so by considering
both the non-isolated system and its sur-
roundings and this still implies an iso-
lated system. The earth is not an isolated
system, for it continually receives radia-
tion from the sun and through cosmic
rays, and energy is in turn radiated from
the earth. Every evidence would indicate
that the Second Law of Thermodynam-
ics could be applied to this process, but
no accurate measurements have been
made. But what about the universe as a
whole? Is it an isolated system or not?
Is it finite or not? Where are its boun-
daries and what are their nature? We
know it is expanding, but what are the
consequences of this as far as the Sec-
ond Law is concerned?
Obviously, we can give no conclusive
answers to these questions on the basis
of the Second Law. Personally, I have
come to the conclusion (primarily on the

OF RELATIVITY
The implications of the familiar e = mc2 equa-
tion are reviewed for the beginner, with a few
notes on the meaning of relativity in our every-
day activities.
By IRVING SALMEEN
I
One of the greatest physical theories
presented during the twentieth
century was the theory of relativity. Deal-
ing with the basic constitutes of the uni-
verse—mass, length, and time—the the-
ory accounts for various discrepancies of
Newtonian mechanics. The fundamen-
tals of relativity related, for the first time,
the basic entities of matter. Introduced
by Albert Einstein in 1905, it has had a
profound influence on physical and in-
tellectual advancement of man.
The basic ideas of relativity begin with
the concepts of Galilean or Newtonian
relativity. Essentially the Galilean prin-
ciple states: if the laws of mechanics are
valid in one coordinate system (a coor-
dinate system being simply a frame of
reference), then they are valid in any
other coordinate system moving uni-
formly relative to the first. If two coor-
dinate systems are moving non-uniformly
relative to each other, then the laws of
mechanics cannot be valid in both. Coor-
dinate systems in which the laws of me-
chanics are valid are called inertial
systems.
Relative Coordinate Systems
Consider the law of inertia: every
body remains in its state of rest or uni-
form motion in a straight line unless it
is acted on by an external force. Now
imagine an experimenter who believes
that the law of inertia can be proved or
disproved by actual experiment. He con-
ducts his tests in a windowless room with
no communication with the outside world.
His test consists of pushing small spheres
along a horizontal table attempting to
eliminate friction which acts as the out-
side force. He notices that as friction is
reduced the motion of the spheres be-
comes more uniform. Just as he is about
to proclaim the principle of inertia, a
practical joker installs some mechanism
which enables him to cause the entire
room to rotate quickly on an axis pass-
ing through the center of the room.
When the rotation begins the experi-
menter undergoes new and unexpected
experiences. The sphere which had been
moving uniformly tries to get as far
away from the center and as near the
walls of the room as possible. The ex-
perimenter feels a strange force pushing
him against the wall. He experiences the
same sensation as anyone in a train or
car traveling fast around a curve. All his
previous results go to pieces.
The physicist would have to discard,
with the law of inertia, all mechanical
laws. The law of inertia was his starting
point; if this is changed so are all his
further conclusions. An observer des-
tined to spend his whole life in the ro-
tating room and to perform all his exper-
iments there would have laws of mechan-
ics differing from ours. If, on the other
hand, he enters the room with a profound
knowledge of mechanics and a firm be-
lief in the principles of physics, his ex-
planation for the apparent breakdown
of mechanics would be the assumption
that the room rotates. By mechanical
experiments he could even ascertain how
it rotates.1
From this it is easy to see that the
description of physical events depends
upon the coordinate system. For the ex-
perimenter inside of the room, the room
was his coordinate system and all events
as he observed them had to be explained
in terms of his coordinate system. In his
system, the laws of mechanics were not
valid. On the other hand, an observer
walking into the room could explain per-
fectly well the strange behavior of the
objects in the room because relative to
his coordinate system the room was ro-
tating, which accounted for the different
behavior. The laws of mechanics are able
to explain the behavior induced by the
rotation, therefore it is apparent that
the laws of mechanics are valid in both
coordinate systems.
Michelson-Morley Experiment
The Galilean relativity principle is

shown to be valid for all inertial coordi-
nate systems moving relative to one an-
other, but the question arises whether or
not it is valid for nonmechanical sys-
tems. One example of such a non-me-
chanical system is the propagation of
light. For years the idea was held that
light waves were transmitted in a medium
called ether, but in 1881 Albert Michel-
son aided by Morley undertook an exper-
iment to determine the existence of ether.
The results of the experiment showed
two things: first that ether did not exist,
and second that the velocity of light was
constant and independent of any coordi-
nate system. Working from the results
of this experiment Einstein proceeded
to make some startling deductions.
Fallacy in the Addition of Velocities
Consider the mechanical law of addi-
tion of velocities. A train is moving uni-
formly at a velocity v relative to the
earth. At a point Q the train passes a
flasher. Now imagine an observer in the
train looking at the flasher. To the ob-
server the velocity of light should be
v + c as the train moves toward the flash-
er and v — c as the train moves away.
But the Michelson experiment showed
that the velocity of light should be sim-
ply c or 186,000 miles per second. At
this point one of two things had to be
wrong: either that c was not constant, or
that the addition of velocities was not
valid.
Here Einstein stepped in. It had been
proven that c was constant and the vel-
ocity addition was as fundamental as
2 + 2 = 4. Rather than attempting to say
that either was wrong, Einstein sought a
transformation equation that would re-
late the two systems and still satisfy the
conditions of light. Such equations had
been already developed by H. A. Lor-
entz and were known as the Lorentz
transformation equations. Consider again
the train moving uniformly down the
track.
This time the train is moving from a
point B to a point A. At point D, one
half way between A and B, is positioned
an observer, and at point E, on top of
the train, is a second observer. Each has
an arrangement of mirrors placed so that
he can observe a flash of light at points
A and B without moving his eyes. As the
train moves to the point where E and D
are opposite, lightning flashes at the pre-
cise same instant at A and B. To the
observer at D, the flashes will be simul-
taneous but to C they will not be, be-
cause the train is moving away from B,
hence the light has farther to go from
point B than from point A. If the train
could have a velocity equal to the speed
of light, then the light from B would
never reach E and E would only see one
flash. From this we can see that a simul-
taneous event depends on the coordinate
system. To one the flashes are simulta-
neous, to the other they are not. This il-
lustrates that one can not say "now"' and
assume it holds for all of the universe.
Some transformation must be made to
relate all systems in the universe.
The fallacy of the addition of veloci-
ties lies in the assumption that the dura-
tion of an event is independent of the
state of motion of the system of refer-
ence. But Einstein showed that to de-
scribe any phenomena of nature in con-
sistent terms for all systems, one must
regard time and velocity as variables.
The Lorentz transformations accomplish
this task.

MATHEMATICS
We all know that math can perform literal mir-
acles in solving problems, but exactly what
makes math work? What are its shortcomings,
and how can we use it more effectively?
by K. HENRY
Because we know something of num-
bers and their relationships to each
other and to the real world, our bridges
stay strung, our buildings stand straight,
and our electric lights stay lit. In short,
we have the best developed technology in
the history of the earth.
We also have the most highly devel-
oped mathematics yet known to mankind.
Our children in grade school do things
with numbers that would have astounded
a Doctor of Mathematics of the Roman
Empire and put his most complex com-
putations to shame.
Nearly every modern discovery of
science, nearly every manufactured prod-
uct, nearly every company in existence
uses some of the principles, discoveries,
and processes of mathematics.
I think, then, that you will grant that
there seems to be some power, some force
in mathematics that makes all this pos-
sible. What is the nature of it and how
did it come to exist?
Consider the power in a spinning
wheel. In free space, it has no power, no
control of force; it can do nothing. When
held to a car by friction, and held to the
road by gravity, it can propel or steer the
vehicle. When equipped with teeth and
attached to an arbor, it can saw and
shape matter. And so on, ad infinitum.
Basically, the intrinsic power in a spin-
ning wheel must be harnessed and direct-
ed in order to be usable.
The same is true of mathematics in a
very much wider and more general sense.
The basis of mathematics is that if the
statements A, B, C &amp; D are true of any-
thing then also H and I are true of that
thing. Thus mathematics considers state-
ments in their own right and their rela-
tions to each other whether or not they
are known to be true of anything. Since
often there are many things which satis-
fy a common set of axioms, and anything
found to be a consequence of the axioms
is equally applicable to all of them,
mathematics can often make the effort
of one job do the work of many. Thus,
people, potatoes, and protons can all be
counted with the same set of numbers.
Still, the power of mathematics is not
realized until some of these sets of ax-
ioms, some of these statements, are
found to be true of something.
The power is not there, or is not use-
ful (which is practically the same thing),
until mathematics is harnessed, tied to
the real world. At times, it seems that
the axioms in a particular set are "self-
evident." Euclid thought the axioms of
his geometry were self-evident and uni-
versally true. They weren't. Taking an
ideal plane in the physical world, we
know now that if one vertex of a tri-
angle with straight lines were in an in-
tense gravitational field, the interior an-
gles would not add up to 180 degrees.
Now it is true that for most measure-
ments, we wouldn't be off by more than
a millionth of one per cent or so, and
hence it wouldn't usually make much
difference that the conclusions from the
false set of assumptions weren't quite
true; however it does demonstrate that
you can't "go all the way" on unproved
axioms and expect to be right.
This is one of the reasons that the
Chinese (who did some beautiful work in
geometry, for instance) never developed
the physical sciences and the technology
that we have. They didn't harness their
discoveries, they didn't tie their axioms
down to the real world with experiment,
explanation, and more experiment. On
the other hand, it's obvious, I think, that
it is very difficult to get far merely by
experimenting. This is perhaps why the
social sciences lag behind the physical;
it seems that it is more difficult to find
a set of axioms that we can prove are

These stars provide the basis for measuring the
broad expanses of space.
by CHARLES MASSER
Six trillion miles, the distance traveled
by light in a one-year period. This
seems to be an endless distance, yet
it requires one hundred thousand years
for lght to cross our galaxy. Over
two million years is needed for light to
travel to Andromeda, our neighboring
galaxy, and six billion years is needed
to touch the furthest detected galaxy. One
can feel how insignificant man is on his
small world, Earth. But this smallness did
not inhibit man's imagination or his quest
for knowledge of the unknown universe.
The questions of the unknown began to
fall one by one. But man can be wrong
with his theories. One such theory ex-
plained the size of the universe. In this
theory the size of the universe was re-
lated to the brightness of certain stars
called "Cepheid Variables." However,
certain assumed properties of these stars
have, in the past decade, been proven
false.
First Measurements of Milky Way
The first attempt to measure our gal-
axy, the Milky Way, was made in 1906
by a Dutch astronomer by the name of
Jacobus Cornells Kapteyn. He and his
associates made a survey of our galaxy
and arrived at this theory. Since the
Milky Way, as seen from the Earth, ap-
pears to be uniformly distributed in a
small band around the Earth, our gal-
axy should be a lens-shaped object
23,000 light years in diameter and 6,000
light years thick at the center. He also
stated that our solar system was located
near the center of our galaxy due to the
uniform distribution of the Milky Way.
Discovery of "Cepheid Variables"
Soon a new approach in determining
the distance to stars was developed. The
use of a certain class of variable star,
(a star which varies in brightness) was
the key to the approach. At this time
it was known that variable stars were
caused by either a dim companion which
eclipses the brighter star or by repeated
small internal explosions. In the latter
case one of the first stars studied was
Delta Cephei in the constellation Ce-
pheus. It completes its cycle in a period
of 3 1/3 days. A period of two days is
needed from its dimmest to brightest
point. It then requires 3 1/3 days to fade
back to its original dim point.
A study of the spectrum of Delta Ce-
phei reveals it contracts and expands
during its pulsation in brightness. If
the star remained at the same tempera-
ture during this pulsation it could be
easily understood when it is at its bright-
est it would be at peak size and when it
is at its dimmest it would be at minimum
size. But there is a temperature change.
The star is hottest at peak brightness and
coolest at the dim point. However, peak
brightness and peak temperature do not
occur at peak size, but when it is expand-
ing and 1/2 the way towards peak size.
The dimmest point and coolest tempera-
ture come when the contraction is i/2 the
way towards minimum size.
This variable star, Delta Cephi, became
very important when astronomers real-
ized that many other variable stars stud-

label of "Cepheid variables" was placed
on this group of special stars. When the
astronomers searched the globular clus-
tered in our galaxy for cepheid variables
they were rewarded. Most of these varia-
bles had extremely short periods which
ranged from 1 y2 to 24 hours. These var-
iables were first called "cluster Cepheids;"
however, with the continued improve-
ment of astronomical equipment, many
short period variables were found out-
side of the globular clusters. The most
studied short period variable was a star
named RR Lyrae. Due to much misunder-
standing the name "cluster Cepheids"
was changed to "RR Lyrae Variables."
"Period-Luminosity Curve"
None of these studies seemed to have
any connection with the size of the
universe until 1912, when several dozen
Cepheid variables were found in the
small Magellanic Cloud by Miss Henri-
etta Leavitt. The small and large Magel-


lanic Clouds are visible as two foggy
patches which resemble detached rem-
nants of the Milky Way. They are only
visible in the Southern Hemisphere and
were first seen by Ferdinand Magellan
in 1520 on his voyage around the World.
In her studies Miss Leavitt found there
was a smooth relationship between the
brightness of these Cepheid variables and
their period of variation. The graph
which was formed using the data was
called the "period-luminosity curve". Us-
ing this curve and the data compiled on
the other Cepheid variables, astronomers
needed to know the exact distance to
only one Cepheid variable and the dis-
tances to all the others could be calcu-
lated on the graph.
Flickering Yardstick Found
The astronomers ran into a problem
here. The most accurate method to meas-
ure distance to a star was to measure its
parallax, the difference in direction of the
star as seen from a point on Earth six


Exposures of 6, 15, 37, and 94 minutes show an increase of one magnitude on each
succeeding exposure of the globular star cluster in Hercules.

months apart. However, this is only ac-
curate to 100 light years and the nearest
Cepheid variable, the North Star, is sev-
eral times further; therefore this method
proved useless. A long, arduous, complex
statistical analysis of medium-distant (not
globular) star clusters was forced on the
astronomers. When they determined the
distance to the cluster the distance to the
Cepheid variables in this dusted were
also determined.
A flickering yardstick was now held by
the astronomers. The Cepheid variables
would reveal their distance by their
brightness and their period of variation.
Further studies in 1918 by Harlow Shap-
ley verified the distance to several glob-
ular clusters. In his measurements he used
the RR Lyrae variables combined with the
period-luminosity curve of Miss Leavitts.
However, in his studies Mr. Shapley
found most of the globular clusters in
the part of the Milky Way which con-
tained the constellations of Sagittarius
and Scorpio. Why was this so? The an-
swer is that our solar system is not in the
center of our galaxy as we thought but
well out on one of the spiral arms. We
are still in the median plane of our gal-
axy because the Milky Way is evenly
split in the sky, but why does it have
the same brightness throughout the sky?
The answer is this. Near the outskirts of
our galaxy there are large amounts of
dust clouds. These dust clouds happen
to be between us and the center of our
galaxy, therefore completely obscuring
our view. Even with telescopes we can
see only the outskirt portions of our
galaxy. It is interesting to note that we
are in the center of the portion we can
see, and the size of that portion is not
far from Kapteyn's estimate. Kapteyn
assumed that the whole galaxy could be
seen from the Earth and that was his
error.
Final Model of Milky Way
The model of our galaxy which stil'
stands today is a lens-shaped affair that
is 100,000 light years across and 20,000
light years thick at the center falling off
to 3,000 light years at the extreme edge.
Our Sun is in a portion 30,000 light
years from the center.
The Cepheid variables in the Magel-
lanic Clouds were used to determine their
distance before the measurements of our
galaxy were completed. Accurate figures
show the small Magellanic Cloud to be
170,000 light years away while the large

Field assignments, plus theoretical lab work (above), keep Larry Carmody's engineering career stimulating.
If your future is engineering, put
yourself in Larry Carmody's shoes
Lawrence M. Carmody formed some firm con-
victions about his future engineering career
while a senior at Illinois Institute of Technology.
"I wanted to do significant work," he says,
"and have a variety of assignments that would
broaden me and keep my job interesting. I
wanted to make good use of my schooling and
express my own ideas. And, like anyone with
ambition, I wanted all the responsibility I could
handle and some genuine opportunities to keep
moving ahead."
Larry got his B.S.E.E. degree in June, 1955,
and went with Illinois Bell Telephone Company
in Chicago. He first worked in the Radio and
Special Services Group of the Transmission En-
gineering Division. There, in addition to re-
ceiving more advanced training, he:
• designed mobile radio systems
• did path studies of radio circuit routes
• worked on a special air-to-ground communi-
cations project for an airline
• did field work for a new, transistorized walkie-
talkie system developed by Bell Laboratories.
Today, Larry is planning and designing state-
wide long-distance facilities involving micro-
wave, carrier, and cable systems—projecting
circuit needs as far ahead as 20 years. His
recommendations often represent hundreds of
thousands of dollars in equipment and facilities.
"Telephone company engineering is 'tops' in
my book," says Larry.
Like to be in Larry's shoes? Many young college men are pursuing
careers just as rewarding with the Bell Telephone Companies.

new areas of interest enhance careers
for engineers and scientists at Hamilton Standard
HAMILTON STANDARD DIVISION of United
Aircraft Corporation has long been a
dynamic force in the aircraft equipment
field . . . with an unmatched record of
stability and accomplishment. Typical of
Hamilton Standard's achievements are en-
vironmental conditioning systems which
are standard equipment on such aircraft
as the 1400 mph Convair B-58 Hustler
Bomber. Fast moving advances in space
technology, however, pose new problems
... new challenges.
TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES Hamilton
Standard is conducting advanced research
and development on environmental control
problems for manned space vehicles. The
Moon Room pictured at right was specifi-
cally designed to assist engineers and
scientists in identifying and analyzing the
practical problems involved in CO2 re-
generation. However, within such sealed
experimental chambers studies can be con-
ducted to develop means of removing or
regenerating body heat, water vapor, nitro-
gen and other contaminants given off by
man in a space vehicle. Several possibilities
exist for effecting each phase of control in
an environmental control system. For ex-
ample, CO2 can be removed by the freeze-
out method, chemical absorption, physical
adsorption and diffusion or filtration of
molecules. Consideration of the space en-
velope and the weight of equipment must
be made. In the case of CO2 this involves
heat exchangers, regenerators, water sepa-
rators, blowers, valves and vents. Need for
secondary electrical power supplies to
operate equipment creates additional
problems.
OBVIOUSLY, UNDERTAKINGS of this nature
involve the utilization of a wide variety of
engineering and scientific fields of study
providing intellectual growth and career
satisfaction.

U. of M. Help Chile Rebuild
Chilean engineers, rebuilding after last
summer's earthquakes, will use jacks and
double foundations to correct unequal
settlement in some of their structures
and to facilitate repair of future earth-
quake damage of this type.
This idea, described by one Chilean as
"so simple and practical we wonder why
we didn't think of it," was suggested by
William S. Housel, a University of Mich-
igan professor of civil engineering. Pro-
fessor Housel returned in mid-September
from six weeks in Chile where he had
been invited to present a series of lec-
tures on soil mechanics and to visit con-
struction projects in southern Chile.
In the earthquakes there, buildings on
alluvial deposits or on man-made fills
suffered severe damage, he said, as these
soils settled unevenly and "bent" and
strained even well designed structures
(hotels, office buildings) built on them.
This settlement was an important factor
in the total earthquake damage. Much
rebuilding will have to be done on these
subsurface deposits of relatively loose
soils; hence his suggestion.
Professor Housel suggested laying a
concrete cap or "pad" on piles to serve
as a substructure for supporting "grade
beams" or piers on which the superstruc-
ture would rest. Jacks, or inserts for the
future installation of jacks, would be
built into the grade beam or piers. Un-
even settlement then could easily be cor-
rected — and the building made level
again—by adjusting the jacks. "About
the only objection to this idea is an in-
stinctive dislike for having a 'permanent'
structure on jacks," Professor Housel
noted.
Another major cause of damage to
lighter buildings, such as houses, was the
way these were set on basement walls.
"These were totally destroyed in one
area," he said. "In these cases, the
earthquakes' horizontal shock waves
moved the foundation walls out from
under and dropped the house into the
basement." Professor Housel described
the 53 engineers who attended his lec-
tures on soil mechanics as "very much
above average; extremely capable and
experienced engineers" who are greatly
interested in advanced soil mechanics.
In Chile, copper companies are ex-
panding and two large power companies
are constructing new plants, for which
foundations — and soil mechanics —■ are
very important, Professor Housel ex-
plained.
Most of the engineers attending the
lectures had been trained by teachers
from the European or eastern school of
soil mechanics. Consequently, there had
been some question whether Professor
Housel should be invited as a visiting
lecturer, because his views on many of
the important problems were quite dif-
ferent.
The professor stated, "This situation
presented a challenge and made the ex-
perience more satisfying when it turned
out that the Chilean engineers found the
Michigan brand of soil mechanics more
in keeping with their own experiences
with soil behavior." Professor Housel
has gained world-wide renown for his
advisory work on many civil engineering
projects around the globe. In Michigan,
he has advised about foundations for
such notable structures as the Mackinac
Bridge, and Cobo Hall and other Civic
Center buildings in Detroit.
Acceleration on Human Bones
An anatomist at The University of
Michigan Medical Center and engineers
from Wayne State University (Detroit)
are trying to find out how much accel-
eration a human can withstand before
his bones start to break. Their experi-
ments are expected to help astronauts
withstand the physical buffeting of re-
entry into the earth's atmosphere, and
promote safety for pilots being ejected
from high-speed jet planes.
Most previous acceleration studies have
been concerned with effects on blood
circulation, nervous system and general
human behavior. But Dr. F. Gaynor
Evans (Ph.D) at the U-M and Lawrence
M. Patrick and Herbert R. Lissner of
WSU are examining the effects of stren-
uous "G" forces on the intact human
skeleton.
In their continuing studies, the inves-
tigators hope to discover "the accelera-
tion threshhold for fractures"—the point
at which bones begin to crack under
the force of acceleration. In tests to
date, the researchers have exposed speci-
mens to accelerations up to 14 Gs (14
times the weight of gravity) without
causing fractures.
The test apparatus—built into an 8-
story elevator shaft at Wayne University
Medical School—will create forces up to
50 Gs. Results of progressive stages of
the investigation will be reported at medi-

Some of the more recent findings con-
cern the tensile and compressive strains
measured along the spinal column dur-
ing vertical acceleration, the effect of
restraint by seat belt and shoulder har-
ness, and the inadequacy of seat cushions
to absorb the shock of acceleration.
Awards
Professor Lewis N. Holland of the
Electrical Engineering Dept. was one of
five University of Michigan professors
to receive the "distinguished faculty
achievement" awards, consisting of a cer-
tificate and a $1,000 check.
'Assistant Professor Bruce Clarke of the
Mathematics Dept. was one of four as-
sistant professors to receive a "distin-
guished service award," consisting of a
certificate and a check for $500.
Ernest F. Mazur, Professor of Engi-
neering Mechanics, was awarded the
I960 James Laurie Prize by the Ameri-
can Society of Civil Engineers at its an-
nual convention in Boston. The prize,
which consists of a cash award and cer-
tificate, was won for an article entitled
"Strength of Very Slender Beams," pub-
lished in the society's Transactions.
U of M to Launch Balloons
University of Michigan engineers will
launch three 16-story high balloons this
fall in a project designed to improve in-
terpretation of photographic and infra-
red data received from Uncle Sam's
weather eye satellite, Tiros.
Supervised by Fred L. Bartman, tthe
project is supported by a $270,000 con-
tract from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA). A
team of nine U-M engineers, headed
by Bartman, have participated in the
first launching at Sioux Falls, S. D.
The project is part of a continuing pro-
gram of upper atmosphere research con-
ducted by the High Altitude Engineer-
ing Laboratory of the U-M Department
of Aeronautical and Astronautical Engi-
neering. This Laboratory, which is di-
rected by Leslie M. Jones has launched
more than 75 high altitude rockets to
the upper atmosphere. The current proj-
ect makes the first use of large balloons
by the group.
The unmanned, 159-foot balloon is
expected to reach a maximum altitude of
120,000 feet on its 14-hour flight. It
will carry a 250 pound payload of photo-
graphic and infrared equipment in a 55
inch diameter by 25 inch high, all mag-

nesium gondola built by Magline Inc.,
Pinconning, Mch. A specially equipped
bus, carrying telemetering devices, will
follow and receive data from the balloon
on the ground. The gondola will be para-
chuted back to earth approximately 250
miles west of the launching site. Sub-
sequent flights, scheduled for late Octo-
ber and January, may cover 1,000 miles
or more because of changes in the pre-
vailing wind patterns.
According to Bartman, there's a 95 per
cent probability the equipment will be
recovered without serious damage. Pho-
tographic and infra-red data on weather
conditions will be compared 1) to im-
prove interpretation of similar informa-
tion televised and telemetered from Tiros,
and 2) to seek improved methods of in-
strumenting the weather satellite. Because
the chances for safe recovery of their
equipment are high, balloons yield a
good deal more information at substan-
tially less expense than either rockets or
satellites.
On the first flight, infra-red radiome-
ters have been loaned to the U-M by the
Army. In subsequent launches, Tiros-type
radiometers will be used. The balloon
will be built, inflated, and set aloft by-
Raven Industries of Sioux Falls. Research
Fabrication, of Ypsilanti, Mch., built a
device on the bus to control azimuth and

of the receiving equipment was built in
U-M shops. Environmental tests were
conducted at Bendix Systems Divi-
sion, Ann Arbor. Engineers who have
developed the equipment used both in
the gondola and bus and who are trav-
eling to Sioux Falls with Bartman in-
clude: Paul Titus, Melvin Whybra, Rod-

Study on Air Turbulence
Nature's trick of making stars twinkle
is being duplicated here by University of
Michigan researchers studying air turbu-
lence over water and how it affects evap-
oration and wave motion. Ultimate re-
sults of the basic research could be highly
significant in the Great Lakes' water di-
version problem, for scientists have esti-
mated that the Lakes' evaporation loss
roughly equals the 30-inch annual rain-
fall in the Great Lakes basin.

Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a
favorable engineering atmosphere.
Back in 1925, when Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft was
designing and developing the first of its family of
history-making powerplants, an attitude was born—a
recognition that engineering excellence was the key
to success.
That attitude, that recognition of the prime impor-
tance of technical superiority is still predominant at
P&amp;WA today.
The field, of course, is broader now, the challenge
greater. No longer are the company's requirements
confined to graduates with degrees in mechanical
and aeronautical engineering. Pratt &amp; Whitney Air-
craft today is concerned with the development of
all forms of flight propulsion systems for the aero-
space medium—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and
other advanced types. Some are entirely new in
concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with
degrees in mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chem-
ical and nuclear engineering are needed, along
with those holding degrees in physics, chemistry
and metallurgy.
Specifically, what would you do?—your own engi-
neering talent provides the best answer. And Pratt
&amp; Whitney Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which
that talent can flourish.

I career at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, consult your col-
lege placement officer or write to Mr. R. P. Azinger,

At P&amp;WA's Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear Engine Lab-
oratory (CANEL) many technical talents are focused
on the development of nuclear propulsion systems for

addition to simple cutting, Plasmatron
rock cutting is said to be useful in shap-

eral can claim to have launched a real,
honest-to-goodness, genuine bird.
The bird, a stubborn, redheaded wood-

an electrical cable assembly high on the
umbilical mast at 17B. Itts perforations
of the styrofoam and aluminum tape cov-
ering the cable alarmed Douglas engi-
neers, so they tried to rout Mr. Wood-
pecker.
But the woodpecker ignored such tra-

and stones. Then the missilemen tried
more sophisticated techniques, such as
sounding a loud horn which they fas-
tened on the mast, or chilling the cable
with carbon dioxide.
Finally, in desperation, they put to-
gether a "countdown manual" and pre-

Begin Tests of
New Atomic Generator
The Martin Company has started test-
ing of a compact, lightweight generator
which can convert heat from a by-prod-
uct of nuclear reactors into electricity to
power advanced satellites and space
probes for at least a year. The conver-
sion system in the 125-watt unit uses no
moving parts.
The generator, which is being devel-
oped here by Martin's Nuclear Division
under contract to the U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission, is called SNAP 1-A (Sys-
tem for Nuclear Auxiliary Power).
SNAP 1-A is roughly egg-shaped, 34
inches long and 24 inches in diameter.
Most of its dull metal surface is dotted
with screw-headed caps marking the lo-
cation of 277 thermocouples. The com-
plete generator weighs 175 pounds.
The new system promises more power
than any energy unit launched into space
so far either by the U.S. or the Soviet
Union. Some systems have combined solar
cells with chemical batteries to build up
to such wattage levels periodically, but
these cannot operate continuously at high
power.
Engineers point out that SNAP 1-A,
unlike solar cells, would not be affected
by the impact of micrometeorites in space.
Operating independent of the sun, the
nuclear unit would have the additional
advantage of being able to produce pow-
er while in the shadow of the earth. The
absence of moving parts in the conver-
sion system greatly reduces the chances
of any malfunction.

This cutaway drawing shows the inner components of SNAP 1-A. The new atomic
generator is now undergoing preliminary tests.
The fuel capsule for SNAP 1-A, which
will not be inserted until electrical and
environmental tests of the rest of the
system are complete, will be located at
the very center of the generator, support-
ed by light metal tubing. The capsule
will contain tightly-sealed pellets of a
radioactive material called Cerium-144,
which decays spontaneously, producing
heat in the metal around it.
As the inner ends of the thermoelec-
tric elements are heated, the outside ends
always remain somewhat cooler, so that
the difference in temperature produces a
small electric current in each pair. These
thermocouples are connected in series to
add up to 125 watts at 28 volts. Tests
being conducted now use an electrical
heater to simulate the fuel.
Cerium-144 is a normal by-product of
the fission process in all nuclear reactors.
The material which ultimately will power
SNAP 1-A is being separated from other
fission products at the Oak Ridge Na-
tional Laboratory of the AEC and will be
supplied to Martin in sealed form early
next year for use in the ground test unit.
As the radioisotope decays, the amount
of heat it produces will gradually de-
crease. For this reason, SNAP 1-A has
been built with a temperature-sensitive
shutter, which will let some of the heat
leak out at the beginning of operation
but will gradually clamp shut. Thus the
electrical output will remain constant at
125 watts for a full year and then will
taper off.
A solar cell system with the same con-
stant output might be comparable to
SNAP 1-A in weight, but would be much
bulkier unless a complex mechanical de-
vice were used to keep the cells pointed
toward the sun. Unoriented cells would
have to cover an area of more than 100
square feet.
Extensive and conclusive tests have
been carried out under contract to the
AEC to assure that the radioisotope fuel
of SNAP 1-A would not be released if a
satellite-carrying rocket exploded on the
launch pad or failed to reach orbital
velocity. Once in orbit, the fuel capsule
is designed to burn up completely upon
reentry into the atmosphere.
During ground-handling operations
before launch, the hollow interior of
SNAP 1-A can be filled with liquid mer-
cury, which acts as a shield for its radia-
tion. This could be drained, moments
before lift-off, to reduce the weight of the
payload.

This steel plant consumes l/400th of the
electric power generated in the United States
Surprising? Not if you realize that steelmaking requires
a tremendous amount of electric power.
It takes about 20,000 electric motors to drive the
rolling mills and other equipment at our Sparrows Point
Plant, near Baltimore, the nation's largest steelmaking
plant. Here, at our own steam-electric generating station,
we produce enough power for a city of 250,000.
It goes without saying that we need the services of
electrical engineers to design, construct, and maintain

the vast and complicated array of electrical equipment
at our many plants and facilities.

Gravity conditions our thinking on ad-

The B. F. Goodrich Company has achieved the vulcanization of a tire by nuclear
radiation. The tire was revolved over fuel elements on the floor
of this 17 foot deep canal.
x = horizontal distance relative to the
stationary system
v = velocity of the moving system rela-
tive to the stationary system
y' = height relative to the moving system
y = height relative to the stationary sys-
tem
z' = breadth relative to the moving sys-
tem
z = breadth relative to the stationary sys-
tem
r' = time relative to the moving system
t= time relative to the stationary system.
From this it is easy to see that when v is
small relative to c, the values will be
comparatively unchanged, but as v ap-
proaches c the equations are radically
changed.
These equations are remarkable be-
cause they indicate that space and time
are not independent entities but are re-
lated; time as measured by an observer
in one system is different from that meas-
ured by an observer in another system
which is moving relative to the 6rst.
With appropriate calculations, Einstein
showed that as velocity increases the
length of an object shortens in the direc-
tion of the motion, clocks slow down,
and mass increases. As the velocity in-
creases and approaches c, the length of an
object becomes shorter until at v = c,
the object shrinks away to nothing and
time stops. This being the case, it is easy
to see that the velocity of light is the
limiting velocity of the universe.
Mass vs. Velocity
One of the most important deductions
of the relativity theory is the relationship
between mass and velocity. This result
follows from the requirement that the
laws of conservation of mass and mo-
mentum must hold for a system of par-
ticles in either of two reference systems
moving at a constant velocity relative
to each other. The mass of a particle mov-
ing with a velocity v relative to a given
reference system is given by
('
)
where m0 is the rest mass of the particle.
i.e. the mass that corresponds to a zero
velocity in the given reference system. Bv

famous equation was derived:
E = mc2
Most of the previous deductions were
results of the special theory of relativity.
In formulating the special theory Ein-
stein adopted two basic postulates. First,
the laws of physical phenomena are the
same when stated in terms of either of
two reference systems at a constant veloc-
ity relative to each other. Second, the
velocity of light is the same for all ob-
servers, and is independent of the rela-
tive velocities of the source of light and
the observer. The term special refers to
the restriction in the first postulate to
reference systems moving at a constant
velocity relative to each other. Not until
1916 did Einstein successfully show that
physical laws can be expressed in a form
that is valid for any choice of space-time
coordinates. This general expression is
what is known as the general theory of
relativity.
General Relativity
The extension of special relativity to
the realms of the universe brought about
some rather perplexing concepts. One
of these concepts was that the universe
is a four dimensional continuum consist-
ing of length, breadth, height and time.
The basic premise of the general theory
was that laws of nature are the same for
all systems regardless of their state of
motion. From this general concept, a
new theory of gravity was formulated.
It stated that bodies do not attract each
other as one ordinarily thinks of attrac-
tion, instead gravity is a segment or form
of inertia. Einstein described it as a field
and that gravitational attraction was the
paths bodies followed in the field. The
so-called force of attraction is simply
due to their motion through the space-
time continuum.
Recall the equation E = mc- and the
following deductions. Light is energy,
energy has mass according to the above
equation, mass is affected by the laws of
the gravitational field, therefore light
will be attracted by the laws of gravita-
tion. Using this result, Einstein postu-
lated a shape of the universe. Prior to
Einstein the universe was pictured as an
island of matter afloat in an infinite sea
of space. However, Newton's Taws did
not permit an infinite universe contain-
ing uniform distribution of matter be-
cause then the sum of gravitational
forces of all the masses stretching to in-
finity would be infinite, hence the uni-
verse would be a glowing mass. To fur-
ther disprove the infinite matter postu-
late, observations showed that the uni-
verse gets sparser as one gets farther
out.
The difficulty here arose from the as-
sumption that Euclidian geometry was
valid. Einstein, however, stated that the
universe was non-Euclidian and hence
finite. In the Einstein universe there are
no straight lines, only circles. In this
sense the universe can be likened to a
sphere with unbound reaches. According
to the laws of gravitational fields each
body in the universe distorts the space-
time continuum. The greater the con-
centration, the greater the distortion.
Hence the whole effect is a curvature of
the space-time continuum.
A Finite Age to the Universe
At the time of the theory, physicists
thought that the universe was in ran-
dom motion. Later observations with re-
fined instruments showed that at the
present time the universe is in a state of
expansion, and the closer systems arc-
moving away from the earth slower than
those farther away. Since every system is
moving away from every other system,
they must have at one time been together
in order to expand. This may indicate
that the universe, as we know it, had a
beginning, according to calculations based
on the rate of expansion, about 6 bil-
lion years ago. One cannot be sure
whether or not the universe actually had
a beginning, but if one combines the
second law of thermodynamics with the
fact that the universe is expanding, it is
a fairly strong indication that the uni-
verse did have a beginning. All present
observations show that energy is dissipat-
ing. The second law of thermodynamics
shows that this dissipation is irreversible
and must reach maximum entropy. If
this is the case, then the universe must
have started at some point when every-
thing was energy and will end when it
has all dissipated.
If somehow the second law of thermo-
dynamics were not valid and the pro-
cesses of nature were reversible, then it
is conceivable that the universe is now
in a phase of oscillation. In other words,
the universe oscillates between two states
of maximum and minimum energy. To
make this possible, the process of dissi-
pation must be reversible and at some
point the energy must congeal, contract,
and expand, the present phase being the
expansion state. If the latter is true, then
the universe in terms of matter and en-
ergy is infinitely old.
The Role of Relativity
The special theory of relativity has
been indispensable to the development of
atomic and nuclear physics. Nothing ex-
emplifies the validity of the theory more
than the advent of the Nuclear Age.
The general theory has done much to
explain how the universe behaves and
has brought unity to many scattered con-
cepts. When the theory was first pre-
sented it was held in utter contempt by
the majority of physicists, but refine-
ments in measurements and experimental
methods soon showed that the theory
was sound. Not only does the theory be-
come useful as a tool for investigation,
but it points out an important fact: theory
is the basis for practicability. Without
theory few phenomena could be ex-
plained. Relativity is one of the best
examples and one of the strongest cases
for theory.

cloud is 150,000 light years away. Since
these two clouds are small, relative to
our galaxy, and relatively close in dis-
tance, they could be termed "satellite
galaxies" of ours.
Other Galaxies Discovered
It was in the 1920's before anyone
looked beyond the Magellanic Clouds for
other galaxies. On a clear moonless night
a hazy patch about half the size of the
Moon could be seen in the constellation
Andromeda. It was called the Andro-
meda Nebula; the word nebula coming
from the Greek word for cloud. A point
of misunderstanding should be cleared up
here. There were several nebulae discov-
ered in our galaxy. However, these nebu-
lae were formed by highly luminous
gaseous clouds which were created by
extremely hot stars. The Orion Nebula
is an excellent example of this. The An-
dromeda Nebula, however, was not
formed from hot stars. If one had the
proper magnification this nebula could
possibly be broken into many far dis-
tant stars. This was done in 1924 by
Edwin Powell Hubble. He used the 100-
inch telescope at Mount Wilson to take
several photographs which showed the
Andromeda Nebula broken down into
fields of fine stars. He also found Ce-
pheid variables in the outskirts of the
nebula, and he used them to calculate
their distance. For the next thirty years
the figure of 750,000 light years stood as
the distance to the Andromeda Nebula.
Hubble also announced to the World
that many other nebulae were even
beyond the Andromeda Nebula. The uni-
verse which was a mere 100,000 light
years in diameter had expanded to hun-
dreds of millions of light years. How-
ever, the astronomers still had a few
questions to answer. First, Why did the
other galaxies that were measured seem
to be considerably smaller than our
Milky Way? Second, The Andromeda
Nebula also had small globular clusters
just as the Milky Way had, but they
were much smaller than ours. Why?
Third, since the universe was known to
be expanding, a starting point could be
calculated. The universe had expanded
for only two billion years, but geologists

What Significance Entropy?
(Continued from page 16)
basis of Scripture) that there is a God
who created and maintains the universe.
This might mean either one or both of
two things as regards the Second Law.
The universe could have been created
in such a state that it has a capacity for
a great increase of entropy, and the nat-
ural processes which have been taking
place for millions of years have occurred
with an attendant increase in entropy. Or
perhaps God is still active in this uni-
verse in the sense of a continued creation
(as suggested by Hoyle in a non-theistic
framework) or in another process which
offsets the continued increase in entropy
which we observe.
One point should be made clear. The
Second Law does not constitute a proof
for the existence of God, nor does it
seem that such proofs are possible. Nat-
ural phenomena, such as the Second Law,
are however legitimate evidence which,
along with many other factors, make the
presupposition that there is a God, rea-
sonable and consistent with empirical
data. It does not appear inconsistent with
any observed phenomena.
4. The relation of the Second Law to life
is an intensely interesting subject. First
of all we note that we do not live as
isolated beings, for we receive food and
oxygen and give off various waste prod-
ucts. In fact, our very life depends on
receiving food and air, because isolation
can mean only one thing, namely death.
From another point of view every living
organism has the sentence of death in
itself, and death is staved off only by
avoiding isolation and receiving food
and air. It is in some ways, like the
oxygen-hydrogen mixture, where the in-
crease in entropy can be avoided by the
absence of a spark.
This leads to another interesting ques-
tion, namely, what is the entropy of a
living organism? Is the entropy of a liv-
ing organism less than the entropy of
this organism immediately after death?
Does the entropy of a living being in-
crease with age? Unfortunately we can
only raise these questions, for we know
of no way of either measuring or defin-
ing the entropy of a living organism.
Perhaps some "life principle" must be
discovered before these answer can be
given. Could it be that this life principle
can be explained only in the context of
the Creator?
42
5. The final point I would make is
that the entropy concept is being applied
to many areas. Perhaps the most signifi-
cant of these is in communication theory.
This concept concerns the communication
of a message. Perfect communication
would correspond to a reversible process,
and would result in no increase of en-
tropy and no loss of information in
transmission. The more imperfect the
communicaton, the greater the increase
in entropy. Perhaps a new criterion for
evaluating professors could be devel-
oped—the increase of entropy per lecture
hour, per student! However, one must
keep in mind that effective communica-
tion depends on both the transmitter and
the receiver!
Undoubtedly you can find many ways
to apply the entropy concept to various
spheres of your life. How much does the
entropy increase during an evening of
home work? Is there a greater increase
of entropy during an evening of argu-
ment as compared to an evening of
study?
I have been tempted to suggest that
theologians apply the concept of entropy
to various religious concepts. The stand-
ard for our life (in the Christian con-
text) is perfection. Perhaps every fail-
ure and breaking of the moral law, or
sin, has an associated increase in entropy,
and the forgiveness of sins, which the
Christian gospel presents, can be consid-
ered as a restoration to the state of mini-
mum entropy. And could this matter of
heaven and eternity be related to an
existence in which there was no increase
in entropy—only reversible processes?
Certainly time would have no meaning
in this case.
Finally, how much has the entropy in-
creased during the writing and reading
of this article? I can only hope that it
has been modest.

management to the advantages of electronic data processing.
Once they have acquired an IBM system, he acts as a con-
sultant on new uses for the system.
A Spectacular Engineering Achievement. How is he helping to
redesign a bridge? One of his clients is the agency which con-
structs and operates transportation facilities in the New York-
New Jersey area. Recently, they began to add a lower deck to
the George Washington Bridge. It has been a spectacular engi-
neering achievement. Sections were brought up the Hudson
River on barges and hoisted hundreds of feet into position. All
this while heavy traffic continued in both directions.
This double-decking of one of the world's busiest bridges took
complex planning. An IBM system materially aided in the veri-
fication of bridge design calculations and in suspension bridge
truss analysis under various loading conditions. Tom O'Connell
supplied many of the computer programs that were used in
conjunction with other programs developed by the customer.
Tom now knows a lot more about the problems of bridge design.
A Job That Makes News. One of the exciting aspects of Data
Processing Marketing at IBM is this wide diversity of systems
application. Using the knowledge a man has gained in college,
and backed by the comprehensive training he receives at IBM,
he moves into many kinds of application areas. The areas are
always interesting, sometimes newsworthy. In fact, almost
every day newspapers carry stories about new applications of
computer systems in important areas of business, industry,
science and government.
If you would like to find out in more detail about the many kinds
of marketing opportunities at IBM, our representative will be
visiting your campus soon. He'll be glad to sit down with you
and discuss the reasons why marketing is a career with a
virtually unlimited future. Your placement office can make an

true of people and also are capable of
extensive logical expansion.
The basic of our technology is the at-
tempt to make nature do our work for
us. At one time, plowing was done by
a stick in the hand of a man. He found
this took some energy. Since man, by
nature, is a lazy cuss, he looked around
for some way to plow that would take
less of his energy. He found the horse
and later the tractor. In both cases, in
order to use the resources of nature he
first had to understand to a degree and
make use of the forces involved. He had
to understand nature.
Every law of nature can be expressed
mathematically. If we discover some laws
of nature we can, using the process of
mathematics, deduce other truths which
apply to nature. Since no experiment
will prove a universal law of nature, we
have other checks. First, of course, we
do more experiments to determine how
universally this law seems to hold. Then
we make deductions from this law and
the others that seem to hold and see if
they too are true where we determined
(Continued jrom page 21)
the others. If they are not, then, since we
know they would be if the laws we de-
rived them from were true, we know that
somewhere along the line one of the
laws, axioms if you will, does not hold.
The system of laws developed in this
way is known as Science.
You will recall that this is the way
that Einstein developed his famous Spe-
cial Theory of Relativity. An ether was
postulated to describe the motion of light.
Michelson and Morley, using this and
other laws, proved by experiment that
the earth must then be stationary with
relation to the ether. Since we know that
the earth rotates, moves around the sun,
moves with the sun in our galaxy, etc., it
is indeed difficult to assume that of all
the heavenly bodies, the earth is station-
ary while everything else moves.
Einstein took the laws which would
satisfy all of the experimental findings,
namely that the velocity of light is con-
stant and motion through the ether is
undetectable, and proposed other experi-
ments whose results he would try to pre-
dict with his laws. Since his new laws
explained everything that the old ones
did, and some things that they didn't, if
they also predicted correctly the results
of another experiment, for which the old
laws gave a different answer, the new
ones would be held as correct until
something came along that they couldn't
explain but some other set could. He
predicted correctly.
Then the power of mathematics de-
rives from its generality and is harnessed
by relating it to the real world.
In practice, we find that useful theories
often don't arise because of their need
but rather were already there and in var-
ious stages of development when the
need arose. Heisenberg (of the Heisen-
berg Uncertainty Principle) found, after
he had developed an algebra to deal with
the sub-atomic particles he was working
with, that the system (matrix algebra)
had been known to mathematicians for
some time. Power transmission engineers
found that they needed to use imaginary
numbers, which had been invented mere-
ly to make the number system more com-
plete, in order to explain and describe

Many phases of mathematics that are
useful now were originally developed
just to please the men who developed
them. Consider, for example, this mod-
ern problem: a telephone switchboard is
being set up to take care of 1,000 busi-
ness telephones in downtown Detroit.
They would like to arrange it so that
every call gets through with the shortest
possible delay while using as few trunk
lines as possible. Delay means dissatisfac-
tion and waste of time, while too many
trunk lines means wasted money.
First we do a survey of how much the
telephones are used (with the aid of sta-
tistical methods, of course). Suppose we
find that the average call lasts five min-
utes and the average phone is used 16
times in the 9-to-5 day and four times
in the peak hour of 2 to 3. Thus we need
at least 333 lines to keep everybody
happy if the calls are perfectly timed.
Let us assume that it is all right if a
customer is delayed once in say 20 calls
made during the rush hour. Using the
methods of probability theory we find
that considerably fewer than 400 trunk
lines are needed to do the job quite sat-
isfactorily.
Obviously this branch of mathematics
has some use. But how did it develop? It
developed first as a pastime and aid to
gamblers. They noticed, in the fifteenth
century, that certain things, such as
throwing a seven with two dice, hap-
pened more often than other things,
such as throwing a twelve with two dice.
Various problems were proposed and
some mathematicians became interested
in the several ways of solving them.
One such problem was given to Pascal
in a letter from the French gambler
DeMere in 1654. He said that he dis-
covered something that surprised him.
DeMere said that the probability of get-
ting a six in four throws of one dice
should be the same as the probability of
getting a twelve in twenty-four throws
of two dice. Now, this is quite obviously
true, since the probability of getting a six
in one throw is 1/6 and that of a twelve
is 1/36 and there are six times as many
throws in the second case. However, this
is only common sense and it didn't work
out that way in fact. When DeMere per-
formed the experiment, it turned out
that the first result, a six in four throws,
happened slightly more often.
Pascal treated the problem mathemat-
ically. He said that the probability in
the first case is one minus the probability
of not getting a six in four independent
throws, which can be shown to be equal
to 1 - (5/6)* = 0.518. Using the same
technique, the probability in the second
case is 1 - (35/36)24 = 0.491. This can
be mathematically proved with only a
few axioms, the most important of which
is that a six is just as likely to turn up as
a five or any other number on each indi-
vidual dice, i.e., the dice are "honest."
This illustrates one of the most im-
portant strengths of mathematics: As long
as the axioms are true of the subject in
question, the results of mathematical
manipulation hold even when common
sense fails completely. That is, in some
sense, mathematics is stronger than the
human mind. On the other hand, it is,
of necessity, a product of the human
mind and should be subject to the limi-
tations thereof; but if we continue in
this vein we will have a highly philo-
sophical discussion which is outside the
realm of this article.
Now we have some idea of the range
and power of the discipline called mathe-
matics, and even how some areas got
their start, but of course the first man
who counted past three didn't start by
setting down axioms and proving that

a big FISH in the right-sized STREAM
O
We've been told frequently that engineering graduates are attracted to a
company our size because of an honest atid understandable desire to be
"a big fish in a little pond". Perhaps others prefer to think of the future as
the challenge of "swimming up-stream".
We believe that Sikorsky Aircraft is actually the "right-sized stream" for
young engineers who would enjoy diversified, small-group activities, as
well as stature opportunities in a field that is not limited nor professionally
confining. Sikorsky Aircraft is the company which pioneered the modern
helicopter; and our field today is recognized as one of the broadest and most
challenging in the entire aircraft industry.
Because of this, we can offer stimulating experiences in an ideal environ-
ment. Work associations could include joining an electronic team of twenty
to thirty associates—or—working with a highly selective group of four or
five on interesting problems of radiation, instrumentation, auto pilotage,
automatic stabilization, etc.
And what of your future?
That, of course, involves your own potential for growth. As
a far-sighted company, we're more than willing to help you
meet the challenge of "going up-stream"!

had proof that the Earth was at least six
billion years old. How come? Was the
Earth older than the universe?
Andromeda Nebula Holds Answer
It was during Warld War II that the
answers came. Since Los Angeles was
blacked out due to the war, the annoying
background light was gone. Walter Baade
took this time to photograph the Andro-
meda Nebula. Due to the excellent con-
ditions Baade found his photographs
had resolved the inner portions of the
galaxy. He was then able to study the
bright interior regions along with the
dimmer outskirts. He discovered two sets
of stars in this galaxy with a different
structure and history. He labeled the
outskirt stars Population I and the in-
terior stars Population II.
About 98 percent of the stars in the
universe fall into the Population II group.
Most of these stars are old, moderately
sized with fairly constant characteristics.
They are found only in space-dust free

surroundings. The Population I stars are
not consistent in their characteristics, but
they are always found in the dust-choked
spiral arms of the galaxies.
When the 200-inch telescope was com-
pleted on Palomar Mountain, Baade
continued studying the two sets of stars.
He found Cepheid variables in both
groups. The Cepheid variables in the
Magellanic Clouds where no dust is
found were Population II variables. The
RR Lyrae variables also belong to this
group. As a matter of fact the Cepheid
variables in the globular clusters for
which the actual distance was worked
out statistically were all Population II
variables. This means the size of the uni-
verse was calculated using the Popula-
tion II Cepheid variables as yardsticks.
However, the distance to the Andromeda
Nebula and other galaxies were calcu-
lated using large giant variables which
fall into the Population I Cepheids.
Flickering Yardstick Lengthened
Everything would have been all right if
the Population I Cepheids would fit into
a period-luminosity curve. But in 1952
after a painstaking comparison of Popu-
lation I and II variables, Baade announced
the Population I Cepheids did not fit the
period-luminosity curve. A Population I
Cepheid was about seven times brighter
than that of a Population II Cepheid of
the same period.
Using the law that the brightness var-
ies inversely as the square of the distance
we can easily see the flickering yardstick
of the Cepheid variables becomes almost
three times as long as believed. Suddenly
the universe expanded, all of the gal-
axies that were measured using the orig-
inal yardstick were pushed away from us
by almost three times their believed dis-
tance.
The three questions asked by the as-
tronomers were answered. Our galaxy
had suddenly been reduced in size until
the Andromeda Nebula was larger than
ours. In fact it has four to five times as
many stars as our Milky Way.
With the expansion the globular clus-
ters in the Andromeda Nebula become
much further away than thought. There-
fore, their brightness becomes compara-
ble to our globular clusters. With the
whole universe spread out, the amount
of time from the starting point of the
recession was pushed back four to five
billion years. So the figure of six billion
years as the age of the universe coincided
with the geologists. The Earth was no
longer older than the universe.

WORLD'S HEAVIEST TRAFFIC!
Say good-bye to washboard pavements and
chuck holes—their doom may be sealed!
Key weapon in the war on costly road dam-
age is a new miniature highway developed in
the Standard Oil research laboratories in
Whiting, Indiana. It is only 12 inches wide and
44 feet in circumference, but it carries heavier
loads than any highway in the world. This Tom
Thumb turnpike will eventually lead to meth-
ods of building longer-lasting, smoother, safer
highways... at far less cost to taxpayers.
Four wheels whirling around hour after hour
can give it any degree of traffic intensity de-
sired. Pressure that corresponds to the weight
of the heaviest trucks can be applied to the
wheels. To simulate actual traffic, the wheels
are placed on braking and acceleration 90 per
cent of the time. Automated electronic equip-
ment can quickly change "road conditions"
from desert dry to cloudburst drenched."Road
conditions", too, can be changed from freezing
to thawing.
Within weeks, the new test-tube roadway
can determine what happens to roads during
years of use in all kinds of weather. It can pre-
test paving formulas and techniques, and may
show how to eliminate washboard pavement
and chuck holes. Savings in highway research
alone may run into millions of dollars. Even
larger savings in auto and road repairs and
possibly in gasoline taxes are in sight.
This test-tube roadway is just one of the
many exciting developments at Standard.
Every day, scientific research, pure and applied,
points the way to new or improved products.
This work holds great challenge and satisfac-
tion for young men who are interested in scien-
tific and technical careers.

The twinkle of a man-made "star" is being checked with this special telescope and
photocell. It is used to record the way light is refracted or
deflected by turbulence.
The project is one of a number by the
Great Lakes Research Division of the
University's Institute of Science and
Technology. The Division is conducting
a highly diversified investigation of the
Lakes about which little is known scien-
tifically. The researchers' "star" is a pow-
erful light attached to the Charlevoix
breakwall which hurls its beam a mile
and one-half across Lake Michigan waters
into the lens of a telescope located on a
point of land below the city.
At the rear of the telescope is a photo-
cell which translates the light's twinkling
into electrical energy so that the fluctua-
tions may be recorded in graphic form.
Just as a star appears to twinkle because
the earth's atmosphere varies in density,
so does this light twinkle as it passes
above the water's surface. In the case of
the man-made light the atmosphere is
air immediately above the water, made
turbulent by variations in the wind and
air and water temperatures. The light is
refracted or deflected as it passes through
this turbulent air, causing variations in
its intensity.
It is anticipated that correlation of
these variations with known conditions
of wind and temperature obtained from
instruments stationed in the light's path
will make possible a new data-gathering
technique that may be used almost any-
where over water.
Once such data is obtained, mathemati-
cal formulas considering such items as
molecular transfer between air and water
will be used to determine findings. The
project is under the direction of Donald
J. Portman, assisted by Floyd S. Elder,
both U-M meteorologists.

they applied to objects in the real world,
he just counted. We might say that the
road to power and glory for mathemat-
ics was begun by people who counted
the way some primitive groups still
count: one, two, three, many.
This may not be as far back as you
think, for I recall an incident in the
Korean War when a commanding officer
heard that an assault was being made at
one point of the U.N. line. He called
that company and asked the officer at
that end how many Chinese were com-
ing over the hill. The answer: "Oh,
many, many!" He got the same answer
from the second officer he talked to, and
finally asked to speak to the commanding
officer there. His answer: "A whole pot
full of 'em, sir!" to which the officer
replied, "Well, I'm glad somebody over
there can count!"
In any case, there was a time when
the largest number that people could dif-
ferentiate was three. This lead to some
problems for the shepherd, who might
have thirty or forty sheep. He solved it
ingeniously. At the side of the entrance
to the fold, he put a small pile of stones
equal to the number of sheep he had.
Then when he brought the sheep in for
the night, as each one entered the fold
he transferred a stone from one pile to
another. If there were any stones left over
when all the sheep were in, he went out
to look for the lost sheep.
The principle this shepherd used with-
out realizing it is one of the most impor-
tant principles in the science of counting.
The one to one correspondence is the
(Continued from page 47)
way that we determine the size of infin-
ity. In essence, all that the principle of
correspondence says is that if you can
arrange two groups of objects in such a
way that every item in the first group is
paired with one in the second group
with none used twice and none left over,
then the number of items in the first
group is equal to the number of items
in the second group. With it we can
prove some very interesting things. For
instance, the number of positive integers
is equal to the number of positive inte-
gral powers of 100, because we can set
up the following relationship which is
always satisfied:
1, 2, 3,
100, 10,000, 1,000,000,
4, 5, . . . .
10,000,000 10,000,000,000
Using the same principle we can prove
that the positive real numbers, rational
and irrational, between zero and one
have more members than the positive
integers. Let us set up the following table
listing all the real numbers:
1. .345432211 ....
2. .457683320 ....
3. .986453778 ....
4. .864588449 ....
etc.
Now take the real number expressed
in the following way: the first digit will
be 1 unless the first digit in the first
number in our list is 1 in which case it
will be 0. The second digit will be found
in the same way using the second digit
The name K. Henry is, as the
reader might suspect, a pseudonym.
Were this true identity known
however, there could be little doubt
but that he speaks with authority

and the Newman Club.

of the second number of our list. It is
now obvious that this number is differ-
ent from every number in our list and
thus there are some real numbers left
over when we run out of positive inte-
gers and so there are more of them.
Now the shepherd never thought that
the principle he was using to count his
sheep could be used to determine how
big an infinity is, but it can, and this just
serves to point out again the power that
mathematics gains from the fact that all
you have to know is that the system sat-
isfies the necessary axioms, and you know
that all the deductions following from
those axioms are also true.
At one time the whole number sys-
tem consisted of: 1, 2, 3, 4, ... . though
perhaps other symbols were used. In this
system, anything one could get by add-
ing or multiplying was a number. But
people subtracted and divided too. In
order that everything one could get by
these processes be a number, the zero,
the negative integers, and the fractions
were added to the system.
Then some smart alec came along and
proved that the square root of two
couldn't be exactly represented in this
system, so the irrationals were added.
Then somebody who really sounded crazy
asked what the square root of minus two
was. So the imaginaries were added. You
will remember that the power transmis-
sion engineers found a use for them, but
they were invented just because we
wanted some way to represent the square
root of minus two.
But all this is just counting better.
Mathematics also branched out into other
fields such as measuring, (the calculus),
finding likelihoods of an event's occur-
ring, (probability theory), representing
shapes and actions in numbers, (numeri-
cal analysis), and many more.
Without all that we've discussed above,
one couldn't drive a car without the fear
that one of those wheels we discussed
before would fall off due to the fact
that the engineer that designed it didn't
know how to calculate the size of the
axle needed to bear the load. We couldn't
turn on a light without the fear that we
would start a fire due to the fact that the
electrician couldn't calculate the gage
wire he needed to carry the current (and
in fact there wouldn't be wire gages).
In short, there's safety in numbers.

Mechanical Engineering
Mechanical Engineering is essential to virtually every industry and to every phase of technology. As
a result, it offers the widest range of opportunity and endeavor available in engineering today. In turn, this
requires that the mechanical engineer receive a broad and basic education which provides him with a
depth and breadth of understanding of the basic fundamentals—a background that characterizes mechan-
ical engineers and explains their ability to perform in all of the fields of engineering.
It is because of his wealth of technical background that a mechanical engineer finds such a wide
range of opportunities available. His education includes basic science and mathematics courses, non-tech-
nical courses, as well as a number of courses which may be termed engineering science.
Mechanical engineering courses at Michigan are directly supported by a number of laboratories in
which the student gains not only a background in particular areas, but also a general knowledge of
the scientific approach to engineering problems and the use of essential mechanical and scientific equip-
ment.
While the mechanical engineering curriculum, of necessity, must be broad and inclusive, there is
sufficient flexibility, even at the undergraduate level, to permit course work in particular areas of interest,
such as the automotive field, internal combustion engines, heat and power, metal cutting and manufactur-
ing, produce design, and materials.

. . a band in things to come
Taking the pulse of a petrified river
From the Colorado plateau—once the floor of a vast inland sea—
comes the wonder metal uranium. Using sensitive instruments, Union Carbide
geologists find its faint gamma rays along the beds of ancient petrified rivers.
Every ton that is mined ultimately yields just about half an ounce
of uranium 235 ... precious food for atomic reactors. At Oak Ridge, Tennessee
—the great atomic energy center operated by Union Carbide for the U. S.
Atomic Energy Commission—the fuel becomes the kind of energy that will
drive a submarine . . . light a city ... or help doctors pinpoint the location
of diseased tissue.
Finding, refining, and researching the materials used in atomic
energy are all part of the work done by the people of Union Carbide to enrich
your daily life. With pioneering curiosity, they are seeking new things not
only in atomic energy, but also in the fields of carbons, chemicals, gases,
metals, and plastics.
Learn about the exciting work
now going on in atomic energy.

SMOKE TUNNEL

Air flow past an airfoil at an angle of
attack is characterized by smooth
streamlines past the bottom surface,
while the flow over the top surface
changes from laminar to turbulent.
Changing the angle of attack of an air-
foil rapidly from 0 degrees to 14 de-
grees produces little change in the
streamlines above or below the airfoil,
but smoke vortices are formed at the
trailing edge, and rapidly grow in size.


A curve ball produces strange patterns
in the smoke tunnel. Notice the bow
wave extending from the ball, and the
turbulent flow in the region immedi-
ately behind the ball.

research and development-

-you'll find
Photography
at Work
with you
Research and development engineers
find photography one of their most
versatile tools. Camera and film can
record the readings of instruments—
can capture for study the fleeting
transient on the oscilloscope face. The
content and structure of metals can be
studied by photospectrography or
x-ray diffraction. And stresses in parts
are visualized by photographing
plastic models with transmitted polar-
ized light.
There's hardly a field on which you
can set your sights where photography
does not play a part in simplifying
work and routine. It saves time and
costs in research, on the production
line, in the engineering and sales
departments, in the office.
So in whatever you plan to do, take
full advantage of all the ways photog-
raphy can help.
CAREERS WITH KODAK:
With photography and photographic proc-
esses becoming increasingly important in
the business and industry of tomorrow,
there are new and challenging opportunities
at Kodak in research, engineering, elec-
tronics, design, sales, and production.

Q. Mr. Savage, should young engineers
join professional engineering socie-
ties?
A. By all means. Once engineers
have graduated from college
they are immediately "on the
outside looking in," so to speak,
of a new social circle to which
they must earn their right to be-
long. Joining a professional or
technical society represents a
good entree.
Q. How do these societies help young
engineers?
A. The members of these societies
—mature, knowledgeable men—
have an obligation to instruct
those who follow after them.
Engineers and scientists—as pro-
fessional people—are custodians
of a specialized body or fund of
knowledge to which they have
three definite responsibilities.
The first is to generate new
knowledge and add to this total
fund. The second is to utilize
this fund of knowledge in service
to society. The third is to teach
this knowledge to others, includ-
ing young engineers.
Q. Specifically, what benefits accrue
from belonging to these groups?
A. There are many. For the young
engineer, affiliation serves the
practical purpose of exposing his
work to appraisal by other scien-
tists and engineers. Most impor-
tant, however, technical societies
enable young engineers to learn
of work crucial to their own.
These organizations are a prime
source of ideas — meeting col-
leagues and talking with them,
reading reports, attending meet-
ings and lectures. And, for the
young engineer, recognition of
his accomplishments by asso-
ciates and organizations gener-
ally heads the list of his aspira-
tions. He derives satisfaction
from knowing that he has been
identified in his field.
One of a series
Interview with General Electric's
Charles F. Savage
Consultant—Engineering Professional Relations
How Professional Societies
Help Develop Young Engineers
Q. What contribution is the young en-
gineer expected to make as an ac-
tive member of technical and pro-
fessional societies?
A. First of all, he should become
active in helping promote the
objectives of a society by prepar-
ing and presenting timely, well-
conceived technical papers. He
should also become active in
organizational administration.
This is self-development at work,
for such efforts can enhance the
personal stature and reputation
of the individual. And, I might
add that professional develop-
ment is a continuous process,
starting prior to entering col-
lege and progressing beyond
retirement. Professional aspira-
tions may change but learning
covers a person's entire life span.
And, of course, there are dues to
be paid. The amount is grad-
uated in terms of professional
stature gained and should al-
ways be considered as a personal
investment in his future.
Q. How do you go about joining pro-
fessional groups?
A. While still in school, join student
chapters of societies right on
campus. Once an engineer is out
working in industry, he should
contact local chapters of techni-
cal and professional societies, or
find out about them from fellow
engineers.
Q, Does General Electric encourage par-
ticipation in technical and profes-
sional societies?
A. It certainly does. General Elec-
tric progress is built upon cre-
ative ideas and innovations. The
Company goes to great lengths
to establish a climate and in-
centive to yield these results.
One way to get ideas is to en-
courage employees to join pro-
fessional societies. Why? Because
General Electric shares in recog-
nition accorded any of its indi-
vidual employees, as well as the
common pool of knowledge that
these engineers build up. It can't
help but profit by encouraging
such association, which sparks
and stimulates contributions.
Right now, sizeable numbers of
General Electric employees, at
all levels in the Company, belong
to engineering societies, hold re-
sponsible offices, serve on work-
ing committees and handle im-
portant assignments. Many are
recognized for their outstanding
contributions by honor and
medal awards.
These general observations em-
phasize that General Electric
does encourage participation. In
indication of the importance of
this view, the Company usually
defrays a portion of the expense
accrued by the men involved in
supporting the activities of these
various organizations. Remem-
ber, our goal is to see every man
advance to the full limit of his
capabilities. Encouraging him to
join Professional Societies is one
way to help him do so.

Westinghouse walls may light, heat and cool the home of the future
It is possible? Definitely. Who can do it? Engineers and
scientists at Westinghouse. How soon? About ten years.
The change may create a completely new kind of
home. Thin wall coverings, called Raycscent panels,
will replace furnaces, air conditioners, light fixtures.
A new source of light called electroluminescence
will make the walls glow. A new source of heat and
cold, thermoelectricity, will make them radiate heat
in winter, absorb it in summer.
Both effects will be produced by ordinary electric
current. The whole hcating-lighting-cooling system
will have not a single moving part to make noise or
wear out. And the system will last almost forever.
This is just one of the many research projects that
help make Westinghouse an exciting and rewarding
place for young engineers. For more information

Cover Story
Bryan Whipple, in his Cooley Award
winning essay: "Individualism and Nat-
ural Superiority," has perceptively anal-
yzed the social phenomenon of individ-
ualism and its relationships to creativity,
politics, and economics.
His thesis stresses individualism as
cosmic law—as a natural and extremely
necessary fact of life. The fiction of the
equality of man leads the society into
a morass of complacency and apathy,
killing the dreams, causes, ideals and
ideas which motivate the social group.
To maintain a strong American De-
mocracy, we must, as respon:ible people,
assert out individualism and often, the
non-conformity attending it.

How
scientists
turned
gasoline
into a
mechanic's
helper!
From the day in 1911 that scientists
in a Standard Oil laboratory discov-
ered the secret of efficiently mass-
producing gasoline by cracking oil
molecules, they have continually
sought new ways to make it do more
than just move a car.
Today, thanks to scientific ingenu-
ity, gasoline does much more.
Just recently, for example, scien-
tists in Standard Oil's research center
developed a new additive—one that
turned gasoline into a mechanic's
helper! True, it can't change fan belts,
but what it can do is a pretty good
trick in itself!
Under ordinary traffic conditions,
varnish-like deposits collect in carbu-
retor throats. Engine performance
becomes erratic; idling is poor. As
time goes on, the deposits become
more difficult to remove.
The new additive discovered by
Standard removes such deposits.
Called M,PC&gt;, it was developed after
months of painstaking work in Stand-
ard Oil's research center. Months of
field tests followed the laboratory
work. And, in a driving test conducted
with a fleet of taxis in Minneapolis, it
was found that M,PG&gt; not only re-
duced deposits in dirty carburetor
throats, but also improved M.P.G.
(miles per gallon) 6.8% because of the
greater efficiency obtained from clean
carburetors. Translated into miles,
6.8% is 680 additional miles for
every 10,000 driven!Ai/&gt;C&gt;now is in
Standard's Gold Crown and Red
Crown gasolines.
Such leadership in scientific devel-
opment is nothing new at Standard.
Standard Oil was a pioneer in de-
gummed gasoline, de-waxed motor oil,
and many other improvements. For
70 years, Standard research scientists
have been making contributions to
petroleum progress, searching con-
tinually for ways to make oil more
useful to more people than ever before!
What Makes a Company a Good Citizen?
One gauge is a company's usefulness
... its contribution to the general wel-
fare. Through research, Standard
constantly strives to develop prod-
ucts that will strengthen America's
defenses and help millions of people
in their work, in their homes, and on
the road—today and in the future.

Chemistry in Steelmaking?
You bet! Steelmaking is an extractive industry, and its chemical processes are many,
complex, and—to the trained mind—fascinating.
There are many opportunities for chemical engineers here at Bethlehem Steel,
the world's second largest maker of steel and steel products.
Think of the blast furnace, where complex chemical reactions occur on a tre-
mendous scale. Same with both open-hearth and electric furnaces. These chemical
processes are complicated by the subtle variations in make-up of the materials used:
ore, limestone, scrap metal, alloys. And our coke ovens produce a variety of hydro-
carbon by-products.
Bethlehem offers excellent career opportunities for men in virtually all
engineering curricula: metallurgical, electrical, mechanical, industrial, civil,
mining, ceramic, architectural, and others. We suggest that you discuss Bethlehem
with your Placement Officer. And be sure to pick up a copy of our booklet,
"Careers with Bethlehem Steel and the Loop Course."

"Tke £ditots Pen —
CONTEMPLATIVE
From time to time we have commented about the desirabilty
of a good theoretical preparation for engineers as well as pointing
out an apparent lack of preparation of engineers for their role as
men in the world of today. As a result of these comments, several
suggestions have been made concerning the expansion of the course
requirements in the humanities or the elimination of some technical
courses to make room for additional courses in the liberal arts and
the humanities.
We must admit that these suggestions have not met with what
could be called "enthusiastic support." From a realistic standpoint
this type of response was not unexpected. Any type of broad,
sweeping changes can usually expect rough going, regardless of the
merit of the proposals.
Neverthless, we are still convinced that a proficiency in the
engineering sciences will not be a sufficient background for the
successful engineer of tomorrow. As we have stressed before, engi-
neers do not work as self-sufficient little groups in tiny cells—they
are continually dealing with people in the areas of politics, law,
government, education, finance, etc. At the same time an engineer's
success depends more and more on an understanding of people
and their motives—and this understanding can be intensified if
based on a background of sociology, psychology, philosophy, and
literature, etc.
It is readily apparent that we would favor some substantial
changes in the engineering curriculum. However, as mentioned
previously, a realistic view points out that there is little likelihood
of such changes occurring. With this realization in mind, we would
like to suggest a minor change in the curriculum that could have
an important impact on the individual. We would like to see the
addition of one 2 hour course that would attempt to cause the
engineer to become aware of the world of ideas as well as the world
of equations; to cause him to become aware of ideas and beliefs
other than those that he has been indoctrinated with since child-
hood; to cause him to evaluate these ideas on their merits by instill-
ing within him the spirit of objective thought; and, in general, to
aid him in the achievement of intellectual maturity.
For this course—which might be called a Seminar in Con-
templative Thought—we visualize something quite different than
the normal student-instructor-classroom-course arrangement. In
place of this normal situation would be a course composed of
reading, thought, discussion, and evaluation of one topic through-
out the semester. In this case the topic itself would be unimportant.
In a larger sense, what would be important was the fact that the
student went deeply into the foundations of an idea, evaluated a
number of approaches, and reached a conclusion that he could
support by logical reasoning. What conclusion was reached, what
topic was studied, or even the fact that only one topic was studied
would have little importance if the overall goals had been met—
namely, to make the student aware of the world of ideas and to
instill within him the desire to evaluate these ideas on the basis of
the issues and not on the basis of preconceived notions.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


As for the mechanics of such a course, it might be set up so
that small groups of students would meet informally for a two hour
period each week—with the instructor acting as a stimulator and
moderator rather than teacher or judge—to discuss various aspects
of the given topic as presented in suggested readings. Quite pos-
sibly the course would not even meet during the last month of the
semester while the student prepared a paper stating the conclusion
he reached on the issue and substantiating the reasons for his con-
clusion. The topic itself, as has been stressed before, is not import-
ant (except that it should have substantial depth on both sides of
the question) but it might be selected from topics such as the
following:
Man's Existence—For what purpose?
Liberalism vs. Conservatism.
Capitalism and Unions—Compatible?
Foundations of Freedom—Is interference with them protection
or destruction of democracy?
Eventually, we would hope that such a course would become
a graduation requirement. The addition of two hours to the cur-
riculum should not be difficult but the effects of these two hours
could be highly significant. Admittedly, we don't feel that these
two hours would be enough, but it is a step in the right direction.
SJnk Spot*
The Tecbnic, as some of you know, makes staff promotions
and changes at the start of the second semester. Consequently, this
is an ideal time for interested students to begin working on the
Tecbnic. If you have been interested in the Tecbnic but circum-
stances have prevented you from participating up until this time,
why don't you drop into the office in the next several weeks to dis-
cuss the opportunities for you on the Tecbnic staff.
The Tecbnic feels privileged to publish in this issue an out-
standing essay entitled "Individualism and Natural Superiority."
Written by Bryan Whipple, this essay won the $500 first prize in
the I960 Cooley Eassy Contest.
The publication of this essay brings to mind the posters which
have recently appeared on campus bulletin boards announcing that
the 1961 Cooley Essay topic is "The Role of the Non-Technical in
the Education of the Engineer." As evidenced by the above edi-
torial, we feel that this area should be of great concern to the stu-
dent engineer. We hope that the selection of this topic by the
Cooley Essay committee will evoke a widespread consideration of
this important problem.

INDIVIDUALISM AND
NATURAL SUPERIORITY
by BRYAN WHIPPLE,
Associate Editor
Sir Isaac Newton, English philoso-
pher and mathematician, was one
of the greatest men of science. His
theories have set the groundwork
for many of today's advance-
ments.
"Americans are so enamoured of equal-
ity that they would rather be equal in
slavery than unequal in freedom."
—Alexis de Tocqueville1
Like the weather, conformity is some-
thing that everyone talks about, but
no one does anything about. In fact, it
is an evil so ill-defined, so little-docu-
mented, so totally under-researched, that
the popular conception of conformity is
completely befogged. Current opinion
assumes that conformity is undesirable
for some vague esthetic reason, somehow
connected with lessened fruitfulness and
joy in life. It is further widely held that
conformity arises from advertising press-
ures or other mass-communication phe-
nomena, and that its chief manifestation
is the grey-flannel suit.
In establishing the true import and
nature of our current lack of individual-
ism, recourse will be made to many of
the tools of analysis—definition of
terms, systematic study of uncertain
points, and deductive reasoning. Heuris-
tic methods—example, analogy, induc-
tion, and pure philosophizing—will
round out what is intended to be a cross-
sectional precis of "the significance of
individualism today".
Perhaps we ought first to dispel the
current and widespread fiction that we
have ever been a nation of individualists.
The quotation heading this section,
penned by a keen foreign critic of
Americana, will serve as a thesis. We
derive a good portion of our national
philosophy from various documents
asserting the equality of all men (al-
though we have seldom practiced this
belief). Patently, this is not true. Every
human characteristic is distributed statis-
tically. Some are saints, some sinners;
some geniuses, some imbeciles—all men
are not "created equal". Thomas Jeffer-
son, author of this much maligned
phrase, himself repudiates this interpre-
tation of the famous Declaration of In-
dependence sentence with the following
words:
"There is a natural aristocracy among
men. The gounds of this are virtue
and talents .... The natural aris-
tocracy I consider as the most pre-
cious gift of nature, for the instruc-
tion, the trusts, and the government
of society." 2
American egalitarian philosophy has
often operated to the detriment of the
nation. While it has functioned mightily
against the rise of any aristrocracy—in-
tellectual, financial, or political—it has
been impotent (for example) in com-
bating the truly unjust inferior position
of Negroes and Indian.
Jefferson, the father of American
democracy, believed that a natural aris-
tocracy was the safest repository for the
economic and political leadership of our
nation. De Tocqueville stated that our
infatuation with equality led us into

slavery rather than freedom. Emerson,
hardly less a democrat than Jefferson, be-
lieved that "an institution is the length-
ened shadow of one man; all history re-
solves itself into the biography of a few
stout and earnest persons". 3
Despite these warnings from our lead-
ing observers and philosophers, the
course of American history has b;en dis-
tinctly conformist. "United we stand,
divided we fall" was the slogan of the
Revolution and the Confederation. Our
politics have almost always been of the
two-party variety, and it is interesting to
note that the one outstanding exception
to this enduring bifurcation (the Popu-
list movement) resulted in more reforms
in a shorter space than at any other time
between 1783 and the New Deal.
Further evidence of our national tradi-
tion of conformity derives from the
"melting pot" myth. America has been
exceedingly slow to assimilate foreign-
born elements. The hundreds of foreign-
language newspapers, and numerous com-
munities of distinct ethnic character are
proof, not of the heterogeneity of the
nation, but of the insularity, homo-
geneity, and social immobility of the
ethnic colloids.
Our laws, which mirror majority
wishes, have been most effective in cre-
ating and enforcing conformity. The
antitrust laws prevent the seizure of great
economic power by the few, as does the
graduated income tax. On the whole,
such power is more desirable than unde-
sirable, for it is the stuff of which great
men are made and great dreams are
effected. It is only the abuse, and not
the existence, of such power that is to
be feared. Outstanding endeavor and ex-
ceptional talent must be nourished by
adequate rewards.
Public schools are a noble idea and
have done considerable good in provid-
ing mass literacy and instructing the
populace in the rudiments of knowledge.
Yet it is proper to question their bene-
ficence. They cannot and do not meet
the needs of those of exceptional intel-
lectual promise. Public schools blunt and
stulify superiority. They promulgate a
syrupy fog of semi-knowledge, frosted
and predigested so as not to inflame the
tender stomachs of the typical pupil. As
Philip Wylie says in Finnley Wren:
"At all the millions of little Ameri-
cans is hurled a gassy empire of data,
uncorrelated, unexplained .... A
thousand thousand false facts and
never a reason .... Some day ....
a healthy race will take our property.
And our epitaph will be "Here lies
America, stillborn in the little red
schoolhouse". "*
We have a long tradition of equaliz-
ing pressures in America. There are
scores of examples of our historic single-
mindedness, homogeneity, and con-
tentedness wnth mediocrity. The de-
partures from these traditions fairly co-
ruscate as the high points of this great
experiment in popular rule.
With such a background as this, need
we wonder why lack of individualism is
a problem in today's complicated so-
ciety?
The Organization Man and The
Lonely Crowd
"... God must hate the common
people because he made them so
common." 3—Philip Wylie.
We now turn to the contemporary sit-
uation. Two inspired and incisive analyses
have been written and widely read on
the subject, one by a business analyst
and one by a group of sociologists.
William Hollingsworth Whyte, Jr.,
author of the former {The Organiza-
tion Man), examines the systemization
and blatant hyperorganization of white-
collar business activities.
David Riesman, principal co-author of
The Lonely Crowd, presents a scholarly-
discussion of the everywhere-evident lack
of any backbone in the future plans of
the young.
Now, let us examine a possible cause-
and-effect relationship between these two
aspects of intellectual anasthesia. Prob-
ably there would be no organization men
if we were still inner-directed, (as Ries-
man calls the man who knows who he is
and why he exists). Our desires, our am-
bitions, our natural "cussedness" would
chafe under the oppression of organiza-
tion. Bureauaucratization provides an easy
alternative to imagination. Indecision
predicates intellectual cohesion; decisive-
ness precludes it. We have organization
men who are organized from without
because we have not organized men who
are organized from within.
Young people (e. g., college stu-
dents) are complacent, apathetic, drifting
because they have nothing to fight for.
They have no burning passions, no
dreams, no causes, no interests, no con-
victions, no ideals, ideas, or hope. They
are at sea. They are fogbound. But, they
are adjusted!
They are probably better-adjusted than
the television sets they have watched
since infancy, whose electron beams are
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


through which the adolescent brain is
nourished with passive entertainment.
They are probably better adjusted than
the automobiles that they drove through
youth, surrounded by a chrome-and-steel
amnion-surrogate, their bodies fallow and
unused.
The lives American children lead are
too sheltered, physically and emotionally.
Strong, free-thinking, idealistic adults do
not often grow from hot-house children.
Tom Sawyer and his contemporaries had
much more stimulating, exciting youths
than these youngsters with electromech-
anical brood-hens and carefully-super-
vised (Boy Scouts, etc.) "adventure".
Their imaginations are cloyed with se-
curity. Small wonder that we are raising
a barren generation.
How many kids these days have hob-
bies? Very few—probably far fewer than
most adults suspect. How many are
perplexed when (on a college entrance
questionnaire, or a job application) re-
quested to list "hobbies, interests, activi-
ties, etc."? What variety would we find
in a hundred listings, or a thousand?
These are the other-directed myriads.
These are the cliches incarnate. These
are the protoplasmic robots. These are
our embryonic organization men.
We shall now consider a documented
example of the illth of conformity today.
Illustration—Report of the Foundation
for Research on Human Behavior
The Foundation for Research on
Human Behavior, an autonomous research
group staffed partly by University of
Michigan personnel and located on the
campus in Ann Arbor, has synopsized its
studies concerning the need of organiza-
tions for creative talent in a 46-page
booklet entitled "Creativity and Con-
formity". This volume contains invalu-
able data and findings. For illustrative
purposes, a brief resume and comment
on certain of these is desirable.
For the sake of precision and clarity,
we should first introduce a definition of
conformity.
Conformity is not uniformity. What-
ever intelligence, simplicity, or conven-
ience—in fact, any rational reason—dic-
tates, is not conformity, no matter how
universal or conventional the conse-
quences. Conformity arises only when
we allow irrational or unreasonable
pressures to influence our behavior—when
we are led by another, in negation to
ourselves."
We may conform in four ways. Two
types of conformity arise in persons who
have their own opinions: the "passive"
type who succumbs through lack of con-
fidence, and the "expedient" type, who
continues to think that he is right but
strings along with the group anyway,
because it is easier than arguing. Then
there are two types of conformists who
have no opinions of their own: the
"cognitive" type who agrees with the
group because he thinks they furnish the
most likely answer, and the "belliger-
ent" type who always assumes a position
diametrically opposite that of the group.7
Further, conformity and individualism
never exist as mutually-exclusive abso-
lutes. It is as impossible to be a complete-
conformist as is it to be a complete indi-
vidual. Like any other human traits,
these are statistically distributed.
Psychological tests have been devised
to assess these traits. There are several;
we shall describe one, as an example.
The subjects are seated at panels where
they cannot see one another, but can
see a centrally-located screen. The ex-
perimenter asks questions which the
subjects are to answer by throwing a
switch in front of him. The questions
may be "factual-logical" (vocabulary,
number-series completion), perceptual
(optical illusions), or general attitude-
and-opinion questions. In front of each
subject, on his switch panel, are some
colored lights that he has been told will
indicate the choice of other members of
the group. They do not, however. The
experimenter controls all the lights. He
can exert "group pressures" on his sub-
jects by turning on the lights in such
a way that they think highly improbable
answers are really correct, since "every-
one else" chose them. The experimenter
alone knows what each subject really
chose.
Female college sophomores do most
poorly (amongst the groups tested) on
this test. They conform to the wrong
answers 56y2 percent of the time. Their
male counterparts conformed 26 percent.
Senior engineering students conformed
22 percent, while research scientists did
best, with only 16 percent conformity to
the wrong "group" answers.
Interesting correlations were found
during the tests. Nonconformity, it
seems, correlates with intelligence, ego
strength, masculinity, dominance, and
ascendancy. Non-conformers also scored
highly in social acuity—ability to under-
stand others.
During the research of the Founda-
tion, a precious example of how group
pressures work to prevent outstanding
performance in industry was discovered.
In the pressing room of a certain textile
manufacturer, a standard production rate
of 50 pieces per hour was in force.
Work in excess of this amount was to be
paid at a bonus rate. A new girl was
hired and put to work at the pressing
tables in the midst of a busy department.
After a few days on the job, she attained
and then surpassed the 50 mark. A haz-
ing process known as "scapegoating" be-
gan at once. Her co-workers tipped her
work off the table, among other harass-
ments. The girl's rate sagged to about
45. Shortly afterward, management sep-
arated the members of the work group,
and the new girl continued, working
alone. Her rate rose to above 90 within
a week and stabilized there.
Groups punish those who deviate.
This axiom is well known by anyone
with a spark of individualism in him.
(Fortunately, the same individualism that
perpetrates the societal sanction shields
the deviate.) Experimental proof of this
is reported in "Creativity and Conform-
ity".8 Scientists formed discussion
groups of subjects, three of whom were
insiders, planted by the researchers. One
of the plants was instructed to conform
to the majority opinion in his discussion
group. The second was to take a con-
trary position and adhere to it. The third
was instructed to start out with a dis-
senting opinion, but let the group "press-
ure" him into conforming during the
course of the discussion.
Upon completion of the discussion,
the groups were to select committees—
an executive committee to make policies
for the group, and a correspondence com-
mittee to handle some miscellaneous un-
desirable chores. While both the pressur-
able and straight conformist plants devi-
ated little from the chance level in num-
ber of nominations received to either
committee, the nonconformist was 25
percent ahead of the chance level in the
number of nominations to the work-
horse correspondence committee, and 15
per cent behind in number of nomina-
tions to the desirable executive com-
mittee.9
These are but three of the myriad evi-
dences of negative group influences on
originality and productivity. In the next
section of this paper, we shall attempt to
relate more closely the concepts of pro-

TECHNOLOGY
Here at last is an article that makes the funda-
mentals of transistors clear and understand-
able.
by DAVID C. BESTE
In the late 1940's, a new word was
introduced to the vocabulary of scien-
tists. This word was semiconductor. This
word has since led to others such as
semiconductor diode and transistor.
Today, many people have heard about
semiconductors and transistors. They
know that transistors take the place of
radio tubes. They know that they are
small and rugged, requiring no warm-
up time and little power. Few people
know, however, the principle of opera-
tion of a semiconductor. This article is

Figure I. Cubic crystalline structure with
the atoms at the corners of the cubes.
intended to describe the principle of
operation of a semiconductor, and in par-
ticular to describe the use of a semi-
conductor as an amplifier.
Basic Principles
Experiments such as X-ray diffraction
show that all good conductors (metals)
and all semiconductors (elements such
as silicon and germanium) have a crystal-
line structure. By crystalline is meant
that the atoms are held together in an
ordered array. One of the most common
crystalline structures is the cubic structure
in which the atoms can be pictured as
being at the corners of a series of cubes.
This is shown in Figure 1.
According to classical theory, each
atom is composed of a number of posi-
tive charges surrounded by an equal
number of electrons in orbit. Most of
these orbits are close to the positive
charges (nucleus). A certain definite
number (constant for a particular type
of atom) of these electrons are in an
orbit farther from the nucleus than all
others. These outermost electrons are
called valence electrons. They are the
ones which determine the electrical and
chemical properties of the atom.
If we now examine semiconductors
we find that they all appear in the same
column of the periodic table and have
four valence electrons. Since all semi-
conductors are essentially alike in chem-
ical and electrical properties, we will
only consider silicon.
Silicon atoms combine to form a
crystal. This crystal is held together by
the valence electrons which are shared
between two atoms in what is called a
"covalent bond". This is pictured in
Figure 2, where each line represents a
valence electron.
Each silicon atom (more precisely—

ion) has a net positive charge of 4, but
since for each ion in the crystal there
is an average of four electrons nearby,
the atoms show no net charge. If one of
these electrons could in some way be
removed, the atom would be left with a
net positive charge. Similarly, if one
electron were added, the atom would
exhibit a net negative charge.
The Junction Diode
If we connect a battery across a silicon
crystal, we find that no current flows.
The reason that no current flows is that
the valence electrons (i.e. the ones that
must move in order to have a current
flow) are all held tightly in their bond.
If we now add an impurity (about one
part in ten million) such as arsenic or
antimony which has five valence elec-
trons, we find that the semiconductor is
now capable of carrying current. The rea-
son for this is that only four of its val-
ence electrons are held in covalent bonds.
The extra electron, however, will move
when a voltage is applied because it is
held only loosely to the impurity. The
reason that it is held is that if it were to
leave, the impurity would be left with i
net positive charge which would attract
the electron. This force of attraction,
however, is much less than the force

holding the covalent bonds. Figure 3
illustrates the semiconductor with a pen-
tavalent impurity.
When a battery is connected across the
crystal, the electron is attracted to the
positive terminal and enters the positive
terminal of the battery. At the same time
an electron leaves the negative terminal
of the battery and enters the crystal.
Thus, a current is maintained through
the semiconductor. This pentavalent im-
purity semiconductor is called an N-type
semiconductor.
If instead of a pentavalent impurity,
one adds a trivalent impurity such as
aluminum, one finds that current will
again flow when a voltage is applied
across the crystal. The reason for this is
that one of the covalent bonds is now
incomplete and there remains what is
called a "hole" in the crystal. This is
pictured in Figure 4.

Figure 4. If aluminum is added to the
silicon crystal there are not enough
electrons to complete one of the cova-
lent bonds.
When a battery is now connected as
in Figure 5a an electron from a bond
just to the right of the "hole" moves
to the "hole" and fills it, thereby leaving
a "hole" in the position it had just left.
This is shown in Figure 5b.
This process continues until the "hole"
gets to the negative terminal where it is
filled by an electron from the battery. As
this happens, an electron leaves a bond
on the left and enters the positive term-
inal of the battery. This creates another
"hole". Thus a current flows through
the semiconductor. This is called a P-
type semiconductor. In future reference
to P-type semiconductors, we will con-
sider only the "hole" movement rather
than the more complicated electron "hole"
movement just considered.
We now have two types of semicon-

ductors. The N-type is formed when a
pentavalent impurity is added (electrons
are the current carriers). The P-type is
formed when a trivalent impurity is ad-
ded to the silicon ("holes" are its current
carriers).
In both the N-type and P-type semi-
conductors, the electrons and "holes"
respectively are moving around at random
even when there is no voltage across the
crystal. When the excess electron moves
away from the pentavalent impurity the
impurity is left with a net positive
charge. Similarly, when a "hole" moves
away from a trivalent impurity, the im-
purity is left with a net negative charge.
When no voltage is applied the total mass
of the N or P type semiconductors do
not show any charge.
If we now place an N-type semicon-
ductor next to a P-type semiconductor
we have a situation as pictured in Fig-
ure 6. In the N-type (N region) we have
fixed in position positive charges due
to impurity atoms and the unused (inco-
valent bonds) valence electrons which
are free to move. In the P-type (P
region) we have fixed negative charges
and free "holes".
If we now connect a voltage source as
shown in Figure 7 (the positive term-
inal connected to the N region and the
negative terminal connected to the P
region) we find that no current flows.
The reason for this is that in the N
region the free electrons are pulled to-
ward the positive terminal, but in moving
to the left they leave a net positive
charge on the right side of the N region.

From: R. U. Onetoo
Subject: Project Turnabout—An effective
ICBM defense.
The difficulties to be overcome in pro-
viding an effective and reliable, active
AICBM system are well known. These
difficulties have led to several proposed
systems that border on the impractical,
either because of excessive cost, excessive
research and development time, unde-
sirable side effects, or all three together.
The object of this memo is to describe
a promising AICBM technique that is
more practical. There are a few diffi-
culties, but these should be surmountable
with a modest R and D effort.
The basic idea of this technique,
which we shall call the "turnabout" tech-
nique, is quite simple. Consider a large
array of rigidly fixed rocket engines uni-
formly distributed in a band around the
earth's equator, all pointed tangent to
the earth's surface, parallel to, and in
the same direction as, the equator. When
an incoming enemy warhead is detected,
these rocket engines are all turned on.
This applies a great torque to the earth
about its axis, and accelerates its rota-
tion. By control of the thrust, the earth
can be made to rotate 180° between the
time of detection and the time of im-
pact. The missile would therefore land
on the enemy's own territories, and con-
tribute to his own destruction.
In the following paragraphs are ex-
hibited representative system parameters
and design problems of a turnabout sys-
tem. Assume that 1,000 seconds (16.7
minutes) are available between detection
and impact. Detailed calculations are giv-
en in Appendix I.
1. Acceleration and Force Required.
For simplicity, we assume a constant an-
gular acceleration a. Then angular dis-
placement (6) at the end of t seconds
is 0 = at2/2. For 0 = x, t= 1,000
sec., we find a = 6.28 X 10'° radian/
sec2. The torque required to impart this
acceleration to the earth is 6.12 X 10s"
dyne-cm. Dividing this by the radius of
the earth to find the required tangential
force, we find 9-6 X 1030 dynes or about
2 X 10" pounds of thrust. This could
be provided by using 10'" rocket engines
of two megapounds thrust each.
2. System Cost. We follow the usual
AICBM practice of measuring the system
cost in units of the gross national product
(GNP). At present the U. S. GNP is
only about $400 billion per year, but it
has been estimated that it will soon reach
S 1,000 billion per year so we shall as-
sume 1 GNP =$1,000 billion = $1012.
Research should bring the cost of one
rocket to 10 cents, which would bring
the system cost to only one million
GNP's.
3. Personnel and Production Require-
ments. The total population of the earth
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


is 3 X 1°B but lt would be unrealistic to
assume that more than 1 X 10° would
be available for production of the rockets.
This leads to a quota of 10"1 rockets per
worker. This means that to produce them
in a working year (3,000 hrs. or 10T sec.)
a rate of 1,000 two-megapound rockets
per sec. must be maintained. With mod-
ern technological advances this will soon
be possible.
4. Fuel Consumption. If we assume a
relatively high-performance rocket fuel,
such as liquid hydrogen with a liquid
fluorine oxidizer, having a specific im-
pulse of about 400 pound of fuel con-
sumed per second, we find a fuel con-
sumption rate of about one metric ton
per second per megapound thrust. To
operate the two-megapound rocket en-
gines for 1,000 seconds therefore re-
quires about 2 X 1028 grams of fuel.
Inasmuch as this is over three times the
mass of the earth, it is obvious that
some new exotic fuel will have to be
developed.
5. Miniaturization problem. The total
surface area of the earth is about
5 X 10'' ft-2, but the band around the
equator in which the rockets would be
mounted will not be more than 1 /5 of
this area, or about 101"' ft.2 The mount-
ing density then would be 10,000 rockets
per square foot. This could be accomp-
lished by reducing the size of the rockets
to one cubic foot and stacking them
10,000 deep.
6. Side Effects. The principle side
effects stem from the angular velocity &lt;,,
acquired by the earth's rotating 180°.
For t= 1,000 sec, o&gt; = 6.28X10"3
radians per sec. The radial acceleration
(centrifugal force) needed to keep an
object on the surface of the earth in
tropic temperature latitudes is T = R&lt;,&gt;2
= 25,000 cm/sec.2 This reduces to
T=l g. at 87.8° latitude or 170 miles
from the poles. This means that most
loose objects on the surface of the earth,
such as vehicles, personnel, buildings,
the oceans, several hundred miles of the
earth's crust, etc., would have a tendency
to depart equal to 25 times the force of
gravity. However, the tangential velosity
at the surface at this point would be
R&lt;o = 25/sec, or 3.6 times the escape
velocity, so there would be very little-
danger of this material's falling back
down. It is probable that this side effect
would be distinctly adverse to the enemy.
Indeed, whether or not his warhead
would survive the barrage of debris, to
fall back to where his country had been
is quite academic. Of course it is nec-
essary to the population of the United
States and her allies that we take meas-
ures against the side effect, but this is
easilly accomplished by sinking large
shafts to the center of the earth's axis
of rotation, and excavating a large
cylindrical refuge chamber along the

maximum force of gravity on the walls
of the cylinder would be 1 g. The cham-
ber could easily be made air-tight and
fitted with air locks at the entrance
shafts.
7. Immediate Research Program In
view of the obvious efficiency of the turn-
about system, it would be advisable to
initiate an immediate research and de-
velopment program on which the final
design could be based. The problems
to be overcome, such as rocket engine
mountings to withstand 25 g's., construc-
tion techniques for the escape shafts and
refuge cylinder, etc., are clearly solu-
ble if a sufficiently intense develop-
mental program is undertaken. We
therefore, propose the immediate found-
ing of the following preliminary devel-
opment program.

Rocket engine mountings.... 0.5 GNP's
Shaft excavation technique.. 3.5 GNP's

Total 10.01 GNP's
It should be noted that the prelim-
inary research is only one millionth of
the final system cost of lo: GNP's an
unusually low fraction for the purpose
involved.
Appendix I. Data on the physical
constants of the earth is taken from the
38th edition of the "Handbook of
Physics and Chemistry," Chemical Rub-
ber Publishing Co., Cleveland, Ohio. The
radius of the earth is r = 6.37 x 10s cm

ROOM 128-H
Every engineer will be interested in this new
report on salaries and offers given to Michi-
gan's latest crop of engineers.
By J. G. YOUNG, Director-
Engineering Placement Service
The overall market for our engineer-
ing graduates continued to improve
this year. With approximately the same
number of graduates available as last
year, both salaries and recruiting activity
reflected a substantial increase in demand.
The most intense demand was noted in
the research and development areas, as
indicated by the increasing differentials
paid for high scholarship and advanced
degrees, but requirements in the design
and application areas were also strong
as evidenced by increases in comparison
with last year. Aeronautical requirements
of the BS level, however, did not in-
crease, evidently as a result of the con-
version from airframes to missiles. Oppor-
tunities for training-type summer jobs
were up substantially in most industries,
and salaries for such jobs also in-
creased.
In spite of the increased demand,
student interest and effort in finding em-
ployment also appeared to increase. This
was evidenced by a substantial increase
in the amount of campus interviewing
and plant visits, and in an unprecedent-
ed number of compliments from employ-
ers concerning the conduct and prepared-
ness of students in their interviewing
and negotiations.
Three trends in the types of positions
accepted were also noteworthy. The first
was a reversal of the trend to the West
Coast in favor of the Midwest, probably
reflecting a reduction in the numbers re-
quired by the aircraft industry. The
second was a large increase in the pro-
portion of students starting on training
programs instead of direct assignments
to specific functional activities. The third
was a substantial increase in the propor-
tion starting with medium-sized, rather
than large, organizations.
The following paragraphs present semi-
detailed placement data for the year to-
gether with comments indicating some
of the more significant trends. More de-
tailed breakdowns of much of this infor-
mation may be obtained from the Place-
ment Office.

probably indicates only that the number
of acceptances reported is too small to
significantly determine the trend.

to be the result of employers reporting
a smaller proportion of offers than last

Solid opportunities with solid state devices
A big part of Western Electric's job is to manufacture the
miniature "new arts" products that are changing the science
of communications. It's a job which offers you a challeng-
ing career—a chance to plan new methods of mass produc-
ing ever-improving kinds of transistors, ferrite devices,
diodes, special purpose electron tubes, etc.
You'll be with a company that is expanding rapidly in
this field. At present our Allentown and Laureldale, Pa.,
plants are devoted exclusively to making electron devices,
and a big new plant is under construction in Kansas City.
The needs of the Bell Telephone System for these products
are increasing daily and will multiply enormously with the
introduction of Electronic Central Office switching now
nearing trial operation.
These devices are changing the scene at all our manu-
facturing plants as they go into the startling new com-
munications products developed by our associates at Bell
Telephone Laboratories. From microwave transmission
equipment to submarine cable amplifiers, our products call
for creative production engineering, installation planning,
and merchandising methods. Our job for the Bell System
and the U.S. government has grown to the point where we
are now one of the nation's "Top 11" in industrial sales.
And your chance to play an important part in our future
growth is solid!
Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, industrial, civil and
chemical engineers, as well as physical science, liberal arts, and busi-
ness majors. For more information, get your copy of Consider a Career

Come along with this Technic writer as he visits
a large chemical factory to find out what engi-
neers are doing "on the job"!
Four hundred tons of sulfuric acid
per day! Forty tons of nitric acid
per day! Those basic chemicals are just
two of the many products of the Everett,
Massachusetts plant of Monsanto Chem-
ical Company. This plant specializes in
heavy industrial chemicals including the
mineral acids, but it also produces a
variety of other products such as resins
and bleach. I recently had the privilege
of visiting this plant.
I made this visit for many reasons.
Having driven by the huge complex many
times, I was curious about the processes
which went on in it and about the prod-
ucts which flowed from it. More import-
ant, however, was my desire to gain a
first hand look at industry, the engineers'
role in industry, and managements' out-
look toward engineers. In addition, after
studying chemical reaction from a the-
oretical and laboratory viewpoint, I
wanted to see how the same reaction is
carried out in industry where not only
scientific but also financial considerations
are of importance.
My visit began at the office of the
plant manager. The plant manager, Mr.
Richard Kozacka, is a Michigan engi-
neer. Mr. Kozacka has been with Mon-
santo since he graduated from our en-
gineering school. Since I was especially
interested in the part that the engineer
plays in the operation of the plant, Mr.
Kozacka began by describing Mon-
santo's policy towards its engineers,
which is typical of the industry's policy.
In industry, people are of the utmost
importance. This is especially true of the
engineers since they are in such great
demand and since they are essential to
the manufacturing industry.

Employer-Employee Relations
I was surprised to see how personal
the relations between the firm and its
employees are. Every year a performance
review report is made out for each em-
ployee. The report is filled out by the
employee's immediate supervisor. It is
then reviewed by the person next up the
ladder of administration. The five-page
report includes such items as the work
given to the employee and the results
which he achieved. Much of the report
is made out during or after a discussion
between the subject of the report and
his supervisor. This man-to-man talk ac-
complishes much for the company and
the employee. The employee gains from
the discussion by being given the right
to voice his feelings toward himself and
toward the firm. This helps to promote-
better understanding between the two
parties and allows a better appraisal of
the subordinate. The company, by satis-
fying the employee, gains in efficiency
and in increased enthusiasm from the
employee.
A particularly interesting section of
the report is the "Development Plan".
The plan is framed jointly by the em-
ployee and the supervisor during the
interview. It consists of general and
specific recommendations for the em-
ployee. These recommendations may be
of a large variety. As an example, for
an engineer the problem may be that he
is becoming interested only in technical
subjects. The accompanying recommenda-
tion may be to read non-technical maga-
zines, e.g. Time, Life, etc., to broaden

Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a
favorable engineering atmosphere.
Back in 1925, when Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft was
designing and developing the first of its family of
history-making powerplants, an attitude was born—a
recognition that engineering excellence was the key
to success.
That attitude, that recognition of the prime impor-
tance of technical superiority is still predominant at
P&amp;WA today.
The field, of course, is broader now, the challenge
greater. No longer are the company's requirements
confined to graduates with degrees in mechanical
and aeronautical engineering. Pratt &amp; Whitney Air-
craft today is concerned with the development of
all forms of flight propulsion systems for the aero-
space medium—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and
other advanced types. Some are entirely new in
concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with
degrees in mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chem-
ical and nuclear engineering are needed, along
with those holding degrees in physics, chemistry
and metallurgy.
Specifically, what would you do?—your own engi-
neering talent provides the best answer. And Pratt
&amp; Whitney Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which
that talent can flourish.
For further information regarding an engineering
career at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, consult your col-
lege placement officer or write to Mr. R. P. Azinger,
Engineering Department, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft,
East Hartford 8, Connecticut.

At P&amp;WA's Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear Engine Lab-
oratory (CANEL) many technical talents are focused
on the development of nuclear propulsion systems for
future air and space vehicles. With this live mock-up
of a reactor, nuclear scientists and engineers can
determine critical mass, material reactivity coefficients,
control effectiveness and other reactor parameters.

Representative of electronic aids functioning for P&amp;WA
engineers is this on-site data recording center which
can provide automatically recorded and computed
data simultaneously with the testing of an engine. This
equipment is capable of recording 1,200 different
values per second.

Studies of solar energy collection and liquid and vapor
power cycles typify P&amp;WA's research in advanced
space auxiliary power systems. Analytical and Experi-
mental Engineers work together in such programs to
establish and test basic concepts.

Chemical Engineering students are better able to understand the engineer's
role in industry when they visit a chemical plant. Here they watch air being
passed between thin sheets of plastic.
his activities and interest. By this system
the employee helps himself and helps
the company.
Mr. Kozacka then went on to tell me
about the engineers' role in the plant,
and about the plant in general.
The engineers are substantially on
their own in determining and carrying
out the methods which they use to
solve the problems arising in their work.
Most of the more experienced engineers
handle a particular aspect of the whole
plant, such as safety. The younger en-
gineers are assigned to specific projects
which grow in complexity and importance
as the experience of the engineer grows.
Occasionally a young engineer with a
large amount of potential is assigned to
a very important project. This is done
because he will not know the problems
which have stumped more experienced
engineers associated with the project. He
is starting out with a clean slate. This
type of brainstorming was used to good
advantage at this plant about two years
ago. At that time one of the major oper-
ations in the plant was operating un-
successfully. After many attempted solu-
tions had failed, the problem was given
to a very recent graduate of the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology. He suc-
cessfully solved the problem after much
hard work.
This young engineer is a good example
of industry's new crop of technical talent.
He joined Monsanto as an engineer at
Everett a little over two years ago. He
showed great promise when he was first
hired. At Everett, he did much in the
way of solving production engineering
problems. As his successes gained notice
he was given more responsibility and
more benefits. He is now working at
Monsanto's headquarters in St. Louis,
and if present prediction proves to be
correct, he has a fine future ahead of him.
As you can see, the plan of giving
engineers projects helps both the com-
pany and the engineer. It allows the
engineer to show what he can do and
allows the company to gain from the
increased output of the engineer.
My visit with the plant manager gave
me the overall impression that relations
between supervisory personnel and sub-
ordinate personnel are on a friendly
basis. This personal contact is an asset
to all who are associated with it—the
engineers, the technicians, the managers,
and the company.
After my visit with the plant manager
I was taken on a tour of the plant itself.
It covers 160 acres, about 80 of which
are "cultivated", that is, have facilities
upon them. It employs about 800 workers,
32 of which are engineers. About one-
half of these engineers are in admin-
istrative positions.
Sulfuric Acid Production
One of the major facilities of the
plant is the sulfuric acid production
operation, It produces about 400 tons of
HjSOj per day. The process begins in
Louisiana, where molten sulfur direct
from mining by the Frasch Process, is
put aboard tankers. The tankers take the
sulfur to New Haven, Connecticut. Here,
Monsanto has a large tank farm. The
sulfur, still in the molten state, is trans-
ferred to a costal barge. The barge goes
from New Haven to Everett, Massa-
chusetts. At Everett the sulfur is placed
in large tanks to await use. The tanks
are heated and well insulated in order
to keep the sulfur molten. For the re-
turn trip, sulfuric acid is placed in a
second set of tanks in the barge. The
barge takes the acid to New Haven, from
whence it is distributed.
The transportation of molten sulfur
is a comparatively new innovation. Un-
til a few years ago the sulfur was brought
from Louisiana in powder form. This
meant that before it could be used, it
had to be melted. This would appear to
be a small cost, but when tons of sulfur
must be melted each day, this cost gains
importance.
The molten sulfur, together with air
which has been dryed and cleaned, is
introduced into the first sulfur burner.
This burner is about three stories high.
In the burner the sulfur combines with
the oxygen in the air to form sulfur
dioxide. This operation is exothermic so
that the sulfur has to be brought up to
its ignition point by an oil fire and then
the operation creates excess heat.
After the process the gases are very
hot. They are cooled by passing them
through a boiler in which steam is formed.
This steam is then used to provide heat
for other operations in the plant.
Then, the sulfur dioxide goes to an-
other reactor. In this reactor the sulfur
dioxide is reacted with more oxygen in
the air to form sulfur trioxide. This
reaction takes place very slowly under
normal conditions. In order to speed
the reaction, a catalyst is used. The cat-
alyst presently used in most sulfuric acid
plants, including this one, is vanadium
pentoxide. The exact action of the cata-
lyst is unknown, but it has been postu-
lated that the catalyst provides a large
surface area upon which the reaction can
take place. Like the first reaction, this
reaction is exothermic, hence the hot
gases are again sent through a boiler to
produce steam and to cool the gases.
Since sulfur trioxide is the anhydride
of sulfuric acid, the next step in the
process is hydration. At Everett, the
sulfur trioxide is introduced into a large
absorption tower. In the absorption
tower is concentrated sulfuric acid. When
the trioxide combines with the acid,
oleum or fuming sulfuric acid is formed.
Some of this oleum is taken from the
processing tower, but most of it is

tion of and consequential reaction with
water. The concentrated acid is then
drawn off and diluted to the desired
strength.
Nitric Acid Plant
The next operation that I visited was
the nitric acid facility. The raw materials
for this process are liquid ammonia and
air. The ammonia is produced by the
Haber process (direct combination of
nitrogen and hydrogen) and brought to
Everett in tank cars. The air is com-
pressed by four huge compressors and
then cleaned. Vaporized ammonia and
the clean compressed air is introduced
into a reaction chamber. The chamber
contains a platinum screen which acts as
a catalyst. The reaction takes place at a
temperature of about 900 degrees Cen-
tigrade. Water is also produced in the
reaction, hence, the product is dilute
nitric acid. This dilute acid is concentrat-
ed or diluted to the desired strength.
Much of it is made into mixed acid, a
mixture of concentrated sulfuric and
nitric acids.
The plant makes a variety of products
in addition to the sulfuric and nitric acid.
Part of the sulfur dioxide made in the
sulfuric acid process is diverted to the
production of sodium bisulfate. An-
other product made here is aluminum
sulfate which is formed by the action of
sulfuric acid on bauxite. Some synthetic
resins are produced also. One prod-
uct made at Everett is produced nowhere
else. This is the solid bleach used in
such products as "Beads o Bleach" and
"Bleach Tabs". This bleach is about 90
per cent chlorine—the highest percent-
age now obtainable in usable solid form.
A tremendous supply of raw materials
is needed to produce the chemicals. The
molten sulfur and liquid ammonia have
already been mentioned. From the Carib-
bean, solar salt is brought by freighter
to Everett. Solar salt is left after evapor-
ation of salt water by the sun. Bauxite is
imported from Surinam. The bauxite,
which is chemical grade, is used to sup-
ply aluminum for the aluminum sulfate.
Everett has an advantage over inland
plants because it has deep-water harbor
facilities. The plant dock can take ships
which draw up to twenty-seven feet.
A great deal of steam is needed to
provide heat for the operations of the
plant. This heat is provided by the sul-
furic acid operation and by a large steam
plant. The steam plant is equipped with
enormous gas-fired boilers.
Quality Control Laboratory
Another supporting facility for the
plant is the quality control laboratory. No
research is done in this laboratory; all
research for Monsanto takes place in
their research center in St. Louis, Mis-
souri. The laboratory is in charge of all
quality control for the Everett plant.
Constant analysis is necessary to insure
quality products. Production in each
facility of the plant must be carefully in-
spected at set intervals. This constant
quality control keeps a good size labora-
tory busy. Like most industrial labora-
tories, this one is immaculate. One
surprising thing that especially impressed
me about the laboratory was its method
of preventing reactions to take place
among disposed wastes. Each bottle for
disposal is color-coded with colored tags.
Every color represents a type of chem-
ical. This insures that two incompatible
wastes will not be allowed to react.
In order to provide cooling for the
plant, a large amount of cool water is
needed. The water which circulates
through the plant's facilities is fresh
water. It flows in a closed system of pipes,
and is cooled by water from the Mystic
River. The river water is impure. This
causes corrosion, but replacing the corrod-
ed pipe and equipment, is much cheaper
than using city water. Also, by using the
pure water to do most of the cooling, a
great deal of corrosion is prevented.
Another problem is air pollution. This
problem is under control at Everett, al-
though occasionally there is a perceptible
amount of pollution. Monsanto has spent
a considerable amount in lessening the
pollution from the plant. A recent instal-
lation to treat the waste gases from one
operation cost a quarter of a million
dollars.
Safety is extremely important at the
plant. The personnel director, Mr. Robert
A. Ginivan, who is also an engineer,
estimated that about one-half of the
capital investment in the plant went to
provide safety. One of the senior engi-
neers is in charge of safety. The plant has
a very good safety record. In fact, it is
not unusual for the plant to go several
years without a lost-man-hour accident.
As all large chemical and petroleum
plants, the Everett works runs twenty-four
hours per day. Therefore, maintenance
becomes a problem. For general clean-
ing and repairing, the sulfuric acid fa-
cility is shut down about once a year.
The nitric acid operation must be stopped
approximately every week-and-a-half to
allow a change in the catalyst which is
then cleaned and reused. If an operation
is in need of emergency repair, a tempo-
rary repair is made so that the plant can
go on producing until its scheduled
shutdown. This is especially true of the
large operations such as the sulfuric acid
facility.
I feel that I accomplished my objec-
tives in visiting the plant. I received a
good look at industry and at engineering.
Much of what I saw is aiding me to bet-
ter understand my courses and how these
courses help the engineer when he goes
into industry. I strongly urge any en-
gineering student, especially freshmen
and sophomores, to take advantage of
any opportunity to visit a plant. I en-
joyed my trip and learned much from
it. I am sure that you will say the same
thing if you take "a first hand look at
industry".

Each 6,000,000 pound thrust rocket ship now being planned for manned
interplanetary exploration will gulp as much propellant as the entire capac-
ity of a 170 passenger DC-8 Jetliner in less than 4 seconds! It will consume
1,140 tons in the rocket's approximately 2 minutes of burning time. Required
to carry this vast quantity of propellant will be tanks tall as 8 story buildings,
strong enough to withstand tremendous G forces, yet of minimum weight.
Douglas is especially qualified to build giant-sized space ships of this type
because of familiarity with every structural and environmental problem
involved. This has been gained through 18 years of experience in producing
missile and space systems. We are seeking qualified engineers and scien-
tists to aid us in these and other projects. Write to C. C. LaVene, Box 600-W,

AND
RESEARCH
Edited by CHARLES MASSER
Michigan Education &amp; Research
This month Michigan-Education and
Research touches many unknown hap-
penings that occur every day at this
university. Our subjects range from how
currents behave in Lake Michigan to a
discussion of University of Michigan
students using electronic computers in
their homework problems.
Education Must Include
Humanities
Education today can neglect neither
humanities nor technology, according to
Algo D. Henderson, University of Mich-
igan professor of higher education. Pro-
fessor Henderson addressed 10 college
and university administrators from nine
foreign countries attending a three-week
Seminar on University Administration in
the U. S. He said, "Both general and
occupational education should be includ-
ed for every college and university stu-
dent. The answer relates back to our
belief in the kind of education that a
free man in a democratic society should
possess.
"The need of every individual for
literacy is now universally recognized.
The parent who has received some edu-
cation ordinarily desires his children to
advance to a better occupation than he
has had. In the U. S., training for occu-
pation has long been recognized as a
function of the public school and univer-
sity, although the apprenticeship method
is still widely relied upon for additional
or specialized training.
"Persons who have had some of these
advantages in our comprehensive high
schools, on becoming parents, desire their
children to go to college. Education, in-
cluding higher education, is clearly one
of the essential ingredients within our
rising standard of living shared by all
the people."
Henderson asserted, "Citizens in a
democratic society today have responsi-
bilities that far exceed those of earlier
generations. Communication and trans-
portation have brought the peoples of
the world much closer together. Today a
citizen needs to have a cultural back-
ground that will enable him to make wise
choices relating to the great issues of the
world. Thus, education at increasingly
higher levels is becoming essential as a
prerequisite for effective citizenship."
He pointed out that society obviously
benefits by having competent physicians,
historians and engineers, skilled organ-
izers and administrators, cultured par-
ents, teachers, and citizens. "We in the
U. S. are getting one additional percep-
tion of the role of higher education,"
Henderson stated. "This role is the cul-
tivation of our human resources. As a
nation we are encouraging young people
to attend college or university because we
need to enlarge their capacities for ser-
vice. We are building larger and stronger
universities because we are convinced
that it is in the national interest to do so."
Regulation of Body Temperatures
Studied
Madeline M. Pusco (Ph.D.), instructor
in physiology at the U-M Medical Center,
is investigating one of the elusive myster-
ies of human life: the way the body
regulates its own temperature. So far
science cannot pinpoint the mechanisms
which control heat production and heat
loss in the body, nor give a precise pic-
ture of how these mechanisms work. The
secret appears to lie mainly within the
hypothalamus, a small region deep inside
the brain which seems to function as the
body's "thermostat."
34
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


some sort of "thermostat which maintains
body temperature within very close toler-
ances. It governs those bodily activities
which maintain a delicate balance be-
tween heat production and heat loss."
If body temperature goes up, the hypo-
thalamus triggers a whole pattern of
responses—sweating, rapid breathing,
increased blood flow to the body's surface
—to discard heat from the body. If the
temperature drops, the hypothalamus
turns up the human "furnace" that con-
verts food into heat; it reduces blood
flow to the surface and starts muscles
shivering to create still more heat, the
U-M researcher explains.
A net work of nerves provides living
temperature detectors throughout the
body. They respond to changes in the
internal and surface temperatures, and
carry this information to the hypothala-
mus which then orders the necessary
adjustments.
Working with research animals, Dr.
Fusco can send bogus signals of temper-
ature change into the hypothalamus by
means of delicate electrodes. A "warm"
signal makes a dog relax, grow drowsy
and pant. He then starts losing heat and
his body temperature drops.
Conversely, a "cold" signal starts him
shivering. He curls into a tight furry
ball and his blood flow to the skin de-
creases to conserve heat. His actual body
temperature then begins to rise.
Dr. Fusco's future investigations will
seek answers to three major questions:
How, she wants to know, does the
hypothalamus control these heat re-
sponses? How sensitive is the body "ther-
mostat" to changes? And what is the
interaction between the deep body and
skin temperatures in the overall regula-
tion of body temperature. Information
along these lines may help doctors inter-
pret and control fever and the other ab-
normalities of body temperature which
are important symptoms of disease.
Behavior of Currents in
Lake Michigan
Lake Michigan currents dip some 15
miles into Little Traverse Bay, Univer-
sity of Michigan researchers have found.
Responding to wind direction and ve-
locity, the water moves from one-tenth
to one and one-half miles per hour,
either toward Petoskey or Charlevoix.
These are some of the findings in work
being carried on this summer by the
Great Lakes Research Division (GLRD)
of the University's Institute of Science
and Technology as part of a many-faceted
scientific investigation of the lakes ex-
pected to take a number of years.
Direction and speed of the currents
is determined by current poles and
drogues which are dropped overboard
from the Division's boat and then are
picked up after a fixed time limit. Com-
parison of their orgination with their
pickup point provides data on current
movement.
Prof. John C. Ayers, U-M oceano-
grapher, says Little Traverse currents had
been thought to dip in only about seven
miles, but under a strong west wind
doubled that distance. The U-M re-
searchers also put a fluorescent dye in
the water to measure the bay's mixing
characteristics. They examine the bay's
bottom by taking core samples.
Work on the bay is underway now in
part to help prepare for industry moving
into that area. Determination of currents
and other characteristics will show where
wastes dumped into the bay will go.
However, the main reason for the
GLRD's interest in the lakes is that
these inland seas, with an area of nearly
100,000 square miles and a shoreline of
about 8,000 miles, are the world's largest
source of drinking water.
"We must know in the immediate
years ahead all we can about the Great
Lakes if we are to preserve their value
and supply the ever increasing demands
placed upon them," says Prof. David C.
Chandler, GLRD director.
The GLRD's first major research work
began in 1954 when the characteristics
and currents of Lake Huron were inves-
tigated. Similar work was done in Lake
Michigan in 1955. Studies in Grand
Traverse Bay and elsewhere continued
the research.
Ahead lie such projects as core samp-
lings from the deepest parts of the lakes
to study their geologic history, intensive
work on the waters' plant and animal
life, and collection of data on inflow of
water from rainfall, and lakes and
rivers.

University of Michigan researchers are busy measuring Lake Michigan currents. Current direction and speed
are determined by charting movements of current poles like the one being thrown overboard.

MIT '59) is investigating the theoretical requirements of
an automated design system for advanced cryotron-circuit
computers.

# *
HE WORKS WITH A NEW DIMENSION
IN COMPUTER DESIGN
Thin film cryotrons may make possible computers of small
size and truly prodigious speeds.
The speeds of today's computers are limited mainly by
device switching times. Speeds of cryotron computers would
be limited mainly by signal propagation times between
devices.
Automation of Logical Circuits. Edward Sussenguth is
studying methods of design which will reduce the distance
between devices to a minimum. He hopes to work these
methods into a completely automatic design system.
Ultimately, then, the systems designer would specify his
needs in terms of Boolean equations and feed them into a
computer. The computer would (a) design the logical cir-
cuits specified by the equations, (b) translate the logical
circuits into statements describing the interconnections,
(c) from the interconnections, position the devices in an
optimal fashion, (d) from this configuration, print out the
masks to be used in the evaporation process by which
these circuits are made.
This is a big order, but Edward Sussenguth and his col-
leagues have already made significant progress. Their work
may well have a profound effect on computer systems in
the coming years.
Orientation: the future. One of the exciting things about
computer development is this orientation towards the
future. If a man wants to match his personal growth with
the growth of computer systems, his future can be virtually
unlimited. This is true of all the fields associated with com-
puter systems—research, development, manufacturing,
programming, marketing. The IBM representative will be
glad to discuss any one of these fields with you. Your place-

ductivity and originality; to connect indi-
vidualism, creativity, and progress.
Establishing the Necessity of
Individualism to Progress
We have little to fear from lack of
individualism in the superficialities of
the social order. Dress, habits, and
mannerisms are of minimal importance,
whether similar or differing. Indeed,
some case can be set forth for greater
standardization in these areas. For exam-
ple, if students were required to wear
identical uniforms, many socio-economic
problems that hamper education might
be alleviated.
In the significant area of thought, how-
ever, a divergence amongst persons be-
comes a necessary adjunct to progress.
This will be proved later. Humans are
indisputably differently-endowed with
mental ability, with respect to both in-
tensity and hue. Progress depends heavily
on the fullest exercise of these idiosyn-
cratic traits.
When we draw upon a colloquium of
minds for guidance in the shaping of
progress, we inevitably achieve only .1
statistical average of the talents repre-
sented by the contributors. Any especial
genius is commingled with the mediocre,
which invariably constitutes the bulk of
any group. Results of group activity, be
they ideas, plans, works of art, or sys-
tems of law, suffer from the ruthless lev-
elling of disparate capabilities.
We are speaking not only of formal
brain-pools, such as boards of directors,
legislatures, and research teams. We
include also the informal thought-collec-
tives—audiences, subscribers, listeners,
fans—every target of a mass-communica-
tion device. All produce results, all in-
stigate progress, only as a huge median-
being, of mediocre tastes, ordinary talent,
and common dreams.
The denegation of individual endeavor
in favor of "groupthink" has another
consequence, which is perhaps more deter-
ent to progress than this levelling. Its
effects cannot be predicted statistically,
however, so we shall merely theorize on
its extent and nature.
The cohesion of minds characteristic
of highly conformal groups tends to
blunt the individual ego. There is some
evidence in the biography of great men
that egotism is an ingredient, perhaps
of the nature of a catalyst, triggering and
sustaining the acid-attack of man upon
problem. When a higher loyalty diverts
even a part of this tonic, the insatiable
need of the hero to establish his own
heroism flags. A man who draws ideas
from one source and touches them up
slightly before passing them along to the
next in line has accomplished nothing he
can call his own. His is the position of
the assembly-line riveter, who feels no
empathy toward the completed auto.
We do not speak of competition or the
struggle for security, for these phenom-
ena occur, metamorphosed, under every
social setup, including communism. What
we describe is the need of individual re-
sponsibility, individual possibility. Pro-
gress would seem to require that a man
be sufficiently free from constraints—
rules, bosses, conventions, assembly-line
impersonality, and conferences—so that
he can identify with his work and believe
that bis work will identify him.
A definition of progress is in order.
We construe the term in somewhat the
way a philosopher construes "truth".
Progress is any force, activity, or event
that militates toward a more ideal human
situation.
Now we prove the necessity for a
divergence of ideas in order to effect
progress. "A more ideal human situa-
tion" is subjective; therefore, so is the
notion of progress, which is defined in
terms of the former. Change is implicit
in the definition of progress, too—" . . .
progress . . . militates toward ..."
Therefore, some mind must conceive a
more ideal situation in order for that
situation to exist; a divergence of opin-
ion is an a priori requirement of progress.
A similar relation arises in thermody-
namics, where two different temperature
levels are an a priori requirement for the
existence of heat, which is defined as the
flow of thermal energy from one tempera-
ture to another.
Illustration—The Brainstorming
Technique
Brainstorming is a well-known tech-
nique which strives to achieve creativity
in a group. The brainstorming group is
given a problem and instructed to suggest
any idea, no matter how far-fetched, that
might bear on the solution to the prob-
lem. Participants are supposed to use the
ideas offered by others as starting points
for contributions of their own, and the
total number of suggestions, it is theor-
ized, will snowball. Further, no sugges-
tion may be critized, lest the participants
become inhibited or apply judicial think-
ing (an evil) before speaking.
Brainstorming is the spawn of Madison
Avenue, perhaps the "organization" cap-
ital of the world. In the advertising busi-
ness, this technique has been successful
—for reasons which, oddly enough, sup-
port the contention that creativity is
the realm of the individual thinker.
First, advertising must be palatable to
large groups to accomplish its objectives.
Therefore, the larger the group that
conceives it, the more minds through
which it is strained, the greater the like-
lihood of widespread appeal. Truly crea-
tive work must be original and contrary,
even unpopular, to accomplish its ends,
as we have seen. Second, much of adver-
tising must be designed to establish very
trivial, if extant, differences between com-
peting products. It must persuade, not
instruct. Persuasion and pressure are
prerogatives of the group. Thus, "group-
think" triumphs—an excellent method
for finding mediocre solutions to trivial
problems.
Analysis—"Creative Thinking"
In a paper entitled "Creative Think-
ing—Introduction and Summary", Mr.
Fred Olsen, Vice-President for Research
and Development, Olin Industries, re-
ports on the fruits of an investigation of
\\'l years' duration by a team of dis-
tinguished researchers whom he assem-
bled to study creativity.
This group included Dr. L. L. Thurs-
tone, of the Psychmetric Laboratory of
the University of Chicago, as psycholo-
gist; Dr. F. S. C. Northrop of Yale as
philosopher (to examine creativity from
the standpoint of epistemology); Nobel
laureate physicist Arthur H. Compton;
composer-pianist Dr. Ernst Kronek;
painter John Ferren; and poet Richard
Wilbur, of the Harvard English depart-
ment.
Their work culminated in a three-day
symposium at the Skytop Club in the
Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania. Five
major elements seemed to appear as
consistent elements in the creativity
problem:
38
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the recognition of the disturbing ele-
ment. Until the irritant or the "thorn in
the flesh" has been discovered, there is
no beginning of any creative act.
"2) If our objective is, then, the
promotion of creativity, we have first to
find some ways of stimulating our sensi-
bility to dissatisfaction. We must de-
velop greater acuteness of this sensitivity
to things which are irritants, to things
which do not fall in line with our ac-
cepted generalizations. We must become
an ardent lover of what Gerard Manley
Hopkins says in his poem "Pied Beauty":
glory be to God for . . . all things
counter,
original, spare, strange.'
"3) ... it is equally necessary, as
Arthur Compton says, 'to do something
about it when you are irritated, . . .
irritation is the first, but the decision to
do something about it, that is the essence
of creativity.
"4) When the problem has been for-
mulated, and the decision made deter-
minedly to go after its solution, then
there comes the crucial step which some
creative thinkers have spoken of as in-
spiration.
"5) ... a man can know his experi-
ences as items of thought: he has sensa-
tions, he invents a relationship between
sensations, and then invents another." lu
These statements seem only indirectly
to suggest individualism as a significant
contributor to creativity. Possibly this
is only because this term did not occur
to the researchers, for individualism
seems to run "through and through" in
these thoughts. Indeed, if we take the
liberty of interpreting "recognition of
the disturbing elment" as dissast if action
with the status quo, and "stimulation of
our sensibility to dissatisfaction" as an
awakening of nonconformity, these find-
ings coincide perfectly with our hypoth-
esis. (Individualism and nonconformity
are not synonyms, but they are so nearly
coincident concepts that our other nec-
essary assumptions eclipse these semantic
differences.)
Statist Politics Versus Minority Rights
"We must ask whether, as we look
hack over the ground we have traversed,
we can discern any master tendency at
work, and we do descry a tendency toward
standardization and uniformity, a tend-
ency which is the correlative and oppo-
site of the tendency towards differentia-
tion and diversity which we have found
to be the mark of growth of civilizations"
—Arnold Toynbee.
All governments are inimical to indi-
vidualism.
"Government of the people, by the
people, for the people" is also govern-
ment of the consensus, by the consensus,
for the consensus. The ideas which be-
come law in a democracy are the ideas
which are most widely held. Our
laws tend to fix these ideas permanently.
Popular government is an inbreeder of
custom and thought. Democratic govern-
ments pass many bad laws, and they
repeal few. (I do not question but that
democracy is more desirable than the
alternatives, however—I merely think
we should examine all institutions peri-
odically).
For example, the provincials who con-
trol the legislature of Michigan peren-
nially jeopardize the position of excel-
lence held by this University by their
parsimonious handling of her financial
needs. Perhaps the lawmakers are justi-
fied in spending t he money where the
immediate benefits will be more wide-
spread. But there is another possible
solution to the problem of 'the greatest
good to the largest number for the long-
est time." To suggest such a thing may
be heresy, but a case can be made for the
justice of minority supremacy. Consider
the conversation of Raskolnikov and
Razumihin in Dostoyevsky's Crime and
Punishment. In seeking a rationale for
his axe-slaying of the pawnbroker
Alyona Ivanova, Raskolnikov speaks elo-
quently for the special rights of superior
individuals.
"There is, if you recall, a suggestion
that these are certain persons who can
. . . that is, not precisely are able to,
but have a perfect right to commit
breaches of morality and crimes, and
that the law is not for them. . . .
". . . extraordinary men have a right
to commit any crime and to transgress
the law in any way, just because they
are extraordinary.
"I maintain that if the discoveries of
Newton and Kepler could not have been
made known except by the sacrifice of
one, a dozen, a hundred or more men,
Newton would have had the right,
would indeed have been duty-bound . . .
to eliminate the dozen or the hundred
men for the sake of making his discover-
ies known to the whole of humanity.
"In short, I maintain that all great
men or even men a little out of the
common, that is to say capable of giving
some new word, must from their very
nature be criminals—more or less, of
course. Otherwise it's hard for them to
get out of the common rut; and to re-
main in the common rut is what they
can't submit to, from their very nature
again, and to my mind ought not, indeed,
to submit to it.
"I only believe that men are in gen-
eral divided by a law of nature into
two categories, inferior (ordinary), that
is to say, material that serves only to
reproduce its own kind, and men who
have the gift or talent to utter a new
word.
"The first category, generally speak-
ing, are men conservative in tempera-
ment and law-abiding; they live under
control and love to be controlled. . . .
". . . People with new ideas, people
with the faintest capacity for saying
something new, are extremely few in
number, extraordinarily so in fact. One
thing only is clear, that the appearance
of all these grades of men must follow
with unfailing regularity some law of
nature.""
If Raskolnikov is correct, then an
entirely different ethical code applies to
the superior individual, the nonconform-
ist. He who thinks differently, who is
capable of benefitting mankind through
his superiority, is morally bound to
minority rights and duties which trans-
cent commonness and conformity. To
such individuals, no government but
anarchy applies—not democracy, even
less socialism or communism.
Jefferson's natural aristocracy hypothe-
sis is borne out by this.
Illustration—The Federal Trade
Commission
Occasionally a voice of reason arises
from the depths of the Federal bureau-
cracy, marking an individual who has
not capitulated to the heavy seas of
conformity and the tyranny of red tape.
Lowell B. Mason, who has spent more
than a decade as a Federal Trade Com-
missioner, is one such individual.
Mason's book, The Language of
Dissent, analyses the dangers inherent
in our topheavy system of government.
According to Mason, topheavy govern-
ment, "Big Brother in Washington", is
as much a threat to individualism and
individual liberty as are the threats aris-
ing in the private sphere:
"The most effective way peaceful
totalitarianism can be achieved in the
U. S. is through complete government
control of the common everyday acts of
all people.

SOLID-STATE TRAVELING-WAVE MASERS
A recent addition to the field of low-noise devices is the maser (microwave amplifica-
tion by the stimulated emission of radiation), which can generate or amplify very high
frequency signals while adding but little noise.
The development of the solid-state ruby maser has permitted great advances to be
made in the design of low-noise receivers for radar and radio telescope systems. The first
ruby maser was operated at the University of Michigan Willow Run Laboratories and con-
sisted of a ruby crystal in a resonant cavity operating near 10 kilomegacycles. Since
that time a great deal of research has been carried on both at the Willow Run Laboratories
and in the Electron Physics Laboratory of the Department of Electrical Engineering on such
items as broadband cavities, room-temperature masers, low-magnetic-field masers, and
traveling-wave masers.
The solid-state maser generally requires a large magnetic field and operates at liquid
helium temperatures (4.5° Kelvin) and hence its use is restricted to cases where these in-
conveniences are justified. Present research is involved with the development of closed,
compact, cryogenic systems and the use of superconductor electromagnets. Further re-
search on solid-state materials can be expected to result in low-noise masers operating in
the millimeter wavelength regions.
In the figure above a laboratory experimental system is shown in which a traveling-
wave maser has been operated at 10 kilomegacycles. Gains of 30 db and instantaneous
bandwidths of 35 megacycles can be achieved in this system. The traveling-wave maser can
be turned over several hundred megacycles in the 10 kilomegacycle region.

Figure 7. When the voltage source is
connected as shown, holes move to the
right and free electrons to the left in
their respective regions.
This positive charge exerts an attractive
force on the electrons. Thus, the more
the electrons move to the left, the greater
the force pulling them to the right.
Similarly, in the P region the "holes"
move toward the negative terminal but
in doing so, they leave a net negative
charge on the left side of the P region.
Thus the more the "holes" move to the
right, the greater the force pulling them
to the left. When the voltage is con-
nected as in Figure 7 we say the junc-
tion is "reverse biased".
If the voltages are now reversed as in
Figure 8, we find that current flows. This
is because the free electrons in the N
region move away from the negative
terminal and cross the junction into the
P region. In the P region they combine
with a "hole" to complete a covalent
bond. When this occurs a bond near the
positive terminal breaks down and an
electron leaves the crystal. The resulting
"hole" moves away from the positive
terminal and toward the junction where
it is in turn filled by an electron. This
is a case of "forward bias".
It is now obvious that a junction of N
and P type semiconductors is capable of
rectification (i.e., allowing current to
pass in one direction only). A junction
of this type is called a junction diode or
semiconductor diode.

It has been observed that when a P-
type semiconductor and an N-type semi-
conductor are placed together a current
will flow through the combination only if
a voltage source is connected in such a
way that the positive terminal is con-
nected to the P-type and the negative
terminal to the N-type. The electrons in
this case flow from the N to the P-type.
If we now place three semiconductors
together as shown in Figure 9, we know
that electrons can flow across the junc-
tions only in the direction from the N to
the P-type.
If we now connect two voltage sources
as shown in Figure 10, we see that cur-
rent can flow only in circuit A.
If, however, the P-type semiconductor
is made very thin and the voltage sources
are again connected as in Figure 10, we

shown in Figure 7, we get a current

tors together, electrons flow across
junctions from N-type to P-type.
find that only about 5% of the electrons
crossing from the left hand N region
into the P region combine with "holes".
The remaining 95% of the electrons are
attracted by the positive voltage of term-
inal (3) and pass through the P region
before they have a chance to combine
with "holes".
In the arrangement of Figure 10, elec-
trons can easily flow from the left hand
N region into the P region. This means
that the resistance of terminal (2) is
low. We saw above that about 95% of
the electrons entering the semiconductor
at terminal (1) passed through into the
right hand N region. This occurred as
long as terminal (3) was positive regard-
less of the resistance in circuit B. There-
fore, we can place a large resistance in
circuit B without changing anything else.
We see now that a current passing
through a small resistance is transferred
into almost the same current passing
through a much larger resistance. Thus,
Figure 10. By connecting two voltage
sources in this manner, we have what
is called a transfer-resistor or trans-
istor.
this device is called a transfer-resistor or
more commonly a transistor.
The Transistor Amplifier
It is now easy to explain how a trans-
istor can be used as an amplifier. Sup-
pose the circuit is set up as in Figure
11. An alternating voltage (E) to be
amplified is placed in circuit (A). In
circuit (B) is placed a large resistor. Now
a small change in £ will cause a large
change in the current (since the input
resistance is small). About 95% of this
change in current will flow through R
causing a much larger change in voltage
across R than occurred acoss E in the
first place.
As an example, suppose the input
resistance equals one ohm and the resist-
ance in the output circuit (R2) equals
100 ohms. Then using Ohm's law:
E
I = —, a change in the input voltage
R
(E) of one volt would produce a change
lv
in the input current of — 1 amp.
Now 95% of this one amp (or .95 amp)
flows thru R2. Again using Ohm's law,
now in the form E = IR, we see that the
voltage across R2 is .95 X 10° ~ 95V.
Thus we have amplified our signal by
a factor of 95.

Figure II. If the circuit is set up in
this manner, the transistor will act as
an amplifier.

Consulting Engineers and Contractors: Klug &amp; Smith Co., Milwaukee, Wis.
To control its 15 miles of piping
Mirro chose JENKINS VALVES
With a trademark that promises the finest aluminum prod-
ucts, Mirro Aluminum Co. wanted the most trusted trade-
mark in the valve world as an assurance of reliability for the
complex piping system in its new $12,000,000 rolling mill
in Manitowoc, Wisconsin.
There are over 15 miles of piping in this huge new mill that
can produce 60,000,000 pounds of aluminum foil and sheets
a year. But there will be no valve problems ... no avoidable
valve maintenance and replacement expense on these lines.
Mirro made sure of that by installing Jenkins Valves
throughout the system.
There's no point in gambling with valve problems when you
can have the known reliability and trouble-saving quality of
Jenkins Valves, without paying extra for the protection.

INDIVIDUALISM &amp; NATURAL SUPERIORITY
We're not looking for a
direct answer.
This is just to remind you
that a good knowledge of
miniaturization is worth having
— wherever you go in the
world of engineering.
Keeping engineering minds
well-informed on the latest
progress in — and with —
MPB miniature and instrument
bearings is one of our main
objectives. MPB bearings are
made in over 500 types and
sizes, with O.D.'s from 5/8"
to l/lOff. They are used in
over 16,000 applications,
ranging from dental
handpieces to missile systems.
Magnificent Miniatures,
a 16mm color and sound film,
pictures the manufacture and
uses of MPB bearings. The new
comprehensive MPB catalog
with basic engineering informa-
tion, describes the complete
line and many applications.
Both are available to your
class or group, without charge,
from Miniature Precision
Bearings, Inc., 22 Precision
Park, Keene, N. H.
(Continued from page 39)

Helps you perform
miracles in miniaturization
"Today, a series of administrative court
decisions are being quietly built up in the
world of commerce which may provide
future precedents for tyranny in every
phase of a man's life.
"We need a serious and perhaps tire-
some audit to see how many liberties are
being carried on our books as assets
which we really do not own any more. . .
"Mason's law holds that bureaucracy
will arrogate to itself all power available
under a statute in spite of the limitations
against tyranny in the Constitution. . .
This it will do quietly and unobtrusively,
through decisions at the lowest rung of
the judicial ladder where the issue seldom
meets the public eye." 12
This is only one example of the way
that government erodes individualism.
For a more lucid example, consider the
Chinese people, who have been reduced
to the level of a giant ant colony by
statist policies.
We do not choose to discuss the rela-
tive merits of political systems—merely
to indicate that a minimal dose of govern-
ment seems to give the most favorable
clime for individualism.
Illustration—"The Ebb Tide of
Freedom 13
Professor William Kilpatrick of Co-
lumbia University, a leader of progressive
education, wrote, "A fundamental re-
making of our economic system seems to
be in order so that men will no longer
be compelled to work against each other
but may rather be encouraged and per-
mitted—and if a recalcitrant minority
requires it, be compelled—to cooperate
for the common good."
Apparently Prof. Kilpatrick does not
esteem personal liberty to be essential to
"the common good".
This philosophy may have been what
Benjamin Franklin was referring to
when he said, "Those who would give
up liberty for a little temporary security
deserve neither liberty nor security".
From time to time we have made
references to the natural differences be-
tween individuals. This inference seems
well-supported by omnipresent facts.
However, there is another natural phe-
nomenon, which has recently been dis-
covered and is yet little-known, which
might make an amusing, if irrelevant,
closing to this paper—or is it so irrele-
vant?
Individualism as a Cosmic Law
Individualism is a cosmic law. Rela-
tivity has junked the Newtonian con-
cept of the Universe as a mechanistic
system of causes and effects, action and
reaction. Bodies, it seems, behave due to
their own properties, and not because of
environmental circumstances.
This is the essence of these sentences
from the chapter entitled, "The Abolition
of Force" in Bertrand Russell's book,
The ABC of Relativity:
"It has been customary for people to
draw arguments from the laws of nature
as to what we ought to do. Such argu-
ments seem to me a mistake: to imitate
nature may be merely slavish. But if na-
ture, as portrayed by Einstein, is to be
our model, it would seem that the anarch-
ists will have the best of the argument.
The physical universe is orderly, not
because there is a central government,
but because every body minds its own
business." 13

Fafnir Ball Bearings help turbojets
set new performance records
A recent article in a leading newspaper quoted
airline executives to the effect that Pratt and
Whitney Aircraft jet engines are proving to be
the most reliable ever put into commercial
planes.
In designing these Jet engines, Pratt &amp;
Whitney Aircraft looked to The Fafnir Bearing
Company as a major source for main rotor
thrust bearings, generally regarded as among
the critical engine components, and one of the
most exacting to produce. Each ball bearing is
custom-built and rigorously tested. Tolerances
are held to the millionths-of-an-inch.
P&amp;WA turned to Fafnir because of Fafnir's
long experience in the design and development
of aircraft bearings. Fafnir established an air-
craft division thirty years ago, the first In the
industry, and through it, is keeping pace with
the revolutionary changes in aircraft design.
To help solve this and other ball bearing
problems, Fafnir maintains the most up-to-date
facilities for metallurgical research, and bear-
ing development and testing. Fafnir may be
able to help you some day. Worth bearing in

MICHIGAN - EDUCATION AND RESEARCH
(Continued from page 55)
Computing at Michigan
Prof. Donald L. Katz, University of
Michigan engineering faculty member,
is enthusiastic about the early introduc-
tion of computer techniques to engin-
eering students.
For the past year, the U-M has car-
ried out a project in this area, and in
some cases, the problems were too ele-
mentary for the students. Some 60 U-M
courses, including 49 in engineering, used
the computer as a regular part of course
instruction in the past year, Prof. Katz
explained.
The U-M experience shows that with
a very small amount of computer back-
ground, students were able to do the
problems assigned.
Effects of the Computer on
Education
Assistant Prof. Bernard A. Galler, a
research associate in the U-M Comput-
ing Center, believes Computers are effect-
ing the education of both undergradu-
ate and graduate students in the univer-
sities, particularly in the engineering
fields. He said "Recognition of the role
of electronic computers in scientific re-
search and education has led to the use
of these machines even for homework
problems.
"Along with this trend, one sees a rec-
ognition of the need for more mathema-
tics; in partciular, logic and statistics,"
Galler said. "These developments art
being felt even in the high schools where
teaching of logic and statistics has al-
ready been introduced in many cities."
Galler explained that "there are many
facets to the computer, such as the use
of binary, octal, and hexadecimal number
systems in many computers, the use of
symboloc logic in the design of circuits,
and the growing use of statistical and
numerical analysis methods in the solu-
tion of problems on the computer.
"Some day the computer itself may be
a subject of a course in the high schools,"
Galler said. "Even now it is opening up
new areas of interest which the high
school teacher would do well to learn
about. The computer can serve very well
as a topic of discussion and exploration—
an 'enrichment topic'—for mathematics
clubs and advanced students."
Prof. Emeritus Alfred H. Lovell of
The University of Michigan died Oct.
27 at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital follow-
ing a brief illness. He was 76.
Former chairman of the Department ol
Electrical Engineering, Professor Lovell

served continuously until his retirement
in 1954.

preferably...
a big FISH in the right-sized STREAM
O
We've been told frequently that engineering graduates are attracted to a
company our size because o!' an honest and understandable desire to be
"a big fish in a little pond*'. Perhaps others prefer to think, of the future as
the challenge of "swimming up-stream".
We believe that Sikorsky Aircraft is actually the "right-sized stream" for
young engineers who would enjoy diversified, small-group activities, as
well as stature opportunities in a field that is not limited nor professionally
confining. Sikorsky Aircraft is the company which pioneered the modern
helicopter; and our field today is recognized as one of the broadest and most
challenging in the entire aircraft industry.
Because of this, we can offer stimulating experiences in an ideal environ-
ment. Work associations could include joining an electronic team of twenty
to thirty associates—or—working with a highly selective group of four or
five on interesting problems of radiation, instrumentation, auto pilotage,
automatic stabilization, etc.
And what of your future?
That, of course, involves your own potential for growth. As
a far-sighted company, we're more than willing to help you
meet the challenge of "going up-stream"!

Something has been added to the
Teasers this month, something everyone
wants—Money. The first person submit-
ting the correct answers, including the
method of solution to the SIX Decem-
ber Technic Teasers, will be given a prize
of five dollars. In the event of a tie, the
earlier postmark will win. If a tie still
exists the winners can split the loot.
All entries must be in by January 5,
1961. All Technic members are excluded
from this contest.
1) A man stakes 1/m of his fortune
on each play of a game whose probability
is 1/2- He tr'es again and again, each
time staking 1/m of what he possesses.
After 2n games he has won n times and
lost n times. What is the result?
2) A man has 64 pounds of sand. He
needs only to use only 50 pounds, but
what he uses must be a representative
sample of all the sand. He has a riffle
which splints any amount of sand into
two representative samples of the same
weight. What is the least number of
times he must use the riffle to obtain his
50 pounds of sand?
3) Eight men entered a recent tennis
tournament at Hillcrest. The tournament
was played in 3 consecutive days, one
round a day, and happily no match was
defaulted. The first and second round
matches were stipulated to be two sets
out of three, while the final match was
three sets out of five. A spectator who
was present on all 3 days reported the
following facts:
A) Eggleston never met Haverford.
B) Before play began, Gormley re-
marked to Bancroft, "I see that
we meet in the finals."
c) Chadwick won a set at love but
lost his first match.
D) Altogether 150 games were played,
of which the losers won 43.
E) When the pairings were posted,
Abercrombie said to Devereaux,
"Do you concede, or do you
want to play it out?"
F) On the second day, the first-round
losers played bridge, and the
same table gathered on the third
with Eggleston in place of Aber-
crombie.
G) Bancroft won nine games.
H) Franklin won 37 games.
I) The first score of the tournament
was a service ace by Gormley, at
which Eggleston shouted, "Hey,
I'm not over there!"
Who won the tournament? Whom did
he beat and by what score?
4) A group of heirs divide their heri-
tage as follows: The first takes a dollar
and the Nth part of the remainder, the
second takes 2A dollars and the Nth
part of the remainder, and so on, each
succeeding heir taking a dollar more than
his predecessor and an Nth part of the
new remainder. In this manner the heri-
tage is divided into equal parts. How
many heirs are there, and how much does
each receive?
5) We have three cards that are col-
ored as follows; one has both sides red,
another has both sides white, and the
third has one side red and the other side
white. You reach into a hat holding these
three cards, draw one out and lay it on
the table. You find yourself looking at a
red face. Your roommate offers you a
bet on what the color of the other face
of the card. However, you want to know
the probability of the other face being
red. His roommate didn't know the an-
swer. What is the answer?
6) If a tree 30 inches in diameter has
a notch cut to the center, what is the
volume of the wood removed if the lower
plane of the notch is horizontal and the
upper plane makes an angle of 45 de-
grees with the lower plane? What as-
sumption must be made to do this prob-
lem?

Research Scientists Propose New
Theory for Rusting of Iron
Scientists at the Westinghouse Research
Laboratories have advanced a new basic
explanation for the corrosion of iron—
estimated to waste some $6 billion to
$7 billion per year in the United States
alone. Westingthouse researchers, Dr.
Earl A. Gulbransen and T. P. Copan,
suggest for the first time that the true
culprits are hydrogen ions, or protons—
one of the basic building blocks of
matter.
The hydrogen ions come from water
vapor, which must be present if iron is
to rust to any great extent at room temp-
erature. Their theory suggests that the
tiny hydrogen particles penetrate the iron
and enlarge the sites at which oxygen
normally combines with the metal. This
spreads the reaction throughout the sur-
face of the iron, causing it to rust destruc-
tively.
Until now, a "standard" explanation
for iron corrosion is that it is an electro-
chemical reaction, somewhat similar to
that which occurs in an ordinary battery.
Tiny local areas on the surface of the
metal are assumed to act as plus and
minus electrical terminals under the in-
fluence of an invisible liquid film of
water, generating minute electric currents
that corrode the iron. The new theory
suggests that something more fundamen-
tal takes place in the iron, even though

Edited by CHARLES MASSER
an electrochemical reaction also may be
present.
In a series of experiments that elim-
inated the conditions required for elec-
trochemical reactions, the Westinghouse
scientists reduced the complex rusting
of iron to its simplest atomic processes.
Pure iron wires about as thick as a fine
sewing thread were reacted with oxygen
and water vapor at high temperatures
(835 degrees Fahrenheit) under closely
controlled, idealized conditions. The re-
sults of the minute-scale corrosion were
studied under an electron microscope
capable of magnifying objects up to
300,000 times.
The scientists report that with dry
oxygen the iron forms a protective oxide
coating from which grow billions of tiny-
round oxide whiskers less than one-
millionth of an inch in diameter and
30-millionths of an inch high. Each
whisker grows from a single, specific
growth side on the wire's surface, much
as individual seeds sprout from the
ground into separate plant stems. Then
the wires were reacted under identical
conditions except that water vapor was
substituted for the dry oxygen atmos-
phere.
The moisture produces a startling
change in the oxide surface. From the
When iron is placed in a dry oxygen
atmosphere it forms a protective oxide
coating from which tiny whiskers grow.
Each whisker is less than one-millionth
of an inch in diameter and 30-millionths
of an inch high.

shaped platelets of iron oxide that spread
across the metal surface. Shaped some-
what like blades of grass, they are about
one-millionth of an inch thick, 30-mill-
ionths of an inch wide and 300-millionths
of an inch high. As they grow in size,
they spread more than 50 times in area
over the sites observed for dry oxygen
alone, reaching a density of nearly one
billion per square inch of surface area.
The amount of iron rust they represent is
250 times that which forms when the
water vapor, and the hydrogen ions it
releases, are absent from the reaction.
The experiments by the Westinghouse
scientists show that less than one part
of water vapor in 200 parts of the dry
oxygen atmosphere will cause the blade-
shaped crystals to form. At room temper-
ature this would correspond to a relative
humidity of about three percent.
"We conclude that the hydrogen ions
in the water vapor enlarge the areas of
chemical reaction between the oxygen
and iron and bring about the metal's
greatly increased corrosion," Dr. Gulbran-
sen declared ."At the lower temperatures
at which iron usually rusts, this basic
reaction is masked. Complex corrosion
products are formed and are not stable,
and the corroding metal is often re-
moved from the reaction site. Once such
basic understanding is at hand, we should
be able to do a much better job of con-
trolling corrosion. Already we can iden-
tify two control measures which must be
considered in addition to any electro-
chemical effects that are involved in iron
rusting: Hydrogen must be prevented
from entering the metal, and the growth
of the localized reaction sites must be in-
hibited by the addition of suitable alloy-
ing elements to the iron."
Heat Lamps Aid Space Program
by Simulating Thermal Barrier
The "thermal barrier," a major ob-
stacle to man's successful venture into
space, is being overcome with the aid of
a modern, sophisticated version of the
common light bulb. William F. Hodge,
engineer for General Electric, described
the device as a tubular, pencil-thin quartz
infrared lamp, capable of producing the-
intense concentrations of energy required
to simulate heating conditions which
exist when a space vehicle enters the
earth's atmosphere.
By pre-testing the heat resistance of
materials, structural parts, models or
whole structures of missiles, space

NASA's Langley Research Center in Virginia. Heat produced in the cylindrical
radiator reaches 3100° F., about a third as hot as the surface of the sun.
vehicles and aircraft, the nation is able
to facilitate its program in these fields.
Temperatures of more than 3000 de-
grees Fahrenheit, about one-third the
temperature of the surface of the sun,
are being created by closely arrayed banks
of the tubular lamps in overvoltage
operation.
The fast heating and cooling char-
acteristics and low thermal capacity of
quartz infrared lamps make them "by
far the most satisfactory device" for
thermal barrier simulation.
Temperatures in this work must be
varied rapidly and controlled accurately
to produce the same temperature con-
ditions actual missiles would develop in
passing through various regions of the
earth's atmosphere.
The maximum wattage a quartz lamp
can withstand is determined by the
melting point (about 6100° F.) of the
tungsten filament. Lamps designed for
200 watts per inch, now being used in
thermal barrier simulation, have been
operated successfully for a few seconds at
1000 watts per inch.
Engineers revealed that a new lamp
now under development is designed to
operate at 360 watts per inch but is
capable of operating at as high as 1500
watts per inch for very short periods.
The operating life of quartz infrared
lamps of the type used in aircraft and
missile structure testing recently had b:en
improved by using platinum lead-in wires.
While oxidation causes the standard seal
with molybdenum lead-in wires, to break
down at 650°F., the new seal will last
for 100 hours or more at temperatures of
around 1500 degrees.
Russians to Warm Arctic
Soviet scientists reportedly have a
plan to defrost the Arctic. The Russians
think it feasible to thaw a northern sea
route through the ice by means of a
space belt of potassium particles which
would act as a giant reflector for the
sun.

slightly more than two years, is expected
to yield precise facts about the relation-
ship between vibration and efficient hu-
man performance. This information can
then be used by design engineers work-
ing on aircraft and space ships of the
future.
The program is the first to explore
systematically the work performance in a
vibration environment approximating the
frequencies and amplitudes encountered
in actual operation of aircraft and other
vehicles.
Volunteers taking part in the studies
will be instrumented so that necessary
medical data can be obtained. Five vibra-
tion levels that will be measured in the
initial phase of the study are broadly de-
fined as barely perceptible, definitely per-
ceptible, annoying, maximum under which
a man could work for a long period of
time and the maximum for very brief,
efficient performance.
During an actual vibration test, start-
ing at a low frequency and building up,
the subject will push a button whenever
he thinks he has reached any one of these
five levels. His verbal opinions will be
recorded throughout each test.
In initial testing, the subjects will have
no tasks to perform other than to relate
their opinions of what effect the vibra-
tions have on their performance. Later,
however, certain tasks will be assigned.
Accomplishments of those tasks will then
be measured against the subject's earlier
opinions.
Vibrations, produced by a hydraulic
cylinder, will be between 1 and 30
cycles per second and within amplitudes
up to 10 inches at the lowest frequencies
and only about five hundredths of an
inch in the upper levels.

One of a series
t Several surveys indicate that salary is
not the primary contributor to job
satisfaction. Nevertheless, salary con-
siderations will certainly play a big
part in your evaluation of career op-
portunities. Perhaps an insight into the
salary policies of a large employer of
engineers like General Electric will
help you focus your personal salary
objectives.
Salary—a most individual and per-
sonal aspect of your job—is difficult to
discuss in general terms. While recog-
nizing this, Mr. Case has tried answering
as directly as possible some of your
questions concerning salary:
Q Mr. Case, what starting salary does
your company pay graduate engineers?
A Well, you know as well as I that
graduates' starting salaries are greatly
influenced by the current demand for
engineering talent. This demand es-
tablishes a range of "going rates" for
engineering graduates which is no doubt
widely known on your campus. Be-
cause General Electric seeks outstand-
ing men, G-E starting salaries for these
candidates lie in the upper part of the
range of "going rates." And within
General Electric's range of starting sal-
aries, each candidate's ability and
potential are carefully evaluated to de-
termine his individual starting salary.
Q How do you go about evaluating
my ability and potential value to your
company?
A We evaluate each individual in the
light of information available to us:
type of degree; demonstrated scholar-
ship; extra-curricular contributions; work
experience; and personal qualities as
appraised by interviewers and faculty
members. These considerations deter-
mine where within G.E.'s current sal-
ary range the engineer's starting salary
will be established.
Interview with
General Electric's Byron A, Case
Manager—Employee Compensation Service
Your Salary
at General Electric
Q When could I expect my first salary
increase from General Electric and how
much would it be?
A Whether a man is recruited for a
specific job or for one of the principal
training programs for engineers—the
Engineering and Science Program, the
Manufacturing Training Program, or
the Technical Marketing Program—his
individual performance and salary are
reviewed at least once a year.
For engineers one year out of col-
lege, our recent experience indicates a
first-year salary increase between 6 and
15 percent. This percentage spread re-
flects the individual's job performance
and his demonstrated capacity to do
more difficult work. So you see, salary
adjustments reflect individual perform-
ance even at the earliest stages of
professional development. And this
emphasis on performance increases
as experience and general competence
increase.
Q How much can I expect to be making
after five years with General Electric?
A As I just mentioned, ability has a
sharply increasing influence on your
salary, so you have a great deal of per-
sonal control over the answer to your
question.
It may be helpful to look at the cur-
rent salaries of all General Electric
technical-college graduates who re-
ceived their bachelor's degrees in 1954
(and now have five years' experience).
Their current median salary, reflect-
ing both merit and economic changes,
is about 70 percent above the 1954
median starting rate. Current salaries
for outstanding engineers from this
class are more than double the 1954
median starting rates and, in some
cases, are three or four times as great.
Q What kinds of benefit programs
does your company offer, Mr. Case?
A Since I must be brief, I shall merely
outline the many General Electric em-
ployee benefit programs. These include
a liberal pension plan, insurance plans,
an emergency aid plan, employee dis-
counts, and educational assistance pro-
grams.
The General Electric Insurance Plan
has been widely hailed as a "pace
setter" in American industry. In addi-
tion to helping employees and their
families meet ordinary medical expen-
ses, the Plan also affords protection
against the expenses of "catastrophic"
accidents and illnesses which can wipe
out personal savings and put a family
deeply in debt. Additional coverages in-
clude life insurance, accidental death
insurance, and maternity benefits.
Our newest plan is the Savings and
Security Program which permits em-
ployees to invest up to six percent of
their earnings in U.S. Savings Bonds
or in combinations of Bonds and Gen-
eral Electric stock. These savings are
supplemented by a Company Propor-
tionate Payment equal to 50 percent
of the employee's investment, subject
to a prescribed holding period.

assortment of machines with which doctors hope to write a bright
new chapter in the history of man's fight against childhood diseases.
The machines are: A fluoroscope which uses lower radiation
intensities...to lower the exposure of the human body. A new
light amplifying system which makes the image from the fluoroscope
50,000 times brighter. And a TV camera which picks up the image as
a moving picture and records it on video tape. This can be played
back again and again until the trouble is diagnosed, or put on

Bendix answers your questions
WILL I BE PUT INTO
A TALENT POOL?
Depending on the company you join, your first assignment can range
from detailing to full participation, as a team member, in solving
a complex major systems problem.
Exactly where you will fit in depends on a number of
things, such as: (1) your ability; (2) the existing
opportunities; and (3) the amount of responsibility
your company is willing to give you.
Some employers actually have a "talent pool"
arrangement, where you will bide your time while
the company "orients" you, or looks you over.
At Bendix, engineers are hired to do specific engineering
jobs. We have long been devoted to the principle of
"maximum skill utilization." Engineers are not placed
in talent pools at Bendix.
We feel that it is wasteful to all concerned when a man
works below his ability and capacity. Ask your Placement
Director about Bendix—where you can build your
career to suit your talents. Arrange for an interview
with a Bendix representative; ask him about your
probable first assignment. You will be surprised at how
completely it can be defined. Or, write to C. A. Cleveland,

MEANS AND GOALS
A recent crusade by the Michigan Daily has once again brought
the subject of the non-technical education of engineers into the
campus spotlight. Although the quasi-muckraking style of an am-
bitious would-be journalist was the vehicle for this article-editorial
series (The headline "Engineering English Stirs Controversy should
have read "Michigan Daily Stirs Controversy), we do find ourselves
in agreement with one of the two stated premises. In the series
the Daily author has voiced a plea for increased study by engineers
in the humanistic-social science area. At the same time it is strongly
implied that no steps can be made in this direction until the English
departments of the Engineering and L.S.A. colleges have been com-
bined.
We wholeheartedly agree with the argument for increased non-
technical courses for engineers, as evidenced by recent Technic
editorials. However, we do not agree that it necessarily follows
that in order to achieve these goals the two English departments
must be combined. Later this may prove to be an advantageous step
but the important point now is to convince the students, faculty, and
administration of the College of Engineering that a broader educa-
tional foundation for engineering students is highly desirable. At
the present time this conviction does not exist to any degree in the
College of Engineering. This, in itself, is the problem we face today.
What many have failed to realize, including the Daily, is that any
attempt to link this problem with certain means of implementation
(i.e.—combining the English departments) is likely to bring un-
favorable results.
Therefore, while reserving judgement on the means, we would
like to reemphasize our attitude towards a broadened educational
base for engineers with this statement from the Humanistic-Social
Research Report of the American Society for Engineering Education:
.... (engineering) students would profit—as pro-
fessional men, as citizens, and as individuals—from a fuller
acquaintance with the resources of the humanities and the
social sciences.
FOUNDATIONS OF FREEDOM
Throughout the semester we have been watching a series of
threats, charges, and public statements fly back and forth between
Wayne State University and some members of the state legislature.
All of these statements have centered around WSU's decision in
September to lift a 10-year old ban on Communist and other outside
speakers. Most of the statements seem to be the result of a misunder-
standing of just what constitutes the new policy but some of the
statements have resulted from an apparent lack of understanding
of the fundamental reasons behind such a policy.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The first misunderstanding stems from the opinion that people
will be allowed to spread vicious propaganda advocating the over-
throw of the government. However, WSU President Clarence B.
Hilberry has repeatedly stated that "nothing could be further from
the truth. All the safeguards have been set up to prevent propa-
ganda of any kind being preached." He has also pointed out that
"a Roman Catholic priest would have as much trouble getting to
speak propaganda at Wayne as a Communist would get, and neither
one of them would be allowed to speak." Thus the policy becomes
one of allowing the free flow of ideas but also one of not allowing
any type of propaganda which might undermine our democratic
way of life.
The misunderstanding of what the WSU policy says is under-
standable and forgiveable. It even becomes insignificant beside the
fundamental lack of understanding of democracy that has been
exhibited by some people, including a number of state legislators.
What they fail to realize is that if, in the long run, democracy is to
survive we must allow the free and open debate of all ideas, no
matter how contrary to our own beliefs they may be. Only in so
doing will the falsehoods be separated from the truth.
What is more important, the legislators and others do not under-
stand that once certain limits are placed on the Constitution and the
Bill of Rights, for any reason,, the way has been cleared for real
dangers to our democratic system. In an attempt to eliminate some
dangers that may exist in a free, open society the door is opened to
the much greater dangers of a capitive, closed society. It is the lack
of realization of these facts that is the saddest part of the whole
situation.
FINAL EVALUATION
On the editorial pages of this and the previous seven issues, it
has been our goal to stimulate the thinking of engineers on topics
of importance to them as engineers and/or as individuals. Conse-
quently, the discussion has been centered on such subjects as the
preparation of engineers as men as well as technicians, the role
engineers might play in the developing nations of the world, and a
continual urging of engineers to participate fully in such campus
educational activities as Challenge and the SGC reading program.
To a large extent these efforts have probably not been overly
successful. This is due at least partially to the prevailing concept on
this campus that engineers can not or should not, be concerned or
think about anything other than technically oriented subjects. Our
only hope is that, to some extent, we have aided in obliterating this
false concept.
In any event, this issue marks the change-over point on the
Tecbnic editorial staff. Starting with the next issue, concern for this
page, and we hope for the future of engineers and engineering as
well, becomes the responsibility of Editor-in-Chief-Designate Bryan
R. R. Whipple.

NEW POLYMERS
CHALLENGE RUBBER
Natural rubber has finally yielded to scientific
synthesis. Using the type of polymerization pro-
cesses developed for plastics, the rubber indus-
try is going into large-scale production of new
synthetics.
by BENSON SHAPIRO
The Phillips Chemical Com-
pany's Copolymer Plant near Bor-
ger, Texas, produces 118,500
long tons of synthetic rubber an-
nually. This is enough rubber for
22,100,000 passenger car tires.

Company.
Presently, plants capable of pro-
ducing close to one half billion
pounds of synthetic rubber per year are
being constructed or planned. A new
surge of growth has suddenly come about
in this young expanding industry. The
cause—the stereo specifics.
The stereo specifics are polybutadiene
and polyisoprene. The name stereo speci-
fic is derived from the catalysts used in
the production of the new synthetics.
Earlier Synthetics
Previous synthetics did not resemble
natural rubber. In fact, their properties
were quite different from the tree pro-
duct, necessitating the continued use of
natual rubber in spite of its disadvan-
tages. In contrast, polybutadiene closely
resembles natural rubber, and polyisop-
rene is almost an exact replica of the
natural structure, which is also based on
isoprene.
The first synthetic rubber was invented
in Europe over eighty years ago. This was
merely a laboratory curiosity. It was not
until World War I that a large scale pro-
duction of synthetic rubber came about.
Germany, cut off from its supply of nat-
ural rubber, was forced to resort to syn-
thetics. They used methyl rubber pre-
pared from 2, 3-dimethylbutadiene. This
synthetic, although not possessing good
qualities, served the purpose and proved
that large scale synthesis was possible.
The next developments in the industry
came in the 1930's when numerous types
of synthetics were introduced. Among
these were neoprene, Buna S, Butyl, and
G R-S. These products, many of which
were produced in large quantities in this
country during World War II, had a
variety of properties and a corresponding
variety of uses. But, synthetic rubber
could still not replace natural rubber.
The New Synthetics
Natural rubber was needed because of
its high heat resistance and high resili-
ence, properties which are attributed to its
regular configuration. Both polyisoprene
and polybutadiene exhibit these sam prop-
erties to some degree. The isoprene poly-
mer is, because of its close resemblance
to the natural product, superior to the
butadiene polymer in these properties.
Natural rubber is in many ways an un-
desirable raw material for important large
scale production. The price of natural
rubber has constantly fluctuated for the
last five years. These fluctuations have
ranged from fifty cents per pound down
to twenty-three and one-half cents per
pound. This has caused many shifts in re-
tail prices, profit, and production. The
properties of natural rubber vary from
season to season, area to area, and even
from tree to tree. Each batch must there-
fore be processed in accordance with its
properties. This restricts the use of large-
scale fast moving production processes.
In addition, the natural product is usual-
ly contaminated with dust, bark, and
other foreign matter. Hence, it must un-

and consequently an added cost.
In contrast, the new synthetics possess
many properties which will enable them
to decrease production costs, and con-
sumer prices. The initial marketing price
will be about thirty-five cents per pound.
Once large scale production begins and
better methods are discovered, the price
will probably drop. Since they are pro-
duced under carefully controlled condi-
tions, their properties can easily be stan-
dardized and adjusted to meet require-
ments. Also because of production
methods, the purity can be simply con-
trolled, eliminating undesirable contam-
inators.
From a national security viewpoint,
the greatest disadvantage of natural rub-
ber is the difficulty in securing it. Major
production areas are Southeast Asia and
Liberia. South America also has some
large plantations. During wartime trans-
portation of the rubber from plantation
to American plants presents great prob-
lems. The long supply lines are extreme-
ly vulnerable. This problem caused the
federal government to initiate the syn-
thetic rubber programs of World War
II. The situation has worsened consider-
ably since then because of the unrest in
Southeast Asia. Even in times of relative
peace, we cannot be assured of a contin-
uous supply of rubber as long as we must
depend on unstable nations such as In-
donesia, which produces a large portion
of the world's supply of rubber. The
government therefore has been very
much interested in the production of
good substitutes for natural rubber.
The chemistry and consequently the
production of the stereo-specifics is vast-
ly different from that of the older syn-
thetics. Both of the new products close-
ly resemble the plastic polymers, poly-
ethylene and polybutadiene. The new
synthetics are produced by the use of
complex organometallic catalysts. These
catalysts are hydrocarbons combined with
metallic elements. Each catalyst produces
a specific type of polymer. Those used
for the two rubber polymers are Ziegler-
type or lithuim derived. The mechanism
of these catalysts is still one of natures
closely guarded secrets.
There is more than one type of polysio-
prene. The differences are in the con-
figuration of the molecules. The proper-
ties of the polymers are to a great ex-
tent dependent upon the configuration.
One problem in the production of poly-
isoprene is the difficulty in controlling the
molecular structure. Much research has
been done in this field, but more must be
done before an exact replica of natural
rubber can be synthetically created. For
the present, the very good approxima-
tions must do.
Polyisoprene, the synthetic almost ex-
actly like natural rubber, has many fine
properties. As stated before it has high
resilience and heat resistance. It can be
processed and cured just like natural rub-
ber if it is modified by the addition of
anti-oxidants, proteins, and fatty acids
which naturally occur in the tree product.
These substances also stabilize the poly-
mer. Polyisoprene is easily processed and
is in general suited to all uses of natural
rubber. In fact, in color and flow charac-
teristics it is superior to the natural pro-
duct.
Polybutadiene is cheaper than polyiso-
prene because its monomer is cheaper.
This, of course, gives the butadiene poly-
mer a definite business advantage. There
is a possibility that Shell Chemical will
be able to produce isoprene monomer
cheap enough to compete with butadiene.
Polybutadiene is difficult to process be-
cause of dryness and poor tack. How-
ever, blending it with natural rubber re-
sults in a mix of satisfactory heat re-
sistance, abrasion resistance and tensile
strength. Tires made of a 50-50 mix of
polybutadiene and natural rubber proved
comparable to those of natural rubber in
all respects. Also, polybutadiene's abra-
sion resistance makes it a good material
for conveyor belts and other such ap-
plication.
Development
Polyisoprene was developed by Good-
rich-Gulf Chemical Company, a com-
pany formed jointly by B. F. Goodrich
Rubber and Gulf Oil to enter the field
of synthetic rubber, in 1954. At about
the same time, Firestone probably de-
veloped a similiar process. Goodrich-
Gulf attempted to patent and more or
less monopolize the process. The Justice
Department sued Goodrich-Gulf on
the grounds that the process had been
developed under government research
grants and therefore was not completely
the property of Goodrich-Gulf. The mat-
ter was finally resolved by having the
company agree to license other manu-
facturers who want to use the process.
The polybutadiene process was brought
forth by Phillips Petroleum at about the

butadiene synthetic rubber.

same time as the polyisoprene one was
developed.
Business Aspects
Nine companies are either operating,
building, or considering building plants
to produce the stereo specifics. The first
companies to announce plans for pro-
duction plants were Phillips and Fire-
stone. Phillips is planning to produce
only polybutadiene. Their Borger, Texas
plant, scheduled to open about this
month, will have a capacity of twenty
thousand long tons per year. Firestone's
plant in Orange, Texas will produce thir-
ty thousand long tons of both synthetics.
It will go on stream next year.
Shell Chemical Company has at this
time the largest stake in the stereo speci-
fics. They surprised the entire industry
when their plant at Torrance, California,
began production of isoprene in 1959.
In addition, Shell is building a plant at
Marietta, Ohio, which will have a capa-
city of 90,000 long tons per year. This
plant, too, will produce only polyiso-
prene.
Other companies with plants under
construction are Goodyear, Goodrich-
Gulf, and American Rubber and Chemi-
cal Company, a combination of twenty-
nine firms with Stauffer Chemical Com-
pany possessing fifty percent. United
States Rubber, General Tire and Rubber,
and Texas-United States, a subsidiary of
both Texaco and United States Rubber,
are considering construction of plants.
Foreign Competition
In addition, Montecatini of Italy is
presently producing another stereospeci-
fic in semi-commercial quantities. The
synthetic, being produced at Farrara, Italy
is an ethylene isopropylene copolymer de-
veloped by Professors Karl Ziegler of
Germany and Giulio Natta of Italy. The
copolymer is produced from monomers
costing only from four to five cents per
pound, and will, therefore, have a defi-
nite price advantage over the other two
stereo specifics.
Russia has also developed a synthetic
rubber which is known to be based on
isoprene. Nothing is known of current
production.
In this country, the most surprising
feature of this new phase of the produc-
tion of synthetics is the tremendous
speed with which so many companies
have entered production. Each plant re-
presents a tremendous investment. But,
as in the chemical industry, the companies
in this industry cannot allow their com-
petitors to gain a research, production or
marketing advantage. In this fast moving
industry, hesitation can lead to financial
disaster. Because of the time lag between
research and large scale production, de-
cisions must be made quickly to prevent
a competitor from cornering the field and
building up an insurmountable advan-
tage.

A description of the remarkable system by
which bats locate objects as tiny as a gnat by
bouncing ultrasonic sounds off them.
by ROLAND SCHAEDIG
A study of the relationship between
the sounds which a bat emits and
its ability to detect objects involves
an interaction of the zoological and
physical sciences. This interaction may
not be as obvious as the influence of bird
flight on the development of the airplane;
however, the successful flight of bats has
wide implications, including the theory
of radar and sonar and the orientation of
blind men. A study of the bat's obstacle
detection will help us to see these in-
teractions more clearly.
In earlier years, zoological study was
greatly concerned with the classification
of the kinds of animals and the origin
of the species. Therefore, as long as bats
existed only as static specimens within
a particular classification, little could be
accomplished toward solving problems
which concern us.
Man's first speculation about bats'
ability to avoid collisions with objects on
a dark night was probably that they pos-
sessed extremely sensitive vision. Bats do
have distinct eyes, but their vision is act-
ually very poor. Proof that their vision
had very little influence on their obstacle
detection had appeared by the 18th cen-
tury. At that time scientists in Europe
found that bats could detect objects with-
out trouble if they were blinded. But if
both ears were tightly plugged, the bats
would strike wire obstacles at random.
No one realized at the time, however,
that there might exist sounds inaudible
to human ears but useful to a bat for ob-
stacle avoidance.
The sinking of the Titanic in 1912
led Sir Hiram S. Maxim to devise a
means by which ships could detect ob-
stacles. His inspiration came from the
study of bats, from which he called atten-
tion to the possibility of bats' use of
sounds inaudible to the human ear. He
proposed sounds of a frequency below
human range, 15 cycles per second,

PROGRESS IN
AUTOMOBILE BRAKES
Great strides have been made in improving the
safety and reliability of automobile brake sys-
tems, but there are still some tough problems
that need to be licked.
by R. CURTIS FISHBACH
The problem of stopping an automo-
bile is, of course, as old as the au-
tomobile itself. Many means of braking
were tried; there was a time when you
could step on the reverse gear of the Mod-
el T to achieve some braking effort.
Fortunately, we have made great strides
in brake design since the days of the
Model T. Today, American automobile
manufacturers have generally accepted
the internal expanding drum brake for
use on their vehicles. For the most part,
this brake has been extremely reliable,
but during the past few years this brake
has shown an increase in the per cent of
failure. At the same time, more is being
expected of the brakes due to the in-
creased weight and the increased engine
potential of today's cars. Consequently,
we cannot overlook the problems which
Curt Fishbach, a sophomore in
automotive engineering, comes from
South Bend Central High School,
where he participated in debating
and the Science Club. He is treas-
urer of the Engineering Council
and Secretary of the Society of
Automotive Engineers here at U-M.
Last year Curt won the U of M
ASME technical paper contest. This
is his first article to appear in the
Michigan Technic.

are causing the brake failures.
One of the problems encountered in
the present brake system is the uneven
distribution of braking effort needed
while stopping a car. During a stop, an
automobile that normally has a 53-479'r
weight distribution on the front and rear
axles, will change as much as 18%,
giving a 71-29% distribution. Automo-
biles are commonly equipped with brakes
giving 60% front, 40% rear braking
effort. It would be much better if a sys-
tem were used whereby the braking effort
would be divided between the front and
rear axles according to the per cent of
weight on each, as it changes during a
stop.
The second and largest problem con-
cerning automobile brakes is the heat
produced by braking. It has been shown
that a 4000 pound car, when stopped
from 60 miles per hour, produces 620
B.T.U.'s of heat, or enough heat to melt
three pounds of cast iron. This heat
comes from the friction between the
brake shoe and the brake drum. The
components of the system must be able
to withstand and dispose of the heat
created.

ways. The first way is to radiate the
heat to surrounding parts. This, how-
ever, is not advisable because the tires
are nearby and they can't withstand any
further heating. They create enough heat
on their own. A second way of disposing
of heat is to conduct it to surrounding
parts. This also is not advised for the
same reason: the tires don't need the heat,
and the heat would induce extra wear in
the wheel bearings which are also near-
by. The third, and best, way of ridding
brakes of heat is to convect it to the air.
In general, this is the way today's brakes
are cooled. Convection accounts for bet-
ter than 90% of the disposal of heat
from brakes.
It is vital that brake system compo-
nents be able to withstand and dispose of
heat, for too much heat will adversely
affect them. The brake fluid will vaporize
if heated beyond 1100° F., a tempera-
ture easily attainable in many of the
brakes on today's automobiles. Because
a vapor is compressible, the effect the
hydraulic pressure in the system has, is
lost. Also, the vapor can readily escape
through small leaks in the seals in the
system where the fluid cannot.
The brake linings, commonly made of
organic material such as asbestos, wear
quite well at low and moderate tempera-
tures. At high temperatures, above 800°
F., the wear rate can triple and even
quadruple. It does not seem to matter
what type of lining material is used, as
all types have about the same temperature-
bound. Linings that have been developed
to withstand higher temperatures have a
coefficient of friction so low that they
are impractical. Thus, it is important to
keep brakes cool to preserve lining life.
Brake drums, the largest principal
parts of brake units, are also adversely
affected by heat. Because of their size and
because they are responsible for con-
verting heat to the air, the heat proper-
ties of brake drums are quite important.
It is also essential that brake drums give
maximum performance, long life, be light
weight, and low in cost. Today's brake
drums are found to maintain a good co-
efficient of friction up to 800°F. Beyond
this point the coefficient of friction falls
off seriously. Since temperatures above
800°F. are often attained while stopping,
most brakes on American cars are prone
to fade.
It is also found that brake drum ex-
pansion comes with rising temperature.
This expansion requires more brake shoe
travel and wheel cylinder displacement.

Technicians in the General Motors Research Laboratories operate a testing de-
vice used for the evaluation of brake lining materials.
The increase in drum diameter also
means less contact between the shoe and
the drum; hence, localized high shoe
temperature and localized high lining
wear. High temperatures also weaken the
drum material structurally, causing the
drum strength to decrease and the metal
to soften and warp.
When selecting a material for brake-
drums, there are a number of "heat fac-
tors" to be considered. Mass is one of
the most important, since mass times
specific heat is the thermal capacity of
the drum. Therefore drums must have
enough mass to give a good thermal ca-
pacity. Emissivity, the property of a metal
to radiate heat to the air, is also import-
ant. A large amount of heat dissipated by
radiation makes the entire cooling job
easier.
Surface area and exposure are import-
ant factors when cooling is to be done
by convection. It is best to have as large
a surface area as possible. Finning of
brake drums is also good aid in acquiring
more exposure. Finning can increase the
total drum area by 70%. Shrouding must
also be considered. The amount of air
allowed between the wheel rim and drum
will certainly control how well brakes
are cooled. Better shrouding in today's
wheels and brakes would bring better
cooling.
Good homogeneity of the materials in
brake drums is quite necessary since it
avoids hot spots in the drums and ren-
ders a good flow of heat between the
heat generating and heat dispersing sur-
faces. This can help keep the drum
strong so that it is long lasting and long
wearing. By avoiding hot spots, rigidity
is aided, allowing the drum to hold its
shape even with unequal pressure on it.
Cast iron has met most of these re-
quirements over the years. It has a high
heat storage capacity, high emissivity,
low expansion, high melting point, and
low cost. Aluminum, which has been re-
cently introduced as a brake drum ma-
terial, shows merit in having good heat
conductivity, good homogeneous charac-
teristics, and good convection proper-
ties. Unfortunately, aluminum has a low
heat storage capacity, and is subject to
expansion and softening. Also, aluminum
has a higher initial as well as production
cost.
The most recent new brake drum that
has been tried is the finned aluminum
drum with a cast iron rubbing surface
liner. This combination has, so far,
shown outstanding success as a cool op-
erating brake drum. The concept over-
comes the inherent weakness of alum-
inum, and retains the good features of
both aluminum and cast iron. This de-
sign should soon become the adopted
type of drum.
There are extra aids that could be in-
corporated in automobiles to help in the
cooling problem. Special air ducts to in-

MACHINES THAT SELL
"Iron clerks" are cutting overhead losses and
improving service in the merchandising of count-
less small items. Here is a description of the
mechanisms inside these intriguing devices.
by DAVID PATT
The idea of automatic merchandising
is not new. It is a vending industry
maxim that the first vending machine
was built in 219 B.C. by the Greek inven-
tor, Hero of Alexandria. Its purpose was
to sell holy water to the public. The de-
vice was simplicity itself. It consisted of
a container for the holy water, a valve,
and a lever on a pivot to operate the
valve. When a coin was inserted, it would
roll down a trough, strike the valve's
operating lever, and fall into a collection
bin. The momentary opening of the
valve, due to the coin striking the operat-
ing lever, allowed several spoonfuls of
water to escape. However, it appears that
people just weren't ready to accept such
a revolutionary method of buying holy
water, for no other historical reference to
automatic merchandising is found until
the late eighteenth century. Then, a crude
machine was used by London tobacco
merchants to vend cigars.
It wasn't until 1930, however, that the
refinements, which enabled vending ma-
chines to reach their present importance
in merchandising, began to be made.
These refinements, which were mechani-
cal in nature, preceded and caused re-

The success of automatic merchan-
dising is directly related to the mechanical
perfection of the vending machinery
used. Therefore, the following develop-
ments were instrumental in the growth
of the vending industry.
The endless chain principle of vend-
ing was the first major improvement.
David Patt is a freshman in
Science Engineering, hailing from
Detroit's Mumford High School.
This is his first article in The
Michigan Technic. While in high
school, Dave was a member of the
Math Club, and his other interests
are astronautics and nuclear engi-
neering.

In a device incorporating this principle,
containers or open faced boxes are at-
tached to two parallel endless chains;
the products to be vended are inserted
in the containers. When the machine is
operated, the chain moves the product
into position and it is ejected or "vend-
ed."
The gravity vender was another in-
novation. In this device, the products to
be vended are stacked one on top of the
other in a manner resembling the cups
in a paper cup dispenser. When the ma-
chine is operated, the lowermost item is
ejected, thus allowing the next product
to fall into vending position.
The development of coin changers,
which accepted nickels, dimes, and quar-
ters, was one of the most important con-
tributions to the success of vending ma-
chines. Along with coin changers came
the development of electrical actuation
and temperature control systems.
The next step was the incorporation of
some combination of these devices into
one machine. Today's vending machines
employ multiple endless chains or a
number of gravity feed columns to give
customers a wide choice of products.
They use coin changers and electrical
actuation to increase convenience, and
they may also provide heating or refrig-
eration when necessary.
Applications
These mechanical improvements led
to more widespread applications. Today,
vending machines have reached the point
where they sell practically all "nuisance

items" (over $2,000,000,000 worth in
1959). A "nuisance item" is a good
which is physically small, has a long
shelf life, and costs between five and fifty
cents. Because of their small cost, they re-
quire a relatively large percentage of time
and labor to sell. Hence, the term "nui-
sance item." They include such familiar
things as cigarettes, candy, gum, soft
drinks, and so forth.
Recently, vending machines have be-
gun to sell things other than nuisance
items. Such products as hot sandwiches,
pastries, ice cream, hot coffee, and hot
canned foods (stew, soup, beans, chili,
etc.) have been successfully vended.
One interesting example of the ex-
panding use of vending machines can be
found at the University of Kansas. The
University is operating an automatic food
service facility next to a conventional
dormitory lunchroom. The automatic in-
stallation is similar in quality and econ-
omy to the manual installation, but is
much more convenient.
These new applications are indicative
of the future. And this is where the real
interest in automatic merchandising is
found
The Future
I have mentioned before that the suc-
cess of automatic merchandising is re-
lated to the mechanical perfection of the
vending equipment used. Therefore, re-
cent technical advancements in the vend-
ing industry provide a basis for predict-
ing the future of automatic merchandis-
ing.

be largely responsible for any future suc-
cess of automatic merchandising. This is
an automatic currency changer. The
changer accepts and changes any United
States Si or $5 bill. It rejects bills which
are counterfeit, foreign, or of wrong de-
nomination. The machine distinguishes
between bills electronically (operational
details are unavailable due to secrecy)
and is built in modular form for ease of
maintenance. The changer is controlled
by a miniaturized computer which co-
ordinates the operation of its five mod-
ules. The modules are: 1) currency-ac-
cept circuitry; 2) currency discrimina-
tion circuitry; 3) coin accept mechanism;
4) coin payout; 5) currency payout.
Another important device is the to-
talizer. This operates in conduction with
the coin changer as follows. A customer
deposits a sum of money in the changer
and proceeds to make purchases from
the vending installation. The totalizer
would add up the purchases and visually
indicate the credit balance. When the
customer has finished buying, the totalizer
will compute his change and the cur-
rency changer will pay it.
For two months last summer, a proto-
type installation of changer and totalizer
operated at Macy's in New York City.
The machine sold men's shorts and T-
shirts and provided 18 siz;s of each.
Electronic and microwave cooking
units, which will allow complete meals
to be prepared and served by machines,
are under development. The food will
be quick-frozen and stored in the ma-
chine. When operated, the machine will
transfer the food to a cooking compart-
ment where microwaves will heat it to
the perfect temperature. The food will
then be served, all in twenty or thirty
seconds.
Future applications of vending ma-
chines will make extensive use of the
above developments. Consequently, it
will be possible to sell almost any type
of retail good. We will no doubt see au-
tomatic restaurants, super markets, movie
theaters, and department stores.
Last month, The Vendo Company
opened an experimental automatic drive-
in restaurant and grocery store in Kan-
sas City. The restaurant consists of a
kitchen where the majority of the food
items are to be prepared; a small man-
ual service counter, which operates from
11 A.M. to 11 P.M.; and the vending
machinery, which operates continuously.
Attendants who work the 12-hour shift
in the kitchen make change (the currency

stock the vending machines. The restau-
rant section sells fresh coffee, milk, ice
cream, hamburgers, cheeseburgers, and
other drive-in items.
The grocery section consists of ma-
chines which sell items in three tempera-
ture ranges: frozen, chilled (34 degrees),
and room temperature. The following
items are typical of the products offered.
1) Frozen items—Bulk ice cream,
frozen vegetables, frozen pastries, frozen
fruits and fruit juices, and frozen meat
dishes.
2) Chilled items—Dairy products in-
cluding eggs, milk, butter, cheese, and
lemonade; meat products as bacon and
bologna.
3) Room temperature items—Bakery
selections such as bread, rolls, and crack-
ers; staples as sugar, flour, soap, and
coffee; and a wide selection of canned
goods.
The purpose of this experimental in-
stallation is to evaluate public acceptance
of automatic merchandising, methods of
operation and packaging, and economic
feasibility.
Benefits of Automatic Merchandising
The benfits offered by any automatic
merchandising facility are: convenience
in 24-hour service and speed of service;
a large saving in payroll costs (an auto-
matic installation requires a much small-
er number of personnel than an equiva-
lent manual facility); extreme flexi-
bility in that vending machines can easily
be added or removed; maximum use of
space; and small inventories due to the
large product capacity of the machines.
For the consumer these benefits will
mean decreased prices and increased con-
venience. This alone is enough to insure
the success of automatic merchandising.

STU'S EXPLAINING HOW MACHINES WILL
SOME DAY "OUTTALK" PEOPLE
"Stu" Smith graduated from Southern Cal
with a powerful yen for excitement. His kind of
excitement—Engineering.
He got what he bargained for (and a little
more) when he joined Pacific Telephone. One of
Stu's early assignments was to find out how
existing Long Distance networks could be used
to pipeline high speed "conversations" between
computers in distant cities.
The fact that he did a fine job did not go
unnoticed.
Today, four years after starting his tele-
phone career, Senior Engineer Stuart Smith
heads a staff of people responsible for telegraph
and data transmission engineering in the huge
Los Angeles area. As a pioneer in this new data
transmission field Stu predicts data processing
machines will some day do more Long Distance
"talking" than people.
Stu contacted 12 other companies before join-
ing Pacific Telephone. "I don't think there's any
limit to where a man can go in the telephone
business today. Of course, this isn't the place for
a guy looking for a soft touch. A man gets all the
opportunity he can handle right from the start.
He's limited only by how well and how fast he
can cut it."

Every semester, the men chosen for Tau Beta
Pi, the engineering scholastic honorary, must
prepare essays on some non-technical aspect of
engineering. This essay was selected as out-
standing among those submitted by last fall's
pledge class.
by ARLEIGH DAGENIAS
When defining the responsibilities of
a citizen today in the United
States, the status of the world must be
taken into consideration; for a citizen to-
day is no longer just a citizen of his
country, he is a citizen of the world.
In the past, a good citizen was judged
as one who fulfils his ob'igation to vote,
to serve on the jury, to spend his allotted
time in the service of his country, and in
general to be a fairly respectable individ-
ual. Today fulfilling these obligations is
not enough, for citizenship in our times
involves a whole kaleidoscope of intang-
ibles. These new varied aspects of a cit-
izen's responsibility have gradually evol-
ved with the international proximity of
nations and individuals of the present
day. The clarity of this citizen's respon-
sibility to the world is obvious at every
moment of every day as the impact of
world events has its effect upon each in-
dividual citizen's life; and in reverse, the
citizen's ability to fulfill his obligations
will have a direct effect on the world of
today, as well as the world of tomorrow.
These areas of responsibility for an
American citizen of our times touch on
many facets of his life. Of first concern
is an active participation in working for
a peaceful world. It is not the responsi-
bility of our governing officials alone
to strive for peace, but the burden falls
upon all of us. A tolerance for and an
attempt to understand the nations of the
world are obligations of the responsible
citizen. Knowledge of foreign countries,
their customs, beliefs and ways of life
is a first step toward understanding. A
tolerance of different opinions, prefer-
ences, and attitudes will break the way
for friendship. A genuine interest and
concern on the part of the citizen for the
welfare of people in all areas of the
world will serve as a foundation for more
active participation. Those who travel
are obliged to carry with them at all
times an open mind and the constant
thought that they are representatives of
their country and all American citizens
will be judged through them. Supporting
the instruments of truth and freedom in
the world is the responsibility of all citi-
zens. The broad scope of these activities
is constantly growing in many forms,
from freedom broadcasts to finding
homes for the refugee population of the
world.
In the home it is necessary that citi-
zens who are parents raise their children
to be responsible citizens of the world.
A respect for life and individuals is of
major importance in molding a worth-
while citizen. It is the parent citizen's ob-
ligation to impart to his child the attitude
that he can do something to solve the
problems of his country and his world
and that it is his responsibility to be con-
cerned and to participate.
It is the responsibility of today's citizen
to have ideals. Responsible feelings of the
American citizen are too often drowned
in the materialism of his every day life.
In his drive toward obtaining a higher
material existence, the citizen often loses
any desire to work for anyone but him-
self, forgetting that in contributing as a
citizen of the world he works for his own
interests by creating a better world for
his family and himself. Immersed in his
strivings toward personal and material
satisfaction, he can spare neither the time
nor the energy for responsible citizenship,
and ideals of freedom, peace and a bet-
ter world are choked off and replaced by
"I-don't-care" attitudes, cynicism, and
negative responses. A balance must be
maintained between idealism and ma-
terialism so that the citizen will be con-
tinuously aware of the world around him
and of his obligations to it, for the re-
sponsible citizen must have a sense of
values that will promote the selfless con-
tribution on his part toward the ideal of
a better world.
Finally, perhaps the most important in-
gredient of the responsible citizen today
is enthusiasm, enthusiasm for his world
and his country, and enthusiasm for im-
proving them as an individual and as one
of a group, for he must live his life in
this world and hopefully leave a better
one for his children.

Beta Pi pledge essay competition,

Energy conversion is our business
The concept of energy availability
in all its ramifications is becoming
ever more important to Allison's
energy conversion mission.
Current projects involving this con-
cept include electrochemical con-

future automobile), heat regenerator
systems and photolysis regenerators.
In our inquiries we rely not only on
our own resources but also on the
talents of General Motors Corpora-

Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a
favorable engineering atmosphere.
Back in 1925, when Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft was
designing and developing the first of its family of
history-making powerplants, an attitude was born—a
recognition that engineering excellence was the key
to success.
That attitude, that recognition of the prime impor-
tance of technical superiority is still predominant at
P&amp;WA today.
The field, of course, is broader now, the challenge
greater. No longer are the company's requirements
confined to graduates with degrees in mechanical
and aeronautical engineering. Pratt &amp; Whitney Air-
craft today is concerned with the development of
all forms of flight propulsion systems for the aero-
space medium—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and
other advanced types. Some are entirely new in
concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with
degrees in mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chem-
ical and nuclear engineering are needed, along
with those holding degrees in physics, chemistry
and metallurgy.
Specifically, what would you do?—your own engi-
neering talent provides the best answer. And Pratt
&amp; Whitney Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which
that talent can flourish.
For further information regarding an engineering
career at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, consult your col-
lege placement officer or write to Mr. R. P. Azinger,

At P&amp;WA's Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear Engine Lab*
oratory (CANEL) many technical talents are focused

PROBLEM:
HOW

KEEPS A
HYDROFOIL.
CRAFT ON
ITS TOES
Hamilton Standard's Electronics Department is currently
developing the automatic stabilization system for Grumman
Aircraft's exciting hydrofoil boat. This all-aluminum, 80-ton
test design is expected to reach speeds of 60 to 80 knots by
means of reducing its drag through the automatically con-
trolled "lift" of hydrofoils. For peak efficiency, the incidence
of these foils must be continuously controlled so that the
center of gravity will remain steady as wave height and
direction of flow change . . . through every kind of sea.
As you can see, the engineering requirements implicit in
designing an automatic control system for such a craft
created a variety of problems. Engineers had to consider
automatic pitch stability augmentation during take-off, cruise
and landing; manually adjustable trim control devices to
allow the pilot to set desired trim in pitch attitude; pitch
trim control from level to eight degrees bow-up and within
± .25 degrees of reference. In addition, the control, which
will require 115 ± 10V RMS at 400 ± 20 CPS, had to be
designed so that open or short circuit failure of any one
component would not put large reference voltages in circuit
areas resulting in large control surface displacements.
Making use of its experience acquired in engineering the
Automatic Stabilization Equipment for helicopters such as
Sikorsky's S-61 the Electronics Department developed the
lightweight, highly transistorized gear shown below incor-
porating the latest state-of-the-art packaging and circuitry
techniques. The block diagram on the left below shows the

AND
RESEARCH
Edited by CHARLES MASSER
This month Michigan-Education and
Research has made several stops at just
a few of the interesting yet sometimes
unheard of areas in scientific research and
development. We will travel from such
places as the Michigan Medical Center,
where a discussion on how the immunity
to disease is affected by radiation is
overheard, to the psychology labs where
an experiment is now in progress on the
visual preception of humans, in which
color amid brightness without detailed
shapes are used. So without further de-
lay we are off to the Michigan Medical
Center.
Immunity Affects of Radiation
New evidence on the way radiation
affects immunity to disease was reported
by Reuben L. Kahn (Sc.D.) of the Uni-
versity of Michigan Medical Center. In
a talk prepared for the Panamerican Con-
gress on Pharmacy and Biochemistry
meeting in Santiago, Chile, Kahn said
when an antitoxin was injected into an
irradiated area of an animal, it produced
better protection. He gave rabbits lethal
doses of diphtheria toxin, along with a
protective anti-toxin. In those animals
in which the injection site had first been
exposed to X-radiation, the antitoxin
worked "more effectively than the anti-
toxin injected in the non-irradiated areas
of the control animals.
He also reported that other rabbits
were given skin injections with staphy-
locaccus germs. This produced a "severe"
reaction in the normal animals, but only
a "mild" inflammation when the injec-
tions were made in an irradiated area.
Kahn, the developer of the world-wide
blood test which bears his name, conclud-
ed that radiation disrupts the "localizing"
effect of normal inflammation. He told
the Congress ordinary inflammation,
caused by a wound or the invasion of
bacteria or protein substances, helps pre-
vent infections from spreading to other
parts of the body. It seals off the attack-
ing organisms in the infected area and
"is one of the most powerful phenomena
that keeps us alive." In some manner not
determined, radiation upsets this local-
izing ability. The U-M scientist called it
an "anti-localizing phenomenon" and
said it is "obviously of great importance
in immunity and deserves careful study."
Research at U. of M.
The University of Michigan ranks
fifth nationally in the dollar value of re-
search grants from the National Institute

Development of the bubble chamber for the study of subatomic particles brought the I960 Nobel Prize for physics to
Prof. Donald A. Glaser. Glaser developed the bubble chamber in 1952 at the University of Michigan.
Hopkins University . In all, 28 institu-
tions within the state of Michigan shared
a total of 6.7 million for 356 research
projects.
"Bubble Chamber" Wins
Nobel Prize in Physics
Discovery of the "bubble chamber"—
man's window to the interior of atoms—
stems from a scientist's eye for a bottle
of beer and a university's willingness to
gamble on his ideas. The scientist is Don-
ald A. Glaser, 34, who won the
Nobel Prize in physics November 3 for
development in 1952 of the "bubble
chamber" at The University of Michigan.
Glaser's idea came from observation of
the foaming action of an uncapped bottle
of beer. He theorized the beer foamed
after being struck by a particle of matter
from the atmosphere, with an assist from
the heat in the vicinity of the bottle.
Glaser thought the same principle might
work in studying collisions between sub-
atomic particles hurled by atom smashers.
If these particles passed through a suit-
able liquid, he reasoned, they might
leave a trail of bubbles, enabling physi-
cists to photograph and study the results.
He approached several agencies for sup-
port in testing this theory, but was re-
jected. Then the U-M's Phoenix Project,
a privately supported atomic research
program, gambled Si 500 on the idea. It
worked. Today, an estimated $35 million
a year is spent on "bubble chamber" re-
search and development.
After proving the feasibility of his
idea with Phoenix help, Glaser built an
improved chamber with liquid propane
and tested it at Brookhaven National
Laboratory, where in the first 10 minutes
of operation he obtained photographs of
nuclear events seldom seen in their en-
tirety by older methods.
Eight of his first 22 pictures, for ex-
ample, pictured the creation in nuclear
collisions of particles called pi mesons,
their slowdown and decay into mu me-
sons, and the transition of mu mesons
into electrons, one of the basic building
blocks of atoms.

HE'S MAPPING NEW WAYS TO BEAT
TRAFFIC JAMS IN LOGICAL SYSTEMS
A computer system must be versatile. The IBM 1401 sys-
tem, for instance, might go to work in a radiation lab, a
stockbrokerage office, an air operations center, a refinery,
or any one of a hundred other places. Demands upon the
individual units of the system will vary widely.
Paul Farbanish analyzes the loads placed on the system by
different applications. One of his assignments is to design
new and alternate ways for data to move from unit to unit
with the greatest speed and reliability.
Like many an engineer at IBM, his responsibility ranges
over a wide technical field. To do his job he has become
familiar with many challenging areas of electronics. Within
the 1401 system alone he dealt with circuits, data flow
control, input-output, storage, etc.
If a young engineer wants to move rapidly into the most
advanced areas of electronics, he would do well to consider
IBM. In the fast-expanding world of data systems and its
many peripheral fields, a man is given all the responsibility
he is able to handle. New ideas and new ways of doing
things are not only welcome but actively encouraged.
The IBM representative will be interviewing on your campus
this year. He will be glad to discuss with you the many chal-
lenging jobs that are open at IBM—whether in development,

which would have an 80 foot wave length
in air. But the small objects which bats
would encounter during flight could not
produce appreciable reflections of such
sounds.
In 1938, Donald R. Griffin, a Har-
vard University zoologist, and G. W.
Pierce, a Harvard physicist, listened to
bats by the use of a sonic detector appara-
tus constructed by Pierce. The maximum
response of this apparatus was at 50 kilo-
cycles, which is more than double the
highest frequency audible to human
ears. This obviously reversed Maxim's
earlier proposal.
To prove that these ultrasonic sounds
were necessary for normal flight, Griffin
tied the jaws of several bats shut and
sealed their lips with collodion. In flight
they blundered helplessly into wires and
the walls of the room. If the slightest
crack or pinhole appeared in their collo-
dion masks, enough high frequency
sound was allowed to escape so that the
bats flew normally again.
Careful studies convinced scientists
that neither the high frequency ultrasonic
pulses nor the clicking sound audible to
human ears ever occurred without the
simultaneous presence of the other.
Whenever the sonic detector indicated
that a bat was emitting an ultrasonic
pulse, the human ear could also hear a
faint clicking. With the short ultrasonic
pulses bats actively probe their environ-
ment. But the emission of the sounds is
not semi-automatic, regular, or mechani-
cal. Rather, the pulse repetition rate
varies according to the needs of the bat.
There are considerable differences in the
pulses emitted by the Eptesicus bat when
cruising and when in hot pursuit of an
insect. The cruising type of pulse is also
quite distinct from anything which the
bats ever emit when in the laboratory.
The cruising (natural) pulse is of long-
er duration—10 to 15 milliseconds, while
it is only 2 to 4 milliseconds in the lab-
oratory. The longer duration cruising
pulses of the Eptesicus may start with
frequencies as high as 70 kilocycles or
as low as 33. These frequencies may have
a rapid or gradual drop during the first
few milliseconds, or they may remain con-
stant for nearly the entire duration of the
pulse. A low pulse repetition rate when

Table I. Comparison of the physical dimensions and performance of
natural and instrumental systems for echolocation, typical radar and
sonar systems of World War II have been selected for comparison
with the insectivorous bat Eptesicus fuscus on the basis of available,
published information concerning the former. (Permission from Donald
R. Griffin).
cruising several feet above the ground is
used to avoid confusion between echoes
of the bat's own successive pulses. When
the bat approaches an insect during feed-
ing hours, the pulse repetition rate in-
creases, because the bat is paying closer
attention to echoes from the insect.
Not all bats eat insects, however. Two
distinct groups, the insectivorous and the
fruit eaters or carnivorous bats, are set
up with respect to the intensity of their
emitted sounds. The first group, the in-
sectivorous or "loud" bats, orient them-
selves by means of intense pulses, easily
detectable on almost any microphone that
covers the frequency range of 10 to 100
kilocylces. Sound pressures measured
close to the mouth of this group of bats
commonly range from 20 to 100 dynes
per cm.2 or higher. The "whispering"
group of bats, because they do not feed
on the wing, emit sounds which are very
difficult to detect. Their sound pressure
levels are rarely higher than 3 to 5 dynes
per cm2.
The control of the directional pattern
of the sound pulses has been found to be
quite accurate. A bat can emit pulses
which shift from a beam pointed straight
ahead to a directional pattern which has
much more energy at 60° to one side
within a fraction of a second. As Griffin
says in his book Listening in the Dark.
"Each individual pulse has not one but
a whole family of directional intensity
patterns, and if these were measured not
merely at 90° but at many other angles
both vertically and horizontally about the
direction in which the bat is flying, we
would find that each frequency had its
own characteristic pattern and that the
high frequencies at the start of the pulse
are concentrated much more strongly in-
to the forward direction."
Before studying the facilities for sound
reception, it is necessary to find out the
source of the bat's sounds. One of Grif-
fin's co-workers observed that when a
bat's mouth is wide open, the opening
into the throat and larynx was seldom
visible. There was only a brief flicker
at the back of the tongue at the same time
that a pulse was indicated by the sonic
detector. The larynx of the bat is re-
markably large and specialized consider-
ing the small size of the animal. Two
pairs of very thin membranes, each only
about 1/3000 of an inch thick lie on the
34

shallow cavity. Tension applied to the
membranes causes them to vibrate at ult-
rasonic frequencies sufficient to generate
pulses of sound for successful echoloca-
tion.
In the reception of echoes a directional
localization must also be possible, be-
cause in addition to simply detecting the
obstacles, the bat must know where the
obstacle is located. Frequency modulation
of the emitted pulses makes possible this
directional orientation. For example, a
change in frequency at the rate of about
20 kilocyles per millisecond will occur in
an echo reaching the Myotis bat. There-
fore, if the echo reaches one ear 0.1 mil-
liseconds before the other, the ears will
receive a frequency difference of about
2000 cycles per second. It is even pos-
sible that smaller differences than this
are detectable.
The center of the sound reception is
located in the cochlea inside the ear. The
part of the cochlea nearest the middle
ear which is concerned with the high
frequencies is unusually large in bats.
Whenever hair cells on the cochlea are
stimulated by sounds, they generate small
voltages called cochlear microphonics,
which reflect the degree to which the hair
cells of the cochlea are stimulated. The
cochlear microphonics or potentials arc
electrophysiological indications for the
frequency range of the bat's hearing.
During the emission of sound, the
bat's sensitive ears require protection
from its own outgoing pulses. We can as-
sume that the emission of each pulse of
high frequency sound would place a se-
vere strain on the bat's cochlea. The ana-
tomy of the protective device is known
and consists of two muscles of the mid-
dle ear which arc attached to minute
bones connecting the eardrum to the
membranous windows leading to the
cochlea. The way in which these muscles
give the needed protection is not com-
pletely understood, but a quite simple
theory is available. It is that the muscles
contract just as each pulse is emitted;
since contraction of these muscles, which
are enormously large relative to the size
of the bat, raises the sound pressure
necessary to generate a given cochlear
microphonic, it reduces the sensitivity of
the bat's hearing also.
In attempting to relate the study of a
bat's obstacle detection to an easier life
for a blind person, scientists first tried
to learn how certain blind people could
move about successfully. The first ideas
were that variations in temperature and
pressure close to the blind person's face
gave him a "facial vision." We can ima-
gine that, if we blindfolded ourselves
and walked through an obstacle course,
we would move according to what
seemed to be variations in pressure or
air currents. Actually an auditory means
of obstacle detection is more important
than the misnamed "facial vision."
Several instruments for echolocation by-
blind people have been devised. The
sound sources seem to work best when
they are concentrated into a quite narrow
angle, and when the beam can be moved
about to scan the surroundings. There
is little use of these devices, however,
because it is not yet known what type of
sound would serve best for direct human
echolocation. A few laboratories and in-
cludes passive detection, which is simply
listening for sounds originating from the
submarine or other object to be detected.
In this case, if two "ears" or receivers are
used and are sufficiently separated, a
triangulation with the sound source is
possible, and its distance as well as bear-
ing can be obtained. Binaural auditory lo-
calization, as this process is called, is very
accurate. Sonar in its truer sense is an
active acoustic orientation. Here a sort of
sound signal must be emitted, and its re-
turning echoes must be detected. Its prac-
tical possibilities are limited by the abili-
ty of the listener or the receiver to dis-
tinguish between its own echoes and
foreign sounds.
It is tempting to claim that man de-
veloped radar and sonar as a result of

The major characteristic of one member of the horseshoe bat family is the prom-
inent nose leaves. Bats depend on ultrasonic waves for their meals.
stitutions have several echolocation in-
struments, but the type of information
which they supply hardly makes the use
of them worthwhile. The natural sounds
which most skilled blind men base their
echolocation on come from footsteps and
finger snapping.
In the development of sonar on the
other hand, definite success is attained in
echolocation by artificial devices. Radar
also has achieved this success, although
radar consists of the emission of elect-
romagnetic waves rather than sound
waves as in bats and sonar. The success
of sonar is in the use of underwater
sound to locate submarines lying beneath
a ship. If the distance to the bottom of
the ocean is being measured, we call it
echo sounding.
A general definition of sonar often in-
his study of bats. The principle might
even be extended to include airplanes:
birds taught men the principles of flight.
But this is all wrong. As Professor Griffin
has put it, "the engineers anticipated the
biologists." Radar, sonar, and the air-
plane prompted the zoologists to com-
pare the animals to the machines, with the
result that the zoologists greatly increased
their knowledge of animal behavior. The
gyroscope is another example. Fifty mil-
lion years ago insects navigated through
primeval swamps and forests by means
of a rudimentary gyroscope connected by
the nervous system to their wings. It was
not until 1907 that a gyroscope was in-
stalled in a ship by Sperry. Perhaps there
isn't, after all, anything new under the
sun.

The use of 15 inch wheels would also

Of course, there are revolutionary ways
of solving brake system problems, such
as cooling brakes by a complete liquid
cooling system, or, even more drastic,
switching to an entirely different type
of brake, like the disk brake. It is my
belief, though, that with the incorpora-
tion of the suggestions made here for the
internal expanding drum brake, it could
easily become the world's most depend-

"But what about the fourth man,"
they asked. "How come he carries two

"Oh, that's his handicap," said the
caddie. "You see, he caught her yester-

"Do you want to sell this horse?"
"Yep," replied the farmer.
"Can he run?"
"Can he run! Look." Thereupon he
slapped the part of the horse sometimes

Glaser describes the "bubble chamber"
in The Physical Review in January, 1955.
Little more than a year later (May,
1956), he reported development of a
"bubble chamber" using liquified xenon
gas which made possible easy and rapid
observation of both charged and neutral
particles, some of which live less than
10 millionths of a second. The "xenon
chamber" will detect neutrons, gamma
rays, neutral mesons, and almost all other
atomic particles.
Michigan physicists believe the "bub-
ble chamber" may rank in importance
with the invention of the atom smasher.

preserve vital breeding grounds of the
American waterfowl population. Dean
Dana was appointed by President Eisen-
hower to the newly-organized Outdoor
Recreation Resources Review Commis-
sion, one of seven non-Congressional
members named with eight senators and
representatives.
"Three-fourths of the ducks hatched
in continental U. S. are dependent upon
breeding grounds in western Minnesota
and the eastern Dakotas," he points out.
"These wetlands, particularly glaciated
potholes, that the waterfowl need, are
located largely on private lands.
"Farmers in Minnesota are continuing
where the land would be more valuable
from the public point of view if kept un-
der water?"

to drain water areas and the breeding
lands disappear as a result. Public au-
thorities have assumed that the bulk of
the waterfowl population will have to
come from private lands. But we cannot
expect the farmer to provide adequate
waterfowl facilities at his own expense—
it is up to the federal and state agencies
to provide most of the necessary land
through ownership, through lease from
private owners, or by subsidy to keep the
land in water.
"The government now subsidizes
drainage projects," Dean Dana points
out, "so why not reverse the procedure

Civil Engineering
During the past ten years a quiet revolution has been taking place in design offices,
contracting firms, state highway departments, and fabricating plants throughout the land
whereby the use of the digital computer has increasingly aided the civil engineer in every
branch of the broad range of his activities. In the Civil Engineering Department, the Uni-
versity of Michigan is leading the way to further advances. Computer programming is first
taught in the surveying courses where the groundwork is laid for later work at both the
undergraduate and graduate level.
The IBM 704 computer, which can perform 40,000 arithmetic operations a second, is used
by students for home problems and in research. Undergraduate students solve computer
problems in hydraulics, structural analysis, structural design, and surveying. In graduate
instruction, typical problems being studied include the determination of stresses in a deep
plate beam, inelastic column buckling analyses, torsion of structural sections, the study
of the response of a tall building to earthquake shock, flood routing, hydraulic surge, trian-
gulation adjustment, and astronomic azimuth determination.

(Continued from page 46)
M. Pickett, University of Michigan grad-
uate student in psychology.
A group of U-M researchers have been
using an old technique for investigating
visual perception by causing the viewers
to see only color and brightness with no
shape or line in the entire field of view.
Such experience is called a Genzfeld,
meaning "total field of view."
Pickett has been working with several
other U-M researchers in developing a
more elaborate apparatus for creating the
Ganzfeld experience. "We have built a
large plaster hemisphere which, when
stood on its edge on a table, allows a
viewer sitting at the table to put his head
far enough into the hemisphere so that
he sees nothing but its white powdery
interior. "When light is introduced over
the viewer's head a Ganzfeld is exper-
ienced. With this device we have been
able to measure the brightness sensitivity
of the eye during the times when the
viewer feels blinded. "We have made
the surprising discovery that during these
blind spells the eye is just as sensitive to
changes in brightness as it normally is."
One interpretation of these findings
is that seeing can occur only where there
are things to be seen, says Pickett. "Vis-
ual perception is the perception of things,
shapes, lines, shadows—not qualities like
brightness and color."
U-M researchers have recently com-
pleted the construction of a still more
elaborate apparatus which will produce
the Genzfeld experience and allow shapes
to be gradually introduced into this total
foggy field, Pickett points out.
"This apparatus will make it possible
to investigate shape perception under
very simple visual conditions. Studies
elsewhere have shown that during the
recurring blind spells experienced in this
Ganzfeld, shapes emerging out of this
foggy field are much more difficult to
perceive than when one is seeing nor-
mally."
Visual perception has long been of in-
terest to psychologists, but a better un-
derstanding of it is needed for design-
ing various types of instruments such as
radar scopes, instrument panels, and other
man-machine systems.

One of a series
Interview with
General Electric's Earl G, Abbott,
Manager—Sales Training
Technical Training Programs
at General Electric
Q. Why does your company have train-
ing programs, Mr. Abbott?
A. Tomorrow's many positions of major
responsibility will necessarily be filled by
young men who have developed their
potentials early in their careers. General
Electric training programs simply help
speed up this development process.
In addition, training programs provide
graduates with the blocks of broad ex-
perience on which later success in a
specialization can be built.
Furthermore, career opportunities and
interests are brought into sharp focus
after intensive working exposures to
several fields. General Electric then gains
the valuable contributions of men who
have made early, well-considered deci-
sions on career goals and who are con-
fidently working toward those objectives.
Q. What kinds of technical training pro-
grams does your company conduct?
A. General Electric conducts a number
of training programs. The G-E programs
which attract the great majority of
engineering graduates are Engineering
and Science, Manufacturing, and Tech-
nical Marketing.
Q. How long does the Engineering and
Science Program last?
A. That depends on which of several
avenues you decide to take. Many gradu-
ates complete the training program dur-
ing their first year with General Electric.
Each Program member has three or four
responsible work assignments at one or
more of 61 different plant locations.
Some graduates elect to take the Ad-
vanced Engineering Program, supple-
menting their work assignments with
challenging Company-conducted study
courses which cover the application of
engineering, science, and mathematics to
industrial problems. If the Program mem-
ber has an analytical bent coupled with a
deep interest in mathematics and physics,
he may continue through a second and
third year of the Advanced Engineering
Program.
Then there is the two-year Creative
Engineering Program for those graduates
who have completed their first-year
assignments and who are interested in
learning creative techniques for solving
engineering problems.
Another avenue of training for the
qualified graduate is the Honors Program,
which enables a man to earn his Master's
di-gree within three or four semesters at
selected colleges and universities. The
Company pays for his tuition and books,
and his work schedule allows him to earn
75 percent of full salary while he is going
to school. This program is similar to a
research assistantship at a college or
university.
Q. Just how will the Manufacturing
Training Program help prepare me for
a career in manufacturing?
A. The three-year Manufacturing
Program consists of three orientation
assignments and three development
assignments in the areas of manufacturing
engineering, quality control, materials
management, plant engineering, and
manufacturing operations. These assign-
ments provide you with broad, funda-
mental manufacturing knowledge and
with specialized knowledge in your
particular field of interest.
The practical, on-the-job experience
offered by this rotational program is sup-
plemented by participation in a manu-
facturing studies curriculum covering
all phases of manufacturing.
Q. What kind of training would I get
on your Technical Marketing Program?
A. The one-year Technical Marketing
Program is conducted for those graduates
who want to use their engineering knowl-
edge in dealing with customers. After
completing orientation assignments in
engineering, manufacturing, and market-
ing, the Program member may specialize
in one of the four marketing areas: appli-
cation engineering, headquarters market-
ing, sales engineering, or installation and
service engineering.
In addition to on-the-job assignments,
related courses of study help the Program
member prepare for early assumption of
major responsibility.
Q. How can I decide which training
program I would like best, Mr. Abbott?
A. Well, selecting a training program is
a decision which you alone can make. You
made a similar decision when you selected
your college major, and now you are
focusing your interests only a little more
sharply. The beauty of training programs
is that they enable you to keep your
career selection relatively broad until you
have examined at first hand a number of
specializations.
Furthermore, transfers from one Gen-
eral Electric training program to another
are possible for the Program member
whose interests clearly develop in one
of the other fields.
Personalized Career Planning
is General Electric's term for the
selection, placement, and pro-
fessional development of engi-
neers and scientists. If you would

we know about
tomorrow:
A new Westlnghouse development could be your heart's best friend!
It is a little electronic device with the unusual name of "Cardiac Pacer."
Originally, it was developed to provide a gentle boost to a patient
whose heart faltered or stopped during an operation, or for use as a heart
stimulant in hospital recovery rooms.
Now Westinghouse is working to perfect it for personal use on millions of
heart patients by their physicians. It would be light and easy to carry about.
It may not be cheap, but then life is worth a lot to any of us.
Part of the plan for the future is a radio receiver about the size of a pack
of cigarettes which a doctor could carry with him and, if any of his heart
patients had any trouble, the radio would beep-beep the doctor. He could
then tune in to that patient, listen to his heart beats, if necessary, and
advise emergency treatment. Wondrous are the uses of electricity.

Bendix answers your questions
WHAT COMPANY
SHOULD I JOIN?
When there is a choice of employment opportunities, most
graduating engineers and scientists make some sort of list of the
advantages offered by each prospective employer.
Some men put salary at the top of the list. Many lean toward the
company offering them the best chance at creativity . . . the widest scope
for developing their interests and increasing their professional stature.
Others favor job security, company size and stability, or geographic
location. The final choice generally is made on the basis of the
biggest "package" of advantages offered.
Probably no organization today can offer a longer list of
employment advantages than The Bendix Corporation.
One of the world's most highly regarded, stable,
and diversified engineering-research-manu
facturing corporations, Bendix has 25
divisions which produce, literally, "a
thousand diversified products." The
wide geographic spread of these
divisions can be seen in the
listing below.
Starting salaries paid by Bendix are
competitive with those offered by
other companies—naturally, better
talents are more highly rewarded.
Bendix readily recognizes achieve-
ment, and gives the developing
engineer and scientist wide lati-
tude in his field of interest.
Ask your Placement Director
about Bendix—where you can
build your career to suit your
talents. If you can't arrange a
personal interview, write to

make it, master it, market it
make it. In one respect the chemist enjoys a freedom af-
forded few other professions—if he needs some new material
for a specific problem, he can usually make it. Need a grease-
less emulsifier? He can start with a water-soluble polyglycol
and tailor it exactly to your needs. Need a coupling agent
with surfactant properties for aromatics? Sulfonating his
dodecylbenzene should do it. And it does. Certainly there
are a great many ways to solve problems, but at Dow the
emphasis is on "make it."
master it. Theoretical possibilities are not enough for the
developers of new Dow products. These products must be
mastered to achieve the utmost of their possibilities. Pow-
dered calcium chloride hard to handle? A new pelleted form
provides the answer. Methylcellulose dusty and hard to
dissolve? Make it granular, clean, and free flowing. In this
intermediate or developmental stage of the Dow operation,
the emphasis is on "make it work." As a result, as with all
Dow products for industry, "If it's Dow, it's backed by
complete technology."
market it. It happens to be true that for your better prod-
uct, the world will beat a path to your door considerably
faster if you have an astute marketing department. Here
again the scientific method proves its value. Dow marketing
personnel make sure the right people know about the right
product and can get it in the right package. At Dow,
marketing personnel know their products "from the chem-
istry up." Rigid foam? Builders can use it for insulation,
boat builders for buoyancy. Polyethylene film? Food proc-
essors can use it for packaging, housewives for picnicking.
In this way, Dow's marketing experts serve industry and the
consumer by helping them get better products in the best
possible form.

In looking back upon three and one-half years of my education
in the engineering college, I find reason to wonder whether I have
learned as much as I ought to have. I find that I am dissatisfied.
Probably this dissatisfaction is felt by the majority of my classmates,
as well. We seniors, faced with the imminent necessity of applying
our learning to the task of earning our bread and butter, tend to be
a bit uncertain of the capacity of our educational background to
bring forth fruit.
I imagine that it would be a waste of editorial space to exhort
underclassmen to study hard and learn well, for such advice is
given them from all sides in great abundance. But perchance some-
thing in the manner of "an inside tip" on how to keep on top of
one's studies might be considered seriously by a reader here and
there. Therefore, I would like to pass along to the younger student
this maxim, which I believe to be the most important rule for the
conquest of any course: study every subject at least as frequently as
the class meets.
This theory of regular studying works because it permits the
student to understand what is going on at each meeting of the class.
If one has prepared his lessons for a particular class in advance, he
will be able to give 100% attention, whereas the fellow who puts
in just as much time, but all on the weekend, sits through many
classes in which he has something less than a perfect idea of what
the instructor is discussing. His attention level and his degree of
absorption tend to lag. If he has not been getting enough sleep
(who does?), he will become drowsy and inattentive. The lectures
on material not perfectly understood seem dull and a bit confusing.
Before long, he will become completely lost. His classmate who
has some idea of what is going on through daily preparation will
get the most out of the lecture, and will learn while in class. The
man prepared in advance will therefore learn more and better with
less study, merely because he is regular.
Catching up from behind is one of the most time-wasting, dis-
couraging, and altogether inefficient things that a student may
ever be required to do. And if the "catching up" should be in the
form of cramming for an exam, inferior results are almost assured.
Despite the fact that the regular studier winds up doing less
work for the same amount of learning, very few students have the
self-discipline to follow such a pattern rigorously in all courses.
Therefore, I believe that some means to make daily preparation of
lessons almost imperative for the student should be considered. I
would suggest that the "incentive" for students to come to class
prepared come from a policy by the individual instructors to call
upon students at random to recite. Probably there would be no
need to grade the students on their class recitation; the desire to
avoid embarrassment alone would suffice.
This method has been used with considerable success in foreign
universities, at the military academies, and in the Michigan Law
School. At these schools, students know they may be expected to
feed back part of the information which they supposedly had learned
for that day's class. Erratic workers are brought to light, and proper-
ly made to realize that effective learning requires systematization
of effort.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Another advantage of oral recitation is the instructional value
to other students—a fellow student may be able to present an
answer or to discuss a problem in a different manner than the in-
structor, making it more understandable. Additionally, the instructor
is enlightened because he has a direct measure of points that the
students do not understand very well.
Different courses have different needs, and the preferences of
instructors are very valid considerations. Therefore, I do not pro-
pose this as a blanket policy. However, I sincerely believe that
such a system, used to the practical limit, would result in easier
and better education in the engineering college.

A couple of years ago a new idea came to the Michigan engi-
neering campus. Transfer students coming here from other large
engineering schools were surprised to discover that our college did
not sponsor an open house to introduce non-engineers, including
community, family, friends, Lit people, and high school students
to the mysteries lying within our buildings.
Thus was Engineers' Weekend born. The engineering college
now had an annual open house. It was student-organized and
student-run. Last year's open house, held in May, was termed by
its chairmen "a moderate success." At that time, everyone connected
with the open house had great expectations that Engineers' Weekend,
1961, would be bigger and better than ever before, as a result of
the experience gained and the growing interest in showing off the
facilities of the college.
Something seems to have gone wrong. The Engineering Coun-
cil, whose responsibility it is to set up the committee to run the
Weekend, has been unable to find a chairman. Signs requesting
petitions for the job have been up for weeks. The technical societies
have been asked to poll their members. No response.
We feel that this is a worthwhile project, particularly to the
extent that we are able to show something of engineering to pros-
pective Michigan engineering students. May we request that any
interested student drop an inquiring note in the campus mail
addressed to Engineering Council, 3212 East Engineering Building?
Incidentally, many jobs other than the general chairmanship need
filling also.
While we are on the subject of the Engineering Council, we
might point out that Council meetings are open to all students, and
that this is the perfect place to air gripes, grudges, suggestions,
comments, etc., about any facet of the College. The members are
eager to leap upon any new idea to improve conditions, so if you
have any, drop in at 3529 SAB at 7:15 on alternate Thursdays—
beginning with February 16, and then March 2, 16, and 30.

UPGRADING
ENERGY
-OUR MOST IMPORTANT JOB
FOR EIGHTY YEARS, America's electric power industry has been advancing the science of upgrading
energy resources into the most usable, flexible and economical of all the forms of energy—electricity. The
progress of our abundant industrial society has depended very largely on the refinement of "crude" energy
—either in the form of heat from fossil fuels like coal, or in the form of falling water—into infinitely
versatile electric power. [ J Today the development of atomic electric power offers another means for even
more efficient upgrading of our energy sources. In the near future this new development may lead to large
scale direct conversion machines—enabling us to produce electricity directly from heat without steam
generators and turbines. \_\ At Detroit Edison, research and development of new power sources through
fission, fuel cells, thermoelectric and thermionic generation is being continuously appraised. Applications of
this research for energy upgrading offer a challenge to young engineers coming into the electric power industry.

Upsctter, or kortiontal forging machine
Gear blanks for tractor and farm implement transmissions are designed to be
upset-forged, usually with integral forged stub shafts. Forging gives these vital
parts maximum resistance to gear-clashing shifts. Transmission life can
be equal to equipment life when gears are FORGED.
When you design with forgings right from the start, you take full advantage
of the many benefits which only forgings offer: highest ratio of strength to weight
. .. highest resistance to impact, shock, vibration, torsion ...
preferential orientation of flow lines in the forging to concentrate
strength where required ... absence of wasteful inclusions and voids.
Forged parts start out as better metal . . . are made even better
by the hammer blows or pressures of the forging process. Write
for literature to help you design, specify, and procure forged parts.

Why, it's easy as A-B-C. Just start with a simple shape,
one that's readily identified and easily remembered.
(The Jenkins Diamond is a good example.) Then just fill
in the blank spaces. That's all there is to it, and almost
anyone can do it!

Ah, that isn't so easy nor so simple.
A trademark is like a man's signature: it can mean much
or it can mean little.
Time and performance make the difference.
Take the Jenkins Bros, trademark. There's nothing tricky
about the design, certainly nothing fancy about the words.
Yet buyers and specifiers of valves everywhere
know and respect this simple device, this mark.
Why? Because in all the years since 1864 there has been
no compromise in the quality of Jenkins Valves. We know
it; you know it.
And that is the only way we know to make a trademark
meaningful. That will always be the Jenkins way of
making valves.

A CHALLENGE
FOR ENGINEERS

Stephen S. Attwood, Dean, College of Engineering
and Professor of Electrical Engineering.
The February issue of the Michigan
Technic, edited and published by
students in our College of Engineering,
is widely distributed to high schools
throughout the state. I want to take this
opportunity to "speak" to our high
school students who may be interested
in pursuing the exciting careers that
are possible in the fields of science and
engineering.
Science and engineering go side by
side in searching out and applying in-
creased knowledge of the fundamental
physical laws of the universe. As new
laws are discovered and utilized, we can
expect to find a steady, and even acceler-
ating, improvement in man's physical
life and well-being. This should be an
exciting challenge to many of our young
people.
There is, however, a considerable diff-
erence between the objectives of scien-
tists and engineers. The difference is not
a sharp one since any one man may work
in both areas. In general, the scientist
endeavors to extend our understanding
of the laws of nature or to discover new
laws, without being particularly con-
cerned about bow they may be applied
to the development of equipment or
processes.
The engineer's objective is to take
these laws and put them to work in
developing new designs, new processes,
new equipment, new products, new ma-
terials. But this is not all. Let's look at
a definition of engineering.
"Engineering is the profession that
applies the laws of science to the
efficient and economic conversion of
natural resources for the benefit of
man."
In this definition, note these words
"economic" and "benefit of man." In
the latter it is clear that the engineer has
to work with people, and for people, to
their benefit. This introduces problems
of human relationships that are not al-
ways easy to handle. The "economic"
phrase indicates that the engineer must
always be concerned with the cost of his
objective. Sooner or later, he may be
called upon to make decisions involving
large sums of money. This calls for char-
acter and responsibility.
In the years ahead, we foresee tre-
mendous developments that may go far
beyond many of the things we now have
—such as computers, transistors, TV,
missiles, satellites. Do some of these ideas
challenge you? If so, there is a place of
responsibility and honor for you in the
profession of engineering.
A career in engineering, full of re-
sponsibility and challenge, is not the
easiest path to follow. It calls for a basic
interest in mathematics, physical sci-
ences, and English. To be effective, ideas
must be communicated in both oral and
written form.
Let's conclude by quoting an anony-
mous poet.
We have two ends
With a common link;
With one we sit.
With one we think.
Success depends
On which we use:
Heads we win,
Tails we lose.

FRESH WATER
FROM THE SEA
As the rapidly rising demand for fresh water in
the world approaches the naturally available
supply, it becomes increasingly important that
man learn to desalt sea water cheaply and
abundantly in the near future.
by JOHN STARK
This 15,000 gallons per day
freezing process pilot plant de-
veloped by the Carrier Corp. of
Syracuse, N. Y., is now under test
af Wrightsville Beach, North Car-
olina.
During the twentieth century a serious
shortage has been developing in
many parts of the world of one of man-
kind's basic resources and most vital
needs—water. Certainly, man's peren-
nial quest for fresh water has had a pro-
found impact on the course of the human
race since the time of Moses, yet there
was always the feeling that abundant sup-
plies of water could be found if one just
looked far enough. Although our water
needs in the immediate future can be sat-
isfied by more effective utilization of our
presently available fresh water, consider-
ation of a few basic facts clearly indi-
cates that we must also increase the
fresh water supply itself.
• At present, the fundamental source
of all our fresh water for agricultural, in-
dustrial, and domestic use is rainfall.
• Of the total amount of rain falling
on the United States, about 515 billion
gallons per day are available to us for
use. This rather constant figure repre-
sents the upper limit of available freSh
water.
• The consumption of water in the
United States is increasing so rapidly that
the current rate of 290 billion gallons
per day is expected to more than double
in just twenty years, reaching an esti-
mated total of 597 billion gallons per
day in 1980.
Constant Supply, Rising Demand
It should be apparent that if sometime
before 1980 the demand for fresh water
has become equal to the supply, our
economy will suffer severely unless in
the meantime methods have been devel-
oped for greatly increasing the supply of
fresh water in this country at reasonable
cost.
Even now the demand for water has
outstripped the supply in many parts of
the United States. Southern California
currently transports its water 240 miles
from the Colorado River across moun-
tains and deserts through a complex pip-
ing system to the Pacific coast. But this
huge project will soon be inadequate. In
the November election the people of Cali-
fornia voted on the most expensive prop-
osition ever put on a ballot—a 1.75 bil-
lion dollar bond issue to utilize the water
of the Feather River 400 miles to the
north. However, shortage of water is not

a problem of California alone. A U.S.
Geological Survey study showed that in
1957 over 1000 commmunities in this
country, representing one seventh of our
entire population, experienced water
shortages of varying degrees. Nor is water
supply a problem of this country alone.
Many parts of North Africa, the Mid
East, the Caribbean and other areas al-
ready experience a severe lack of water.
Desalting the Sea
There is no doubt then that substantial
new sources of fresh water must be found
in the near future for many regions of
the world; and the most likely sources
are the salt waters of the earth—the great
oceans and the inland reserves of brack-
ish water. Of course, utilization of these
saline (salt) waters is not a new idea.
Man has dreamed of making fresh water
from the sea for centuries. And in fact
there have been commercial sea water
conversion plants operating for a num-
ber of years in scattered places on the
globe; including one on the Island of
Aruba in the Caribbean which is pro-
ducing 2,700,000 gallons of fresh water
per day. However, even the most effi-
cient of these present plants (that at
Aruba) produces water at a cost of about
$2 per 1000 gallons, which is approxi-
mately ten times the price we in the
United States currently pay for fresh
water. Since our economy consumes water
at a tremendous daily rate—e.g. the pro-
duction of 1 ton of steel requires 275
tons of water—it seems imperative that
processes be developed soon which con-
vert salt water to fresh water at a cost
comparable to that of obtaining water
from conventional sources.
Congress Acts
Recognizing the potential seriousness
of the fresh water supply problem in the
United States, Congress in 1952 passed
a Saline Water Conversion Act which
authorized the Department of the Inte-
rior to establish an Office of Saline Water
(OSW) with an initial budget of $500,-
000 to carry out research and develop-
ment activities in the conversion of
saline water. This budget was later ex-
panded to $10,000,000 as more than
forty conversion processes came under
intensive study by the OSW in their ef-
fort to determine which processes would
be most suitable for commercial opera-
tion.
In the fall of 1958 a Joint Resolution
of Congress was enacted authorizing the
construction of "demonstration plants
for the production, from saline or brack-
ish waters, of water suitable for agricul-
tural, industrial, municipal, and other
beneficial consumptive uses;" and an ad-
ditional sum of $10,000,000 was appro-
priated for the construction of five of
these demonstration plants. According to
the OSW a "demonstration plant" means
a "plant of sufficient size and capacity to
establish on a day-to-day operating basis
the optimum attainable reliability, engi-
neering, operating, and economic poten-
tial of the particular sea water conversion
process or the brackish water treatment
process selected by the Secretary of the
Interior for utilization in such plants."
The particular conversion processes
chosen for the five demonstration plants
were those processes which on the basis
of laboratory and pilot plant investiga-
tions appeared to have the greatest prom-
ise for the economic conversion of saline
water on a large scale. In Table 1 is
given a brief description and the pres-
ent status of these five OSW demonstra-
tion plants. The conversion process em-
ployed in each of these plants will be
described in some detail subsequently
in this article.
Before going further, a few of the
terms commonly used in describing water
should be clarified.
Average sea water contains about
35,000 parts per million (ppm) of
dissolved solids.
Average brackish waters contain
3000-5000 ppm of salts.
The standard for fresh or potable
water is 500 ppm (as a maximum) of
dissolved salts.
From the above figures it can be readi-
ly seen that the solution to the world's
fresh water problem lies simply in re-
moving economically from each 1000
pounds of sea water at least 54y2 of the
35 pounds of salts.
Economics of Conversion Processes
In discussing the overall problem of
producing fresh water from saline waters,
it must be kept in mind that the basic
factor is the cost of conversion. For there
are numerous chemical and physical pro-
cesses which are capable of removing the
salt from saline water; but it is vitally
important that processes be developed
and utilized in the near future that will
accomplish this conversion to fresh water
in large quantities at reasonable cost.
Since economics is the fundamental
consideration in saline water conversion,
attention should be given to the three
principle types of cost encountered. These
18

and fuel, and operation and maintenance.
Among the individual cost items found
under these general headings are pur-
chase of land, erection of the plant,
standard engineering equipment (such as
vessels, pumps, pipelines, and furnaces),
special equipment, standby facilities, in-
strumentation, raw water treatment and
storage, service facilities and buildings,
fuel, power, steam, any chemicals used
in treatment of the water, maintenance-
materials, operating and maintenance la-
bor, overhead, interest and depreciation,
taxes, and insurance.
It should be apparent that if various
conversion processes are going to be eval-
uted meaningfully on an economic
basis, all of the pertinent costs involved
must be kept in mind. Nevertheless, in
recent years optimistic cost estimates have
sporadically appeared in the press which,
upon closer study, have shown a neglect
of significant items of cost.
In order to attain uniformity in cost
estimating, the Office of Saline Water
in 1955 in cooperation with its consul-
tants developed a standardized cost esti-
mating procedure so that the economics
of all existing and proposed conversion
processes could be realistically compared.
In Table 1 are included predicted costs
as of July, I960 for the five OSW demon-
stration plants.
The large number of processes which
have been proposed for producing fresh
water from saline waters may be classed
in six general groups: 1) distillation by
various kinds of evaporators; 2) solar
distillation; 3) membrane processes; 4)
freezing of water; 5) solvent extraction;
and 6) other thermal, chemical, and elec-
trical processes.
Of these six types of processes, the
greatest amount of research and develop-
ment activity has been directed to var-
ious thermal and mechanical distillation
methods. Basically, distillation is quite
simple. The saline water in a container
is boiled and the vapor is collected and
condensed, leaving the salt behind. How-
ever, large quantities of heat energy—
about 9550 BTU's per gallon of water—
are required for this simple distillation,
and engineers have through the years
developed several evaporation processes
which use much less fuel.
Vapor Compression Distillation
One such process is "vapor compres-
sion distillation." The simple still men-
tioned above evaporates salt water to
steam at atmospheric pressure. If, how-

ever, instead of condensing this steam, it
is compressed to a pressure somewhat
greater than atmospheric, its temperature
will rise and its sensible heat can be
used to evaporate more salt water; and
the additional heat energy provided is
considerably greater than the mechanical
energy used to drive the compressor.
Many small conversion units of this type-
were used by the armed services during
World War II on islands where fresh
water was not readily available natur-
ally.
The OSW demonstration plant at Ros-
well, New Mexico will operate on a
forced-circulation vapor compression cy-
cle. (Forced circulation of the salt water
feed is used in order to increase the rate
of heat transfer in the evaporator.) Fig. 1
shows a schematic diagram of this type
of distillation plant. When salt water is
boiled in a tubular heat exchanger, the
water which vaporizes is heated further
by mechanical compression. This super-
heater vapor then condenses in the evap-
orator-condenser and in doing so again
boils an approximately equal amount of
salt water to salt-free vapor. This cycle
is repeated continually, with the distillate
being discharged through another heat
exchanger so that it preheats the saline
feed—which in New Mexico is brackish
water.
Multiple-Stage Evaporation
Another distillation process which
makes more efficient use of heat energy
than a simple still is multiple-stage long-
tube vertical evaporation. In a long-tube
vertical (LTV) evaporator, the saline
water feed is passed through tall vertical
tubes where it is made to boil by the
condensing of steam or water vapor on
the shell (outer) side of the tubss. As
the feed boils, the salt-free vapor is
removed and condensed.

stration plant now under construction by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company

INCENTIVES
Many labor and management conflicts could
be eliminated by company investigations of the
principles of incentive management.

by BRYAN WHIPPLE,
Editor-in-Chief
The Lincoln Electric Company of
Cleveland, Ohio may well be the
most unusual manufacturing concern in
the nation.
While Lincoln is a rather small com-
pany beside the giants it competes with
in its field (arc welding machinery and
supplies), it has achieved a most remark-
able record:
Lincoln has not had a work-stoppage
of any kind due to labor-management
disputes since 1933. The competition has
aggregated hundreds.
There is no labor union as such in the
Lincoln plant, only a sort of association
of employees.
The labor turn-over rate at the Lincoln
Company is about one-third that of man-
ufacturing companies in general.
Lincoln now sells most of its products
for about 80% of the sales price of 1933,
despite materials costs that average 220%
of the 1933 rate.
The compensation of the average Lin-
coln employee is about double that of the
average employee in competing electri-
cal-industry plants.
The sales value of products per em-
ployee, even at the low prices asked, is
double the electrical machine industry
average.
The average annual per cent change in
productivity per production worker at
Lincoln, between 1934 and 1950, was
plus 15.35%, while for the machinery
industry as a whole, including electrical,
the change was only plus 2.74%.
In 1956, the average Lincoln em-
ployee's compensation, including bo-
nuses and annuities, was $11,209-
How It's Done
How can the Lincoln Electric Com-
pany achieve such fantastic results in its
manufacturing operations? The secret lies
in the fundamental philosophy of the
management. The people who run Lin-
coln, right from president James F. Lin-
coln down to foremen and inspectors, are
applying a system called incentive man-
agement. This philosophy is concerned
with every facet of management to some
degree, but it is in the field of human
relations that the system is most effective,
and through which most of the remark-
able results have been achieved. The log-
ic is somewhat as follows:
1) Most production workers would
like to earn more money, and will be
willing to assume new responsibilities
and to work better {not harder) in order
to do so. In addition, these workers can
and will develop skills and abilities that
they never knew they were capable of
until they were given the encouragement
of a financial incentive.
2) These same workers once did, or
perhaps still do, enjoy participation in
rough sports and athletic contests. Into
these games and contests they poured all
of their ability, energy, and skill—and
it was fun. Why cannot similar circum-
stances, a similar atmosphere, be made
to surround industrial work? If men are
oriented toward their work as amateur
athletes are toward their sports, and there
is no fundamental reason why they ought
not to be, industrial production will be
greately benefited and the worker will
find his employment more enjoyable.
3) Recognition of superior employee
effort is a third way in which smooth,
efficient operation of the Lincoln plant is
gained. Recognition is implied in 1) and
2) above, but should also be given to de-
serving employees for its own sake, in
the form of promotions tied only to mer-
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


on good workmanship, and so forth. A
friendly and cooperative manner between
all levels of workers is thus gained; this
is essential in achieving continually out-
standing performance.
System Really Works
This nutshell treatment of the very
successful incentive philosophy at Lin-
coln Electric is hardly sufficient to con-
vince most persons who have no first
hand acquaintance with incentives that
such simple rules, when honestly and
continually applied, can have such sur-
prising results. These tenets stem to be
little more than the usual industrial ver-
sion of how to "win friends and influ-
ence people." One might be inclined to
think that such policies would bring
about increases in productvity on the
order of 10% to 15%.
However, these tenets are not mere
policies, they are a philosophy. Their
total application, in every phase of Lin-
coln activity, results in productivity two
to four times that of the competition. For
example, since the company firmly be-
lieves that workers ought to be rewarded
for their efficiency, the company has an
elaborate scheme by which the employees
are able to buy and own most of the
stock. This encourages the employees to
think as if they were the managers, for,
as stockholders, they are on the "man-
agement side" as well as on the "labor
side." Since dividends go to those who
are responsible for their size, their size
tends to be assured. This internal owner-
ship also helps the employees to realize
that the company exists for their benefit,
and that it is good sense to help it
prosper.
Explained in Book
The entire system of "Incentive Man-
agement" is explained in detail in a very
interesting book by that title written by
company president James F. Lincoln. The
book has been privately published by the
Lincoln Electric Company. The price of
the 284-page hard-cover volume has been
set in accordance with the principles
described therein—Si. I believe it may
also be found in the engineering library.
Those wishing to purchase a copy may
the system is so successful, it has not
been used elsewhere—for instance, by
Lincoln's competition—there is an an-
swer. The Lincoln plan requires a great
deal of nonconformist thinking to estab-
lish it in a plant; the managers and own-
ers alike must adopt a viewpoint on
certain matters of corporate organization
and policy that are heretical. Mere emu-

The foregoing has been an unpaid
commercial, but not for the book—I am
sure that even Lincoln cannot be mak-
ing much at that price—rather for the
philosophy it contains. Even those engi-
neers who may never be called upon to
supervise workers in a factory should
note the amazing achievement of this
company and recall it occasionally as
proof that men are capable of much
more than they are apt to believe. Only
adequate incentive is necessary to effect
such miracles.
Stumbling Block
For those who might wonder why, if
lation of some of the ideas at Lincoln is
insufficient. Incentive managers must take
the system to their hearts, and let no
shred of traditional thought once deter
them. In addition, they must be unusually
capable managers in all the ordinary as-
pects. Management-ownership attitudes,
prejudices, inclinations, and abilities are
the determinants of incentive-philosophy
success.
If the basic tenets of this philosophy-
were read and appreciated for their
worth by one-tenth of all future manag-
ers, our national industrial wealth and
living standard might be doubled.

The comparative compensation of the workers in The Lincoln Electric Company compared to the workers in six major corpo-
rations in the United States. Note that as the incentive system became better understood, the wage reward increased.

lights begins flashing to indicate truth or
lie as the case may be.
The above—though it may be over-
dramatized—is the conception many peo-
ple have of a lie detector in operation.
Unfortunately, there is no machine in
existence which can detect a lie as easily
and as accurately as this hypothetical de-
vice. However, a machine—the poly-
graph—does exist which records certain
physiological phenomena; these records
can then be used as a reliable criterion
for spotting deception. Before we discuss
the operation of polygraphs, however,
we should know the nature of the above
mentioned physiological phenomena.
Physiological Principles
A multitude of experiments have es-
tablished that emotions have a definite
and immediate effect on certain bodily
functions. These effects are due to the
action of one area of the brain, the hy-
pothalmus, which acts as a control center
for the integration of body functions
with emotional pressures. When stimu-
lated by an emotional change, the hypo-
thalmus causes a corresponding change
in circulation, respiration, digestion, me-
tabolism, glandular activity, and body
electrical resistance.
It has also been established that emo-
tions can't be turned on and off at will.
An accomplished actor may be able to
conceal all outward signs of emotion such
as facial expression and tone of voice, but
he can do nothing to control the physio-
logical effects of his emotions.
In most cases telling a lie is accom-
panied by a powerful emotion: fear of
detection. Yet, in laboratory experiments
using volunteers who had nothing to fear
from detection, polygraphs consistently
indicated emotional changes accompanin«
lies. A possible explanation is that the
subject enters into the "spirit of the
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


and is especially anxious to see if the ma-
chine will be able to detect his lies. It
seems, then, that telling a lie is almost
invariably accompanied by an emotional
change of some sort.
Mechanical Functioning
The polygraph does not actually tell
whether or not a person is lying; it does
detect and indicate emotional changes by
recording changes in certain bodily func-
tions: specifically, the skin's electrical
resistance, blood pressure, heart beat, and
breathing rate. The machine itself consists
of three main parts—the pneumograph,
the galvanograph, and the cordio-sphyg-
mograph—and operates in an unexpect-
edly simple manner.
The instrument which records the
breathing pattern is the pneumograph. It
consists of an accordian-shaped tube
which is strapped to the subject's chest.
Breathing causes the tube to expand and
contract thus changing the interior air
pressure. This change in air pressure is
transmitted through a rubber tube to the
breathing rate bellows pictured in figure
(1); this, in turn, causes the bellows,
which operates a recording pen through
a mechanical linkage, to expand and
contract. Thus the movements of the pen
correspond to the subject's breathing and
the resulting pattern is recorded as a
wave form on a moving sheet of graph
paper. Any change in the subject's breath-
ing pattern (indicating an emotional
change) will be evident as a change in
the wave form.
The cardio-sphygmograph, which op-
erates in a manner similar to the pneu-
mograph, records blood pressure and
heartbeat. It consists of a standard blood
pressure cuff like those found in any
doctor's office. The cuff is wound around
the subject's upper arm and inflated with
air. Each heartbeat causes blood to flow
through and expand the arteries in the
arm; the strength of the expansion will
depend on the blood pressure. These ex-
pansions and contractions cause a corre-
sponding action in the blood pressure
cuff which results in a change of the in-
terior air pressure. The pressure change
operates the bellows pictured in figure
(2) which moves another recording pen.
Thus, any change in heartbeat or blood
pressure will, like a change in breathing
rate, be evident as a change in wave
form.
There is an important reason for the
difference in the shapes of the two bel-
lows. The pneumograph bellows oper-

ates at close to normal air pressures. How-
ever, since the blood pressure cuff is in-
flated to higher pressures, it would strain
a bellows of this type beyond its limits.
The bellows in figure (2) allows a great-
er expansion and thus eliminates the
possibilities of its being ruptured.
The galvanograph circuitry consists of
a wheatstone bridge. One of the resis-
tances is formed by the subject's palm,
which is connected to the circuit by two
electrodes. A change in the skin's resis-
tance, which is thought to be caused by
a change in the body's neural currents,
will cause a current to flow through a
galvanometer movement thus operating
a recording pen. As a result, any change
in skin resistance is indicated as a change
in a third wave form. The three wave
forms mentioned are recorded simulta-
neously on a single sheet of moving
graph paper.
Operating Procedure
The basic operating procedure of the
polygraph is as relatively simple as its
mechanical construction. First, the various

New electronic ranges that cook by high fre-
quency microwaves may soon replace the con-
ventional kitchen range.

These are just a few of the amazing
cooking feats now being performed by
a new electronic range that cooks by
high frequency microwaves rather than
conventional electric heat.
Electronic Range Opens Up New
Cooking Era
Termed a "range" instead of an oven
because it cooks 90% of foods ordinar-
ily cooked on surface units, this new de-
velopment opens up an entirely new

cooking era. Cooking is done in minutes
instead of hours, and foods can be
cooked on serving dishes of fine china,
paper plates, glass and other non-me-
tallic utensils.
Microwaves Have Unique Properties
The electronic range cooks by high
frequency microwaves which have unique
properties. Materials in the microwaves'
path do one of three things: reflect, such
as all metal surfaces; transmit, such as
paper, cardboard, and glass; or absorb,
such as foods.
Magnetron Generates Microwaves
A magnetron, a two-element vacuum
tube in which the flow of electrons is
under the influence of an external mag-
netic field, is used to generate extremely
short radio waves called microwaves.
These microwaves travel forward from
the magnetron through a wave guide and
are reflected downward into the range
cavity, where a stirrer, or four-blade fan,
distributes the waves uniformly through-
out the range interior to prevent im-
properly distributed energy from causing
"hot spots" in the food. The magnetron
24
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


cycles per second and has a useful energy
output of about one kilowatt-hour. The
electronic range operates on a 220-volt
electric current, just as a conventional
electric range.
Once the microwaves have reached the
range interior, they cook the food by pen-
etrating it up to a depth of two and one-
half inches, causing agitation of mole-
cules and friction to produce heat for
cooking.
Chromium Range Liner Cooks Food
Evenly
In this new electronic rang;, a chro-
mium lining is used instead of the enam-
eled raw steel liner used in a convention-
al oven. The chrome provides a shield
through which the microwave energy can-
not penetrate, for although all metals will
absorb some energy, non-magnetic ma-
terials such as chromium absorb far less
energy than magnetic materials like enam-
eled steel. As a practical example, a com-
bination microwave infra-red range was
recently developed by the Westinghouse
Electric Corporation. The Westinghouse
engineers found that the energy losses
due to absorption in this combination
oven with a chrome-plated oven liner
were about 150 watt-hours lower than
the losses of the raw steel oven liner. As
a result, food cooks from all sides at
once because microwaves striking the
chromium lining of the range are con-
tinually reflected and literally bombard
the food.

Baking by telephone is now a reality. As demonstrated here by Miss Joyce Leicht,
engineers of Westinghouse Electric Corp. turn on and off by telephone
any electrical appliance.
Baking by Telephone Now a Reality
In conjunction with this development,
Westinghouse engineers have also devel-
oped a new method of operating ovens
and other electric household appliances.
Fantastic as it sounds, "baking by tele-
phone" is now a reality. With equipment
that is commercially available today a
housewife may pick up the nearest tele-

phone, dial her home number, and, by
means of a special relay system, the oven
may be turned on or off, depending on
previous settings. Distance is no barrier
and the system can be applied to virtually
any electric appliance.
Electronic Range Has Special Browning
Element
Because foods cooked in less than 18
minutes will not brown, the electronic
range has a specially-designed, high-
speed browning element for browning
that may be operated simultaneously with
the microwave cooking. This browning
clement is useful when cooking broiler
steaks and other foods requiring brown-
ing or crust.
New Range Operates Easily
All functions of the electronic range-
are controlled by four knobs above the
door. One knob turns on the main power,
while another activates the magnetron
for microwave cooking and automatically
times the cooking operation. A "Hi-Lo"
selector permits an alternate speed for
cooking such items as roasts. The fourth
knob controls the browning element and
is calibrated up to five minutes.
In addition, a built-in safety feature
stops electronic cooking immediately
when the door is opened. Cooking can be
watched through a perforated metal pan-
el in the door which also serves as a vent

Servicing the microwave components
is relatively easy. Almost all of these parts
may be repaired or replaced from the
front of the range after the lower front
panel is removed.
New Comfort and Safety Features
Introduced
The advantages offered by the new
electronic range are many and varied.
Probably its most impressive advantage
is the remarkable cooking speeds made
possible. For example, a two-layer cake
bakes in six minutes compared to about
30 minutes in a conventional oven; one
from the range to the table, since uten-
sils only become hot as heat from food
is transmitted to them. Hot pads are re-
quired only when the special browning
element is used.
Temperature is eliminated as a cook-
ing factor and all cooking is determined
by time. The microwave cooking control
contains an automatic timer calibrated in
seconds and minutes; when cooking
time is completed, a signal bell rings un-
til manually stopped.
Another advantage is that stale bread
and rolls can be refreshed as if they had
just been taken from a baker's oven.
Left-overs and complete meals can also

Here, an electronic oven heats food and water without heating the containers.
potato bakes in four minutes and eight
potatoes bake in eight minutes compared
to about 45 minutes in both cases in a
conventional oven; a frozen turkey cooks
in 5 minutes per pound compared to
about 25 minutes per pound in a con-
ventional oven.
Advantages other than speed are
gained from microwave cooking. Elec-
tronic cooking is cool because the micro-
waves create heat only in the food and
not in the utensils and range interior.
Thus, food can be cooked in serving
dishes and taken by hand immediately
be reheated without loss of flavor or
moisture, and foods have greater nutri-
tional value because fast, microwave cook-
ing results in a greater retention of min-
erals and vitamins than does slow, con-
ventional electric cooking.
Also, food odors are greatly reduced in
electronic cooking because food is cooked
too fast for odors to circulate.
Microwave cooking cuts down on dish-
washing because food is cooked so fast
it does not have time to adhere to the
sides of dishes and utensils. Similarly,
cleaning the range is comparatively sim-
ple because spattered or spilled foods are
not baked to the cool oven sides and
may be wiped off with a damp cloth.
Microwave Cooking a Reality in the
Near Future
Even now, such corporations as West-
inghouse, American Motors, and General
Electric have developed either a single-
microwave cooking unit or a combination
microwave infra-red range that is highly
effective. Incidentally, many home econo-
mists have reacted more enthusiastically
to the latter arrangement. Since even the
strongest advocates of microwave cooking
admit that conventional cooking does
some things better and they do not fore-
see an end to conventional ovens or sur-
face units, it was felt by many economists
that a combination range should be de-
signed first. In this way, homemakers
will be able to "fall back" on the con-
ventional oven while they are learning to
fit microwave cooking into their pro-
grams. Therefore, a combination range-
would be a step forward in that a double-
oven installation would not be required.
Two Main Factors Stunt Growth of
Microwave Cooking
Although the microwave range has
"wrinkles" that must be "ironed out,"
just as any other new development, most
home economists feel that there are only-
two main factors stunting the growth of
microwave cooking. The main one and
the only one of importance right now is
the prohibitive cost of these ranges oc-
casioned by the present high cost of
microwave components. (A typical single-
microwave cooking unit currently costs
about $1200, including delivery and in-
stallation.) However, it is generally felt
that the next few years will see the price-
drop sufficiently for microwave cooking
to reach a mass market.
As the price comes down the second
retarding factor will assume importance,
that being the natural reluctance of home-
makers to change their cooking habits
overnight. A considerable educationaJ
program in the form of advertising and
personal demonstrations will be needed
to combat this factor.
Once these two problems have been
overcome, the electronic range will un-
doubtedly begin to reach a mass market.
The next few years should see this time-
and effort-saving "oven of the future"
adopted by the American homemaker as
standard kitchen equipment.

What's it take to make the right connection?
Plenty! Consider the problem. Western Electric manufac-
tures the switching systems which connect some 60-million
Bell telephones throughout the U. S. The average call over
today's electromechanical system requires 420 relay opera-
tions. All together, this interconnecting equipment makes
up the heart of what is, in effect, the world's largest machine.
That's where Western Electric and you come in. The
switching equipment for this "machine" involves an enor-
mous manufacturing job carried on by our plants throughout
the country. Because of the size and service requirements
involved, we require quality standards far exceeding those
of ordinary manufacturing. The size of this job presents an
unusual challenge to the engineer who may save the Bell
System many thousands of dollars by even a small cost-
reduction step.
While today's switching calls for a priority on engineer-
ing, tomorrow's will be even more exciting. For even now
the revolutionary Electronic Central Office is under field
trial and promises to remake the world of telephony. Future
Western Electric engineers, working closely with their
counterparts at Bell Telephone Laboratories, will concen-
trate heavily on developing manufacturing methods for this
ECO equipment.
Your Western Electric assignments may cover many of
our other responsibilities as the world's leading communica-
tions manufacturer. Perhaps you'll work on advances in
microwave transmission, or even on satellite communications.
Joining Western Electric may well be your right
connection.

Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a
favorable engineering atmosphere.
Back in 1925, when Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft was
designing and developing the first of its family of
history-making powerplants, an attitude was born—a
recognition that engineering excellence was the key
to success.
That attitude, that recognition of the prime impor-
tance of technical superiority is still predominant at
P&amp;WA today.
The field, of course, is broader now, the challenge
greater. No longer are the company's requirements
confined to graduates with degrees in mechanical
and aeronautical engineering. Pratt &amp; Whitney Air-
craft today is concerned with the development of
all forms of flight propulsion systems for the aero-
space medium—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and
other advanced types. Some are entirely new in
concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with
degrees in mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chem-
ical and nuclear engineering are needed, along
with those holding degrees in physics, chemistry
and metallurgy.
Specifically, what would you dot—your own engi-
neering talent provides the best answer. And Pratt
&amp; Whitney Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which
that talent can flourish.
For further information regarding an engineering
career at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, consult your col-
lege placement officer or write to Mr. R. P. Azinger,
Engineering Department, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft,
East Hartford 8, Connecticut.

At P&amp;WA's Connecticut Aircraft Nuclear Engine Lab-
oratory (CANEL) many technical talents are focused
on the development of nuclear propulsion systems for
future air and space vehicles. With this live mock-up
of a reactor, nuclear scientists and engineers can
determine critical mass, material reactivity coefficients,
control effectiveness and other reactor parameters.

Representative of electronic aids functioning for P&amp;WA
engineers is this on-site data recording center which
can provide automatically recorded and computed
data simultaneously with the testing of an engine. This
equipment is capable of recording 1,200 different
values per second.

Studies of solar energy collection and liquid and vapor
power cycles typify P&amp;WA's research in advanced
space auxiliary power systems. Analytical and Experi-
mental Engineers work together in such programs to
establish and test basic concepts.

Just before the Christmas holidays, a
serious air crash over New York City
proved to be the worst disaster in air-
plane history. This month Michigan Ed-
ucation and Research presents the views
of a Michigan faculty member on how
this disaster and crashes similar to it can
be avoided. Also covered are clips re-
garding Cancer research at Michigan, in-
ternational work of the Phoenix Project,
aging of the Great Lakes, and the inter-
esting facts surrounding the launching
of the Russian Satelite Sputnik I and
the increase of Russian studies at the
University.
Safety in Air Traffic
A University of Michigan expert called
for a "crash program" to improve the
nation's air traffic control system, accom-
panied by a long-range research program
in flight safety.
Prof. Paul M. Fitts (Ph.D) of the
U-M Department of Psychology said
"much better" voice communication is
needed between pilots and ground con-
trol centers and this can be developed
with existing equipment.
More importantly radar beacons —
called transponders—could be installed
in major commercial aircraft, permitting
clearer visibility and positive identifica-
tion of planes on ground-based radar,
regardless of weather conditions.
Transponders already arc used in mili-
tary aircraft.
"With these kinds of equipment im-
provements, humans can do a much bet-
ter job of air traffic control until com-
puters may be developed to help handle
this task," he commented.
"In addition to a short-range program
involving use of on-the-shelf hardware,


Prof. Paul M. Fitts, Department of
Psychology
we need long-range research to determine
the optimum balance between human and
mechanized control of air traffic.
"Finding out how to build an ideal
air traffic control system will take many
years of research. In the meantime, we
should apply what we already know as
best we can."
One of the nation's leading researchers
on man-machine systems, Fitts formerly
directed the Aviation Psychology Labora-
tory at Ohio State University, studying air
traffic control programs. He was one
of the founders of the Flight Safety
Foundation.
Sputnik and Russian
Russian used to be just another for-
eign language before Sputniks — but
science students now take Russian se-
riously, says Associate Prof. Horace W.
Dewey of The University of Michigan
Department of Slavic Languages and Lit-
eratures.
"More students in science fields are
studying Russian than ever before," he
says. The U-M has offered two special
reading courses in Russian for the past 10
years for the purpose of providing a read-
ing knowledge of Russian for research in
science, mathematics, social sciences, and
humanities. But it was not until the Sput-

gan taking the courses, Dewey reports.
Only upperclass and graduate students
can take the courses, and a grade of B or
better satisfies the doctoral language re-
quirement.
Science students in these courses are
in a hurry to acquire at least the read-
ing knowledge of Russian, Dewey points
out, since some of the important scien-
tific papers in Russian are not available
immediately in translation.
"Although students in these courses
can read important material, they would
have a hard time in communicating in
spoken, Russians still have a lot to learn
in certain fields of engineering or in
fields like orthopedic surgery."
Phoenix Project Helps Thailand
Thailand is well on the way to acquir-
ing its first nuclear reactor for peaceful
research on atomic energy. Construction
of the reactor by an American firm is
expected to begin soon.
The University of Michigan through
its Phoenix Project is helping the Thais
with their project. This year William
Kerr flew to Bangkok to advise the Thai
government on training scientific person-
In 1957, Professor Kerr first visited
Thailand to discuss the training of per-
sons to administer and set up the re-
search and reactor program. Since then,
the Thai government has sent four per-
sons to the U-M for reactor training and
instruction in nuclear engineering. Two
have completed their training and have
returned to Thailand. Two are now study-
ing in the U-M's graduate program in
nuclear engineering.
The Thai reactor, to be located near
Bangkok, will be operated by Chulalong-
korn University under the auspices of the
Thai atomic energy commission.

basis from which they can further their
study in Russian. The main thing they
seem to want is a reading knowledge,
and since they come from highly special-
ized scientific fields they have a limited
time to devote to language studies."
Of course, not all Russian scientific
writing is of high caliber, Dewey cau-
tions. "In mathematics, physics, and chem-
istry, however, the Russians have made
significant progresses, and, "according to

such assistance to underdeveloped na-

Manned space missions of extended flight
duration must have a large, continuous, long last-
ing and reliable source of electrical power. Only
a nuclear reactor heat source is compatible with
these requirements to provide power for propul-
sion and to operate all equipment aboard the
spacecraft. Advanced nuclear energy conversion
systems are now being developed by Garrett's
AiResearch divisions to meet these new power
requirements.
Besides nuclear and solar power systems for
space applications, other project areas at Garrett
include: electronic systems, such as flight data com-
puters and solid state transistorized conversion
systems for high speed generators; and complete
environmental systems for advanced flight vehicles.
This diversification of project areas enables
the engineer at Garrett to specialize or diversify
according to his interest, not only making work
more interesting but increasing the opportunities
for responsibility and advancement.
An orientation program lasting a number of
months is available for the newly graduated engi-
neer, working on assignments with highly experi-
enced engineers in laboratory, preliminary design
and development projects. In this way his most
profitable areas of interest can be found.

A multi-stage LTV evaporator consists
of a number of individual evaporators, or
stages, in each of which saline water
flows through the vertical tubes. In the
first stage externally supplied steam is
used on the shell side to effect evapora-
tion. The vapor from this first stage
then enters the shell side of the second
drop from stage to stage in order that
evaporation takes place. Large stills of
this type of twenty or more stages have
been proposed as the cheapest way of
making fresh water from the ocean on
a major scale.
The OSW demonstration plant at
Freeport, Texas is a long-tube vertical

stage where it condenses and is collected
as distilled water; but in condensing it re-
leases latent heat sufficient to evaporate
water in the tubes of the second stage.
The vapor from the tubc-s of this second
stage then evaporates more water when
it condenses in the third stage and so on.
Because of heat losses the temperature of
the water vapor leaving each stage is
lower than that of the previous one and
there must be a corresponding pressure
evaporator system of 12 stages, as can
be seen in the model, Fig. 2. Construc-
tion of this plant, which was designed by
W. L. Badger and Associates of Ann Ar-
bor, was begun in August by the Chi-
cago Bridge and Iron Company. When
completed, 1,000,000 gallons per day of
fresh water will be produced in the
plant's twelve stages, with the first stage
operating at a temperature of 250° F and
the final stage at 110° F.
Scaling and Corrosion—Two Major
Problems
Although distillation currently seems
to be the best way of producing fresh
water, two serious problems are encoun-
tered in the actual operation of evapora-
tors. These difficulties are the corrosion
and scaling of the distillation equipment,
particularly the heating surfaces. Sea
water is a highly corrosive solution, and
hence the development and us; of corro-
sion-resistant materials of construction
is important. Extensive tests were made
of different materials by the International
Nickel Company and W. L. Badger and
Associates during the operation of the
OSW pilot plant long-tube vertical evap-
orator at Wrightsville Beach, North Caro-
lina.
Badger concluded that steel can be
used as a material for the construction of
the evaporators, pumps, and piping but
probably not for the heating surfaces.
Of the more expensive materials, alumi-
num is unsatisfactory due to severe pit-
ting in sea water, while aluminum brass,
90-10 copper-nickel alloy, and admiralty
metal resist quite well the attack of sea
water. What may be the most economical
heat transfer surface is a thin layer of a
corrosion-resistant metal backed up by-
cheaper steel. Other possibilities for
evaporator construction which have not
been sufficiently explored are the plastics,
glasses, and ceramics.
Intensive study has also been carried
out at Wrightsville Beach of the scaling
of heating surfaces during distillation.
Scale is defined by Badger as a deposit
formed by precipitation from solution
of a substance which has a solubility that
decreases with an increase in tempera-
ture. Since in an evaporator the highest
temperature is at the heated surface and
hence the solubility of the scale-forming
material is lowest there, deposition will
most likely occur on that surface. The
University of Michigan Research Insti-
tute is currently conducting an investiga-
tion headed by Professor K. F. Gordon
of the Chemical Engineering Department
with the objective of obtaining a better
knowledge of the mechanism and limits
of scale formation on a heated surface
in order to provide a sound basis for de-
veloping methods of scale prevention.

For, none of the methods currently used
to combat the formation of scale is
wholly effective.
Multistage Flash Distillation
There is a rather new distillation meth-
od — multistage flash distillation — in
which scaling is not as serious a problem.
Flash distillation is based on the equilib-
rium principle that if heated water is in-
troduced into a container having an am-
bient pressure less than the vapor pres-
sure of water at that temperature, some
of the water will vaporize. In a multi-
stage flash distillation unit, saline water
is preheated under pressure and then
fed into a vessel where the pressure is
lower than the equilibrium pressure of
the feed. Because of the reduced pressure,
part of the feed water flashes into vapor,
thereby lowering the liquid temperature.
The flashed vapor then condenses in a
condenser (through which the saline
feed is passing—so as to make use
of the heat of condensation). The liquid
which remains then passes to the next
vessel where the pressure is still lower,
(Continued from page 34)
and the flashing process is repeated. A
flash distillation unit of 42 stages will be
built at San Diego, California by the
Fluor Corporation as one of the OSW
demonstration plants (Fig. 3). Original
plans to have a nuclear reactor supply
the energy for this plant have recently
been suspended.
Harnessing Solar Energy
Considerably different than the distil-
lation processes described thus far is the
attempt by engineers to harness the en-
ergy of the sun for the distillation of
saline waters. Interest in solar stills cen-
ters around the fact that one of the ma-
jor costs of saline water conversion—fuel
or energy—is eliminated if the sun's en-
ergy can be effectively utilized. The sim-
plest form of solar still consists of a
shallow pan containing salt water and
covered with a sloping glass plate which
is transparent to the radiation of the
sun. As water is evaporated from the pan
by the sun's rays, the vapor condenses on
the underside of the glass cover and
trickles down the glass to a trough in
which the drops are collected. In order
to produce fresh water on a large scale,
solar stills covering many acres would
be needed. A substantial saving in equip-
ment costs would result, however, from
the use of inexpensive, transparent and
durable plastics rather than glass.
Currently, the greatest amount of ac-
tivity in the development of solar stills
is found in the Mediterranean countries.
Among the organizations conducting
studies are the National Commission of
Special Energies in Spain, the National
Physical Laboratory of Israel, the Univer-
sity of Bologna in Italy, the Academy of
Sciences of the U.S.S.R., and govern-
ment groups in the countries of North
Africa.
Using Membranes and Electric Current
Now let us consider methods other
than distillation that may be employed
for the removal of salt from saline wa-
ters. One of the most interesting methods
of conversion is the membrane process
known as electrodialysis. Electrodialysis

Each 6,000,000 pound thrust rocket ship now being planned for manned
interplanetary exploration will gulp as much propellant as the entire capac-
ity of a 170 passenger DC-8 Jetliner in less than 4 seconds! It will consume
1,140 tons in the rocket's approximately 2 minutes of burning time. Required
to carry this vast quantity of propellant will be tanks tall as 8 story buildings,
strong enough to withstand tremendous G forces, yet of minimum weight.
Douglas is especially qualified to build giant-sized space ships of this type

utilizes an electric current, two electrodes,
and thin membranes which permit the
passage of either only positive ions (ca-
tion exchange membranes) or only nega-
tive ions (anion exchange membranes).
This process can be understood by
studying the operation of the electrodialy-
sis cell of Fig. 4. Between the two elec-
trodes are alternately placed anion and
cation exchange membranes. (The anion
exchange membranes are labeled A( —)
and the cation exchange membranes C
( + ).) Saline water is allowed to enter
the cell so that, before a current is ap-
plied, in each compartment there is wa-
ter containing an assortment of positive
(mostly sodium) and negative (mostly
chloride) ions. By referring to the fig-
ure, the migration of ions which takes
place when current is applied can be fol-
lowed. The general observation should
first be made that the positive ions, be-
ing attracted to the negative electrode,
will tend to travel to the left unless im-
peded and the negative ions, being at-
tracted to the positive electrode, to the
right.
In compartment W, the positive ions
will be attracted to the left electrode and
will stay in W,; the negative ions would
like to move to the right out of W, but
cannot because membrane Cn will not
pass anions. Hence the concentration of
salt will build up in compartment W,.
Looking at compartment P, on the other
hand, it is seen that the positive ions can
move out of P, to the left through Cn
and the negative ions can move out to
the right through A12. Compartment P,
then will contain nearly pure water. As
a result, the cell will be composed of
compartments alternately high and low
in salt concentration which can be drained
to obtain reject brine and fresh water
respectively.
Unlike most other conversion processes,
the power requirements for electrodialy-
sis depend directly on the concentration
of salts in the feed. For this reason, this
process is most suitable to brackish water
feed—as will be used in the OSW dem-
onstration plant at Webster, South Da-
kota.
Making Fresh Water by Refrigeration
Another means of extracting fresh
water from saline waters which at pres-
ent compares favorably cost-wise with
processes discussed thus far is by refrig-
eration or freezing. In principle, freez-
ing is the opposite of distillation. Where-
as in distillation heat is applied to water
and salt-free vapor taken off overhead,
in freezing processes heat is removed
from water and relatively salt-free ice
produced.
From the standpoint of energy require-
ments, conversion by freezing has an in-
herent advantage over distillation—to
freeze one pound of water 144 BTU's
must be removed from it while to evap-
orate the same pound 972 BTU's of ener-
gy must be supplied. Another advantage

Figure 4.—Brackish water can be de-
salted by the application of an electric
current to an electrodialysis cell in
which anion and cation exchange resins
are alternately arranged.
of freezing is that the scale-formation
problems encountered in distillation pro-
cesses are not nearly as significant at low
operating temperatures. However, freez-
ing methods do involve a difficult sepa-
ration step—washing the product ice
free of unwanted brine.
In a freeze-process plant, saline feed is
first cooled by heat exchange with prod-
uct fresh water and rejected brine. Then
the liquid feed is partially frozen, pro-
ducing some vapor (which is removed
overhead) and a slurry of ice in brine.
Now the slurry is sent to a washing col-
umn where the brine is drained off and
the ice washed. Finally the washed ice is
melted and fresh water obtaind.
The fifth OSW demonstration plant,
to be built on the East Coast, will employ
one of three freezing processes which are
now in the pilot plant stage. These pro-
cesses differ mainly in the manner in
which the actual freezing step is carried
out.

line water conversion processes that are

Harley A. Cloud (BSEE, Penn State '58) is a group leader
in the development of simulation testing equipment for a
new solid state airborne computer which IBM is building
for the Air Force.
TRIPS THROUGH THE STRATOSPHERE
WITHOUT LEAVING THE GROUND
A computer will be the heart of the navigation and control
systems for future aircraft designed to operate in the
stratosphere.
Such a computer is now being built by IBM for an advanced
aircraft under development for the Air Force. Harley Cloud,
an IBM engineer, is developing simulation equipment which
will put the computer through its paces. His equipment
will simulate the systems functions encountered by the
250-ton aircraft at Mach 3, fourteen miles up, with poten-
tial adversaries in wait.
Without the airplane leaving the ground, his testing equip-
ment will simulate such inputs to the computer as accelera-
tion in the inertia! system, velocity in the doppler radar, and
air pressure in the air data subsystem. These simulation
techniques will help protect lead time for the entire project.
Responsibilities Are Large. As a group leader, he is direct-
ing the design, laboratory breadboarding, electrical draft-
ing, testing and evaluation of this ingenious equipment.
It's a very responsible job for a man out of school less
than three years.
But age is no barrier to advancement in IBM. In the fast
moving world of data systems, it is ideas and the ability
to do the job that count. And fresh new ideas and abilities
are always welcomed at IBM—whether in development, re-
search, manufacturing, or programming.
If you feel you might be interested in one of these fields
associated with data systems at IBM, you might discuss
it with the IBM representative. Your placement office can

The 128 research studies cover subjects
ranging from fundamental physical and
chemical principles to the highly complex
effects of modern clinical treatment.
Many of the investigations seek new
knowledge of normal growth. According
to the report, "Progress toward the solu-
tion of the cancer problem has been slow
because too little is known about normal
cells."
Other studies attempt to find variations
among different kinds of cancer, the ef-
fects of hormancs and anticancer com-
pounds, and the clinical value of radia-
tion.

World famous University Hospital,
center of the current program
of cancer research.
In the field of virus research, the report
states "It still has not been definitely
established that cancer in man is the re-
sult of any known virus, although some
evidence is beginning to accumulate . . .
A culture of (cancerous) mouse cells
has been found to contain a virus. This
virus will produce tumors in mice (and),
in tissue culture, this virus will trans-
form normal human cells into growing
cancer-like cells."
Teaching programs on cancer, says the
report, include regular courses in the
Medical School curriculum, special lec-
tures, demonstrations, conferences and su-
pervised investigations. "Particular atten-
tion is directed to arranging special lec-
tures by visiting clinicians and investiga-
tors who present first-hand their recent
observations ..."
The report also describes the broad
range of cancer diagnosis and treatment
being conducted at the U-M Medical Cen-
ter. This includes use of drugs by the
Cancer Chemotherapy Unit, expanding
use of radioisotopes, and efforts to com-
bat leukemia.
Sources of funds for U-M cancer re-
search, states the report, include the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, American
Cancer Society, the U-M Memorial Phoe-
nix Project, and a number of private do-
nors and foundations.
Youthful Fountain?
The Great Lakes contain the world's
largest supply of fresh water—6,700,-
000,000,000,000 gallons of it. But a
University of Michigan oceanographer
has warned that unless steps are taken to
preserve these Lakes, "our children's
children may be catching rain water or
distilling sea water to allay their thirst."
Now U-M Great Lakes scientists be-
lieve they may be close to a method which
could lead to means of preserving the
Lakes as a fresh water resource. The
problem isn't that the 66 million people
in states touching the Great Lakes will
drink them dry. Even if they were to use
the water at 50 gallons per person per
day, without replenishment, it would be
some 5,500 years before they reached
final mud. The problem is, rather, what
man dumps into the lakes—sewage and
industrial wastes. These chemical and or-
ganic materials "age" the Great Lakes
faster than they would age naturally.
To somehow control this aging process,
thus preserving and furthering the Great
Lakes use as a natural resource, is the
long term goal of the Great Lakes Re-
search Division (GLRD) of the U-M's
Institute of Science and Technology. Di-
vision scientists now are approaching a
first step toward this goal, according to
GLRD Director David C. Chandler
(Ph.D.), in devising a method to meas-
ure the rate at which organic material is
produced in the Lakes.
If they can find a way to determine
this quickly and over a wide area, they
could then perhaps begin to understand
this process, following which they could
seek ways of controlling it—and thus of
managing the aging of the Lakes. They
would like to be able to measure the
rate of photosynthesis that occurs in a
given column of water—or how much
organic material is fixed in the water in
a day. (Photosynthesis is the method in
nature, still not wholly understood, by
which sunlight as energy is converted to
vegetable organic matter.) Their method,
which would be a measure of the energy-
nutrient chain, is a refinement of some-
what similar methods reported by other
scientists and was developed largely by
Dr. George W. Saunders, Jr. (Ph.D.).
It would work like this: Sunlight enter-
ing the water is the source of energy for
the tiniest species of aquatic life, which
in turn produce organic matter that serves
as food (a source of energy) for larger
organisms, in a long and complicated
chain. The amount of organic matter pro-
duced depends on the intensity of sun-
light which decreases with increasing
depth.

A "stream-of-action" environment with unusual growth
possibilities should be a major factor in a choice of
career. And that's an excellent reason for considering
carefully the opportunities existing in Sikorsky Aircraft.
We believe that our company is just the "right-sized
stream". Young engineers can enjoy diversified, small-
group activities, as well as stature opportunities in a
field that is wide open to the expression of imagination
and professional competence.
Sikorsky Aircraft is the company which pioneered the
modern helicopter. Our current program is far-ranging
and is recognized as one of the broadest and most
challenging in the entire aircraft industry.
Work associations are stimulating and in an atmosphere
of progress. Assignments could include joining an elec-
tronic team of twenty to thirty associates—or—working
with a highly selective group of four or five on interest-
ing problems of radiation, instrumentation, auto pilot-
age, automatic stabilization, etc.
If you want to enter this "stream-of-action", the time is
now. Opportunities for personal progress have never
been greater.

FRESH WATER FROM THE SEA
(Continued from page 42)
currently in the advanced development
or pilot plant stage have been described.
However, research and initial develop-
ment work is being carried out on a va-
riety of other conversion processes which
should at least be mentioned. Since 1953
Texas A &amp; M College has conducted lab-
oratory investigations of the feasibility
of making fresh water by solvent extrac-
tion. In this process, saline water is con-
tacted countercurrently with an organic
solvent (the secondary and tertiary
amines have given the best results) to
produce a more concentrated raffinate
and an extract containing nearly salt-free
water, which separates upon heating.
The testing program has shown that sol-
vent extraction is most applicable to
brackish waters.
A process which is now widely used
for water purification but apparently not
applicable for reasons of economics to
feed with as high an impurity content as
saline waters is ion exchange. In this pro-
cess, the impure water is passed through
exchange resins where its various salt
ions are replaced by unobjectionable ions
from the resin. But for treatment of sea
water the cost of the chemicals for re-
generating the resins makes the process
prohibitively expensive at present.
Among the other processes being stud-
ied which are at least theoretically feas-
ible are gravitational diffusion, chemical
precipitation, electrolysis, ultrasonics, and
the use of ultra-high frequency currents.
Still other means have been suggested of
obtaining fresh water from the sea. One
of the more imaginative proposals is to
tow icebergs from the Arctic regions and
let them melt in large dry docks at har-
bors in the temperate zone.
This country's water problem was sum-
marized by Dr. A. L. Miller, Director of
the Office of Saline Water in a recent
speech. "It is hard to realize," he said,
"as we stand on the threshold of space,
that within a few years our number one
domestic problem may be the provision of
adequate supplies of plain ordinary water.
The predicted increase in water use in
the coming decades makes it unmistak-
ably clear that we will need more water
than can be provided from readily avail-
able natural sources of supply. We must
turn to scientific and technological re-
search to develop a new source of supply
that can provide an ever-growing percent-
age of tomorrow's water."

Engineering Mechanics is in its fiftieth year at Michigan. The Department was created to
teach the engineering aspects of classical mehanics to all engineering students. Its versatile
graduates, particularly those with higher degrees, move readily into areas where the de-
mand is greatest. This results in activities as modern and glamorous, as demanding and
rewarding, as those enjoyed by an engineer.
Men broadly trained in Engineering Mechanics are prepared to work on fundamental
problems in many branches of engineering. The staff and the graduates of the Department
have been actively and responsibly engaged in the past on such things as the design of a
200-inch telescope, the analysis of airship structures. More recently, they have engaged in
research in rarefied-gas hydrodynamics, vibration studies of helicopters, submarines, naval
vessels, and ocean liners, and analysis of missile airframes. They have been actively as-
sociated with the development of sea-going nuclear power plants, reactor hydraulics, and
nuclear rocket propulsion. They have made many contributions in the area of fluid mechan-
ics and its application to manufacturing processes.

A young accountant had been keeping
steady company with a girl for five years.
Doggedly he refused to pop the ques-
tion. Naturally the girl was getting im-
patient.
One night the accountant took his girl
out to a Chinese restaurant. She studied
the menu and began telling her boy
friend what she would care to eat.
"How would you like your rice," the
boy friend asked, "fried or boiled?"
The girl looked at the accountant, took
a deep breath, then said very slowly and
distinctly: "Thrown."
A group of scientists were discussing
politics in the space age. Suddenly, a dog
that belonged to the owner of the house
interrupted. "Gentlemen," the pooch
said, "this is the most erudite and so-
phisticated discussion I have listened to
in some time, but the discussion is com-
pletely theoretical and wholly devoid of
any practical aspects."
One of the guests, a middle-aged lady,
bent down and ran her hand over the
dog's back. "Why, bless you!" she ex-
claimed. "You know how to talk."
"Certainly, I know how to talk," the
dog replied. "Why shouldn't I? After
all, I went to Cornell."
"All right," said the dog's owner,
looking the dog right in the eye. "Let's
go easy on the bragging. Don't forget—
you never graduated."
The little girl's father was a union or-
ganizer. "Daddy," she said to him one
evening, "I can't sleep. Will you tell me
a story?"
Daddy nodded, "Once upon a time-
and-a-half . . ." he began.
Two beautiful actresses, well-turned
and well-stacked, were admiring a dia-
mond necklace in a swank jewelry store.
"It's out of this world," said one, "But
who would be jerk enough to pay $40,-
000 for it?"
"I don't know," the other actress an-
swered. "But don't worrv, I'll find him."

instruments are attached to the subject;
then, the machine is turned on and ad-
justed. The examiner then asks a few
neutral questions about a know fact such
as "Are you wearing glasses now?" or.
"Are you in Detroit now?" These ques-
tions (assuming the subject is cooperat-
ing and answers them truthfully) serve
to establish the normal response pattern
for that individual. Then, if the subject
lies during subsequent questioning, there
will be a change in the response pattern.

too young to know the difference between

emotional importance, I can easily believe
Sergeant Barkman's statement that poly-
graphs, when used under ideal condi-
tions, are 95% accurate.
Uses in Police Work
Because of its slight inaccuracy and
lack of standardized test procedures, poly-
graph results are not admissible in court;
consequently, the machine is used mainly
as an "investigative aid." If a test indi-

right and wrong, and people of low
I.Q.'s experience little or no emotional
change when telling a lie. Consequently,
a polygraph test would be useless in
their cases.
While doing research for this paper,
the author had an opportunity (through
the courtesy of Sergeant Barkman of The
Michigan State Police) to take a poly-
graph test. I was given a deck of cards
and told to pick one and insert it back into
the deck without divulging the number.
Sergeant Barkman then asked, "Did you
pick number 7? Did you pick number
9?—" This continued until all cards had
been mentioned. I answered, "No" to
each question, as instructed. The poly-
graph record pictured shows a change in
cates that a person is innocent, most law
enforcement agencies will release him.
This, of course, saves the trouble, ex-
pense, and embarrassment of further in-
vestigation. On the other hand, a poly-
graph indication of guilt merely serves
to encourage the law officers in their
search for legally admissible evidence.
The polygraphs most important con-
tribution to the cause of justice is not
the conviction of the guilty; it is the
freeing of the innocent.

Photography
at Work
with you,
from the time a scientist's mind first
sparks an idea for exploring space,
photography gets to work with him. It
saves countless hours in the drafting
stage by reproducing engineers' plans
and drawings. It probes the content
and structure of metals needed by
photomicrography, photospectrography
or x-ray diffraction. It checks the opera-
tion of swift-moving parts with high-
speed movies—records the flight of the
device itself—and finally, pictures what
it is in space the scientist went after in
the first place.
There's hardly a field on which you
can set your sights where photography
does not play a part in producing a
better product or in simplifying work
and routine. It saves time and costs in
research, in production, in sales and
in office routine.
So in whatever you plan to do,
take full advantage of all of the ways
photography can help.

Interview with General Electric's
W. Scott Hill
Manager—Engineering Recruiting
Qualities I Look For
When Recruiting Engineers
Q. Mr. Hill, what can I do to gel the
most out of my job interviews?
A. You know, we have the same
question. I would recommend that
you have some information on what
the company does and why you be-
lieve you have a contribution to
make. Looking over company in-
formation in your placement office
is helpful. Have in mind some of the
things you would like to ask and try
to anticipate questions that may
refer to your specific interests.
Q. What information do you try to get
during your interviews?
A. This is where we must fill in be-
tween the lines of the personnel
forms. I try to find out why partic-
ular study programs have been fol-
lowed, in order to learn basic motiva-
tions. I also try to find particular
abilities in fields of science, or math-
ematics, or alternatively in the more
practical courses, since these might
not be apparent from personnel rec-
ords. Throughout the interview we
try to judge clarity of thinking since
this also gives us some indication of
ability and ultimate progress. One
good way to judge a person, I find,
is to ask myself: Would he be easy
to work with and would I like to
have him as my close associate?
Q. What part do first impressions play
in your evaluation of people?
A. I think we all form a first im-
pression when we meet anyone.
Therefore, if a generally neat ap-
pearance is presented, I think it
helps. It would indicate that you
considered this important to your-
self and had some pride in the way
the interviewer might size you up.
Q. With only academic training as a
background, how long will it be before
I'll be handling responsible work?
A. Not long at all. If a man joins a
training program, or is placed direct-
ly on an operating job, he gets
assignments which let him work up
to more responsible jobs. We are
hiring people with definite consider-
ation for their potential in either
technical work or the management
field, but their initial jobs will be
important and responsible.
Q. How will the fact that I've had to
work hard in my engineering studies,
with no time for a lot of outside activi-
ties, affect my employment possibilities?
A. You're concerned, I'd guess, with
all the talk of the quest for "well-
rounded men." We do look for this
characteristic, but being president
of the student council isn't the only
indication of this trait. Through
talking with your professors, for
example, we can determine who
takes the active role in group proj-
ects and gets along well with other
students in the class. This can be
equally important in our judgment.
Q. How important are high scholastic
grades in your decision to hire a man?
A. At G.E. we must have men who
are technically competent. Your
grades give us a pretty good indica-
tion of this and are also a measure
of the way you have applied your-
self. When we find someone whose
grades are lower than might be ex-
pected from his other characteristics,
we look into it to find out if there
are circumstances which may have
contributed.
Q. What consideration do you give work
experience gained prior to graduation?
A. Often a man with summer work
experience in his chosen academic
field has a much better idea of what
he wants to do. This helps us decide
where he would be most likely to
succeed or where he should start his
career. Many students have had to
work hard during college or sum-
mers, to support themselves. These
men obviously have a motivating
desire to become engineers that we
find highly desirable.
Q. Do you feel that a man must know
exactly what he wants to do when he is
being interviewed?
A. No, I don't. It is helpful if he
has thought enough about his in-
terests to be able to discuss some
general directions he is considering.
For example, he might know whether
he wants product engineering work,
or the marketing of technical prod-
ucts, or the engineering associated
with manufacturing. On G-E train-
ing programs, rotating assignments
are designed to help men find out
more about their true interests be-
fore they make their final choice.
Q. How do military commitments affect
your recruiting?
A. Many young men today have
military commitments when they
graduate. We feel it is to their ad-
vantage and ours to accept employ-
ment after graduation and then ful-
fill their obligations. We have a
limited number of copies of a De-
partment of Defense booklet de-
scribing, in detail, the many ways in
which the latter can be done. Just

A phenomenon of modern America is the so-called
"think company." It owns no factories, manufactures
no products and makes no shipments, but just "thinks"
about problems--and brilliant ways to solve them.
He have a number of "think companies" within Westinghouse
One is a group of scientists in the research labs near
Pittsburgh who seek basic knowledge, like the production
of light by solids, and the origin of magnetism.
Other Westinghouse scientists in Baltimore apply basic knowledge
to that most demanding of all problems...national defense. At
Cheswick, Pa., another group thinks about products needed in the
American home 10 or 15 years from now.
As a result of this kind of thinking Westinghouse scientists and
engineers have achieved startling advances in atomic power, the
launching system for Polaris, thermoelectric generators
and many other developments.
The back-up facilities in the Westinghouse "think companies"
help make Westinghouse the best place for talented engineers.

As the editor of a technical magazine, I have many occasions
to come into contact with other such magazines, especially those
published for professional engineers and scientists of this kind or
that. Some of these magazines are regularly sent to the Tecbnic
office; others we encounter in the libaries in the course of research
on subjects for articles.
More and more I am coming to the realization that these pro-
fessional publications are of the utmost value and importance both
to the student and to the professional. I would like to take this
editorial opportunity to expound some of the values that I find in
these publications.
Perhaps the greatest value to be reaped from a regular study
of the trade magazines within one's own specialty is the chance it
gives to keep abreast of the latest developments in that field. New
discoveries and theories are generally reported in trade journals
considerably before they become generally accepted and widely
used. New discoveries and new techniques are customarily made
known by their discoverers, inventors, or proponents in exactly this
manner. In this respect one can learn about them years before cur-
rent textbooks or general practice catches up. Early knowledge of
such new innovations is especially important to the practitioner in
a field, because of the pressures of competition, both for the sales
dollar and for promotion within one's company. Often the best
way to secure a competitive advantage with a certain product is to
be the first in the field with a new twist. Also, the best way to
call the attention of one's superiors to oneself, outside of actually
making the innovation, is to propose adoption of the innovation.
While a student is still in school, he is not quite so concerned
with these very recent developments, because he is required to
learn certain fundamental material that is found in, and best treated
by, standard texts. But once he enters his chosen profession, it is
hoped that he has mastered the fundamentals and is familiar with
present methods and procedures. Then, education and development
of the individual must take on the form of continual awareness of
the things that are just coming in.
The education of the scientist continues through the reading
of technical publications in yet another way. By reading the journ-
als of cognate fields, that is, related fields of study which support
and reinforce the ability to cope with the basic field, the young man
increases the effectiveness of his work and his own pleasure in per-
forming it.
Not only the editorial matter, such as articles and news items,
is of educational benefit in these magazines. The advertising con-
tained in technical magazines contains a wealth of practical infor-
mation that is available to the young scientist nowhere else. In
order to effectively carry out any sort of scientific or technical work,
one must have information about products and services that can be
purchased, as well as theory. In designing a steel mill or a chemical
plant, the engineer must know something about chemistry or
metallurgy, true. But he must also know whether the design that
he makes can be economically assembled. He must know whether
the particular presses, piping, chemicals, and other capital
goods can be purchased in the sizes, quantities, and at the prices
that are demanded by the design. He should also know whether the
types of equipment that were used in last year's project have been
improved upon or supplanted by better types.
Finally, the advertisers in technical magazines are always very
eager to make additional information about their products known.
By effective utilization of the advertising literature made available
by these companies, the engineer can often find that much of the
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


he might have to do himself, has indeed been done for him by
those eager to furnish supplies.
Most technical magazines have so-called "reader-service cards"
upon which one can circle numbers corresponding to the advertisers
in a certain issue. When returned to the magazine, its publishers
will inform those advertisers whose numbers have been circled that
the person who submitted the card wants further information about
the advertised product. Usually the company then furnishes com-
plete engineering data, catalogs, the name of the nearest distributor,
etc. Such information is obviously invaluable to the busy engineer.
I feel that if I were to take a month's time after graduation,
and read every article in the trade journal of my own specialty (i.e.)
that I would learn just as much as I have in four years of college.
This does not mean that my college has been a waste of time, for
I surely would not even understand these magazines without a good
formal educational background in the field. This example merely
serves to illustrate the great store of valuable, practical, and current
information in these magazines.
There are a number of other reasons why these magazines are
of value. Many offer placement and recruitment services limited
to the particular specialty, which are very valuable to those seeking
a job in a limited field. Another value is the possibility for exchange
of ideas of concern to the field but which are not in themselves
technical, for instance, what is the opinion of men in my field on
unions vs. professionalism? How will the latest changes in Wash-
ington affect the quantity and nature of the work in my field? How
should a man of my background, experience, and ability be earn-
ing? Why am I or am I not attaining these standards of financial
and personal satisfaction? What is wrong with me or my company
that we don't get the jobs, contracts, profits, promotions, etc., that
others do? Awareness on such issues is a major benefit to be derived
from reading technical magazines—such as this one.

Presently the Tecbnic is in need of a few interested men (or,
more especially, women) to try out for staff positions in certain
areas of magazine production in which our present staffs are a bit
thin. Although there are openings in most fields, we are especially
eager to obtain a few more writers.
In order to write articles for the Tecbnic, it is not required to
become a full-fledged staff member. We stand willing and eager to
consider articles submitted to us as one-shot propositions, or to put
men on our reserve list of writers to be contacted for material on
special subjects. It is our policy that writers may refuse any assign-
ment that does not interest them, and usually articles are either
requested by those who write them, or the ideas may arise with the
authors themselves. So, if you are interested in technical article
writing, do drop by our office at 3077 East Engineering.
We have been requested by our national advertising representa-
tive, Littell-Murray-Barnhill, Inc., to run an informal poll among
15 third-year subscribers, to determine the effectiveness of the
advertising being run in this magazine. This reminds us that the
over 50% of this magazine which consists of advertising is impor-
tant to all, as well as the written matter. It is important to us
because it is our bread-and-butter. It is important to the advertisers,
because the new men it is intended to recruit will be the Iifeblood of
those companies. Most of all, it is important to the reader, because
those many personnel recruitment messages carry within them the
spirit and character of the companies that we must someday choose
between as employers. The student will possibly save himself much
grief later on, if he will acquaint himself with the "corporate image"
of these diverse employers right now.

Perhaps the best one is the sum
total of them all:
At DuPont, there are no dead-
end streets for able, ambitious
people.
For example, DuPont is grow-
ing constantly, and growth means
more jobs. Every year we spend
$90 million in research alone, to
develop new products that create
challenging new opportunities.
In addition, DuPont invests an
average of $33,000 in each em-
ployee to provide the most modern
equipment, the finest facilities, the
best supporting services—factors
of special significance to the tech-
nical man.

UNUSUAL METALS
Many of the rare and unusual metals play var-
ied and important roles in modern metallurgy.
by BRYAN WHIPPLE
Editor-in-Chief
Scandium—an unusual metal,
sometimes classed as a rare earth
metal.

Of the ninety-plus elements that occur
in nature and make up the whole
of the known universe, more than sixty
possess properties that classify them as
metals. However, engineers rarely hear
any reference to, or make much use of,
more than a handful of the known
metals. Iron, aluminum, copper, and now
magnesium are the staple metals of the
engineering repertoire, along with the
metals used in ferroalloys, such as nickel
and chromium. Even allowing for the
newer metals of engineering importance
such as titanium, and such long-known
metals as lead, tin, silver, and gold,
only a decided minority of all known
metals are frequently studied in engi-
neering courses.
What, then, of the many other metals
which are not so prominent? Have they
any uses today? What are their properties?
How are they recovered from their ores?
These scarce metals with which this
article is concerned are not only the so-
called rare earth metals, although these
are included in the group we are dis-
cussing. We are also concerned with the
dense metals such as osmium, and with
the metals which are often used in
making special steels, but are rarely used
by themselves, such as vanadium.
First, it is not merely scientific curiosity
that is bending the interest of engineers
in the direction of the scarce metals. It is
the need for very special properties and
characteristics in materials that points
interest toward the exotoic metals. The
increasingly severe demands that space-
age technology is making upon more
common materials makes it ever more
imperative to seek out and utilize prop-
erties known or presumed to exist in
these metals.
New Extraction Methods
The first hurdle that the materials en-
gineers had to surmount before a new
material could even be tested in an ap-
plication where it was suspected to be
useful was to obtain a sufficient quantity
for testing. For many of the metals in
the "scarce" category, this was extremely
difficult and time-consuming. The ores
of these metals are usually found mixed
together in the same deposit, so that a
mere reduction or electrolysis procss
left a mixture of several metals instead
of a nearly-pure metal as with, say, iron.
Further separation was made difficult by
the chemically similar properties of many
of the metals. The problem was rather
more like separating isotopes of a single
element than like the usual ore-purifica-
tion process.
One of the time-honored methods for
separation of rare-earth metals was by
selective precipitation of certain com-
pounds from solution. If the precipita-
tion process was repeated time after time,
the metal which precipitated in com-
pound form slightly more readily than
the other would eventually be separated
in reasonably pure form.
An interesting story is told about a
professor at a certain Big Ten univer-
sity who made a life's project out of the
preparation of a sample of one of the
scarce metals in pure form by the precipi-
tation method. Every morning for twenty
years, it was the duty of this man's gradu-
ate students to come in and decant the
contents of a large row of beakers from

happy professor had a lump of "metal
X" the size of a large walnut.
The excited and pleased professor took
his lump of metal X to a convention at
a rival university. To his great dismay,
he found that a research team there had
as "rare earths." In fact, so effective is
the new method, that stocks of these
metals have grown all out of proportion
to present demand, and the producers of
these metals are sitting around with huge
lumps of the stuff in their warehouses,
waiting for uses to be developed.

is no contact between a metal and a refractory, which eliminates a major source
of impurities.
prepared a lump of the same metal, the
size of a cocoanut, in less than a fort-
night!
How had this been done? By a very
newly-developed process using banks of
ion-exchangers (for the explanation of
ion exchange, refer to "Ion Exchange,"
The Michigan Tecbnic; April, I960).
This was the big breakthrough in pro-
duction of a number of the scarce metals,
especially those which have been known
Properties
One subgroup of the scarce metals has
been arbitrarily made1 by considering
those metals whose annual production
falls between the limits of 100 pounds
minimum and 100 tons maximum. There-
are about fifteen metals in this group.
Germanium is perhaps one of the more
familiar of these metals because of its
now widespread use as a semiconductor
in electronics. First it was used to make
the tiny rectifying diodes that have al-
most displaced crystals of galena (PbS)
as the "crystal" in crystal sets. Germa-
nium is also the most important material
in the manufacture of transistors. The
quantity used is small, but the purity
must be very high, and its importance is
unquestioned. Tellurium is also a semi-
conductor, although not so important as
germanium. Both of these metals exhib-
it nonmetallic properties in some degree,
such as high electrical resistance.
Cesium metal, whose melting point is
so low that it liquifies in an overheated
room, is valuable in photocells and in
solar power research because it emits
electrons when struck by certain types of
radiation. Thorium also exhibits this
property; it is also radioactive. Cesium
is further used in vacuum tubes to re-
move residual oxygen after evacuation
by pumping, because it combines readily
with oxygen. The silvery or black spots
sometimes seen on the glass envelopes of
tubes, which mislead many to think that
the tubes are "burned out" are only resi-
due from the spark-ignition of the ce-
sium electrode placed in the tube and
"fired" as a part of manufacture.
Indium is another little-known metal,
although there is a company of rather
good size that produces little else—the
Indium Corporation of America. This
metal has a very low melting point; this
feature makes it useful in automatic
sprinkler nozzles, and in making special
solders, such as a 50 50 tin-indium
solder which will wet glass.
Some of the scarce metals are very
dense, and exhibit good wearing prop-
erties, which makes them acceptable ma-
terials for phonograph needles. Osmium
is frequently employed in this use, and
while inferior to both sapphire and dia-
mond, is the best metal needle.
A number of the scarce metals are
also considered precious metals, and as
such are in demand for jewelry and or-
namentation. These include platinum,
osmium, and palladium. This group is
often used as a coating for electrical con-
tacts subject to frequent make-and-break
operation or to sparking, because they do
not pit or corrode in service.
Rhenium is a tough, corrosion-resis-
tant metal which has been found serv-
iceable in high-temperature applications
where other metals .tend to volatilize and
deposit themselves where they are not
wanted. It is also used for pen points.
Cost
The average price of the above metals,
although they very widely, is about $1000

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


these metals are used only when abso-
lutely necessary. However, the prices of
most of them are falling steadily as pro-
duction capacity increases. The ores from
which these metals are extracted are
found in many areas of the world. Can-
ade, South America, Africa, and the
USSR are important producing areas for
many, while a few of the ores (e.g.
cesium, gallium, hafnium, etc.) are found
in the U.S. The U.S. and Canada pro-
duce about 45%, Africa 30%, and Rus-
sia 15% of the world's supply of the
platinum-class metals. Users of rare earth
metals who want some of their proper-
ties but who do not require any particu-
lar metal in pure form may obtain the
so-called "misch metal," a widely-mar-
keted alloy containing several metals in
varying amounts, never separated from
one another.
The future for this subclass of scarce
metals is somewhat unclear. These met-
als are caught in an economic vise; high
costs prevent widespread use, and also
limited use prevents further research into
better and cheaper production methods.
Great strides have been made recently
with the new ion-exchange equipment,
however. When usage once again over-
takes production, we will be able to see
which of these metals have broken the
vicious circle. However, it should again
be pointed out that the relative abun-
dance and relative usefulness of these
metals varies, and each should be treated
individually in assessing economic status.
Beyond the 100-pound to 100-ton
group, there are the truly exotic metals
whose annual production is below 100
pounds per year. These are the metals
with names such as praseodymium, gado-
linium, and dysprosium, remembered by
most engineers only as names or symbols
filling in the gaps in the periodic table.
One of these metals, technetium, is so
rare that its existence in nature has not
been establishd.
More Research Needed
Lack of definite knowledge about the
properties of specific metals in this class
has been a significant barrier to their uss
as separate metals. The misch metal, com-
posed of numerous rare earths together,
showed rather disappointing properties,
so little work was done to separate th:
metals and test them individually. Now
that ion-exchange has replaced fractional
crystallization and precipitation as the
best method for preparation of the pure
metals, a great deal of research has been

commenced.
While the results of this new flurry of
research are just beginning to trickle in,
some surprising facts have come to light.
A number of the rare earths have turned
out to be stronger than expected. Some
have strengths on the same order as the
more common nonferrous metals. Also,
the resistance to atmospheric corrosion
of many of the metals has been bstter
than expected. They are generally poor
electrical conductors and are strongly
paramagnetic.
Some of the uses, familiar and new,
for the rare earths: in cigarette-lighter
flints, with iron, for better sparking qual-
ities; as deoxidizers and purifiers in fer-
rous alloys; as structural materials in
critical applications, such as rockets, be-
cause of high-temperature passivity; as
superconductors, or in applications where
paramagnetic properties are desirable;
and in nuclear devices, because of their
wide range of thermal neutron cross-
sections.
Even the more common metals which
are customarily used only in alloys are
finding increased use for their own prop-
erties. Zirconium is being tested as a
tubing material in reactors. Vanadium
and tungsten are being fabricated in pure
or slightly-alloyed condition for special
uses, especially in high-temperature or
refractory circumstances.
The use of exotic elemental metals
can be expected to be a major trend in
the future evolution of engineering ma-
terials. A great deal has been done by
metallurgists by recombining the more
familiar metals into new alloys, and the
point has now been reached where new
developments will depend heavily on the
us of heretofore neglected elements. This
is especially true now that many other
considerations besides high strength and
low cost are to be met. The scarce metals
present one of the most promising ave-
nues of solution to the demand for ma-
terials to withstand high temperatures,
corrosive surroundings, and special elec-
trical and magnetic conditions.

CONTROLLED FUSION
The prospects of nearly unlimited fuel supplies
and tremendous quantities of energy, are spur-
ring scientists on in search of a means to control
fusion reactions.
by IRVING SALMEEN
Controlled nuclear fission reactions
are rapidly becoming a common
source of power. Everyone is familiar
with the astounding quantities of energy
that can be squeezed from seemingly
minute proportions of appropriate fuel,
but everyone is not aware of the fact,
that in spite of the apparent efficiency
and enormous energy capacities of
fission reactors, man is approaching a
time in the not too distant future, when
he will face severe problems concerning
sources of energy.
As the supply of fossil fuels dimin-
ishes, greater dependency will have to
be placed upon nuclear energy to meet
the expanding power requirements of
modern society. At the present time the
only feasible method of extracting use-
ful energy from the nucleus of an atom
is by the fission process. But the process
poses two difficult problems. One, when
the uranium deposits begin to run out,
what becomes of the source of fissionable
fuel? Second, the fission reaction leaves
radioactive waste that is nearly impossible
to safely dispose of without contamin-
ating large land or underwater areas.
To illustrate the disposal problem, con-
sider the fact that if the present power
needs of the U.S. were all supplied by fis-
sion reactors, it would be necessory to dis-
pose each year of an amount of radioactive
fission products equal to that from the
explosion of 200,000 atomic bombs, and
by the year 2000, as power requirements
increase, radio-active waste would come
to the equivalent of eight million atomic
bomb explosions per year!
Fusion Principles
Fortunately, fission is not the only
means of releasing the power of the
atom; there is the process of fusion. To
illustrate the difference between fission
and fusion, let us first consider in more
detail the fission reaction. The key ingre-
dients of the process are the nuclei of
certain very heavy elements at the upper
end of the periodic table, such as urani-
um-235 or plutonium. A neutron, because
it has no charge, can easily penetrate
such a nucleus. The presence of a
neutron can cause the nucleus of the
heavy element to split into two roughly
equal parts with the consequent release
of energy. In the process, several addi-
tional neutrons are released, which in
turn cause other nuclei to undergo fission.
If losses of neutrons are minimized, a
sustained chain reaction is possible.
Usable energy is extracted by utilizing
conventional heat exchange methods that
make use of the heat emitted in the pro-
cess to generate electric power.
In the fusion process the basic prin-
ciples are nearly opposite to those of
fission. Here the key ingredients are the
nuclei of certain very light elements that
unite, or fuse, into heavier nuclei with
the subsequent release of energy. The
products of the reaction have less mass
than that of the reactants and this differ-
ence in mass is released in energy accord-
ing to the equation E = mc2. A common
fusion reaction utilizes naturally occurring
deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen with
a mass of 2 amu instead of 1). The
reaction is:
H2 + H2 -&gt; He3 + n + 3-3 MeV
(Million electron volts)
or
H2 + H- -» He1 + H1 + 4.0 Mev
where the probability of each reaction
occurring is roughly equal. From this it is
then possible for the trition (H3) to
react with another deuteron:
H» + H2 -» He4 + n + 17.6 MeV
Problems
All looks well for fusion—on paper,
but serious problems arise. It must be
noted that the nuclei involved in the
fusion reactions are positively charged.
As a result, strong electrostatic repulsion
forces exist between particles. However,
before a fusion reaction can occur, the
particles must be brought into contact,
a feat that requires tremendous amounts
of energy.
Suppose we have an imaginary con-
tainer of deuterium and want to gen-
erate a fusion reaction. To give the par-
ticles sufficient kinetic energy to over-
come the electrostatic repulsion, we heat
the deuterium. At a temperature of
5,000°C we observe our container and
note that the particles are in a wild ran-
dom motion, no fusion reactions occur,
but the molecules of deuterium have
broken apart and the container now holds
just deuterium atoms. At this tempera-
ture a liter of original deuterium at atmos-
pheric temperature would exert a press-
ure of 40 atmospheres and each particle
would have a velocity of, on the average,
40,000 miles per hour.
We continue the heating until a tem-
perature of 100,000 degrees is reached.
Again we observe the state of the deuter-
ium. (Because our container is imagin-
ary, it can stand the high temperatures
and pressures.) Still no fusion reactions
occur, but now the atoms of deuterium
have broken into a neutral conglomera-
tion of positive ions and electrons. At this
temperature, the electrons surrounding
the nucleus of the atoms have acquired
sufficient energy to break away and now
violently move about the container at an
average velocity of 10 million miles per
hour, while the heavier nuclei lag along

NEGATIVE IONS

These invisible particles have a great influence
on our health.

Into a doctor's office in Philadelphia
stepped a wheezing, gasping victim

tor, the patient began to feel surprisingly
better. To his added delight, the condi-
tion was disappearing even though he
had been given no medication. A few
minutes before the patient arrived, the

tion of negative ions into the air. Simply

ions had changed the sufferer's symptoms.
There's nothing new or mysterious
about the ion. Over a period of years
there have been reports to the effect that
positive and negative ions produce oppo-
site physiological effects. Negative ions
have been claimed to produce beneficial
effects while positive ions generally have
been considered harmful. The use of con-
centrated negative ions to treat "hayfever"
and asthma is only part of a sweeping
program of medical developments that
promise relief for victims of a wide range
of chronic ailments.
The Ions We Breathe
Ions, both negative and positive, occur
naturally in the outdoor atmosphere.
These ions range in size from a molecule
with a single charge to a large particle
with multiple charges. The size of these
ions is expressed in terms of their velocity
in an electrostatic field of known force.
The removal of an electron from a par-
ticle will yield a positive ion while the
addition of an electron will form a nega-
tive ion.

their charge and mobility vary consider-
ably. Clean mountain air has about 2,000
small ions/ cm3, while polluted air may
have thousands of low mobility ions with
only a few small ions/ cm3. These ions
in the atmosphere are generated in a num-
ber of ways including cosmic rays, radio-
active elements in the earth, precipita-
tion, winds, and ultraviolet radiation.
Negative Ions in Medical Research
Medical men have long suspected that
ions affected the human system, but only
until recently have they solved the riddle
of ion research. As far back as 1924
when Picard was using an ultraviolet
lamp inside an aluminum sphere, the
effects of ions on respiratory ailments
were noticed. For the past thirty years,
Dessauer has been using about one mil-
lion negative ions/ml for the treatment
of climatic-sensitive individuals. Recently
Dr. I. Kornblueh at the University of
Pennsylvania reported relief of "hay-
fever" in many individuals treated with a
concentration of negative ions. Negative
ions have also been proven beneficial in
the treatment of burns and the ever pres-
ent common cold. They have had a great
influence in the reduction of malignant
tissue in cases of implanted cancer cells
in mice.
The most significant discovery in ion
research concerns the filter for dust and
smoke in the human body. Located in
the windpipe, there exists thousands of
tiny hair-like filaments, called cilia,
which wave back and forth to capture
irritating particles from the air we
breathe. Under ordinary conditions, these
dust traps wave their "arms" about 850
times per minute. In experiments con-
ducted by Dr. Albert Kruger at the

Figure 2.—Increase of ion concentration as a function of the negative voltage
applied to the metals surface.
University of California, when cilia were
exposed to negative ions, their vibrations
speeded up at the rate of two hundred
beats per minute. An opposite effect was
observed when cilia were exposed to pos-
itive ions. A correlation between the
vibration rate of the cilia and the relief
of respiratory ailments has now been
drawn.
Artificial Generation of Ions
Indoors, ions can be generated in
any number of ways, including x-rays,
radio active materials, and certain ultra-
violet lamps. The most exhaustive in-

vestigations with ions concern magnesium
oxide which, when heated to a high tem-
perature, produces both positive and
negative ions. The positive ions are then
removed by an electro-static field. Radio-
active materials also release both posi-
tive and negative ions where the posi-
tive ions are removed in a similar man-
ner.
Ultraviolet generators can be made to
produce only negative ions, but the lamp
itself cannot produce a substantial num-
ber. Even the shortest wave length pro-
duced by ultraviolet lamps, 1849 Ang-
stroms, does not have sufficient energy to
ionize oxygen or nitrogen. However,
ultraviolet lamps can produce ions in an
indirect manner; the radiation can cause
liberation of electrons from a nearby
metal or certain other materials, and
these electrons can attach themselves to
oxygen or dust particles forming negative
ions (see Fig. 1)! The number of elec-
trons released by this process depends
on the intensity and wavelength of radia-
tion, as well as the material used to
emit the electrons.
The methods by which this radiation
can be controlled involve the parameters
of mercury vapor lamp (gas mixture and
pressure, current density, etc.). By vary-
ing these parameters, the amount of

radiation at different wavelengths can
be controlled. The choice of the photo-
electric surface is also critical. Unfor-
tunately, the metals with the lowest work
functions, such as sodium, barium, and
potassium, are unstable in air and cannot
be used. Metals, such as aluminum, oxi-
dizes readly in air. Fortunately, the high
work functions of some of the more
stable metals can be decreased by thj
proper combinations of other metals.
For example, a layer of silver plate on
copper aids in the ejection of electrons,
because this layer of electropositive ions
acts much like the grid of a thermionic
tube. A negative voltage on the metal
surface increases the concentration of
ions, primarily because electrons ejected
from the surface are repelled and are
thus prevented from recombining with
the metal (this is shown in Fig. 2).
Other factors which effect the efficiency
of ion production involve air flow. If this
flow in the generator (see fig. 3) is
turbulent, many ions are lost to the in-
side surfaces of the generator; thus a
rapid, smooth flow is essential.
Measurement of Air Ion Concentration
Air ions are negatively or positively
charged molecules or dust particles. Th;.-
number of unit charges of electricity in
the air can be determined by measuring
the current or charge on a collector. A
single dust particle with many unit
charges would, under these conditions,
be recorded as many single air ions.
Differentiation between large, medium,
and small air ions are made on the basis
of their mobility. Large singly charged
dirt particles when placed in an electric
field would move at approximately
0.0003 cm/sec/volt/cm; intermediate
size ions would move at approximately
o.l cm/sec/volt/cm; while small ions
on the average will move at 1.5 cm/sec,'
volt/cm. Here mobility is expressed as:
One way of determining the number of
ions per unit volume of air is to draw
the air with a suction fan between the
collecting plates and measure the current
with a microammeter. The number of
ions, N, can be expressed as
I
N=
qA
Where: I = ion current in amperes
q= 1.6 X lO"19 coulombs
A = Vol. of air/sec.
The Future
While much research needs to be done
in this area, particularily toward deter-
mining the precise mechanism by which
ions react with the human body, the
over 60 years of experimentation in this
field have produced some ideas on the
effect of charged ions. Our indoor air
is now controlled in temperature and
humidity, dust is removed by electrostatic
precipitation, and bacteria are killed by
ultraviolet radiation. The next step will
be the control of the ion count.

Even before Ron Spetrino received his engi-
neering degree from Case he had good job offers
from six companies.
He joined The Ohio Bell Telephone Company
—his reason: "I was convinced an engineer could
go further here—if he was willing to work for it."
As soon as Ron got his feet on the ground
in telephone engineering, he was tapped for a
tough assignment. The job—to engineer switch-
ing equipment modifications needed to prepare
Cleveland for nationwide customer dialing of long
distance calls.
Ron wrapped it up in five months, and found
he had earned a shot at another tough assignment.
In this job Ron helped engineer a completely new
long distance switching center for Cleveland. This
switching center connected Cleveland with the
nationwide customer dialing network. It was
about a year later that Ron put the finishing
touches on the specs for this $1,600,000 project.
Today, as a Supervising Engineer, Ron heads
a staff of five engineers and is responsible for
telephone switching in much of the greater
Cleveland area.
He supervises the design and purchase of $3
million worth of equipment a year. And even
more important, he is charged with developing
the technical and managerial skills of his staff.
Ron knows what he's talking about when he
says, "In this business you have to do more than
a good job. We expect a man to be a self-developer.
We expect him to take responsibility from his

Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a
favorable engineering atmosphere.
Back in 1925, when Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft was
designing and developing the first of its family of
history-making powerplants, an attitude was born—a
recognition that engineering excellence was the key
to success.
That attitude, that recognition of the prime impor-
tance of technical superiority is still predominant at
P&amp;WA today.
The field, of course, is broader now, the challenge
greater. No longer are the company's requirements
confined to graduates with degrees in mechanical
and aeronautical engineering. Pratt &amp; Whitney Air-
craft today is concerned with the development of
all forms of flight propulsion systems for the aero-
space medium—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and
other advanced types. Some are entirely new in
concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with
degrees in mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chem-
ical and nuclear engineering are needed, along
with those holding degrees in physics, chemistry
and metallurgy.
Specifically, what would you do?—your own engi-
neering talent provides the best answer. And Pratt

that talent can flourish.

OF THE
Seemingly insignificant geological specimens
can yield many facts about the condition of the
earth eons ago.
by CHARLES MASSER
Have you ever wondered how the
Earth appeared in the year
100,000,000 B.C.? To many of us, the
reconstruction of the Earth's history is
just as interesting as the construction of
the Earth's future. How do we recon-
struct a past picture of the Earth? One
approach to the problem came from the
idea of finding which areas of the Earth
in its past history were under water or
vice versa. However, this does not pro-
vide sufficient knowledge to enable one
to construct a map valid for the year
100,000,000 B.C. All of the facts that
are known about existing rocks and the
fossils they contain must be used to
unravel the past. The men who step
into this work are called paleogeograph-
ers or historical geologists.
Fossil Bearing Rocks Form Theory
Fossils tell us many things that are
necessary in constructing a historical pic-
ture of the Earth. They can tell us what
land-bridges and water-channels existed,
what type of climate prevailed in a cer-
tain region, or they may tell of how the
ocean currents flowed. However, to show
when the opening or closing of these
land-bridges occurred, the fossils of
larger land animals must be used. This
is true because flying animals and in-
sects can be blown across a broken land-
bridge, small land animals could ride
across on driftwwood, and seeds could
cross the waterway by wind or be carried
across by birds. However, the large land
animals would be restricted to the main-
land around them, because it would be
impossible for them to cross the wide
stretches of water before them.
In this way we can follow the devel-
opment of land animals and determine
whether or not any two land areas
were ever connected in the past. We
know North and South America were
separated throughout the first half of
the Cenozoic Era (Age of Mammals),
but about the end of the Miocene (the
Dinosaur Age) the Isthmus of Panama
rose above sea level allowing animals to
cross between the two continents. That
is why today we find armadillas in Tex-
as and jaguars in Brazil.
Most geologists who have studied the
fossil evidence in the main land masses
agree that during the Cenozoic Era (about
ten million B.C. years ago) the main
land masses have not moved, however,
the changing level of the oceans has
opened and closed many land-bridges.
During the past 50 million years land-
bridges at the Bering Straits, Panama,
Suez, and an Australian-Asian bridge via
New Guinea have occurred. In the last
case the Austrailian-Asian bridge could
not have been open since the age of
Reptile since there are no placental mam-
mals found in Australia.
Early Reconstruction Becomes
More Vague
Before the Cenozoic Era there is less
information to consider, but there are
some reasons to suspect that a direct land
connection joined the southern continents
via Antarctica. To understand many of
the geological theories that explain his-

an understanding of how the Earth is
constructed.
As one proceeds down through
the crust of the Earth the tem-
perature increases. At about 75-100
miles below the surface the pressure and
temperature are so great that the rock
becomes molten and is called magma.
The solid crust above the magma is di-
vided into two types, "Sima" and "Sial."
The "Sima" is the denser of the two and
is comprised of mostly silicon and mag-
nesium salts. The "Sial" is lighter and
contains mostly silicon and aluminum
salts. These two types of rocks are not
distributed evenly over our globe; as a
matter of fact, the continents are large
masses of sial "floating" on a sea of
sima. A similar example is an iceburg
floating on the ocean and, like the ice-
berg, ninety percent of the continents
are submerged in the sima. Therefore
where sial material is found, one mav
suspect that that area may have been the
site of a large land area. The one excep-
tion is islands that are formed by vol-
canic action, which are of sima material.
Locating Lost Continents
To find the areas of sima and sial that
have been lost to the sea, geologists use
the speed of earthquake vibrations. In
studying these vibrations they have found
that the greatest areas of sima are lo-
cated in the Central Pacific and Southern
Indian and Artie oceans. These areas
are called "permanent" oceans because
no continents are expected to be discov-
ered from past, nor are they expected to
be formed in present or future. The great
submarine mountain ranges where a lost
continent might have existed, lie in the
Southwest Pacific and the Northwest In-
dian Oceans. Because the Atlantic Ocean
is mostly sima with a little sial around
the Canaries and Madeira Islands, it is
a likely guess that these islands were
once part of a large peninsula that ex-
tended in a northwest direction from
Africa.
Three Schools of Thought Prevail
The geologists of today fall into three
schools of thought: those who favor the
stable-continent theory, those who back
the transoceanic-continent idea, and those
who advance the continental-drift theory.
The stable-continent school believes in
no sunken continents, only slight in-
movements of the existing land to open
and close narrow land-bridges. The
transoceanic-continent school believes
that the continents are of constant shape
and size but that they drift on the sur-
face of the Earth.
The transoceanic-continent school be-
gan about I860 when a geologist by the
name of Blanford pointed out the like-
ness between rock and fossil deposits
in South Africa and India. He inferred
that South Africa and India had once
been connected by a large land-bridge
that included the island of Madascar.
Later this theory was broadened to in-
clude the great land-bridge between South
America and Africa.
In the 1880's the Austrian geologist
Edward Suess formed the transoceanic-
continent school. In his opinion, during
the Paleozoic Era (200,000,000 B.C.)
there was one large continent in the
Southern Hemisphere which he called
Gondwanaland, and two smaller conti-
nents in the Northern Hemisphere. How-
ever, many geologists object to this idea
because if this vast continent described
by Suess were present it would have dis-
placed enough water to submerge the
other two continents completely.
Many American geologists take the
middle of the road in the above two
theories. They tend to picture the con-
nections between the continents as small
"isthmian links" instead of the broad,,
ocean filling, continental links as de-
scribed by Suess.
That leaves the continental-drift the-
ory which was proposed by Alfred Wege-
ner. Working on the theory that the
continents floated on a layer of sima, he
stated in his theory that a single super
continent existed in the Paleozoic Era.
This large mass of land broke apart in
the Mesozoic Era and drifted apart in
the Pleistocene Period. However Wege-
ner's theory has fatal flaws. The Paleon-
tologist object because the distribution
of animals proves that Europe and North
America were separated before the Meso-
zoic Era. Another objection is the force
required to move these continents. A
geophysicist by the name of Lambert
calculated the force and found the con-
tinents were only one millionth the size
required to produce such a force. And,
by the way, how could continents made
of light and comparatively week sial,
plow through the denser and stronger
sima?
Geologists Do Agree on Many Ideas
Even though the geologigsts differ they
agree on many things; there may have
been lost continents in the Paleozoic Era
(200 million B.C.) when the highest
life consisted of lizard like reptiles. How-
ever, these continents were not real con-
tinents but narrow isthmuses connecting
present day land masses. And if these
continents ever existed they lost their
shape during the Mesozoic Era.
These changes that took place were
so gradual that none of these continents
could possibly have lasted to within mil-
lions of years of the time of man. They
also agree that a new and true explana-
tion may come to light and perhaps it
may combine features of several of the
older theories, and who knows it may
Still come in our lifetime.

With the increased amount of discov-
eries about the atom, there arises a need
for newer and better equipment to study
this building block of the universe. Such
is no exception at Michigan. To replace
the cyclotron that was build in the base-
ment of Randal Laboratory is the new
14-30 million electron volt machine un-
der construction on North Campus. This
month Michigan Education and Research
describes the core of this new cyclotron.
Also featured are clips on a new medical
research project and an improvement on
the newly developed Ruby Maser ampli-
fier.
New Cyclotron Core
The magnet core of a variable energy
cyclotron, weighing an estimated 310
tons, has been shipped from Bethlehem
Steel Company's Bethlehem, Pa., plant
to the Physics Department of The Uni-
versity of Michigan at Ann Arbor.
Built for the University under a con-
tract with the Atomic Energy Commis-
sion, the "atom smasher," when opera-
tional in 1963, will be used for research
on the nuclei of the heavier elements.
When completed, the cyclotron will have
a continuously variable energy range of
1 5 to 40 million electron-volts. It will be
housed in a new $1.1 million laboratory
facility now under construction on the
University's North Campus.
The heaviest individual parts of the
magnet core are the top and bottom mem-
bers of the magnet frame, also called the
yoke. Each weighs approximately 105
tons. When joined with vertical span-
ners by large dowel pins and studs, they
form a magnet frame measuring 224
inches long, 83 inches wide, and 143
inches high. The magnet poles, top and
bottom, will be located within this mag-
net frame.
Forged, machined and completely as-
sembled at the Bethlehem plant, the mag-
net core components for the cyclotron
were fabricated on some of the largest
planers and vertical boring mills in the
country. Specifications required the fin-
ishing of these components to thou-
sandths and micro inches.
A cyclotron is primarily a research in-
strument which permits physicists to alter
the atomic nucleus in order to study
nuclear phenomena. It does this by ac-
celerating protons or the nuclei of other
light-weight atoms until they have
enough speed to penetrate the nuclei of
target atoms. The protons are injected
into the center of an evacuated tank en-
closing the gap between pole tips in the
magnet core. The paths of the protons
are curved by the strong magnetic field,
so that they spiral from the center out-
ward, making many revolutions in the
field. Each time around they receive an
accelerating "kick." Near the periphery
of the tank, where they have attained a
speed of approximatly 1/5 that of light,
they are pulled out of the tank and direct-
ed at a target. Having tremendous energy,
the protons break the target atom and
induce changes which, when studied with
an array of electrical instruments, en-
able scientists to piece together the intri-
cate details of nuclear reactions.
An unusual feature in the design of
this cyclotron core is an air gap of one-
half inch between pole and pole tip, in
each of the two poles forming the magnet
core. The poles of the cyclotron are of
the spiral ridge type. This term refers to
the shape of the magnet field inside the
air gap—a magnetic field with properties
that enable the emerging particles to be
focused better than with the more conven-
tional uniform field cyclotron. This
unique feature permits higher particle
energy as well as better control of the
energy.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


University of Michigan physicists and
engineers are beginning a program to
design and build a radiotelescope ampli-
fier which they expect will be perhaps
ten times more sensitive than any other
in the world.
The 1st Solid-State Physics Laboratory,
which will do the research on the new
ruby maser amplifier, designed and built
the maser now operating on the Univer-
sity's 85-foot radio telescope at Peach
Mountain, some 14 miles northwest of

this amplifier is probably the most sensi-

astronomers made the world's first un-
ambiguous records of natural radio emis-
sions from the planet Saturn and from

making the new amplifier some ten times

it much simpler to operate and more re-
liable.
A ruby maser—which uses a synthetic
ruby crystal as the sensitive element—

as the present system requires that liquid
helium be poured in before each opera-
tion, the new one will have "closed-cycle

The development of an advanced maser
radiometer will require improvement
both in the performance characteristics
of the maser amplifier and in the over-all

The 1ST research program will se?k

coupling methods. The Solid-State Phys-
ics Laboratory has already produced a
simple, versatile silvered ruby maser
cavity which yields voltage gain-band-
width products in excess of 300 mc.se
under field conditions. These products
are about three times higher than the
best previous cavity maser systems.
Improvement in the over-all perform-
ance characteristics of the system will re-
quire primarily the use of input compo-
nents cooled to liquid helium tempera-
ture. To reduce the noise temperature
further and increase the gain stability,
the system design will include a helium
temperature-comparison load to estab-
lish a standard reference temperature,
and low-temperature loads on all spare
circulator ports. An improved horn de-
sign will be sought to reduce the effect-

Forthcoming space exploration
will require exotic fuels and new concepts in
energy conversion to keep men alive and equip-
ment operating for long periods of time beyond
the earth's atmosphere. Advanced hydrogen sys-
tems recently developed by The Garrett Corpora-
tion have solved this problem of providing the
electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic power, plus
cooling and heating required aboard a satellite or
space capsule during launching, outer space flight
and re-entry.
Besides such spacecraft and missile systems,
other product areas in which Garrett engineers
work include small gas turbine engines, flight
data systems for air and underwater use, nuclear
and solar power systems, cryogenic systems and

controls, and air conditioning and pressurization
systems for conventional aircraft and advanced
flight vehicles.
Such diversity of interest not only makes work
more interesting at Garrett, but gives the engineer
an opportunity to increase his knowledge and
chances for responsibility and advancement.
An orientation program lasting a period of
months is also available for the newly graduated
engineer, working on assignments with experi-

Space Image Tube
When Uvicon, a new electronic imag-
ing tube, is placed on a vehicle in space,
it will enable scientists to learn more
about the stars and the depths of inter-
stellar space. The tube is sensitive to the
short wave length ultraviolet light rays
that are emitted by celestial bodies but
never reach the surface of the earth since
they are screened by the atmosphere.
Uvicon is an extremely sensitive image
tube operating in the range from 1200 to
2000 angstroms. The tube is about two
inches in diameter, twelve inches long
and weighs about eight ounces.
In operation, the Uvicon receives an
ultraviolet image through a special win-
dow, made of lithium fluoride, mounted
at the input end of the tube. The back
surface of the window is coated with a
photo-emitting material that releases elec-
trons when the ultraviolet image strikes
it. These electrons are accelerated by
15,000 volts toward the rear end of the
tube, where they strike a thin film or
target.
The impact of the electrons on the
target causes it to take on an amplified
electrical charge in the exact pattern of
the ultraviolet image. The next step is
to read off this charge as an electrical
signal and thus reproduce the image
electrically. This is done by scanning the
rear surface of the target with a beam of
electrons, much as an electron beam scans

outer space research.
the viewing end of a television picture
tube. In the Uvicon, however, the prod-
uct of the scanning is an electrical "im-
age" that can be amplified and broadcast,
rather than a visual image that can be
seen directly. The over-all technique is
known as electron bombardment in-
duced conductivity.
Uvicon was developed at the Astro-
physical Observatory of the Smithsonian
Institution, for the Observatory's Proj-
ect Celescope. It is one of several experi-
ments planned to be launched in the
National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration's (NASA) orbiting astronomi-
cal observatory program. NASA has
announced that the first of the orbiting
observatories is planned for 1963.
"NASA will launch a series of
rockets from its Wallops Station, Va.,
site, employing the Aerobee-Hi rocket,
to place the Uvicon and its associated
electronic equipment well beyond the
absorbing portion of the earth's atmos-
phere. The purpose is to sample the
strength and nature of the ultraviolet
radiations we will encounter and to get
preliminary data on the performance of
the entire Project Celescope electronic-
telescope system."
Essentially, this telescope consists of
three components: (1) an optical ar-
rangement to form the ultraviolet im-
ages; (2) a Uvicon pick-up tube and
its associated circuitry, which constitute
a TV camera that responds to the ultra-
violet images and converts them into
electrical signals; and (3) a transmitter
to broadcast these signals back down to
earth. Thus, in television fashion, scien-

and interstellar space that always has
been screened from man's vision.
The ultraviolet telescope package will
go into the noose cone of an Aerobee-Hi
rocket, which will take it to an altitude
of about 150 miles. The useful portion
of the flight will be the five minutes spent
above an altitude of 60 miles, which is
the height at which the ultraviolet radi-
ations of interest cease to be absorbed.
At this height the protective front por-
tion of the nose cone will be jettisoned
and the telescope exposed to the skies.
Information on brightness of stars
will be telemetered to electronic storage
equipment on the ground for final analy-
sis of stellar magnitudes. In addition,
the presence of sources of ultraviolet
radiation in interstellar space will be
recorded.
T.V. Helps
Television has helped an astronomer
to record the light (picked-up by the
University of Arizona 36-inch telescope)
issuing from the Globula Cluster M 15
tens of thousands of years ago. Television
is said to be more sensitive than a pho-
tographic plate by a factor of 50 to 100—
in other words, exposures have to be
50-to-100 times longer with photography.
Thus, television makes it possible to take-
many more pictures.
Fastest Air Blast
Plans to utilize a series of the world's
fastest operating air blast power circuit-
breakers to help protect a 345,000-volt
transmission network have been an-
nounced.
The breakers will be the first air blast
design to be built at this voltage which
will clear short-circuit currents as high
as 25-million kilovoltamperes in two elec-
trical cycles (1 30th of a second). The
previous fastest showed the short circuit
current to be three cycles (I—20th of a
second). The increasing number of high-
er-output generators going into service-
makes it imperative that transient power
faults be cleared quickly to keep the
power system in balance; hence, the re-
quirement for the 2-cycIe interrupting
time. The faster fault clearing will fur-
ther the success of high-speed reclosing
to restore facilities to service in about
1/3 second.
The air blast design eliminates need
for inflammable oils customarily used for
high--voltage circuit interrupting means.
Instead, the breaker uses air under com-

pression as the interrupting medium.
Temporary lightning-induced short-cir-
cuit arcs and system disturbances will be
snuffed out automatically by blasts of
self-replenishing high-pressure air stored
within the breaker's interrupting cham-
bers.
The inherent characteristics of the air
blast design make it possible to provide
an exceptionally fast operating breaker
with low maintenance costs.
Transparent Shock Tube
Head-on collision of two shock waves
traveling 80 times faster than sound has
been achieved in a hydromagnetic tube
made of glass. Scientists developed this
unusual use for glass piping in a study
of high temperature gases.
The glass tube is 12 feet long and 6
inches in diameter. Scientists believe it is
the largest tube ever used in an experi-
ment of this kind.
Because the tube is transparent, still
photographs can be taken of the collid-
ing shock waves. At impact, the Pyrex
piping is brightly illuminated. The naked
eye catches only a brief flash, but the
camera with shutter left open in a dark-
ened room records the collision. The
flash is accompanied by a loud report
similar to an exploding firecracker.
Studies growing out of the shock tube
program could have important results in
the development of effective ion and
plasma-propulsion systems. The tube is
expected to be useful in measuring tem-
peratures of gases up to several million
degrees. It also will be used in the study
of microwave emission and energy loss
through radiation.
The shock waves are driven through
the glass piping by a surge of electrical
power equal to the output of four Grand
Coulee Dams. The electrical energy used
to create the waves is stored in two 20-
capacitor banks rated at 20,000 volts
with a combined peak power of between
2,500,000 and 5,000,000 kilowatts.
Once triggered, the shocks last only a
few microseconds, but create a gas tem-
perature within the tube of approximately
one million degrees.
The thermal as well as the magnetic
energy in the electrical discharge creates
shock waves which initially race along at
300 times the speed of sound. After
traveling about 60 inches toward the
center of the tube, however, both shock
waves are "slowed" to about 80 times
the speed of sound—still more than two
dozen times the speed of a rifle bullet.
Through the glass, the velocity of the
shock waves and spectra of radiation
from the gas are recorded with a high-
speed rotating mirror camera. A new
vacuum ultraviolet grating spectrograph
—a device for separating light into its
components—is also being used to eval-
uate the data.

Inco Nickel helps give engineers the solution
to metal problems in new radio telescope
How do you design a precision instru-
ment that will "see" 38 billion light
years into space? This problem was
answered by the engineers working
on this revolutionary, new radio
telescope.
But these engineers faced another
challenging problem — How do you
actually build it? How do you build
a telescope as tall as a 66-story build-
ing with a reflector so big it could
hold six football fields?
How do you build a rotating mecha-
nism that can swing this giant up or
down, or sideways, to aim at any spot
in the Universe with pin-point accu-
racy? Just the tiniest amount of wear
or distortion in this mechanism could
throw the telescope millions of miles
off target in the far reaches of space!
Where could they get construction
materials tough and strong enough?
Nickel gave them the answer! Nickel
in steel gave these engineers a mate-
rial tough enough to maintain pre-
cision in the rotating mechanism even
under the anticipated 20,000-ton load.
And Nickel, to be used in the steel
members, gave them the high strength
at minimum weight needed to sup-
port the giant reflector.
The radio telescope is one of the
many developments in which Nickel
has solved important problems. Most
probably you, yourself, in the near
future, will be faced with problems
just as difficult. When you are, you can
count on Nickel—and the cooperation
of Inco — to help get the job done .. .
and done right!

at a mere 170,000 miles per hour. At this
temperature pressure has risen to 1,500
atmospheres. The gas that now exists in
the container is called a plasma.
Finally we reach the fantastic tempera-
ture of one million degrees! The pressure
has reached a value of 1.5 million atmos-
pheres and the electrons are traveling at
a 90,000 miles per second while the
deuterons at 1,500 miles per second. At
this temperature the nuclei have finally
acquired sufficient energy to overcome
electrostatic repulsion, but still a signifi-
cant number of fusion reactions do not
occur because the number of direct colli-
sions is not enough and also because
many of the collisions result in deflec-
tions and scattering. Not until a tempera-
ture of 350,000,000 degrees will the
conditions be right for a sustained ther-
monuclear reaction.
The previous description sounds like
pure science fiction, but it is actually
not as impossible as it first appears to be.
When the high temperatures are men-
(Continued from page 17)
tioned, the immediate thought is to re-
late this to heat content. However, this
is not the case. In reality this tempera-
ture is a measure of kinetic energy, i.e.
the temperatures necessary to impart the
required amounts of kinetic energy to
the particles. To illustrate this, consider
the fact that, theoretically, for a sustained
reaction to occur the densities of the
plasma must be about 10,:i to 1016 par-
ticles per centimeter, or about one ten-
thousandth of standard atmospheric den-
sity. With such a thin fuel, the tempera-
ture would be very hot in terms of speed
of its particles, but the actual beat con-
tent would be low. A liter of deuterium
plasma at a kinetic temperature of 350
million degrees, would have an actual
heat content of about 18,000 calories,
just enough to heat a small cup of coffee.
Although the previous statements lead
one to believe that the plasma can be
easily confined, this is not necessarily
true. At such a high temperature, the
mean free paths of the particles are far
greater than any practical material con-
tainer. For fusion to occur, the high kin-
etic temperature must be maintained, but
any material container could not possi-
bly confine the plasma without particles
colliding with the walls of the container.
Such collisions would result in a loss of
energy and the particles would be cooled
below the critical temperature. Thus, the
first practical problem in the design of a
reactor would be a method of confining
the plasma.
Confinement
At the present time, the most prac-
tical method of confinement appears to
be by a magnetic field. It is a common
fact that the charged particles will be
acted on by the force of an applied
electromagnetic field. A charged par-
ticle of mass m (grams) moving with a
velocity v (cm/sec) perpendicular to a
magnetic field B (gauss) will be forced
mv
into a circular path of radius r = ——
qB
where q is the charge on the particle
(electromagnetic units.) Any velocity
component parallel to the magnetic field
is unaffected by the field, thus the par-
ticle will move in a spiral path about the
magnetic field lines.
Consider a long cylindrical tube with a
magnetic field parallel to the axis, and
into this tube are introduced some
charged particles. The particles cannot
move out into the walls because they are
constrained by the magnetic field, but
they can move freely along the field lines.
Applying this to the hot plasma, we can
see that although the velocity of the
particles is tremendous, the velocity is
restricted to one direction by the mag-
netic field. Collisions with material walls
would no longer be a problem because a
sufficiently strong field would confine the
gas even at 350 million degrees. We
now have a possible method of confine-
ment, but now the problem arises: how
to set up the field.
Pinch Effect
There are two basically different meth-
ods which can be used to establish the

necessary fields. One is to use an ex-
ternal coil carrying a current, the other
is to use the self-magnetic field created
by causing a large current to flow
through the plasma. Consider the latter
method.
The current flowing in the plasma cre-
ates the lines of magnetic flux whose di-

rection is determined by the right-hand
rule. (See fig. 1.) The strongest field is
immediately outside the plasma and if
the plasma current is all on the surface,
the field immediately falls to zero at the
surface and there is no magnetic field
inside. The plasma at the boundry experi-
ences an inward force which is propor-
tional to the square of the magnetic in-
duction and tends to constrict or pinch
the plasma. This is known as the pinch
effect.
If the magnetic field or the plasma is
displaced, say in the form of a small
kink, the magnetic field lines are shifted.
(See fig. 2.) The magnetic field increases
below the kink and decreases above, hence
the displacement increases. This displace-
ment increases until the magnetic contain-
ment is distorted to the point where it is
driven into the walls of the container
that isolate the plasma. Several modified
systems have corrected this effect, but
other problems arose that make the pinch
effect difficult to utilize on an experi-
mental device.
Stellarator
The alternative solution to the prob-
lem of the field has brought about the
invention of a device called the stellara-
tor. (Fig. 3) Developed oy Dr. Lyman
field necessarily varies as I R where R is
the radius of the torus. As a consequence
of this field variation with distance from
the axis of symmetry there is a strong
tendency for the particles to drift across
the field instead of being confined by it.
Positive ions drift up, electrons drift
down, and a vertical electric field is cre-
ated. The electrons are prevented by the
magnetic field from moving to neutralize
this charge accumulation. As a result the
whole plasma drifts at right angles to
both the electric and magnetic fields. One
solution to this problem was to twist the
torus into a figure eight, however, addi-
tional and more complex problems arose.
Up-to Date
To date a sustained controlled reaction
has not been achieved. All of the theory
and experiments are presently aimed at
the problems of confining the plasma.
Once containment has been perfected,
then other problems such as heating,
power extraction, and devising a com-
mercial reactor will be tackled. This
short excursion into the maze-like world
of fusion control can just barely intro-
duce the reader to the infinite complex-
ities of fusion reactions, but for a mo-
ment let us look into the future and
glance at some of the advantages of
fusion power. A commercial reactor will
be very large, probably a centralized pow-
er installation with a size on the order
of a typical power dam. On the basis of
present knowledge, the pocket sized
reactor will be out of the question.
The source of fuel will be virtually
unlimited. Although only a small fraction
of water is deuterium, (water will be
the main source of fuel), still the deuter-
ium in one gallon of water has the
energy equivalent of 350 gallons of
gasoline. If a deuterium reactor were
operating at an efficiency of 10%, it
would unlock 10'" kilowatt years of use-
ful energy using only one-half of the
total amount of deuterium in the oceans
of the world. At the present rate of pow-
er consumption, this would provide
energy for the next 100 billion years!
In addition to the attractive quantities
of available power, there are no dis-
posal problems—the only wastes are in-
ert gases. Better still, fuel will be cheap.
The cost of extracting deuterium from
sea water will be less than one percent
as expensive as mining coal.
As one can see the rewards are great,
and the problems even greater. Various
predictions have been made, concerning
the speed with which fusion control will
come about, that range from 20 to 50
years. It seems likely to assume that as
more people become involved in research
and as countries of the world pool their
resources, it is possible that fusion power
will be available long before fossil and
fission fuels are exhausted.

expanding in fertilizers... a growth industry
Fertilizer consumption in the United States is up
88% in 15 years—from 13,466,000 to 25,313,000
tons.
In the same 15 years, consumption in the 16 central
states increased almost 140%—from 4,607,000 to
11,009,000 tons. This is the primary market for
National Distillers and Chemical Corporation's fer-
tilizer chemicals—ammonia, nitrogen solutions and
sulfuric and phosphoric acids manufactured at
U. S. I. division plants in Illinois, Iowa and Kansas.
Now National has taken an important forward step
in integrating its fertilizer operations by merger
with Federal Chemical Company. Federal is a 76-
year-old mixed fertilizer manufacturer with six
modern plants in Kentucky, Tennessee, Illinois,
Indiana and Ohio, heart of the mid-west farm belt.

-you'll find Photography at Work with you
Oolving the problems of a human
being living in outer space has
become the task of scores of engi-
neers, chemists and botanists. And
serving them as a valuable working
tool is photography. It records the
growth of experimental plants and
fungi that can well become the
space voyager's food supply. Through
autoradiography it can show the
absorption of cosmic radioactive
material, trace its circulation within
the organism.
There's hardly a field on which
you can set your sights where pho-
tography does not play a part in
advancing work and simplifying
routine. It saves time and expense
in research, on the production line,
in the engineering and sales depart-
ments, and in the office.
So in whatever you plan to do,
take full advantage of all the ways
photography can help.

Interview with
General Electric's Byron A. Case
Manager—Employee Compensation Service
Your Salary
at General Electric
Several surveys indicate that salary is
not the primary contributor to job
satisfaction. Nevertheless, salary con-
siderations will certainly play a big
part in your evaluation of career op-
portunities. Perhaps an insight into the
salary policies of a large employer of
engineers like General Electric will
help you focus your personal salary
objectives.
Salary—a most individual and per-
sonal aspect of your job—is difficult to
discuss in general terms. While recog-
nizing this, Mr. Case has tried answering
as directly as possible some of your
questions concerning salary:
Q Mr. Case, what starting salary does
your company pay graduate engineers?
A Well, you know as well as I that
graduates' starting salaries are greatly
influenced by the current demand for
engineering talent. This demand es-
tablishes a range of "going rates" for
engineering graduates which is no doubt
widely known on your campus. Be-
cause General Electric seeks outstand-
ing men, G-E starting salaries for these
candidates lie in the upper part of the
range of "going rates." And within
General Electric's range of starting sal-
aries, each candidate's ability and
potential are carefully evaluated to de-
termine his individual starting salary.
Q How do you go about evaluating
my ability and potential value to your
company?
A We evaluate each individual in the
light of information available to us:
type of degree; demonstrated scholar-
ship; extra-curricular contributions; work
experience; and personal qualities as
appraised by interviewers and faculty
members. These considerations deter-
mine where within G.E.'s current sal-
ary range the engineer's starting salary
will be established.
Q When could I expect my first salary
increase from General Electric and how
much would it be?
A Whether a man is recruited for a
specific job or for one of the principal
training programs for engineers—the
Engineering and Science Program, the
Manufacturing Training Program, or
the Technical Marketing Program—his
individual performance and salary are
reviewed at least once a year.
For engineers one year out of col-
lege, our recent experience indicates a
first-year salary increase between 6 and
15 percent. This percentage spread re-
flects the individual's job performance
and his demonstrated capacity to do
more difficult work. So you see, salary
adjustments reflect individual perform-
ance even at the earliest stages of
professional development. And this
emphasis on performance increases
as experience and general competence
increase.
Q How much can I expect to be making
after five years with General Electric?
A As I just mentioned, ability has a
sharply increasing influence on your
salary, so you have a great deal of per-
sonal control over the answer to your
question.
It may be helpful to look at the cur-
rent salaries of all General Electric
technical-college graduates who re-
ceived their bachelor's degrees in 1954
(and now have over 5 years experience).
Their current median salary, reflect-
ing both merit and economic changes,
is about 70 percent above the 1954
median starting rate. Current salaries
for outstanding engineers from this
class are more than double the 1954
median starting rates and, in some
cases, are three or four times as great.
Q What kinds of benefit programs
does your company offer, Mr. Case?
A Since I must be brief, I shall merely
outline the many General Electric em-
ployee benefit programs. These include
a liberal pension plan, insurance plans,
an emergency aid plan, employee dis-
counts, and educational assistance pro-
grams.
The General Electric Insurance Plan
has been widely hailed as a "pace
setter" in American industry. In addi-
tion to helping employees and their
families meet ordinary medical expen-
ses, the Plan also affords protection
against the expenses of "catastrophic"
accidents and illnesses which can wipe
out personal savings and put a family
deeply in debt. Additional coverages in-
clude life insurance, accidental death
insurance, and maternity benefits.
Our newest plan is the Savings and
Security Program which permits em-
ployees to invest up to six percent of
their earnings in U.S. Savings Bonds
or in combinations of Bonds and Gen-
eral Electric stock. These savings are
supplemented by a Company Propor-
tionate Payment equal to 50 percent
of the employee's investment, subject
to a prescribed holding period.

EYES MADE FOR DARKNESS Westinghouse scientists expect that airplane pilots are going
to be able to see the ground clearly on a cloudy, moonless night. Astronomers will be able
to see vastly beyond the present range of their telescopes, perhaps to the final boundary of
the universe, if there is one. Policemen will peer into dark alleys and see through special bin-
oculars. Scientists at Westinghouse are working on the proposition that no matter how
dark it looks to us, there is plenty of "light" everywhere: on a black night, in a coal mine, in a
sealed room. We just have the wrong kind of eyes to see it all. So they have developed a de-
vice that "sees" infrared light which we can sense only as heat...another device that "sees"
ultraviolet light, which we can detect only when it gives us sunburn...still another that picks
up a single "packet" of light, the smallest amount that can exist, and multiplies it into a
visible flash. You can be sure...if it's

Advanced power conversion systems
for space vehicles utilizing energy of the sun or
heat from a nuclear reactor are now being devel-
oped by Garrett's AiResearch divisions. Under
evaluation are dynamic and static systems which
convert heat into a continuous electrical power
supply for space flight missions of extended dura-
tion. Component and material developments for
these systems are being advanced in the fields of
liquid metals, heat transfer, nonmechanical and
turboelectric energy conversion, turbomachinery,
alternators and controls.
Besides solar and nuclear power systems for
space applications, other product areas at Garrett
include small gas turbine engines, environmental
systems for advanced flight vehicles, cryogenic
fluid systems and controls, pneumatic valves and
controls and missile accessory power units.
This diversification of project areas enables
the engineer at Garrett to specialize or diversify
according to his interest, not only making work
more interesting but increasing the opportunities
for responsibility and advancement.
An orientation program lasting several months
is available for the newly graduated engineer,
working on assignments with highly experienced
engineers in laboratory, preliminary design and
development projects. In this way his most profit-
able areas of interest can be found.

'TIiq £ditotA Pen —
Recently I overheard a conversation between a freshman, who
had been in Ann Arbor for several months, and a local citizen of
25 years' residency. It was a rainy, windy day, and the student
remarked to the effect, "Well, this is certainly Ann Arbor weather
for you—storm, storm, storm". The citizen chuckled, and said,
"I've been hearing the same thing from the freshman classes all
my life. What makes you think the weather is really any worse here
than any place else in the midwest?"
Today I called the U-M Meterology Lab in an attempt to get
an answer to this question. As I suspected, the plain fact is that
Ann Arbor weather is in all respects typical of the weather of the
Great Lakes region. The topography, I'm told, has no influence.
Consequently, I was led to wonder at length about students'
attitudes toward their adopted city. Of course, the old principle that
"the grass always looks greener" applies in part. But I feel that a
good deal of student opinion about the city is colored by the fact
that they are living away from home, family and friends; that they
do not know the city as well as their home city; that many come
from much larger or much smaller communities, with different
atmospheres; and that for several other reasons, their residency
here is off on the wrong foot to begin with, independent of the
town's qualities.
I have accumulated about seven years' Ann Arbor residency,
both as a student and as a nonstudent, and I have been working
on a course project that brings me into contact with various city
planning officials. I have become somewhat fond of Ann Arbor,
and would like to defend her to my readers.
First, the weather. If the records show it is typical of the region,
who has a legitimate gripe? Those who go to school in the Great
Lakes region should be prepared for Great Lakes weather—which
is actually better than weather in many, many regions.
Next, the planning and government of the city: I have found
the city's administrators apparently very skilled and competent.
Criticisms of city policy with regard to traffic, one-way streets, etc,
should be made with reservation, because these policies result from
far greater experience, concern, and skill than any student would be
expected to have. The same is true of almost any city policy. Granted
that criticism is desirable and often may be quite helpful, but gen-
erally the city's practices are soundly based and reasonable.
The overwhelming virtue of this town, however, arises from
its being the seat of an important university. Here in Ann Arbor
there is a concentration of wealth and of intellect rearely found
elsewhere. We have a rare collection of cultural, economic, and
interest features. If only the student body used them more exten-
sively! Then would they appreciate this great little burg properly.
These remarks are addresseed to a minority—the gripers and
complainers. Just the same, I feel the general attitude of the stu-
dent toward the town is a bit more negative than is justifiable.

Each 6,000,000 pound thrust rocket ship now being planned for manned
interplanetary exploration will gulp as much propellant as the entire capac-
ity of a 170 passenger DC-8 Jetliner in less than 4 secondsl It will consume
1,140 tons in the rocket's approximately 2 minutes of burning time. Required
to carry this vast quantity of propellant will be tanks tall as 8 story buildings,
strong enough to withstand tremendous G forces, yet of minimum weight.
Douglas is especially qualified to build giant-sized space ships of this type
because of familiarity with every structural and environmental problem
involved. This has been gained through 18 years of experience in producing

HIGH ENERGY SPARKS
Recent investigations have brought about the
development and application of electric sparks
more powerful than lightning.
By IRVING SALMEEN
Associate Editor
Nature's high energy spark, pho-
tographed during a typical thun-
derstorm.
For centuries man's curiosity has lead
him to investigate the many natur-
al phenomena that influence his environ-
ment. One of the oldest of these is
lightning. Very early in his investigation,
he had the opportunity to witness the
blinding flash and the display of tremen-
dous power as a bolt splintered a large
tree. The eighteenth and nineteenth cen-
turies produced many men who carried
on basic experiments that lead to an un-
derstanding of the nature of lighting
and electrical discharges.
Among the results of the investiga-
tions was the development of various ap-
paratus, which opened the field of mod-
ern electronics, that utilized the effects
of an electric discharge through gases at
low pressures. However, few have stud-
ied the effects of the same electric dis-
charge through a gas at high pressures.
In fact, literature on the subject pub-
lished before the mid-1950's is most dif-
ficult to procure.
Previous to the midtwentieth century,
only two important applications had
been found for high pressure discharge
—the wireless telegraph used the prin-
ciple in the so-called spark transmitter,
and modern engineers found it a very
practical means of igniting fuel in inter-
nal combustion engines.
The instantaneous discharge of electric-
ity mentioned in the previous paragraph
can be generally classified as a spark.
Although it is a rather loose term, it is
commonly applied. Electrical discharges
at high pressures are called high energy
sparks. In the early 1950's extensive re-
search was begun at the University of
Michigan on various methods to attain
very high energy sparks and possible
modes of application for them. Sponsored
by the U.S. Army Office of Ordnance Re-
search, the program is headed by H. C.
Early, research engineer and lecturer in
electrical enginering, and Profssor E. A.
Martin of the electrical engineering de-
partment. They have succeeded in con-
centrating about half the peak current of

a major lightning stroke into a hair-thin
path a half-inch long. The methods of
achieving such a spark are most in-
genious.
Spark Production
In a conventional spark device such as
across the electrodes of an induction coil
or a capacitor charged to high voltage,
only small quantities of energy are avail-
able because the resistance of the air gap
drops to such a point during the dis-
charge that the gap acts as nothing more
than a short circuit. The energy associ-
ated with the discharge, according to
Ohm's law is: P = PR, where P is ener-
gy, I is current and R is resistance.
It appears at first that to obtain more
power one must merely increase the cur-
rent. However, instead of the added cur-
rent being turned into a more powerful
spark, more power is simply dissipated
through the circuit wiring. The only other
alternative is to increase the resistance of
the gap. If the resistance of the gap is in-
creased so that a significant amount of
stored energy is dissipated in a small vol-
ume within a few microseconds, the gas is
heated to an extreme temperature and an
explosive pressure results. When the
spark takes place in the presence of a
liquid, the vapor which is produced
causes additional pressure.
This is one of the methods by which
high energy sparks are achieved. Figure
1 shows a simple electrical circuit which
was used, where the electrodes were im-
mersed in water. The energy for the dis-
charge can be stored in capacitors, in in-
ductors or rotating machinery. As energy
is rapidly transferred to the spark chan-
nel, its temperature and pressure rise. In
contrast to sparks in a fluid medium of
low mass density, such as a gas, the me-
chanical inertia of the water exerts a
nearly rigid opposition to the expansion
of the spark channel. Due to the confin-
ing action, extremely high pressures are
developed.
After the switch is closed, a time in-
terval of several hundred to several thou-
sand microseconds elapses before a gas-
eous channel is formed in the liquid.
During this interval, the current is lim-
ited to a relatively small value deter-
mined by the purity of the water. As
soon as the gaseous path (in a plasma
state) is established through the water,
the current rises to a high value and the
discharge is completed in about 10 addi-
tional microseconds. Pressures on the
order of 10,000 atmospheres can be
achieved by this method.'
Another equally effective means of
producing the high energies is by con-
fining the spark between adjacent paral-
lel dielectric surfaces. Figure 2 illustrates
an experiment to demonstrate the force
produced by a spark between two such
surfaces. The electrodes of the spark gap
are recessed in small slots in a mycalex
block, as shown in figure 3. A flat bake-
lite plate is placed on top of the block
and a spark is passed between the two
adjacent surfaces. If these surfaces are flat
enough so that the air film between them
is quite thin, i.e. of the order of a thou-
sandth of an inch or less, the spark will
cause the top plate to fly up and hit the
ceiling.2
In this type of experiment, the efficien-
cy with which the stored electrical energy
is converted into kinetic energy is not
particularily high, of the order of 2 or
3 percent. The magnitude of the gas
pressure generated by the spark can be
estimated by means of a simple calculation
which involves the spark duration and the
mechanical work done. The maximum
pressure is of the order of a hundred at-
mospheres. A thin film of oil or water
between the two surfaces substantially
increases the pressure generated by a
given amount of stored electrical energy.
Many Uses
The previous descriptions of methods
for producing high energy sparks can
barely serve as an introduction to the
subject. There are infinite complexities

associated with the phenomenon that can-
not possibly be described in an article of
this nature. Nevertheless, ignoring other
technical aspects, it is interesting to note
some of the uses and interesting effects
of such sparks.
One of the first applications depends
on the very high surface brightness which
is a consequence of the 30,000 degree
temperature and the high particle density.
As it happens, the radiation from the
underwater spark has a large output in
the ultraviolet, where films and photo-
surfaces have maximum sensitivity. Since
the light output of the spark lasts about
28 microseconds with an intensity about
600 times that of the sun, it is obvious
that, with proper mechanical apparatus,
this would be an excellent device for
high speed photography.
In plasmas encountered in fusion re-
search (see the March, 1961, issue of
the Tecbnic), high energy spark research
becomes useful in studying the passage
of a current through a highly ionized
gas. This is also closely related to the
development of ion propulsion systems
for interplanetary space vehicles.
Recently, oil companies have applied
the high pressures exerted by a spark in
drilling for oil. The electrodes connected
to a capacitor bank are submerged in a
liquid in the drill head. A spark is then
produced within the confined liquid. As
the shock wave expands at a pressure of
10,000 atmospheres or so, it chips away
the rock. It is not difficult to see that this
has an advantage over conventional bits
that must be continually replaced.
One large food company has found
a rather unique use for sparks. In a cer-
tain process, residue that is difficult to
remove collects on mixing paddles. To
solve the problem, underwater sparks
were incorporated utilizing the shock
wave to chip off the residue.
Hypersonic wind tunnels are another
source of employment for sparks. A bank
of capacitors is charged to a very high
voltage and connected across a gap of
high resistance. The gap is situated be-
hind a diaphragm that separates the spark
gap from the wind tunnel. The spark
discharge breaks the diaphragm and cre-
ates a wave that simulates hypersonic
re-entry speeds of aircraft and missiles at
altitudes above 100,000 feet.
Figure 4 illustrates another highly
promising application. In various manu-
facturing processes, it is often required
to make holes of wierd shapes in metals.
Conventional machining methods some-
times make the process very difficult.
High-energy sparks again come to the
rescue. If a die of the required shape is
placed over the metal and the metal sub-
jected to a high energy spark at close
range, the pressure is sufficient to punch
a hole the shape of the die.
A short time ago a large magazine
wanted to insert several pages with holts
punched in them so that they could be
placed in a loose leaf notebook. On pre-
vious occasions, the operations were in-
volved and expensive. First the pages
had to be printed, then cut to size, then
bundled and drilled, untied and rein-
serted. Using high energy sparks, the pro-
cess is now done as the pages come off
the printing press. A tiny die the size of
the hole was placed in position, then a
spark was fired close to the paper. The-
re-suit? A neatly punched hole. But the
advantage of the spark method is that it
can be worked while the paper is moving
20 feet per second.
The previous examples show the ex-
treme practical utility of high energy
sparks, but as Professor Martin points
out, it is more useful as a research tool.
Sparks aid in the research conducted in
many areas such as plasma physics, gas
dynamics, and gas conductivity.

TALKING TO A COMPUTER
Contrary to popular opinion, computers are not
such "super-brains", indeed their intelligence
allows them to recognize only two symbols.
By RICHARD KARPINSKI
"Hi, there, Joe. How are you doing?"
I said as I entered the office.
Not realizing that the question was
merely polite and rhetorical, Joe an-
swered, "Oh, pretty well considering the
neglect I've received in the past 2.487
weeks. There are only two bad tubes
in me noX. Oops, three, and I only use
one of them frequently."
Considering the pie I'd just had for
dessert, I jokingly asked if Joe would
like a piece.
"Pi," said Joe, evincing some confu-
sion, "3.141592653589793 . . . .?"
When I finally got it stopped, Joe
wanted to know whether the piece I
had offered was rational or irrational
Thus we see a few of the problems
that might still exist if one could speak
to computers vocally, in the English lan-
guage.
However, the problem is not that
simple at the present time, primarily be-
cause computers are so exceedingly sim-
ple. The English language has some
400,000 words built from twenty-six
letters plus some two dozen special sym-
bols (punctuation marks and numbers
etc.) plus the capitals of all the letters.
Even then, some of the words have up-
wards of forty different meanings.
A modern high-speed electronic digi-
tal computer can understand only a few
hundred different words, at most, and
these are built from exactly two letters,
which we may call "0" and "1." The
reason for this notation will come later.
Even these few words, all of which are
commands may be broken down into
combinations of the dozen or so simple
things that a computer can actually do.
One of these things that a computer
can do is add two numbers. "Easy as
adding two and two," you say. A com-
puter can't add that high; the best it can
do is one and one, and then the answer
Mr. Karpinski, who was a jun-
ior in math when last in school,
has taken off a semester to devote
to reading, writing and catching up
on life. He is often seen speeding
around campus on a motorbike,

and stamp and coin collecting. Re-
cently, he took first prize in the

Other commands that it can obey involve
such things as: "put this number there,"
i.e. store quotient in location 4357, or
"if the result is positive, obey the com-
mand in location 1775."
"How, then, can computers be faster
than people?" you say. Easy, they can
do perhaps 40,000 of the simple opera-
tions, like multiplying two ten digit
numbers per second. And so, you see

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


"super-fast super-idiots."
Even then, each of these operations
requires a separate command. And writ-
ing thousands of commands for each
second that the computer was to be in
use, would be no simple chore.
This time there are several solutions
to the problem. One is the sharing plan
for programs, whereby each program
which is developed for a problem that
many people may want to solve is dis-
tributed to the others on a cooperative
basis. Another is called the sub-program
or sub-routine which is a little program
U3f[f *']/50
In English: Compute and type out the
logarithm to the base e of the average
of the values X, through X60. (This is
to be done for one set of fifty numbers,
about which we know nothing.)
Since one cannot compute the log of
a negative number, we need some sort of
a check to see that the result of the aver-
age is positive. In order to make sure we
catch all of these possible goofs, and
just to make the plan fairly clear before

for a little task. Usually, several dozen
of these are readily available for things
like finding a square root or a logarithm
of a number, or pi or the sine of an
angle. This generally means that some
of the difficult parts of the program are
already taken care of.
The third, and by far the most impor-
tant part of the solution, is that one can
put a "loop" into the program. Almost
all of the problems that digital computers
solve, have large parts that are repeti-
tious and must be done over ten or 100
or even 10,000 times, with slightly dif-
ferent data. The essential characteristic
of this is a command which effectively
says, "Now go back and start over again."
Perhaps, this would be the place to
give an example of a fairly simple actual
program. This is one designed for the
Bendix G-15 and incorporates both loops
and sub-routines.
The problem: Compute and type
we start, let us make a "flow diagram"
or general chart of the operations.
Let us consider that the computer has
1,000 storage spaces, numbered from 1
to 1,000, and each of these may hold ei-
ther a command or a number. Also there
is a special place, sometimes several,
where adding, subsracting, and so forth
take place. This we shall call the accu-
mulator.
Now, we shall leave the first hun-
dred spaces for commands and inciden-
tals and load our sets of fifty numbers
into spaces 101 to 150.
Program
Preliminary: load data into 101 to 150.
Load in program.
Load "50" into location Z5.
1. Add the number in 101 into Accu-
mulator.
2. Add one to the location in 1.
3. If the location number in 1 is great-
er than 150 then go on to the com-

If this program were actually run, it
would take less time than it would take
you to say my first name. And you will
notice that the machine operations out-
number the commands by more than 10
to one.
Note that the first three commands
constitute a loop and are performed in
sequence fifty times. The second com-
mand and the first part of the third
guarantee that the computer will even-
tually get out of the loop and go on.
Otherwise, most computers have a little
device to tell them that they're stuck and
will eventually quit. But that is discourag-
ing to the operator.
Also the 4, 5, 6 sequence is a neces-
sary precaution against having the com-
puter try to find the log of zero or ,i
negative number.
The subroutine in command 9 is stored
somewhere else in the computer and may
be 25 or 30 commands long in itself.
Naturally, the commands wouldn't or-
dinarily be written out as they are above,
but rather in numbers. For humans the
numbers would be the usual decimal vari-

SCIENCE AND MUSIC
The application of modern science has revealed
many interesting facts and unexpected applica-
tions for the universal language.
by BRYAN R. R. WHIPPLE
Editor-in-Chief
Science and music are two fields that
don't have very much association
with one another in our everyday think-
ing In fact, they seem almost as if oppo-
site poles. Science is considered rigid,
mathematical, and subject to logical
thought and inquiry. Music is custom-
arily thought of in more artistic, aesthetic
ways.
However, these two fields have an
enormous amount in common. In this
article we will examine a few of these
very interesting similarities. First, there
are the scientific attributes of music.
Music is a collection of sounds, and
sound is one of the major topics of phys-
ics. Mechanics is closely connected with
the design of instruments with which
musical sounds are created. Electronics
has become very essential to music lately
for the preservation and reproduction ot
musical performances. What is more,
music can be analyzed mathematically,
and significant patterns such as rhythm,
tonality, and thematic development can
be shown to follow more or less rigid
patterns. Finally, these mathematical
characteristics of music are being em-
ployed in conjunction with computing
machines literally to compose musical
works.
Second, there are the musical attributes
of science. Many of the machines and
devices of science produce near-musical
sounds in operation. The sounds of
sports-car racing and of steam locomo-
tives have been recorded and are listened
to by devotees in exactly the same way
that other forms of music are. These
sounds have been used as the basis of
more customary instrumental musical
compositions, as well. An example is
Arthur Honegger's "Pacific 231," a quite
listenable orchestral composition based on
the total effect derived from hearing and
watching a steam-propelled passenger
train. Science and music find additional
common ground in the industrial use of
background music as an aid to produc-
tion. Finally, it has been the author's
observation that a very large proportion
of scientifically-minded persons are also
lovers of music. (Perhaps this is a sec-
ondary condition brought about by in-
terest in hi-fi equipment, but I am always
surprised at the large number of techni-
cal and scientific people I recognize in
the audiences at concerts here.)
Physics of Sound
Before we consider music itself, we
should touch briefly upon the subject of
sound, the raw material of music. When
air is set in vibration at any rate within
the audible range (about 40 to 16,000
cycles per second) sound is produced.
We will ignore the philosophical ques-
tions such as whether sound exists if
there is no one to hear, etc. Common
methods for producing sound, a form
of energy, from other forms of energy
are well known. Usually a force is ap-
plied and released upon an elastic body.
Oscillatory distortions begin to pulse
through the disturbed body at a rate
determined by its configuration and con-
dition of stress. These distortions con-
tinue until elastic hysteresis within the
body, or external conditions, absorb the
energy imparted by the disturbing force.
If the body is immersed in a fluid me-
dium such as air, part of the energy will
be transferred to this medium as sound
waves, essentially alternate rarefications
and compressions of the medium's par-
ticles. These waves move concentrically
outward at a speed determined by the
medium's temperature (most directly)
and obeying the inverse-square law of
intensity (approximately). These waves
can be reflected in a manner similar to
water waves, causing reverberations and
echoes, and can be focused, causing loud
and dead spots.
Loudness, Pitch, Tone
Loudness, pitch, and tone are three
properties of every sound wave. Loud-
ness obviously refers to the intensity or
amplitude of the wave, and is an index
of the energy content of waves in a giv-
en medium. Pitch refers to the frequency
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the alternating rarefactions and compres-
sions of the medium. Tone is a much
more difficult to define attribute of a
sound wave. In acoustics, tone refers to
the regularity of the sound wave from
the standpoint of loudness and pitch.
The more regular a sound wave is in
these respects, the greater its tonality; a
sound with fluctuating, random loud-
ness and pitch has less tonality. Tone
might be thought of musically as an
index to the degree to which a sound
is removed from being mere noise.
Musical instruments are designed to
have a high degree of tonality in their
sounds. It is this requirement that dic-
tates the peculiar appearances and great
care in the construction of musical in-
struments. Another very important as-
pect of tonality from the musical stand-
point is the producttion of sounds which
are, in frequency, exact multiples of the
basic frequency. It is the relative propor-
tions of these overtones in the sound of
musical instruments that lends the var-
ious instruments their individuality. Over-
tones make it possible to distinguish a
high "C" played on a violin from the
same note as generated by an oboe.
Now let's look at some of the more
common sources of sounds. The organ,
piano, and harp have the widest useful
frequency range. These cover the audio
spectrum from about 16 to 4000 cycles.
In addition, these instruments produce
relatively strong first overtones, which
means that when the highest note on a

sound is produced simultaneously.
Percussion instruments, such as drums,
tend to set up waves in which the pres-
sure differences are the greatest, giving
waves of very high intensity. The funda-
mental frequencies of these instruments
are usually low, but they produce rela-
tively large amounts of very high over-
tones. These are very necessary for sharp-
ness and clarity of sound from the per-
cussion group.

Human Speech as Sound
No discussion of the sources of sound
would be complete without looking at
one of the most useful, wonderful, and
complex sound sources of all, the human
voice. It would be easy indeed to rhap-
sodize at length on the beauty and ap-
peal of which the human voice is cap-
able, but our space is limited and it is
likely that we might confuse the message
content of speech with the sound itself.
In singing, the widest range of fun-
damental frequencies normally achieved,
bass to soprano, is approximately from
64 to 1200 cycles. Of course, many over-
tones are present in singing, and it is
the peculiar mixture of these overtones
used by a given singer in a given passage
that conveys the emotional content of
the song. This quality of the singing
voice is called timbre.
The basic phonetic division of the
sounds of speech is into two classes of
sound-bits, the vowels and the conso-
nants. The number in each group varies
between languages for two reasons. Some
languages are more discriminating about
pronunciation habits, and make very fine
distinctions between similar sounds, giv-
ing the speaker little latitude, while in
other languages, minor variations in pro-
nunciation go unnoticed. Obviously, the
number of sounds separately recognized
is not dependent upon the number of
letters, e.g. the several sounds for which
each English vowel and some consonants

language may be unknown to the speak-
ers of another tongue. Speakers of Eng-
lish have difficulty with the umlaut vow-
els of German. The consonant sound
"th" is common in only a few languages,
including English, Icelandic, and Greek.
Consonants and Vowels
Vowels are the speech sounds which
require the use of the vocal cords. Vowel
sounds can be held for an indefinite
length of time. Consonant sounds nor-
mally are formed without the use of the
vocal cords, and many of them (the "plo-
MliWwlC* TIW CMWOT1C)
This is the portion of the audio spec-
trum which telephone engineers have
found to be most important for the eco-
nomical and accurate transmission of in-
telligence. Extension of this range would
make telephone speech sound more nat-
ural, but is not worth the cost from the
standpoint of intelligibility.
Consonant sounds have basic frequen-
cies covering a larger range—200 up to
an occasional 8000 cps. This is why a
telephonic "s" is little more than a rough
hiss.
Women are more difficult to under-
stand than men, from the standpoint of

sive" sounds p, b, t, k, etc.) cannot be
sustained. The "fricative" consonants (v,
z, s, etc.) can be sustained, however,
Consonants may additionally be categor-
ized by the region of the mouth in which
they are mainly formed (labial, alveolar,
dental, etc.), or as to whether they are
voiced or unvoiced (g, z, v, are voiced,
c, s, f are unvoiced).
Vowel sounds are basically pitched in
the lower frequencies—110 to 140 cycles
—but they have so many higher over-
tones that they are still highly intelligible
when the fundamentals are totally sup-
pressed. Telephone equipment, for ex-
ample, is designed to reproduce sounds
in the range from 250 to 2500 cycles.
speech, at least. This is due to the lesser
number of tones in a woman's voice,
which provides fewer stimuli to the au-
ditory membranes. The difficulty is most
pronounced with the more complex
consonants.
The physiological mechanism by which
sound waves are changed into neural im-
pulses in the inner ear is not well un-
derstood. It is assumed that the reader
is familiar with the basic structure of
the ear, with its drum, chain of ossicles,
and fluid-filled canals. A diagram is re-
produced with this article.
While the usual usable auditory range
is about 40 to 16000 cycles, two pheno-
mena in connection with this are impor-
tant. First, ability to hear very high-
pitched sounds is often lost with age,
even though hearing in the normal range
is unimpaired. For example, children can
often hear the high squeal emitted by
TV receivers due to stray coupling be-
tween the horizontal-deflection circuits
(15,750 cps.) and the audio section.
Most adults cannot hear this squeal, al-
though it may be responsible for many
of the headaches that televiewers have.
The second phenomenon is the Fletch-
er-Munson pitch sensitivity variation. It
has been shown experimentally that a
sound wave must have higher intensity
in order to have a given apparent loud-
ness to human observers if it is either
higher or lower than the middle ranges.
In fact, the sensitivity curves for the hu-
man ear show a great many points of
relative maximum or minimum sensitivity
even within the middle ranges.
Randomness and Order
Before tackling the subject of music at
greater length, let us examine the ex-
tremes of randomness and order in sound
The most highly ordered, specific sound
is that of the pure sine wave without
overtones, and of constant amplitude.
Nearly pure sounds are generated by
electronic tone generators alone, and
these must b; carefully designed. The
Naval Observatory radio station, WWV,
broadcasts such tones on 2.5, 5, 10, etc.
megacycles. They broadcast a 440-cycle
tone for tuning musical instruments
(high A in philharmonic pitch) and a
600-cycle tone for the regulation of 60-
cycle electrical generating stations.
At the opposite extreme is random
noise, the hodgepodge mixture of all
tones, intensities, and durations. This
sounds to the ear like a pure hissing
sound. As with white light, which is all
the colors taken together, the individual
tones are not discernible. For this rea-
son, this is called "white noise." A good
source of white noise is a hum-free hi-
fi set, turned up to full volume with
no input connected. The hissing noise
heard in the speaker is generated by the
random motion of electrons in the com-
ponents, especially the tubes. These ran-
dom currents are amplified as though
they were desired signals, and are deliv-
ered via the speaker.
For purposes of this discussion, we can
now define music. Our definition is not
the broadest one possible, but it is more
all-inclusive than traditional opinions as
to "what is music." Music is a succession

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Is your future up in the air?
As the communications needs of our nation become steadily
greater and more complex, the Bell Telephone System is
continuing its pioneer work in microwave by "taking to the
air" more and more to get the word across.
To this end. Western Electric — the manufacturing arm
of the Bell System — has the monumental task of producing
a large part of the microwave transmission equipment that
knits our country together by shrinking thousands of miles
into mere seconds.
In spite of its great technological strides, the science of
radio relay is a rapidly-changing one. And new break-
throughs and advances are common occurrences. A case in
point: our Bell System "TH" Microwave Radio Relay. This
newest development in long-distance telephone transmis-
sion will eventually triple the present message-carrying
capacity of existing long-haul radio relay installations. A
full-scale system of 6 working and 2 protection channels can
handle 11,000 telephone messages at the same time.
To make microwave work takes a host of special equip-
ment and components: relay towers, antennae, waveguides,
traveling wavetubes, transistors, etc. But just as important,
it takes top-caliber people to help us broaden our horizons
into such exciting new areas as communication by satellites!
And microwave is only part of Western Electrics oppor-
tunity story. We have—right now—hundreds of challenging
and rewarding positions in virtually all areas of telephony,
as well as in development and building of defense communi-
cations and missile guidance systems for the Government.
So, if your future is "up in the air," you owe it to your
career to see "what's up" for you at Western Electric.
Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, industrial, civil and
chemical engineers, as well as physical science, liberal arts, and
business majors. For more information, get your copy of "Western

SCUBA DIVING
Many of the basic sciences play critical roles in
governing man's ability to live under water.
by AL MARSHALL
Ten years ago, the word "Aqua-Lung"
was known to a small minority of
people. Today it is not uncommon to
see a group of SCUBA divers invade
any body of water the year around.
Underwater diving is of three types,
skin diving, deep sea diving and SCUBA
diving. Skin diving is by far the oldest
of the three and requires the least equip-
ment. At most, this equipment consists of
a face mask, swim fins and a snorkel
tube. Deep sea diving, on the other hand,
is the most elaborate of the three. This
equipment consists of a spun copper hel-
met and rubberized canvas suit in addi-
tion to an air hose, telephone and hoist-
ing cable to the surface. Fully dressed the
deep sea diver often weighs in excess of
300 pounds. Thus, his mobility below
the surface is greatly limited. SCUBA
diving is the most recent member of the
diving family. This type of diving uti-
lizes portable cylinders of compressed
air as its underwater breathing device.
A compressed air cylinder and regulator
are all that are absolutely essential to
SCUBA diving, but the face mask and
swim fins are almost a necessity for vision
and mobility.
Diving, as such, originated from the
pearl diver. Although he could dive to
great depths, he was dependent on his
lung capacity for the duration of his stay
underwater. The next significant step in
diving was the invention of the deep sea
diving suit by Augustus Siebe in 1837.
It was not until World War II that the
SCUBA or Self Contained Underwater
Breathing Apparatus method of diving
made its debut. This was the original
"Aqua-Lung" developed and produced
by J. Y. Cousteau and Emile Cognan.
It soon found its way into the U.S. Navy
frogmen units and is now on the public
market.
The technical approach to the sport
of SCUBA diving can be divided into
basically two areas: 1) the mechanics of
SCUBA gear; and 2) the mechanics and
physiology of diving.
Mechanics of SCUBA Gear
The face mask, swim fins and weight
belt give the diver vision, propulsion and
aquatic equilibrium, respectively. The
high pressure air cylinder requires closer
consideration. There are many sizes of
high pressure cylinders in use, but the
most common are the 71.2 cubic foot
tank with a working pressure of 2250
psi. The 71.2 cubic 2 foot tank is
the standard one hour tank used by
most sport divers. The 38 cubic foot
tank is generally used by women or as a
training unit. (Due to the dangerously
high pressures in these cylinders, the
Federal Interstate Commerce Commis-
sion requires that they be tested every
five years at a pressure far above their
rated capacity. A tank of 2250 psi would
be tested at pressures near 4000 psi.)
Air is released from the tank through
a high pressure valve. This is more than
a simple valve, however, since it retains
a constant pressure of reserve air for
the diver. These reserve valves are gen-
rally of two types, the constant air re-
serve and the automatic air reserve. The
constant air reserve is a mechanical valve
which acts as an obstruction in the valve
opening when the pressure falls below
a certain predetermined level. This is
usually 300-500 psi for a single tank.
The diver may release this valve by pull-
ing a lever, thus allowing himself the
extra amount of air to surface. The auto-
matic reserve valve operates on a depth
compensation basis. As the diver goes
to a greater depth a proportional amount
of air is held in reserve. Reserve air will
only be released to the diver as he as-
cends and the pressure of the water
around him decreases. The disadvantage
of this type of reserve is that it will not
allow the diver to descend after he be-
gins to surface.
The demand regulator reduces the
high pressure of the cylinder to a pres-
sure equal to the hydyrostatic pressure
at a given depth then gives the diver
this pressurized air according to his res-
piratory demands. The amount and pres-
sure of air released is then a function of
the diver's depth and respiration.
Regulators are also of two basic types,
single stage and double stage. The single
stage regulator reduces the cylinder pres-
sure of 1800-2250 psi to a working
breathing pressure then supplies the div-
er with this air in a single operation. The
double stage first lowers the cylinder pres-
sure then feeds it to the diver through a
separate diaphragm system. There are
many variations of the two types of
regulators, but again they fall into either
double or single hose arrangements. In
the double hose version, intake air is
carried through one hose and the ex-
haust air is relieved through the other
and released to the water at the regula-
tor. A simple valve in the mouthpiece
coordinates the intake and exhaust hoses.
In the single hose variety, air is taken in
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


directly into the water through the mouth-
piece. A myriad of other accessories
are also available ranging from depth
gauges and protective rubber suits to
underwater cameras.
Mechanics and Physiology of Diving
Most mechanics and physiological ef-
fects of diving can be traced to three
fundamental gas laws, Boyle's Law, Dal-
ton's Law and Henry's Law. These laws
briefly state that the volume of a gas at a
constant temperature is inversely propor-
tional to the pressure (Boyle's Law),
that the total pressure of several gases
which do not combine chemically is equal
to the sum of the partial pressure of the
gases (Dalton's Law), and that the
weight of a dissolved gas is proportional
to the partial pressure on it (Henry's
Law).
At sea level a person experiences 1
atmosphere of pressure or about 14.7
pounds per square inch on every part
of his body. At 33 feet below the surface
of the water this pressure is doubled and
at 66 feet the pressure is about 45 psi or
3 atmospheres. With these gas laws and
the pressure of the water in operation,
some of the physiological effects on the
diver are unique. Since the regulator
renders air to the diver at the same pres-
sure as the surrounding water, there is no
restriction or difficulty in breathing. Open
sinuses likewise, will fill with compressed
air and the pressure difference will be
compensated for. If they are congested
by a cold or allergy this pressure cannot
be easily equalized and it is not advis-
able to dive. The ears are another trou-
ble spot for pressure and equalization.
The middle ear is connected to the
throat by means of a canal called the Eus-
tachian Tube, which is designed to act
as a simple valve. This tube is easily
closed by an increase of pressure in the
throat region. Since water pressure is
acting on the exterior eardrum, pain will
be felt when the eardrum is deflected
into the middle ear where the pressure
is lower. This can be corrected by swal-
lowing and equalizing the pressure in
the middle ear. This same phenomenon
is experienced on a fast moving elevator.
There are certain limitations estab-
lished by these gas laws which cannot be
violated. For example the effect of pres-
surizing the body works in reverse when
returning to the surface. Assuming a
diver would not exhale rising from a 33
foot depth, his lungs would burst long
before he reached the surface, since the
volume of air in his lungs would be-
double that at 33 feet. Of course this is
an exaggerated example, but the same
effect results from holding the breath for
even a short period during ascent. This
overexpansion of air in the lungs is
called air embolism, which is sometimes
fatal. A variation of this injury is air
embolism of the tissues, properly titled
subcutaneous emphysema. In the latter
case, it is the air contained in the tissues
not in the bloodstream which overex-
pands. Divers avoid this condition by
controlling their breathing during ascent.
Probably the most notorious of the
divers' ailments is the "bends" or cias-
son disease. The bends are caused by
gaseous nitrogen which is dissolved in
the bloodstream during the dive then re-
leased upon rapid ascent to a region of
lower pressure. A slow ascent will
allow the nitrogen to escape through the
lungs by normal respiration. This is in
complete agreement with Henry's Law.
Nitrogen bubbles released in the blood-
stream can cause circulation blockage or
local tissue destruction and may ulti-
mately cause permanent paralysis or
death.
"Rapture of the Depths" or nitrogen
narcosis is another phenomenon encoun-
tered by the diver. At a depth of 140
feet or lower, a diver's ability to think
and his coordination become impaired.
It is believed that this is also caused by
nitrogen in the bloodstream which in-
duces a narcotic effect. This is dangerous
only in that it reduces the diver's reflexes
and faculties. It can be avoided by sim-
ply not diving to this depth or using a
special gaseous mixture. This theory is
disputed by Hannes Keller, who recently
made two record SCUBA dives. He says
that there is no such thing as nitrogen
narcosis, but that this feeling is brought
on by a concentration of carbon dioxide
in the blood mixed with oxygen under
high pressure. Recently an oxygen-helium
mixture has been used for deep and
lengthy dives. Helium has been used in
the place of nitrogen due to its inert
chemical properties.
Recent Advancements
Keller, a Swiss mathematician, devised
a different time-depth table for various
mixtures of gases. He used the IBM 650
computer to calculate more than 400 de-
compression tables to depths of 1312
feet. On August 21, 1959, he used the
new tables to make a record dive of 510
feet without pressure equipment. The
dive took only four minutes on the de-
scent and only 30 minutes coming up.
The presently used decompression tables
would require a five to seven hour ascent.
The French Naval authorities became in-
terested in his work and under their su-
pervision he made another record dive
of 820 feet on November 4, I960. The
decompression took only 49 minutes us-
ing his new tables and methods. Nor-
mally this dive would have taken eight
hours for ascent.
SCUBA diving as no other sport, is de-
pendent on physical laws and good
judgement. But like no other sport, it
offers exploration and adventure in a
yet little known part of the world.

Language Machine
Three University of Michigan students
have passed the world's first completely
automated college spoken language
course with flying colors. All received
"A"s from a professor they never saw
in class.
Taught completely by machine, the
U-M trio learned to speak Spanish like
natives in less than 200 hours. Normally,
this would require at least four semesters'
work in traditional method, according to
F. Rand Morton, director of the U-M
Language Laboratory and designer of the
unique audio-lingual teaching machine.
The machine taught students are: Larry
Smith, a junior, 311 Garfield, Charle-
voix; Adrian Palmer, a senior, 227 Or-
chard Hills Dr., Ann Arbor; and Wil-
liam McNaughton, a senior, 2740 Pack-
ard Rd., ,Ann Arbor.
The U-M student trio are among the
first experimental subjects for a language
development project now under way at
the U-M. Although several students
have tested particular segments of the
automated course, only three have been
exposed to its entirety. In the future
all language learning may be accomp-
lished along similar lines, if future
experimental work is as successful. The
teaching machine is a new concept
in education and most likely will revolu-
tionize education in the next 10 years.
How does the "automated" course
work?
The student learns to speak Spanish
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


would. He settles himself in an individ-
ual "learning" booth with his machine
"teacher." He simply dials a number on
a telephone-like control to select his les-
son. Now he's tuned in to a bank of
continuously playing tape recordings of
specially prepared teaching materials.
The "teacher" presents material in
small easy segments, which the student
learns by repetition. Then the machine
questions the student, making sure each
question is correctly answered before go-
ing on to the next. It allows the student
to teach himself at his own speed.
For example, in learning how to form
the plural in English, the student would
first drill himself on the "s," "z," and
"ez" sounds. The machine would then
teach him through short drills when to
use each sound. Finally, it would make
the correct use of these sounds a "habit."
Once a student has learned a segment in
this way he is unlikely to forget it or
make a mistake.
This, however, puts the three students
at a disadvantage in competing with tra-
ditionally trained third or fourth semes-
ter students. While they can speak and
understand Spanish remarkably well, they
have been trained neither to read nor
to write the language nor to analyze it
with grammatical rules. But reading and
writing the language will be eventually
taught in the same way.
Another student, who took part in the
experimental course learned French in
the traditional method and Spanish with
the teaching machine. He found the ma-
chine considerably easier.
The third student, a senior majoring
in economics, has decided to do gradu-
ate work in linguistics because of the
interest aroused by the course.
Spanish, Russian, and Thai are the
languages now being programmed for
"machine instruction" under the con-
tract. Others will follow after more ex-
perimentation.
New Department
There are at least 500 oceanography
jobs going begging in the United States
—and only a baker's dozen of U.S.
schools to fill them.
The University of Michigan, surround-
ed by the vast water resources of the
Great Lakes, is preparing to launch a
new graduate program in oceanography
next September. The University of Wis-
consin is the only other Midwestern in-
stitution to offer such training.
Marine science has such a need for
trained personnel that "retread" physi-
cists and mathematicians are being
pressed into duty, according to John C.
Ayers (Ph.D.), oceanographer with the
Great Lakes Research Division (GLRD)
of the U-M Institute of Science and
Technology.
Future employment in all aspects of
oceanography is promising, since research
envisioned for the next 10 years will re-
quire twice the existing number of quali-
fied marine scientists. The armed forces
are looking for 90 marine scientists to
work in Washington right now.
One reason for the present shortage
is that until World War II it was almost
impossible to obtain formal training in
oceanography, and nearly all profession-
als entered the field from one or another
of the sciences.
The study of all aspects of waterbod-
ies, the earth of their basins, and the air
above them is a rich field for intellectual
activity which as such is allowed to es-
cape the attention of most students pass-
ing through our universities and colleges.
Oceanographers generally have come
into the field through study of such re-
lated sciences as ecology, meteorology,
geology, hydraulics and, perhaps closest
of all, limnology.
The very recent increased importance
of the seas in national defense, in utili-
zation of marine resources, and in ques-
tions of disposal of radioactive wastes,
has brought home plainly our lack of
adequate understanding of the seas. The
University of Michigan will base its
new graduate program in oceanography
upon the facilities of several depart-
ments. Dr. Ayers is chairman of the
inter-departmental committee.
The U-M program will emphasize gen-
eral scientific training, intensive train-
ing in one of the areas of oceanography,
and at least one semester of marine ex-
perience at an approved coastal oceano-
graphic institution.
The field of research will center upon
obtaining an understanding of the
world's oceans, lakes and streams; and of
the organisms, processes and boundary
conditions operative in salt and fresh
waters, as well as in the sediments and
the atmosphere above.

U-M students learn to speak Spanish like natives in less than 200 hours with this
teaching machine. These students demonstrate the specially constructed
"package programs" which they administer to themselves.

can't understand such advanced things.
So before anything can get into the com-
puter at all, it must be put into binary-
form, on paper tape, IBM cards or mag-
netic tape.
Now is the time to explain the 0, 1
notation. On a paper tape or card, a 1
is a hole in the correct spot, and a O
is no hole. On magnetic tape or magnetic
drum storage a 1 is a charged spot and
a 0 no charge.
One of the big technical problems
with computers is this business of hav-
ing to use all the information. It cannot
guess at a word from the context. If it
misses a single hole or magnetically
charged spot in hundreds of thousands
or millions of individual operations, it
may invalidate the entire result.
Still, even though talking to a com-
puter may be somewhat difficult, and
getting correct results requires constant
attention to the operation of the machine
and to details, computers are somewhat
helpful on occasion. And besides, it is
a challenge.

SCIENCE AND MUSIC
(Continued from page 16)
of sounds so constructed as to convey
some emotional or aesthetic sensation to
the hearer, sufficiently ordered to be in-
telligible, and sufficiently random to be
interesting.
From this point we could proceed to
declare that music is customarily intended
to be produced by combinations of some
fifty types of instruments; that it obeys
certain structural rules governing the se-
lection of pitches to be employed simul-
taneously, and so forth. However, musi-
cal experimentalists are currently rolling
back the restrictions in the direction of
the definition we have given.
Musical Structure
Since most of the world's music was,
and still is, written in obeisance to tra-
ditional rules, we should examine a few
of them. Most are too technical for
lengthy explanation.
When two tones are heard simulta-
neously, the effect can either be pleasant
or unpleasant. The reasons are psycholog-
ical, but are related to physical proper-
ties': the ratio between the pitches of the
tones. Musical scales and systems of
chords have been developed around com-
binations of tones and pitches which ap-
peal to the ear.
Rhythm is another attribute of music
that can be analyzed scientifically. The
metric patterns of music that are most
enjoyable to the human ear seem to be
those that are similar to the rhythms of
nature—the gallop of a horse, the beat
of a heart, steps of naturalistic dances.
Composers who have experimented with
highly strange or irregular metric schemes
have not found their work particularly
acceptable to the majority of listeners.
Chords, melody, and their interplay in
musical compositions follow more or less
definite patterns of development: repeti-
tion, echoing, inversion, and so forth.
These are the techniques known as fugue,
counterpoint, inversion, interchange, can-
on, and complement. The reader who is
interested in a more detailed description
of these techniques is referred to (1) in
the bibliography; suffice it to say here
that these are rather specific techniques
used by composers to make their music
more understandable by increasing the
degree of orderliness at the expense of
randomness. The works of early compos-
ers such as J. S. Bach exemplify the ef-

What is it? The American Institute of Chemical Engineers has defined chemical engineering in a con-
cise manner as "the application of the principles of the physical sciences, together with the principles of
economics and human relations, to fields that pertain to processes and process equipment in which matter
is treated to effect a change in state, energy content, or composition." The work of the chemical engineer
encompasses many industries from the manufacture of chemicals, foods, and drugs, and the refining and
processing of petroleum, ores, wood, and plants, to the preparation and extraction of energy from nuclear
fuels, and the chemicals, propellants, and human fuel problems of space technology.
The education of the chemical engineer is based on certain functional operations that are similar re-
gardless of the particular industry or process in which they are employed. Examples of these operations are
the flow of fluids, the transfer of heat, the diffusion and transport of matter, and the reactions of chemical
compounds. For example, in the above photograph a graduate student is determining heat transfer character-
istics of tubes with spiral fins. Such graduate research prepares one to be a leader in the future development
of chemical engineering.
Traditionally, chemical engineering has led all the engineering fields in the proportion of students who
take advanced training to further progress in the field. Do not take chemical engineering if you prefer a field
that is calm and stagnant. If you want a dynamic field and if you like chemistry along with physics and
mathematics, check with the program adviser in chemical engineering. He will gladly introduce you to this
area of professional work where the job opportunities are literally unlimited.

SCIENCE AND MUSIC
(Continued from page 26)
feet of strict application of formulistic
techniques such as these. Who can say-
that this use of near-mathematical rigor
to certain aspects of the musical art has
lessened the appeal of the product?
Automatic Composition
Since music is, indeed, a mixture ot
order and randomness, it can in theory
be devised by computing machines whose
circuits generate random ideas and then
apply certain learned criteria to them. By
programming the machine with instruc-
tions to piece notes together at will, and
then discard the portions which would
be unpleasant, certain rudimentary pieces
of "music" can be composed. By slant-
ing the set of rules given the machine
toward the idiom of a given composer,
his work can be imitated. Of course, the
amount of information the computer
would have to be fed in order to test all
its ideas for acceptibility, and to develop
these themes in a reasonable fashion,
makes the task a very ambitious one.
A group of researchers at the Univer-
sity of Illinois have been experimenting
with computer music for some time.
Their "Illiac" computer has given them a
number of pieces, including the Illiac
suite for string quartet. Listeners who
heard this played (from tape) here at the
U of M recently told me that "parts of
it bordered on being listenable" and
"some of it sounds like regular music."
Apparently the machine is not yet very
proficient nor very consistent. The exper-
imenters claim that they could produce
a 42nd Mozart symphony on their ma-
chine, by feeding in data on all the nat-
ural composer's symphonic work. How-
ever, they admit that it wouldn't be an
outstanding example of Mozart; just a
very ordinary symphony, rather unin-
spired.
Electronic Instruments
The most immediate use for electron-
ics in the music industry is, however, elec-
tronic instruments (aside from reproduc-
tion, of course). Two such devices are
the theremin and the electronic organ.
The theremin is a small device contain-
ing two oscillators, one fixed-frequency
and the other tunable by moving the
hand above a capacitor plate mounted
atop it. The difference betwween the
two frequencies is a beat-note in the
audible range; it is amplified and brought
through speakers. When a performer
plays his scales on the theremin, he mere-
ly has to raise and lower his hand in the
air above the capacitor plate. The variable
electrostatic coupling does the rest. These
gadgets are used to create the weird sus-
pense music on TV horror programs.
A far more serious electronic instru-
ment is the electric organ. These devices
attempt to reproduce the entire range of
effects available from huge pipe organs at
a fraction of the cost. They contain nu-
merous tone generating circuits, followed
by tone-shaping circuits, designed to em-
phasize various overtones to permit imi-
tative effects corresponding to the stops
on a pipe organ.
Since a loudspeaker is different from
a metal pipe, and a stream of electrons
is not a puff of air, the success has been
limited. However, the organs have be-
come quite popular in small churches
and homes. Special vibrato effects, me-
chanically induced, help the realism.
In order to cover the relation between
science and music completely, we would
have to include a section on the repro-
duction and storage of music. However,
since this is a vast subject, and one about
which many readers already know, I will
mention only that the science of record-
ing and broadcasting has virtually revo-
lutionized music. Once the plaything of
nobles, church choirs, and a few wander-
ing performers, music has stepped into
the everyday life of all. In fact, it is an
annoyance that one cannot escape in pub-
lic places, such as offices, restaurants, and
stores. In this respect, the popularization
of music by science is of dubious benefit.
However, I find it necessary to forgive
technology in this instance—for where
would a man be, could he not drop back
into his easychair at the end of a tough
day, and be enchanted back into being
by the art of Bach, the force of Beetho-
ven, or the mirth of Shostakovich?

Already engineers working with
nuclear power have learned that only
utmost purity of materials and metic-
ulous accuracy in manufacture can be
tolerated in a reactor. Steels for the
reactors and reactor vessels are checked
for make-up and molecular structure
with photomicrography and x-ray dif-
fraction. Welds are proved sound and
moderators flawless with radiography.
And stresses likely to occur are studied
in advance with photo-elastic stress
analysis.
In this new-day industry, as in any
field on which you set your sights,
photography plays a part in making a
better product, in producing it easier,
in selling it faster. It cuts costs and
saves time all along the line.
So, in whatever you plan to do, take
full advantage of all the ways photog-
raphy can help.

One of a se
ries
Q. Mr. Savage, should young engineers
join professional engineering socie-
ties?
A. By all means. Once engineers
have graduated from college
they are immediately "on the
outside looking in," so to speak,
of a new social circle to which
they must earn their right to be-
long. Joining a professional or
technical society represents a
good entree.
Q. How do these societies help young
engineers?
A. The members of these societies
—mature, knowledgeable men—
have an obligation to instruct
those who follow after them.
Engineers and scientists—as pro-
fessional people—are custodians
of a specialized body or fund of
knowledge to which they have
three definite responsibilities.
The first is to generate new
knowledge and add to this total
fund. The second is to utilize
this fund of knowledge in service
to society. The third is to teach
this knowledge to others, includ-
ing young engineers.
Q. Specifically, what benefits accrue
from belonging to these groups?
A. There are many. For the young
engineer, affiliation serves the
practical purpose of exposing his
work to appraisal by other scien-
tists and engineers. Most impor-
tant, however, technical societies
enable young engineers to learn
of work crucial to their own.
These organizations are a prime
source of ideas — meeting col-
leagues and talking with them,
reading reports, attending meet-
ings and lectures. And, for the
young engineer, recognition of
his accomplishments by asso-
ciates and organizations gener-
ally heads the list of his aspira-
tions. He derives satisfaction
from knowing that he has been
identified in his field.
Interview with General Electric's
Charles F. Savage
Consultant—Engineering Professional Relations
How Professional Societies
Help Develop Young Engineers
Q. What contribution is the young en-
gineer expected to make as an ac-
tive member of technical and pro-
fessional societies?
A. First of all, he should become
active in helping promote the
objectives of a society by prepar-
ing and presenting timely, well-
conceived technical papers. He
should also become active in
organizational administration.
This is self-development at work,
for such efforts can enhance the
personal stature and reputation
of the individual. And, I might
add that professional develop-
ment is a continuous process,
starting prior to entering col-
lege and progressing beyond
retirement. Professional aspira-
tions may change but learning
covers a person's entire life span.
And, of course, there are dues to
be paid. The amount is grad-
uated in terms of professional
stature gained and should al-
ways be considered as a personal
investment in his future.
Q. How do you go about joining pro-
fessional groups?
A. While still in school, join student
chapters of societies right on
campus. Once an engineer is out
working in industry, he should
contact local chapters of techni-
cal and professional societies, or
find out about them from fellow
engineers.
Q. Does General Electric encourage par-
ticipation in technical and profes-
sional societies?
A. It certainly does. General Elec-
tric progress is built upon cre-
ative ideas and innovations. The
Company goes to great lengths
to establish a climate and in-
centive to yield these results.
One way to get ideas is to en-
courage employees to join pro-
fessional societies. Why? Because
General Electric shares in recog-
nition accorded any of its indi-
vidual employees, as well as the
common pool of knowledge that
these engineers build up. It can't
help but profit by encouraging
such association, which sparks
and stimulates contributions.
Right now, sizeable numbers of
General Electric employees, at
all levels in the Company, belong
to engineering societies, hold re-
sponsible offices, serve on work-
ing committees and handle im-
portant assignments. Many are
recognized for their outstanding
contributions by honor and
medal awards.
These general observations em-
phasize that General Electric
does encourage participation. In
indication of the importance of
this view, the Company usually
defrays a portion of the expense
accrued by the men involved in
supporting the activities of these
various organizations. Remem-
ber, our goal is to see every man
advance to the full limit of his
capabilities. Encouraging him to
join Professional Societies is one
way to help him do so.

sional Development which you may

One of the most recent applications
of scientific research, the u;e of ultra-
high frequency sound waves is expand-
ing everyday. In her cover, Sherry
Colenso depicts fields in which these
high frequency waves are being used:
in underwater detection, one of the
oldest; and in medicine, one of the
newest. In the last couple of years, ultra-
sonics has been used from the washing
of dishes to the location and treatment
of tumors. In his article, Dave Paul dis-
cusses the phenomenon that makes the
use of these waves possible and the
potentialities of ultrasonics.

In the agricultural equipment field, reputations depend on building
products that can take rough treatment. . . and give real value. To do
it, agricultural equipment manufacturers rely heavily on Malleable
iron castings.
Malleable's excellent ductility and shock resistance mean longer life
and fewer problems than obtainable with fabrications. Low start-up
cost for small quantities also is vitally important in this competitive
industry.
Put more reputation-building quality into your products at less cost

"Tlie £ditot5 Pen —
A great deal has been written in engineering publications,
both student and professional, about the responsibility of the
engineer in areas not directly related to the technical aspects of
his work. The deluge of propaganda urging the young engineer
to "be diverse" begins in college, with the pressure to take a
variety of non-technical electives. It continues into his early
working years, with exhortations from all sides to participate in
community affairs, to develop as a well-rounded individual, and
to become more literate, cultured, and urbane.
Speaking strictly for myself, I believe that well-roundedness
is a very desirable goal. Probably a large majority of engineers
would concur with me. Most of us find our non-technical subjects
interesting, and a relief from the constant procession of labs,
formulas, and slide-rule pushing.
Nonetheless, I know there are many engineering students who
have neither the ability nor the desire to broaden themselves
in this way. Although they will make outstanding engineers, their
inclinations do not tend even in part into the nontechnical.
I defend the right of these men to an education and a job
opportunity where excellence in engineering skills alone is
required. I believe that they ought to be able to earn an engi-
needing degree without the necessity of slogging their way
through countless L S &amp; A courses that leave a lasting impression
only on their grade-point averages. There ought to be an oppor-
tunity for engineers to take nontech subjects, but I wholly disa-
gree with "The Michigan Daily" and others who would make
them mandatory in wholesale quantities.
I take this attitude because I believe an individual should
have maximum freedom of choice in determining his education,
and hence his life. While perhaps there can be no freedom of
choice as to whether an engineer take strength of materials, the
forced inclusion of humanities in his program is unfair to the man
with no interest in them.
Once again, I will repeat that I think it highly desirable for
the engineer to be liberally educated. But how Lit boys and girls
would howl if statics or circuits were prerequisite to their B.A.!
For the same reasons that Lit students don't take our courses, we
ought not have to take theirs.

SPARK MACHINING
Engineering research has created a new meth-
od to accomplish previously expensive or im-
possible machining operations.
by BENSON SHAPIRO
M
This machine, the Easco Die Mafic
powered by Sparcatron, has just
completed the 900 pound forg-
ing die lying flat on the work
table. In front of the finished die
are two of the electrodes used in
the process. The die will be used
for forging connecting rods for
crawler tractor engines.
aking a square hole, machining
tungsten carbide, cutting a honey-
comb of steel, are all difficult jobs to
perform using standard machining meth-
ods. A square hole can be broached, but
it is an expensive and slow process. Ma-
chining hard tungsten carbide is almost
impossible because of the tool wear. Cut-
ting a honeycomb is difficult because the
saw deforms the edges of the kerf as it
cuts.
The answer to these and many other
difficult machining jobs is spark discharge
machining, also known as electro form-
ing, spark erosion machining, and elec-
trical disintegration. All of these names
apply to the same basic process, con-
trolled disintegration of metals by high
power electrical discharge.
Equipment
The machinery used in the process is
theoretically simple, but its design pre-
sents many practical problems. The work-
piece is clamped into a tank which is
mounted on a work table which allows
horizontal movement of the tank and the
enclosed work piece. Above the workpiece
the tool electrode is suspended in a chuck
which is free to move in a vertical direc-
tion. The vertical movement is accomp-
lished by a servo-mechanism consisting
of a controlled motor which drives the
chuck by means of a rack and pinion
drive. The pool is filled with a dielectric
fluid, usually a petroleum derived oil.
The electrode and work piece are con-
nected to the power supply which is a
unit designed to convert normal AC line
current into low voltage, low amperage,
rapid firing discharges. The tool acts as
a negative electrode and the workpiece as
a positive electrode. The tool electrode is
held a very short distance from the work-
piece. They are similar to points in a
spark plug, creating a spark gap. When
the charge gets large enough in a capaci-
tor parallel to the tool and work, the
dielectric fluid between the tool and
work breaks down electrically and a spark
jumps from the tool to the workpiece.
The energy of the discharge melts and
vaporizes the metal of both the tool
and the workpiece, but since the work-
piece is the positive electrode, and re-
ceives the charge it erodes faster than
the negative tool electrode.
The eroded metal is carried away by
the dielectric fluid which is circulated
by a pump and reservoir system. The
metal is separated from the fluid by
filters.
MAY, 1961


CURRENT
CONTROL

WORK
This diagram shows the major parts of the equipment for spark discharge machin-
ing. The major portion of the electrical equipment is used to develop the arc.
The servo controls the movement of the tool.

The rough machining part of the process shown above, accomplishes the major
metal removal. In the next step, fine machining provides the close tolerances
and the finish. The agitation of the fluid is due to its own electrical breakdown
and the vaporization of the workpiece.
The shape eroded into the workpiece
is a complement image of the shape of
the tool electrode. If the tool electrode
is a rectangle, the hole formed in the
workpiece is a rectangle.
Design Considerations
The process is therefore very simple;
sending a spark from a tool electrode to
the workpiece. But, there are several cru-
cial considerations. The gap between tool
and work must be kept constant. This is
where the previously mentioned servo-
mechanism enters. As the gap increases,
the voltage of the spark between the
tool and the workpiece decreases because
of the increased energy needed to break
down the larger amount of dielectric. By
means of a delicate feedback system, the
decrease in voltage is relayed to the servo-
mechanism, actuating it. The servo-mech-
anism then brings the tool electrode
down, thus maintaining a constant gap.
This is a continuous operation.
The current and voltage applied across
the gap must be constant to insure smooth
operation and removal of metal.
The design of the electrode is also of
crucial importance. Since its image is re-
flected in the workpiece, any imperfec-
tions in it will be reproduced. To compli-
cate matters, the tool is constantly erod-
ing, and changing shape. Because of the
field distribution at the tool, wear is
greatest at edges and corners. The tool
must either be designed to compensate
for such wear, or it must be replaced
frequently.
Another problem which occurs rather
frequently in the production of long,
narrow, blind holes is the build up of
large deposits of eroded metal, and other
by-products of the breakdown of the
dielectric. This deposit causes radical
changes in the characteristics of the dis-
charge machining, and hence must be
removed. This is usually done by using
a hollow electrode to bring dielectric
fluid into the area to wash the formations
away.
Applications
There are many uses for spark dis-
charge machining because of its unusual
advantage over other machining meth-
ods. This advantage is the fact that there
is no physical contact between the tool
and the workpiece. This means that the
process can work any type of metal which
conducts electricity. The ability of a metal
to be eroded is not dependent upon its
physical characteristics such as hardness
and brittleness, but upon its electrical

characteristics. It is fortunate indeed, that
many of the hardest metals such as car-
bide alloys are very well suited to this
method of machining because of their
electrical properties.
Metals can be heat treated before ma-
chining and then machined with no fear
of creating internal stresses which might
weaken the metal.
This elimination of contact between
tool and workpiece also means that deli-
cate pieces of metal such as thin electrical
components and honeycombs can be ma-
chined without bending or crushing.
The specific applications are many and
varied. Size is hardly a problem. I have
seen electric discharge machined parts
ranging from tiny electronic components
to metal stamping dies weighing hun-
dreds of pounds.
Some of the more important applica-
tions include the forming of unusually
shaped holes formerly done by broach-
ing such as star shaped and square holes.
The making of metal stamping dies and
molds for plastics is another important
application. The fact that by varying the
current density of the discharge, the
finish on the product can be varied means
that highly finished molds and dies can be
made quickly and easily. Another advan-
tage over usual machining methods is
that unusually shaped dies with fillets and
rounds which are difficult to machine are
easily reproduced by electric discharge
machining. This is because it is far easier
to machine the male part of a die which
becomes the tool electrode than the fe-
male part of the die. The male part is
then used as the electrode in machining
the difficult-to-form cavity.
Spark Hardening of Cutting Tools
A most unusual application is that of
coating metals with very hard coatings
such as tungsten carbide. In this process,
the roles of the tool and workpiece are
reversed, and the tool is eroded to a
greater extent. No dielectric fluid is used
in the process. The charge passes from
the workpiece to be coated through an
air gap to the tool electrode which is
made of the hard coating material. Metal
transfer from the tool to the work,
caused by the plasma of the arc, creates
an alloy on the work, which is a combina-
tion of the tool and work piece. This
alloy varies with the type of spark dis-
charge. In most cases a discharge more
like an arc than a spark, creates the
desired hard surface on the work
piece. The tool erodes, and because no
dielectric fluid is present to carry the
erosion away, it is coated onto the work-
piece. This process was developed when
British engineers were trying to improve
the machining process, and observed that
by exaggerating certain conditions, the
coating process became possible.
Spark discharge machining will not
replace the usual machining methods,
but it will supplement them, giving the
engineer yet another method by which
he can work the various metals.

ULTRASONICS
The development of ultra-high frequency sound
has opened a whole new industry.
by DAVID PAUL
One of the fastest-growing industries
in our country today is that of
ultrasonics. Since the use of sonar in
World War II, these high-frequency
sound waves have been fitted to an amaz-
ingly diversified number of tasks. Ultra-
sonic sound is today being used in control
systems of guided missiles; in the clean-
ing of watches, surgical tools, electronic
devices, and other precision instruments;
and in physical therapy to treat joint and
muscle afflictions. These are but a few
of the many ways in which ultrasonics
is being used, and the list is growing
by leaps and bounds.
"Ultra-sound" couples much more
power than audible sound with no dis-
turbing noises. It differs from audible-
sound only in that its frequency is high-
er. In most applications of ultrasonics,
the frequency employed is between twen-
ty and forty kilocycles per second, while
the upper limit of human hearing is
approximately eighteen kilocycles per
second; ultrasonic waves are shorter than
audible wavelengths.

Cavitation
Most present-day commercial applica-
tions of ultrasonics make use of the
liquid medium, or solids in the liquid
phase. High-power devices "irradiate"
the liquid with ultrasonic waves. The
powerful, rapid sound vibrations literally
tear the liquid apart, generating cavities
or bubbles varying in size from micro-
scopic to comparatively large, depending
on the liquid and sound frequency used.
These bubbles may be empty or filled
with vapor expelled from the liquid.
The agitation that produces these cavi-
ties, a "cold boiling" effect, is called
cavitation.
While cavitation is the functional
action in virtually all ultrasonic indus-
trial cleaning and processing equipment,
it is a difficult phenomenon to describe
or explain; scientists have only an ap-
proximate concept of its cause and effect.
Basically, what occurs is the following:
pulsed ultrasonic sound waves lupture
the liquid at a periodic rate. During half
of the excitation cycle—the tension phase
—the local pressures are less than the
vapor pressure of the liquid and millions
of cavities are formed. These bubbles
possess a considerable amount of stored
energy. On the following half-cycle, the

the vapor pressure, and instantaneously
collapses these bubbles by compressing
them. As a result, the bubbles release
tremendous localized forces as they
collapse.
Explosions Blast Dirt Away
As they explode, these collapsing
globules can actually "blast" away dirt
and almost any other foreign substance
from any object immersed in the liquid.
As the pressure is increased, the liquid
is forced into the pores, crevices, and
previously inaccessible parts of the object;
during the following pressure decrease,
the liquid erupts violently from the ob-
ject, carrying bits of surface material
with it. In some cases, depending on the
material and length of exposure, the
surface of the object may be literally
eroded away.
Cavitation also affects the liquid itself.
As a result, it is used to dc-gas fluids,
homogenize, emulsify, and perform other
processes that were formerly difficult, ex-
pensive, or impossible.
Equipment
In order to generate these sound waves,
a source of power is needed for the
transducer, a device that converts mechan-
ical, electrical, or hydraulic energy into
ultrasonic waves. Usually, the generator
employs an electric oscillator as the
power source. Such a pulsed generator
assures complete cavitation within the
tank since it allows any barrier of air
bubbles that may have formed between
the object to be cavitated and the trans-
ducer to die out before another burst of
sound is sent through the tank. In this
manner, the reduction of uniform and
complete cavitation of the liquid is avoid-
ed. The power output used may vary from
fifty watts average and 200 watts peak in
small, portable units to two kilowatts
average and eight kilowatts peak in large
capacity equipment.
The transducer is connected to the
generator by a cable and is either attached
to the bottom or sides of the cleaning
tank or immersed in the tank fluid. In
many cases, one or more tanks, combined
with single or multiple transducers, may
be operated off of one generator.
The cleaning tanks used may vary
greatly in size and shape. Present ultra-
sonic cleaning and liquid processing
equipment use "tanks" ranging in size
from small beakers to 150 gallon tanks.
In the assemblies used to clean the long,
slender "Atlas" guided missile, a forty-

ray tube screen. Blocks of metal (left) designed with planned defects enable
technicians to accurately read the ultrasonic scope.
two foot-long tank with 100 transducers
along the tank bottom is used!
The liquid used in the cleaning tanks
may be either plain water or water with
detergents or an appropriate solvent
added. This is another advantage of ul-
trasonic cleaning—water solutions are
frequently used in cleaning operations
which previously required highly toxic
solvents dangerous to the material being
cleaned and to the operator of the clean-
ing process.
Two Major Types of Transducers
Essentially, two different types of trans-
ducers are used in practice. One of these
is called the piezoelectric crystal trans-
ducer. The crystal transducer utilizes
slabs of ceramic-type materials such as
quartz, Rochelle salt, or barium titanate
that are commonly used in phonograph
and microphone cartridges. A high-fre-
quency alternating current is impressed
across these slabs, which expand and con-
tract, respectively, as they accumulate
and release charge, setting up ultrasonic
vibrations. The frequency used is usually
very nearly equal to the natural resonant
frequency of the crystals, since it is at
this point that the amplitude of the crys-
tals' vibrations is greatest. These piezo-
electric materials may also be cast into
shapes other than slabs, such as parabolic
bowls and cylinders, that are suited to
focusing energy within a small area so
that more intense cavitation can be de-
veloped for localized cleaning and liquid
processing.
The second widely-used transducer,
called a magnetostrictive transducer,
makes use of a ferromagnetic material
such as a nickel alloy. The material is
placed in an oscillating magnetic field
so that its expansions and contractions
set up ultrasonic vibrations. Again, the
current used is at the natural resonant
frequency of the material so that maxi-
mum amplitude is obtained.
The ferromagnetic material is usually
fashioned into thin tubes, rods, or lami-
nated stacks resembling a deck of cards
and then used as a core for the driving
coil through which the current is passed.
This construction minimizes power losses
to hysteresis and eddy currents. In com-
parison, the crystal transducer is more
efficient, but it is also fragile and unable
to handle great amounts of power. Con-
sequently, it is used whenever the situa-
tion demands high frequency and low
power.
The magnestostrictive devices are stur-
dier and can operate at lower frequencies
than the crystal transducers; they can
also handle almost any amount of power.
However, they are temperature-sensitive,
since the magnetostrictive effect decreases
as the temperature increases and disap-
pears at the Curie point where magnetic
processes cease to exist.
Applications and Uses
The scope of operations that ultrason-
ics will perform seems almost unlimited.
Since the use of sonar by the military in
World War II, this amazing industry has
grown by leaps and bounds to a point
where today it does an annual business of
over $40,000,000, although it is still a

GAS SOLUBILITY
IN METALS
Experimental data have revealed many impor-
tant facts concerning the influence of dissolved
gases on the properties of metals.
by GERALD N. GOLDBERG
As technical knowledge in the field
of metallurgy and its associated
areas increases, the effects of a dissolved
gas in metals and alloys is becoming bet-
ter understood. For the most part, the
gases of major concern are the diatomic
gases, i.e. hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen.
In some cases, dissolved gases prove to
be beneficial and are an integral part of
the quality of the desired product. How-
ever, in the majority of cases, these gases
produce only adverse effects which are
deleterious to product quality.
The Problem
The effects of dissolved gases can be
shown by considering the following ex-
amples. In the casting industry, gas
solubility may tend to cause gas porosity
upon solidification of the metal due to
the change in the solubility of a specific
gas with respect to temperature. Nitro-

gen dissolved in low carbon steel has
effects upon elongation, deep drawing,
and machinability while in some stain-
less steels, it may act as an austenitc
stabilizer. Often the dissolved nitrogen
may combine with other dissolved gases
which may be present and cause exten-
sive gas porosity.
The presence of dissolved oxygen, as
with the other diatomic gases, often re-
sults in a highly strained lattice structure
in the resultant metal. This may be
attributed to the fact that the atoms of
the gas are so small that they dissolve
interstitially in the metal lattice, produc-
ing a highly strained structure upon
cooling. Interstitially dissolved hydrogen
may also produce a strained lattice which
causes hydrogen embrittlement of the
metal.
Therefore, due to the fact that product
quality is of the utmost importance to
the consumer, a great deal of research in
this area is continually being done so
that the manufacturer will be capable of
supplying a product which can suitably
meet the ever-increasing needs of science
and industry. Through this research, it
is hoped that effective ways of controlling

learned.
Experimental Considerations
In studying the solubility of gases in
the various liquid metals and alloys, a
great many factors must be taken into
account. At the high temperatures in-
volved in such a study, there is a possi-
bility of interaction between refractories,
slag, gas phases, or metal phases. There-
fore, one must exercise extreme precau-
tion in selecting materials lest contamina-
tion and subsequent error result due to
the fact that the materials may not re-
main inert with respect to one another.
However, depending upon the system
being investigated, there exists a variety
of choices of materials which may be
used without introducing errors into the
measurements. Such materials as alumina,
quartz, magnesium oxide, and vycor
(fused silica) are only a few which may
be used with reasonable accuracy.
The most widely used method for
determining gas solubility is that first
developed in 1910 by A. Sieverts. In
this determination, he admitted a known
volume of gas into an evacuated vessel,,
or "reaction chamber" which contained
the metal. Once a constant pressure was
attained, the amount of gas dissolved was
measured as the amount of gas initially-
introduced to the system minus the vol-
ume required to fill the empty space in
the chamber. This volume of empty
space, or "voil", is usually referred to
as "hot volume". The early studies in
this field indicated that Sieverts' Law
given by the equation % N = K\/PN2
was quite accurate for diatomic gases dis-
solving in liquid metal.
For repetition of these solubility deter-
minations, several definite special tech-
niques must be considered. The reaction
chamber should be completely vacuum
tight and of as small a volume as pos-
sible in the interest of accurate measure-
ments. These chambers should be made
of a material such as Vycor glass or other
high temperature, non-reactive material
to keep accuracy at a maximum and
equipment failure at a minimum. Usually,
the use of an ordinary mercury mano-
meter is sufficient for pressure measure-
ments. However, when a McLeod gauge
is used, it must be carefully calibrated
to give accurate measurements. In order
to determine the "hot volume" of the
reaction chamber, measurements must be
taken using an inert gas with the metal
sample in place at each temperature to
be studied.

materials is of the utmost importance.
Not only are there adverse effects caused
by the presence of impurities in the
metal but also from the presence of an
unsuspected gas. Correct and useful re-
sults may only be obtained if the purity
of both the metal and the gas is high and
there is no chance for contamination.
Experimental Procedures
As in most research programs, there
are, of course, quite a number of pro-
cedures for obtaining the desired re-
sults. Some of these methods are better
than others but, overall, the Sieverts'
method seems to be the most satisfactory.
However, a few of these alternate meth-
ods will be mentioned briefly in order
to provide a more complete view of the
problems of experimentally measuring
gas solubility.
One method consists of exposing the
metal sample to the gas for a long period
of time. The metal is allowed to solidify
and then its gas composition is checked
by means of chemical analysis. However,
a problem encountered here is that if the
liquid metal becomes saturated with the
gas, there will be, upon solidification of
the metal, gas evolution and consequently
an inaccurate presentation of the actual
solubility of the gas in the metal. One
way to avoid this problem has been to
use a gas which has a low partial pres-
sure and will therefore remain in the
metal provided solidification is rapid.
Methods have been derived by which
solubilities can be measured at very high
pressures and also at very low pressures.
Gases which have very low solubilities
must be used at pressures which are
quite high in order to magnify their
solubility to the point where measure-
ments may be considered accurate. On
the other hand, there is some experimen-
tation which is limited to very low press-
ures. For example, the solubility of
oxygen in liquid iron may be investi-
gated at pressures of 10"10 to 10 8 at-
mospheres by using mixtures of H„0
and H2 or C02 and CO to provide con-
trolled oxygen pressures.
At the present time, the Siverts' meth-
od is being used in the Department of
Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering
to determine the solubilities of hydrogen
and nitrogen in liquid iron and iron
alloys. This work is being carried out
with the support of the Rackham Re-
search Fund under the direction of Pro-
fessor R. D. Pehlke.
The Sieverts' apparatus used in these
solubility determinations and its asso-
ciated reaction chamber is shown in
Figures I and II. One of the gas supply
tanks shown in Figure I holds the gas
being investigated and the other holds
an inert gas such as argon used for flush-
ing and also for calibrating the system.
The drying towers and the oxidizing
furnaces are used in the purification of
these inlet gases. Stopcock f4 permits us
to introduce either of these gases into
the system depending upon the positions
of stopcocks f2) f„ and (-. When fr and
f3 are open, the gas is admitted to the
gas measuring burette, g, only. Upon
opening f2, the gas is also admitted to
the mercury manometer, j, and the reac-
tion chamber k.

Adherence to Sieverts' law:
%N = K\/P^
Nitrogen dissolved in pure iron at
I606°C.
By adjusting the various stopcocks, in
particular the position of fu any desired
part of the system may be evacuated. In
order to evacuate the reaction chamber,
manometer, and burette, f, must be ad-
justed to pumping position, f2 and f2
must be opened and f4 must be complet-
ly closed. To pump out the back part of
the system, fj must be adjusted to the
proper position, f7 must be closed and f,.
should be opened. In this way, the back
part of the system will be evacuated in-
cluding the space above the mercury level
in the bulb, j. Another feature of this
apparatus is that the burette, manometer
and reaction chamber may be evacuated
from the back by simply opening f7, f..,
and f;,, while completely closing f4.
Finally, the system may be returned to
atmospheric pressure by the use of (,„
which in one position is open to the
atmosphere. By successively opening
this and other stopcocks, air is easily ad-
mitted into the system and the vacuum
may be slowly released.
As shown in Figure I, the entire reac-
tion chamber is water-cooled since we
are working with temperatures of the
order of 1600°C. When working at a
highly reduced pressure even the temper-
ature resistant Vycor glass may be seri-
ously damaged if it is not cooled.
Temperature measurements are made
using optical pyrometer calibrated against
the melting point of pure iron. These
measurements are made through the
right angle prism, c, and the quartz
sight glass shown in Figure I. In this
way, the pyrometer is focused through
the hole in the crucible cover directly
on to the liquid iron. Care must be taken
to keep the pyrometer lens, quartz sight-
glass and the prism quite clean since any
dirt present can result in inaccurate tem-
perature measurements. By substituting
a small resistance furnace or similar unit
for the induction coil, solubilities of gases
in lower melting metals, such as alumi-
num and lead, can easily be obtained
using the same method as previously
described.
Conclusions
By now, it should be evident to the
reader that a knowledge of gas solubili-
ties are of the utmost importance to the
manufacturer if the desired product is
to be obtained. It is, therefore, the job of
the research scientist to uncover and
make more widely known this informa-
tion so that others may benefit by it. It
has been shown that dissolved gases in
liquid metals can be either helpful or
harmful, depending on their effect upon
the product concerned. It is for this
reason that a good knowledge of the
effects of dissolved gases must be devel-
oped if today's materials are to meet the
ever-rising standards which are required
of them.

THIS YOUNG ENGINEER
IS ON THE ROAD TO MANAGEMENT
Dick Cotton knew he wanted to take the
engineering route into management long before
he joined New Jersey Bell Telephone Company.
In fact it was his goal when he was working for
his engineering degree at Rutgers.
When he graduated, he had his lines out to
eleven other companies. He came to New Jersey
Bell because: "I didn't feel I was just a number
to these people. There was no doubt in my mind
that this job would be the best for the long pull."
His first assignment was a tough one. A com-
plex of major telephone cables lay in the path of
the approach to the new traffic level of the George
Washington Bridge on the Hudson. Dick's job
was to find the most practical and economical
way to reroute these cables, and at the same time
to provide for future telephone growth in the
area around the bridge approach.
Dick ironed that one out and got a crack at
another tough job.
Next stop: New Jersey Bell Headquarters
Engineering Staff, Special Studies Group. Here
Dick was a member of a four-man team whose
job was to find ways to eliminate some of the
routine work of field engineers to give them
"more time to think." Dick also helped plan
and control a $100,000,000 annual telephone con-
struction budget.
Presently, Dick is responsible for telephone
equipment engineering projects in the Camden,
New Jersey, area.
How does Dick look at it? "This is a growing
business. I work with this growth every day.
And growth means more room at the top. Of
course, I don't figure I'll get there overnight-
but on my jobs so far I've had a chance to take
a good look at how this business is run. And I
think the sky's the limit for a man who really
wants to work for it."

tional information.

gent, positive and imaginative men we

Ever mindful of its obligation to
present and future generations, the
staff of the University of Michigan
strives to offer its best contributions to
the information agencies of the world.
This month's M.E. &amp; R., presents a note
of the contributions made to the Encyclo-
pedia Britannica by 12 University Pro-
fessors. Also included is the development
of an amazing war machine.
Spark Lab
One of the world's most advanced en-
gineering laboratories is being created
by The University of Michigan College
of Engineering.
When it is ready for operation in Sep-
tember, U-M engineers will use their
new laboratory for advanced instruction
and frontier research in three areas: space
flight phenomena, high energy storage
and transfer, and thermonuclear energy.
For these purposes, three college depart-
ments—aeronautical and astronautical en-
gineering, electrical engineering, and
nuclear engineering—will share the new
laboratory.
All of these uses require one thing in
The power unit for the University of Michigan's new magneto-fluid dynamics lab.
The unusual "unipolar" generator in the foreground takes current from standard
power lines and stores it as energy in its flywheel in the huge coil in the background.

common: a device to provide great
amounts of electrical energy (equivalent
at peak pulse power to between one and
two million kilowatts—about the normal
load of the entire Detroit Edison Com-
pany). Such a device is the heart of the
laboratory. Devised by a U-M engineer,
it consists of an unusual unipolar gener-
ator and a huge coil, some five feet thick,
20 feet in diameter, and wound with a
cable as thick as the stout end of a base-
ball bat.
U-M astronautical engineers will put
this immense wallop of energy to work
in a hypersonic (over five times the speed
of sound) wind tunnel for research on
re-entry and associate conditions. They
want to learn more about what happens
to space vehicles re-entering the atmos-
phere, and to the chemical composition
of air heated by the passage of such a
vehicle.
The astronautical engineer will dump
the big spark (about 350,000 amperes)
into an arc chamber, where it will instan-
taneously heat a gas (such as air) to
around 20,000 degrees (Fahrenheit) —
about twice the temperature of the sun's
surface. This hot gas will then expand,
rupture a metal diaphragm, and blast
through a tiny nozzle and past a model
in a test section into a vacuum tank. The

maximum speed of gas past a model in
the test chamber will be about 20 times
the speed of sound (or about 15,000
miles per hour), creating conditions sim-
ilar to those of re-entry of space vehicles
in the earth's atmosphere. These condi-
tions will allow about 20-thousandths of
a second for the research measurements.
Electrical engineers will have the op-
portunity to study electromagnetic wave
reflection and absorption by ionized gases
to better understand communication tech-
nology. They will also use the laboratory
to study the properties of electric arcs
at high currents and pressures. (Pressure
as high as 5,000 times the earth's atmos-
pheric pressure will be produced in the
arc chambers.) They are interested too,
in learning how to reduce electrode ero-
sion. Such high energy arcs eat away the
surface of the electrodes, vaporizing the
carbon or metal of which they are made.
The U-M engineers hope to be able to
find a way to move the arc discharge
point over the electrode to keep it from
eroding one spot.
Nuclear engineers will study processes
and conditions leading to controlled fu-
sion reactions ("harnessed H-bomb
power") in the new facility. Sustained
thermonuclear reactions (which have
been approached but not attained in at
least one U.S. laboratory) require temper-
atures of around a hundred million de-
grees. Gases this hot are ionized (or
stripped of positive or negative particles
and enabled to carry electric current) and
are contained in a strong magnetic field.
A high energy source, such as the
laboratory will provide, is necessary to
yield both the high temperatures and
strong magnetic fields required to ap-
proach sustained thermonuclear reactions.
Experimental work by the U-M nuclear
engineers will focus on understanding
hot gases in a magnetic field, developing
measuring techniques, and making meas-
urements of these conditions.
Called the "Magneto-Fluid Dynamics
Laboratory," the facility is being installed
in space adjacent to the U-M's propul-
sion laboratory on the University's North
Campus.

We don't believe in cogs. We
believe in individual people —
particularly when it comes to
mechanical engineers. We don't
assign them to drawing boards.
We assign them to projects: in
machine design, in assisting
customers on proper fastening
design, in sales engineering,
or all three, if they prefer. If
you don't like the idea of being
a cog, then write to us before
you graduate. Liberal benefits,
as you would expect from a 115
year old company that's the
leader in its field.

ULTRASONICS
(Continued from page 13)
"baby" in terms of the many uses pre-
dicted for ultrasonics that have not yet
been perfected.
As mentioned already, cavitation affects
liquids in many ways. It will de-gas
fluids and it already has several uses in
connection with this property. Sound
waves are now being beamed through
beer bottles before capping, causing the
beer to foam and forcing out trapped air,
thereby lengthening the shelf life of the
beer. It is also used in the wine indus-
try to speed up the aging process. Cavi-
tation even cleans, degreases and decon-
taminates radioactive materials from in-
struments' most inaccessible positions. It
cleans everything from electronic appara-
tus to surgical instruments, camera lenses
to giant missile assemblies. The need to
disassemble complicated devices before
cleaning is also done away with by ultra-
sonics and, despite its great power, cavi-
tation will not harm glass, chrome-plate,
stainless steel, or etched and painted
markings.
"Ultrasound" is used in industry to
clean motor and generator armatures,
vacuum tubes, printed circuits, electric
meters, potentiometers, and transistors.
It also removes excess solder flux, etching
resists, fingerprints, polishing compounds,
lint, wax, and other soils from virtually
all kinds of items.
In the metal-working industry, ultra-
sonic waves are used not only to clean
but also to drill holes in hard, brittle ma-
terials like tungsten carbide, steel, brass,
and even glass because the drill operates
by making an up-and-down movement
rather than by rotating. Fluid in the form
of an abrasive slurry, activated by ultra-
sonic energy, literally eats away any ma-
terial—the harder the better. The hole
made is the exact shape of the bit used,
which may be square or any other odd
shape. The bit doesn't have to be hard
either. Driven by ultrasonic, a fork can
cut holes in glass and a penknife can
slice tool steel!
Ultrasonic is also used as a tool of in-
spection in the railroad, aircraft, and
metals industries since it can "see" in-
side materials. When a crack or other
defect hidden from sight is "seen" by
the sound wave, part of the wave is re-
flected back to a measuring instrument.
The other part of the wave travels to the
opposite end of the material and is also
reflected back. By comparing the elapsed
time with a standard, the exact location
of the flaw can be determined. Tires are
currently being tested and inspected in
this manner.
Military uses for ultrasonic include
control systems for missiles, depth sound-
ers, and systems for underwater search
and communication. Extensive use of ul-
trasonic in the medical field is just begin-
ning but great progress has already been
made in this area. Surgical instruments
formerly thrown away after one using are
now being cleaned and recleaned by ultra-
sonics. Physicians are using these waves
in physical therapy to heat deep tissue
much as in diathermy, to locate and
destroy tumors in previously inaccessible-
places, and also to purify and emulsify
drugs. They are also using ultrasonics in
much the same way as X-rays, receiving
a picture on a TV-like screen. The chief
advantage of this method is that soft
organs such as the heart and lungh show-
up better.
The Future
A bright future looms ahead for the
ultrasonics industry. The next few years
should see the perfection of such ultra-
sonic devices as a home solderer, an air
cleaner that traps dust before it settles
on furniture, a clothes washer, and even
a sonic bathtub that imparts a pleasant,
tickling sensation. Prototypes of all these
items are realities even now; the only
obstacle to their being placed on the
market is their prohibitive price. For ex-
ample, a home solderer can now be
bought for about $200 and a hospital
instrument cleaner presently costs about
$3000. Leaders in the ultrasonics indus-
try feel confident of their ability to low-
er these prices and predict a great future
for this comparative new field. Indeed,
these unseen, unheard ultrasonic waves
have already performed previously im-
possible tasks quite competently and there
seems to be no end to the number of ways
in which this fascinating phenomenon
can amaze us.

At a party a doctor was complaining
about all the women who approached him
on these occasions. "You know," he said
to the man sitting beside him, "they al-
ways want advice. They tell me about
their ailments, and they ask me to pre-
scribe for them. That's why I hate to go
to these parties. You're a lawyer," he con-
tinued, "do you think I should charge
them for this advice even if I give it after
office hours?"
"By all means," said the lawyer. "Ad-
vice is advice."
Next day the doctor received a letter
from the lawyer.
The bill read simply: "For advice—
$50."

The other night I phoned a girl named
Doris. "Doris isn't here right now," a
voice answered. "But this is her young,
112-pound, 5-foot-4, blue-eyed, red-
haired sister."
The day after finals a disheveled M.E.
walked into a psychiatrist's office, tore
open a cigarette, and stuffed the tobacco
up his nose.
"I see you need some help," said the
startled doctor.
"Yeah," agreed the M.E., "Got a
match?"
The first American astronaut to land
on Mars cautiously emerged from his
rocket ship. He looked around and saw
coming towards him a beautiful babe.
She was the most wonderful hunk of
woman he'd ever seen. Only she was 11
feet tall. He waited until she came close.
Then he said quickly: "Take me to your
ladder. I'll see your leader later."
A young druggist was left in charge
of the store while the owner went for a
cup of coffee. When he returned he in-
quired how the young man had made
out.
"Oh, just dandy—I cured a lady's
cough."
"What did you give her?"
"Well, I gave her a malted milk with
four ounces of mineral oil and five
ounces of castor oil in it."
"My God, that won't cure a cough!"
"Yeah? Just look at who's leaning on
that lamppost across the street. She
doesn't dare cough!"
A new patient had been on the psy-
chiatrist's couch for five minutes. When
the doctor asked him to repeat a state-
ment, the patient looked up and irritably
snapped, "I said, Doc, that for some un-
known reason people don't like me . . .
Open your ears, pinhead."
A young man walked into the circus
arena as they were setting up their tents
for the opening performance and ap-
proached the manager.
"Sir," he began, "I'd like to apply for
a job in your circus. I've got a very dar-
ing and unusual act."
The manager asked the young man
what he did.
"I climb to the top of your circus
center pole," he explained, "and dive
head-first into a bucket of sand."
The circus manager was flabbergasted.
"Nobody can do that," he said. "Show
me."
The young man climbed to the top of
the center pole and dived head-first into
a bucket of sand. The circus manager
was amazed.
"That's tremendous, kid, positively
amazing. You're on the payroll as of
this minute, right now. Two hundred
bucks a week."
"No, no," the young man said.
"Okay," the manager pressed. "I'll
double that figure and give you a two-
year contract."
The young man still refused.
"Okay, okay, kid. You're a good bar-
gainer. I'll give you $2,500 a week and
make it a 10-year contract. That's the
biggest salary I've ever paid anyone. But
you're worth it. You'll bring 'em in."
The young man just shook his head
negatively. "For Pete's sake. Why not?"
pleaded the owner.
The young man, rubbing his neck,
answered: "I just don't think I want to
do that trick any more."
Sam was standing on a street corner
when he saw his buddy, Joe, come driv-
ing up in a brand new car. Sam said,
"Say, Joe, where did you get that new
car?"
"Well, it's like this. I was standing
on this very corner when a beautiful girl
drives by in this car. She asked me if I
wanted to ride and you know I don't turn
it down. Well she drives out to this lone-
ly spot and takes off all her clothes and
says 'Joe, you can have anything you
want,' So I took this car."
"You know you were right, those
clothes wouldn't have fit you anyway."
Probably the reason that God made
woman last was that he didn't want any
advice while creating man.

Hungary. The characters: A Russian offi-
cer, a Hungarian, an old lady, and an
attractive girl.
The train enters a tunnel. The passen-
gers hear first a kiss, then a vigorous
slap.
The old lady thinks: "What a good
girl she is, such good manners, such fine
moral character!"
The girl thinks: "Isn't it odd that the
Russian tried to kiss the old lady and
not me?"
The Russian thinks: "That Hungarian
is a smart fellow; he steals a kiss and I
get slapped."
The Hungarian thinks: "Am I a
smart fellow! I kiss the back of my
hand, hit a Russian officer and get away
with it."
The preacher was expounding on his
subject: "Who has the most money to
spend?" He cried, "Who has the big-
gest car? . . . the saloon keeper! Who has
the finest fur coat? . . . The saloon keep-
er's wife! And who pays for all this? . . .
You do, my friends, you do!"
Several days later a man and his wife
who had been in the audience stopped
the preacher on the street and thanked
him for the good advice they received
from the sermon.
"I'm glad indeed that you've given
up drink," said the preacher.
"Well, it isn't that," ventured the
man, "we bought ourselves a saloon."

A man who moved into a well-to-do
but stuffy neighborhood was mowing his
lawn one hot day with his shirt off. After
several minutes had passed a patrol car
pulled over to the curb and the cop
walked over to the man.
"Don't you know you're breaking the
law?" growled the cop. "We don't allow
indecent exposure in this neighborhood."
The man, convinced he was acting per-
fectly innocently, shrugged his shoulders
which exasperated the cop.
"Why, what would people say if your
wife mowed the lawn dressed like that?"
"They'd say I married her for her
money," the man replied.

A man sat at the bar rail all night and
when he was ready to leave crawled up
the wall, across the ceiling, down the
wall and out the door. One patron asked
the bartender, "Isn't that fellow a pretty
strange individual?" "Yeah," said the
bartender, "he never says goodnight."
A college student arrived at the Pearly
Gates where St. Peter asked him who he
was. When told he was a pre-med, St.
Peter said, "Go to the Devil."
Some time later a pre-law student
arrived, and upon being asked who he
was, replied that he was a pre-law
student. He was told to go to Hades.
The third student arrived at the Pearly
Gates with his slide rule. When asked
who he was he replied, "I'm an en-
gineer."
Whereupon St. Peter said "Come on
in, son. You've been through Hell al-
ready."

Once upon a time there were three
bears. One morning they came down to
breakfast and Papa Bear looked at his
bowl and cried, "Someone's eaten all
my porridge."
Baby Bear looked at his bowl and
cried, "Someone's eaten all my porridge."
"Sit down and shut up," said Mama
Bear. "It ain't poured yet."
A young Arkansas lass was milking
her cow when down the road a piece she
saw a young man approaching. She called
to her father, "Oh, Father, there is a
boy coming up the road." Her father re-
torted with, "Get in the house." She
called back, "But he looks like one of
those engineers." "Then take the cow
in, too." answered the old gentleman.
* * *
Is this a picture of your fiance?"
"Yes."
"She must be wealthy."
* * *
She: "Have you heard about the new
college game?"
He: "No, what is it?"
She: "Button, button, here comes the
housemother."

The waitress was wondering why the
elder man was eating while his wife was
staring out the window.
"Aren't you hungry?" asked the wait-
ress.
"Sure am," was the reply, "I'm just
waiting till Paw gets through with the
teeth."

And there was the heart rending case
of the man who spilt a whole bottle of
hair restorer on his head and smothered
before he could get to a pair of scissors.
A sort of old-fashioned gentleman
took his gal for a ride in his car and
after finding a suitable spot to park,
kissed her several times lightly on the
cheek and then said, "This is called
spooning."
"Okay," she said, "but I had much
rather shovel."
Two Ag. engineers each had a horse,
but they couldn't decide which belonged
to whom. So they cut the mane off one
to differentiate, but it soon grew back.
Next they cut the tail off one, but that
also grew back. Finally they measured
them and found that the black one was
four inches taller than the white.
"Did you follow my advice about kiss-
ing your girl when she least expected
it?"
"Oh, Heck," said the fellow with the
swollen eye, "I though you said Where."

"If it's heads, we hit the sack. If it's
tails, we stay up. If it stands on edge, we
study."

Engineers are continually surprised to
find that girls with the most streamlined
shapes offer the most resistance.
I.M.: "If I kiss you, will you call for
Help?"
Co-ed: "Will you need help?" (Edi-
tor's note: It depends on the Co-ed)
I.M.: "Everytime I kiss you it makes
me a better man."
Co-ed: "Why try to get to heaven in
one night?"

As he felt his way around the lamp
post, the overloaded senior muttered,
"S'no use, I'm walled in."
"She isn't my best girl—just necks
best."

Things men like to hear a girl say:
— No, I've never seen the golf course
at night.
— Why bother, there's no one home

— Chaperone? What chaperone?
— My, but I'm cold.
— Yes.

Mrs. Worthmore and her French
poodle were shopping one day, when she
noticed the man standing next to her at

"My, my," she said, "don't be afraid

"You're right," conceded the first
youngster. "But it's not going more than
760 miles per hour because it didn't break

The second lad agreed on this point
and remarked, "It's amazing the pres-

research and development-

-you'll find
Photography
at Work
with you
Research and development engineers
find photography one of their most
versatile tools. Camera and film can
record the readings of instruments—
can capture for study the fleeting
transient on the oscilloscope face. The
content and structure of metals can be
studied by photospectrography or
x-ray diffraction. And stresses in parts
are visualized by photographing
plastic models with transmitted polar-
ized light.
There's hardly a field on which you
can set your sights where photography
does not play a part in simplifying
work and routine. It saves time and
costs in research, on the production
line, in the engineering and sales
departments, in the office.
So in whatever you plan to do, take
full advantage of all the ways photog-
raphy can help.
CAREERS WITH KODAK:
With photography and photographic proc-
esses becoming increasingly important in
the business and industry of tomorrow,

Interview with General Electric's
Francis J. Boucher
Manager-Manufacturing Personnel Development Service
How Good
Is Your Best Job Offer . • •
Q. Mr. Boucher, with all the job inter-
views a graduating engineer goes
through, how can he be reasonably
sure he has made the right choice?
A. This is a good question because
few seniors have enough work ex-
perience in industry, government
and educational institutions to
allow them to make a fully rea-
soned choice. However, I think the
first step is to be sure that short-
term factors like starting salary
and location don't outweigh long-
range factors like opportunity and
professional growth. All of these
factors should be evaluated before
making a final commitment.
0. But you do feel that starting salary
is important?
A. Very much so. If you are mar-
ried—it may be an even greater
consideration. But you should also
look beyond starting salary. Find
out, for example, if the company
you are considering has a good
salary administration plan. If there
is no way of formally appraising
your performance and determining
your appropriate rewards, you run
the risk of becoming dissatisfied
or stalemated due to neglect of
these important considerations.
Q. What considerations do you feel
should be evaluated in reaching a job
decision?
A. Let me refer you to a paper
written by Dr. L. E. Saline, now
Manager of Information Systems
in our Defense Systems Depart-
ment. It is titled "How to Evaluate
Job Offers." (Incidentally, you may
obtain a copy by writing as di-
rected in the last paragraph.) In
it, Dr. Saline proposes six ques-
tions—the answers to which should
give you much of the information
you'll need for an objective job-
offer evaluation. He suggests you
determine . . .
• to what degree will the work be
challenging and satisfying?
• what opportunities are available
to further develop abilities?
• what opportunities are there for
advancing in the Company (and
how dynamic the Company is in
the marketplace is an important
aspect of this question).
• what salary potentials are pos-
sible with respect to the future?
• what about geographical location
—now and in the future?
• what effort does the Company
make to establish and maintain a
professional climate?
There is more to these questions
than meets the eye and I think
you would enjoy reading Dr.
Saline's paper.
Q. What about the openings on de-
fense projects that are listed in the
various magazines and newspapers?
A. Presumably, there will always
be a need for technical manpower
in the defense business. But I
want to point out to you that most
of these opportunities are for ex-
perienced personnel, or personnel
with specific additional training re-
ceived at the graduate level.
Q. How do you feel about training
programs? Do they offer any particular
advantages over any other offer I
might accept?
A. I feel training programs are par-
ticularly helpful in easing the tran-
sition from an academic to a
business environment. Of course
they provide formal training de-
signed to add to the individual's
basic fund of knowledge. They
also provide working experience in
a variety of fields and a broad
knowledge of the company con-
cerned and its scope of operations.
Upon completion, the individual is
generally better prepared to decide
the direction in which he will pur-
sue his professional career.
General Electric conducts a num-
ber of training programs. Those
that attract the greatest number
of engineers are the Engineering
and Science, Manufacturing, and
Technical Marketing Programs.
Each combines a formal, graduate-
level study curriculum, on-the-job
experience, and rotating assign-
ments. There is little question in
my mind that when an engineer
completes the Program of his
choice, he is far better prepared to
choose his field by interest and by
capability. I might also add that
because of this, he is more valuable
to the Company as an employee.
Q. Then you feel that a training pro-
gram is the best alternative for a
graduating engineer?
A. Not always. Some seniors have
already determined the specific
field they are best suited for in
terms of their own interests and
capabilities. In such cases, direct
placement into this specific field
may be more advantageous. Pro-
fessional self-development for these
employees, as for all General Elec-
tric technical employees, is en-
couraged through a variety of
programs including the Company's
Tuition Refund Program for work
toward advanced degrees, in-plant
courses conducted at the graduate
level, and others designed to meet
individual needs.
Q. For the record, how would you
rate a job offer from General Electric?
A. I've tried to get across the need
for factual information and a long-
range outlook as the keys to any
good job evaluation. With respect
to the General Electric Company,
seniors and placement offices have
access to a wide variety of infor-
mation about the Company, its
professional environment and its
personnel practices. I think quali-
fied seniors will also discover that
General Electric offers professional
opportunity second to none—and
starting salaries that are competi-
tive with the average offered
throughout industry today. From
the above, you can see that I
would rate a job offer from General
Electric very highly.

General Electric's training pro-
grams? You can get it, together

reer Planning," General Electric

This mark tells you a product is made of modern, dependable Steel.

How cold is up? We know that outer space can never be colder than minus 459.72° Fahrenheit—that's absolute zero, the
point at which all molecular motion ceases. We don't know what coldness like this will do to materials, but we're finding out.
Scientists are using a heat exchanger to produce temperatures as low as minus 443° Fahrenheit. They test materials in this
extreme cold and see how they perform. Out of such testing have already come special grades of USS steels that retain much of
their strength and toughness at -50° or below; steels like USS "T-1" Constructional Alloy Steel, Tri-Ten High Strength Steel,
and our new 9% Nickel Steel for Cryogenics applications. And the heat exchanger to produce the -443° Fahrenheit is

we know about
tomorrow:

Man is like a Goldfish in a Bowl of Ink...His view of the "ultraviolet universe" is
shut off by the blanket of air which surrounds him.
The earth's atmosphere is like the ink in a goldfish bowl. It absorbs so much of the ultraviolet
light from outer space that little gets through to show us what lies out there.
But now, an electronic imaging tube, sensitive to this ultraviolet light has been developed by
Westinghouse Research scientists. Westinghouse is working with the Smithsonian Institution and the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to mount these tubes in satellites so that they can
"see" in outer space and radio their findings back to earth.
Every time mankind removes the limitations on human sight...with the telescope, the microscope, the
fluoroscope and electronic imaging tubes...we find things which have a profound effect upon our lives.
This is just one of the exciting things going on at Westinghouse, one of the many reasons why
Westinghouse is the best place for talented engineers. See our representative when he is on your

COVER STORY
Accutron, recently announced by the Bui-
ova Watch Co., represents a new advance
in the principles of time keeping. The com-
plex main spring and gear mechanism, for-
merly used as the time standard, has been
replaced by a tuning fork. This month's
cover, by Sherry Colenso, portrays the new
mechanism. The obsolete mechanism, repre-
sented by the outline of gears, is replaced
by the tuning fork which stands sharply in
the foreground, taking the emphasis from
the old device.

AN EXAMPLE OF GROWTH
BASED ON RESEARCH
Phillips Petroleum Company began putting
science to work in company laboratories very
early in its history. Back when natural gas was
still being flared as a "waste" product, Phillips
scientists were discovering new, profitable uses
for it and the liquids extracted from it. Acting
upon this knowledge, Phillips management
amassed huge reserves of natural gas when it was
still generally considered to be of little use.
With this foundation of raw materials and
technology, Phillips has attained a commanding
leadership in natural gas, natural gas liquids, and
petrochemicals. This base has been especially
valuable in the chemicals field, where intense
competition permits a nod of success only to
companies with supplies of the proper raw ma-
terials and the know-how assembled from long
experience and research.
From Phillips intensified emphasis on research
and development through the years came many
notable, profitable discoveries or developments.
Among these are "cold" synthetic rubber; oil
furnace carbon blacks; HF alkylation and other
refining processes; high density polyolefins,
trademarked Marlex; and all-season motor oils.
Three times the company has won the coveted
"Chemical Engineering Achievement Award" for
its research and development accomplishments,
once by itself and twice in group awards.
Although research solves problems and de-
velops know-how, an important measure of its
results is patents. For many years Phillips has
ranked second in number of patents issued and in
total number of U. S. patents owned among all
U. S. oil companies. The most recently available
figures show Phillips ranks eighth in this respect
among companies in all industries in America.
Intensive and consistent research effort has
equipped Phillips with a qualified and dedicated
research and development team. Although many
of Phillips 3,000 scientists and engineers are
located at the modern Phillips Research Center
near the company headquarters in Oklahoma,
others may be found in vital centers elsewhere.
These people are thinking and working not only
on exciting and challenging projects for the years

ahead, but also to make existing operations more
profitable and to quickly commercialize newly
developed processes and products. In short, their
emphasis is upon converting ideas into earnings.
One of the most recent major petrochemical
achievements of Phillips research is cis-polybuta-
diene rubber, trademarked Cis-4. Extensive tests
have shown this rubber to be superior to natural
rubber in tire tread wear and in other important
qualities, including blowout resistance and trac-
tion on snow and ice. The company's 25,000 ton
per year Cis-4 plant has commenced production.
The process has been licensed to others both in
the U. S. and abroad.
There is always an undisclosed backlog of dis-
coveries and inventions to which Phillips scien-
tists are giving "finishing touches" prior to
commercialization. Some now or soon emerging
are a new jet fuel additive solving a vexing air-
craft problem, a new polypropylene process, and
a better seismic prospecting method.
Research is one reason for "Looking Ahead
With Phillips."

USE THIS CHART TO CHECK
YOUR OPPORTUNITIES AT DOW!
We call this an 'opportunities chart.' It shows some of, but
by no means covers all, the professional positions avail-
able at Dow for college graduates. What the chart cannot
show is the keen interest that Dow management takes in
the individual. Here, sound technical background and
qualities of leadership are soon rewarded. Opportunities
abound—on the job and through graduate study.
Dow is currently serving 200 industries varying from
medicine to mining, paper to paint, tires to textiles,
farming to foundries. Dow has major manufacturing
operations in 23 locations in the United States in addition
to associated and subsidiary companies. Exploration goes
on endlessly at 50 separate laboratories. In addition, Dow
has rapidly expanding marketing and manufacturing oper-
ations in 28 foreign countries.
Behind every product (and Dow has more than 700) is a
story of achievement that comes with opportunity. Oppor-
tunity for individual and independent work by the people
who created the product; by those who developed and
engineered its manufacture; by the ones who produced,
sold, and serviced it; and by those who continue to
improve it.
Dow's fringe benefits are excellent also . . . life and hospi-
talization insurance ... a yearly salary review plan (salaries
are reviewed at least once a year, and the emphasis is on
merit rather than length of service) ... a pension and
profit-sharing plan ... an educational refund plan (pro-
vides financial assistance for employees who want to
increase their job effectiveness through continued educa-
tion) ... and by participating in past stock purchase plans
offered periodically, about 45 per cent of Dow's employees
have become shareholders in the company.

With this, the October, 1961 issue, the Michigan Tecbnic
embarks upon its 80th year of continuous publication as the
student publication of the Michigan College of Engineering.
This fall, we are several weeks early with our first edition, in
order to have current copies of our publication available for
distribution to a group of our fellow editors who will be con-
vening in Ann Arbor the weekend of the Army game.
These young men and women, over a hundred strong, are
the editors of engineering magazines similar to the Technic on
campuses from coast to coast. While in Ann Arbor as guests of
the Technic, these Engineering College Magazines Associated
conventioneers will pursue a busy routine of seminars, meetings,
and workshop sessions, but they will have ample opportunity to
inspect the Michigan campus, particularly the engineering fa-
cilities. Their impressions of our "U" will be carried back to
virtually every other noteworthy engineering campus in the
country.
This is, then, an excellent opportunity to show off every-
thing that we're so proud of here, and to bolster our reputa-
tion as one of the nation's more substantial, more serious, and
more worthwhile places to assemble an engineering education.
Preparations for the forthcoming ECMA convention have
caused us to reflect on the purpose and value of such trade and
business conventions and similar ones held in industry. Are
they worthwhile? Without a doubt, they are costly—in terms of
preparation and administration, travel, time lost away from
work, printing of minutes, and so forth. There is also little
doubt that such conventions are fun, at least for the delegates.
But what about the boss, who must cover the expense account
tab? Does he often get his money's worth?
It is our opinion that a great many conventions, trade shows,
etc., are not worth the cost of putting them on, because of the
ineptness in planning, poor selection of subject matter and/or
delegates, and too much frivolity in proportion to attentiveness
to business. However, as ones engaged in the communications
business, we can hardly afford to look totally with disfavor on
conventioneering. Within the notion of the technical conference
10

for exchanging ideas, and an excellent sales medium as well.
As long as the delegates know the purpose of the meeting
(which must be clearly outlined well in advance), and are suf-
ficiently dedicated to avoid excessive partying, the convention
may be economically defensible. It is only when the delegates
take the convention in the spirit of a joyride that company
bosses ought to be reluctant to divert men and money toward
them.
This leads me to a further comment on the subject of com-
munication in industry, this time on the intercompany level.
During the summer, I had the unique experience of working
in the executive department of a multi-billion dollar corpora-
tion. Although my position was very definitely at the bottom of
the ladder, it was company policy that carbon copies of all
executive correspondence be circulated throughout the depart-
ment, including on down to me. I was a little surprised at the
style and tone of some of the letters—those addressed outside
the company were standard in most respects, but the internal
messages were quite unusual. In order to save time, all of the
messages were skeletonized. Instead of employing the level of
grammar, punctuation, etc., that we are all led to expect of
executives, these messages read like telegrams. Every unneces-
sary word was eliminated, and many others were contracted or
abbreviated. Apparently executive time is so valuable that use
of standard English is uneconomical. Perhaps our English de-
partment will recognize how busy we engineering students are
and permit us to write themes in telegraphese!
One final word—the Technic is once again enlisting tryouts
for permanent staff positions in all departments. This is an ex-
cellent opportunity for anyone—engineer or otherwise, fresh-
man or old-timer, to get into a very rewarding activity. We
have our own office (3077 East Engine), a long tradition of
honored and respected journalistic endeavor, and (perhaps most
surprising) a balanced budget. However, we need people—
writers, till-ringers, artists, layout and production men, adver-
tising people (a job simplified by our New York ad agency),
and secretaries. Just drop by the office and talk to anyone who
happens to be around. You'll be most welcome!

Frankly, there is no practical substitute
for the wheel today. But at Ford Motor
Company, our scientists and engineers
refuse to give "no" for an answer. They
are tackling, among others, the problem
of wheelless vehicles for tomorrow.
Is "tomorrow" really far off? Not according
to the men at Ford. Already they've devel-
oped the Levacar as one possibility. It
replaces the wheel with levapads, per-
forated discs which emit powerful air jets
to support the vehicle. Air suspension—if
you will—of an advanced degree. Imagine
traveling swiftly, safely at up to 500 mph,
riding on a tissue-thin film of air. Guided
unerringly by a system of rails. Propelled
by powerful turboprops. This is the
Levacar.
Meanwhile we've still got the wheel. And
the job of building better cars for today.
So we hope you won't mind riding on
wheels just a little longer while we con-
centrate on both tasks.

with his scientific interests and he is quite likely
to do great things and be happy about doing
them. That's the way it is at Detroit Edison,
whether it's on one of our long range develop-

system improvements, or on our summer pro-
gram for engineering professors and students as
shown above.

on how to plan your career
The Bethlehem
loop course
What it is and how it works
The Loop Course is our program con-
ducted annually for selecting and train-
ing qualified college graduates for
careers with Bethlehem Steel. It was
established 40 years ago. From the
very beginning, it included an observa-
tional circuit (or "loop") of a steel
plant, ergo the name. Many men hold-
ing key positions with Bethlehem to-
day entered the company through the
Loop Course.
Promotion from Within—The Loop
Course is specifically designed to pro-
vide management personnel. Since it is
our policy to promote from within, it
is vital that competent men, well-
grounded in our practices and policies,
be available to fill management open-
ings as they occur. And, due to Bethle-
hem's steady growth, there has been
no lack of opportunities to advance.
The Basic Course—Every looper at-
tends the initial five-week course held
at our home office in Bethlehem, Pa.,
beginning early in July. He attends
orientation lectures, listens to dis-
cussions by management men on all
phases of company operations, and
makes daily trips through the local
steel plant. At the end of this period
he has a sound basic knowledge of
the Bethlehem organization.
Their First Assignments—At the end
of the basic course, loopers receive their
first assignments. Ordinarily a large
majority report to our steelmaking
plants, where they attend orientation
programs much like the initial one at
Bethlehem, but more specialized. Dur-
ing this period plant management
closely observes each looper's apti-
tudes and interests, with the objective
of assigning him to the department or
job for which he appears to be best
fitted, and corresponding as closely as
possible to his educational background
and work preferences.
Specialized Training—Loopers select-
ed for sales, mining, shipbuilding,
research, and the company's adminis-
trative departments, proceed from the
basic course to specialized training
programs varying according to the
type of work.
Preparing for Advancement—As the
looper gains in ability, experience, and
knowledge, and as openings occur, he
is moved into positions of increasingly

greater responsibility. The company
expects and encourages the looper to
produce, to make steady progress.
Regular reports as to his work and
progress are made to department heads
—and annual reports to divisional
vice-presidents—throughout his career.
Emphasis on Technical Degrees —
Because of the nature of Bethlehem's
activities, the greatest demand is for
men with technical degrees, especially
those in mechanical, metallurgical, in-
dustrial, electrical, chemical, civil, and
mining engineering.
Read Our Booklet—The eligibility
requirements for the Loop Course, as
well as a description of the way it
operates, are more fully covered in our
booklet, "Careers with Bethlehem Steel
and the Loop Course." It will answer
many questions undergraduates may
have. Copies are available in most college
placement offices, ormay be obtained by
writing to Manager of Personnel, Beth-
lehem Steel Company, Bethlehem, Pa.
All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin.

WHAT COMPANY
SHOULD I JOIN?
When there is a choice of employment opportunities, most
graduating engineers and scientists make some sort of list of the
advantages offered by each prospective employer.
Some men put salary at the top of the list. Many lean toward the
company offering them the best chance at creativity . . . the widest scope
for developing their interests and increasing their professional stature.
Others favor job security, company size and stability, or geographic
location. The final choice generally is made on the basis of the
biggest "package" of advantages offered.
Probably no organization today can offer a longer list of
employment advantages than The Bendix Corporation.
One of the world's most highly regarded, stable,
and diversified engineering-research-manu
facturing corporations, Bendix has 25
divisions which produce, literally, "a
thousand diversified products." The
wide geographic spread of these
divisions can be seen in the
listing below.
Starting salaries paid by Bendix are
competitive with those offered by
other companies—naturally, better
talents are more highly rewarded.
Bendix readily recognizes achieve-
ment, and gives the developing
engineer and scientist wide lati-
tude in his field of interest.
Ask your Placement Director
about Bendix—where you can
build your career to suit your
talents. If you can't arrange a
personal interview, write to
C. C. Cleveland, The Bendix
Corporation, Fisher Building,
Detroit 2, Michigan, for
more details.

MICROMINIATURIZATION
Bombs grow larger, cities get larger, everything is
growing except electron devices. Scientists are now
building devices so small that one needs a micro-
scope to see them.

audio amplifier in conventional phono
system. Frequency range is 0-20,000
cycles, output 5 watts with heat sink.
Amplifier itself, which occupies .001
cubic inch, is at right in black mounting
while device at left is molecular pre-
amplifier.
Since the advent of the electronic
age, half a century ago when Dr.
Lee DeForest introduced the vacuum
tube, scientists and engineers have been
striving to reduce the size, complexity,
and cost of electronic equipment. At
different times, the emphasis has been
placed on a particular phase of im-
provement. For example, prior to
World War II the prime objective was
to cut costs to the minimum because of
the staggering quantities of electronic
equipment needed for defense. A direct
result of these efforts was the multi-
purpose radio tube, which combined in
one envelope two or more vacuum tubes
each capable of performing a separate
function. After the war the military
demanded smaller more complex equip-
ment and the emphasis was shifted.
This brings us to the present and to
the relatively new concepts of micro-
miniaturization.
Development of the Transistor
Preliminary work in miniaturizing
electronic components was relatively
straight-forward. Conventional com-
ponents were only slightly modified
and more carefully engineered so that
space was minimized. Then came the
question, "Just how small can we make
a conventional electronic circuit before
we reach a limit?" The answer: "Not
small enough." Thus, the search began
for new techniques and new materials
to perform the same electrical func-
tions in a tremendously reduced space.
Meanwhile, the program was given a
tremendous boost when scientists at the
Bell Telephone Laboratories unveiled
the transistor. Here was a tiny, almost
indestructible lump of impure semi-
conductor which could function in
the same way as the bulky vacuum tube.
The transistor gave off almost no heat
and used very little power. A true
miracle!
Spurred on by development of the
transistor, scientists found that if cop-
per were deposited on insulated panels
in predetermined patterns, previously
complex wiring arrangements could be
reduced in size and could be made
more durable. Behold, the printed cir-
cuit was born! Today printed circuit
wiring is common in many types of
household equipment. Transistor ra-
dios, many television sets, and high
fidelity components often incorporate
printed circuits in their construction.

The next challenge was to
modify passive components such as re-
sistors, capacitors, and inductors, so
that they would be compatible in size
with the transistor. Hundreds of manu-
facturers worked to develop these cir-
cuit components. Concerning resistors,
one of the better answers to the prob-
lem was the "thin-film" process. This
method utilizes deposits of metal con-
taining varying amounts of impurities
to give different resistance values. This
technique has been developed to the
point where 1% accuracy can be readily
obtained. A very similar procedure is
used in manufacturing ultra-small ca-
pacitors. A thin dielectric separates two
conducting strips on a circuit board and
a tiny capacitor results. The "thin-film"
method is particularly attractive be-
cause it is so easily adaptable to circuit
construction on tiny wafer boards.
Micro-miniature inductors were devel-
oped by using machines to wind almost
microscopic wire on tiny iron cores.
Complete Sub-Assembly Available
Now that all the essential circuit ele-
ments were available, it was necessary
to develop techniques for combining
and assembling them into functioning
electronic systems. The U.S. Army in-
vested $15 million in an effort to bring
about a ten-fold reduction in size and
weight and an increase in reliability in
military electronic equipment. The Ar-
my program resulted in many signifi-
cant developments in the field of
micro-electronics.
One of the most noteworthy was
the advent of modular electronic
micro-systems. Modular electronics was
not a new idea, but it had never before
been adapted to ultra-small compo-
nents. A module consists of a number
of ceramic wafers about 0.3 inches on
a side which are stacked one on top
of the other to form a complete sub-
assembly. Each wafer itself may con-
tain nine or ten components and is
designed to perform a complete circuit
function. In other words one tiny wafer
might contain a complete audio ampli-
fier, oscillator, or pulse generator. By
engineering each wafer so that it oper-
ates as an independent unit, a very
high degree of interchangeability is
realized. The individual wafers may be
joined electrically by means of a series
18
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the wafers are stacked to form a mod-
ule, side "walls" are attached which
have tabs that correspond to the notch-
es on the wafer. These tabs are then
connected by a printed circuit on the
"wall." This method not only provides
foolproof electrical connection, but it
serves to hermetically seal the tiny
module.
A further advantage of these circuit
modules is their ability to operate effi-
ciently and accurately under many en-
vironmental conditions. Typical mod-
ules have been exposed to temperatures
ranging from — 55 to 85 degrees Centi-
grade. They have been subjected to
vibration, high altitude, shock, long
storage, saline atmosphere, and mois-
ture. In everv case, these severe condi-
tions seemed to impose no limitations
on their performance.
Also, by virtue of their small power
requirements, modules generate a very
slight amount of heat in comparison
with conventional electronic equip-
ment. This enables close spacing of
micro-miniature components, up to one
million per cubic foot. The need for
compactness is illustrated by the fact
that a B-58 jet bomber requires over
100,000 separate electronic devices as
compared to only 2,000 in the older
B-29 bomber.
From an engineering standpoint, it
appears that micro-miniaturization has
met the challenge of the electronic age.
However, where economy is a major
consideration, the cost of sub-miniature
circuit equipment may be prohibitive.
For example, a small circuit module
may cost anywhere from $25 to $125.
Consider now that a large computer
may use tens of thousands of these
modules. These high prices have al-
most eliminated true micro-miniatur-
ization from consumer products. It is
expected, however, that as manufactur-
ing techniques improve, and as compe-
tition increases, prices will drop to a
more realistic level.
Future
It is interesting to note some of the
long-range implications of micro-minia-
turization. What effect will these ultra-
small components have on future devel-
opments in the electronic field? On the
basis of present information, it is
conceivable that micro-electronics will
make possible previously unheard of
advancements in portable equipment.
For example, the Army has recently
introduced a transceiver which fits in
a standard battle helmet The unit is
completely within the helmet, no bat-
tery packs are necessary. Westinghouse
has been experimenting with a "Dick
Tracy" wrist transmitter. Texas Instru-
ment is presently working on a desk-
sized computer. Even the telephone may
be effected by micro-electronics. Bell
Telephone has begun a research pro-
gram on a new switching system which
uses a memory circuit to automatically
transfer calls to specified numbers, all
electronically, nearly ten times faster
than the present system. Of course, the
space program has found great use for
tiny electronic equipment in satellite
instrumentation and in rocket guidance
and control. International Business
Machines engineers and scientists are
evaluating micro-miniature equipment
which operates at temperatures near
absolute zero. These cryogenic devices
exploit the phenomenon of super-con-
ductivity. At these very low tempera-
tures currents can be turned on and off
in billionths of a second. Consider for
a moment that a computer which takes
a day or more to solve a complicated
problem may save several hours on the
same problem, if on each of the many
millions of operations an infinitesimal
fraction of a second is saved.
R.C.A. has designed Digital Evalu-
ation Equipment (DEE) for perform-
ing 84% of all standardized tests on
electronic systems. DEE is capable of
testing large electronic set-ups for
trouble; it first isolates then specifically
locates any malfunctions. Formerly, this
test equipment weighed more than ten
tons and was completely stationary.
Now the same system is about one-
eighth as large and can be easily ac-
commodated in a two ton truck. An-
other triumph of micro-electronics!
Recently, Dr. S. N. Herwald, West-
inghouse Vice President in charge of
research, demonstrated a phonograph
audio system in which the preamplifier
was the size of a match head and the
actual amplifier was smaller than a
dime. The system had a power rating
of five watts, sufficient to operate a
medium-sized high efficiency speaker.
Countless other examples of the
growing trend to micro-miniature de-
vices could be cited, but it appears
clear that this new concept and its di-
versified applications have contributed
immeasurably to the science of elec-
tronics. In the future, who knows? The
field seems almost unlimited. As manu-
facturing techniques are perfected and
production costs decline, it is expected
that micro-miniaturization will find a
place in consumer merchandising and
that the benefits of research in this
field will be available to everyone.

LEVACAR
m^rtiQ^iLis^sr,:'

Proposed 60 passenger vehicle. Note
the double deck seating arrangement
and the propellers at each end to al-
low travel in both directions.
IMAGINE that you are a businessman
in the year 1980. You find it neces-
sary to make a quick trip from your
office in Detroit to Chicago. Several
modes of travel are available, therefore
you request your secretary to make res-
ervations on the fastest and most con-
venient method. After checking airline
schedules you find that it requires 20
minutes to travel the 250 miles by jet,
however it requires 20 minutes to get
from your office to the airport and
another 30 minutes on the other end
to get from the airport to your destin-
ation.
Next you check the rail schedule.
Five minutes to the train station, 30
minutes to Chicago and, since the train
depot is in downtown Chicago, it re-
quires only 10 minutes more to reach
your destination. Since a train leaves
Detroit for Chicago every 80 minutes,
rail is obviously more convenient.
All arrangements having been made,
you prepare your brief case and head
for the station. The depot is a long
low air-conditioned building. A com-
puter controlled "scoreboard" gives
passengers an up-to-the-minute account
of train arrivals and departures. Your
ticket is purchased from an agent, but
your reservation is registered on a
computer, thus eliminating a great
source of confusion and error.
Two minutes before arrival time, you
step out to the concourse. Other trains
are moving on the sidings, but there is
no clatter of steel wheels on steel rails
as trains arrive and depart. One sound
prevails: the hiss of air moving at a
high velocity. Just as your two-minute
wait expires, you spot an incoming
train. This must be yours, right on
schedule. A long low nearly cylindrical
vehicle with streamlined nose floats to
a smooth halt in front of the dock. The
smooth stainless metal body has every
modern aerodynamic design feature.
The huge propeller standing above the
tail of the train catches your eye as
you glance toward the rear of the
train. Once inside you find your seat,
firm but comfortable just as on an air-
liner, but no seatbelt is necessary.
The interior of the train is brilliant-
ly lighted, capitalizing on an abundance
of wide windows and the latest in arti-
ficial lighting. Your seat is on the low-
er deck, but it makes no difference, the
upstairs is identical. You glance out
the window and notice the scenery rap-
idly slipping by. The start was so
smooth you didn't realize your jour-
ney had begun. You settle back in your
seat just as top speed is reached. You
cannot appreciate the scenery at 500
miles per hour so you relax with your
newspaper.
Non-stop to Chicago, your ride is air
smooth. No clacky-clack as the wheels
bump over the rail joints, no jerks, no
bumps, no jolts. In 30 minutes you
break to a gentle stop in Chicago. Your
trip was fast, comfortable, and relax-
ing. You have just ridden in a Levacar
vehicle.

GEMs
The businessman of the future de-
scribed above is not out of a science
fiction novel. Land speeds as high as
500 miles per hour are possible as a
result of the development of ground
effect machines (GEMs). Although
there are several different types of
GEMs they have one thing in common:
they all ride on a cushion of air. Cur-
rently there are six ways to lift an air
cushion vehicle each depending on the
maintenance of a slightly positive air
pressure under the vehicle. Five of the
methods allow the vehicle to travel
anywhere from a fraction of an inch
to a foot or more off the ground. Such
heights would lead to the design of a
vehicle that would travel over natural
terrain, bodies of water, and highways.
However, the sixth design is the one
we find in the railroad of the future.
Riding on a film of air only .010 inches
high, this GEM, developed by Ford
and called Levacar, is in a class by
itself. For various aerodynamic reasons,
the size of the higher riding GEMs is
crucially dependent on the size and
weight of the vehicle. However, size
of a Levacar vehicle is not dependent
on the cushion of air. Obviously be-
cause of the thin film supporting a
Levacar, travel over natural terrain
would be impossible, however, Levacar
is highly practical if it were riding on
rails. Also because vehicle size and air
film are independent, Levacar is very
suitable for a mass transport system,
such as the train of the future. Because
of high speeds, such a system will be
most useful on intermediate distance
runs from 100 to 1000 miles. Passen-
ger capacity will vary from 30 to 80
passengers and speeds will range from
150 to 500 miles per hour depending
on the distance of the run.
Development
The Levacar system was first con-
ceived about 1928 by Dr. Andrew A.
Kucher, now Ford Motor Company
Vice-president for Engineering and Re-
search. Kucher was aware that wheels
become unsatisfactory supports for ve-
hicles at speeds above 150 miles per
hour. At such speeds wheels lose trac-
tion and wear at unreasonably high
rates. It occurred to Kucher that slid-
ing would be the most likely substitute
for wheels. However, since sliding of
one surface on another at high speeds
is severely limited by friction, Kucher
proposed sliding on a film of air. He
recognized that air does not lubricate
in the sense we think of lubrication by
oils, instead, a film of air separates the
vehicle from the sliding surface, and
in effect lifts the vehicle from the sur-
face. This principle was classified as
a phenomenon of levitation.
In the design of a practical vehicle,
the first thing that had to be taken into
consideration was a method of estab-
lishing an air flow between the vehicle
and the sliding surface. The first at-
tempt led to a device that both lifted
and propelled the vehicle. In this par-
ticular model compressed air was forc-

The Deserfs Worst Enemy
Those soft summer breezes are sometimes not so
soft and enjoyable for desert dwellers.
by ERWIN K. KAUPER
A blast of sand, torn off the top of
a sheltering dune, sprayed over
the sleeping camp. This was the begin-
ning of a series of sand pricks that fi-
nally managed to wake the entire fam-
ily. What had been a beautiful clear
spring-time desert night now turned in-
to a hurrying swishing darkness. The
rest of the night was spent inside the
family station wagon listening to the
sand rattle off the sides of the vehicle.
We all know that wind is only
air in motion; and that air movement
is nature's way of keeping the atmos-
phere in balance. When low pressure
areas are created, either by the occur-
rence of a storm or the heating of the
air by contact with a hot surface such
as the desert floor, nature attempts to
fill these low pressure spots by bring-
ing in air from surrounding higher
pressure regions.
Unfortunately for the comfort of
our family, we chose a night when a
low pressure area began developing in
the desert eastward of the Sierra
Nevadas. This condition often occurs
when a Pacific storm front passes
across the barrier mountains into the
Great Basin. Typically, the wind se-
quence is a southerly wind, followed
by a shift to a northerly or westerly
wind as the storm front passes (see
Figure 1).
22
Actual direction of wind flow at a
given location depends on the local
topography. For example, the various
desert valleys tend to have winds blow-
ing along their axes, heading towards
the low pressure ends of these valleys.
The entire desert area of the South-
west is particularly subject to persist-
ent blows because of the arrangement
of north-south oriented mountains and
valleys. This orientation, crosswise to
the prevailing westerly wind flow
which is strongest in the cool months
of the year, allows for the formation
of lee-side low pressure areas, because
of the action of the westerlies blow-
ing over the mountain crests and en-
training some of the air up from the
lee-side valleys (Figure 2). This causes
a local depletion of air, hence a low-
ered pressure. When this pressure
change takes place within a relatively
short distance, a large pressure gradi-
ent is formed, and the result is strong
winds.
Because most of the winter storms
pass across the northern portion of the
continent, the nothern deserts, such as
those in Nevada and Utah, suffer nu-
merous "blows." The lower elevation
deserts along the southern border of
the United States experience relatively
fewer windstorms.
Early Fighter of Desert Supremacy
Men have fought the desert wind,
but they have never conquered it.
Some, such as the late O. J. Backus of
Mojave, Calif., made it an ally of
sorts. He settled in the Antelope Val-
ley in the early days, and being told
by neighbors that "the wind always
blows," Backus built a string of nine
windmills to utilize this free power
source. He soon realized that the wind
did not blow all of the time. Even in
the windy Mojave, the wind came in
cycles in response to the migrating
weather systems. His interest aroused
by this variation in the wind, he began
a study of the wind and desert weather
that led to his becoming one of the
country's outstanding Weather Bureau
Cooperative Observers.
Backus discovered that the Mojave's
hard steady winds came in March,
April and May in a definite yearly
pattern, with November receiving the
least amount of wind movement. How-
ever, big blows are likely to occur at
any time.
Harry C. James, the eminent author
and conservationist, adds this to our
knowledge of desert air movement: "I
have noticed this about winds in the
deserts: often a very slight shift in
position will make a terrific difference
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


time we have camped at places where
by moving our fireplace just a dozen
feet or so we would be able to have
a cooking fire that would be free from
gusts."
The continuing settlement of the
Desert Southwest has caused air move-
ment to become more and more of a
problem as increased numbers of man-
built objects are exposed to the winds'
wrath. As agriculture spreads with the
development of water supplies, farms
encroach on dune areas. Sometimes the
wind returns the desert to its suprem-
acy in such places, driving the dunes
of shifting sand back over the works
of man, as was the case years ago at
some of the date groves near Indio on
California's Low Desert.
There are certain desert areas with
wind conditions that try the treasuries
of the automobile insurance compa-
nies, for here cars are sand-blasted
during windy nip-ups. Perhaps the
most infamous of these places is the
Whitewash area, along U.S. Highway
99 west of Indio (Figure 3). Here
two factors combine to provide a
heavy windshield replacement and re-
painting expense: much automotive
traffic and even more wind.
The traffic increases yearly, the wind,
thankfully, remains relatively constant.
Unfortunately, it is constantly too
strong. This wind is the result of air
being forced through the constriction
of San Gorgonio Pass and rushing
down to the trough occupied by the
Salton Sea. Wind in this area is a
classic example of a mountain jet. The
obstructing mountains on both sides
of the Pass force the main mass of
the normally eastward-flowing air to
funnel between them. In the Pass area
the air must speed up in order to al-
low the same volume of air to move
through the constriction as it is push-
ing into the western approaches to the
Pass. The wind, however, is actually
stronger below the Pass at the eastern
portal near Whitewater than directly
in the throat of the Pass. Here an
added effect is at work. Air from aloft
is brought close to the surface because
of the downward component of the
flow down the lee-side of the moun-

flo»

strong local winds.

ACCUTRON
A new concept in portable time pieces developed by
Bulova utilizes a tuning fork as the time standard.
by DAVE PATT
Horology—the science of measuring
time—has held men's interest since the
first primitive man watched the chang-
ing length of the shadow of a tree.
The sun dial, the smouldering rope, the
notched candle, the water clock, the
hour glass, and the pendulum clock
were each an improvement over its
predecessor as a means of measuring
time. Recently the quartz crystal clock
and the various atomic clocks have
greatly improved the accuracy with
which we are able to measure time.
However, until recently, no similar
advances in basic principle have been
made in the field of portable time-
pieces; the balance wheel and hair-
spring, invented over three hundred
years ago, are still used as the time
standard in most modern watches.
True, improvements have been made in
modern watches; they have become
smaller, more accurate, and more re-
liable. The self-compensating hair-
spring, the waterproof case, the self-
winding mechanism, the unbreakable
crystal, and the use of batteries as a
power source all represent improve-
ments. But these are improvements in
technique, not in principle.
Now, the Accutron, recently an-
nounced by the Bulova Watch Com-
pany, represents a new principle in the
field of horology. It does away with
the traditional balance wheel and hair-
spring and uses, instead, a tuning fork
as its time standard. As a result, the
Accutron is simpler, more durable,
and more accurate than conventional
watches.
Operating Principles
A transistorized pulser, powered by
a tiny mercury cell, provides regularly
timed surges of current which cause a
small tuning fork to vibrate at a fixed
frequency. One tine of this fork is
linked by a ratchet and pawl indexing
mechanism to a conventional gear train
which drives the hands. This, in short,
is the basic idea of Accutron. However,
to better understand the unique fea-
tures of this watch, we must consider
each part separately.
The Tuning Fork
The fundamental difference between
the Accutron and a conventional watch
lies in the use of a tuning fork in place
of a balance wheel, hairspring, and es-
capement. There are three basic diffi-
culties associated with the balance
wheel and hairspring mechanism:
1. The accuracy varies in different posi-
tions. 2. The accuracy varies as the
amplitude of oscillation changes be-
cause of variation of mainspring ten-
sion and sensitivity to the motions of
the wearer. 3. Normal wear and chang-
es in condition of the lubricants re-
quired for the balance wheel pivots
and other associated drive mechanisms
upset accuracy.
But, tuning forks, whose period of
vibration depends only on the material
24
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


physical dimensions, have long been
recognized by physicists as a stable
frequency standard. Thus, the Accu-
tron has a time standard which is
practically unaffected by wear, changes
of position, and temperature.
The Indexing Mechanism
The exact operation of the indexing
mechanism should be understood to
appreciate the reliability of the entire
system. Because of motion, shock, and
other environmental effects, it is not
possible to maintain an exact ampli-
tude for the vibrations of the tuning
fork (though the period remains un-
affected). The indexing mechanism il-
lustration shows how Accutron com-
pensates for this variation. Figures A,
B, and C illustrate the action of the
mechanism when the amplitude of the
tuning fork is such that the index jew-
el picks up only one tooth on the drive
gear. Figures D, E and F illustrate the
operation of the mechanism when the
amplitude of the tuning fork is dou-
bled. Note that the indexing jewel
still picks up only one tooth on the
drive gear. Figures G and H show what
happens when the amplitude is tripled.
In this case, the index wheel picks up
all three teeth. It can be seen that for
any amplitude from just over one tooth
to just under three teeth the drive
wheel advances only one tooth. The
pawl jewel in the illustration acts as
a ratchet and also provides a backing
force which presses the drive gear firm-
ly against the index jewel.
The Pulser Circuit
Before discussing the pulser, we
should have another look at the tuning
fork assembly. Mounted at the end of
each tine is a cup shaped device made
of a magnetic material, and inside each
of these cups is a conical magnet. Two
coils of wire, mounted on the base of
the watch, extend into the space be-
tween the magnets and the cups. Con-
sequently, if a current is passed through
one of these coils, it will attract or
repel its associated cup. Conversely,
when the fork vibrates, a current is
induced in the coils. This means that
as the fork vibrates, an alternating volt-
age is induced in the coils. This voltage
is a direct measure of the amplitude of
vibration of the tuning fork and allows

Pictorial drawing illustrating the basic principle of the Accutron.
the pulser to sense and control the
amplitude of vibration. Also, one of
the drive coils is divided into two
sections, a drive coil and a phase sens-
ing coil.
To understand the operation of the
pulser in detail, refer to the schematic
diagram. A transistor may be thought
of as a mechanical relay; though, of
course, it is an electronic device and
has no moving parts. It consists of
three sections: the base, the emitter,
and the collector respectively indicated
on schematic diagrams as B, E, and C.
When the base to emitter leads are
supplied with a current, the emitter to
collector circuit will conduct. In other
words, the base to emitter circuit can
be compared to the coil of a relay and
the emitter to collector circuit can be
likened to the contacts of the relay.
The capacitor, shown on the left with
a resistor connected in parallel, is the
element which maintains the transistor
in a non-conducting condition for most
of the cycle of operation of the tuning
fork. As previously explained, an alter-
nating voltage is induced in the phase
coil by the vibrations of the tuning
fork. Through the base circuit of the
transistor, which acts as a diode and
only passes voltage in one direction,
this voltage is added to the power cell
to charge the capacitor, which functions
as a storage tank for electricity. The
resistor across the capacitor causes a
slight leak with the result that the
capacitor wil be re-charged slightly
once each cycle by the peaks of alter-
nating current induced in the phase
coil. These re-charging pulses cause the
transistor to conduct momentarily and
allow current to flow in the drive coils
to pulse the tuning fork and maintain
its vibrations.
The transistor conducts when the
voltages induced in the coils are at
their maximum values and when the
drive coil induced voltage is opposite
in sign to the power cell voltage.
Therefore, if the amplitude of the tun-
ing fork should be such that at the
instant the transistor becomes conduct-
ing, the induced voltage in the drive
coils exactly equals the power cell volt-
age, no current would flow, since the
two voltages would cancel each other.
At the proper amplitude of vibration
for the tuning fork, the voltage in-
duced in the drive coils has a value
about 10 per cent less than the power
cell voltage. Consequently, a 10 per
cent increase in amplitude, resulting
from a disturbance of any kind, would
cause the driving current pulses to re-
duce to zero and the fork would rapid-
ly return to its proper amplitude. Also,
a 10 per cent decrease in amplitude
would cause the driving current pulses
to double and again return the tuning
fork amplitude to its proper value.
Advantages
In a conventional wrist watch, a
relatively high torque is transmitted by
the drive train wheels. As a result, the
mechanism wears and the accuracy of
the watch suffers. In the Accutron the
train does not transmit high torque,
consequently wear is practically elim-
inated. As mentioned before, the Accu-
tron eliminates other inherent dis-
advantages of the balance wheel and
hairspring.
Thus, the Accutron represents an in-
genious blending of physics, electron-
ics, and plain old watchmaker's skill.

NEW COURSE
A new course for naval architecture
and marine engineering students who
intend to concentrate on research and
development work has been establish-
ed at The University of Michigan.
This is the first time such a course
has been offered in the United States.
To be called Maritime Engineering
Science, it will be offered in addition
to the traditional options in naval arch-
itecture and marine engineering which
are already part of the U-M program.
Object of the new series is to pro-
vide the maritime field with more
broadly-trained and highly-skilled
graduates to work in research and de-
velopment. Students selected for the
program will be of high scholastic
ability. They will be expected to spend
an extra semester in school to earn a
second bachelor's degree in either
mathematics or engineering mechanics,
and to undertake some graduate work.
Many of the traditional, highly spe-
cialized courses required by the other
two options—such as certain design
courses—have been discarded in the
new program to allow a broader train-
ing in fundamentals. Instead of these
established courses, Maritime Engineer-
ing Science students will study more
mathematics and take technical elec-
tives in such areas as operations re-
search, control systems, instrumenta-
tion, nuclear engineering, and digital
and analog computer application.
The many new developments in the
maritime industry make necessary the
training of students who will be able
to work effectively in areas somewhat
apart from those for which they are
now being trained in traditional pro-
grams.
BALLOON TEST
Modified and improved heat meas-
uring instruments will be lifted over
100,000 feet into the sky by a 16-story -
high balloon scheduled to be launched
by University of Michigan engineers
this week.
The instruments, identical to those
carried by the Tiros weather satellite,
have been improved in accuracy and
mounted so they can scan from horizon
to horizon. In earlier balloon flights,
the instruments were fixed in one posi-
tion. Launched this summer, this was
the third of a series of three flights to
help measure and improve the per-
formance of Tiros infrared and photo-
graphic instrumentation. The projects
are carried out by the High Altitude
Engineering Laboratory, of the U-M
Department of Aeronautical and Astro-
nautical Engineering.
The 159-foot balloon was launched
from near Sioux Falls, South Dakota,
and was carried some 300 miles west-
ward by prevailing summer winds. Ear-
lier flights, last September and Novem-
ber, carried eastward and the second
landed in Michigan. Corrections have
been made in some of the instruments
found defective in the last flight.
Only 60 per cent of the data from
that flight was useful. Two of five ra-
diometer (instruments to measure ra-
diant energy) channels were affected by
changes in the temperature of the in-
struments.
The unmanned balloon carries its
250 pound payload instruments in a
55-inch diameter, 25-inch high magne-
sium gondola.
The gondola and instruments are
parachuted to earth and recovered at
the end of the flight.
A specially instrumented U-M bus
follows the balloons and receives ra-
dioed data during the flight.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Using facilities at the Institute of
Science and Technology at The Uni-
versity of Michigan, a graduate stu-
dent has turned an engineers' head-
ache into the heart of an idea for a
highly compact and powerful rocket
engine.
Called a "rotating detonation en-
gine," the theoretical design was de-
veloped by Gary L. Cosens, a doctoral
student in aeronautical engineering. For
years, engineers have had to contend
with detonation waves in rocket en-
gines. When these occur at random be-
cause of design defects, their extra heat
can literally slice the engine apart
like a cutting torch.
Cosens' find is called "rotating det-
onation engine" because it uses the det-
onation wave to burn fuels both faster
and hotter as the wave travels around
the engine. Considerably more thrust
for a combustion chamber of given size
could thus be produced.
Theoretically Cosens' design could
yield an engine of one and a half
million pounds of thrust in a "deton-
able area" of just 1.4 (one and four
tenths) square feet. (Detonable area is
the cross sectional area of the combus-
tion front.) With an overall diameter
of six feet, this engine would be con-
siderably smaller than the mighty F-l
engine, now in the early development
stage, which would have about a mil-
lion and a half pounds thrust in a
single chamber engine. For comparison
with a currently operational power
plant, a rotating detonation engine
with the same power as the Atlas'
300,000 pounds thrust would be only
one third the size of the Atlas engine.
Cosens has built, and run for intervals
of less than a second, a small model
of a rotating detonation engine. Much
experimental verification remains, how-
ever.
Besides being lighter and more pow-
erful than conventional power plants,
there are many other advantages to his
system, according to Cosens. "One big
advantage is that you would be able
to 'size' the system," he explained. "Be-
cause of combustion instabilities in a
standard engine, you build them and
hope they work. No one knows how
to accurately account for these insta-
bilities. There is no question of com-
bustion instability here. So we believe
that with a little study on this engine
we will be able to design to any thrust
level we want."
It should be cheaper, too, because its
development time should be shorter
than for standard engines. Further,
there would be no restarting problems
with this engine, and that guidance
would be easier. Standard engines are
mounted on gimbals that swivel them
for guidance, or "steering," as an out-
board boat motor is turned to direct
a boat. With this engine, you could
guide the vehicle by differentially vary-
ing the pressure. In other words, you
could turn by making the engine "push
harder" on one side than on the other.
Basically the engine works like this:
Fuel and oxidizer are mixed and ig-
nited in a detonation tube. The result-
ing detonation wave propagates in a
combustion chamber with a circular
"plug" in the middle, so that the
chamber could be thought of as a cir-
cular race track. The detonation wave
enters tangent to the circular track and
races around it. (Whence the name—
"rotating detonation engine.")
At the same time, more of the fuel
and oxidizer are poured into the com-
bustion chamber through several injec-
tors spaced around the chamber. The
gases enter the chamber just behind the
detonation wave, where they are ignit-
ed by the same wave on its next rev-
olution.
The engine's superior capability is
provided by the high temperature of
the shock wave, which ignites the fuel
mixture. This temperature is about
2,400 degrees (K) (about 4500°F),
which gives the more rapid ignition
and combustion. It provides something
over 100 (one hundred) times the
burning rate of standard rocket en-
gines, Cosens estimates.
The "extra" heat burns more fuel
faster—thus giving this engine extra
power compared to standard engines.
In standard engines in which the det-
onation wave is not controlled, it may
arise at random in various parts of the
combustion chamber and cut the effi-
ciency of the engine—if it doesn't de-
stroy it entirely.

Making an adjustment on the test model of a powerful "rotating detonation"
engine he devised is Gary L. Cosens, a graduate student in aeronautical engi-
neering at The University of Michigan.

ANTI-SMOG MUFFLER
A new type of stainless steel for au-
tomobile mufflers looks like it might
bring anti-smog devices closer to reality
—quicker.
Most major metropolitan areas, and
particularly Los Angeles, are plagued
with a form of smog caused by the
emission of unburned fuel (hydrocar-
bons) from motor vehicle exhausts.
California already has statutes on the
books for the use of new devices which
will consume practically all of this un-
burned fuel. While these laws are on
the books at the present time, they do
not become effective until at least two
devices have been approved by the Mo-
tor Vehicle Pollution Control Board.
This new muffler-like item is called an
anti-smog device. While other states
besides California are talking about
such devices for cars, they are taking
a "wait and let's see what happens in
California" attitude.
The new stainless steel, called MF-1,
was developed for use in automotive
mufflers—a close, but not as hard-work-
ing, cousin of the anti-smog device.
Both mufflers and anti-smog devices
have much the same problems—corro-
sion and heat. MF-1 combats both of
these problems and is a relatively in-
expensive metal.
Because of space limitations, an anti-
smog device will likely replace the con-
32
ventional acoustic muffler. The resist-
ance to corrosion and heat of MF-1 and
its attractive price makes this material
an ideal choice for anti-smog devices
as well as for mufflers. The California
State Board of Health has established
limitations of 275 parts-per-million of
hydrocarbons, and one-and one-half per
cent by volume of carbon monoxide in
the exhaust of automobiles. This re-
quires an anti-smog device to do a big
job for a long period of time.
There are two methods of removing
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide
from the exhaust gases of automobiles.
One is the catalytic type which passes
the exhaust gases through a bed of
chemically-treated pellets before emit-
ting them to the atmosphere. This sys-
tem has low initial cost, but suffers a
gradual deterioration in activity, and
requires periodic replacement of the
catalytic pellets. The other type is the
direct-flame afterburner which employs
high temperature to burn the hydro-
carbons and carbon monoxide contain-
ed in the exhaust gases. This system has
a higher initial cost, but is not subject
to performance deterioration and,
therefore, does not need periodic re-
placement of any components. The cat-
alytic system would operate between
800° and 1500 F, whereas the temper-
ature of the flame-type afterburner
would be in excess of 1500°F.
MF-1 stainless steel is being tested
for use in both catalytic and direct
flame afterburner anti-smog devices. In
some of the tests the stainless steel
parts make up virtually the entire de-
vice; in others only the most corrosive
parts are made of stainless steel.
If all cars were properly adjusted
and maintained, and if these cars were
operated at steady cruise, there would
be no need for anti-smog devices. But,
most automobiles operate fuel-rich over
a wide range of driving conditions,
including idle, acceleration and decel-
eration as well as cruise. When this
happens, hydrocarbons and carbon
monoxide are spewed from automo-
biles into the air which we breathe.
Too much of this—from too many cars
—and we have trouble!
GLASS DELAY LINES
Glass ultrasonic delay lines that serve
as high-speed digital memories for
computers and data processing equip-
ment have been developed. Serial mem-
ories have been built that exhibit in-
formation rates of 3 to 20 megabits
per second, comparable to rates of thin
film, cryogenic and tunnel diode mem-
ory devices. Delay times as high as 150
microseconds have been achieved with
the Corning product.
Leading to the development was a
digital mode ultrasonic line that serves

speed transportation system that will be
automatic and practically noiseless.
Construction is now being planned by
leading U.S. cities to provide efficient,
low-cost urban transit. Lightweight
Monorail design demands strong,
weight-saving metals. Logical choice:
Nickel-containing materials such as
nickel steels for the basic structure,
nickel steel castings for underframes,
trucks, other load-bearing assemblies.
And Nickel Stainless Steel is a natural
for skin and trim on cars—its excellent
strength-to-weight ratio permits thin-
ner gauge body shells for dead-weight
reduction, its handsome finish stays
virtually maintenance-free.
How Inco Nickel helps engineers make new designs possible and practical
When engineers design a transit
system, a nuclear ocean liner, or a
gas-turbine car, chances are Nickel,
or one of its alloys can help the equip-
ment perform better. Nickel-contain-
ing metals can provide valuable
combinations of corrosion resistance,
ductility, workability, and strength
at extreme high and low tempera-
tures. Over the years, Inco has
developed new alloys and gathered
data on the performance of materials
under demanding service conditions.
This data is available to help solve
future metal problems.

material tough enough to maintain pre-
cision in the rotating mechanism even

used in steel members provided high
strength at minimum weight to support

advantage of the unusual magnetic be-
havior of a twisted high-nickel alloy

alloy shifts magnetization direction
from longitudinal to a helical path.

ed through tiny holes in the flat bot-
tom of the model, but the diffusion
was so great that the designers adopted
methods that channeled the air to se-
lected points. They also came to the
conclusion that they would need sep-
arate power systems for propulsion and
levitation.
Levapads
Out of the attempts to channel the
air came a device called the levapad.
In its simplest form the levapad con-
sists of a flat plate with a hole in the
center through which air is forced.
The air then flows under the surface
and creates the necessary film. How-
ever, this simple form was very ineffi-
cient because a high pressure prevailed
at the center, but the pressure was sub-
stantially lower throughout the support
area. To increase the efficiency a larger
center pressure area was needed.
Several types of levapads have now
proved satisfactory. The porous-center
bearing consists of a porous plate
through which the air is forced. This
provides frictional flow control
throughout the entire center area and
leads to a more uniform pressure dis-
tribution throughout the center area.
Another type is the orfice-slot bearing.
This levapad utilizes a thin slot of or-
fice dimensions that provides a constant
pressure ring. By means of choke flow
control a constant pressure is maintain-
ed throughout the area inside of the
pressure ring. A third type known as
the pool-bearing, makes use of a large
center cavity under the air jet. The
large center volume equalizes the pres-
sures within its confines. However, the
large volume of air in the pool-bearing,
gives it a tendency to vibrate. To mini-
mize the vibration, a solid was inserted
to reduce the volume and reduce the
vibration. The pool-bearing with a
solid insert is called the modified pool-
bearing.
Riding on Rails
Obviously in a large mass transport
vehicle, one levapad will not suffice. It
is necessary to place several pads at
strategic points under the vehicle. On
rails "slipper assemblies" rather than
individual pads will be used. The com-
bination levapads will not only provide
the required support, but will also tend
to eliminate any tendency for the ve-
hicle to derail and will provide lateral
guidance.
Although the assemblies can be made
to fit coventional rails, the shape would
be necessarily complex. Therefore in a
Levacar system, rails of square, rectan-
gular, or triangular cross section will
probably be used. One theoretical de-
sign conceives of a hollow, square cross
section with six inch external sides and
a wall thickness of .25 inches. Because
of the high speeds and the necessity

■miFlB WOL KWIvr,
Four general types of Levapads.
of keeping rails clear, it will be essen-
tial that the Levacar rail system be sub-
stantially elevated from the ground. In
such a system using the square rail, the
supports prove to be rather simple be-
cause the vehicle, even of large passen-
ger capacity, would be relatively light-
weight. All that would be necessary
for rail installation would be I-Beam
posts sunk in concrete blocks spaced
with pre-cut pieces of angle iron and
the rails attached with prefabricated
brackets.
There seems to be a popular concep-
tion that a Levacar system would be a
monorail affair. Although there is no
reason why a monorail could not be
constructed, the only popular reason in
favor of a monorail is its eye appeal.
However, most popular concepts are
based on artist's sketches which do not
feature accurate proportions. A mono-
rail system designed on sound engi-
neering calculations loses a large per-
centage of its eye appeal. Because a
monorail Levacar system would neces-
sitate an expensive stabilizing device,
current designs rely on a birail system.
The slippers designed to ride on the
rail are also quite simple. The main
frame of the vehicle would be con-
structed of steel pipe, which would
serve both as structural support and to
distribute air to the levapads. The
main component of the slipper would
be a frame attached to the vehicle
frame by a pair of torsion bars and a
pair of shackle coupled double leaf
springs. The torsion bars would permit
the slipper to move in two directions
thus permitting it to adjust to any ir-
regularity in rail alignment. The air
would be fed to each levapad through
a flexible tube from the pipe frame
work. Levapads would be placed on
both the top and side of the rail to
provide lateral guidance and vertical
support. To prevent derailment, a strip
of brake material would be attached to
the slipper frame as a safety pad.
To stop the vehicle, reverse thrust
is first applied that would slow the ve-
hicle to about 100 miles per hour. Once
below this speed, brake shoes would
clamp on the rail thus transferring the
load from the levapad to the brake
shoes. Friction brakes the vehicle in
the conventional manner. One advan-
tage of such a braking system would
be the minimization of rail wear be-
cause heat will not accumulate as the
vehicle slides ahead.
Vehicle Design
Once the levitation system has been
developed it is necessary to design the
vehicle. Because the vehicle is essen-
tially traveling independent of the
ground, aerodynamic principles must
be observed. One of the first experi-
mental designs by Ford engineers was
a four passenger model propelled by
a turbo-prop engine with an open pro-
peller at the rear of the vehicle. The
four passengers were seated in tandem
with the fuel tank located in front of
the passengers and both engines lo-
cated towards the rear of the vehicle.
Propulsion was accomplished by a 7
foot diameter, three bladed propeller
powered by a 397 horsepower turbo-
prop engine. Air for levitation was pro-
duced by a 201 horsepower gas turbine
compressor. The length of the vehicle
was 26'-6" with a width of 5'-0" and a
34
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


3200 pounds with a payload of 680 and
fuel load of 297. The speed was 250
miles per hour with a range of 125
miles. The turbo compressor delivered
2.1 lbs /sec of air at 49.7 psia.
Of interest is the method of placing
the rails above the bottom of the ve-
hicle to minimize the overturning mo-
ment of the vehicle on curves. By plac-
ing the level of the rails sufficiently
close to the center of gravity, the neces-
sity for banking the track was elimi-
nated and the vehicle was capable of
traveling around curves up to its de-
sign speed without any banking.
Obviously a four passenger vehicle
would be hardly practical, therefore the
problem was projected to a 40 passen-
ger vehicle. Based on present knowl-
edge, the vehicle would be 66'0" long
and 12'-0" wide. Its weight would be
34,000 pounds gross, with a payload of
15,900 and a fuel capacity of 6,850
pounds. A turbo-prop engine with a 12
foot diameter three bladed reversible
propeller would provide a speed of
270 miles per hour with a range of
500 miles. The turbo-compressor would
deliver 20 lbs/sec of air at 56 psia.
With the above vehicle in mind it
is not difficult to conceive of an 80
passenger model traveling at speeds of
500 miles per hour. At the specified
speeds human reactions are much too
slow to afford adequate safe control.
Therefore, automatic methods must be
devised for controlling the vehicle.
Such automatic methods could also be
used to govern speed to insure the
maintenance of rigid schedules. Be-
cause the machine is automatically con-
trolled and because of the nature of the
levapads, the vehicle would be inde-
pendent of weather. Thus a serious
drawback of air travel would be elim-
inated.
Another advantage of the system
would be greater safety. Any failure
in levitation equipment would not re-
sult in mass slaughter of passengers as
in airplane failures. The vehicle oper-
ates nearly at ground level, therefore
any failure would permit the vehicle
to slide to a stop. From full speed it
would reach a stop in less than two
miles. The metal surfaces of the leva-
pads are constructed so that they will

last for seven miles of sliding before
total failure occurs.
Because Levacar is basically an air-
craft without wings and tail, wind drag
and vehicle weight are substantially re-
duced. Additional weight reduction
results from supporting the fuselage
weight throughout its length. Power
required for levitation is roughly equal
to the power required to overcome the
drag of wings and empennage at 125
miles per hour. Since power to over-
come wind drag increases with the cube
of the velocity and levitation power is
virtually independent of velocity, con-
siderable savings in power requirements
are effected by use of the levapads.
To propel the vehicle any of the con-
ventional aircraft propulsion methods
arc feasible. Ducted fans, propellors or
jets can be conceivably used. Present
plans call for experimental models em-
ploying a combination turbo-prop en-
gine to provide propulsion and a turbo-
compressor to supply levitation.
The Future
The advantages of a Levacar system
are obvious. Although there is not yet
a full scale prototype, Ford research is
rapidly progressing toward that end.
Extensive experimental analysis has
been carried out on the levapads and
their behavior at high speeds has been

as a lOO-microsecond memory in a 10-
20 megabit digital computer subsystem.
The line was made of Code 8875 glass
which has a nominal temperature co-
efficient of the time delay of zero. Ad-
vantages of glass ultrasonic delay line
memories—besides speed—are stability,
simplicity, economy, and ease of oper-
ation, according to Corning.
The first commercial product is a
memory element that operates dynam-
ically in the return-to-zero mode at
data rates between 10 and 20 megabits
per second and with a delay time of
50 microseconds. The delay medium is
the "zero TC" glass which will accept
a bit length of 20 nanoseconds.
Fused Silica (Corning Code 7940
glass) can also be used as a medium
for digital delay lines, the company
said. It has an advantage for longer
lines because its attenuation coefficient
is l/40th that of the zero TC glass.
However, its TC time of delay is
80 ppm/ C. Thus, Fused Silica ele-
ments must be operated under temper-
ature control.
While current glass ultrasonic digital
delay lines are restricted to delay time
of less than 150 microseconds, engi-
neers foresee the possibility of achiev-
ing delay times as high as 500 micro-
seconds. Effective compensation for
signal corruption already has been
achieved in lines shorter than 150
microseconds.
It is reported that ceramic transdu-
cers are available for delay line mem-
ories operating at 15 megacycles or
less. Lines with ceramic transducers
exhibit far less a signal attenuation
than lines with quartz crystal trans-
ducers. Multiple transducers made of
either quartz or ceramic can be utilized
on memory elements to stimulate mul-
tiple-channel characteristics of magnetic
drums and discs.
AIR CONDITIONED
FURNACES
Power plant operators are using por-
table, van-sized air conditioners to cool
furnaces and boilers that are shut down
for repairs. The machines cut cooling
time by two-thirds, enable repairs to
start with almost no delay and get
equipment back in operation fast.
NEW MOTOR?
An AC timing motor which has no
slippage, stops without coasting, and is
instantaneously reversible without re-
course to mechanical no-back devices.
A truly synchronous motor which pro-
vides instantaneous reversal, the new
46100 Series delivers 30 ounce-inches
of torque in either direction at 1 rpm,
and may be used in any situation re-
quiring utmost precision in operation.
No external breaks, quenching circuits,
or phase shift networks are required
with this motor.
Designed initially for computer ap-
plications, the new motor has already
found wide use in connection with
printed circuitry, potentiometer drives,
and related devices with sharply defin-
ed parameters. Engineers claim that it
should be ideal for any industrial ap-
plications requiring fast starting and
stopping, or operation without slip-
page, since the new device eliminates
these problems which are common to
hysteresis-type motors.
Weighing only eight ounces, the mo-
tor is available for operation on 115
volt, 50 or 60 cps power supplies,
and is offered in 150 different output
speeds, ranging from 300 rpm to 1/6
rph. The motor is operable in tempera-
tures ranging from —10CF to -j-1800F,
and is offered with a choice of eight
different output shafts. The motor it-
self consists of a permanent magnet
rotor and an electromagnetic stator
with two coils, direction of operation
depending upon the coil energized.

tains. The net result is the famous
Whitewater blows.
The Dust Devil
On hot summer days, dancing cones
of madly swirling wind, outlined by
flying sand and dust, provide a specta-
cle that has amazed desert man from
earliest times. A watching Navajo In-
dian would recognize it as the nadzi-
yoldisito. To the Spanish Conquesta-
dor it was the remolino movil de arena.
We know it as the dust devil or whirl-
wind. All these terms are fully descrip-
tive.
However, the nature of the dust
devil as deduced by an observer is de-
pendent on the point-of-view of the
beholder. This is true for all of nature,
of course, but is particularly so for
such an ethereal object that has its
feet on the ground and its head in the
heavens.
Air behaving in such an unusual
manner certainly caught the supersti-
tious imagination of the Indians who
lived in the Southwest. To them the
whirlwind was a form of evil, the
same connotation that remains in our
term, the dust devil.
The concepts held by the Indian have
been replaced by the understanding of
meteorological science, but still much
of the dust devil's nature is not com-
pletely understood. To an earthbound
mortal the dust devil appears as a
small cone or tube of spinning air,
made visible by the dust it has been
able to pick up. When the paths of
devil and man cross, man recognizes
that strong buffeting wind is charac-
teristic of the devil. This is what causes
the dust to be raised and suspended
in the air.
Resemblance to Tornadoes
A strong family resemblance exists
between the desert dust devil and the
tornado of the middle and eastern Unit-
ed States. Both have the characteristic
spinning motion of the air contained
within their circumferences. However,
the tornado is, in size and destructive-
ness, a granddaddy dust devil. Wind
speeds up to 170 miles per hour have
been measured, compared with the 20-
40 mile per hour speed of the wind in a
dust devil. The difference in intensity
is due to the greater instability of the
air mass that is able to spawn torna-
does. The tornado air is moist so that
any lifting of the air causes condensa-
tion which usually results in thunder-
clouds. A moist air mass is potentially

Dr. Werner Spilger's proposed machine
to harness the energy of dust devils.

tained, the motor would be turned off
and the rising column of hot air would

drawings).
more unstable than a dry one, such as
those over the desert. Therefore the
ordinary dust devil is doomed to re-
main a pigmy tornado, since there is
no supply of moist air to aid in its
further development.
The dust devil is born in the up-
ward moving air of thermals. When
a mass of air is locally heated beyond
endurance it shakes itself free of the
surface heat source and seeks a cooler
environment aloft. When this takes
place slowly, smoothly and over a rela-
tively large area, a thermal occurs. At
times, however, the low pressure cre-
ated by the rising air is sufficient to
cause a sudden inflow of air at the
surface. This creates a situation where
air is coming together from all points
of the compass. A traffic jam is avoided
by the competing air streams finding
an accommodation. The result is a
turning of the wind, forming a circu-
lation, either clockwise or counter-
clockwise in direction. The core of this
circulation is relatively calm, an area
of transition of wind direction. As
the column of heated air continues to
rise, this circulation rises also. Finally
the fully developed dust devil is in
operation; hot air is feeding into the
bottom of the system, rising, and being
removed from the top by diverging
winds aloft.
The dust devil will continue as long
as there is a supply of hot air available
on the desert floor, and a dispersion of
air aloft. Should either of these condi-
tions no longer exist, the dust devil
will subside and die.
Harnessing the Dust Devil
While a storm of very local nature,
the dust devil obviously represents a
considerable amount of energy. Man,
who has been ingenious enough to
develop windmills to utilize some of
the energy of the normal steady-state
wind, has turned to the intriguing
possibility of domesticating the whirl-
wind.
Dr. Werner Spilger, a former Ger-
man meteorologist and physicist now
serving in a research capacity with a
Southern California electronics firm,
has developed this idea and is con-
vinced that the energy of the dust
devil could be successfully tapped
(Figure 4).
He proposes to cause the dust devils
and thermals that occur in a random
manner over the desert floor to be
concentrated at a specific point. To
do this he would put a large fan in
operation directing a stream of air
(Continued on pJge 42)
OCTOBER, 1961

(Continued from page 41)
vertically. The fan would be turned
on at a time when the air, due to in-
tense surface heating, was approaching
instability. The inauguration of an ar-
tificial thermal, or body of rising air,
just prior to the occurrence of natural
thermals would cause the energy nor-
mally available to the widespread nat-
ural thermals to be concentrated at
the location of the artificial one. As
air is lifted by the fan the surround-
ing air would move in at ground level
and up into the vertical current. At
this point the fan that supplied the
initial energy to the air would be re-
moved from its power source and the
energy of the sustained upward-moving
air would continue to drive the fan.
This would then be energy available
for beneficial use, much like that sup-
plied by a windmill.
The dust devil, a minor player on
nature's stage, has continued from the
beginnings of the earth's atmosphere
to exhibit its essential spirit, unchang-
ed by the calumnies leveled against it
by various tribes of the genus man.
However, the picture held in the eye
of the beholder has changed—from an
incarnate evil spirit to a column of
heated air escaping from the earth's
hot surface. And with this change has
come a threat to the whirlwind's free-
dom. The future generation of dust
devils may well find themselves do-
mesticated by man in his quest for
new sources of energy.
When the wind storm has passed
and the dust clouds settle slowly over
the land, the desert turns its best face
outward. Then it is, between outbursts
of its windy temper, that the desert
allows its inhabitants to enjoy their
most peaceful days. But these are not
days when weather forecasters prowl
the land. We know such days exist for
the records left by men such as Backus
tell us so. Should you ask a certain
forecaster's family, however, they will
tell you that there are no such days
in the desert. This they know from
long personal experience.

with respect to your career choice?
Of course, you are ... and should be. But don't
overlook the fact that "thinking big" really applies
to your own personal growth and achievement—
and not necessarily to the physical size of an
organization. And that's an important reason for
investigating the opportunities here at Sikorsky
Aircraft.
We believe that our company offers just the
"right-sized" environment for young engineers
seeking strong personal identification and stature
opportunities. The technical talent we require can
enjoy diversified activities in a field that permits
full expression of engineering imagination and
professional competence.
At Sikorsky, we pioneered helicopters. Our
continuing objective is to further advance V ,'STOL
(vertical short take-off and landing) aircraft.
The engineering programs are stimulating and
far-ranging. Assignments could include joining an
electronic team of twenty to thirty associates—or—
working with a highly selective group of four or
five on sophisticated problems of antenna radiation,
instrumentation, automatic pilot, automatic stabi-
lization—to name a few.
Your opportunity for personal growth could be

What is the quotient?
Answers to Teasers for Oct.
SOLUTION: $2.10
Let X equal the number of divi-
dends paid by Impact Airlines, let 2X
equal the number paid by United Sink-
traps, and let Y equal the number paid
by Windo Watchsprings. The amount
of money earned by each stock equals
the number of shares times the amount
of each dividend times the number of
dividends paid. John has earned (10)
(10)(2X) + (1)(50)(Y) = 200X
+ 50Y, and Jim has earned (5)(14)
(X) = 70X. Since John's earnings are
$6.70 greater than Jim's earnings, 70X
+ 670 = 200X + 50Y. Simplifying,
13X 4- 5Y = 67. Positive integral
values for X and Y that satisfy this
equation must now be found. Clearly
X cannot exceed 5: if it were greater
than 5, then 13X would exceed 67 and
Y would be negative. Since 67 — 13X
= 5Y, the difference between 67 and
13X must be a multiple of 5. The possi-
ble values for 13X are 13, 26, 39, 52,
and 65. Of these, only 52 differs from
67 by a multiple of 5. Thus X = 4 and
Y = 3. Jim's earnings are therefore
70Y or $2.10.
digit is U. Then N equals 10 times its
tens digit plus the units digit: N =
10T + U. N- divided by N/2 equals
2N + 36
2N. = N + 18. Since N
2
equals 10T + U, N 4- 18 must equal
10T 4- U + 18. This new number,
10T 4- U + 18 has the same digits
as N, only they are reversed. In other
words, 10T 4- U 4- 18 = 10U 4- T.
Simplifying this equation, T 4" 2 =
U. Also, T = 2(U—T), and so T =
2U/3 simultaneously, T equals 4 and
U equals 6. Thus the original number
was 46.
SOLUTION: 840
Let E be the total number of engi-
neers and T be the total number of
technicians working for the company.
Then E + T = 1470. In the research
division, there are .IE engineers and
.16T technicians. Since in this division
there are two technicians for every en-
gineer, twice the number of engineers
equals the number of technicians, that
is, 2(.lE) = .15T. This can be sim-
plified to 4E = 3T. Solving the two
equations 4E = 3T and E 4- T =
1470 simultaneously, E = 630 and
T = 840. Thus there are 840 techni-
cians working for the company.
SOLUTION: 46
Let N be the original two-digit num-
ber whose tens digit is T and units
SOLUTION: 22
When 135, a multiple of 5, is multi-
plied by any number, the product must
end in 5 or 0. Since neither 1, nor 3,
nor 5, may appear in the sum, each
partial product must end in 0. There
are only 7 multiples of 135 that have
three digits. Of these, only 270, 540,
and 810 end in 0. However, 540 con-
tains 5 and 810 contains a 1, and so
270 must be the partial sum in each
case. Since 270 = 135 X 2&gt; °°th digits
of the quotient must be 2, and the quo-
tient must indeed be 22.

Interview with General Electric's Dr. J. H. Hollomon
Manager—General Engineering Laboratory

Q. Dr. Hollomon, what characterizes
the new needs and wants of society?
A. There are four significant changes
in recent times that characterize these
needs and wants.
1. The increases in the number of
people who live in cities: the accom-
panying need is for adequate control
of air pollution, elimination of trans-
portation bottlenecks, slum clearance,
and adequate water resources.
2. The shift in our economy from agri-
culture and manufacturing to "serv-
ices": today less than half our working
population produces the food and goods
for the remainder. Education, health,
and recreation are new needs. They
require a new information technology
to eliminate the drudgery of routine
mental tasks as our electrical tech-
nology eliminated routine physical
drudgery.
3. The continued need for national
defense and for arms reduction: the
majority of our technical resources
is concerned with research and devel-
opment for military purposes. But
increasingly, we must look to new tech-
nical means for detection and control.
4. The arising expectations of the peo-
ples of the newly developing nations:
here the "haves" of our society must
provide the industry and the tools for the
"have-nots" of the new countries if they
are to share the advantages of mod-
ern technology. It is now clearly recog-
nized by all that Western technology is
capable of furnishing the material
goods of modern life to the billions
of people of the world rather than
only to the millions in the West.
We see in these new wants, prospects
for General Electric's future growth
and contribution.
O. Could you give us some examples?
A. We are investigating techniques for
the control and measurement of air and
water pollution which will be appli-
cable not only to cities, but to individual
households. We have developed, for
Society Has New Needs
and Wants—Plan Your
Career Accordingly
DR. HOLLOMON is responsible for General Electric's centralized, advanced engineering
activities. He is also an adjunct professor of metallurgy at RPI, serves in advisory posts
for four universities, and is a member of the Technical Assistance panel of President
Kennedy's Scientific Advisory Committee. Long interested in emphasizing new areas of oppor-
tunity for engineers and scientists, the following highlights some of Dr. Hollomon's opinions.
example, new methods of purifying
salt water and specific techniques for
determining impurities in polluted air.
General Electric is increasing its inter-
national business by furnishing power
generating and transportation equip-
ment for Africa. South America, and
Southern Asia.
We are looking for other products
that would be helpful to these areas to
develop their economy and to improve
their way of life. We can develop new
information systems, new ways of stor-
ing and retrieving information, or
handling it in computers. We can
design new devices that do some of the
thinking functions of men, that will
make education more effective and per-
haps contribute substantially to reducing
the cost of medical treatment. We can
design new devices for more efficient
"paper handling" in the service
industries.
Q. If I want to be a part of this new
activity, how should I plan my career?
A. First of all, recognize that the
meeting of needs and wants of society
with products and services is most
important and satisfying work. Today
this activity requires not only knowl-
edge of science and technology but
also of economics, sociology and the
best of the past as learned from the
liberal arts. To do the engineering
involved requires, at least for young
men, the most varied experience possi-
ble. This means working at a number
of different jobs involving different
science and technology and different
products. This kind of experience for
engineers is one of the best means of
learning how to conceive and design
—how to be able to meet the changing
requirements of the times.
For scientists, look to those new fields
in biology, biophysics, information, and
power generation that afford the most
challenge in understanding the world
in which we live.
But above all else, the science explo-
sion of the last several decades means
that the tools you will use as an engi-
neer or as a scientist and the knowledge
involved will change during your life-
time. Thus, you must be in a position
to continue your education, either on
your own or in courses at universities
or in special courses sponsored by
the company for which you work.
Q. Does General Electric offer these
advantages to a young scientist or
engineer?
A. General Electric is a large diver-
sified company in which young men
have the opportunity of working on a
variety of problems with experienced
people at the forefront of science and
technology. There are a number of
laboratories where research and ad-
vanced development is and has been
traditional. The Company offers incen-
tives for graduate studies, as well as
a number of educational programs
with expert and experienced teachers.
Talk to your placement officers and
members of your faculty. I hope you
will plan to meet our representative
when he visits the campus.

Freely translated—"Variety is our forte". And for over
25,000 Phillips employees this variety adds extra spice
to the job of earning a living and building a career.
Hardly a day goes by without new and significant
events—important research discoveries in the labs, new
oil and gas fields, new plants, additional marketing
areas . . . and, of course, personal promotions to meet
the demands of company growth.
Because of its diversification, Phillips is, financially
speaking, often compared to a mutual investment fund.
It is strongly engaged in three basic industries—oil,
natural gas, and chemicals. Products and services from
these industries are used by nearly every other industry
as well as by the consuming public. This broad partici-
pation gives Phillips unusual stability.
Phillips leads the petroleum industry as a (1) pro-
ducer of natural gas liquids, most versatile of hydrocar-
bons, (2) seller of natural gas, (3) producer-marketer
of liquefied petroleum gas, (4) manufacturer of nitro-
gen fertilizers, (5) supplier of raw materials to the rub-
ber industry, and (6) in atomic energy activities.
Phillips is also a major supplier of plastics and raw and
intermediate materials for plastics, of carbon black,
synthetic fiber ingredients, and many specialty chem-
icals. The company is among the leading oil companies
in research, patents, and chemicals production.

In days of yore, men feared not only their
mortal enemies, but the elements too. It was
the medieval armorer's task to protect his
chief against foemen, but weather-protection
was a more difficult matter. Thus many a
knight was spent in rusty armor.
Engineers and scientists at Ford Motor
Company, engaged in both pure and applied
research, are coping even today with the
problem of body protection (car bodies, that
is). Through greater understanding of the
chemistry of surfaces, they have developed
new paint primers and undercoatings, new
rustproofing methods, and special sealers
that guard entire car bodies against nature's
corrosive forces—all of which add armor-like
protection to Ford-built cars.
From other scientific inquiries will undoubt-
edly come new materials with protective
properties vastly superior to those of today.
This is another example of Ford's leadership
through scientific research and engineering.

In our political and economic contest with the Soviets,
ductivity is a prime goal. Even more so, increases in rel
and absolute productivity are hotly sought after by both s
Furthermore, industrial productivity is very much a cor
of the engineer. Thus, I feel that a few comments on the n;
and sources of productivity would be appropriate here, foi
reader to ponder. Inasmuch as the Tecbritc has several
scribers in the Soviet Union, I am also taking advantage
rare opportunity to spread some of our thinking on this m
to the rival camp.
Economists generally recognize four "factors of product!
and I am inclined to accept them as an accurate statemet
the elements necessary for a satisfactory and constantly-inc
ing level of industrial output. These are land, labor, ca\
and enterprise.
I do not think that these economic factors are exactly
mathematical factors, in that we cannot find relative leve
production by multiplying them together (at least, they art
linear factors). However, each is quite important:
hand includes not only the surface of the earth per se
also all the mineral wealth within, and all the timber, crops,
growing thereupon. To the extent that atmospheric gase:
used in industrial processes, they are also part of the econor
land.
Labor as a factor of production is also quite elemental
comprises all the mental and physical human toil put int&lt;
day-by-day production of goods and services. It is the effo
men put into the operation of productive systems.
Capital is a bit more elusive as a factor of produc
Basically, it means the tools, buildings, machinery, and sii
equipment brought into the productive activity. It also ap
partially to portions of land which have been raised above
natural state, such as cleared and plowed farmland, or m
graded, and transported coal in a bin. Note that capital i:
unique to capitalism; any economic system except the very
primitive requires large amounts of capital. Note further
capital is not quite so basic as the other factors. At an
period in the history of man, there was no capital, but
was land, labor and (at least inherent in man's nature) e
prise. These three have to be pre-existing; if they are, ca
can arise from them.
Enterprise is the most interesting of the four factors
cause of its inherent subjectivity. Essentially, it is comprise
the human effort to bring and interest in bringing the i
previous factors together in meaningful combination.
It is a necessary factor, because without it, the resoi
and labor and capital of the earth would lie untouched.
It is a subjective factor, because it cannot be measured ]
ically in terms of acres, tons, foot-pounds, man-days, or in
other way half so definitive.

writers and speakers plumping for greater productivity, and is
seldom cited as a very possible and very real cause for the
backwardness of the "underdeveloped" nations. There is some
discussion of enterprise, incentive, etc., but seldom in relation
to the formation and expansion of productive facilities.
In the short run, enterprise may not be essential to the
maintenance of the status quo. Production can sustain itself at
the current level for a while in the absence of enterprise. How-
ever, there will be no expansion without enterprise. Further-
more, a given present level of production will not be sustained
without enterprise. When plant expansion ceases, stagnation,
then depression, set in. The economy is like a giant flywheel,
with considerable inertia, but nevertheless some friction. With-
out recurring applications of the "torque" of enterprise, the
flywheel will stop.
Enterprise is not the same thing as incentive. It is true that
a particular kind of incentive (the profit motive) may induce
enterprise. But this is not the sole source. In the USSR, enter-
prise is (clumsily, but forcefully) furnished by the bureaucracy.
The motivation or incentive for enterprise by the communist
bureaucracy is really little different from the American entre-
preneur's incentive: a profit motive, in that the more successful
and more powerful bureaucrats have increasingly higher stand-
ards of living; and a pride motive similar to the American's
favor toward his own company—national pride—for the nation
is the company. Indeed, the whole Soviet economy can be
thought of as one huge corporation, competing not on a na-
tional, but on a universal scale. Just as the Santa Fe Ry. raced
the Rio Grande Ry. to Raton Pass, N.M., to see who would
gain possession of a very desirable route through the mountains,
and thus gain a competitive advantage, United States, Inc. is
racing USSR Corp. for the moon.
The difference between the USA and the USSR is less eco-
nomic than it is moral. The economic reasoning demonstrated
by the Red bosses in ditching Marxism (theoretical Communism)
and adopting their present system (expedient Communism) is
admirable, for beginners. They have made a few bad blunders,
but things will get better before worse.
The deplorable aspect of the Russian system, which will
provide the germ of its collapse (violent or evolutionary), is
the Red morality. Communism's productive advances are being
made under conditions of extreme duress, and involve intolera-
ble violations of the rights of men. However effective their
economy may become at sheer production, it has accomplished
nothing so long as the people are frightened, oppressed, and
threatened with slavery and destruction. For the goal of pro-
ductivity is human happiness and liberty, and there is no
provision in Red thought for this.

Mass spectrometer—10,000 chemical analyses every second.
A valuable tool for fast analysis of gases, liquids, solids, and
plasma, the Bendix® Mass Spectrometer is another dramatic
result of Bendix teamwork. Physicists, engineers, chemists—all
contributed to the development of this first successful time-of-
flight mass spectrometer.
Based on the patented Bendix time-of-flight principle, the
Bendix Mass Spectrometer uses pulsed electron beam to create
ions which are immediately accelerated into a field-free region.
Here, ions separate according to their mass-to-charge ratios. These
separated ion signals are then amplified in the electron multiplier
and fed to an oscilloscope, whose sweep is synchronized to the
spectrometer frequency. As many as 10,000 complete mass
spectra are presented each second, making the Bendix Mass
Spectrometer ideal for applications requiring extremely rapid
response.
Two other developments resulted from this work. One is a
double-grid ion acceleration system, with exceptionally high
resolving power. The other is a magnetic electron multiplier, which
is becoming an important component in Bendix-developed instru-
mentation systems for space research.
Currently, as part of our miniaturization research efforts,
our engineers are completing an advanced version, weighing only
12 pounds, for measuring the composition of the atmosphere
of manned space vehicles.

LIFE and the UNIVERSE
Working on the assumption that life must be based
on the versatile carbon atom, scientists are carry-
ing on the search for our form of life in other
parts of the Universe.
by ROBERT MOORE
The Rosette Nebula—The dark glob-
ules in center may be stars in the
process of formation. Thus, the long
chain of events which eventually cul-
minates in organic life may be begin-
ning even now. This photo was taken
at the U-M Portage Lake Observatory.
IN WHAT ways is the earth unique?
This is the central question which
arises in any discussion of the possi-
bility for non-earth life to exist. Are
there characteristics of our earth that
should lead us to conclude that life
could start and thrive only here?
Our atmosphere is oxygen-rich, but
this is due to photosynthesis. Without
this production of free oxygen by plant
life, the uncombined oxygen in our
atmosphere would combine almost en-
tirely into inorganic matter through
oxidation reactions.
The earth has large oceans of water,
but the results of recent polarization
measurements of Venus' light show
that this light is almost certainly scat-
tered by clouds of water vapor. We
can reasonably infer that the earth is
not unique in this aspect.
The bulk of earth's atmosphere is
nitrogen, but most of the atmosphere
of Mars is presumed to be nitrogen
also. So even this characteristic is not
uniquely earthly.
The Outer Planets
The difference between the inner and
outer planets is indeed much more
marked than the difference between the
members of the inner group. The four
innermost planets (Mercury, Venus,
Earth, Mars) are much smaller than
the outer group (except Pluto), and
as a result, the inner planets have a
different type of atmosphere. The inner
planets have weaker gravitational forces
to hold down atmospheric molecules,
and thus have either heavy-gas atmos-
pheres, or none at all. The massive out-
er planets have been able to retain
atmospheres including large amounts
of light-molecule gases, notably H2,
NH.j, and CH4. Scientists believe that
the inner planets once had their share
of such light gases, but that they es-
caped over the billions of years since
the formation of the solar system.
Experiments have been performed
which demonstrate a possible connec-
tion between these light gases and the
origin of life.
Organic Molecules
One theory along these lines is as
follows: if the gases which are presum-
ed to have composed the earth's at-
mosphere at one early time were some-
how caused to react, they would form
organic molecules. This theory was first
confirmed in 1955, in a classic ex-
periment performed by S. L. Miller.
He circulated a mixture of methane
(CH4), ammonia (NH3), water va-
por, and hydrogen through an appa-
ratus. A continuous spark was intro-
duced between electrodes within the
apparatus, to decompose the gases into
a reactive ionic state.

This structural formula represents part
of a characteristic carbohydrate.
Three things deter the existence of
free amino acids and other organic
compounds. They are decomposed by
solar radiation, destroyed catalytically
by living cells, or oxygen may oxidize
or cross-link these molecules. How-
ever, in the early days of a planet
such as the earth, the only enemy of
these amino acids would be the sun,
and even a thin blanket of water would
be an effective shield.
Thus, it seems quite likely that dur-
ing the early days of our planet (or
any similar one), amino acids were
formed from light atmosphere mole-
cules (by lightning sparks, perhaps),
and that these fundamental organic
compounds collected in the safety of
the sea. After a time, the oceans prob-
ably became soup-like broths of highly-
concentrated amino acids—the build-
ing-blocks of protein.
Protein: Life Intermediary
Certain proteins are sometimes con-
sidered the simplest of living matter.
This is because these proteins have the
ability to orient amino acids in such
a way that new protein molecules are
created; i.e., they "reproduce."
In addition to this reproductive
characteristic, new protein molecules
are formed by the assembly of amino
acids on a template which acts as a
catalyst for their union. Here is a
possible reaction proceeding in this
manner.
A = amino acid, — = bond, X
and B are substances

Building-Blocks of Life
Organisms are mainly an aggrega-
tion of four types of molecules: pro-
tein, carbohydrate, fat, and nucleic
acid. Fats are the simplest, each con-
sisting of three fatty acids joined with
glycerol. Carbohydrates are long chains
of sugar and other similar molecules,
and are often large and complex. The
main function of both fats and carbo-
hydrates is to supply the organism
with a reserve of fuel energy.

From left to right: Glycine, an amino

Nucleic acids are more complex than
either fats or carbohydrates. They are
very large structures formed of aggre-
gates of at least four types of units
(the nucleotides) brought together in
a great variety of proportions and se-
quences. Proteins are the most complex
of all. They are built up of as many as
25 different kinds of amino acids in
chains, some of which are over 1000
units long.
A great deal of order is implicit in
these molecules. The larger molecules
(proteins and nucleic acids) move so
sluggishly that they tend to align them-
selves with respect to one another, even
in solution. Under the right conditions,
the proteins of cartilage and muscle
tissue will realign themselves even
after they are dissolved in acid and
stirred to random orientations. It is
conjectured that the most primitive
organisms began as just such an orien-
tation of protein and nucleic acid
molecules.
Organisms
The most primitive organisms would
probably not resemble anything living
today. Even the amoeba is the result of
a long process of evolution. The most
primitive organisms probably fed only
upon the organic "soup" of the oceans.
A fermentation-like process is the most
probable energy source for such sim-
ple organisms. Fermentation would
release carbon dioxide into the oceans,
setting the stage for the development
of photosynthesis by later organisms,
and thus triggering the first evolu-
tionary step upward.

When we consider the billions of
random collisions every second be-
tween amino acid groups in the soup-
like oceans, and the fact that the mole-
cules tend to orient themselves, then
we see that the formation of many
new aggregates of molecules every sec-
ond was highly probable. Natural se-
lection would come into play at this
point. Those aggregates of molecules
that could reproduce themselves and
control an influx and outflow of ener-
gy would dominate.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The greatest ally of natural chem-
istry in the formation of living or-
ganisms was time. The chances of any
event's occurrence can be expressed as
one chance per (finite number) in a
given time interval. Improbable events
become probable as the time interval
is increased. An event that is almost
impossible in a day becomes almost
inevitable in the course of several geo-
logic eras.
Suppose that the chances for the
formation of a fermentation-producing
aggregate was one per two in a time
interval of a million years (even
chances). At the end of » million
years, the chance that the event would
not occur is only 1 in 2n—if n is only
5, for example, the chance of the
event not occurring is 1 in 32. In sev-
eral thousand million years, the event
becomes almost a certainty.
Other Planets
Now, what of the other planets?
Have they gone through similar proc-
esses? Astronomical evidence to date
has not held out much hope for the
existence of life elsewhere in the solar
system.
Venus, the most earthlike planet in
the solar system, is enshrouded with
clouds of (apparently) water vapor.
The visible surface of the upper clouds
of Venus are at a temperature of about
— 39°C. At this temperature, and at
low atmospheric pressure, little water
vapor could exist. This is apparently
the reason why we cannot observe
water vapor bands in the spectrum of
Venus. Light polarization measure-
ments indicate the presence of water
vapor clouds, probably quite near the
planet surface. The surface temperature
of Venus is probably too high for the
existence of oceans. However, Venus
is still very much a surprise package.
Space probes should give us many ad-
ditional hints about life conditions on
her surface.
Much more is known about Mars.
It is a smaller planet than the earth,
and thus it has a thinner atmosphere.
The atmosphere of Mars contains no
detectable oxygen. There is some CO.,,
but about 98% of Mars' atmosphere
seems to be nitrogen.
Mars has polar caps consisting of
thin layers of hoarfrost. This implies
the presence of some water vapor in
the Martian atmosphere, but since it
is spectroscopically undetectable, it
must be less than 1/1000 the concen-
tration of earth's.
Mars changes color with its seasons.
This is often cited as evidence of life.
Mars exhibits large patches of green
or bluish coloring in the spring, which
turns to reddish brown in autumn.
There is an observable absorbtion at
3.5 microns in the reflected light of
Mars. This corresponds to the C-H
stretching frequency (due to carbon-
hydrogen bonds) of most organic com-
pounds, but many inorganic compounds
have absorbtions at this wave length.
Studies of the infrared absorbtion of
the patches indicate that they do not
absorb the energy that ordinary plant
life would.
The other planets of the solar system
are either too near or too distant from
the sun to offer any chance for fa-
miliar life-forms. Any life there would
be of a radically and totally different
chemical basis.
The Universe
The chances for existence of life in
other solar systems seems to depend on
the existence of an earth-like planet
(from the standpoint of temperature,
atmosphere, size, etc.).
Of the theories explaining the ori-
gin of solar systems, the two-star colli-
sion or near-collision would produce
the least number of new systems. By
this theory, a star has an even chance
of giving birth to a new solar system
once every million million million
years. According to our estimates of
the number of stars in the universe, this
would imply the existence of about 2
million million solar systems, with a
new one coming into being every few
hours. If one in ten of these solar
systems have a planet in the "temper-
ate" zone, then we would have 200
billion such planets. If one in ten of
these is about the size of the earth, we
would have about 20 billion planets.
It seems that a methane, ammonia,
hydrogen, and oxygen atmosphere is
likely for the first few billion years of
an earth-sized planet's life. We have
seen that the formation of life is very
highly probable under these circum-
stances.
Now and then a theory arises that
life could be based on some other ele-
ment than carbon, perhaps silicon. Of
all the elements, only silicon ap-
proaches carbon in its great variety
of valence bonds. Perhaps a form of
life could replace carbon with silicon.
Or, perhaps a carbon-based life could
exist which based its energy cycle on
something other than solar radiation.
We may be guilty of thinking only in
terms of our own oxygen-sunlight de-
pendency. Perhaps, somewhere out
amongst the stars, a life has evolved
which can thrive on a cold orb like
Jupiter. Perhaps there is a life-form
on a Mercury-like planet that derives
animal-like mobility from plant-like
photosynthesis due to the high level
of radiation.
In the future, man will reach out
to the stars and steal their secrets.
Until then, we can only interpret the
data of our few crude instruments,
with our limited mathematics, and
make a few speculations.

In panel, or crossbar, or floor, or sill,
In screw, bolt, thoroughbrace,—
lurking still,
Find it somewhere you must and
will,—
Above or below, or within or
without,—
And that's the reason beyond a
doubt,
That a chaise breaks down, but never
wears out.
So the deacon made each part as
strong as the rest, and after one
hundred years,
All at once the horse stood still,
Close by the meet'n'-house on the
hill,
—First a shiver and then a thrill,
Then something decidely like a spill,
What do you think the parson
found,
When he got up and stared around?
The poor old chaise in a heap or
mound,
As if it had been to the mill and
ground!

You see, of course, if you're not a
dunce,
How it went to pieces all at once!
The above is an excerpt from "The
Wonderful One-Hoss Shay" by Oliver
Wendell Holmes. Many people express
the thought that Detroit should pro-
duce a car that would match the lon-
gevity of the one-hoss shay. They don't
advocate an automobile that would last
for a hundred years, but one that
would give dependable service for, say,
ten years. Even if that were the case,
there would still be some people who
would want a twenty year car. There
are those who say that the automobile
manufacturers deliberately produce
cars that wear out after a few years,
so there would be a continuing market
for new cars.
This idea of manufacturing a prod-
uct with a short life is known as plan-
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


book "The Waste Makers," defines
three kinds of planned obsolescence.
The first is obsolescence of function,
which means that an existing product
is outmoded when a new product func-
tions better. This is not undesirable,
because it leads to better products. Ob-
solescence of function is the inevitable
result of science and technology,
through which we have achieved our
present high standard of living.
The second is obsolescence of desir-
ability, where a change is made in the
appearance of a product, while there
is no improvement in function. The
best example is the automobile. In the
early fifties major styling changes were
made every three or four years, but
since 1958 the automobile industry has
made major styling changes each year.
At the present time, however, as the
1962 models appear, there is some in-
dication of a reversal of this trend. The
cars became more desirable each year,
but sales did not increase proportion-
ately. The automobile market is be-
coming saturated.
The third case is planned obsoles-
cence of quality; the product wears out
and becomes useless or needs costly re-
pairs. This is the planned obsolescence
to which most people refer. People say
their goods wear out shortly after the
warranty expires. At least it seems that
way.
Why?
Economic conditions are mainly re-
sponsible for planned obsolescence.
Adam Smith, perhaps the first great
economist, in his "Wealth of Nations"
points out that economic growth is
more important than the wealth of a
nation. This is easy to see by consider-
ing that during a period of growth,
the wages of the labor class would rise
and raise their standard of living. Dur-
ing a period of no growth the number
of non-employed increases, with the
result that wealthier individuals are
able to take advantage of the workers
by offering low wages. Thus wealth
could be accumulated by a few. The
United States has enjoyed continuous
economic growth and therefore has a
middle-class society and a high stand-
ard of living.
The industrial revolution of the 18th
century was one of the most important
factors behind the growth of the per-
iod. Mechanization at first caused
people to lose their jobs, but after a
short time the mechanized industry
employed not only more people, but
provided better jobs at higher pay. The
industrial revolution provided products
that were in great demand at a price
many could afford. Thus a large mar-
ket for the new products was opened.
Presently we are entering the second
phase of the industrial revolution:
automation and the use of computers.
A large number of jobs have been
eliminated, but we may be in a period
of temporary re-adjustment, as in the
first phase of the industrial revolution.
Another economic factor is the ab-
sence of new consumer goods. In the
earlier part of the century, the auto-
mobile, airplane, radio, and many
home appliances came into common
use. If the economy is to continue to
grow, there must be a corresponding
increase in the number of products.
The space industry is just sprouting,
but there is some doubt if it will
grow large at least in the near fu-
ture. In the next hundred years, only
isolated scientific space flights seem
possible. Passenger flights will be
excluded because of the exorbitant cost
and inherent dangers.
Which Way?
As we put these three factors to-
gether, we see that fewer people can
produce more for more people. Even
with earlier retirement ages and the
extension of the life span, our econo-
my is now capable of producing more
than can be consumed. Never before
has there been such an affluent society.
As a result all the basic needs of our
population have been filled and a large
number of our demands for luxury
have been met.
We are faced with two alternatives.
The first is to produce less, which
would result in greater unemployment
and a general slowing down of the
economy. The resulting burden on the
governments and taxpayers might tend
to instigate a downward spiral which
could end in the depths of another
depression. The second alternative is
to produce as much as possible, thus
keeping employment high and insur-
ing prosperous times. But in this case,
it is necessary to sell all the goods
produced. In the past we were able
to export many products, but now the
other nations of the world with their
low labor costs have taken some of
this market away from us. Therefore
the only solution is to sell more of
each product to consumers, sell replace-
ments more often, or both. This is
exactly what planned obsolescence does.
The Effect on the Economy
Consider again obsolescence of de-
sirability. We have mentioned auto-
mobile styling in this category. An-
other example is clothing, both men's

N-CLUB
As more of the smaller nations
acquire nuclear weapons poten-
tial, the world balance of power
may be upset. If world peace is
to be maintained, it is the moral
obligation of the present nuclear
powers to prevent the spread of
super weapons.
by BARRY PEEBLES

On the morning of September 1,
1%1 the Soviet Union exploded a nu-
clear device ending a three year mora-
torium on nuclear testing. Within the
next few days this initial test was fol-
lowed by others in a series.
Within a week after the original
Soviet blast the White House announc-
ed that the United States would resume
nuclear testing (but not in the atmos-
phere) sometime in early October.
France and Pres. de Gaulle, who did
not observe the moratorium, had con-
cluded their latest test several months
before. Little information leaks past
the Bamboo Curtain, but we can be
sure Red China is working around the
clock in an effort to develop nuclear
weapons.
And so it goes as the front pages
of the nation's newspapers report the
"society notes" of the world's exclu-
sive N-Club, or Nuclear Club. Today
The Club has only two full members
(the U.S. and Russia and a couple
of junior members (Britain and
France) but tomorrow may see the init-
iation of a new member (Red China).
Before the end of the decade member-
ship may no longer be quite so ex-
clusive as the list grows to include
such countries as West Germany, Is-
rael, India, Japan, and Italy, to name
a few.
At this point you might ask if this
spread of nuclear powers can actually
take place—do these other countries
have the technical and economic tools
necessary to become a member of the
N-Club? And if so, is this spread good
or bad? Finally, what are the alterna-
tives available to the United States and
her allies in view of this spread of
nuclear capability? These are the ques-
tions that we shall examine in the
remainder of this article.
How Large the Membership List?
In answer to the first question it
seems quite likely that a number of
nations can, or will soon be able to,
build various types of nuclear devices
if they so desire. We have already list-
ed a number of countries that seem to
have this capability. The state of sci-
ence and technology has now develop-
ed to the point where the construction
of a nuclear device is a relatively easy
undertaking. France is an example of
a country that developed and tested a
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



nuclear device within a few short years
after development started in 1954. This
development period is shortened con-
siderably if present members of the
N-Club lend a hand to the newcomer.
It should be pointed out, however,
that the feasibility of construction was
hedged with the comment "if they so
desire." This poses a completely differ-
ent question and one which we can not
easily answer. We can, however, list
several reasons why they would "so
desire." One of the major ones is to
gain political advantage and prestige,
i.e., to become a member of the N-
Club. This was probably the main mo-
tivation behind the French effort. Other
countries, fearful that their allies will
not come to their help if attacked, may
develop nuclear weapons as a deterent
against possible aggressors. Finally,
some countries may desire these wea-
pons for aggressive purposes of their
own.
While we cannot say with certainty
that the N-Club is going to have in-
creased membership in the coming
years it seems "likely" that this will
happen. The general technical capa-
bility exists as well as several motives
for developing nuclear devices. Eco-
nomic resources would eliminate some
countries because of the tremendous
cost of developing a nuclear device
and its "transportation" system but a
large number of potential nuclear pow-
ers would still remain.
Good or Bad?
Is increased membership in the N-
Club going to be good or bad? The
most popular view today is that it is
bad. As Albert Worlstetter states in
Foreign Affairs (April, I960) many
people are deeply concerned "with the
enormous instabilities and dangers of
a world with many nuclear powers"
and they therefore urge immediate nu-
clear disarmament (with appropriate
safeguards to insure that mutual dis-
armament does occur). It does seem
that they are at least partially correct
in their assessment of the situation.
With a large number of nuclear pow-
ers the probability of war by mistake
or miscalculation definitely increases.
Similarly with more nuclear powers,
even small ones, the chances of aggres-
sive use of nuclear weapons will in-
crease. Even the use of these weapons

DIALOGUE
by GERRY ANDEEN
Logus, Catcher, and others find
that it is difficult to evaluate the
role of the non-technical in the
education of an engineer and to
determine the desirability of a
liberal engineering education.

Catcher: Good morning Logus. I have heard good reports
of you. Apparently you are doing very well in your
studies; is this true?'
Logus: Thank you Catcher. What you heard is true, for
I stood first in my class last semester.
Catcher: Very fine. Certainly such an achievement would
place you in as good a position as any to answer my
question. The question concerns our engineering educa-
tion and is actually quite a common question. No doubt
you have debated the subject in some form or another
before and are already somewhat familiar with the prob-
lem.
The question is, "What is the role of the non-technical
in the education of the engineer?" Let me perhaps open
up some new avenues of approach by saying that the non-
technical need not mean only non-technical courses but
all non-technical experiences to which the engineering
student is exposed.
Logus: Ah my friend, if you presumed that I would be
able to answer you, then you have over-evaluated my
worth. First of all, the problem is much more complex
than you would make it sound, especially with your idea
of the non-technical as more than just courses. Secondly,
even if you had asked me the most simple question in this
field, I would be unable to answer for I am merely a
student.
Catcher: You arc by fact the best student. What do you
mean by "merely a student?"
Logus: You have asked me the question of the educators.
It is preposterous to think that a student, one who is
seeking the answers from the educators, should presume
to be the educator and give the answer himself. If such
were possible, then we would have no need for the edu-
cator. Why don't you ask me some equally impossible
question such as what sort of pictures I would expect
to find inside a book I had never seen before?
Catcher: But you did come to the University didn't you?
You did pick up the book with the expectation of finding
something. Why even a blind man thinks that he knows
where he is going.
Logus: I have placed my faith in the University as my
educator. I do not know what I will find but I expect
that it will be worthwhile. The student must operate on
a day by day faith; he cannot be more than he is as you
are trying to be. If you want opinions you now have
mine, but if you want answers you must push on without
questioning.
I must go study rather than indulge in foolish debate.
Obviousity: Say Catcher, where is Logus going in such a
hurry?
Catcher: Good morning Obviousity. I am afraid that I of-
fended him by asking a question which merely wasted
his time.
Obviousity: And what was that? I'll take a try at it, and
furthermore, I have time to spare.
Catcher: The question deals with the role of the non-
technical in the education of the engineer. It is an ex-
tremely difficult . . .
24
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


for it is basically simple. The role of the non-technical
and the technical for that matter, depend simply upon
the person's goals. If one desires to write history books,
then that person should study history and perhaps philos-
ophy of government, sociology, and psychiatry. He would
merely be wasting valuable time by studying engineering
or zoology. Now if the person desires to be an engineer
he should of course study engineering and also attempt
to conserve his time. The truly devoted engineering stu-
dent would not want to spend any more time in the
non-technical field than was absolutely necessary. Some
students, however, have a mixture of goals, some are
striving for the qualities which make executives, and in
such a case, a few courses in English, or some communica-
tion type course might be of some use.
The point is that the value of the course depends
upon the individual's goals. The reason that Logus can-
not answer you is that he has no clearly defined goals;
he is hoping that some day they might develop. This sort
of approach is putting the cart before the horse.
Catcher: You say that every one should have a goal and
should judge everything in relation to that goal?
Obviousity: Exactly. There already are enough wishy-washy
people in the world without encouraging more. A person
without a goal merely wastes his life away.
Catcher: Where do people first obtain their goals? Does
everyone come with goals and then some lose them or
does one, at some time, have to find his goal? Or is there
some universal goal toward which we should all strive?
Obviousity: Trap questions. All I say is that people should
have their goals set before they get to college. College is
a place to develop yourself toward the fulfillment of your
goals and not the place to flit from flower to flower like
a butterfly attempting to find goals.
Arty: I couldn't help but overhear you, Obviousity, and I
just can't agree.
Obviousity: You're not even an engineer Arty, what can
you know about the role of the non-technical to engi-
neering education? But I will listen to you, what is your
problem?
Arty: To have goals is very likely a good thing. But the
goals should not become fixed for a better goal is always
just ahead of the present goal. The non-technical may not
be important to your present preconceived notions of your-
self as a future engineer, but that is precisely why you
need the non-technical. Your goals should not set like
concrete but should be flexible so that you can adjust to
a more mobile position. Just as water runs downhill, your
goals and aspirations should gravitate upwards.
Obviousity: You talk as if there are no real goals in life
but that each "goal'' is a stepping stone toward the next
one. You are eulogizing the fact that you have no con-
crete goal. You are no better than Logus but you are
proud of it.
Catcher: I like your expression Arty but I must ask the
same question as Obviousity. You speak of gravitating
upward, rising higher and higher. Do you ever reach a
peak, the ultimate goal about which I questioned Obvi-
ousity without answer? Furthermore, whether a peak goal
does or does not exist, what are the high, noble goals
like? Can you give us somewhat of an idea so that we
will know why we are climbing upward and upward?
Obviousity: I guess that I do agree with the concept of
goal development but I hasten to add that the pinnacle
should be reached as soon as possible. The pinnacle as
I see it, is the practical. The student engineer, as his
ultimate goal, must prepare to do a good job for his
employer.
Arty: How completely you have missed the point Obvi-
ousity. How lifeless and empty of spirit you are. At the
peak is the bonding of the spirit and the material, not
just the practical. Pure practicality is so far from the
pinnacle that I could not hope that you would under-
stand.
Catcher: Let us not let this discussion degenerate to a
squabble.
Humane: Could I offer you my view of the pinnacle?
Catcher: New ideas are always welcome, go ahead Dr.
Schweitzer.
Humane: That is the pinnacle, service to humanity. Hu-
manity is the goal to which everything, absolutely every-
thing must point. Dr. Schweitzer is a striking example
of service to humanity, since he deals with the lowest
form of mankind and attempts to elevate it from its
savagery. His medical service alone, healing sick bodies
and preventing disease, is enough to clearly distinguish
his concern for mankind. Service to humanity can also
take on many other less obvious forms. Einstein is a
humanitarian for his contributions in the field of science,
man's understanding of the natural world about him.
Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill were both
driven by a concern for mankind to their achievements
and thousands of unnamed writers, artists, and builders
have also achieved greatness through their attempt to push
mankind upward. Truly a concern for mankind is the
ultimate noble goal for it can bring nothing but good.
Obviousity: How does such a goal apply to the role of the
non-technical in the education of the engineer which is
the subject under discussion?
Humane: The value of a course or an experience is related
to how well it exposes the student to the humanitarian
spirit. The value is directly proportional to the inspira-
tion to elevate, advance, or save mankind. Technical
courses deal almost exclusively with objects and functions,
merely with things. This is fine as mankind needs things
to help him progress, to heal sickness and to alleviate
menial toil. But the idea of things without mankind is a
clanking bell, it is void. The engineer must be exposed to
the non-technical to develop his humanity. If he doesn't
expose himself, then those in charge of his education
should force him to do so. This might mean courses in
music, sociology, and language.
Catcher: You have a very concise way of observing the
value of education and you may be correct in your con-
clusions, I claim, though, that your argument hangs to-
gether because you define the terms so that error cannot

exist. Essentially you say that when a man does something
which happens to advance mankind, that necessarily, he
must have had mankind in mind all the time. The argu-
ment fails in that it is not linked to reality.
You suggest that a man should negate his own per-
sonal desires to the total devotion to mankind. I question
the personal negation in each of the examples you gave.
Most certainly Einstein was not driven by love of hu-
manity but by something much more personal. Perhaps
his motivation was the thrill of discovery, of knowing
more and more or, dare I suggest it of such a highly
respected man, perhaps he was driven by some psycho-
logical oddity much the same way was Hitler—of course
to a much better end. Dr. Schweitzer's motivation is the
most difficult of the examples to explain without the love
of ideal humanity, but I am confident that personal moti-
vation can also be found in his case if one were willing
to search. Might you grant that Schweitzer's devotion to
God is a manifestation of his responsibility to himself
and thus concede the possibility of the "selfish" motive?
Humane: I never intended to consider psychological mo-
tivation. You seem to imply that goals are mere mani-
festations of psychological drives; that goals merely exist
as rationalizations.
Catcher: On the contrary, goals do exist, however, I feel
that the only true goals are self-oriented. That it is out
of the question to try to develop a goal of self-negation.
As Bertrand Russell said in his essay, "Why I Am
an Egotist," self-centeredness is the key to man's greatness.
In the attainment of his personal goals the individual
often does a service for mankind in general. The irony
of the title is that egotism is pictured in most minds as
the reason for a man's downfall. When it brings him to
success the quality is no longer called egocentricity but
something like drive. Russell catches people off guard by
defending that which we feel is correct but which we
have been taught is wrong.
Logus (returning): Are you still grabbing at mirages? I
don't recall any essay by Russell titled, "Why I Am an
Egotist"; your complete irrationality dumbfounds me and
again I must leave.
Catcher: Logus was right about the essay as he always is
about tangible facts, but the point is that Russell would
be in style defending such a proposition. I can imagine
him shocking the innocent students of pedantic teachers
by saying that egotism is good and actually meaning that
devotion to one's personal ideals often results in more
goodness than mere self-satisfaction.
Obviousity senses responsibility toward himself and
expresses the feeling in the form of rather naive goals.
In a sense, Obviousity is closer than you Humane, for
you try to hide the facts and defeat your own purpose.
When a child is caught in the theft of candy, he should
not be given the idea that it is wrong to want something
for himself for that would contradict what the child
naturally feels to be true. He should instead be taught
(Continued from page 25)
sophistication in the expression and satisfaction of his
personal desires. That a person's drives are personal can-
not detract from the service or disservice to humanity,
but is merely a recognition of a fact.
Humane: By what standard do you now measure the degree
of sophistication of one's goals? You have left yourself
no course but the standard of humanity.
Catcher: The standard of reality is also left, the idea that
the world is round is more sophisticated than the idea
that the world is flat because the roundness is more real.
Arty: Catcher, you sound like a ninteenth century tycoon
speaking in defense of capitalism. You are completely
carried away with one side of the picture, that self-
centeredness is good. You have overlooked the evil in
man, jealousy and hate. Murder and theft are also mani-
festations of man's egotism. Personal satisfaction, in such
instances, is not the pinnacle but rather the pit of the
goal of egotism.
Foreseeing a possible answer, I cannot accept the idea
that a man's evil results from an underdeveloped or un-
sophisticated interpretation of personal responsibility as
in the case of the child candy thief.
Humane: Ditto. Man, the individual, is not good. He
cannot be taken as the goal. We must learn to think in
terms of mankind.
Obviousity: I challenge that we are off the track.
Catcher: You must have patience when a subject seems to
wander. A great many facts and ideas have relevance to
our question. Furthermore, a good talk, like a good rain,
cannot help but cleanse the air. The sun after a rain
creates an image; although the rainbow cannot be touched
and although it may fade away, it is a real solution that
often transcends the original question.
Arty: I like that explanation.
Catcher: Back to your question Arty, why cannot you ac-
cept the idea of misdirected egotism as the explanation
for wrong. I rather like the idea and would consider
education the process of sophisticating the personal moti-
vation. I am particularly fond of the idea because I feel
that it incorporates the essentials of each of your ideas.
Obviousity, you are in agreement because you recognize
motivation. Arty, you are devoted to gravitating upward,
you are devoted to the concept of sophistication. Humane
can be considered within the idea although he is mainly
concerned with the outcome, the effect on humanity,
rather than the motivation. Logus could even be a part
of our group if he would admit that we are not neces-
sarily searching in order to find a specific answer.
Obviousity: Are we not searching for a specific answer?
I would have us write down a declaration of solution. I
would like to be able to show it to Logus and analyze it
closely myself.
Catcher: I believe also that the attempt to answer speci-
fically is justified. I will agree to a declaration of solution.
You begin.

The "Freezing" Science
Cryogenics—the science of extremely
low temperatures—is playing an in-
creasingly important role in a rising
number of fields. It is here to stay.
The chairman, U-M Prof. G. J. Van
Wylen, noted that among other uses,
the science of cryogenics seems particu-
larly permanent in space vehicle appli-
cations. "The whole cryogenic field
received a terriffic shot in the arm from
space uses of cryogenic fluids, but now
what we have learned is having con-
siderable influence in other fields," he
said.
"The use of liquid hydrogen, which
at one time was considered very dar-
ing, has been established as almost a
routine technique. People are prepared
now to handle liquid hydrogen almost
as they would gasoline.
"Another real stride," he continued,
"is the almost routine manner in which
they speak of handling liquid helium,
which boils at 4.2 degrees Kelvin (or
about 45 degrees below zero Fahren-
heit)."
Professor Van Wylen termed the
conference unusual in that it brought
together engineers and scientists from
a wide variety of fields, from industry
producers of cryogenic equipment and
liquids, from government and univer-
sity laboratories, and from agencies in-
volved with cryogenic applications.
"Also noticeable here was the gener-
al feeling that there will be a greater
interaction between the biomedical sci-
ences and cryogenics in the immediate
future," he said.
That crygenic rocket propellants will
continue to play an important role in
the nation's space program even while
solid fuels are being improved was
noted by an Air Force officer in the
space program.
Cryogenic liquids are the route to
big payloads in orbit, Col. P. L. Fish-
burne of the USAF Space Systems
Division told the 800 engineers and
scientists attending the conference.
While solid fuels may find applica-
tion in ballistic missile programs be-
cause of their readiness and ease of
handling, cryogenic materials will be
used in space programs "for a long,
long time," he predicted.
He said that the cryogenic engineers'
job is "limited only by your abilities to
design better and more economical
systems for the future. The engineering
job of cryogenic application to missile
and space programs has just begun."
At a panel session Tuesday (Aug.
15) evening on the future of cryogen-
ics, Irving Pinkel of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Lewis Research Center said he believed
liquid oxygen and RP (a rocket pro-
pellant similar to kerosene) would be
used in big boosters for some time to
come. Large solid-fueled boosters could
be used, he said, if they could be de-
veloped to retain their specific impulse
as their size is increased. The question
is "entirely open" now, he said.
Dr. Ed F. Hammel of Los Alamos
laboratories noted that with the de-
velopment of atomic rocket engines,
knowledge is needed about the com-
bined effects of cryogenic temperatures

used in such systems. Although some
work has been done in this area, "all
the measurements haven't been made
yet," he said.
Dr. E. H. Jacobson of General Elec-
tric Co. said cryogenic engineering may
play several roles in electronics.
In the field of superconductors (ma-
terials that conduct electrical current
almost, or entirely, without electrical
losses at cryogenic temperatures), ex-
tremely high magnetic fields may be
achieved through cryogenics, he said,
adding that one approach to these has
been through the use of extremely
small (cross-section) filaments. These
do not break down in high magnetic
fields (which tend to tear magnets
apart).
Dr. Jacobson suggested that electron-
ics engineers, solid state scientists, and
metallurgists might find that working
more closely together could be produc-
tive in the field of cyclotron resonance.
For this, metals of extremely high pur-
ity are required. These people "have a
lot to learn from one another," he said.
U. of M. Construction
Last year the University of Michigan
Regents approved the plans for the
University's newest construction, the
Physics and Astronomy Building. Cost-
ing $3,250,000 for completion, the
building will be located on East Uni-
versity Ave. between the East Engineer-
ing Building and East Medical. The
source of funds for the project are
from state appropriations.
The building is constructed in two
parts and will supply over 115,000 sq.
ft. of floor space. The first section,
which runs north and south, will house
the Physics Library and two large lec-
ture rooms. The east-west wing will be
ten stories high. The first two stories
will be used for classroom facilities,
the next five for offices and laboratories
of the Physics Dept. and finally the
last three floors will be used by the
Astronomy Dept. Over one-half of the
total floor space is devoted to labora-
tory work.
The building, designed by Albert
Kahn and Assoc, of Detroit, will have
brick and masonry panels on the ex-
terior with supports of pre-cast con-
crete. At its completion in January of
1963, the present West Physics Build-
ing will be leveled.
Computer Psychology
Probably this was bound to hap-
pen. Psychologists at The University of
Michigan Medical Center are giving
mental tests to automatic computers
to find how well the machines can
"think." They may have found some
shortcomings.
Someday the high speed digital com-
puters which have taken over much of
man's drudgery in business, industry
and rocket-firings may have to pass a
mental exam. Meanwhile investigators
of the U-M Mental Health Research
Institute hope to use the information
they are gathering to provide an im-
portant link in understanding human
behavior. They have been giving the
computer (an IBM 704) an intricate
psychological test used extensively for
studies of human problem-solving abil-
ity.
The computer is told to solve prob-
lems in three different ways. These
vary, in the extent to which the com-
puter merely registers certain environ-
mental events ... or is capable of
abstract "thoughts" about the possible
nature of the world which help it to
give meaning to its experiences. In
addition, each method of solving prob-
lems reflects a philosophical and psych-
ological theory concerning the thinking
process. In reporting preliminary re-
sults the Michigan researchers hinted
that one of their programs shows up
the computer as pretty simple-minded
and vacillatory when it comes to solv-
ing problems.
The computer has a strong tendency
to seek simple paths (to a solution)
until more complex paths begin to
have much in their favor. It discovers
these other paths largely by accident.
Also, it is relatively unable to retain
information . . . and continuously di-
verts its attention to different but false
paths and thus has a tendency to vacil-
late around a solution, sometimes get-
ting close but on the next trial losing
all or most of the ground gained.
Before selling the computer short,
however, the researchers note that oth-
er computer programs, basically more
"elegant" theoretically, tend to lead to
behavior which is less vulnerable to the
above shortcomings.

with respect to your career choice?
Of course, you are. .. and should be. But don't
overlook the fact that "thinking big" really applies
to your own personal growth and achievement—
and not necessarily to the physical size of an
organization. And that's an important reason for
investigating the opportunities here at Sikorsky
Aircraft.
We believe that our company offers just the
"right-sized" environment for young engineers
seeking strong personal identification and stature
opportunities. The technical talent we require can
enjoy diversified activities in a field that permits
full expression of engineering imagination and
professional competence.
At Sikorsky, we pioneered helicopters. Our
continuing objective is to further advance V /STOL
(vertical short take-off and landing) aircraft.
The engineering programs are stimulating and
far-ranging. Assignments could include joining an
electronic team of twenty to thirty associates—or—
working with a highly selective group of four or
five on sophisticated problems of antenna radiation,
instrumentation, automatic pilot, automatic stabi-
lization—to name a few.
Your opportunity for personal growth could be
here . .. now. Can we help you "think big" towards
that goal?

careers with Du Pont
Every year, several hundred new college graduates choose
Du Pont. Many Masters and Ph.D.'s do, too.
Recently we asked some of them what factors influenced
them to decide for Du Pont. They cited more than half a dozen
reasons. Here are some they almost all agreed upon:
OPPORTUNITY AND RECOGNITION
They were aware that college-trained beginners go right to work with
men who have achieved. For example, research chemists work with
individuals who've done successful research. New engineers work
with pros, some of whom have designed new plants, or devised new
manufacturing methods, or distinguished themselves in some other
way. And other graduates, with B.A. or M.B.A. degrees, go to work
with leaders who've been successful in Sales or Advertising or Treas-
urer's, or another of Du Pont's many departments.
RESEARCH CREATES NEW PRODUCTS;
NEW PRODUCTS CREATE NEW JOBS
Men like working for a company that believes in research, enough to
invest in it... $90 million a year! The fact is that important new prod-
ucts come from Du Pont laboratories and go to Du Pont manufactur-
ing plants with frequency.
Here are but a few since World War II: "Orion"* acrylic fiber
followed nylon (soon after the war). Then came "Dacron"* poly-
ester fiber, "Mylar"* polyester film, "Lucite"* acrylic lacquer and
"Delrin"* acetal resin. These, and many others, have created thou-
sands of new jobs ... in research, manufacturing, sales ... in fact,
in all Du Pont departments.
DUPONT BACKS EMPLOYEES WITH HUGE INVESTMENT
New graduates feel that every facility is provided for doing the job well.
Last year, Du Pont's operating investment per employee was $32,500.
Since much of this was expended to provide the most modern and
best of equipment to work with, it further increases the chance for
individual achievement.
DUPONT PROVIDES STEADY EMPLOYMENT
Career seekers appreciate the importance of security. Today, the aver-
age annual turnover rate at Du Pont is less than one-third that of
industry nationally.

light. Besides being significant as a
scientific achievement, the result holds
important implications for communica-
tions and other applications.
They produced the second harmonic
(or overtone) of red light by focusing
the LASER'S intense beam of pure red
light into a quartz crystal. The second
harmonic—a deep blue beam—was pro-
duced as a result of the extremely high
intensity of the red light at this focus.
(For comparison, the focused intensity
of the LASER light is one billion times
greater than sunlight on the earth's
surface.)
In the crystal, this intensity produces
the blue light from the red in much
the same way overtones are produced
in music, the physicists point out. If
you twang a guitar string with great
force, you get more intense overtones
than if you strum it softly.
The LASER beam was monochro-
matic (or "pure" color) at 7000 Ang-
stroms. The blue beam, an almost in-
visible violet which was considerably
weaker than the LASER beam, was
monochromatic at 3500 Angstroms. To
produce the intense beam, the U-M
physicists use a LASER purchased from
Trion Instruments, Inc. They termed
this LASER "one of the most powerful
in the world."
The beam produces a power density
of 100 million watts per square centi-
meter at the focus. (By contrast, the
intensity of sunlight at the earth's sur-
face is one-tenth of a watt per square
centimeter.) This is a striking example
of optical electronics. Although the
production of the second harmonic is
now relatively weak, the possibilities
for unique devices based on this effect
merit intense investigation.
Light waves are of the same sub-
stance as radio (electromagnetic)
waves, but are of different frequency
and wave length—far shorter, for ex-
ample, than the shortest radio waves
now in use for communications.
One of the implications of the ex-
periment is that it may open the way
for using electromagnetic waves in the
(Continued from page 31)
frequency region of light for communi-
cation purposes. For this, the light
beam must be modulated (or mixed)
as are radio waves—to carry a signal.
The mixing provides oscillations in the
waves, the oscillations varying accord-
ing to the mixing—the way the mes-
sage is put on the beam.
If light waves can be used for this
—and the U-M physicists point out
that there are many difficult problems

focused laser beam and instrument
package.
to be solved—beams of light would
be constructed with a message carry-
ing capacity many times that of the
longer radio waves.
The Michigan scientists point out
that—if these problems can be solved
—a single light beam could carry all
the messages that now go across coun-
try on regular communication channels.
Another application of this achieve-
ment is to permit the investigation of
materials' properties that scientists
haven't been able to study before—for
example, the non-linear optical prop-
erties of various materials.
Students of naval architecture to The
University of Michigan—numbering 25
per cent more than last year—are find-
ing a new ship model towing carriage
waiting for their laboratory and re-
search projects, this semester.
Replacing a carriage that has been in
use at the U-M since 1904 the new
German-made machine is capable of
higher speeds and more precise meas-
urements than its predecessor.
The electrically-powered carriage is
used to tow accurately-scaled models of
ships in the University's 360-foot tow-
ing tank in order to find out how the
full-scale ships would behave under
given operating conditions.
The initial run with the new model
was made last month with Dean Ste-
phen S. Attwood of the U-M College
of Engineering at the controls. Harold
F. Robinson, technical manager of the
Bethelehem Steel Company's Shipbuild-
ing Division and a classmate of Att-
wood's was aboard.
The new towing carriage can hit 21
feet per second, about double the speed
of the old machine, and makes possible
planning boat measurements and hy-
drofoil work that couldn't be done with
the old carriage, according to Prof.
Richard B. Couch, chairman of the
U-M Department of Naval Architect-
ure and Marine Engineering.
It is presently being used to make
oscillator maneuvering tests of large,
full ships in shallow water and re-
stricted channels, Prof. Couch said.
This research is being carried out by.
Prof. Seizo Motora of Tokyo Univer-
sity and U-M graduate students and is
supported jointly by the U-M and the
Society of Naval Architects.
For comparison data, full scale steer-
ing measurements were made on the
Great Lakes ore carrier Benjamin Fair-
less.
Research work is also going on in
basic studies in resistance and propul-
sion under the sponsorship of the U.S.
Maritime Administration.

TRIPS THROUGH THE STRATOSPHERE
WITHOUT LEAVING THE GROUND
A computer will be the heart of the navigation and control
systems for future aircraft designed to operate in the
stratosphere.
Such a computer is now being built by IBM for an advanced
aircraft under development for the Air Force. Harley Cloud,
an IBM engineer, is developing simulation equipment which
will put the computer through its paces. His equipment
will simulate the systems functions encountered by the
250-ton aircraft at Mach 3, fourteen miles up, with poten-
tial adversaries in wait.
Without the airplane leaving the ground, his testing equip-
ment will simulate such inputs to the computer as accelera-
tion in the inertial system, velocity in the doppler radar, and
air pressure in the air data subsystem. These simulation
techniques will help protect lead time for the entire project.
Responsibilities Are Large. As a group leader, he is direct-
ing the design, laboratory breadboarding, electrical draft-
ing, testing and evaluation of this ingenious equipment.
It's a very responsible job for a man out of school less
than four years.
But age is no barrier to advancement in IBM. In the fast-
moving world of data systems, it is ideas and the ability
to do the job that count. And fresh new ideas and abilities
are always welcomed at IBM—whether in development, re-
search, manufacturing, or programming.
If you feel you might be interested in one of these fields
associated with data systems at IBM, you might discuss
it with the IBM representative. Your placement office can

and women's. Styles change each year,
skirt hems going up and down, and
men's clothes become wide or narrow,
round or square. As the designers run
out of new ideas they revert to styles
of past years. For a person to be up-
to-date in style, it would be necessary
for him to purchase nearly half a com-
plete wardrobe each year. It seems that
some industries spend more research
time and money on producing a differ-
ent appearing product rather than a
better product.
The third case of obsolescence of
quality again finds the automobile as
a good example. It is a familiar sight
to see an automobile, which is only a
few years old, decayed with rust and
in need of major repair work just to
keep it in running condition. Home
appliances seem to need costly repairs
much too often. There is a trend among
manufacturers and distributors to per-
suade the consumer to buy a new
product rather than having the old
repaired.
One of the alternatives mentioned
was the sale of more products to the
consumer. This is not planned obso-
lescence, but it is related to the prob-
lem. Note the large increase in two
and three car families in the last dec-
ade. Another example is the cottage
or summer home. These are just mani-
festations of our rising standard of
living, but it is difficult to predict how
the future American will spend his
increased earning power.
Another example is the use of dis-
posable products. These are used once
and then thrown away, such as bev-
erage containers. The use of these
products and the early replacement of
other products is causing a serious
drain on our natural resources.
Industry Improving Situation
Industry recognizes their responsibil-
ity to the economy and is making an
effort to solve the problems. The aver-
age automobile in 1930 was scrapped
after about 35,000 miles, while the
present day car lasts 100,000 miles. This
is certainly a significant gain. Lee Iaoc-
ca, general manager of Ford Motor
Company, recently said that Ford's re-
search is directed toward producing an
automobile that would require main-
tenance only every 30,000 miles. A car
of this type would require only gaso-
line and washings until 30,000 miles
was reached. Manufacturers are now
making auto bodies more rust resistant.
The August 15, 1961 issue of Time
contained an article on Maytag wash-
ing machines. Maytag, which produces
washing machines among other prod-
ucts, is dropping its other products and
concentrating its research on washers
and dryers. This is contrary to the
present trend of corporate diversifica-
tion. Their goal is to produce a washer
that will require little or no mainte-
nance for a ten year period.
Can anything be done to eliminate
planned obsolescence? If consumers
were to patronize the companies that
produced the most dependable goods,
the competitors would be forced to
raise their production standards. By
spending more for the service indus-
tries, which include travel, insurance,
and recreation, the economy can be-
come more independent of the consum-
er goods industry and overcome the
need for planned obsolescence. The
service industries employ many people,
but produce no goods. This would help
to solve the employment and natural
resource problems. Increasing govern-
ment services, both federal and local,
along with establishing better educa-
tional facilities and public works would
improve certain malignant social con-
ditions and at the same time provide
employment for many. This would re-
quire higher taxes, but the taxpayer
could afford this without too much
hardship. The result would make the
economy more independent of consum-
er goods and therefore eliminate the
need for planned obsolescence.
Is planned obsolescence increasing or
decreasing? Is our economy going to
be more or less dependent on this
waste in the future? These are difficult
questions to answer, but they do de-
serve further investigation.

Cooling space pilots from launch to landing
New concepts in airborne cooling have become vital to the
progress of America's space program. For example, Garrett
is now developing an advanced system for the Boeing Dyna-
Soar manned space glider. It will use the liquid hydrogen
fuel for the vehicle's own accessory power system to control
the temperature of the pilot and equipment throughout the

SPOTLIGHTS
PROGRESS
by MARK LUTVAK
New Carveyor
An advanced transportation con-
cept designed to smooth rush hour
traffic and provide economical service
throughout the day as part of a com-
munity program to focus attention on
city problems. More than 600 of Balti-
more's leading citizens and officials will
gather for the opening of the continu-
ing program—called "Focal Point"—
to study possible solutions to metro-
politan area problems.
In considering transportation for the
city's downtown sector, the citizens will
look at the Carveyor concept, in which
pedestrian traffic moves on conveyor
belts. In the system, passengers are
seated in cars with capacities ranging
from four to 10 persons, depending on
peak loads to be handled, and moved
over a conveyor belt at a speed of 15
miles an hour. Operation is non-stop
on an elevated or subway basis so that
the cars easily outdistance normal sur-
face traffic.
At boarding and exit points, the cars
are slowed on carefully timed rollers
to about half of normal walking speed.
At these points, they are paralleled by
moving sidewalks for entry and exit.
With car motion and movement of the
sidewalk at the same rate, there is
never a problem of stepping from a
moving car to a stationary platform.
It is the only transportation system
that provides immediate service to rid-
ers, thus avoiding crowd build-up at
terminals. Since there is always a con-
tinuous flow of cars at stations, riders
don't have to worry about "waiting
for the next train."
Carveyor systems already are under
consideration in Atlanta, Ga., as part
of an overall program to revitalize
downtown transportation, and in New
York, where a proposed island apart-
ment development would rely on the
system for internal transportation. The
proposed New York community of
70,000 residents would be closed to all
vehicular traffic other than emergency
vehicles.
In Atlanta, transportation consult-
ants see the Carveyor as a medium of
transporting office and store employees
from rapid transit or parking terminals
on the fringe of the downtown area.
An elevated structure is proposed to
run over sidewalks and span streets.
In the East Island, New York, pro-
posal, the Carveyor would carry passen-
gers through an enclosed concourse
between apartment buildings and com-
mercial stores, terminating at one end
of the island at a subway terminal pro-
viding access to Manhattan and Queens
via an existing line.
High Thrust Engine
The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's F-l engine, the most
powerful rocket unit known, was shown
to newsmen for the first time.
The test program is another step in
the build-up to a test of the engine at
full thrust of 1.5 million pounds and
a duration of two and one-half minutes.
The decision to develop the F-l was
one of the first made by NASA after
its establishment in October, 1958. The
decision was made on the basis of an
urgent, foreseeable need for a large
thrust engine to power large space ve-
hicles for such missions as manned
circumlunar flights and landing a man
on the moon and returning him to
Earth.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Nova—existed only as a design con-
cept for several years.
It is possible, however, that first use
of the F-l engine could be in an ad-
vanced Saturn booster designed to ap-
proximately double the power of the
Saturn C-l booster. One possible con-
figuration would be powered by a
cluster of two F-l's for a lift-off thrust
of 3 million pounds.
The Saturn C-l, with 1.5 million
pounds lift-off thrust developed by
eight Rocketdyne H-l engines, will
carry the three-man Apollo spacecraft
in Earth orbital scientific missions of
up to two weeks. The second stage
is the 90,000-pound-thrust S-IV stage
powered by six Pratt &amp; Whitney RL-
10-A3 liquid hydrogen-liquid oxygen
engines.
First test launch of the C-l booster
with two inert upper stages is sched-
uled for later this year. The advanced
Saturn referred to above could be used
to place the Apollo spacecraft into or-
bit about the moon and return it to
Earth. One configuration under study
for the first stage would consist of two
F-l engines; the second (S-II) stage of
four J-2 200,000-pound-thrust liquid
hydrogen-liquid oxygen engines also
under development by Rocketdyne; and
the third stage would be the S-IV. This
possible configuration would be capa-
ble of lifting an approximate 30,000-
pound payload on a lunar mission.
The mission of Nova will be to
boost the Apollo to lunar landings and
return to Earth. The configuration of
Nova is under intensive study by
NASA. Many of the versions under
study employ F-l engines in the first
stage and some use F-l's in the second.
One of a number of configurations em-
ploying F-l engines consists of a boost-
er made up of four clusters of two
F-l's—or eight engines generating a
total of 12-million-pounds thrust. A
possible second stage would be a clust-
er of two F-l's. The 200,000-pound-
thrust J-2 engine—in a cluster of four
—would power the third stage in this
study configuration. This vehicle would
have a capability of lifting some 160
tons into Earth orbit or some 50 tons
on an escape mission.
In January, 1959, a 8102 million
NASA contract for development of a
full-scale 1.5-million-pound-thrust en-
gine was initiated. This was followed
by a long series of exacting tests. Each
component was tested and re-tested to
assure maximum reliability and top per-
formance. Then, in a series of carefully
prepared tests, the components were
gradually assembled for full-system
firings.
The first complete engine test was
made on June 13, 1961, at the $15-
million high thrust test area. Approxi-
mately one million pounds of thrust
was generated at that time. This
achievement was of high significance to
the U.S. space effort.
Small Reactor
A self-propelled space power unit
concept for Project SPUR has been
proposed.
Using a typewriter-size atomic reac-
tor to heat and expand liquid metal
through a turbine, SPUR will generate
300,000 to one million watts of elec-
tricity over a 1-3 year period. In the
concept this power will be applied to
ion motors using cesium (a rare gas)
to move the unit to its final destina-
tion in space.
Technical breakthroughs allowing the
use of extremely high loop tempera-
tures will make SPUR the first large
output space power package of prac-
tical size and weight for launching by

More than one million pounds of thrust streams from the F-l rocket engine dur-
ing first series of tests of complete flyable system.

Molecular Slide Rule
Scientists have demonstrated a unique
electronic device which might best be
described as a "molecular slide rule."
The tiny device electronically performs
multiplication and division by a proc-
ess similar to that used in the familiar
mechanical slide rule so widely used
house through the principle of molecu-
lar electronics.
Molecular electronics is a promising
new approach to electronic systems. It
does away with traditional circuits built
from arrays of electronic components
such as tubes, transistors, resistors, and
the like. Instead, the same function is
performed by rearranging the internal
structure of a solid semiconductor crys-
tal. Electronic behavior occurring with-

New solid state molecular "slide rule" vs. the engineer's favorite companion.
for mathematical calculations. Yet the
new multiplier-divider has no conven-
tional electronic components or cir-
cuitry. It is simply a solid slice of sili-
con about the size of the head of a
thumbtack and as thick as a few sheets
of paper.
The molecular slide rule is the latest
subsystem, or functional electronic
block, to be demonstrated by Westing-
in or between regions in the crystal
gives the same effect as an entire elec-
tronic circuit (subsystem), or even a
whole system.
The multiplying and dividing func-
tion performed by the new functional
block is equivalent to that done by an
array of four separate diodes, or three
diodes and a transistor. The functional
block, however, is capable of greater
accuracy than the assembly of indi-
vidual components.
Molecular Blocks Perform
Various Functions
The new functional electronic block
multiplies by adding together voltages
that are logarithms of the quantities
to be multiplied. The logarithm of a
number is the power to which a fixed
base number (usually 10) must be rais-
ed in order to equal the number (call-
ed the antilogarithm). A slide rule is
marked off in logarithmic scales and is
labeled with the corresponding anti-
logarithms. To multiply two numbers,
the sliding and fixed scales are adjusted
to add their logarithms. The product,
or antilogarithm, is then read directly
from the instrument.
The molecular slide rule performs
in a similar way, but electronically by
means of semiconductor junctions. An
electric current fed into a junction gives
a voltage across the junction propor-
tional to the logarithm of the current.
An input of two currents into two
junctions gives a voltage which is their
logarithmic sum. The antilogarithm,
measured at the output of the func-
tional block, is the product of multi-
plying them together.
Just as in a slide rule, division is
the opposite process. The currents are
fed into the multiplier-divider in such
a way that their two logarithms sub-
tract instead of add.
Used for multiplication or division,
the new device has an input range of
10 to one and an output range of 100
to one. Its accuracy in multiplying,
dividing is within five percent.

on how to plan your career
What kind of engineers
make steel?
The answer is mechanical engineers,
chemical engineers, electrical engineers,
mining engineers, industrial engineers,
civil engineers, and, of course, metal-
lurgical engineers. There are others,
too, but our listing covers the ones
most frequently encountered.
It's a common misconception that
college-trained metallurgists dominate
the steel industry. Not so. Every major
engineering degree is represented with-
in the management ranks of a steel
company.
It makes sense. The mining and
processing of minerals obviously sug-
gests the need for Mining Engineers.
Then come the chemical processes of
coke-making, smelting, refining. Fuels
are consumed, valuable by-products
are made. Is it any wonder steelmaking
calls for Chemical Engineers?
And how about the machinery, the
mills, the furnaces, the instrumenta-
tion that make up a modern steel plant?
Mechanical Engineers design them,
and frequently supervise installation.
Civil Engineers design and put up the
buildings to house them, and the feed
lines to keep them supplied.
Power? Steel is the biggest industrial
consumer of electric power. You can-
not conceive of a greater concentration
of electrical equipment than in a
modern steel mill. And many steel
plants generate electric power, too.
Electrical Engineers are busy fellows
in the steel industry.
Steelmaking calls for volume pro-
duction, complex and scientific, often
highly automated. Steel companies
make numerous finished products, too,
from nuts and bolts to nuclear-powered
cruisers. The Industrial Engineer finds

plenty to do around steel.
What's more, the above comments
fail to make perhaps the most im-
portant point—interchangeability. We
have found that there are endless op-
portunities for men with any one of
the engineering degrees we have men-
tioned to handle jobs entailing great
responsibility. The supervisor of a h uge
open-hearth department, or a giant
rolling mill, might well be an M.E., a
Ch. E., a Met. E., an I.E., or C.E.
Sales Engineers—Because of the na-
ture of our products, Bethlehem sales-
men are best equipped when they, too,
are engineers. For a man with a tech-
nical background and a "sales person-
ality," there are splendid opportunities
with Bethlehem Steel.
Shipbuilding— As the world's largest
privately owned shipbuilding and ship
repair organization, Bethlehem offers
careers to Marine Engineers and Naval
Architects, as well as to engineers in
many other categories.
The Loop Course—This program was
established some 40 years ago, to select
and train well-qualified college gradu-
ates for careers in the Bethlehem or-

ganization. It was so named because of
an observational circuit (or "loop") of
a steel plant. After a five weeks'
basic training period, which is held
once a year at company headquarters,
in Bethlehem, Pa., loopers receive
their first assignments, which call for
specialized training that may last for
a few weeks or for as long as a year.
Next comes on-the-job training, and
the looper is on his way.
Big and Diversified—Because of its
size and diversity, Bethlehem Steel
offers unlimited opportunities to "get
ahead." One of the nation's largest
industrial corporations, with over
140,000 employees, we are engaged in
raw materials mining and processing;
basic steelmaking and the production
of a wide range of steel products;
manufacturing; structural-steel fabri-
cating and erecting; and shipbuilding
and ship repair. A new centralized
research facility, the Bethlehem Steel
Company-Homer Research Laborator-
ies, costing in excess of $25 million,
located in Bethlehem, Pa., rivals the
finest in any industry.
Read our Booklet—The eligibility re-
quirements for the Loop Course, as
well as a description of the way it
operates, are more fully covered in our
booklet, "Careers with Bethlehem Steel
and the Loop Course." It will answer
most of your questions. Copies are
available in most college placement
offices, or may be obtained by writing
to Manager of Personnel, Bethlehem
Steel Company, Bethlehem, Pa.
All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, creed, color, or national origin.

Hot Form It Hot coining this Malleable trans-
mission part reduces finished cost . . . eliminates
three cutting operations required by the previ-
ously used steel part.
Roll It Oil grooves in lawnmower crankshafts
and splines in compressor crankshafts are just two
of many places where rolling proves more eco-
nomical than machining.


Punch It Holes with diameters greater than the
thickness of the metal can be punched in Malle-
able. Two round holes and a square hole are
punched simultaneously in this idler arm.
Spin It Malleable's ductility permits the sleeve
and end disc in this ball joint to be held in place
by spinning the Malleable housing into a strong,
permanent flange.

'SORE THROAT


• Minuteman was plagued with a chronic "sore throat."
Existing nozzle liner throat materials wouldn't withstand
Minuteman's tremendous solid-fuel rocket blasts
with temperatures exceeding 5400 °F.
Allison metallurgists went to work on the problem.
They tried oxyacetylene spray coating—but maximum
attainable temperature was too low for the coating
materials required.
Next, electroplating was tried—but the coat bond
was poor, the surface rough.
Then, Allison laboratories came through with advance-
ments in the application of plasma-sprayed tungsten.
Here was the solution. The dense, sound "plasma-
tung"e coating passed its solid-fuel firing tests with
no erosion, guttering, or nozzle pressure drop!
Metallurgy is but one field in which Allison is scoring
significant advancements. We currently operate
laboratories for virtually any requirement—space
propulsion, physical optics, radio-isotope, infra-red, solid
state physics, physical chemistry, direct conversion,
heat transfer, physics of liquid metals, phase dynamics,
fluid dynamics and rocket propulsion, to name a few.

Population Explosion.
Despite these arguments, however,
some people believe that the spread of
nuclear weapons will increase stability.
This view is based on the assumption
that as more and more countries ob-
tain nuclear weapons the dangers in-
volved will increase so significantly
and the consequences of using nuclear
weapons will be so serious that it is
unlikely that anybody will use them.
Finally, a third group holds the view
that growth in N-Club membership is
inevitable and, therefore, the best al-
ternative open to the United States is
to go along and attempt to guide the
situation into the least harmful chan-
nels.
ACTION: The Alternatives
We have now reached the point
where the vital issue can be brought
into sharp focus: What course of ac-
tion should the United States pursue
to insure the most desirable results?
Naturally, this depends on what one
considers the most desirable results. On
the basis of the previous discussion we
must conclude that the most desirable
result is to stop the spread of nuclear
power. It seems clear to us that the
advantages of having a limited number
of nuclear powers far outweighs any
disadvantages.
If this is true, then what actions
should we take to insure that the N-
Club maintains a limited membership?
As far as the "enemy" is concerned,
there is little we can do. For example,
there is practically no chance that we
can prevent Red China from becoming
a nuclear power.
On the other side, what if one of
our allies decide, as France did, to de-
velop a nuclear capability? If we feel
that another nuclear power can only
add to the dangers the world faces,
what should we do to prevent any fur-
ther spread among our allies? To an-
swer this question we might look again
at the three main reasons why being a
nuclear power is desirable—for offens-
ive reasons, defensive reasons, and po-
litical reasons. However, as far as our
allies are concerned it seems reasonable
to dismiss the offensive motive and
concentrate on the other two.
Until recently there has been a strong
undercurrent of opinion among our
allies, especially in Europe, that our
promise to retaliate if our friends were
attacked was not a very strong guaran-
tee. The reasoning was that it would
be foolhardy for us to get involved
and draw fire upon ourselves. Carried
one step further this line of reasoning
concludes that it is necessary for the
nations of Western Europe to have
their own deterent force. Lately, how-
ever, our stand on the Berlin issue
seems to have refuted these doubts and
relieved some of the pressure for indi-
vidual nuclear forces in Europe.
However, a strong stand on our part
does not alter the prestige motive for
becoming a member of the N-Club.
For example, once France becomes a
full nuclear power, West Germany will
be carried along with the tide of pop-
ular opinion and be forced to develop
their own nuclear potential, regardless
of the lack of necessity for defensive
reasons. And after West Germany what
about Italy, etc? The only solution to
this political problem seems to be nu-
clear disarmament by the existing N-
Club members. This could be a strong
persuasive force against the develop-
ment of nuclear weapons by others.
Unfortunately, nuclear disarmament or
even an effective test ban seems quite
remote at the present time.
No Longer Exclusive
In conclusion, we must agree gener-
ally with those who feel that an in-
crease in the number of nuclear powers
is inevitable—the N-Club is going to
lose some of its exclusiveness. As this
development takes place we must also
agree with those who believe that the
world situation is going to become
more unstable. We can only hope that
it does not reach the explosive kindling
point where a small mistake or mis-
calculation can set off a nuclear war.
In the end, our only hope is mu-
tual, effective nuclear disarmament.
This seems quite unlikely in view of
the present Communist goals and de-
sires. Nevertheless, it must continue to
be our major goal. Nothing short of
this can insure the continued existence
of life on this planet.

A little x-ray news
More precious than rubies is confidence
in the importance of what one does for
a living. One thing we do for a living
is to manufacture x-ray film. Unkind
words are rarely spoken about society's
need for x-ray film. Now we have news
about x-ray film and need to make it
seem important. Easy.
The first piece of news has it that
Kodak x-ray film of high contrast and
fine grain is now obtainable with emul-
sion on one side only. Ties in to the
current push for great structural strength
in small mass. Load-bearing members
are now getting so thin that putative
flaws on their radiographs have to be
checked out with a microscope. Since
a microscope can focus on only one side
of the film at a time, it's better to have
the other side blank. Simple, yes; trivial,
no. Manufacturing and distribution
problems on our scale are rarely trivial.
The second piece of news much
exceeds the first in importance. You
have been given estimates by various
authorities of how much radiation you
and your children can expect to soak
up, barring disaster. You have been
told how much to figure for medical
and dental radiological examination
over a lifetime. Meanwhile we have
been quietly goofing up the statistics!
We have been upping the response of
the films. With the latest step, the same
amount of examination requires half or
a third as much radiation as before.
Just privately rejoice a little at how the
deal has been sweetened a bit for you,
statistically.
To John!
We are not alone in polypropylene.
Seven other large and reputable com-
panies are known to be playing in the
game against each other and us. All we
players must be very brave, hide our
nervousness, and raise our glasses high
in a toast to the memory of Senator
John Sherman, who believed in the
great public good that comes of free
and untrammeled competition.
(Other nations have ambitious poly-
propylene plans of their own and are
outproducing the U.S. in polypropylene
right now in the aggregate. The peoples
of the earth had better start making
their artifacts out of polypropylene —
and fast!)
As the game gets under way, we hold
certain strong cards. Our Tenite poly-
propylene
• Can be polymerized from propylene
by two completely different processes of
our own devising, both free and clear of
the U.S. patents of others.
• Comes in many flow rates.
• Comes in the widest variety of repro-
ducible colors.
• Is exceedingly well fortified by our
own antioxidants against oxidative dete-
rioration.
• Has "built-in hinge," i.e. tremendous
fatigue resistance under flexure.
• Weathers very well when extruded in
monofilament for webbing and cordage,

Interview with General Electric's Dr. J. H. Hollomon
Manager—General Engineering Laboratory

Q. Dr. Hollomon, what characterizes
the new needs and wants of society?
A. There are four significant changes
in recent times that characterize these
needs and wants.
1. The increases in the number of
people who live in cities: the accom-
panying need is for adequate control
of air pollution, elimination of trans-
portation bottlenecks, slum clearance,
and adequate water resources.
2. The shift in our economy from agri-
culture and manufacturing to "serv-
ices": today less than half our working
population produces the food and goods
for the remainder. Education, health,
and recreation are new needs. They
require a new information technology
to eliminate the drudgery of routine
mental tasks as our electrical tech-
nology eliminated routine physical
drudgery.
3. The continued need for national
defense and for arms reduction: the
majority of our technical resources
is concerned with research and devel-
opment for military purposes. But
increasingly, we must look to new tech-
nical means for detection and control.
4. The arising expectations of the peo-
ples of the newly developing nations:
here the "haves" of our society must
provide the industry and the tools for the
"have-nots" of the new countries if they
are to share the advantages of mod-
ern technology. It is now clearly recog-
nized by all that Western technology is
capable of furnishing the material
goods of modern life to the billions
of people of the world rather than
only to the millions in the West.
We see in these new wants, prospects
for General Electric's future growth
and contribution.
Q. Could you give us some examples?
A. We are investigating techniques for
the control and measurement of air and
water pollution which will be appli-
cable not only to cities, but to individual
households. We have developed, for
Society Has New Needs
and Wants—Plan Your
Career Accordingly
DR. HOLLOMON is responsible for General Electric's centralized, advanced engineering
activities. He is also an adjunct professor of metallurgy at RPI, serves in advisory posts
for four universities, and is a member of the Technical Assistance panel of President
Kennedy's Scientific Advisory Committee. Long interested in emphasizing new areas of oppor-
tunity for engineers and scientists, the following highlights some of Dr. Hollomon's opinions.
example, new methods of purifying
salt water and specific techniques for
determining impurities in polluted air.
General Electric is increasing its inter-
national business by furnishing power
generating and transportation equip-
ment for Africa, South America, and
Southern Asia.
We are looking for other products
that would be helpful to these areas to
develop their economy and to improve
their way of life. We can develop new
information systems, new ways of stor-
ing and retrieving information, or
handling it in computers. We can
design new devices that do some of the
thinking functions of men, that will
make education more effective and per-
haps contribute substantially to reducing
the cost of medical treatment. We can
design new devices for more efficient
"paper handling" in the service
industries.
Q. If I want to be a part of this new
activity, how should I plan my career?
A. First of all, recognize that the
meeting of needs and wants of society
with products and services is most
important and satisfying work. Today
this activity requires not only knowl-
edge of science and technology but
also of economics, sociology and the
best of the past as learned from the
liberal arts. To do the engineering
involved requires, at least for young
men, the most varied experience possi-
ble. This means working at a number
of different jobs involving different
science and technology and different
products. This kind of experience for
engineers is one of the best means of
learning how to conceive and design
—how to be able to meet the changing
requirements of the times.
GENERAL
For scientists, look to those new fields
in biology, biophysics, information, and
power generation that afford the most
challenge in understanding the world
in which we live.
But above all else, the science explo-
sion of the last several decades means
that the tools you will use as an engi-
neer or as a scientist and the knowledge
involved will change during your life-
time. Thus, you must be in a position
to continue your education, either on
your own or in courses at universities
or in special courses sponsored by
the company for which you work.
Q. Does General Electric offer these
advantages to a young scientist or
engineer?
A. General Electric is a large diver-
sified company in which young men
have the opportunity of working on a
variety of problems with experienced
people at the forefront of science and
technology. There are a number of
laboratories where research and ad-
vanced development is and has been
traditional. The Company offers incen-
tives for graduate studies, as well as
a number of educational programs
with expert and experienced teachers.
Talk to your placement officers and
members of your faculty. I hope you
will plan to meet our representative
when he visits the campus.

A second sun: made in U.S.A.
The sun produces energy through nuclear fusion—a gigantic
hydrogen explosion that has been going on for more than 500
million years. We may duplicate it. Scientists at Princeton
University are experimenting with a Stellerator to attain con-
trolled nuclear fusion that will produce endless energy from the
hydrogen in sea water. The Stellerator is supported by 17 USS
Quality Forgings that could be made from only one material
—a new, non-magnetic Stainless Steel called Tenelon, devel-
oped by United States Steel.
Although the Stellerator is strictly experimental, there would
be no nuclear programs of any type without steel. The very
heart of an atomic generating plant—the reactor vessel—must
be steel, whether it's the power plant of a nuclear submarine
or a commercial generating station. In addition to the reactor,
the power station literally bristles with tons of special steels
developed in the laboratories and produced in the mills of
United States Steel. If nuclear power is the door to America's
future, the key Is steel. America Grows With Steel.

Westinghouse puts the future in your hands

Today's electricity is produced in some of the biggest, most ingenious and precise equipment ever built. One part. . . the turbine ... is as
big as a locomotive, revolves at the speed of sound, is so hot it glows a cherry red, and its parts fit together like a fine watch. That's today's
best method, and it's gone about as far as it can go. And so Westinghouse, which builds this equipment, is experimenting with completely
new methods of producing electricity. Some of them are rather exotic. One method produces electricity by shooting a stream of gas between
a set of magnets. Sounds simple, but this is like handling the roaring exhaust of a rocket. The gas travels 2,000 miles an hour at 5,000
degrees F. This method is magnetohydrodynamics. Called MHD for short. It is a jawbreaker of a problem. But Westinghouse and other
companies are nearing a solution. A Westinghouse MHD generator has produced electricity for 52 minutes. That's five times as long as
any other has ever run. If MHD "works," we will be in a new world of electric power. Problems like this and other problems face talented
scientists and engineers at Westinghouse. For information about a career with Westinghouse, an equal opportunity employer, see our
representative when he visits your campus or write: L. H. Noggle, Westinghouse Educational Department, Pittsburgh 21, Pennsylvania.

in valves
Again, JENKINS VALVES
are the bankers' choice
Taller, perhaps, but there's no finer bank building
in New York than the new Head Office of United
California Bank on Spring Street in Los Angeles'
financial area. Headquarters for 122 offices in Cali-
fornia, this 370,000 sq. ft. building is an outstand-
ing example of the excitingly modern architecture
and superb engineering and construction which
draws many building experts to Southern California
for a "look-see."
There's an expected "California difference" in the
design and decor of this bank. But a significant fact
is that, like so many of the great bank buildings in
New York and other cities, the valves that control
the piping systems bear the same "Diamond and
Signature" trademark.
Obviously, California bankers and their architects
and engineers agree with their contemporaries
everywhere about the soundest investment in
valves. To assure a building-lifetime of trouble-free,
economical valve service, they call for JENKINS.

COVER STORY
The Laser (Light Amplification by Stim-
ulated Emission of Radiation) is a de-
vice for producing monochromatic, com-
pletely phase coherent, intense beams of
light. Using this device, Michigan physi-
cists have succeeded in producing the
first and second harmonics of a light
wave. Steve Molotoris, our cover artist,
represents the Laser with a mixed beam
of light entering and the monochromatic
beam leaving the mysterious "Black box."
Perhaps the background represents the
nebulous future for the amazing device.

with respect to your career choice?
Of course, you are . .. and should be. But don't
overlook the fact that "thinking big" really applies
to your own personal growth and achievement—
and not necessarily to the physical size of an
organization. And that's an important reason for
investigating the opportunities here at Sikorsky
Aircraft.
We believe that our company offers just the
"right-sized" environment for young engineers
seeking strong personal identification and stature
opportunities. The technical talent we require can
enjoy diversified activities in a field that permits
full expression of engineering imagination and
professional competence.
At Sikorsky, we pioneered helicopters. Our
continuing objective is to further advance V /STOL
(vertical short take-off and landing) aircraft.
The engineering programs are stimulating and
far-ranging. Assignments could include joining an
electronic team of twenty to thirty associates—or—
working with a highly selective group of four or
five on sophisticated problems of antenna radiation,
instrumentation, automatic pilot, automatic stabi-
lization—to name a few.
Your opportunity for personal growth could be
here . . . now. Can we help you "think big" towards
that goal?

Good reasons why I
chose American Oil
by
"Here you're treated as an individual. The Com-
pany respects and recognizes individual achieve-
ment. The work is challenging and affords the
chance to use your own ingenuity."
That's Don Anderson talking, 31-year-old
mechanical engineer engaged in testing lubricants
at American Oil Company. Don spent six years
in the military service prior to earning his
Bachelor of Science degree at the University of
Illinois. Don, the father of two children, explains,
"The routes to the top are many and varied.
There's plenty of opportunity for advancement
—and that's the best kind of job security I can
think of."
The fact that American Oil attracts talented
college graduates like Don Anderson may have
special meaning to you as you plan your career.
Don is one of many young scientists and engi-
neers at American Oil who are growing profes-
sionally in a wide range of research projects.
There are challenging opportunities in many
areas. Chemists, chemical engineers, mechanical
engineers, physicists, mathematicians and metal-
lurgists can find interesting and important work
in their own fields.

• One in a series of messages
on how to plan your career
Hopping or marching-
two paths to a career
A career is sometimes defined as a
succession of jobs, whether with a suc-
cession of employers, or within a single
company.
A man is commonly said to be
"hopping" when he progresses by
switching from one employer to
another.
The man who sticks with a single
employer can be said to progress by
"marching."
Marching Pays Off—There are many
advantages to a one-company career.
It's obvious that tenure is accom-
panied by status, security, and bene-
fits that build in value as the years go
by. More significant, perhaps, are the
intangibles. You can't put a dollar
value on your familiarity with the
organization and the people in it.
And the respect they have for you is
equally important. The man who is
dedicated to his employer, and confi-
dent of his ability to progress without
looking afield, is free of distracting
tensions, free to concentrate his full
energies on the job at hand. And,
especially to the family man, just
"being settled" is mighty reassuring.
Finding the Right Employer — The
problem facing a graduating senior is
to locate a prospective employer that
offers an ambitious man promising

opportunities for a truly rewarding
and satisfying career. The best answer
we know of is to look for a company
with a firm policy of "promotion from
within." And a second consideration
is the size and scope of the organiza-
tion.
Loopers are Career Men—Every year
Bethlehem Steel Company enrolls a
group of graduating seniors in the
Loop Course—the entire class makes
an observational circuit (or "loop") of
a steel plant during the basic training
period. We select qualified men for the
Loop Course on the basis of their
potential for careers in management,
and we train them accordingly. There
are about 2,000 loopers on the job at
Bethlehem, at all supervisory levels,
and in all of our diverse operations.
The Loop Course—New loopers report
to our general headquarters, in Beth-
lehem, Pa., usually early in July. They
attend a basic course of five weeks, in-
cluding lectures, classroom discus-
sions, educational films, and daily
plant visits. The Loop Course is not a
probationary period. After completion
of the course, every looper receives his
first assignment. Then, after reporting
to a plant, yard, or home office divi-
sion, he receives further orientation

before beginning on-the-job training.
Bethlehem loopers embark on their
careers with thorough training behind
them.
Big and Diversified—because of its
size and diversity, Bethlehem Steel
offers unlimited opportunities to "get
ahead." One of the nation's largest
industrial corporations, with over
140,000 employees, we are engaged in
raw materials mining and processing;
basic steelmaking and the production of
a wide range of steel products; manu-
facturing; structural-steel fabricating
and erecting; and shipbuilding and
ship repair. A new centralized research
facility, the Bethlehem Steel Company-
Homer Research Laboratories, costing
in excess of $25 million, located in
Bethlehem, Pa., rivals the finest in
any industry.
Read Our Booklet—The eligibility re-
quirements for the Loop Course, as
well as a description of the way it
operates, are more fully covered in our
booklet, "Careers with Bethlehem Steel
and the Loop Course." It will answer
most of your questions. Copies are
available in most college placement
offices, or may be obtained by writing

Steel Company, Bethlehem, Pa.

I took the opportunity of Thanksgiving vacation to call upon
two long-time friends of mine, friends whose opinions fre-
quently differ from mine. As often happens when I call upon
these people, several diverse subjects were discussed earnestly
and (if not learnedly) lengthily. And, as occasionally happens,
we were able to arrive at something approximating agreement
on a few of the topics we covered. A couple of the results thus
ground out might be of critical interest to Technic readers, so
here they are:
Fallout shelters . . . the philosophy of fallout shelter con-
struction and use has many aspects that are repugnant. If a
man goes to the expense and trouble to build such a structure,
it is a confession on his part that he assigns a fairly high prob-
ability to nuclear holocaust ... if such opinion were prevalent
amongst Americans, what sort of psychological condition would
we be in to believe in and work for peaceful solutions to world
problems? There is also the unavoidable little question of what
side of human nature to display toward less-prepared neighbors
who will seek shelter after attack . . . shelter owners seem to
have a predeliction for the dog-eat-dog, tough-luck-Charlie,
you-grasshopper-me-ant attitude.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


and heroic in the apparent will of shelter-building Americans
to survive, to preserve life. It is heartening that some of us
retain that same tenacious will-to-live that characterized the rise
of American democracy, and the Renaissance before. Cave-to-
cave is in most ways preferable to the alternative . . . dust to
dust.
Red vs. dead . . . which is better? This is a personal question,
one to be answered by each individual after careful examina-
tion of what life means to him. It is sort of like a decision on
religious preference; the logical and emotional appeals that
draw some to one faith repel others to the opposite pole of
belief.
A professor of mine expressed his sentiments this way: the
day after the 50-megaton blast, he opened his lecture with words
of regret over the moral decay of humanity. As he turned to
the board to take up course material, he sighed, "Next thing
they'll be telling us is that strontium 90 settles out in bourbon."
Aside from the philosophy of survival there is a practical
question or two to be answered: what assurance of survival
does a fallout shelter provide? Assuming that it is foolproof
against radioactivity, has the owner considered that in an attack
against the U. S. the enemy would likely not stop with mere
bombs? What about the bacteria sprays? the poison gas? the
paratroop invasion? the melting of the polar icecaps with lamp-
black to inundate our coastal areas?
Also, our economy and our national psychology are not
attack-proof. What would happen to stock prices? to the credit
system? to law and order? to sanity? What about mobs? or
suicides?
We believe that the only meaningful way to preserve our
lives is to preserve peace.

Edward H. Sussenguth, Jr. (B.A., Harvard '54; M.S. in E.E.,
MIT '59) has investigated the theoretical requirements of
an automated design system for advanced cryotron-circuit
computers.
HE WORKS WITH A NEW DIMENSION
IN COMPUTER DESIGN
Thin film cryotrons may make possible computers of small
size and truly prodigious speeds.
The speeds of today's computers are limited mainly by
device switching times. Speeds of cryotron computers would
be limited mainly by signal propagation times between
devices.
Automation of Logical Circuits. Edward Sussenguth has
studied methods of design which will reduce the distance
between devices to a minimum. He hopes that these will
contribute to a completely automatic design system.
Ultimately, then, the systems designer would specify his
needs in terms of Boolean equations and feed them into a
computer. The computer would (a) design the logical cir-

This is a big order, but Edward Sussenguth and his col-
leagues have already made significant progress. Their work
may well have a profound effect on computer systems in
the coming years.
Orientation: the future. One of the exciting things about
computer development is this orientation towards the
future. If a man wants to match his personal growth with
the growth of computer systems, his future can be virtually
unlimited. This is true of all the fields associated with com-
puter systems —research, development, manufacturing,
programming, marketing. The IBM representative will be

DYNA-SOAR
AND
APOLLO
The leading entries of the U. S. in the Grand Prix
of outer space are the basis of the American
effort to land a man on the moon.

"May 1 have a round trip ticket on
the next flight to Lunar City?"
"Yes, sir. That will be $4500 plus
tax."
It will be many years before man is
able to travel to and from the Moon
with such ease. However, America is
pressing forward to make such a trip
a reality. The next step in America's
blueprint to reach the Moon is project
Dyna-Soar. The project got its name
from the contraction of the phrase
"dynamic soaring," which refers to the
intricate and complex maneuvers a pi-
lot will be required to make in order
to bring his craft through the Earth's
atmosphere and in for a safe landing.
Versatility of Dyna-Soar
This is America's first serious effort
to design a versatile space vehicle. For
example, it could be used to inspect
unknown objects or as a working plat-
form for maintenance and repairs of
satellites; it could transport personnel
between space stations and perform
space rescue operations if needed. In
addition to its versatility as a Space
Age repair wagon, it is potentially the
means for training a man to pilot a
space ship under actual spaceflight
conditions.
The Dyna-Soar project will be a
three step program. Step I will be con-
fined to sub-orbital flights down the
Atlantic Missile Range off Cape Canav-
eral with landings on various island
airstrips. After sufficient information is
gained from the sub-orbital flights,
Step II will follow with a series of
short manned flights into orbit. Step
III will be the actual conditioning of
pilots to operate with full control of
the ship in both orbital and deep space
flights.

Artist's conception of an actual landing on the Moon. The landing will, of course,
be made at a site that has been previously surveyed by an unmanned probe.
To reach the edge of space, the delta
winged craft will be boosted into orbit
at 18,000 miles per hour by the Titan
II rocket. The pilot at any time can
leave his orbit, but to avoid entering
the atmosphere at a high rate of speed,
he must be able to raise and dip the
nose of his spacecraft at just the right
moment. The nose of the ship must be
high enough to break the tremendous
speed, but if the nose is too high, the
drag on the ship overcomes the lifting
force on the wings. If the nose dips
too low the speed of the ship will in-
crease until the heat generated by at-
mospheric friction will be great enough
to vaporize the ship. Therefore, the pi-
lot must keep his ship between these
two extremes. This is the only area,
called the "corridor" by many pilots,
where the vehicle can safely return to
earth.
A simple analogy can be used to il-
lustrate the tremendous amount of ki-
netic energy which must be dissipated
to the atmosphere. The effect of impact
of the family automobile at 100 miles
per hour is equivalent to falling off a
thirteen story building. The kinetic en-
ergy of a Dyna-Soar vehicle re-entering
the atmosphere is equivalent to a fall
from a building two thousand miles
high. When it reached the ground the
impact would be so great that tempera-
tures of 20,000 to 25,000 degrees F.
would be reached.
As soon as the pilot leaves his orbit,
aerodynamic lift and drag are experi-
enced. Even at the fringes of space the
nose and leading edges of the frame
reach red hot temperatures. This con-
dition will continue for tens of minutes
until the tremendous energy possessed
by the plane is dissipated.
Problem of "Energy Management"
Encountered
Now a problem in "energy manage-
ment" must be solved by the pilot be-
fore he is able to reach his intended
destination safely. "The problem is like
being given an automobile with a tank
full of gas and told that you have to
reach New York City. The throttle is
locked in a wide-open position. You
can use only the brakes to control the
car. Along the highway are robbers
waiting to kill you. The gas tank is
fixed so that it will explode immedi-
ately on arrival in New York; if you
have one drop of fuel left in the car
you will also be killed. If you use your
brakes too much, you'll run out of
gas on the highway and be at the mercy
of those robbers. Now all you can do
is use the brakes and choose your routes
judiciously so that you arrive in New
York with a wide-open throttle—but
with precisely an empty gas tank."i
In addition to the energy manage-
ment problem, the pilot will experience
violent vibration and noise during the
initial phase of the journey while being
boosted into orbit by the Titan II mis-
sile. Another frightening event will be
the trip through the stratosphere on his
return trip; the communications equip-
ment will be blacked out. During this
critical part of the descent the speed
of the craft will become so high that
electrons will be stripped from the sur-
rounding atmosphere and enclose the
ship with an electronic blanket. During
this time, communication with the pilot
will be impossible. Still these problems
will not keep project Dyna-Soar from
being a success. Yet this is only one
step towards the unlimited horizons
that face man on the way to the stars.
Project Apollo
As project Dyna-Soar approaches
completion, project Apollo, our na-
tion's step to the Moon, will long be
under way. Work is now being carried
out by an eighteen man team attached
to the Space Task Group. The group
is emphasizing a new approach with
studies involving a modular-type vehi-
cle, which is able to change from an
Earth orbit vehicle to an Earth-Moon
vehicle with no fundamental changes.
The modular concept can be described
as a three-compartment vehicle with
equipment in one compartment that
could be varied or eliminated depend-
ing on its mission.
A command center re-entry vehicle,
containing the three man crew, will be
instrumented for controlling the flight
and will be the nerve center of the
craft. To this a propulsion module
would be added for flight path changes.
The propulsion module would be jet-
tisoned as soon as the changes were
complete. The third compartment
would contain special equipment for
special missions such as exploring the
Earth-Moon orbit, research in meteor-
ology, geodesy, communication and
other space sciences. Before this vehicle
can become a reality, problems worse
than those encountered during previous
projects (X-15, Mercury, Dyna-Soar)
must be overcome. Among the prob-
lems are:
(1) "Lack of specific knowledge
about solar flare energetic particles and
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


jeopardize extended space missions. A
method to predict periods of high flare
activity, or a method of light weight
shielding is needed.
(2) Space-biology advances are
needed including the need for a sophis-
ticated space garment; an ecological
system which could save launch weight
by recycling water; and studies of the
influences of weightlessness on toler-
ances to acceleration, isolation, con-
finement, illness, work cycles and fa-
tigue, restraint and support.
(3) Systems development, particu-
larly in the fields of three body me-
chanics, nonplanar trajectories, diverse
modes of referencing, navigation and
control. Also required are new devel-
opments in auxiliary power, calling for
further study of solar energy, along
with communication research in orient-
ed high gain antennas, low-noise am-
plifiers and signal coding.
(4) On board propulsion develop-
ments for launch escape, mission abort,
midcourse correction, orbit insertion
and removal, terminal corridor entry
control, orbit modification, retrograde
and rendezvous. These developments
bring related requirements for storable
fuels, restart capability, thrust vector-
ing, precision cutoff and high relia-
bility.'^
The most difficult of these problems
is finding a propellant to use in the
two propulsion modules that will be
used with the Apollo Moon landing
craft. A total velocity increase of
14,000 feet per second in two equal
increments must be achieved.
Fully automatic controls for the
Apollo will not exist, consequently,
the crew being in control will add
flexibility and reliability to the vehicle.
Unlike the Mercury project, Apollo
will be designed to survive both a land
and water impact. Like the Mercury
project it will incorporate a parachute
landing system with a long range locat-
ing device.
Nova Booster for Moon Landing
Work is now under way at Langley
Field, Va. on this project. Headed by
Robert O. Piland under the Flight
Systems Division, progress is being
made in the field of trajectory studies
involving an individual optimum flight
path for the lift drag ratio of each
configuration probable for the Apollo
vehicle. In addition studies involving
re-entry heating, structures, and guid-
ance are being carried on. Design of
Apollo will be based on using Atlas
Agena-B boosters. The Saturn will be
used to boost the Apollo on circum-
lunar missions while the Nova is to
be used for lunar landings.
James Webb of NASA indicates that
the Nova booster will measure 360 feet
long and use eight F-l engines for its
first stage. This would give the first
stage a thrust of twelve million pounds,
and with two upper stages, the Nova
would be capable of putting the
150,000 pound Apollo on the Moon.
The weight breakdown of the lunar
landing Apollo is: 100,000 pounds for
the deceleration propulsion unit, 35,000
pounds for the escape propulsion unit
for the return trip to earth, and 15,000
pounds for the command and control
module containing the crew.
With the recent push towards getting
a man on the Moon, the concurrent
programs connected with project Apol-
lo have been speeded up.
(1) "The last few Mercury capsules
will be modified to permit 24-hour
manned flights and week long flights
by simians and other animals to gather
data on prolonged weightlessness.
(2) The Surveyor program will be
doubled from seven to fourteen land-
ings in the 1963-1967 period, and the
Prospector will be redesigned to sup-
port the landing. It is expected that
the Surveyor will gather data on lunar
surface characteristics for design of the
Apollo's landing gear, while the mo-
bile Prospector will examine potential
landing areas.
(3) An orbital-rendezvous program
using Agena vehicles will parallel the
duel approach on the huge Nova boost-
er. This will cover the possibility that
Nova cannot be "man-rated" but can
be used to orbit the bulk of a lunar
vehicle. A Saturn booster could then
dock the crew in the spacecraft orbited
by the Nova, and the lunar mission
would proceed from that point.
(4) A key feature of the sixty mil-
lion dollar Manned Space Flight Lab-
oratory will be a giant new centrifuge
capable of whirling a three man cab.
No U.S. centrifuge can now do this
job, and NASA believes the capability
must be developed to train Apollo
crews under the most realistic condi-
tions."3
Overlapping the Mercury program,
which is scheduled to end in late 1962,
the first Agena-Apollo flights are sched-
uled for early 1962. Full scale orbiting
operations using the Apollo are sched-
uled for 1965, and circumlunar and
Moon landings using the Saturn and
Nova boosters are scheduled for 1970.
However, schedules can be changed and
with the present effort being made to
solve the technical problems that stand
in the way, who knows, an American
may walk on the lunar surface sooner
than we think.

AUTOMATED
TEACHING
A 1963 engineering graduate attends night school
in the year 1985. The extensive use of teaching
machines in all phases of education is startling
to our pre-machine educated friend.
by IRVING SALMEEN
Associate Editor
There is no teacher in the class. Well, no
human teacher. Just you and the machine. The
classroom is different from the ones in use
when you attended school. The room is a
honeycomb of compartments, each one four
feet square—just enough room for the machine
and you. Today all teaching is done this way;
well not all teaching, but all subjects that can
be broken into neat precise steps are taught by
machine. Things sure have changed in the 25
years since you graduated from the university.
It was just last week that your boss sug-
gested you take a night course in Chinese. He
said that you would find it useful when you
began that special project. Too bad you waited
a week to start the course; already you have
had several occasions to read material in Chi-
nese. That week might be hard to make up,
especially when the other members of the class
started on time. But the supervisor of the
teaching room said you needn't worry; the ma-
chine can always be tuned in at any point in the
course. Besides with only ten minutes extra ef-
fort for four nights, he said you could easily
catch up. That is one of the advantages of
teaching machines; you never have to worry
about your classmates; everything you do is
with the machine. You needn't worry about
showing your ignorance; the machine is the
only one that knows when you make a mistake.
And the "instructor" will never talk above
your head, nor will the class get ahead of you.
You operate the machine at your own pace and
the program is neatly devised so that each step
is almost ridiculously simple.
And best of all—no home work!
Well, don't just sit there, see what this busi-
ness is about. That's it—just sit down and
make yourself comfortable. You had better
read the instruction manual before you start
pushing buttons. (You'd think they'd make the
machine so that it would also teach you how
to use it.) That manual looks like it doesn't
get used very often, but then remember what

quite familiar with the various types of ma-
chines we employ here, however, for those of
you who have not kept up with the times, we
have this interesting manual. All of you under
the age of 30 have been completely educated
by machines so I need say little to you."
My, but that is a dull looking book, but
then educators have a knack for making inter-
esting things dull. Don't complain, its your
own fault you didn't progress with the times.
A SHORT INTRODUCTION
TO AUTOMATED TEACHING
You are seated in front of a teaching machine. Many
different designs are being used, but each is based on the
same educational psychology, called the Skinner method.
Regardless of the particular machine you are using, it
will have these general features:
1. One large window. The material to be learned is pre-
sented to you in a planned sequence of steps. This
instructional matter will appear in the large window
one step at a time in brief paragraphs. The complete
sequence of steps is called the program. Each step is
one basic unit of information called the item or frame.
2. A group of three buttons. One of these will be marked
"right" and another "wrong." The third is marked
"advance."
3. A series of buttons numbered in sequence beginning
with one and marked "selector."
4. A smaller slot provided with a continuous roll of paper
and arranged so that you are able to write on the paper.
5. On-off switch and a "response lever."
The particular course you are studying has been pro-
grammed and divided into a series of lessons or sets. Each
lesson will require approximately 30 minutes. The total
number of lessons will depend on the subject. The com-
plete program for the course is contained within the
machine. You select the lesson you want by pushing the
correct number on the selector buttons.
Each lesson begins when you turn the machine on and
select the lesson number. Selecting the lesson number
automatically brings the first item into view. After read-
ing the item, push the advance button. There will then
re-appear the same item with an important word or group
of words missing. You respond to the blank by writing
in the small slot the word or words you think best
complete the sentence.
When you have completed this step, pull the response
lever. This slides a piece of transparent material over the
response window and advances the program. The next
frame will contain the correct answer plus a brief com-
ment. Only the lever will advance the program to bring
the correct answer into view.
To advance the machine to the next information item,
push the "right" or "wrong" button depending whether
or not your response was right or wrong. The machine
will register the number of correct answers, advance the
program, retract the transparent piece from the response
window, and advance the paper reel upon which you have
registered your answer.
At the end of the lesson turn the machine off. Once
the machine is off you can open the side panel and remove
your answer list complete with the number of right and
wrong answers indicated on the paper.

THE LASER AND
OPTICAL HARMONICS
Using the LASER, a device for the amplification
of light, U of M physicists have succeeded in
producing various harmonics of light waves.
by ALAN HILL
The generation of harmonics, recti-
fication, hetrodyning, and modulation
are topics well known to electrical
engineers. Such phenomena occurring
at radio and microwave frequencies
have a wide variety of applications,
particularly in the general field of com-
munications. If the forementioned phe-
nomena could be made to occur at fre-
quencies in the visible regions of the
electromagnetic spectrum (i.e., if we
could rectify light, generate optical
harmonics, etc.) the field of communi-
cations could be possibly revolution-
ized. This is evident when one consid-
ers that the bandwidth of one Ang-
strom in the visible region is about
100,000 megacycles.
Before we can produce optical har-
monics, etc., we must first provide an
intense, extremely monochromatic, and
perfectly phase coherent source of light.
Since all conventional light sources are
essentially "noise radiators" by radio
standards, investigations of the "optical
electronics" type have previously been
ruled out of the question. Within the
past fifteen months, however, the ad-
vent of the optical masers1 has changed
this situation entirely.
The optical maser is an incredible
device. The ruby optical maser (of the
type used in the experimental work to
be described) is a pulsed device capable
of delivering a y2 millisecond, 10 joule
pulse of extremely monochromatic
6943A deep red light. This is a tre-
mendous concentration of energy when
one considers that its bandwidth is less
than 100 megacycles. In fact, one such
pulse, when focused to an area of 10-4
square centimeters, can melt an 10 mil
hole through two single edged razor

Drilling with light: a single Vi milli-
second puise of red light (focused)
melts a hole through two single edged
razor blades. Recent "one shot holes"
have been up to Vi inch in diameter.
blades! This corresponds to an energy-
concentration of about 1000 million
watts per square centimeter and an
electric vector about 10r' volts per centi-
meter! Another type of optical maser
(the Javan He-Ne gas maser) is capa-
ble of continuous output of lower
energy but extremely monochromatic
light. Its wavelength output is in the
infrared and its bandwidth (at best)
is only several cycles. This more than
rivals the world's finest radio frequency
oscillators as a pure frequency source.
The possibility of exploiting sources
such as these for the production of
optical harmonics from suitable non-
linear materials is now feasible and
most appealing. Such investigations
were begun at the University of Mich-
igan this past summer by Professors
P. A. Franken, C. W. Peters, G. Wein-
reich, and myself, an undergraduate.2
So far the outcome of these investi-
gations has been very encouraging.
Among these results, we have observed
the second harmonic* (at " 3472A)
produced upon projection of an intense
beam of 6943A light through non-
linear materials. Also, we have seen the
effect of rectifying light (production of

beam). The nature of these experi-
ments will be described further, but
first the basic principles of the optical
maser itself should be explained.
Atomic Oscillators
The shortest wavelengths so far ob-
tainable by means of electronic oscil-
lators are about one millimeter or 10
million Angstrom units. The major dif-
ficulty is, of course, fabricating small
enough components, namely resonant
cavities. In order to produce light by
these means, cavities would have to be
even smaller by three orders of magni-
tude. The logical approach would then
seem to be harnessing nature's own tiny
resonators, namely atoms and mole-
cules. There are many such resonators
throughout the entire infrared, visible,
and ultraviolet spectrum. The ordinary
gas discharge tube is an atomic oscil-
lator in this sense, however, even its
spectrum lines are relatively broad by
our standards. Also, the discharge tube
has no phase coherence. In such a de-
vice, each atom yields its energy spon-
taneously in the form of light quanta
upon transition of its outer electron
from a higher to a lower energy state.
We must remember two things about
such transitions. First, there are only
certain prescribed energy levels these
outer electron orbits can assume, and
second, the frequency of light quanta
emitted or absorbed is fixed by the
difference in energy levels between
transitions. In the case of the discharge
tube, atoms are "pumped" to higher
energy levels by electron collisions, and
fall back to their ground state (or some
intermediate state) with the spontane-
ous emission of light quanta. There is
no telling, however, precisely how long
an excited atom will live. Thus the
spectrum emitted from the gas dis-
charge tube is really the summation of
millions of individual tiny pockets of
light quanta, which are being emitted
completely at random. There is both
constructive and destructive interfer-
ence going on in all directions so that
a powerful phase coherent beam never
builds up. If these atoms could be
stimulated to release their light quanta
at the right time and in phase with
each other prior to spontaneous emis-
sion, a powerful, coherent, monochro-

optical harmonics, one of which is slightly shifted in frequency. The two har-
monics were then hetrodyned to obtain a third signal.
nut tic beam could be built. This is
essentially what is accomplished in the
Javon He-Ne gas optical maser.
Ruby Laser
A more detailed understanding of
the maser4 principle can most easily be
achieved through a description of the
pulsed ruby optical maser. Fluorescence
of solids is analogous, in many respects,
to gaseous discharge. If we subject a
ruby crystal to ultraviolet radiation, it
fluoresces deep red (6943A). Ruby
is essentially aluminum oxide in which
a few aluminum atoms are replaced by
chromium atoms. In the case of fluores-
cence, the ultraviolet light is absorbed,
raising the chromium atoms to an ex-
cited state. They give up some of this
energy to the crystal lattice and fall
to a lower state. It is their transition
from this lower state to the ground
state that results in the emission of red
light. Like the gaseous case, this emis-
sion occurs in purely a random fashion,
and there is no phase coherence nor
net constructive interference. Here
again, if the atoms could be stimulated
to emit their light quanta in phase with

Michigan "Mohole"
University of Michigan and Minne-
sota geologists hope to continue this
summer's "highly successful" drilling
work on Lake Superior which suggests
that the Great Lakes may have been
created chiefly by the flow of ancient
rivers rather than glacial action.
The Michigan-Minnesota Geological
Cruise during July drilled cores deep
into Superior sediments and bedrock
in a half-dozen locations—the first such
attempt to probe into the geological
history of the Great Lakes.
The senior scientist of the expedition
says preliminary examination of the re-
trieved cores indicates that glacial de-
posits were laid down in deep bedrock
valleys that must have existed long be-
fore the last ice sheets receded about
10,000 years ago.
He theorized that the underwater
valleys pre-date the ice ages and were
carved in part by the action of a
mighty river system that either emptied
into Hudson Bay or moved through
the St. Lawrence River Valley. Subse-
quent ice sheets, which plowed the ter-
rain like giant bulldozers, may then
have pushed deposits into the valleys
and created natural dams which ob-
structed drainage and created the five
Great Lakes.
Hopes are to continue the investiga-
tion next year along the eastern Lake
Superior basin. Great scientific value
lies in similar investigations of Lake
Michigan and Lake Huron.
The expedition was based aboard
Submarex, 173-foot former Navy patrol
vessel which has been fitted with an
over-the-side drilling rig similar to
those used in off-shore oil prospecting.
The hollow drill bit accommodates
clear plastic tubing to encase sediment
cores and allow them to be retrieved
for study. Bedrock cores also were
obtained.
In water depths ranging from 500 to
nearly 1,000 feet, the drillers pene-
trated lake bottom a total of 1352 feet
and recovered 523 feet of core which
will be studied at the two Big Ten
universities. Most spectacular location
was Site Five near Split Rock Light-
house, about five miles off the Minne-
sota coast, where Submarex anchored
in 938 feet of water and penetrated
684 feet into the bottom.
We still were not at bedrock at 684
feet when we ran out of drilling pipe.
Only the top 50 feet was lake sedi-
ment. The remainder was red glacial
deposits laid down by the ice. In the
bottom we found an older glacial de-
posit unlike any we had previously en-
countered. The significance of this is
that we found an extremely deep bed-
rock valley that must have existed
before the old glacial deposits were
laid down (perhaps up to a million
years ago). This lends support to the
concept that the major topographic fea-
tures of the Great Lakes region were
not formed by ice, but were eroded by
some ancient river system that existed
in inter-glacial or pre-glacial times.
The fact that they didn't strike bedrock
here makes it unknown how deep the
bedrock is, but lends support to the
hypothesis that the north (Minnesota)
shore is in effect a fault scarp where
the rocks of the crust have shifted and
dislocated the bedrock.
Laboratory tests on deposited pollen
grains between the apparent two layers
of glacial deposit may indicate plant
growth and climate conditions to help
date the deposits. At Site Two the

done in the Great Lakes.
New Sonar System
The Institute of Science and Tech-
nology at The University of Michigan
is experimenting with special data-
processing techniques for use in a new
sonar system for detecting and tracking
submarines at very long ranges in large
ocean areas. The sonar system is being
developed by the Office of Naval Re-
search's Project ARTEMIS, named af-
ter the Greek goddess of the hunt.
Sonar finds the range and location of
submarines by bouncing sound waves
off them and measuring how long it
takes for the sound waves to make the
return trip from the submarine. In
principle, therefore, it is similar to
radar. IST's Radar Laboratory is in-
vestigating sonar applications of the
unique data-processing principles it de-
veloped and used successfully in the
airborne high-resolution radar system
it delivered to the Army a year ago.
In an effort to make sonar reach to
greater ranges, Project ARTEMIS has
modified a former Navy tanker, the
USNA Mission Capistrano, to carry a
very high-powered sound source. This
sound transmitter, or transducer, is five
stories high and weighs hundreds of
tons. The Mission Capistrano is
equipped to raise and lower the sound
sources into the water and provide
power for its operation. The electrical
power required would light a town of
50,000 persons.
Machine Museum
A retired University of Michigan en-
gineering professor has delivered to the
Smithsonian Institution, Washington,
D. C, some of his pioneering work in
metal cutting studies. Prof. Emeritus
O. W. Boston's collection of machine
tools, instruments, and papers will be
permanently displayed in a new branch
of the United States national museum.
The Hall of Tools of the Institu-
tion's new Museum of History and
Technology, begun in July, will feature
an exhibit called "What Happens
When Metal Is Cut." The title was
first used as the title of a paper Pro-
fessor Boston presented before the
American Society of Mechanical Engi-
neers in 1930.
Professor Boston did pioneering
work on investigations of metal cut-
ting processes at the University in the
1920's. The Smithsonian asked him to
contribute original copies of his earlier
papers (he published over 300 during
his 42 years on the U-M faculty), pic-
tures, and the original instruments he
developed to investigate metal cutting
and forming phenomena.
Commonplace in mechanical engi-
neering laboratories now, these in-
struments were built by the former
chairman of the production engineer-
ing department and his staff three and
four decades ago because none existed
to make the measurements he deemed
necessary to understand the metal cut-
ting process.
They include mechanical and hydrau-
lic dynamometers, rising dial gauges
and mercury columns for measurement.
(These were replaced in the 1940's by
more sensitive and accurate measure-
ments using small wire strain gauges.)
Also included were thermocouple tools
to measure cutting temperatures and
work done; these were also used with
photographic equipment to record in-
stantaneous and continuous cutting
action.
With these instruments, he measured
such things as forces, power and sur-
face finish involved in metal process-

how chips are formed and how tools
and work pieces are affected by the
processing.
The collection sent to the Smith-
sonian included a two-tool thermocou-
ple in a steel body, and a simple
synamometer (an instrument for meas-
uring power) with a dial gauge for
measuring cutting force in the direc-
tion of the cut. Also included was a
strain gauge dynamometer for measur-
ing torque and thrust of rotating tools,
(such as those in the drill press), and
a similar one for measuring torque and
thrust of non-rotating tools (in which
the work rotates instead, as in turret
lathes or screw machines). In addition,
a lathe dynamometer for measuring the
three components of the cutting force,
a drilling heat-balance tool on three
dial gauges, and a small mechanically
operated drill dynamometer for meas-
uring torque and thrust of rotating
tools were sent with a number of early
original manuscripts and photographs
of devices and equipment used.
Engineer's Friend
Weeks of tedious slide rule work for
a University of Michigan engineering
student can now be done in just a few
hours.
How? By putting his problem into
computer language, a technique called
programming, which is then run
through a high speed electronic com-
puter that beeps out the answer in
about 20 seconds. Typical of engineer-
ing students in particular, this sophis-
ticated turn to the modern computer is
common to hundreds of students in
other U-M colleges. Today 97 different
U-M courses can use the services of a
complex, high speed computer to com-
plete their homework. These courses
range from business administration and
psychology to public health and engi-
neering.
As sophomores, U-M engineers solve
one or two problems per semester on
the computer, working up to four or
more as seniors. The training is highly
important, a professor emphasizes, be-
cause "the computer will soon be more
indispensable to his work than the slide
rule." Recent studies have shown that
engineering students can be taught
more extensive and complex material
when they can use a computer.
Although the figures are hard to
come by, U-M officials believe the Uni-
versity enjoys the most extensive edu-
cational use of computers in the coun-
try. The University has had the greatest
success in using the computer as an
educational tool. This is due to the
fact that we have designed a very ef-
ficient operating system which permits
us to run small problems with great
efficiency.
It's not unusual for the Computing
Center to process 5,000 different prob-
lems in a month. These include not
only student problems but also data
processing tasks and research calcula-

tions for many projects in the U-M's
30 million dollar per year research pro-
gram. To handle this volume, the Uni-
versity has had in its Computing
Center one of the highest capacity and
fastest computers on any college cam-
pus—International Business Machines
704. This could zip out 40,000 addi-
tions of 10-decimal numbers per second
or 5,000 multiplications or divisions.
Now the University has installed an
even faster computer, an IBM 709. The
709 can compute one problem while
others are being fed into or printed out
of the machine, which the 704 could
not do, and it has a larger storage
capacity. Whereas the 704 could take
about 8,000 ten-digit numbers in its
main storage, the 709 can remember
32,000. The 709 would turn out a prob-
lem in about 20 seconds instead of 45,
the average for students' problems on
the 704.
But even the IBM 709, considerably
faster than the 704, won't suffice to
handle the increasing load of data
processing which U-M students and re-
searchers are piling on their Com-
puting Center. So next spring, the
University is scheduled to get the
largest computer IBM makes available
to educational institutions, an IBM
7090 under the IBM Corporation's reg-
ular educational program. The 7090
can compute about five times faster
than the 709.
The demand on computers at the
University has grown steadily since
U-M engineers designed and built the
M1DAC (Michigan Digital Automatic
Computer) in 1951-52, the first high
speed computer on campus. The
MID AC was complemented and later
replaced by an IBM 650 about six years
ago, the 704 following in 1959.
One reason so many Michigan stu-
dents are able to use the computer is
the development by U-M mathemati-
cians of a new programming language.
Such languages are necessary to express
problems in a form the computer can
handle.
Called MAD (for Michigan Algo-
rithm Decoder), the language is rela-
tively easy to learn; it resembles closely
the mathematical symbols and English
words used to work out computations
by pencil and paper. Its use is spread-
ing to other schools and to industry.
Another reason for this success is a
series of four evening lectures held
each semester to brief interested stu-
dents on how to use the MAD lan-
guage. Students get no credit for
attending, yet 400 to 500—including
faculty members—jam lecture halls to
hear them, in spite of the inconven-
ience of the lecture hour.
These lectures were set up as part
of a $900,000 three-year program initi-
ated in 1959 under a Ford Foundation
grant which also stimulated much of
the broadening of the U-M's extensive
use of computers for regular classwork,
especially in engineering. The grant
was made to the College of Engineer-
ing to study how best to introduce un-
dergraduate engineering students to the
effective use of computers in their
studies.

Bright futures in data transmission at W. E.
New engineers with initiative who can meet Western Elec-
tric's high standards are offered many exciting career oppor-
tunities with our company in data processing development
work as it relates to communications.
For example, Western's engineers — working closely with
Bell Telephone Laboratories—have solved development and
manufacturing problems connected with the Bell System's
new DATA-PHONE Data set (made by Western Electric).
DATA-PHONE service lets business machines, such as com-
puters, "speak" to each other in a language of numbers and
symbols over existing telephone communication networks.
This represents a tremendous boon to business; and conse-
quently, it is estimated that some day there may be more
machine talk than people talk using telephone lines.
Of course, data communications is only one of many re-
warding career areas that await you at Western Electric.
Here are just a few of the others: electronic switching. . .
solid state electronic devices . . . microwave radio relay
...computer-programmed production lines... solar cells...
optical masers . . . futuristic telephones.
We need high-caliber, forward-thinking engineers now to
help us transform these plans into realities or to work with
us in scores of other key communications areas. Your future,
the future of Western Electric, and the future of America's
communications — could well depend on your first career
connection.
Challenging opportunities exist now at Western Electric for electrical,
mechanical, industrial, and chemical engineers, as well as physical
science, liberal arts, and business majors. All qualified applicants will
receive careful consideration for employment without regard to race,
creed, color or national origin. For more information about Western
Electric, write College Relations, Western Electric Company, Room 6105,

REPORT FROM 128-H
Latest statistics from engineering placement reveal
several interesting employment trends.
edited by MICHAEL GORDON
It is again a privilege for the Technic
to publish the Annual Report of the
Engineering Placement Service issued
by the Office of Engineering Place-
ment, Professor J. G. Young, Director,
Room 128-H West Engineering Build-
ing.
During the school year 1960-'6l, as
in previous years, the market for engi-
neering graduates was strong. This
period witnessed an increase in the
number of employers seeking engineer-
ing graduates, along with an increase
in the starting salaries offered to grad-
uates. However, the increase in starting
salaries was no greater than previous
years and was considered a "normal"
increase.
This period also witnessed a decline
in the intensity of recruiting activity.
Two major facts gave rise to this
conclusion. One, there was an increase
in the number of visit cancellations
accompanied by a decrease in the num-
ber and lateness of offers in the Spring
term as compared to the Fall term and,
two, starting salaries failed to rise be-
tween the Fall and Spring terms as
they have done in previous years. The
decrease in recruiting intensity is be-
lieved to be caused by cuts made in
the budgets for recruiting by the vari-
ous firms seeking graduates and not by
a decrease in the demand for technical
graduates.
A number of the largest employers
have reported reducing the number of
schools visited from 25% to 50% as
compared to previous years. These
same employers have also been concen-
trating more heavily on schools that
have been the most productive. Evi-
dence of a greater effort to recruit
graduates from Michigan can be seen
by the increase in "pre-interview" visits,
(visits made by an employer to contact
candidates before the regular interview
visit), and also from an increase in the
number of "follow-up visits" (visits
made to continue contact with those to
whom offers have been made and to
contact additional candidates).
Also during this period, three note-
worthy trends have developed. First,
there has been a decrease in the num-
ber of graduates starting their employ-
ment in the Midwest. The East and
West Coasts have counterbalanced this
decrease with the West Coast more
popular. Second, there has been an in-
crease in the demand for Chemical
Engineers while the supply of Chemical
Engineers has fallen. Chemical com-
panies made one-third of the total com-
pleted visits. Third, the proportion of
graduates starting with large organiza-
tions increased over last year, but is
still substantially less than the previous
two years.
The following tables have been tak-
en from the official Report of Engi-
neering Placement and are intended to
show some of the more significant
trends and important facts.

total number of graduates increased by
only 3%. The only major program to
show an increasing trend over the past
several years is Electrical, and the only
one to show a decline is Chemical.
The proportion of graduates accept-
ing regular employment declined to
52% from the 62% and 61% of the
past two years, and the proportion re-
turning to school increased to 34%
from 26% and 23%. The proportion
going to military service has shown no
change during the past four years.

The number of employers schedul-

crease and was only 4% less than the
high of 1957-58. The number of inter-
view visits scheduled reached an all-
time high, but the number of cancella-
tions was also high so that the number
of completed visits was nearly the same
as last year. The proportion of cancel-
lations was about 17% in the Fall and
22% in the Spring.
One-third of the completed inter-
view visits were made by the Chemical
industries, whereas the Electrical, Air-
craft and Missile, and Mechanical in-
dustries accounted for about 14% each.
The number of employers requesting
graduates by mail declined 31% for
new graduates and 16% for experienc-
ed alumni. On the other hand, the
number of alumni using the Placement
Service increased.

Starting salaries increased about 3%
this year which is about the same as
for the past several years; however, the
increase this year came in the Fall,
rather than the Spring, and the aver-
age of Spring offers actually reduced
the overall average of the year.
Of the major programs, those having
10 graduates or more on the B.S. level,
Aeronautical graduates reported the
highest average salary. They had been
slightly behind Electricals during the
past two years.

each other and before spontaneous
emission, a powerful, coherent beam
could be built.
This is accomplished in the case of
the pulsed ruby optical maser as fol-
lows: First, the majority of chromium
atoms are pumped up to one of two
excited states by the absorption of
green and ultraviolet light. (See figure
1.) This green and ultraviolet light is
supplied to the ruby by means of dis-
charging a condensor bank through a
xenon flash lamp. Second, atoms in the
two excited states give up some energy
to the crystal lattice and fall to a com-
mon intermediate state, called a meta-
stable state, as in the case of fluores-
cence. Now, if the atom in this meta-
stable state is struck by a photon
having the same energy as would other-
wise be emitted spontaneously, emis-
sion is stimulated prematurely. Most
important, the photon emitted is ex-
actly in phase with that photon which
stimulated emission, and thus, a co-

herent beam begins to build. This is
the maser principle. Clearly for this
condition to exist, we must keep the
media continuously "pumped up," so
a red photon is more likely to strike
an atom in the metastable state than
in the ground state. If the latter hap-
pens, absorption occurs and the photon
is lost from the coherent beam. A tre-
mendously powerful pumping source
therefore becomes the key to net stim-
ulated emission instead of random
spontaneous emission.
At first, stimulated emission occurs
in all directions in the ruby. If the ruby
rod is equipped with silvered ends,
then those coherent rays which are
nearly parallel to the axis of the rod
will be reflected back and forth, gain-
ing more energy with each pass. All
other photon cascades (those not near-
ly parallel to the axis) will be lost
through the walls before the snowball
begins to roll. (See figure 2.) If one
end is only partially silvered, an es-
cape hatch is provided, and the beam
eventually emerges through that end.
As would be expected, this beam is

This machine, developed by Rheem Califone, is the es-
sence of simplicity. The machine is purely mechanical and
lacks all electronic gadgetry.
Because you are an adult, you may keep your answer
list. In a formal educational institution, the instructor
keeps the list and uses it as a guide in evaluating student
progress.
There are variations to this procedure such as inter-
mediate clues between an item and a response, "branch-
ing," where an incorrect answer brings a remedial frame,
and variations in mechanical procedure. Consult the man-
ual for the machine you are using for further instructions.
PART II A LESSON IN EDUCATION
In the late 1950's and earl . ..
Hey!! Why'd you close the book? You
haven't finished yet. The next section will give
you a background in the psychology of teach-
ing machines.
Oh, you are impatient. You want to try the
machine. Well, don't just sit there, turn it on.
Man, dig that crazy lighting. That's it—locate
the slots, buttons, levers, etc.
All set for business. Select the lesson num-
ber. Here's the first frame. Interesting. Tells
you about Chinese characters. Now push the
advance button and record your answer to the
response in the small window. Pull the re-
sponse lever. Good boy—a correct answer.
Now for the next frame.
STOP! Why are you trying to take the
machine apart? You say there is something
wrong—this item looks almost exactly like the
last one?
Calm down. It's supposed to be that way,
that's the theory of learning. You become con-
ditioned to the response. Too bad you were in
such a hurry—you should have read that sec-
tion on theory.
But for now, get that puzzled look off your
face and answer the next question. Keep at this
for 30 minutes and you will have completed
your first lesson and in six more weeks you
will complete the equivalent of a university
semester.
Fun, isn't it? Like playing a pin ball
machine.
That 30 minutes went fast. Don't forget
that theory, it may come in handy.
PART II A LESSON IN EDUCATION
In the late 1950's and early 1960's American educators
were faced with serious problems. The school population
from kindergarten to the universities was growing faster
than the colleges could provide teachers. Instructors be-
came bogged down with various menial tasks: keeping
attendance records, grading papers, and teaching rote
processes.
At the same time, a new educational philosophy
emerged. Educators began to realize the importance of
different intellectual capacities possessed by individual stu-
dents and the need for educating each of these students
according to individual abilities. Time was being wasted,
for many of the students could accomplish a semester's
work in far less time if they were allowed to study at
their own pace. Educators began to see the importance of
creativity, imagination, and original thinking as a part of
the education process. Something had to be done to free
teachers from teaching mechanical procedures and permit
them to devote their time to discussing and developing
the student's individual latent talents.
A solution to the myriad of problems lay in mechanical
teachers. Of course the design of a machine such as the
one you are using was a simple matter. The only task of
the machine is to present the matter to be taught and to
register the number of errors. The key to fully automated
teaching was the development of the programs.
The machine does no teaching. This job lies ultimately
with the programmer. Each subject had to be very closely
scrutinized: torn apart, atomized into the tiniest bits. The
tiny bits of information then had to be re-assembled into
a program. Great care had to be taken to set each step
into a logical sequence. There could be no nebulous state-
ments because no teacher would be on hand to resolve
the student's problem. Each response had to be devised
so that the student would not feel he were being tested.
Each response had to insure maximum participation by
the student.

am I teaching and to whom? The knowledge that a pro-
grammer wanted a student to possess at the end of the
course had to be carefully defined. Prior student knowl-
edge had to be analyzed so that the programmer would
know the foundation upon which he was building. Pro-
grams had to be tested on students, revised, and tested
again. Patience and ingenuity soon produced programs in
nearly every conceivable subject: languages, neurology,
pharmacology, psychophysics, psychiatry, spelling, reading,
arithmetic, history, algebra, music theory, physics, chem-
istry, engineering courses, etc. were all broken down and
put into program form.
The necessity of such great care lay in the psychology
of the method. Based on the work of B. Frederic Skinner,
a Harvard psychologist during the 50's and 60's, the psy-
chology is founded on the principles of conditioning and
behaviorism.
The ultimate application of Skinner's methods to learn-
ing were the result of many years of work investigating
the elements of behavior. It had been observed that in a
great many cases the behavior of humans and animals could
be explained as a series of instinctive responses to environ-
mental stimuli. Using pigeons and other animals, Skinner
observed that complex behavior patterns could be "taught"
to the animals, if the patterns were broken into a series
of small steps. By a process of trial and error animals were
taught, one step at a time, such tricks as playing with a
toy, pecking the right card from a group of cards, and
pecking out tunes on a toy piano.
Each small step was impressed on the animal by re-
inforcing a correct move or response with a reward. The
association between correct move and reward soon con-
ditioned the animal to each step. Once he acquired each
step, it was relatively easy for the experimenter to get the
animal to perform the complete pattern.
The same tactics were applied to human learning.
Every student during the pre-machine era found it was
much easier to study a subject each day than try to cram
it all in before an exam. The subjects were therefore
broken into tiny steps and the program set up to condition
the student at each step. This is the reason for the simi-
larity in succeeding steps in a typical program. Each step
is only slightly different from the previous one, but it is
easier to recall later the small step and information con-
tained in it.
Another reason for the great care in programming lay
with Skinner's idea of wrong information. It was his feel-
ing that a wrong impression is more readily remembered
than a correct one. Therefore, the Skinner method takes
great pains to insure correct answers from students.
The Skinner experiments also revealed that maximum
activity by the student during the learning process leads
to more permanent knowledge. Thus we find another rea-
son for the small steps. With a greater number of steps,
the student is required to make a corresponding greater
number of responses which provides greater active par-
ticipation by the student.
The Crowder Technique
At the time Skinner was developing his methods, an-
other slightly different psychology was suggested by
Norman A. Crowder, a one-time Air Force psychologist
who at the time of his work was employed by U. S. Indus-
tries' Western Design Division, one of the first companies
to manufacture teaching programs and machines.
The Crowder approach does not rely on the theories
of behaviorism, instead it follows more closely the con-
ventional teaching methods of the pre-machine era. The
Crowder technique does not break the subject matter into
such tiny bits and does not teach through the process of
conditioning by steps. Instead a typical Crowder program
presents a large meaty paragraph with each frame. Where
the Skinner method tries to provide programs that will
eliminate error, the Crowder style tries to anticipate them
and utilizes errors as an integral part of the program.
The step in some programs of "branching" is a result
of Crowder's work. If the student comes to a part of the
program that gives him difficulty as indicated by the stu-
dent's wrong answers, the machine automatically diverts
to a supplementary sequence that will act as a refresher.
Psychological kickers are interspersed throughout a Crow-
der program to stimulate the student. A refresher frame
may include a chiding comment "Come, come, now, you
know better." A correct answer may be accompanied by
an encouraging comment.
The Skinner method seems to hold a bit more promise
than Crowder's. Experimentally the Skinner psychology
proves to be more valid but Crowder's programs have

worked with a high degree of success. It is difficult to
conclusively say which method is superior.
Looking Back
It is interesting to note some of the early uses of
teaching machines and to note that today the early ex-
perimental applications are very commonplace.
Here are excerpts from an Eastman Kodak news re-
lease of 1961. "Teaching machines have become an im-
portant new tool in industrial training at Eastman Kodak
Company. Both standard audio-visual equipment and work-
books have been studied as a means of presenting pro-
grammed material . . . The first machine was used
experimentally for industrial training at Kodak with great
success. Features of the machine include flexibility of pro-
gramming, provision for illustrations, simple operation and
'cheat-proof guards."
Of course since the motive for cheating, grades, has
been eliminated, the cheat-proof device would find little
use in today's educational circles.
Other companies that pioneered in the use of machines
for employee training were I.B.M., Bell Telephone Labs,
Polaroid, and Hughes.
One of the pioneers in machine language instruction
was the University of Michigan. A news release of August,
1961 says: "The machine attempts to engineer the student's
behavior in such a way that he will learn a foreign lan-
guage rapidly and effectively . . . A series of subjects that
have undergone the U-M program show rapid mastery of
second language fluency. Taught completely by machine,
three U-M students learned to speak Spanish 'like natives'
in less than 200 hours."
Like all innovations there was resistance to the insti-
tution of teaching machines. A prize comment made about
1959 by a University of Alabama psychologist; "// you
don't have a gadget called a teaching machine don't get
one. Don't buy one; don't borrow one; don't steal one.
If you have such a gadget get rid of it . . . The so-called
teaching machine is a disease."
Many educators of the times felt that machines would
eliminate the personal contact between teacher and stu-
dent. They feared that students would become maladjusted
and the use of programmed teaching would place students
in molds that would destroy diversity. Of course there was
the question of quality of learning; how well students
would develop original concepts and how well he could
express himself brought up under the tutorship of a
machine. In time the questions were answered. The wide-
spread use of machines after about 1975 refutes the
doubters. Especially when we observe the tremendous in-
crease in the quality of scientists, writers, artists, business-
men, etc.
A typical example of the success of early tests was a
group of students tested in I960 after they had been
taught by machine some six months before. Nearly 90
percent of the class scored 85 percent of the grade they
achieved on their first exam administered at the end of
the course.
The widespread use of automated classrooms was in-
evitable. The flood of students and the receding number
of teachers that existed during the 50's and 60's dictated
the use of machines. Machines soon taught English gram-
mar, teachers taught writing. Machines taught the mechan-
ics of mathematics and physics, teachers taught appreciation
for the laws of science. Machines provided facts, teachers
provided discussion.
Machines did not replace teachers. But they did replace
drill masters. A good teacher is indispensable; a good
teacher was never a drill master. Any teacher who can be
replaced by a machine deserves to be replaced.
Interesting field this education, isn't it? Just
think you couldn't complain about your instruc-
tor chopping your grade because he disliked
you. With your engineering mind you ought
to have liked automated teaching when you
were in school. It would have eliminated a lot
of the guess work of teaching. You would
have appreciated being taught in a very me-
chanical fashion. Just think of all the dull
discussions and useless appeals to your imag-
ination it would have eliminated . . .
What's wrong? Still not convinced that
teaching machines are the greatest thing since
the invention of the wheel? You oldsters—
always resisting progress.

Left, this student is determining the crystal structure of a material with X-ray diffraction equipment prior to making a
prediction of the material's properties. Right, the photomicrograph reveals the influence of crystal structure upon the
plastic deformation of manganese sulfide which is a minor but an important constitutent of steel. The pattern reveals
the crystal planes on which dislocations moved during deformation. Such information is valuable because it provides
a new explanation of machinability for many steels.
Materials Engineering
Materials Engineering is a new area of technical study. It is true that engineers have always been
concerned with the use of materials. However, the present demands of advanced engineering designs require
new and detailed attention to the production, properties and specifications of Engineering Materials. The
numbers of specialists who are required in this area by industrial and government engineering and research
groups exceed the numbers of trained people. Therefore several of the leading engineering schools are fol-
lowing the University of Michigan's pattern for establishing curricula covering the broad area of Materials
Engineering.
The materials of engineering include metals, plastics, and ceramics (inorganic compounds). The nature
of each of these receives attention in a Materials curriculum after initial courses in introductory chemistry and
physics. Finally, material selection must be considered for the exacting electrical, mechanical, thermal and
radiation requirements during service.

ent.5 Since all photons produced by
stimulated emission are in phase, they
add up constructively to produce an
output of tremendous power.
The Javon gas He-Ne optical maser
works very nearly the same except its
activated media is a critical mixture of
He-Ne gas instead of ruby. Here again
mirrors are used at each end of the
media to build up a parallel beam. An
r.f. field is used to excite the He and
Ne atoms by means of electron bom-
bardment, instead of pumping with in-
coming light of another wavelength.
As mentioned before, this is a continu-
ous running device of low power as
opposed to the ruby "laser," which is
"pulsed" at high power. (See figure 3.)
The previously mentioned investiga-
tions concerning optical harmonics and
other "optical electronics" phenomena
were dependent upon the ruby optical
maser as a source. With the basic maser
principles explained, a further discus-

sion of this experimental work is now
possible.
Optical Harmonics
In general, harmonics result when we
force oscillations into a material which
has a non-linear response. The harder
we force these oscillations, the more
non-linear the response becomes. For
example, if we bow a violin hard, or
strike a piano key hard, more harmon-
ics are produced than if we take the
gentle approach. The quality of the
sound changes as well as the ampli-
tude. An electronic case would be the
driving of an oscillating circuit hard,
as opposed to driving it soft. The
harder we drive the circuit, the more
non-linear effects (in tubes, induct-
ances, etc.) increase, and thus greater
harmonic generation results. As a rule
of thumb, anything becomes non-linear
when driven above a certain intensity.
In the case of optical harmonics, the
driving force is a focused optical maser
beam which produces a sinusoidal elec-
tric vector of about 105 volts/cm, and
its acting on atoms in a non-linear crys-
taline structure. Quartz is the most
common example of such crystaline
structures. The atoms in these struc-
tures, cannot vibrate in direct propor-
tion to this excitation because of its
overwhelming intensity. The distor-
tions in its vibrations can be broken
down into 2nd, 3rd, . . . n harmonics
(by Fourier expansion), and these har-
monics are re-radiated from the vibrat-
ing atoms in the form of light, or
optical harmonics. This may be ex-
pressed in terms of the polarization P
(which determines the re-radiated elec-
tric vector, including harmonics), the
electric susceptibility x (determined by
dielectric properties of the material),
and E, the applied electric vector, as
P = x E for linear response, or,

for non-linear response, which pro-
duces harmonics. The alf a2, . . . an
terms are merely coefficient (of the
order of atomic electric fields » 108
electrostatic units) which limit the mag-
nitude of the harmonics. The second
harmonic was found experimentally to
be down in magnitude from the funda-
mental by a factor of " 108 for quartz,
10" for triglycine sulfate. Conceivably,
this factor could be reduced to perhaps
102 or better by finding better materials
and using more powerful optical mas-
ers as sources when they are developed.
Note that the second harmonic is a sec-
ond order effect and increases as the
square of the red light input.

more closely. Since E is a sinusoid, say

And the second harmonic is merely:
P A2 . „ xA2/ \
2„, = x — slnAot = _^i_cos2ootj
The cos (2&lt;,)t) is what we would expect
for a 1st harmonic, namely twice the
frequency of the fundamental. The
fundamental was 6942 A (deep red)
and the first harmonic was seen on
the spectograph at v 3472 A, deep
blue or ultraviolet. A closer look re-
veals that the term (1 — cos 2 "t)
has two further meanings, which are
far more significant to the field of com-
munications than the second harmonics
itself. Figure 4 shows a plot of the
fundamental and the term (1 — cos
2 «t). The 1st harmonic is oscillating
off the axis, between 1 and 0. Thus,
the 1 in the expression may be con-
sidered a positive D.C. voltage from
which we are subtracting the 1st har-
monic. Indeed, this is the rectification
of light, with tremendous possibilities
in optical communication. This signal
appears across the crystal during each

"firing" of the inaser, and can be meas-
ured by electrostatic means.6
Application in Communications
This phenomenon has implications
of great value toward the field of com-
munications. Suppose, for example, one
were assigned the task of demodulating
a light beam carrying microwave in-
formation. Ordinarily, this seems prac-
tically impossible. However, by con-
verting a small fraction of this light
to the second harmonic, the associated
voltage, which is proportional to the
energy of the modulated light, could
be collected in a microwave cavity.
This corresponds to demodulating a
microwave A. M. modulated light
beam. This possibility was suggested by
Professor Franken, and extensive re-
search along these lines is now being
conducted at Texas Instruments in co-
operation with our research team.
Also, the "D.C. effect" has implica-
tions concerning the materials best
suited for 1st harmonic generation. In
order to produce any even ordered ef-
fect (or odd ordered harmonic) we
must use a material in which the atoms
have a preferred direction. That is, the
atomic dipoles must be internally sup-
ported in such a way that they move
more easily in certain directions than
others. This effect causes the dipoles
to oscillate off center under the driving
force of the red light, thus producing
the D.C. effect as well as the second
harmonic. This effect suggests that the
generation of the second harmonic
should be dependent on the direction
of polarization of the optical maser
beam. Such dependence proved to be
the case.
Experimental Details
A few experimental details in con-
nection with the second harmonic ex-
periment should be mentioned. A
commercially available ' ruby optical
maser in the 5 to 10 joule range was
used. The 1 millisecond pulses were
filtered free of Xenon light, then fo-
cused into the crystal sample. The im-
age of this focused spot was then
analyzed by a quartz prism spectrom-
eter equipped with red insensitive East-
man type 103 spectrographs plates. A
reproduction of such a plate subjected
to only a 1 millisecond pulse is shown
in figure 5. The crystal was triglycine
sulfate, the best crystal found so far.
Other experiments now getting under
way include the hetrodyning of two
optical maser sources of different
frequencies.8
Although optical maser technology
is relatively new and yet considerably
undeveloped, many scientists have high
hopes for its possibilities. Its appli-
cations to fields from welding to
communications are under serious con-
sideration. Just how many such appli-
cations materialize is of course a

tially the frequence has been boosted up,
and resonant cavities no longer are
utilized.
5. For large power outputs the divergence
is about '/2 degree, or approximately as
parallel as sunlight. For lower power
ievels, light becomes much more parallel.
In the case of the He-Ne gas laser, di-

for the food industry and 1000% of air.
Both added ingredients are harmless as
applesauce itself.
One adds the monoglyceride, warms,
and whips. If the result is a bit too airy
for the common taste, one can either
use more strongly flavored applesauce,
freeze while mixing (as in making ice
cream), or both.
It doesn't have to be applesauce. We
have made the idea work just as well
with bananas, tomato juice, etc.
Mind you, expect no applesauce from
us. We offer no foods in family-sized
quantities. We work closely, however,
with companies that do.
THIS paper
"My husband sells oscillograph paper.
Competition is fierce. He comes home
beat every night."
Few overhearing her would know
what the poor soul is talking about, yet
she speaks the truth. Oscillographs
probably outnumber pickle barrels in
this country at present. Oscillographers
are correspondingly numerous. Methods
that one sect of oscillographers prefers
above all else another sect can't see for
dirt. One sect prefers automatic oscillo-
gram processors. Paper manufacturers
like us find their favor worth competing
for. Therefore we announce a new
advance in media for their use.
An advance in the old art of paper-
making came first. Then new emulsions
were devised to work properly with the
new base. Then proper processing
chemicals were devised for the new
emulsions. Then the combination was
extensively proved out under practical
conditions of use by parties interested
only in end-results and hardly at all in
the how and why.
They found that THIS paper dries
thoroughly at high processor speeds
without creases, doesn't crack or dis-
tort, isn't fussy about how long it sits
around before use, and gives trace lines
that stand out black as the ace of spades.
"THIS" won't do for a trademark.
We call it Kodak Ektalinc Paper. Kodak
Ektaline Chemicals come as liquids.
The stabilization principle used in the
automatic oscillogram processors came
from Kodak, too.
Smart hardware
Alarm prevails over the nation's bill for
research unwittingly repeated. We have
an answer. Even the hardware is all
built. It uses little chips of film 16mm
by 32mm, which are never touched by
human hands.
Each of the millions of chips carries
both a) language the machines can use
in classifying information to almost any
depth of detail and b) microreproduc-
tion of documents, photographs, manu-
scripts, drawings, or whatever for the
human user to examine with his natural-
born eyes as soon as the machine has
"remembered" it and restored it to size.
The machines search very fast. They
further save searching time because of
the incredible information-packing den-
sity and copying speed of photography.
It is practical for the machinery to
duplicate each complete chip for every
pertinent sub-classification. The sub-
classifications can therefore be made so
fine that each contains relatively few
chips for the machinery to zip through.
This is called the Minicard System.
It can occupy legions upon legions of
creative minds with very sharply rele-
vant information from the whole recorded
past while the stroke of genius is
patiently awaited.
Note i Whether you work for us or not,
photography in some form will prob-
ably have a part in your work as years
go on. Now or later, feel free to ask for
Kodak literature or help on anything
photographic.

Interview with General Electric's Dr. J. H. Hollomon
Manager—General Engineering Laboratory
One of a series
\

Q. Dr. Hollomon, what characterizes
the new needs and wants of society?
A. There are four significant changes
in recent times that characterize these
needs and wants.
1. The increases in the number of
people who live in cities: the accom-
panying need is for adequate control
of air pollution, elimination of trans-
portation bottlenecks, slum clearance,
and adequate water resources.
2. The shift in our economy from agri-
culture and manufacturing to "serv-
ices": today less than half our working
population produces the food and goods
for the remainder. Education, health,
and recreation are new needs. They
require a new information technology
to eliminate the drudgery of routine
mental tasks as our electrical tech-
nology eliminated routine physical
drudgery.
3. The continued need for national
defense and for arms reduction: the
majority of our technical resources
is concerned with research and devel-
opment for military purposes. But
increasingly, we must look to new tech-
nical means for detection and control.
4. The arising expectations of the peo-
ples of the newly developing nations:
here the "haves" of our society must
provide the industry and the tools for the
"have-nots" of the new countries if they
are to share the advantages of mod-
ern technology. It is now clearly recog-
nized by all that Western technology is
capable of furnishing the material
goods of modern life to the billions
of people of the world rather than
only to the millions in the West.
We see in these new wants, prospects
for General Electric's future growth
and contribution.
Q. Could you give us some examples?
A. We are investigating techniques for
the control and measurement of air and
water pollution which will be appli-
cable not only to cities, but to individual
households. We have developed, for
Society Has New Needs
and Wants—Plan Your
Career Accordingly
DR. HOLLOMON is responsible for General Electric's centralized, advanced engineering
activities. He is also an adjunct professor of metallurgy at RPI, serves in advisory posts
for four universities, and is a member of the Technical Assistance panel of President
Kennedy's Scientific Advisory Committee. Long interested in emphasizing new areas of oppor-
tunity for engineers and scientists, the following highlights some of Or. Hollomon's opinions.
example, new methods of purifying
salt water and specific techniques for
determining impurities in polluted air.
General Electric is increasing its inter-
national business by furnishing power
generating and transportation equip-
ment for Africa, South America, and
Southern Asia.
We are looking for other products
that would be helpful to these areas to
develop their economy and to improve
their way of life. We can develop new
information systems, new ways of stor-
ing and retrieving information, or
handling it in computers. We can
design new devices that do some of the
thinking functions of men, that will
make education more effective and per-
haps contribute substantially to reducing
the cost of medical treatment. We can
design new devices for more efficient
"paper handling" in the service
industries.
Q. If I want to be a part of this new
activity, how should I plan my career?
A. First of all, recognize that the
meeting of needs and wants of society
with products and services is most
important and satisfying work. Today
this activity requires not only knowl-
edge of science and technology but
also of economics, sociology and the
best of the past as learned from the
liberal arts. To do the engineering
involved requires, at least for young
men, the most varied experience possi-
ble. This means working at a number
of different jobs involving different
science and technology and different
products. This kind of experience for
engineers is one of the best means of
learning how to conceive and design
—how to be able to meet the changing
requirements of the times.
GENERAL
For scientists, look to those new fields
in biology, biophysics, information, and
power generation that afford the most
challenge in understanding the world
in which we live.
But above all else, the science explo-
sion of the last several decades means
that the tools you will use as an engi-
neer or as a scientist and the knowledge
involved will change during your life-
time. Thus, you must be in a position
to continue your education, either on
your own or in courses at universities
or in special courses sponsored by
the company for which you work.
Q. Does General Electric offer these
advantages to a young scientist or
engineer?
A. General Electric is a large diver-
sified company in which young men
have the opportunity of working on a
variety of problems with experienced
people at the forefront of science and
technology. There are a number of
laboratories where research and ad-
vanced development is and has been
traditional. The Company offers incen-
tives for graduate studies, as well as
a number of educational programs
with expert and experienced teachers.
Talk to your placement officers and
members of your faculty. I hope you
will plan to meet our representative
when he visits the campus.

Research Laboratory in line with established scientific
principles—not to study pinheads, but to enable the
scientists in Fundamental Research to study the atomic
structures and surfaces of metals. With this amazingly
powerful instrument, they can actually see and identify
individual atoms!
Whatever their specialized training, those who work at
U. S. Steel are likely to be surprised, at the start, by
such ultramodern, space age equipment. But they
soon come to realize that this is just the visible evi-

most stealthily treading tomcat could take lessons from the men at
Ford Motor Company whose job it is to track down and suppress
unwanted noise in vehicles.
At our Ford Research and Engineering Center in Dearborn, engineers
have created a unique room without echoes, virtually duplicating the
perfect stillness that exists miles above the earth's surface.
The "Silent Room", as we call it, is a chamber utilizing fiber-glass
wedges as sonic "blotters" to soak up noise emanating from subjects
undergoing developmental tests. In this acoustically sterile environ-
ment, electronic instruments seek out the source of vibrations,
rattles, rumbles and squeaks so that they can be eliminated in
production.
This scientific approach to silence is but a tiny facet of the many-
sided program of pure and applied research which goes on daily at
Ford Motor Company. It is another example of Ford's leadership
through scientific research and engineering.

"The decline and fall of gung-ho" is now an accomplished
fact at the University of Michigan. The years-long trend toward
depopularization of all sorts of extracurricular activities has
struck bedrock. Only the very hardiest of organizations survive
today with anything more than a skeleton crew of participants.
One of the better barometers of the level of enthusiasm for
"gung-ho" is the number of men pledged by fraternities. Recent-
ly the trend has been unremittingly downward, and diehard
fraternity boosters are showing signs of increasing panic. Many
privately admit to fears for the longevity of the system.
I predict that interest in activities of all sorts will decline
even further. Activities are not only sunk, they have touched the
ocean floor; but there is some settling and shifting to come.
Some shift of emphasis will accompany the decline; witness the
current proliferation of social-conscience and quasi-political
clubs. But even this boom will be short-lived. They will be
scuttled by the same tin fish that torpedoed their antipodes,
the fraternities: a New Outlook wrought from awareness, in-
dependence of mind, and cynicism.
The awareness comes from the urgency of world problems
today, the means for communication of news daily in the press
and hourly on the radio, and the increasing realism of the con-
cerns of young people in general. The independence of mind
is a reaction to the threat of conformity that has been given
so much verbiage recently. And the cynicism arises from dis-
illusionments such as Nehru's revelation that he, too, is no
saint.
After performing the wearying task of collecting data on
student organizations for the Student Directory, I am as aware
as anyone that there are still a great many activities hereabouts.
However, frequently now the officers carry out their routine
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


with ritualistic unconcern. Members-at-large, in clubs fortunate
enough to have them, turn over rapidly and attend irregularly.
The quality of membership has also declined. Capable persons
with real leadership qualities are not applying them to activities
so much as formerly, and the operation and control of the ac-
tivities has fallen into less capable, and less spirited, hands.
Is this trend something to mourn? I think not. Nor is it
something to applaud, either. It's merely a curious phenomenon
of these times, which I direct your attention to without asking
either first aid or euthanasia for the clubs.
A further note on the reasons for the decline of fraternities,
since that's probably the most interesting phase of the trend.
(As information, the writer is a fraternity alumnus, whose pres-
ent position is absolute neutrality.) The apartment boom has
been the biggest single enemy of the Greeks, and it promises
to become an even bigger competitor. Recent construction has
glutted, and will keep glutted, the rental-space market for a
good while to come, and landlords of existing units are making
all kinds of concessions to keep their buildings occupied. As
empty apartment space appears, rents fall. The reverse is true
in the fraternity system, empty beds cause house bills to go up.
Thus, the economic dice are loaded against the fraternities.
As any campus sophisticate worthy of his entertainment
bill will tell you, however, the main appeal of the apartment is
non-economic.
What cheer, then, for rushing chairmen and membership
secretaries? Well, the total enrollment of the University is still
creeping upward. Absolute bottom for the decline is in sight,
too, and it appears that a hard core of clubs will survive in-
tact. Finally, elections and graduation aren't too far off, are
they. Then you can get busy with the serious problems of your
life.

on how to plan your career
Are you "taking a job"
or "beginning a career"?
There's a mighty big difference
between the two
As we see it, "taking a job" can be
much like taking a single, tentative
step in the dark. It may serve your
purposes temporarily, but where do
you go from there?
Young men who snap up tempting
job offers often regret their decisions
as time goes by. The plain fact is that
glittering ind ucements sometimes cover
up the lack of a future. But the man
who thinks in terms of a career is not
easily fooled; he sees his first job as a
beginning, not as an end in itself.
Careers with Bethlehem Steel—A
doorway to careers with Bethlehem
Steel is the Loop Course—its members
make an observational circuit (or
"loop") of a steel plant during their
initial training program. Through the
Loop Course, Bethlehem seeks only
men who are interested in career
opportunities. We do not accept men
who are "just looking for a job";
and, by the same token, we do not
assign loopers to "dead-end" jobs.
Promotion from Within—\t is im-
portant to bear in mind the fact that,
aside from the need for an occasional
specialist, we fill management posi-
tions from within the organization.
The Loop Course, through its 40 years
of operation, has provided about 2,000
selected and trained men, capable of
advancing to positions of increased
responsibility.
Loopers are Thoroughly Trained—
New loopers report to our general
headquarters, in Bethlehem, Pa., usu-
ally early in July. They attend a basic
course of five weeks, including lec-
tures, classroom discussions, educa-
tional films, and daily plant visits.
The Loop Course is not a probationary
period. After completion of the course,
every looper receives his first assign-
ment. Then, after reporting to a plant,
yard, or home office division, he re-
ceives further orientation before be-
ginning on-the-job training. Bethlehem
loopers embark on their careers with
thorough training behind them.
Big and Diversified—Because of its
size and diversity of its operations,
Bethlehem Steel offers unlimited op-
portunities to "get ahead." One of the
nation's largest industrial corporations,
with over 140,000 employees, we are
engaged in raw materials mining and
processing; basic steelmaking and the
production of a wide range of steel

products; manufacturing; structural-
steel fabricating and erecting; and
shipbuilding and ship repair. We op-
erate steelmaking plants on the Eastern
Seaboard and the Pacific Coast; ship-
yards on the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf
Coasts; manufacturing units and fabri-
cating works in twelve states; and sales
offices in most leading cities. A new
centralized research facility, the Beth-
lehem Steel Company-Homer Research
Laboratories, costing in excess of $25
million, located in Bethlehem, Pa.,
rivals the finest in any industry.
Read Our Booklet—The eligibility re-
quirements for the Loop Course, as
well as a description of the way it
operates, are more fully covered in

PHOTO RADAR
The term photo radar is here applied to a new
high resolution radar system, that produces data
resembling air photographs. Using a simulated
long antenna, the new system has been developed
at the University of Michigan.
by PHILLIP A. KAUFMAN
High resolution radar map of Wash-
ington, D.C.
On April 19, I960 at the Washing-
ton, D.C. National Airport, the U. S.
Army unveiled a new type of combat-
surveillance radar system. The unique
feature of this system is the data pro-
cessing that produces the effect of an
extremely long antenna which expands
in length in direct proportion to the
radar range. This, in principle, can
provide a very high resolution display
in which objects separated by small an-
gular distances are distinguishable.
This system, designated as the
AN/UPD-1 (XPM-1), was developed
by the Institute of Science and Tech-
nology at the University of Michigan.
This radar research is a part of Project
Michigan, which is sponsored by the
U. S. Army Combat-Surveillance Agen-
cy of the U. S. Army Signal Corps.
Resolution Important
The major shortcoming of previous
radar systems was the lack of azimuth
resolution. Objects in close proximity
could not be individually distin-
guished. In combat surveillance the tar-
gets of military interest are against a
background of the surrounding ter-
rain; therefore, unless a radar system
has a fine resolution, both in the azi-
muth and range, the target may go un-
detected because of the large clutter
return from the background. With con-

ventional techniques, fine resolution in
range was readily attainable with short-
duration radar pulses. Since with con-
ventional radar, angular resolution is
directly related to the antenna beam-
width, the only avenues for improve-
ments in azimuth resolution were
through an increase in antenna size, an
increase in frequency, or a combination
of both. Although the largest feasible
size for an airborne antenna and the
highest practical radar frequency (dic-
tated by available peak power sources
and acceptable attenuation for various
weather conditions) were used, it was
evident that the angular resolution was
inadequate for surveillance beyond a
few miles.
Synthetic Antenna
The synthetic antenna method for
producing high resolution radar was
suggested at a University of Michigan
summer conference in 1953. This new
idea became the subject of discussion
by Dr. C. Sherwin of the University of
Illinois, W. Hausz of the General Elec-
tric Company, J. Koehler of the Philco
Corporation and Dr. Louis Cutrona of
the University of Michigan. It was
thought that an extremely long anten-
na could be synthesized by using the
forward motion of the aircraft to car-
ry a radar antenna to positions which
could then be treated as though they
were the individual elements of a lin-
ear antenna array.
The fundamental idea can best be
grasped by consideration of Fig. 1. For
the physical antenna array shown in
Fig. 1(a), the individual transmitting
and receiving elements are dipoles.
While each dipole has a broad radia-
tion pattern, the entire array of dipoles
is made to produce a narrow antenna
beam by making the electrical lengths
of the individual transmission lines
such that signals arriving in phase at
the dipoles are added in phase at the
main transmission line to the radar.
Since transmission and reception at
each of the dipoles is simultaneous, this
fixed adjustment of phases serves to
maintain the desired beam pattern.
Fig. 1(b) depicts the generation of
the synthetic array. In this case the in-
dividual elements of the array, as in-
dicated by the x's, do not exist simul-
taneously. Starting with the position at
the extreme left, a radar pulse is trans-
mitted, received and recorded. A short
time later the aircraft has carried the
antenna to the second position where
another pulse is transmitted and the
received signals recorded. In this way
a signal is recorded for each position
of the synthetic array. To achieve the
effect of a linear array such as Fig.
1(a), the return signals must contain
phase information which is preserved
in the recording. Then by appropriate
data processing it should be possible to
retrieve the stored data and combine
it in proper phase to synthesize the
desired effect of a narrow-beamed
antenna.
It was evident that the radar would
have to have excellent transmitter fre-
quency stability and a stable frequency
reference for use in comparing the
phase of the returned signals with the
phase of the transmitted pulses. The
method of signal storage (recording)
had to preserve the range information

accomplished separately for each ele-
ment of radar range.
In theory, the resolution in the azi-
muth direction for a synthetic antenna
array is independent of range, inde-
pendent of frequency, and smaller than
the physical size of the actual antenna
carried by the aircraft. This assumes
the generation of a synthetic antenna
of a length equal to the distance across
the radar beam at each radar range.
When Project MICHIGAN was in-
augurated in the fall of 1953, a small
group undertook an evaluation of this
new concept for radars. Analytic ex-
pressions were obtained for the re-
ceived data and the theoretical azi-
muth resolution was verified with fil-
ter theory. Expressions were also ob-
tained for the operations to be per-
formed by the data processor. Because
of the achievable lengths of synthetic
antennas, it was not feasible to neglect
the curvature of the phase front of re-
ceived signals. It would be impossible
to approach the theoretical angular
resolution unless the antenna were fo-
cused. Since the curvature of the phase
front varies with radar range, the data
processor needed to be one which ap-
plied a focusing function that varied
with range.

Data Processing
As this analysis progressed, the group
became convinced that the synthetic-
antenna technique held promise and that
a breadboard system should be built for
experimental evaluation. Photographic
film was selected as the storage me-
dium for the received radar signals.
With film as a storage medium, three
dimensions were available for record-
ing: distance across the film, distance
along the film, and the exposure. Film
had the further advantage of provid-
ing a permanent record which could be
processed many times using different
processing parameters. Digital proces-
sing techniques for generating the syn-
thetic antenna did not appear promis-
ing because of the number of bits of
information to be handled and the
need for focusing functions which dif-
fered for each segment of radar range.
After a period of basic laboratory ex-
perimentation, an analog data-proces-
sing technique was evolved which was
not only simple, but which also pro-
vided simultaneous focusing of the ra-
dar data at all radar ranges.
By the end of 1954, a great many of
the components for the radar system
had been proven by laboratory experi-
mentation and microwave components
for the radar were on order. It was de-
cided to build a preliminary model of
the radar in the laboratory and to
check its performance with a roof-
mounted antenna before proceeding
with the fabrication of an airborne
breadboard. In this way enough ex-
perience could be gained to finalize a
design before an aircraft became avail-
able.
A stabilizing cavity and a crystal-
controlled reference at the IF frequen-
cy were selected as the means for ob-
taining the necessary radar frequency
stability and coherence. With this
scheme, the prime frequency reference
is a continuously operating klystron
stabilized by a high Q cavity. The sec-
ond reference at the IF frequency, also
continuously operating, is used to
single-sideband modulate the RF fre-
quency. A chain of pulsed klystron
amplifiers is then used to produce the
desired RF pulse shape and to boost
the power level for transmission. On
reception, the prime frequency refer-
ence serves as the local oscillator for
heterodyning the received signals.
Experiments
The laboratory breadboard was op-
erating with a roof-mounted antenna
by the fall of 1955. Standard laboratory
oscilloscopes were used as an output
display and a modified scope cam-
era was used for recording. In the
spring of 1956 work was started on the
fabrication of the components for an
airborne breadboard system, gyro
mounted on the antenna base. The na-
vigator established the long-time aver-
age while the gyro corrected for short-
time yawing.
Success was achieved on August 23,
1957. This was the fifth flight on
which data were recorded. After this
one successful flight, which demon-
strated high angular resolution with
the synthetic-antenna technique, it was
two months before another successful
flight was achieved. As with most R&amp;D
programs there was a period in which
everything seemed to go wrong. How-
ever, there were some encouraging re-
sults.
Equipment reliability was improved
and a number of fruitful flights were
made in the Willow Run area. In the
spring of 1958 high-resolution strip
maps were obtained of the Fort Hua-
chuca area and of Tucson, Arizona.
By this time, the capability of the
synthetic-antenna technique was recog-
nized, and steps were taken to initiate
the procurement of experimental mod-
els mounted in U. S. Army aircraft.
In 1958 a subcontract was let to Tex-
as Instruments, Inc. for four experi-
mental models of the synthetic anten-
na radar system. The group portion of
the systems was fabricated at the Wil-
low Run Airport by The Institute of
Science and Technology. These experi-
mental models successfully produced
high-resolution radar photographs of
testing areas in Washington, D.C.,
Texas and Michigan. These results and
two of the experimental systems were
displayed for the press in early I960.
Work is still going on at the univer-
sity to improve the system and make it
a truly effective tactical device. Results
obtained to date prove that the
AN/UPD-1 represents a significant
improvement in ground surveillance
radar systems.

PERSONNEL
RECRUITERS
Engineers beware, the army recruiter is not the
only recruiter who may be looking for you. The
newest prowler in the jungle-like world of big
business is the management pirate; the firm that
specializes in hiring top management personnel
from one company for another.
by MICHAEL GORDON
What is personnel recruiting? How
does it operate? Why should it be of
interest to a person in a technical field?
These are questions to which the en-
gineer with an eye toward a higher in-
come should know the answers.
Personnel recruiting, or if you pre-
fer, pirating, head hunting or body
snatching, can broadly be defined as
an activity that companies engage in
to find people to work for them. More
specifically it refers to the searching
for and hiring of people in top level
positions. Most companies do not do
their own recruiting directly, but hire
the services of a professional recruiting
firm.
The task of finding a person to fill
a particular position such as sales man-
ager, vice president or chief engineer,
is not always an easy one. Often
the people qualified to fill such a posi-
tion are already employed. If this is
the case, a firm must make their posi-
tion more attractive than that of other
firms. Sometimes a larger salary is not
enough incentive to cause a person to
change firms. A greater challenge,
more responsibility and more prestige
are often more important factors that
determine whether this change is worth
while.

man between a firm and the prospec-
tive employer. The recruiter is faced
with a big task: he must find people
interested in a particular job, then de-
termine whether these people are qual-
ified and which are best suited for the
job. Many times he contacts a person,
tells him about the job, arranges a
meeting between a man and his future
employer, and watches the man accept
the new position without the person's
original employer ever knowing about
it. It is cases like this that have made
the term "pirating" a common syno-
nym for recruiting. Although person-
nel recruiting has become closely asso-
ciated with the hiring of people at the
executive level, a large amount of re-
cruiting is being done to obtain tech-
nically trained personnel. This is why
the subject should be of interest to the
engineer.
How The Recruiter Works
A large manufacturer builds a new
plant and is faced with the problem of
finding a plant manager. There is no
one in his own ranks he can promote
or transfer to the new position with-
out creating a vacancy that would be
just as hard to fill; the company must
hire a new person. Because the com-
pany has no experience in finding peo-
ple who are qualified plant managers
and because it feels it would be wast-
ing valuable time and money if it tries
to do so, the company hires a person-
nel recruiting firm. Of course, the com-
pany must decide who will be hired,
since the recruiter only finds qualified
people interested in the new job.
The manufacturer tells the recruiter
the qualifications and training the new
manager must have, what his salary
will be, and what the position will re-
quire of him. From here on the recruit-
er takes over. From a list of peo-
ple in his files, he will determine
which will most likely fill the
position. If he thinks that none have
the necessary qualifications, he will
look elsewhere. He may investigate the
possibilities of other plant managers in
similar industries or of people who are
not plant managers but have the abil-
ity to do this type of work.
The recruiter may not tell a prospect
he is being considered for a position
until he is sure the person meets the
qualifications. When the recruiter does
offer a person the position, he may not
tell him the name of the company that
wants to hire him until he knows that
the person is definitely interested in
the position. Once he has narrowed
the field to a few finalists, he will ar-
range meetings between the manufac-
turer and the prospects. It is then up
to the manufacturer to decide whether
to hire one of the prospects. If the
manufacturer is not satisfied with any
of them, he may have the recruiter con-
tinue the search or he may hire a new
recruiter.
The Advantages of Recruiters
Although the example of the recruit-
er was intended to show how he oper-
ates, it also points out many of the
advantages. Experience in personnel
searching is one of the most important
considerations. The professional re-
cruiter knows where to look for peo-
ple, how to get references, and make
evaluations. Secrecy is another of his
advantages. Many companies do not
want it known that they are in the
market for top level personnel and the
recruiter can keep this secret.
Where to start looking for a vice
president, a plant manager, or a chief
engineer is a problem that a company
may have to face. If they hire a profes-
sional recruiter, he will go straight to
his files. Some recruiting firms have
files that contain the names and notes
on up to 100,000 people. These files
contain information on a person's edu-
cation, intelligence, experience and per-
sonality. Not every name in a recruit-
er's file belongs to a person who is
unemployed or wants another job. It
is often the task of the recruiter to
convince a person that he should leave
a job where he is happily employed
and move to another that has greater
opportunities and offers a greater chal-
lenge.
When a recruiter establishes a list
of people whom he thinks are qualified
for the position in question, his next
step is to determine which one is best
suited. Here again the recruiter experi-
ence comes in handy. The recruiter
may never look at a written statement
from a person that the prospect has
listed as a reference. He may never
contact any of the other people a pros-
pect lists as references. The recruiter is
sneaky, he goes to old bosses and old
associates. But he is always aware that
these people may not give objective
references. This is where experience
plays an important role. The recruiter
must know when a person is being
honest, when he is just trying to be
nice or nasty, or is being influenced by
an emotion or prejudice.
The professional recruiter also has
the advantage of secrecy. There are
many reasons why a company may not
want it known that it is looking for a
person to fill a top level position. If
other companies in the industry find
out, they may think that the firm is
having internal troubles; this may
weaken the firm's place in the indus-
try. Often employees of a firm do not
know that a search is being made for
a new plant manager or vice president.
If they knew, they may resent the fact

SPEAKERS
Even with the finest audio system, the weakest link
in the chain of faithful sound reproduction is the
speaker. This article is a short introduction to
speaker theory that may prove very useful to the
individual planning a hi-fi system.

by BARRY FEINBERG
The adage, "A chain is only as
strong as its weakest link," is very ap-
plicable to the field of high fidelity.
In a high fidelity reproduction system,
whether it be a commercial "package
deal" or a component system, it is
important that each component be
matched to obtain maximum fidelity. If
a single part of the system is inferior,
the sound reproduction will only be
as good as that inferior part, for the
rest of the system will only reproduce
faithfully those signals which it re-
ceives. If signals are distorted or
changed by a component, the change
is passed on to the rest of the system
and ultimately to the ear of the listener.
Therefore, matched components with
respect to frequency response and other
electronic distortion factors is essential
to obtain the best sound for your Hi-
Fi dollar.
In a high fidelity system, one of the
most important, yet least understood
parts is the loudspeaker. To pick a
good speaker that compliments elec-
tronic components, an understanding
of the operation and make-up of the
Hi-Fi speaker is essential. The loud-
speaker is a device designed to move
air in response to electrical signals sup-
plied to it by an audio amplifier. Work-
ing back and forth very much like a
piston in an air compressor, the speaker
moves the air around it, causing com-
pression and rarefaction, which results
in the sensation of sound.
The full range of human hearing lies
between 20 and 20,000 cycles per sec-
ond. It is essential then for the loud-
speaker to be able to reproduce as
much of this frequency spectrum as
possible to create the original sounds
with all the overtones. This is the
meaning of high fidelity.
Cones Important
At first glance this seems to be an
easy task for a speaker; unfortunately
it is not so simple. To understand the
difficulty a single loudspeaker has in
reproducing the full audio frequency
range, it is necessary to see what hap-
pens to the speaker and its cone as the
range is widened. Since the function of
a loudspeaker is to move air, the cone
should be active at all frequencies in
the audible range. If a theoretically
perfect speaker cone were possible, it
would be weightless, not subject to in-
ertia and non-resonant. First consider
the full-range all-purpose speaker.
Since speakers are expected to repro-
duce faithfully each of the many differ-
ent frequency patterns imposed upon it
by the amplifier, the cone of the
speaker would be forced to vibrate in
a very complex pattern.
If the action of a loudspeaker cone
were photographed with a slow-motion
camera, it would be apparent that the
rim of the cone was unable to keep
pace with the rapid movement of the
portion of the cone nearest the voice
coil. This is because of the inertia of
the cone. Large speaker cones repro-
duce low frequency sounds best; small
cones reproduce high-frequency sounds
most effectively. Designers of single
unit speakers usually try to compensate
for the inertia problem by utilizing the
central portion of a cone for high fre-
quencies and the peripheral portion for
low frequencies. Thus, many single unit

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


aluminum domes over their voice coils
which radiate sound in the high fre-
quency range.
Multi-speaker Systems
Up to now, our problem has been:
having designed a speaker that will
give good frequency response with low
distortion at low frequencies, it begins
to distort at mid-range, and almost re-
fuses to vibrate at high frequencies.
Speakers that can handle the mid-range
well do a poor job at both the upper
and lower ends of the spectrum and a
high frequency speaker pretends that
low notes are not even there.
To interject another old saying, "If
the mountain will not come to Moham-
med, Mohammed must go to the moun-
tain." Since any one speaker will not
faithfully reproduce the entire fre-
quency range, we must give it just that
portion of the spectrum it can repro-
duce. This is done by means of a filter
network, called a crossover, which di-
vides the audio frequency range among
two or three and sometimes four in-
dividual speakers. Each speaker is de-
signed to operate over a narrow range
of frequencies, and with proper circuit
design, the narrow range of each unit
overlaps in such a way that the com-
plete audible range is smoothly covered.
VOICE COIL
In considering a system using indi-
vidual speakers the low-frequency unit,
often called the woofer, is the starting
point. In the woofer's driver unit, the
important thing is the low frequencies
range. Faithful lows are insured if the
speaker has a moderately stiff, large
diameter cone backed by a large per-
manent magnet of high efficiency or
flux density, such as the Alnico V mag-
net. A high compliance suspension sys-
tem allowing relatively unrestricted
movement at high driving power along
with a deep cone diaphragm are essen-
tial for good low frequency response.
Heavy speaker frame and magnet con-
struction are also important in prevent-
ing distortion caused by warping of the
structure in mounting.
Mid-range Drivers
The middle range speakers, mid-
range drivers, are governed by the
same design factors that apply to the
woofer but with some modifications.
The speaker cone must be a high com-
pliance type, but it need not be as large
nor as deep as cone of the woofer. By
virtue of the smaller, more rigid and
not so deep speaker cone, the mid-
range driver can handle the mid-band
frequencies from about 600 to 1,200
cycles per second, with little or no dis-
tortion. The design of the mid-range
driver is not limited to the cone type,
for there are many variations of the
SOFT SUSPENSION
SYSTEM
V-shaped or horn type of driver which
employs a dome diaphragm and a
sound chamber. Though the design of
the speaker affects its response, its func-
tion in relation to the frequency spec-
trum is not changed.
To reproduce the upper end of the
audible range, a high-frequency speaker
or, as it is more commonly called,
tweeter is used. The tweeter is a hard-
cone, small-diameter or hard shelled
dome diaphragm unit which performs
with great fidelity and efficiency in ex-
tremely high audio frequency ranges.
The hard cone and the dome types of
drivers are, in reality, simply small
loudspeakers that operate in piston
fashion in the frequency range where
the current is weakest.
Co-axial Speakers
By combining speakers in the same
enclosure and using the proper cross-
over network, enough of the entire
audio frequency range is smoothly cov-
ered so that it provides enjoyable lis-
tening for even the most critical
audiophile. A variation on the idea of
multiplicity of speakers is the combined
or coaxial loudspeaker. Here a common
mounting axis and voice coil design are
used. A crossover network is still em-
ployed to divide the frequencies prop-
erly and send them to the correspond-
ing speaker section.

New Color Theory
A new theory of human color per-
ception which represents the first com-
plete mathematical formulation of the
behavior of any of the human senses
has recently been announced. The the-
ory is likely to have major impact in
a wide variety of applications where
color is utilized—such as photography,
television, data display systems, and
meteorological satellites and other
space surveillance vehicles.
The color-vision theory is one of the
most exciting developments, if not the
most exciting new concept in this area
of investigation. It is the first of what
is hoped will be a long series of mathe-
matical descriptions of human percep-
tive processes.
The new mathematical theory is the
first to describe the processes that occur
during ideal human perception of col-
or. It was developed during studies of
man's sensory perception and thought
apparatus, studies that were directed
toward linking man to advanced com-
munications systems.
An area of possible future applica-
tion of the theory, is in the TIROS

series of meteorological satellites. Such
satellites are completely color blind,
that is, they sense only black and white.
If such satellites could utilize chromatic
or color information, they would be
much more sensitive to meteorological
variations. Another dimension would
be added.
The application of color detection
has been hampered by the fact that
the sensory apparatus of such satellites
must operate in orbit under both day-
light and night-time conditions. Thus,
in order to detect color, a capability
almost human in nature—which does
not depend upon light conditions for
a wide range of natural illuminations
—is required.
With the mathematical theory of col-
or perception now available the con-
struction of a sensory device which
would allow us to detect color within
the TIROS' field of view over most of
its circuit around the world appears
within the realm of practicality.
Super Magnet
Scientists have achieved one of the
most sought-for goals of modern sci-
ence: development of the first super-
strength superconducting magnet. For
its size, weight, and energy consump-
tion it is by far the most powerful
magnet ever built.
Such a magnet has been vigorously
sought in dozens of laboratories
throughout the world. Until a year or
two ago it was considered theoretically
impossible to construct.
The size of a doughnut and only a
pound in weight, the super magnet
creates a magnetic field twice as strong
as that from a conventional iron-core
electromagnet as large as an automo-
bile, weighing 40,000 pounds, and op-
erated to saturation of the iron. Such
a conventional iron-core magnet needs
its own power plant to continuously
supply the 100,000 watts or more of
power to run it.
In contrast, the new super magnet
runs from an ordinary automobile stor-
age battery. The only power the battery
continuously supplies is a few watts to
overcome the small losses in the wires
leading to the magnet.
The superconducting magnet pro-
duces a magnetic strength, or flux den-
sity, of 43,000 gauss (43,000 lines per
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Iron-core magnets begin to saturate at
about 20,000 gauss, and can be driven
to greater strengths only by the brute-
force application of large amounts of
power that force them beyond satura-
tion. Their coils would melt almost
instantly if they were not oil or water
cooled.
The new magnet is the first of what
is certain to be super-strength mag-
nets of the future. Scientists agree that
such magnets will revolutionize almost
every aspect of man's use of electricity
including the generation, distribution
and use of electric power. It will make
possible a whole new generation of
powerful atom smashers. It increases
the possibility of a magnetic "bottle"
in which the vast energy of the hydro-
gen bomb reaction can be harnessed
for useful power. And it makes more
feasible some of the far-out methods
proposed for long-distance travel in
space.
The new magnet is wound from a
wire which is a superconductor. These
are materials which have the remark-
able property of losing all electrical
resistance at temperatures near absolute
zero. Once started, supercurrents of
electricity flow through superconduc-
tors forever without loss in strength.
Until a few years ago superconduc-
tors were simply a laboratory curiosity.
Scientists believed that strong magnets
could not be made from them because
the magnetism they create by their
supercurrents destroys their supercon-
ductivity. Last year it was demonstrated
that certain superconductors retain
their properties even in strong mag-
netic fields.
The superconducting magnet con-
tains a half-mile of wire about the
diameter of a sewing thread. The wire
is a niobium-zirconium base alloy of
these two superconducting metals.
About 5000 turns of the threadlike
wire are wound into a coil or solenoid,
two inches in diameter, one and one-
half inches long, and with a "hole in
the doughnut" of one-half inch.
The coil is immersed in a vessel of
liquid helium which keeps it at a tem-
perature near -450 degrees F. The en-
ergy required to cool the coil is only
a small fraction of that needed to cre-
ate a comparable magnetic field with
a standard electromagnet. Essentially,
therefore, the magnet produces almost
all of its super-magnetism "for free."
Although only three times the thick-
ness of a human hair, the wire from
which the coil is wound carries a cur-
rent of 20 amperes. At this current
density, a scaled-up wire the thickness
of a piece of chalk (one square centi-
meter) could carry 200,000 amperes, or
the total installed capacity of the 2000
up-to-date homes in a town of 7000
people.
New Device Finds Flaws
in Ferrous Metals
A portable magnetic device for de-
tecting cracks and flaws in ferrous
metals has recently been placed on the
market. Seal-Lock magnetic crack de-
tectors supplement a number of radio-
graphic and fluoroscopic systems mar-
keted for use in nondestructive testing.
Designed to meet the need for an
a-c/d-c unit portable enough for use
in the field, the 14-pound crack de-
tector is essentially a powerful U-shaped
two-pole electromagnet which can be
energized from a 6- or 12-volt auto-
mobile storage battery or from a 110-
vole service outlet through a built-in
rectifier.
As it is used, the detector is placed
so that the two poles bridge the area
to be examined. When power is switch-
ed on, this causes lines of nonreversing
magnetic flux to flow through the spec-
imen. To make this flux pattern visi-
ble, a surface coating of ferromagnetic
powder is sprinkled over the 72-square-
inch area that can be covered in one
test. Since any discontinuities in the
metal specimen distort the steady-state
magnetic field, the particles align them-
selves in a pattern duplicating the out-
lines of any flaws that are present.
After particles over normal areas are
blown or brushed away, particles ad-
hering to flaw areas remain to indicate
the nature and extent of the flaw. Little
if any operator training is necessary to
permit detection of invisible hairline
cracks or flaws as deep as l/2 inch
below the surface.

gency knock-out punch while they sit
idle in launching chambers aboard
atomic submarines.
The solid fuel system in the Polaris
—a mainstay of America's retaliatory
striking power—must be kept at a con-
stant temperature to insure proper
firing.
The product is called PLATECOIL.
A single plate contains many loops of
sustaining individual families or vil-
lages by irrigating the land they live on
and supplying their household water
needs, is the first step toward such
progress.
A prototype of such a system, includ-
ing a 50-watt power plant, has been
built and tested. The experiemental unit
taps the heat energy of sunlight and
converts it directly into electricity by
means of a thermoelectric generator.

Stainless steel and the Polaris Missile have become close friends aboard atomic
submarines. The heat exchanger coils keep the Polaris' solid fuel at a constant
temperature while it nestles in the submarine firing chamber.
coils. It is used in numerous industrial
applications, as well as in this defense
project.
PLATECOIL is fabricated by embos-
sing the stainless steel sheet and then
welding two pieces—or an embossed
piece and a flat piece together—to form
a series of coil-like passages through
which the heating or cooling medium
is circulated.
Whether the missile-bearing subma-
rine is in frigid arctic waters or in
tropic seas near the equator, PLATE-
COIL maintains a constant temperature
inside the launching chamber.
Stainless steel is needed to resist
possible corrosive environments. The
PLATECOIL is designed for quick,
economical installation.
Sun Power
Millions of people in underdevelop-
ed areas of the world can have new
hope for an improved standard of
living.
A small self-contained electric pow-
er plant and pumping unit, capable of
The power generated drives an electric
motor having a water pump connected
directly to it. These are the only mov-
ing parts in the whole irrigation system.
A larger solar-thermoelectric system,
scaled up from the 50-watt version, is
now under development and has been
operated at part power. This unit will
have a capability of up to 200 watts
of electric power. It will pump enough
water from a depth of 20 feet to irri-
gate approximately four acres of land
at the rate of 24 inches of water a
year. This is about the average amount
of precipitation in Minneapolis, Minn.,
or Honolulu, Hawaii. The unit can
supply the personal needs of 1200 peo-
ple on the basis of five gallons of
water per person per day.
To provide the stated amount of
water, the system must operate 10
hours a day for only 250 days of the
year. This leaves a safety margin of
about one-third of the year to provide
for cloudy weather, when the solar-
thermoelectric generator would not
operate.
The solar-thermoelectric system uses
an eight-foot saucer-shaped (parabolic)
mirror which gathers the sunlight and
focuses it on the thermoelectric gen-
erator. The generator is a metal "box"
about eight inches on a side and about
two inches thick. One face is black, to
more efficiently absorb the heat of the
sunlight shining upon it.
Inside the generator are 72 thermo-
electric elements, or copules, each com-
posed of a "leg" of p-type semicon-
ductor material and one of n-type. Like
all thermoelectric materials, they have
the unique ability to generate an elec-
trical voltage when heated to a higher
temperature on one side than on the
other.
The 72 thermoelectric couples are
connected together electrically in series
so that their voltages add together. The
entire generator weighs just over 16
pounds. The generator can operate with
temperatures on its hot side as high
as 1100 degrees F. The cool side of
the generator runs at 150 degrees F.
The cost of solar-thermoelectric pow-
er appears to be competitive in many
areas of the world, even at this early
stage of its development. The econom-
ics depends upon a variety of factors
such as generator voltage and power
rating and heat flux through the
thermoelectric materials. These factors
change with the desired application,
making it difficult to generalize about
the cost of solar-thermoelectric power.
Present estimates place it well above
the rates achieved with large centraliz-
ed power plants in the United States.
But for many areas and for many
purposes, solar-thermoelectric power
appears to be economically feasible.
And improved thermoelectric materials
and mass production techniques would
reduce its present cost and broaden its
usefulness.
The attractiveness of such power,
however, goes beyond the single con-
sideration of cost. The solar-thermo-
electric generator is a simple, reliable,
maintenance-free, static system, requir-
ing little technical skill to install it or
keep it in operation. Solar-thermo-
electric power generation will not be
bottlenecked in underdeveloped coun-
tries of the world by a shortage of
technically trained and experienced
personnel.

Edward M. Davis, Jr. (B.S.E.E., Carnegie Tech '55; M.S.,
Cal Tech '56; Ph.D., Stanford '58) is directing micro-elec-
tronic device development at IBM's Poughkeepsie, New
York Laboratories.

DR. DAVIS AND MICRO-DEVICES
When Dr. Edward M. Davis was working for his bachelor's
degree, miniaturization was a novelty. Today, with the tran-
sistor and the printed circuit commonplace, micro-miniatur-
ization is one of the newest challenges in electronics. Ed
Davis is helping to meet that challenge.
Today's computeroperationstakeonlymillionthsof a second;
tomorrow's may accelerate to billionths. In a billionth of a
second, however, even light can travel only about a foot, and
the physical sizeof an electronic circuit may slowits operation
critically.The answer is in micro-electronics where complete
circuits a re packaged on minuscule substrates, and each tran-
sistor may occupy less than a thousandth of a square inch.
Since early in 1961, Ed Davis has been in charge of an IBM
engineering project exploring the parameters of advanced
micro-devices. His work may very well helpestablish the tech-
nology of future computers. Equally important, he and his
colleagues are already gathering significant knowledge in
the advanced study of solid state electronics.
A basic approach is encouraged at IBM. Whether in research,
development, manufacturing, or programming, the IBM sci-
entist and engineer are encouraged to go to the heart of the
problem.The IBM representative interviewingonyourcampus

(Continued from page 17)
that they are not being considered for
the position. Many times the person
who holds the position in question is
not aware that he is going to be re-
placed. The reason for this is obvious.
The man will quit and leave the com-
pany with no one to handle the duties
of the position until a new man is
hired, which in some cases may take
a long time.
The ability to keep the identity of
the firm unknown is another advantage
of the recruiter. Sometimes he may not
tell a prospect what company wants to
hire him until he introduces the man
to a representative of the company. He
may do this to see if the man is really
interested in the job. Experience and
secrecy are two of the main reasons
why firms hire professional personnel
recruiters.
Technically Trained People
A good man is hard to find. This is
true of both the executive and the en-
gineer. Consequently, most of the per-
sonnel recruiting that goes on today
is directed toward finding either the ex-
ecutive or the technically trained man.
The recruiting of technically trained
people by a professional recruiter is
confined to those who earn over $15,-
000 per year. There are many reasons
for this. First, most firms use other
means of recruiting people below this
level. Newspaper advertising and in-
terviews at colleges and universities
are two of these means. Second, there
is a rapid turnover of technical people
below this level. This is caused by the
shortage of this type of worker. As
soon as a man is hired by one firm at
a particular level, he begins to look
for a better paying job with a competi-
tor, and because of the shortage of
people in his field he is usually suc-
cessful. If he is a good man and can
boost his salary above $15,000 per
year, he may find other firms looking
for him.
As mentioned earlier, the ability to
operate in secret is one of the recruit-
ers main advantages. They do a great
deal of their searching in secret. Often
they have to visit a firm they are work-
ing for. This firm may not want any of
the other employees to know that it is
going to hire an outsider so the recruit-
er has to pose as someone else. He may
act as a salesman, a consultant or may-
be just an old friend of the boss. Some
companies know that some of their top
men are being sought after by recruit-
ers and make it hard for the recruiters
to contact them. Again it may be neces-
sary for the recruiter to assume a dis-
guise. He may try to get in touch with
the man at his home or just bump into
him accidentally on the street. Some-
times recruiters arrange secret meetings
between prospects and employers. The
classical spot for this type of meeting
is behind the potted rubber plant in
an airport, but this location has be-
come crowded and other spots are be-
coming more popular.
When a firm suddenly has one of
its top level technical employees leave
for a better position with another firm,
the firm sometimes gets very angry. It
may call the other firm a pirate, a body
snatcher, a head hunter, or a few other
well-known phrases. At the same time
it may try to recruit a man from
a third firm. This illustrates a few
interesting points. When can re-
cruiting be called pirating? The an-
swer to this depends on which side of
the fence you are standing on. Cer-
tainly, the fellow that gets a better job
through the efforts of a recruiter does
not feel as though he has been shang-
haied. And the firm that hired him
will not feel like a pirate, or think
they have done anything wrong. They
just offered a man a better opportunity
than he had before, and he accepted. If
the firm that lost the man wanted to
keep him, one can understand why
they may feel a little upset. Another
question that comes to mind is, "How
many companies engage in recruit-
ing?" Although many companies deny
having anything to do with recruiters,
the recruiters themselves claim that
most larger firms use their services.
Opinions
The fact that most large firms do use
recruiters can only be regarded as an
approval of them. The companies that
do not use them try to bring their top
level employees up through the ranks.
They may spend a great deal of money,
time, and effort training a man, only
to watch him go to a competitor. They
maintain that the employee should
have a feeling of loyalty to his firm.
These companies are sometimes prime
targets for recruiters and, therefore,
are understandably opposed to them.
On the other hand, companies that
support recruiting, claim that it in-
creases an individual's opportunities.
They claim that a man with real poten-
tial can get stuck in a position that
leads nowhere, in a company that is
going nowhere. This man can benefit
both himself and another firm by
changing jobs and the recruiter may be
his means of doing so. These firms
realize that they also are fair territory
for recruiters. They maintain that to
keep good men, you have to keep them
satisfied.
Whether personnel recruiting is
right or wrong is a question that will
never be answered. People who have
benefitted by the efforts of a recruiter
are in favor of it. People who have not
been successful are opposed. Two
things are certain: as the demand for
technically trained people increase, re-
cruiting activity will also increase and
the personnel recruiter will be around
for a long time.

Long lead time is essential to the
development of large nuclear
space power systems. Present meth-
ods of power generation would require
an impractical heat rejection surface
nearly the size of a football field for a
power output of one megawatt—power
which will be needed for critical space
missions already in the planning stage.
Garrett's AiResearch Divisions have
now completed the initial SPUR design
studies and proved the project's feasi-
bility to supply continuous accessory
power and low thrust electrical propul-
sion in space for long periods of time.
Cutting projected 1 MW power sys-
tems to l/10th the size and l/5th the
weight of present power systems under
development will be possible because
of SPUR's capability to operate at
higher temperatures, thereby sharply
reducing the required radiator area.
Garrett has been working with the
Air Force and the Atomic Energy
Commission on SPUR as the prime
contractor for more than one year and
has more than five years of experience
in space nuclear power development.
Also an industry leader in high speed
rotating machinery, heat transfer
equipment, metallurgy and accessory
power systems, the company is devel-
oping design solutions for SPUR in
these critical component system areas.

Matching for Stereo
With a background in the operation
and function of a high fidelity speaker
system, one is able to assay the merits
of a speaker system and choose the best
one for his needs, whether it be for
monaural or stereo reproduction. For
stereo operation, quality and response
considerations are the same as those
for monaural, but two speaker systems
are required instead of one. Many peo-
ple today are converting their old mon-
aural systems into stereo and find that
they need another speaker. The question
arises: what should they buy? In stereo,
optimum performance is obtained with
matched components, therefore the new
speaker should be the same make and
model as the old. If another type of
speaker is desired, one should be chosen
to match the performance of the old
speaker as much as possible so that an
equal balance of sound is achieved.
With matched speakers, the best stereo
effect is obtained.
The final considerations in the selec-
tion of a loudspeaker will be the space
requirement, budget restrictions, and
finally the effectiveness of the different
systems as they sound to the listener;
the selection of a loudspeaker should
be made not only on a structural basis,
but also on the basis of a listening test
and the consideration of the plans you
have for the future.

PUT THE ATOM TO WORK
• This is just the kind of challenge Allison
scientists and engineers like to "get their
teeth into."
With major research and engineering ef-
fort focused on the field of nuclear energy
conversion, Allison has several nuclear pro-
jects currently in progress, including;
An exceptionally mobile, lightweight, com-
pact reactor which can produce from 2,000
to 3,000 kilowatts ...
A nuclear rocket engine to launch large
payloads into earth orbit, propulsion for
manned space vehicles ...
A nuclear powered thermally Regenerative
Fuel Cell to light small cities, power mag-
netohydrodynamic devices, submarines and
space platforms ...
We expect these programs now in the re-
search phase to have broad applications in
the power and propulsion systems of the next
generation.
To this end, our atomic scientists and
engineers draw upon such extensive, modern
facilities as physical chemistry, solid-state
physics, radio-isotope, infra-red, fluid dy-
namics, rocket propulsion and metallurgical
laboratories; a vacuum chamber which simu-
lates pressures at altitudes in excess of 200
miles; a liquid metal loop; analog and digital
computers, and numerous other research
tools. These efforts and facilities are further
backed-up by every resource General Motors
possesses.
As nuclear technology advances, Allison
will continue probing new forms of energy
conversion in the search for improved forms
of propulsion and power.
In short, we take all energy sources to be
our starting point, as reflected in our guiding
theme:

with respect to your career choice?
Of course, you are... and should be. But don't
overlook the fact that "thinking big" really applies
to your own personal growth and achievement—
and not necessarily to the physical size of an
organization. And that's an important reason for
investigating the opportunities here at Sikorsky
Aircraft.
We believe that our company offers just the
"right-sized" environment for young engineers
seeking strong personal identification and stature
opportunities. The technical talent we require can
enjoy diversified activities in a field that permits
full expression of engineering imagination and
professional competence.
At Sikorsky, we pioneered helicopters. Our
continuing objective is to further advance V /STOL
(vertical short take-off and landing) aircraft.
The engineering programs are stimulating and
far-ranging. Assignments could include joining an
electronic team of twenty to thirty associates—or—
working with a highly selective group of four or
five on sophisticated problems of antenna radiation,
instrumentation, automatic pilot, automatic stabi-
lization—to name a few.
Your opportunity for personal growth could be

SPACE PHYSICS RESEARCH LABORATORY'S
LUNAR ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE MEASURING UNIT
Electrical Engineering
Soon man will further his knowledge of the universe by sending exploratory space vehicles to the moon
and planets. The University of Michigan is to have its part in this exploration by providing an instrument
package, capable of measuring the atmospheric pressure on the moon's surface, to the Jet Propulsion Labor-
atory for use on the Surveyor spacecraft to be launched in 1963. Under contract with NASA, the Space Phy-
sics Research Laboratory of the Electrical Engineering Department is at present designing an instrument package
containing suitable electronics to operate a magnetron cold cathode discharge guage, commonly called a
Redhead gauge after its designer. This gauge is capable of measuring total pressures between 106 mm Hg
and 10'3 mm Hg with a sensitivity of approximately 5 amp/mm Hg.
The instrumentation to be provided for this package will include an electrometer amplifier to transfer
the extremely low currents to be measured into an ou'put compatible with the spacecraft telemetry system.
This amplifier was designed and built by the Space Physics Research Laboratory. One of the many stringent
requirements of this package is that it operate at temperatures ranging from —50°C. to -(-125°C. for a period
no! less than 30 earth days.
The instrument package will provide the SPRL with atmospheric pressure data for both lunar day and
lunar night. This data will not only determine the moon's present atmospheric parameters but will aid scien-
tists in determining the moon's past history.

While visiting America, a lovely
French maiden discovered both her
visa and her money had vanished. She
was in great despair until an enterpris-
ing young sailor came to her rescue.
"My ship is sailing tonight," he said.
"I'll smuggle you aboard, hide you in
the hold and provide you with food
and blankets. All it will cost you is a
little affection."
She consented and he carried out his
promise, visiting her several times
daily. This went on for several weeks
until one day the captain of the ship
discovered the sailor paying her a visit.
After the sailor had gone, he confront-
ed the girl and upon hearing her sad
story mused, "I admire the young sea-
man's ingenuity. However, I feel it's
only fair that I inform you this is the
Staten Island Ferry."
"I seem to have run out of gas," he
said softly.
Her face, small and white, was
turned up to his, her eyes glowing
from beneath heavy lids. Her head
swam.
Slowly he bent over her.
Relax . . . He was her dentist.

Police Sergeant: "What, you back
again?"
Drunk: "Uh, huh. Any mail?"

where students gather to drink.
Two Hollywood producers, looking
for talent, sat in a front seat watching
the star of a Las Vegas show.
"I wonder who made her dress?"
the first asked.
"It's hard to say," the second re-
plied, "probably the police."
* * *
The girl -from Louisiana was in the
hospital for a check-up.
"Have you ever been X-rayed?"
"No," she said. "But ah've been
ultraviolated."
* * *
Arriving at a strange hotel, a fussy
woman thought she'd better know
where the fire escape was. So she start-
ed exploring. During her tour, she
opened a door and found herself in
a bathroom occupied by an elderly
gentleman.
"Oh, I'm sorry!" she twittered. "I
was looking for the fire escape."
Continuing her search, she presently
heard the pad of bare feet behind her
and a shout made her turn. It was the
elderly man, clad in a bath towel.
"Wait a minute!" he gasped.
"Where's the fire?"

Judge: "How did the trouble start?"
Defendent: "Well, judge, she asked
me to play a round and I didn't know
she was a golfer."

Chemical Analysis of Kiss
Properties: Ethereal in nature. Taste,
sweet: color, colorless to deep red. Is
not affected by water, but reacts
strongly to alcohol.
Occurrence: Cars, porches, parlors,
and parks. In most cases the compound
has only a transitory existence, but it
may exist for a considerable period of
time.
Chemical Behavior: It quickly breaks
up when exposed to a bright light, but
it seems more stable by moonlight. It
frequently plays the part of a catalyst
producing bonds of a more permanent
nature. The appearance of the parent
compound produces a quick and vio-
lent displacement of the individual
members of the compound.
Future Developments: Although it
is not new, it is constantly being re-
discovered. Very little is known about
the nature of the compound, in spite
of the fact that many heads are busily
engaged on the problem until late
every night.

The deans who think our jokes are
rough
Would quickly change their views
If they'd compare the ones we print
With the ones we're scared to use.

Sweet young thing: "Now, what are
we stopping for?"
M.E.: "I've lost my bearings."
She: "Well, at least you're original.
Most fellows run out of gas."

A young lady, with a touch of hay

Engrossed in her search, she suddenly

downstairs to the painter, "Would you

One use for an
artificial duck
On Sunday evening, September 24th,
a new associate of ours named Walt
Disney broadcast from 168 TV stations
a film called "Mathmagicland." It
featured an artificial duck he owns
named Donald. The film illustrated the
mathematical unity of nature and man,
while the duck quacked in order to
reassure 20,000,000 viewers that there
is no harm in such a discussion.
Lots of kids who were too young for
it will be ready next fall. Movies can
teach conic sections as easily as pie-
throwing. Movie-makers with lesser
resources than Disney can also teach
laudably. What bothers the classroom
teacher about 16mm movies is how to
get the one she wants when she wants
it instead of seven weeks later. Nobody
is to blame. The can of film has too
many classes to visit, but relief is on
the way.
Enter the Kodak Sound 8 Projector. It
projects 8mm movies with commentary
from a magnetic stripe on the film.
The greatly reduced cost and bulk
of 8mm film and equipment got home
movies off the ground. The improve-
ment of sharpness and color in the
8mm Kodachrome II Film introduced
last year is making movies really soar
as entertainment in the home. In the
schoolroom 8mm sound movies can be
expected to simulate the effect of the
paperback on the book business. The
teacher will be able to handle a teach-
ing film more like a weekly magazine
and less like a shipment of gold bullion.
A sharp eye
for Infrared
The decision to announce/// Irtran-2
Aspheric Lenses has been reached in
struggle against inhibitions. In the
photographic trade we are habituated
to a longer silence before the first blast
of the trumpets. Infrared technology
hates to wait, however.
These lenses transmit usefully from
2/u to I4/i. Three focal lengths, 1-inch,
2-inch and 3-inch, are offered off the
shelf. At//1, we seem to have done
well at providing high collecting-power
for energy without undue sacrifice of
sharpness. Sharpness was the goal. For
all the lenses, the minimum circle of
confusion computes at less than .001"
for any wavelength from 4.25/4 to 10ft,
Note italics.
In the 2jK-3fi region, the sharpness
does not compute to be as good as
farther out in the infrared. Yet we
have customers who use the lenses
there and are happy with confusion-
circle minima as large as .008".
In comparison with reflective optics
hitherto used, Irtran-2 aspheres offer
compactness and a wider field that
doesn't even show appreciable deteri-
oration as far as 2° off axis. You do give
up the perfect achromatism of mirrors.
These remarks can be interpreted as
a blatant offer here and now to sell these
lenses for cash. (Address inquiries to
Eastman Kodak Co., Special Products
Division, Rochester 4, N.Y.) Irtran-2
material resists water and common
organic solvents. It retains infrared
transparency at high temperature.
The carboxamlde way
The joy that philosophers once felt in
considering an irresistible force acting
against an immovable object is as
nothing to the joy of the peddler who
carries in his pack both an inorganic
substance that resists common organic
solvents (see left) and a solvent which
dissolves inorganic substances which
common solvents fail to dissolve.
S2.75 buys from Distillation Products
Industries (a division of ours), Roches-
ter 3, N. Y. 5 grams of N,N-Dimethyl-
benzamide. This comes as white crystals
that melt at 42°C. It is a new member
of a class of compounds of uncanny
solvent power for high polymers,
organometallics, and inorganics.
Solvation virtually demands the
liquid state. Solubility also usually rises
with temperature. Without the trouble
and peril of high-pressure tactics,
N,N-dimethylbenzamide can be main-
tained as a much hotter liquid than its
cousins. It doesn't boil until 272°C, as
compared with 152°C for N,N-di-
methylformamide and 165°C for N,N-
dimethylacetamide. Judged from some
of the 17 other N-substituted carboxa-
mides to be found among some 3900
Eastman Organic Chemicals we sell for
research, it is probably a swell solvent.
(Whether it dissolves Irtran-2 material,
nobody yet cares.)
Note: Whether you work for us or not,
photography in some form will probably
have a part in your work as years go on.
Now or later, feel free to ask for Kodak
literature or help on anything photographic.

Interview with General Electric's Dr. J. H. Hollomon
Manager—General Engineering Laboratory

Q. Dr. Hollomon, what characterizes
the new needs and wants of society?
A. There are four significant changes
in recent times that characterize these
needs and wants.
1. The increases in the number of
people who live in cities: the accom-
panying need is for adequate control
of air pollution, elimination of trans-
portation bottlenecks, slum clearance,
and adequate water resources.
2. The shift in our economy from agri-
culture and manufacturing to "serv-
ices": today less than half our working
population produces the food and goods
for the remainder. Education, health,
and recreation are new needs. They
require a new information technology
to eliminate the drudgery of routine
mental tasks as our electrical tech-
nology eliminated routine physical
drudgery.
3. The continued need for national
defense and for arms reduction: the
majority of our technical resources
is concerned with research and devel-
opment for military purposes. But
increasingly, we must look to new tech-
nical means for detection and control.
4. The arising expectations of the peo-
ples of the newly developing nations:
here the "haves" of our society must
provide the industry and the tools for the
"have-nots" of the new countries if they
are to share the advantages of mod-
ern technology. It is now clearly recog-
nized by all that Western technology is
capable of furnishing the material
goods of modern life to the billions
of people of the world rather than
only to the millions in the West.
We see in these new wants, prospects
for General Electric's future growth
and contribution.
Q. Could you give us some examples?
A. We are investigating techniques for
the control and measurement of air and
water pollution which will be appli-
cable not only to cities, but to individual
households. We have developed, for
Society Has New Needs
and Wants—Plan Your
Career Accordingly
DR. HOLLOMON is responsible for General Electric's centralized, advanced engineering
activities. He is also an adjunct professor of metallurgy at RPI, serves in advisory posts
for four universities, and is a member of the Technical Assistance panel of President
Kennedy's Scientific Advisory Committee. Long interested in emphasizing new areas of oppor-
tunity for engineers and scientists, the following highlights some of Dr. Hollomon's opinions.
example, new methods of purifying
salt water and specific techniques for
determining impurities in polluted air.
General Electric is increasing its inter-
national business by furnishing power
generating and transportation equip-
ment for Africa, South America, and
Southern Asia.
We are looking for other products
that would be helpful to these areas to
develop their economy and to improve
their way of life. We can develop new
information systems, new ways of stor-
ing and retrieving information, or
handling it in computers. We can
design new devices that do some of the
thinking functions of men, that will
make education more effective and per-
haps contribute substantially to reducing
the cost of medical treatment. We can
design new devices for more efficient
"paper handling" in the service
industries.
Q. If I want to be a part of this new
activity, how should I plan my career?
A. First of all, recognize that the
meeting of needs and wants of society
with products and services is most
important and satisfying work. Today
this activity requires not only knowl-
edge of science and technology but
also of economics, sociology and the
best of the past as learned from the
liberal arts. To do the engineering
involved requires, at least for young
men. the most varied experience possi-
ble. This means working at a number
of different jobs involving different
science and technology and different
products. This kind of experience for
engineers is one of the best means of
learning how to conceive and design
—how to be able to meet the changing
requirements of the times.
For scientists, look to those new fields
in biology, biophysics, information, and
power generation that afford the most
challenge in understanding the world
in which we live.
But above all else, the science explo-
sion of the last several decades means
that the tools you will use as an engi-
neer or as a scientist and the knowledge
involved will change during your life-
time. Thus, you must be in a position
to continue your education, either on
your own or in courses at universities
or in special courses sponsored by
the company for which you work.
Q. Does General Electric offer these
advantages to a young scientist or
engineer?
A. General Electric is a large diver-
sified company in which young men
have the opportunity of working on a
variety of problems with experienced
people at the forefront of science and
technology. There are a number of
laboratories where research and ad-
vanced development is and has been
traditional. The Company offers incen-
tives for graduate studies, as well as
a number of educational programs
with expert and experienced teachers.
Talk to your placement officers and
members of your faculty. I hope you
will plan to meet our representative
when he visits the campus.

Chemistry paints a bright future
The finish on new cars is as tough as it is beautiful. Chemicals
developed through research at Union Carbide have played an important part
in achieving smooth, hard mirror-bright coatings that last for years.
Chemicals and plastics have also caused a revolution in other types
of paints and finishes in recent years. The result? Water-base latex paints
that dry in minutes have turned a time-consuming chore into a simple job
for any homeowner. Special solvents assure the uniform surface required in
the finishing of fine furniture. And many new chemical materials are going
into coatings to safeguard industrial equipment from moisture and corrosive
fumes . . . and to protect ships from the ravages of salt water.
This is an example of a vital industry that has forged ahead
because of the kind of chemical research that goes on at Union Carbide.
Looking to the future, the people of Union Carbide are continuing their
efforts to bring forth new and better materials for everyday living.
Ybu will be interested in the
career opportunities available
with Union Carbide in carbons,
chemicals, gases, metals, plas-
tics,and nuclear energy. Why not

most out of a
job interview:
Every company that interviews col-
lege students is interested in hiring
students with high potential. But
matching the right man with the right
company is a complex assignment.
How can you know which company
you should join? You can't know for
sure, but you can get a reasonably
accurate indication if you make the
most of your campus interview. Be-
low are a few suggestions to assist you
in making such an interview with
Koppers more worthwhile and produc-
tive for you.
H Before the interview, stop in
your Placement Office and re-
view in some detail the literature
explaining Koppers diversified line
of products and services. Become
familiar with Koppers eight operat-
ing divisions and the particular con-
tribution each makes to industry.
|n| Try to determine as specifically
I—I as you can the type of work
that seems to interest you most.
Then question the interviewer as to
how that type of work fits into
Koppers many activities. If, like
many graduates, you find that your
interests cover many areas of work,
tell the interviewer. You'll find that
he will understand your problem
and may be of help in deciding on
the kind of "Koppers opportunity"
for which you would be best suited.
Be prepared to outline your
accomplishments. He will be in-
terested in your extra-curricular ac-
tivities as well as your scholastic
achievement. Point out any part-
time or summer experience which
you may have had. If you can effec-
tively communicate to the inter-
viewer your background and inter-
ests, both you and he will be better
able to decide whether or not this
is the right opportunity for you.
a Review with the interviewer
Koppers on-the-job training
program. This program is designed
to allow you to make an immediate
and recognizable contribution. You
go to work—you don't return to the
classroom for training. You will be
working on projects that will permit
you to apply the knowledge you have
gained through your college training,
while at the same time you will be
furthering your knowledge and un-
derstanding of your field.
SAsk the interviewer about job
location, military policy, educa-
tional assistance policy, and any
other questions which you may have
about the Company. He will be
happy to provide any information he
can to assist you in getting the most
from your Koppers interview.
If the possibility of a career with Koppers interests you, contact your Placement Office
and arrange to see the Koppers representative on his next visit to your campus.

EDUCATION AND INDUSTRY-
working together for the future
Put an engineer in an environment compatible
with his scientific interests and he is quite likely
to do great things and be happy about doing
them. That's the way it is at Detroit Edison,
whether it's on one of our long range develop-
ment programs, our day-to-day studies for
system improvements, or on our summer pro-
gram for engineering professors and students as
shown above.
Here Assistant Professor Aziz Fouad of Iowa
State University's Electrical Engineering
Department, University of Michigan student
Nicolas Spewock and Detroit Edison Senior
Engineer Ray Pillote examine a problem of
extra high voltage transmission, using the
THE DETROIT EDISON COMPANY
System Analogue and Network Computer.
There's very little precedent to draw on in the
area of 400 to 500 KV transmission voltage and
much remains to be clarified about system
design and integration, radio interference, line
losses, relays, operation and performance.
If you want to find out more about career
opportunities or our summer program, drop us

What is education?
This is one of those eternal, unanswerable questions. It has
been called the acquisition and utilization of knowledge. Ed-
ucation has been called life itself.
If the above definitions are accepted, living is the total
education process, which consists of the acquisition and utiliza-
tion of knowledge.
Consider first the utilization of knowledge. A person's work
is of primary importance for his own subsistence and for
society, which benefits from his productivity. Consider personal
satisfaction. One should enjoy his life's work. Cultural activities,
which broadly range from sports to great works, add to per-
sonal satisfaction. Service to others, family, community, and
nation, requires utilization of knowledge, and provides a feeling
of personal well-being.
Acquisition must precede utilization, but what should one
acquire? The frontiers of knowledge have been expanding
exponentially, thus one must be very selective in his pursuits
of knowledge. This problem of selection is, perhaps, the great-
est decision an individual makes in his lifetime, yet so often
very little thought is given to this matter.
This decision can be aided by two things. Analyze yourself.
Formulate goals. Self analysis is the most difficult, but is the
most imporant criterion affecting your decision. Ask yourself
two questions. How can I adjust my goals to suit my abilities
and deficiencies? How can I change my abilities and deficiencies
to meet my goals. These answers provide the answer to your
selection problem.
A good educational plan will provide the shortest path to
your goals. The plan includes textbook learning, learning to
live and work with other people, an appreciation of finer
things, and the ability to communicate.
The proper combination of the above must be selected to
reach your goals. A research chemist would want to devote
more time to books and less time to communication. An ad-
vertising man would have the opposite objectives. The goals
of soem educators is to produce well rounded persons. The
individual should decide on the degree of specialization or
diversification of his studies in the pursuit of his individual
goals.
Associations and professional societies, with their accom-
panying publications, the journals and technical magazines, are
of great value. They provide a source of information that can-

part of the total education process. They provide one part of
your education that is essential for many goals, the chance to
exercise your initiative and work with ideas and people.
Someone has said, "A college education is one of the few
things a person is willing to pay for and not get." The appal-
ling fact is that this statement is true. There are a large number
of students (if they can be called students), who seem to have
no purpose. They are going to school for lack of something
better to do. If you can formulate clear cut goals, you will be
motivated to work hard to reach those goals.

presently staff positions open. Tryout meetings will be held in
the latter part of this month. This is directed to second semester
freshmen who wanted a semester to get settled before partic-
ipating in an activity, although all students are urged to attend.
The Engineering Council is to be commended on its Faculty

• That's just what we did at Allison.
Studies indicated that the Fresnel prin-
ciple could be adapted to an extremely
lightweight, foldable solar collector for
operation of power systems.
Our researchers went to work, aided by
Allison's extensive resources—our physi-
cal optics and metallurgical laboratories,
American and European consultants, our
Scientific Advisory Board and every re-
source General Motors possesses.
Results—a Fresnel mirror which can
collect and concentrate solar energy to
run direct conversion systems, Stirling
cycle engines, Rankine cycle mercury tur-
bines, solar regenerated fuel cells and nu-
merous other devices which will provide
electric power for space missions.
Allison's solar reflector utilizes such
significant design characteristics as:
70% less weight than other solar re-
flectors capable of withstanding the rigors
of space for extended periods of time ...
Energy Conversion is Our Business
Strong enough to withstand the severe
stresses encountered in rocket blast-off

And this is but one example of Allison
technology at work. Current research in-
vestigations encompass four basic energy
conversion systems: open and closed cycle
gas turbines, Stirling-cycle engines, direct
energy conversion devices and rockets.
From this research into solar and nuclear
as well as chemical energy will develop
many of the primary and auxiliary power
systems of the future.
But concepts are constandy changing,
and Allison is ever probing new forms of
energy conversion in the search for im-
proved forms of propulsion and power.
And as the research devices of today be-
come the power systems of the future,
Allison will continue its history of pio-

Long lead time is essential to the
development of large nuclear

an impractical heat rejection surface
nearly the size of a football field for a
power output of one megawatt—power
which will be needed for critical space
missions already in the planning stage.

now completed the initial SPUR design
studies and proved the project's feasi-

power and low thrust electrical propul-
sion in space for long periods of time.
Cutting projected 1 MW power sys-
tems to l/10th the size and l/5th the
weight of present power systems under
development will be possible because
of SPUR's capability to operate at
higher temperatures, thereby sharply
reducing the required radiator area.
Garrett has been working with the

SCHOOL SENIORS
This issue of the TECHNIC is being sent to many of
the high schools in Michigan. Hopefully, the TECHNIC
will serve as an introduction to the educational activities
offered at the University. The articles herein exemplify
the never-ending search for understanding of man's en-
vironment and the ever-increasing effort to use his under-
standing to shape and control his environment. This
search for understanding and knowledge is the process of
education.
Unfortunately, most students never come to appreciate
the need for understanding. Too many plunge into four
years of hectic study, emerge with a degree and crash
head on with the brutal facts of life. They lead a daily
existence with their nose constantly to the grindstone,
never stopping to examine their accomplishments with
respect to their goals. Indeed, it seems, some even lack
goals.
For a person to succeed in any endeavor, he must
set certain goals for himself and strive towards them. This
is particularly true for the person just beginning to pur-
sue his higher education. For only if he keeps his eyes
straight ahead, focused on those goals, will he be able
to muster the determination and energy which will carry
him over the rough spots in the road leading to his de-
gree. And if he has chosen his goals wisely, he will not
lose sight of them; and success will come to him not only
during his formal education but throughout life.
During these times of rapid technological and social
change a particularly appropriate goal is the search for
understanding. The recognition and mastery of facts that
lead to the understanding of processes is important, but
even more important is the understanding of one's self
and his relationship to others and his environment.
Throughout your formal educational process, ask ques-
tions such as: What is my purpose and why am I here?
What is beauty? What is the mind? And other similar
questions that man has asked for centuries—yet they go
unanswered. You will find, for yourself, that such ques-
tions will never be answered, but the search will lead to
a finer appreciation for the many complexities of life.
You will take a step toward understanding such things
as human nature, the limits of man's knowledge, and the
workings of society.
This word "understanding" seems rather vague; you
may want us to be more precise. Unfortunately, we can-
not because the word defies definition. But ask yourself
the questions we mentioned, look for answers, and you
will discover what we mean. It is this search for under-
standing that leads us to realize how insignificant we are
and how little we know. It is the desire for understand-
ing that spurs curiosity which leads to discovery; and
it is understanding that is the mark of an educated man.

THE
CHALLENGE
by STEPHEN S. ATTWOOD,
Dean, College of Engineering,
Professor of Electrical Engineering

At the beginning of a new decade, two years ago, I suggested in the
TECHNIC that events in engineering and science in the 1960's might be
startling. Last year I pursued this as a challenge to the student. This year I shall
try to indicate what it means to accept this challenge.
I think of two individuals who received degrees in engineering in two
different schools in 1932. One says everything he learned is obsolete; the other
has continued to grow and uses his knowledge in the solution of real world
problems. The first was trained to do specific things; the other educated. The
first is bewildered; the second is enlightened.
The active participants in the development and military use of radar had
a basic background in mathematics, science, and engineering with a knowledge
of how to solve problems. They were not trained as radar engineers or opera-
tions analysts. In fact, those terms had not been conceived at the time the indi-
viduals were in college. Their careers have been adventures.
Technology is changing at an incredible rate, but it is being changed and
made useful to society by educated human beings, individuals who can write
as well as read, individuals who are not illiterate by neglect, either in mathe-
matics, science, humanities or social science. They are not experts in all areas
but excellent in some with an understanding of basic concepts in all; they are
educated; they are prepared to grow.
To prepare yourself to be useful, then, means you must have faith in your-
self, a desire for a real education and a willingness to acquire knowledge in
areas not necessarily of major interest to you at the present. This means self
discipline and hard work. Can you take it?

PERCEPTION
Everyone realizes that the mechanism of seeing
consists of the reception of light stimuli by the
retina of the eye and consequent transmission to
the brain. But no one understands how the stim-
uli is recognized as a distinct form.
by JASON GREENWILL
Nearly everyone has at sometime en-
countered the various popular optical
illusions such as the cube that changes
its orientation as one looks at it for
a prolonged time. Surely all are aware
of the fact that movies are nothing but
optical illusions. But how many people
stop to realize that these optical illu-
sions are just part of a higher or-
der phenomenon known as visual
perception?
This article does not deal with the
details of vision such as the transmis-
sion of stimuli from the retina through
the optical nerve to the brain, but with
the more subtle concepts of perception.
If one were to attack the subject in the
obvious fashion of first denning per-
ception, he would have a difficult time
because the word is not meant to de-
scribe a known process. When a psy-
chologist refers to perception he is not
sure what he is talking about.
It is a well known fact that light,
being a form of energy, acts as a stim-
ulus on the retina. But what is not
known is how this stimulus is trans-
lated into distances, directions, sizes,
and shapes. Something more than re-
ception of the stimuli must occur be-
fore certain parts of the mass separate
out from the rest and appear as a defi-
nite shape such as a straight line, an
angle, a square, or a circle.
Two questions come to mind when
considering perception: do the ele-
ments of a figure get together and
build up the whole image, or does the
whole image first register and then de-
generate to the elements which in turn
become impressed on the brain? Sec-
ondly, is perception of form a native
ability or is it acquired by learning?
Two Theories
Attempts to answer these questions
is provided by two schools of thought,
each proposing a theory of perception.
One school advances the "cell assem-
bly" idea where the basic postulate is
that experience is needed to develop
perception: a complete pattern is per-
ceived through the combination in the
brain of separate impressions that have
been established there and correspond
to various elements that have been pre-
viously learned. The second school is
the result of Wolfgang Kohler, the
founder of the Gestalt school of psy-
chology and professor of psychology at
Swarthmore College. The Gestalt the-
ory holds that perception is innately
determined; a pattern is perceived di-
rectly as a whole and without synthesis
of parts, a product of unlearned ca-
pacity to perceive form and organiza-
tion. There is no yes or no answer to
the validity of either of these theories;
experimental activities have produced
evidence in support of both.
Figure and Ground
Regardless of the ultimate mecha-
nism of perception, many experiments
have turned up common results. One
of these is the distinction between fig-
ure and ground. D. O. Hebb in his
book, The Organization of Behavior,
points out that primitive unity of a
figure is its simplest aspect. Even before
a figure is identified it is discriminated

is viewing an area, called the field,
which is composed of a white portion
and a black portion. These two por-
tions are so arranged that they meet
in a contour. From this point of view
either the black or the white could be
the figure. However, if one is com-
pletely surrounded by the other, the
one surrounded will be more easily
seen as the figure. But with practice,
the surrounding portion can be seen
as the figure. Furthermore, if the com-
mon contour separating the two is
nearly vertical, either can just as easily
be viewed as the figure, but when a
reversal is made, i.e. first one is viewed
as the figure then the other, the two
parts of the field appear very different
even though both shapes depend on
the same contour.

Either field could be considered the
figure, but the white field is more apt
to be seen as the ground because it
is the same color as the page.
In general, the distinguishing fea-
tures between ground and figure are:
(1) the figure has form, while the
ground is formless; (2) the ground
appears to extend continuously behind
the figure and not be interrupted by
the figure; (3) the figure has the char-
acteristics of a thing, while the ground
appears as a material; (4) the figure
appears to stand in front, the ground
behind; (5) the figure is more easily
remembered.
The above classification is the result
of the work of E. Rubin, a Swedish
psychologist who was active during the
first two decades of the 20th century.
The experiments of Rubin, using ir-
regular nonsense figures, lead to two
important discoveries: (1) figural per- or with extraneous letters can still be
sistence and (2) nonrecognition of the separated and read,

Figures Are Selected
Now that we have seen the distinc-
tion between figure and ground, an-
other question arises: how is a figure
constituted? Experiments have been
conducted utilizing patterns of dots
and observing which dots grouped
themselves into figures most readily.
The experiments revealed the follow-
ing criterion of a subject to select a
figure from a group of dots:
1. Nearness or proximity in the field
of view. Dots relatively close together
are readily seen as a group.
2. Sameness or similarity. Dots of the
same color or same shape are readily
seen as a group.
3. Common fate. Dots which move
simultaneously in the same direction
are readily seen as a group.
4. Good continuation or good figure.
The group follows a uniform direction
in some respect. Symmetry or balance
of the total figure is an important case.
5. Past experience or custom. The ex-
perience of an individual tends to per-
mit the selection of familiar groups or
patterns. Words printed without spaces
five conclusions, one may ask how is
a figure given character—that is how
can one identify figures? Other experi-
ments revealed that contour, propor-
tion and geometrical illusion all help.
Contour is a relatively abrupt change
of gradient in either brightness or col-
or. For example, a white figure on a
black ground with gradual sloping
edges that suddenly have a jag exhibits
contour. In dot figures contours change
with the grouping of the dots. Also
contours can change with the meaning
conveyed by the figure.
But although contour gives shape to
a figure, it cannot be said that the
shape is the contour. For example, jig-
saw puzzle fans know that the piece
need not look like the hole it fits in.
Here, the contour of the hole and
piece are the same, but the shapes are
different.
To describe a figure as square, ob-
long or thin is another means of char-
acterizing the object. Such adjectives
can be grouped under the heading pro-
portion. Experiments were conducted
that were aimed at determining wheth-
er shapes were as accurately perceived
18
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


a comparison of lengths in various di-
rections. The conclusion would be that
proportion is perceived at least as well
as length and is a primary character-
istic of shape.
Often errors occur in perception, such
as judging apparent length, area, di-
rection or curvature. In general, these
are errors in the perception of parts
of a figure and are incidental to the
perceived form of the whole figure.
But such errors are of great interest
....cause they offer clues to the over all
ertort to understand perception.
Stabilized Retinal Images
One of the difficulties encountered
in the investigation of perception is
the fact that the eye is in constant
motion. Even when the eye is fixed on
an object, small involuntary move-
ments persist causing the image to drift
on the retina. If the image can be sta-
bilized on the retina it soon fades and
disappears. D. O. Hebb, Woodburn
Heron and Roy M. Pritchard working
at McGill University have found that
the stabilized image regenerates after
a time and again becomes visible to
the subject in whole or in part. Over
prolonged periods of observation, the
image alternately fades and regener-
ates. The McGill group has found that
the alternate fading and regeneration
is related to the character and content
of the image itself.
Roy M. Pritchard was responsible
for the development of an apparatus
that stabilized the image on the retina.
The device was attached to a subject
and various objects projected on the
retina of the subject's eye. The experi-
ments consisted of the report of the
subject on the part of the object visible
to him. In general the group has found
that the image of a simple figure, such
as a single line, vanishes rapidly and
then reappears as a complete image.
A more complex target such as the
profile of a face, may similarly dis-
appear and reappear as a whole, or it
may vanish in fragments with one or
more of its parts fading independently.
The group also found that the length
of time an image persists is a function
of its complexity. A simple object may
be visible for only 10 per cent of the
total viewing time, whereas a complex
image may be visible in part for as
much as 80 per cent of the time.
Learning and Perception
The contrasting pattern in which an
image fades and regenerates has been
related to the role of learning in per-
ception. A form that is common, such
as a profile of a face, will fade and
regenerate in meaningful units. On the
other hand, an abstract curlicue will
at first fade very rapidly and regener-
ate with no particular pattern, but as
the subject becomes more familiar with
the curlicue and parts of it become
dominant, these parts then tend to ap-
pear and disappear as a unit. As the
parts of the curlicue become associated
as a group, they persist for longer
periods than other combinations and
the figure can no longer be considered
unorganized and meaningless.
Reversible contour.
From the experiments with stabilized
images, indications seem to point to
the fusion of the two general theories
of perception. As Pritchard points out,
perhaps they can be resolved much as
the two theories of physics concerning
the nature of light were resolved. Per-
haps the Gestalt perception-by-the-
whole theory can best be used in inter-
preting perception in a broad sense,
while the cell-assembly idea of percep-
tion by parts may turn out to be most
useful for analysis of perception in
detail.
Because we are limited by space and
because this article is intended as only
a very general introduction to the sub-
ject of perception, we cannot go into
details of other aspects of perception;
but we can mention some of the other
areas under current investigation.
One highly fascinating area is con-
cerned with the aftereffects in percep-
tion. These were first observed as an
incidental effect in the course of an
experiment conducted by J. J. Gibson
in 1933. He presented a slightly curved
line in a vertical position for a subject
to inspect steadily for 5-10 minutes. By
the end of the inspection period the
line appeared less curved than at first,
and when a straight vertical line was
presented, it appeared curved in the
opposite direction of the original
curved line. Certain optical illusions,
such as the cube that shifts orientation
as one looks at it for a time, are other
demonstrations of aftereffects. Investi-
gators have found that they are due
to special electrical phenomenon in the
brain and further study may lead to
a greater understanding of the per-
ceptual process.
Other areas of investigation are
depth perception, color perception, con-
trast, size and distance relationships,
and perception and location of objects
in space.
It is interesting to raise several ques-
tions. In the ultimate process of per-
ception in the brain, is there an intimate
connection among other sensory per-
ceptions such as smell, touch, and hear-
ing? And if there is, why is there such
a variance in perception with different
individuals? And are those with highly
developed perceptive senses those who
become prominent in esthetic endeav-
ors such as art and music? No one
knows the answers, but they certainly
deserve investigation.

SPA CE ■ SA VING
by MARTHA SNYDER
The maze of technical literature being
printed and the astounding rate of
growth of new technical publications
presents a formidable communication
barrier between various scientific and
engineering personnel. With the ever
increasing need for rapid and accurate
communication, grows the new "space
saving dialects." Consisting mainly of
abbreviations, the written dialects look
more like a psychological association
test than an intelligible message. But
once a person has mastered the new
"language," communication time and
a great deal of space can be saved.
The author of this article investi-
gates one of the more common appli-
cations of abbreviated dialect, but other
organizations, notably transportation
companies, large diversified corpora-
tions, and financial firms are beginning
to adopt the "space saving dialects" in
an effort to reduce errors caused by
inaccurate or late messages.
I don't know about you, but I feel
most ignorant and frustrated when
someone is conversing with me, and I
can't understand what the person is
trying to say. I felt this way during
my first day at the Weather Bureau.
Everywhere I turned, I was confronted
with more frustrations. I was sure either
I was an imbecile or the weathermen
didn't know how to talk properly. For-
tunately, by mastering their space-saving
dialect, I found that neither was the
case.
The thing that first stumped me that
morning was a form they handed me
that read: Snyder, GS-2 ST, rev Iwp
9-1-61 to 6-26-62, atnd si. What they
were saying, I found out later, was
that I was a Student Trainee with a
government status code 2 (or about
$1600 annual pay) and was to receive
leave without pay from September first
of 1961 to June twenty-sixth of 1962
for the purposes of attending school.
Simple?
When I was told I would work shift
D 13 hundred to 21 hundred Zulu, I
didn't know whether to laugh or cry.
I was relieved to find, however, this
meant I would be working a day shift
from eight in the morning until four
in the evening on weekdays (Zulu be-
ing Greenwich, England time, about
five hours ahead of Eastern Standard
Time).
By afternoon, they were showing me
the teletype receiving and transmitting
machines. It was then that I learned
the reason for many of the word con-
tractions and number codes. The less
space a message takes up, the quicker
it can be sent out and utilized. In
working with these contractions every
day, the weathermen had come to in-
corporate them in their speech.
I also learned that when a man is
transmitting "telcos" on the teletype
machine, he is sending a weather fore-
cast to the Bell Telephone Company.
The three mysterious letters "CKT"
printed on each teletype receiver stood
for the word circuit. Also, when the
forecasters talked about DTW, YIP,
MKC and DET, they weren't spouting
the alphabet. Rather, they were speak-
ing about the other weather stations
respectively: Detroit Metropolitan
Wayne County Airport, Willow Run
Airport at Ypsilanti, Kansas City Cen-
tral Office, and Detroit City Airport
Weather Bureau Station.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


"Pibals" remind me of intoxicating
beverages. Actually, they are a type of
weather report called "pilot balloon
report." In addition to this type, there
are raobs, uw's, rareps, ua's and pireps.
They represent radar observation re-
ports, upper wind reports, radiosonde
reports, upper air data reports, and
pilot reports respectively.
By late afternoon, I thought I was
catching on to the dialect quite well
until a technician came running in joy-
ously exclaiming, "The WSR-57 is on
its way!" The men shook hands and
shouted with glee. I would have liked
to join in, but I really didn't know
whether a WSR was a "washer" or a
"weak signal from Russia." As it
turned out, WSR-57 was a new model
radar console designed specifically for
meteorological observations. It was
something the men had wanted for two
years, and it was finally going to be
installed at our station.
About three o'clock, they showed me
the "weban." The word brings to
mind a picture of a small brass en-
semble, but actually a weban is a
Weather Bureau Aviation observation
form (abbreviated WBAN). On this
form there appeared such puzzling
combinations of consonants as vsby,
tivr, rnwy, and cmnb. They stood for
the words visibility, tower, runway, and
cumulo-nimbus clouds. Then there were
combinations of consonants and vowels
like aprng and binovc. One might guess
that aprng means approaching (front
or cloud bank), but binovc sounds like
the name of a computer. Really, binovc
is a beautiful example of the space-
saving dialect representing the phrase
"breaks in the overcast layers of
clouds."
Most of these written contractions
were altered slightly by adding a
vowel here and there to make them
speakable. For instance, vsby was pro-
nounced visby, and binovc was pro-
nounced binovac.
One afternoon I invited a friend to
the Bureau. He works at the Wayne
State University Computer Laboratory
in downtown Detroit. I was glad to
have the opportunity to show him the
marvelous equipment we had and to
try out my new dialect on him. "How
would you like to take a raob with me,
Art?" I asked enthusiastically. His
face lit up, and he answered excitedly,
"Oh, that sounds great!" Then his face
clouded, and he added cautiously, "I
think."
I guess I teased him like that all af-
ternoon, but I knew he wasn't going
to let my teasing go unchecked. So
when he invited me to visit the com-
puter lab the next week, I knew he was
planning his revenge. "Which would
you like to see first, Martha," he said,
"ramac, the 543, or the 544?"
"Oh, I'm not particular," I said in
an attempt to conceal my ignorance.
He laughed and took me into a glassed-
in room full of blinking lights, ro-
tating discs, and rhythmic purring
sounds. "This is ramac," he said point-
ing to a huge humming cabinet with
a window in it. He explained that ram-
ac is the storage unit of the computer
and (in brief) functions by applying
the binary number system to electro-
magnetic principles on the 50 discs
stacked like records within. The 543
and 544 turned out to be the input
machine that reads the program and
the output machine that punches out
the answers.
I made the unfortunate mistake of
asking how the programmer changed
his word problems into terms that the
computer could understand. Other pro-
grammers gathered around and ex-
plained to me that they used many
"languages" in their work. The type
of language used depended on the type
of problem they worked with. One fel-
low said he used Tass, or Technical
Assembly System. Another used For-
tran, or Formula Translator. Yet an-
other said he used Gate, an algebraic
compiler language. "And what do you
use, Art?" I questioned. "Soap," was
his reply.
"That's nice," I heard myself say,
and I could tell by his grin that the
mixed emotions: insult, wonder, and
puzzlement showed on my face. It
seemed to me a strange thing to brag
about, using soap! Soap, I found out
later, stood for Symbolic Optimal As-
sembly Programmer.
I learned many things from this
small-scale cultural exchange. But the
thing that impressed me most was how
foreign the language of one field of
work is to another. At most univer-
sities, computer training and meteor-
ology might both be classified under
engineering. Yet how foreign to each
other their space-saving dialects have
made them! And when one takes into
consideration how many other divi-
sions of engineering there are, and add
to these the many other fields like med-
icine, law, music, the arts, and indus-
try, it becomes evident why working
men have had to become specialists
and why they have difficulty in com-
municating their ideas to one another.

EFFECTS of R. F.
New evidence indicates that life may be affected
in unusual ways by radio frequency waves. How-
ever, much more research must be done before
any positive conclusions can be reached.
by PAUL NIFFENEGGER
In the past decade we have literally
jammed the airways with radio and tel-
evision signals, and no serious thought
has been given to their effects on life—
in fact, their safety has been taken for
granted. Considering man's life and
well-being could be at stake if danger
is present, isn't man being too com-
placent?
To fully answer this question and
account for its consequences, man must
thoroughly investigate the effects of
radio frequency energy (r.f.) by first
performing experiments on animals
other than those of the human specie.
He must also examine the cell and find
its mode of construction to explain and
predict any effects r.f. does have on
life. This may be done by noting the
electro-chemical nature of cells.
The Electrical Nature of Cells
Life, as man knows it. is electrical
in nature. Living cells, their nuclei
and protoplasm, are composed of mol-
ecules formed by individual atoms that
are linked by electric charges. Cellular
fluids can conduct an electric current
because of the presence of ions; and
cells can be affected by electric forces.
Knowledge of these phenomena has
been applied in brain studies to invoke
mental, hormonal, and emotional re-
sponses with electromagnetism, in the
separation of different types of cells
with electric currents, and in the search
of a cancer cure. On this basis it is also
safe to assume other forms of energy
that possess electrical qualities can also
affect life; namely, radiant energy.
Nature of Radiant Energy
Radiant energy is a comprehensive
term and covers such forms of energy
as light, microwaves, radio waves, X-
rays, and gamma rays. It is produced
when matter is converted from one
form to another, as in the case of the
sun; it travels in straight lines at
186,000 miles per second. Generally
speaking, it has great penetrating pow-
er because it has no charge. Radiant
energy is characterized by electric and
magnetic fields and is sometimes called
electromagnetic radiation. The propa-
gation of radiant energy through space
in the form of waves or pulses is called
radiation.
Life on earth is sustained by radiant
energy. Light supplies the energy nec-
essary to form and break organic mol-
ecules in plants or makes photosynthe-
sis possible. It is ultraviolet rays which
tan the skin and infrared rays which
cook foods.
Further up the electromagnetic spec-
trum are X-rays which have stronger
electromagnetic fields than their neigh-
bors lower in frequency. Like ultra-
violet radiation, they are hazardous if
misused. The hazard lies in their ability
to produce ionizing radiation. Radio
frequency energy, light, and other
forms of radiant energy with a longer
wavelength can also produce ionizing
radiation, but to a lesser degree. This
ability to produce ions results in the
breaking of chemical bonds.
Biological Effects of Radiant Energy
It is the interaction of the strong
electrical forces of these waves with
cells that can result in sterility in plants
and animals, affect the genes by sever-
ing them and permitting them to heal
in a random nature, shorten the life
span through cellular destruction, cause
certain types of cancer, and damage
the lungs, heart, kidneys, large bowel,
eyes, and spinal cord. And it is no
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Hollaender and George E. Stapleton
aptly put it:
The processes of life involve a
relatively low turnover of energy
and a high degree of self-regulat-
ing harmony. In contrast, ionizing
radiation conveys huge packets of
energy and, upon interaction with
living matter, provokes anarchy A
If life can be affected by these forms
of radiant energy, then doesn't it seem
probable that r.f. can affect life, too?
Does it make much difference if a
soldier is hit by a three-inch shell or
a ten-inch shell? The effects of high-
frequency energy and r.f. are analogous.
There are several similarities and an
important difference between X-rays
and r.f. First, X-rays and r.f. can pro-
duce a temperature rise in tissues which
will result in death in extreme cases,
and thermal cellular damage in milder
ones. Second, repeated small doses of
radiation are often more dangerous
than a large continuous dose, though
harmful effects are almost always pro-
duced in both cases. However, X-ray
energy is cumulative whereas r.f. is not.
At the high end of the radio spec-
trum, or frequencies above 3000 mc
(3000 million cycles per second), some
of the radiation is absorbed on the
surface flesh and the remainder is re-
flected. Since the skin layers have good
heat dissipation and respond quite rap-
idly to temperature increases or de-
creases, signaling the brain quickly,
radiation absorbed in this range does
not present too great a problem as the
subject will probably move away from
the source.
Another range in which the hazard
becomes quite evident is between 1000
mc and 3000 mc. Though these rays
may penetrate to the lower skin fat
and muscle layers, the irradiated sub-
ject would feel the heat on the skin
very shortly after exposure if in a high-
power field; and if he immediately
moved away, would probably avoid
any serious effects.
It is interesting to note that radia-
tion between 200 mc and 1000 mc, the
1. Alexander Hollaender and George E.
Stapleton, "Ionizing Radiation and the Liv-
ing Cell," Scientific American (September,
1959), p. 95.
range used in radar and aircraft com-
munication equipment, is considered
potentially the most dangerous! Upon
being absorbed by matter, it produces
localized heating; and this is generally
considered to be its greatest hazard.
However, experiments definitely show
there are other hazards in this fre-
quency range and at other frequencies
which can be just as dangerous!
Research by various organizations
has proven that r.f. radiation, espe-
cially in the microwave (radar) region,
causes harmful effects by heating cer-
tain portions of the body and causing
hyperthermia (excessive internal tem-
perature). Organs which do not read-
ily dissipate heat, as the lungs, eyes,
testes, gall bladder, the large intestine,
and other hollow organs, are especially
susceptible to the heating effects of
radiation. As deep-heating waves (1000
mc and below) can heat these organs
and also deep muscle tissue, completely
penetrating the skin and outer fat lay-
ers, the brain cannot be easily warned
of the impending danger by the nerves;
and by the time heat can be felt, it is
more than often too late.
American Research
Because our country uses radar
beams with a pulsed power of over
1,000,000 watts, compared with about
45,000 watts in 1949, and because a
California radar technician died after
being exposed to high-power micro-
waves in 1957, the Air Force is con-
ducting a series of experiments at
various colleges across the nation to
find the effects radar and other fre-
quencies can cause on animals and hu-
mans. Research has also been spurred
because several past experiments with
mice and other small animals revealed
no effects other than thermal. For ex-
ample, experiments performed by Sid-
ney I. Brody, Commander (MC), U. S.
Navy, in 1953 showed that a 3,000-
watt field could kill rabbits almost in-
stantly with a 75-second exposure, and
that rats died after only a 22-second
exposure. In every case heat paralyzed
the respiratory centers to cause death.
Similar experiments with mice and
other animals were performed by oth-
ers with the same net results.
Some recent experiments with yeast
cells and insects, under the direction of
Professor Charles Susskind at the Uni-
versity of California, revealed some in-
triguing results besides thermal effects,
though. When ants were exposed to a
3-cm field (radar wavelength) they
aligned their antennas parallel to the
field, apparently to minimize the
effects!
Somewhat similar results were ob-
tained by biologist Dr. John H. Heller
of the New England Institute for Med-
ical Research. Convinced that the Cal-
ifornia technician's death was caused
by effects other than thermal, he began
to experiment on paramecia. He found
that paramecia and any asymmetrical
particle similar in size would line up
parallel to a 27 mc field—a frequency
used in everyday radio-control equip-
ment, and hundreds of megacycles be-
low the frequency used in the ant
experiments. He further found that the
chromosomes in garlic cells would un-
tangle and be forced into new align-
ments, rendering the plants sterile. The
transmitter was pulsed on and off 80-
180 times a second to prevent heating
the specimens. He said concerning this
experiment, as quoted in Science News
Letter, "In a larger immobilized micro-
organism we were able to observe in-
tracellular orientation of subcellar
particles. This led us to believe that
this force might be used as a powerful
and controlled mutagenic agent."2
Hugh Fleming, at Oregon State Col-
lege, found the growth of micro-
organisms would continue to increase
up to a certain intensity, and with the
application of more power would then
begin to decrease in a series of experi-
ments he performed. He used frequen-
cies from 30 to 270 mc. He noticed
the time of exposure and conductivity
of the solutions in which the organisms
were suspended proved important vari-
ables in the experiment. His work was
similar to Dr. Heller's, except that the
latter showed waves below 50 mc mark-
edly agitated living cells, while the
former concentrated more on effects on
growth.
A stark example of what effect radio
frequency energy can have on larger an-
imals was demonstrated by Dr. Pearce
Bailey of the National Institute of

Letter (April 11, 1959), p. 229.

Maryland. He experimented on twenty
Rhesus monkeys, successively placing
their heads under a copper screen cav-
ity connected to a commercial 100-watt,
388 mc, aircraft transmitter. When the
power was switched on, the monkey
became drowsy, then aroused, alert,
and agitated. Quoted in Radio-
Electronics, he said further:
Then in another minute or more
there appeared unmistakable signs
of some impending disturbance in
the vital centers of the monkey's
brain, which were probably res-
onating with these electromagnetic
waves. His nose became red, his
skin was pallid, and an anxious
look dominated his eyes.
He grimaced and smacked his
lips, his eyelids began to quiver
and (his eyes) developed a rapid,
vertical motion . . . (and were)
widely dilated. His respirations
became more and more irregular,
he began to salivate and suddenly
was thrown into a major convul-
sion a few seconds before his
death, his life having been extin-
guished like the snap of a light
of a light bulb.3
Foreign Research
The foundation work for finding the
effects of r.f. on humans was done
more than 35 years ago; and most of
it, in other nations. In 1930, Nrunori
claimed he had evidence that humans
"radiate" and "react to" radio waves
of the frequencies 129, 258, 387, and
596 mc. Even further back, Cazzamalli,
an Italian university professor, did
some experiments with humans,
yielding some startling information.
With a high-frequency radio beamed
at them, he recorded evidence of a
"beat" with crude but sensitive instru-
ments.4 These "beats" changed as the
subjects thought, or were aroused emo-
tionally. The subjects were placed in
a shielded room to prevent any outside
radio interference. In subsequent ex-
periments they hallucinated under fre-
quencies up to 300 mc.
3. "Lethal Radio Waves," Radio-Electron-
ics (August, 1959), p. 29.
4. Note: The "beat" is due to the inter-
ference of waves of slightly different fre-
quency, showing that the brain "radiated"
waves of its own.
These and the previously cited mon-
key experiments gave researchers rea-
son to believe that effects other than
thermal were occurring. Therefore, the
Cazzamalli experiments were duplicated
with precision equipment. A very low
power oscillator (in the milliwatt
range) was used, while Cazzamalli
probably used a higher wattage source.
The subjects were placed several feet
from the transmitter. As the tuning
dial was swept between 380 and 500
mc, the subjects indicated a point when
they felt anything unusual. With un-
believable accuracy the same point was
noted correctly every time. At the fre-
quency they indicated, they reported a
pulsing in the brain, ringing in the
ears, and a desire to bite the nearest
experimenter.
Others also partook in experiments
similar to Cazzamalli's. While trying
to find the effects of radiation on ma-
lignant growths, W. A. G. Van Ever-
dingen, a Dutch scientist, discovered
that radiation in the 1875-3000 mc
range affected the heartbeat of chicken
embryos by molecular resonance and
changed the optical properties of gly-
cogen, which is found in chicken em-
bryos and supplies human muscles with
energy. By extracting irradiated and
optically "pure" glycogen from tumor-
producing mice and injecting it into
mice with malignant tumors, he was
able to halt tumor growth as long as
the mice were kept on a diet free of
animal fats; otherwise, the fats seemed
to promote tumor growth. Without in-
jecting glycogen, Van Everdingen was
able to promote tumor growth with
this radiation and the proper diet, too.
He felt the viscosity of the mediums
used in these tests was an unquestion-
ably important variable.
Another important pioneer who dis-
covered vital facts concerning the
effects of radiation on life was a
Frenchman named Lakhovsky. Several
years before Van Everdingen, he
claimed in his book, The Secret of Life,
to have removed tumors from humans
(who so attested) with high frequency
radiation.
Russian Experiments
To date, the Russians have pub-
lished more on this topic than any
other country. A Russian biophysicist
named N. N. Livshits surveyed the
work of some fellow comrades in Bio-
fisica, the Russian biophysics journal.
All the experiments he reviewed were
done by 1958 and 1959. Some of the
more important effects they found are:
a uhf (300-3000 mc) field could in-
hibit the cortex resulting in the inhi-
bition of conditioned reflexes; the
retina of the eye could be made more
sensitive (up to 100 per cent) at the
expense of a reduced area of color
sensitivity; short exposures to uhf
would aid the regrowth of severed
nerve tissue while continued exposure
suppressed regrowth; an intense uhf
field can have a very painful effect on
the nerves;-1"' and ultrahigh frequencies
can increase the secretion of digestive
juices in the stomach, and decrease it
if stimulative drugs are simultaneously
given.
What effects r.f. can assail life with
have been presented. But it must be
remembered that man has a superior
heat regulating system and is able to
tolerate most temperature extremes,
and damaged cells usually recover to
a certain degree. Any destruction
wrought will depend upon the inten-
sity of the radiation the subject re-
ceives, the frequency, the length of
exposure, and the absorptive properties
of the body. However, as Van Ever-
dingen, Dr. Bailey, and Dr. Heller
believed, molecular resonance is prob-
ably the reason that unfavorable effects
sometime result with low power radia-
tion; and evidence seems to illustrate
that the susceptibility is not limited to
one specific frequency or to a certain
intensity.
All the effects sustained by animals
and humans in these experiments oc-
curred under laboratory conditions.
Therefore, it is safe to assume that the
amount of radiation people ordinarily
receive is probably no more deadly
than the steady drip of water on a
man's forehead—but the latter was ef-
fectively used by medieval torturers to
drive him insane. In light of what has
been found though, shouldn't man
thoroughly appraise his indiscriminate
use of r.f. energy before he spews more
radiation into the atmosphere?
5. Note: A mild uhf field reduces pain
and is used across the world to help give
relief to people suffering from painful dis-
eases, as arthritis..

Adhesives
Clothing without stitches, houses
without nails, and airplanes without
rivets—these are among the possibil-
ities foreseen by a University of Mich-
igan expert on adhesives.
Alan A. Marra, professor of wood
technology at the U-M, says strong,
new adhesives will be increasingly sub-
stituted for nails, screws, rivets and
other fasteners now in common use.
The fastening together of materials
by the use of adhesives is rapidly be-
coming the preferred means of assem-
bling many constructions because of
the great strength and rigidity that
can be obtained, and also because the
newer adhesives perform adequately in
high speed, mechanized factory
operations.
The use of adhesives in plywood,
furniture, toys and paper cartons is
leading the way to their use in fabri-
cating houses, aircraft, boats and
missiles.
Few realize, that the performance of
helicopter blades, the Atlantic cable,
safety glass, nylon cords in rubber
tires, brake shoes in cars, and non-
magnetic mine sweepers is due to the
adhesives with which they are
assembled.
The increasing substitution of ad-
hesives for nails, screws, stitching and
rivets will result in more efficient de-
signs and production methods for many
common articles of manufacture.
The quality of adhesives used in the
many different kinds of constructions
that exist will be assured in large
measure by test methods developed in
the ASTM Committee on Adhesives.
Conductron Corporation
An electronics company which will
produce a new material with "unique
electrical characteristics" is being lo-
cated in Ann Arbor.
U-M President Harlan Hatcher re-
ported that the firm, the Conductron
Corporation, will engage in research
on, and the development and produc-
tion of, certain semi-conducting and
ferrite materials. These materials have
"strange new properties" and were dis-
covered by U-M scientists engaged in
lunar research.
Conductron is a new subsidiary of
Paramount Pictures' Autometric Cor-
poration. Conductron's main office will
be in New York City, but research and
production will be carried on in Ann
Arbor.
President of Conductron is Keeve M.
Siegel, professor of electrical engineer-
ing at the U-M and head of its Radia-
tion Laboratory.
Professor Siegel said the firm has
leased 4500 square feet of office space
in downtown Ann Arbor, and is seek-
ing a production facility of 10,000 to
20,000 square feet. Production will be-
gin as soon as possible after space is
found, and will employ a minimum of
100 persons at the start. Conductron
hopes to turn to the University for
many hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of research each year. This work
would be aimed at the development of
electronic devices to perform specific
electronic operations.
In time, a large new production di-
vision, employing several hundred per-
sons, will be built in the United States.
The Ann Arbor area is not ruled out
as a possible location.

of the new materials came when Radi-
ation Laboratory personnel tried to du-
plicate materials which might be found
on the moon. Radiation Laboratory
workers involved in the experimental
work were Ralph Hiatt, Prof. Andrejs
Olte, and Eugene Knott. Engaged in
theoretical studies were Dr. T. B. A.
Senior, William Fensler, and Prof.
Siegel. Key employees of the Conduc-
tron Corporation include Professor
Dale M. Grimes and Dr. Weston E.
Vivian of the U-M, Professor Robert
Machol of Purdue, and Owen L. Suth-
erland, a Signal Corps contract admin-
istrator.
An independent organization would
have to spend $100 million annually
to match the volume and quality of
research now conducted at The Uni-
versity of Michigan.
In the past decade, research expendi-
tures have increased five-fold, rising
from $5 million in 1950 to more than
$25 million last year. The increase has
been almost geometric, and it has not
reached its maximum. Most of this
growth has been financed by the fed-
eral government, which spent $20 mil-
lion at the U-M last year. Of this
total, two-thirds came from the De-
partment of Defense. In addition, foun-
dations and other private sources spent
$1,350,000, industry $1,100,000, and
the University $1,850,000 from endow-
ment funds and gifts.
At least a thousand members of our
faculty are involved in research in all
areas, both scientific and non-scientific,
and 2,000 students were employed part-
time as research assistants last year.
When funds spent on the library
system, research supplies and equip-
ment, plant maintenance, and adminis-
trative costs are taken into account,
about $38 million of the University's
total budget of $100 million represents
identifiable research costs. Federal
money for the support of research has
been steadily increasing and there is
every indication that it will continue
to increase.
In his own field—physics—96 per
cent of all research in American uni-
versities comes from the federal gov-
ernment. In medicine, the proportion
is approximately 50 per cent.

Duncan E. McVean testing his rising sphere rheometer.
Shake-up Machine
A University of Michigan graduate
student has developed a $2.65 gadget
which may someday take the "shake
well'' labels off of the nation's medi-
cine bottles.
The secret is "strain," the force
which medicinal particles exert on a
liquid suspension. With too much
strain, the particles settle to the bottom
of the bottle—with less, they float.
Duncan E. McVean, 25, (Pontiac,
Mich.) a graduate student in the U-M
College of Pharmacy, developed the
gadget from platinum wire and a %-
inch ball bearing. He calls it a Rising
Sphere Rheometer. The Rheometer,
drawn slowly through the liquid being
tested, is capable of measurements 1-
million times finer than present instru-
ments costing as much as $16,000.
Pharmacists have long faced the
problem of suspending various medi-
cines in liquid to make sure the patient
received the prescribed amount of the
drug in each spoonful.
Testimony to their failure is seen
in millions of labels urging the patient
to "shake well before using." Shaking
simply stirs up the various ingredients
of the tonic into fairly uniform distri-
bution. The Rheometer represents
about two months of trial-and-error
until "it just worked."
The process is slow, McVean ad-
mits. Testing a single liquid takes
about two and one-half hours as com-
pared to the one and one-half minutes
customarily needed by more elaborate
and expensive equipment. And al-
though the actual materials used in the
Rheometer cost $2.65, the recording
devices cost about $3,000.

Distmguished from that which has prac-
tical application, pure research is con-
cerned with the discovery of fundamental
knowledge to widen man's understanding
of himself and the universe.
Ford Motor Company's Scientific Labora-
tory in Dearborn, Michigan is dedicated
to the pursuit of knowledge in the physical
sciences. On its staff are scientists of
national and international reputation who
conduct independent basic research pro-
grams of an extremely broad nature.
Why does Ford Motor Company support
research which seemingly is unrelated to
the manufacture of its products?
It is our view, and a pioneering concept
in our industry, that entirely new ap-
proaches to automotive development can
come only from unhampered scientific
investigation. Deeper understanding of
matter itself, and of the conversion and
storage of energy—aside from widening
man's primary knowledge—may have
practical application in tomorrow's vehicle
design.
Thus knowledge wrested from nature by
scientists will be taken by technologists
and applied to serve practical needs and
desires. Another example of Ford's leader-

FORGED...
to provide more strength at 60% less cost
You are looking at a simple forging. It will be
machined slightly to make a rotor end-plate for a
giant hydroelectric generator. This part must
withstand radial loadings of 150,000 pounds on
the coil-support surface as the 30-foot rotor spins.
Why use forgings for generator end-plates? Be-
cause forgings possess many special properties.
The forging process is unlike any other, because
forged parts start with refined metals, can be given
almost any desired shape between impression dies
under enormous pressure or by consecutive blows.
Forging imparts added strength and toughness,
permitting weight-saving design, reduced cost,
greater safety in our high-speed world.
Continuing research and modern equipment of
the forging industry have a major part in helping
extend the ability of metals to withstand the ever-
increasing stresses and temperatures and pressures
created by today's dynamic civilization. Forged
parts withstand the landing impact of a jet air-
craft, yet are light and strong to reduce dead
weight. Forged parts help restrain the tremendous
pressures and temperatures of modern petrochemi-
cal equipment. They improve the performance of
vital automobile components.
Forging has reduced the cost of many parts, too.
Production developments in the forging industry
often make forged parts cheaper than parts pro-
duced by other methods. Let us send you case
histories of parts converted to forgings from higher
cost methods. Address: Drop Forging Association,

Tau Beta Pi Essay:
the complete spectrum
* l' ju '■ -J • I "'•■• .J .**!•' *
The winning Tau Beta Pi Pledge
essay finds another student de-
fending the inclusion of more
non-technical subjects in the en-
gineering curriculum.
To the endless debate over the role
of the non-technical in the engineer's
education, I wish to add my views. I
am very much in favor of a strong em-
phasis upon the non-technical studies.
The often-quoted twenty per cent fig-
ure I regard as, at most, a lower limit
to the proportion of the curriculum
time which should be devoted to the
humanities and social sciences. Some
of my reasons for these beliefs follow.
One important reason for broaden-
ing course selections is the desirability
of extending the engineer's intellectual
horizons. The scope of intellectual en-
deavor is vast indeed—encompassing
areas as widely varied as history, lan-
guage, political science and psychology.
Of this broad spectrum, science and
technology comprise only a small seg-
ment. To obtain a measure of intellec-
tual perspective and depth, therefore,
it is essential that the engineer have
an introductory acquaintance at least
with all the major areas of academic
endeavor. His goal should be to de-
velop the whole intellectual self, and
not merely the technical side. This
development will ultimately make life
much more satisfying and rewarding
for him.
Moreover, a familiarity with non-
technical concepts and discoveries will
oftentimes be of direct or indirect prac-
tical value to the engineer on the job.
Virtually every job which the engineer
may hold involves dealing with others,
a knowledge of economics to some
extent, an understanding of our soci-
ety, and facility with our language
(and perhaps others as well). In the
course of his work, he will come in
by ROBERT RUHL
contact fairly often with persons en-
gaged in non-technical positions and
he must be able to understand what
they represent and be able to commu-
nicate intelligently with them. A good
acquaintance with the humanities and
social sciences will, indeed, be a great
help to the engineer, often in ways he
won't even realize.
Another reason for studying as much
as possible about the non-technical as-
pects of intellectual accomplishment is
the social-family factor. In social con-
versations with neighbors and friends,
it is invaluable to be acquainted with
the humanities and social sciences, for
most topics of social and casual con-
versation center around these topics.
Many intellectual discussions in which
the engineer may become involved will
be based on or require an understand-
ing of humanities. Likewise, in the
education of his children a broad in-
tellectual background will be a tremen-
dous asset as he tries to give them an
appreciation and acquaintance with all
phases of intellectual life.
A familiarity with the complete spec-
trum of knowledge will also lead to a
greater understanding and appreciation
of literature, drama, and the fine arts.
A greater understanding and apprecia-
tion of the arts will, in turn, lead to a
distinct enrichment of the engineer's
life as the beauty and intelligence of
great works and literature become a
part of him.
Courses in social sciences serve an-
other basic need: the need to under-
stand the political events on the local,
national, and international scene. With-
out some college-level knowledge of

Peter R. Schulz (B.S. in M. E., Lehigh University '58) is a
project engineer in the Manufacturing Research Laboratory
where he's developing new techniques to improve manu-
facturing.
HE PUTS RESEARCH TO WORK
ON THE PRODUCTION LINE

""**
Examining new phenomena in cryogenics, optics, informa-
tion theory, data communications and photochemistry, IBM
research engineers and scientists are developing new con-
cepts for information processing.
Some of these developments have a far-reaching, funda-
mental influence on basic knowledge, while others may
have a more immediate application to actual problems.
Where technological advances have a specific bearing on
data processing needs, they must be considered for appli-
cation in manufacturing. At IBM, that's a job for Manufac-
turing Research.
As a project engineer, Peter R. Schulz has found Manufac-
turing Research a challenging and rewarding assignment.
Translating today's scientific discoveries to meet tomor-
row's production line needs is an important step in creat-
ing exciting new products. It requires imagination and
ability to put new techniques, equipment and processes to
work on the production line.
At IBM, Manufacturing Research is an area of activity that
provides as much room for professional growth and ad-
vancement as the engineer is ready for. In his three years
with the company, for example, Peter Schulz has already
received three promotions to reach his present position of
responsibility. But no matter what your field of interest may
be, IBM facilities and professional guidance provide plenty
of backing for building a rewarding career.
The IBM representative will be interviewing on your campus
this year. He will be glad to discuss with you the many
challenging jobsthat are open at IBM—in development engi-
neering, research, manufacturing research, programming
or systems engineering. Your placement officer can supply
information and make an appointment for you. All qualified
candidates will receive consideration for employment with-
out regard to race, creed, color or national origin. If you
prefer, you may write, outlining your background and in-
terests, to:

Optical Tracking: An optical system
which directs light towards prescribed
tracking stations is being used to track,
through photographs, the Titan missile.
Key to the system is a specially-
designed glass refractor, mounted on
the side on the 98-foot rocket, which
beams light on specific points in the
missile's downrange course. The light,
flashed at half-second intervals by a
22 million peak candlepower Xenon
lamp, is photographed from the sta-
tions by special ballistic cameras. Pho-
tographic tracking provides precise
information on the Titan's speed and
position.
The glass used in the refractor is
a borosilicate glass which is easily
formed, hard and heat resistant. It is
tempered for greater strength.

operating optical maser—a device po-
tentially capable of carrying vast num-
bers of telephone calls and television
programs—has been demonstrated.
The new optical maser, operating on
less power than an ordinary light bulb,
continuously generates a coherent beam
of infrared light. This beam, several
hundred thousand times narrower in
frequency, or purer in color, than any
other light source, promises to be one
of the most efficient information car-
riers ever conceived. Even with exist-
ing communication techniques, large
amounts of information can be carried
by the beam. With improved tech-
niques under investigation, its capacity
could be increased many, many times.
In addition, the new maser will pro-
vide scientists with a powerful tool for
the study of the atom and its structure.
The optical gas maser—an approach
to light amplification entirely different
from solid state masers—was the re-
sult of a "planned scientific discovery."
It was invented by Bell scientist, A.
Javan, and described in a scientific
publication in July, 1959.
The new maser uses a mixture of
helium and neon gas to achieve con-
tinuous operation. Previous optical ma-
sers— built around crystals—required
thousands, even millions of watts of
power to transmit large bursts of vis-
ible light of very short duration. The
term "maser" is an acronym for "mi-
crowave amplification by stimulated
emission of radiation." Basically, a
maser is a highly effective device for
amplifying electromagnetic waves like
light and radio signals.
Light waves vibrate millions of times
faster than radio waves. Because these
"optical" frequencies are so high, light
beams should be capable of handling

enormous amounts of information—tel-
ephone calls, TV programs, data mes-
sages ... by the millions.
But the light must be coherent. It
is the coherence of radio waves, for
example, that enables them to carry
voice, music, television and other forms
of intelligence efficiently. Radio waves

Grinnell and Westinghouse engineers hydrostatically test piping for Westinghouse nuclear reactors
Grinnell prefabricated pressure vessels maintain
environmental conditions in Westinghouse test loops
This torpedo-shaped vessel, which is made of centrifugally
cast stainless steel pipe, will play a vital role during nuclear
research reactor experiments at Westinghouse. Its job —
maintaining the desired pressure in a high temperature,
high pressure in-pile test loop.
These in-pile loops required the exacting fabrication
skills and equipment available in Grinnell's extensive shop
facilities. Shop test equipment and procedures assured
conformance to tolerances several times more critical than
normally necessary.
Grinnell assumed sole responsibility for safe delivery
of finished components. Specifications included accurate
machining, argon shielded welding, selection of welding
rod and flux materials for smooth interior weld surfaces,
step-by-step inspection — even complete radiography of
centrifugally cast stainless steel pipe.
Whatever your field, you'll find Grinnell shop-fabrica-
tion greatly reduces costs of cutting, fitting, welding,
assembling and final erection. You are assured of adequate
facilities for producing pieces of any size, at costs known
before you start. What's more, you get the advantages of
one-company responsibility.

be controlled, directed and made to
carry information. Ordinary light waves
—the kind thrown off by light bulbs—
are highly incoherent and move like
an unruly mob.
This beam—of an almost absolutely
pure color—was slightly under one-
half an inch wide. It is so directional
that if aimed at a wall one mile away,
it would show up as a spot of light
only a foot in diameter. With a suit-
able telescope used as an antenna, the
spot would be only one-foot wide even
100 miles away.
Silicone Pump: A new, high tempera-
ture hydraulic pump, which utilizes a
silicone fluid for operation under con-
ditions of extreme high temperature
and pressure. The silicone fluid is said
to provide a more positive action in
motivating controls than gases, while
at the same time maintaining stability
superior to other fluids at super hot
operating temperatures of 550° F.

A special feature of the unit is the
dual reliability achieved by two inde-
pendent pumping elements driven by a
common drive shaft enclosed in a sin-
gle body. Thus, in the remote possibil-
ity of failure of one, the operation of
the remaining pumping element will
not be affected. Each element is capa-
ble of meeting the flow requirements
of the system which it serves.
According to the manufacturer, pump
model X013673 has a discharge pres-
sure of 4000 PSI (full flow), a drive
speed of 3817 RPM, and a pump ele-

ment speed of 5800 RPM. Discharge
flow is 22.5 GPM; displacement, 1.52
cu-in/rev., and weight, 29.5 pounds.
Other special features include stain-
less steel housings, metallic seal rings
throughout, bellows-type running seal,
compact size, and 150 PSI cut-off
differential.
New Muffler: The first 100 per cent
stainless steel auto muffler is now be-
ing made for the replacement market
and promises to lick the annual $375
million muffler corrosion problem.
Only about one-half the size of to-
day's conventional mufflers, the stain-
less steel muffler uses a new technique
to deaden the engine's roaring sound.
The muffler weighs slightly more than
seven pounds and is made entirely of
stainless steel.
Normally, mufflers have no moving
parts. This one is different. The secret
of the new muffler's design is in a spe-
cial stainless steel spring that operates
on exhaust pressure. The spring ad-
justs automatically as driving demands
dictate. Conventional mufflers are pre-
tuned in their manufacture for the car
and model. The muffler adjusts itself
at "idle," at turnpike driving, or any-
where between, to give maximum gas-
oline economy and minimum exhaust
noise.
The spring action is somewhat sim-
ilar to the human heart in that it pulses
with engine pressures. The greater the
engine pressure, the wider the spring
action. The extremely narrow openings
between the spring coils at low rpm
act as an effective sound attenuator,
while the continuous vibration of the
"valve" tends to smooth the pulsations
in the exhaust gas. Thus, it again re-
duces the sound level in the system.
More important is the fact that at
higher rpm, when more volume of gas
is exhausted, the valve will automat-
ically open wider to provide a large
passage for the exhaust gas. This
means that an effective silencer at low
rpm is not permitted to become a
source of excessive back pressure for
turnpike driving.
The muffler has been both field and
laboratory tested and has proven both
durable and effective. It meets all re-
quirements of sound deadening and
long life.

How can you evaluate your growth pros-
pects with any organization?
The best way we know of is to check the
past, present and future direction of the
company being considered. And, based on
these practical measurements, we invite
young, career-minded engineers to investi-
gate the opportunities for personal growth
at Sikorsky Aircraft . . . where there's room
to go and grow.
At Sikorsky, we pioneered helicopters. Our
continuing objective is to further advance
V/STOL (vertical/short take-off and land-
ing) aircraft.
The technical talent we require can enjo&gt;
diversified, small-group activities in an ex-
cellent engineering environment. Assign-
ments could include joining an electronic
team of twenty to thirty associates-or-
working with four or five associates on such
interesting problems as antenna radiation •
instrumentation • automatic pilot • auto-
matic stabilization • among others.
Your future at Sikorsky can be one of chal-
lenging and exciting progress . . the op-
portunity is here—now.

SPECIAL ISSUE!!!
March issue will be a special issue devoted to the
humanities and the arts. Four main articles will be
featured on: literature, art, music and philosophy.
Written by some of our faculty members, the articles
are designed to explain each of these humanistic
endeavors and the worth of each.
Two junior sized "cats" were loiter-
ing on the street corner, when one said

"Ah don't know," said the first.
"You don't know how old you is?"
"Nope."
"Does women bother you?"
"Nope."
"Youse fo.'"
"Lady, you'll have to pay full fare

"How can he be over twelve, when
I've only been married ten years?"
"Listen Lady, I collect fares — not

A lady busily engaged in washing
her upstairs windows leaned out too

Who turned common day into alumina?
Olin. With a process that economically extracts large
crystals of aluminum sulphate from clay or shale. The
process is already a laboratory reality, now in the pilot
plant stage.
We've also produced the hydrazine that propels
Titan II missiles. And a tough, bullet-stopping plastic.
And many other important advances in our two prin-
cipal areas of activity — chemicals and metals.
At Olin, at least one new product is conceived every
week. Research gets a healthy budget and research
people, a healthy climate. Research outlays
are up 53 % over 3 years ago.
One of the more interesting aspects of Olin is that
research is centralized at our new Research Center
in New Haven, Conn, (all divisions but Squibb, which
is located in New Brunswick, N. J.). Promising gradu-

There are those who will tell you that the world beyond the academic walls is (a)
highly competitive, (b) full of opportunity, and (c) above all, serious business.
Although we are keenly aware of the serious implications of the advanced propul-
sion work we're doing, at UTC we take a somewhat different view.
We believe that the right man in the right job will enjoy what he's doing. He'll find
the competition stimulating, the challenge exciting. He'll be eager to get to work
in the morning, simply because his work is fun. And this enthusiasm is bound to
rub off on the paycheck, make no mistake about that.
Now, while you're giving serious thought to your future, we invite you to check out
the possibilities here at UTC. For more information, write Jay Waste, Dept. 11

Advantages of working for a large company:
1. Formal training program.
2. A variety of available positions.
3. Wide choice of geographic locations.
4. Greater job security.
5. Extra benefits-financial aid for advanced studies,
retirement plans, hospital plans, life insurance.

Advantages of working for a small company:
1. Fewer steps to the top.
2. Individual attention by top management.
3. Greater growth opportunity.
4. Earlier responsibility.
5. More opportunity to handle complete projects.
Why B&amp;Wcan offer you the advantages of both
For the college graduate there is
usually an optimum size company
where he will find his greatest op-
portunity.
For you, this company could be
Babcock &amp; Wilcox.
Babcock &amp; Wilcox is a large, pro-
gressive company. For example,
1961 sales were over $300 million.
Every year B&amp;W invests many mil-
lions of dollars in research and de-
velopment. B&amp;W has all the advan-
tages of a large company: formal
training program, wide variety of
job openings (16 plants in 8 states),
plus the security and benefits of a
large, 95-year-old organization.
Babcock &amp; Wilcox also can be con-
sidered a small company. There are
149 larger industrial companies in
the U.S. Growth opportunities are
tremendous. Only 57 bachelor-level
students will be hired in 1962. This
select group will be given an oppor-
tunity to work on important projects
at an early stage in their careers.
If you are interested in the size of
the opportunity rather than the size
of the company, your placement
office has a booklet that describes
openings available for graduate and
undergraduate engineers and scien-
tists, including E.E., Ch.E., M.E.,
Met.E., Cer.E., chemists and physi-
cists. Or write to J. W. Andeen, The

Mechanical Engineering
Engineering is a profession whose members do creative work which results in things and information
which people want and need. Mechanical engineering is that branch of the profession which deals with
devices and equipment whose design, manufacture, and operation are essentially mechanical in nature. Thus the
mechanical engineer is concerned with thermodynamics, fluid flow, and heat transfer since the design of
many mechanical devices is based on a thorough knowledge of these phenomena. He is also concerned with
dynamics, stress analysis, materials, and automatic control, since these considerations enter into the design
of mechanical equipment. A knowledge of the principles of design and manufacturing is also essential for
the mechanical engineer if he is to fulfill his professional responsibilities.
Thus mechanical engineering is a profession of considerable breadth and is essential to virtually every
industry and phase of technology. Mechanical engineering education at the University of Michigan involves
an integrated program of study in basic science, engineering sciences, mathematics, professionally oriented
courses, and humanities. The laboratory instruction is closely integrated with the classroom, and is given in
the various research laboratories in mechanical engineering. Many of the students have additional opportu-
nities to enrich their education by participating in research work during their undergraduate and graduate
studies.
The objective of the educational program is to provide the environment which will enable students to
prepare to lead industry and technology in an era of rapid development and advancement.

history, sociology, and political science,
it is difficult to acquire a mature per-
spective on such issues as racial prob-
lems, disarmament, or the Berlin crisis.
Anyone with the intellectual capabil-
ities of an engineer should regard his
acquiring mature political views and
concepts as his responsibility to him-
self, his family, and his country.
While conceding the aforementioned
points to be valid arguments for non-
technical education for engineers, oppo-
nents of my position point out several
valid points of interest. Modern science
and technology have made such prog-
ress that there is so much more for the
engineer to learn today than formerly.
Secondly, the colleges and universities
are growing more and more crowded,
and to ease this problem, a reduction,
rather than an increase in the curricu-
lum length would be indicated. Since
many of our engineers today already
know too little engineering, they in-
sist it is very difficult to cut the cur-
riculum anywhere except by eliminating
some non-technical courses. So indeed,
there is a dilemma which may be grow-
ing worse.
I agree that these arguments are
strong for reducing the non-technical
side of the engineering curriculum and
increasing the technical side within the
limits of total curriculum size specified.
However, I feel that the humanities
and social sciences are too important
to be neglected at any cost. The only
solution to the dilemma, therefore, is
to streamline and improve the efficiency
of the curriculum, emphasizing the bas-
ics and the theories, and neglecting the
specifics which will soon be outdated
anyway. The non-technical courses as
well should be streamlined and im-
proved to provide the best possible
acquaintance with the subject in, say,
one semester. Then, by wise choices
of non-technical as well as technical
courses, the student engineer will ap-
proach more closely the intellectual
scope and versatility that is so valuable
and satisfying in this modern world.

(random notes)
Grateful but cautious
More spectrographic plates and film
are used each year than the year before.
This goes on despite new fashions in
elemental analysis by physical methods
and by new Eastman Organic Chem-
icals. The civilized world is analysis-
happy and that makes us happy.
To betoken the happiness a small
pamphlet has been issued under the
title "Spectrum Analysis with Kodak
Materials." Its words may prove less
useful than its graphs and numbers,
though the words devoted to a warning
against taking the graphs and numbers
too seriously must be taken seriously.
That's life.
Life lived with the photographic
emulsion as a measuring instrument
for radiation intensity must be filled
with gratitude for its simplicity, versa-
tility, and economy and filled with
caution against glib assumptions. Those
who live that life have learned that:
1. Kodak Spectroscopic Plates and Film,
Type 103-0 work fast, capture quick-
vanishing spectra.
2. Kodak Spectrum Analysis No. I Plates
and Film are contrasty and good for
trace-element lines against heavy back-
ground, for semi-quantitative compari-
son, and for all-out quantitative jobs.
3. For cutting corners on how many
wave lengths you calibrate at, resort
to the new Kodak "SA-.3" Plates or Films.
(If you still want the pamphlet, write
to our Special Sensitized Products
Division.)
Never say die?

These metal parts are not stampings.
They arc too fussy and tricky for knife
or milling machine and needed too fast
and in insufficient numbers to justify
the fabrication of dies. They are prod-
ucts of photo-etching, which is catching on.
Some outfits photo-etch for them-
selves, and some do it for hire. The
method uses either Kodak Photo Resist
or Kodak Metal-Etch Resist, depending
on the metal. Both are light-sensitive
liquids. The object is drawn to enlarged
scale and photographed. The metal is
coated with KPR or KMER and exposed
to light through the negative. Where
the negative protects from the light,
the resist will subsequently flush away;
where light-struck, it becomes resistant
to etchant. Etchants leave no burrs.
The thinner the metal the closer the
tolerances an etchant can work to.
Photo-etching speeds execution of
design ideas. With fewer punch-press
tenders needed nowadays anyway, more
of the population has to earn a living
in the idea business.
Chemical tuning
We make optical interference filters on
a custom basis. In seeking customers
one must be creative. Why not adver-
tise them to chemists?
To a chemist, a color filter is what
he slips into a colorimeter. If he is an
enthusiastic photographer, he may know
of dyed-gelatin Kodak Wratten Light
Filters. We take it from there:
"Suppose, for fantasy's sake, that you
wanted to flood a reaction preferentially
with energy of exactly that frequency
to which a certain carbon-nitrogen bond
responds. An interference filter could
probably be made for the job.
"An interference filter is tunable in
manufacture for wavelengths from 0.4ft
to 12/i. Unlike gelatin or glass filters,
its curve doesn't depend on what color-
ants happen to be available. It can
provide a single spectral spike of trans-
mittance but is not limited to that.
It can also be designed to cut out
energy below a stated frequency or
above a stated frequency. It can cut very
sharp. It is thermally, chemically, and
mechanically rugged. It costs a great
deal less than a laser (which, while it
can emit Niagaras of monochromatic
energy, must work with the quantum
states that Nature has in stock). It can
be large. It can be designed to monitor
a process stream continuously for the
presence or absence of any substance
possessing a suitable energy-absorbancc
curve."
Maybe something clicks somewhere.

INCREASING EXPLOITATION OF PHOTOCHEMICAL REACTIONS DEMANDS GOOD CHEMICAL ENGINEERS, AMONG OTHERS
From porlrait lenses to polishing waxes,
plenty of lively careers are to be made with
Kodak in research, engineering, production,
marketing.
And whether you work for us or not,
photography in some form will probably
have a part in your work as years go on.
Always feel free to ask for Kodak literature
or help on anything photographic.

Interview with General Electric's
Francis J. Boucher
Manager-Manufacturing Personnel Development Service
How Good
Is Your Best Job Offer • • .
Q. Mr. Boucher, with all the job inter-
views a graduating engineer goes
through, how can he be reasonably
sure he has made the right choice?
A. This is a good question because
few seniors have enough work ex-
perience in industry, government
and educational institutions to
allow them to make a fully rea-
soned choice. However, I think the
first step is to be sure that short-
term factors like starting salary
and location don't outweigh long-
range factors like opportunity and
professional growth. All of these
factors should be evaluated before
making a final commitment.
Q. But you do feel that starting salary
is important?
A. Very much so. If you are mar-
ried—it may be an even greater
consideration. But you should also
look beyond starting salary. Find
out, for example, if the company
you are considering has a good
salary administration plan. If there
is no way of formally appraising
your performance and determining
your appropriate rewards, you run
the risk of becoming dissatisfied
or stalemated due to neglect of
these important considerations.
Q. What considerations do you feel
should be evaluated in reaching a job
decision?
A. Let me refer you to a paper
written by Dr. L. E. Saline, now
Manager of Information Systems
in our Defense Systems Depart-
ment. It is titled "How to Evaluate
Job Offers." (Incidentally, you may
obtain a copy by writing as di-
rected in the last paragraph.) In
it, Dr. Saline proposes six ques-
tions—the answers to which should
give you much of the information
you'll need for an objective job-
offer evaluation. He suggests you
determine . . .
• to what degree will the work be
challenging and satisfying?
• what opportunities are available
to further develop abilities?
• what opportunities are there for
advancing in the Company (and
how dynamic the Company is in
the marketplace is an important
• what salary potentials are pos-
sible with respect to the future?
• what about geographical location
—now and in the future?
• what effort does the Company
make to establish and maintain a
professional climate?
There is more to these questions
than meets the eye and I think
you would enjoy reading Dr.
Saline's paper.
Q. What about the openings on de-
fense projects that are listed in the
various magazines and newspapers?
A. Presumably, there will always
be a need for technical manpower
in the defense business. But I
want to point out to you that most
of these opportunities are for ex-
perienced personnel, or personnel
with specific additional training re-
ceived at the graduate level.
Q. How do you feel about training
programs? Do they offer any particular
advantages over any other offer I
might accept?
A. I feel training programs are par-
ticularly helpful in easing the tran-
sition from an academic to a
business environment. Of course
they provide formal training de-
signed to add to the individual's
basic fund of knowledge. They
also provide working experience in
a variety of fields and a broad
knowledge of the company con-
cerned and its scope of operations.
Upon completion, the individual is
generally better prepared to decide
the direction in which he will pur-
sue his professional career.
General Electric conducts a num-
ber of training programs. Those
that attract the greatest number
of engineers are the Engineering
and Science, Manufacturing, and
Technical Marketing Programs.
Each combines a formal, graduate-
level study curriculum, on-the-job
experience, and rotating assign-
ments. There is little question in
my mind that when an engineer
completes the Program of his
choice, he is far better prepared to
choose his field by interest and by
capability. I might also add that
because of this, he is more valuable
to the Company as an employee.
Q. Then you feel that a training pro-
gram is the best alternative for a
graduating engineer?
A. Not always. Some seniors have
already determined the specific
field they are best suited for in
terms of their own interests and
capabilities. In such cases, direct
placement into this specific field
may be more advantageous. Pro-
fessional self-development for these
employees, as for all General Elec-
tric technical employees, is en-
couraged through a variety of
programs including the Company's
Tuition Refund Program for work
toward advanced degrees, in-plant
courses conducted at the graduate
level, and others designed to meet
individual needs.
O. For the record, how would you
rate a job offer from General Electric?
A. I've tried to get across the need
for factual information and a long-
range outlook as the keys to any
good job evaluation. With respect
to the General Electric Company,
seniors and placement offices have
access to a wide variety of infor-
mation about the Company, its
professional environment and its
personnel practices. I think quali-
fied seniors will also discover that
General Electric offers professional
opportunity second to none—and
starting salaries that are competi-
tive with the average offered
throughout industry today. From
the above, you can see that I
would rate a job offer from General
Electric very highly.

General Electric's training pro-
grams? You can get it, together
with a copy of Dr. Saline's paper

reer Planning," General Electric

Seattle, Washington. Called the Space Needle, it soars 600 feet into the air on three steel legs, tapers to a slim
waist at the 373-ft. mark, then flares out slightly to the 500-ft. level, and is crowned by a mezzanine, observation deck,
and a 260-seat restaurant that revolves slowly (one complete revolution an hour) while patrons enjoy their meals.
The Space Needle is a combination of sheer audacity and imagination with 3,500 tons of steel. Steel was
chosen because it would be faster to erect, stronger per unit area, quickly available. A relatively new type of
structural carbon steel called A36 was used because its greater strength (about 10%) permits higher design
stresses, at the same time maintaining factors of safety, and because it could be easily welded. This is an example
of the exciting materials and challenging projects engineers will find at United States Steel.

Machining Intricate Parts to Minute Tolerances ... by the

three-dimensional cam for jet aircraft engines by a factor of ten.
Solution: Bendix numerically controlled cam milling machine. Oper-
ated by computer-developed punched tape, it cuts lead time to less
than a week, provides unmatched part-to-part repeatability (with r.m.s.
errors as low as .0001 inch). This Bendix development marks the first
successful production application of tape controls to a machine tool.
Previously, the operator made a digital-to-analog conversion when
translating "blueprint" dimensions into machine motion. This con-
version is done automatically in the Bendix system by employing
linear interpolation techniques to generate the contours. Input data
is reduced so that punched-tape control records are feasible. Storage
and data manipulation is handled by all-electronic means; an improved
logic structure keeps the volume of circuitry to manageable proportions.
Where earlier models had interposed instrument servo links

high precision digital servos with a band width of 100 cps to drive
the machine members directly. The machine structure itself was
designed to stringent requirements to insure adequate response.

required control tapes using specially prepared programs and a
general-purpose digital computer.

1. Formal training program.
2. A variety of available positions.
3. Wide choice of geographic locations.
4. Greater job security.
5. Extra benefits-financial aid for advanced studies,
retirement plans, hospital plans, life insurance.

Advantages of working for a small company:
1. Fewer steps to the top.
2. Individual attention by top management.
3. Greater growth opportunity.
4. Earlier responsibility.
5. More opportunity to handle complete projects.
Why B&amp;W can offer you the advantages of both
For the college graduate there is
usually an optimum size company
where he will find his greatest op-
portunity.
For you, this company could be
Babcock &amp; Wilcox.
Babcock &amp; Wilcox is a large, pro-
gressive company. For example,
1961 sales were over $300 million.
Every year B&amp;W invests many mil-
lions of dollars in research and de-
velopment. B&amp;W has all the advan-
tages of a large company: formal
training program, wide variety of
job openings (16 plants in 8 states),
plus the security and benefits of a
large, 95-year-old organization.
Babcock &amp; Wilcox also can be con-
sidered a small company. There are
149 larger industrial companies in
the U.S. Growth opportunities are
tremendous. Only 57 bachelor-level
students will be hired in 1962. This
select group will be given an oppor-
tunity to work on important projects
at an early stage in their careers.
If you are interested in the size of
the opportunity rather than the size
of the company, your placement
office has a booklet that describes
openings available for graduate and
undergraduate engineers and scien-
tists, including E.E., Ch.E., M.E.,
Met.E., Cer.E., chemists and physi-
cists. Or write to J. W. Andeen, The

Must tomorrow's travelers resort to howdahs and
camel litters in order to get about? Not so, say
our Ford Motor Company scientists.
First—aside from the unlikely depletion of our
natural sources of gasoline—the prospects for
higher-efficiency internal combustion engines
are excellent.
Second, while gasoline still appears the best con-
ceivable automotive fuel, our scientists are study-
ing the outlook for new energy sources for cars.
Among intriguing possibilities: new energy con-
version systems using degraded fuels, or fuels
synthesized from low-cost power produced by
nuclear fusion. Magneto-hydrodynamic gener-
ators and solid-state thermoelectric and electro-
chemical converters offer other possibilities.

Liberalism and conservatism are terms that appear in the
news every day. They are usually connected with the Demo-
cratic and Republican parties, respectively, but there are varying
degrees in each party, e.g., liberal Republicans and conservative
Democrats.
The liberals, whether identified by the "New Deal" or the
"New Frontier" are advocates of change. This is their most
identifiable characteristic. Many people identify the conserva-
tives as proponents of "Status Quo," or as opponents of change.
This is a misconception which does not even apply to the ex-
treme right wing followers of Senator Goldwater. The con-
servatives have different views on what changes should be
made, but are also advocates of change.
What has made the United States the great country that it
is, in less than two hundred years? It can be summed up by one
word — change. A vision must precede change. Our founding
fathers had a vision, a nation based on freedom and individual
rights. They had no pattern to follow in their efforts. They
had only a vision and the ability to think clearly and look ahead.
The foundation of our nation, the Constitution, certainly
has been a determining factor in our progress. It was formu-
lated on two important ideas, a balance of power and flexibility.
The flexibility has enabled the United States to adapt to chang-
ing conditions, both at home and abroad. Our former policy
of isolationism has given way to the present policy of active
participation in international affairs.
The system of free enterprise has been a big factor in our
progress. The "conservative" businessman has taken risks, and
succeeded in providing us with the world's highest standard of
living. The businessman had a vision, made changes, and
reached his goals.
Change is essential to our dynamic, democratic society. We
need a vision, a national purpose, goals, and if history is an
indication, the American people will reach these goals.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


and a trend toward modified socialism (social security, social-
ized medicine). The conservatives appeal for greater individual
freedoms and less government control.
Both sides present meritorious arguments and there seems
to be a tendency to view the other side's ideas as having some
merit. Neither viewpoint is one hundred per cent right, but
one thing is for certain, changes will occur.
In the past two years, many magazines have changed their
format, in fact, one national magazine seems to have a different
format each week.
Changes occur occasionally in the TECHNIC. We make
changes whenever an improvement can be made, and we cer-
tainly recognize that improvements can be made. A most node-
able one is our new logotype (the part of the cover that says
MICHIGAN TECHNIC). The former logotype had merit, but
presented problems in integration of the cover and the logotype.
After a year of research, the present style was adopted. It is
expected that better covers will be a justification for this change.
This special issue on the arts and humanities is also the 80th
anniversary issue of the TECHNIC. This makes the TECHNIC
the oldest publication on the University of Michigan campus
and also the oldest engineering college magazine in America.
In 1882, the Engineering society of the University of Mich-
igan published papers that were presented at its meetings. This
annual publication was first called the TECHNIC in 1887.
The frequency of publication increased until it became a month-
ly in 1912. The Engineering Society died in the 1920's and it
was at that time that the TECHNIC joined the Engineering
College Magazines Associated, a national organization. The
TECHNIC has won a number of ECMA awards, including
"First in General Excellence," twice in the last five years.

Monsanto... a world leader in chemicals, plastics and
petroleum products ... has also taken a giant step into
the atomic space age. Now broadcasting signals from
space is a Transit satellite transmitter, powered by an
"atomic generator." This long-lived power source is
fueled with plutonium 238 processed and encapsulated
at Mound Laboratory, which Monsanto Research
Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Monsanto,
operates for the Atomic Energy Commission.
This achievement is important to you because it suggests
the kind of future the Monsanto family offers the young
engineer of exceptional promise. You'll be joining a
company that's ready and able to move vigorously in-
to new fields. And that means plenty of growing room
for you . . . ever-expanding opportunity as your pro-
fessional interests broaden.

Most Economical Route to Quality Products

Eliminate Waste Metal
Why pay for 2.8 pounds of metal. . . then machine out and
scrap 1.2 pounds of the center? Changing this snap coupler
to a Malleable iron casting with a cored center reduced initial
cost 31 cents and cut the first interior machining opera-
tion by 72 per cent (subsequent operations were up to 25
per cent less expensive, too). Through expert use of cores
in parts that require interior design details, your Malleable
foundry puts metal only where it is needed.

Eliminate Machining
With Malleable you often get the finished part right out of
the mold. This Malleable sprocket is used without machin-
ing or hardening on the teeth. It replaces a flame cut steel
plate to which a hub was welded. Remember, you can get
equal or better quality at lower cost with Malleable.


Eliminate Assembly
How much can you save on a simple little hanger like this?
Plenty, when you have to cut, bend, punch and weld, in-
cluding all the handling involved . . . and when you're using
60,000 pieces a year. Converted to a Malleable casting
(with cored hole and better design), this simple part looks
better, works better, costs less . . . because it's Malleable.
Eliminate Surplus Weight
You don't need to beef up parts until they're needlessly
heavy just to eliminate failure during use. For example, this
pneumatic impact wrench cuts metal, breaks welds, splits
nuts and shears bolts. At one time, breakage of the pistol
grip housing near the impact area was a serious problem.
A change to MalleaWe solved the problem by providing
maximum strength in thin sections. When your parts need
a high fatigue ratio, remember that Malleable ranks high
among commonly used metals.

Free Malleable Engineering Data File is available for your use. Just
write to Malleable Castings Council, Union Commerce Building,
Cleveland 14, Ohio...or ask any company that displays this symbol...

most out of a
job interview:
Every company that interviews col-
lege students is interested in hiring
students with high potential. But
matching the right man with the right
company is a complex assignment.
How can you know which company
you should join? You can't know for
sure, but you can get a reasonably
accurate indication if you make the
most of your campus interview. Be-
low are a few suggestions to assist you
in making such an interview with
Koppers more worthwhile and produc-
tive for you.
a Before the interview, stop in
your Placement Office and re-
view in some detail the literature
explaining Koppers diversified line
of products and services. Become
familiar with Koppers eight operat-
ing divisions and the particular con-
tribution each makes to industry.
|n| Try to determine as specifically
L_l as you can the type of work
that seems to interest you most.
Then question the interviewer as to
how that type of work fits into
Koppers many activities. If, like
many graduates, you find that your
interests cover many areas of work,
tell the interviewer. You'll find that
he will understand your problem
and may be of help in deciding on
the kind of "Koppers opportunity"
for which you would be best suited.
XI Be prepared to outline your
—I accomplishments. He will be in-
terested in your extra-curricular ac-
tivities as well as your scholastic
achievement. Point out any part-
time or summer experience which
you may have had. If you can effec-
tively communicate to the inter-
viewer your background and inter-
ests, both you and he will be better
able to decide whether or not this
is the right opportunity for you.
Review with the interviewer
a
Koppers on-the-job training
program. This program is designed
to allow you to make an immediate
and recognizable contribution. You
go to work—you don't return to the
classroom for training. You will be
working on projects that will permit
you to apply the knowledge you have
gained through your college training,
while at the same time you will be
furthering your knowledge and un-
derstanding of your field.
Ask the interviewer about job
location, military policy, educa-
tional assistance policy, and any
other questions which you may have
about the Company. He will be
happy to provide any information he
can to assist you in getting the most
from your Koppers interview.
If the possibility of a career with Koppers interests you, contact your Placement Office
and arrange to see the Koppers representative on his next visit to your campus.

It is most unusual for an undergrad-
uate engineering magazine to devote
an entire issue to the humanities. Many
would say it is inappropriate.
Probably the easiest defense of this
issue of The Technic is a statistical one:
the chief purpose of this magazine is
to reflect the educational process in
this college; since approximately 20
percent of an undergraduate's time is
devoted to the humanities and social
sciences, it is not inappropriate that
occasionally The Technic deal with this
segment of the curriculum.
But a more difficult yet far more sat-
isfactory defense of this issue would go
beyond statistics to consider the value
of the humanities to the engineer. Why
should an engineering student's limited
time be devoted to the study of such
obviously non-engineering subjects as
philosophy, literature, art, or music—
the subjects that are usually regarded
as comprising the humanities? Or to
put it more pointedly: at a time when
our civilization may be destroyed in a
nuclear war, can we afford to turn over
part of an engineer's education to
classes in the humanities?
The three articles in this issue are in
part an attempt to answer that urgent
question. The answer they offer—some-
times implicitly—is that the humani-
ties constitute and define our civiliza-
tion. What differentiates us from the
Russians is not power steering, air con-
ditioning, and electric toothbrushes.
They either already possess, or soon
will, the skill and productive capacity
to turn out as many gadgets as we.
What, then, is the civilization we are
hoping to preserve? What are we liv-
ing for if not to watch color television,
drive a 300-horsepower car and brush
our teeth electrically?
What defines our civilization and
makes it worth defending is ultimately
nothing that can be bought or sold. It
has to do with the mind, the imagina-
tion, the spirit. In short, it has to do
with those values which the humanities
are forever celebrating, debating, and
embodying.

BUT
I WANT TO KNOW
WHY
by Arthur Forbes
In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.
T. S. Eliot: "The Love Song
of J. Alfred Prufrock"
So if you want to join the ladies,
take a course in the History of Fine
Arts. Art as a Conversation Piece. Art,
along with golf, swimming, and a
membership in the country club, as a
business asset— the status symbol par
excellence! Art for Togetherness. (And
let's not forget Art as Investment, for
details of which see the January PLAY-
BOY.)
But Eliot, as do all real artists,
means much more than he says (for art,
unlike science, is ambiguous, contra-
dictory). He means that the women
are lifelessly, drily, repetitiously talk-
ing about Culture, and are talking
shallowly, emptyheadedly about one of
the greatest, most spiritually profound
attestors to the supreme dignity of
mankind.
Nonetheless, assume that one should
study art in order to talk with the
educated friends one will have as an
engineering executive. And there are
other pragmatic reasons, reasons that
justify art, not as a Thing-in-Itself, but
as a tool, a means to an unrelated end.
I've suggested that one can study art
in order to collect it for investment,
as one does real estate or stocks. If art
study results in a strengthening of
one's aesthetic tastes, it will improve
one's choice of home, interior decora-
tion, automobile, dress, and, perhaps,
manners. As a "leading citizen," an en-
gineer can influence civic, school, and
church architecture, street planning,
parks, and memorials. A leading auto-
mobile designer recently suggested to
me that the engineer in a managerial
position exerts not only strong influ-
ence on, but often makes the final
decisions concerning his company's
product design, packaging, and adver-
tising. Surely a study of art should
bolster one's confidence to exert such
influence and to make such decisions.
And if art is indeed one of the "hu-
manities" (and, of course, I assume it
is), its study should make one more
human, more humane. For art is a com-
munication, an emotional statement
made by one human being to another.
But more of this later, for I'd like to ig-
nore for the present the nature of ar-
tistic symbols and even the kind of
message they give us, if you will accept
as "fact" that, correctly handled, they
do "tell" us something about the hu-
man being and the human condition.
If you will, you must admit that we
can acquire from art a deeper under-
standing of others that will make us
more sympathetic, tolerant, and com-
passionate. (Art, like all other good
things, can be used evilly, too, and too
often is.)
Art as a Means
Other more personal pragmatic rea-
sons can be given. As individuals in a
period of great leisure, we need some
hobby to fill in the time. Art can be
studied and collected, then, as a "filler"
—of course, stamp or rock collecting,
listening to the radio, or playing shuf-
fleboard can substitute, per se, equally
well. I hope I shall be able to prove
the superiority of art as a leisure-time
activity.
The study of art enlarges our col-
lection of facts about social, political,
and religious history. We learn not
only what people considered important
in their time, but how they looked,
how they dressed, and how they de-
ported themselves (or would like to
have) in what kind of rooms. In short,
however "emotional" art may be, its
artifacts usually communicate, though
not always or necessarily, "objective
facts."
To the extent that we are all philos-
ophers, that we hold principles dear,
that we formulate permanent, or rela-
tively permanent, "truths" by which to
evaluate objects, behavior, and atti-
tudes, we are concerned with that
branch of philosophy called aesthetics.

able us to construct a personal aesthetic
more valid, meaningful, and useful
than that made possible by more hap-
hazard, accidental, unconscious con-
tacts. For philosophy, insomuch as it
deserves the name, is acutely conscious,
almost painfully rational.
I have tried to show how the study
of art can be useful for objective rea-
sons and as a means, an instrument
without intrinsic worth. I trust, how-
ever, that you have felt that no matter
how good my reasons may be, others
of greater import have given art its
great place in history and have elicited
for it the lifetime devotions of its cre-
ators and the awesome reverence of its
admirers. Before I touch on these,
however, allow me to digress to ex-
plain some terms and to theorize about
the possible basic needs of man that
art might be called upon to fulfill.
Complexity and Circuity
I have used the word "pragmatic"
loosely; a professional philosopher
would no doubt reject my meaning. I
have meant the word as a quality of
that object or action used for the at-
tainment of some end, that end being
the maintenance and perpetuation of
life. In our civilization such mainte-
nance and perpetuation is, outside the
basic acts of breathing, elimination, and
eating, complex and often devious in
its indirections (even the acts I've
named can be ritualistically complex).
For example, if one discusses Michel-
angelo over a martini at the country
club with the boss's wife, he hopes,
even if he swears differently, to pro-
mote his advancement, which means to
increase his salary to maintain himself
and his family in greater security. I
am, of course, not denying that talking
with the boss's wife has other purposes
—discreet sexual stimulation, exchange
of knowledge for its own sake, satis-
faction of the need for human compan-
ionship, sheer ego satisfaction, delight
in the dress, charm, and beauty of the
lady, etc. So, whereas an animal would
simply pounce upon his prey to satisfy
his immediate need, civilized man takes
a circuitous route, one infinitely more
complex, perhaps more anxiety-ridden
and frustrating, but ultimately more
deeply rewarding.
The Nature of Symbols
Civilization is complex because of
the nature of stored symbols—verbal,
plastic, auditory, tactile — symbols
stored either in actual material (books,
buildings, paintings, etc.) for use by
the brain, or solely in the brain. Sym-
bols give man what animals presum-
ably lack, a sense of time and of space
—a sense of the past and of the future
and of other than the immediate en-
vironment. Further, symbols not only
permit but produce interrelationships
among themselves. And in such inter-
relationships lie the glory and the rub.
Some symbols and their interrela-
tionships (even the process of inter-
acting is symbolic) are translatable into
"real" things—as H20 can be used to
produce hydrogen and oxygen, or E =
mc2 can produce sensory evidence of
energy, or, more simply, my kitchen
knife can be used to pry open a pickle
jar, or Dr. Glaser's beer bubbles can
result in the bubble chamber. The sym-
bol is more than itself; and the Thing-
in-Itself, when examined abstractly,
becomes a symbol—becomes endowed
with meanings and uses beyond those
it was ordinarily thought to have.
But the symbols of science, however
much they may be handled analogi-
cally, imaginatively, are meant to be
denotative—to stand for just one thing
or quality, or process. Science seeks a
one-to-one relationship between the
symbol and that for which it stands;
science distrusts the overtones, the vi-
brato. Further, science, and especially
engineering, although it may produce
pure form and aesthetic beauty (as in
some ships, skyscrapers, engines, bridg-
es, and cloverleaf intersections), has as
its goal the alteration or transforma-
tion of the "real" world—the material,
the objective world. To name examples
of its multifarious successes would be,
to understate, an act of supererogation.
From the first example of "symbolic"
engineering (the use of the stone to
kill or of the twig to till?), through
the wheel to the computer, science has
given us relief (time) from the de-
mands of sheer survival. Along with
time it has provided space—time and
space for those elegant ladies of Eliot's
to toss about the name of Michelangelo
in their insistent game of intellectual
tiddlywinks.
Symbols Interbreed
What I've been trying to say is that
the brain of man is active and power-
ful. It seizes upon symbols avidly.
When these symbols are not handled
with the cold discipline of science di-
rected at the solution of problems of
survival, they and their overtones (con-
notations) interbreed and multiply. The
results are sometimes glorious, some-
times fantastic, sometimes trivial, and,
perhaps most often, terrifying. Symbols
produce what is not in the "real"
world — horizons of shining wonders
on unscalable mountaintops and hor-
rendous caverns of sulfureous fires in
the earth's bowels.
Symbol "Systems"
And what does man do with the ex-
cess productivity of his seething, tire-
less brain? As already mentioned, he
increases his productivity to release
more time, space, and energy. He then
reduces what of the excess he can to
denotative "systems," mathematical,
philosophic, religious, social. Such sys-
tems employ, or attempt to, verbal and
numerical symbols which are "pure" in
that they relate in no objective way to
the "real" world, or which are used
in the hope that they do relate ("fic-
tions" are commonly accepted, socially
useful "non-truths" or constructs).
Some of these systems can be said to
be "true" insofar as they are built upon
a set of arbitrary rules agreed upon by
the players (as a football team may
be said to have won a game because
it got the highest score although the
more "intuitive" spectators may agree
that the losing team did the superior
playing). And some systems, as that of
the mathematics of electricity, achieve
uncanny degrees of predictability, per-
fectly paralleling processes in the
"real" world.
What remains of the symbols and
their interrelationships and of their
overtonal excrescences not useful to or
assimilable by science or the other dis-
ciplines is in the province of the
dream, the daydream, "mystical" re-
ligion, and of art. Literature, as an art,
fuses the denotative and connotative
meanings of words. Music, like math-
ematics, builds its own system which
aims at ordering otherwise uncontrol-
lable, colliding symbols. And painting,

bring order to the remaining chaos.
(I'm simplifying by seeming to sug-
gest a mutually exclusive use of sym-
bols by the various arts and sciences,
an exclusiveness I'd be the first to
deny.)
Education for Awareness
Now my problem (which I seem to
have been neglecting) is to try to ex-
plain why we need to study art, spe-
cifically non-literary and non-musical
art. Why, if art produces the order-
out-of-chaos that I've suggested, need
anyone have to study it? Some people,
of course, don't need to—they are able
to use all the art available to them to
satisfy emotional needs, to resolve at
least the most urgent emotional ten-
sions. But others of us are inhibited
from recognizing that which is art or
from utilizing that which is recogniz-
able. Education removes blinders, in-
creases awareness (which, as one of the
major purposes of art, makes art itself
an education), analyzes, names, orders,
and, if genuinely successful, creates
new interrelationships.
Education seeks to abstract (in chem-
istry, "reduce") the Thing-in-Itself
from that with which it is intertwined,
from the non-essential, the accidental.
For example, the "uses" of art I enu-
merated at the outset of this article are
only too frequently confused with the
"true" purpose of art. In formal study,
we may disgressively deal with such
extraneous uses, but we try to concen-
trate on the art work itself—on the
Thing-in-Itself (and, as we all know,
concentration is rarely achieved on our
own—we all need the hickory stick).
Next we try to analyze the work, to
break it down into as many of its parts
as possible, to name those parts, and
to discover and name the relationships
among them. This is, of course, the
usual academic procedure which often
becomes the sole end of study, result-
ing in dryness and death.
Here we hit upon the shoals on
which too often flounders the "lay" or
"primitive" critic (which means most
of us in most areas of life). For the
amateur hits quickly upon the more
obvious parts of what he is "analyzing"
(sometimes being satisfied with but one
part), labels it, only too often with
an adjective ("Beautiful!" or "Rot-
ten"), and, smug with his "success,"
becomes fixed in his opinion. (He can,
and does, accept another's "analysis"
and labeling, holding as tenaciously to
that opinion as he would to his own.)
The Word Is Strong
Notice the process involved in both
the academic and the primitive criti-
cism—the translation of that which is
one thing into verbal terminology, into
words. Whether these words are used
denotatively, connotatively, or both,
they are still words; and words, as I
have tried to point out above, are
"merely" one kind of symbol. However
useful or beautiful they may be, they
are limited in their capacity to name
or describe all but a fraction of the
multitudinous symbols and symbol in-
terrelationships of which the human
brain is capable. They are often but
imperfect metaphors or analogies for
that which is of different quality, dis-
tinct, non-verbal, a Thing-in-Itself. The
result is that the Thing-in-Itself is
cloaked, concealed, maybe smothered,
by what was not made for it (as a very
simple example, when one shows a
friend a new vase and is asked the
price of it, the cost-consideration robs
the vase of its intrinsic value—rather,
cloaks the Thing-in-Itself with eco-
nomics). And Habit, being as all-
pervasive as it is, satisfied with itself,
gleefully rationalizing even the wrong,
the ugly, the uncomfortable, accepts
the verbal label. The Word is strong.
It is sanctioned by church and school—
and even (or especially) by the laity,
for it is as easily used as it is difficult
to comprehend.
But mislabeling is not the only
blinder on the "seeing" of art. For art
usually interrelates symbols taken from
the natural world—people, stones,
trees, buildings, etc., etc. The "natural-
istic" interrelationships of these sym-
bols awaken emotional responses in the
observer (and are meant to) — "the
lovely sunset," "the cruel warriors,"
"the tender mother" (note how easily
word symbols are substituted for the
"natural" symbol and for the possible
emotions). So here again, the primitive
critic finds a convenient stopping place,
accepting or rejecting a particular sym-
bol or emotion. (This is tantamount to
liking a book because of its cover or
disliking it because of some objection-
able word used in it.)
Limits of Criticism
Academic criticism is subject, admit-
tedly, to like limitations and errors.
However, the greater concentration on
the artifact, the naming of more
"parts," the use of more nearly scien-
tific (emotionally detached) terminol-
ogy, the avoidance of stereotypical re-
actions, the purposeful use of historical
and biographical information, and the
establishment of an ambiance less nar-
row, restrictive, and constrictive than
that of the amateur, promote a truer,
deeper, and more enriching experience
of the art object. Further, the good
teacher, by transmitting to his students
a non-verbal, emotional attitude toward
the contemplation of art (by conscious
and unconscious gestures, themselves
non-verbal symbols) suggests a path
leading toward more complete aware-
ness of the art object—an awareness
which will hopefully unlock more of
the object's meanings. The synthesis of
an object's symbols (meanings) is be-
yond the scope of any teacher—for
such synthesis is the resultant of the
forces generated by the object in the
mind of the observer in solitude. The
experience of the observer is the syn-
thesis, and that experience is a Thing-
in-Itself, the true, subjective, non-
pragmatic purpose of art.
More Definitions
I have used the terms, "symbol" and
"Thing-in-Itself" (a rather awkward,
neo-Victorian term, I admit), with
slightly varying meanings. By symbol
I have meant anything which stands
for something else, which means some-
thing else. A painting is, hi toto, for
example, a symbol. Its subject matter
and each detail of the subject matter
are symbols—as are the more formal
and abstract qualities: its rhythm, com-
position, color, texture, size, balance,
contrasts, etc. A symbol, then, is any-
thing, "real" or abstract which pro-
vokes human responses, denotative or
connotative, behavioral, emotional, or
"reasonable." But as I'm discussing art,
I refer generally to symbols with con-
notative values evoking emotional re-
sponses. And by "Thing-in-Itself" I

PHILOSOPHY?
by Morris J. Starsky
There are as many answers to the
question "What is philosophy?" as
there are philosophers. So, I want to
caution you at the outset to take what
I am going to say in answer to this
question as the expression of the way
I see philosophy.
Roughly speaking, philosophy is the
sort of thing that philosophers do. As
a definition of "philosophy" this state-
ment is singularly unilluminating. But,
there is a point to it. Philosophy is an
activity; it is something that people do.
In this respect, philosophy does not
differ from mathematics, physics, psy-
chology, history, anthropology, and a
whole host of other intellectual activ-
ities. A physicist doesn't just study the
subject matter of physics, he does phy-
sics. An historian doesn't just study the
subject matter of history, he does his-
tory. Similarly, a philosopher doesn't
just study the subject matter of phi-
losophy, he does philosophy.
Two questions arise at this point:
(a) What is the subject matter of phi-
losophy? and (b) What does one do
when he does philosophy? That is,
what sort of activity is characteristic of
philosophy? Let us consider these ques-
tions one at a time.
What is the subject matter of phi-
losophy? The answer to this question
is everything. All of our experience, all
our beliefs, all our values, everything
that we claim to know or hope to find
out is the proper subject matter of
philosophy.
Traditionally, the subject matter of
philosophy has been broken down into
four very general areas. I am going to
list these areas in the order that is
most convenient for me, and it should
not be taken that I am implying that
any of these areas is more important
than any other.
Four General Areas
First is theory of knowledge. Sup-
pose you awakened one morning with
a rather severe pain in your leg. You
can hardly walk, so you have some-
one drive you over to Health Service.
Well, on this particular day there is
a rather strange doctor on duty who re-
fuses to treat anybody who claims to
be in pain until he can establish with
certainty that the person is really in
pain.
You sit down on the examination
table and proceed to tell this doctor
your story. The doctor then tells you
that he never takes anybody's word for
anything and that you will have to con-
vince him beyond all doubt. Right
about now you'd like to ask this doc-
tor if he's some kind of nut, but you
figure you can hold out until the men

The question of why an engineer
should study literature involves first
the question of why he should study
anything besides engineering. A basic
reason is that any subject is most im-
portant in helping us understand other
things, each specialty contributing in-
formation that seems important itself,
but also illuminating other specialties
and thus our general ideas about man
and the world he lives in. Then, a basic
reason for studying literature is that
it is perhaps the one best way to study
everything in general, to appreciate
the questions that, in one form or an-
other, always confront mankind.
The Purposes of Knowledge
The modern university presents a
paradox. It collects and dispenses more
and more highly specialized knowledge
as a means to the overall end of im-
proving generally ourselves and the
world or culture we live in. While
many a specialist will justify his pur-
suit of any bit of data for its own
sake, he will likely value other special-
ties as they contribute to our general
knowledge.
Indeed, all the specialization pro-
moted by science is only a means to
arrive at general theories and laws, and
even that knowledge is not entirely its
own end, as scientists will often main-
tain. Instead, its purpose must be its
human use. It is too idealistic to be-
lieve that anything is either just means
or end in human society. Any activity
is both means and ends, and we de-
partmentalize at our convenience, but
also at our peril. Witness how discon-
certed scientists become when an abuse
of knowledge appears serious, when the
annihilation of cities or civilizations is
at stake, or even the possibility of hu-
man mutations, birth defects, or short-
ened life. And so we have the pheno-
menon of Einstein wishing that he had
been a plumber. Whether or not the
scientist wishes to consider human pur-
poses, humanity as a whole certainly
must. If it is only in this human capa-
city that scientists become concerned
with the uses and abuses of knowledge,
at least they illustrate the importance
of intelligent concern.
So, if human import is important,
there is a great need for the kinds of
study that relate knowledge to human

good, that is, the humanities, although
in an academic atmosphere there is
danger that much of history or philos-
ophy, fine arts or literature, will be
sacrificed to a method that does not
suit some kinds of knowledge, merely
so it can be conveniently codified, col-
lated, and proclaimed about. But re-
gardless of this academic specialization,
literature itself, as a vital, comprehen-
sive study of life, can be an imperative
corrective because it can study man
without dehumanizing him, making
data of him, and thus can clarify the
human relevance of what we know.
The Purpose of Engineering
James B. Conant has pointed out
that medicine can be seriously malprac-
ticed if serving a vicious view of human
purposes, as when the Nazis subverted
medical skill to inhuman ends, tortur-
ing and destroying victims of their
political purposes. Today we are still
debating whether or not we were wise
to use atomic bombs against Japan.
Many people think we subverted scien-
tific and engineering skill much as the
Nazis did medical skill. Furthermore,
we may become so obsessed with mak-
ing, selling, and running machinery
that we make ourselves just a means
to that end. The danger is that man
serves the machine, devising and oper-
ating machinery merely to produce
more gadgets and machinery, instead
of being served by machinery to free
himself from trouble and labor so he
can attend to other purposes besides
creature comforts. In short, engineering
is an indispensable means to special
ends, but it should not crowd out ex-
amination of those ends.
The Whole Man, a Cultural Objective
The question is not an "either-or"
one, of whether we should embrace en-
gineering instead of music, for instance,
but rather that we should emphasize
both and exclude neither. We are con-
stantly criticized by all kinds of foreign-
ers, who may have a perspective on us
that we cannot get very well ourselves,
for materialistically placing so much
emphasis on engineering and business,
that is, industrialism. Yet foreigners
covet and emulate our industrialization,
so perhaps they should criticize instead
our lack of concern for other things.

it need not prevent us, unless we are
obsessed with it, from being a well-
rounded society. An engineer can read-
ily see as more or less of a caricature
of a whole man somebody who is noth-
ing at all but a musician and probably
also has a sneaking suspicion that if
he can qualify as nothing but an en-
gineer he too is a diminished sort of
person missing a good deal. A good
doctor may not be much of a person,
although, while he may be invaluable
as a good doctor, presumably it is to
serve us as persons. It probably is not
very important to have good doctors
if they cannot serve good persons. A
good society, emphasizing engineering,
medicine, and music, but none exclu-
sively, must be composed of good per-
sons, who may as necessary specialists
serve the good of each other, but are
also worth being served. Worthwhile
people are as fully developed in as
many ways as possible. They realize
appreciably their potentials of being
complete individuals. This concept, of
course, is idealistic. We are all some-
what lopsided and have to tolerate
human limitations, although maybe
some weaknesses are not wholly amiss
in a good society if balanced by the
genuine tolerance that they can call
forth. The ideal—which can always
guide realistic practice even if we never
altogether attain it—is the ancient
Greek one of cultivating a sound mind
in a sound body—a complete, balanced
person. Similarly, the Renaissance ideal
of a person was a gracious courtier, an
intellectual scholar, and a bold soldier
all in one.
A famous example of the Renais-
sance man was Sir Walter Raleigh,
who reputedly spread his cloak over
a puddle so Queen Elizabeth could
keep her feet dry, and who remains
a literary figure for his sincere lyrics
and passages of great historical prose,
and who also founded the colony of
Virginia, explored in South America,
participated in the defeat of the Span-
ish Armada and later, as an admiral,
in an attack on the Azores. As a states-
man in a day of courtly intrigues, he
was in and out of favor with monarchs.
Elizabeth imprisoned him because she
was jealous of his love for a lady-in-
waiting, and James I beheaded him
for alleged treason, giving Raleigh the
chance to die magnificently, showing
himself a spirited, cultivated, coura-
geous complete gentleman. The model
of the time for personal nobility, for
versatility with integrity, was Sir Philip
Sidney, active in politics and military
exploits and renowned as poet and
critic. His fame as a perfect gentleman
meant more to his generation than any
particular accomplishment, illustrated
by the wide popularity of the story that,
when mortally wounded in battle, he
gave his last drink of water to a dying
soldier, saying, "Thy necessity is greater
than mine."
Another of these comprehensive souls
was Sir Francis Bacon, member of Par-
liament, Attorney-General and later
Lord Chancellor. Not unlike some mod-
ern politicians, he imprudently accept-
ed gifts that could be construed as in-
volving him in a conflict of interest.
He confessed, lost his offices, retired,
and died from a chill caught conduct-
ing experiments on the effects of re-
frigerating animal tissue. Bacon, an
ambitious student and thinker, said,
"I have taken all knowledge to be my
province," yet he marks a departure.
He is the new man of the later Ren-
aissance, an aggressive individualist
who questions all the general knowl-
edge and universal wisdom of the past
and advocates inductive observation of
particular facts. With his point of view,
modern science commences in England.
Discarding traditional wisdom as a
guide to noble action, he is a single-
minded, laborious, realistic observer of
special facts and circumstances. He has
less of the noble nature of the whole
man, like Sidney, and is more the eager
specialist emphasizing the way to gain
knowledge accurately. And another
type of specialist becoming very prom-
inent at the time was the Puritan, a
rather narrow specialist in morality,
again an eager individualist on the rise,
perhaps compensating for his lack in
well-rounded composure of Sidney's
type by overemphasizing his peculiar
specialty.
As John Crowe Ransom points out,
the Puritan was only the first of many
kinds of modern specialists, trying to
be extremely expert in some extremely
narrow, "pure" area, as in "pure sci-
ence" or "pure poetry," but losing a
good deal of general significance in
the process. Frank O'Connor, the Irish
short story writer, said of another Irish
short story writer, James Joyce, that
while his stories show him an expert
in examining the subconscious sources
of language, yet as a specialist he is
a bore. The specialist has been called
a bore by other Europeans who prize,
perhaps more than we do, the culture
that a people need to have in common.
A people are a community in their
habitual attitudes and cherished beliefs
and all the customary assumptions that
help make up a way of life. We need
not be unrealistic about the undeniable
facts of matters, but our ideals for our-
selves, our hopes about what should
be, as well as our knowledge of what
is, determine what we do and what we
become. For better or for worse, we are
very much what we think we are and
can be, as individuals and societies. We
can improve what we most essentially
are by improving our minds and spirits,
by using knowledge to that end, rather
than being so preoccupied with methods
of accumulating it that we do not know
what to do with it, or do not know
what to do when there is no scientific
data to the point.
The Humanistic Purposes of Literature
What is the alternative? It has al-
ready been suggested it might well be
literature, which has served such pur-
poses throughout history. For instance,
the Renaissance humanists, before mod-
ern specialization committed us to end-
less sorting of factual minutiae, avidly
ransacked the literary storehouse of
ancient classical culture to find virtues
to live by. They considered their own
religious faith a guide that could be
supplemented by the reasoned wisdom
of the highly developed civilizations
of Greece and Rome. Stimulated by
ancient literature, they produced a stim-
ulating and sound literature of their
own, of which Shakespeare's work was
the crowning glory and still stands as
one of the most penetrating and dur-
able studies of mankind by man.
Shakespeare illuminates the vital pro-
pensities of man, his capacities for love,
hate, fear, loyalty, and viciousness in
such variety of form and in such au-
thentic relation and sequence that the

SALUTE: MARTIN CAWLEY
When Martin Cawley joined Illinois Bell Telephone Com-
pany a year and a half ago, he immediately was assigned
to a job in the Building Engineer's Group. This work
involved preparing plans and specifications for remodeling
several floors of an important telephone office building,
and following details of the field work until the job was
completed. A lot of responsibility, but he handled it well

and earned an assignment as Project Engineer. Now he
handles still more complex building projects, each contrib-
uting to better telephone service for Chicago.

Progress

New Tape Units To Monitor Pilot-To-
Tower Talk: This bank of eight new
tape recording units was recently in-
stalled at the Federal Aviation Agen-
cy's Atlanta, Georgia, Air Route Traf-
fic Control Center. It will monitor all
pilot-to-tower conversations in the area
on a 24-hour basis. The U.S. averages
572 of these conversations per minute
around the clock. These new units can
record and store thousands of hours of
air to ground conversation in a mini-
mum of space. This is due to their
capacity for recording on 22 channels
simultaneously, with the low playing
speed of 15 16 inch per second. The
installation is designed to help solve
the critical air traffic control problem.

Quartz crystals are used in radio and
television transmitters, telephone com-

Moon Visitor: Surveyor is a space-probe
that is shooting for the moon. At left
is a full scale model of a Surveyor
spacecraft, a similar unit will make a
soft landing on the moon late this year.
Seven Surveyors are being built for the
National Aeronautics and Space Ad-
ministration's Jet Propulsion Labora-
tory. When the Surveyor lands on the
moon it will send back as much infor-
mation about the moon as possible.
The man at left is examining a probe
that will measure the moon's surface
characteristics.
The Surveyor Project is representa-
tive of the fast growing space field.
The rapid expansion in this field pre-
sents unprecedented opportunities to
the graduating engineer. Space projects
involve so many new concepts, tech-
niques, and materials that graduates of
all degree levels can immediately work
usefully with industry's senior scientists
in meeting the problems of the rapidly
changing technology.
Written Messages Via Phone: PHONE-
WRITERS, a new type of telewriters,
now make it possible to send written
messages over regular local or long dis-
tance phone lines. The Phonewriter at-
tachments (transmitter upper right and
receiver lower right) afford the user a
combination of two-way written and
verbal communication. By simply dial-
ing in the normal way the user can
either talk or write or do both with a
single call. It is also possible for him
to send written messages to unattended
receivers, providing in effect a person
to person telegraph service.
The Phonewriter will enable execu-
tives, engineers, salesmen or anyone to
deliver handwritten or sketched infor-
mation instantaneously from one loca-
tion to another. It is designed to utilize
both prepared forms and plain paper
and can also make carbon copies. The
Phonewriter took two years to develop.
The chief technical problem was to
fllBiiP' •


develop a system that assured satisfac-
tory transmission of handwritten mes-
sages over all of the many types of tel-
ephone circuits. However the process
of transmitting handwritten messages
over wires is an old one. The first pat-
ent for such a device was issued in
1876. It was soon followed by several
variations, both in America and Eng-
land.

DEVELOPMENT
CENTER
• This vast, 217-acre complex of test cells and
modern laboratories is the Allison Division, Re-
search and Development Center in Indianapolis.
Here, Allison scientists and engineers are pursu-
ing numerous challenging and exciting research
projects involving power and propulsion systems
of the next generation.
Facilities at Allison's R&amp;D Center include a high
altitude chamber capable of simulating altitudes up
to nearly 200 miles. Presently the chamber is a
prime data source for studies relating to magneto-
fluiddynamics and the environmental simulation of
space radiators.
Allison's Rocket Propulsion Facility includes
laboratories for rocket motor and nozzle testing.
An 18 x 64-foot rocket propulsion chamber is ca-
pable of testing up to 1000 pounds of either solid or
liquid propellant at 25,000 pounds thrust.
Rocket propulsion nozzles can be tested over a
thrust range of 100 to 25,000 pounds in the nozzle
test facility. In the nearby combustion laboratory,
engineers can study the internal characteristics of
gas turbine nozzles. Here compressed air can be
supplied at pressures up to 270 psia, with exhaust
pressures simulating altitudes from sea level to
75,000 feet—an available pressure ratio of more
than 500 to one.
Latest addition to this phase of our research pro-
gram is the solid fuel rocket static test firing pad in
a remote section of the R&amp;D Center. Designed and
built by Allison to accommodate rocket thrusts up
to 12,750 pounds, this new facility is being used for
evaluation and perfection of such current projects
as space vehicle and attitude control systems, and
advanced rocket nozzles. Provisions are incorpo-
rated to apply varying degrees of yaw, pitch and
roll—conditions that are corrected by the attitude
control system to demonstrate its ability to keep a
missile or space vehicle on its programmed course.
Of course, these are only a few of the faculties
and research projects at Allison. There's a labora-
tory for virtually any requirement—physical optics,
radio-isotope, infra-red, solid state physics, physical
chemistry, direct conversion, heat transfer, fluid
dynamics, to name a few.
And the story doesn't end here. The Allison
Scientific Advisory Board, American and European
consultants, and the vast resources of the entire
General Motors organization also support Allison's
efforts.
These extensive facilities plus research work un-
derway and nearly half a century of experience in
energy conversion represent the capabilities which
Allison is harnessing in its contribution to the
aerospace needs of the future.

News For Hay Fever Sufferers
Three meteorologists from the De-
partment of Engineering Mechanics
have developed a means of predicting
how bad the annual hay fever season
will be. The three, James B. Harring-
ton, Jr., Edward S. Epstein and A. Nel-
son Dingle, used the weather reports
and pollen counts of the last 16 years
plus probability theory and a computer
to find certain weather factors that
make pretty fair hay fever predictors.
For their predictors the meteorolo-
gists turned to the phenology of rag-
weed. Phenology is the science of the
relationships between the climate and
periodic biological events, e.g., how
weather conditions effect the annual
growth of a plant. Ragweed is one
of the most powerful producers of hay
fever.
Their examinations showed that tem-
perature, rainfall and soil moisture
were key elements in ragweed's produc-
tion of pollen. A warm rainy May and
a relatively dry July tend to increase
the concentration of pollen. They sus-
pect this is because 90 per cent of the
ragweed grows where cereal grains
grow, and they compete for moisture.
Their data indicates that warm
weather and abundant rain in May-
helps the shallow sprouting ragweed to
grow more than the deeper seeded
competing grains. Also that a dry July
favors ragweed, which has by this time
developed a deeper taproot and can
draw upon deep soil moisture, while
the dryness inhibits the shallower-
rooted grains.
Pollen data for their study was
gathered from a Durham pollen sampl-
er operated consistently over a 16-year
period in Ann Arbor. This data along
with significant weather data was in-
serted into an equation to determine
the probability of a pollen yield under
certain weather conditions, and the re-
sulting complex mathematics was
solved on an IBM 709 computer.
With improved pollen data-gathering
techniques, the meteorologists plan to
improve their long range forecasting
of such things as the peak season date,
the mid season date, the period of
highest pollen yield and the length of
the hay fever season. Currently day by
day pollen levels can be predicted from
meteorological factors with reasonable
precision once the season has started.
Michigan Leads
In fiscal 1961 The University of
Michigan again topped the list of De-
partment of Defense prime contract re-
cipients among educational institutions
which do not operate federal facilities.
During the year, 820 undergraduate
and 1301 graduate students participat-
ed in the sponsored research projects,
and 318 doctoral candidates used proj-
ect work in the preparation of their
theses. In addition 401 faculty members
advanced their teaching capability
through participation in sponsored re-
search during the academic year, as did
463 during the summer.
Again, as the year before, the Uni-
versity ranked among the highest ten
per cent of all recipients of Depart-
ment of Defense prime contracts.
Among non-profit institutions, the top
seven were Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity, Aerospace Corporation, Mitre Cor-

Electronic Device Helps Keep
Radio Messages Secret
From the Cooly Electronics Labora-
tory comes a new device that will keep
radio communications secret, improve
radio direction finding and aid air navi-
gation. The device, called a "discrete
frequency synthesizer," was developed
by a group of engineers headed by Dr.
Thomas W. Butler, Jr. and sponsored
by the Signal Corps.
The device permits rapid frequency
hopping. Both receiver and transmit-
ter jump quickly from frequency to
frequency, always in unison but in an
apparently random manner.
This is roughly analogous to both the
operator of the transmitter and the
operator of the receiver each rapidly
pushing station-selection buttons in an
apparently haphazard way. Both how-
ever push exactly the same button at
exactly the same time so that the trans-
mission is received without interrup-
tion.
An eavesdropper, on the other hand,
would find it virtually impossible to
catch continuously the right frequency
at the right time.
The seemingly randomness of selec-
tion is a result of a technique called
pseudorandom generation in which an
apparently pattern-less sequency is de-
vised by a computer. While a person
without the "key" would be able to
detect no pattern to the frequency hop-
ping, both transmitter and receiver can
be given the pattern on a punched card
in advance so they might begin at the
proper frequency and switch in unison
with one another.
With this device, these frequency
changes can be made up to about half
a million times per second. This speed
of switching frequencies is the result
of using a diode that varies capaci-
tance. This eliminates the need for me-
chanical tuning. Electronic tuning also
permits a very high degree of accuracy,
one part in one hundred million.

Discrete Frequency Synthesizer developed for the Signal Corps in the Cooley
Electronics Laboratory.
The device is built entirely with sol-
id - state components, such as the diode
(or such as transistors). This allows it
to be small, light, inexpensive and elec-
trically simple. Another advantage is
that there are no moving parts.
For direction finding, the discrete
frequency synthesizer system would be
helpful in eliminating the need for op-
erators to be located at receivers sta-
tioned some distance from the central
control because these remote receivers
could be tuned precisely and automat-
ically through telephone cables.
In "omnirange" navigation systems,
presently used in almost all aircraft, a
course is flown by following specific
navigation radio beacons. After each
beacon station, located at intervals of
several miles all over the country, is
passed, the plane's pilot or navigator
must switch stations to pick up his next
check point. Use of a pre-programmed,
automatic station-switching device,
would eliminate the pilot's having to
re-tune his radio every few minutes.
Often, too, the pilot must check with
stations to the side of his flight path
for course corrections. This too could
be done automatically.
Finally, the discrete frequency syn-
thesizer would help relieve crowded
cockpit conditions by allowing the ra-
dio and tuning equipment to be moved
to some less-cramped part of the air-
craft, as the pilot or navigator would
need only to insert the proper program
and turn on the radio at the beginning
of the flight. Further adjustments
would not be necessary, allowing him
to concentrate on his other tasks.
Ford Foundation Grant
The University of Michigan has re-
ceived a $100,000 grant from the Ford
Foundation as part of a five-year, $8
million program of loans and aid to
doctoral students preparing to be en-
gineering teachers. Michigan was one
of ten schools to receive the maximum
amount granted in the foundation's
effort to help meet a growing shortage
of qualified engineering teachers.
The grant to the University was part
of the program's first stage in which
about $2.8 million was distributed
among 42 schools and departments of
engineering for "forgivable" loans over
the next two years.
Students who complete their doc-
torates may "write off" the loans at a
rate of $1,000 or 20 per cent of the
total owed, whichever is greater, for
every year of their service on an Ameri-
can or Canadian engineering faculty.
The loans are designed to bring into
engineering teaching graduates who,
usually because of family responsibili-
ties, require more support in advanced
training than conventional fellowships
or their personal resources can provide,
the foundation said.

teaching career. Qualified students may
receive up to $10,000 each over a
three year period.
The new foundation program incor-
porates features developed in two earli-
er series of experimental grants that
have provided student-aid funds for
more than 300 doctoral candidates pre-
paring for teaching careers.

Sloan Foundation Awards
"Creative thinking cannot be fore-
cast or put on a production schedule,"
Alfred P. Sloan observed as his Sloan
Foundation awarded $1.3 million in
basic research grants to 83 outstanding
young university scientists in the Unit-
ed States and Canada.
Three of the recipients are Univer-
sity of Michigan faculty members:
Robert E. Ireland, and R. Martin Stiles
of the Chemistry Department, and
Donat G. Wentzel, an astrophysicist in
the Department of Astronomy. Dr.
Stiles is continuing research began
under a 1961 grant.
"It is essential that scientists who
have the potential for creativity also
have the freedom, the time, and the
funds to explore their own ideas in the
search for new knowledge," Sloan
noted.
The Sloan Foundation Basic Re-
search Program supports "people rath-
er than projects." Recipients may pur-
sue pure research of their own choice
and may publish their results as they
choose.

FORGED to end field failures
This forging forms the critical stress-bearing
segment of the turnpost on which a rugged hy-
draulic loader rotates. It must withstand the sud-
den high-magnitude stresses transmitted by the
17-foot boom, even in the bitter cold of northern
winter logging operations. It replaced a less de-
pendable part that had caused costly breakdowns
in the field. By converting to forgings, the manu-
facturer ended turnpost failures.
Why did the designer look to forgings for
superior strength and reliability? Because forged
parts start with refined metals, uniform through-
out. By hot-working this superior stock between
precision dies in forging hammers or presses, the
structure of the metal is improved even further.
That's why forgings offer unique opportunities to
improve strength-weight ratios and reduce pro-
duction costs.
Forged parts withstand the landing impact of
jet aircraft, yet are light and strong. They help
restrain the tremendous temperatures and pres-
sures involved in modern missile technology; im-
prove the performance of vital automotive parts.
Forgings enhance the safety factor of our high-
speed world.
Research projects sponsored by the forging in-
dustry and its suppliers will increase even further
the ability of forgings to endure the extremes of
temperature and the greater stresses inherent in
the engineering challenges of tomorrow.

forged parts. Write for documented case studies
of forged parts converted, at a saving, from less
satisfactory higher cost processes. Address: Drop

MECHANICAL ENGINEERS
IN A
CHEMICAL COMPANY?
True, we do employ a number of chemists and
chemical engineers at Du Pont. But our need for
mechanical engineers is just as urgent. In fact, the
ratio of MEs to CHEs at Du Pont is 10:17.
Why? Well, we need mechanical engineers to
build new plants, equip and operate them. We need
them, too, to design and build equipment and to
develop new processes.
Just as important, we need mechanical engi-
neers to help us improve our present manufactur-
ing processes, which are constantly under study.
How can we operate more efficiently, more
economically? How can we better our products?
Mechanical engineers play an important role in
supplying the answers.
In a company the size of Du Pont—with annual
sales of $2,000,000,000, investment in plant and
equipment of another $2,000,000,000 and research
expenditures of $90,000,000 a year—there's a
wealth of opportunity for the mechanical engineer.
Just as there is for engineers of almost every
specialty—and for chemists, physicists and math-
ematicians, too.

have meant any symbol, object, re-
sponse, quality, or process which can
be isolated as a unit or unity, a "pure"
totality or Gestalt. The art object (sym-
bol), sensitively observed, produces an
emotional response which is the art
experience. And this experience is a
Thing-in-Itself.
Here we encounter "trouble" with
talk of art, for such experience is sub-
jective, not pragmatic, not translatable
into verbal (or other) symbols. If,
indeed, a highly sensitive, creative,
and technically skilled person (an art-
ist) does translate his art experience in-
to another combination of symbols of
whatever kind, we have at best an
analogy or metaphor which is itself a
Thing-in-Itself, a new art object cap-
able of arousing a new experience,
similar, perhaps, but distinct from that
aroused by the art object which en-
gendered it.
Art Isolates
In short, the art experience is unique.
No one can share it. The fruits can
be shared (pragmatic "uses"), but
when the individual "feels," he is
alone. Could this be why, in spite of
the abundance of art around us, we
choose to label quickly, file away me-
chanically, chatter of Michaelangelo,
and call whatever we do "appreciating"
art? He who cherishes the art experi-
ence is an isolate during the "act." He's
not a snob or a misfit—he's being deep-
ly and genuinely an individual.
More than that, of course, for any-
one merely daydreaming, piecing to-
gether fragments of memories, or,
rather, letting such fragments follow
one another according to some non-
rational (undisciplined or uncontrol-
lable) chain of association, is being
"genuinely" individual—and genuinely
isolated (to a lesser degree, naturally,
but in the manner of a psychotic). The
art observer differs from the daydream-
er in that he is not actually alone but
is in communion with the best product
of a great human being—and by "best"
I mean a product begot by emotion but
born of reason. The work of the great
artist is an ordered experience. By some
(Continued from page 19)
process or processes yet to be dis-
covered or defined, the artist has been
able to bring the force of reason
(would "irrational reason" sound too
paradoxical?) upon the chaos of ex-
perience, and to communicate the strug-
gle and the victory to those sensitive
enough to receive. When, chronologi-
cally and geographically, enough people
have proved themselves "sensitive" to
a given art object, we talk grandly of
"universality" and of Mankind's
Achievements. We are in communica-
tion with Mankind, with Humanity at
its peak, its apotheosis.
Undemocratic
If all of this sounds lofty and un-
democratic, I've made a necessary if
distasteful point—Art is aristocratic. It
is not, in its best forms, available to
all men. This or that about it can be
grasped by almost anyone, and is, and
lesser, derivative manifestations abound
in our daily lives, but the ultimate art
experience is reserved for those highly-
tuned individuals who are willing to
be individuals—and this takes courage
in our Age of Togetherness.
Courage is needed, moreover, for
more than meeting one's friends with
their looks of having been "rejected";
it is needed to face the shock of art.
Art is beautiful, to be sure, but the
word "beautiful" means more than easy
pleasure, more than mere sentimental-
ity, decoration, momentary relief from
boredom. The art object is the result of
a great conflict, of unbearable tension.
It itself sets up a tension, resolving the
tension, yes, but most precariously, with
a balance so delicate, so subtle, as to
break repeatedly to resolve again. That
art, however technically perfect, de-
lightful, or charming, which settles
conflicts (and it usually chooses easy
ones) resolutely, permanently, is spe-
cious art, common art, the sort the
good teacher seeks to expose as mean-
ingless, imitative, and cheap.
Why? Because the infinite symbols
and their interrelationships affect us
emotionally, even physically, just as
surely as do "real" things. When the
"natural" or "real" world affects us,
we can or cannot do something about
it—bask in the sun, get out of the rain,
bridge a stream, or resign ourselves to
the inevitable. But when the prolificacy
of our brain confronts us with chaos,
we can counter successfully only with
reason and with that reason beyond
conscious control—the non-rational,
the intuitive. To blind ourselves to
such a conflict, or to enter it with paste
and stereotypes, with the first-at-hand,
the meretricious, is to be less the man—
the ostrich with his sand and the fish
with his fly do just as well.
Art Resensitizes
I've put this matter rather darkly.
Art delights as well as shocks. And,
above all, it makes us aware, alive. The
ordinary struggle of life forces us to
build up crippling defenses—callouses
and cataracts; we build up an insensi-
tivity to shield us from harm. Art re-
sensitizes our receptive organs, excites
our imagination, sets up conflicts, re-
solves them, and leaves us better
equipped to confront the unknown and
our fellowmen. We become more fully
human—more greatly humane.
And Synthesizes
Art is man's answer to the irony of
his brain's capacity for symbolization.
The "real," metamorphosed by the
brain into that which it isn't and into
more than it is, leads to science which
releases time and space which is used
by the brain to generate devils as well
as angels. By synthesizing the devils
and the angels into the ambiguous, the
ambivalent, and the paradoxical, the
artist creates a tentatively balanced,
briefly resolved harmony—the art ob-
ject. He offers us his solution. To the
degree that he is great enough to con-
tribute to the best conception of Man-
kind and to the degree that we are part
of and avowedly committed to Man-
kind, we accept his solution with pain,
delight, and gratitude.
The academic study of art is but an
artificial, remedial process hopefully
leading to the enrichment of the indi-
vidual's art experience, an experience
wholly his own and its own end.

"Look doctor," you argue, "why
don't you just twist my leg a little and
watch my reaction? Surely, my re-
sponses will prove to you that I am in
pain."
The doctor gives you a look that
makes you feel pretty stupid, and then
goes on to say that no behavioral or
physiological responses prove that you
are feeling pain. Behavioral responses
are sometimes faked, and physiological
responses are only correlated with feel-
ings of pain because the people who
have them have said they were in pain.
If you can imagine someone who feels
pain but doesn't have any of the be-
havioral or physiological correlates,
then you can imagine someone who has
all the correlates but doesn't feel any
pain. If I really knew that you were
in pain, then I couldn't be mistaken,
but since it is always possible for me
to be mistaken I can never really know
that you are in pain. We cannot see
another person's pain in the way that
we can see his face, or his wife, or his
car; we can never feel another person's
pain in the way that we can feel his
pulse. It's not hard to imagine a child
brought up by very cleverly built auto-
mata that are programmed to respond
to external stimuli and to questions in
just the way that people do. This child
will learn to use pain language correct-
ly, but will always be mistaken when
he thinks that one of his "friends" is
in pain. None of us can be certain that
he is not in the situation of that child.
That other people are in pain when
they behave in a certain way is but one
of the many things that we take for
granted in everyday life. The philoso-
pher, however, does not even take this
simple proposition for granted. There
are many assumptions of just this sort
at the very foundations of all our sci-
entific knowledge. Scientists are con-
tinually questioning the scientific as-
sumptions on which the structure of
their science rests. Philosophers who
are interested in the theory of knowl-
edge are continually questioning the
more primitive assumptions on which
(Continued from page 21)
these scientific assumptions themselves
rest.
Metaphysical Questions
The second area of the subject mat-
ter of philosophy is metaphysics. Con-
sider for a moment that our bodies are
constantly changing. From the day that
a child is born until the day that he
dies, he continually undergoes physio-
logical and psychological change. We
begin life as very small, almost para-
sitic organisms, grow up into strong
and resourceful adults, and end up with
hardening of the physical and intellec-
tual arteries.
Throughout this time, every single
cell in our body has died and been re-
placed an astronomical number of
times. Given all this information, we
can ask the following question: In vir-
tue of what are we the same person at
one time in our life as we are at an-
other? We don't have the same body
cells, our thoughts are different, we
may have lost an arm or a leg, we may
even have had plastic surgery done to
our face and had our fingerprints re-
moved. Only the name remains the
same, and we can change that, too.
What, then, is it about us that makes
us say that we are the same person as
the one that was born a few years ago,
went off to school, and is now at the
University of Michigan?
Our first attempt at answering such
a strange question might be to say that
we are the same person in virtue of
having the same memories. Continuity
of memory, then, is the basis for con-
tinuity of personality. This answer,
however, overlooks the possibility that
one person might have another per-
son's memories. It might be quite odd,
but is it logically impossible for me to
wake up some morning with all of
Napoleon's memories and none of my
own? Would I then be Napoleon? Of
course not.
The problem of the continuity or
sameness of personality is closely con-
nected with the more general problem
of what a person is. This problem can
be stated by asking the question "To
what does the personal pronoun T re-
fer?" Does the pronoun "I" refer to
a certain body that satisfies a particu-
lar set of space-time coordinates? Does
it refer to a conscious thing that
thinks? Does it refer to a particular
set of memories which are related in a
certain way? Perhaps it refers to noth-
ing at all.
The problem of the nature and con-
tinuity of the self is but one of the
many "intellectual cramps" that have
bothered philosophers for many years.
These metaphysical questions are not
the sort of questions that science can
answer, simply because they cannot be
meaningfully asked in science. If one
attempts to give a scientific answer to
a metaphysical question, he misunder-
stands the question. This is also true
the other way around. If one attempts
to give a metaphysical answer to a sci-
entific question, he misunderstands the
question.
Considerations of length make it im-
possible for me to distinguish clearly
between scientific and metaphysical
questions in this article. Some of the
questions which I have raised above are
examples of metaphysical questions. I
should like to give you one more ex-
ample of this sort of question.
Most of us are quite familiar with
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. We can
refer to it, we can talk about it, we
can hear it performed, and we can like
it or dislike it. But what is Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony? What do we refer
to, what do we talk about, what are
we listening to, what do we like or
dislike? Is Beethoven's Ninth Sym-
phony the original manuscript that
Beethoven wrote? If it were, then by
burning that manuscript we could pre-
sumably destroy the Ninth Symphony.
But this is absurd. If Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony were just the original manu-
script, then none of the performances
which we have thought were of this
symphony really were, since they were
not performances of the original manu-
script. Note also, that we don't per-
form manuscripts we perform sym-
phonies. Thus, Beethoven's Ninth Sym-
phony is not the original manuscript
that Beethoven wrote.
(Continued on page 42)
MARCH, 1962
41


phony is a particular performance. But
a particular performance of the Ninth
Symphony may be bad, and we
wouldn't want to say from this that
the Ninth Symphony is bad.
Well, suppose the Ninth Symphony
is an idea in Beethoven's mind. Since
Beethoven is dead and no longer has
an idea, we would have to say that the
Ninth Symphony is no longer in exist-
ence.
What I have done here is to sketch
several of the possible answers that can
be given to the question "What is Beet-
hoven's Ninth Symphony?" and to sug-
gest a criticism of each of them. The
question "What is Beethoven's Ninth
Symphony?" (as a metaphysical ques-
tion and not a question about music)
must be taken as the question "To
what does the expression 'Beethoven's
Ninth Symphony' refer?" This ques-
tion cannot be answered by science any
more than the question of whether
there is life on Mars can be answered
by philosophy.
The Area of Logic
The third area of the philosopher's
subject matter is logic. This area in-
cludes the problems of switching
theory as applied to the design of auto-
mata, the problems of formal axiomatic
systems, and the problems of what is
ordinarily called "correct reasoning."
Most people use the word "logic" to
refer to the system of rules that impli-
citly govern correct thinking. Let us
employ this sense of logic in order to
exhibit one of the problems that would
come under logic in the broader sense.
Consider "2 plus 2 equals 4." We
can take this symbolic expression to
be an elementary theorem of arithme-
tic. Now, the question arises as to
whether there is any relationship be-
tween the theorems of arithmetic and
logic in the narrow sense.
One view has it that arithmetic is a
branch of logic since all the theorems
of arithmetic can be reduced to theo-
rems involving only logical concepts
and the rules governing logical con-
cepts. According to this view, there is
no difference between arithmetic and
logic except one of practical conven-
ience. Another view maintains that
arithmetic is the science of the formal
structure of symbols, and as such is not
reducible to logic. A third view main-
tains that there is no relationship be-
tween the theorems of arithmetic and
those of logic, since arithmetic rests on
a basic intuition of the possibility of
constructing an infinite series of num-
bers.
We cannot here go into the various
arguments for and against these views
on the nature of arithmetic. My point
in listing them has been merely to show
by way of example the sort of subject
matter that comes under the heading
of logic in general.
Theory of Value
The fourth and last general area of
the subject matter of philosophy is
theory of value. This area includes, per-
haps, the broadest range of subject
matter in philosophy. The domain of
theory of value is our social, political,
moral, and aesthetic values. What argu-
ments can we give for saying that
democracy is better than totalitarian-
ism? Are they good arguments? Are
there any good arguments for saying
that one course of action is right and
another course is wrong? Are rights
privileges granted by authority, or do
they somehow stem from and find
their justification in the moral relations
between the individuals who make up
a society? Where do rights come from
anyway? What are obligations? What
is a moral judgment? What is demo-
cracy?
Suppose that two people are looking
at a painting or a piece of sculpture.
One says that the painting or sculpture
is good and the other says that it's bad.
Who is right? I know you want to say
that it's a matter of opinion, but so is
the question of whether surgery is
necessary in the case of certain ill-
nesses. That something is a matter of
opinion, that is, of judgment, does not
imply that we cannot give rational ar-
guments for our judgments. That some-
thing is a matter of opinion does not
imply that we cannot give good reason
for the opinions that we hold. The
problem of good reasons is one of the
central problems in the theory of value.
The Essence of Philosophy
Let us now turn to the second of our
two original questions. What activity is
characteristic of philosophy? Before I
try to answer this question, we'd better
see just what sort of answer the ques-
tion demands. If we were to ask a doc-
tor for the characteristic activity of
medicine, what might he reply? If he
had a good sense of humor he might
say that the characteristic activity of
medicine is passing out pills, but that
wouldn't answer our question. What
would? I suppose we might agree that
the characteristic activity of medicine
is that of applying the principles of
virology, serology, physiology, and
anatomy, among other things, to actual
cases of sickness for the purpose of
making and keeping people healthy.
Similarly, we might say that the char-
acteristic activity of engineering is that
of applying the abstract principles of
mathematics, physics, and chemistry to
concrete cases of problem solving for
the purpose of mastering nature and
controlling our environment.
What about philosophy? It seems to
me that the characteristic activity of
philosophy is that of formulating the
abstract principles which provide the
conceptual foundation of all our intel-
lectual activities. We might say that
these principles are what make the dif-
ference between a chaotic sequence of
experiences and a structured body of
physical and social knowledge. The
principles that philosophers are con-
tinually formulating, accepting, and re-
jecting, are those that make physical
and social science possible. They are
the principles on which every physical
and social science ultimately rests.
One question remains to be an-
swered. How does a philosopher go
about carrying out this peculiar ac-
tivity? This question I cannot answer
any more than a doctor could tell you
how to make people healthy or an engi-
neer could tell you how to build a "do-
it-yourself" suspension bridge. This is
why we have medical schools, colleges
of engineering, and departments of
philosophy. If you want to know how
a doctor does what he does, you have
to study medicine. If you want to know
how an engineer does what he does,
you have to study engineering. If you
want to know how a philosopher does
what he does, we'll be very happy to
show you.

Hydrofoil ships...another engineering challenge!
Such a revolutionary concept in
sea-going design represents still
another major challenge for to-
day's engineers. Through their
careful and creative planning,
this hydrofoil ship will move from
the drawing board to reality. One
such vessel, now under develop-
ment, is planned to travel 100
miles an hour. It will skim over
the tops of waves like a flying fish,
lifted aloft by a set of underwater
wings.
Through the intensive research
of the metallurgical engineer will
come a metal for these hydrofoils,
strong and tough enough to stand
up to difficult underwater service.
A metal which will resist corro-
sive attack by the coursing brine,
cavitation from the seething tur-
bulence, stresses and strains from
the load of the ship.
An engineering career, such as
metallurgy, is full of challenges.
Exciting new designs —gas-tur-
bined cars, nuclear-powered ships,
monorail transit systems-all will
be in your range of exploration,
affording you a great opportunity
for advancement in a profession
that promotes progress and
economic growth.

DR. DAVIS AND MICRO-DEVICES
When Dr. Edward M. Davis was working for his bachelor's
degree, miniaturization was a novelty. Today, with the tran-
sistor and the printed circuit commonplace, micro-miniatur-
ization is one of the newest challenges in electronics. Ed
Davis is helping to meet that challenge.
Today'scomputeroperationstakeonlymillionthsof a second;
tomorrow's may accelerate to billionths. In a billionth of a
second, however, even light can travel only about a foot, and
the physical sizeof an electronic circuit may slowitsoperation
critically.The answer is in micro-electronics where complete
circuits a re packaged on minuscule substrates, and each tran-
sistor may occupy less than a thousandth of a square inch.
Since early in 1961, Ed Davis has been in charge of an IBM
engineering project exploring the parameters of advanced
micro-devices. Hisworkmayverywell helpestablishthe tech-
nology of future computers. Equally important, he and his
colleagues are already gathering significant knowledge in
the advanced study of solid state electronics.
A basic approach is encouraged at IBM. Whether in research,
development, manufacturing, or programming, the IBM sci-
entist and engineer are encouraged to go to the heart of the
problem. ThelBMrepresentativeinterviewingonyourcampus

He can thus point a theme for life that
any intelligent understanding of life
will support and yet profit from. He
can observe, distinguish, type, and in-
terrelate as accurately as any specialist,
and yet boldly and broadly synthesize
and pronounce on the most particular
and general of human problems which
cautious, tentative sciences are simply
too restricted to commit themselves
about. His notions of astronomy are
now hopelessly antiquated, but what is
at least just as important and more to
the present point, his understanding
of human motives has only been cor-
roborated by science. The characters of
his plays are so complexly consistent
and realistic that they can be psycho-
analyzed, as can a good many other
characters in fiction.
Someday, perhaps, science can reach
conclusions about such infinitely vari-
able potentialities of human nature and
guide us with complete certainty in
all our choices. But, meanwhile, one
generation of doctors puts babies on
strict schedules, and the next permis-
sively takes them off, and the next puts
them on again more flexibly, as sensi-
ble people with some experience proba-
bly would have done in the first place.
Hence, the true scientist is cautious
and modest about how much he knows
with certainty and often relies, like
the rest of us, on his or his society's
experience or the wisdom of the race,
which is literature as much as anything.
The Truth of Literature
Unlike the exact sciences, a play or
novel cannot demonstrate the truth
with precise logic or obvious evi-
dence. Yet literature can be criticized
for authenticity and probability, and
the numerous varieties of people
throughout centuries in different lands
who have found validity in Shake-
speare, Goethe, Sophocles, Confucius,
or the Book of Job provide the same
kind of check or verification of con-
clusions that we must use for countless
human problems that confront us. The
lack of absolute certainty may be an
ON LITERATURE
(Continued from page 24)
inescapable deficiency in empirical hu-
man wisdom. The method may not be
perfect, but at least its results are high-
ly pertinent—its great advantage over
more precise methods.
Furthermore, many of the elemental
yet vital considerations of life have been
demonstrated over and over again, so
that the need is less for proof positive
than for a forceful reminder. We need
it brought home to us repeatedly that
generosity, sympathy, justice, courage,
self-sacrifice, cooperation, industry,
self-reliance, and so on through a con-
siderable list of virtues and vices, must
be remembered for us to preserve the
compensations of civilized society. We
are forcefully reminded of the need for
humility, courage, and resignation by
sharing the experience of Oedipus or
Lear. We have all seen an occasional
movie, for instance, so accurately ring-
ing familiar notes that we are quite
caught up with the characters and in
what happens and are quite convinced,
by all kinds of lifelike nuances and
consistent situations and episodes, that
it all could not seem more likely and
true to life as a continuous occurrence
and, therefore, a meaningful and point-
ed one. Even if it is all just a story, it
all checks consistently as a parallel to
life and therefore has a true meaning
for life. It tells us something by show-
ing us authentically.
Experience is the best teacher, in-
cluding the vicarious experience that
can be imaginatively created and re-
lived, and thus literature makes us un-
derstand as only sharing an experience
can. Protestants can share the point
of view of Dante, or Catholics that of
Milton, so that we see in contradictory
points of view much of the truth that
lies in each. A Marxist poet can make
us see a point of view in a way that
Marx himself could not, or Freud will
resort to anecdotes and analogies to
convey ideas, or Dickens makes us re-
alize the misery of slums in a way that
a socialist orator could not. And it is
not only the old-fashioned verities that
are intelligently appreciated through
the engrossing vicarious experience of
literature, but also the sophisticated
thought of any particular age.
The Writer as Thinker
As abstract, systematic thinkers, poets
or novelists do not qualify as well as
the more specialized philosophers and
scientists. But they are aware of their
age and the problems it presents to the
thoughtful and sensitive. So they are
followers and interpreters of great,
original thinkers who analyze the prob-
lems and define the attitudes of an
age. As Sir Philip Sidney said, "The
poet is the right popular philosopher."
The fact that he is popular as much
as he is a philosopher, that sometimes
he may be inexact or oversimplify or
be less systematic and profound, does
mean that he is not a substitute for the
specialized thinker, even if he does
complement him. But in this day of
specialized expertness, the tendency is
to dismiss the poet as a thinker, even
if T. S. Eliot's "Wasteland" and "Pru-
frock" did anticipate a host of sociolo-
gists and anthropologists such as Reis-
man and Mead, while Eliot himself
descended from Matthew Arnold. In
fact Mead, like Freud, has acknowledg-
ed frequent indebtedness to literature
as a source of material and ideas. Yet,
even if Marxist novelists or Freudian
playwrights may not be exactly equiva-
lent to Marx and Freud, the thoughts
of one or the other are about equally
important in making up the content
of intelligent culture. As a matter of
fact, because Marx and Freud have been
revised a good deal by professionals
in their own fields, it is likely that de-
voting our lives to thorough expertness
in their fields would be a very ineffi-
cient way to gain the general awareness
that constitutes culture. Moreover, the
effect of Einstein on the ideas of intel-
ligent people in general may be quite
as important as his effect on physics,
or they may be two entirely different
matters, but at least one cannot be
discounted because of the other. The
thinking of writers and of similarly
intelligent people, even if dilettantes,
is all-important in making up the cul-
tural climate that society needs to give

community. Most reputable writers,
however, have the integrity as well as
ability to reflect truly the larger, im-
portant problems and approaches which
concern our way of life. We can think
readily of Faulkner, Lillian Hellman,
or Tennessee Williams on the deca-
dence of the South; Maupassant, Nor-
ris, Howells, Dos Passos, Sinclair Lewis,
Theodore Dreiser, Arthur Miller on
the commercial mentality; Eugene O'-
Neill, W. H. Auden, Robinson Jeffers,
D. H. Lawrence on Freudian impulses
in human nature; Steinbeck, Vachel
Lindsay, John Masefield, Stephen Spen-
der, Clifford Odets, William Saroyan
on the downtrodden and dispossessed.
Studying literature becomes the most
direct route to culture.
The Powerful Wholeness
of Literature
Because serious writers have lively
intellects as well as sensibilities, a sur-
vey course in literature is as much a
course in the history of ideas as in
forms of art. Yet increasing specializa-
tion has had the effect of depriving the
writer of any authority as a thinker
and leaving him with little else than
art forms to experiment with. Litera-
ture is trying so hard not to be didactic
and leave all content to other experts
that it is perhaps becoming rather de-
cadently merely an elegant manner.
It can be very felicitous and refined to
very little purpose. It does not try to
say much, but says it well. The assump-
tion is that if it is art, it is nothing but
art in the "purest" form, all technique
and symbol expressing only the artists's
subjective self. Yet art has usually been
the richer for generally worthwhile
content that it could do justice to. It
is a means, a way of communicating
something, and mere skill or manner
without a significant use is somewhat
precious and effete.
Several critics—Coleridge, Benedet-
to Croce, Eliot, I. A. Richards—have
variously explained art as a fusion of
thought and feeling, of logical order
and subconscious impulse, of objective,
deliberate tone and subjective, involun-
tary mood, and style is invariably a
distinctive mingling of these two basic
elements, as they are developed by
imagery, rhythm, and association. But
the assumption today frequently is that
art is essentially mood, and the purpose
of conventional tone is merely to pro-
mote the exact evocation of private,
interior moods to allow the artist a
kind of therapy. But we can as easily
assume the opposite, that a convention-
al and social tone is shared the better
with readers by accompaniment of ha-
bitual feelings about it. It can be, in
Emerson's words, "a metre-making ar-
gument." However, if we should grant
that art itself needs no conventional
content in particular, that it is only a
way of managing a mood, it still needs
some thought or content worthy of its
skill to exercise itself upon. All critics
recognize the need for restraint and
objectivity, which may as well be a
socially useful and significant objec-
tivity as just an individual tension.
If, however, we do not try to de-
scribe all art and literature too much
in terms of a single type or a modern
vogue that is retreating to narrow aims
and intentions in the face of increasing
specialization, and if we look at the
literature that has been considered great
over long periods, we usually expect
it to "teach and delight," to convey
thought and feeling, especially because
it is a verbal art and words necessarily
express both thought and feeling.
Hence literature is usually the least
"pure" and the most comprehensive
art, virtually as much philosophy as
art, embracing essential purposes of
most other studies and arts. As put
tersely by Robert Frost, a poem "begins
in delight and ends in wisdom."
Therefore, to meet our cultural needs
to counteract specialization, we need
the literature that does make significant
thought effective. And literature invar-
iably does so, whatever the special em-
phasis, because its power is in uniting
thought and feeling, in a harmonizing
of our conscious and subconscious na-

CONTRIBUTORS
MORRIS J. STARSKY, a native of Rochester, New York, received his
B.A. at the University of Rochester and his M.A. here at U. of M. He
is currently engaged in writing a dissertation for the Ph.D. degree in
philosophy. At the request of Professor Weeks, one of the Technic's
advisers, Mr. Starsky kindly consented to explain his concept of "Phi-
losophy" for the Technic. Mr. Starsky has served in the Signal Corps
of the U.S. Army. This Signal Corps experience may, in part, explain
or illustrate the interest in the "Linguistic Acts" which is the subject
of his dissertation. His hobbies include Jazz, modern literature, and
poker.
PROFESSOR ROSS received his B.A. degree from Sterling College,
Kansas. After teaching for a time and then serving in the European
Theatre during World War II, he came to the University of Michigan
where he received an M.A. and a Ph.D. in English Literature. Since
1946, he has taught in the College of Engineering Department of Eng-
lish, and lived in Ann Arbor with his wife and three children. His
article for the Technic, "On Literature," reflects his active interest in
life, literature, and the technical man. His many hobbies include un-
limited reading, Mozart, television news programs, loafing, and, para-
doxically, working at projects in the yard since, "golf has to be given
up for them anyhow."
PROFESSOR ARTHUR W. FORBES comes from Alleghany, New
York. He attended Alfred University for two years and graduated
from the University of Michigan in 1938. He then taught history for
three years and studied speech during the summers at Michigan. Dur-
ing World War II, he served in the United States Naval Reserve,
resigning as a lieutenant (s.g.) in 1945. He returned to the University
in 1947 and received an M.A. in English and Fine Arts respectively.
His article, "I Know What I Like—But I Want to Know Why," at-
tempts to explain, and perhaps, justify, the concept of "Art." Professor
Forbe's various hobbies are people, books, art, and house maintenance.

today a significant way to humanly im-
portant knowledge through its capacity
to be simultaneously objective and sub-
jective, or general and personal, each
mode of awareness' reinforcing the
other to produce a full understanding.
The civilization that is often regard-
ed as having reached levels as high as
or higher than ours is that of ancient
Greece. The Greeks seem to have
learned to live as joyfully and gratify-
ingly and purposefully as any. It is our
pride that we have developed science
far beyond their initial efforts, but it
may be that they had the discretion
not to pursue it so extremely, since
curiosity and knowledge served human
purposes for them. All that our vaunt-
ed realistic and objective methods of
acquiring vast funds of detailed knowl-
edge are supposed to achieve, all the
realistic and general truth we are sup-
posed to arrive at ultimately, the Greeks
achieved simply and directly with the
courage to face the primal facts and
realities with joy. They make it appear
that our culture is absorbed with dis-
tractions, either of feeling in the arts
or of intellect in the sciences, without
the simple will to face life directly and
therefore gratifyingly—to "see life
steadily and see it whole." In Eliot's
terms, since the Renaissance and its
full relish of vital, ordinary experience,
we have reflected a dissociation of
thought and feeling, neither without
the other being a true or adequate ex-
pression or fulfillment of human will.
Our culture is not regarded as a very
wholesome one by the unanimous voice
of its critics. We need a redress of
balance, a consideration of expressly
human verities, virtues and goals. Be-
cause most responsible writers realize
this, we should study literature to re-
alize what we need and especially the
great literature of times past and of all
cultures to show us how to achieve the
most real and lasting human satisfac-
tions.

how much do you know
about MITRE?
Much of MITRE'S work is on
the fringes of a new technology
— and a great deal of it is highly-
classified. It is not surprising
then that many young scientists
and engineers have only a vague
idea of what MITRE does.
MITRE's prime mission is to
design, develop, and help put
into operation global command
and control systems that give our
military commanders extra time
for decision and action in case of
enemy attack. Typical systems
are SAGE, NORAD, MIDAS,
BMEWS, and SPACE TRACK.
MITRE assists the Air Force
in its systems management re-
sponsibility by engaging in sys-
tems planning and engineering,
including feasibility studies, cost
studies, operations research, test-
ing and evaluation and prelimi-
nary system design.
At MITRE you would become
identified with projects of the ut-
most national urgency — proj-
ects that offer a real challenge to
the talented scientist.
The rewards are great. Salary
and benefit plans are competi-
tive. MITRE offers an excellent
Educational Assistance program
that gives every encouragement

DEEP-STRENGTH (Asphalt-Base) pavement
With today's "giant step forward" in pavement engineering—
DEEP-STRENGTH (Asphalt-Base) pavement-there is need for
engineers with a solid background in the fundamentals of
Asphalt technology and pavement construction.
Because new DEEP-STRENGTH Asphalt-base
construction provides the most durable, most
economical pavement modern engineering science
has developed, Interstate and primary superhigh-
ways in all parts of the country are being built with
advanced design DEEP-STRENGTH Asphalt pavement.
Already, more than 90% of America's paved roads and
streets are surfaced with Asphalt. And Asphalt pavements
have successfully kept America's wheels rolling since 1876.
Your contribution—and reward—in our nation's vast road-
building program can depend on your knowledge of modern
Asphalt technology. So, prepare for your future now. Write for

The analysis of pile driving hammer dynamics is part of a Michigan State Highway Department project
investigating factors influencing pile hammer performance. It is typical of the "new look" being taken at
problems which have long perplexed civil engineers and indicates the advanced analytical tools which are aid-
ing in the solution of these problems. While a major portion of this study is being performed by personnel
of the Highway Department Testing Laboratory located in the East Engineering Building on Campus, Univer-
sity staff members are acting as technical consultants.
For many years there has been a close working relationship between the Highway Laboratory and the
Civil Engineering Department of the Engineering College. Several Civil Department staff members are em-
ployed as permanent consultants or engineers with the Highway Department and the Testing Laboratory has
afforded part time employment and training to many undergraduates over the years. Highway Department
Laboratory facilities are used in certain of the materials testing courses and are available for use by posting
graduate students in their research activities. The latter has included several projects concerned with design
and performance of asphalt and concrete pavements and behavior of prestressed concrete structural members.

Deep in lacquer
That our name is never seen on a can
of lacquer doesn't mean we aren't in
it pretty deep.
Our newest cellulose ester for the
lacquer formulators has the butyryl-
ated, acetylated cellulose chains run-
ning much shorter than heretofore.
This results in higher solubility, which
means less solvent needed. It also
means poorer film strength, but that's
OK. A butylated urea-formaldehyde
resin, included at the right proportions
in the formulation along with the
proper catalyst, will cross-link to the
cellulose acetate butyrate during the
drying of the coating. To provide a
point of attachment on the cellulose
chain, we restore one out of 12 of its
hydroxyls. This condenses with the
butoxy groups of the butylated urea-
formaldehyde polymer to split out
butyl alcohol.
Thus the short chains that are more
soluble in the can become very much
less soluble in the finish of a table on
which some gay dog has set down the
cup that cheers. No longer need a drop
of lotion spilled on the dresser trouble
the conscience of a good woman.
In these days of epoxies, silicones,
methacrylates, polyesters, etc., why do
we monkey with cellulose? What a
silly question!
For one thing, we have shown how
admixture of cellulose acetate butyrate
can improve them all.
For another, cellulose is by far the
world's most abundant high polymer.
It is formed by sunshine.

Interview with General Electric's Dr. J. H. Hollomon
Manager—General Engineering Laboratory


Q. Dr. Hollomon, what characterizes
the new needs and wants of society?
A. There are four significant changes
in recent times that characterize these
needs and wants.
1. The increases in the number of
people who live in cities: the accom-
panying need is for adequate control
of air pollution, elimination of trans-
portation bottlenecks, slum clearance,
and adequate water resources.
2. The shift in our economy from agri-
culture and manufacturing to "serv-
ices": today less than half our working
population produces the food and goods
for the remainder. Education, health,
and recreation are new needs. They
require a new information technology
to eliminate the drudgery of routine
mental tasks as our electrical tech-
nology eliminated routine physical
drudgery.
3. The continued need for national
defense and for arms reduction: the
majority of our technical resources
is concerned with research and devel-
opment for military purposes. But
increasingly, we must look to new tech-
nical means for detection and control.
4. The arising expectations of the peo-
ples of the newly developing nations:
here the "haves" of our society must
provide the industry and the tools for the
"have-nots" of the new countries if they
are to share the advantages of mod-
ern technology. It is now clearly recog-
nized by all that Western technology is
capable of furnishing the material
goods of modern life to the billions
of people of the world rather than
only to the millions in the West.
We see in these new wants, prospects
for General Electric's future growth
and contribution.
Q. Could you give us some examples?
A. We are investigating techniques for
the control and measurement of air and
water pollution which will be appli-
cable not only to cities, but to individual
households. We have developed, for
Society Has New Needs
and Wants—Plan Your
Career Accordingly
DR. HOLLOMON is responsible for General Electric's centralized, advanced engineering
activities. He is also an adjunct professor of metallurgy at RPI, serves in advisory posts
for four universities, and is a member of the Technical Assistance panel of President
Kennedy's Scientific Advisory Committee. Long interested in emphasizing new areas of oppor-
tunity for engineers and scientists, the following highlights some of Dr. Hollomon's opinions.
example, new methods of purifying
salt water and specific techniques for
determining impurities in polluted air.
General Electric is increasing its inter-
national business by furnishing power
generating and transportation equip-
ment for Africa, South America, and
Southern Asia.
We are looking for other products
that would be helpful to these areas to
develop their economy and to improve
their way of life. We can develop new
information systems, new ways of stor-
ing and retrieving information, or
handling it in computers. We can
design new devices that do some of the
thinking functions of men, that will
make education more effective and per-
haps contribute substantially to reducing
the cost of medical treatment. We can
design new devices for more efficient
"paper handling" in the service
industries.
Q. If I want to be a part of this new
activity, how should I plan my career?
A. First of all, recognize that the
meeting of needs and wants of society
with products and services is most
important and satisfying work. Today
this activity requires not only knowl-
edge of science and technology but
also of economics, sociology and the
best of the past as learned from the
liberal arts. To do the engineering
involved requires, at least for young
men, the most varied experience possi-
ble. This means working at a number
of different jobs involving different
science and technology and different
products. This kind of experience for
engineers is one of the best means of
learning how to conceive and design
—how to be able to meet the changing
requirements of the times.
For scientists, look to those new fields
in biology, biophysics, information, and
power generation that afford the most
challenge in understanding the world
in which we live.
But above all else, the science explo-
sion of the last several decades means
that the tools you will use as an engi-
neer or as a scientist and the knowledge
involved will change during your life-
time. Thus, you must be in a position
to continue your education, either on
your own or in courses at universities
or in special courses sponsored by
the company for which you work.
Q. Does General Electric offer these
advantages to a young scientist or
engineer?
A. General Electric is a large diver-
sified company in which young men
have the opportunity of working on a
variety of problems with experienced
people at the forefront of science and
technology. There are a number of
laboratories where research and ad-
vanced development is and has been
traditional. The Company offers incen-
tives for graduate studies, as well as
a number of educational programs
with expert and experienced teachers.
Talk to your placement officers and
members of your faculty. I hope you
will plan to meet our representative
when he visits the campus.

revolution in space
This amazing structure symbolizes the outer space theme for this year's Century 21 International Exposition in
Seattle, Washington. Called the Space Needle, it soars 600 feet into the air on three steel legs, tapers to a slim
waist at the 373-ft. mark, then flares out slightly to the 500-ft. level, and is crowned by a mezzanine, observation deck,
and a 260-seat restaurant that revolves slowly (one complete revolution an hour) while patrons enjoy their meals.
The Space Needle is a combination of sheer audacity and imagination with 3,500 tons of steel. Steel was
chosen because it would be faster to erect, stronger per unit area, quickly available. A relatively new type of
structural carbon steel called A36 was used because its greater strength (about 10%) permits higher design
stresses, at the same time maintaining factors of safety, and because it could be easily welded. This is an example
of the exciting materials and challenging projects engineers will find at United States Steel.

or rust. And the strength of stainless steel makes possible screening so fine
you hardly know it's there.
Many other things stand up against the weather too —such as lawn
furniture, barbecues and garden tools. And inside the house, stainless steel
brings the same carefree beauty to kitchens.
The lifetime quality of stainless steel comes from chromium—one
of many essential alloying metals developed by Union Carbide. In the basic
fields of metals, as well as carbons, chemicals, gases, plastics and nuclear
energy, research by the people of Union Carbide will continue to help bring
forth more useful products for today's living.

SGC?
The recent Student Government Council elections stirred up
much controversy over the violations of election procedures.
This may have been a good thing. Over the years, the lack of
accomplishment of SGC has been a favorite topic for student
bull sessions. SGC is like the weather, everybody talks about
it, but nobody does anything about it. Perhaps the recent con-
troversy will cause action, instead of just talk.
In a DAILY editorial last Fall, a writer drew the conclu-
sion that the students did not deserve SGC, because the students
did not turn out to hear the candidates speak. A more logical
conclusion might be that SGC does not deserve the students.
It was mentioned during the recent campaign, by several sources,
that the slate of poor candidates would not be able to improve
SGC's mediocre record of the Fall semester.
Why doesn't SGC attract better people? One idea that has
been advanced is that the best leaders on campus are partici-
pating in more worthwhile activities. When an occasional good
person is elected, with plans for reforms, he finds that he cannot
fight the established order alone and he, too, is drawn into the
Council's state of lethargy.
The question is often raised, "Does SGC really represent
student opinion?" The answer is often, "No." This answer
can be supported by the low number of students voting in the
elections. However, the students are partly to blame for this.
Student opinion can be effective! There has been a greater
emphasis on campus issues since the Fall election, when students
complained about SGC's preoccupation with national issues.
SGC is not all bad. Some of their committees provide
essential services. It is the Council, itself, which does not live
up to its potential. SGC is a much more powerful group than
the average student government.
One area of improvement would be in public relations.
Many of the Council's activities are kept secret, and others are
just not publicized. How many students realize that fifty cents
of their tuition is earmarked for SGC's purpose, most of which
is used to send delegates to national meetings of student groups?
With better publicity, the students will be better informed, and
will show a greater interest in SGC.
Student Government Council has a long way to go to reach
its potential, but some progress can be made by a concerted
effort by the Council, by the DAILY, and by the students.

STEELCASE, INC. ... A Synthesis of New Ideas
But for control of piping systems...
time-proved JENKINS VALVES were specified
Widely noted for its imaginative styling of office furniture,
Steelcase, Inc. required that its new quarter-mile long home be
the epitome of newness and originality.
Architects and builders answered with many interesting design
features. Typical are: Factory windows set above twelve-foot walls
to gain flexibility in placement of equipment. Large bays with
masonry walls that reduce use of structural steel. Composite steel
frame and concrete slab floors, usually associated with bridges.
Perhaps only one "old" idea was followed in building this ultra-
modern million-plus square foot facility. In choosing valves to con-
trol the piping systems, everyone involved asked for JENKINS
VALVES. They wanted the time-proved dependability, long-life
and low-cost service that the specification "Jenkins" always
assures.
EXPERIENCED building men and plant engineers commonly
call for Jenkins Valves. Experience shows they cost less to use
... but no more to buy than any good valves. For information or
assistance with valve problems call in your local Jenkins Distrib-
utor. Or write JENKINS BROS., 100 Park Ave., New York 17.

The Grumman Hydrofoil

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

One of the basic problems involved
in the propulsion of a high speed
vehicle upon the surface of water is
the tremendous amount of energy ex-
pended in the propagation and main-
tainence of surface wave trains. The
phenomenon of surface waves com-
prises a natural barrier to the develop-
ment of displacement hulls displaying
greater speed concurrent with feasible
power plants and improved perform-
ance in heavy seas. The addition of
brute horsepower to the conventional
hull fails to be fully satisfactory be-
cause of the non-linear relationship
between speed and power. Higher
powered planing craft also lack real
potential because of the extreme slam-
ming problems in a seaway.
This article proposes to outline a
smattering of some of the basic de-
velopments and a quick review of the
future prospects for one solution to the
situation described.
The hydrofoil seacraft is an ap-
proach to the challenge of the prob-
lems involved with high speed surface
vessels. Wave-making resistance is
largely avoided by supporting the hull
of the vessel clear out of the water,
employing the lifting action generated
on surfaces called hydrofoils. In per-
forming their functions, these wing-
like structures actually "fly" in the
fluid and display many features of
aircraft wings.
Despite the fact that the idea of a
hydrofoil boat was first experimented
with about 70 years ago, it is only in
the last 20 years that hydrofoils have
reached a stage of technical and com-
mercial maturity. Presently, there is an
ever-lessening doubt about the feasibil-
ity of hydrofoil craft. For a concrete
example, the economic and technolog-
ical successes of the Supramar A.G. (a
Swiss Company) in the development of
hydrofoil passenger vessels have been
noteworthy. The technical background
of this concern is truly unique, for the
origin of the characteristic Supramar
foil system is rooted in work done by
H. F. von Schertel, Professor G. P.
Weinblum, and others during the
1930's and 40's in Germany. Today
the Schertel-Sachsenberg foil system can
be seen on many very successful hydro-
foil passenger craft in countries all
over Europe and in the East.
There are other European effects such
as the International Aquavion company
and research projects in England that
show promise for advancement. Russia
has been conducting an extensive pro-
gram of utilizing hydrofoil ferries on
its vast inland waterway system.
A complete review of the facts about
all the developments and programs
lends great weight to the notion of the
practicality of this type of seacraft.
However, of primary concern in this
article are the present and future
American efforts with the hydrofoil.
Factors in Design
It must be emphasized that the ensu-
ing discussion is very general and mere-
ly skims the surface of the complex
and formidable problems arising in
hydrofoil design.
Hydrofoil Lift and Drag
"The range of variation of lift that
can be generated by a hydrofoil unit
is of basic importance. Since hydrofoils
are only aerofoils 'flying' just below or
intersecting the surface of the water,
aerodynamic theory can, of course, be
employed to calculate many features of
the lift and drag."i A striking differ-
ence exists between lift in water and in
air because of the fact that the ratio of
densities is approximately 800 to one.
Thus, a much smaller foil surface area
is needed for the required amount of
lift in water as compared to that need-
ed in air for a given speed.
An important quantity is the ratio of
lift to drag. This ratio is intimately
related to the efficiency of a foil sec-
tion; and in a design it is desired to
optimize its magnitude to give a high,
favorable value for operation.
Cavitation
A phenomena encountered very early
in hydrofoil history, and one which has
since continually plagued rapid ad-
vancement, is that of cavitation. This
problem is identical to that of cavita-
tion with water propellers. As the
speed of a hydrofoil craft is steadily
increased after becoming foil borne, the
pressure on the upper face of the foil
reduces as the square of speed until it
reaches the vapor pressure of water at
some point on the foil contour. Bub-
bles of water vapor then form, and

of cavitation spreads until the upper
face is literally covered with an unsta-
ble cavity. The bubbles formed in the
action of this transient cavity collapse
in the higher pressure zone at the rear
of the foil. Hence, in addition to the
resulting rapid increase in drag and the
loss in lift, erosion and pitting take a
serious toll on the foil material itself.
Speeds in the magnitude of 45 to 65
mph seem to be in the recurring range
for this problem of cavitation. "The
destructive effects of partial and inter-
mittent cavitation are so severe that it
does not seem practical to consider this
type of operation over any prolonged
period in a hydrofoil."6 For many
years it appeared that this phenomena
would impose a serious speed limit on
hydrofoil operation.
However, instead of accepting the re-
striction on speed and inherent size
limitations for most subcavitating de-
signs, an alternate idea is to design
for supercavitation. With this situation,
a wedge-shaped foil is employed which
creates a cavity or "bubble" that en-
compasses the entire upper surface of
the foil. The upper boundary of this
cavity is a constant pressure streamline
above which smooth flow exists. Thus,
the formation and relative stability of
this cavity are essential to the function-
ing of these sections. Collapse of the
"bubble" occurs well down stream thus
avoiding foil corrosion damage and cer-
tain other effects.
This brings our attention to the im-
portant problem of foil cross-section
with its special relationship to very
high speed craft. It is necessary to
carefully differentiate between the two
basic types of foil sections: the sub-
cavitating profile (the ordinary wing-
type section); and the 5«/&gt;ercavitating
profile to be considered next in a little
more detail. The accompanying sketch
will aid the discussion.

these types, the submerged foil system requiring an auto pilot has the most
promising future for ocean wave "flying." Hence, there seems to be a
definite optimism for the true success of such craft as Boeing's PC(H).
"The supercavitating sections are dis-
tinguished by their dependence on only
the lower surface pressures for opera-
tion.'^ (as opposed to the lift for sub-
cavitating sections incurred by both the
high bottom pressures and the low
pressure region above the foil). The
use of the supercavitating profiles is
fraught with numerous advantages and
many disadvantages. A distinct advan-
tage is the possibility of very high
speed in spite of cavitation. In addi-
tion, larger craft are within reason
without unmanageable foil design.

portant, the disadvantages will not be
dealt with in the article.
Hydrofoil Configurations
To achieve the drastic reduction in
wave-making resistance possible with
hydrofoils, the craft's hull must be
raised clear above the water. This is
accomplished by bringing the lift of the
foils into balance with the weight of
the vessel. The general class of con-
figuration determines how this balance
is obtained. In the case of foils pierc-
ing the water's surface, the greater the
lift due to speed, the more the foil
emerges thereby decreasing its lifting
surface. For crafts with fully sub-
merged foils, external adjustments
(preferably automatic) of the angle of
attack or of flaps attached to the foils
is necessary to control the lift.
Within the general format of the con-
figurations indicated, there are many
possibilities of combinations of all
types.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


all too brief coverage of the subject of
foil design and the general variations
in the shapes and system configurations.
Other aspects are worth mentioning as
well, and these include propulsion
machinery, structures, and stability and
control.
Propulsion Machinery
Large increases in power are the na-
tural consequences of larger vessels
and higher speeds. In the interest of
maximum pay load (cargo in commer-
cial craft; weapons and fuel in military
ships), high power and high perform-
ance engines with low weight to horse-
power ratios are needed. In the present
view it appears that the gas turbine
offers a favorable possibility for suc-
cess. The present concept of meeting
the strict demands of problems like
corrosion, life expectancy, and reliabil-
ity is the "marinization" of aircraft gas
turbines. The problems of major con-
cern are those of high power and low
weight.
Structures
In the areas of both the strength and
the weight of the hull and foil struc-
tures, the need for uniting aircraft and
marine technology is essential. The
occasional slamming forces of waves
upon the hull bottom during take-off,
etc., and the complex variance in foil
loadings demand great attention.
The construction of the foils them-
selves present special problems. In ad-
dition to the static loads of many tons
supported by the struts, the dynamic
force systems arising in turning or in
action in a heavy sea provide formid-
able problems for investigation and de-
sign. The foil material used must meet
the very special requirements of the
marine environment as well as good
fabrication features. Fatigue is a critical
problem due to the high magnitude
and wide range of dynamic loads con-
stantly imposed. Because of the heavy
fluid involved, flutter of the foils and
of the supporting structures takes on
added importance. With these general
considerations, aluminum for the hull
and titanium for the foils seem, at pres-
ent, to show great promise for solving
the problems at hand.
Control and Stability
Satisfactory solutions to the prob-
lems arising in stability and control in
hydrofoil design have been and con-
tinue to be essential. Unlike the inher-
ent margin of heave and pitch stability
in surface piercing foil design, the sub-
merged-foil configurations must fly un-
der constant automatic control by an
auto-pilot. This automatic supervision
includes control of transverse and
longitudinal stability, as well as change
of the angle of attack during all phases
of flight. The reason for the great con-
cern in this aspect of design is that the
submerged-foil system has the greatest
potential for all-weather flying capabil-
ity.
PRESENT PROJECTS AND FUTURE
PROSPECTS
The previous paragraphs have dealt
with four basic areas of development
with hydrofoils: design features, pro-
pulsion considerations, structures, and
stability and control. Though very gen-
eral in nature, these provide necessary
groundwork for an understanding and
appreciation for some of the character-
istics of the hydrofoil craft presently
under construction and for those ideas
proposed for future possibilities.
The author of this article feels that
the real importance of hydrofoil craft
will be reflected in the nature of their
use for large scale purposes. These pur-
poses may be commercial or military in
character, and it is in the decade of
the 1960's that their importance will be
decided. Thus, only those development
projects thrusting toward large, high
speed and high payload hydrofoil craft
will be considered in this article. This
leaves the area of pleasure craft appli-
cation as a subject of much lesser con-
sequence, and one not touched upon in
this article.
Present Projects
It is interesting to observe that the
two important holders of U.S. develop-
ment and construction contracts are air-
craft corporations. This should not
seem unusual because "the design and
construction of aircraft and hydrofoil
craft pose similar problems of fluid dy-
namics, stability, and control."^ Grum-
man is doing its development work
under contract with the Maritime Ad-
ministration, and Boeing is working in
conjunction with the Navy's Bureau of
Ships. A crucial point here is that even
though several aircraft industries seem
to be playing the major roles in de-
velopment, it is the overall direction
and guidance of the Navy and the
Maritime Administration that gives the
present programs real significance. The
comparison and contrast of the actual
hydrofoil craft resulting from each of
these efforts will point up the nature
of the individual programs in develop-
ing designs for commercial vessels (as
with Grumman) or military craft (as
with Boeing).
As a result of the feasibility and de-
sign studies by each of the corporations

SPACE
DRIVE

by Dave Patt
Photograph of Dean Space Drive apparatus.
It is a well established psychological
fact that many words arouse similar
associations or mental pictures in most
people. Consider, for example, the
two words "scientist" and "engineer."
The word "scientist" arouses the image
of a distinguished and intellectual indi-
vidual, perhaps slightly greying at the
temples, in a white lab frock, who,
with keen insight and an open mind,
is constantly striving to unravel na-
ture's mysteries. The word "engineer"
brings to mind a slightly more prag-
matic type of individual with an open
collar and slide rule in hand, who,
with ingenuity and an alert mind, is
constantly seeking new and better
methods of applying the scientist's dis-
coveries for the benefit of mankind.
The above descriptions may be a little
dramatic and corny—well, perhaps
more than a little corny—but they
do exemplify one quality that is essen-
tial to all types of scientific and engi-
neering endeavor: an open mind.
At the very least, dogmatism is
detrimental to progress, and its conse-
quences can sometimes be disastrous.
And if experience is the best teacher,
the United States should be well edu-
cated as to the folly of dogmatism.
One of many examples is the Christie
Tank Suspension System. Invented long
before World War II, this suspension
system for armored vehicles was offered
to the United States Army time and
time again during the 1920's. The
Army just scoffed and finally it was
sold to a foreign government. Conse-
quently, at the beginning of World
War II, the Germans had armored ve-
hicles which were much superior to
ours; it cost us lives and years to catch
up.

History
The controversial "Dean Space
Drive," whether it works or not, is an-
other example of scientific dogmatism
in the United States. Norman L. Dean,
the inventor of the device, has tried for
well over a year to interest military and
NASA officials. There was no ready
explanation for the performance which
Dean claimed for his invention and,
consequently, the military and NASA
officials refused to listen to him. Dean,
however, did not meekly accept the
official's verdict. He has managed to
stir up enough interest to cause at least
three national magazines to run articles
on his device. The first, perhaps appro-
priately, was the Analog Science Fic-
tion Magazine; they have run several
articles and editorials on Dean's device.
Popular Mechanics and Missiles &amp;
Rockets have also run articles on the
drive. All these articles have one thing
in common: they are inconclusive.
Despite all the fuss and furor, the
Dean Drive has never been tested by
technical personnel under controlled
conditions. This, it seems to me, is the
crux of the problem. Authorities have
adopted the attitude of, "well, we can't
explain it, so it can't possibly work;
therefore, it would be a waste of time
and money to test it." This is nothing
less than a refusal to face reality. Man's
science attempts to conform to, and ex-
plain physical phenomena. If we can't
explain something, it's "too bad" for
the theory involved, not for the unex-
plainable phenomenon. The Dean con-
troversy could have easily been settled
at its outset; the device should have
been given a pragmatic test. If it didn't
work, nothing more could have been
said; if it did work, an explanation
would eventually be found (perhaps
this is a slight presumption).
In industry, there has been one inter-
esting, if frustrating, development. The
Western Gear Corporation, while con-
ducting studies of high energy trans-
mission systems under an Army Corps
of Engineers contract, had its physicists
conduct a paper study of the drive. The
conclusion was that it couldn't work.
They also constructed an electrical ana-

logue of the device in a computer. The
computer results largely substantiated
Dean's claims.
This is the present state of affairs.
Whether or not the Dean Space Drive
works, is still anybody's guess.
Mechanical Operation
By now you're probably wondering
what, exactly, is the Dean device. The
Dean Space Drive is, "a system for
converting rotary motion into unidirec-
tional motion." Dean claims that he
has discovered a method of converting
the so-called "centrifugal force"—the
reaction to centripedal force—caused
by a rotating object, into a series of
unidirectional pulses. In the follow-
ing discussion of the drive, we will
consider only one unit. This is analog-
ous to considering only one piston in
a discussion of a reciprocating engine;
thus, in any application of the drive,
one can imagine a number of units
which are sequenced to "fire" in a
manner similar to a multi-cylinder pis-
ton engine so as to produce a relatively
smooth and constant power impulse.
The principle of the drive can be ap-
plied in two ways: first, the drive can
move itself and any vehicle or device
to which it is attached, and second, to
provide a force without producing any
reaction on the system itself.
Let us consider the first application
because its operation is the easiest of the
two to visualize. Figure (1) depicts a
carriage (c) mounted on tracks so that
it is free to move only in the directions
indicated by the arrows; two eccentric
weights, rotating in opposite directions,

yj- '*CARRIAG
3/
are mounted on the carriage (these
weights are rotated at a constant angu-
lar velocity by a power source which
Mr. Dean calls the "prime mover").
Each weight will produce a force re-
action on the carriage which can be
resolved into the components Fj and
F2. At any instant the F2 components
will cancel and the Fx components will
add. Thus, the carriage will oscillate
along the tracks. Now, consider figure
(2); When © is between 0 and it
for Wj (as indicated in the co-ordinate
system in figure (1); also the motion
of W2 will always be symmetrical to
W,) there will be a resultant force on
the system as shown. When 9 is be-
tween 7r and 2tt, the rotating weights
will thrust the carriage back on the
tracks. At e equal to 2-n the solenoid

will move the carriage back against the
load and the cycle will repeat.
A mathematical analysis of the de-
vice gets complicated awfully fast. It
should involve a calculation of the im-
pulse (force x time) in each direction
of motion. If the impulse for each
direction is not equal, there will be a
change of momentum of the system.
Since mv = ft, and the mass doesn't
change, a change in velocity or a
resultant movement in one direction
should result. All the author's infor-
mation indicates that, so far, no one
has been able to carry out this analysis,
and the author's attempt bogged down
in mathamatical complexity soon after
it began.
If one considers the device as an
isolated system, it would seem that its

momentum couldn't change. Yet, Mr.
Dean, the author of the Popular
Mechanics article on the drive, and
others claim that the device has lifted
itself off the floor and remained sus-
pended, weightless (this re-emphasizes
the need for a controlled test).
The second version of the device is
illustrated in figure 3. Basically, it
consists of a frame with tracks on
which the carriage that carries the ro-
tating eccentric weights can oscillate.
The carriage is returned to its central
position by the light centering springs
illustrated and by the solenoids which
have the same function as the solenoid
in the first application. The load is
attached to the carriage periodically
through a steel tape by a clutch of
some sort. The operation is similar to
the operation of the first device. On
the forward impulse, the clutch engages
the steel tape and the load is dragged
forward with no reaction on the frame.
On the rearward impulse, the clutch
disengages and the carriage travels

Though you may not remember it,
last night you spent between one and
two hours dreaming. If you heard
someone talking, it was probably you:
dreamers rarely hear anything but their
own end of a conversation. And no
matter how bizarre your dream was, its
setting probably was commonplace—a
room, a car, a street, a field.
These are but a few of the findings
that researchers have made about you
and your dreams. For something we
do so often, it's surprising how little
we know about dreams—what they
mean, why we dream . . . even what
dreams can tell about us.
For example: if you remember your
dreams clearly, then you are probably
quite aware of your inner feelings and
emotions. This was demonstrated by a
survey carried out by Dr. Rosalea
Schonbar, a clinical psychologist at
Columbia University's Teachers Col-
lege. If you tend to forget your
dreams, you may be inhibited emotion-
ally.
No, don't say you never dream. In-
vestigators at the State University of
New York's Down Medical Center,
after exhaustive tests, concluded that
everybody dreams—but some people
have trouble remembering their dreams.
How much do you know about
dreams? For example, do you think
you move around while you're dream-
ing? Not at all—you remain motion-
less, though you may thrash about both
before and after. According to Dr.
Nathaniel Kleitman of the University
of Chicago, dreamers are like people at
a theater: they fidget before the curtain
goes up, then remain spellbound.
How much time do you think you
spend dreaming? Believe it or not, you
probably spend 22 per cent of your
nightly rest in dreams. University of
Chicago scientists also maintain that
you start to dream an hour after you
fall asleep, and your first dream lasts
ten minutes. Then come three, four,
or five more dreams, lasting 20 to 35
minutes, and at 90-minute intervals.
Your dreams tend to last longer as the
morning approaches.
Who dreams more—men or women?
Women dream more than men, bright
people dream more than not-so-bright
people, and single women dream more
than married women—though no one
had to tell you that. Researchers for
the Chemstrand Corporation also re-
port that women are more apt to dream
in color, and they are more apt to
dream about men. Men, according to
the Chemstrand researchers, dream
equally about men and women. Young
folks between 20 and 25 dream the
most; elderly people dream the least.
Among most of us, dreams that show
our dislikes and hatreds predominate.
You have three dreams that are un-
friendly to other people for every one
that is friendly. Nonetheless, psychia-
trists find that most people think that
the majority of their dreams are pleas-
ant.
Why do we dream? Dr. Sigmund
Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis,
thought that dreams help keep us
asleep—by blotting out unpleasant
thoughts.
This was corroborated by a study
made by Dr. William Dement in the
Department of Psychiatry at Mount
Sinai Hospital, New York. Dr. Dement
decided to have a group of subjects
awakened whenever they began to
dream (you can tell when someone be-
gins to dream by the movement of his
eyes). The subjects, because their
16

dreams were disturbed, became panicky
and irritable, and—oddly enough— de-
veloped ravenous appetites.
You yourself can probably supply
testimony of how dreams keep you
asleep—haven't you once incorporated
the ringing of an alarm clock into
what was going on in your dream?
Further proof: a group of heroic sub-
jects tried to sleep amid bright lights,
noises, and even cold-water sprays.
All these distractions were woven into
their dreams, and they thus managed
to get some sleep—though not much.
You probably didn't know it, but
you can even force someone to dream.
Studies conducted by Dr. Hugo Beigel,
professor of psychology at Long Island
University, show that you can do this
by holding perfume under a dreamer's
nose, whistling, placing a pillow on his
lap, or turning on a light. The sleeper
dreams in order not to wake up.
Ill-fitting and uncomfortable bed-
clothes can also force a person to dis-
tort his dreams in order to remain
asleep. Researchers have found that
sleep is deeper and more restful when
the sheets are tight-fitting and absorb-
ent (cotton contours are considered
your best bet) and when blankets are
lightweight and fluffy. Acrilan, a man-
made fiber, is now being used widely in
blankets because of its light weight, its
warmth, and—important for the sweet-
ness of dreams—its non-allergic quali-
ties.
In fact, some scientists think that
most dreams can be interpreted in phys-
ical terms—a blanket statement if
there ever was one. These scientists
believe that if you dream you are fall-
ing, your hand is dangling over the
side of the bed. If you dream you are
flying, it is because your leg move-
ments are so much freer in bed than
when you are awake and walking or
sitting.
Do people who have been deaf since
birth ever dream? Surprisingly, they
have the most colorful dreams of all.
A study made by psychiatrists at the
Harvard Medical School showed that
the dreams of deaf people contain
every color of the rainbow. (Many
people never dream in color except
when they see a fire.)
Even people who have been blind
all their lives can have dreams. But
without seeing anything—only hear-
ing sounds. Though basically you
dream in order to keep asleep, dreams
sometimes can perform an even greater
service. For one, dreams can be pro-
phetic. You may dream that a friend
will fall sick—and, a few days later,
he does. The reason: your insights
may be sharper when you are asleep,
because tiny clues that barely registered
on your mind do come to the fore
when you are asleep. You may have
barely noticed how pale your friend
looked, how tired he seemed—but, in
your dream, you put two and two to-
gether.
And sometimes dreams can bring you
a fortune.
Back in the 19th century, a writer
went to sleep and had a fascinating
dream. When he awakened, he de-
cided to write a story about that dream.
The writer was Robert Louis Steven-
son. And the story he wrote is one of
the classics of literature, a story that
everyone knows—Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde.
So tonight, if you get a good idea
for a story during your one or two
hours of dreaming, don't neglect to
write it down.
Pleasant dreams!

Very briefly, in order to indicate the
trend in actual developments in U.S.
hydrofoil efforts, the sketch of Boeing's
15-ton, 100-knot hydrofoil catamaran
is included. The contract for this vessel
has also been awarded by the Navy
Bureau of Ships, and the boat is now
under construction.

by Boeing's Advanced Marine Division
along with the Bureau of Ships. It will
be the largest hydrofoil ever built. The
included sketch captions reveal some
further details on both these vessels.

Another project on the Navy's ambi-
tious list is a 250-300-ton experimental
hydrofoil ship with expected speeds of
45 knots with subcavitating foils and
70 knots with supercavitating foils.
Still another includes contracts awarded
for development of two hydrofoil am-
phibians for the Marine Corp.
At the limit of today's feasibility
standards, an optimum 1000-ton craft
was considered in a preliminary design
by Grumman. Significantly, it is merely
a dream, yet one within the confident
probes of man's ingenuity.
Indeed, the present decade sees the
hydrofoil craft at a "crossroads." A
Two gas turbines will power Boeing's
PC(H).
For the Grumman craft, a promise of
economic practicality for future vessels
will dictate success or failure. In the
case of the PC(H), complete integra-

systems will determine its effectiveness
as an operational military unit, and
hence, its success.

SPACE FABRIC
This sphere was originally a limp piece of cloth. It was placed in a vacuum chamber, where a space environment
was simulated, inflated and hardened into its present shape. The hardening process is called "rigidizing" and is being
developed by the Westinghouse Electric Company. To show that the sphere retains its shape after hardening and
removal from the chamber, the round section has been cut from it. Fabrics having the rigidizing property will remain
flexible, while folded into a compact package, during a journey into space. Once in space they will inflate into their
predetermined shape and rigidize. Huge solar reflectors can be easily constructed in space by this new process.

Shown in the process of vaporizing a razor
blade is the Kopito Instant Furnace. Developed
by Baird-Atomic Incorporated, this unit is capable
of producing temperatures approaching those of
the sun's surface. It uses a graphite cloth elec-
trode made by the National Carbon Company and
in three seconds can reach temperatures in the
5000 degree F range. The furnace is about the
size of a bread box and can operate from a
standard electrical outlet. It will find application
in science and industrial research laboratories.
CORONA HUNTER
The gentleman shown is not shooting birds off
high-tension wires, the rifle-like device he holds
is used to detect coronas around high-voltage
electric lines. A corona is a leakage of high-
voltage electricity into the air. Besides being a
loss in energy it causes static in nearby radios
and produces ultrasonic sound. Transducers in the
corona gun enable it to hear the ultrasonic sound,
which is too high a frequency for human ears to
hear. The ultrasonic sound is then converted to an
audible range and played on a loud speaker for
the operator to hear. The device was developed
by Westinghouse and is a big improvement over
existing ways of locating corona sources.

Some say we go overboard, the lengths
we go to in testing Ford-built cars at
"Hurricane Road"—our wind-and-
weather lab in Dearborn, Michigan.
And for practical purposes—we do.
You might call it "testing in depth."
Ford scientists and engineers have
devised a gigantic test tunnel that
creates monsoon rains and tornadic
winds in a matter of minutes. Super
sun lamps boost temperatures from 20
below to 160 above zero. Fog and
drizzle, snow and sleet—all at the twist
of dials. Huge cylinders beneath test-
car wheels imitate every kind of road:
from flat, smooth turnpike to rutted
mountain trail.
Out of it all comes knowledge of how to
build better cars—cars that are built to
last longer, require less care, and retain
their value better. This constant aiming
for perfection is just one more way in
which research and engineering are
earning for Ford Motor Company its
place of leadership.

Machine Excellent Spanish Instructor
Four months ago Michigan student
Noel McGinn knew no Spanish. Today
he speaks it as good as the natives of
Mexico.
Mr. McGinn did not learn his Span-
ish from a human instructor; he was
taught by a teaching machine. After
200 hours of lessons from the machine,
Mr. McGinn went to Mexico for two
weeks where he spoke only Spanish.
This was the final exam for both Mr.
McGinn and the machine and they
passed with flying colors.
During his two weeks in Mexico Mr.
McGinn mixed with the natives and
spoke only their language. He so im-
pressed one Mexican fellow that he
received the compliment: "You speak
Spanish better than some Americans
that have lived in Mexico for more
than twenty years."
While on his trip, Mr. McGinn tape
recorded 14 hours of his conversations.
These recordings are now being studied
by Professor F. Rand Morton, the man
responsible for the Spanish teaching
machine experiment. From these studies
Professor Morton intends to improve
the programing of language teaching
machines.
Teaching machines work on a princi-
ple called "step-increment learning."
Professor Morton literally broke down
Spanish into thousands of minute habit-
forming steps. He then arranged them
in a carefully planned sequence and
recorded them on continuously playing
tapes.
The machine presents the sequenced-
steps to the student one at a time,
letting him know whether he is right
or wrong the moment he responds. By
controlling the machine's presentation
rate the student can learn at his own
speed.
By using the teaching machine Mr.
McGinn learned to distinguish the
sounds of Spanish. He learned to vocal-
ize these sounds with native like fluen-
cy, to react appropriately to most of the
"grammatical items," to master the
basic Spanish language patterns and
also some 1500 new vocabulary items.
He was trained to behave correctly in
the foreign language as well as speak
it. Even the proper gestures and facial
expressions were taught to him through
the machine.
So far the main results obtained by
Professor Morton from the recordings
Mr. McGinn brought back are:
*The average Mexican understood
his Spanish nearly 100 per cent.
*The Mexicans hardly found it nec-
essary to change their own speech
to accommodate his understanding.
*He quickly learned regional vocabu-
lary items that the machine had not
taught him.
*His inexperience with the language
was marked by his lack of the use
of idiomatic and colorful expres-
sions.
Mr. McGinn is a graduate student
in psychology. He expects to get his
Ph. D. degree in June; and since he
has acquired a knowledge of Spanish,
he would like to teach psychology at
the University of Guadalajara in Mex-
ico.
MAD Popular
Fourteen major universities recently
sent representatives to the University
Computing Center to learn the Uni-
versity of Michigan system for process-
ing work in a computer. The U-M
system, which was developed by the

24
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Two students operate a teaching machine similar to the one Noel McGinn learned
Spanish on in 200 hours.
University Computing Center, is one
of the fastest and most efficient systems
in the country.
The main advantage of the U-M
system is that it allows a computer to
be used directly on problem solving
almost 70 per cent of the time it is in
operation. Most other systems allow
only 35 to 40 per cent of the operating
time for actual problem computation.
There are two main reasons why this
high rate of computation is desirable.
First, the cost of computer operation
is high, $400 per hour for a computer
like the University's IBM 709. Second,
it allows more programs to be run in
a given time, increasing the efficiency
of the entire operation.
The system has proved advantageous,
if not absolutely essential, here at the
University where there are a larger
number of tasks requiring a computer
than on any other U.S. campus. Besides
being used for research calculations,
the University's machine is used for
class work in 97 regularly scheduled
courses. This amounts to an average
load of 6000 programs per month be-
ing run through the machine.
The handling of such a heavy load
is possible because of the U-M develop-
ed operation for scheduling work in
the computer, called an "executive
system." It supervises the several steps
necessary to get a program into the
computer and the result out of it.
The system includes two language
translators for the FORTRAN langu-
age and the MAD language (which
stands for Michigan Algorithm De-
coder) and an assembly program,
UMAP (U-M Assembly Program). A
problem fed into the machine is set up
in the necessary machine instructions
automatically by the computer, the
solution worked out and the answer
printed under the supervision of the
executive system.
No scheduling of runs on the U-M
computer is necessary, in contrast to
other systems, because the U-M execu-
tive system can handle these problems
in any sequence. Thus the speed of
the system, which with computers of
the 709 class can handle several oper-
ations simultaneously, is considerably
increased.
Engineers Improve Microwave Tubes
Two University of Michigan electri-
cal engineers have devised a theory and
method that will increase the efficiency
of microwave transmitting tubes up to
100 per cent. These tubes are known
as traveling-wave amplifiers and are
used in satellite communications and
radar. Professor Joseph E. Rowe, di-
rector of the Electron Physics Labora-
tory, and Mr. John Meeker made
studies and showed that an improve-
ment in the efficiency of the microwave
tube was possible.
The improvement was made essen-
tially in the way the signal wave travels
in the tube. In a traveling-wave tube,
the signal wave is carried along a helix,
a spiral of wire which looks very much
like a coil spring. Inside the central
axis of the helix streams a beam of
electrons which, by electromagnetic in-
teraction with the signal moving along
the helix, gives more energy to the
signal and thus amplifies it.
The velocity of the signal on the
helix is constant. But the electrons
inside the helix tend to slow down
toward the end of the beam. As they
slow down, the electrons drop out of
phase with the signal. The more out
of phase the two are, the less increase
in energy the signal receives.
For some time electrical engineers
have realized that the energy (and
efficiency of the tube) could be im-
proved by slowing down the signal
wave on the helix. Professor Rowe
and Mr. Meeker accomplished this
slowing by working out a theory for
varying the pitch of the helix near the
end. By increasing the number of turns,
the signal is slowed in its trip to the
end of the tube. It therefore remains
more in phase with the electron beam,
yielding a 40 to 100 per cent improve-
ment in efficiency.
This improvement means that for a
given signal gain and power output,
the tapered pitch tube would be short-
er, lighter and require less power than
its untapered counterpart. These are
three changes of substantial significance
for uses of these tubes in satellites, in
which any weight reduction is bene-
ficial.
As a result of this new theory, it is
believed that the length of these tubes
can be reduced by 20 to 30 per cent
depending on the particular tube. The
typical tube is about a foot long and
may cost anywhere from a few hundred
to thousands of dollars. Professor Rowe
and Mr. Meeker are continuing their
work and are now trying to find the
best pitch and the highest efficiency for
a traveling-wave tube.

ANNOUNCING A NEW
RESEARCH CENTER FOR
THE AEROSPACE
SCIENCES
Under the Direction of
Dr. Robert C. Langford
Your interest is enlisted in a new scientific community entirely
concerned with scientific and technical investigations; totally
divorced from administrative or development duties.
Studies will be related as closely as possible to urgent needs of
government agencies, determined through personal consultation
with their representatives. Particular (but not exclusive)
emphasis will be placed on problems bearing on navigation,
guidance and control of upper atmosphere, space and undersea
vehicles, areas where Kearfott has long held a leadership position
in the development of systems and components.
Recent doctoral candidates are sought who are interested in
pursuing research programs under the technical guidance of
eminent scientists in the following areas:

Dr. R. C. Langford, Director of the new
Kearfott Research Center, has joined
Kearfott after 18 years as R&amp;D Direc-
tor in a major electronics corporation.
He was graduated with a Doctorate as

backwards. At the beginning of the
forward impulse, the solenoids pull the
carriage forward to the central posi-
tion, the clutch engages the tape and
the cycle repeats.
Mr. Dean has demonstrated this de-
vice in the following manner. The
drive is suspended at about floor level
by three wires from an overhead frame
(it doesn't make contact with the
floor). Of course, it hangs so that the
wires are vertical. The steel tape is
then attached to an eighteen pound
load of boards which rests on the floor
some distance from the drive. When it
is started, the load is dragged across
the floor while the wires remain con-
stantly vertical. In other words, there
is no observable reaction on the drive.
An Analogous System
As it stands, the Dean system is
extremely difficult to analyze mathe-
matically. However, the author has had
a system which might be analogous to
the Dean Drive, suggested to him. In
the following discussion, we'll consider
only one rotating weight, but imagine
another weight rotating in an opposite
direction to the one considered, so that
all of the forces which aren't in the di-
rection of motion cancel. This is similar
to the actual Dean Drive. Figure (4)
illustrates a rotating weight driven by
a variable speed power source. It is
suggested that by varying the angular
velocity in the following manner, we
can achieve the same affect as Mr. Dean
achieves by moving the carriage which
carries the weights which have constant
angular velocity. The weight starts at
(a) and rotates in a clockwise direction
towards (b) at a constant angular
velocity. At (b) begin to accelerate the
weight with a constant acceleration un-
til it reaches (c); at (c) begin to de-
accelerate the weight until it reaches
(a). Then repeat the cycle. If we
call w the angular velocity at (a), then
at any instant the infitesimal impulse
in the direction of motion is dFT =
mtv^t sin (uT) dT, where m is the
mass of the weight, and r is the length
of the arm. Then the total impulse for
the period of revolution between (a)
and (b) is
r 5
TnwV Sim(u;T)dT.
A similar, but more complicated in-
tegral can be set up for the period of
revolution between (b) and (a). An
evaluation of these integrals would
surely indicate whether this system
would be able to change its own mo-
mentum, and perhaps the evaluation
would also yield some insight into the
Dean Drive.

THRUST
FIG "4
Hypothetical Applications
Since a continuous thrust can be a
very convenient way of applying pow-
er, it is very interesting to consider
some hypothetical applications of the
Dean system. The drive could have
practically unlimited application in the
field of transportation. In fact, it could
provide the means of propulsion for the
flying car of science fiction fame. Air-
craft might be able to depend on it for
lift. And, perhaps most important, it
may propel the space craft of the fu-
ture. However, one should bear in
mind that any application of the drive
depends not only on whether it works
in theory, but also on whether it can,
in reality, provide useful quantities of
power.
Until the drive is given a controlled
test to definitely establish whether or
not it works, it will remain in its pres-
ent state: a state of limbo.

That plastic sheet is a scant 5/8"
thick. But it'll stop a bullet in its
tracks. Splaaaat.
Our model is actually one of the

it's infallibly bulletproof (but still

the plastic scales in at 1/7 the weight

In addition to our bullet-stopping

Department: Engineering Mechanics
The Department of Engineering Mechanics was created 51 years ago to train the engineer in depth in the
various aspects of classical and modern mechanics. The field of mechanics is roughly divided into the three
divisions of deformable solids, fluids, and rigid body dynamics. The student is made aware of the foundations
and assumptions in each branch of mechanics, and is also widely exposed to the possibilities as well as the
limitations of mathematical models. Laboratory work as well as mathematics are both vital parts of the under-
graduate and graduate programs.
Since the program stresses very heavily the fundamentals of the science, the graduate finds that his back-
ground and training is safe from the rapid obsolescence which seems to accompany modern technology. He
finds that he can successfully work in any of a vast number of industries, research organizations, and univer-
sities. Past graduates have made substantial contributions in such diversified areas as rarified gas dynamics,
vibrations of telephone cables and airframe structures, guidance systems for intercontinental missiles, nuclear
reactor hydraulics, and the paper-manufacturing industry, to name only a few. While training for research
and development work are the major goals of the program, various of the graduates have found the training
to be highly useful in administrative positions as well, particularly when executive decisions of a technical
nature have to be made.
The photographs above illustrate some of the present research engaged in by the staff of the Depart-
ment, which includes research in rotating and stratified fluids; stability of structures, plates and shells; plastic
behavior of structures; the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids; ship vibrations; and tire strength and dynamics,
to name a few.

'Arbitrary basis of scale.
Why they rank this way even provides
something to think about.
Patterns in blood
Electrophoresis is a means for sepa-
rating ionic components of a mixture
by virtue of their differing mobilities in
an electric field. The man who first
worked it out wound up with a Nobel
Prize for his pains. (We never had the
pleasure of an employment application
from him.) Subsequently other highly
creative types — biochemists mostly—
invented ways of doing electrophoresis
in wet paper, starch blocks, and
other media.
Recently two such chaps at The
Mount Sinai Hospital in New York used
polyacrylamide gels of two different pore
sizes in combination. This speeded it
up and permitted separation of blood
serum proteins into many more com-
ponents. It results in a visual pattern
that represents an individual's body
chemistry at a given moment.
We found out about this so-called
disc electrophoresis by paying attention
to what people tell us. Savants are
always asking about Eastman Organic
Chemicals that they hope we can make
for them. Sometimes we find there will
be no objection and some prospect of
benefit to all parties if we will act as a
broadcaster of technical information
thus picked up.
This is happening right now with disc
electrophoresis, which uses Eastman
Organic Chemicals and about which
we are offering far and wide a 69-page
disquisition by the two New Yorkers.
In the name of corporate self-interest,
much good dope gets cheaply spread.

Interview with General Electric's
Charles F. Savage
Consultant—Engineering Professional Relations
How Professional Societies
Help Develop Young Engineers
Q. Mr. Savage, should young engineers
join professional engineering socie-
ties?
A. By all means. Once engineers
have graduated from college
they are immediately "on the
outside looking in," so to speak,
of a new social circle to which
they must earn their right to be-
long. Joining a professional or
technical society represents a
good entree.
Q. How do these societies help young
engineers?
A. The members of these societies
—mature, knowledgeable men—
have an obligation to instruct
those who follow after them.
Engineers and scientists—as pro-
fessional people—are custodians
of a specialized body or fund of
knowledge to which they have
three definite responsibilities.
The first is to generate new
knowledge and add to this total
fund. The second is to utilize
this fund of knowledge in service
to society. The third is to teach
this knowledge to others, includ-
ing young engineers.
Q. Specifically, what benefits accrue
from belonging to these groups?
A. There are many. For the young
engineer, affiliation serves the
practical purpose of exposing his
work to appraisal by other scien-
tists and engineers. Most impor-
tant, however, technical societies
enable young engineers to learn
of work crucial to their own.
These organizations are a prime
source of ideas — meeting col-
leagues and talking with them,
reading reports, attending meet-
ings and lectures. And, for the
young engineer, recognition of
his accomplishments by asso-
ciates and organizations gener-
ally heads the list of his aspira-
tions. He derives satisfaction
from knowing that he has been
identified in his field.
Q. What contribution is the young en-
gineer expected to make as an ac-
tive member of technical and pro-
fessional societies?
A. First of all, he should become
active in helping promote the
objectives of a society by prepar-
ing and presenting timely, well-
conceived technical papers. He
should also become active in
organizational administration.
This is self-development at work,
for such efforts can enhance the
personal stature and reputation
of the individual. And, I might
add that professional develop-
ment is a continuous process,
starting prior to entering col-
lege and progressing beyond
retirement. Professional aspira-
tions may change but learning
covers a person's entire life span.
And, of course, there are dues to
be paid. The amount is grad-
uated in terms of professional
stature gained and should al-
ways be considered as a personal
investment in his future.
Q. How do you go about joining pro-
fessional groups?
A. While still in school, join student
chapters of societies right on
campus. Once an engineer is out
working in industry, he should
contact local chapters of techni-
cal and professional societies, or
find out about them from fellow
engineers.
Q. Does General Electric encourage par-
ticipation in technical and profes-
sional societies?
A. It certainly does. General Elec-
tric progress is built upon cre-
ative ideas and innovations. The
Company goes to great lengths
to establish a climate and in-
centive to yield these results.
One way to get ideas is to en-
GENERAL
courage employees to join pro-
fessional societies. Why? Because
General Electric shares in recog-
nition accorded any of its indi-
vidual employees, as well as the
common pool of knowledge that
these engineers build up. It can't
help but profit by encouraging
such association, which sparks
and stimulates contributions.
Right now, sizeable numbers of
General Electric employees, at
all levels in the Company, belong
to engineering societies, hold re-
sponsible offices, serve on work-
ing committees and handle im-
portant assignments. Many are
recognized for their outstanding
contributions by honor and
medal awards.
These general observations em-
phasize that General Electric
does encourage participation. In
indication of the importance of
this view, the Company usually
defrays a portion of the expense
accrued by the men involved in
supporting the activities of these
various organizations. Remem-
ber, our goal is to see every man
advance to the full limit of his
capabilities. Encouraging him to
join Professional Societies is one
way to help him do so.

"Your First 5 Years" published by
the Engineers' Council for Profes-
sional Development which you may
have for the asking. Simply write to

Dunk an orange into liquid oxygen, then drop it on the
floor and it will shatter like glass. A vital component of
missile propulsion, liquid oxygen is so cold that it
crystallizes many materials on contact, and weakens
some metals used for normal liquid storage vessels.
But because industry and national defense are using
more and more liquefied gases at hundreds of degrees
below zero, there was need for a constructional alloy
steel that would stay strong and tough at extremely low
temperatures. United States Steel helped determine the
suitability of a remarkable steel for such application.
It's called 9% Nickel Steel and it can be used for pres-
sure vessels that hold liquefied gas as cold as —320°F.
The unique combination of properties of this alloy steel
makes it particularly suitable for cryogenic use.
This is just one example of U. S. Steel's continuing
program to develop new and better steels—that's what
makes the work of U. S. Steel engineers so stimulating.

Miniature turboexpander permits major breakthrough
in cryogenics .. .Temperatures ranging from — 200°F to
— 452°F are achieved by converting gases such as helium
and nitrogen into a liquid state.
When cryogenic liquids circulate over an object, the
moving molecules within come virtually to a stop. This
abnormal condition makes some metals superconductive and
extraordinarily sensitive to any form of electrical energy.
Military and commercial applications include increas-
ing the effectiveness of ground and airborne detection, navi-
gation and communication systems, shrinking the size of
computers and solving specialized space cooling problems.
A leader in cryogenic cooling and lightweight turbo-
machinery, Garrett-AiResearch is now developing a closed
cycle cryogenic system to compress and then expand (boil
off) the low temperature gas into its supercold liquid state.
The tiny turbines within the system run on air bearings
and eliminate all rubbing surfaces. Much greater system
reliability and long life is the result... another major ad-
vance by Garrett in the exciting new science of cryogenics.

The recent steel price increase stirred up much controversy
and will no doubt be one of the top news items of 1962. The
final results will, however, be much more than just a news item.
The history texts of the future will list John F. Kennedy
as a strong President, on the basis of his action in regard to
the steel price increase. However, History, itself, may be effected
adversely.
Everyone was shocked when the price rise was announced.
This was a typical first reaction. Very little publicity was given
to the reasons for the increase. The steel companies erred, both
in the timing of the increase, and in the dissemination of in-
formation about the needs of the steel industry.
President Kennedy, however, made an emotional appeal to
the American people, who in turn supported him. This support
was based on their natural dislike for higher prices.
Mark Twain once said, "There are lies, damn lies, and
statistics." People, have a tendency to accept as fact, a state-
ment expressed in numbers, "a statistic," without asking for
proof.
Secretary of Defense, McNamara, seemed to pull a figure
out of the air, when he said the price increase would increase
the costs of the Defense Department by a billion dollars. With
a 3V2% increase, the Defense Department would have to buy
$28.5 billion of steel each year, to increase costs by that much.
Yet the annual output of the steel industry is only $14 or $15
billion.
Assuming one and a half tons of steel in an automobile, a
price increase of $6 per ton would increase the price of cars by
$9 per car, or less than one-half of one percent. This is cer-
tainly not inflationary.
In the decade, 1949-1959, labor costs increased 114%.
Prices increased 52%. Even assuming a productivity increase of
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


costs have still risen 27% faster than prices. This figure would
be larger today, because there has been no price increase since
1958, while employment costs have risen still further.
The American steel industry is facing stiff competition from
European producers. The President's proposed tariff program
would worsen this problem. The industry needs to improve its
plant and equipment to meet this competition. Capital outlays
to improve plant and equipment have exceeded cash flow
(profits plus depreciation.) Therefore, the companies have had
to borrow money. Liberalization of depreciation rates and tax
relief would help the steel industry, without an increase in price.
The Kennedy administration has a bill to provide this relief,
but has yet to take action on it.
President Kennedy has interferred with the American free
enterprise system. Inland Steel, the eighth largest producer,
had decided to maintain their present price, even before the
President made his emotional appeal to the people. In view of
this, the other companies would have had to lower the price to
remain competitive. But President Kennedy has established a
precedent, with socialistic overtones, to interfere. Only time can
tell whether this will have an adverse effect on the United States.
Robert Sprague, board chairman of Sprague Electric Com-
pany, leaves us with this point to think about, "I have no
objection to President Kennedy's denouncing the steel price
hike, but to call in the F.B.I, and the Justice Department—I
call that a police state."

THE
ATOMIC

CLOCK
by Phillip Kaufman
The ultra-stable periodic motions of the
particles within molecular and atomic
systems are used to construct a clock
with an accuracy of better than one
part in lOio.
How often do you look at your
watch, or ask the time? If you are an
average person trying to make your
classes or appointments, you probably
need to know the time at least six times
a day. How about accuracy? An error
of one or two minutes is usually not
objectionable.
Compare these everyday needs with
those of advanced satellite and missile
tracking systems, which require con-
tinuous precise synchronization to bet-
ter than six parts in 108 cycles per sec-
ond (100,000,000 ±6).
The first clocks developed used a
swinging pendulum to count off the
seconds. Little advancement in time-
keeping was made for hundreds of
years. Then with the development of
electronics and radio, a giant step for-
ward in accurate timekeeping was tak-
en. Electronics made possible the use
of the natural resonant frequency of
certain crystals to increase accuracy by
a factor of 100,000.
Great Accuracy Required
Through World War II and the
early 1950's, this accuracy was consider-
ed more than sufficient. However, with
the current emphasis on rockets, miss-
iles, and satellites, it became evident
that greater accuracy was needed. In
pinpointing a satellite's or rocket's po-
sition, it is necessary for all of the
tracking stations to be synchronized
within one part in 10* cycles per sec-
ond.
It is now possible, with our knowl-
edge of the atom, to obtain accuracies
better than one part in 10io cycles per
second. The periodic motions of the
particles within atomic and molecular
systems have long been recognized as
attractive possibilities for ultra-stable
oscillators and precise timekeepers. The
electromagnetic fields arising from the
motions of charges provide the means
for observing this periodic motion.
Cesium, an alkali metal, has a com-
bination of properties which make it a
good choice for frequency control and
timekeeping. These advantages include
the ease of detecting the cesium atom,
the high radio frequency resonance, and
the fact that this atom has been thor-
oughly studied.
Cesium Resonance Oscillator
In 1954, Professor Zacharias at
M.I.T. demonstrated an oscillator con-
trolled by a resonance of cesium in the
region of ten thousand megacycles.
Following this, a development was car-
ried forward in the laboratories of the

National Company of Maiden, Massa-
chusetts. The result of this develop-
ment is the Atomichron*, an atomic
frequency standard, which provides
stability and accuracy never before ob-
tained in a commercial instrument.
The Atomichron generates a highly
stable and accurate frequency by con-
tinuously comparing the output of a
local crystal oscillator with the unvary-
ing resonance of cesium atoms, and
correcting the crystal oscillator fre-
quency when comparison indicates an
error exists. The frequency comparison
occurs in the Atomic Beam Tube, a
simplified diagram of which is shown
in Figure 1. The Atomic Beam Tube
is a long evacuated chamber with a
reservoir of cesium atoms at one end,
and an electronic detector at the other.
The central section of the tube is an
RF chamber, at either end of which
is a DC magnet.
When the reservoir of cesium at the
base of the tube is heated, individual
cesium atoms drift away from the pool
at approximately the speed of sound.
All of the cesium atoms emitted exist
at either of two energy levels. The
energy level of each atom depends on
the relative orientation of the dipole
moments created by the spins of the
nucleus and its valence electron. The
two energy levels are indicated in
Figure 1 by the symbols labeled Atom
# 1 and Atom # 2.
Magnetic Controlled
On their way to the RF chamber
the cesium atoms pass through the field
of the first DC magnet. The effect of
this field on the individual atoms de-
pends on the original orientation of
the dipole moments and the nucleus.
Atoms at the energy level indicated by
Atom ±j: 1 are deflected to the wall of
the tube; those at the Atom # 2 energy
level are directed along the beam path
into the RF chamber. Thus, the first
DC magnet acts like a discriminator,
sorting atoms according to their origi-
nal energy state and admitting to the
RF chamber only those with the orien-
tation of Atom # 2.
The RF chamber is excited by a sig-
nal generated locally in the Atomi-
chron. When the field thus produced
is at the precise frequency of cesium

large number of the cesium atoms
passing through it will absorb electro-
magnetic energy and be "flopped" over
to the energy level corresponding to
Atom # 1. As the field deviates from
the frequency of cesium resonance,
fewer and fewer atoms change energy
level while passing through it. Since
all of the cesium atoms which entered
the RF chamber were at the energy
energy level of Atom ^r 1 were de-
flected out of the beam path by the
first DC magnet, those arriving at the
second DC magnet must necessarily
have been "flopped" by the field in the
RF chamber. Hence, the number of
atoms which enter the Detector indi-
cates the proximity of the RF field to
the frequency of cesium resonance.
The cesium atoms which enter the
Detector strike an ionizing target and

tive number of these which are "flop-

vides a continuous indication of the
proximity of the RF field to the fre-
quency of cesium resonance.
A Second Magnet
After the cesium atoms leave the
RF chamber they pass through the
field of the second DC magnet. This
field affects them in the same manner
as the field of the first DC magnet,
except in this case the magnet is posi-
tioned so that atoms with the configur-
ation of Atom # 2 are deflected out
of the beam path. Those atoms at the
energy level indicated by Atom # 1
are directed into the Detector. Since
all atoms which were originally at the
are attracted by means of a mass spec-
trometer to the cathode of an electron
multiplier where their effect is ampli-
fied a million times. The output of the
electron multiplier is a current which
varies with the number and rapidity
of impingements of cesium atoms on
the cathode. As the RF varies from the
frequency of cesium resonance, the im-
pingements on the cathode of the elec-
tron multiplier decrease, causing a de-
crease in the current output of the
Detector. This effect is used as the
first step in a frequency correction
system which automatically adjusts the
frequency of the crystal oscillator and
the RF field so as to return it to the
standard value.
The output of the crystal oscillator
is thus continuously controlled by the
cesium resonance. Using a group of
frequency multipliers and dividers, any
frequency can be obtained from the
Atomichron with an accuracy of better
than one part in 10« cycles per second.
Figure 2 shows a block diagram of
the entire Atomichron. The basic signal
is generated by the five megacycle oscil-
lator. It is then multiplied to the
cesium resonance frequency and ap-
plied to the RF chamber of the Atomic
Beam Tube. After comparison with the
cesium in the tube, the error signal of
100 cps is amplified and applied to the
five megacycle oscillator to adjust its
frequency continuously to an accuracy
of one part in 10'J cycles per second.
Outputs are obtained from the frequen-
cy multiplier.
Superior Timepiece
The Atomichron offers many advan-
tages over previous time standards. The
National Bureau of Standards main-
tains a precise frequency standard in
Washington and calibrates it by obser-
vation of the stars. In order for others
to use this standard, the NBS broad-
casts a precise time signal by short
wave radio. Thus, other standards all
over the world can be adjusted to agree
with the one in Washington. However,
the finite transmission time of radio
signals means that at any appreciable
distance from Washington the trans-
mitted signal no longer is accurate.
Also, if radio communications should
fail, it would be impossible to keep
other time standards accurate. The
Atomichron does away with these prob-
lems. Two Atomichrons, each aligned
without reference to each other or to
any external standard, will keep the
same frequency within two parts in
101°. Moreover, it is expected that
this accuracy could be maintained for
over 100 years without failure.
Would you really like to know what
time it is? You can have a standard
model Atomichron for only $30,000.
Keep it with you always, it only weighs
500 pounds.

This is a reprint of an address
given by Mr. Chayne before the
annual Society of Automotive En-
gineers Convention held in Detroit
during the first week of January,
1962.
The engineer's primary job is the cre-
ative one of applying scientific knowl-
edge. This creative act is the "art" of
engineering. Thus, the prospective en-
gineering student should be exposed to
the art of engineering so as to develop
his "artistic talent."
In my many years of engineering,
engineering education always has been
a subject close to my heart. While it
may stem from experience, years back,
as a member of the teaching staff of
MIT, I think my concern and interest
is influenced more by 35 years of asso-
ciation with automotive research and
development engineers, both young and
old. I wish that my concern had been
shared by all engineers in the industry;
but unfortunately, it has not.
It has taken two rather recent
situations to bring industry and edu-
cators together on common grounds
where each can understand the other's
problems. The shortage of engineering
graduates since the late 1950's has con-
tinued to bring many agencies, both
government and private, into action
long overdue. During this same period,
accomplishments by the Russians in
outer space caused all Americans to
take a fresh look at the needs of the
science and engineering fields, both in
teaching and practice, and I am sure we
would all agree, as I once heard
stated, the Russians probably saved us
from an educational Pearl Harbor.
The colleges were first to move.
Critical review of curricula to upgrade
the level of graduates was accomplish-
ed at all progressive institutions. This
was a difficult task, because industry
had failed to express its needs in terms
of the education required for the grad-
uates it sought and needed. For this
reason, none of us can be too critical
of recent trends in engineering educa-
tion; instead, we must do more to im-
prove lines of communication between
industry and the colleges so they can
refine and improve course content to
get the most and develop the best in
the students who enroll. Industry has
another obligation. Our colleges can-
not supply the graduates we need if
the students do not come to them, am-
bitious to enter engineering and science
fields and possessed of adequate high
school preparation for such careers.
The decisions that produce our skilled
scientists and technicians are made, in
the main, before they arrive on the col-
lege campuses; industry can help by
becoming a motivator. The public re-
lations responsibility of technical socie-
ties to encourage youths to become
engineers and scientists by properly
describing the requirements, the work,
and the satisfactions derived from tech-
nical work must be accelerated greatly.
In our recent efforts, I am deeply
concerned that some of today's popular
conceptions about engineering and sci-
ence are misleading and inaccurate. As
a result, the distinguishing features of
the two fields are understood only
vaguely. I was impressed tremendously
by a statement prepared this year by a
committee of the School of Engineer-
ing faculty at MIT. I am quoting this
statement because I know that you too
will be impressed with its content.
Engineering is a profession. Its mem-
bers do creative work which results in
things that people need or want. These
things may be highways, submarines,
interplanetary vehicles, antibiotics, or
television. Science, on the other hand,
is a search for knowledge. The sci-
ence of mathematics extends abstract
knowledge. The science of physics ex-
lends organized knowledge of the
physical world. In each of these, con-
sideration can be limited to a carefully
isolated aspect of reality.
"The engineer must deal with reality
in all its aspects. He must not only be
competent to use the most classical and
the most modern parts of science, but
he must be able to devise and make a
product which will be used by people.
Moreover, he must assume professional
responsibility insofar as the safety and

well-being of people are affected by the
thing he makes.
"A sound program which majors in
engineering or one of its branches —
civil, mechanical, chemical, etc. — will
be the most stimulating and rewarding
undergraduate experience for the great
majority of candidates for engineering.
They will find in it not only the science
of the modern physicist, but also the
other kinds of science — for example,
fluid mechanics, or electric-circuit the-
ory — which the engineer uses and
develops as incisive means for resolving
the complex problems of the real
world. Such a program grows out of
an educational environment created by
men in contact with the world of
people and industry which serves the
people. It will include attention to the
furtherance of many parts of science
which are of special interest to the
engineer.
"Engineering education is being ur-
gently called upon to produce gradu-
ates well versed in rapidly advancing
science who will lead industry and the
public into the new world which engi-
neering will make possible. Engineers
will often discover in science through
their own research and invention or
through the findings of scientists those
things which can be put to human
use. In any engineering achievement,
however, the thing produced is the ob-
jective, and all means available to the
intellect of man will be employed to
reach that objective. Science and its
application remain a part, but only a
part, of any great engineering advance.
Supersonic aircraft could have been de-
vised and made only by engineeers with
great resources in science. In order to
make the first supersonic airplane, how-
ever, science had to be combined with
the engineer's drive toward creation of
a predetermined object. Young people
who can respond to this kind of chal-
lenge are needed now, but they will be
needed as never before in the years
ahead."
I wish that this statement could be
available to every student before he
determines his choice for a career.
Industry responsibility does not end
with public relations. Instead, we must
conscientiously evaluate the recent
trends in engineering education so that
we may help the colleges retain the
good ones and refine those that need
improvement.
I think of one trend with extreme
concern. I think of it as principle
versus application. It entails the chang-
ing of curricula to include more mathe-
matics, more science, more humanities,
and less of the vaguely called "engi-
neering practice." This must be evalu-
ated carefully to determine whether
such moves will or will not produce an
engineer capable of handling tomor-
row's problem. We must also remember
that these same men are being trained
for the next 40 years of usefulness.
A sound engineering curriculum
must have laboratory courses. Such
courses should require the student to
apply analytical skill and knowledge.
Laboratory work should not be on
projects with known answers. Why
make the student waste time to prove
some known fundamental? Instead,
give him projects which will be a test
of originality and creativity. Let the
laboratory teach the students teamwork
—put them in working groups. Let it
teach them how to work with tools. I
don't mean hammer and screw driver; I
mean such tools as the oscilloscope, a
dynamometer, an analog computer,
strain gages, and so forth.
Let it help them develop skills. The
engineering curriculum cannot be al-
lowed to gravitate to one producing
only applied mathematicians. Picture
the musician who has great fundamen-
tal knowledge of music but lacks the
skill to apply it.
Let the laboratory course serve three
primary purposes:
1. Let it nurture a thorough under-
standing of the course content so that
such learning can be applied to a real-
istic project in keeping with the times,
rather than proving the fundamentals
read in the text.
2. Let it uncover and encourage orig-
inality and creativity.
3. Let it develop skill in communica-
tion through both the oral and written
report. (Continued on page 24)

replacing conventional fastening
methods.
Sticking things together with adhe-
sive is both an old and a new art.
Thousands of years ago the ancient
Egyptians used vegetable-based adhe-
Advantages In Use
Adhesives have many advantages
over other methods of joining. Because
they provide uniform, continuous bond-
ing, they prevent the localized stress
build-up which occurs with the use of
rivet or bolt fasteners. Stress on these
fasteners is transferred to a very small,
surrounding surface area; and it is there
that failure so often appears. Adhesives
distribute this stress over the entire area
of contact between the surfaces being
The demands of the aircraft industry
have contributed much to the develop-
ment of adhesives. Airplane wings or
similar outside surfaces are not as effi-
cient with rivet-heads protruding from
them, as such projections produce drag.
Whereas surfaces bonded with adhe-
sives have flat contours and are less
prone to failure.
Types Of Adhesives
Like plastics, synthetic adhesives can
be divided into two groups, thermo-

sives, especially those made from flour.
Then during the nineteenth century
animal-based adhesives were intro-
duced. And about fifty years ago, syn-
thetic resin and rubber adhesives were
developed. It is in this field of syn-
thetic adhesives that the phenomenal
growth and rapid development of the
adhesive industry is taking place.
The recent growth in this field can
be attributed to two factors: design
changes in machinery and equipment
and the modern requirements of indus-
try for new methods of joining parts,
and a larger public demand for these
new and useful products. A discussion
of the former reason and a brief in-
troduction to the technique of design-
ing with, and using adhesives will be
considered.
joined. This is especially important
when thin surfaces which can withstand
little stress are to be joined.
Machining the metal for the inser-
tion of fasteners is unnecessary with
adhesives. Such operations as counter-
sinking, for example, are eliminated
saving considerable time and cost. Also,
excessive distortion caused by machin-
ing and especially by welding or braz-
ing is no longer a problem.
Bonded assemblies have a high resist-
ance to fatigue because of the inherent
elasticity present in adhesives. In fact,
the metals to be bonded often fatigue
before the bonding material. This bond
can also be used as electrical or thermal
insulation between the surfaces; and it
prevents bimetallic corrosion when it
is used to join two dissimilar metals.
setting and thermoplastic. The thermo-
setting are heat cured, and cannot be
remelted. The thermoplastic, on the
other hand, can be remelted whenever
desired by applying heat, and hardened
by cooling. In general, the former can
be used at higher temperatures than
the thermoplastic types; and they ex-
hibit less thermal expansion or creep.
Though the thermoplastic types are us-
ually not very effective under static
loading, they are easier to use and have
a greater fatigue resistance associated
with their higher elasticity.
Designing With Adhesives
When designing with adhesives,
there are four kinds of stress to con-
sider. Tension is the familiar stress in-
troduced when a bonded member is
pulled perpendicular to the bonded sur-
16

bonded surface. In peel stress, which
is important in flexible materials, one
force is perpendicular to the bonded
surface and the other is in the plane of
the surface. Here, as the member under
the perpendicular force bends toward
the force (the force must be one of
tension rather than compression), the
stress is concentrated on a thin line at
the edge of the bond, causing undue
strain at this line. Cleavage is similar
Rule number one is especially im-
portant in designing joints to take
shear stress, since the shear strength is
directly proportional to the width of
the joint. These rules apply in degrees
to all types of joints. In the applica-
tion of rule number four, peel and
cleavage are usually avoided since most
adhesives are susceptible to these forms
of stress.
The most generally used adhesive
joint is the lap or shear joint. Also
gle lap joint, a good practical joint
which places the entire loadbearing area
in the same plane as the shear stress,
also preventing cleavage. Application
of the second principle produces the
beveled or tapered lap. This joint is
quite efficient, allowing bending to oc-
cur when the joint is distorted by stress.
But, it is usually impractical because it
is difficult to machine. Different ap-
plications of these principles yields the
various other modified joints.

to tension, except that the forces are
not exactly perpendicular to the bond-
ed surface. They are unevenly distri-
buted between the edges of the joint,
and, therefore, weaken it. Of course,
more than one type of stress is usually
present in any given joint.
Four rules have been developed for
designing joints.
They arei
1. Make the bonded area as large as
possible.
2. Make the maximum proportion of
bonded area contribute to strength.
3. Stress the adhesive in the direc-
tion of its maximum strength.
4. Minimize stress in the direction
in which the adhesive is weakest.
used, are many stronger modifications
of the simple lap. To illustrate how
the four previously stated rules are ap-
plied, these modified lap joints will be
considered.
Three design alternatives are open to
increase performance.2
1. The joint can be redesigned to
bring the tension load on the adher-
ents in line.
2. The edges of the bond area can
be tapered to provide a better length
to thickness ratio, thus minimizing peel
stress.
3. The adherents can be made more
rigid near the bond area to minimize
cleavage.
The first principle results in the jog-

nesota Mining and Manufacturing Company.
There are many other types of joints
where adhesives are used, but space
does not allow discussion of their char-
acteristics. They include angle joints,
butt joints, and stiffener joints (e.g.
corrugated backing).
Using Adhesives
The use of adhesives usually entails
the following four steps: (1.) prepar-
ing the surfaces, (2.) applying the ad-
hesive, (3.) assembling the compo-
nents, (4.) bonding the assembly. Each
of these steps will be briefly considered.
Preparation of the surface obviously
depends upon the type of surfaces to
be bonded. Cleanliness is the major ob-
jective in all cases. Metals are abrasive-
ly cleaned or treated with chemical
cleansing agents to remove dirt, cor-
rosion, and grease. Plastics and rubber

bestos board, and other such materials
are usually cleaned physically by means
of air jets, etc.
There are many ways of applying ad-
hesives to the cleaned surfaces. Spray
coating is similar to spray painting.
Roller coating is useful for continuous
coating of sheets. Brush coating may
be done by hand, much like painting,
or by machine-driven brushes. Large
stationary jobs (e.g. laying linoleum)
are done by hand troweling. Other
methods available include dipping, ex-
truding, reverse roller coating, and silk
screening.
Bonding methods used on the adhe-
sives vary with the adhesives being
used. With some, heat melts, cooling is
all that is necessary. Others demand
drying, polymerization under heat and/
or pressure, or chemical action of an-
other type. Various equipment is avail-
able to perform these various bonding
and curing tasks.
Adhesives are extremely useful when
used in the correct application and
manner. They are, in some cases, the
only joining method available. But, in
the majority of uses, they are compet-
ing with other types of fasteners and
attaching devices. Their great utility
lies in the large number of types avail-
able and their variety of properties and
production techniques. This utility will
no doubt increase because the large
amount of knowledge presently becom-
ing available in the fields of polymeri-
zation and surface chemistry will yield
new and varied adhesives, uses, and
techniques.

Bio-Engineering To Be Offered
Next Fall
Bio-Engineering is the name of a
new program that will be offered by the
College of Engineering next fall. This
program will combine studies in the
engineering area with those in the med-
ical and biological areas.
The new program was organized by
the College of Engineering in coopera-
tion with the Medical School, the
School of Public Health and the Col-
lege of Literature, Science and the Arts.
Under it a student may take courses
for credit in a wide range of subjects,
such as anatomy, botany, bacteriology,
and zoology. The program will be in-
troduced to faculty and students by
means of seminars held during the
spring, and qualified students will be
admitted to it next fall. Eventually a
degree at the graduate level may be
offered.
Dean Stephen S. Attwood, dean of
the College of Engineering, gave the
following comment on the Bio-Engi-
neering program:
"Until recently engineers have
generally been concerned with phy-
sical laws and their economic ap-
plications. This program is taking
a very large step forward by
training engineers in biological
sciences. With adequate knowledge
of the life sciences they may more
effectively utilize their engineer-
ing backgrounds for constructive
professional work in these areas."
The need for the Bio-Engineering
program was expressed by Dean Glenn
V. Edmonson, associate dean of the
College of Engineering. He noted that,
"There are very few tasks in engineer-
ing now that are not associated with
the human being and his reactions; en-
gineering is more and more related to
the living cell."

Research Ship To Sail For Michigan
The Inland Seas, a 114 foot ship, will
be doing major research work for the
University on the Great Lakes this sum-
mer. She comes to Michigan from the
National Parks Service, where she was
called the Ranger II, and sailed regu-
larly from Houghton, Michigan to Isle
Royale in Lake Superior. She is cur-
rently in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin,
where she is being refitted for her re-
search operations.
The Inland Seas is a result of a
$233,400 grant from the National Sci-
ence Foundation to the Great Lakes
Research Division of the Institute of
Science and Technology here at the
University. The grant was for two re-
search vessels; a smaller 50 foot craft
is currently being built and will go in-
to operation this summer. Together the
two vessels will expand the research
being done on the Great Lakes by both
Michigan scientists and interested
groups from other institutions.
The Inland Seas has a 27-foot beam
and a 12-foot draft. She is equipped
with two 230 horsepower Diesel en-
gines, and has a cruising speed of 10
knots. She can sleep 20 men, which
will enable her to remain at a research
site for long periods of time.
The Great Lakes Research Division
will use both ships on research pro-
grams that are being sponsored by such
national agencies, as the National Sci-
ence Foundation, the National Institute

Commission. The programs will study
such things as water quality and circu-
lation, how the lakes and weather af-
fect one another, the history of the
lakes, and the geology of the lakes'
basin. The research programs will also
include biological studies ranging from
the study of minute organisms that de-
compose waste to the important fish
and water fowl problems.

Laser To Spotlight The Moon
In a recent meeting of the American
Optical Society here at Michigan, Pro-
fessor Peter A. Franken of the physics
department described some novel ex-
periments that use a LASER, an intense
electronic light source. These experi-
ments include the reflecting of light
off the surface of the moon, off a satel-
lite and the triggering of a small ther-
monuclear reaction.
The laser, which is a word derived
from Light Amplification by Stimulat-
ed Emission of Radiation, is a device
that is capable of producing light in-
tensities that are millions of times
greater than those on the surface of the
sun.
In one experiment described by Pro-
fessor Franken, the laser's light beam
will be focused on the moon through
the University's 37-inch telescope. It
will take the light approximately two
and a half seconds to reflect off the
moon and return to earth. When the
light beam leaves the telescope it will
be strong enough to be visable to the
naked eye 20 million miles away. How-
ever, when it strikes the moon's sur-
face, it will be scattered and only a
small fraction of it will be directed
back towards its source. During this
time an extremely sensitive light meas-
uring device will be placed in the tele-
scope to measure the reflected light.
This experiment will be used to gather
data for a satellite experiment that will
follow it.
The satellite experiment will be used
to compare the speed of light with the
speed of extremely small radio waves.
A satellite will be placed in orbit
equipped with a special corner reflec-
tor, which will provide a much strong-
er echo from the radio and light waves.
The radio and light sources will be si-

The vessel, Inland Seas, to be used by the Institute of Science and Technology
for research on the Great Lakes.
multaneously beamed at the satellite
and the time it takes them to travel to
and from the satellite will be measured.
This time can be accurately measured
to one part in a hundred million. The
experiment is expected to prove that
light and radio waves travel at the
same speed in a vacuum.
When a corner reflector can be
placed on the moon, a procedure sim-
ilar to that used in the satellite experi-
ment will make it possible to measure
a relative change in the distance be-
tween the earth and the moon to an
accuracy of within two feet.
Lasers are capable of producing light
beams with power densities up to 10•■*
watts/cm^, whereas the power density
on the sun's surface is 10&lt;&gt; watts/cm'-'.
This intense power concentration of a
laser beam has led scientists to consider
it for use as the trigger of a brief ther-
monuclear reaction. Professor Franken
believes that a modern laser may be
able to get a tiny bit of heavy hydrogen
hot enough to allow a few thermonu-
clear reactions to take place, but does
not believe this method could be used
to obtain an efficient source of thermo-
nuclear power.

Reliability
"The Cost of Testing and Reliabil-
ity," was the topic of a recent seminar
on Engineering for Reliability given by
the Department of Mechanical Engi-
neering. The seminar was attended by
some 200 chief designers and engineer-
ing executives.
In a speech on the main topic, Pro-
fessor Charles Lipson, of the Depart-
ment of Mechanical Engineering, said,
"The cost of testing is the major por-
tion of the budget of an engineering
department in any organization." Pro-
fessor Lipson goes on to say that "to
reduce testing costs, reliability should
be designed into a product."
The tried and true method of ob-
taining reliability in a product is to test
parts after design and initial produc-
tion, then to redesign and retool to

People . . . and ideas ... do best in
a favorable environment.
At NASA, scientists and engineers
are favored by many "climatic" ad-
vantages, for the vigor, the impor-
tance, the scope and urgency of
America's space program demands
the best environment the nation can
provide.
For professional employees NASA
offers a graduate study program sec-
ond to none. While on full salary,
you can take graduate courses for
credit during work hours at nearby
universities, tuition-free. In-house
seminars led by world-famous sci-
entists and engineers are offered. In
addition, NASA scientists and engi-
neers benefit by early professional
recognition, a wide choice of work
areas, unmatched facilities, and par-
ticipation in history-making projects.
Truly this is growth climate, where
career opportunities are as unlimited
as the scope of NASA's many aero-
nautical and space exploration activ-
ities. Here, the harvest of your ideas
and discoveries may contribute to
the benefit and enrichment of all
mankind.
NASA has urgent need now for large
numbers of qualified scientists and

Automatic cars with button and lever
controls may seem far out right now. But
Ford Motor Company scientists and engi-
neers are busy prying out and buttoning
down some fantastic computer-
controlled guidance systems for future
Ford-built cars.
Among the controls now under study at
Ford is a radar system that warns a
driver when he gets too close to the
vehicle ahead. Another is a short-range
radio frequency device that extends the
limits of drivers' senses by giving advance
information on road surface and weather
conditions, evaluating and appraising
obstacles in the driving path ahead.
When developed, control systems like
these will enable drivers to enjoy safer,
faster driving without fatigue.
Advanced studies of this nature are but
a part of a continuous and wide-ranging
program that has gained Ford its place
of leadership through scientific research
and engineering.

correct failures discovered after the
product was built. This method is more
expensive than the newer method dis-
cussed at the seminar which considers
a product's reliability not only before
the product is built, but before it is
even designed.
The new "before-the-fact" approach
involves the use of "interference the-
ory," Professor Lipson pointed out. In
this approach, expected stress and
strength distributions are statistically
compared; and the probable number of
failures is predicted. After the predic-
tions are made, they are verified by
testing; however, the testing experi-
ments now are designed specifically to
verify the predicted values.
Professor Lipson also recommended
that every industrial organization have
a group of specialists to examine parts
that have failed to see what in their
history caused the failure. He noted
that an increasing number of manufac-
turing organizations have formed reli-
ability departments in the last few
years.

Glaciologist Studies The Ross Ice Shelf
Dr. Charles W. M. Swithinbank, a
glaciologist here at the University, has
just returned from a summer at the
South Pole. Dr. Swithinbank's trip to
the deep freeze of the world was part
of the University's long range study
of the Ross Ice Shelf, and it was his
third successive season in the Ant-
arctica.
While on the cold continent, Dr.
Swithinbank led a three-man party to
Mt. Betty, 325 miles from the South
Pole. Here his party found, buried in
a rock cairn, a 32-year old note left by
members of Admiral Byrd's first Ant-
arctic expedition. It was on this same
ridge that the Byrd party had found
an 18-year old note left by the famed
Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen,
the first man to reach the South Pole.
The Ross Ice Shelf is the world's
largest unbroken mass of floating ice.
Scientists believe that the equilibrium
between the amount of ice being fed
the ice shelf by glaciers, and the
amount of ice breaking off into the
sea is an important factor in predicting
future climatic trends. Therefore, the
ice shelf deserves careful study.
Dr. Swithinbank was accompanied
on this study by members of the staffs
of the University of Minnesota, the
U.S. Geological Survey and by mem-
bers of the staff here at the Univer-
sity. The team conducted measurements
on seven of the largest glaciers that
feed the Ross Ice Shelf. One of the
facts they found was that the glaciers
moved faster than expected, approxi-
mately five feet per day.

Dr. Charles W. M. Swithinbank, Uni-
versity glaciologist, who has recently
returned from the South Pole where he
participated in the University's Ross Ice
Shelf study.
Dr. Swithinbank said that during
December and January, the middle of
the Antarctic summer, the tempera-
ture ranged between 20 and 30 degrees
F., probably warmer than it was back
in Michigan at the same time.
LET'S LEAVE
(Continued from page 15)
Speaking of communication, drafting
is probably the engineer's most effec-
tive means of communication. Just as
picture writing, the first form of writ-
ten communication, was used to express
thoughts and records, so do engineers
working with graphics mold intangible
ideas and theories into tangible goods
and products. Yet, there is a shocking
tendency in present engineering educa-
tion to minimize the importance of
drafting.
In applying for their first job after
graduation, the majority of young en-
gineers express a definite preference for
experimental and testing work rather
than for design. To them, design is
associated with the drawing board, and
they have been led to believe that work
on a drawing board is of a menial na-
ture, perhaps all right for a draftsman,
but certainly beneath the dignity of a
graduate engineer.
I have found, however, that these
same young engineers, after two or
three years in experimental or test ac-
tivities, usually request a transfer to
design work. They have learned by
actual experience that the real creative
engineering is done in the drafting
room and that there must be a design
before there can be a test or experi-
mental program. As with any language,
skill can be obtained only by practice,
and certainly a few months of mini-
mum drafting training received in col-
lege cannot be considered adequate
practice for mastering such a vital skill.
Before dropping the subject of com-
munication, let me emphasize the need
to produce as a byproduct of every en-
gineering course the ability to speak
and to write. The young engineer who
cannot express himself is certainly
never going to sell his idea to his boss.
He will fall by the wayside very quick-
iy-
Dr. Gordon B. Carson, Vice Presi-
dent of Ohio State University, im-
pressed me tremendously in a talk in
which he outlined the ultimate objec-
tives of education. I would like to
quote him.
"First, is to teach the student to
think.
24
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


"Second, teach him to make deci-
sions, which too many people abhor;
decisions based upon sound thinking.
"Third, the student has to learn how
to act upon these decisions so that he
accomplishes his mission.
"What is needed? Three things; in-
tellect, skill, and tools."
Remember, this was an educator
speaking, not a man of industry. Yet,
would any of us in industry disagree
with his words? I know he speaks for
all of us.
As industry men, we are quick to
respond to the needs of engineering
curricula. But we are lost for words
when asked how do you do it in four
years. If it must be done in four, na-
turally there needs to be change. Each
year our profession approaches a higher
degree of specialization. As long as
science and engineering continue to be
four-year programs, less emphasis must
be placed on specialization and more
emphasis placed on fundamental
courses. Industry and graduate schools
must provide the necessary training for
specialization beyond the normal sepa-
ration of mechanical engineeering,
chemical, civil, and so forth. Industry
does not expect the colleges to equip
the students with technical training pat-
terned to the needs of all businesses —
particularly in four years. While engi-
neering at some schools is now a five-
year program, most schools are struggl-
ing to prepare the engineers in four
years. And many of them are doing a
good job of it. Obviously, though, at
the current accelerated growth in tech-
nology, it is questionable how long the
four-year schools can hold out.
Educational circles have shown some
concern that failure of the engineering
profession to insist on graduate work
as part of its educational requirements
may lead the young, intelligent student,
who normally would have been in-
terested in engineering but see the
complexity of the future, to have little
choice but to join the forces of the
applied scientist. Although this is hap-
pening, I do not show the same con-
cern. I think the upgrading of the
engineering curricula, and the contin-
ued improvement in professional com-
munication with students at high school
level, will bring engineering and sci-
ence back into proper alignment and
clear up some of the current confusion.
I feel rather strongly about the rela-
tionship between scientists and engi-
neers. I believe the situation was very
well expressed by Dr. T. Keith Glen-
nan, head of Case Institute, in a speech
to a national meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science. Dr. Glen nan quoted Dr.
Hrones, also of Case Institute, as fol-
lows:
"The great engineering achievements
of the past decade are always attributed
to the scientist, and the role of the
engineer is never delineated. The de-
velopment of the atomic bomb, the
development of nuclear power, the de-
velopment of satellites and space probes
are all spoken of as scientific achieve-
ments where, in reality, they are major
engineering accomplishments. True
enough, science unlocked important
secrets of nature to make them possible,
but yet, the real achievement has been
an engineering one."
Dr. Glennan continued, "Lest I be
misunderstood, let me hasten to say
that I do not advocate any less em-
phasis on science and its importance.
Far from it! But I do urge a compar-
able emphasis on the role and impor-
tance of the engineer. I do not suggest
that the two professions should pull
apart. On the contrary, each profession
will be well served by an ever closer
partnership between the two. Indeed,
science and engineering should be
speaking with mutual supporting voices
in our national councils."
I might add that the present situa-
tion is so poor that when a missile fir-
ing is successful and the missile arrives
on target, it is referred to as a great sci-
entific achievement; but if something
malfunctions and the firing fails, it is
an engineering failure. Perhaps this is
stretching a point, but as engineers I
thought you might appreciate this ob-
servation. One cannot discuss trends
in engineering education without refer-
ence to change brought about by mod-
ern computers. Such machines not only
influence the profession, but engineer-
ing education as well. Since it now is
possible to solve the more complex
problems more rapidly, the whole phil-
osophy of tackling problems is being
changed. Fortunately, the engineer in
industry, as a result of problem solving
machines and modern instrumentation,
is finding time to do more engineering
and less of the routine work. This
places the engineer in a more impor-
tant role in an engineering organiza-
tion and requires greater attention to
the development of supporting techni-
cal personnel — the technicians.
Engineering technicians constitute
one of the industry's most acute prob-
lems. College, two-year technical pro-
grams do a fine job in developing
technician talent. Obviously, they also
do a fine job in selling the students on
the virtues of a degree in engineering.
I say this because at my place of em-
ployment we find the two-year man
anxious to return to school at the first
opportunity to earn his degree.
Another area leaves a lot to question.
Many educators propose that the study
of humanities and social sciences is
essential for engineering students. I
know that this is a dangerous area to
discuss. 7 would agree that the present
time allotted for this study is entirely
inadequate. BUT, I would also agree
that in many colleges we do not do as
well as we might with the time that is
available. I actually feel that this ques-
tion of humanities is more a matter of
definition, and the colleges are doing a
better job than they themselves give
credit. / cannot see a strengthening of
the curricula by adding courses in the
humanities at the expense of courses in
engineering. The sciences are not equiv-
alents or substitutes for the humanities
nor vice versa. Since the Humanities
Departments of our schools have un-
dertaken the job of teaching the langu-
ages, why not give them the responsi-
bility of teaching one more—drafting?
This will increase the humanities con-
tent of the curricula and at the same
time give drafting its proper status as
an engineering language.
In closing, if I were asked to com-
ment in one brief sentence on my reac-
tion to current trends in engineering
education, this would be my reply:
"Let's leave engineering in engineering
education."

For Lighter, Stronger Parts
■B

Maximum utilization of different metals is classically
illustrated by these three designs for an equalizer bar
for tandem trailer springs. This part evolved through
several design changes as the user sought the best
combination of low cost, high strength, minimum
weight. The two parts at the top performed satisfac-
torily and were well designed for their respective pro-
duction methods. A Malleable castings designer, taking
advantage of the high tensile strength of pearlitic
Malleable, originated the "U" section design, shown
at the bottom, which results in least weight, lowest
cost and greatest strength.

Six Steps In Designing Minimum Weight

By following these basic steps, designers can take advan-
tage of Malleabte's high strength and excellent thin-section
castability to produce rugged, lightweight Malleable cast-
ings. Early consultation with your Malleable producer can

A castaway on a desert island, fol-

ashore a girl clinging to a barrel.
"How long have you been here?"

"All alone—then you're going to

"You don't mean to tell me that

She nodded absently and said, "Oh,
yes. I knew there was something I
shouldn't offer you."

a man allowed to have more than one
wife?"

The boss was chasing his secretary
as usual. He suggested, "Let's go up to

Father yells downstairs at 2 a.m.
"Daughter, that young man of yours

name someone with an infallible mem-
ory whom the devil couldn't fool. The
devil took him up and was referred to
an old Indian chief in Arizona. Satan
went up to him and asked the redskin
if he liked eggs. The Indian said, "Yes,
I do." Satan then went away for thirty
years after which he suddenly ap-
proached the Indian again and said,
"How." The old chief answered,
"Fried."
The bachelor sent in his income tax
report claiming one son as a dependent.
His report was returned with a note
which said, "This must be a steno-
graphical error."
He returned the report with another
note attached reading, "You're telling
me?"
A farmer and a professor were shar-
ing a seat on a train. It was getting
lonesome so the farmer started a con-
versation and they soon became a
friendly pair.
"Let's have a game of riddles to pass
the time," said the professor, "If I have
a riddle that you can't guess you give
me a dollar or vice versa."
"All right," replied the farmer. "But
since you are better educated than I
am, do you mind if I give you only
fifty cents?"
"OK," replied the professor. "You
go first."
"Well, who said, 'Two spiders may-
be mad at each other, but they could
still step on a third spider.'"
"I don't know. Here's your dollar.
What's the answer?"
"I don't know either. Here's your
fifty cents," answered the farmer.
A drunk was driving the wrong way
down a one-way street when a cop
pulled him over and said, "Hey buddy,
where do you think you're going?"
The drunk replied, "I don't know
but I must be late, everybody else is
coming back."

DEEP-STRENGTH (Asphalt-Base) pavement
With today's "giant step forward" in pavement engineering—
DEEP-STRENGTH (Asphalt-Base) pavement—there is need for
engineers with a solid background in the fundamentals of
Asphalt technology and pavement construction.
Because new DEEP-STRENGTH Asphalt-base
construction provides the most durable, most
economical pavement modern engineering science
has developed, Interstate and primary superhigh-
ways in all parts of the country are being built with
advanced design DEEP-STRENGTH Asphalt pavement.
Already, more than 90% of America's paved roads and
streets are surfaced with Asphalt. And Asphalt pavements
have successfully kept America's wheels rolling since 1876.
Your contribution—and reward—in our nation's vast road-
building program can depend on your knowledge of modern
Asphalt technology. So, prepare for your future now. Write for
your free "Student Kit" about Asphalt technology.

Nike-Cajun rocket with grenade payload for measuring temperature and winds in the upper atmosphere.
Both the rocket and the payload were developed by the high altitude research group in the Department of
Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering. The grenade experiment gas has been used extensively at all
latitudes from the tropics to the arctic in a continuing program of high altitude aeronomy by NASA and the
University of Michigan. Space research is one of many interesting activities in this department, which has
developed new courses in such fields as orbital mechanics, hypersonics and magnetohydrodynamics to meet the
needs of the space technology industry. Since the beginning of aeronautical courses here in 1915 the
curriculum has broadened steadily to include both undergraduate and graduate work in aeronautics and
astronautics. Propulsion, Aerodynamics, Structures and Instrumentation are emphasized.

(random notes)
Densitometry in Lllliput
Photography is art, photography is
amusement, and more and more photog-
raphy is a way of packing information
and electronic circuitry. The packing
calls for thinking very, very small about
photography.
We cannot be blamed for feeling a little
wistful as we cheer photography's prog-
ress in Lilliput. A remarkably small
number of dollars worth of Kodak
High-Resolution Plates and Kodak
KPR Photo Resist are used up in pro-
ducing a remarkably large number of
solid-state microcircuits.
Fear not for us. We'll make out.
Nowhere will you catch us claiming
that this "micro" business is as easy as
falling off a log. Indeed, an appreciation
of the relationship between the logs of
exposure and reciprocal transmittance
makes scarcely more than a good begin-
ning toward controlling them on a micro
scale. Here the frequency response of a
photographic emulsion must be cascaded
with the frequency response of the other
components in the total picture-handling
system.
The game is widely believed to be
worth the candle. To shed light on what
is really going on, one needs to be able
to measure density reliably over an area
less than Vi micron wide, scanned in
synchronism with a recorder that re-
sponds logarithmically.
Not only do we use such instruments,
but we build them and sell them for
money to others. This benefits science
and cheers us up.

Faithful but flexible
We find the trick shown below helpful
in microscopic studies of profile sections
along objects like knives. The casting
material is our Epolene C-10 Polyethylene
Resin. You pour it at only 100°C. Yet
at room temperature the little casting
"remembers" its shape so accurately that
despite the twist of unpeeling, profile
details as small as 0.00009-in. radius
are preserved in the sliced sections,
and measurements are repeatable to
±0.00001". Then, if overheating is
avoided, you can remelt and reuse the
resin for more castings.
The man who came up with this trick
is on our payroll to ward off trouble
from micro-organisms in making film
and paper. He is a microbiologist and
has never been asked to contribute to
machine shop practice in order to
impress the plastics-molding trade.
Life can be devious instead of tedious.

GOOD PACKING NEEDS GOOD RESEARCH
From edible lubricants lo erasable copying
films, plenty of lively careers to be made
with Kodak in research, engineering, pro-
duction, marketing.
And whether you work for us or not.
photography in some form will probably
have a part in your work as years go on.
Now or later, feel free to ask for Kodak
literature or help on anything photographic.

Learned and scientific as we are, we
have not lost interest in simple consumer
goods.
If you really want to know the truth,
consumers are enjoying a simplicity kick
at present. We even suspect you of being
the type yourself. Otherwise we wouldn't
be advertising the Kodak Readymatic
500 Slide Projector to you.
It doesn't just scream "latest design!"
but quietly is.
If you buy like that, you will pay less
than S70 for a 500-watt 2x2 projector,
complete with case and 4-inch lens,
while sacrificing neither optical perform-
ance nor ease of slide-changing nor
ruggedness of construction.
If you engineer like that, you will have
a prosperous career with a manufactur-
ing organization that values its reputation.

An interview with General Electric's W. Scott Hill
Manager—Engineering Recruiting
One af a series.
Q. Mr. Hill, I've heard that my first
five years in industry may be the most
critical of my career. Do you agree?
A. Definitely. It is during this stage
that you'll be sharpening your career
objectives, broadening your knowledge
and experience, finding your place in
professional practice and developing
work and study habits that you may
follow throughout your career. It's a
period fraught with challenge and op-
portunity—and possible pitfalls.
Recognizing the importance of this
period, the Engineers' Council for Pro-
fessional Development has published
an excellent kit of material for young
engineers. It is titled "Your First 5
Years." I would strongly recommend
you obtain a copy.*
Q. What can I do to make best use
of these important years?
A. First of all, be sure that the com-
pany you join provides ample opportun-
ity for professional development during
this critical phase of your career.
Then, develop a planned, organized
personal development program—tai-
lored to your own strengths, weaknesses
and aspirations—to make the most of
these opportunities. This, of course,
calls for a critical self appraisal, and
periodic reappraisals. You will find an
extremely useful guide for this pur-
pose in the "First 5 Years" kit I just
mentioned.
O. How does General Electric en-
courage self development during this
period?
A. In many ways. Because we recog-
nize professional self-development as a
never-ending process, we encourage
technical employees to continue their
education not only during their early
years but throughout their careers.
We do this through a variety of pro-
grams and incentives. General Electric's
Tuition Refund Program, for example,
provides up to 100% reimbursement for
tuition and fees incurred for graduate
study. Another enables the selected
graduate with proper qualifications to
obtain a master's degree, tuition free,
while earning up to 75% of his full-
time salary. These programs are sup-
How to Make the Most
of Your First Five Years
MR. HILL has managerial responsibility for General Electric's college recruiting activities
for engineers, scientists, PhD's and technicians for the engineering function of the
Company. Long active in technical personnel development within General Electric, he
also serves as vice president of the Engineers' Council for Professional Development,
board member of the Engineering Manpower Commission, director of the Engineering
Societies Personnel Service and as an officer or member of a variety of technical societies.
plemented by a wide range of techni-
cal and nontechnical in-plant courses
conducted at the graduate level by
recognized Company experts.
Frequent personal appraisals and en-
couragement for participation in pro-
fessional societies are still other ways
in which G.E. assists professional em-
ployees to develop their full potential.
Q. What about training programs?
Just how valuable are they to the
young engineer?
A. Quite valuable, generally. But there
are exceptions. Many seniors and grad-
uate students, for example, already have
clearly defined career goals and profes-
sional interests and demonstrated abili-
ties in a specific field. In such cases,
direct placement in a specific position
may be the better alternative.
Training programs, on the other
hand, provide the opportunity to gain
valuable on-the-job experience in sev-
eral fields while broadening your base
of knowledge through related course
study. This kind of training enables
you to bring your career objectives in-
to sharp focus and provides a solid
foundation for your development, wheth-
er your interests tend toward speciali-
zation or management. This is par-
ticularly true in a highly diversified
company like General Electric where
young technical graduates are exposed
to many facets of engineering and to
a variety of product areas.
Q. What types of training programs
does your company offer, Mr. Hill?
A. General Electric conducts a num-
ber of them. Those attracting the ma-
jority of technical graduates are the
Engineering and Science, Technical
Marketing and Manufacturing Train-
ing Programs. Each includes on-the-job
experience on full-time rotating assign-
ments supplemented by a formal study
curriculum.
Q. You mentioned professional so-
cieties. Do you feel there is any ad-
vantage in joining early in your career?
A. I do indeed. In fact, I would rec-
ommend you join a student chapter on
your campus now if you haven't already
done so.
Professional societies offer the young
engineer many opportunities to expand
his fund of knowledge through associa-
tion with leaders in his profession,
to gain recognition in his field, and to
make a real contribution to his profes-
sion. Because General Electric benefits
directly, the Company often helps de-
fray expenses incurred by professional
employees engaged in the activities of
these organizations.
Q. Is there anything I can do now to
better prepare myself for the transition
from college campus to industry?
A. There are many things, naturally,
most of which you are already doing
in the course of your education.
But there is one important area you
may be overlooking. I would suggest
you recognize now that your job—-
whatever it is—is going to be made
easier by the ability to communicate
. . . effectively. Learn to sell yourself
and your ideas. Our own experience at
General Electric—and industry-wide sur-
veys as well—indicates that the lack
of this ability can be one of the major
shortcomings of young technical grad-
uates.

lished bv the Engineers' Council for
Professional Development, normally
