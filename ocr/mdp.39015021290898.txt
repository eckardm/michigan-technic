through a satellite built by Westinghouse
Almost all we know about deep space we
learned by studying light . . . the faint,
flickering light from distant stars. Now,
suddenly, a whole new universe is opening
up to us through sound from the stars. It
comes via a satellite in which the British
Government, NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center and Westinghouse each had
a share.
This sound comes from millions of stars
which we never knew before, because they
emit no light. We couldn't hear them,
either, because the earth's atmosphere
shut off these noises, but now we can.
The satellite, Ariel II, also tells us how the
earth's heat balance affects weather and
how micrometeroids erode space ships.
The British developed the scientific
experiments. Westinghouse built the sat-
ellite and integrated the system. NASA
launched it.

Vapor Deposition of NbjSn
Apparatus for continuous vapor
deposition of niobium stannide on ribbon.
Very-high-field solenoids capable of generat-
ing fields of 100,000 gauss now made with cop-
per winding require about 100 tons of equip-
ment and dissipate more than one megawatt of
power as heat. Some superconductors, in par-
ticular the compound NbiSn, can carry large
electric currents with zero power dissipation
even at high magnetic fields.1 Hence, they can
be used for the construction of light weight
solenoids.
In the past, NbiSn was prepared by metal-
lurgical sintering techniques, which resulted in
a porous and extremely brittle material not
suitable for widespread use. In 1960, scientists
in the Materials Research Laboratory, David
SarnofT Research Center, developed a vapor-
phasc transport process for preparing this com-
pound for the first time in a dense crystalline
state—and in forms suitable for widespread use
in both research and application. It consists of a
simultaneous reduction of gaseous mixed chlo-
rides of niobium and tin by hydrogen at 900
to 1200°C.'
Based on this process, an apparatus was de-
veloped for continuous coating of refractory
metal and ribbon with NbiSn. The NbiSn
coated ribbon has both electrical and mechani-
cal properties desirable for solenoid construc-
tion. It is very thin (typical cross section is
2 x 90 mil, thickness of deposit about 0.3 mil)
and hence sufficiently ductile to wrap around
diameters as small as 1 s inch and it can support
enormous currents densities: 1 x 10* amp/cm1
at zero field, 3 x 105 amp/cm' in a transverse
DC field of 92,500 gauss and 1.5 x 101 amp/
cm in a pulsed longitudinal field of 170,000
gauss. By comparison, copper can carry only
1 x 101 amp/cm' safely. Hence, superconduc-
tive solenoids approaching a field of 200,000
gauss appear feasible.

Parametric Amplifier
Experiments at RCA Laboratories show that
superconducting films exhibit a nonlinear in-
ductance at frequencies extending well into the
millimeter-wave range. Frequency conversion
was observed in tin films cooled below their
critical temperature. Now amplification and
oscillation have also been demonstrated. A
superconducting "paramp" has been operated
at 6 kmc with II db of net gain. Parametric
oscillations at about the same frequency were
also effected.
The superconducting film and the varactor
differ markedly in many respects: hence, their
circuit needs also differ. A study of the charac-
teristics of superconducting films and paramet-
ric device requirements resulted in the concept
of the "modified dielectric resonator." The res-
onator, which was used to demonstrate amplifi-
cation, consists of a very low-loss, high-permit-
tivity, dielectric cavity modified at one of its
boundaries by a superconducting film.
The unit is placed in a waveguide where
power is coupled to it with a movable short-
circuit. The resonant frequency of the cavity is
a function of its dimensions, the permittivity of
the dielectric and the impedance of the film.
While it may be premature to speculate on
the eventual role of the superconducting
"paramp", it should be noted that the device,
in principle, offers an outstanding set of fea-
tures not to be found in the varactor or any
other device. First, the frequency limit of super-
conducting films may extend into the sub-milli-
meter wave range. Secondly, it is expected that
the noise performance of the device can match
that of the maser. Furthermore, superconduc-
tors can be pumped with considerably lower
power and at a lower frequency than either the
varactor or the maser. Finally, since one can
fabricate large-area films (as compared with
lumped varactors), wide-band truly distributed
traveling-wave parametric amplification may
become possible.

Superconductive Magnet
21
Recently RCA developed a superconductive
magnet believed to be the most powerful in the
world, in a practical form that can revolu-
tionize many aspects of solid-state electronics
and high-energy physics research.
Success of this magnet and the attainment of
zero current degradation using magnetic field
stabilization followed research in superconduc-
tive degradation phenomena.
The device generates a magnetic field of
107,000 gauss. When commercially available, it
will enable scores of small and medium-sized
research laboratories to carry out experiments
that now require large multi-million-dollar
facilities in order to generate the immense mag-
netic fields needed for solid-state, atomic, and
related areas of research.
Test data obtained under a NASA study
contract played a significant part in RCA's de-
velopment of the 107,000-gauss magnet. The
present experimental unit has a bore of one
inch, offering for the first time in a supercon-
ductive magnet a working area large enough
for practical laboratory experiments. The com-
pany is continuing its work for NASA, explor-
ing the feasibility of a 150,000-gauss supercon-
ductive magnet with a one-foot bore, designed
for experiments in space propulsion techniques.
The experimental 107,000-gauss unit was
built at the RCA Laboratories by an advanced
development group of the RCA Electronic
Components and Devices organization.
The experimental RCA magnet weighs 26
pounds and is about the size and shape of a
half-gallon paint can. It is made superconduc-
tive by immersion in liquid helium and is
started with the output of 6-volt storage batter-
ies. By contrast, nonsuperconductive magnets
developing similar magnetic fields require al-
most 1.5 million watts of power and enormous
water-cooling systems.

THE CHOICE
No doubt everyone is aware that this was the year of "the
choice." The choice was, hypothetically, between the Johnson
philosophy of increased federal involvement as the best solu-
tion to the social and economic problems of the nation and
the Goldwater philosophy of minimal federal involvement.
The campaign could have been interesting. The candidates
could have given the people a choice between these two signifi-
cantly different political philosophies, but they failed to do so.
Instead, they chose to engage in a campaign of personalities.
And of course there is nothing new about a campaign based
on personalities instead of issues, except that this time the
candidates have managed to expose a disturbing number of
undesirable qualities in each other.
First, consider Senator Goldwater. No one has, as yet,
questioned his integrity or his patriotism. Indeed in these
areas he seems to be beyond reproach. However, the Senator
has proven on numerous occasions that he is either badly
misinformed or just plain ignorant of the facts. He stands,
in many cases, for the same principles as his moderate Repub-
lican colleagues, but he has a bad habit of oversimplifying
the problems of the times. Everyone agrees that the situation
in Viet Nam is far from ideal, but what can we do about it?
Everyone agrees that there shouldn't be rioting and violence
in the streets, but what—without federal intervention—can we
do about it? Clearly Goldwater has pointed out problems of
which we are all aware, but he has not presented us with any
suggestions for the successful solution of these problems. This
is, quite probably, because he has none.
Now, if you will, consider President Johnson. No one
doubts that Lyndon Johnson is the best politician in the na-
tion today. However, some people, perhaps with good reason,
doubt his integrity. It seems strange that five days after the
polls closed in Texas in the 1948 Democratic primary for the
United States Senate, a precinct in Duval County should come
up with 203 uncounted votes, and that 202 of these should
be for Lyndon Johnson, giving him a victory by 87 votes.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


It is stranger still if one considers that only 600 ballots
were issued in that precinct and 1025 votes were counted. It
is also strange that Austin, Texas, is the only city of its size
in the country with only one television station, that Lyndon
Johnson owns that one station, and that no one else has been
able to acquire a permit to establish a station in that area.
It is also strange, that Lyndon Johnson, champion of civil
rights, should sell land after inserting a clause in the deed
prohibiting "any person or persons of African descent from
occupying the property except as domestic servants."*
One cannot help but wonder if President Johnson's rather
hypocritical stand on civil rights might not extend into other
areas. It has been said that Goldwater would rather be right
than President. However, Johnson, with his more or less non-
descript political philosophy, leaves the impression that he
would rather be President than right. Both of these positions
have their strong points, but the optimum philosophy lies
somewhere in between.
Yes, the campaign has missed most of the major issues of
the day, but possibly it has uncovered a more subtle and, in
the long run, a much more critical issue. Must this great na-
tion of ours, with all its power and with all its vast human
resources, sacrifice political savvy to obtain a President of
impeccable integrity? And, conversely, must this nation sacri-
fice impeccable integrity and adherence to principle to obtain
a President who can operate the political machinery? Let us
hope that this election year is a freak. Let us begin now to
find better candidates for both parties in 1968.

Is it possible that a leading maker of
jet engine turbine blades had a hand in
giving Pat Deegan a fresh sandwich
today that was made last night?
It's perfectly logical to assume that the nation's leading
producer of alloying metals like chromium, manganese,
tungsten, and vanadium could become an expert on
their use in new forms of steel. One result is the devel-
opment of a new kind of stronger stainless steel.
Nor would it be surprising that the nation's pioneer
and leading producer of plastic raw materials would
be selling plastic food bags with a new kind of fold-
lock top that locks in freshness. They're called "Glad"
Bags, and they keep Pat Deegan's lunch fresh even
though it was packed the night before.
But you'd have every reason to doubt that two such
unlike activities could come from the same
company. Provided you didn't know about
Union Carbide.
In fact, you'll come across lots of diversifi-
cations at Union Carbide. It's one of the world's largest
producers of chemicals, and it makes ingredients for
textiles, paint, and urethane foam for cushioning. It is
one of the most diversified private enterprises in the
field of atomic energy. As a world authority in super-
cold fluids, it produces tons of liquefied hydrogen,
oxygen, and nitrogen for fueling space vehicles. It's a
leader in carbon products and makes exhaust nozzle
liners for rockets, brushes for electric motors, and elec-
trodes for electric arc furnaces. And its consumer prod-
ucts include world-leading "Prestone" anti-freeze.
In fact, few other corporations are so deeply in-
volved in so many different skills and activities
that will affect the technical and production
capabilities of our next century.
The next century starts with Pat Deegan's lunch.

GERMAN
EDUCATION
by Tom Rauschenbach
One of the topics most frequently dis-
cussed on college campuses all over the
world is the quality of modern-day edu-
cation. More often than not, the college
student will find much to criticize in the
particular educational endeavor with
which he is familiar. Textbooks, curric-
ula, faculty, and administration are all
candidates for what is usually vociferous,
and sometimes responsible criticism. In
the interest of tying together some of
this criticism, the TECHNIC begins with
this article a new series on modern-day
education. Tom Rauschenbach, author of
"German Education," and a Fulbright ex-
change student to the University of Mich-
igan from Germany, here gives frank and
thoughtful comments on American and
German education as viewed from the
German perspective. In the months fol-
lowing the TECHNIC will present arti-
cles on Russian education, American
education, and others to complete the
series. Look next month for the Cooley
Essay for 1964, which this year is a dis-
cussion of American secondary school
education.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


summer, I knew little about the
American educational system. After
five months of studies at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, I still feel unquali-
fied to compare, in every detail, the
general set-up of German education
with the one in this country and to
draw objective conclusions of my
own. I must warn the reader, there-
fore, to expect a rather subjective
account and, in some points perhaps,
even unjust comparisons.
First of all, it might be useful to
give the reader a general idea of what
the educational system is like in Ger-
many.
From the age of six to ten, all chil-
dren attend the same elementary—or
as we call it—People's School. The
teaching methods there seem to be
much the same as in this country. In
the city states of Hamburg, Bremen,
and Berlin, elementary school lasts for
six years, after which the children
shift to either intermediate schools
("Mittelschulen") or secondary schools
("Gymnasien"). The former lead the
pupil to a final examination in grade
10 in which they can earn their so-
ralled "medium maturity" (Mittlere
Reife). This diploma entitles the hold-
ers to enter medium-level careers and
to continue their education at full-
time vocational schools. The second-
ary schools, on the other hand, which
take seven years, lead to the "Abitur,"
the final diploma which gives the
holders the right to enroll at colleges
and universities.
This set-up is slightly different in
the other eight German states. There,
the pupils decide after grade five
whether to shift to one of the above-
described schools or to stay in ele-
mentary school for another four years.
Secondary schools in some states still
require a stiff entrance examination.
However, such exams are gradually
being done away with, for German
educators rightly feel that they occur
too early in the child's life to reflect
his true intellectual qualifications.
Secondary Schools
The German secondary schools
offer three different approaches to
higher learning: The pupil can de-
clare his preference for either the
natural sciences, modern or classical
languages. After choosing, he has to
stick to the selected branch of his
school for the full term which lasts
from seven to nine years. The three
branches more or less offer the same
subjects. It is just that they empha-
size one or two subjects over another.
In the classical languages department,
for instance, which used to be the
traditional "Humanistic Gymnasium"
(the only tridy recognized institution
of higher learning at that time), atten-
tion is focused on the studies of
Latin and Greek. The other two
branches also offer Latin, but their
standards are lower in this field. They
in turn emphasize subjects neglected
in the department of classical lan-
guages.
There are many more differences.
My personal experience will enhance
this impression: having entered the
modern languages department of my
school I immediately started with
German, Math, and Latin which
were my main subjects. At the same
time I had Geography, Biology, Mus-
ic, Arts, and Sports which are rated
lower. In my second year, English,
Physics, and History were added; in
my third year French, and one year
later Chemistry. I had to take all these
subjects until grade 12, at which time
1 could drop French, Geology, Biol-
ogy, Arts, and Chemistry. In my last
year, I concentrated on the remaining
subjects, which were graded in the all-
important final examination. At the
same time I took non-credit courses
in French and literature.
The really big difference between
our secondary schools and the U.S.
high schools is the steadier and
much slower approach we take in
Germany. Some of the subjects are
taught for nine years, others for eight,
seven or six years. Also, the whole
schedule of classes is predetermined
by the school authorities, and the in-
dividual pupil cannot choose or drop
any of the subjects. Another differ-
ence lies in the grading system.
Throughout secondary school, there
are no exams until the big and com-
prehensive final "Abitur" exam. The
pupils (or rather their parents!) get
report cards twice annually, grades
for which are determined by several
written tests in the main subjects as
well as the general behavior of the
student in class. If he gets the lowest
grade in only one of the subjects he
has to repeat a whole school year and
cannot do so more than twice.
Successful passage of the "Abitur"
exam then qualifies the secondary
school student (and only him) to at-
tend the university.
The German University
The German university is also
quite different from the American
equivalent, in both its teaching meth-
ods and its technical set-up. There
are virtually no class-type lectures.
Students usually have to gather in
huge lecture halls, which seat up to
1,000 students, to listen to their pro-
professor, who often must use a micro-
phone. It is not surprising then that
communication between the students
and the professors is almost nil. The
individual student is left much to his
own initiative and self-discipline,
since one of the main principles of
the German university is academic
freedom. This means that the student
is free to stay away from lectures and
to pursue his studies the way he
chooses.
There is no such thing as freshman,
sophomore, senior and junior years,
or a distinction between graduates
and undergrads. They start in the
subject they choose immediately after
graduation from secondary school, and
are completely finished with univer-
sity after a certain minimum number
of semesters and, of course, a tough
comprehensive examination.
German university students study
hard, although this may not appear
so to outside observers. Lectures are
held only during seven months of the
year, with two or three month holi-
days between the semesters. It is dur-
ing this time that the student is ex-
pected to do the bulk of his work.
During the semester itself, up to 35
hours of lectures a week take up too
much time for the student to study
effectively.
Facilities and equipment in Ger-
man universities fall far below the
standard in this country. They are all
under the financial control of the
state governments, and although vast
sums of money are appropriated every
year to enlarge, improve, and even
found new universities, every effort
is again offset by the rapidly increas-
ing number of students. In the 1959-
60 term, enrollment passed the 200,-
000 mark, although the centers of
higher learning were only intended to
take some 150,000 students. This year,
the number of students is likely to

by James Berger
Author Berger has interviewed Pro-
fessor G. Hoyt Whipple, Professor of
Radiological Health at the School of Pub-
lic Health and Professor William Pierce,
Professor of Law and Director of the
University of Michigan Legislative Re-
search Center. Here he relates the opin-
ions on the increasing use of radioactive
materials and the problem of their safe
disposal.
The danger of peacetime radiation
has become one of the over-publi-
cized myths of our time, according to
a University of Michigan health phy-
sicist.
G. Hoyt Whipple, professor of ra-
diological health at the School of
Public Health contends that radio-
active wastes have less likelihood of
doing harm than any other type of
industrial pollution.
"Radioactive wastes are not the
only wastes, but just the most recent,"
Prof. Whipple said pointing out that
pollution from other types of indus-
trial wastes carries much more of a
potential danger than radioactivity.
"Radiation today is not an impor-
tant health problem nor is it likely
to become one," he asserted.
"Look at all the rivers and lakes
that industrial wastes have ruined."
Prof. Whipple added. "The Ohio
River was once one of America's most
beautiful and scenic valleys, but the
dumping of industrial waste has vir-
tually destroyed its beauty."
Prof. Whipple agreed that peace-
time nuclear reactors do create prob-
lems.
"We can't say there's no danger in-
volved in building an atomic reactor,"
he said. "But these dangers are less
than the gas system in your home."
Scientists and engineers subject the
reactor to more checks and more
assurances than any other mechanical
device ever introduced into our civil-
ization, he maintained.
"Our precautions in nuclear waste
disposal are thousands of times more
careful than those involved in the
disposal of any other type of wastes,"
he continued. "Never before has any-
thing been started out so carefully."
Prof. Whipple, sitting behind his
desk surrounded by scores of books
and research data on radioactivity,
has viewed the problem on a world-
wide basis. His travels have taken him
all over Europe.
"I just visited a beautiful new
reactor in Sweden," he said. "It's a
neat, underground operation with
practically no danger, but public
opinion forced them to reduce the
waste concentration to one thirtieth
of the internationally accepted limit,
and this will seriously affect the future
usefulness of the plant."
Prof. Whipple explained that prob-
lems like these constantly confront
any peacetime nuclear operation.
"With modern disposal methods,
people don't know how little danger
there is from peacetime nuclear activ-
ities," he asserted. "The risks to the
average person are small—much small-
er than the risks generally accepted
by most people, like riding in a car
or even taking a bath."
What are these 'risks' and what's
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the potential danger of radioactivity?
Ever since the world viewed the
horror of Hiroshima, radioactivity
has become the untamed wild beast
that could improve or destroy the
world.
The discovery of fallout horrified
everybody. Scientists explained how
radiation could cause diseases like
cancer, leukemia or eye cataracts.
Geneticists showed that radiation
could cause dangerous changes and
deformities in future human genera-
tions. Moreover, animals in bomb
test areas showed some of these genetic
effects.
The discovery of radioactivity in
milk carries the implication of harm-
ing babies. One radioactive substance,
strontium-90, replaces the calcium in
the bones of humans and animals.
All these discoveries led to the nu-
clear test ban agreement signed last
summer in Moscow. With atmospheric
nuclear tests apparently no longer a
problem, attention has shifted to
peacetime atomic operations.
The Phoenix Project at the North
Campus at the University of Michi-
gan exemplifies the valuable research
carried on with atomic energy.
But, peacetime nuclear operations
have a by-product: radioactive waste.
According to Prof. Whipple, some of
this waste is "of tremendously high
radioactivity."
The question posed is how do we
dispose of this waste and make it vir-
tually harmless to the population?
Are wastes from atomic energy
plants looming as our greatest peace-
time radiation threat? Professor Whip-
ple thinks not.
Presently, radiation in the atmos-
phere measures quite low, he asserted.
And because of more than adequate
safety precautions taken in waste dis-
posal, dangerous contamination ap-
pears quite unlikely.
Prof. Whipple listed three methods
of waste disposal, (a) regular methods
of industrial waste disposal in smoke-
stacks and sewers; (b) storing the
wastes underground, usually in stain-
less steel tanks; and (c) depositing
the wastes in the oceans.
Naturally, the disposal methods
depends on "how hot" the waste is,
Prof. Whipple explained.
"Nuclear waste ranges from the
harmless low concentrations to stuff
that's tremendously dangerous," he
said.
Most of the radioactive material
used in research laboratories creates
various wastes that when diluted can
simply be disposed through the usual
industrial waste channels, he went on.
"These wastes have such a low con-
centration that many times they mea-
sure lower than the usual radioactivi-
ty in the atmosphere," he added.
Prof. Whipple explained that our
main concern involves getting rid of
the highly radioactive, nuclear wastes.
"This is the really dangerous stuff.
It's so hot that it can boil in its own
heat," Prof. Whipple said. "Most of
this waste is disposed by storing it in
massive stainless steel underground
tanks."
Scientists pick only the most iso-
lated places for the construction of
these tanks, he continued. These mass-
ive tanks contain millions of gallons
and since the wastes continue to give
off radiation, they're built to last
hundreds of years.
"They're the most beautiful things
I've ever seen," he said with a smile.
Scientists take every precaution to
insure the safety of these tanks, he
asserted. Test wells surround them
and they can rapidly detect any radio-
activity leak. Moreover, stirrers con-
stantly operate to keep the radioactive
substances in motion.
Are these tanks perfectly safe?
"I don't think anything can be per-
fectly safe," Prof. Whipple declared.
"Who knows when we'll have an
earthquake? They just might rust
after a hundred years or so or spring
a leak.
"Naturally, a certain amount of
radioactivity will escape. It's unavoid-
able," he continued. "But for all
practical purposes, they are perfectly
safe."
What about the oceans?
At one time, scientists thought
there was great potential for waste
disposal in the oceans, he said. But
they-ve discounted many of the ocean-
ic methods.
In the oceans, they deposit the
wastes in concrete containers at the
bottom.
Prof. Whipple explained that the
most highly radioactive materials
aren't usually disposed by this meth-
od.

D. H. Wilkinson
Salesmanship has three main sub-
divisions. The third, "The Subjuga-
tion of Your Personal Adversary,"
will not be discussed here. The other
two are: "The Subjugation of the
Projectionist" and "The Subjugation
of the Audience."
It is the Slidesman's task to wrest
the apparent initiative from the pro-
jectionist and to reduce him to a ner-
vous pulp. It is important for the
Slidesman to know when he has suc-
ceeded in this objective because only
then can he turn his full attention to
his audience which is, after all, his
major task. Since the projectionist is
usually invisible it is a little tricky to
be sure when he has been pulped.
When his gibbering becomes clearly-
audible, he is in a self-sustaining con-
dition and can be safely left to take
care of himself. The unnerving effect
of his gibbering on the audience is
also useful.
I do not recommend to any but the
veriest tyros crude and vulgar tech-
niques such as the interleaving of 35
mm and regular size slides, or even
the use of the once-popular penta-
gonal slides. A satisfactory beginning
for the more aspiring is the "3-2-1"
technique. It exploits the fact that
the projectionist always loads up the
first two slides when the chairman an-
nounces the talk so that he can snap
one onto the screen as soon as the
speaker says "First . . ," and follow-
like a machine gun with the second
if need be. The Slidesman therefore
begins: "Third slide please" and is
well away. (It is elementary to note
that this should be followed by the
second slide and then by the first slide
in rapid succession).
Another useful technique, best
practised in conjunction with the first,
is the "White Dot Shift". All slides
are of course marked with a white
dot in one corner on which the pro-
jectionist places his right thumb to
ensure the correct orientation of the
slide. The present technique is to
mark your first slides in an irregular
corner thereby ensuring faulty projec-
tion. Combined with the "3-2-1" tech-
nique the "White Dot Shift" makes a
devastating beginning. This should
be immediately followed by a "Parity-
Non-Conserving Slide" which does
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


placed in the projector. There are
many ways of constructing such slides.
The simplest and at the same time
the subtlest is to letter the slide with
letters which are individually the
right way round but with the words
running from right to left.
Communications direct to the pro-
jectionists are always good and should
be made in such a manner that it is not
immediately clear whether the Slides-
man is addressing the projectionist or
the audience. Absurd complications in
the instructions must be avoided. The
Slidesman uses something like: "After
the next slide but two I shall want to
look again at the last one but four."
After the next slide: "I meant of
course that slide which was then go-
ing to be the last one but four after
I had indeed had that which was go-
ing to be the next but two, not that
which was then the last but four."
Follow this by skipping one slide.
These are elementary techniques
but should suffice for most projec-
tionists. Occasionally resistance is of-
fered in which case slightly more ad-
vanced methods are available. Three
simplest will be mentioned.
1. Unjocussable Slide. This consists
of two identical glass sheets, each
bearing the Figure, that are fixed in
precise registration with each other
by a small amount of low-melting
point wax. After a short time on the
screen the heat of the lamp melts the
wax and one sheet slips slightly rela-
tive to the other thereby throwing the
Figure out of vertical focus. The
Slidesman's sharp cry of "Focus
please" rouses the projectionist to
frantic, vain and incredulous efforts.
2. Explosive Jammer. The bottom
of a special short slide is equipped
with a thin but powerful bimetallic
strip to make up the normal size. The
Slidesman talks at length about this
Figure to permit the heat of the lamp
to buckle the bimetallic strip. The
Slidesman explains that he wants to
follow it very shortly with another
slide to show a small difference and
when he sharply cries, "Now", and
the projectionist slams the slide hold-
er across, it jams immovably half way.
The Slidesman importunes with rapid
fire, "Next slide. Next slide . . .", and
the projectionist, after trying a few
futile blows seizes each end of the
slide holder and wrestles to and fro
with it. The legs of the lantern make
a very satisfactory thumping noise on
the floor as the whole machine rocks
from side to side.
3. Groshev's Blank Pair. This ad-
vanced technique is named in honor
of a great Soviet Slidesman who in-
spired this important development.
The technique involves the use of
two successive perfectly blank slides.
These come at the end of a run of
slides that have been taken in very
rapid succession, producing an ex-
hausting and hypnotic effect upon the
projectionist. Suddenly the run comes
to an end and the projectionist, after
loading up the next slide as usual, re-
turns with thankfulness to the biting

U. OF M. NUCLEAR ENERGY
Nuclear energy sources at The
University of Michigan are delivering
more work than ever before—ranging
from irradiating human spare parts,
to food, to electronic components—
and the sources are wearing out fast-
er. Both uranium fuel rods in the
two-million-watt Ford Nuclear Re-
actor and the cobalt rods of the U. of
M. Phoenix Project's gamma irradi-
ation sources were replaced just
recently.
Shielded from radiation by 10 feet
of water in the cobalt source well at
the Phoenix Memorial Laboratory, a
nuclear engineer dropped 19 "pen-
cils" of the radioactive cobalt into its
cylindrical housing by means of re-
mote manipulators. He put 11 others
into a similar housing for installation
in the laboratory's radiation facility
on campus.
At the same time, a flat bed truck
was loaded with a 12 and one-half
ton lead cask into which the spent
uranium fuel rods from the reactor
were loaded. Intensely radioac tive, the
rods were shipped to the Atomic
Fnergv Commission's Processing Fa-
cility at Arco, Idaho. There, the re-
maining Uranium-235 in the rods and
other valuable radioisotopes will be
salvaged before the fuel nxls are
buried.
The original fuel rods were in-
stalled in the Ford Nuclear Reactor
in 1957. They lasted three years, dur-
ing the latter part of which the re-
actor operated at a power level of
one million watts. Last August the
power level was doubled, making the
Phoenix reactor one of the most pow-
erful university reactors in the coun-
try.
Now, working three shifts per day
on a five-day week, the reactor is
burning up its fuel at a rate of
approximately two grams j&gt;er day,
according to Prof. William Kerr, act-
ing director of the Phoenix Project.
"At this rate," he says, "the new fuel
will last less than a year."
The new nxls, which do not be-
come "hot", i.e. radioactive, until
they have been in use, arrived two
weeks ago and six already are in-
stalled in the reactor core. The re-
maining 19 will be installed at inter-
vals to maintain the reactor's power
level.
The cobalt 60, on the other hand,
is constantly radioactive, emitting a
beam of gamma rays. Cobalt 60 lias
a half-life of about five years, which
means that half of its intensity is
radiated away every five years.
Both the reactor and the cobalt 60
sources have particular benefits in
irradiatitig items for experiments.
The reactor is a heavy source of neu-
trons which will make irradiated ob-
jects radioactive. The cobalt 60
sources emit gamma rays which irradi-
ate but do not make objects radio-
;k tive.
"Two reasons the cobalt sources
are being replaced at this time," H.
C. Olson, Phoenix Laboratory super-
visor said, "are that the cobalt 60 had
normally decayed, and demand For
use has increased,
"The inc rease in strength means we
can undertake research programs we
couldn't do before," Olson said.
"And we can irradiate faster because
the dose rate is higher."
The strength of the source is now
about double what was available be-
fore, he said, but not simph because
fresh radioactive cobalt has been in-
stalled. The new configuration ol the
source gives a higher radiation "flux."
This means that experiments tan be
put in and removed more quickly be-
20
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


dose faster.
Demand on the services of the
Phoenix Project's two cobalt sources
has increased substantially during the
past year from both University and
outside research groups.
"More people are using gamma
rays for experiments," Olson ex-
plained. "Also, it's routine now to
provide irradiated bone and carti-
lege for hospitals.
"And, as one researcher publishes
the results of his experiments with
gamma irradiation, more and more
get ideas as to how they might also
use gamma radiation in their fields."
Much of the demand recently has
come from the department of food
sciences and department of horticul-
ture at Michigan State University.
They are experimenting with radia-
tion as a means of retarding food
spoilage, and are also trying to get
beneficial mutations in plants.
Fish pasteurization through irradi-
ation is being studied by the Bureau
of Commercial Fisheries, while Ben-
dix Systems of Ann Arbor and Bendix
Research Division of Detroit are
irradiating electronic components to
test their reliability in a space en-
vironment. Wayne State University of
Detroit is irradiating solid materials
in a study of basic properties.
Ann Arbor's St. Joseph Hospital
irradiates cartilege for grafting, as
well as animal food to make it germ-
free for feeding animal colonies.
The U. of M. Medical Center uses
the cobalt 60 source for sterilizing eye
corneas.
Radiation from the reactor consists
of streams of neutrons, which are
solid particles, as well as gamma
rays, which are electromagnetic radia-
tion, very much like intense X-rays.
The neutrons are used not only to
produce radioactive materials (cobalt
60 is made radioactive by bombarding
cobalt 59 in a reactor, for example),
but also as a probe to reveal atomic
structure and energy levels.
Although the reactor also has been
used extensively by various industrial
groups and firms, its greatest use now
is by the U. of M. department of nu-
clear engineering and physics, accord-
ing to J. B. Bullock, reactor super-
visor.
"The reactor is running over 100
hours a month now," he said, "with
four experiments going continuously.
Our usage is up about 40 per cent
over last year."
At two megawatts, the U. of M.
reactor is exceeded in power by no
other university research reactor in
the country, and, Bullock believes,
none is used more.
The entire Phoenix research facili-
ities are unique in Michigan. Besides
the reactor and cobalt 60 sources, the
Phoenix laboratories have two hot
cells for remote handling of radio-
active materials, the only ones in the
state. In addition, there are several
laboratories for physics, chemistry,
zoological and bacteriological experi-
ments, and greenhouse and an aquar-
ium.
All of this is still privately sup-
ported, as it has been since the in-
ception of the Michigan Memorial-
Phoenix Project in 1919 as a mem-
orial to U. of M. students and alumni
who died in World War II.
Productivity in the Sciences
The scientist or engineer who puts
his entire effort into research is likely
to be less productive than one who
has some exposure to administrative
or teaching duties, according to a
pair of University of Michigan inves-
tigators.
Donald C. Pelz and Frank M. An-
drews of the University's Survey
Research Center add that a diversity
of tasks—allowing people to develop
a variety of different skills—appears
to stimulate the individual's per-
formance. To a certain extent, the
more kinds of research and develop-
ment functions the scientist was en-
gaged in, the better his performance
was.
Pelz and Andrews are seeking to
define the requirements for a stimu-
lating atmosphere in research and de-
velopment organizations through a
five-year study, involving 1311 scien-
tists and engineers in 11 such organi-
zations.
The people who spent full time in
technical work were less effective than
those who spent three fourth of their
time or less in such work.
And, by most criteria, the technical
people appeared most creative when
they had several interests, less effec-
tive if they were highly specialized
people.
"For all groups, we conclude that
the man performs best w-hen he is
utilizing two or three different skills,
and when he is faced with both basic
and applied problems in his work. It
does not seem to matter whether he
thinks of his work as organized
around one project or several, so long
as there is this mix in his activity.
"There was a hint that excessive
dedication was not healthy and that
all work and no diversity was making
Jack a dull scientist."
The investigators suggest some im-
plications for the administration of
research organizations.
"One conclusion we come to is this:
Complete protection of technical staff
from administrative duties may be a
mistake. Our information suggests
that technical people actually benefit
from a mild exposure to administra-
tive tasks."
Having all technical people take
part in some review and discussion
of the organization's work and goals,
instead of just a few supervisors,
"would add zest and breadth to the
research climate," they suggest.
"Our second conclusion is that
younger scientists and engineers
should be stimulated to develop sev-
eral specialized areas. And finally, we
believe the research director should

sity of Michigan campus are Mom-
basa, Bombay and Christmas Island,
and the ships ANTON BRUUN,
ARGO and TE VEGA. These and
other island, coastal and ship stations
are part of U. of M. research being
done in a 28 million square mile lab-
oratory: the Indian Ocean. They are
linked to the University by tape-
miles of magnetic tape for the com-
puter, containing millions of bits of
meteorological information.
The research has been going on for
over two years as part of the massive
International Indian Ocean Expedi-
tion. Though done in faraway places,
the research may affect citizens of
such localities as Detroit, Petosky,
Washington, D.C. and Denver.
The basic goal is to learn more
about weather. The research will in-
evitably affect weather forecasting
and—eventually — weather modifica-
tion. "We are trying to determine as
precisely as possible the exchange of
heat and water vapor between the at-
mosphere and the Indian Ocean,
especially during the monsoon sea-
son," says Prof. Donald J. Portman
of the U. of M. Department of Mete-
orology and Oceanography of the Col-
lege of Engineering. The atmosphere
is really a kind of heat engine, which
produces our weather. "We are at-
tempting to measure the heat and
water vapor balance over the Indian
Ocean to see what is really driving
this engine."
The sun, of course, provides the
main source of energy, but details
of how it is absorbed, re-emitted or

Jack A. Houtman
M.S. (E.E.) 1960
"What will I do after graduation?" is
a question I often asked myself while
in engineering school. More explicit-
ly, I wondered: "Would I be able to
find challenging work in my area of
interest in a favorable geographic
location? What facilities or personnel
would be available to me for consul-
tation? How large a company should
I join? Educationally, how can 1 best
equip myself for the future?" While I
fully expected that my tasks would
consist mostly of thinking, not doing,
I hoped that my work would include
some laboratory or experimental re-
sponsibilities. Probably no two gradu-
ates follow the same path, but per-
haps a review of my experiences and
responsibilities before and after grad-
uation may answer some similar ques-
tions for those of you presently in
school.
My formal engineering education
began at Western Michigan Univer-
sity in a "Combined Curricula" pro-
gram between WMU and the Univer-
sity of Michigan. Completion of this
program in 1959 produced a BS de-
gree in physics and math from WMU
and a BSEE (Power Option) degree
from U. of M.
Since I eventually planned to go
into development engineering work, I
decided that the advanced mathe-
matics and field courses of the MSEE
program at Michigan would be of
benefit. While working on my masters
degree, I instructed laboratory sec-
tions in a-c and d-c machinery, basic
circuitry, and electrical maasurements.
This was really my first professional
assignment, and the experience has
since proved valuable, mostly in terms
of added general knowledge.
After receiving my MSEE degree in
1960, 1 selected the General Electric
Company as I felt this company could
best satisfy my primary requirements
in selecting a job, i.e., challenging
and interesting responsibilities in the
field of electrical machinery and
apparatus. Although my desire was to
do development or applied research
type engineering work, I wanted to
see what this work was and how it
was carried out by GE. Also I wanted
to get a taste of other type engineer-
ing jobs before taking a permanent
assignment, so I began work on the
General Electric Engineering and Sci-
ence Training Program. This pro-
gram provided a newly graduated en-
gineer a selection of several three to
six months engineering assignments
along with continued semiformal edu-
cation.
My first two assignments in Fort
Wayne, Indiana covered nine months.
One assignment, in a motor depart-
ment, was a complete study of the
derivation of polyphase motor leakage
reactance formulas. This assignment,
which was chiefly theoretical, gave
me an idea of what an Advanced De-
velopment Engineer would do in a
motor department.
The other assignment in Fort
Wayne was with the Development
Laboratory which serves several Gen-
eral Electric businesses. This experi-
ence challenged me with a variety of
problems in magnetic materials and
fields, analog computing, and instru-
mentation. Helping develop a new
type of inertia motor tester was an
especially interesting part of this
assignment. The basic principle of
this tester is that torque equals angu-
lar acceleration times polar moment
of inertia. The test motor is loaded
with a heavy inertia load connected
to a d-c tachometer with output volt-
age proportional to speed. The deriv-
ative of the output voltage is thus
proportional to the derivative of
speed, or torque. Applying the output
voltage and its derivative to the axes
of an X-Y recorder allows a plot of
the motor's speed-torque curve in a

few seconds. Although the principle
of this tester was basic, there were
many interesting associated problems
involving application of academic
courses such as differential equations,
dynamics, analog computing, etc.
Knowledge of the operating princi-
ples of this equipment was to prove
of value to me in my present position
at Holland, Michigan.
While on the Engineering and Sci-
ence Program in Fort Wayne, I en-
rolled in the General Electric "Ad-
vanced Course in Engineering." This
34 week course covered fundamental
subjects such as mechanics, dynamics,
vibrations, fluid mechanics, statistics,
electric and magnetic fields, etc. A
four hour lecture often featured a
company expert in the subject matter
for the week. Each week a complex
engineering problem requiring 15 to
25 hours outside work was solved
through the use of the principles cov-
ered in the lecture and reading ma-
terial. Solution of real engineering
problems in this manner contributed
to my intellectual maturity in a way
that cannot be done in school.
Being an ROTC graduate com-
missioned in the Army Signal Corps,
I spent a six months leave of absence
from GE in 1961 on active military
duty. Two months of signal school
included some good training in the
practical aspects of radio, telephone,
and teletype communications. I was
then assigned to a research group in
the U. S. Army Signal Research and
Development Laboratory. The group
I joined was doing basic research in
superconductivity and studying the
properties of boron at low tempera-
tures.
In the fall of 1961 I returned to an
Advance Engineering assignment on
the training program with General
Electric at the Hermetic Motor De-
partment in Holland, Michigan. This
business manufactures several million
motors a year for use in hermetically
sealed refrigeration and air condition-
ing compressors. After four months I
decided to take a permanent position
in Holland, but felt that experience
in actual design of the department's
product would be valuable before
going into advanced development
type work. Leaving the training pro-
gram, I started as a product design
engineer responsible for the electro-
magnetic design of air conditioning
size motors. The economics of her-
metic compressors justify a custom
"tailored" motor design for nearly
every compressor model. The inertia
motor tester I worked on while on the
training program has become a tool
that I use to "tailor" my designs.
While I do not operate this tester, I
find the knowledge of its principles
helpful in effectively directing others
in its use (see photo). A complete
mathematical model of the motor on
a digital computer is used for motor
performance calculations and de-
sign synthesis. Engineering assistants,
trained in motor design, perform
much of the routine design work,
leaving more of my time available for
difficult designs and other projects.
I also direct, counsel, and advise other
engineering personnel (see photo)
such as engineering assistants and
draftsmen in their activities of calcu-
lating test data, drawing perform-
ance curves, and issuing engineering
drawings.
Having now had several years
product design experience, I recently
accepted a different position as de-

signer of refrigerator and freezer
motors; however, the major portion
of my time is to be spent on an ad-
vance engineering project of studying
the effects of space winding harmonics
on motor performance. Eventually, f
plan to work full time on advance
engineering projects of this nature.
At first I was a little reluctant to
join a large company like GE for fear
of becoming "lost." However, the
company is divided into smaller oper-
ating departments—each operated like
a separate business, including the
engineering of its own product. Thus,
I can see the direct results of my
efforts in production. My working
conditions are ideal. Evaluation of
my performance is based on accomp-
lishment, not hours worked or seni-
ority. My time is my own and f must
use it judiciously. Experienced en-
gineers in the department are avail-
able for consultation, as well as per-
sonnel in several company-wide re-
search facilities. My family and I
enjoy our life in Holland, and have
become active in several church and
community activities. These experi-
ences away from General Electric and
engineering have given me important
leadership training, established many
friendships, and allowed me to per-
form a service to my community.
Engineering with General Electric
has been all I had expected it to be.
My work is challenging, interesting,
and consists of a pleasant variety of
responsibilities. My time is mostly
spent thinking and organizing, but
occasionally f participate in experi-
mental work. The facilities and bene-
fits associated with this large company
have proven very advantageous to me.
My engineering education seems to
have equipped me well to begin my
responsibilities, but one fact f now
realize is that an engineer cannot
expect to train for one particular job.
There are just too many different
kinds of work. However, with a good
foundation in engineering funda-
mentals and mathematics, with a will-
ingness for continued study, and with
the proper work atmosphere, there
will be few problems that cannot be
reduced to fundamentals and event-
ually solved.
SLIDESMANSHIP

of his nails. However, the slide that
he projected in response to the last
urgent, "New slide please", was in fact
the first of the two perfectly blank
ones and the second blank slide is
now of course also safely loaded up in
the slide holder. After several seconds
comes the Slidesman's icy, "I said
'Next slide please' ", and the projec-
tionist sees to his horror that, al-
though he put a slide in and shoved it
across, nothing has come onto the
screen. He knows he put in a slide;
he must then, by some aberration,
have taken out the last but one pro-
jected slide without replacing it, pro-
jected the unfilled holder and re-
placed instead the last projected slide
with the one that should now be
showing but in fact is waiting to be
shoved across. With a muffled cry and
on a third repetition of "I am still
waiting for the next slide" the pro-
jectionist slams over the slide holder.
The fourth repetition of "I am still
waiting . . ." coincides with the pro-
jectionist's first bubbling moan. Al-
though his vison is now clouding he
knows how to reassure himself of his
sanity. Back again he slams the slide
holder and, his world at stake, thrusts
his finger straight at the middle of
the second blank slide to verify its
tangible existence. Now there is a
large hole in the center of the second
blank slide. The slide is little more
than a rim. The moan swells to full
gibber. With the last vestige of his
reason, the projectionist seizes the
next slide in the box and tries to ram
it into the holder already occupied
by the second blank slide.
So much for the projectionist. The
problem of the audience is more im-
portant and a far subtler matter. The
Slidesman's objective is, of course, to
convey, effortlessly, to the members of
the audience, his transcendence and
superiority over them. Here we enter
the field of Gonferencemanship, the
guiding principle of which is to con-
ceal from the audience what you are
talking about. The Conferenceman as
Slidesman must equally conceal what
the slides are about. It should, how-
ever, be all but clear that whatever
the slides are about it is not what the
talk is about, whatever that is. The
general malaise that this engenders
is helped by remarks such as: "This

rise to about 250,000. One reason for
this tremendous increase is that it is
relatively easy for a German student
to get into a university. The "Abitur"
has lost much of its deterring tough-
ness, although an effort is being made
to restore it in order to curtail uni-
versity attendance. Unlike the Ameri-
can university with its exorbitant tui-
tion fees, the German university is
practically free by this country's stan-
dards. To give you another personal
example, during the last semester I
studied at home and it cost my par-
ents the equivalent of about $60, and
that included books! Their expenses
would have soared to $80 a month,
had I chosen to study away from
home in another German city. This
is still much less, however, than what
the average American student has to
spend on his college education.
Advantages and Disadvantages
When I make an attempt now to
analyze the advantages or disadvan-
tages of one system over the other
I am confronted with the difficulty of
having to consider numerous items
from various perspectives. There is a
great variety of differences. First of
all, there is the difference in the qual-
ity and quantity of facilities which I
already mentioned. Then there is the
staff of professors. Germany has long
been famous for great university
scholars. Much of this almost monop-
olistic glory has gone. Two wars and
the current tragic division of the
country have contributed a great
deal to this. Another major reason, f
believe, is Germany's retreat from
autocratic isolationism. Maybe be-
cause she was forced into this devel-
opment by the loss of the war and the
necessity to look for protection within
a family of nations, she has opened up
to all kinds of foreign influences. Ger-
many today faces the same problem
that England has been facing for
quite a while: the possibilities for the
great minds to develop their ideas or
projects still further are often limited
because of a lack of funds and facili-
ties. So they turn abroad where these
opportunities do exist to a generous
extent, and their destination, more
often than not, is America. I may be
guilty of drawing an oversimplified
picture, but there can be no doubt
that many a would-be eminent schol-
ar fails to gain recognition, merely
because he is prevented by the exist-
ing circumstances from reaching a
position from which he can make his
eminence known. In concrete terms,
this means that German universities
cannot provide the rapidly growing
student body with enough professors
to maintain, or rather to regain, a
ratio between students and teachers
that makes possible the kind of inter-
communication and mutual enrich-
ment 1 have been able to experience
here at the University of Michigan.
The picture I have drawn so far
of the German university must look
rather gloomy to the reader, and he
may ask himself why anyone would
want to study in Germany. Well, the
reasons are manifold, and they should
become obvious when I touch with
special delight upon the weak points
of the American educational system.
During the five months I have been
here in this country I have become
convinced that this country's leading
educators, while frantically searching
for new educational horizons since the
first Sputnik, have failed to review
the student himself. He represents the
weakest point in the system and com-
pares unfavorably with the average
German student. Where lies the sick-
ness and the difference?
American Inefficiency
Ever since I came here I have been
amazed at the amount of work the
average American student puts into
his studies. He often works seven days
a week, studies late into the night and
open libraries are willing to absorb
him in a late hour. In Germany all
libraries close at seven p.m., and
would not dream of opening on Sun-
day. The students make every effort
to avoid the necessity of studying at
a late hour and tend to regard the
weekends as sacred workless periods
in which to relax and have fun. Most
of them manage to keep it that way;
very few do over here. Is the Ameri-
can university tougher and more de-
manding then? I do not believe so. I
think that the American student
works longer, but in the final re-
sult he does not seem to accomplish
more than the German student. In
other words he is less efficient. The
reason for this seems quite obvious
to me. The American student is too
much entangled in his environment,
which keeps imposing all kinds of
social obligations on him. As a result
he has to do many things at the same
time and finds himself doing none
really thoroughly. Frustration sets in
to quite an extent.
Living in a typical campus frater-
nity for 3 months I was able to watch
this phenomenon from a very close
position. The house was noisy all day
long and often until late at night.
This state of affairs was accepted, al-
though some of the brothers obvious-
ly felt uneasy about it. Any fellow
who would complain of the lack of
concentration and sleep would be
branded as a complete square, and
who would like to wear that stigma?
Thus it is regarded as natural to
go to the library for an earnest effort
to study. But what is happening
there? The fellow who thinks he can
really study in that beehive is deceiv-
ing himself; for while he is studying
he has to be concerned with study,
coffee and dates. The library is just
as important as a social meeting place
as it is for studying. The American
student's lack of efficiency is therefore,
I believe, a direct result of his lack
of concentration, which in turn is
a result of his preoccupation with
building up his social ego. The sorori-
ties, fraternities, and donnitories
seem to set most of these corrupt-
ing standards. One of this country's
leading educators apparently concurs.
Dr. James B. Gonant, who is cur-
rently on an official assignment in
Europe to study educational institu-
tions, is said to be in favor of gradu-
ally eliminating the fraternity, sorori-
ty and dormitory system. I personally
find it incomprehensible that all
younger students should be confined
to these dorms whether they are suited
emotionally and intellectually or not.
In Germany, too, there are frater-
nities; but students do not live in
them, and merely use them for social
gatherings. Even so, these fraternities
are regarded as hopelessly out-dated
by most of the students. There are no
dormitories, and students rent rooms
in private places when they are away
from home. Thus they usually find
peace and quiet needed for effective
studies. Outside the university (and
to some extent even inside) they are
completely on their own. This in-
dividualism, I think, is reflected in
their personalities and in their gen-
eral outlook on life.

"you can't take it with you"
was born a long time before Garrett
started making life support systems.
&lt;£\ s a matter
of fact,
unless man does take his earthly
environment with him into space,
he hasn't got a chance.
For here is a world that has no
oxygen, no pressure, no gravity.
To live and work for weeks and
months in orbital flight —a need
dictated by urgent space
projects now in progress —
man must have the most
sophisticated life support
system ever built.
It has to provide him
with oxygen, water,
pressurization — complete
climate control.
It has to guard him
against temperatures that
range from near absolute
zero to the re-entry heat of
thousands of degrees.
It has to be a miracle package.
The question becomes: Who is
now building such an environ-
mental system?
The answer is, of course, Garrett
As long ago as 1941, Garrett
management saw that man could
go no higher, no faster, without
pressurization of aircraft. When
Garrett's AiResearch division
delivered the first systems,
suddenly the ceiling was
off the world.
Today over 90% of the
free world's aircraft carry
Garrett environmental
systems. Millions of hours
of operation have been
accumulated by heat trans-
fer equipment, turbomachinery,
controls.
This experience led Garrett to
build the life support systems
that protected our astronauts on
the recent Mercury flights.
The same know-how is now at
work supplying "shirtsleeve" envi-
ronments for Gemini and Apollo.
These systems will keep man alive
for weeks in space. Now
longer flights
are being
planned —
manned
orbiting
laboratories and space stations.
Garrett already knows how to solve
life support problems for months
in space. Much of the system work
is completed and components built.
What are the reasons for this
unique capability?
The most experienced men
are Garrett men. The most
advanced facilities are
Garrett. The only applied
system for outer space is
Garrett built.

environmental, the solu-
tion comes from Garrett

(Continued from page 17)
There's too much danger in trans-
porting the really hot wastes to ports
and ships," he said. "These wastes
just can't be stored in transportable
containers."
The main fault in ocean disposal
involves the rapid spread of radioac-
tivity, he pointed out.
"We still can't properly guage the
underwater pressure," he explained.
"Lots of times, huge concrete contain-
ers larger than oil drums have been
brought to the surface from great
depths completely flattened by the
terrific pressure."
The ocean still holds great promise,
he added. Scientists continually come
up with new ideas and only constant
experimentation will discover the
most suitable method.
One danger in ocean disposal in-
volves the food chain, the idea of big
fish living on smaller fish which in
turn live on tiny plants and animals.
Since many humans in the world live
on fish, Prof. Whipple explained, the
danger becomes obvious.
An example of this has already hap-
pened in the Irish Sea, he pointed
out. The English pipe small concen-
trations of waste into the Irish Sea.
But, people on the coast use sea weed
to make a form of bread, and if the
wastes get into the sea weed there's
a definite danger of contamination.
"Scientists are carefully watching
this situation to see if the seaweed
becomes radioactive," he said.
"Another thing disturbs me," Prof.
Whipple added. "It's the idea of radi-
ation upsetting the balance of na-
ture."
When we have a fish acquarium,
there's perfect balance between the
fish and the plants, he explained.
But if we add a snail, it can upset the
whole acquarium and kill the fish
because it destroys the balance.
What if the present atmospheric
radiation causes no harm to human
or other large animals, but does kill
off a species of spiders, for example,
he explained. It might throw the
whole system out of kilter.
He explained that scientists see no
danger here yet but like everything
else, they're watching the situation
carefully.
Still another problem of peace-
time radioactive waste disposal in-
volves regulation. Who has the re-
sponsibility of controlling these wastes
and insuring the purity of the atmos-
phere from this potentially harmful
pollution?
Those who clamor for increased
state control over peacetime atomic
activities have been brainwashed by
the myth surrounding the danger of
radioactive contamination, a Univer-
sity of Michigan law professor main-
tains.
Prof. William Pierce, director of
the University of Michigan Legisla-
tive Research Center, believes that
state regulation of peacetime nuclear
activities is both unnecessary and un-
economical.
"Why should the states take on the
added responsibility," Prof. Pierce de-
clared. "Atomic power is still in its
infancy and a lot more work has to
be done before nuclear power will
approach living up to expectations."
The Atomic Energy Act of 1946
established the Atomic Energy Com-
mission (AEC) and gave this federal
body power to regulate all atomic
activities in the United States. The
AEC has responsibility for licensing
all major nuclear operations.
With the huge expansion of peace-
time use of radioactive materials,
many people believed that state-wide
regulation would provide a more
efficient means of regulation and take
a large load off the AEC. Congress re-
sponded in 1956 with legislation
allowing states to set up their own
commissions if they wished. If the
states didn't want their own agencies,
the federal government would con-
tinue to regulate.
In addition, the AEC relaxed its
stringent licensing rules to allow
small operations like medical research
to proceed without federal licenses.
The wastes involved in these small
operations provide almost negligible
contamination risks.
Few states responded to the 1956
law. Only New York, Kentucky and
most recently California have formed
their own commissions and only New
York has an extensive program.
"I'm sure many more states woidd
like to have their own commissions,"
Prof. Pierce said. "I'm sure Gov.
(George) Romney would like to have
state control since it boils down to
the old story of state control versus
national control.
"It's a matter of surrendering pow-
er to the national government when
the state could have it itself," he
added.
But there's no need for state regu-
lation, Prof. Pierce believes. It's im-
practical for several reasons: (a) it's
expensive to set up the body; (b)
there's the problem of finding and
sealing off places for waste disposal;
(c) there's not that many reactors be-
ing built; and (d) the AEC has the
money and resources to do the best
job so why not leave the problem up
to the federal government.
Michigan already has enough fiscal
trouble, Prof. Pierce pointed out. It
would cost a quarter of a million dol-
lars to establish a state commission
besides the expense of providing for
waste disposal.
"But the main thing that we don't
realize is that the expectation that
we're going to have more atomic en-
ergy plants is false," he explained.
"Don't look for the construction of
new reactors, but for more research."
Scientists have made their greatest
progress in the field of nuclear re-
search, Prof. Pierce continued. Why
should we spend huge sums of money
to build nuclear reactors when
through atomic research we're finding
more efficient ways to use our stand-
ard fuels?
"We've got more energy out of coal
and petroleum than we ever believed
possible," he added. "And coal is
quite a bit cheaper than uranium."
Atomic plants aren't living up to
expectations, he continued. The
Fermi Reactor near Monroe (Mich.)
is way behind schedule and still hasn't
reached capacity.
"All those predictions that one
hailf of our power will be atomic by
1975 and so on are clearly false," Prof.
Pierce declared. "What atomic energy
has done is cause an explosion in sci-
entific knowledge through research.
"Some day we'll depend on nuclear
energy," he asserted. "But it's a long
way in the future.

same point is made diagrammatically
in the next slide."
The only exception to this rule is
when the Slidesman is using the Time
Lapse technique which is very dis-
turbing. In this the Slidesman says
very clearly something extremely sim-
ple and lucid as he shows a very sim-
ple slide. He then says he wishes to
point out the very sharp distinction be-
tween that situation and the following
one. The next slide is precisely the
same as its predecessor and the Slides-
man says precisely the same thing as
before. This may be repeated several
times in secession. It is helped if the
Slidesman addresses his remarks speci-
fically towards the most distinguished
of those persons in the front row who
have just woken up. The distin-
guished elder will nod in more and
more vigorous assent as each fresh
distinction is drawn. It may be his
last conference.
The Slidesman-audience relation-
ship is fostered by the Interpolated
Slide. This slide is from a field utterly
alien to that of the conference and
illustrates, say, tablets inscribed in
Linear B or, perhaps, a manuscript
page of an unpublished arrangement
by Busoni for one piano, three hands,
of a motet by Gesualdo. The Slides-
man says, "I'm terribly sorry. It must
have crept in somehow", and then
after a tiny pause, "Another of my
little foibles you know." The impli-
cation that, firstly, this remote subject
is but one of an unspecified number
of the Slidesman's little foibles (on
which he evidently speaks at confer-
ences) and that, secondly, he regards
nuclear physics also as a little foible,
are both satisfactory. (The showing of
an interpolated slide of a latter-day
Venus de Milo in traditional attire,
although effective is not recom-
mended for general audiences).
An arresting technique is the Fur-
ther Work slide. This shows a num-
ber of points labelled "Experiment"
all lying well below the horizontal
line labelled "Theory". The Slides-
man (who is, of course, responsible
for both the theory and the experi-
ment refers to the points as "Very
recent work in my laboratory," (Al-
ways, always, my laboratory) and says
that although the present fit between
theory and experiment is not of the
best, further work is going on in his
laboratory at that very moment and
that he feels confident that when the
new results come along the fit be-
tween experiment and theory will be
greatly improved. As he says this the
experimental points, which are really
little weights fixed on with more low-
melting point wax, respond to gravity
as the wax softens in the heat of the
projector and move across the screen
to rest finally on the theoretical line
which is really a strip sticking out of
the surface to form a ledge. Note that,
from the slide's point of view, up is
down, so the points move upwards
across the screen. In a more powerful
variant of this technique, suitable only
for the most sophisticated audiences,
the little weights are powerfully mag-
netized and placed below (i.e., above)
the theoretical line which is made of
iron so that they appear to move
down (up) to the line against gravity
instead of up (down).
A useful piece of Slidesmanship is
to have a run of slides all of which
project on dieir sides with abscissae
running vertically. This causes
cricked necks in the audience, itself
very useful, and enables the Slides-
man to say: "I'm sorry about these
slides—they were made up for the
Peiping Conference."
At one time Russianmanship was
an important part of Conferenceman-
ship, but now that everybody of any
consequences has been to two Rus-
sian conferences this must be largely
dropped. Slides actually lettered in
Cyrillic characters, however, are still
most valuable.
If the Slidesman presents a long
run of slides, all so lettered, but with-
out translating the captions he im-
plies both that he is so frequent a
visitor to Soviet parts that it is worth-
while getting his slides specially made
up and also that he is so familiar
with the language that it never enters
his head that it needs translating.
Eventually someone in the audience
must tire of this meaningless proces-
sion and say: "Look here, aren't you
going to tell us what those slides are
about? We can't all read Russian you
know." After a well judged pause the
Slidesman replies: "Not Russian, my
dear fellow, Bulgarian."

The Department of Engineering Mechanics was created
53 years ago to train engineers in depth in the various aspects
of classical and modern mechanics. The field of mechanics is
roughly divided into the three divisions: deformable solids,
fluids, and rigid body dynamics. The student is trained in
the foundations and assumptions in each branch of mechanics,
and is also made aware of the possibilities and imitations of
mathematical models. Laboratory work as well as mathematics
are vital parts of both the undergraduate and graduate pro-
grams.
Since the program stresses heavily the fundamentals of
engineering, the graduate finds that his background is not
markedly affected by the rapid obsolescence which seems to
accompany modern technology. He finds that he can success-
fully work in any of a vast number of industries, research
organizations and universities. Graduates of this department
have made substantial contributions in such diverse areas as
rarefied gas dynamics, structural vibrations, missile guidance
systems, nuclear reactor technology, shell theory, and the
paper-making industries, to name only a few. While training
for research and development activities represents the major
goal of the program, many of the graduates have found that
their backgrounds in mechanics were highly useful in admin-
istrative positions as well.
The accompanying photographs illustrate some recent
research carried out by the staff of the Department. Included
is study in rotating and stratified fluids, stability of structures,
plates and shells, plastic behavior of materials, the behavior
of non-Newtonian fluids, ship vibrations and wheel and
vehicle dynamics.

how this heat, or energy, is passed
back and forth between the atmos-
phere and the ocean.
From six land stations ringing the
ocean and six ships and eight islands
dotting it, the U. of M. researchers
get measurements of the heat arriving
from the sun, the heat radiated by
the atmosphere, the amount of evap-
oration and the "sensible" heat trans-
fer. The stations collect the data on
paper charts and magnetic tape. Local
observers and technicians gather this
material periodically to send it to
Ann Arbor. Added to this are cloud
data from Tiros 8, the weather satel-
lite, which is transmitted to the Bom-
bay station.
These vast amounts of data (each
ship station takes 24 readings every
6 minutes) are fed into a unique
analog-digital computer combination
in Ann Arbor. The computer has
been programmed with a mathe-
matical model to represent evapora-
tion and heat transfer. The data are
to refine the model, make it closer to
reality. Hopefully a better picture—
and better understanding and fore-
casting—will result.
The work will continue until
January 1966, and analysis long after
that. To support the first half of this
year's effort, the National Science
Foundation has just granted $22,125
additional funds to the U. of M.
effort, bringing the total to date to
$340,000.
The relationship between Michigan
and the Indian Ocean goes both ways.
The U. of M. meteorologists have
operated a research tower in Lake
Michigan near Muskegon for two
years now, recording data similar to
their Indian Ocean acquisitions Some
of the findings from Lake Michigan
last summer have been used to help
analyze the Indian Ocean informa-
tion. If results eventually correlate
closely, the Indian Ocean Expedition
should help Lake Michigan—and
world-wide—weather forecasts.

We give Ch. E.s modern tools
and a chance to stick out their necks
Some of our chemical engineers work on fabrics for ladies'
coats, some on lunar orbiters, some on raising the hatch-
ability percentage of turkey eggs. The assortment runs on
and on too long for easy credibility. The assortment of
engineering disciplines that we use besides chemical also
gets too long.
We do not deny, however, that sensitized film and paper
remain our largest single business. Instead of waning they
are waxing. High-order chemical engineering is our secret.
This is a nice secret to know. We want to teach it to
upcoming chemical engineers endowed with enough mental
flexibility to recognize that mathematical model-building
which correlates dollars with millionths of an inch of accu-
racy in superimposing color emulsion layers can be as
exciting a practice of their profession as calculating the
diameter of pipe with which to feed a still.
In addition to the upcomingness, the flexibility, and the
professionalism, one further characteristic can elevate the
possessor above a merely good, satisfactory career: a feeling
that "the company" really means "me" rather than some
vague "them," a feeling which on fortunately rare occa-
sions becomes so strong that he is willing to wage a stiff
battle for a good idea.

Advancement in a Big Company:
How it Works
An Interview with General Electric's C. K. Rieger, Vice President and Group Executive, Electric Utility Group
C. K. Rieger
■ Charles K. Rieger joined General Elec-
tric's Technical Marketing Program after
earning a BSEE at the University of Mis-
souri in 1936. Following sales engineering
assignments in motor, defense and home
laundry operations, he became manager of
the Heating Device and Fan Division in
1947. Other Consumer-industry management
positions followed. In 1953 he was elected
a vice president, one of the youngest men
ever named a Company officer. Mr. Rieger
became Vice President, Marketing Services
in 1959 and was appointed to his present
position in 1961. He is responsible for all
the operations of some six divisions com-
posed of 23 product operations oriented
primarily toward the Electric Utility market.
Q. How can I be sure of getting the
recognition I feel I'm capable of earn-
ing in a big company like G.E.?
A. We learned long ago we couldn't
afford to let capable people get lost.
That was one of the reasons why G.E.
was decentralized into more than a
hundred autonomous operating de-
partments. These operations develop,
engineer, manufacture and market
products much as if they were inde-
pendent companies. Since each de-
partment is responsible for its own
success, each man's share of author-
ity and responsibility is pinpointed.
Believe me, outstanding performance
is recognized, and rewarded.
Q. Can you tell me what the "promo-
tional ladder" is at General Electric?
A. We regard each man individually.
Whether you join us on a training
program or are placed in a specific
position opening, you'll first have to
prove your ability to handle a job.
Once you've done that, you'll be given
more responsibility, more difficult
projects—work that's important to
the success of your organization and
your personal development. Your abil-
ity will create a "promotional ladder"
of your own.
Q. Will my development be confined
to whatever department I start in?
A. Not at all! Here's where "big com-
pany" scope works to broaden your
career outlook. Industry, and General
Electric particularly, is constantly
changing — adapting to market the
fruits of research, reorganizing to
maintain proper alignment with our
customers, creating new operations
to handle large projects. All this rep-
resents opportunity beyond the limits
of any single department.
Q. Yes, but just how often do these
opportunities arise?
A. To give you some idea, 25 percent
of G-E's gross sales last year came
from products that were unknown
only five or ten years ago. These new
products range from electric tooth
brushes and silicone rubber com-
pounds to atomic reactors and inter-
planetary space probes. This chang-
ing Company needs men with ambi-
tion and energy and talent who aren't
afraid of a big job—who welcome the
challenge of helping to start new
businesses like these. Demonstrate
your ability—whether to handle com-
plex technical problems or to manage
people, and you won't have long to
wait for opportunities to fit your
needs.
Q. How does General Electric help
me prepare myself for advancement
opportunity?
A. Programs in Engineering, Manu-
facturing or Technical Marketing give
you valuable on-the-job training. We
have Company-conducted courses to
improve your professional ability no
matter where you begin. Under Tui-
tion Refund or Advanced Degree Pro-
grams you can continue your formal
education. Throughout your career
with General Electric you'll receive
frequent appraisals to help your self-
development. Your advancement will
be largely up to you.

The little coil is made with a most remark-
able wire. Cooled to 452°F below zero, it
becomes a super-conducting magnet.
In labs all over the country, scientists are
using the Westinghouse super-magnet to
explore ideas like generating electric power
directly from a stream of hot gases; build-
ing new kinds of atom smashers; develop-
ing power systems for long-distance space
travel and communications.
The Westinghouse super conducting

The man who created the sculpture shown above
started his career as a tool and die-maker. The
disciplines he learned in that exacting profession,
coupled with his creative imagination, give his
work the technical perfection and design vigor
that have made him one of the world's most
sought-after architectural sculptors.
Imagination and scientific discipline, when
simultaneously applied, can yield spectacular
results. In art. In science. In careers.
At Celanese, you will be encouraged to inquire,
to challenge, to innovate—within the framework
lpting a career
of the disciplines of polymer and organic chemis-
try. This coupling of freedom and discipline pro-
vides, we believe, the sound basis for your growth
and ours.
If you are trained in chemical, electrical or

Garrett-AiResearch? You'll have to
work harder and use more of
your knowledge than engineers
at most other companies.
If you're our kind of engineer,
you have some very definite ideas
about your career.
For example:
You've worked hard to get a
good education. Now you want to
put it to work in the best way
possible.
You will never be satisfied with
run-of-the-mill assignments. You
demand exciting,
challenging projects.
You not only accept
individual responsibil-
ity — you insist upon it.
Does that sound like
you? Then AiResearch
is your cup of tea.
Our business is
mainly in sophisticated aerospace
systems and subsystems.
Here, research, design, and de-
velopment lead to production of
actual hardware.
That means you
have the oppor-
tunity to start with
a customer's problem
and see it through to a
system that will get the job done.
The product lines at AiResearch,
Los Angeles Division, are environ-
mental systems, flight information
and controls sys-
tems, heat transfer
systems, secondary
power generator
systems for missiles
and space, electri-
cal systems, and
specialized indus-
trial systems.
In each category AiResearch
employs three kinds of engineers.
Preliminary design engineers do
the analytical and theoretical
work, then write proposals.
Design engineers do the lay-
outs; turn an idea into a product.
Developmental engineers are
responsible for making hardware
out of concepts.
Whichever field fits you best, we
can guarantee you this: you can
go as far and fast as your talents
can carry you. You can make as
much money as any engineer in a
comparable spot — anywhere. And
of course, at AiResearch, you'll
get all the plus benefits a top com-
pany offers.
Our engineering staff is smaller
than comparable companies. This
spells opportunity. It gives a man
who wants to make a mark plenty
of elbow room to expand. And
while he's doing it he's working
with, and learning from, some of
the real pros in the field.

Probably one of the more humorous analyses of human
motivation is the A+ answer to one philosophy professor's
final examination. The question: "Why?" The answer: "Why
not?" Desirable as it may be as an incentive for positive action,
this analysis is too simple and clear-cut.
Sociologists and psychologists broadly list satisfaction of
personal desire to accumulate wealth, professional or social
status, power and knowledge as a few motivating factors. The
relative importance of each depends on the activity in which
one is engaged. One individual who considers money the most
important derivative of his daily work may be a volunteer
scouter in the evening with completely different incentives.
Universities provide a mechanism through which these
motivating factors may work. Men attend college to lay a
foundation on which to build a professional career which
in turn helps them attain this wealth, knowledge and status.
(Women attend with the more short range goal of marriage
and will, therefore, not be considered further.) The composi-
tion of this foundation may be highly academic, highly extra-
curricular or, hopefully, a combination of the two. The indi-
vidual paths for formulating this base carry with them more
specific short term incentives.
Students, however, are not the only ones for whom a
university is a useful instrument. Faculty members, too, find
a convenient road to attainment of their individual goals. But
here one finds an alarming1 situation which is acknowledged
by some instructors and students. That is teaching, particu-
larly undergraduate, is becoming secondary in importance.
Under the guise of an educator, one finds a research scientist,
an author or a consultant. Teaching seems to be becoming a
necessary evil which is required to gain access to office and
laboratory space.
Perhaps this change, this shift of emphasis from direct
instruction, is a result of increased competition for a limited
supply of faculty. In cases where money for higher salaries
is not available, personnel recruitment using fringe benefits

effective. Perhaps this change is an inherent problem with a
university which is large both in its absolute number and in
the percentage of graduate students comprising that number.
In addition the external popular conception that a university
is good because its faculty carries on x dollars of research
a year or Dr. whatshisface is on the staff creates pressures
to provide these in order to bolster or maintain that univer-
sity's image.
Perhaps a large graduate school or x research dollars a year
are necessary to some extent. But a continuous spiral of inward
activity with direct communication of knowledge to students
becoming less important can reap nothing but a poor har-
vest. Increased work loads and greater individual study should
not be accepted rationale for a basic faculty introversion, a
basic lack of concern for the student. The introductions of
new members at a meeting of our engineering college faculty
provide good examples of this lack of interest. Not one intro-
duction included any mention of contact with students on a
formal or informel basis. That is, not one indicated that the
new member anticipated actively supporting student organiza-
tions or even teaching classes. Most just listed research projects.
Even for selfish personal reasons, those who tend to con-
centrate their efforts on one project should heed the findings
of two university researchers, Donald C. Pelz and Frank M.
Andrews. They have found that people who spent only part
of their time on a project are more effective than those who
spend all of their time on it. They concluded: "There was a
hint that excessive dedication was not healthy and that all
work and no diversity was making Jack a dull scientist."
Why should this beneficial diversity not include a greater
overt interest in the student and in the art of teaching? If
research, rather than education, is the principal goal here,
let us establish a "Michisearch" research center similar to
Lincoln Laboratories or JPL and take our university else-
where. Or better yet, vice versa.

You'd expect that the leading maker of arc carbons that pro-

and even the astronauts themselves.
And it probably wouldn't surprise you to learn that a com-

would also create an anti-static agent as part of the vinyl
plastic it developed for phonograph records. This keeps dust
from sticking to record surfaces. The sound is improved. The
record lasts longer. And Becky Hull's ballet lessons are per-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


How would you go about determining
the probability that Russia will launch
a nuclear attack on the United States
tomorrow? The classical approach to sta-
tistics would surely be of little help. In
this thought provoking and informative
article, author Marc Barnes presents an
insight into a major new realm of sta-
tistics—the statistics of opinion and in-
complete data, based on Bayes' Theorem.
This "new statistics" is likely to influence
much high-level decision making in our
Country's future. For this reason, it de-
serves the attention of all readers.
Between the absolute dichotomy of
the "right" and "wrong" choice, lie
an infinite spectrum of relatives. It
is within this vast realm, bounded
only by preconception and prejudice,
that decisions must be made. If de-
cisions were well-defined and the
proper selection obvious to a man
making a choice, there would be little
scientific basis for attempting to ana-
lyze decisions. It would remain for
psychology and philosophy to deter-
mine why men fail to select the clear-
ly superior of two courses of action.
Since in reality such decisive clarity
is rare, some far more definitive means
must be sought if the complexity of
most decisions is to be conquered.
The roles of statistical analysis and
probability in decision-making have
become increasingly influential since
the Industrial Revolution and trends
toward Big Business and Government
began. Theories of probability, how-
ever, have been circulating in mathe-
matics for centuries. The applications
of observed relative frequency in con-
junction with other experimental
data has long been the backbone of
classical statistics. Classical statistics
attempts to minimize the effect of
human judgment on the outcome of
its predictions. Although it is neces-
sary to make certain relative value
judgments on the possible outcomes
of a decision, once these have been
made, classical statistics immediately
disregards any further use they might
have. Recently, however, a group
spearheaded by Dr. Leonard J. Sav-
age of the Mathematics Department
and the newly created Engineering
Psychology Laboratory have termed
themselves "Bayesians." Through the
use of Bayes' theorem, and an in-
creased emphasis on personal opinion
as valid data, they have achieved a re-
freshing approach to statistics.
Thomas Bayes was an Eighteenth-
Century English cleric associated with
the Unitarian Church. His major con-
tribution to mathematics was a form-
ula which dealt with "prior" and
"posterior" probabilities. Actually, a
Frenchman named Laplace was large-
ly responsible for propounding the
theorem and was credited with its in-
ception until later he admitted Bayes'
influence. As Lancelot Hogben notes
in his Statistical Theory. "Were it not
for the fact that Laplace later ac-
knowledged it as the spiritual parent
of his own mystique, few of us would
have heard of it. As matters stand,
most subsequent writers on statistical
theory up to and including the pres-
ent time recognize the Essay towards
solving a Problem in the Doctrine of
Chance as a landmark, and its con-
tents as a challenge or a programme,
according to taste."
Utilizing Bayes' theorem, from
some initial knowledge of an event's
occurance, increasingly accurate (or
more probable) results can be ob-
tained. If the prior probability of
some hypothesis H, say, is denoted
by P (H), and some further datum
D is obtained whose probability is
P (D), the posterior probability, or
probability that hypothesis H is cor-
rect in view of the new datum D is
written
where the symbol P (D/H) denotes
the chance that assuming H were true,
D would occur. Bayes' theorem, al-
though highly evident in Bayesian
calculations, is hardly the issue divid-
ing the two schools of statistics.
Because probability is a science
founded on such indefinite terms as
"degree of certainty" and "reasonable
doubt," the mainstream of statistics
has always attempted to maintain as
reliable a source of data and as rigid
a procedure as possible. Traditionally,
the course the experiment will follow,
as well as the frequency which should
guarantee a reasonably valid conclu-
sion are predetermined and given
strict adherence. In contrast, the
Bayesian may have some idea of the
outcome before the experiment is be-
gun. He then may obtain only suffi-
cient data to confirm his prior opin-
ion. For example, compare the meth-
ods of the two opposing schools in a
problem of such classic stature as the
toss of a coin. The traditional statis-
tician, assuming the coin to be largely
unbiased, would expect a toss of

The first group of human operators, the interpreters, serve as a filter for obviously irrelevant information coming from the
data sources. The second group of human operators, the "probability estimators", are the real heart of the system. They
supply the Bayesian processor (probably a large digital computer) with estimates of P(D/H).
heads roughly 500,000 times in a
million. On the other hand, the
Bayesian would closely inspect the
coin, and if it seemed slightly de-
fected, predict a toss of heads per-
haps 55% of the time. Working from
this previous opinion, he might make
a few experimental tosses, and if these
seemed to support his theory, call off
any further experimentation which,
in the light of the evidence, he would
deem unnecessary. Thus, while the
classicist stresses objectivity and thor-
oughness, the Bayesian dismisses for-
mality in favor of common sense and
casualness. This issue, and its im-
plications upon an attitude toward
the whole of statistics, constitutes the
greater part of the chasm dividing the
old and new schools of statistics.
With the Bayesian's broader out-
look on statistics, the limits of proba-
bility's applications are infinitely ex-
panded. For when expert opinion is
accepted as valid data, until recently
considered an absurdity, the range of
situations that can be handled by
statistics is bounded only by the de-
gree of expertness the opinion has
connected with it. As an example,
suppose both a Bayesian and a class-
ical statistician were faced with the
problem of determining the most effi-
cient shape for the bow of a ship.
The classicist would be likely to test
a prototype of every possible shape a
predetermined number of times, and
on the basis of the results he obtains,
perhaps conclude that a bulbous bow
reduces drag most effectively. The
Bayesian, in comparison, would col-
lect such expert opinion as that of
the Naval Engineers connected with
the University's test tank. Weighting
their opinion in relation to the ex-
tent of their experience in this par-
ticular field, the Bayesian might
reach the same conclusion, although
their methods clearly differ. A more
dramatic demonstration of this differ-
ence in means is observed in a prob-
lem of this sort: "What is the proba-
bility that Russia will launch a
nuclear attack on the United States
tomorrow?" The classicist, having
neither the past experience to draw
from, nor the conceivable means to
conduct a test of relative frequency,
would be virtually strapped. Clearly,
f°r this, and countl^ other problems
never before considered within proba-
bility's scope, the Bayesian method is
necessary.
This unprecedented casual attitude
toward a source of data, and, indeed,
the whole of statistics, is the target of
much criticism from the classical
school. How can something as abstract
and unstable as personal opinion,
they ask, be considered as valid data?
One response to their objection comes
from Bruno deFinetti of the Univer-
sity of Rome. Professor deFinetti feels
that although the conclusions reached
by the Bayesian's methods may often
be founded on sand, they are nonethe-
less more productive than taking
away the sand and building on a void.
In addition to the central advan-
tage of being able to accept data from
many different sources, the Bayesian
method has "several peripheral ad-
vantages" pointed out in Probabilistic
Information Processing in Command
and Control Systems, a booklet pre-
pared by the Engineering Psychology
Laboratory lor the United States Air
Force Systems Command. One of
these advantages is that Bayes' the-
orem "automatically screens infonna-

retaining useful information, and
automatically weighting each item of
information according to its relevance
and importance." Another important
advantage, when a great deal of infor-
mation must be processed, is that the
Bayesian method requires a minimum
of record-keeping. Once a datum has
been processed by Equation I, it
serves no further use as far as its im-
pact on the conclusion is concerned.
A third peripheral advantage is that
"the output of the system is exactly
what is required for choosing a course
of action on the basis of maximization
of expected value"—a concept which
deserves immediate consideration.
The Engineering Psychology Labo-
ratory's booklet is largely concerned
with a semi-realistic military control
center whose sources of information
include BMEWS (Ballistic Missile
Early Warning System), MIDAS (a
system of missile detecting satellites),
and "438L" (the output of NORAD's
intelligence system.) From this com-
mand center issue decisions so
fringed with risk that the only rea-
sonable conclusion is one which maxi-
mizes expected value (the average
value to be expected from a corre-
sponding course of action.) This con-
cept is not to be confused or indenti-
fied with the so-called "minimax"
principle associated with game the-
ory. Introduced by John vonNeumann
and Oskar Morgenstern, the concept
of minimizing the chance of incurring
the maximum loss appears terribly
conservative in view of the conse-
quences of this problem. In order to
apply the principle of maximizing
expected value, four kinds of infor-
mation must be supplied: first, a
well-defined set or list of acts; second,
a well-defined mutally exclusive and
exhaustive set of "states of the world"
(hypotheses, diagnoses); third, for
each combination of a state and an
act, a single number called a payoff,
which is merely a decisionmaker's
judgement of the attractiveness of
that particular combination; fourth,
the probability of each state. If wljp
say, is the payoff associated with the
J-th act when combined with the I-th
state of the world, then the expected
value of the J-th act is defined as
Equation 2 is nothing more than
the equation for an average, and the
principle of maximizing expected
value says nothing more complicated
than that one should calculate the
average payoff for each act and choose
the act for which the average payoff
is greatest.
Enough has been said thus far to
indicate that in order to keep Bayes
theorem in continuum, one need
merely supply P (D/H) for each esti-
mation, the prior probability having
been the output of the previous calcu-
lation. Thus the heart of the practical
problem of designing a Bayesian in-
formation processing system is main-
taining this constant supply for data
entering the system. Sometimes these
numbers can be calculated on the
basis of similar past experience or
from some model of the information-
gathering process, or both. But, more
often, such an objective procedure
tends to overlook what common sense
would immediately recognize as the
solution. For example, calculation is
hardly adequate to assess the proba-
bility that Russian would have
lauched 25 reconnaissance satellites in
the last three days if she planned to
attack us within the next hour. Clear-
ly, interpretation of such information
is a matter for human judgment.
Once it is assumed that P (D/H) will
be supplied by human judgement, a
Bayesian information processing sys-
tem is rather straightforward in de-
sign. The set-up opposite is one of sev-
eral possible arrangements.
The first group of human oper-
ators, the interpreters, serve as a filter
for obviously irrelevant information
coming from the data sources. The
second group of human operators, the
"probability estimators" in Fig. I, are
the real heart of the system. They
supply the Bayesian processor (prob-
ably a large digital computer) with
estimates of P (D/H). The most effi-
cient mode of programming these
estimates into information the com-
puter can readily process is a problem
requiring further research.
The final human being in the sys-
tem, designated "commander" in Fig.
I for lack of a better name, must, of
necessity, be a person of considerable
experience with the objective. He,
thus, can recognize information com-
ing from the system which, in the
light of his knowledge, appears pa-
tently absurd. As a final and author-
atative source of information in the
system, he serves as a veto of sorts
over the rest of the process. This is a
power which, hopefully, would not
be often used. Regardless of the po-
tential check he holds over the rest of
the system, some sort of overall
human supervision in such a system
is necessary. The "commander" exer-
cises this control.
In deference to the trend in sta-
tistics toward the strength-of-personal-
conviction approach, many instructors
of statistics continue to adhere to the
notion that probability and relative
frequency are somehow inseperable.
Dr. J. O. Irwin of the Royal Statis-
tical Society justifies this position: "I
think all students of statistics should
learn something about probability
from a frequency point of view. When
teaching students with mature minds
who are new or almost new to the
subject, I usually give an outline of
the different theories of the subject,
tell them that they will find the fre-
quency theory the most useful in
practice, and to suspend judgement
on which theory they will ultimately
prefer until they have had more
opportunity of study." A factor fur-
ther contributing to the general
ignorance, if not taboo surrounding
Bayesian statistics is the lack of
creditable textbooks written concern-
ing statistical theory. Those written
ten or even five years ago have been
seriously outdated by advances in all
fields of statistics, but especially in
the strength- of-personal-conviction
area.
It appears that the opportunities
for the brilliant statistical analyst are
likely to increase even more sharply
within the next few years. John
Tukey, a mathematics professor at
Princeton and a member of the Bell
Telephone Laboratories staff, foresees
the development of new modes of
statistical analysis that will make
more use of freewheeling human
judgement and intuition. Hopefully,
someday, many different methods of
information analysis will have been
developed so that the statistician can
select an appropriately advantageous
solution to a problem. Then, statistics
will have matured beyond the domain
of pure science into an art form.
Appreciation, then, of any vehicle
aiding this maturation, is justly en-
gendered. The research efforts of the
Engineering Psychology Laboratory
certainly elicit such attention and ap-
preciation.

of 1964. It is also the second article in
a series on education presented by the

The Issue
Public education in the United
States is a controversial topic, not
only among professional educators
but also among people from all walks
of life who feel the effects of the
schools through the experiences of
their children, in the taxes they pay
and through the schools' impact on
the community. In recent years the
debate has intensified for several rea-
sons. The number of children en-
rolled in our schools is increasing so
rapidly that the economic factor
alone is staggering. The growing im-
portance of science and engineering,
in this space age, has created prob-
lems concerning all areas of the school
curriculum.
Many critics maintain that the
American schools fail to stress the im-
portance of academic achievement.
They claim there is too much empha-
sis on social development, on prepar-
ing the student for a place in society.
They feel the schools offer too many
non-academic courses which present
no intellectual motivation and that
AMERICAN PUBLIC
the bright students are not challenged
enough even in their academic sub-
jects. Often they point to the Euro-
pean system of education as a superior
method for the academic training of
our youth.
Our school system is defended by
by Philip Enns those who feel that the student must
be prepared not only for a specific
job but also for a useful role as a
citi/en and member of society. There-
fore, they contend, the schools must
offer a program which develops the
student on both the social and the
academic level. Also, since our schools
are committed to teach all the Ameri-
can youth, it is necessary that they
offer a wide range of subjects in order
to meet the needs of students of every
academic ability.

most significantly during the high
schools years, I must agree with the
latter group. I feel that the American
system of education is fundamentally
correct and, though there is much
need for improvement in all areas of
the schools' operations, the basic sys-
tem should not be changed.
The Goals of the Schools
There must be some agreement on
the objectives of education before any
decisions can be made regarding what
to teach and how to teach it. In spite
of the fact that purpose itself has al-
ways been a controversial subject in
education, I do not feel it is really as
difficult a problem as it may seem. As
Myron Lieberman states in The Fu-
ture of Public Education, "I believe
that the American people are in sub-
stantial agreement that the purposes
of education are the development of
critical thinking, effective communi-
cation, creative skills, and social, civ-
ic, and occupational competence." 1
For the most part I agree with these
objectives, but I would like to add
one more thought.The schools should
never cease to offer a challenge to all
the students, regardless of their aca-
demic ability. They should not exist
simply as a training ground for the
future. School is a most important
part of the present for the student
and should function as such. The only
way it can make his life interesting in
the present and give him hope for the
future is by challenging him continu-
ously while at the same time prepar-
ing him for later life.
Our System Compared with that
in Europe
Before discussing the problems of
American education, I would like to
explain why I favor our basic plan
over Europe's. In the European pro-
gram, all students are taught together
until the age of about eleven. The
top 15 to 20 percent then enter pre-
university schools and are given a
rigorous academic training until they
are 19 when they begin their higher
education. The remaining 80 to 85
percent of the students enter general
or vocational schools and almost all
begin work on a part time or full time
basis at the age of 14 or 15. Under the
American public system, featuring the
"comprehensive" high school, all stu-
dents are taught together until they
are 18. Of course, from grades 9
through 12, not all follow the same
curriculum but the fact that they are
attending the same school is in direct
contrast to the European program.
For American purposes, our system
is definitely better than that of
Europe. Our chronic unemployment
prohibits us from sending our youth
to work at age 14 or 15. In fact, Labor
Secretary Wirtz recently suggested
that the states raise their compulsory
school ages to 18 to cut down the
large number of high school dropouts,
many of whom cannot find jobs. On
the other hand, much of Europe is
experiencing a labor shortage and
jobs are readily available for the
young workers there.
The American comprehensive
school promotes our ideal of equal
opportunity for all. In Europe, the
social classes are much more sharply
defined and often a child's family
status is an important factor in deter-
mining whether he will attend a pre-
university school. Finally, the worst
feature of the European system is that
the student's future is determined at
such an early age. Even with modern
aptitude testing, it is impossible to
choose consistently the 11 year old
students who will succeed in the pre-
university academies and those who
will not. As James B. Conant states in
The American High School Today,
"No one has estimated how much po-
tential talent goes undeveloped in
Germany, France, Italy, and Switzer-
land because of the early selection of
the preuniversity students—a selection
often influenced by the class system of
European lands."2 Granted, the
American schools may not develop
the full potential of many of their
students but at least everyone is given
a chance.
In further support of my argument
for the American plan, there is evi-
dence that Europe is gradually work-
ing toward a comprehensive system
similar to ours in an effort to educate
more students better. British educator
Sir Eric Ashby recently stated here at
Michigan, "We are turning over to
your pattern; within 20 years the job
should be complete."3 This move
should be expected since the Euro-
pean nations are developing a society
which is politically, socially and eco-
nomically more like ours.
Academic Opportunities
For the Gifted Students
Many people are quite concerned
that our junior and senior high
schools are not adequately teaching
the bright students, the upper 15 to
20 percent corresponding to Europe's
pre university group. The critics make
several charges. They maintain that
the top students are required to take
too many courses which are of little
interest or importance to them. These
not only bore the student but also fail
to stimulate his best work. The most
serious contention is that when the
bright student does take a class deal-
ing with a subject which interests
him, he is not challenged by the way
it is presented.
The first problem is essentially one
of high school graduation require-
ments. All comprehensive high schools
have certain minimum requirements
for the graduation of college-bound
students. In my school, for the grades
9 through 12, students like myself are
obligated to take four full years of
English, four of physical education,
one of American history, a science
course in the senior year and driver
education.
Those students interested in at-
tending a college comparable to the
University of Michigan must choose
the rest of their classes mainly from
the academic fields of mathematics,
science, foreign languages and social
studies, with a few openings for non-
academic subjects. I think these re-
quirements are rather typical of most
high schools and it seems to me that,
aside from English and physical edu-
cation, the student is fairly unre-
stricted. The talented student, who
is perhaps looking toward a future
in engineering, could take four years
of both math and science and still
meet his other requirements easily.
In the same way, the person who en-
joys foreign language or history could
elect these subjects all through high

can offer four years of work in the
various fields like language or science.
This is usually true in smaller schools
and the problem cannot be easily
solved except through reorganization
into fewer large schools, as Conant
suggests.
Strong criticism of the English and
physical education requirements is
not justified. Even for the bright stu-
dents, eight semesters of English can
be extremely rewarding, not only for
its own value but for the influence it
has on his other work. Aside from the
fact that I personally believe in the
importance of physical exercise, I do
not think the average school's physical
education program is at all a time
burden for any student. The class
assigns no homework and usually
meets only once every other day. If
anything, physical education should
be emphasized more and not less.
The most serious problem facing
the academically talented student in
the American school is the lack of
challenge offered by his courses. In
America, an average of 35 to 40 per-
cent of all our youth go on to college
and in my own community the figure
is considerably above the average.
Obviously, the regular college pre-
paratory program must be geared to
the academic level of the majority
of this group. This level is consider-
ably lower than that of the European
pre-university schools which train
only the top 15 to 20 percent. As a
result, the bright American student is
not fully challenged like his European
counterpart. Speaking from my own
experience, I believe the best solution
to this problem lies in the rapidly
growing Advanced Placement Pro-
gram.
This program is excellent for sev-
eral reasons. It gives the best students
a chance to associate, exchange ideas
formally and informally, and learn
at a rate which is appropriate for their
level of intelligence. The material
covered is more enriched and, if pre-
sented properly, often inspires the
student to do additional work on his
own. Of course there is the added in-
centive of possible college credit
gained by passing the A. P. exam. All
this is accomplished while the ad-
vantages of the comprehensive high
school are maintained.
For people like myself, the greatest
advantage to the A. P. program is
that it is not too exclusive. I was for-
tunate enough to participate in A. P.
math all through high school. Though
I was always among the poorer stu-
dents in the class, this was still the
most rewarding experience in my
high school academic life. I have al-
ways been aware that if I had taken
the regular math courses my grades
would probably have been no better
and I would have spent the study
time on less useful things.
The A. P. program has its short-
comings. It is not feasible in small
schools which have limited teaching
staffs and only a few students capable
of doing the work. In these cases, the
bright students must find other ways
to extend their learning. After-school
seminars with extra assigned work are
a possible solution. Sometimes a school
will not have an instructor truly cap-
able of teaching an A. P. course on
the proper level. This is an unfor-
tunate situation and must be dealt
with when the teachers are being
trained in college. In spite of these
drawbacks, the A. P. program is a
great achievement and I hope it will
continue to expand. In my school by
this time advanced courses are being
offered in English, math, French,
German, physics, chemistry and
American history.
I realize the importance of giving
the academically talented students an
opportunity to fully develop their
skills as they prepare for college.
Frankly, however, I think the prob-
lem has been greatly overemphasized,
especially since the Russian Sputnik
success in 1957. Although there is cer-
tainly room for improvement, the
American high school student is real-
ly not in very much danger of falling
behind academically. This is evi-
denced by the rapidly rising college
admissions standards.
The results of an overemphasis on
academics could be quite serious. If
the student is pressured into studying
hard at the junior and senior high
school level, he may begin to lose in-
terest in his work when he reaches
college. This is often the case in the
European schools. In France, for in-
stance, such a slump in the student's
work is not only common but prac-
tically expected and constitutes a
serious problem for French educators.
As Martin Mayer describes it: "From
the age of eleven to fourteen or per-
haps fifteen . . . the student. . . partic-
ipates vigorously in his education—
but after the age of sixteen he sits in
the classroom like a hardened lump
of dough." 4 Equally harmful is the
overemphasis on grades in junior and
senior high school. It is often far too
easy for a student to get a good mark
without learning very much, and as
long as our youth are encouraged to
compete for good grades rather than
understanding, this condition will
persist.
The regular college preparatory
courses like English, algebra and
American history are well established
in the high schools and many times
people accept them without consider-
ing that they could be improved.
With more and more of our youth
aiming for college, these courses must
accommodate an ever-widening range
of academic abilities. When I was in
high school, my English classes, for
instance, often included students who
were taking two or three Advanced
Placement courses and students who
eventually never even went to college.
This gap between the intellectual
levels of the students in a class pre-
sents serious problems for the teacher
and the school.
As school enrollments grow and
more of our youth plan on higher
education, it may be necessary to in-
troduce a new level of college-prep
courses designed for those of lower
ability who are still capable of doing
future college work. However, for
the present, the problem is not so
serious that it cannot be solved by
improved methods of instruction and
better textbooks. There will ine-
vitably be students in each class who
are not capable of doing the required
work, although school counsellors
should be more careful to discourage
their placement in these classes. On
the other hand, there will probably
always be students who are capable
of doing advanced work. The A. P.
program should be able to accommo-
date these students, although as I
recall from my own experience, for
various reasons they sometimes lack
the incentive to participate in A. P.
courses even when invited. The class
should aim toward giving the stu-
dents a knowledge of the course sub-
ject which is both challenging and
useful, without favoring the students
of extremely low or high ability.
For the Less Gifted
As already stated, 35 to 40 percent
of America's youth go on to college
from high school. The other 60 to
(55 percent essentially end their formal
education with high school. In terms
20

they create, therefore, these students
deserve more attention than the
college-bound group if we are to ad-
vance the American ideal of equal
opportunity for all. It has been more
popular in recent years to worry
about the bright students. Realistic
Americans are aware, however, that
we will have a more serious problem
if we let the people of lower academic
ability fall far behind in our rapidly
advancing technological society. Our
present unemployment rate already
shows what is happening to the un-
skilled laborer. From both a socio-
logical and economic point of view
we cannot afford to ignore the less
talented students.
I believe the public schools can
and must provide the training for the
average and poor students necessary
for them to lead useful, secure lives.
This group requires a somewhat more
diversified program than the college
preparatory group. The high school
curriculum for the college-bound stu-
dent is rather generalized since he is
expected to gain his specific training
through his higher education. How-
ever, the non-college-bound students
require a more specialized high school
training. Since there is a very wide
range of ability and interests within
this group, there must logically be a
greater variety of curricula.
I believe my own high school pro-
vides a fairly comprehensive program
for the student who is not planning
on a college education. While about
55 percent of the graduates go on to
higher education, the school still
offers five different curricula for the
remaining 45 percent. All these pro-
grams have the same basic require-
ments as the college preparatory
curriculum, but the English, Ameri-
can history and science courses are
somewhat less demanding than those
for the pre-college program. From this
foundation, the programs go on to
prepare the students for a variety of
jobs. The student can learn skills in
sales and general office work, secre-
tarial work, business and accounting.
There is, of course, an industrial arts
program for those planning on vari-
ous shop and mechanical jobs, al-
though there are no programs de-
signed for a specific vocation as in
large cities which have less college-
oriented student bodies. A general
program is offered to the student who
is interested in fields like art and home
economics which are not covered by
these other curricula. In addition
there is a program called Cooperative
Occupational Training (C. O. T.) for
the students from all these curricula.
Under the C. O. T. plan, the student
attends school part of the day and
works in one of the local business
establishments the rest of the time.
The only drawback to this on-the-job
training is that the student worker is
the first to be laid off during periods
of slow business.
I am aware that the elaborate pro-
grams for the students with less aca-
demic ability often have only limited
success in preparing the youth for
work. Unfortunately, as Mayer says,
"Nobody anywhere in the world
knows how to give secondary educa-
tion to the bottom third of the intelli-
gence distribution ..."5 This not
only is an educational but also a so-
cial problem. The poorer students
usually come from an environment of
low intellectual development. The
problem cannot be solved simply
with better school course offerings.
However, the schools can help by
continually improving their courses
and adjusting them to the needs of
the community.
Some critics accuse the schools of
offering too many "frill" courses like
cooking, jewelry-making and others.
It should be apparent by now that
such subjects are usually not as trivial
as they might seem. It is an important
function of the schools to train all
students to lead interesting lives and
for many students of lower intellect
the so-called "frills" offer a means
within their abilities of achieving this
goal. Sometimes these courses teach a
useful skill which even the college-
bound student enjoys having. It is
quite possible for some of these cour-
ses actually to becmoe frills, in which
case they should be eliminated. In
any event, the intelligent educator
must keep in mind the needs of the
entire student body.
Social Adjustment
Critics claim that our schools place
too much emphasis on the social de-
velopment of the students. They say
that the time and money spent in this
area could be better spent on academ-
ics. I do not agree with this argument.
I do not recall being taught formally
how to be socially competent. Hope-
fully, this is one of the side effects of
everyday classroom experience, but
the schools can hardly be accused of
wasting class time in this area.
It is the extra-curricular activities
like athletics, student government,
etc. that are really the subject of criti-
cism and I feel that these are neces-
sary and not harmful. First of all,
these activities rarely interfere with
regular classes and do not take up so
much of the average student's free
time that he must sacrifice his school-
work. Of course, the individual must
exercise some judgment as to how
much time he can afford for these
activities. I was on the swimming
team, one of my high school's most
time-consuming sports, and yet I
rarely fell behind in my studies. Most
extra-curricular activities are quite in-
expensive to the school and often they
help pay for themselves by fund rais-
ing campaigns, sports admission prices
and other means.
Even if the cost were greater, I
think it would be a good investment
for the school because of the value
of the activities to the student. These
programs give him a chance to use
his free time constructively. He is able
to make friends on the social rather
than academic level and his interests
and personality are broadened. Those
who avoid these activities usually
spend their time much less construc-
tively. Unfortunately, as I noticed in
high school, a large part of the group
which does not participate is made
up of the non-college-bound students
who would profit most from the
extra-curricular programs.
An Idea for the Future
In conclusion, I would like to sug-
gest a general way for the schools to
work toward their objectives. Only
by continually experimenting with
courses and curricula will educators be
able to improve the success of their
efforts. The American schools are far
from perfect now and our society is
undergoing rapid changes which must
be accompanied by appropriate
changes in the schools. The field of
education has a record of being slow
to innovate and I feel that educators
should be more liberal in their poli-
cies. All courses from the standard
English class to the automobile shop
should be subject to possible changes.
When it is reasonable, a trial and
error approach could be used. It
seems to me that frequent experimen-
tation would make the work of the
student, the teacher and the admin-

by Alan L. Goodman
from The Cornell Engineer
The work of scientists and engi-
neers, in large measure, "will decide
whether we live or die, and how we
live or die. It holds decisive powers
for good and evil."1 Where does the
heavy weight of responsibility for this
work and its effects lie: upon the
individual scientist or engineer, gov-
ernment, industry, or society?
For purposes of illustration I should
like to consider the experiences of
two groups of people: the atomic sci-
entists and the German public.
The Atomic Scientists
Einstein's celebrated letter to Pres-
ident Roosevelt marked the beginning
of the scientists' unwanted involve-
ment with public affairs. Writing on
behalf of several of his colleagues,
Einstein warned Roosevelt that the
German scientists might soon provide
Hitler with a weapon insuring invin-
cibility, the atomic bomb. He urged
the president to undertake a crash
development program to provide the
United States with this weapon. The
advice was heeded.
When the Germans surrendered,
we found that they were far from be-
ing able to control atomic reactions.
At this time the American scientists
grew uneasy, fearful of what would
follow. When the government pro-
posed using their weapon in [apart,
the scientists protested, to no avail.
They had committed themselves to
the Manhattan Project in order to
ward off a greater evil, the Nazi re-
gime. But the genie was out of the
bottle, and the scientists could not
put him back.
This experience had a searing and
chastening effect on the scientists in-
volved.
"Philip Morrison, in an address re-
printed in the newly founded Bulletin
of the Atomic Scientists of Chicago, re-
called the words of a Japanese radiolo-
gist, who had survived Hiroshima: 'I
did the experiment years ago, but only
on a few rats. But you Americans—you
are wonderful. You have made the hu-
man experiment.' 'No one,' wrote Morri-
son, 'could fail to carry the scar of such a
cutting thrust.'"2
Lecturing at MIT in 19-17, Oppen-
heimer stated,
"Nowhere is this troubled sense of re-
sponsibility more acute, and surely no-
where has it been more prolix than
among those who participated in the
development of atomic energy for military
purposes. I should think that most his-
torians would agree that other technical
developments, notably radar, played a
more decisive part in determining the
outcome of this last war. But I doubt
whether that participation would have
of itself created the deep trouble and
moral concern which so many of us who
were physicists have felt, have voiced,
and have tried to get over feeling. It is
not hard to understand why this should
be so. The physics which played the de-
cisive part in the development of the
atomic bomb came straight out of war
laboratories and our journals.
"Despite the vision and the farseeing
wisdom of our war-time heads of state,
the physicists felt a peculiar intimate re-
sponsibility for suggesting, for supporting,
and in the end, in large measure, for
achieving the realization of atomic wea-
pons. Nor can we forget that these wea-
pons, as they were in fact used, drama-
tized so mercilessly the inhumanity and
evil of modern war. In some sort of crude
sense which no vulgarity, no humor, no
overstatement can quite extinguish, the
physicists have known sin; and this is a
knowledge which they cannot lose." 3
The sort of awareness and sensitivi-
ty displayed by these two physicists
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


was not uncommon among their col-
leagues. For reasons of conscience,
some physicists, as Norbert Wiener,
simply refused to provide technical
assistance to the military. Others con-
tinued their work for the military,
bul with a more highly sensitized
awareness of responsibility. Many of
them have
"played active and important parts in
recent political history. They have dis-
cussed problems and formulated policies
among themselves and with scientists of
other nations. They have on occasion
made themselves lobbyists for legislation
in the area of their interests, participated
in the making and unmaking of military
and foreign policy."4
Whether we condone or condemn
the actions and decisions of these
men, we must realize that they have
struggled with the burdensome ques-
tion of responsibility and, at least in
part, have placed the guilt upon them-
selves.
The German Public
What of the experience of the Ger-
man public during and after the Hit-
ler regime? Where lies the guilt for
Auschwitz? One observer of Germany,
Peter Viereck, wrote in 1940:
"The German enigma is not Hitler.
Nor is it the behavior of either frauds
or police—sadists. . . . The real enigma
is the honest, unsadistic German majority
that unleashes them rather than throw-
ing them in jail. Hitler's shoddy day-
dreams are not interesting. What is inter-
esting is that an outstanding educated
nation crusades for them.
"Mein Kampf was a best-seller long
before the German people, voting unco-
erced in the free Reichstag election of
September 19S0, increased the Nazi seats
from 12 to 107 and made them the big-
gest party in Germany. By then, Hitler
had said in Mein Kempf (to pick a typ-
ical threat at random:) 'If at the start
[of World War I] we had held under
poison gas twelve or fifteen thousand of
these Hebrew subverters of our people
. . . then the sacrifice of a million Ger-
mans at the front would not have been
in vain. . . . The timely elimination of
12,000 bums.
"Note the revealing phraseology, the
sadistic physical force implied in saying
not plain 'gassed' but 'held under'
The German enigma is: just what kind
of behavior could those millions of pro-
Hitler voters, from 1930 on, expect of the
monster mentality that composes such
'held under' threats? We have no inside
facts about what goes on in his 'rehabili-
tation' camps; we make no charges, no
predictions. We merely record that such
threats are typical of Hitler's book, that
his book is no classified secret document,
that millions of Germans own it, and
that at least a few must have browsed in
it. These few must have included some of
the cheering public and also some in-
fluential dignitaries with access to press,
radio and other means of warning the
public. . . .
"Hitler's extermination expert, R.
Hoess, wrote in Commandment of Ausch-
witz (New York, 1960): 'When a strong
wind was blowing, the stench of burn-
ing flesh was carried for many miles and
caused the whole neighborhood to talk
about the burning of the Jews.' He notes,
of still another camp, that whenever a
bus of victims drove past, even the Ger-
man children chortled in the street:
'There comes the murder box again!')
"Some clay the same Germans now
cheering Hitler's strut into Paris, will say
to their American friends and to their
brave German anti-Nazi friends: 'We did
not know what went on, we did not
know'; and when that day of know-noth-
ing comes, there will be laughter in hell.
"Not to know and yet to know: per-
haps this will be the heaviest moral bur-
den ever borne by any culture . . . shall
brisk new generations, with jobs to do,
simply forget and go about their business?
Meanwhile a war is on; Paris has fallen;
Lord forgive them—first defeat them,
then forgive them—for they well know
what they do." 5
The date was 1940.
What, then, is the root of the
German problem? What causes "or-
dinary, God-fearing people" like you
and me to become mass murderers?
And how can these same people so
easily resume their civilian life with
so little anguish?
One psychologist, Professor Horst-
Eberhard Richter of Giessen Univer-
sity, has suggested that the answer
lies in the German sense of obligation
to obey orders. Many of the war crim-
inals were not rabid Nazis. Neither
were they innately aggressive indi-
viduals whose outlet was brutality.
"Richter points out that in post-war
West German trials of Nazis, one defense
argument has recurred with monotonous
regularity: 'I was only obeying orders'.
. . . 'For these people authority is a sub-
stitute for their ego. . . . They can only
incur guilt by disobeying or coming into
conflict with this ego—in other words,
authority.' He argues that such people
can easily be converted to other forms
of totalitarianism as long as they fulfill
their desire to depend on higher author-
ity. The ideology is of secondary import-
ance. . . . Many defendants charged with
concentration camp shootings and gass-
ings have testified it never occurred to
them to question orders.
"A professor charged with participat-
ing in Adolf Hitler's euthanasia program
argued he received his assignment from
Hitler himself and therefore it never
occurred to him that he could be doing
anything wrong.
"As to the smooth transition of Ger-
NOVEMBER 1964
23


the war, Richter suggests many people
regard the present government as the
authority in the same way as they re-
garded the Hitler regime." 6
The German public did not seri-
ously consider the problem of indi-
vidual responsibility. Obeying author-
ity was the important thing.
The Engineering Profession
The rough sketches of these two
case histories will enable us to exam-
ine our main concern, the engineering
profession, in sharper perspective.
The engineering profession has a
"Canon of Ethics." The foreword to
this Canon and two pertinent sections
from the body of the Canon are re-
printed on this page. It is my inten-
tion to show that this Canon is hypo-
critically pious, or, at best, simply
meaningless.
Many engineers are spending their
mature lives in conceiving and making
operational systems whose specific
function is annihilation of human
life. These engineers, in my mind,
bear a strong resemblance to the
German public. The striking part of
the resemblance is not in the work
which they are doing, but in the state
of mind in which they are doing it.
I refer to moral insensitivity, unques-
tioning respect for authority, and an
unwillingness to assume personal re-
sponsibility for one's work. The words
are the same, "I was only obeying
my orders."
"Now let's be sensible," you are
saying to yourself. "How can you
possibly hold this poor fellow, Mr.
Engineer, personally responsible for
the evil impulses of the society and
the world in which he lives. For this,
in essence, is what you are doing,
isn't it?"
Let us then pursue the matter fur-
ther, and consider what the effects of
government, industry, and society are,
and whether the burden of guilt can
successfully be discarded at their back
doors, thereby securing us from un-
necessary mental anguish, fears, and
doubts.
The Government
The relationship of science and
engineering with the government has
changed drastically during the last
few decades. Before the world wars,
scientific and technological advances
were matters relegated to the ivory
towers of independent men in univer-
sities and personal workshops. The
advance of science and technology
was not a prerequisite for the contin-
ued existence of our nation. This is
no longer true. Scientific and techno-
logical superiority is tantamount to
military superiority.
Consequently, the federal govern-
ment has undertaken the financing of
the bulk of the Research and Devel-
opment program. (Don Price esti-
mates that nearly two-thirds of the
R&amp;D work is government subsi-
dized.7) Therefore, the government
holds the power of the purse as far
as scientific and technological devel-
opment is concerned. This power
gives the holder the ability to deter-
mine what projects shall be pursued.
Workers can be placed on the desired
projects in numbers large or small,
according to the dictates of a central
bureaucracy.
Some will protest, "rampant social-
ism." Others will appeal to the "harsh
realities of our time" for justification.
In either case we have not yet an-
swered our question. For positing the
responsibility on the "broad backs of
those vast impersonal forces—institu-
tions or historic trends—better made
to bear such burdens than a feeble,
thinking reed like man," 8 is, in fact,
placing it nowhere—except out of
sight.
The Organization
It is rather amusing that the peo-
ple who are impressed with the value
of a "free economic society promoting
individual initiative" are those who
argue most about socialism and the
welfare state. For our capitalist econ-
omy has produced an institution—
the organization—which makes the so-
cialist state largely unnecessary.
What difference is there between
an organization which employs hun-
dreds of thousands of workers and a
state which regulates the lives of 50
or 100 million workers? In either case
the regulatory forces are far removed
from the individual worker. In either
case the workers' charity donations,
welfare needs, and so forth are taken
care of. Most important, in either
case the individual is seduced into
abandoning the responsibility for his
actions and their consequences.
The organization has been personi-
fied. It has a pulse and a central ner-
vous system. The departments are
the organs. The workers are the cells.
"We are freed from the sense of per-
sonal endeaver. Our sense of guilt and of
sin, our pangs of remorse and self-con-
demnation, are automatically dissolved;
the tension, the fear of failure and frus-
tration disappear as we become
of the elements of a larger '(
whole' . . . our belief in an are:
ever circumscribed, in which *t
choose to act as we wish, falls fr
. . . We are soldiers in an army,;
no longer suffer the pains and pi
of solitude; the army is on the mar
goals are set for us, not chosen
doubts are stilled by authority."1
The organization has its
which William Whyte terms i
cial Ethic. The individual by 1
can accomplish little that is
while. The twentieth century, \
integrated technology, require
grated (i.e., group) thinking a
ation.
"A status quo cannot long

that things are the way they are

there are unmistakable signs thai
ber of people have been gropii

Smoothness of operation is
word. Hence obedience to ai
conformity, and elimination
erratic genius are essential.

Originally, this crosshead for a lift truck was
not a forging. Now it is forged in steel. Here's
why . . .
The lift truck builder wanted to increase the
safety factor to meet greater bending and shear
stresses. He also wanted to increase the fatigue
strength of the part. And all without any in-
crease in weight or cost. He also wanted
reduce tool breakage caused by irregular
voids, and inclusions.

Now the crosshead has the required strengt i
and stress-resistance, costs 20% less whe
machined and ready to assemble, increase
production rates 14% by reducing tool break
age and increasing machining speeds.
Forgings are better for these reasons; they
1. Are solid, free from voids and inclusior
2. Have high fatigue resistance
3. Are strongest under impact and shock I
4. Have a higher modulus of elasticity
5. Have a unique stress-oriented fiber

EDUCATION
AND
RESEARCH
by Paul Niffenegger
Computers in Design
Traditionally based on judgment,
intuition, and experience, engineering
design now is being radically affected
by the ever increasing use of power-
ful computers and new mathematical
techniques.
These will "narrow the area of
doubt in design" and "lead to de-
signs with a minimum of guess work,"
according to Donald L. Kat/, profes-
sor of chemical and metallurgical
engineering at The University of
Michigan.
Because the effect of the computer
on engineering design will become
even more widespread, he feels en-
gineering design teachers must in-
struct their students in the subtleties
and benefits of the application of
computers and these new mathe-
matical techniques. The National Sci-
ence Foundation agrees and has
granted the U. of M. $179,690 to
study these effects on engineering de-
sign.
Three workshops for faculty from
the nation's engineering schools are
being planned, beginning next sum-
mer. At the first workshop, 20 top
engineering design professors and
practitioners will spend two months
at the U. of M. to explore the latest
advances in the field and to work out
a course of instruction. The follow-
ing year, additional workshops would
be held to disseminate the informa-
tion .iihI (ourse suggestions to all UJS.
engineering schools.
Professor Kat/, who directs this
program, points out it is a logical suc-
cessor to the three year $1-million
program that the U. of M. completed
last year on how best to introduce
computer usage in undergraduate
. courses. He also directed that pro-
gram, which was sponsored by the
;Ford Foundation.
"The impact of computers on de-
sign will be in two major areas," he
points out. "First, engineers are now,
and will be increasingly freed of ted-
ious and repetitive computations t&gt;\
relegating them to the computer."
"The second, and probably the most
important area for the future of de-
sign involves the philosophy of design
itself. The computer makes possible,
and perhaps even mandatory, new
procedures and methods of approach
to engineering design problems wrhich
have not been experienced before."
The Kresge Hearing Research Institute
The process of hearing involves
perhaps a greater diversity of events
than does any other sensory process.
Ranging from the purely physical
(the wave transmission of a sound) to
the purely psychological (the percep-
tion of what the sound means), these
events pertain not only to the recep-
tion of sounds by the ear but to the
production of sounds by the voice.
Moreover, the ear contains perhaps
a greater diversity of parts—ranging
from muscles and secretory cells to
bones and blood vessels—than does
any other bodily structure. Its con-
stituents can truly be said to repre-
sent those of the entire body "in
little."
To cope with this diversity of
events and parts, the "compleat" in-
vestigator of hearing would be
grounded in chemistry, physics, acous-
tics, and electronics: in anatomy,
physiology, neurology, histopathology,
and otorhinolaryngology (study of
the ear, nose, and throat); and, since
hearing loss often imposes severe
problems of personal adjustment, in
psychiatry, psychology, and speech
pathology.
But any one lifetime is too short
30

for the acquisition of such ground-
ing. Therefore, modern hearing re-
search is favorably conducted in a sit-
uation which brings specialists from
related fields into working contact.
The Kresge Hearing Research Insti-
tute was founded to provide just this
sort of situation. Its interdisciplinary
approach in no way supersedes the
efforts of individual researchers work-
ing within a single discipline. Rather
it supplements such efforts, and offers
a unique setting in which clinical
problems can be corelated with ad-
vances in basic research.
This article is concerned with
the Institute as an enterprise de-
signed, both physically and organ-
izationaly, to bring the resources
of an entire medical center to bear
on problems of hearing and deafness.
Before the Institute was established,
basic research on these problems was
performed at the University by the
Physiological Acoustics Laboratory of
the Medical School. Then, in 1960,
a most generous gift from the S. S.
Kresge Foundation made possible
the founding of the Institute and the
construction of its unexcelled facili-
ties. Established by Regental action as
part of the Medical School, the Insti-
tute is devoted to a broad research
effort in which three main interests
can be identified: the functioning of
the normal ear; pathologies of the ear
and remedial measures; and human
sound production and recognition.
The Institute's 36,000-square-foot
building is perhaps the only one in
the world designed from the ground
up for hearing research. Because many
hearing experiments demand the qui-
etest possible environment, all prac-
ticable measures have been taken to
ensure the building's freedom from
noise and vibration. All pipe and con-
duit connections to other buildings
and to moving equipment (motors,
fans, and transformers) are made
through vibration isolators, and such
equipment is mounted on vibration-
isolating platforms. Also mounted on
these platforms and electrically shield-
ed are thirteen soundproof rooms,
along with one anechoic (echo-free)
chamber. The chamber is used for
very precise calibrations of sound-
producing and recording equipment.
Its inside walls are completely lined
with sound-absorbing wedges three
feet deep and made of fiber glass.
Areas of the building are reserved
for tissue culture, electronmicroscopy,
histology, experimental surgery, and
biochemical and physiological re-
search. Other areas are reserved
for animal maintenance and for
an electronics and machine shop—
the latter containing equipment
which produces much of the advanced
instrumentation used in the creation
and measurement of sound. Through
a grant from the National Institutes
of Health, a training room has been
fully furnished and equipped for use
by Medical School residents in otor-
hinolaryngology. A conference room
is used for weekly staff meetings, hear-
ing conferences, and for larger func-
tions such as the annual Postgraduate
Medicine Course in Otorhinolarn-
gology.
By administrative as well as physi-
cal organization, the Institute is in-
tended to be as flexible as possible,
responsive to the changing needs and
interests of researchers. A director,
Dr. Merle Lawrence, has been ap-
pointed to give appropriate contin-
uity and supervision to the Institute's
activities. All research programs and
policies are under the supervision of
a Faculty Advisory Committee, which
is in turn responsible to the Dean and
Executive Committee of the Medical
School. A Visiting Scientific Com-
mittee, composed of distinguished
scientific and administrative leaders
throughout the country, helped to
plan the Institute's building and con-
tinues to lend general advisory sup-
port. With this organizational pattern,
it is hoped that the Institute's work
will be strengthened not only by re-
sources of the University's Medical
School and Medical Center but by
those of the academic and medical
communities in the largest sense.

ing its laboratory river—now bigger
than ever—back to nature. This week
scientists at the School of Public
Health activated a 200-foot long arti-
ficial creek to begin the second phase
of a controlled study of river "life".
The site chosen is an open field beside
the Huron River a few miles east of
the University campus. It is on the
grounds of the Ann Arbor waste-
water treatment plant.
From experiments on a slime-form-
ing organism may come data to bring
many slime-cogged U. S. rivers and
streams back to recreational beauty
and commercial productivity, it was
pointed out.
Built of adjustable aluminum
sections, the miniature river can sim-
ulate most conditions of natural
streams. Researchers can change the
configuration of the banks and river
bed, alter the rate-of-flow and angle
of fall, and create conditions of
drought or heavy run-off as their
work requires.
Test equipment is balanced on rick-
ity card tables. Power lines ramble
through the grass, and plastic samp-
ling tubes connect the flume with
measuring apparatus.
The long range goal of the study
is to find out precisely how nature
purifies its livers of organic jetsarm-

specialists hope to unlock the secrets
of Sphaerotilus natans (pronounced:
spear-/47~-il-us NAY-tar\7.), an unusual
bacteria which creates damaging slime
formations in rivers throughout the
world. The organism, although pres-
ent in most rivers, has proved highly
resistent to past scientific attacks.
Last March, the Michigan investi-
gators built a 15-foot long river inside
a laboratory at the School of Public
Health. To learn what makes the
Sphaerotilus bacteria thrive, they be-
gan feeding it controlled amounts of
nutrients.
After weeks of juggling minute
amounts of phosphorus, nitrogen and
carbohydrates, they found the right
combination. Long, colorless strands
of the organism began forming in the
artificial creek.
Assembling the several nutrients
which had finally triggered the bac-
teria's growing spree, the U. of M.
researchers made an eye-opening dis-
covery: The combination was just like
molasses.
So they bought a barrel of mo-
lasses.
And with some electric pumps, 200
feet of aluminum "river", plastic
sheeting and power cable, they began
moving the operation into the field.
During the coming weeks, they will
keep adjusting their river until they
achieve the desired flow-rate, channel
configuration and angle of fall.
Then they will start trickling in
the molasses, and begin accumulating

Bubble Chamber
One of the world's biggest heavy-
liquid bubble chambers has just been
sent to the Argonne National Labora-
tory (ANL) near Chicago. University
of Michigan physicists designed and
built the device for studying suba-
tomic particles. It will be used in
conjunction with ANL's new 12
billion electron volt (BEV) particle
accelerator (or atom-smasher) which
produces the particles the physicists
want to study.
Prior to dismantling, the machine
was tested. It produced "beautiful pic-
tures" of cosmic ray tracks, reports
U. of M. Prof. Byron P. Roe. Roe and
faculty colleagues Daniel Sinclair and
John Velde were in charge of the
$700,000 Atomic Energy Commission
project.
To use the bubble chamber for
their studies, physicists make photo-
graphs of the bubble tracks produced
by the invisible nuclear particles
knocked from a target substance by a
high energy proton beam from the
accelerator. Measurement of the par-
ticles that produce the tracks.
At Argonne, the bubble chamber
will be surrounded by a 300-ton mag-
net whose magnetic field will make
charged particles curve in their flight.
Such curved paths allow physicists to
measure the momentum of the par-
ticles. The magnetic field will be
stronger than that of any other oper-
ating bubble chamber.
The magnet, however, is not part
of the unit being shipped from here.
The entire device will be 45 feet long
and 16 feet high. Its 40 inch window
is made of optically perfect glass, 10
inches thick.
U. of M. physicists plan to use the
instrument for about two experiments
per year. These will produce some
200,000 photographs each, the sorting
and examination of which will re-
quire about 10 months.

found deterioration in the ethical stan-
dards of the people. That is, whether or
not you won the game is a lot more im-
portant than how you played. Professor
Freund of the University of Detroit feels
that engineers must do their share in
reversing this trend by stricty guarding
out professional ethics.
American ethical standards, espec-
ially in business and industry, are in-
credibly superior to what they were,
say, in the nineties. On the other hand
it does appear that this superior ethi-
cal structure is weakening just a little.
For example, there is abundant evi-
dence that some of our local and
state governments are not too far
above suspicion. Not long ago Henry
Ford II told American businessmen
in a speech at Minneapolis that they
had better give their ethics a thor-
ough going over. Within recent years
some of the leading American elec-
trical equipment manufacturers did
not particularly edify the nation. And
before that we had the mink coats
and the television scandals.
Engineers' Job
We engineers don't have to take
over the national morality and keep
it on the straight and narrow. That is
not our business; we have other things
to do. But there is one thing we en-
gineers can do, we must answer to
the American people for our profes-
sional engineering ethics. This respon-
sibility we can't pass on to anybody
else.
Engineering Situation
How does the ethical situation look
in engineering? A favorable circum-
stance is that several strong and ener-
getic committees on ethics are estab-
lished in the profession.
One of these is a joint committee
of Engineers' Council for Professional
Development and the American So-
ciety for Engineering Education.
This joint committee has undertaken
to prepare a handbook or guide in
engineering ethics. This was badly
needed. Engineers have had only prin-
ciples and rules, but no actual cases
or illustrative material for explana-
tion. The joint committee is under
the direction of Dr. N. A. Christensen
of Cornell University.
This committee has corresponded
Ethics:
REQUISITE FOR
ULTIMATE
SURVIVAL
by Prof. Clement J. Freund
Reprinted from The American Engineer,
February, 1963
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the several national engineering so-
cieties, with committees on ethics of
these societies, with state boards of
engineering examiners, with engineer-
ing employers, and with very many
individual engineers.
The data which this committee has
gathered seem to indicate that abuses
are creeping into engineering ethics
too. Some of these abuses, 131 in fact,
have been summarized in the first
draft of the committee's handbook of
which a few copies have been issued.
These are not hypothetical abuses;
they are actual problems and cases
taken from industry and from en-
gineering practice. Let me give you a
few instances.
Instances
For example, here is Problem 20
from the new handbook:
An engineer is minority stockholder
but president of a paper manufac-
turing company and completely dom-
inates its affairs. The paper company
buys all its power from a small utility
of which he is the principal owner.
The paper company pays him much
more for the power than a competing
utility would charge.
Problem 50. A company engages a
contractor for excavating and rock
removal. Two of the company's en-
gineers are friends of the contractor.
They "adjust" cost records of the
work to enable the contractor to col-
lect excessive fees. The problem
doesn't say so, but the engineers
doubtless got a handsome commis-
sion from the contractor.
Problem 74. The engineers of a
machinery building company turn
out designs which are unsafe in order
to reduce manufacturing costs and to
make it easier to get business.
Problem 113. An engineering firm
accepts bids for equipment in the
conventional manner, but awards the
sale to a favorite supplier by "devious
means," to quote from the firm's own
correspondence.
If only one committee in the whole
American engineering profession can
assemble 131 cases of dubious ethical
procedures, it does appear as if en-
gineering ethics is beginning to wob-
ble a little, even as the nation's
ethics have begun to wobble just a
little.
Why Raise the Issue?
You will ask, why bring up this
question at all?
I raise the issue because I am con-
vinced from personal experience—
and this is the key to the entire dis-
cussion—that we cannot keep our
American, our Western, personal lib-
erty unless we keep up our ethical
standards.
Winston Churchill has put this
much more eloquently than I ever
could. In his address at the Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology in
1949, he had this to say:
Our well-founded, slowly con-
ceived codes of honor, morals and
manners, the passsionate convic-
tions which so many hundreds of
millions share together, of the
principles of freedom and justice,
are far more precious to us than
anything which scientific discoveries
could bestow. . . . The flame of
Christian ethics is still our highest
guide. To guard and cherish it is
our first interest, spiritually and
materially. The fulfillment of spir-
itual duty in our daily lives is vital
to our survival.
Freedom of Choice
We have cars, comfortable homes,
refrigeration, vacations, and orange
juice for breakfast. We have the high-
est standard of living the world has
ever seen. But that is not, in my
opinion, the principal difference be-
tween the Communist bloc of nations
and ourselves. They are learning tech-
nology fast and may soon catch up
with us. I am convinced that the
really significant difference between
our kind of country and their kind
of country is that we have personal
freedom of choice, and they don't. We
have liberty and they are in harness.
We are free, and they are slaves.
If you arrive in Washington from
Detroit, you need not immediately go
to the nearest police station to report
that you have arrived. Neither do you
get a Detroit police permit for you to
go to Washington, after telling the
officer at the desk in great detail the
reasons why you want to go.
But there are countries where you
would have to do both. I have been
in some of them. One time in the
city of Multan it took me longer than
three hours to find the police officer
who was qualified to acknowledge our
arrival in the city.
You don't want to go to a police
sergeant for an OK to undertake a
research in heat transfer. You don't
want a government official to tell you
that a converter component will be
made of cast iron instead of a forg-
ing, as you had intended. You don't
want to get an official ticket which
tells you on what street you are going
to live, in which house, and when
you will move into it.
Let me give you a specific instance.
In the living room of our home we
have a framed photograph of a hand-
some young man, with sharp eyes,
dark skin and a black mustache. We
shall call him Chulam Shafiq. He is
brilliant, well educated, and has an
excellent family background. He has
never been in the United States but
he is much interested in American
history and affairs. He can quote the
Declaration of Independence. He
thought that all educated Americans
know the Federalist Papers by heart,
until I told him that there are many
educated Americans who have never
even heard about the Federalist
Papers.
This young man wanted badly to
be professor of international politics
in the University of the Punjab. He
would have been superb in the job,
but the government sent him to the
famous Police Academy at Sardah. He
is now assistant superintendent of
Police at Mirpurghas. It is a good
enough job, particularly because po-
lice officials in his country have the
status of a supreme court justice in
our states. But this is not what he
wanted to do. The trouble is that the
government runs both the University
of the Punjab and the police, and the
lad had nothing whatever to say
about his career.
Ethics and Freedom
If we lose our ethics we shall prob-
ably lose our freedom. In going
around, I have noted that those coun-
tries where the government decides
everything are likely to be the coun-
tries where corruption, dishonesty,
and exploitation are taken for grant-
ed.
Show me a country where the
citizen can't have a thought of his
own and I will show you a country
where you can't get a telephone into
your home without slipping the
equivalent of $25 or $50 to the right
man; where the contractor who builds
NOVEMBER 1964

your house bribes the architect or in-
spector so that he can cheat on speci-
fications; where the landlords and
creditors keep the mass of the popula-
tion desperately poor by taking most
of their earnings.
You can't substitute science and
engineering for rugged morality and
hope to come out. Hitler's Germany
was probably on top of the world's
technology twenty years ago, but his
cruel, immoral government has dis-
appeared from the face of the earth.
There is not much wrong with Soviet
science and engineering today, as we
have discovered to our embarrassment.
But we don't want any of the Russian
kind of ethics.
Neither will military power help
you if you have no moral strength.
The colonel in charge of Army
ROTC in the University of Detroit
came directly to the University from
a country in southeast Asia whose
name you hear every day. I have often
talked with him. I get the distinct
impression that the problem in that
country is that the people don't have
the will and the stamina to fight
Communists. All the weapons we give
them are of no use if they insist on
doing nothing except sit in the shade.
The unethical or immoral nations
have always come to grief. Czarist
Russia was no paragon of rectitude,
and the Bolsheviks took charge. Three
hundred years ago Spaniards op-
pressed their colonies, and the Span-
ish Empire fell apart. The Roman
people substituted pleasure for in-
tegrity and the Northern barbarians
swarmed all over Italy. And the
Israelites forgot the Commandments
of the Lord and the Babylonians con-
quered and enslaved them.
Conclusion
Let me remind you of the key to
this whole business: if our United
States is to survive, we Americans
must jealously guard our national
ethics.
I can paraphrase and say that if
our United States engineering pro-
fession is to survive, we American en-
gineers must jealously guard our pro-
fessional ethics.
If we fail to sustain our national
and professional ethics we may fol-
low after the Israelite nation, and
the Empires of Rome, Spain, and
Russia, and become nothing more
than a few notes in history.
Great evils befall the world when
the powerful begin to copy the weak.
The desperate devices which enable
the weak to survive are unequaled in-
struments of oppression and extermi-
nation in the hands of the strong.
—Eric Hoffer.
The time to guard against corrup-
tion and tyranny is before they have
gotten hold of us. It is better to keep
the wolf out of the fold than to trust
to drawing his teeth and talons after
he shall have entered.

We are never so ridiculous by the
qualities we have, as by those we
affect to have. —La Rochefoucauld.
Concentration is my motto—first
honesty, then industry, then concen-
tration. —Andrew Carnegie.
Why is it that so many of us persist
in thinking that autumn is a sad sea-
son? Nature has merely fallen asleep,
and her dreams must be beautiful, if
we are to judge by her countenance.
—Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
Truth and telling the truth are
about as much alike as moral philoso-
phy and personal memoirs. Moreover,
we often tell the truth as though that
were equivalent to doing something
about it. —Louis Kronenberger.
The great thing in the world is not
so much where we stand as in what
direction we are moving.
—Oliver Wendell Holmes.
He that leaveth nothing to chance
will do few things ill, but he will do
very few things.
—Charles Baudelaire.
We run carelessly to the precipice,
after we have put something before us
to prevent us from seeing it.
—Blaise Pascal.
Sincereity is the indispensable
ground of all conscientiousness, and

gion. —Immanuel Kant.
No truth so sublime but it may be
seen to be trivial tomorrow in the
light of new thoughts.
—Ralph Waldo Emerson.
A prudent man will think more im-
portant what fate has conceded to
him than what it has denied.
—Gracian.
By concentrating on precision, one
arrives at technique; but by concen-
trating on technique one does not ar-
rive at precision. Bruno Walter.
Life is not long, and too much of it
must not pass in idle deliberation how

A new idea is delicate. It can be
killed by a sneer or a yawn; it can be
stabbed to death by a quip and wor-
ried to death by a frown on the right
man's brow. —Charles Brower.
He is free who knows how to keep
in his own hand the power to decide,

ENGINEERS
NEVER

THE
CABOOSE
Sometimes an engineer can get so side-
tracked in the course of a project that he for-
gets where it was going in the first place.
This is calamitous. The engineer loses inter-
est, and the wheels start to slow down in a
dozen different places. □ Hamilton Standard
follows the project management concept,
which enables the engineer to keep sight of
the entire program, providing the "what and
when" direction, establishing and maintaining responsibility
for the "how" and excellence of work required to accomplish
the programs. Specifically, the engineer will have the oppor-
tunity to participate in and pursue a program from the begin-
ning to final production, including phases of Dl) Precontract
— prepare R&amp;D proposals, defining the tasks, technical as
well as costs and schedules. 2) Planning — developing com-
plete detailed plans covering each element of the contract.
3) Design &amp; Analysis — creating the hardware ideas — ap-
plying the state-of-the-art, and assuming responsibility for
the basic structure of the final product. 4) Development &amp;
Qualification — preparing development and qualification test
programs to determine and demonstrate product perform-
ance, conducting these tests, evaluating results, solving the
problem areas to assure complete product development and
technical integrity, serve as technical consultant to manu-
facturing and maintain customer coordination, analyzing
in-service or field product performance. □ Some of the
present projects involve space and life support systems, en-
vironmental conditioning systems, v/sfo/ pro-
pulsion systems, micro-electronics, ground
support equipment, turbine and rocket engine
controls, industrial valves, electron beam ma-
chines, air induction and special controls. □
Hamilton engineers are encouraged to
broaden their personal capabilities by taking
advantage of in-plant technical courses lec-
tures and seminars. Enrollment in useful short
courses at various colleges and universities is also author-
ized. Engineers may also qualify for the company's rotational
program. This provides opportunities for assignments in sev-
eral departments to broaden the individual's knowledge of the
company's scope of operations. □ In summary: an engi-
neer's future with Hamilton Standard is limited only by his
ability and desire to make a contribution to the team effort
— and his capacity to shoulder responsibility. He's got a
wide-open track to personal progress.DWe invite you to climb

(Continued from page 24)
Instead of offering studies in moral
philosophy we offer courses in "social
adjustment," "how to develop your
personality," and the like. Here is one
example of group thearapy.
"Superintendent Gerald Smith has
talked of introducing the "Fourth R,
Responsibility,' but this seems largely
another way of describing the established
policy. The disciplinary vehicle, Smith
explains, is the group. The teacher strives
not to discipline the child directly, but
to influence all the children's attitudes so
that as a group they recognize correct be-
haviour. If a child falls out of line, he
does not have to be subjected to authori-
tarian strictures of elders; he senses the
disapproval of the group, and, in that
way, the school believes, learns to dis-
cipline himself as much as possible.
"The child who tends to be withdrawn
is given special attention. 'Johnny wasn't
doing so well at school,' one mother told
me. 'The teacher explained to me that
he was doing fine on his lessons but that
his social adjustment was not as good
as it might be. He would pick just one or
two friends to play with, and sometimes
he was happy to be by himself." There are
many such instances, and, save for a few
odd parents, most are grateful that the
schools work so hard to offset tendencies
to inversion and other suburban abnor-
malities." 11
Of the purpose of high school edu-
cation, many educators wrote,
"The primary job of the high school
. . . should be to teach students how to
be citizens and how to get along with
other people." 12
Another educator feels that,
"The schools must assume more respon-
sibility for the total growth of the child
.... through such media as family group
living (twelfth-grade elective) .... 'Ours
is the age of group action.' " 13
The pragmatic viewpoint of many
educators, and certainly of industry,
places more value on vocational train-
ing and less on the "intellectual sub-
jects" than in the past. Certainly these
matters concern engineering schools.
One educator states that,
"What he fears is that the humanists
will successfully infiltrate the engineering
schools and insinuate their message in
these last fortresses of practicality. 'In
these trying times,' he complains, 'the
humanists among our educators seem to
intensify their efforts to crowd their ele-
gancies into technical schools, at the ex-
pense, probably, of professional subjects
crowded out of the curriculum, so that
engineers are graduated with watered-
down training.' He flatly recommends
that technical schools make any courses
in the humanities optional." 14
Another educator queries,
"Except for a small coterie ... of
what value to most people are the tra-
ditional academic disciplines? "The so-
called bright student is often one of the
dumbest or least apt when he gets away
from his textbooks and memory work.
. . . This is evidenced by the fact that
many $20,000 to 5100,000 a year jobs . . .
are held by persons with IQ's of less than
ninety." 15
A good appraisal of this pragmatic-
social adjustment philosophy is pro-
vided by Whyte.
"To teach technique before content,
the skills of getting along isolated from
why and to what end the getting along
is for, does not produce maturity. It pro-
duces a sort of permanent prematurity,
and this is true not only of the child
being taught life adjustment but of the
organization man being taught well-
roundedness. This is a sterile concept;
and those who believe that they have
mastered human relations can blind them-
selves to the true bases of co-operation.
People don't co-operate just to co-operate;
they co-operate for substantive reasons, to
achieve certain goals, and unless these
are comprehended the little manipula-
tions for morale, team spirit, and such are
fruitless.
"And they can be worse than fruitless.
Held up as the end-all of organization
leadership, the skills of human relations
easily tempt the new administrator into
the practice of a tyranny more subtle and
more pervasive than that which he means
to supplant. No one wants to see the old
authoritarian return, but at least it could
be said of him that what he wanted pri-
marily from you was your sweat. The
new man wants your soul." 10
Patriotism
Hersey's Hiroshima formed two
impressions in my mind. The first,
quite obviously, is the desirability of
refraining from wholesale slaughter
of other living creatures. The second
was the nature of patriotism. Hersey
reports the attitude of the dying vic-
tims towards their evident misfortune.
A son to his father: "Father, we
can do nothing except make our
mind up to consecrate our lives for
the country. Let us give Banzai to our
Emperor." 17
Another, "But now I have gutted
my mind to dedicate what 1 have and
to complete the war for our country's
sake." 18
There is little sense of having been
unjustly treated, no cry of indigna-
tion, no questioning the desirability
of the war with its obvious results-
only allegiance to the Emperor and
the dumb assurance that their deaths
were for the sake of the Emperor and
their Japan.
In 1961, "Controversy" printed C.
P. Snow's "The Moral Un-Neutrality
of Science." An excerpt—
"Soldiers have to obey. That is the
foundation of their morality. It is not
the foundation of the scientific morality.
Scientists have to question and if nec-
essary to rebel. I don't want to be misun-
derstood. I am no anarchist. I am not
suggesting that loyalty is not a prime
virtue. I am not saying that all rebellion
is good. But I am saying that loyalty can
easily be turned into conformity, and that
conformity can often be a cloak for the
timid and self-seeking. So can obedience,
carried to the limit. When you think of
the long and gloomy history of man, you
will find more, and far more hideous
crimes have been committed in the name
of obedience than have ever been com-
mitted in the name of rebellion. If you
doubt that read William Shircr's Rise and
Fall of the Third Reich. The German
officer corps were brought up in the most
rigorous code of obedience. To them-
selves, no more honorable and Godfearing
body of men could conceivably exist. Yet
in the name of obedience, they were
party to, and assisted in, the most wicked
large-scale actions in the history of the
world." 18
Patriotism, then, is another tool
(made and directed by man to serve
as a means to an end) which is used
to convince or coerce the individual
into believing that he should subvert
his conscience to the "welfare of the
state." It was an effective tool for Ger-
mans and for the Japanese. What
about the American engineer?
"Preposterous!" you protest. You
resent the comparison. "Our efforts
are defensive, theirs were offensive."
Well, let us leave that for another
time. It is not relevant to my purpose.
Remember, it is not the actions of
the Germans which concern us here,
but the temper, the state of mind and
conscience of the actors. What is the
temper of the engineer? Are their ac-
tions ones of reasoned commitment—
or of conformity, unthinking obedi-
ence, and economic prostitution?
The Temper of the Engineer
Charges have been leveled.
Of the technical society one author
states: "Its members are given to
passive acquiescence rather than to
any form of activity or choice that
might call attention to them." 20
Bertrand Russell:

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


engineers] are recognized by all civilized
governments as the most useful citizens,
provided they can be trained and in-
duced to place their services at the dis-
posal of a single government rather than
of mankind. . . .
"Politicians in our day are far more
influential than they were at any former
period in human history. Their relation
to the men of science [and engineering]
is like that of a magician in the Arabian
Nights to a djinn who obeys his orders.
The djinn does astounding things which
the magician, without his help, could not
do but he does them only because he is
told to do them, not because of any im-
pulse in himself." 21
Will these charges be answered?
Can they be?
What must be done? The answer, I
feel, lies in education. At present we
place more emphasis upon the train-
ing of competent technicians than
upon the making of men. That is an
attitude markedly disrespectful of the
worth of the human individual. Ad-
mittedly, a technician with a moral
sensitivity is a more difficult creature
for a politician to manipulate, but
what of it?
Must the engineer be kept at the
moral level of a television western
show, so that the instruments he is
set to work upon assume as little
moral meaning as the insensible shoot-
ings of the cowboy hero? Is it so nec-
essary to our national security to
maintain "mind-forged manacles"22
to prevent the engineer from realiz-
ing that "it is not for its skill in hom-
icide that the human race deserves
respect.""? Must we continue to be
so callous that we feel less remorse at
the slaying of human life than a poet
like Wordsworth experienced upon
killing a bird?
"The power of science for good and
evil has troubled other minds than ours.
We are not here fumbling with a new
dilemma. . . . Men have been killed with
weapons before now; what happened at
Nagasaki was only more massive. . . .
Nothing happened in 1945 except that we
changed the scale of our indifference to
man: and conscience, in revenge, for an
instant became immediate to us." 24
We must be concerned first with
the development of the human being
before we develop technical compe-
tence. Philosophy, poetry, history, and
political science should not be fringe
benefits to the engineering student;
they are essential, for himself and for
society. What is required is not the
usual handful of "liberal electives" so
graciously included in engineering
curricula. That is not enough. It is
questionable whether anything short
of an entire liberal arts undergraduate
program will be sufficient.
For the engineer to assume per-
sonal responsibility he must learn
that,
"no man is wholly free, and no man is
wholly a slave. To the extent to which
a man has freedom, he needs a personal
morality to guide his conduct. There are
some who say that a man need only obey
the accepted moral code of his commu-
nity. But I do not think any student of
anthropology could be content with this
answer. Such practices as cannibalism,
human sacrifice, and head hunting have
died out as a result of moral protests
against conventional desires to live the
best life that is open to him, he must
learn to be critical of the tribal customs
and tribal beliefs that are generally ac-
cepted among his neighbours." 25
The development of a personal mor-
ality with a meaningful perspective
is a rather difficult undertaking with-
out the aid of a liberal education.
We must come to appreciate the
dignity accorded the human individ-
ual by Thoreau.
"If the injustice is part of the neces-
sary friction of the machine of govern-
ment, let it go; perchance it will wear
smooth. . . . But if it is of such a nature
that it require you to be the agent of
injustice to another, then, I say, break
the law." 26
Earlier, we took a brief look at
some important excerpts from the
Canon of Ethics for Engineers. Please
reread them.
Now really, gentlemen.
My Request
What, then, do I desire of the
engineer? Is this essay an obstinate
request that his present work cease?
I believe I have made it clear that it
is not his work, but his state of mind
that disturbs me.
My request is this:
Let us be truly courageous. Com-
mit yourself, Mr. Engineer, to the
national principles which your work
is intended to protect. But be aware
of what it is you are about, what it is
you are building. And should the in-
strument of your creation be used, be
prepared to accept the responsibility
which is your due. Assume the awful
weight of "those moral burdens which
men in less enlightened days used to
carry with such labour and anguish."27
That is all I ask, nothing more.

CANON OF ETHICS FOR ENGINEERS
Foreword: Honesty, justice, and courtesy form a moral philosophy
which, associated with mutual interest among men, constitute the foun-
dation of ethics. The engineer should recognize such a standard, not in
passive observance, but as a set of dynamic principles guiding his conduct
and way of life. It is his duty to practice his profession according to these
Canons of Ethics.
As the keystone of professional conduct and integrity, the engineer
will discharge his duties with fidelity to the public, his employers, and
clients, and with fairness and impartiality to all. It is his duty to inter-
est himself in public welfare, and to be ready to apply his special knowl-
edge for the benefit of mankind. He should uphold the honor and dignity
of his profession and also avoid association with any enterprise of ques-
tionable character. In his dealings with fellow engineers he should be
fair and tolerant.
Sec. 4. He will have due regard for the safety of life and health
of the public and employees who may be affected by the work for which
he is responsible.
Sec. 28. He will not become associated in responsibility for work
with engineers who do not conform to ethical practices.

neers and research personnel, working for one of America's
largest industrial companies operating 74 plants at home and
abroad. You'll join a company that makes 33,000 products.
Less than half of our business is in tires, and U.S. is one of
the nation's largest producers of textiles and chemicals. You'll
join a Company that, more than 100 years ago, made the first
manufactured vulcanized rubber product and where, today,
we contribute our resources and skills to atomic research,

THE MICHIGAN Tl


Sophisticated engineers can rise rapidly here
Ed, Bob, and Hipparchus (their true identities hidden here
against pitiless kidding by all-too-real colleagues) are three
Kodak mechanical engineers on their way to a management
meeting for the up-and-coming. Let us consider differences
rather than similarities.
Ed works on those inexpensive, sure-fire cameras that
Americans as well as citizens of the rest of the civilized world
think of when "Kodak" is mentioned. The big boss who
chose Ed for his department says: "Along with Ph.D.s in
solid-state physics, I look for B.S. and M.S. mechanical
engineers from whom I can expect the unexpected. The spots
for sophisticated engineering don't always have a sign over
the door that says 'SOPHISTICATED.' Who would ever
have dreamed ten years ago that low-price zoom lenses and
automatic exposure-setters and through-the-lens finders
could deliver the performance they do today? The doozers
we have ready to unveil next year and the year after that
are well in hand, fortunately. Then what?" Then what is
Ed's responsibility. He will need help from fellows now in
college. Maybe you.
Bob works on data-recording and information-retrieval
photographic systems. His work has to impress cost-minded
brother engineers in other companies as well as banks and
other hard-nosed commercial customers. He meets the
requirements of a boss who says: "The type I need was
called an 'inventor' a generation ago. The difference is that
in 1965 he will need a lot more mathematics, engineering
physics, chemistry, hydraulics, electronics, and other book-
learning than an inventor needed in 1925. When it comes
time to relax, though, you'll find him building something
with his hands, and it's probably something pretty clever
and unusual that works real well." As it happens, Bob's
main hobby is neither bridge nor folk singing.
Old Hip calls square dances and doesn't care who knows.
Policy proscribes discussion of the nature but not of the
philosophy of his engineering. His boss puts it: "In con-
sumer and commercial products, where regular service can
easily be part of the engineering plan, perfection would
carry a price tag that made no sense. With us, a perfect
score is the only acceptable goal. Nothing less makes eco-
nomic sense. Before our guys can think of what is sensible,
they have to think of what is possible. It can be very enjoy-
able for the right type of smart apple."
Drop us a line if you can see yourself as any of these three
right types, whether in mechanical engineering, chemical
engineering, electronic engineering, chemistry, or physics.

Advancement in a Big Company:
How it Works
An Interview with General Electric's C. K. Rieger, Vice President and Group Executive, Electric Utility Group
C. K. Rieger
■ Charles K. Rieger joined General Elec-
tric's Technical Marketing Program after
earning a BSEE at the University of Mis-
souri in 1936. Following sales engineering
assignments in motor, defense and home
laundry operations, he became manager of
the Heating Device and Fan Division in
1947. Other Consumer-industry management
positions followed. In 1953 he was elected
a vice president, one of the youngest men
ever named a Company officer. Mr. Rieger
became Vice President, Marketing Services
in 1959 and was appointed to his present
position in 1961. He is responsible for all
the operations of some six divisions com-
posed of 23 product operations oriented
primarily toward the Electric Utility market.
Q. How can I be sure of getting the
recognition I feel I'm capable of earn-
ing in a big company like G.E.?
A. We learned long ago we couldn't
afford to let capable people get lost.
That was one of the reasons why G.E.
was decentralized into more than a
hundred autonomous operating de-
partments. These operations develop,
engineer, manufacture and market
products much as if they were inde-
pendent companies. Since each de-
partment is responsible for its own
success, each man's share of author-
ity and responsibility is pinpointed.
Believe me, outstanding performance
is recognized, and rewarded.
Q. Can you tell me what the "promo-
tional ladder" is at General Electric?
A. We regard each man individually.
Whether you join us on a training
program or are placed in a specific
position opening, you'll first have to
prove your ability to handle a job.
Once you've done that, you'll be given
more responsibility, more difficult
projects—work that's important to
the success of your organization and
your personal development. Your abil-
ity will create a "promotional ladder"
of your own.
Q. Will my development be confined
to whatever department I start in?
A. Not at all! Here's where "big com-
pany" scope works to broaden your
career outlook. Industry, and General
Electric particularly, is constantly
changing — adapting to market the
fruits of research, reorganizing to
maintain proper alignment with our
customers, creating new operations
to handle large projects. All this rep-
resents opportunity beyond the limits
of any single department.
Q. Yes, but just how often do these
opportunities arise?
A. To give you some idea, 25 percent
of G-E's gross sales last year came
from products that were unknown
only five or ten years ago. These new
products range from electric tooth
brushes and silicone rubber com-
pounds to atomic reactors and inter-
planetary space probes. This chang-
ing Company needs men with ambi-
tion and energy and talent who aren't
afraid of a big job—who welcome the
challenge of helping to start new
businesses like these. Demonstrate
your ability—whether to handle com-
plex technical problems or to manage
people, and you won't have long to
wait for opportunities to fit your
needs.
Q. How does General Electric help
me prepare myself for advancement
opportunity?
A. Programs in Engineering, Manu-
facturing or Technical Marketing give
you valuable on-the-job training. We
have Company-conducted courses to
improve your professional ability no
matter where you begin. Under Tui-
tion Refund or Advanced Degree Pro-
grams you can continue your formal
education. Throughout your career
with General Electric you'll receive
frequent appraisals to help your self-
development. Your advancement will
be largely up to you.

FORD MOTOR COMPANY'S EXPERIMENTAL GAS TURBINE SUPERHIGHWAY TRUCK
ANTICIPATES THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY NETWORK OF THE 1970's.
A new era in trucking is almost here. When the 41,000-mile national highway network is completed it will be
possible for the first time to schedule coast to coast, big payload hauling. Ford Motor Company's answer to
the challenge is this experimental tractor-trailer combination. A tandem axle drive tractor, powered by
a 600 hp gas turbine engine permits a cruising speed of 70 miles per hour, a non-stop range of 600 miles.
Designed for long-distance, non-stop operation, the two-man cab includes sleeping facilities, fold-away table,
lavatory, toilet, oven, refrigerator and TV for the co-driver—with over 6'3" of headroom. Because of its
cruising speed, the truck will be compatible with the normal passenger car flowrate of traffic.
Other unique features are its odorless exhaust and extremely quiet operation.
Anticipating the opportunities and needs of the future is standard practice at Ford Motor Company.
That's why it's such an exciting place to work. Look to Ford Motor Company for a career with growth potential
and satisfaction—from pure science to manufacturing . . . marketing to labor relations.

Could a U.S. firm that helped
save a cotton crop abroad
also have a hand in keeping
Jayne Tippman's skin soft?
You'd expect that a U.S. company engaged in mining,
production and marketing in over a hundred countries
might have an impact on many national economies. And
you'd be right. For instance, with an insecticide sold un-
der the trade mark "Sevin," this company was largely
responsible for saving a middle east cotton crop.
And when a leading chemical manufacturer's prod-
ucts include silicones, which have a soothing and pro-
tective effect on skin, they're bound to turn up in skin
lotions, creams, and emollients. Jayne Tippman uses them
to keep a glowing complexion that weather can't beat.
Cotton fields and skin lotions are unlikely
markets for one company's products. Unless
that company is Union Carbide.
But then, Union Carbide also makes half a
dozen major plastics, along with plastic bottles and
packaging films. And it's one of the world's most diver-
sified private enterprises in the field of atomic energy.
Among its consumer products are "Eveready" batteries
and "Prestone" anti-freeze. Its carbon products include
the largest graphite cylinders ever formed, for possible
use in solid-fuel rockets. Its gases, liquefied through
cryogenics—the science of supercold—include liquid
oxygen and hydrogen that will be used to propel the
space ships designed to reach the moon.
In fact, few other corporations are so deeply in-
volved in so many different skills and activities
that will affect the technical and production
capabilities of our next century.
It's a future that glows like Jayne Tippman.

DEGENERATION
The University of Michigan has a tradition of excellence
which is being plowed under in prefence to construction of
an enormous education factory. A course has been charted
by the Regents and Administration toward development
within the next ten years of a university with 40,000 to
50,000 students. Rather than an integrated campus, "Michi-
gan 1970" promises to be a colletion of several individual
campuses oriented toward one or a few of the seventeen
colleges. In addition, an "exciting residential college" is
planned which will integrate living and learning facilities in
a comparatively small unit. This plan for the physical en-
vironment should serve wonderfully to isolate each discipline
group from the others so that any identification which stu-
dents now have with the University should be totally non-
existent.
Besides these drastic physical changes which shall take
place if the present plan is realized, the composition and
attendant attitude of the student body shall be greatly altered.
The primary reason is that not only is the total enrollment
increasing, but also the percentage which is graduate students
is increasing. Those graduates who are not merely draft-
dodgers are focusing their energies on one project, earning
an advanced degree. Their general lack of interest in any-
thing external to this is a wet blanket on undergraduate en-
thusiasm, in and out of the classroom.
In addition, with the population expansion causing increas-
ing competition for the available undergraduate positions,
admission will be granted more frequently to the "serious
students." This individual who is probably just as self-centered
and studious as the graduate is also probably most influenced
by the misinformed high school student counselors who ran-
domly peddle intellectualism as the only worthwhile college
goal.
The implication of all this is that much of the zest now
present at Michigan will be lost—much has been lost already.
New buildings will ease the present overcrowding. Teaching
machines, independent study and television may ease the
problem of lack of good instructors (for there are many per-
6
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


sons whose teaching serves only to increase entropy in the
classroom). But nothing can force students to look outward
from behind their books or bottles. Nothing can force student
support or participation in activities outside the classroom
which can add spice to their insipid educational meal. And the
students of "Michgan 1970" will have neither the initiative
nor desire to step forth and participate.
There should be more to a university and a college experi-
ence than just books and musty libraries. Books do not contain
everything which is worthwhile to learn. An appreciation of
human interaction with its subsequent greater understanding
can only be learned by personal experience with others of
differing interests. The knowledge which one comes to
a university to grasp is most) useful when it is coupled with
this understanding. "Michigan 1970" will provide neither the
physical environment nor the atmosphere conducive to the
realization of this total university experience.
DNH
FINIS
The last period of the last editorial has been placed. The
editor heaves a sigh of relief—he certainly found quickly that
he was no literary giant, or even dwarf.
The books will soon be closed. The business manager, too,
heaves a sigh of relief—he found how difficult breaking even
is without subsidies.
The tasks of other seniors are completed. All now stand
back to permit the younger staff members to assume their new
positions and responsibilities.
To the new staff: Think of the many ideas which have yet
to be implemented. Think of the goals as yet unattained. Pay
attention to details. Look ahead with optimism. Good luck—
and thanks!!

Since the first gas maser was built in
1955, masers and lasers have probably
become the most discussed scientific topic
next to the space industry. The Univer-
sity of Michigan has been a pioneer in
maser-laser research. Professor Chihiro
Kiwuchi of Michigan built the first solid
state maser in 1957. He later gave a ruby
crystal to C. H. Townes of Hell Labora-
tories to use in his work, and Mr. Townes
went on to win the Xobel Prize for
Physics this year. What are masers and
lasers and who has done the basic re-
search on them? For the fundamental defi-
nitions and a brief history of lasers,
read on.
The maser is an apparatus devel-
oped in recent years tor generating
coherent electromagnetic waves. The
name maser represents the words
"microwave amplification by the stim-
ulated emission of radiation." Maser
electromagnetic waves typically have
a wavelength of about three centi-
by Mel Stewart meters. Optical masers are those which
generate electromagnetic waves in die
visible spectra, about 6x10-'' centi-
meters in wavelength. Masers operat-
ing in this region are popularly called
lasers, the word "light" substituted
for the word "microwave." Lasers
have more energy and power than the
masers of higher wavelength. Coher-
ence in a light beam means it has very
little divergence. Laser beams having
a width of only ten miles have been
flashed on the moon. Laser beams
have been produced with wavelengths
as small as 5900 A. (5.9 x 10-"- centi-
meters) and with wavelengths as large
as 350,000 A. (3.5 x 10-3 centimeters),
high in the infra-red range. Although
a laser has an energy output of only
one percent of that put into it, it
can store and release that energy in
a very short pulse. High power peaks
are thus reached. Laser beams of fifty
million watts power have been gen-
erated. The first lasers were capable
of burning through steel the thickness
of only a few razor blades, and were
calibrated in "gillettes." Now lasers
burn through steel beams an eighth of
an inch thick.
Laser beams have several important
practical applications due to their
properties of coherence and high pow-
er. They are used in spectrographic
analysis to vaporize a minute portion
of the substance in question. This
eliminates changing the structure of
the substance by removing a portion
of it and destroying that portion with
an electric arc. Laser beams have been
used to repeat the Michelson-Morley
experiment. The results attained were
much more accurate than any pre-
vious. It was this experiment that dis-
proved the theory that light travels
through a medium called ether and
was important in the formulation of
Einstein's Theory of Relativity.
In medicine, lasers are used to weld
the retina of the eye. By the alterna-
tive method, using a xenon lamp, the
operation takes over a full second
and necessitates immobilization of the
eye. With a laser, the operation takes
one thousandth of a second and does
not require immobilization. There is
promise that lasers will be used for
other types of surgery in the future.
When lasers were first publicized,
there was speculation that they could
be developed into the "death ray" so
popular in science fiction. Doctor
Robert Terhune, formerly of the
University of Michigan and now of
the Ford Motor Company, demon-
strated that this would not be possible
in the earth's atmosphere. A beam
DECEMBER 1964


strong enough to be used for military
purposes would lose most of its
strength decomposing the air through
which it was passing. There is a possi-
bility that a laser could be used mili-
tarily in space, but the size of the
apparatus necessary to produce such
a beam would make it highly imprac-
tical. Laser beams are capable of car-
rying an immense number of radio
waves simultaneously. If we had the
technical ability, we could transmit
all the nation's military and civilian
television and radio communications
over one laser beam. With our current
technology, we can conceivably trans-
mit all the nation's television com-
munications on one beam. Perhaps in
the future there will be transconti-
nental pipes carrying laser beams.
The maser's history began when J.
Weber of The University of Maryland
proposed the principle in 1952. A gas
maser was built in 1955 by C. H.
Townes, of Bell Laboratories. In 1956,
Bloembergen, of the Cruft Labora-
tory, Harvard University, first suggest-
ed a solid state maser. In 1957, Pro-
fessor Chihiro Kikuchi, of the Univer-
sity of Michigan North Campus Nu-
clear Engineering Laboratory, con-
ceived and produced the first solid
state maser. He used a synthetic ruby.
In 1958, Townes and A. L. Shawlow,
also of Bell, proposed an extension of
maser principles into the visible light
spectrum. In 1960 T. H. Maiman, of
Hughes Aircraft, built the first laser.
He also used a synthetic ruby. In
1961, A. Javan, W. R. Bennett Jr.,
and D. R. Herriot, of Bell Labora-
tories, built the first gas laser. Also
in 1961, a University of Michigan
team of M. Bass, P. A. Franken, A. E.
Hill, C. W. Peters, and G. Weinreich
were able to demonstrate for the first
time a harmonic effect in light with
a laser beam.
Professor Kikuchi first began work
on his maser in January of 1957. He
quickly formulated his plans on how
to make a ruby maser. He was great-
ly hindered in his subsequent produc-
tion of the maser by a lack of re-
search funds. He had neither quali-
fied research assistants nor enough
equipment for his work. Towards the
end of his work he was assisted by
Don Gillespie and Lloyd Cross, and
at the very end by other University
professors. He finished the first solid
state maser in December of 1957,
eleven months after knowing how he
was going to do it. After Professor
Kikuchi pioneered in the field of
solid state masers, a lack of research
funds prevented him from continu-
ing to dominate maser research. Other
universities and private corporations
took over and did extensive work in
the development of later masers and
lasers.
The maser principle is to generate
light waves, reinforce them as they
form a standing wave pattern inside
the apparatus, and then release the
wave in a short, powerful, coherent
pulse. This is done by supplying ener-
gy to the proper maser material. The
material has mirror surfaces at oppo-
site ends, which are a definite distance
apart. The correct material for a solid
state maser is a crystal doped with a
positive ion. The most common solid
state maser is synthetic ruby, which
consists of aluminum oxide (A1203)
doped with chromium ions (Cr ±s).
Neon is the most common constitu-
ent of gas masers. The maser is acti-
vated by energy from a light coil
wound around it. The light energy
raises electrons in the maser material
to higher energy levels. Returning to
the ground state, the electrons often
pause at a definite energy level. While
they are at that level, the electrons
are in the metastable state. Some elec-
trons do not go into the metastable
state at all, but many do and remain
there long enough that there is sig-
nificance in their position there.
As electrons go from the metastable
state to the ground state they emit
photons of a characteristic wave-
length. The first formed photons
collide with electrons in the metast-
able state and force them to the
ground level. The photons produced
by this fall in phase with the trigger-
ing photons. This most important
property is the result of the trigger-
ing photon forcing the electron to
vibrate in phase with it. The photons
reflect off the mirror surfaces and
form a standing wave. This standing
wave builds up until it has enough
energy to simultaneously force most
of the electrons from the metastable
to the ground state. When the elec-
trons are forced into the ground state,
they give off their energy in 4 x 10-9
seconds. When they fall spontaneous-
ly, they give off their energy in
4 x lO-4 seconds. Since power is ener-
gy change per unit time, the power
emitted by the forced elctron is 105,
or one hundred thousand, times as
great as the power emitted by the
spontaneously falling electron. Many
electrons release their energy simul-
taneously forming a high power, co-
herent laser beam which is easily
strong enough to pass through the
end of the maser.
The University of Michigan group's
work in harmonics consisted of using
laser light to produce the first non-
trivial harmonic effects in light waves.
Harmonics in sound waves is wit-
nessed when a piano key is struck
hard. There is a trace of a sound
wave of twice the frequency of the
fundamental wave. Harmonics is
achieved by using energy of high in-
tensity. Before the advent of the laser,
it was not possible to produce light
of great enough intensity to display
harmonic effects. In light harmonics,
the light beam is directed at a crystal
which has a non-linear structure.
Light emerges with the fundamental
wavelength, and due to interactions
with atoms, some emerges at twice the
frequency. The polarization, P, of the
fundamental frequency is propor-
tional to the energy, E.
P = xE
x is the factor of electric susceptibility
depending upon the electric condi-
tions of the crystal used. When the
energy becomes high enough, this
equation is not satisfactory and we
must use the non-linear equation
p = xE (1 + E/a, + EJ/a2 -f E'/a,
-j- E4/a4) where a„ is the dielectric
constant of the nth harmonic. The
polarization becomes non-linear, or
harmonic, as the energy intensity in-
creases. The University of Michigan
group used quartz as its crystal, light
of wavelength 6942 A., deep red, and
obtained a first harmonic of 3472 A.,
which is deep blue.

Asst. Prof, of Management
University of Southern California
The author takes a different approach
to an old problem—the high incidence
of early job turnover among college grad-
uates. He discusses new dimensions of the
situation and then offers some tentative
actions that might be useful in an event-
ual solution.
It has become increasingly recog-
nized that the first year on the job
for college graduates is often a dis-
couraging, cold-shower introduction
to the "real world." It has become
increasingly accepted that this shock
is necessary and unadvoidable, even
if one of its not-so-hidden costs is a
high level of early turnover. Busi-
nessmen seem to chalk it up to the
undergraduate's immaturity and,
while attempting to do their best by
their recent hires, they seem also to
shruggingly tolerate the situation,
since there appears to be nothing to
be done that would help—except wait
until young men get a little older.
The difficulty in dealing with this
problem may be the result of a de-
sire to achieve the solution (prefer-
ably a simple one) and a reluctance
to conceive of the problem as ad-
mittedly complex, but nonetheless un-
derstandable. The author's view is
that some distance remains to be
covered before the complexity of the
problem itself will be grasped but
that "solution" will come with com-
prehension of the problem.
This article offers a somewhat
different and specific, yet partial,
description of die problem and then
suggests some tentative actions that
might be useful. The major pur-
pose, however, is to attempt a clari-
fication of the problem. Any action
response that may make sense is best
designed by the businessman who is
better acquainted with his particular
company situation. Nevertheless much
of the eventual solution revolves
around a better understanding of the
area, in and of itself.
The focus will be upon under-
graduates, especially those who have
majored in business administration;
yet, much of what will be discussed
applies also to liberal arts and en-
gineering graduates. In addition,
emphasis will be placed upon the
point of view of the recent graduate,

that of his boss or of his professors,
but simply because it is precisely the
graduate's point of view which is
hardest for employers and faculty
to understand — and for him to
recognize explicitly.
The average college graduate rents
a cap and gown, marches in proces-
sion with his peers, shakes the hand
of the college president, reaches for
his diploma, and ends in a burst of
ceremony the continuous academic
preparation for life that has occupied
him for 16 of his 21 years. Some
welcoming-handshakes later, he sits
at a desk, along with 30 other people,
learning to check vouchers for errors.
The real world hits him hard, and
his dreams of youthful unreality are
painfully reappraised. A few months
later he begins to suspect that his
"dreams were all right, it's this job
which is wrong," or he finds he has
behaved badly in adjusting and fears
his reputation is hopelessly infantile.
He begins to toy with the idea of
leaving for greener pastures. And,
in time, he frequently does just that
—"a sadder but wiser" young man.
Exactly what is it that hits the
recent college graduate so hard? Let's
look at his experience prior to grad-
uation and compare it to his initial
experience at work. It is well rec-
ognized that the difference between
the two is great, but focusing atten-
tion on the specific components of the
difference is illuminating in seeing
more clearly some of the many
dimensions of the total situation.
A major difficulty for the recent
graduate is his unrecognized but im-
portant assumption about time. For
most of his life, his activities have
been arranged so that they culminate
within relatively short time spans.
As he passed from grammar school
through high school and into col-
lege, he found that the amount of
time devoted to a unit of work grad-
ually decreased. In grammar school
each course was studied for one aca-
demic year. In high school some
courses were introduced that occupied
only one semester of time. Then in
college virtually all of the courses
taken were only one semester long.
The trend is clear—from longer to
shorter spans of time devoted to each
unit of study. In no event was any
work scheduled that exceeded one
year. Furthermore, his most recent
experience in college (four years or
eight semesters) emphasized units of
about five months each.
The repetition of this pattern over
four years in college seems to have
influenced undergraduates uncon-
sciously to expect this frequency of
completion. The rhythm of their re-
sponse to semester cycles is well
developed in them by graduation.
Yet, it is clear that the work to
be done in a business is not scheduled
so that the recent graduate completes
his entire job every five months and
then goes on to a different job. Much
of the work is really never ending;
some of it is "finished" (special proj-
ects) in less than a year but even
these projects are irregularly sched-
uled and usually are combined with
longer-term work when assigned to
recent graduates.
Most graduates have been pro-
moted every year for 16 years. With-
out being aware of it, they have come
to expect promotion to a higher grade
each year if their work is anything
better than dreadful.
The contrast with business is pain-
fully clear. Changes in rank within
the business are hardly arranged so
as to occur yearly, and promotions
are generally conceded to result more
often from outstanding performance
than from merely acceptable perform-
ance. While this point may seem
obvious, it is doubtful that under-
graduates are explicitly aware of what
it will mean to them to be in a
situation where promotions occur
irregularly, after varying lengths of
time, and where the criterion for
such advancement is performing con-
siderably better dian one's peers.
So, four somewhat different dimen-
sions of time affect the recent gradu-
ate:
• From regular change to irreg-
ular change.
• From five-month time spans for
work to longer time spans.
• From frequent completion to
occasional completion of units of
work.
• From yearly promotion to un-
scheduled promotion.
The young man not only finds that
his conditioned assumptions about
time are of little use to him in busi-
ness, but he seldom seems to be able
to identify this facet of his difficulty.
In addition, he hears older men refer
to the future in ways that simply do
not have much meaning to him. For
example, a frequent question put to
college seniors by recruiters is, "Where
do you want to be five years from
now?" This is asking a man of 21
to project far into his uncertainty.
He has great difficulty seeing much
beyond the next year. His entire
experience has made yearly units
meaningful and seldom has there
been much reason for him to worry
about anything more than a year
away.
Consequently, when he is told
that "after a few years seasoning" he
will be able to take on some real
responsibilities, he cannot grasp the
projected time in any meaningful
way and consequently feels it is un-
reasonably long. If he is experienc-
ing any disappointment on the job
at the time such a statement is made,
he not only feels his past and present
deprivation, but extrapolates it into
the future, into what for him is so
far away as to be unknown.
Anxiety in the face of the unknown
is a common human reaction, but
the recent graduate may well express
it in ways more experienced men
might consider immature impatience,
especially when it leads the young
man to seek what he thinks will be
greener pastures elsewhere. Attempt-
ing to inculcate patience by talking
to young men about their prospects
for a lifetime career with a company
seems futile, for they can hardly
conceive of the time dimensions of
their first job. And perhaps most
importantly, they do not recognize
that they are more likely to behave
inappropriately because they do not
see clearly themselves, their assump-
tions, and their limitations. It may
not be completely presumptuous to
suggest that their immediate superiors
are also without this awareness of the
meaning of time to recent graduates.
From such mutual unawareness stems
some of the problem.
Speaking of Bosses, the student in
college does not have one. He si-
multaneously has four or five every
semester and as many as 10 different
men a year. It is common practice
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


to "work for" by arranging his class
schedule so that certain professors
are eliminated. As a result, he grows
used to the idea that to some extent
he selects his superiors and that no
one of them has sufficient power to
remove him from school. The dif-
ference from business is again ob-
vious. The recent graduate finds on
his first job that his supervisor is one
man, unadvoidable. He feels he has
all his eggs in one basket, and that
his boss is carrying it.
In addition, as a student, he en-
counters very different men who ask
him to perform in very different ways
during the same semester. Perhaps
this is why students tend to attribute
to the professor everything they think
is wrong or right with a class. Almost
every student seems convinced that
one of his current professors is either
incompetent, insane, or a bore. The
point is that students tend to focus
their feelings about a course on the
professor. They do not seem to be
able to see the influence of the nature
of the organization or the type of
work to be done.
It is possible that the recent grad-
uate tends to continue this practice
on his first job. If the work to be
done simply requires the graduate to
do a job somewhat longer than
originally planned, he may blame his
boss for his own feelings of irritation.
If so, it is extremely likely that
any boss will sooner or later become
a "bad guy" in the graduate's mind.
Students deal with professors they
decide are "bad guys" by quitting
their classes. The practice goes some-
thing like this: a student signs up for
a course, looks over the professor and
the work, and if either seems unpleas-
ant, the student simply drops the
course with no penalty. In a way, such
students have considerable experience
at being a turnover statistic before
they graduate. This mode of response
to a superior or to the work may even
lead recent graduates to seek an "out"
during the first year at work if their
boss or their job doesn't quite live
up to expectations.
Here, then, are other important
differences:
• From many superiors to one boss.
• From choice of superiors to as-
signed superiors.
• From easy "outs" to few escapes.
• From multiple, independent eval-
uations to a single evaluation.
Let's examine the last point more
thoroughly. Students are used to fre-
quent evaluations while in college.
They are often examined three or
four times a semester in each course
and are given grades indicating the
professor's perception of the value
of their work. Thus, feedback from
superiors is not only frequent but is
in terms of alphabet letters, A, B, C,
D, etc., which have, on any campus,
a common meaning. Students know
what a "B" means when they get one.
And, if they feel unfairly judged or
simply want to see what went wrong,
they ordinarily can see their professor
for a personal talk.
Grades themselves have become
increasingly important to students—
often, sadly, more important than
what they have learned. The pressure
of the Russian revolution in Ameri-
can education since Sputnik I, has
made grades—arbitrary and subjective
as both students and professors know
they are—of frightening importance.
Students believe that deans of gradu-
ate schools and the recruiters from in-
dustry are both likely to ask first
about grades. Students fear that all
the "other considerations" that are
said to be important are in reality
very secondary unless one has some
clearly unusual talent or accomplish-
ment. They seem to grow increasingly
concerned about grades as graduation
approaches. More than likely this
preoccupation with evaluation does
not disappear during the first year
on the job.
It is well recognized that personnel
evaluations in business are most often
few and far between. It seems equally
true that the evaluations, when made,
tend to be as impersonal as the per-
sonnel department will allow. It is
very common to hear a recent gradu-
ate complain that his boss never told
him where he stood or how he was
doing. Most supervisors seem to ex-
pect that employees will infer their
approximate standing in the eyes of
the boss on the basis of "little things"
the boss does or doesn't do. In other
words, the recent graduate is expec-
ted to be sensitive enough to subtle
signals from above to determine for
himself how he is doing. The differ-
ence again is great:
• From frequent to infrequent
evaluations.
• From explicit to deduced evalu-
ations.
• From understood symbols to sub-
tle signals.
The difference is all the more im-
portant when it is remembered that
the recent graduate is conditioned to
attach great importance to "grades"
from superiors. For, in spite of the
assertion by some college seniors that
they look forward to being more on
their own after graduation, the
author feels that they, as well as
their quieter brothers, need structure
as much as they ask for freedom.
They want to run loose, yet they need
to have guides to reduce their own
anxieties about living with freedom
they have not experienced previously.
They do not seem to recognize their
needs as well as they recognize their
desires. But, in the matter of evalua-
tions, they certainly want and need
them badly, partly because of prior
experience. Failure to receive them
introduces more uncertainty, the
effects of which have already been
discussed.
One last comment on evaluations.
While in college, students receive
"other-esteem" from one another as
well as from professors. In fact, it
often appears that a given student
can tolerate low grades better if he
is highly regarded by his peers. In
a way, the evaluation by peers is
much more stable a force than the
grades of professors. After all, the
student goes from course to course
and thus from professor to professor.
But his group of peers, at least the
group he refers to for esteem, stays
pretty much the same.
During thk first months on the job,
he finds his recently exalted position
as a senior considered unimportant
by fellow workers. Being a big man
on campus may not be followed on
the job by similar regard by peers.
This lack of other-esteem, combined
with a search for evaluation from a
boss who is not much inclined to give
"grades," produces a feeling of being
"nobody." In one sense, the adjust-
ment is from the world of youth to
the beginning of the world of adults.
The final switch to being more alone,
DECEMBER 1964
15


competition with peers, yet ultimately
more dependent on one boss, is an-
other difference frequently over-
looked.
Another factor, more often recog-
nized, is that the atmosphere and
purpose of academic life are very dif-
ferent from business. The real pur-
pose of an undergraduate school is
the growth of its students. The senior
has been at the center of his institu-
tion's activities for four years. Pro-
fessors worry about what students are
learning. Administrators worry about
how they are living. Nearly all the
"bosses" focus their efforts on the stu-
dents. The work to be done, or the
task of the institution, centers on the
individual development of the stud-
ent. A business seldom can afford the
luxury of such a focus. There are
many tasks to be accomplished, and
the growth and development of recent
graduates is just one of them.
One way to think of college is to
see it as a systematic intrusion by
professors into a student's experience.
After four years of such experience,
the hope is that a student will be a
more fully developed human being.
The college designs its activities and
allocates its professors to maximize
the quantity and quality of the in-
trusion. And it sees to it that the
designed experiences are systematic,
scheduled, as predictable as possible.
A business could hardly be more
different. The young man simply has
to be around when things happen
(intrusions) so that he can learn from
them. The company cannot quite
schedule problems or crises so that
the graduate's learning is maximized.
That is not its purpose. Yet the
recent graduate does not really un-
derstand the difference, and if things
move a little slowly for a while, he
feels he is not moving or learning—
and, being used to the opposite feel-
ing, he becomes troubled.
Moreover, in preparing for work,
the recent graduate studies courses
which generally emphasize the an-
alytical, generalized, and conceptual.
His first job is usually detailed,
specific, concrete, and of considerably
smaller scale. For example, a student
of finance may concern himself in
college with alternate forms of rais-
ing money (shall it be stocks or bonds
or debt?) while his work immediately
after graduation (e.g., voucher check-
ing) might well be considerably less
important to the company and less
intellectually stimulating to the grad-
uate.
Then, too, in college problems have
a curious way of being solved, neatly
and completely. Most of them are de-
signed so that they permit solution, as
in mathematics. The problems in
business are often not so much for
solving as for living with. The differ-
ence in the nature of the work and
the nature of the problems is also
important, albeit more difficult to
see clearly.
Finally, and perhaps most obscure
of all, there is a crucial difference
in the question recent graduates ask
themselves and the question they are
asked by their bosses. The graduate
asks, "Who will I be}" and his boss
asks, "What can you do?" There is
obviously an intimate relation be-
tween what a man does and who he
is, but the recent graduate is so hun-
gry for identity after losing his stu-
dent role that he feels he is a nobody.
And his job is seldom such that the
doing of it gives him a real sense of
being somebody important. If the
work itself does not provide a satis-
fying identity ("I am a voucher check-
er"), and the social system seems to
place him in a low and relatively un-
important niche, it is little wonder
that the young man feels crushed,
small, disillusioned—even if, in the
eyes of older and more experienced
men, this self-doubt is something that
will pass with time.
The important question here is
what, if anything, can be done to
assist recent graduates during their
first months out of the academic
womb so that they will stay with their
company until their eyes are open?
There are some things that can be
done, but first let's briefly review the
major points covered. Situations have
been contrasted, both before and
after graduation, from the point of
view of the recent graduate. In this
initial exploration, time, supervision,
evaluation, peer-superior orientation,
institution purpose, nature of work,
and identity were important variables
in accounting for the vast difference
between the "before" and the "after."
What, then, should be done, and
who should do it? It seems that
neither business nor education should
alter their basic purposes as a con-
venience for the graduating senior,
despite frequent suggestions from
each that the other should do so.
There is no need to solve the prob-
lems of transition from college to bus-
iness so that there is smooth sailing.
To the contrary, it may well be that
the value of learning to live with the
difficulties is potentially too great to
eliminate the rough spots.
But helping the recent graduate to
see and understand what is happen-
ing to him and inside him will be a
major step forward in assisting him
to live it out wisely. The same seems
true for his boss. If a man's superior
is explicitly aware of the difficulties
a subordinate is dealing with, it is
often possible for the boss to interpret
the subordinate's behavior with more
understanding. And perhaps the su-
perior will understand better the
feelings inside himself that seem to
come up when recent graduates give
him problems.
It might be very helpful if each
superior and each recent graduate
could discuss together the implica-
tions of ideas similar to the ones
offered here. A second-best option
would be for groups of recent grad-
uates to meet with a discussion leader
to discuss the same topics. It would
seem useful to begin such talks about
six weeks after graduates arrive on
the job and perhaps schedule them
at six-week intervals for a number of
months. Being able to think about
real or imagined difficulties and hav-
ing a place to express feelings about
them helps to reduce their cutting
edge.
There is, however, no pre-pack-
aged program which can be recom-
mended. There are no quick and
easy solutions that would help. Un-
derstanding—by professors, place-
ment officers, and students on the one
hand, and recruiters, personnel offi-
cers, and supervisors on the other-
is the first and necessary step.
Short of understanding the com-
ponents and the complexity of the
problem, graduates must continue to
live with the disappointing current
state of affairs in which the transition
from campus to company is continued
from company to company.

planned achievement.
As a corporation NCR has been
tested for more than 79 years.
Throughout this period, direction
has been maintained and objectives
achieved. The objective of NCR?
Better systems for business. This
singleness of purpose with bal-
anced diversification has led to

AND
RESEARCH
by Paul Niffenegger
CHEMICAL
ARCHITECTURE
Housing in many parts of the
world, especially in the so-called de-
veloping nations, is in acute shortage.
Whether the shortage is the result of
war, natural disaters, a primitive econ-
omy and standard of living, or
increasing population, the problem
is essentially the same. But it is not
an isolated problem; it is part of the
total economic, social, and cultural
pattern of each nation. The question
is how to solve it in this total con-
text. Members of the Architectural
Research Laboratory of The Univer-
sity of Michigan believe that they
have an answer: foam plastics.
Two years ago, the Agency for In-
ternational Development (AID) of the
U. S. Department of State sponsored
a six-months feasibility study of the
potential use of foam plastics for
housing in underdeveloped areas.
This study, which was directed by
Stephen C. A. Paraskevopoulos, Asso-
ciate Professor of Architecture, con-
cluded that it would be possible to
use foam plastics as a structural ma-
terial for making better housing in a
steadily increasing quantity and at a
steadily decreasing cost in developing
nations. Subsequent research, also
sponsored by AID, led to the erection
of a foam plastic, dome-shaped build-
ing in the Ann Arbor area, to the
design of a two-story, "folded-plate"
structure made of thin, paper-covered
polyurethane boards, to experimen-
tation with other advanced structural
concepts in foam plastics, and to the
idea of establishing, with industrial
support, a Polymer Science Institute
within the University.
The very concept of foam plastics
as the structural elements in dwel-
lings—walls, roofs, and floors—requires
some radical rethinking of architec-
tural preconceptions. If we refuse to
divest ourselves of these preconcep-
tions, we will never be able to grasp
or to appreciate the advantages of
foam plastic houses.
Rigid foam plastics, with which we
are familiar in shapes and uses rang-
ing from Christmas tree ornaments to
insulation, are produced by adding
a blowing agent to chemical formula-
tions, thus causing the materials to
form cells and expand to many times
their original volume. Although most
common in light weights, they can
be made with densities of less than
one pound per cubic foot to over sixty
pounds per cubic foot. The foam plas-
tics are either thermosetting or therm-
oplastic. The former are hardnened
by heat into a permanent shape and
cannot be reformed by heat. The ther-
mo plastics, which soften when heated
and harden when cooled, can be re-
shaped by heating and cooling. Some
foam plastics are made in predeter-
mined shapes in a factory and shipped
to the building site; some can be
foamed on the site in the desired man-
ner or sprayed on a surface. Foam
plastics vary widely in strength, dur-
ability, appearance, and cost. Some
of them form their own tough skin
when cured; others are best used as
core material in sandwich panels be-
tween layers of paper, wood, cloth,
metal, or other plastics, to all of
which they adhere easily and well.
The foam plastics are good insulators,
lightweight, easily fabricated, and ver-
satile. Moreover, their cost per unit
volume is continuously decreasing.
The purpose of the feasibility study
which the Architectural Research
Laboratory undertook in 1%2 was to
determine if foam plastics could be
used in creating total structural sys-
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Professor Paraskevopoulos and his
staff agreed that any foam plastic
studied should not be considered as a
substitute for another material but
rather as a new material to be used
in developing an entirely new product,
whose shape and appearance might
differ from anything that previously
existed. The whole question of using
foam plastics for houses had to be
approached purely analytically: What
are their properties? What can they
do? What can they do best? What are
their limitations? Which configura-
tions or geometries make best use of
their properties? Can they be used
with other materials? To what extent
can they be used as a structural ma-
terial? Only after such questions were
answered—from an architect's or struc-
tural engineer's point of view—could
the possibilities for adaption of a
specific foam plastic to house design
be explored.
This kind of research could not be
conducted without the wholehearted
cooperation of the plastics industry.
During this project, the research staff
has established direct contact with
approximately one hundred chemical
companies and plastics manufacturers,
who have generously offered experi-
ence, ideas, and materials. This whole
project has indeed been an outstand-
ing example of the way that the Fed-
eral government, the University, and
private industry can cooperate to
their mutual benefit. During the six
months of the feasibility study, the
project staff gathered data on the phy-
sical properties of foam plastics, on
various methods of producing and
fabricating foam plastic products
(casting, molding, extruding, spray-
ing, laminating, vacuum forming),
and on the equipment used in pro-
ducing foam plastics and fabricating
plastic components. The plastics sam-
ples were either obtained from col-
laborating companies or produced by
the research staff and submitted to a
series of rigorous tests specially de-
signed for the purposes of the study.
Since the study was conducted by
architects and not chemists, the func-
tion of the testing and exploration of
each material was primarily directed
toward determining the possibility of
a structural use of the plastics. At
present, of all the plastics investigat-
ed, polystyrene and polyurethane
seem to have the widest possible appli-
cation. Other foam plastics, of course,
have also been taken into considera-
tion but these two, which are made
by many producers, are more highly
developed and have a broad range of
possible uses.
With the completion of the feasi-
bility study and with the realization
that foam plastics could be used
structurally in housing, the next step
obviously was to design and construct
prototype structural components and
to determine the procedures and re-
quirements for creating structural
systems for application in housing for
underdeveloped areas. Once again,
AID is sponsoring research, which is
ultimately aimed at creating an in-
dustrial base for low-cost housing in
developing nations.
Much of the project staff's efforts
are now directed toward creating
prototypes of foam plastic dwelling
units. Two have already been de-
signed (one has been completed) and
others are in various stages of devel-
opment.
The first prototype foam plastics
structure erected for the purposes ofs
the project is a dome, forty-five feet
in diameter, made of four-inch thick
"Styrofoam" (polystyrene foam). It
was designed by the project staff and
erected by the Dow Chemical Com-
pany of Midland, Michigan. In less
than twelve hours, a simple mechan-
ical device (developed by Dow) con-
structed the dome by heat-bending
and heat-sealing "Styrofoam" strips.
Details on the erection process cannot
be released at the present time, but
it is significant to note that this is the
first shell structure which was totally
built by a machine. The hemispher-
ical dome is restrained by earth and
concrete fill around the perimeter.
Openings were easily cut in the foam
plastic for doors, windows, and vents.
The surface was painted to protect
the "Styrofoam" from the effects of
ultraviolet light.
The shape of the structure is rad-
ically different from that used for
dwellings in most parts of the world.
The shape is indeed an illustration of
one of the guiding principles of die
whole research project: the material
is the starting point, and its proper-
ties determine the geometry of the
structure. "Styrofoam" happens to
work well in this geometry, hence the
shape of the building.
Construction of this building dem-
onstrated beyond a doubt that foam
plastics can be used as the structural
material in building. Now that this
foam plastic building is in use for
field testing purposes as a lounge and
pro shop for a nearby golf club, it is
being carefully observed to determine
the weathering properties and struc-
tural durability of the material.
The process used for the erection
of this structure is not limited to
making domes. The machine can be
set to lay down the "Styrofoam" strips
in other predetermined patterns such
as cylinders and eventually square
tubes of room-size dimensions. The
beauty of the process lies in its sim-
plicity, for only two technicians are
needed to operate the machine. The
building is constructed with light-
weight, portable materials and equip-
ment, and is itself lightweight and
portable, which are advantages likely
DECEMBER 1964

without well-developed systems of
transportation.
Another fresh approach to struc-
tural building materials is being
worked out by the project staff with
materials supplied by the Union Car-
bide Corporation of New York. The
material used in this structural sys-
tem is a thin urethane foam board
surfaced on each side with plain
brown wrapping or kraft paper, which
is then coated with an impregnating
material to meet structural and wea-
thering requirements. The resulting
sandwich is three eighths-inch thick.
At first sight, such a thin and light
material does not seem at all feasible
as a structural component of a build-
ing. By itself it is weak and very flexi-
ble. Yet it is the very flexibility of
the sandwich that makes it so attrac-
tive; it can be folded to make struc-
tural members (bents) of great
strength. Here again it is the geom-
etry in which a particular material is
used that is the key to its structural
advantage. Industrial production of
this material is in the form of a con-
tinuous strip which can be folded
and glued in various sizes and shapes
and then coated with a weather-re-
sistant material and painted for ap-
pearance. Other configurations are
possible and have been tested.
This highly promising system was
the object of much experimentation
by the project staff. Kraft paper was
found to be satisfactory as a skin ma-
terial. The excellent adhesive proper-
ties of polyurethane made for a strong
bond between the outside paper lay-
ers and the plastic filling of the
sandwich. A number of different con-
figurations for structural members
were developed and rigorously tested.
It was found that the material has
great potential, especially in the tri-
angular shape, for walls, floors, and
roofs.
With materials supplied by Union
Carbide, a prototype two-story struc-
ture has been designed to be erected
at the College of Architecture and
Design. It is the first time that these
lightweight materials will be used for
the erection of a two-story building.
The prefabricated bents, which are
easily handled by two men, are sim-
ply glued together. Modern adhesive
technology has produced adhesives
which are actually stronger than the
materials being glued together. The
floors of the building are covered with
an impact-resistant material to pro-
tect against a great hazard of modern
times: women's high heels, which
could damage the surface of the
panels.
Although only the "Styrofoam" and
the paper-urethane board systems
have reached the actual construction
stage, a number of other techniques
are also being investigated. One possi-
bility being explored with the Wyan-
dotte Chemicals Corporation o f
Wyandotte, Michigan, is to spray the
foam onto a paper-nylon skin stretched
on a folding wooden lattice. Erection
of this structure awaits suitable wea-
ther conditions, since outdoor spray-
ing of urethane foam is affected by
varying atmospheric conditions. An-
other possibility is a foam-inflated
structure. In this method, the plastic
is foamed inside a skin membrane
much like a balloon. The unit's final
shape is determined by the shape of
the membrane. Simple model studies
have been undertaken to work out the
technical problems. Experimentation
has also been started on a self-rigidiz-
ing flexible foam system. Stretchable
fabrics or sheets of flexible foam are
put into the desired shape and im-
pregnated with various formulations
to make them rigid in that shape. An
impregnating agent that would hard-
en under normal atmospheric moist-
ure or ultraviolet radiation seems very
promising. Complex curves can easily
be produced with this method, there-
by eliminating the elaborate wooden
forms that are necessary to obtain
the same configuration in concrete.
The splendid cooperation between
the whole plastics industry and the
University's research staff on this
project has made each participant
aware of the special talents and
knowledge that die other can offer.
Since the whole field of plastics, espec-
ially for structural use on an indus-
trial basis, is still new, much research
remains to be done. As a result of this
project, and in order to stimulate and
coordinate further research in this
area, an Institute of Polymer Sciences
is being planned, with the coopera-
tion and support of the plastics indus-
try and the Society of the Plastics In-
dustry, as a unit within the University.
A number of plastics manufacturers
have expressed great interest in spon-
soring basic research in the new In-
stitute. Other firms have indicated a
willingness to establish graduate fel-
lowships to promote advanced train-
ing and research in plastics. Thus
there will be a permanent research
and administrative structure at The
University of Michigan to foster the
advancement of knowledge of plastics
through teaching, research, and com-
munity-industry service.

YOUR
FIRST JOB
WILL YOU BE
HEADING
HELLBENT
FOR
The accelerated pace at
which technology is advanc-
ing may mean that the
wrong decision for your first
job may cause you to slip
into the abyss of obsoles-
cence. Engineers and engi-
neering management at
Hamilton Standard have al-
ready confronted and suc-
cessfully overcome this
bleak problem. □ In the
early 1950's, while con-
tinuing an undisputed posi-
tion in the propeller busi-
ness, management initiated
a swift, sound product
diversification program.
By judiciously applying the
valued skills and capabili-
ties that HSD engineers
acquired as the world's
foremost developers and
manufacturers of propel-
lers, the switch to new prod-
uct opportunities in the
then-new jet market was
orderly and highly success-
ful. Hamilton Standard rode
the wave of aviation prog-
ress to leadership in the
i jet aircraft and aerospace
equipment field as they al-
ready held in the field of
propellers. Engineers with
heavy experience in hydro-
mechanical control devices
for propellers turned their
skills to metering fuel flows
in engine controls; the aero-
dynamics of air condition-
ing systems proved a natu-
ral field for engineers who
had moved masses of air
with propellers . From air
conditioning the field was
broadened to include jet
engine controls and pneu-
matic valves, beginning
with analytical feasibility
studies through preliminary
design and prototype devel-
opment. □ Since early 1960
this same determination
and mobility has been ap-
plied to adapting engineers'
skills to obtaining a share
of the new missile, rocket
and space vehicle oppor-
tunities. Company state-of-
the-art advances have led
to receipt of contracts to
provide the environmental
control for the lunar excur-
sion module, and space
suits. Studies have been
completed on one-man pro-
pulsion units to be used by
astronauts during orbital
rendezvous and on the
moon's surface.□ The com-
pany's continued expanding
probe into the fields of
electronics, ground sup-
port, electron beam tech-
nology and industrial
valves, among others, is
sustained by an organiza-
tion of almost one thousand
graduate engineers and
technicians with a wide
variety of complementary
engineering and manufac-
turing skills. Supporting
these technical/production
teams, in turn, are some of
the most extensive pri-
vately-owned experimental
and manufacturing facili-
ties in the United States.
Without such support,
theory holds sway, new
products rarely mature, and
obsolescence of both com-
pany and personnel set in.
Hamilton recognizes that
its ability to produce a
workable article is meas-
ured by two basic criteria:
its people, and the tools at
their immediate disposal. □
Such diversification has
brought Hamilton into the
areas of engineering and
scientific disciplines includ-
ing aerodynamics, com-
pressible flow, control dy-
namics, digital computa-
tion, analog computation,
electronics, electron optics,
fluid dynamics, heat trans-
fer, hydraulics, instrumen-
tation, internal aerodynam-
ics, kinematics, magnetic
circuitry, mechanical met-
allurgy mechanics, metal-
lurgy, physical chemistry,
physics, quality control, re-
liability, servo-mechanisms,
statistical analysis, struc-
tures, systems analysis,
thermodynamics, thermo-
electricity, tool engineer-
ing, transistor circuitry,
vehicular dynamics and vi-
brations.□ Hamilton Stand-
ard's successful diversifi-
cation also hinged on an-
other hedge against engi-
neering obsolescence ...
the obsolescence associ-
ated with the inability of
the individual to keep up
with new developments in
his field. Management re-
cognized and met this prob-
lem early, by setting up
programs of continuing
education. United Aircraft
Corporation sponsors a
Graduate Education Pro-
gram offering part-time,
tuition-paid advanced study
at Trinity College, Univer-
sity of Connecticut, and
Rensselaer Polytechnic In-
stitute of Connecticut.
There is also a regular
schedule of technical and
non-technical courses at
company facilities, plus
seminars and short courses
at colleges and universities.

with conventional screening techniques.
The inks contain gold and platinum to
conduct electrical current. After screen-

seal the inked circuits to the ceramic.
The modules are pinned, for installation
on circuit cards, and dipped in solder
bath. The tiny printed resistor patterns
then are trimmed automatically to their

Dear Sirs:
I was very much disturbed by some
comments contained in the article
Radiation Disposal by James Berger
in the recent Technic. Let me state a
few facts concerning the development
and use of nuclear power reactors. It
turns out that the future of nuclear
reactors in the electric power indus-
try is quite a bit brighter than a
casual Technic reader may be led to
believe.
Berger quotes Professor William
Pierce as saying that the predictions
that one half of our power will be
generated by nuclear reactors by 1975
are false, and that we're wrong when
we expect there to be more nuclear
power plants.
As far as I know there are no such
predictions. Professor Manson Bene-
dict, Chairman of the Department of
Nuclear Engineering at MIT, reports
from the recently completed Geneva
Conference that, according to latest
estimates, 50 percent of United States
generating capacity will be nuclear by
year 2000. In fact, by 1980, as much
as 20 percent of the generating capac-
ity in a number of countries other
than the United States, eg, Pakistan
and India, will be nuclear. By that
time the total capacity predicted for
the world's nuclear power stations
will be in excess of 100 million kilo-
watts. A vice-president of the Com-
monwealth Edison Company, Chi-
cago, recently told me he though his
comany was currently building its last
non-nuclear power plant.
To back up his contention that
atomic plants aren't living up to ex-
pectations, Professor Pierce says "The
Fermi reactor is way behind schedule
and still hasn't reached capacity."
This is true, of course, but it
doesn't illustrate this point. The
Fermi reactor is a sodium cooled fast
breeder reactor and was certainly
never intended to be economically
competitive. The technology of fast
breeders is not well developed and
many basic problems in fast reactor
physics remain to be solved. Thus the
reactor is primarily an experimental
one; its initial capacity of 100 MWe
(100 electrical megawatts) is very
small compared to most conventional
fossil installations. However, accord-
ing to Walker L. Cisler, president of
the Detroit Edison Company, breed-
ers may extend by as much as a hun-
dred-fold the fissionable material
available, and thus provide an energy
source far exceeding economically re-
coverable fossil fuel reserves.
So the Detroit Edison Company
isn't worried about the Fermi reactor
"not living up to expectations". On
the other hand, to cite one example
of a nuclear plant exceeding expecta-
tions, the Dresden reactor outside
Chicago has been producing electric
power for over four years, has shut
down for refueling only twice, and
was unavailable for power production
less than any of the Commonwealth
Edison conventional plants during
the same period.
Berger's article poses the question
"Why should we spend huge sums of
money to build nuclear reactors when
we're finding more efficient ways to
use our standard fuels?"
The answer is two-fold. First, in
some areas nuclear power plants can
now be economically competitive with
fossil-fueled plants; second, our re-
serves of nuclear fuel, especially with
the extension of fissile material due
to the coming use of breeder reactors.
According to Louis J. Rodis, presi-
dent of the Atomic Industrial Forum,
nuclear power has met the economic
and technical criteria for integration
into at least 60 percent of the power
networks in the United States today.
A significant milestone was reached
just this year when the Jersey Central
Light and Power Company announced
its planned Oyster Creek nuclear
plant would produce electricity for
less than four mills per kilowatt-hour,
a price comparable to that for electric-
ity from a coal fired plant in that part
of the country.
Although we may be finding more
efficient ways to use our standard
fuels, their use in areas other than
electricity production is increasing.
The use of power reactors conserves
fossil fuels for applications not readi-
ly served by nuclear energy, such as
chemical synthesis. And of course,
nuclear power plants do not pollute
the air with fly ash or corrosive or
poisonous fumes which make some of
our cities nearly unlivable. Power
reactors have another use: countries
with limited fresh water supplies are
interested in combination desalina-
tion-power nuclear reactors. Tunisia,
for example, plans to purchase a 300
MWth plant that would produce
more than four million gallons of
fresh water daily.
Even though the United States has
conventional energy resources second
only to the Soviet Union, their un-
even geographic distribution, increas-
ing transportation costs, the greater
effort needed to recover them from
deep underground, and the demand
for electricity in the United States in-
creasing at the rate of 7 percent per
year dictate development and use of a
new energy source.
Sincerely,
Warren Devine,

Shhh! Enginuity at work!
That's Bill Emrich immersed in his work behind that
Lincoln engine. He's testing new oil additive formula-
tions, designed to make new engines produce to their
potential. Yet, whatever he develops has to meet the
needs of older engine models, too. You might say it's a
matter of enginuity.
Bill uses several test engines: among these are a Labeco
one-cylinder, a Caterpillar one-cylinder and special
Lincoln and Oldsmobile engines. He tests oil additives
and formulations for sludge, rust, wear and reaction to
high-temperatures under severe operating conditions.
His findings will help car owners to get greater mileage
between oil changes, longer engine life. A most important
project. Yet, Bill is only 24 years old. Just last year, he
came to American Oil and is now working for Amoco
Chemicals, a sister company. Bill graduated from the
University of Illinois with a B.S. degree in mechanical
engineering.
The need for young professional people in positions of
responsibility and creativity is great. Bill happens to be
an automotive engineer, but he still might be working
for us had he chosen a different field—mathematics,
physics, chemistry. A variety of opportunities exist here
at American Oil Company.

FROM CAMPUS TO CAREER WITH DELCO RADIO
Just 10 years ago. Max Stanton
received his BA in Physics from
Indiana University.
Today, Max is a senior project
engineer at Delco Radio Division
of General Motors Corporation in
Kokomo, Indiana.
Max is shown above analyzing
gas ambients found in sealed tran-
sistor enclosures. The system—a
residual gas analyzer—is pumped
down to a low vacuum with an
absorption tank and vacion pump.
Then a transistor is punctured and
the gas introduced into the analy-
zer. Using mass spectrographic
techniques, an analysis of the con-
stituents through mass number 80
can be made. Such analyses are
helpful in the study of surface ef-
fects in solid state devices.

METALLURGICAL ENGINEERING
The two degrees, B.S.E. (Materials Engineering)
and B.S.E. (Metallurgical Engineering) are closely
related, but different. Both curricula require a
sound background in the basic sciences of mathe-
matics, chemistry, and physics, and a supporting
knowledge of related engineering sciences like
mechanics, electrical circuitry, and thermodynamics.
The metallurgist works in those industries
which extract, refine, process, and use metals. He
may work in production, in design, or in customer
contact assignments. His activities may be of the
management, consultation, or research nature.
The materials engineer focuses more attention
on the engineering applications of all materials and
somewhat less attention on chemical processing.
These materials include polymers (plastics), and
ceramics (inorganic compounds), as well as metals.
Therefore, he should become specifically familiar
with the internal structures of materials and with
the relationship of these structures to material
properties. He will, like the metallurgist, become
involved with management, technical consultation,
research, and development.
This student is determining the crystal struc-
ture of a material by measuring the intensity
of x-ray diffraction lines on a film. This type
of information permits him to describe in-
ternal structure of metals, ceramics, and
polymers, and therefore anticipate some of
the properties that these materials will have.

This is industrial engineering?
Yes.
And if that's all there were to it, our industrial engineer-
ing ranks couldn't possibly hope to deserve alert recruits
from engineering colleges that lead rather than follow.
Watching an operator react to the explanation of a new
assembly procedure is just one of the more easily photo-
graphed of a long series of subtle operations in the math-
ematics that link psychological, physical, and economic
factors into a sense-making structure.
We admire fine intuitions in an engineer. We seek chaps
who have involved themselves with nuts and bolts since
childhood. Yet the task is to improve on the familiar fruits
of intuition. The job consists of upgrading others' work and
one's own to higher, more productive levels of abstraction
than simple-minded busyness with nuts and bolts.
Kodak is of a size and diversity to afford room for more
than one pattern in industrial engineering. A man's succes-
sive assignments here are as varied as his college courses.
Confidence grows. He finds he has built a solid reputation
by carrying a project from design to the stage, years later,
where the aim is to squeeze another tenth of a percent into
the production efficiency.
We also welcome another type. When a project reaches
80^ of completion, this industrial engineering personality
won't resent an invitation to form a new team with new
counterparts in design and manufacturing engineering to
start a new and more stimulating project. Gladly will he
retain responsibility for the old one and six or seven that
preceded it.
Drop us a line. Industrial engineers aren't all. We need to
hear from mechanical engineers, chemical engineers, elec-
tronic engineers, chemists, and physicists as well.

Advancement in a Big Company:
How it Works
An Interview with General Electric's C. K. Rieger, Vice President and Group Executive, Electric Utility Group
C. K. Rieger
■ Charles K. Rieger joined General Elec-
tric's Technical Marketing Program after
earning a BSEE at the University of Mis-
souri in 1936. Following sales engineering
assignments in motor, defense and home
laundry operations, he became manager of
the Heating Device and Fan Division in
1947. Other Consumer-industry management
positions followed. In 1953 he was elected
a vice president, one of the youngest men
ever named a Company officer. Mr. Rieger
became Vice President, Marketing Services
in 1959 and was appointed to his present
position in 1961. He is responsible for all
the operations of some six divisions com-
posed of 23 product operations oriented
primarily toward the Electric Utility market.
Q. How can I be sure of getting the
recognition I feel I'm capable of earn-
ing in a big company like G.E.?
A. We learned long ago we couldn't
afford to let capable people get lost.
That was one of the reasons why G.E.
was decentralized into more than a
hundred autonomous operating de-
partments. These operations develop,
engineer, manufacture and market
products much as if they were inde-
pendent companies. Since each de-
partment is responsible for its own
success, each man's share of author-
ity and responsibility is pinpointed.
Believe me, outstanding performance
is recognized, and rewarded.
Q. Can you tell me what the "promo-
tional ladder" is at General Electric?
A. We regard each man individually.
Whether you join us on a training
program or are placed in a specific
position opening, you'll first have to
prove your ability to handle a job.
Once you've done that, you'll be given
more responsibility, more difficult
projects—work that's important to
the success of your organization and
your personal development. Your abil-
ity will create a "promotional ladder"
of your own.
Q. Will my development be confined
to whatever department I start in?
A. Not at all! Here's where "big com-
pany" scope works to broaden your
career outlook. Industry, and General
Electric particularly, is constantly
changing — adapting to market the
fruits of research, reorganizing to
maintain proper alignment with our
customers, creating new operations
to handle large projects. All this rep-
resents opportunity beyond the limits
of any single department.
Q. Yes, but just how
opportunities arise?
often do these
A. To give you some idea, 25 percent
of G-E's gross sales last year came
from products that were unknown
only five or ten years ago. These new
products range from electric tooth
brushes and silicone rubber com-
pounds to atomic reactors and inter-
planetary space probes. This chang-
ing Company needs men with ambi-
tion and energy and talent who aren't
afraid of a big job—who welcome the
challenge of helping to start new
businesses like these. Demonstrate
your ability—whether to handle com-
plex technical problems or to manage
people, and you won't have long to
wait for opportunities to fit your
needs.
Q. How does General Electric help
me prepare myself for advancement
opportunity?
A. Programs in Engineering, Manu-
facturing or Technical Marketing give
you valuable on-the-job training. We
have Company-conducted courses to
improve your professional ability no
matter where you begin. Under Tui-
tion Refund or Advanced Degree Pro-
grams you can continue your formal
education. Throughout your career
with General Electric you'll receive
frequent appraisals to help your self-
development. Your advancement will
be largely up to you.

of management
is essential
to our goal of
great growth"
At the 1964 stockholders' meeting, Arjay Miller,
President of Ford Motor Company, emphasized the
Company's far-sighted recruitment program and its accent
on developing management talent:
"One aspect of our planning is crucial to the success of
everything else we do. It engages the best thoughts and efforts of
our whole management team, from top to bottom, throughout the
world. I am speaking of the development of management. The
immediate future of our Company depends heavily upon the abilities
of the people who are now key members of our management team.
"In the longer run, our future depends on what we are doing at
the present time to attract and develop the people who will
be making the major decisions 10 to 20 years from now. We are
developing management competence in depth in order to attack the
problems that will confront a company of great growth—and
great growth (both in profits and sales) is exactly the goal
we have established for Ford Motor Company.
"We are continuing to emphasize recruiting. Last spring, 180 of our
management people devoted part of their time to recruiting
outstanding graduates from colleges and universities throughout
the U.S. Last year, these efforts resulted in our hiring over
1,000 graduates, 220 more than the year before.
"We are seeking and we are finding young men—and young women,
too—with brains and backbone—people who have the ability and
the desire to make room for themselves at the top. We give our
trainees challenging assignments with as much responsibility as
they can carry. We promote them as fast as they are ready. Those
who are interested in easy security soon drop out. Those who
have what we want stay with us, and move up quickly to increased
responsibility and the pay that goes with it. Thanks to the quality
of the people we are recruiting and developing, I am firmly
convinced that our outlook is most promising."

Current-Pumped Abrupt
Junction Varactor
Power-Frequency Converters
The varactor diode has become well known
s an excellent device for low-noise amplifica-
on. Recently, however, the varactor diode
been used in high-level frequency con-
verters as both a means of obtaining large
amounts of power, tunable over wide band-
widths, and as a means of placing FM and PM
information on a CW source, such as a
varactor multiplier. The high-level parametric
upconverter differs from a low-noise para-
metric amplifier in the area of conversion
efficiency.
Coaxial-Balun Push-Pull Converter
One of the problems in the large signal
solution for a varactor frequency converter
is the infinite number of terms found when
attempting to evaluate the Taylor expansion
for charge as a function of voltage for an
arbitrary varactor. If one reverses this approach,
and finds the expansion for voltage as a
function of charge, with a junction exponent,
t. of Vi (abrupt junction varactor), it is found
that the series is finite and easily utilized to
find a more exact solution for the diode
transfer i mpedance.
Because of its inherent symmetry, a push-
pull application of the diodes provides a large
degree of signal isolation, as well as an in-
crease in allowable input power. This type
of circuit provides an output at the upper
sideband frequency which may be isolated
from the pump circuit, by diode balance,
without the need for lossy filters. Tunability
is readily attained using the appropriate im-
pedance matching networks without the added
complications associated with low-loss tunable
filters. A low-pass filter is necessary in the
signal port to prevent the pump power from
being dissipated in the signal circuit.
A simplified representation of a circuit using
only coaxial networks, is shown in the figure.
This particular circuit uses what might be
referred to as a section of coaxial-coax. The
diodes are pumped in series by means of a
balanced transmission line, which may be
designed using the techniques available for
constructing "balun transformers." The signal
is introduced through a low-pass filter and
drives the diodes in the push-pull, parallel
mode. The resultant idler is generated in a
TEM mode, with the conductors acting as a
quarter-wave coaxial tuning assembly. The
output may be removed using a current probe,
coupled to the idler center conductor at the
proper impedance tap. The output cavity may
be tuned by varying the position of the rear
shorting wall (A-A), using sliding finger con-
tacts. With this approach, power levels of
several watts have been handled with a con-
version loss of 3db compared to power level
of several milliwatts with lOdb conversion loss
for conventional resistive mixers.

Room Temperature GaAs
Laser Communications
Communications was among the first appli-
cations considered after the invention of the
laser. Practical realization of the goal was
delayed by the difficulties associated with
inefficient energy conversion and inadequate
modulation techniques. The discovery of the
semiconductor injection laser in 1962 greatly
reduced these difficulties, but introduced the
restriction of operation under cryogenic con-
ditions. Gallium arsenide injection lasers
promise energy conversion efficiencies of 20-
30%, while modulation of the optical signal
can be accomplished simply by modulating
the injection current. Early in 1964, the cryo-
genic restriction was eliminated when efforts of
RCA scientists proved successful in discovering
a type of gallium arsenide diode which ex-
hibited laser action at room temperature with
threshold currents much lower han those
previously reported. This discovery permitted
the engineering of a room temperature com-
munications link and in May, 1964, such a
communications link was demonstrated for
the first time. The system employs pulse fre-
quency modulation at a 20 kc repetition rate,
has a bandwidth of 5 kc, and can operate in
bright sunlight. Ranges up to three miles have
been obtained while operating within the atmos-
phere. Using parallel diodes, a much greater
range is feasible. The narrow linewidth of 20
angstroms permits the use of narrow band
optical filters thereby reducing background
noise. The system is free of radio frequency
interference which plagues conventional com-
munication systems, and is so efficient that
three nickel cadmium batteries (the size of
standard flashlight cells) can provide hours of
continuous operation.

15 Megacycle Tape
Bandwidth Response
RCA engineers have developed an advanced
magnetic recording system with the highest
bandwidth response reported to date. This
achievement results from integrated efforts in
all phases of magnetic recording, such as:
air bearing design, high performance servos
(SO kc response), precision mechanisms and
magnetic head circuitry.
This recent accomplishment is being used in
equipment with two 8 Mc bandwidth channels
designed for application in a precision radar
system. In this design the heads are rotated to
achieve 3200 inch-per-second head-to-tape
speed in a transverse scan mode. The unit uses
a specialized form of a frequency modulated
carrier system to achieve a response from 100
cycles per second to 8 Mc. The 3200 IPS head
speed permits a wavelength of 0.32 mils at a
10 Mc FM carrier. Head gap lengths of
90 x 10-8 inches are employed to achieve
FM response to 15 Mc.
These recent achievements in Defense Engineering are indicative of the
great range of activities in research, applied research, advanced development,
design and development at RCA. To learn more about the many scientific
challenges in both defense and commercial engineering awaiting bachelor and
advanced degree candidates in Electrical or Mechanical Engineering, Physics,
Chemistry or Mathematics, write: College Relations, Radio Corporation of
America, Cherry Hill, New Jersey.
Closed-loop electronically
variable delay line system
In order to effect a high reproduction ac-
curacy for radar use, five servomechanisms are
employed to insure stability of tape and head
motion. The most interesting of these is a
pure electronic servo employing the principle
of variable delay to remove time displacement
errors from the signal. This system employs a
25 to 1 loop gain at a bandwidth of 50 kc.
This closed-loop system achieves a time-base
accuracy of ±10 nanoseconds. The rms value
of this error is less than 5 nanoseconds,
equivalent to less than 5 feet of radar range
error, a new standard of excellence for radar
recording accuracy.

SALESMANSHIP
The engineer frequently complains that he is misunder-
stood. He gripes about the incorrect image that the layman
has of him—that of a culturally uninformed, sliderule-
carrying, and socially inept individual who has not mas-
tered the English language. He grumbles under his breath
when his boss does not recognize him as the genius that
he is.
Are these complaints well founded? They are—in a
sense. The engineer is misunderstood. Most people don't
know what he's like or what he does unless they come in
direct contact with him. Also, his boss may well be over-
looking his talent, and society may very well fail to recog-
nize him as an untapped wealth of social and cultural opin-
ion and knowledge.
The engineer has a legitimate complaint because, in most
cases, he is well informed and opinionated on the funda-
mental issues of the time. He does know what's going on
in the world. He can use the English language correctly.
Yes, the engineer is misrepresented, but can he justly
blame his difficulties and his erroneous image on those who
do not understand him? No, he cannot. He has only himself
to blame. One could argue that a man should automatically
be recognized by his society for his true worth, but this is
not how life works. It is a fundamental characteristic of man
—in our society at least—to judge the value of a package
by the beauty of the wrappings. Anyone would readily agree
that a new brand of toothpaste would never sell, no matter
how high the quality of the toothpaste, if it was marketed
in a gray tube under the brand name SLUDGE. Similarly,
the engineer has a product to sell—his knowledge—and it
will never be worth anything to his peers if he cannot sell it.
And he cannot sell it if he doesn't present it well, be it a
revolutionary idea for a chemical process or a way to boost
the Junior Chamber of Commerce's annual newspaper drive.
Now, what does one have to do to make a sale? First, he

must have his product. This argument has presupposed that
our engineer is one of the members of his profession that
does have something worth selling. Second, he has to look
like he knows what he is doing. If he expects his boss to
spend a million dollars on his idea, then he'd better look
like a man who comes up with million dollar ideas. Third,
he has to not only be able to present his case well in both
oral and written form, but he also has to do it. This is really
the crux of the argument. He not only has to know how
to sell himself, he has to go out and do it. The engineer who
has good ideas, plenty of ability, and the potential to be a
good salesman, but fails to advance himself and his society
because he underestimates the importancne of being an
active salesman, has no one to blame but himself.
Certainly not every engineer has the basic ability to come
up with good ideas and then sell them. Certainly not every
engineer that does have these abilities feels chat he is going
through life unheard of or even cares if he is. But there
definitely are many engineers who do have ability and ideas,
who do feel like they should have more influence, and who
do complain because they don't have any influence. These
individuals could do their society and themselves a big favor
by learning a little respect for the art of salesmanship and
going to the trouble to apply it.

the general public has at least some
feeling today. When the term was
coined in 1947 by Del Harder, vice
president of the Ford Motor Com-
pany, it was defined in a rather nar-
row technical sense, as the "automatic
handling of parts between progressive
production processes." Since that time,
however, automation has taken on
broader meanings, until today it finds
itself enveloped variously in auras
of both glamor and disfavor.
cess control equipment, such as is
used in oil refineries and chemical
plants; and automatic materials hand-
ling equipment that transports pro-
ducts in some state of completion
from one place to the next.1 The
equipment in each of these general
categories is considered automated be-
cause it can respond to internal
stimuli, which its sensory mechanisms
pick up and its decision-making cen-
ter interprets. In the jargon of the
industry, such equipment is said to be

mation seems to be the physical per-
sonification of the progressive spirit
of modern America. It signifies na-
tional wealth, personal leisure, indus-
trial efficiency, product excellence,
speed, higher education, scientific
prowess, and world leadership. In this
sense automation is a real boon to
America and to mankind in general.
But automation has its less favorable
aspects, too. For some Americans au-
tomation is the ugly orge which steals
jobs and makes acquired skills quickly
obsolete. For some, it is the national
disease which threatens to turn hu-
man beings into code numbers on
IBM cards. For some, automation is
even the inevitable force which will
eventually control man's body and
mind, as it does in Orwell's America
of 1984. In this sense automation is
most surely the bane of mankind.
The real significance of automation,
however, lies hidden beneath the
auras of glamor and disfavor which
envelope it. Those who view the situ-
ation most objectively are able to
grasp that significance. To them auto-
mation is simply a way of making a
better product more efficiently. It is
an inevitable result of technological
progress, and a tool of mankind. For
the very reason that automation is in-
evitable, however, it is a strong force
to be reckoned with.
In the technical sense automation
is the catch-all phrase used to describe
electronic data-processing equipment
such as digital computers and calcu-
lators of many types; automatic pro-
duction machines, such as milling
machines and lathes; automatic pro-
operating on the principle of feed-
back. Figure 1, below, indicates the
relative amounts of various types of
automatic equipment and controls in
use in the United States in 1960. The
data are results of a survey taken by
Automation magazine and were pre-
sented to the Joint Economic Com-
mittee of the U.S. Congress by Roger
W. Bolz, publisher-editor of the mag-
azine.
Admittedly, automation's effect on
employment in the United States is
not clearly understood. It is often
suggested that automation has two
pronounced effects on the job force.
First, automation is thought to
decrease the demand for common
labor by increasing the productivity
of the individual worker. Second,
automation is thought to require an
upgrading of the labor force as a
whole, encouraging professional and
technical endeavors at the expense of
common labor. To say the least, there
is considerable disagreement among
the experts as to the magnitude of
these effects. Most now agree how-
ever, that automation does produce
the first of the noted effects: a de-
crease in the demand for unskilled
and semi-skilled labor. The following
statistics show just how effectively
that demand has been decreased. Since
1939, the U.S. poulation and with it
the labor force has increased some
32%. However, since that time the
dollar volume of goods and services
has increased by 380%, indicating a
considerable rise in the productivity
of the average American.2 The auto
industry for example, today makes

with the same number of employees.
The steel industry requires twelve
men to make a ton of steel today.
In 1941, twenty were required. The
oil industry, one of the most fully
automated of all industries, has raised
production from 5.3 to 8.4 million
barrels a day in the decade from 1947
on. During that time there has been
a net decrease of 10,000 workers in
the oil industry3. One of the most
striking examples of automation's
ability to cut the work force is evi-
denced in the record of the highly
automated Southern Railroad. In the
decade from 1946 to 1956, when the
greatest efforts toward automation
were being made, employment was
cut from 40,000 to 22,000 (45%), al-
though production rose 11%. The
nationwide average decrease in rail-
road employment was 16%4.
With all the statistics compiled, cal-
culations show that the average
American can produce twice as much
today as he could 25 years ago.5 The
conclusion is obvious: the demand
for workers of some types has defi-
nitely decreased.
As an indication of which type of
worker has been so affected, it is use-
ful to note that during the eleven year
period from 1947 to 1958, the abso-
lute number of workers directly en-
gaged in the production of goods
decreased by 0.25 million. Over the
same period, the number of profes-
sional and white collar workers rose
by 1.37 million.6 In fact, during the
last ten years, the number of non-pro-
duction workers has risen 15 times as
fast as the number of production
workers.7 These figures serve to illus-
trate the second contention: that au-
tomation requires an upgrading of the
work force, at least over a long period
of time.
It is difficult to predict from past
performance how the national econ-
omy will react to automation in
the future. Nonetheless, such pre-
diction is necessary if the economy is
to be prepared for automation's in-
creasing impact. The U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor has made one of the
most quantitative studies yet of auto-
mation's effect on the national econ-
omy in their Manpower Report to the
President. In the report, they attempt
to chart the growth characteristics of
the labor forces of some 40 major in-
dustries over the next seven years. Al-
though the report makes no attempt
at predicting how much a given in-
dustry will grow or decline in the
number of employees, it does for the
first time make judgments as to which
of the industries will grow and which
will decline. The basis for these
judgments is a comparison of the esti-
mated labor-destroying effects of in-
creased automation as compared to
the expected labor-creating effects of
a growth in demand for the industry's
goods. Briefly, the results are as fol-
lows:
1) Fourteen industries have been
found to be increasing their de-
mand for labor. These industries
employ more than 50% of the
total number of workers in the
industries studied. All of these
industries are alike in one re-
spect: they all expect rapid
growth in demand over the next
seven years. Included are air
transportation, banking, elec-
tronic manufacturing, and insur-
ance industries.
2) Several industries are expected
to neither increase nor decrease
their demand for labor. Many
of these do expect a considerable
growth in demand for their
goods, but they also plan to au-
tomate extensively. The auto
and steel industries are the most
notable of this group.
3) Approximately 18 industries are
expected to decrease their de-
mand for labor between now
and 1970. Some plan on rapid
growth in demand for their
goods: the telephone industry
for one. But the increase in em-
ployee productivity for the tele-
phone industry is an estimated
5% per year. Other important
industries expected to decline in
number of employees are the
aerospace, foundry, oil refining,
and textile industries.
Generally, researchers have found
that no major industry which has
achieved 2.5% or better productivity
increase per year between 1957 and
1962 has been able to prevent a reduc-
tion in the work force, although de-
mand has risen. The effect is especial-
ly noticeable in agriculture in which
productivity has increased 3.5% per
year since 1957. The number of work-
ers employed in agriculture has fallen
considerably.
Some important general informa-
tion also emerges from the report.
The labor department states that
manpower will grow at an unprece-
dented clip between now and 1970—
up from 76 million in 1963 to 85 mil-
lion in 1970. An estimated 3.75 mil-
lion new jobs per year will have to
be created between now and 1970 to
bring unemployment down to 4%
and hold it there! At this time that
looks like an impossible task8
It is evident that automation does
decrease the demand for unskilled
and semi-skilled labor and that it does
require an upgrading of the work
force as a whole. Yet, the common
laborer need not completely despair.
First, it should be noted that the per-
formance required of the laborer in
an automated operation need not be
any more difficult than the perform-
ance required of him in a non-auto-
mated operation. In fact, exactly the
opposite has often been true. A sur-
vey of metal-working firms which had
recently automated reported that 43%
of the firms believed their new ma-
chinery required less skill than the
old, 30% thought there was no sig-
nificant change, and 27% believed
that the new machinery was more
difficult to operate. In another study
by Professors Mann and Williams of
the University of Michigan, automa-
tion of a plant employing 450 work-
ers was found to eliminate 50% of the

In order to maintain full employment with
increasing automation, the % increase in pro-
ductivity of the worker must be matched by the
seme % increase in tales, i.e. the locus of
points must be the 45° line. Snyder and Theo-
bold say we will necessarily lie below the line.
Ackley and Samuelson tay we will be able to lie
along the line, if we properly exercise our mon-
etary and fiscal tools. At the present, we proba-
bly lie somewhere below the line.
140 tasks required of workers before
automation. Another 30% of the tasks
were changed significantly, and 90%
of the workers, were affected. Yet no
significant upgrading of skills was
required in any of the cases. Similar
studies in the oil refining, airline,
bakery, and insurance industries have
led to the same result.9 The important
conclusion is that often no extensive
retraining is required within the cor-
poration, since little or no upgrading
of skill is necessary for the worker
who is merely displaced, but retained
on the payroll. However, for the
worker who is laid off as a result of
automation, retraining becomes an
absolute necessity.
One of the most difficult problems
that this nation must face is the dis-
placement of workers by automation.
The workers whose jobs are closed
out are the very individuals
whose lack of skills will keep
them from readily getting another
job. Whenever possible, industry
management attempts, and union
leadership requires, that displaced
workers be retrained for another job
within the company. When this is not
possible however, workers are laid off
and are often never rehired. In recent
years the service industry has picked
up some of the laid off workers, hav-
ing doubled in size while the goods-
producing industry grew only 4%.10
A few specific case studies will serve
to illustrate the situation. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor reports in a study of
the automation of a large oil com-
pany that 164 employees were directly
affected. Of this number, one was laid
off, 82 were able to stay in substan-
tially the same areas, and 81 were dis-
placed. Of the group of displaced
workers, 67 were reabsorbed in equal
or higher classifications, while 14
others retired or quit voluntarily. Sta-
tistics from the study of the Murray
Body Company were not as hearten-
ing, however. In 1954, 5000 workers
were released. One year later 29%
still had not found jobs. Most of the
workers in this group were older men,
women, and Negroes. The men over
45 were out of work an average of six
months, and 82% of them completely
used up their unemployment com-
pensation.11
Not all displacement due to auto-
mation need be as damaging to many
of the individual workers as was the
Murray Body Company situation.
The popular practice today is for
management to hold as closely as pos-
sible the rate of job elimination to
that of natural job attrition, due to
resignation, retirement, promotion, ill
health, etc. Through such practice the
individual worker is protected from
sudden economic collapse.11 But the
problem merely shifts then from the
worker who was fired to the worker
who will not be hired.
Experts disagree as to the magni-
tude of the effect that automation has
on national unemployment. At a
time when the economy is booming,
and sales and profits are breaking
records, unemployment still stands at
an uncomfortably high level. Automa-
tion is widely blamed as the culprit.
Yet a close perusal of the unemploy-
ment figures suggests that automation
may not be as significant a factor as
popularly thought. A study of the
total amount of unemployed workers
showed that of the 3,857,000 reported
unemployed in mid-1963, 986,000
were married men, 802,000 were mar-
ried women, and 206,000 were under
20 and looking for only part-time
work. Unemployment was highest
(10.2%) for the group under 25, and
was low (3.3%) for the group of
workers in their most productive
years, 25-65."
Gardner Ackley, Chairman of the
President's Council of Economic Ad-
visors, believes that automation is not
necessarily causing increased unem-
ployment. "We simply have not had
adequate markets for what we are
capable of producing." His belief is
based on the fact that our present dis-
tribution of unemployment is typical
of all past periods of unemployment:
i.e., young workers seeking their first
job, the unskilled, racial minorities,
etc.13 Other experts, however, inter-
pret the situation differently. John J.
Snyder, Jr., Chairman and President
of U.S. Industries, Incorporated, esti-
mates that 40,000 jobs per week are
lost to automation. The Labor De-
partment's current estimate stands at
200,000 per year.
Again the disagreement among the
experts is on the degree of the effect
that automation has. Both Ackley and
Snyder acknowledge that automation
does decrease the demand for com-
mon labor per unit of output. Ackley
says that this does not necessarily
mean unemployment must rise; it
merely means that more markets for
our goods and services must be cre-
ated. Snyder says that the United

articles on the future of the oceans
which cover more than 71 percent of
the world's surface. Oceanography is
indeed a very new and still infant
science. Though man has lived by,
sailed on and swum under the ocean
for oil, that have boosted profits as
well as natural reserves. However, the
most immediate field of study and im-
provement is that of the maritime in-
dustries.
Just as agricultural methods have
been radically improved over the last
decades, so a new concept aims at
changing and improving the ways of
gathering the ocean's harvest. This
new attitude is appropriately called
"aquiculture." As agriculture has be-
come so sophisticated as to use com-

rocks and rubble in specific areas of
the shallows to attract shellfish and
other forms of marine life, proved

surface, he knows only little more
about it now than he did many cen-
turies ago. As populations increase
and as distances across seas "de-
crease", industry and science are turn-
ing more and more towards the ex-
ploration of the vast and fruitful
waters for feeding an exploding popu-
lation, for defense, and for replenish-
ment of vital resources.
While huge amounts of money and
time are being spent on the conquest
of space, relatively small quantities
are going towards probing the sea. At
the present and for some time to
come, the novelty of space will com-
mand the "crash" projects and most of
the engineering fronts. However while
the stars are "brought nearer", the
momentarily less spectacular explora-
tion of the seas will be continued with
its long range goals to satisfy man's
mushrooming earth-bound needs.
After all, men who first establish out-
posts on the moon and planets will
only be as strong as their base, and a
good deal of this strength will have
to be taken from the oceans.
Although certain projects in the
oceans, such as dredging for diamonds,
do appear visionary, they will likely be
very profitable as technology is im-
proved. In fact, in the last decade
there have been many successful un-
dertakings, such as off-shore drilling
puters in farm management, so one
day soon aquiculture will use them
for gathering food from the oceans.
For the present, however, it would
require far less than a computer to
improve on the methods and equip-
ment that are currently used the
world over.
In fishing, the Soviet Union and
Japan have taken the largest, and the
most sensible steps of any great mari-
time nations. They have formed huge
fleets which have not only trawlers,
but also processing and storage ships
and tankers. They are therefore able
to gather far more fish and at much
cheaper costs. But modifying equip-
ment is only one aspect of aquiculture,
which includes stimulating the pro-
ductivity of the water, tracking and
"herding" fish, and inducing a favor-
able selectivity in the current species.
At the moment there are only a few
places that have seriously worked on
these new and challenging ideas. Yet
there has been such great success that
many small countries with very few
land resources are concentrating on
advanced marine experimental sta-
tions. Although these modern stations
have only recently been set up, over
the last few centuries several experi-
ments with the ocean have been con-
ducted. Ventures, such as introducing
grains of sand into certain oysters to
very successful. This importance of
the shallow waters that surround the
land masses for marine industries is
quickly being realized, for the total
areas of these continental shelves
equals more than the area of Asia.
The importance of so convenient a
breeding ground is easily seen. These
few aspects of aquiculture that are
currently being expanded are only a
small part of what the self-replenish-
ing storehouse can support, for the
amount of plant and animal matter
that the oceans contain far outweighs
that of the land.
In this stimulated productivity of
the ocean, there is the question of
where to start the process. The food
cycle is begun with the microscopic
life that swarms in the waters. This
mass of living organisms makes up
90 percent of life's material in the
oceans, and it is all generally termed
as plankton. It is only from relatively
modern study that plankton has been
established as the foundation of the
living pyramid of the sea. Although
the plankton has a very short life
span, it is eaten in great quantities by
small fish which are in turn eaten by
larger and still larger predators.
Wherever nutrients bubble up from
the depths to the lighter, warmer sur-
face, there the plankton are found;
and where the plankton are, so

Obviously then, if in aquiculture the
growth of plankton is increased, the
size and number of fish would also in-
crease.
It has been proposed that man sim-
ply by-pass the fish and gather up the
plankton directly for his nourishment.
However, Uiis proposal has too many
complications. For one, it would be
far too costly, due to the huge vol-
umes of sea water that would have to
be filtered and processed in order to
gather even a small amount of the
microscopic organisms. This cost is
easier to believe when confronted
with the fact that 10,000 pounds of
plankton must be processed in order
to equal the food value of one pound
of fish such as tuna. It is obvious that
the fish can do the job of converting
these protein to food much more effec-
tively and man can gather the benefits.
Therefore it appears far more fruit-
ful to stir up the nutrients and so
make the plankton more abundant.
However, the correct techniques for
doing this must be carefully con-
trolled, for even nature sometimes ap-
pears to be too efficient. For example,
a 75,000 sq. mile area of the Indian
Ocean is thickly littered with the de-
caying flesh of fish due to the over-
abundance of plankton which have
died before they can be eaten. As they
decompose, they rob the water of its
oxygen, and thus great numbers of
fish that are at first attracted by the
abundance of plankton are then suffo-
cated. By causing a turbulence and
physically raising up water with its
nutrients, the entire feeding pyramid
can be fruitfully enriched, but this
may only be successfully accomplished
by die effective study and improved
technological applications in the
many other facets of aquiculture.
To solve the mysteries of the ocean
and to successfully apply the new tech-
niques that are planned, the marine
biologists and oceanographers will
have to do far more research with
current prototypes than is presently
being done, for the Soviet Union
alone is well on its way to finding
the solutions and leaving the other
nations of the world far behind in
its wake. Scientists are only now tak-
ing steps to discover where and when
different species are during the year;
at what ages fish should be caught;
and what sizes of species are best for
the most yield to the commercial fish-
eries.
Up to now there has been only
one major step of any significance
taken and that is the large scale tag-
ging of all varieties of fish. Plastic
tags or small radioactive metal plates
are attached to the creatures, and
then these fish are easily picked out
when processed after the catch; there-
by, records of where and when they
were netted are furnished to the
marine institutes. Tracking the great
shoals of fish is made a little easier,
but as yet the mystery of where the
great numbers of fish go that sudden-
ly may vanish from a rich feeding
ground is still unsolved. Whether
these shoals dissappear because of
ocean currents as a result of ocean-
quakes, or because of actual learning
associations on the part of fish is not
yet known. It is interesting to note
that many species of fish have
"learned" to stay far away from a
diver armed with a harpoon, and ap-
parently, the longer die harpoon, the
farther away the fish will stay. There-
fore other proposed ways of tracking
die schools might be either using
midget submarines to follow the mass-
es, or listening to the shoals on hydro-
phones (sonar "pinging" equipment
only serves to frighten the migrating
fish).
Further methods for discovering
the habits of fish are by noting dieir
movements and at die same time the
changing temperatures and currents
in the oceans. Japan is probably the
leading nation that studies these phe-
nomena along with the varying plank-
ton count in oceans. But the scattered
outposts for recording these critical
measurements are few, and before the
oceanographer can do any definite
research, he must first be able to call
on many thousands of separate read-
ings. This can only be done by
positioning hundreds of low cost, un-
manned radio buoys which could send
readings of the conditions at regular
intervals. Still more plans involve the
use of heat sensitive infrared satellites
which could track the moving of
warm and cold currents far better
than large fleets of research vessels
could in the man seas.
The advance warnings that could be
given to areas effected by shifts in po-
sitions of these currents could prepare
to move their fleets to a predeter-
mined positions instead of being left
with empty holds and losing valuable
time in searching for the current.
Presently many nations are in fact
using their research ships to follow
the old and new currents in order to
find new shoals of fish. Many times
they have met success, and many tons
of fish have been quickly caught.
However, by merely searching out
fish and grabbing them all up, the
commercial fishing fleets are bringing
themselves closer to destruction along
with the rest of mankind. They are
rapidly depleting the commercial fish
population and too little is known
about the fish so as to enable any re-
plenishment of die once rich fishing
grounds of the world. Each nation is
trying to snatch the tastiest tidbits
from each other, but in doing so they
are actually endangering their fishing
industries.
Yet a few methods are currendy
being tested in order to help the rap-
idly diminishing numbers of popular
fish thrive again. Each method de-
pends upon bringing nutrients up
from the deep waters to the surface
waters. One approach is to submerge
small nuclear reactors at chosen
points and thereby create heated cur-

deeper water, thus increasing the nu-
tritional content of phytoplankton in
the upper layers. Ocean bodies that
have the characteristic barren blue-
colored waters, like the Mediterranean
Sea, could benefit from this form of
stimulation, for they lack these forms
of plankton. Blue waters are contrast-
ed with the green plankton-rich waters
where the sea creatures thrive. Further
research must of course be made into
the effects of nuclear waste dumping
a&gt; well as the construction of massive
reactor structures capable of surviving
the pressures of the ocean depth.
Another method of raising the lower
waters is by firmly anchoring long
chained buoys with blades attached
to the chains so that as the plankton-
rich currents flow by, the curved
blades will cause turbulances of water
to be pushed upward and therefore
enrich the protein-deficient surface
water. From these projected methods,
barren areas of ocean could become
plentifully rich in fish. But these vital
plans can only be used after further
investigation. At the moment, the
only nation that has oriented itself
towards this research is the Soviet
Union. The United States, along with
other Western nations has been left
far behind in applying these plans.
Only with greatly stepped up effort
can these nations ever hope to be on
equal terms with the Communist
countries.
France and Italy, through the urg-
ings of Jacques Yves-Cousteau, have
made significant progress in a new
concept called "stabling." It had long
been noticed that fish will congregate
around suken ships or wrecks, but on-
ly recently has this observation been
put to use. This was done off the
South European coast of the Mediter-
ranean Sea where structures were sunk
to depths of 300 to 400 feet. These
structures, some of concrete and some
of plastic, contain a few circular and
"holey" objects for luring eels, and
others have shapes that attract various
other species. At separate intervals,
these structures are chemically fertil-
ized, and when the attracted fish have
flourished sufficiently, the fisherman
may come and gather all they can.
The remaining fish will soon increase
in numbers, which recycle the system
of the fish farm. In his book Conquest
of the Sea, Mr. Troebst states that
"The ocean offers plenty of space in
which billions of creatures can thrive.
The whole human race could be fed
from the seas if they were farmed sci-
entifically, i.e. at various levels and
by bringing the regions as yet unde-
veloped under the oceanographer's
plough. Therefore, it is planned not
only to make the ocean deserts fertile
with giant agitators and nuclear reac-
tors, but also to introduce certain
species of fish into areas where they
were hitherto unknown. Large-scale
fish farms also could be established off
the coasts of certain countries, and
shelters in which different kinds of
fish would be kept like cattle in sheds
could be erected on the sea floor."1
However, transplanting species of
fish from one region to another re-
quires a great deal of research on the
conditions in the new area. For in-
stance fish, like all living organisms
are susceptible to viruses and disease,
and certain areas of the oceans con-
tain viruses not found elsewhere.
Therefore we must consider more
than just the natural enemies and
predators of a transplanted species.
Research is also carried out on
diseases because they can quickly
wipe out the concentrated members of
fish in any one of the "aquafarms".
There are many types of bacteria
which ravage entire fish populations,
among them are the "red tide"
(plankton like organisms that feed on
phosphates) and "sputnik grass"
which spreads over bay floors and kills
off creatures such as scollops. These
and many other bacteria may sudden-
ly appear in parts of the world where
they have never been found before,
and they therefore pose a very serious
problem for marine biologists who un-
til now are unable to fight them.
However, there are regions of the
C.—C. Troebst, The Conquest of the Sea,
p. 147.
ocean that are absolutely free of any
form of virus or bacteria. One such
area is west of Panama where marlin,
for example, which generally weigh
250 lbs. are commonly found weighing
an enormous 2500 lbs.! Here too the
common algae which are normally
quite short with flimsy stalks, have
length of several hundred yards and
"trunks" with 3 foot diameters. Most
biologists feel that the enormous sizes
are due to the longer life times that
the creatures can live because they
are totally free of germs. Regions like
these are, of course, under intense
study, for if chemicals can be pro-
duced to synthesize this environment,
the effects on small fish farms would
be staggering. But this research must
be conducted now so that it can grow
from its infantile stage of present de-
velopment, and to do so takes a great
deal of governmental and public back-
ing. Eventually this government sup-
port would have to materialize but
only when prices of present foods and
resources sky-rocket upward. By then
it will be far too late, for the popu-
lation will be increasing far too rapid-
ly for lagging nations to make up
their gaps.
Several nations, already aware of
the coming crises, have taken what
steps they can to ensure their own
prosperity. These are mostly nations
that either need large amounts of sea
food to provide for their populations,
or they are those whose economies de-
pend on commercial fishing, canning
and exporting. Already, since late
1959, several incidents have taken
place. When Iceland, which depends
entirely on its fish exports, extended
its boundary limit from four miles
to twelve miles, the British fishing
fleets immediately opposed the move,

respective fleets. Denmark, too, has
had run-ins with British trawlers, but
the most intensive conflicts are be-
tween the allied nations of Japan and
Korea. Korea has extended her coastal
limits to 200 miles, and annually con-
fiscates about thirty trawlers, catches,
and crews from the Japanese. Both
countries are using gunboats, radio
equipped trawlers and radar equipped
speedboats to detect one another and
to give the necessary warnings. A pri-
mary cause of the conflicts is the rapid
depletion of species of fish by com-
bined international activities. Yet
these species of commercially netted
fish only number twelve, and there
are over 25,000 other species of fish
that are fully as palatable, nutritional
and plentiful. Fishermen however are
extremely reluctant to change. As a
result, these incidents are merely in-
dications of what will happen if more
extensive marine research is not car-
ried on, especially by the United
States and Western countries, for Rus-
sia long realized the importance, and
she has left all other nations far be-
hind in oceanographic research.
Nations all over the world which have
huge under-nourished populations
and yet are washed by the sea have
little desire to change their diets, and
often they will only accept the new
food when it is forced upon them.
Yet, as proven in many countries like
Morrocco and India, once the popu-
lation discovers the nourishment in
sea foods for themselves, all aspects of
their lives and economies go up sharp-
ly. Still, those countries with the
largest research fleets are leading the
way rapidly, and very far away they
are from sluggish starters. In the
period from 1954 to 1959, the Soviet
Union trebled its fishing fleet. It is
now the largest and most modern and
most efficient of any in the world, and
it exceeds the United States' dated
fleet in number by 5:1.
Yet the size of a fleet is not the only
factor; the methods are most impor-
tant. The major fleets now use heli-
copters with elaborate sonar gear to
search for the large shoals of fish, thus
allowing the Russians to use their
technique of midget submarines to
net the entire school of fish, and
bring it to the factory ship while the
helicopters go on to search out more
fish. It was through the use of these
methods that the Russians gathered
up a newly-discovered American
"herd" of the much sought-after king
crabs in the Bering Straits during the
last few years, leaving the American
fleets with empty holds. Most of the
problem exists because Western fish-
ermen are skeptical of sonar and other
electronic devices and they refuse to
use them; whereas the Russians can
be forced to use the gear, and they are
most happy with it since it gives them
far larger catches in far less time.
The Russians also attract vast quanti-
ties of fish with underwater lights,
and then these fish are sucked directly
into the factory ships with such vol-
ume and economy as to revolutionize
the Soviet fishing industry. A new
German method is to attach an elec-
trode to the bottom of a suction pipe
and emit electric pulses of up to
20,000 amperes into the surrounding
waters. Fish within eighty to one hun-
dred and fifty feet of the electrode
are "attracted" to it immediately,
and they are quickly drawn up into
the pipe where further electric shock
kills them. This method is so simple
and economic that it will further
revolutionize commercial fishing. A
special advantages of this new process
is that the fish come naturally to the
suction pipe and are then killed in-
stantly, whereas in ordinary methods
the fish fight the nets so much before
they die that they build up large
amounts of lactic acid which destroys
much of the fish flavor. Also different
sizes and species of fish are attracted
by different intensity pulses, and
therefore a desired type may be caught
even though it is in an area where
other species are present. By using
these mammoth catching techniques,
an adequate catch can be processed
and stored in a short period of time
to allow other crews to prepare and
replant the fished region for the next
season. There are other plans such as
self-propelled submersible trawls and
electronic "beaters" which line up
fish of certain species between two
electrodes and point them towards a
central pump or net.
Not only are new devices being
built and tested, but new concepts
directly associated with the ocean-
ographer's talents are being planned.
These are the building of huge sea
dams to alter the course of ocean
currents and therefore change climatic
conditions on arid or frozen land
masses. The use of these currents is,
however, very risky because no knowl-
edge is yet available on the interaction
of individual currents with the whole
system. It is easily seen that by alter-
ing the flow of the Labrador Current
to force the Gulf Stream nearer to the
North American continent we cause
it to cease bringing the warmer winds
and climate to the British Isles, North-
ern Europe and Norway. For these
countries it could mean disaster.
Since little is known about the causes
of the powerful ocean currents any
steps could drastically effect the
world's climates. Until recently it was
not known that the plankton-rich
Gulf Stream waters that flow north
and east from the Gulf of Mexico was
merely a surface current, and very
strong currents flow in exactly the
opposite direction underneath it. In
fact, most deep sea currents are 1000
times stronger than the Rhine, the
Nile and even the mighty Amazon
River. The Russians have done ex-
tensive investigation of the deep-sea
currents in recent years, and where
this deep water was expected to be
sluggish and stagnant, it is revealed
to be very swift moving. Much of this
research is of course for military pur-
poses, for it is easy to see that exten-
sive use of the ocean currents by sub-
marines could place them any where
on the globe within a very short time,
and they could then return by other
countercurrents before any measures
could be taken. The same approach
can also be used to speed up submar-
ine shipping in the future. Thus the
ever-increasing need for detailed maps
and charts of the ocean floor and the
ocean currents is further extended.
While the bickerings and conflicts
for fishing rights and applications of
research to military advantages goes
on, marine biologists are struggling
along the verges of discovering many
foods and live-saving drugs from the
common plants and creatures of the
sea. Algae are the several types of
plants in the class of sea weed. They
are in the lowest division on the veg-
etable kingdom scale, but in many
ways they are uniquely outstanding.
Only 3 percent of the land is usable
for food production, and as the world
population climbs higher, this area
will feed fewer and fewer people. The
cultivation of algae is thought to be
the future relief to the pressing food
and protein deficiency. Algae is almost
100 percent useable protein and car-
bohydrates as compared to the 5-10
percent of land plants. It can be har-
vested fifty times a year in a single
area, whereas crops such as wheat can
yield only one crop per year. When

WEIGHT
LESS
by Niel Amalfitano
The weightless state probably repre-
sents the most important and complex
of the space environment unknowns. Re-
lated physical engineering problems ap-
pear to have solutions. However, at this
point it is impossible to predict whether
man, as we know him, can survive the
psychophysiological effects of prolonged
weightlessness—and then re-adapt to grav-
ity forces at the end of his voyage or in
time of emergency.
The effects of prolonged weightlessness
on the human system are profound. Most
of man's physiology depends on gravity
for its proper orientation and function.
Delicate muscular counterbalance, and
counterforces, tonus of smooth internal
muscles, orientation of the heart, and
respiration functions are all geared to
gravity. Removal of man from gravity can
lead to deterioration of muscles, bones,
and the circulatory system. It can also
render present receptor stimulation pat-
terns useless and can upset fluid balance
and psychoneurological functions.
Space medical research is extensive.
Actual testing can be broken down into
two areas. These areas concern (1) pro-
viding a prolonged weightless or simu-
lated zero-g environment and (2) estab-
lishing and performing valid, extensive
biomedical and behavioral tests. Eventual-
ly these tests should determine man's
adaptability to and his ability to recover
from the weightless state. Upon conduct-
ing an analysis of the weightlessness study
program NASA (National Aeronautics
and Space Administration) scientists con-
cluded that at least six men would have
to survive weightlessness for one year to
assure safety of interplanetary voyages.
Weightlessness is not so far up in
the air as one might think. Anyone
who has ridden an elevator or roller
coaster, or has fallen a great distance,
say from an airplane (or in love), has
experienced it. I happen to have had
the opportunity to experience it for
a brief fifteen seconds while flying
a parabolic flight in a T-33 jet trainer
(a parabolic flight path is illustrated
in figure one). The resulting feeling
was unreal, but at the same time, ex-
hilerating.
Gravity is a mutual attraction be-
tween bodies. One actually feels the
manifestation of gravity only if some-
thing impairs him from moving to-
ward the gravitating body. In free
fall (falling towards a gravitating
body unimpaired, or beyond the
fringe of gravitational attraction) a
body experiences no restricting force
—neither compressive nor tensile
forces act on the body. While going
up in a fast-moving elevator, one ex-
periences some degree of free fall at
the instant the elevator reaches the
crest of its ascent. The individual
maintains an upward velocity for an
instant. During this he is undergoing
a downward acceleration as a result
of gravitational attraction. He doesn't
experience the manifestation of grav-
ity until he "falls" back to the im-
pairing floor of the elevator. In orbit,
the attraction of gravity equals the
centripetal force necessary to keep the
body on a curving path. Hence, the
body experiences no gravitational
"pull." When an individual drops
from a height he undergoes free fall
(feels no manifestation of gravity) un-
til air resistance prevents him from
accelerating as fast as gravity wants
him to.

serious attention during and after
World War Two as airplanes flew
faster and pilots experienced the phe-
nomenon on a day to day basis. Dur-
ing the Anglo American strategic
bombing raids, German pilots under-
went zero gravity for brief periods
while maneuvering to bring down
enemy bombers. The German inter-
ceptors would dive from higher alti-
tudes and then would pull out to
coast up to a position underneath the
vulnerable belly of the B-17. While
coasting upward the pilot would be
flying in the initial leg of a weightless
parabolic similar to the one shown
in the figure. Unfamiliar pilots tended
to overshoot the target, thus exhibit-
ing (as later discovered) a common
psychoneurological reaction to the
state.
Extensive parabolic arc flights in
fighter, experimental, and cargo
planes have yielded valuable infor-
mation on brief exposure to weight-
lessness. The suborbital flights and
orbital flights of Russian and Ameri-
can Astronauts revealed much infor-
mation, but only enough to show that
just the surface has been scratched in
this area of space medical research.
Psychophysiological Effects
According to Dr. Hubertus Strug-
hold, renowned space physiologist,
"The cardiovascular system is the
'Achilles Heal' of astronauts after pro-
longed weightless flights." This state-
ment is substantiated by the experi-
ences of Soviet and American astro-
nauts. Both Cooper and Schirra un-
derwent othostatic hypotension (a
pooling of blood in the legs and ex-
tremities) during re-entry after orbit-
ing thirty-four and nine hours re-
spectively.
During prolonged periods of
weightlessness the pulse rate and
blood pressure drop. This change
takes place soon after the system ad-
justs to zero gravity. Decreased tonus
of muscle in the cardiovascular cavity
could lead to re-orientation of the
heart along one of its axes. Extended
exposure could lead to further de-
conditioning of a more complex na-
ture. For instance, the tone of the
arterial walls could deteriorate due to
lack of exercise and protracted periods
at lower blood pressures.
A second de-conditioning phenom-
enon takes place in the skeletal and
smooth muscles of the body. It is esti-
mated that one third to one half of
the energy used up by the body is
expended as work done against grav-
ity. Thus the body finds itself in an
unusual situation when there is no
gravity to work against. After water
immersion-bed rest tests, it was ob-
served that there may be a loss of
actual muscle tissue accompanied by a
reduction in the size and strength of
most skeletal muscles. It would seem
possible that decreased tonus of
smooth, organ supporting muscle
might lead to significant deteriora-
tion. Subsequent performance of per-
istalsis and similar functions would
then be less efficient. Water immersion
bed rest tests are commented on in
the following pages.
Further complications arise when
we consider that the muscle system
functions under an intricate counter-
balance network in conjunction with
the autonomous and central nervous
systems. Relaxation of antigravity
muscles may greatly influence some
aspects of coordination. So far, it ap-
pears that in-flight adjustments can
be made without considerable diffi-
culty. However, re-adaptability may
be more severe. Therefore, highly sci-
entific in-flight exercises may be nec-
essary.
A third instance of system misfunc-
tion concerns deterioration of bone
structure. Prolonged relaxation ex-
periments have disclosed loss of bone
calcium deposits. The deterioration
process is somewhat complex and, as
yet, not all the ramifications are
known. So far, urine and blood analy-
sis show actual bone structure depos-
its. It is expected that X-rays in space
—as part of the battery of biomedical
experiments—will shed some light on
the actual process.
It may still be possible to maintain
bone health thru complex exercise
methods. Whether exercise alone will
be sufficient is part of the question.
A fourth primary consideration was
the ingestion, digestion, excretion
cycle. Limited observations are reas-
suring in the first two instances. Ap-
parently man can ingest liquids and
semi-liquids easily, although swallow-
ing is a little unusual at first. Also,
the digestive system seems unim-
paired by weightlessness. However, in
the third instance, we find that the
urinary phase of the excretory func-
tion poses an interesting and some-
what serious problem. Without the
influence of gravity the pressure (full
feeling) usually experienced in the
bladder doesn't occur, resulting in the
absence of micturition, that is, the
need to urinate. While voiding urine,
the astronaut doesn't experience the
sensation. This can be serious in as
much as incomplete voidance can
lead to urinary infection. In the last
analysis, it may be necessary to insti-
tute a rigid schedule in regard to this
function.
We have briefly touched upon the
physiological aspects of weightlessness.
In addition, there are some rather
complex psychological aspects to be
considered along with these physio-
logical areas. The actual psychology
of the weightless individual is inter-
twined with such intricate factors as
environment, fatigue, earth break-
away realization, and boredom since
there hasn't been room in space vehic-
les for any extensive experimentation.
These factors are much too involved
for the scope of this paper. However,
a few of the psychoneurological func-
tions can be discussed.
The psychoneurological aspects can
be broken down into three areas: (1)
balance, (2) judgment, and (3) co-
ordination. All three areas are con-
nected with orientation. The first, bal-
ance, is a function of information cor-
related from several body systems.
The vestibular senses in the ear, the
eyes, and the anti-gravity muscles are
among those involved. In some in-
stances tactile and audio information
may be incorporated into the balance
mechanism. Without gravity the ma-
jor portion of man's balance mechan-
ism is useless and he must depend pri-
marily on his eyes for orientation. It
is possible that severe disorientation
can occur leading to nausea and ver-
tigo. It appears that man can adjust
to the situation, but some stipulations
may be requisite for optimum per-
formance.
It has been noted that, while he
is weightless, an individual's judg-
ment of distance and position is in-
fluenced. As cited earlier, this phe-
nomenon was experienced extensively
by German interceptor pilots during
World War Two. Generally, weight-
lessness experiments show that man
tends to judge high, not just in terms
of muscular coordination (as men-
tioned earlier), but in terms of
actual over-estimation. Fortunately,
this difficulty disappears when famil-
iarity is achieved. In fact, it appears
that man can adjust in all three areas
once certain stipulations are met.
Three important stipulations are that
the astronaut must, (1) undergo in-

tensive prior training and condition-
ing, (2) be restrained in some manner,
and (3) have a frame of reference.1
Up to now we've discussed several
important aspects of space psycho-
physiology. As yet, we haven't consid-
ered the most complex aspect, i.e.,
sex.
At present, sex in space is a rela-
tively barren issue, since there hasn't
been room in space vehicles for any
extensive experimentation. Soviet
fruit flies (Cosmoflies) which were
sent aloft with Cosmonauts mated
after five days in space.2 The unions
resulted in offspring which were es-
pecially long in hatching. Examina-
tion of young flies disclosed a signifi-
cant imbalance favoring females over
males. In addition, genetic mutations
which don't occur on earth were
noted. Whether the abnormalities re-
sulted from high gravity load during
launch and re-entry, weightlesness, or
radiation is still a question. There-
fore, little can be concluded. Current-
ly, there is practically no speculation
as to the potential effects of zero-g on
sex and/or man's life.
To summarize, we can see that lit-
tle is known compared to what must
be learned before man is prepared for
an interplanetary voyage. Some of the
more prominent psychophysiological
effects have been presented. Certainly,
the whole picture is much more ex-
tensive and complex. For this reason
intensive research has been under-
taken. This research is outlined in the
following paragraphs. Such future ex-
ploits as Gemini (the two-man space
probe), the manned orbital laboratory
(MOL), and the Apollo will place pri-
mary priority on weightlessness stud-
ies. International committees, hope-
fully, will continue to work together
to solve problems in this and other
areas
Actual testing can be broken down
into two broad areas. The first one
concerns the actual environment and
the physical approach to the experi-
ment. This comprises past, present,
and future facilities which place the
subject in a zero gravity or simulated
aero gravity situations. Examples of
the former consist of parabolic zero-g
flight curves, sub-orbital, and orbital
missions. Water immersion coupled
with bed rest and inactivity comprises
the latter. The second area concerns
1 Physiology of Man in Space, p. 210.

p. 47.
the biomedical and behavioral tests
which astronauts undergo before, af-
ter, and during containment in the
weightless environment. These tests
range from involved endurance and
orientation tests to complex organic
and psychological tests.
A detailed discussion of procedures
or results in either area is beyond the
scope of this paper. The reader is in-
vited to consult the references for
more information.
The first weightlessness environ-
ment was achieved by flying various
aircraft thru parabolic arcs. Advanced
type aircraft, such as the X-15 and
F-104, have enabled aviators to fly
larger curves, thus increasing duration
of zero-g. Large, higher speed cargo
planes such as the C-135 enable sci-
entists to observe more than one sub-
ject in a more spacious (space-type)
situation. For a detailed analysis of
the Keplerian physics involved here,
the reader should consult University
Physics by Sears and Zemansky.
The water immersion environment
is a contrived situation which stimu-
lates the relaxed, equal force aspect
of zero-g. When used in conjunction
with bed rest, continuous inactivity is
provided. Water exerts almost equal
pressure on all portions of the im-
mersed body (this is why it is possible
to lose up-down orientation in the
depths). The most advanced tank, is a
horizontal cylindrical tank which
rotates on a turntable and its center
axis to help distribute water pressure
more evenly and also to further disor-
ient the subject.
This procedure is convenient be-
cause the experiment can run for any
duration. The subject can be removed
at any time to undergo a battery of
tests.
Scientists have found that long ex-
posure leads to a lack of need for any
sleep at all. Much of the already dis-
cussed physiological deterioration was
observed and detected thru this ex-
periment. However, the experiment
falls short of actual weightlessness and
leaves many questions to be answered
thru space operations.
Space operations are represented in
the past Mercury project and in
planned projects such as Gemini.
Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL),
and Apollo. Mercury suborbital
flights provided about six minutes of
weightlessness. The longest Mercury
orbital flight (Cooper's) lasted for
thirty-four hours. The Gemini cap-
sule is to be launched some time in
1965 and will support two astronauts
in orbit for several days. The Gemini
vehicle is somewhat similar to the
Mercury capsule.
The Manned Orbital Laboratory
(MOL) will be launched some time in
1968 and will carry a crew of two to
six astronaut-scientists. The Apollo
(moon shot) project doesn't have a
definite target date as yet.
If it is found that gravity is desir-
able, provisions are being planned so
that the Manned Orbital Laboratory
can be coupled to the last stage of its
Saturn booster and then rotated about
an axis perpendicular and passing
thru the center of mass of the con-
necting tower. Eventually a 24 man
space station will be constructed
which will have a rotating outer rim

TO CAREER WITH DELCO RADIO
FROM CAMPUS
Just 10 years ago. Max Stanton
received his BA in Physics from
Indiana University.
Today, Max is a senior project
engineer at Delco Radio Division
of General Motors Corporation in
Kokomo, Indiana.
Max is shown above analyzing
gas ambients found in sealed tran-
sistor enclosures. The system—a
residual gas analyzer—is pumped
down to a low vacuum with an
absorption tank and vacion pump.
Then a transistor is punctured and
the gas introduced into the analy-
zer. Using mass spectrographic
techniques, an analysis of the con-
stituents through mass number 80
can be made. Such analyses are
helpful in the study of surface ef-
fects in solid state devices.
Max Stanton has established a
challenging and satisfying career
with Delco—the electronics divi-
sion of General Motors. As a young
graduate engineer, you, too, could

EDUCATION
AND
RESEARCH
by Paul Niffenegger
Desalinization
The United States government
is spending several million dollars
this year for research on essentially
the same problem that causes scale in
the bottom of your teakettle. The
U.S. Department of Interior isn't as
concerned about the nation's tea-
kettles, of course, as it is about find-
ing new sources of fresh water for ex-
panding populations and relatively
decreasing water supplies.
Scientists are presently exploring
ways to convert sea water by remov-
ing the salts. Interior's Office of Saline
Water has built three pilot plants—at
San Diego, Freeport, Tex., and Ros-
well, N.M.—to test ways of doing this
by evaporation. Other methods, such
as freezing and membrane filtering,
are also being tried.
The big obstacle in evaporation
processes is the teakettle problem-
heat causes scale to form on the
heated surface. Made up of the salts
in the water, the scale cuts efficiency
at a critical point in the process, and
interferes with one of OSVV's prime
concerns: to cut costs so iliey will be
competitive with fresh water costs.
At the moment, conversion costs
have been brought down to between
75 cents and a dollar per thousand
gallons, while fresh water at-the-plant
costs range around 10 to 15 cents for
the same amount. OSW's goal is 25
cents.
One of the key research efforts to
cut costs by increasing efficiency and
performance is being made at The
University of Michigan, where similar
research on scale has been going on
for some 40 years.
Such are the difficulties encountered
in sea water conversion that Prof. J.
Louis York, the U-M project director,
says, "if we can knock a nickel off the
cost of a thousand gallons, it is an
engineering accomplishment."
The problem—scale—is easy to cure
once it occurs: "Just boil it out with
acid," York says, "as you boil scale
out of your kettle with vinegar. How-
ever, we want to know how to keep
it off."
Not only are shutdowns for scale
removal expensive, but scale buildup
cuts heat transfer through the pipes
and thereby lowers efficiency. The
higher the operating temperature of
the unit, the more efficient they are,"
York points out. At present, operation
is limited to about 250 degrees (F)
by the crusty sea water deposits.
"If we can just push temperatures
to 300 degrees," he continues, "we
could improve efficience 25 per cent."
What causes these salts to form and
foul pipes? That's precisely what
York and three graduate students are
trying to learn.
The most troublesome isn't com-
mon salt (sodium chloride), although
it primarily gives sea water its briny
tang, but rather the calcium and mag-
nesium salts, which are relatively in-
soluble. They may form scale in three
different ways. First, calcium sulfate
(commonly known as gypsum or plas-
ter of Paris), magnesium hydroxide
(the basic constituent of milk of mag-
nesia), and calcium carbonate (lime-
stone) can collect and stick to pipe
surfaces as vapor boils off. And boil-
ing vapor off, of course, is the objec-
tive of the evaporation process.
Complexity increases in the second
means because calcium salts have "re-
verse solubility"—they are more in-
soluable in hot water. But the hottest
parts in these pipes are nearest the
tube walls, and that is where the
greatest scale-forming can take place
and where it does most damage.
Finally, calcium carbonate may be


boiled out of the water, upsetting the
balance and causing residue to solid-
ify.
U-M research on these has taken
several approaches under seven years
of OSVV support. Until 1962 the en-
gineers evaporated special solutions
and shipped-in sea water in a helical
(spiral) evaporator with glass walls so
they could watch scale form as they
tried to find what caused it. The sea
water changed in shipment, however,
as micro-organic life died and upset
the chemical balance.
David R. Johnson is working on the
chemical energy transformations, the
chemical actions and the heat transfer
effects occurring as calcium sulfate
changes form. Calcium sulfate is the
greatest offender because it gets hard-
er than the others.
Bernard J. Schorle is studying the
nucleation—or the first jump of com-
bination of individual molecules out
of solution into the tiniest solid par-
ticles—of super-abundant salt mole-
cules in liquid.
The third approach, by Glen C.
Smith, now nearing completion, shows
a substantial improvement in knowl-
edge, York says. Smith studied the
deposition of calcium sulfate from the
liquid state onto surfaces, using solu-
tions made from pure water.
"He has sorted out the variables,"
York explains, "and for the first
time we know exactly what these salts
will do under certain conditions.
"Before," he points out, "it was pretty
much trial and error."
The next step is to move to sea
water. "If we knew these variables
for sea water, then we ought to be
able to treat scale or prevent it. We
hope to understand these processes
widely enough so we can set operating
limits so the conversion plant oper-
ator will have a range to stay within."
Hopefully, this is being approached,
slowly but inexorably, by research at
such places as Oak Ridge National
Laboratories, the University of Cali-
fornia, and Monsanto Chemical Co.,
as well as at the University of Mich-
igan.
Professor Dow Honored
Founding laboratories, establishing
courses, refining techniques, and writ-
ing books, as well as educating elec-
trical engineers, have occupied Prof.
William G. Dow during his 38 years
on The University of Michigan fac-
ulty.
The profound effect all this has had
on the University and the electrical
engineering profession was reflected
Thursday and Friday (Dec. 3-4) in a
unique seminar held at the U-M in
Professor Dow's name, a month be-
fore his retirement.
Entitled "New Research Frontiers
in Physical Electronics," the seminar
was described as "a fitting tribute to
the widespread influence that Pro-
fessor Dow has exerted on physical
electronics, and other fields as well."
U-M officials could not recall a similar
seminar previously being held to hon-
or a retiring U-M faculty member.
PROF. WILLIAM G. DOW
The seminar attracted some of the
top men in the field. Among these
were many whom Professor Dow has
taught, and many with whom he has
worked. They included Dr. Fred Ter-
man, provost of Stanford University
and widely-known sokesman for elec-
trical engineering; Dr. J. A. Morton,
vice president of the Bell Telephone
Laboratories; and Dr. Joseph A. Boyd,
president of Radiation, Inc. and for-
mer director of the U-M Institute
of Science and Technology.
Others included Dr. G. R. Brewer,
head of the electron dynamics depart-
ment of Hughes Research Labora-
tories; Dr. J. E. Keto, chief scientist of
the Air Force Aeronautical Systems
Division; and Dr. Joseph E. Rowe, di-
rector of the U-M Electron Physics
Laboratory.
A paper on "Generation and Con-
trol of Gigwatt Pulses at Microwave
Frequencies" was given by Dr. Daniel
G. Dow, Professor Dow's son.
Professor Dow's contributions to
teaching electrical engineering were
recognized last year by the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engi-
neers Medal in Electrical Engineering
Education. They extend back to 1929
when, just after joining the faculty,
Professor Dow introduced a course in
physical electronics at the U-M which
has been required of all undergrad-
uate students in electrical engineering
ever since.
In 1937 he published a textbook,
"Fundamentals of Engineering Elec-
tronics," which was called "the first
usable textbook in electronics" and
was used widely for many years there-
after.
At the U-M, he was one of the
initators of the Willow Run Labora-
tory (now part of the Institute of
Science and Technology), and within
the department started the work of
several laboratories. Along with the
Willow Run labs, these—the Space
Physics Laboratory, Electronic Physics
Laboratory and Cooley Electronics
Laboratory—have made significant
contributions to this nation's electron-
ics national defense and space pro-
grams.
He was made chairman of the de-
partment in 1958.
During World War II, Professor
Dow directed work on radar counter
measures (or jamming) for the radio
research laboratory at Harvard Uni-
versity. He was also a member of the
Vacuum Tube Development Com-
mittee of the National Defense Re-
search Committee.
In 1946, immediately after these
World War II efforts, Professor Dow
was one of a few farsighted engineers
and scientists who founded the U.S.
Rocket and Satellite Research Panel.
He was elected a fellow of both the
Institute of Radio Engineers and the
American Institute of Electrical En-
gineers before both were merged into
their present structure, the Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engi-
neers. The IEEE medal exemplifies
what those at the seminar recognize,
that Professor Dow "is one of the
truly eminent teachers of our time."
Computer Counter
Like many other scientists these
days, physicists who study the struc-
ture and forces inside the atom are
being overwhelmed by information.
Also like many other scientists,
University of Michigan physicists have
turned to the computer for at least a
partial solution to the problem by
making it examine photographs for
them.
Physicists study the insides or nuclei
JANUARY 1965

with streams of accelerated particles
which scatter the nuclear particles.
Because these are much too small to
be seen, physicists make photographs
of the tracks of the scattered particles
and study them for information about
the particles that made the tracks.
Tracks are usually produced in either
a bubble chamber or a spark chamber.
In spark chambers, to which the
U-M development applies, thin plates
with electrical charges on them are
spaced a short distance apart in a box-
like chamber filled with neon gas. A
particle zipping through the gas
creates an ioni/ed path along which
an electric spark leaps from plate to
plate. Thus illuminated, the particle
path is photographed.
But explains U-M Prof. Donald I.
Meyer, "We are faced with a terrific
problem. We are taking on the order
of a million pictures or so each year
and have to measure these to find the
position of the tracks. These pictures
are made on the particle accelerators
over a period of a week or so, at the
rate of one a second. It takes, how-
ever, some 10 to 15 minutes for a tech-
nician to read and interpret a single
frame—about 100 technician-years for
our yearly output."
But Professor Meyer and four U-M
graduate students believe they have at
least a partial solution to the problem,
for their computer can scan the pic-
tures nearly as fast as the particle
accelerator produces them.
Meyer gives most of the credit for
the device—called the Michigan Au-
tomatic Scanning System (MASS)—to
student Kurt Fauser, Alfred Saulys,
Richard Allen and Peter CFoebel. The
Atomic Energy Commission sponsored
the work.
Because each picture contains more
information than their relatively
small computer can handle, the com-
puter was programmed to search only
those places on the photographs where
spark trails of specific interest might
appear. The computer "looks" at the
photographs by means of a cathode
ray tube (similar to a TV picture
tube) and a photomukiplier (a device
which measures light intensity).
The position of the cathode ray
tube scanning beam is precisely
known so that each light measure-
ment by the photomukiplier is for a
specific spot on the film. Thus precise
locations of light parts (clear film)
and dark spots (possible tracks) on
the film are found and fed to the
computer. Meyer explained, "we
want to know the precise position of
the spark (track) on the film and op-
tics always has distortions."
The information goes onto mag-
netic tape and is run through a large
digital computer which processes the
location data and mathematically re-
constructs the nuclear event which
produced the tracks. Using mathema-
tics, physicists can better understand
the parts and forces of the interior of
the atom.
While the system works well for
spark chambers, the automatic sorting
is not yet sufficiendy advanced for use
with bubble chambers, Meyer ex-
plained: "The automatic scanning of
bubble chamber pictures is perhaps
five or six years off."
Similar systems are being devel-
oped for spark chambers at several
other institutions, including the
Argonne National Laboratory, the
University of California (at Berke-
ley), and MIT. None however, is at
the stage of development of the U-M
device.

The new IBM 1800 data acquisition and control system can be used to monitor
and control continuous production processes. The protograph illustrates how
the system might appear when controlling a steam-generating plant. Designed
with an extensive group of pluggable packages of circuitry (the rectangles shown
on the front of the computer) and peripheral computer equipment, the 1800
system can gather information at the rate of 8 million bits a second from analog
and digital measuring devices.
This "aqua-hamster," penned in a
submerged plastic tank, is kept alive by
an artificial "gill"—a special synthetic
membrane stretched across the top,
bottom, and two sides of its underwater
home. The "gill" extracts air from the
surrounding water, while resisting the
passage of the liquid. Carbon dioxide
exhaled by the hamster passes out
through the membrane, dissolves in the
water, and is carried away. Without the
"gill," the animal would suffocate. The
membrane—an extremely thin film of
silicone rubber that is also free from
holes—was invented by Dr. Walter L
Robb (rear), a scientist at the General
Electric Research Laboratory. Tubes at
left are used to circulate water through
the outer fish tank. Since sea water is
essentially saturated with air to a depth
of many hundreds of feet, an artificial
"giU" made from the new membrane
could furnish air for the crew of a sub-
marine or the inhabitants of an under-
water experimental station.

States is not at the present creating
enough markets to consume all that
we are able to produce. Thus, he feels
that 2 million jobs per year are being
lost to automation.14
Most of the plans proposed as solu-
tions to the automation problem are
aimed directly or indirectly at creat-
ing enough markets for the goods and
services that United States industry is
able to produce. Professor Paul Sam-
uelson of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology feels that automation
need not present an insurmountable
problem to the economy of the
United States. He feels that the tools
which the economy possesses at the
present time are fully adequate to
combat increasing unemployment due
to the higher productivity of the
worker. Increased government spend-
ing, greater ease of borrowing money
due to expansionary Federal Reserve
policy, and tax cuts will sufficiently
stimulate investment and spending to
allow displaced workers to be rehired.
The important thing is that govern-
ment fiscal and monetary policy keep
pace with the growth of automation.
An attendant increase in the national
debt is not something to be greatly
feared in his opinion.15
Some experts are less optomistic,
though. Robert Theobold, consulting
economist to the United Nations
sounds a real alarm. He believes that
"the time has come to set up a simple,
clear-cut principle which will be
philosophically central to the cyber-
nated era in the same way that the
pursuit-of-profit principle was central
to the industrial age"1" Theobold
believes that in a highly automated
society the market-type economy will
not function efficiently to distribute
income among the workers. He pro-
poses that every American be guar-
anteed the right to an income that
will allow him to live with dignity.
The Research Institute of America
concurs. The Institute warns that gov-
ernment, labor, and industry are un-
prepared for the approaching crisis.17
Other economists, more dedicated
to capitalism as the American eco-
nomic way of life, propose a capitalist
solution to the same problem for
which Theobold proposes his socialist
solution. They would institute a
profit-sharing plan, placing the own-
ership of U.S. industry in the hands
of the workers. Such a program would
then allow the workers to live off
their dividends as their job incomes
fell. As a possible indication of the
attractiveness of this sort of plan, it
is interesting to note that profit-shar-
ing programs are already growing at
the rate of 5000 per year in the United
States. Some change in government
policy would be required, of course,
Mortimer Adler and Louis Kelso in
their book "The New Capitalists" sug-
gest that the government guarantee
bank loans for new stock acquisition.
Regardless of the details, however,
with proper government tax policy
and a few new laws, a massive redis-
tribution of equity property could be
effected, thereby allowing the laborer
to do his part in creating the markets
necessary for health in an automated
economy.18
The above-mentioned proposals are
designed as solutions to the first of
the noted effects of automation on the
economy, i.e. the decrease in the de-
mand for common labor as a result of
the increased productivity of the indi-
vidual worker. The function of these
proposals is to create markets to keep
employment high. They will be of no
help, however, in solving the prob-
lems raised by the second of automa-
tion's effects on the economy, i.e. the
need for a continual upgrading of the
work force as a whole. Only through
education can the quality of the work
force be raised. For this reason, re-
training programs of many types must
be instituted along with the various
market-creating programs, if economic
health is to be maintained.
Today, retaining programs exist in
many forms. The new Federal anti-
poverty program is basically a package
of educational projects, aimed at a
few hundred thousand of the so-called
hard core employment cases. Privately
run retraining programs are also gain-
ing impetus. Labor unions are push-
ing for education among their mem-
bers and even instituting schools of
their own. The United Automobile
Workers union teaches design-mold-
ing to ex-mechanics. A Southern Cali-
fornia machinists union is even en-
couraging study of literature and psy-
chology. One of their courses is titled
Oedipus—Myth and Complex. The
same union members are learning how
to run tape-controlled machinery.
Much of the civil rights effort is now
directed toward education rather than
demonstration. The Urban League
and CORE both attempt to get Ne-
groes more jobs by making them
aware of their rights as U.S. citizens,
and by instilling in them the confi-
dence and determination they need in
order to become successful job appli-
cants. In addition, some illiterates are
being taught how to read and write.
Private corporations, also, are un-
dertaking retraining programs for
their displaced workers. One com-
pany's contract with electrical work-
ers now states that a 40-hour work
week will consist of 32 hours on the
job and 8 hours in company-taught
courses.19 Further education for tech-
nical employees has long been en-
couraged. Most companies now have
some program whereby employees
may receive the cost of tuition and
fees for courses they take in colleges
and universities.
Retraining programs have proved
to be effective in solving the problem
of the worker made obsolete by auto-
mation. They are likely to become an
increasingly important part of the
war against unemployment due to the
displacement of workers.
Automation promises the people of
the United States many of the dreams
of President Johnson's "Great Society"
—IF handled correctly. It promises
greater leisure time for all working
citizens, though perhaps less leisure
for the professional than for the lab-
orer. It promises great efficiency in
the production of goods and services,
with the consequent saving of natural
resources of all kinds. It promises an
end to the monotonous, repetitive
chores which dull the mind and spirit
of many workers today. And it prom-
ises unprecendented opportunity for
education of all sorts, for all citizens.
But, automation will bring with its
benefits new challenges to the Amer-
ican people. America will be chal-
lenged to make good use of its new-
found leisure. Idle hands and minds
may foster crime, especially among
the uneducated. Busy hands and
minds may foster civilization. America
will be challenged to divide its
wealth among all its citizens; and all
American citizens will be challenged
to accept the tasks and responsibilities
which are requisite to that wealth.
Finally, America will be challenged
to fully utilize its expanding oppor-
tunities for education. Housewives
and laborers will need to study non-
technical and technical subjects for
self-enrichment and national-enrich-
ment. High schools will need to grad-
uate 100% of their entering freshmen.

will need constant retraining.
Americans will not be able to neg-
lect the challenges which automation
presents them, because Americans can
not neglect automation. Automation
must solve the problems of increasing
population and increasing foreign
competition. As such, it is inevitable.
It is an economic necessity. It is even
a matter of national survival. But
automation should not be feared for
its challenges. Of the many opinions
on how to offset the labor-displacing
effects of automation, none are pessi-
mistic to the extent of saying that
automation will be the downfall of
the country. Whether the solution is
as drastic a measure as Robert Theo-
bold proposes—a guaranteed income—
or the use of contemporary economic
tools as Samuelson and Ackley sug-
gest—monetary and fiscal policy—the
burden on the people of the United
States need not be excessive. What is
required, however, is an understand-
ing of automation's possible effects on
the economy, and some careful fore-
casting and planning for the future.

there is an increasing animal-protein
deficiency of 4 billion pounds, there
can be no doubt as to the value of
these algae. They are in fact already
being consumed not only by animals,
but also by humans. Japan and Nor-
way have for years gathered algae and
alga kemp for foods such as bread,
and also for stimulation of animal
production, causing larger eggs in
chickens and more valuable pelts in
minks. The most amazing feature of
this algae is its capability of photo-
synthesis. In this process sunlight is
used to convert carbon dioxide and
water into carbohydrates and oxygen.
The C02 sugar can then con-
vert to starches, fats, sucrose, cellulose,
oils and proteins. By combining fish
"stables" over and around certain
algae crops, the fish would flourish by
the abundance of oxygen. A further
fact that one acre of algae yields 40
tons of harvest including 20 tons of
protein and 3 tons of fats is most cer-
tainly a marvel, especially when a
crop may be taken at the rate of 50
times a year. In fact, Japan has used
the products for jellies, dyes, inks,
tooth pastes, soaps, explosives, medi-
cines, welding materials and cosmetics
among others. Though western socie-
ties often find these foods flat tasting,
they may be happy when soon the
flavor enzymes of meats and other
foods are extracted, synthesized and
added to the aquiculture produce. By
the year 2000 man will be harvesting
underwater crops by robot control.
But food is not the only new pro-
duct from marine research. Important
drugs and toxins to form antibiotics
have also been isolated. One poison,
Holothurin, fights certain cancer
growths, and a bacteria, Botuinus
(food poisoning type), is effectively
used to stop many cancer pains,
though it does not fight the disease.
Iodine too is extracted mostly from
the sea, and Bromine is taken entirely
from it. One organism, Agar-Agar, is
used widely for gelatins and bacteria
cultures. Another substance obtained
from alga, called alginon, is frequent-
ly used in surgery for blood plasma in
the human body.
To do any of this extensive research
that is so vital, there must be huge
and complex facilities and also highly
sophisticated research craft. Since
1930, when a scientist named Beebe
descended 900 feet below the ocean's
surface in a cast iron sphere, more and
more depth records have been set.
However, the progress made has taken
more than thirty years of sporadic
development that should have taken
far less time, and even now the stage
is only comparable to that of the
early rocket designers of the 1920's
and 30's. Only recently have diving
research craft been designed that can
dive, rise and dive again as well as
move under their own power at great
depths and under terrific pressures.
However, the present depth records
was set by the U.S. bathyscaph Trieste
which could only rescend and then
ascend once. Yet the feat was a marvel
in itself. The diving craft made the
famous descent in the Challenger
Deep of the Marianas Trench, but to
do this it had to be redesigned from
its original shape for at a depth of
35,000 feet, the force on the outside of
the diving sphere was 100,000 tons.
The floatation tank was increased in
size so as to hold 33,000 gallons of
gasoline which is less dense than
water and can provide 125 tons of
lifting power. Ballast was attached
magnetically, and the large cylinder
had openings so as to permit equal-
ized pressures at the tremendous
depths. The diving sphere under-
neath the floatation gear was uniquely
designed. The entrance hatch was
made to high precision so as to fit
tightly, but it was also designed con-
ically with the larger diameter on the
outside so as to fit more tightly as
the pressure outside increased. The
two portholes were designed similarly,
though made of plexiglass cones with
an outside diameter of 16 inches, and
an inside diameter of 2yz inches; but
here a very wide field of vision was
also possible. There were many elec-
tric attachments that had to be fitted
to the outside of the sphere, such as
flood lights and motors. In these cases,
the holes were drilled with a larger
diameter, doubled, on the inside.
Thus if the wire disintegrated, any
incoming water could only trickle in
and the bathyscaph could be raised
in time. But if this was not drilled
correctly, and the same conically re-
versed design, or even uniform diame-
ter holes, were drilled, any incoming
water would have the same effect as a
machine gun firing into the spherel
Developments such as these have
greatly advanced marine technology
and research. Resulting craft are cap-
able of taking samples of the flora
and fauna of the ocean depths where
life was not expected to exist.
Practical applications like guided
craft that can salvage cargoes from
sunken ships and raise sunken sub-
marines, planes and valuable space
vehicles are at present being made.
But prototypes of this sort are ex-
pensive, and Western governments,
like the United States, are making
little effort to assist and reward the
brilliant projects that have become
realities. Most of these are American-
born ideas, but the Soviet government
has exploited many of them to much
greater degrees than private American
companies can hope to do. The Rus-
sian government unfortunately realizes
the crucial value of this research far
more than the American government.
The Soviets realize that they not on-
ly can and must control outer space,
but they must and will control
"inner" space, our oceans, unless some
vital aid is given to the marine insti-
tutes around the world and especially
in our United States. Countries such
as Israel and Ethopia are fast equaliz-
ing the level of the once leading
American institutes. Many men are
rapidly realizing that it is far less
expensive to settle men in suburbs on
the continental shelves of the oceans
than it is to settle immigrants on
another planet. Besides the monstrous
costs in the near future, the time
lapse between any kind of take-off
and landing would be enough to use
all of the readily available materials
that are on earth to build many un-
derwater cities. There is no problem
of room or pressure, since the conti-
nental shelves have an area the size
of Asia, and these buildings would
be only 300-400 feet below the sur-
face. Elevator tubes, midget submar-
ines and diving bells would be com-
mon and inexpensive means of travel
to the surface, just as they are now
used for commercial fishing enter-
prises.
As man goes farther and deeper
into the seas, he finds himself relying
on the very ocean from whence he
came, to decide his future. He be-
comes more and more curious as to
how life began, and by searching the
deep sedimentary layers of the ocean
floor, he is able to resolve many of
the mysteries. "Plugs" from these lay-
ers have helped to date the times and
what types of creatures lived on the
earth many eons of years ago. He can
descend to the bottom of the world
and observe forms of life never before

and a stationary inner hub. The space
station will probably be equipped
with a centrifuge.
In order to derive optimum results
from experiments conducted aboard
these vehicles, NASA called for a criti-
cal analysis of the weightlessness study
program. The purpose of this analysis
was twofold: first to establish an ex-
tensive series of biomedical and be-
havioral tests, and second, to estab-
lish criteria by which to determine
whether or not man could survive in
and re-adapt from the weightless state.
North American Aviation and Repub-
lic Aviation worked for some time on
both areas. Recommendations varied
slightly regarding some of the psycho-
physiological experiments, but most
are in accord. North American Avia-
tion recommended 147 items, two
thirds of which are biomedical and
one third, behavioral. Republic rec-
ommends around a hundred tests of
about the same ratio of biomedical to
behavioral. Not all of these tests can
be performed as yet because smaller
medical apparatus is needed. Also, in
some instances, the actual test pro-
cedure has not been established, e.g.,
measurement of this internal pressure
of the eyeball.
Obviously, there are just not time
and room for all experiments so the
battery has been broken down into
classes in order of importance. Nine-
teen class I experiments are recom-
mended for a comprehensive program
in the Manned Orbital Laboratory
(MOL).1 This includes such tests as
urinary calcium and potassium, body
water, regional blood flow, muscle
size and strength, vestibuler senses,
gross motor coordination, and visual
acuity.
As technology yields greater and
more frequent opportunity for experi-
mentation, more extensive testing will
be conducted. In order to perform all
147 tests, however, seven hours per
man per day would be required on
the part of the 24 man crew of the
planned orbital space station.
In conclusion it can be safely stated
that just what happens when the body
is left on its own without gravity is
almost as complicated as the system
itself. Many body systems relax and

some instances certain sub-systems be-
come insignificant without gravity. In
general the metabolic rate drops, mus-
cles relax and deteriorate, and bones
tend to de-calcify. Micturition ceases
and individuals need far less sleep
under zero-g. This is a result of the
relaxed tonus of the smooth, organ
supporting muscles. Whether such
general deterioration would eventual-
ly lead to death is a moot question.
Re-exposure to gravity after pro-
longed periods of zero-g could easily
lead to death resulting from severe
strains of a weakened cadiovascular
system.
It appears that man may be able to
adjust to prolonged weightlessness
provided his continuously relaxed
condition is compensated. Scientists
generally conclude that special, rigor-
ous isometric and isotonic exercises
would go a long way in alleviating
most of these problems. It may be
possible to condition the astronaut
organically to prevent or repair some
of the deterioration. An advanced
type of anti-gravity "G" suit or sim-
ilar arrangement could go a long way
in lessening re-adaptation stresses.
At any rate, NASA feels that a six
man, year long weightlessness endur-
ance experiment would be prerequi-
site to any interplanetary (beyond
the moon) endeavor. Ultimately, arti-
ficial gravity may be necessary. Con-
sidering present technological capabil-
ities, it will be a long time before arti-
ficial gravity is available for inter-
planetary operations. Some day it may
be convenient, but at this point it
represents a costly and cumbersome
alternative.

as MOHOLE, to find out when life
began on the earth. He hopes to turn
back through time to when the earth
was an empty, airless, waterless heav-
enly body like the moon, to when the
earth's mantle was covered by the
meteorite dust just as the moon is
expected to be today. Through the
still infant science of oceanography,
man can find answers to the secrets of
his past and to the questions of his
future.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The mechanical engineer who decides to join
forces with us upon completion of his formal
education will discover soon enough that the
biggest part of his education is still ahead of him.
This cliche can be interpreted two ways.
The literal way—"Line spread function" mathe-
matizes certain aspects of image structure in
optical theory. Very few mechanical engineers
shelter behind academic ivy long enough to get
that deep into other men's games. If, for example,
we need mechanical engineers capable of com-
municating with our optical physicists for a
common purpose—and we have such purposes in
our little-known but heavy aerospace commit-
ments—we had better provide the right fertilizer
for ivy ourselves. So we do. Some of the more
sophisticated current ideas on what constitutes
engineering have strong partisans among the
men from whose ranks a newcomer can pick his
boss here.
The hard-boiled way—The nice part about
being an engineer here is that a man can find a
level of sophistication to suit his interests even
without risking the shifting sands of internation-
al policy. We are plainly, frankly, proudly, and
gloriously commercial. We need men to whom to
teach the technical subtleties of making money
from satisfying the everyday needs of people and
of business. When done properly, it can be as
challenging to the intellect as the work of the
engineer across the road who gets the same sig-
nature on his paycheck for ideas on palpating
the moon.
Drop us a line.

Advancement in a Big Company:
How it Works
An Interview with General Electric's C. K. Rieger, Vice President and Group Executive, Electric Utility Group
C. K. Rieger
■ Charles K. Rieger joined General Elec-
tric's Technical Marketing Program after
earning a BSEE at the University of Mis-
souri in 1936. Following sales engineering
assignments in motor, defense and home
laundry operations, he became manager of
the Heating Device and Fan Division in
1947. Other Consumer-industry management
positions followed. In 1953 he was elected
a vice president, one of the youngest men
ever named a Company officer. Mr. Rieger
became Vice President. Marketing Services
in 1959 and was appointed to his present
position in 1961. He is responsible for all
the operations of some six divisions com-
posed of 23 product operations oriented
primarily toward the Electric Utility market.
Q. How can I be sure of getting the
recognition I feel I'm capable of earn-
ing in a big company like G.E.?
A. We learned long ago we couldn't
afford to let capable people get lost.
That was one of the reasons why G.E.
was decentralized into more than a
hundred autonomous operating de-
partments. These operations develop,
engineer, manufacture and market
products much as if they were inde-
pendent companies. Since each de-
partment is responsible for its own
success, each man's share of author-
ity and responsibility is pinpointed.
Believe me, outstanding performance
is recognized, and rewarded.
Q. Can you tell me what the "promo-
tional ladder" is at General Electric?
A. We regard each man individually.
Whether you join us on a training
program or are placed in a specific
position opening, you'll first have to
prove your ability to handle a job.
Once you've done that, you'll be given
more responsibility, more difficult
projects—work that's important to
the success of your organization and
your personal development. Your abil-
ity will create.a "promotional ladder"
of your own.
Q. Will my development be confined
to whatever department I start in?
A. Not at all! Here's where "big com-
pany" scope works to broaden your
career outlook. Industry, and General
Electric particularly, is constantly
changing —adapting to market the
fruits of research, reorganizing to
maintain proper alignment with our
customers, creating new operations
to handle large projects. All this rep-
resents opportunity beyond the limits
of any single department.
Q. Yes, but just how often do these
opportunities arise?
A. To give you some idea, 25 percent
of G-E's gross sales last year came
from products that were unknown
only five or ten years ago. These new
products range from electric tooth
brushes and silicone rubber com-
pounds to atomic reactors and inter-
planetary space probes. This chang-
ing Company needs men with ambi-
tion and energy and talent who aren't
afraid of a big job—who welcome the
challenge of helping to start new
businesses like these. Demonstrate
your ability—whether to handle com-
plex technical problems or to manage
people, and you won't have long to
wait for opportunities to fit your
needs.
Q. How does General Electric help
me prepare myself for advancement
opportunity?
A. Programs in Engineering, Manu-
facturing or Technical Marketing give
you valuable on-the-job training. We
have Company-conducted courses to
improve your professional ability no
matter where you begin. Under Tui-
tion Refund or Advanced Degree Pro-
grams you can continue your formal
education. Throughout your career
with General Electric you'll receive
frequent appraisals to help your self-
development. Your advancement will
be largely up to you.

On top of Kitt Peak, the world's largest solar telescope
gives scientists the largest image of the sun man has ever had
At the top of the gleaming white tower in
the upper picture is a 60-inch quartz mirror
which precisely tracks the sun all day in
the clear, dry air above the Arizona desert.
It is cradled in a carriage called a helio-
stat, built by Westinghouse.
Part of this telescope is tunneled out of
the flank of the mountain. Sunlight is re-
flected 480 feet down this tunnel and back
up 280 feet into a dark viewing room by
means of two other mirrors, also on
Westinghouse mountings.
By studying the sun's image here, scien-
tists hope to learn more about the sun's
magnetic field and how sunspots affect
our weather and communications.
The 60-ton heliostat at the Kitt Peak
National Observatory is designed to track
the daily motion of the sun to an accuracy
of 1/1000 of an inch.

And a lot of imagination! Think working with a "one
material" company would be pretty dull? Consider this...
starting with sand, Coming's scientists and engineers have
created more than 100,000 different glass formulas...
more than 43,000 specialty glass products.
They've developed micro-miniature electronic com-
ponents, glass-ceramics for missile nose cones, glass so
strong it can be bent and twisted, glass that darkens on
exposure to light, glass so rare it costs $500,000 a pound.
Innovation is Coming's hallmark. 65% of our business
is in products not available 15 years ago. Innovation, too,
is the reason we've grown 81% in the past five years
('63 sales—more than $289 million). And the reason we'll
continue to grow. Almost six cents of every sales dollar
goes to research. Check other leading companies.
Emphasis on R&amp;D presents a constantly changing chal-
lenge for our engineers. For you, it could also mean early
responsibility, rapid advancement, the satisfaction that
comes with discovering unique answers to unusual problems.

Ground Detection of
Space Objects in the Night Sky
RCA has designed and installed for the
Air Force a new optical satellite surveillance
system that utilizes advanced techniques in
several fields including physics, electronics,
mathematics and astronomy. Starting in the
laboratory with a bread-board experiment to
prove the feasibility of using image orthicon
tubes as detectors of moving targets among the
millions of stars in the night skies, a team of
scientists and engineers carried the project
through systems and design analysis, and
produced the requisite equipment even to
building an observatory on a mountain top in
New Mexico. The system is now being evalu-
ated under actual operating conditions. While
performance data arc security classified it can
be said that the system is designed to detect,
without a priori information, very dim satellites
in real time, far beyond normal radar ranges.
Op'ical physics and engineering of the highest
order were required to produce an eleven-ton,
27 inch f/l telescope that uses 6 million optical
fibers to present images to 12 orthicon
cameras. Image motion processing necessary
to find a liny satellite moving slowly through a
star field as dense as the Milky Way is accom-
plished by entirely automatic electronic signal
integration, star cancellation and data associ-
ation and reporting. The very latest techniques
of electronic engineering have produced highly
sophisticated equipment for control, data
gathering and analysis of results.
System design, performance evaluation and
computer programming have involved rigorous
mathematical analyses applied to new com-
binations of scientific disciplines. Proof of the
deductions are just beginning to emerge from
the observatory, and much will be learned
about applied astronomy as the system
is used.

Color TV Receiver
Automatic Degaussing
Even the comparatively small magnetic fields
exhibited by the earth can cause visible errors
in color television reception. To give picture tube
output proper color alignment, while the TV
receiver is in any desired location, an effective
magnetic shield is required. But before a
practical magnetic shield can perform its
function, the shield must be degaussed in the
specific magnetic field to be shielded.
Degaussing enables the metal in the shield to
"forget" its previous magnetic orientation and
to magnetically realign to counteract any new
position. Degaussing affects the metal in the
picture tube's shadow mask in the same manner.
Usually, a color television receiver is de-
gaussed by driving a solenoid wound coil with
120 volt AC line voltage and moving the coil
around the front of the tube . . . then slowly
drawing the coil away. This operation usually
is required every time the position of the color
receiver, with respect to the earth's magnetic
field, is changed.
Recent ly, RC A i nt rod uccd automatic degauss-
ing. This gives the color instrument freedom of
movement, regardless of the earth's magnetic
field. Automatic degaussing also protects the
receiver from magnetic fields generated by
nearby vacuum cleaners and other electrical
appliances.
An RCA innovation, automatic degaussing
is accomplished during initial warm-up—each
time the color receiver is turned on from a
cold start. The surge currents charging the
electrolytic capacitors of the B+ supply start
from a high value and decrease exponentially
during the charging lime. A thermistor in
series with this charging current starts at
approximately 110 ohms and decreases to 4
ohms as the current's heating effect changes
the resistance.
A voltage-dependent resistor, in series with
the degaussing coils (wound on the picture
tube shield), acts as a switch to connect the
coils across the thermistor only during the
warm-up of the receiver. Thus, the slow draw-
ing away of the coil in manual degaussing is
simulated automatically.
Energy Conversion
One of the most attractive new methods
for the direct conversion of heat to electricity
is the thermionic generator. In many applica-
tions, however, the efficient use of a thermionic
generator requires some form of low voltage
DC to AC inversion. Such generators de-
veloped at RCA are capable of several hundred
watts output at efficiencies of 20%. Because
this power is generated at only 0.5 volts,
techniques were needed to step up output to
practical voltage levels. Under Navy and Air
Force sponsorship, RCA has now developed a
tunnel diode inverter system capable of in-
verting the output of thermionic generators
and other low voltage power sources to any
AC voltage desired, with efficiencies up to
80* ;. This is believed to be the first time that
usable power has been developed from a
thermionic generator.
These recent achievements are indicative of the great range of activities in
research, applied research, advanced development, design and development
engineering at RCA. To learn more about the many scientific challenges
awaiting bachelor and advanced degree candidates in Electrical or Mechanical
Engineering, Physics, Chemistry or Mathematics, write: College Relations,
Radio Corporation of America, Cherry Hill, New Jersey.
The new system employs the use of gallium
arsenide, a semiconductor material which
provides larger bandgaps and hence higher
efficiencies and temperature capabilities. The
tunnel diode inverter system has the advantage
over previous designs in the following areas:
Radiation resistance—operable at radiation
levels of 10" nvt with only small decreases in
efficiency. Temperature—GaAs tunnel diodes
have been operated successfully at 200°C.
Circuit simplicity—An extremely simple circuit
is required consisting of only one transformer
and two tunnel diodes, while the more conven-
tional type of transistor inverter requires several
transformers, resistors, diodes and transistors.
Cost-Weight-Volume—Due largely to their sim-
plicity, these advantages are obvious over other
circuits of comparable performance.
These advanced engineering achievements
represent a real breakthrough in energy con-
version that is extremely important to our
defense and space efforts.

The Michigan Tradition
This fall tens of thousands of high school graduates will enter
colleges and universities across the nation. About four thou-
sand of them will come to the University of Michigan for some
reason or another. Almost all of these incoming students will
be aware that Michigan is a very good school, but few will
realize until they have been here a few years that Michigan is
much more than just very good. Since this issue of the Technic
will be distributed to high schools throughout the Midwest
with the hope of acquainting high school students with the
University, it would seem fitting that this space should be used
to explain why Michigan is one of the greatest educational in-
stitutions in the world.
First, Michigan is noted for scholastic excellence. A poll of
educators across the nation rated Michigan as one of the top
six schools in the country (the other five are Harvard, Yale.
Princeton, Columbia, and California at Berkeley). Michigan's
Law School, Medical School, College of Engineering, and Col-
lege of Literature, Science, and the Arts are world famous for
their outstanding faculty, graduates, and contributions to the
arts and scientific research.

Second, Michigan has an excellent athletic record. Until the
recent successes of the football and basketball teams, Michigan
was probably not recognized by the general public as an out-
standing athletic school, but actually the University consist-
ently has nationally ranked teams in swimming, wrestling,
hockey, gymnastics, baseball, and track. The University also
consistently wins the overall athletic competition in the Big
Ten. None of the other outstanding scholastic schools in the
country mentioned above can display an athletic record com-
parable to Michigan's
Third, Michigan has a cosmopolitan atmosphere that is dis-
tinctly its own. While most state supported schools allow only
a small number of out of state students, Michigan's student
body draws thirty per cent of its students from out of state and
eleven per cent from foreign countries. This gives rise to an
atmosphere that allows students to be exposed to the view-
points of people from all around the world.
One might question the relative values of these points, but
they are all necessary for a student to get the most out of his
college years. Certainly any serious college student would want
a school with an outstanding scholastic rating. Most students
do not participate in varsity athletics, but all of them can
benefit from the school spirit that naturally develops at a
school with consistently outstanding athletic teams. Last, the
cosmopolitan atmosphere gives the student the most subtle,
but possibly the most important, part of his education—an
understanding of his fellow man.
Many schools are outstanding in one, or maybe even two,
of the aforementioned areas, but not one school can approach
Michigan if you add all three areas together.
You can become a part of the Michigan tradtion. It's a tra-
dition of excellence in everything the school has, and this
school has everything.
Onk Sfiold.
This issue of the Michigan Technic goes to over fifteen
hundred high schools throughout the Midwest with the hope
that it can serve as a partial introduction to the University.
The Editors hope that the high school principals receiving
copies will make them available to interested students. Thank
you.

few people realize just how much basic
and applied research we in the Army
must do ourselves in order to provide

systems to the operating forces.
But the fact is this: there are some
13,000 civilian scientists and engineers
working in dozens of Army research

Why such outstanding

the world.
■ Because we are free to pursue
promising concepts without profit-
making limitations.
■ Because we work on a succession
of major programs and projects whose
importance assures us of no contract

■ Because some of the greatest
names in science and technology call

allowing him to apply his total talents
to study and experimentation.
If you've kept up with events in
Washington these days, you'll know
that the Army has been conducting
outstanding R&amp;D work in aviation,
communications, missiles, tactical
weaponry, and the related human
behavioural sciences.
Knowing this, doesn't it make sense
that the Army would make an ideal

FROM THE
DEAN
Dean Stephen S. Attwood
A year ago I talked about the attractive opportunities in
Engineering. In this year, 1965, when I am about to end a
most interesting and satisfying career as an engineer and
educator, I believe it is safe to say that the decades ahead oiler
more promise than any decade my generation can boast about.
We know from our study of history that, in early times,
scientific knowledge developed very slowly. Aristotle's theory
of falling bodies was the last word for almost two thousand
years until Galileo did what every high school physics student
now accepts as common practice—he tested it. And he found
Aristotle wrong. But Galileo was examined for his scientific
"heresies" under menace of torture. This kind of treatment
tended to discourage scientists when they knew it might not be
healthy to disturb commonly accepted thought.
In physics, we study one day Boyle's Law which relates
pressure and volume (discovered about 1660), and the next
day Charles' Law, which includes temperature (about 1800).
There were one hundred forty years between these two rather
closely related scientific breakthroughs.
Through the centuries, engineering application of new
scientific knowledge has also tended to lag. For example, about
1830 Faraday discovered the principle of electromagnetic in-
duction. But it was not until the 1890's that transformers were
used to boost alternating voltages to transmit electric power.
It took fifty years to put Einstein's e = mc- to work generating
electric power.
Beyond any doubt we have recently entered a new scientific
and engineering era. Not only is the time between new scien-
tific discoveries decreasing, but the speed at which engineering
applications follow scientific breakthrough is increasing. New
developments in energy transformation and in automatic
controls, speedier communications and travel are truly causing
revolutionary changes in our way of life.
I am a member of that "decadent" generation that remem-
bers the horse and buggy. At times it is a bit interesting
to take a look at where we were a few short years ago, because

and engineering. Because so much of my career has related to
energy and its utilization, I would like to refer to a few
examples to relate the importance of engineering develop-
ments to our way of life.
Ever since man adopted the use of fire, not only for comfort,
but also for his very survival, he has had the problem of gather-
ing fuel to supply his energy needs. Simple societies and
sparsely populated regions had an ample supply of dead plants,
fallen twigs, and limbs of trees to cook their food and warm
their shelters.
When the early settlers came to America, they found millions
of acres of thickly-wooded forests. Because of the availability
and abundance of trees, conservation of this important resource
was not among their day-to-day concerns. In many parts of
the United States, the pioneers cut down walnut and oak trees
and burned them to make their first clearing to grow food.
Not only did they use this resource to build their log cabins,
but through the application of muscle-power, axe, and saw,
trees also supplied their fireplaces with fuel. This they did
during the winter months when other farm work was at a
minimum. Practically no education, other than that learned in
the family, was needed for successful, if not comfortable, sur-
vival in such an environment. Some boys and girls attended
classes for a few months in a little log schoolhouse and learned
to read, write, and work simple arithmetic problems.
Many people in my generation helped to keep the family
woodbox filled and considered the hard coal base burner quite
an advancement in the art of keeping the wintery blasts out
of the uninsulated "family" room. But our children have
experienced the same delight when we have been able to re-
place the inconvenient coal-burning furnace with a thermo-
statically-controlled oil or natural gas burner that can operate
from September to May without a trip to the furnace room.
Tomorrow many homes will be air-conditioned for comfort
—winter and summer. The energy to do it will be supplied
electrically and very likely from the energy stored in the
nucleus of the atom.
Over this same period, the work of man in the field, in the
shop, on the highway and in the home has been transferred
from muscle to machine. In 1900 the average amount of power
used by American factory workers was one horsepower—gen-
erally through shafts and belts. Today it is more than ten
horsepower, delivered to his bench or machine by the con-
venience of electric wires. I would like to refer to this as an
upgrading of man's ability to make greater economic use of
the materials and forces of nature. As one source of raw ma-
terials is exhausted, man must seek a new source. As one
method becomes inefficient he must seek a new way. Thus a
growing application of the physical sciences through engineer-
ing achievement is going on all about us in every field of
endeavor.
This of course has much to do with the demands upon
education. The one-room schoolhouse has long ceased to meet
all the needs of our society. Since 1900, the number of scien-
tific, engineering and professional workers employed has in-
creased faster than the overall population. The growing need
for future well-qualified scientists, engineers and technicians
is obvious. It is estimated that the new field of nuclear physics
alone will require from ten to twenty-thousand specialists in
the next decade to fully develop the facilities for electric power
generation, which has a history of doubling each decade.

The speaker was a brilliant young Navy
scientist discussing his work, and he might
well have been referring to the Naval Ordance
Laboratory at White Oak, Maryland, where
technological explorations are pursued to the
ultimate advantage of the nation's posture
of defense.
Who would have thought, especially before
the advent of POLARIS, that a submarine
could someday fire what appears to be an
ordinary torpedo which would, a few seconds
later, take off upwards into a ballistics tra-
jectory . . . drop its rocket motor somewhere
down-range . . . re-enter the water intact at
supersonic speed . . . automatically arm itself
. . . and let loose a nuclear blast that will
decimate any number of submerged hostiles?
Today, SUBROC promises to be the deadliest
anti-submarine warfare weapon ever devised,
but when it was first dreamed up by NOL
scientists back in 1957 it presented the
thorniest set of problems yet to face the still-
young missile age. That SUBROC itself,
together with its sonar detection system and
special digital computer fire control system,
are almost ready for fleet use is a real tribute
to NOL's creativity, technical direction, and
test &amp; evaluation capabilities.
But SUBROC—although an undertaking of
incredible proportions—is just one in a long
series of NOL projects in anti-submarine
warfare, air and surface weaponry, aerobal-
listics, chemistry, explosives, and materials
research. Many such dreams have become
reality at NOL—seven new magnetic ma-
terials that have sharply upgraded magnetic
amplifiers, magnetometers, and electromag-
netic transducers . . . new ways to measure
drag, stability, and heating effects of missiles
traveling in excess of Mach 10 ... the arming
and fuzing devices for POLARIS ... a new
data reduction method for underwater
acoustics that opens the door to passive sonar
ranging ... two new nuclear depth bombs ...
and literally hundreds more.
There are more than 1,000 graduate profes-
sionals at NOL-White Oak today, but the
Laboratory is always interested in talented
explorers—especially those delving into aero
and electro technologies. And, to help you
explore more freely (and productively), NOL
offers:
• assignments of national importance
• the finest equipment and facilities to be had
(900 acres of them)
• several programs for advance degrees in
cooperation with Washington-area uni-
versities. The University of Maryland even
holds some courses on NOL premises
which you may attend during working
hours. (NOL has always been fertile ground
for PhD theses.)
• the stimulus of working with top people in
their specialties, many of whom are staff

While crises in the Cold War come
and eventually go, there is a new field
of international interest and competi-
tion which is becoming more and
more prominent. This rising center
of concentration is the ocean. It is be-
coming apparent that man will quite
soon be forced to "farm" the ocean
for his food, and build there in order
to have space to live. Unfortunately,
the same ocean that holds so many
promises for the future also contains
new and terrible destructive powers.
The ocean is more than ever becom-
ing a major field for battle, and in
order for the navies of the world to
operate in it, each country is explor-
ing the yet infant science of ocean-
ography.
Every few months 5600 tons is added
to the 1.5 billion billion tons of
water in the sea. This weight repre-
sents a new and deadly nuclear sub-
marine. The Soviet Union presently
has a larger submarine Meet than the
United States' and Britain's com-
bined. Where Germany, at the end of
World War II, had 336 U-boats in
operation, USSR now has 420. 321
are of the long-range W and Z classes
which can travel 12,000-20,000 miles
with submerged speeds of 15-20 knots.
To complement the fleet, Russia has
25 nuclear submarines; 10 are attack
subs and 15 are the missile launching
type. The United States has approxi-
mately the same number of nuclear
subs, although they are much quieter
running and can launch missiles with-
out having to surface. These, as will
be seen later, are two very important
advantages. It is obvious that these
craft will be the principal tactical
weapons of the future. The crippling
effect of Germany's few U-boats in
World War II shows how decisive a
part submarine warfare can play in
any emergency. The new nuclear subs,
called "nukes" (for "nuclear") with
operating depths exceeding 600 feet
and maximum speeds of over 30 knots
are definitely strategic weapons, but
these amazingly sophisticated vessels
are nearly crippled by the ignorance
of the environment in which they op-
erate. The "nukes" are gathering a
great deal of data on the myriad as-
pects of the sea, while at the same
time, they are on alert patrol duties
all over the world. This is certainly
the wrong way to go about increasing
the effectiveness of such an invaluable
weapon. Thus the Navy is and has
since 1959 been increasing the funds
appropriated to oceanographic re-
search. Two rather startling facts show
the need for this research. First, in
World War II about 91% of the sub-
marine contacts made were errors, and
today that figure has gone down to
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the "startling" low of 89% errors. A
second example is that American and
British naval units searched nearly a
week to locate the hijacked liner
Santa Maria whose general position
was even known. In order to locate a
submarine which obviously does not
travel on the surface and which may
be anywhere in thousands of square
miles of ocean takes a good deal more
knowledge than is presently available.
However, through oceanographic
study, the major military concerns
over anti-submarine warfare, ASW,
are becoming easier to overcome.
The Navy is concerned with three
main areas of defenses: 1) against
submarine launched ballistic missiles
(SLBM) and their carriers; 2) de-
lense of naval fleets; 3) defense of
merchant shipping. The approach to
these problems requires a systematic
study of almost every facet of the
oceans. Yet with so much unknown, it
is very difficult and foolish to isolate
research in any one of these areas.
Therefore, to overcome the defense
problems, oceanographers are concen-
trating on these major aspects: the
ocean's natural states, its phenomena,
the applications of bionics, the effects
of new knowledge on ship design, and
the use of new materials for building
craft to study and operate in the sea.
First of all we must consider such
variables as the temperatures in the
ocean, the salinity variances, shifting
currents, weather, and topography.
These characteristics present the major
problems to ASW, for the most dif-
ficult task is to locate subs. Once the
craft are found and identified, they
can be quickly destroyed by modern
weapons. Much of the problem is en-
volved with sonar, but this will Ik-
dealt with later. One simple example
of this difficulty is that two adjacent
bodies of water at different tempera-
tures will not mix naturally. There-
fore, between the two bodies, a sound
reflecting barrier is set up, and sonar
cannot penetrate this barrier.
One important aspect of the ocean
is its currents. Many are yet to be dis-
covered, but improved methods are
being developed to locate them. One
is the use of taught wire sonar buoys
for fixed reference points in the cur-
rents. Deep water devices are also used.
These sink to a predetermined depth
and travel with the currents and trans-
mit their path as well as data on tem-
perature, pressure and salinity. One in-
stance of a major discovery which is
vital to underwater activities is that
approximately 40 million tons of water
are moving in the Pacific Ocean about
the Equator. These forces could
severely hamper a submarine which is
unknowingly passing through them.
Since modern subs operate under
pressures of 5 tons per square inch,
any sudden or unexpectedly great
movements of water against the hull
could increase the pressure and crush
the superstructure. The motion of cur-
rents may be used to advantage by a
craft in speeding its attack or escaping
from hostile vessels. Trying to battle
against rapid ocean movements would
use up fuel which is vital in many
cases to a sub's return to port. How-
ever, before the currents can be used,
they must all be charted accurately,
and the only way to do this is by
oceanographic study.
Weather is another of the ocean's
states which must be studied, for in
many cases a tactical force cannot af-
ford to fight storms and be delayed.
Therefore ASWEPS, anti-submarine
weapons prediction system, was born.
It observes and predicts the condition
of the ocean's surface, its temperature,
currents and salinity by use of self-
contained sonobuoys and radar data
gathered from wave scattering pat-
terns. The overall picture is then
rapidly formed on oceanographic
charts.
Charting the surface is not the only
research vital to development of na-
tional security. The ocean floor must
also be accurately mapped. Obviously
a modern sub cannot operate at full

grope its way around the ocean's
mountains and valleys. A captain must
know where a protective underwater
mountain is for shelter from pursuing
craft. He must also know the topog-
raphy of the ocean floor when he is
the pursuer. For an effective defense
or strike pattern, the best routes of
attack must also be known, and these
can only come from accurate charts.
One effective proposal is that a fleet
of 10-20 research craft be built that
can be transported in the holds of
slightly modified LSD vessels. Using
the transports as bases the craft would
chart 100 mile wide shipping lanes
across the oceans. These craft, planned
by General Dynamics, would have a
range of 100 nautical miles at 5 knots,
and it would therefore take only 4
months to chart a lane across the At-
lantic. While charting, data on cur-
rents, water temperatures and other
vital information would be gathered
simultaneously. The idea of these ac-
curately charted lanes is for a concept
called fleet defense in which the pres-
ence of any vessel not with the certain
fleet could easily be detected because
of its effect on oceanographic readings
of all the natural states. Present in-
struments could handle the detection
of any intruder in these "narrow" sea
lanes, and future methods will be even
more effective until the entire ocean
floor is accurately charted.
ever, merchant submarines will soon
use the polar route for transport just
as planes go above the cap today. In
fact it would cut several thousand
miles off of the route from Tokyo to
London by use of a newly discovered
underwater valley 300-1200 ft. deep
extending many hundred miles into
the Arctic Ocean. These discoveries
are made, however, by extensive re-
search.
Possibly the most striking of these
discoveries are certain marine phe-
nomena. The very nature of the water
and of the creatures that live in it, as
well as the effects of sound in the
ocean, are often startling. Sea water
is opaque to electromagnetic radi-
ation, and therefore no form of sight
detection is effective over any great
distance. Sea water is also very cor-
rosive and causes most metals to oxi-
dize after long periods of submersion.
From oceanographic research, the
pressures at certain depths and loca-
tions can be applied to the use of ma-
terials capable of withstanding the
pressures. Another phenomenon is
the appearance of a "phantom bot-
tom" which indicates water much
shallower than it actually is. When
tracking or evading submarines this
is of vital importance. But why and
for how long this is formed is a prob-
lem for oceanographers who are called
the Navy. Technical
these
cover. Another phenomenon which
oceanographers have discovered is
why, when the fast and maneuverable
nuclear subs make sharp, high speed
turns, they appeared, on sonar, to
hover in one place and also be moving
away at the same time as if firing a
decoy or torpedo ahead. Actually, the
stationary plot is a huge mass of
bubbles which, caused by the turn,
hovers there suspended almost indefi-
nitely.
More closely related to the prob-
lem of effectively detecting hostile
vessels is the use of sonar. The
most sensitive method is the use of
hydrophones and precise listening
gear to detect the whine of ships' pro-
pellers. However, the ocean is full of
different noises which vary from that
of whales sounding like a rusty,
squeaking door hinge, to the light
hum of eels which sound like a tea-
kettle boiling, or the buzzing of a
school of shrimp which sound like
eggs sizzling in a pan. From all such
noises, oceanographers must identify
and filter out the unwanted garble
and find the subtle shift in pitch of a
sub's screw. Some day, not all of these
"noises" will be unwanted, for the
presence of a vessel among sea crea-
tures may cause them to have advance
reactions, and if their various buzzings
and whines could be "read" they
might foretell an approaching in-
truder.
One especially important area for
naval oceanographic research is the
Arctic. The first voyage of the USS
Nautilus brought many new facts,
verifications and contradictions to re-
searchers and explorers. One of these
is that the polar ice cap is thin com-
pared to what was previously thought:
a mere 10 feet on the average. Now
that the "cap" has been voyaged many
times, the accessibility of areas such
as Hudson Bay for launching SLBMs
at the North American continent is
greatly increased. In the future, how-
"mirages" are called Deep Scattering
Layers and they are impenetrable by
common sonar, and they are suspected
to be huge quantities of marine life
such as plankton. These false bottoms
have been noticed to rise at night and
to sink during the day, which indi-
cates more strongly that they are
marine life. When these DSLs are of-
ten 300 sq. miles in area, they offer a
great deal of cover for submarines,
and this is of special value since these
layers often appear near to the coast-
lines thus affording good and close
Factors still closer to determing the
effectiveness of ASW are the transmis-
sion and identification of sound in
water. Therefore better methods of
detecting must be found. One factor
in detection is that sound travels five
times faster in water than in air, but
exactly how far it travels varies con-
siderably. In experiments, a small
charge was set off in the Indian Ocean,
and it was heard on hydrophones 9000
miles away in New York. Another in-
stance was using SOFAR, sound fix-
ing and ranging, when a small charge
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


traveled close to the surface rounding
the Cape of Good Hope, and near the
Equator sinking to 2560 ft. and 223
minutes after detonation it was de-
lected by SOFAR in Bermuda. An ex-
cellent sound zone is also known to
exist at 4000 ft. in the Atlantic. These
zones, some of which are permanent
and some of which shift regularily, are
caused by a certain combination of
temperatures, pressure and salinity
which is as yet unknown. One appli-
cation of the oceanographic data gath-
Certain assumptions may be made due
to the trawling up of several bathy-
thermographs in an area which a large
fishing fleet had just left.
fn order to break the temperature
boundaries, a project called ARTEM-
IS has been launched. ARTEMIS is a
30 ton transducer which, when sub-
merged in the ocean, generates low
frequence sound waves that can
pierce the isothermal layers of water.
Before it became "secret" the system
was reportedly able to identify be-
tween a barrel or a submarine at a
on the pulse projector and electronic
components. These buoys use the
"bottom bounce" method in having
wide ray pattern strike the bottom and
then surface at oblique angles. If there
is any submarine between the bottom
and the surface, the rays will bounce
off it instead of the surface, and only
when this occurs will the buoy receive
return signals. As well there is the ad-
vantage of not having screw or surface
noise to interfere with reception of
the sound waves. Presently developed
nuclear battery packs could last in-
cred is the safety package that return-
ing astronauts are to drop into the
water and which will detonate at a
preset depth, thereby giving pick-up
vessels an accurate fix on his position.
For most of the oceans, however,
there are many constantly shifting
zones, and these changes of natural
states greatly impede sonar devices.
Active submarine detection bounces
waves off of an object in water and
then measures its range by the return-
ing "ping." However, sonar will be
hounced off of the interface between
the two bodies of warm and cool
water, and therefore a submarine can
remain safely below this boundary.
Also, by sonar, it is obvious to a sub-
marine that it is being chased when
the "pings" are heard in the water.
Most submarines are equipped with
bathythermographs so that they can
find the safety of warm water pockets
in a cool ocean. The fact that every
Russian submarine is equipped with
these thermographs and that the en-
lire fleet is on continuous duty indi-
cates that they have already compiled
a great amount of data on the perma-
nent pockets alone. Of course, the
pockets nearest to an enemy's shore
are the most valuable for SLBM pur-
poses which brings to mind the abun-
dance of Soviet "fishing" vessels which
are always along the American coast
and which bristle with an unusually
large amount of electronic equipment.
range of 100 miles. It is also sensitive
only to its own very long wavelength.
Though it is not operational, similar
devices could be set up to form an
anti-submarine early warning system
comparable to BMEVVS and the DEW
line.
Two other closely related projects
are CAESAR and COLLOSSUS which
are passive submarine detection sys-
tems. They consist of hydrophones and
sensing devices which are located sev-
eral hundred miles off the coast and
which form a continuous chain to
hear all that might pass across their
line towards the coastline. However,
oceanographers must still develop
computer-linked systems to filter out
the natural ocean noises from the real
intruder and possibly his jamming
noises. They must also determine the
correct positioning of the sensitive de-
vices so as to get as little feed back as
possible and yet to get maximum cov-
erage to enable the taking of accurate
coordinate ranging fixes.
Very recently a new and effective
method of using sonar was further de-
veloped. Since the nearer to the sea-
air interface, the more unpredictable
sonar becomes, down is the obvious
way to go. At 5000 ft. in almost all
oceans, the salinity is constant, and
the temperature varies only a few de-
grees all year. Therefore newly devel-
oped sonobuoys called FISH II were
made to withstand the 6000psi stress
definitely and therefore eliminate the
heavy cable that the 2-3 kilowatt
power buoys required.
In conjunction with sonar, there
are other types of detection systems.
One is VDS, variable depth sonar,
where an auxiliary sonar device is
towed on a cable below several of the
isothermal layers of the ocean, and
thereby increases the effectiveness of
the detection equipment. Another de-
vice tests for the disturbance of the
earth's magnetic field in the ocean
caused by a submarine's steel hull.
Another method is the proposed use
of DDVs, deep-diving vehicles, which
are oceanographic submersibles that,
apart from floor sampling and under-
water site construction, could be used
for mobile surveillance missions while
testing new equipment at greater
depths than submarines are capable
of operating. There would be less
chance of attack since DDVs could go
very deep; but more important, the
craft could "look" up instead of hav-
ing to rely on bottom bounce reflec-
tion.
Two further projects are proposed
for detection and tracking of ocean
vessels. One is the use of newly de-
veloped TV cameras that "see" sev-
eral thousand yards in the depths of
the sea and to join them with passive
acoustical detection equipment to

LEARNING
by Les Rose
In 1932 S. L. Pressey advanced a
prediction on the future of education,
"the one major activity in this coun-
try which is still in the crude handi-
craft stage."1 He had a device and an
idea, a self-scoring multiple choice
apparatus and a vision of a new form
of material presentation. Pressey felt
that the proper use of the two would
lead to an "industrial revolution" in
education. That revolution failed but
is now enjoying resurrection under the
forms of programmed learning and
teaching machines. It is the purpose
of this article to present that field in
both its characteristics and main mani-
festations. Various kinds of programs
and methods of programming will be
explored, and various theoretical and
practical problems will be examined.
The field of inquiry will be demon-
stably curtailed to programming itself,
as the "success of a teaching machine
depends upon the material used in
it."2 And success has been had by both
programmed texts and the teaching
machines. Evidence has been found by
many and varied researchers at and
above the .05 level proving the effec-
tiveness of programmed learning over
orthodox teaching systems under the
experimental conditions.3 The ques-
tion, then, is not one of the usefulness
of the idea, but of the nature of "what
is the idea?" What is programmed
learning?
There are several different types of
programming, but programs can in
general be defined as any teaching
method that has the following charac-
teristics:
(1) . Each student works at his own pace.
This allows more latitude for individual
differences than any group method,
whether it be lecture, T.V., or movie.
(2) . Small units of information arc pre-
sented at one time in having a state-
ment completed or a small question
answered. This unit is known technically
as the stimulus.
($). In requiring a statement completion
or the answer to a question, a response
to the stimulus is solicited. The statement
or question is usually designed to make it
probable that the student will give the
correct response.'
(4) . Immediate information is then sup-
plied. If the student is wrong, he may be
told why. This feedback is a reward if
the student is correct; in technical terms,
his response is reinforced. Reinforcement
increases the probability of making the
correct response to the same stmulus in
the future.5
(5) . Now the second unit of information
is presented, and the cycle of presenta-
tion-answer-feedback (stimulus-response-
reinforcement) is repeated. The cycle is
continued until all information is pre-
sented in sequence with provision for

information.
Each unit of information is called
a frame, and a series of frames is a
program. Programs may amount to
hundreds of frames, presenting the
subject matter in simple steps, from
simpler concepts to the more com-
plex." Figure 1 is a program sample
from the Teevan and Jandron Student
Guide for Hilgard's Introduction To
Psychology.
Robert Glaser defines programming
as "evoking specific behavior." His
conception of the characteristics of
programming is quite similar to the
above, but more detailed as he de-
velops the ideas of reinforcement,
prompting, fading, weaning, and vari-
ous aspects of ensuring understanding.
He finds that the important goal is to
"enrich the student's understanding by
making him permute and recombine
the elements of his behavior."7 Ga-
lanter does an even more complete
analysis of the principles of program-
ming, dividing the treatment into
eight major aspects with detailed ex-
planation." In all cases, a description
of the characteristics of programming
blends into the theories of "how to
program" and, consequently, will be
touched on in that respect later.
Today's programs are manifested in
two main types, the Skinner program
and the Crowder Program. These
types are similar in respect to the gen-
eral characteristics of programming,
but differ basically over the role of the
response.0 According to Skinner the
overt response per se is the primary
means of learning that response;
whereas Crowder uses the response to
test the student. This basic contrast
gives rise to a difference also in the
mode of response (constructed-re-
sponse or multiple-choice) and the
sequence of frames (linear or branch-
ing) . Most programs today are of the
constructed-response, linear variety,
the Skinner type of program.
During the 1950's, in order to apply
to human learning the principles of
operant conditioning in animal ex-
periments, B. F. Skinner and his asso-
ciates at Harvard developed the con-
structed-response, linear program (by
"constructed-response" it is meant that
the student has to compose the entire
response. Linear programs are those in
which all students work through the
same fixed sequence of frames). Learn-
ing was studied first, not teaching;
animals were allowed to learn by ex-
perience, then shaping was accom-
plished through differential reinforce-
ment. It was realized that if a response
was put under stimulus control, and if
there is a pattern to the stimuli; re-
sponses come out in a pattern. Thus
you do not just wait for a random
response to "shape up," but instead
you set up a formal S-R repertoire so
that you can evoke any form of re-
sponse.10 More simply, "the technique
is to get the response out in the pres-
ence of the stimulus which is later to
control it . .
It is desirable to make successful
responses more probable as they ac-
celerate learning by taking the process
of reinforcement out of the realm of
chance. Multiple-choice responses are
shunned because to be valid the choice
must be plausible, and having these
unwanted responses available only
leads to the strengthening of un-
wanted forms of behavior. It is felt
that the student must compose, must
construct his own response, because it
is recall that one tries to develop, not
recognition. Errors are undesirable in
completing a program, as an error
eliminates the opportunity for a cor-
rect response to be reinforced and pre-
sents the danger that the error may be
learned and repealed in the future.
The size of the step to be presented is
small and the material to be presented
is broken clown into a fixed, logical
sequence by the author with respect
to the behavior to be shaped. These
ideas of Skinner's do not represent a
set system or theory on how to make
a program; but they do seem to show
operant conditioning to be the basis
of his work. Skinner's philosophy of
programming (fig. 1 is an example of
this type of program) is found in his
original article in Science (1958) and
has not changed much yet.12
Norman Crowder suspects that "hu-
man learning takes place in a variety
of ways and that these ways vary with
the abilities and the present knowl-
edge of different students, with the
nature of the subject matter, with a
number of interactions between these
sources of variation, and with other
sources of variability of which we are
not even aware.13 For that reason he
says, that "the essential problem is
that of controlling a communication
process by the use of feedback."14
Feedback is valuable only to the ex-
tent that it determines the effective-
ness of the attempted communication
and learning. Thus Crowder's materi-
als are designed to test and correct, and
are not designed around any partic-
ular theoretical model.
Material is presented in logical
units, usually the size of a paragraph,
and are tested immediately on the
basis of multiple-choice questions con-
taining some probable wrong answers.
There is a separate set of correctional
materials for each possible wrong
answer. If a question is failed, the
item is reviewed, the nature of the
error is explained, and the student is
retested. The "Tutor-Text" is the
simplest device used to implement
such a program. It is a scrambled text,
a specially prepared book in which
each answer choice is identified with
a page number (fig. 2 and 3) .lr&gt;
To facilitate the formulation of his
type of program, Crowder has ad-
vanced five ideas which should be
kept in mind. A branching frame
should: (1) determine if the student
has learned, (2) select appropriate
corrective material if the student has
not learned, (3) provide practice with
the involved concept, (4) keep the
student actively working, and (5) fill
a motivational purpose of the student
if he is correct.10 An improvement is
seen in branching by Jacobs when the
student is not returned to a frame he
has answered incorrectly, but is in-
stead retested on a frame covering the
same concept in which the specifics
are altered. This helps eliminate the
possibility that the student is not ac-
tually learning, but is only remember-
ing his incorrect responses.17
Although the Skinner and Crowder
programs are the most prominent in
the field, many other types of programs
and methods of programming are
used.''' It is difficult to say that this is
a type of program and that that is a
method of programming: The two are
not easily separated. So in covering an
idea on "how to program" you also
approach another type of program.
Some are just permutations of the
Skinner and Crowder methods, suc h as
those using short frames, but with
multiple-choice responses and branc h-
ing. J. A. Barlow has introduced what
he calls "conversational chaining."'-'
Instead of giving a separate answer or
feedback frame, the correct response
is printed in capital letters and woven
into the context of the next presenta-
tion frame.
Evans, Homme, and Glaser have set
up an idea they call the "Ruleg Sys-
tem."-'0 They have a twelve step sys-
tem in which ru's (for rules) and eg's
(for examples) are the key working
properties. The subject is broken

This type of program, a constructed response, linear program, is

down into these two classes and then
put back together in terms of the
twelve rules. The system is complex,
but definite in approach. Klaus also
has a twelve step system. The rules he
has worked out are more general, per-
haps, but are of an easier to use vari-
ety. He expects that "sooner or later,
educators and teachers are going to
have full responsibility for writing
programmed materials" and feels that
his rules will be useful in that capa-
city.
A deeper system of program prep-
aration is called Mathetics, a term de-
rived from a Greek word meaning "to
have to do with learning." T. F. Gil-
bert, its originator, describes it as a
technology for taking the guesswork
out of programming by systematically
applying a number of precise be-
havioral principles.22 Perhaps the most
comprehensive approach to the ques-
tion of "how to program" is found in
Hughes.23 His approach is one which
follows the program from planning to
writing through revising to a student
tryout. It contains detailed explana-
tions of the many pitfalls to beware,
covering each fully. It can not be said
that any one of these methods is defi-
nitely superior to any other and they
are all too complex to be presented in
a good light here; but it can be said
that much more work will necessarily
be done in the field before any person
will be able to judge these systems
reasonably.
Despite the fact that all of the meth-
ods of programming have a similar
defined set of instructional objectives,
certain major areas of difference are
obvious. These are most likely due to
the differences in programming phi-
losophies, but can be grouped into
three categories and discussed as such.
The "size of step" is the first problem
encountered. This may refer to the
difficulty (and hence the probability
of error) of an item, or it may refer to
the increment in difficulty of succes-
sive steps or sets of steps in a pro-
gram.-'
Skinner has said that steps must be
small and easy, to keep irrelevant or
incorrect responses from entering into
the behavior pattern. Crowder is at
the opposite pole when he claims that
the size of step (length of frame)
should be greater and error should be
possible, as he believes that the stu-
dent has to be aware of, and under-
stand, the incorrect responses he is
most likely to make. More recent work
in the field comes to varying conclu-
sions. Keislar began an experiment
with a large step, multiple-choice pro-
gram (error inducing) and found that
he had to introduce smaller steps and
a greater number of items to get better
posttest scores.25 The conclusion was
that two or three versions of a program
may be necessary because of student
differences.
"One of the few pieces of solid ex-
perimental evidence . . . comes from
the experiments of Macoby, Sheffield,
and Margolius.20 Short steps were
found better than long ones, but it
was also concluded that self regulation
of step length leads to the choosing of
increasing size as the learning pro-
gressed and gave better performance.
The resolution of this question will
involve a complex of factors; those
presently dealty with may not tell the
full story. This concern is evident in
the approach of Briggs, Goldbeck,
Campbell, and Nichols, as they find
that some unmentioned till now read-
ing conditions are superior in time
efficiency when the posttest is in dif-
ferent language than the training
items. Reading conditions are found
to be better (have greater transfer
value) than overt responses. But if
posttests contain training items or
language similar to the program, overt
response learning is found to be
better.2T These findings present the
necessity for further research along
other untried lines.
The second problem, covert versus
overt responses, is a pronounced one,
with most researchers favoring overt
responses. This is due to analogies
with operant conditioning, where the
environment is to be acted upon, indi-
cating a necessary overt response. This
response per se. is seen to be intimately
connected to learning by Skinner. He
is, however, not supported by Stolurow
and Walker, who did specific research
on the topic and came to the conclu-
sion that "learning, under the condi-
tions prevailing in this study, is more
efficient with a covert response
method."-"1 There were no reliable
differences in learning or retention,
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


programs were significantly better (.05)
for the covert response method.
One can also wonder if the con-
structed response is actually large
enough (it is usually only one word)
to constitute much thought or reason-
ing in the sense that composition is
normally thought to. The general
opinion that covert replies are as good
as overt brought up the idea that, per-
haps, if the covert responses were re-
quired by the frame in the form of a
question, more would be learned. Al-
though this seems a natural enough
assumption, it was proven not to hold.
It is felt now that no response at all
is needed; the learner can be passive.20
An overriding question in program-
ming will compare branching with
linear programs. The third problem
is: can a single sequence of items be
optimally effective for a number of
students? If a set sequence can be
effective, linear programming will be
favored. If not, then branching is the
implied answer. But studies compar-
ing straight line to branching pro-
grams get only equivocal results. Roe
wondered if the seemingly random
differences in program results were
clue to the uniqueness of each indi-
vidual program.30 Others wondered if
branching was being attempted too
soon, that it should be dependent on
a series of items.31 Then an experi-
ment was set up, comparing branch-
ing, where it was dependent of stu-
dent errors, to cases where it was
dependent on the student's volition
(in this case the student could decide
to go either backward or forward).
The results of posttests were signifi-
cantly in favor of branching, as com-
pared to linear programs, but only
where branching depended on the
student's volition.32 In a larger view,
the thought in this area is favorable to
branching where it accomplishes a
"more accurate diagnosis of student
needs" and provides "more effective
remedial materials for filling those
needs."33
Programmed learning has been criti-
cized in many ways, but the most
appropriate to the discussion of this
field are the ones which are critical of
the theoretical basis of programming.
The question most quickly generated
is a wondering on how "shaping" in
operant conditioning can be taken to
be analogous to the problems of rea-
soning and understanding.34 Lums-
daine pursues this line, finding that
the results of operant conditioning
studies are applicable only to operant
conditioning. Programs do not put
their emphasis on shaping operant
forms of behavior; they emphasize the
presentation of cues leading to the
elicitation of a desired response which
is to be reinforced. It is noted that
behavior in operant conditioning is
not readly elicited by already identi-
fied and available cues, as is evidently
the case in programmed learning.
"Thus it should be recognized that
the true basis for programmed instruc-
tion is not S-R reinforcement theory,
but S-R contiguity theory . . ,"8B
In another approach Kendler rec-
ognizes that programmed learning can
be the most efficient exploiter of the
basic education method of immediate
reinforcement and can also shape be-
havior from concrete ideas to complex
abstract ones at a pace different for
each individual. In concurring with
other criticisms he would drop Skin-
ner's "ultrapositivistic, systematic posi-
tion," as he finds that behavior can
be better controlled from the basis of
learning and problem solving theories.
Work in these theoretical fields would

answer the question raised in the area
of transfer of training and the influ-
ence of one concept on the formation
of another. The ability to transfer
training, to use what has been learned
under one set of circumstances in the
context of a new situation, may well
be the most basic problem in good
programming.
Kendler feels that a mediational
theory would take these points into
consideration, as "in some situations
behavior is not linked directly to en-
vironmental stimuli, but instead is
mediated by implicit responses that
function as cues for subsequent or
overt behavior."36 Problems of trans-
fer and concept formation are pro-
duced in the organism's ability to gen-
erate appropriate response produced
cues. This problem can be pursued in
two ways: (1) by seeing implicit S-R
events functioning as do observable
S-R events, or (2) by seeing symbolic
behavior as the mediational step and
working within principles similar to
those of S-R learning theory. At any

Students Rarely Suffer
Recently certain students raised
their voices in protest over various
conditions at the University. There
was a movement for higher wages for
students employed by the University,
followed by the formation of a stu-
dent employees" union. Living condi-
tions in the dormitories were attacked.
Also there were demands for more
political freedom, a rather ambigious
appeal inspired by the notorious dem-
onstrations at the University of Cali-
fornia. Some of our "campus leaders"
attempted to consolidate the major
complaints and form a grievance com-
mute of respectable size. Somewhere
down their list of complaints was a
rather inconspicuous request for the
reduction of faculty research work, on
the grounds that it is harming faculty
teaching, particularly at the under-
by Phil Enns graduate level. This appeal was in-
cluded apparently to add some vague
depth and importance to the list, but
it is evident that these students do not
fully realize the significance of the
complaint. Beside it, all the others
seem trivial.
Surely there has been a significant
increase in the amount of research
and development work done at Michi-
gan in recent years. Last year some S12
million was appropriated for this pur-
pose, most of it in the form of grants
for basic research and contracts for ap-
plied research and development from
the federal government. A large part
of these funds finance projects in
which faculty members are wholly or
partly involved. Many times these in-
structors are on leave, but often thev
take on research work in addition to
their teaching responsibilities.
It is not surprising that some people,
especially college rebels searching for
a cause, should attempt to relate de-
ficient faculty instruction to the in-
crease in faculty research projects. One
might expect that a professor who is
engrossed in his individual research
would be only mildly interested in the
subject matter of a class which per-
haps he has taught several semester*
already. And of course, if the instruc-
tor is not interested in what he is
teaching, he cannot possibly transmit
any enthusiasm for the subject to his
students. It is assumed that this is the
basis for the opposition to faculty re-
search.
Although there are probably certain
specific cases which support this argu-
ment, there is really no substantial evi-
dence that the increase in research is
damaging the quality of instruction at
the University. Granted, this quality
is far from perfect, but this has alwavs
been true on the college level and is
still the case in schools which do not
have large research programs. How-
was this lack of consistently good in-
struction explained in the past? The
answer is reasonable, almost obvious.
College professors generally have no
formal training in the field of educa-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


school teachers, college instructors do
not have to be certified by the state
to teach at the University. Further-
more, just as the material in college-
level courses is more difficult for the
student to grasp, so is it a greater chal-
lenge for the instructor to transfer
this more profound knowledge to the
student. And often, the man who is
qualified to teach a subject is simply
not cut out to be a teacher. These an-
swers are not satisfactory in every in-
stance, but they represent a much
stronger argument than that of the
students who blame faculty participa-
tion in research for the present qual-
ity of instruction. Certainly there are
many examples of men who are among
our most interesting and stimulating
instructors and are at the same time
engaged in research work. In any
event, only the most naive person
would expect that a professor's class-
room performance, in a course which
truly doesn't interest him, will im-
prove simply by removing his research
opportunities.
The rapid rise in volume of re-
search work and expenditures has
created numerous problems for the
University. Long before our rebellious
students began agitating against this
increase, our administration and fac-
ulty were facing the complex diffi-
culties introduced by the sudden need
for more research, especially after the
Sputnik success. New research facili-
ties were required, imposing financial
burdens on the University and on the
state. Friction developed between vari-
ous schools and departments. There
was some resentment on the part of
those faculty members who were not
benefitting from the government's gen-
erous grants. After all, the English de-
partment could not be trusted to de-
velop a guided missile component or
a new wonder drug. This conflict
transferred more pressure onto the
administration. And of course the
problem of maintaining a balance be-
tween teaching and research added to
the troubles which have never ceased
to mount.
What has the University done to
solve these problems? Among other
things, it has placed tighter controls
on the allocation of research funds to
faculty members, placing a limit on
the amount any one person can re-
ceive. This has led to the healthy con-
dition of more widely distributed
funds, giving more people the chance
for some type of research work. More
funds have become available recently
in the fields not supported by the De-
fense Department and National In-
stitutes of Health. This has helped re-
lieve to some extent the imbalance
between departments. The Rackham
funds are one such source. In addi-
tion, the policy of granting sabbati-
cals and leaves has been stepped up to
allow faculty members to devote full
time to their research in the expecta-
tion that their teaching as well as their
knowledge will be enriched. Further-
more, in the spring of 1963 the Fac-
ulty Senate formed a committee to
study specifically the possible adverse
effects of research on teaching.
It is important that the University
continue adding to its research com-
mitments for several reasons. We have
a responsibility to the nation to con-
tribute to the country's defense and
space needs. We should also feel obli-
gated to help in the work being done
in medicine, public health, social
work and other fields. Continued
growth in research at the University
can also be justified by a more self-
centered point of view. If Ann Arbor
is to preserve its position as a major
center of research it will depend on
the University's ability to keep pace
with the rest of the nation in research
achievements. Also, experience has
shown that if research is encouraged
among the faculty, more talented men
and women are attracted to Michigan
from other areas. Finally, the faculty
member engaged in research is broad-
ening his understanding in his field
of interest. This is one way to keep his
course material as current as possible.
The faculty at the University is
made up of specialized scholars, many
of whom are recognized nationally as
leaders in their chosen fields. These
are the people who are capable of per-
forming the sophisticated research and
development required by the govern-
ment and other agencies. It would be
a tremendous waste of one of our
most precious resources if this talent
were not exploited. We cannot simply
lock these people up in the laboratory
or in the classroom for they are needed
in both places.
Increased research is important to
the growth of the University and the
community. The influx of research
funds is an important contribution to
the economic wealth of the area and
the state. Added research at the Uni-
versity encourages private research in
Ann Arbor's industry as evidenced by
the development of many new com-
panies like Conductron and the local
divisions of Parke-Davis and Bendix.
The type of people attracted to this
environment have also contributed to
Ann Arbor's image as a cultural and
intellectual center. The student body
naturally profits from these improve-
ments in the institutions and the com-
munity.
The University can expect to im-
prove the quality of its faculty only
if research opportunities are offered
to the faculty. The financial gain from
research grants and contracts is not
the only reward for the professor. If
he is the intellectual which his Ph.D.
or Master's degree indicates, he usually
feels the need, whether for personal
satisfaction, the good of mankind or
otherwise, to contribute to man's un-
derstanding of the field in which he
is working. If the University denies
him the opportunity to do research
in this field, one should expect that he
might seek an atmosphere more con-
ducive to his research interests, per-
haps in private industry or at some
other University. During the fifties,
when state support for research facil-
ities was weak, Michigan lost some of
its top scientists. Examples of such
men are Professor Leo Goldberg,
former chairman of the astronomy de-
partment who went to Harvard, and
physicist Donald Glaser, the Nobel
prize winner who left for the Univer-
sity of California.
Faculty research often leads indi-
rectly to improved faculty teaching.
Although the knowledge gained in re-
search may not be directly applicable
to a professor's course, it helps in-
crease his overall understanding of
the field. Individual research is simply
one of several ways that he can use to
update his class materials. Reading
current articles and attending semi-
nars are others. All of these contrib-
ute to his effectiveness as an instruc-
tor.
A university should perforin three
basic functions. It should preserve
knowledge for the future generations,
transfer it to the present generation
and build on today's knowledge with
research for tomorrow. In particular,
a large school like Michigan cannot be
content with teaching new students
old ideas. Research must be performed
by those with the ability. The mem-
bers of our faculty have this ability.
The level of classroom instruction
must surely be raised, but not at the
expense of the work which these
people can accomplish.

Engineers
can
without the
bolts
Blue-sky theorizing is essential to engineering. In
fact, it is the ignition point for all technological
achievement. But the best ideas in and out of this
world can fail if the proving ground, the testing
lab, or the constructive cynicism of mature co-
professionals aren't available to question an idea
or a product's ultimate function. □ Engineers
working without these facilities wind up talking
only to themselves — and there's a word for that
condition. Hamilton Standard management long
ago recognized that in the marketplaces of the
aerospace industry, a company's ability to pro-
duce a workable article is largely measured by
two basic criteria: the genius of its people ... and
the physical resources at their immediate dis-
posal. Hamilton Standard is the "compleat" en-
gineering organization. The company is a unique
blend of many advanced projects, specialized
engineering skills ... plus exceptional research,
laboratory and manufacturing facilities. □ Pres-
ent projects involve environmental control sys-
tems, engine controls, starters and turbomachin-
ery, air induction controls, propellers, electron
beam technology, ground support equipment,
electronics, thrust vector controls, bioscience
research and spacecraft life support systems.
This broad product range requires, obviously, an
engineering team with a wide variety of engineer-
ing skills. □ The group of over one thousand
graduate engineers and technicians are skilled in
such disciplines as Aerodynamics, Cryogenics,
Control Dynamics, Electronics (including Micro-
electronics), Electron Optics, Engineering Phys-
ics, Fluid Dynamics, Heat Transfer, Hydraulics,
Instrumentation, Mechanics, Metallurgy, Physical
Chemistry, Servomechanisms, Structures, Stress
Analysis, Thermodynamics. Working in Project
Task Forces, the men involved multiply their
knowledge by mixing intelligence and constantly
communicating problems . . . and solutions. □
Available as tools to our engineers are Divisional
facilities of over 1.5 million square feet. These
facilities have established Hamilton Standard as
a world leader in contributing to state-of-the-art
advances in vibrations, aerodynamics, hydraulics,
and control dynamics, among others. A recently
completed space simulator for manned missions
will further advance the state-of-the-art in life sup-
port systems, when Division engineers outfitted
in our space suits conduct tests at a simulated
altitude of approximately 1,500,000 feet. □ If you

EDUCATION
AND
RESEARCH
by Paul Niffenegger
Allergies bring many persons dis-
comfort, partial disability, and some-
times real misery. They take many
forms, such as hay fever, asthma, skin
rashes, and certain kinds of headache.
A sufferer may react to well nigh any-
thing: pollen, dust, molds, milk, eggs,
raw vegetables, animal dander, or even
watermelon.
The study of allergy could easily be
lost in a maze of complexity and un-
certainty. Manifestly, one method of
proceeding is to study one more or
less arbitrarily limited phase inten-
sively. Since 1955 such a study has
been in progress at the University, un-
der the sponsorship of the U.S. Public
Health Service's National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases and its
Division of Air Pollution. Centered on
ragweed and its effects, the study has
had many ramifications, requiring co-
operation among botanists, meteorolo-
gists, allergists, and biostatisticians.
This interdisciplinary approach has
proved fruitful indeed. The project
lias produced results which otherwise
might not have been forthcoming for
years. Much has been learned about
ragweed itself, the means by which its
pollen is distributed, and its effects on
sensitive persons. The purpose of this
article is to describe briefly some of
the methods of approach, the results
obtained so far, and the plans for fu-
ture research.
At first the subject of the study was
aeroallergens in general. (Allergens
are substances that can give rise to
allergic reactions; aeroallergens are
allergens carried in the air.) But the
various researchers soon concentrated
on ragweed, because it is found in
much of the United States west of the
Appalachians, it is a major contribu-
tor of pollen to the atmosphere, and
its pollen seems to be about as aller-
genic as any widespread aeroallergen
known. Much of the knowledge being
amassed about this one source of aero-
allergen will be applicable to allergens
in general and to other atmospheric
pollutants as well. If any further justi-
fication for studying ragweed were
needed, it could be found in well
based estimates that ragweed affects
more people in the United States than
does smog.
Botanical activities in the project,
supervised by Professor Warren H.
Wagner, Jr., have been partly sup-
portive and partly independent. The
botanists have provided ragweed
plants and pollen in great quantity
for experimental use by meteorologists
and allergists, and have also gathered
knowledge on the plant and its ecol-
ogy and phenology which has been in-
dispensable to the work in the other
phases. Moreover, much of the botan-
ical work has formed a solid contribu-
tion to botanical knowledge.
Four species of ragweed are found
in Michigan. The most widespread is
the common ragweed, Ambrosia ar-
ternisiifolia, also called short ragweed,
dwarf ragweed, hogweed, bitterweed.
and Roman wormwood. It grows from
one to three feet tall, and has lacy
leaves that wilt during hot, dry after-
noons; hence the name ragweed. In
Michigan it will grow wherever the
ground has been disturbed: in fields
from which grain has been harvested,
in areas cleared to make way for hous-
ing developments, and along roadsides
and railroads. It is crowded out by
grasses and other weeds within a few
years, but meanwhile new areas have
been disturbed and infested, mainly
by seeds which have presumably been
distributed by passing through the di-

est percentage of airborne pollen
comes from the common ragweed.
Both botanists and meteorologists
worked long and carefully to deter-
mine exactly what causes a mature,
pollen-laden floret to discharge. Sev-
eral natural conditions are under-
going change during the time of de-
hiscence: the light becomes much
stronger, the temperature increases,
the relative humidity drops, and the
water supply from the roots of the
plant diminishes. The botanists con-
ducted careful laboratory experiments
in which three of these conditions
were held constant while the fourth
was changed. The experiments were
too extensive to be detailed here; suf-
fice to say that botanists and meteor-
ologists, cooperating closely, found
that dehiscence is inhibited by low
temperature and high relative hu-
midity. The anthers will not extend
unless the temperature is at least
30°C, and the percentage of extended
florets that will discharge increases as
the relative humidity decreases; none
were observed to dehisce when relative
humidity was as high at 80%. As the
nocturnal chill is dispelled, then, and
as the dew dries, the mature flowers
extend their anthers and release their
pollen. The botanists have concluded
that the mechanism involved is drying
of the walls of the anther sacs, which
changes the water tension in the cells
that make up these walls. The cells
undergo differential distortions which
force the pollen out.
Meteorological work on the project,
directed by Professor E. Wendell Hew-
son, has been concerned with two basic
questions. First, how is ragweed pollen
diffused into the atmosphere? That is,
how does it get from the ragweed plant
to the mucous membranes of human
beings? Second, is it possible to de-
velop methods of predicting the
amount of pollen that can be expected
in the atmosphere? After years of re-
search, the first question has been
partly answered; study of the second
is under way.
Essential to studies of diffusion of
pollen has been the development of
instruments which will accurately
measure the number of pollen grains
in a cubic unit of air. Several different
samplers, varying in complexity, have
been tried; all have been found to
have advantages and disadvantages:
the membrane filter, the flag sampler
designed by Mr. James B. Harrington.
Assistant Research Meteorologist, and
the rotobar sampler.
The most recent sampler, developed
by Dr. Alan L. Cole, Associate Re-
search Meteorologist, and Mr. Albert
Stohrer, Assistant Research Engineer,
is the rotodisc sampler. Here, as with
the rotobar sampler, the inertia of the
pollen grain is put to work. A mast is
topped by a rotating arm, on either
end of which is a sampling unit. Inside
each unit is a horizontal disc, l/g inch
of whose leading edge, coated with ad-
hesive, is exposed to the air. As the
arm rotates, at 1725 rpm, air is de-
flected but the inertia of the pollen
grains makes them strike the exposed
section of the disc. A stepping mech-
anism in the sampler's motor turns
the disc inside its cover at pro
grammed intervals which can lie ad-
justed in five-minute increments; thus
a new section of the edge of the disc
is exposed as often as necessary, and
the pollen grains on each section can
be counted to establish pollen concen-
tration in the atmosphere at successive
times of the day.
With these various instruments, the
meteorologists have conducted exten-
sive experiments to determine how
ragweed pollen, once discharged from
the plant, is diffused through the at-
mosphere. Early diffusion studies were
out-of-season experiments with pollen
from plants provided by the Depart-
ment of Botany and the University's
Botanical Gardens.
The first preseasonal experiment
was performed at a plot on the Uni-
versity's North Campus in |une, 1956.
In this pilot experiment, 136 ragweed
plants brought to flower ahead of the
season were set out in a small plot,
glass gravity slides coated with petro-
latum were set out in a circular array
at various distances, and the pollen
grains that adhered to the slides were
counted. This experiment having
demonstrated the feasibility of out-of-
season studies, a much larger one was
carried out the next year. Late in
June, 1957, 3056 flowering ragweed
plants were set out in a field of the
Prison Farm near Jackson.
When the slides were counted (not
until December 25, 1957, for slide
counting is a long and tedious proc-
ess), certain qualitative findings were
clearly established. These and other
experiments have fairly well estab-
lished that most ragweed pollen never
becomes airborne, but rather falls
within two or three feet of the plant
and stays there. Only relatively few
grains become airborne; the percent-
age depends on variations in the at-
mosphere's capability for lifting pol-
len. Those that do become airborne
behave about like any other twenty-
micron particle in the atmosphere.
Many fall to the ground; others may
be carried upwards by convection cur-
rents to heights as great as five to ten
thousand feet.
Further experiments have been
aimed toward finding the source of
ragweed pollen in cities which may
be many miles from any sizable source.
Several different methods have been
used. In one, meteorologists sought
out pollen in Washtenaw County, the
University's home county. They trav-
eled a specific route several times
daily, taking pollen counts with a
flag sampler which was attached to
the automobile and was changed once
every mile. Thus they established that
roadside stands of ragweed are only
very minor sources of pollen; the ma-
jor ones, contributing something like
eighty to ninety percent of the pollen
that gets into the atmosphere, are
cereal grain fields left unplowed after
harvesting.
What might be called phase one of
the meteorological studies, then, is
nearly completed: the means by which
pollen is distributed are understood,
and the quantity from a known source
that will reach a given point can, with-
in limits, be predicted. Future work in
this phase will be directed toward re-
finement of principles already formu-
lated. One project will be to under-
take a more thorough study of surface
deposition, especially on different
kinds of vegetation. This will involve
micrometeorological observation of air
turbulence within the vegetative layer,
and establishment of how much pol-
len different kinds of vegetation will
collect. The mathematical model now
in use is a rather simple one, and is to
undergo considerable refinement; but
even in its present form it is useful, for
within it various parameters can be
adjusted to allow for different kinds
of vegetation and different kinds and
sizes of particle—such as radioactive
fallout.
Further research will proceed with
efforts at making long-range predic-
tions. Samplers, which are now much
more reliable, are to be set up at sev-
eral stations. The total count from all
the samplers at a given station, for
each clay throughout the pollen season,

to humidity, wind direction, tempera-
ture, and other meteorological phe-
nomena. Also the variations in pollen
count and weather during the day will
be compared; the rotodisc sampler will
be indispensable here.
From the pollen counts thus ob-
tained, two-dimensional aerial displays
of pollen concentrations at various
times, analogous to weather maps, can
be formed; comparison of these with
real weather maps is expected to be
highly informative. For example, let
us look at a common pattern in south-
eastern Michigan. Ordinarily the pre-
vailing wind is south by southwest,
and in the ragweed season the pollen
concentration is high. After a cold
front passes, however, the wind shifts
to the northwest, and the pollen con-
centration drops sharply. Two pos-
sible explanations are obvious: that
there are few sources of ragweed pol-
len to the northwest, or that the drop
in temperature has lessened dehis-
cence. Some other explanation, not
yet known, may be the correct one.
Comparison of weather maps and
maps showing pollen concentrations
is expected to provide evidence on
which to base something more reliable
that educated guesses.
To process the huge amounts of
data that will come in from weather
stations and pollen samplers, the Uni-
versity's IBM 7090 computer and the
Meteorology Computer Laboratory's
analog computer facilities will be
brought into play. Here again the sta-
tisticians have been and will continue
to be invaluable, in suggesting ways
to collect data in a form that will lend
itself to computer processing, in help-
ing with the actual processing, and in
training the meteorologists to do much
of their own processing.
A plan projected for some years in
the future, but too intriguing not to
mention here, is the processing of data
by a technique of optical diffraction
developed by the Radar Laboratory of
the University's Institute of Science
and Technology. Application of this
technique can give both the frequency
of occurrence of different phenomena
and the correlations between them.
The principles can be adapted for the
meteorologists' needs so that, by super-
imposing overlays and by other meth-
ods, weather patterns can be corre-
lated with pollen concentrations much
more quickly than by use of the digital
computer. Two kinds of correlation
will l&gt;e made. First one map will
simply be superimposed on the other,
and the optical processor will com-
pare them. Second, the two maps will
be shifted with relation to each other
to see what turns up—for instance, the
effect, if any, of rain in Toledo on the
pollen count in Ann Arbor.
As these brief descriptions of botani-
cal and meteorological studies have
shown, production and distribution of
ragweed pollen have been studied in
great detail. The next step in the proc-
ess is consumption.
Medical activities on this project
are under the direction of Dr. John
M. Sheldon. In a sense, these are the
activities to which all the others are
at least partly supportive, for they
deal directly with individual sufferers
from the effects of aeroallergens.
Their basic purpose, obviously, is to
find means of giving relief to those
sufferers. To do so, allergists need ac-
cess to all available knowledge about
ragweed pollen itself and the means
by which it is diffused. They need to
know, in the completest detail, how
pollen causes reactions in the human
being, and what forms those reactions
can take—questions inextricably re-
lated but nevertheless distinct.
One current theory about the mech-
anism of atopic reaction is that when
a sensitized person is exposed to an
antigen, his tissues release histamine
and other substances intensely active
in promoting dilatation of capillaries
and increased fluid leakage. Hence the
hay fever victim sneezes, his mucous
glands oversecrete, his eyes itch and
become bloodshot, and he wishes he
were dead. If the histamine is released
in the bronchial tree, the resultant
dilatation of his blood vessels, spasms
of the smooth muscles, and production
of mucus make his breathing difficult,
and he has asthma—even more un-
pleasant, and indeed alarming.
The first part of the allergists' pro-
gram was the intensive study of aller-
gic persons in the State Prison of
Southern Michigan in Jackson. This
site was chosen because it afforded an
opportunity of observing allergic
symptoms among men living in a con-
trolled and known environment—eat-
ing the same food, living by the same
regime, and available on call. The
allergists found, not surprisingly, that
symptoms increased with pollen
count; but less expectedly, they found
that though the drop in pollen count
as the season waned brought some re-
lief to asthmatics, it brought much less
to hay fever sufferers. This was puz-
zling and unaccountable. The aller-
gists have speculated that the sufferers
may have developed "superimposed"
bacterial infection, or that tissues un-
dergoing allergic reactions may de-
velop heightened reactivity to allergic
and irritant agents. Further, though
the various findings of the botanists
and the meteorologists had shown that
the time of highest pollen count is
from 8:00 to 10:00 a.m. or 12:00 noon,
almost every patient reported that he
experienced the severest symptoms be-
tween 6:00 (the time of rising at the
prison) and 8:00 or 9:00 a.m. This
too was puzzling and unaccountable.
Among the many findings in the
Jackson Prison studies, the least equiv-
ocal was that even in an environment
as closely controlled as this there are
far too many uncontrollable variables.
For example, if a man is sensitive to
pollen from both ragweed and grasses
(whose pollen seasons approximately
coincide), how can anyone state with
certainity whether at a given time he
is reacting to one or the other?
There is a way to answer this ques-
tion and others like it: put the man
(who should be experiencing no cur-
rent symptoms) into an airtight cham-
ber, expose him to a known concen-
tration of a particular kind of pollen
for a controlled length of time, and
see what happens—a simple plan, but
not so simple to effectuate.
The test chamber has been a major
part of research under this project.
Meteorologists originally suggested
and designed it, but allergists have
made it their province. In particular.
Dr. William R. Solomon of the Mont-
gomery Allergy Research Laboratory
and the Department of Internal Medi-
cine has been concerned with it. Com-
pleted in 1959, it stands in the Allergy
Laboratory in the Kresge Medical Re-
search Building, and has an inside
floor area of 9 X 8 feet and an inside
height of 7.3 feet. Air containing a
known amount of pollen rises through
the floor grid into the chamber, and
out through ducts at the top. It moves
through the chamber at a rate of four
feet per minute, slow enough not to be
noticeable to the two persons the
chamber can accommodate. Tempera-
ture and humidity can be controlled
within acceptable and precise limits.

get a more exact and fast indentifica-
tion of whales or submarines. The
second method is the use of infrared
photography. Pictures can be taken
of an area which vessels have left sev-
eral hours before, and their outlines
are still visible on a plate due to the
heat patterns that the hulls generated.
Thus the approximate size and type
of a single ship or task force could be
determined long after it has left or
passed through position.
While sonar is having problems
with creatures, certain of them are
answering several pressing problems.
Through the widening scope of ocean-
ography, the features that ocean crea-
tures have adopted in order to sur-
vive are studied and applied to many
important marine situations. The por-
poise is perhaps one of the outstand-
ing creatures. Its built-in sonar that
can emit up to 400 cps is far more sen-
sitive and accurate than any now even
under development. Also the porpoise
has a soft outer layer of skin which
yields to any eddy that may form along
the surface as it swims. By yielding to
the eddy, it breaks it up sufficiently
to decrease the effect of drag. A similar
adaptation has been made on large
scale models of submarines which have
many small foam rubber cylinders at-
tached to the hull, covered with a thin
foam rubber sheet. The space between
the soft outer skin and the hull is filled
with a high-viscosity liquid. When
these models have been subjected to
water tests, they have shown nearly
a 50% less braking effect. Another use
of bionics is from the study of the eel
and the knife fish which are able to
sense, not see or hear, their environ-
ment by any disturbance to the field
around them. Knowing the nature of
this sense would enable the effective
tracking of large vessels by passive
means. Still another application is
the use of algae which multiply very
rapidly to freshen the air, absorb CO.,
and give off Oz in the confined spaces
of submarines or other DDVs. These
processes are clone at present by bulky,
heavy machines. Thus the search for
speed, detection methods, and econ-
omy for military purposes, will one
day result in fast, efficient submarine
merchant fleets. Indeed, we may one
day look back at today's fleets with
amusement.
The fleets of tomorrow cannot
flourish, however, without knowledge
and application of oceanographic
studies. At one time submarines had
portholes. However, they were quickly
plugged due to leaks. But that was
long ago; and with space craft and
bathescaphes both having port holes
subject to extreme pressures, why not
have them in submarine fleets of the
future? At the depths these vehicles
would travel, light would penetrate,
and at night plankton and other lu-
minescent marine life would enhance
the seascape. Both pleasure and ad-
vancement of oceanographic study
would result. With scale models of
100,000 ton submarine tankers even
now being tested, the prospects for
the "fantastic" future seem ever closer.
Naval submarines may have bow
"port holes" to accommodate the new
developments of the TV camera for
added effectivity in tracking.
Another advance in design is the
perfectly round hull of the new nu-
clear submarines. This design, differ-
ing from the flat-top deck, gives a far
more hydrodynamically perfect shape
and therefore a greater speed. The
shape of surface vessels are also chang-
ing. Hydrofoils which lift a craft out
of the water at relatively low speeds
enable it to obtain high speeds with-
out the drag of the entire hull. These
hydrofoils are not only express pas-
senger boats, but they are becoming
the fast sub chasers of the Navy
Hunter-Killer fleets. In rough water,
these craft can leave the 'foils extended
below the surface, and they then act
as very effective stabilizers at slower
speeds. Yet another design improve-
ment for conventional hulls is the
bulbous bow.1 This protrudes below
the water line and creates a third
wave which cancels out one of the
other bow waves. It thus lessens the
drag and increases the speed and econ-
omy of the ship.
A prominent event in the history
of oceanographic research is the
tragedy of the USS Thresher, which
not long ago sank in 8000 ft of water
with a loss of 129 men. A statement
from Congress's Joint Committee on
Atomic Energy says, "checking a
sample of 145 silver-brazed joints in
sea water pipes which were already
installed aboard the Thresher, build-
ers at the Portsmouth, N.H., yard
found 14% of the joints had substand-
ard bonds." "After the Thresher dis-
aster, it (the Navy) found that the
buoyancy tanks couldn't be blown
dry because ice had formed in the
high-pressure air lines." Unfortunate
as the disaster was, it yielded some im-
portant information. First, it was
made clear that a naval DDV, capable
of salvaging parts of the ill-fated sub-
marine should be constructed. Sec-
ondly, we came to realize the defi-
ciency of our knowledge about deep
underwater conditions, such as tem-
peratures and pressures. In not blam-
ing any special groups, it appears that
lives can be saved at the present by
simply learning and applying an ele-
mentary knowledge of the ocean.
A final illustration of what can be
learned from oceanographic research
concerns the design of mechanical
parts to withstand extreme pressure.
One such problem involves the mov-
ing doors on torpedo tubes, while an-
other deals with the design of mechan-
ical arms that research craft must use
to pick up samples and do work on
the ocean floor.
In order to propel these fleets of
vessels, new concepts are quickly de-
veloping. The nuclear submarine has
been the utmost achievement so far:
but, as is shown by the entrance of
outer space propulsion companies into
that field of inner space, the ultimate
in power will come in the form of the
water jet and power booster design
rather than the presently used screw.
Speeds under water will, of course, be
limited by the degree of perfection
for sonar and course direction equip-
ment. Detailed charts must be made
of the ocean floor, for many peaks rise
to the level of submersibles' lanes of
travel.
The limits of size for surface craft
are now being reached, but future sub-
marines will be far larger and travel
faster. It takes very little energy to get
going in the ocean—simply change an
object's density and it will submerge.
However, to launch a missile from a
light jet takes an enormous amount of
energy, and this must be constant to
keep the machine in the air and off
of the ground. Not so in water. An-
other illustration is that for the SS
Queen Mary to make 30 knots re-
quires 150,000 hp. For her to make 60
knots would require 1,500,000 hp., and
five times more fuel. On the other
hand, a submarine tanker of 80,000
tons to make (&gt;0 knots would only re-
quire one-third of that power.2
To build faster, deeper-diving sub-
marines will require the Navy's use of
metals such as those used in outer
space craft. Titanium and beryllium
are exceedingly strong and light but at
the moment expensive and difficult to
use. Ideally, aluminum would be used,
42
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


steels are therefore used most often.
A new ceramic-glass called Pyroceram
which has a high strength to weight
ratio and whose implosion limit is
364,OOOpsi is becoming widely ac-
cepted. The main drawback is need
for resins to bind the precast forms
together.
Even for the Arctic there is a new
method to build runways and other
structures. Rather simple, it consists
of fiber-glass strands frozen over with
water. This forms a very strong ma-
terial; so strong in fact that a i/2-inch
diameter tube will support the weight
of a man. To replenish current ma-
terials there are nodules of manga-
nese, cobalt, copper and zinc lying in
great quantities on the ocean floor.
These deposits will replace the supply
of minerals that are dwindling even
now and soon be used to build the
DDVs that will gather the rich ores
from the ocean bottom.
In all warfare, vicious weapons of
all types are used, and submarine war-
fare is no exception. At the moment
in ASW the weapons are not increas-
ing in size and range due to the lack
of perfected, long-range detection
equipment. Though Polaris type sub-
marines are lethal, they do not essen-
tially attack other vessels. However,
the "nuke" attack subs are deadly to
any hostile vessel anywhere. United
States Navy surface craft are equipped
with nuclear and high explosive war-
head anti-submarine missiles, torpe-
does and depth charges. The newest
and most deadly weapon is an anti-
submarine torpedo known as the
Mark 46. This weapon will, when fired
toward the general area of a target,
move in increasingly larger circles
hunting for its prey. It then switches
to sonar and searches out the sub-
marine with progressive zig-zag courses
until the intruder is found and de-
stroyed. The torpedo is, however, at-
tracted toward any ship that is in its
vicinity, therefore to protect the
launching vessel, the torpedo will not
operate above a certain depth of
water. The foremost submarine-sub-
marine weapon is the recently oper-
ationalized SUBROC underwater-air-
underwater missile which is fired from
the torpedo tubes of a Thresher class
submarine. It breaks the surface and
may travel up to 25 or 30 miles be-
fore reentering the water and search-
ing for its prey. The limits of these
weapons are due to the difficulty of
detecting and correctly identifying
submarines. In tests, the weapons have
proved to be deadly accurate, and in
test firings dummy torpedoes have re-
peatedly survived the initial strike to
continue buffeting the target sub-
marine again and again. If a sub
should try to rise above the limit of
the torpedoes, it would expose itself
to open assault on the surface. If a
counter torpedo is launched, the first
one can release a smaller missile to
intercept the counter torpedo and
allow the target to be hit. Other track-
ing methods are exploited in mines as
well as in torpedoes that use the
ocean's properties to destroy their
prey. Each can be made to explode
either on contact, or by responding
to changes in pressure, noise, magnetic
fluctuations or infrared reception of
heat from the target craft.
As to the future, apart from those
things already mentioned, sonar buoys
will pass a ship from one buoy to an-
other by automatic relay across oceans.
Many more buoys will be deposited
to test the currents, salinity, tempera-
ture and pressure of the ocean at many
positions. Along with this data, and
the watch kept for hostiles, will be the
observation and identification of
schools of fish, vital to the world's
future diet. Passive and active buoys
such as SPAR, the seagoing platform
for acoustical research, will become
numerous as beacons to merchant
fleets above and below the surface,
and as deterrents to unwanted or
"straying" craft.
We can see that the ocean truly
represents a key to the future of
mankind. In the ocean is the power
for life, but also power for death
and destruction. Which of these
powers will take precedence in the
future depends largely on which coun-
tries decide to accept the challenges of
oceanographic research. America must
not pass up this opporunity and this
challenge.
Discussed in the January 1965 issue
of the Michigan Technic, the Mohole
project has at long last gained some
governmental support in a $70 million
grant from the Science Research Foun-
dation. Involved will be the construc-
tion of a huge drilling platform to re-
place the converted barge that had
previously been used. Also a new tech-
nique of drilling that is far faster and
economical than that currently used
will be employed. Although construc-
tion will not be completed lor many
months, the grant has removed much
of the burden on deleted private
funds, and has put an end to the bick-
erings between scientists and congress-
men over the value of the project.
Private companies, like the Westing-
house Electric Corporation, are realiz-
ing the wealth of the oceans. This
company recently announced a "chart-
ing service" for any group that wishes
to use its newly developed research
equipment and diving craft as well as
the necessary technicians. Here are
evidences that a few alert Americans
have realized the potentials of the
oceans, but how large and effective a
fleet of vitally needed research craft
can one highly diversified company
alone operate?

rate, a great deal of credence is at-
tached to the position that an increase
in knowledge of the psychology of
transfer and symbolic processes will
lead to the programming of courses
with greater learning value.
Perhaps the most useful view of the
problems involved in research in pro-
grammed learning is that its methods
follow those of traditional physical
science, but when dealing with human
learning, these methods are inappro-
priate.37 Criterion measures are weak,
only a certain amount of variables can
be examined at one time, and the
major performance measures—learning
time and test scores—have not been
either separated or combined so as to
give an adequate rationale for specify-
ing the efficiency of the learning-teach-
ing process. To find little of statistical
or social significance in programming
experiments is not, then, surprising at
this time.
In summation, programmed learn-
ing has its characteristics manifested
primarily in the work of Skinner and
Crowder, who differ in many particu-
lars, but who are working to the same
end, using the science of psychology as
a basis for the evolution of a new edu-
cational process. Various methods of
programming other than theirs have
been created, and the field is still ex-
panding. Yet one can not help but
notice the practical and theoretical
partisan splits in the body of knowl-
edge compiled by these men. Much
has to be done to even clarify the exact
basis of the science, since even the
theoretical grounds of programmed
learning are not at all agreed upon
by the more eminent men engaging in
this study of learning processes as they
relate to the distinct field of program-
ming.
But harsh criticism is simply undue.
Granted that theoretical questioning
is necessary, is it not the rationale of
science that what is useful, what works
to a desirable end, should be used
until it can be replaced by a more
valid approach? In that respect it is
recognized that, as a fledgling science,
programmed learning must be ac-
cepted as a very promising and excit-
ing field. It has already proven itself
on an empirical basis and will at least
partially fulfill the prophesy of Pressey
in the future.

Garrett-AiResearch? You'll have to
work harder and use more of
your knowledge than engineers
at most other companies.
If you're our kind of engineer,
you have some very definite ideas
about your career.
For example:
You've worked hard to get a
good education. Now you want to
put it to work in the best way
possible.
You will never be satisfied with
run-of-the-mill assignments. You
demand exciting,
challenging projects.
You not only accept
individual responsibil-
ity — you insist upon it.
Does that sound like
you? Then AiResearch
is your cup of tea.
Our business is
mainly in sophisticated aerospace
systems and subsystems.
Here, research, design, and de-
velopment lead to production of
actual hardware.
That means you
have the oppor-
tunity to start with
a customer's problem
and see it through to a
system that will get the job done.
The product lines at AiResearch,
Los Angeles Division, are environ-
mental systems, flight information
gag and controls sys-
tems, heat transfer
systems, secondary
power generator
systems for missiles
and space, electri-
cal systems, and
specialized indus-
trial systems.
In the Phoenix Division there are
gas turbines for propulsion and
secondary power, valves and con-
trol systems, air turbine starters
and motors, solar and nuclear
power systems.
In each category AiResearch
employs three kinds of engineers.
Preliminary design engineers do
the analytical and theoretical
work, then write proposals.
Design engineers do the lay-
outs; turn an idea into a product.
Developmental engineers are
responsible for making hardware
out of concepts.
Whichever field fits you best, we
can guarantee you this: you can
go as far and fast as your talents
can carry you. You can make as
much money as any engineer in a
comparable spot — anywhere. And
of course, at AiResearch, you'll
get all the plus benefits a top com-
pany offers.
Our engineering staff is smaller
than comparable companies. This
spells opportunity. It gives a man
who wants to make a mark plenty
of elbow room to expand. And
while he's doing it he's working
with, and learning from, some of
the real pros in the field.
If the AiResearch story sounds
like opportunity speaking to you—
don't fail to contact AiResearch,

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
Scientific and technological advances since the 1940's
have created demands for trained engineers that grow
faster than the supply of young, vigorous talent coming
into the field.
If you are a student with solid ability in mathematics,
science and English and you have a sense of curiosity
that makes you want to know more about how some-
thing is put together, and if you have a creative urge
to design and build a new or better product, or find a
better method of doing a job, you should carefully
consider engineering as a profession.
Engineers use the basic laws of the physical science
to serve mankind. They know how to change the ma-
terials found in nature into more useful forms, and how
to harness forces and energy to do man's work. These
things they must do at a price that people are willing
to pay, and at which they can benefit by making a
profit in our competitive enterprise system. Through this
free market system, we who live in the U.S.A. enjoy the
highest standard of living found anywhere.
If you would like to experience the thrills that come
from adding values to our natural resources you may
wish to explore engineering as your career.

How will the really outstanding
new breakthroughs come about? I
quote from a speech by J. Henry
Rushton when he was President of
the American Institute of Chemical
Engineers:
"There is one lesson from the past
which we must not fail to remember.
In every achievement it has been the
ability of an individual person which
has sparked the new idea, or the new
application, or the new technique,
and it is in the development of the in-
dividual that we must rely for good
works in the future."
Confirming the importance of the
individual, 1 am reminded of a bit
of the homely philosophy of the late
Charles Kettering:
"There are no opportunities in en-
gineering, or in industry, or in De-
troit—there are only opportunities in
you."
It has been my pleasure to note the
remarkable progress that can be real-
ized by students with ability, and
willingness to work hard. To know
that they will fill positions of respon-
sibility, and to feel that I may have
played a small but important part in
their growth has been one of life's
most satisfying rewards.
But the future is filled with exciting
expectations. Looking ahead, we can
be sure of change. With change will
come opportunities for individual
growth. To attain full stature in the
profession of engineering, each person
must keep abreast of new develop-
ments, and remain flexible enough
to adjust to the inevitable changes in
his environment.
I covet the opportunities that lie be-
fore those who assume the responsi-
bilities of the decades ahead: as engi-
neers for achieving maximum effi-
ciency in the utilization of our ma-
terial resources, and as educators for
bringing to full blossom the most valu-
able of all resources—the human mind.
The way will not be free of rough
spots. Best wishes for a fruitful and
gratifying career.
Sincerely,
Stephen S. Attwood

Samplers, mostly of the rotobar type,
are placed at various points to pro-
vide assurance that the pollen concen-
tration has been fairly homogeneous
during each test. The chamber is thor-
oughly cleaned before each test, to en-
sure that no pollen from yesterday's
test will introduce an unrecognized
variable into today's.
Many questions await the proper
functioning of the chamber. No one
yet knows how much pollen actually
enters the respiratory system or where
it is actually deposited. Hence, no one
knows how large a dose of ragweed
pollen actually received within the
respiraloiy tree will elicit symptoms.
There is some evidence that the dose
must be small: relatively speaking, the
grains are so heavy and have so much
inertia that few of them will turn the
various corners along the nasal air-
way, pass through the screens of nasal
cilia, etc., as they must do to reach the
mucous membranes. If experiments
could be well enough controlled, the
size of the dose received could be es-
tablished. Those being designed are
complex; it is not misleading, and is
perhaps enlightening, to oversimplify
and say that a subject's reaction to
2000 grains per second will be com-
pared with his reaction to an exposure
of 200 grains per 10 seconds.
The immunochemical studies also
constitute a major part of the medical
phase of the project. The allergists in
this particular study have three basic
goals: the isolation of the antigen in
ragweed pollen; the isolation and
chemical characterization of the reagin
which develops in persons sensitive to
ragweed pollen; and the gaining of a
fuller understanding of the way in
which the antigen and reagin react to
produce symptoms.
For reasons of space, other impor-
tant medical activities will have to be
treated very briefly. One large sphere
of activity has been participation in
the Tecumseh Community Health
Study. That study, which has been
conducted since 1957 by the Univer-
sity's School of Public Health, is a
continuing evaluation of the health
of the entire population of Tecumseh,
Michigan, a town of about 9800, and
the surrounding area. Adults filled out
questionnaires and were interviewed
about their medical histories and
those of their children, and clinical
examinations and ventilatory studies
were made. About ninety percent of
the population participated. Since in
the final results children aged six or
under were not considered, the results
are based on a total of 6995 persons.
Much information was gathered about
the percentage of the population suf-
fering from allergic diseases, the age
of onset of both asthma and hay fever,
seasonal patterns of allergic com-
plaints, etc. Asthma was diagnosed in
711 persons and hay fever in 681;
these groups overlap. Of these, the
diagnoses were considered "firm" in
285 of the asthma and 439 of the hay
fever cases; 128 persons suffered from
both. In general, asthma symptoms
were found to have begun earlier than
hay fever symptoms—a finding that is
at variance with figures usually quoted
in support of the oft-made statement
that persons with hay fever, if left
untreated, tend to develop asthma.
The validity of this statement cannot
yet be judged, but the allergists' par-
ticipation in the Tecumseh Study has
turned up new volumes of data for
eventual use in deciding.
Another part of the attempt to
"quantify" symptoms of hay fever
and asthma has been the subject of
work begun fairly recently by mem-
bers of the medical and statistical
groups and of the University's Survey
Research Center. Interviews with pa-
tients at the Health Service and the
Allergy Clinic have elicited a great
deal of information about the symp-
toms of individual patients, but there
is still no method of rating one pa-
tient's symptoms in comparison with
another's or with some fixed standard.
Hence two standardized questionnaires
have been formulated, one to be filled
out by the patient himself and one to
be filled out by an interviewer. Drs.
Neal A. Vanselow and James A. Mc-
Lean are conducting the interviews.
The questions have to do with par-
ticular symptoms experienced, combi-
nations of symptoms that always or
never occur together, time of their
occurrence, subjective ratings of se-
verity on a scale from one to ten, and
the like. Obviously a great deal of sub-
jectivity must still enter in, but when
hundreds of copies of each question-
naire have been filled out and the
answers have been punched on IBM
cards and processed by computer, the
generalities arrived at from such a
massive amount of data are expected
to be highly useful in formulating
standards by which allergists will be
able to "measure" individual cases.

better one
and call it
chemical

We understand as well as the next company the
difference between, let us say, a chemical equipment
design engineer and an electro-mechanical develop-
ment engineer. To turn out the volume we intend
of such a fantastically demanding cross-product of
chemical and mechanical engineering as a Kodapak
Cartridge of Kodachrome-X Film, we have to
interest fresh graduates answering to both these job
descriptions and many, many others.
In talking to shoppers from the campus, we find
it wise to be very specific about job descriptions.
We would create the wrong impression at the inter-
view by referring to the job available as "profes-
sional engineer."
The young man is winding up four or five years
of building himself into a good all-around engineer.
Now comes the time to get specific. He is smart
enough to know that the demand by strong
organizations for all-around engineers under 25 can
be expected to remain slack. He is right. The proj-
ects awaiting engineers are terribly specific. But if
he has picked the right employer, he will find that
with each project brought off well the walls between
the compartments of engineering get a little softer.
By the time he discovers he has been transformed
into that vague "professional engineer," he is hav-
ing too much fun fighting our competitors by the
boldness of his concepts to care what specialty he
promised to devote his career to.
On the chance that we might be the right
employer, drop us a line.

Should You Work for a Big Company?
An interview with General Electric's S. W. Corbin, Vice President and General
S. W. CORBIN
■ Wells Corbin heads what is probably
the world's largest industrial sales organi-
zation, employing more than 8000 persons
and selling hundreds of thousands of di-
verse products. He joined General Electric
in 1930 as a student engineer after gradu-
ation from Union College with a BSEE. After
moving through several assignments in in-
dustrial engineering and sales management,
he assumed his present position in 1960.
He was elected a General Electric vice
president in 1963.
Q. Mr. Corbin, why should I work for
a big company? Are there some
special advantages?
A. Just for a minute, consider what
the scope of product mix often found
in a big company means to you. A
broad range of products and services
gives you a variety of starting places
now. It widens tremendously your op-
portunity for growth. Engineers and
scientists at General Electric re-
search, design, manufacture and sell
thousands of products from micro-
miniature electronic components and
computer-controlled steel-mill sys-
tems for industry; to the world's
largest turbine-generators for utili-
ties; to radios, TV sets and appli-
ances for consumers; to satellites
and other complex systems for aero-
space and defense.
Q. How about attaining positions of
responsibility?
A. How much responsibility do you
want? If you'd like to contribute to
the design of tomorrow's atomic re-
actors—or work on the installation
of complex industrial systems—or
take part in supervising the manu-
facture of exotic machine-tool con-
trols—or design new hardware or
software for G-E computers—or direct
a million dollars in annual sales
through distributors—you can do it,
in a big company like General Elec-
tric, if you show you have the ability.
There's no limit to responsibility . . .
except your own talent and desire.
Q. Can big companies offer advan-
tages in training and career develop-
ment programs?
A. Yes. We employ large numbers of
people each year so we can often set
up specialized training programs
that are hard to duplicate elsewhere.
Our Technical Marketing Program,
for example, has specialized assign-
ments both for initial training and
career development that vary de-
pending on whether you want a
future in sales, application engineer-
ing or installation and service engi-
neering. In the Manufacturing Pro-
gram, assignments are given in manu-
facturing engineering, factory super-
vision, quality control, materials man-
Manager, Industrial Sales Division.
agement or plant engineering. Other
specialized programs exist, like the
Product Engineering Program for you
prospective creative design engineers,
and the highly selective Research
Training Program.
Q. Doesn't that mean there will be
more competition for the top jobs?
A. You'll always find competition
for a good job, no matter where
you go! But in a company like G.E.
where there are 150 product opera-
tions, with broad research and sales
organizations to back them up, you'll
have less chance for your ambition to
be stalemated. Why? Simply because
there are more top jobs to compete
for.
Q. How can a big company help me
fight technological obsolescence?
A. Wherever you are in General Elec-
tric, you'll be helping create a rapid
pace of product development to
serve highly competitive markets. As
a member of the G-E team, you'll
be on the leading edge of the wave
of advancement—by adapting new re-
search findings to product designs,
by keeping your customers informed
of new product developments that
can improve or even revolutionize
their operations, and by developing
new machines, processes and
methods to manufacture these new
products. And there will be class-
work too. There's too much to be
done to let you get out of date!

How to tell a career from a job
A job is a job. A career is a place to grow. A career has a future.
A job lives from day to day. In a job you get what you can, do
what you must. In a career, rewards parallel your contributions.
We're a career company. More than a third of our 90,000
employees have been with us at least 15 years; 10,000 for more
than 25 years. There are reasons for this. To assure growth we
invest over $90 million a year in research. Fifty percent of last
year's sales ($2.4 billion) came from products unheard of just
28 years ago. Because customers like these products, we've
grown 750% since 1937.
Our career men share in this growth because we fill virtually
all responsible positions from within. Our young men work in
several areas to develop their capabilities. This way they can
change positions without leaving the company.
There are job men and career men. If you seek a career, we'd
like to tell you about an interesting and rewarding one at

COUNSEL ON COUNSELLING
About this time during their freshman year, all engineer-
ing students are asked to decide which field of engineering
they would like to study. They have some foggy notions of
what an engineer in the various disciplines does. The college
catalogue tells them that the chemical engineer's functions are
"The examination, design, and operation of processes and
equipment that accomplish changes in chemical composition;"
that the mechanical engineer is concerned with "all aspects
of the mechanics of equipment and processes used in the rap-
idly developing technical era in which we live;" and that the
electrical engineer "is concerned with electrical energy and its
applications." But by and large, the average freshman engineer
—even the average sophomore, junior, and senior engineer-
has very little real understanding of just what a typical chemi-
cal, mechanical, or electrical engineer does. The well-tooled
phrases in college catalogues are meaningful only to those with
enough experience to see the particulars of a job as they are
inferred from the generalities. The students must have an
awareness of those particulars in order to competently make
a decision as to a field of study. Without this awareness the
freshman engineer—and again the sophomore, junior, and
senior engineer—finds himself readily subject to whimsy, hear-
say, and valid, but narrow opinion in making his choice of a
field of study.
8
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


student's career remains undisputed. The necessity for the
choice results from the highly advanced state of the technology.
The engineering student today must begin to direct his efforts
early in order to amass the wealth of knowledge required of
a competent engineer. But the price for making an early choice
is high. The price is the irretrievable loss of opportunity to
look before leaping, to reason before deciding.
One possibility for mitigation of the problem stands out
in many engineering students' minds: the innovation of a
completely new kind of counselling program. The ideal coun-
selling program would direct itself toward giving students a
better understanding of the particulars of the various fields
of engineering, especially in the early stages of an engineer's
education. At least one attempt in the right direction has been
made at the University, but it has generally failed. During
the freshman year, engineering students are asked to attend
several seminars given by outstanding professors in each of
the departments. The seminars are designed to make each of
the particular fields "really come alive" for the students. There
is an opportunity for students to ask pointed questions of the
faculty and receive supposedly frank answers. However, the
seminars usually reduce to discussions of grade point require-
ments, the desirability of summer work, the salaries of gradu-
ate engineers, and their security on the job, all climaxed with
a short rah-rah for the particular field in question. Again, the
student is left with little real understanding of the various
fields.
What students really need is an opportunity to observe
individual engineers at work. They need to listen to an indi-
vidual engineer's assignments and read his personal reports.
They need to follow the individual engineer's contribution to a
piece of research, and they need to understand the part an
individual engineer plays in producing a good for sale. The
final result of a research project, and the final product of a
manufacturing process are interesting, but they give the stu-
dent little idea of what he will be doing as an individual
practicing engineer.
A meaningful counselling system, then, would be designed
to give the student an awareness of engineering from the
viewpoint of the individual engineer. Co-operation from in-
dustry would be essential, of course. Companies would have
to re-organize their tours around the work of individuals. Log
books, assignment schedules, and reports would have to be
made available to students. A few engineers would have to
agree to be the objects of student observation for a few hours.
They wouldn't need to put on a show. In fact, they would
probably be most helpful if they went about their work
exactly as they would normally, answering a few questions
along the way.
Admittedly, a counselling program of this sort would be
a tremendous burden upon industry. On the other hand, if
industry could assure itself that only those individuals really
interested in engineering would be applying for work after
graduation, perhaps they could justify the burden. At any
rate, some steps in this direction must be taken, if only for
the well-being of the student. No young man of 19 years of
age should be asked to leap into his life's work on the basis
of what he knows as a freshman in college.

Piping. It is industry's "circulatory system" ... the con-
veyor of steam, oil, acids, the water you drink, everything
that flows.
Piping can be quite simple. Or enormously complex.
Corrosion, pressure, or temperature, for example, can
present engineering challenges of the first order.
That's why industry so often turns to Grinnell when
piping is involved.
Grinnell is piping . . . piping that ranges from systems
engineered for pure food processing, to power plant

Of course, every employer WANTS the cream of
the crop, but the point is: we can get them! Not
because of money or blue sky promises or "Extra"
benefits, but because the Naval Ordnance Laboratory
offers the best opportunity for vital engineering work
in a near academic environment. (Some graduate
degree courses are actually held here at NOL, and
this is prime ground for PhD theses, as you may
know.) Fact is, some 40% of those graduates we hired
last year were Tau Beta Pi members, so you can under-
stand our obvious pride. i
The Naval Ordnance Laboratory takes the lead in
the research, design, development, and test of all
kinds of weapons systems and devices . . . ranging
from the smallest arming circuit to a complete
underwater-to-air-to-underwater nuclear missile sys-
tem. (The SUBROC missile and its digital computer
fire control system were conceived and developed
at NOL.)
The NOL campus includes almost 200 buildings on
900 acres of suburban countryside just outside
Washington. The annual budget for in-house research
and development averages some $30 MILLION, and
our facilities are the finest in the world. But
hypersonic wind tunnels, pressurized ballistic ranges,

It's the pervading intellectual atmosphere . . . the
freedom to think and create . . . the encouragement
to better oneself that sets NOL apart. For instance,
we want engineers (and engineering-oriented phy-
sicists) who can create and push an idea from
original design straight through to prototype testing
in unfamiliar environments—including beneath the
sea. We want people who are interested in our
excellent advance-degree program, and in associat-

BRIDGES
Maillart was a bridge-building genius, yet the
public refused to approve his futuristic designs.
by Bernard Stollman
Salginatobel Bridge, 1929-30
This three hinged arch bridge leaps
across the valley below with an ex-
traordinary feeling of freedom and
strength. Only the solid side walls mar
its appearance.
By popular demand, the technic re-
prints this award-winning article from
its May, 1959 issue.
After weeks and months, or even
years, of struggling with a problem,
an engineer may finally make an im-
portant decision—to start with the
most basic fundamentals and aim for
the solution, disregarding all precon-
ceived notions. The result may well be
a completely new and astonishing
answer to the problem. Again and
again this has been the story of many
of our great leaders in science and
engineering.
Another Problem
As often is the case, however, this
may bring a problem that makes the
initial technical one look small in com-
parison. The new problem is that his
design or solution may be so advanced
for his clay that the reward for his de-
termination to create an original solu-
tion may be lack of commissions, the
censure of colleagues and a general
lack of sympathy on the part of the
public.
This was the fate of Robert Mail-
lart. An early twentieth century
bridge designer, Maillart is now
hailed by architects, as well as en-
gineers, as one of the very few real
"artists" to emerge from the engineer-
ing profession, but still he was (and
is) practically unknown even within
his own country, Switzerland. Indeed,
officials were so shocked with his de-
signs that they permitted him to con-
struct his bridges only in remote and
lonely alpine valleys. Thus they took
advantage of the phenomenal low cost
of his work while not disturbing their
own senses by having to look at his
radical designs.
Maillart was an artist—an engineer
in the real Leonardian sense. His
bridges are alive, bursting with the
exhilaration of freedom and strength.
Yet it was these same qualities which
completely bewildered the public
throughout his entire career. Though
communities might have wanted to
accept his designs because of their
amazing low cost, few wanted to risk
building anything as radical as the
Tavannes bridge. One spokesman de-
clared he "wanted none of those
powder-puff bridges." Unwittingly he
was reflecting both the success of Mail-
lart's designs and the public's own
inability to emerge from a 19th cen-
tury way of thinking.
We can best understand the funda-
mental aspects that gave Maillart's
bridges such qualities if we remember,
first of all, that while architectural de-
sign is dedicated to the molding of
interior space, bridges express them-
selves through structure and materials
alone. A bridge has no interior space
and thus it frees itself from many of
the psychological problems involved
in the creation of something so intan-
gible. Instead a bridge cuts through
space—its essence being in a controlled
movement between two points. This
continuity of movement requires an
abstractness, a quality of which most
bridge designers are unaware. Maillart
knew what continuity meant: even his
earliest work shows his attempt to
incorporate it in his bridges. It was a
concept which he applied with vigor
to every design he produced. Actually
it is this quality which surprises and
pleases most people who sec Maillart's
bridges for the first time.
Turning now from the generalities
let us examine in more detail the evo-
lution of Maillart's ideals and how he
applied them to bridge designs. Little

Schwandbach Bridge, 1933
A stiffened-arch bridge which combines maximum economy, continues the
existing roadway without interruption—with an extremely striking design.
information is available as to Mail-
lart's personal life and even this scant
amount is relatively unspectacular.
Suffice is to say that he was born in
1872 at Berne, Switzerland, received a
structural engineering degree, and
worked for several years with Francois
Hennibique, then the eminent de-
signer in concrete.
Hennebique was aware of the
strength inherent in concrete but he
was unable to take advantage of it.
Bridges like his Ourthe Bridge in Bel-
gium demonstrated that he was aware
of the way in which concrete lent itself
to smooth flowing structures. Yet it
was Maillart who was convinced that
reinforced concrete was a revolution-
ary new material, possessing charac-
teristics quite distinct from any ma-
terial in popular use at the time.
Aesthetic Values
Although a Frenchman named
Monier was the first to experiment
successfully with reinforced concrete
in slabs and arches, it was Maillart
who first realized that constructors
were ignoring the possibilities of
which concrete was capable. His con-
siderations were aesthetic as well as
structural. He wrote in 1938:
"Reinforced concrete does not grow
like wood, it is not rolled like steel
and has no joints as masonry. It is
most easily compared with cast-iron
as a material cast in forms, and per-
haps we can learn something directly
from the slowly discovered cast-con-
tinuity between the members that
seme different functions. The condi-
tion of this beautiful continuity is the
conception of the structure as a whole.
The automobile and aircraft con-
structors have attained this in the
highest degree, while it is an excep-
tion for the reinforced concrete con-
structors to perceive this. It is not only
the feeling for beauty which makes
desirable the conception of the whole
primary to that of the single elements.
Seeing the structure as a whole nearly
always brings economical advantage
as well. . . .
"The engineer should then free
himself from the forms dictated by the
tradition of the older building ma-
terials, so that in complete freedom
and by conceiving the problem as a
whole, it would be possible to use the
material to its ultimate. Perhaps then
we xuould also arrive at a new style as
in automobile and aircraft construc-
tion, as beautiful, and in the same way
determined by the nature of the ma-
terial."
Until Maillart's time the slab had
little or no structural use. Strength in
concrete was achieved through con-
crete beams, columns and piers. Yet,
Maillart found that proper reinforc-
ing enabled the slab to become an ac-
tive bearing surface, of sustaining
great amounts of stress.
The Tavannes bridge over the
Rhine, begun in 1905, was Maillart's
first attempt to put his newly forming
knowledge of his material to test. He
produced a bridge which alarmed
authorities to the extent that he was
unable to design another bridge for
seven years. The Tavannes bridge was
only the beginning of a life-long
struggle to build bridges which con-
formed to his ideals.
Engineering had begun to emerge
as a separate trade (distinct from
architecture in the 18th century).
While architecture went through
periods of classic revival, and gen-
erally refrained from doing anything
original, engineers were striving to
create new forms in their bridges.
Throughout most of the 19th century,
bridge builders did far more to seek
out new and exciting structures than
did even the most prominent archi-
tects. However, the end of the 19th
and the beginning of the 20th cen-
tury saw a curious reversal of posi-
tions. Starting with H. H. Richardson
and Louis Sullivan, architecture began
to recover from the classic revival.
Engineers, on the other hand, thought
that the problem of bridge design had
been solved permanently with the
perfection of the heavy masonry
bridge. Both the public and bridge de-
signers felt that, since mass was the
factor that enabled a bridge to sustain
loads, the reality of a bridge, the key
to its structure, lay in its mass. This
myth handicapped bridge designers
for nearly half a century.
Fhis was the situation when the
Tavannes bridge was constructed—a
"powder puff bridge"—the direct an-
tithesis of what the public wanted.
By restricting his bridges to remote
valleys and rivers, the authorities suc-
ceeded in eliminating his work from
view. But far from ruining the impact
of Maillart's work, these lonely val-
leys enhance them in a way the au-
thorities had never dreamed possible.
The Salginatobel bridge, for example,
leaps with amazing power and smooth-
ness across its chasm. Conceived as a
whole, it expresses itself as a whole;
in a word, it is natural, as natural as
the valley over which it hovers.
Two Types
In the main, Maillart's bridges are
either of the stiffened slab-arch type
or of the three hinged arch with inte-
grated road-slab. Of the slab arch type
the Val Tschiel is the earliest bridge
that can still be seen in its original
form. Constructively it is supported
by an arched rib stiffened by longi-
tudinal beams, between which are
solid supports in the form of cross
walls. The smooth flowing effect of the
structure is ruined by the massive end
walls and the rather distasteful orna-
mentation, both of which rather were
14

authorities.
The Schwandbach bridge is one of
Maillart's most imposing solutions.
Spanning a deep ravine, it swings
through an ellipse to enable the traffic-
way to continue uninterrupted. The
concept of a whole bridge as a whole
unit becomes a reality in this bridge—
a plastic creation of strength and
motion.
In the Wulflingen bridge, the subtle
reverse curve of the deck is typical of
Maillart's artistry. In the only mono-
graph on Maillart's life, Max Bill de-
describes this creation as having "the
ease and pleasant naturalness as if it
had grown there and had sought to
span the river itself."
In his three-hinged arch bridges
Maillart showed more obvious con-
scious development of a single kind
of solution. With the Tavanassa
Bridge he commenced experimenta-
tion with a shape that one critic de-
scribed as "two enormous skates
joined toe to toe." Reducing the arches
to box sections, he also carved out the
side to reduce the weight and at the
same time to give the bridge an amaz-
ing aesthetic character. The fact that
the bridge still looks "modern" to
viewers of photographs of it (it was
destroyed by a landslide in 1927) is
both a tribute to Maillart's creative
sense and evidence of the slowness
with which engineers have evolved
more lithe and plastic structures.
The box section was also employed
on the Salginatobel bridge but with
different results. The success of the
bridge may be attributed both to the
extraordinary setting and to the charm
of the arch itself. The design is marred,
however, by the solid walls which
were probably added by the author-
ities, not by Maillart.
The Rossgraben bridge carried the
solution one step further; the heavy
side walls were removed.
The Thur bridge uses two box sec-
tions, allowing the same shuttering
to be used twice. For the first time,
Maillart uses the pointed arch, re-
jecting the traditional one on con-
structive grounds. However, the solid
side walls again ruin the appearance
of the structure.
The Aarve bridge also employs two
box sections. The structure of the sup-
ports is striking; they have been re-
duced to the statically permitted mini-
mum and yet attain a kind of elegance
equaled perhaps only in the supports
of the Thur bridge.
Tavannes Bridge, 1905
Maillart's first attempt at an organic approach to bridge design. Unfortunately,
this plastic creation in concrete was destroyed in a landslide in 1927.
His Best Not Built
Amazingly, most of Maillart's supe-
rior designs were never constructed.
The most striking and very likely the
finest, both technically and artistically,
of these unbuilt bridges was one which
was to cross the Rhone River. Struc-
turally, it consisted of a continuous
girder with built-in slab and canti-
levered sidewalks. As one critic points
out, "it does no credit to the authori-
ties and their advisors that this bridge
was never built; however, the project
is valid for all time as an unexecuted
masterpiece in the art of concrete con-
struction."
Maillart deplored the idea of the
"calculator." He felt that a construc-
tor should continually experiment,
constantly alter and improve his work.
Maillart dictated changes in construc-
tion on the spot, adjusting his struc-
ture to the existing conditions of
terrain and materials. It is no co-
incidence that the architect Frank
Lloyd Wright also constructed his
buildings in this manner, changing
the design again and again as the
structure was erected. The work of
both Wright and Maillart is organic,
each one has a sense of what his ma-
terials are capable of. Both have pro-
duced structures which are unique
in their plastic qualities and at the
same time are charged with freshness
and strength.
Since Maillart's death in 1940 there
has been a great reevaluation of his
work. Max Bill predicts eventual
pilgrimages of people from all over
the world to see his work. He expects
the "discovery" of Maillart to parallel
the discovery of other abstract painters
who have remained relatively un-
known.
What Next?
Any reevaluation of Maillart's work
leads inevitably to the question "what
is the next step?" Does the reinforced
concrete bridge end with Maillart? If
Maillart had lived another 20 years
what improvements would he have
made in this type of construction?
Some critics retort that the Aarve or
Thur bridge was the culmination of
reinforced concrete design. Little im-
provement could be made either in its
aesthetic or economic properties.
Other critics have disagreed. Bridge
design must inevitably invade the
realm of architecture. It must retain
its own purity of expression while
attempting to conquer interior space.
Designs for bridges have been sub-
mitted where the plasticity of the ma-
terial is utilized to form an interior
so that the traffic flows through the
structure.
In any case, we see now that Robert
Maillart was a rare man. In an age
when the engineer is credited only for
the magnitude of his performance—
"the longest pipeline," "the highest
skyscraper," Maillart's achievement is
even more noteworthy. The ability to
merge technical as well as artistic
ability seems to grow rarer. Maillart's
example must serve to convince not
only the public but also practicing en-
gineers that creative expression is not
the function of the painter and sculp-
tor alone.

INNER-SPACE" ENGINEERING
by Omer G. Voss, Sr.
This is the first printing of a speech
made by Mr. O. G. Voss, Vice Presi-
dent of International Harvestor Co.,
in charge of the Farm Equipment Di-
vision. The speech was first presented
to the Society of Agricultural En-
gineers in Milwaukee, Wis. Recently
the Chairman of the Federal Com-
mission on Agriculture requested that
the speech be printed in the Commis-
sion's publication.
Though specific references are made
to agricultural and construction equip-
ment engineering, Mr. Voss directs the
speech to engineers of all fields, both
new graduates and old. He brings to
light many startling facts which have
often been ignored, and gives real
meaning and direction to the en-
gineering profession.
This may well be the unlikeliest of
all occasions to begin a speech with
the phrase: "Once upon a time there
was a king-." I am sure the engineering
profession today has little time for
fairy tales. Yours is the real world, the
world of facts and proof, of detailed
specifications and precise measure-
ments. Yours is the most practical of
worlds because you are charged with
the everlasting responsibility of find-
ing application for scientific knowl-
edge so that it can serve a useful hu-
man purpose.
But I am also reminded that seren-
dipity—a term meaning the gift of
finding valuable or agreeable things
not sought for—belongs as much to en-
gineers as it does to folk singers.
Though you may neither seek nor ex-
pect it in a discourse that begins as I
am about to begin this one, I hope
you will find something of value—and
even, perhaps, something agreeable.
Once upon a time there was a king.
He had three exceptionally faithful
and industrious servants whom he
wanted to reward in some unusual
manner. So he called them in one
morning and told each one that he
could have as much of the kingdom
as he could walk or run around before
sunset. "Everything in the area your
steps circumscribe will become your
property," he said.
Young and vigorous men, two of the
servants set out immediately, at a dead
run, in different directions from the
palace. The third servant, somewhat
older than the others, sat at the gate
and watched them go. Perhaps their
pace seemed a bit too much for him.
Finally he rose and walked away in
still another direction.
Meanwhile, back at the palace, the
day wore on. Sunset came, and the
king went out to greet his servants
and to learn how much of the king-
dom they had been able to cane out
for themselves. Neither of the young
men showed up at all. Both had cov-
ered many miles but had dropped in
exhaustion long before they were able
to skirt the great tracts they had
hoped to win.
Assuming his other servant must
also have dropped from the race, the
king turned to re-enter the palace.
There in the shadows by the gate sat
the third man—just as he had been
sitting when the other two set out.
The king asked him how much land
he had been able to walk around in
the course of the day.
"Well," the servant said, "I decided
right away I wouldn't be able to keep
up with those two. So I just walked
around the palace here."
Perhaps some of you are familiar
with the current advertisements aimed
at attracting young engineering grad-
uates to employment. If you are, I
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


sound just a little like the king in this
parable as he challenged his servants
to dash off to the horizon if they would
gain a slice of the kingdom. Here are
just a few lines from some of those
ads:
". . . to today's graduates in Engi-
neering, Mathematics and related
sciences, there's room at the top in
the vital race for space . . ."
". . . In just 32 weeks you can be-
come an important member in one
of the aerospace industry's leading
developers of inertial guidance and
navigation systems . . ."
". . . here, you work with men who
have, themselves, sired daring new
concepts in electronics . . ."
". . . college graduates will find ex-
citing and challenging programs in
the development of germanium and
silicon devices, ferrites, solid state
diffusion . . ."
"... the 'moon bug' and many other
advanced projects require scientists
and engineers with the highest
qualifications . . ."
Of course, even if I could, it would
not be my intention to deprecate the
tremendous efforts and achievements
of the fine firms responsible for these
ads. On the contrary, I must confess I
often envy them. They are situated on
the obvious frontiers of science. They
are tied in closely with our national
prestige. They carry with them an im-
[x&gt;rtant part of our aspiration for con-
tinued U.S. leadership in the world.
These are telling arguments in the
perennial competition for the cream
of the engineering crop. I can under-
stand why any young engineer would
be strongly attracted to a career in
such fields as atomic energy, aerospace
or electronics.
Or—to return to the parable—I
think it was perfectly natural for the
two servants to take off for parts un-
known and far away in their desire to
annex some royal acreage. But at the
end, the story twists to a point only
because it was just as natural for the
third servant to recognize the value of
the property the other two had dis-
regarded. And by then, it almost
comes as a surprise that, after all, the
palace was the control center of the
entire kingdom.
I am concerned that the rapid pace
of our technology today lures us into
the re-enactment of this parable.
There are engineering outposts this
side of outer space. And there is
drama, excitement, responsibility and
the realization of significant achieve-
ment for those who are willing to stay
right here on earth and man them.
But I am even more concerned that
those of us who already occupy these
outposts are inclined to take them too
much for granted. We hold the third
servant's position but lack his percep-
tion.
1 am going to be talking about engi-
neering in the farm equipment indus-
try today because it's a subject I know
something about and because, among
the "passed-over palaces" of this world,
it appears to be a rather good ex-
ample. I think much of what I have to
say—the basic principles, at least—may
be applied to engineering in the con-
struction industry as well. But as the
backswoods doctor said as he spooned
medicine into a patient, "If you don't
have what this is for, it won't hurt
you."
Few professions can match farm
equipment engineering's continuity of
success and record of achievement for
the general well-being of this nation
and the world. And yet there is some
irony in the impact this seems to have
had on many people.
Back in the '20's, for example, when
farm equipment engineers had laid
the firm foundations of power farming
by introducing the general-purpose,
row-crop tractor, this recorded com-
ment revealed a currently popular at-
titude toward the profession:
"Mechanically-minded young men
of our generation—whether from
farm, factory or technical school-
have been attracted by automobile
engineering, with its more glittering
rewards and its better defined sci-
ence, more than by farm implement
engineering. .."
Then move ahead a bit to 1948,
when it should have been fresh in ev-
eryone's mind that U. S. farm produc-
tion, increased by mechanization, had
been a vital factor in the outcome of
World War II. A leading national
magazine that year took occasion to
observe that most engineers were go-
ing into other industrial fields which,
it said, "offered far greater promise."
Farm equipment engineering, accord-
ing to the magazine, was handled for
the most part by "graduate black-
smiths." While it admitted some of
the larger companies had recently
taken on some young engineering tal-
ent, the magazine suggested that no
company in the industry was really
"overburdened" with it.
So we come on along to 1964. Tech-
nological momentum has reached
heights no one dreamed of ten or fif-
teen years ago. It's almost impossible
to write science-fiction because most
of the potential subject matter is now
fact. And we seem to find all the spot-
lights of popular interest and acclaim
turned in a new direction. Going back
to the ads for engineering manpower,
this passage of copy seems to sum it all
UP:
". . . the engineer or scientist with
an acute historical awareness iden-
tifies himself with the technological
triumphs of his day. The initial
steps in space flight are certainly
the successes that will be closely re-
lated to this decade. For these are
the times that bridge the gap be-
tween theory and reality. (We of-
fer) the engineer participation in
the most exciting projects of our
times. . ."
Again, I will not deny there is truth
in this point of view. But I do take
issue with the sort of tunnel vision
that assigns the be-all and end-all of
every engineer's existence to aerospace,
electronics, atomic energy and the like.
"Historical awareness" may indeed
lead an engineer to identify himself
with triumphs in aerospace. But might
the same awareness not also be suffi-
cient to suggest that none of the
bright, new industries now stirring
the popular imagination would even
exist had the gap between theory and
reality not already been bridged many
times over in agriculture? At least 85
percent of our population might still
be farmers had it not been for the
truly amazing accomplishments of
farm equipment engineers over the
past 130 years. If we are looking for
technological triumphs, we certainly
have several here.
And speaking of "successes closely
related to this decade," consider this
one:
Ten years ago, a farm population of
20 million was supplying a total
population of 160 million in the
U.S. Today, the farm population is
about 13i/2 million, total popuat-
tion is over 191 million, and the
food supply is more varied and
abundant than ever before.
Here's another:
Since 1950, U.S. cropland has de-
clined by 21 million acres and is
now at its lowest point since 1910.
On an acreage no larger than was
needed 50 years ago to feed a U.S.
population of 92 million, we are
now feeding 191 million—as well as

If these aren't successes vitally re-
lated to this decade, I don't know the
meaning of the term. And while many
other factors have contributed to
them, none has contributed more than
the farm equipment engineering pro-
fession.
Even more important, however, is
the absolute certainty that farm equip-
ment engineers in the future will be
constantly called upon for greater and
greater heights of achievement. If
there were no other reason, popula-
tion trends would be more than suffi-
cient to assure it. Today we are talk-
ing about a population that has
more than doubled in 50 years. But if
current projections are correct, it's go-
ing to take less than 40 years to double
it again.
Most of that growth, we can be sure,
is going to be urban—or suburban or
ex-urban. This can only mean two
things. Farm population as a percent
of total population will continue to
decline, and even more of our farm
land will be diverted to urban use.
I think it's probably true that, even
among people who are aware of the
past accomplishments of engineers in
our industry, there is a feeling that
their ultimate goal has been reached.
Current surpluses of some farm prod-
ucts lead to the conclusion that all the
excitement and inspiration of chal-
lenge must have vanished from the en-
gineer's life. Hut to reach such a con-
clusion is to ignore the fundamental
facts of life in our society.
I would be the first to agree that our
efforts in space stimulate imagination
and the pioneering instinct. And I
have no scorn for the prediction that
before the year 2000 we'll have a few
people on the moon. But it's still a
lead-pipe cinch most of them will be
right here on earth—only there will
be almost twice as many in this coun-
try, alone, as there are now. And appe-
tites will be just as big as ever.
If this doesn't constitute a first mag-
nitude challenge for farm equipment
engineers, if this doesn't place the pro-
fession in a frontier outpost of our
technology, again, I don't know the
meaning of "challenge."
And, of course, we haven't even
mentioned the world at large where
the rate of population growth will be
even greater and the need for farm
production even more acute. We've
also completely ignored the fact that
successes in U.S. agriculture must con-
tinue to stand, in the eyes of the world,
among the brightest examples of the
efficacy of free enterprise. If there's
one thing Soviet Russia would rather
do now than anything else, it would
be to out-harvest us.
Well, the new industries, like elec-
tronics and aerospace, have also cap-
tured popular attention because they
have come into view so recently and
have vaulted into prominence in the
economy so rapidly. They seem to
stand for all the dynamism, all the
change, all the forward thrust which
characterize our time.
On the other hand, a predominantly
urban society is disposed to de-empha-
size agriculture, by comparison, to
relegate it to a position of lesser im-
portance, off the mainline of current
affairs. As one magazine writer re-
cently observed, "Agriculture has come
to be regartled as only a minor part
of an economy grown vast and varied."
Again, the facts support a com-
pletely opposite point of view. For in
an age of gigantic investment and
feverish effort to transistorize the
earth and colonize the remoter
planets, agriculture continues to be,
by all odds, our largest industry and,
by far, the most important to our
economy and general welfare.
Here are some of the significant
specifications of agriculture today:
. . . Farmers take in more than $35
billion annually from the sale of
their products. In capital equip-
ment, farmers invest about $4.5
billion a year—more than any other
one industry.
. . . Agriculture's 6.8 million work-
ers exceed the combined employ-
ment in transportation, public
utilities and the steel and automo-
bile industries. Add the 6 million
workers who supply the tools and
materials of farm production to the
10 million who transport, process,
manufacture, and sell farm prod-
ucts, and it's clear agriculture ac-
counts for 40 percent of all the
jobs in the United States.
. . . The assets of agriculture are
equal to two-thirds of the market
value of all corporation stocks on
the New York Stock Exchange. And
only highly automated industries,
like petroleum and chemicals, can
claim a larger investment per
worker than agriculture's $24,000.
. . . Agriculture's output per man-
hour has been increasing at an
average annual rate of 5.1 percent
compared with 2.2 percent in non-
farm industry.
. . . Farmers use in one year enough
steel to make 5 million compact
cars, enough rubber for the tires
on (i million cars, enough electricity
to power the six New England
states, and the equivalent of 15 bil-
lion gallons of crude oil, more than
any other single single industry.
These are only a few dimensions of
an industry that is so commonly
passed over and discounted as a minor
force in our economy. And it did not
grow to such proportions through
stagnation and backwardness but by
virtue of a pace of change and prog-
ress without rival in our time.
Sharply declining numbers of farms
and farmers, paired with increasing
farm size, is a popular and meaning-
ful way to describe the changing face
of agriculture. But, of course, the
change goes much deeper. I was inter-
ested the other day to read, in an ad-
vertising trade publication, a phrase
designed to express the new image of
those farmers now operating the
"good, commercial, family-managed
farms" of today. In the hyphen-stud-
ded parlance of Madison Avenue,
these fanners are "profit-motivated,
science-guided, risk-conditioned, self-
directed, and management-oriented."
In a statistical portrait of such a
farmer you'd find:
... he spends $7,500 a year for his
business needs compared with
$1,000 in 1940.
... he sells $10,000 worth of farm
products a year compared with
$1,500 worth in 1940.
. . . his farm plant is valued at
nearly $50,000 compared with $6,-
200 in 1940.
... he farms 325 acres compared
with 217 in 1940.
The outflow of manpower from
agriculture has been more than
matched by a massive input of sci-
ence and economics. Today's farmer
combines sound business practices in-
stead of intuition with science instead
of art. He applies chemicals because
he knows their benefits. But he is also
concerned about the kind of chemi-
cals, the form they are in, the exact
quantity a given plant will need, and
the exact location and depth they
should be applied.
He is acutely cost-conscious, meas-
ures savings in cents and seconds be-
cause he knows their cumulative ef-

help Bell System engineers
provide important communications services
As an engineer your future could be important to us.
You might be able to contribute to our continuing
leadership in the communications field. Therefore, you
should know something about us and how we operate.
Bell System engineers deal with modern problems
in modern ways. They have at their command the
latest in technology and equipment.
An example is how computer programs aid in
providing telephone service for new communities.
Engineers at Bell Telephone Laboratories have
devised computer programs broad enough in scope
so that Bell System operating telephone companies
can use them to engineer the required wide variety
of telephone plant networks.
As part of a continuing effort, programs have been
designed to analyze communications needs of an
area for determining the best plant network layout
and switching office location.
In general, the necessary data are collected and the
engineer selects a number of alternative plans to be
analyzed in detail by a computer. His final decision is
based primarily on an analysis of the computer output.
The computer supplies more significant data, and
supplies it much faster, than laborious, manual cal-
culation methods. The engineer is thus relieved of
dull, time-consuming computation, and he plans facili-
ties with increased confidence—knowing that he is
providing efficient and economical communications,
tailored for a given area.
You may well find a rewarding career in the Bell
System, where people find solutions to exciting
problems. The Bell System companies are equal
opportunity employers. Arrange for an on-campus
interview through your Placement Office, or talk to
a local Bell System company.

of research in the realm of internal
ballistics were generally accessible to
all who possessed a valid "need to
know." With the advent of World
War II, however, the major portion of
all research done in this area was sub-
ject to the most rigorous forms of
censorship, both in the interest of na-
tional security and as a consequence
of manufacturers' reluctance to pub-
lish figures which could not be effec-
public dissemination.
Basically, the behavior of a projec-
tile, while it is being accelerated in
the barrel of a rifle or cannon, involves
a number of interrelationships be-
tween potential and kinetic energy act-
ing within the firing chamber of the
weapon. These include 1) the energy
released in the combustion of the pro-
pellent, 2) the mechanical energy of
the projectile, 3) the thermal energy
of the gases and 4) the energy dissi-

tively corroborated in the laboratory.
At that time measuring devices were
so limited that no meaningful corrob-
oration could be produced.
Until only recently, the inability
to measure the factors which influence
the motion of a projectile within the
confines of a gun barrel proved to be
a severe handicap. Gun manufacturers
had difficulty in determining proper
structural specifications for their prod-
uct, and powder companies were un-
able to determine accurately the na-
ture of the net explosive effect of
combustible materials used in the
manufacture of munitions. But today,
as a result of the marked success of a
technique developed collectively by
The University of Michigan and the
I. E. DuPont De Nemours Corpora-
tion, under the provisions of a grant
sponsored by the latter, it is possible
to obtain much-sought data to a high
degree of precision. As evidence of
their faith in the data obtained, the
DuPont Corporation has agreed to
make all information available for
pated by friction and direct heat loss.
Measurement of these energy factors,
by observation of their effect upon
weapon performance, is difficult be-
cause of the brevity of time in which
the projectile is accelerated within the
barrel. In a modern, high-velocity
small arm, for example, the projectile
is accelerated from an initial velocity
of zero to a muzzle velocity of approxi-
mately 1000 ft./sec. in an interval of
only 1/1000 of a second!
Formerly, chamber pressures were
estimated by measuring the compres-
sion of a copper "crusher" cylinder
due to the pressure developed within
the firing chamber of the weapon. In
this method, measurements were re-
stricted to a specially constructed test
barrel, and only approximate values
for maximum chamber pressure could
be obtained. Other devices designed
to measure projectile acceleration and
velocity within the confines of gun
bores had also been developed. One
involved the use of detector wires
placed in the gun bore to indicate

measured the electromagnetic waves
reflected from the projectile out of
the muzzle, and provided data regard-
ing bullet travel versus time.
As advanced as these methods may
appear, they do have one major short-
coming: none of them are capable of
simultaneously collecting data on
chamber pressure and projectile posi-
tion as functions of time. The new
method now being developed at The
iUGH
University of Michigan permits such
measurements. They are made by a
device which employs gamma radi-
ation, a maze of electrical circuitry,
and a camera, to record simulta-
neously both chamber pressure and
bullet travel as functions of time.
Basically, the device consists of the
following equipment: five radiation
collimating cylinders, a mount for the
weapon, five Iridium-192 gamma ra-
diation sources, five radiation detec-
tors and accompanying electrical net-
work, two strain guages and the strain
guage circuits, an oscilloscope, and a
camera.
The collimating cylinders consist of
cylindrical aluminum shells filled with
lead shot. Each contains an Iridium-
192 radiation source, along with a ra-
diation detector. As illustrated in fig.
I, the radiation source is located at
the bottom of the collimating cylinder.
The cylinder is pierced along its ver-
tical axis by a hole which permits a
beam of gamma radiation from the
iridium source to pass across the bore
of the cylinder. As can be seen from
the illustration, a source guide in-
sures that the major portion of the
gamma radiation emmitted will focus
upon the radiation detector on the
opposite side of the collimating cylin-
der. Through another hole—this one
piercing the cylinder along its hori-
zontal axis—the barrel of the weapon
to be tested is inserted. Thus, in order
for a bullet to pass through the barrel
of the test weapon, it must pass be-
tween the iridium source and the ra-
diation detector, thereby interrupting
the radiation beam.
The testing of a weapon is con-
ducted in the following manner. A
bullet is placed in the cartridge case
so that it interrupts or attenuates the
beam of gamma radiation which
pierces the collimating cylinder along
its vertical axis. Upon firing, pres-
sure resulting from the expansion of
gases behind the bullet force it down
the barrel of the weapon. When the
projectile has traversed a distance of
approximately one quarter of an inch,
it no longer interrupts the beam of
gamma radiation in the first collima-
tor. Thus, the beam is permitted to
strike the radiation detector, pro-
ducing a change in a voltage signal
being fed to an oscilloscope. The ra-
diation detector itself consists of a
scintillation counter working in con-
junction with a photomultiplier tube,
which is connected to a preamplifier
situated on top of the collimator. The
output of the photomultiplier is chan-
neled into an integrating circuit and
then to an oscilloscope. The oscillo-
scope is capable of displaying four
voltage traces simultaneously; thus,
the signals originating from the colli-
mators, as well as those from the two
strain guages can be observed at once.
As the bullet proceeds down the
barrel, it intersects and attenuates in
turn the radiation beams of the other
collimating cylinders. These attenu-
ations are monitored on the oscillo-
scope as discussed above. Since the
time between attenuations may be ob-
tained from the time scale on the os-
cilloscope, and the distances between
the radiation beams are known, it is
possible to formulate a plot of pro-
jectile displacement as a function of
time.
Along with the distance vs. time
curve, it is possible to obtain simul-
taneously a plot of the change in
chamber pressure, also taken as a func-
tion of time. When the weapon is
fired, the pressure rise in its firing
chamber produces a strain on the bar-
rel surface which is manifested as a
voltage change in the strain guage
circuit. The voltage produced is di-
rectly proportional to the pressure in
the chamber and is registered along
with the other information on the os-
cilloscope.
The possible applications of this
measuring technique are numerous.
The method is particularly attractive
from an economic standpoint: the cost
of constructing the test apparatus is
comparable to that of constructing
many of the less suitable devices now
in use. The radioisotope, iridium-192,
is easily obtained from either com-
mercial suppliers or the U.S. Atomic
Energy Commission at moderate cost.
The increased accuracy of measure-
ments obtained, plus the unprece-
dented ability of this apparatus to
provide simultaneous recording of
both chamber pressure and projectile
velocity will be of great interest to all
whose vocation or avocation centers
around guns or munitions. Thus, this
breakthrough will be of significance
to the amateur hand-loader as well as
to the military. The development of
this technique will have great physical
import as well. The simultaneous pro-
curement of information on both pro-
jectile displacement and chamber pres-
sure as functions of time will allow
correlation of the energy expended in

the firing of a projectile in accordance
with the first law of thermodynamics.
Perhaps the greatest significance of
this ballistic breakthrough lies not in
the technological benefits to be de-
rived, numerous as their number
might be. The significance lies in the
fact that a major industrial concern,
working side-by-side with an eminent
institution of higher learning, has
agreed to make all experimental data
available to the public. The unre-
stricted dissemination of information
of this sort is indicative of a growing
spirit of cooperation between industry
and institutions of higher education,

FROM ROOM
by Neil Amalfitano
The Engineering College maintains
an extensive placement service to en-
sure that its students and alumni may
take full advantage of the many and
diversified opportunities available to
engineers. The Engineering Place-
ment Service, directed by Professor
John G. Young, schedules over 700 in-
terviews, comprising firms from every
corner of the nation and of the globe.
Each year, in addition to expediting
position interviews, the Placement
Service processes mounds of job-re-
lated information to enable students
to keep abreast of engineering op-
portunities and trends. The "Annual
Report of Engineering Placement," or-
ganized by Professor Young, repre-
sents a single, but highly pertinent as-
pect of this service. Each year it is the
Technics privilege to present a synop-
sis, showing current opportunities and
trends in engineering placement over
the past year (July, 1963-June, 1964).
General Trends
Again, economic opportunity for en-
gineering graduates is at an all time
high. Also encouraging is the reversal
of last years 6% decrease in total
graduates. This year's 3% overall in-
crease includes a 27% increase in the
number of PhD's granted.
The decreased demand in the de-
fense and space industry was evident
again this year. This trend, which be-
gan last year, has been offset by an in-
creased demand from commercial in-
dustry. However, in spite of the
volume of government contract re-
duction, the actual decrease in de-
fense company campus visits was
slight. Possibly, this indicates a con-
tinuing demand for research and de-
velopment people in this area.
Interestingly enough, the shift in
employer demand has been accom-
panied by a shift in job acceptance
locations. The Golden West continues
to be slighted this year in favor of
the East and Middle West. Two years
ago the West represented 40% of the
job acceptance locations as compared
to 22% this year. This might possibly
reflect a decrease in opportunities
available on the West Coast, and/or
a growing preference for greater job
stability than many defense positions
offer.
Interviews and Offers
Company visits decreased slightly
(2%) from last year as 609 visits were
completed this year. However, the 889
students and alumni who interviewed
this year averaged 10.9 interviews per
person. The overall result was an 18%
increase in the number of interviews
for all purposes, to a total of 8611.
Post-graduate plans of many inter-
viewing students are disclosed in
chart I. Alumni continued to take
advantage of the placement service,
comprising almost one-fifth of the
total number interviewing. The total
alumni figure rose from 159 to 169
this year.
The average number of oilers ex-
tended per persons interviewing re-
mained constant at 4.6. Thus, no im-
mediate trends can be cited regarding
the decreasing number of campus
visits versus the increasing number of
interviews. A breakdown, by industry,
is given in chart II. Chemicals led the
recruiting effort, followed closely by
the automotive and aircraft industries.
It is interesting to compare these
totals to those compiled in charts III
and IV, which give starting salaries
ami positions accepted respectively.
Large companies (over 5000 em-
ployees) accounted for 67% of the
visits scheduled, while medium sized
(500-5000 employees) and small com-
panies (less than 500 employees) ac-
counted for 27% and 6% respectively.
Salaries
Starting salaries continued to rise
in a leap frog fashion, jumping over
last year's base at all degree levels:
4.7% for BS, 6.8% for MS, 5.4%, for
PhD. Thus the engineering profes-
sion continues to gain on the cost o(
living. Aeronauticals continue to draw
the highest starting salary, while elec-
tricals, mechanicals, and chemicals
represent close "seconds." Chart III
reveals starting salaries by field and
also by industry. Aircraft and space
vehicles remains one of the top dollar
industries.
Job Acceptances
Statistics were compiled from the
reports of 238 of the citizens who
accepted regular employment. Chan

IV segregates the statistics by industry,
location, type of work, and size of
organization. Again, aircraft and space
vehicles and related components is at
the top of the ladder. This belies any
drastic decline in the demand or the
attractiveness of this field.
The location outlook indicates a
subtle trend, although the full rami-
fications probably won't be clear for
at least another year. Statistics over the
last two years point towards a trend
away from the West, however. Those
who are interested in the West and
West Coast areas would do well to
consider all aspects of this trend with
regards to their own fields and career
goals.
In conclusion, it appears that the
engineering profession will provide an
excellent livelihood. Areas of demand
will probably change, gradually over
the next several years, a change which
may reflect in locational opportun-
ities. The most certain conclusion
which can be derived from this report
is, that despite fewer company visits,
student and alumni are taking better
advantage of the Engineering Place-
ment Service by taking time to inter-
view more companies. The placement
service can also be a valuable aid to
finding highly desirable summer em-
ployment. Last year several profitable
summer positions went unfilled.

feet on high-volume production. He
views his equipment the way a manu-
facturer looks at machine tools—as
capital investments that will bring
greater profits because they will get
the job clone faster and better. It
makes him nervous to have them idle,
and he won't tolerate downtime when
they should be working.
He wants more power, but he has
an even greater concern about con-
trolling it. And he'll have nothing to
do with either one unless they are
completely reliable. He also knows
that reliability, today, is scientifically
measurable and predictable and not
just an advertising claim.
Such are the farmers who many
people apparently still believe are
served by equipment engineers in
black, sateen sleeve protectors, green
eye-shades, and high button shoes.
Such is the new agriculture that sup-
posedly has its machinery designed by
blacksmiths who work in back alley
shops and whose only method is cut
and try.
The real truth of the matter is that
the pace of technological advance-
ment is as fast in the farm equip
ment industry as it is anywhere else
you may care to look. And for the en-
gineer, the approach is as sophisti-
cated, the stakes are as high, the
drama is as great and the excitement
is as intense. But—just maybe—he is
likely not to realize it as anyone else.
The misconception that farm
equipment engineering is backward
and out-of-date actually stems from a
concept of technology that has, itself,
become backward and out-of-date.
There was a time when engineering
developments—in any field—were in-
clined to crawl before they could walk.
The internal combustion engine is a
good example. First, it offered sta-
tionary power, then it began to move
ground vehicles, and eventually it
flew. But approximately 30 years
separated Otto's early engine work
from the accomplishments of the
Wright brothers. And ground appli-
cations were well-advanced before
(light became anything but an occu-
pation for daredevils.
But the speed of progress today
has completely upset this old, tra-
ditional order of events. First applica-
tions of new knowledge are likely to
be the most exotic ones. More often
than not they carry a high govern-
ment priority, are financed by pub-
lic funds, and are aimed at the so-
called "impossible," highly specialized
jobs.
We used the principle of atomic
fission to make a bomb long before
we applied it to the generation of
electricity. The electronic computer
figured anti-aircraft shell trajectories
years before it turned out a payroll.
Numerically-controlled machine tools
were handling complex, low-volume
contour machining jobs a decade be-
fore we applied them to regular pro-
duction on a diesel engine block line.
And incidentally, when one of my
Company's plants did just that last
year, it was hailed as a "giant step
forward" and a "breakthrough" by
the metalworking trade press.
What I'm saying is this: we're now
living in an age when the loudest
bang, the greatest speed, the most in-
tense heat, the highest flight, and the
solution to the most exotic problem
no longer signal the ultimate in ap-
plication of new ideas and new
knowledge. We can no longer look
where we have always looked for the
engineering frontiers. We've already-
achieved supersonic speeds with the
jet engine. But the gas turbine still
eludes us as a hardworking, com-
mercially-available power plant for
land vehicles. The new challenge in
this area is right here on earth, and
farm equipment engineers face it,
along with others in the construction
equipment and automotive industries.
Few people today have any concept
of the caliber of engineering and de-
velopment that is required to meet
the needs of the new farmer and the
new agriculture now emerging on the
American scene. And I will confess
that, close as I am to our engineers,
I am constantly amazed and awed at
the things I read and hear and see
of their activities. Listen for a minute
—with layman's ears, if you can—to
this brief passage from an engineering
paper:
"Utilizing the data sheets of the
coordinates obtained in the labora-
tory, the computer, after being
properly programmed, quickly es-
tablished the resulting values of
magnitudes of the acceleration and
velocity of point 'P' moving over
curves 'A, B, and C .. ."
That's a farm equipment engineer
at Hinsdale, Illinois, talking, not a
Cape Kennedy scientist. And he's dis-
cussing the use of an electronic com-
puter in designing the complex warp
of a plow's moltlboard.
The point, of course, is that in their
constant quest for optimum farm
equipment design, engineers have de-
fined an almost limitless number of
critical variables. But they could not
possibly have done so, nor could they
even begin to make a selection of the
best combinations of variables, with-
out the constant aid of a highly
sophisticated device like the computer.
Every schoolboy today eagerly de-
vours the news of rocket flights and
marvels at the detailed operational
information fed back to scientists via
a space age system called telemetry.
But what schoolboy, or how many
parents of schoolboys, ever heard of
the array of transducers, amplifiers,
discriminators, analyzers and digital
recorders farm equipment engineers
use every clay to turn up a maze of
vital information about the innermost
pressures, stresses, temperatures, vi-
brations, motion patterns, and other
phenomena which occur during the
operation of a tractor or a combine?
This, too, is telemetry. And it's no less
important and no less dramatic when
applied to the cause of food anci fiber
production.
Initial momentum in the whole
field of electronics has been built up
in the new industries which have
emerged in recent years. But I would
suggest the application outposts are
now in the older industries, like farm
equipment, where demand is increas-
ing for evermore responsive, ever-
more flexible, evermore remote sys-
tems for controlling, guiding, and
monitoring the operation of equip-
ment.
Likewise, the new industries have
gained a completely justifiable repu-
tation for research and development
in the area of materials, while farm
equipment. I am sure, still bears its
traditional "iron and steel" label. Un-
fortunately, not enough people know
that while we still use a very large
amount of both materials, farm equip
ment engineers have played a major
role in improving their properties
and matching them evermore pre-
cisely to application and environment.
Seeking low maintenance, less cor-
rosion and wear, more durability, and
increased strength and toughness, en-
gineers now have more than 10.000
different steels from which to choose.
And incidentally, the search has

EDUCATION
AND
RESEARCH
by Paul Niffenegger
Reactors for Space
The problem-plagued program to
develop a nuclear reactor as an auxil-
iary power source for space vehicles
got an encouraging note in a paper
delivered by Prof. Richard E. Balz-
hiser (of The University of Michigan
Department of Chemical and Metal-
lurgical Engineering) to the Ameri-
can Society of Chemical Engineers'
Meeting in Houston.
Balzhiser reported a U-M study
showed that original estimates of the
energy needed to pump vaporizing
licpiid metal coolants through nuclear
systems were too large. This means
that more of the electrical energy pro-
duced by the system can be used for
its original productive purpose—to
power the instruments aboard space
vehicles—instead of being consumed
by the power plant itself.
Liquid metals have been proposed
as suitable fluids to use in place of
water for cooling nuclear reactors in
space because of their ability to op-
erate at high temperatures (above
100()°F) with system pressures below
one atmosphere. ("One atmosphere''
is the average air pressure of the
earth's atmosphere at sea level, or
about 14.7 lbs. per square inch.)
The boiling and circulating char-
acteristics of liquid metals, such as
potassium and sodium, were unknown
until recently: and the study by The
University of Michigan engineers is
the first to yield such information for
potassium. Specifically, their research
showed that the pressure drop of po-
tassium, a key molten metal coolant
prospect, was only one-third of what
had been anticipated under these
flow conditions. Typically, the pres-
sures of circulating fluids drop as the
lluiil flows through a system away
i:
from a pump. The higher the pres-
sure drop, the more energy required
by the pump to circulate the fluid.
Therefore, it appears potassium units
might have higher efficiencies than
projected.
The U-M study covered a tempera-
ture range from 800° to 1500°F. At
these temperatures the vapor (or
"steam") pressure of water becomes
so great that containers for using
water as the coolant would require
walls too thick to be lifted into space
economically.
The study was conducted as one
phase of a $.'{50,000 program con-
ducted for the Air Force Aero-Space
Division under Bal/hiser's direction.
Dr. Lowell Smith (who recentlv joined
Pan American Petroleum after com-
pleting his studies at the U-M) per-
formed the studv under Balzhiser and
Prof. M. Rasin Tek.
"Fuel-Loving" Bacteria
Researchers at The University of
Michigan Medical Center are begin-
ning to probe a curious mystery of
oxidation—a trait which enables cer-
tain bacteria to thrive on aircraft jet
fuel. The investigation will concen-
trate on something known in medical
jargon as "omega-oxidation," a mech-
anism for converting fatty acids into
body energy. Analysis of the phe-
nomenon may have unsuspected im-
plications for a greater understand-
ing of energy conversion in the human
body.
The study is being launched under
a grant of $125,000 from the Na-
tional Science Foundation. Dr. Minor
J. Coon (Ph.D.), U-M professor of
biological chemistry, will direct the
study which is expected to extend
over three years.

barrelled investigation will seek to
learn how energy is drawn from food
by the omega-oxidation process, and
to find out how the hitch-hiking bac-
teria manage to live in the fuel tanks
of jet aircraft. "It is a strange situa-
tion," he commented. "We want to
find how they live in petroleum, and
then seek ways to control and make
use of that information."
Geophysical Recorder
Two researchers from The Univer-
sity of Michigan's Institute of Science
and Technology (1ST) have described
a new photographic recorder which
has possible applications in detection
of underground nuclear explosions as
well as in such fields as oil exploration,
earthquake research, and the study
of meteorology and geology. The re-
corder was especially designed to pro-
duce seismograms for direct use in an
optical computer.
The 1ST Acoustics and Seismics
Laboratory has applied this computer
to aid in the detection and identifi-
cation of underground nuclear ex-
plosions. Under a contract with the
Air Force Office of Scientific Re-
search, the principle of computation
by means of optical diffraction, first
discovered and developed by the In-
stitute's Radar Laboratory, has been
used to process seismograms in ten
different ways.
Of particular use is the capability
of determining the direction and
velocity with which tremors from
earthquakes and underground ex-
plosions travel. "Noise" and spurious
waves from unwanted directions and
with different velocities can be elim-
inated by this technique.
This optical equipment will be
used to study data from the Large
Aperture Seismic Array being con-
structed as part of the Department of
Defense VELA UNIFORM project.
The array will cover a region 150
miles in diameter in Southeastern
Montana. About 500 seismometers
will be used in this array. (John M.
De Mover, acting head of the Acous-
tics and Seismics Laboratory has been
active in the planning and designing
&lt;&gt;f this array in cooperation with the
Department of Defense.)
From the inception of this investi-
gation of seismic optical processing in
June 1961, this project has had the
interest and cooperation of the oil
exploration industry, which supplied
the first seismograms to be analyzed
by the computer. The application of
optical computers to oil exploration
is now becoming commercially feasi-
ble.
Other geophysical applications
growing out of this investigation have
been found in meteorology and geol-
ogy, and for studying the earth's grav-
ity and magnetic fields, and are de-
scribed in a forthcoming issue of the
American Optical Society's Journal,
Applied Optics.
The Cost of Cutting A Class
Let us say that to attend College it
costs you $800 per semester to pay all
expenses including registration, room
and board, laundry, books and sup-
plies, clothing, and travel expenses
from and to home. Also, if your earn-
ing power is as much as $1.50 per
hour at a summer job, you are worth
at least that much on the job here,
so for a 40 hour week you have $60
worth of time invested and this would
amount to $900 in a 15 week semester.
The sum of $800 out of pocket plus
this $900 brings the total to $1700. As-
suming that you carry a 15 credit hour
load, you would have the equivalent
of 15 x 15 or 225 class hours per semes-
ter. Dividing $1700 by 225 brings the
cost of each class hour to $7.50. In ad-
dition to this the State of Michigan
contributes at least as much as you do
anil this must of necessity come out
of taxes which you or your parents
must pay one way or another. So if
we would double the above figure we
would get a more realistic cost. Take
it any way you prefer and you will be
essentially handing out a $7.50 to $15
ticket every time you go to class. Per-
haps we might say that you at least
essentially hand the professor a $10
bill each time you enter a class room
door, and when you cut a class you es-
sentially stay at home and mail him
a $10 bill. Do you have that kind of
money to throw at the birds?
Prof. R. C. Porter
Metallurgy
Lead ore often contains valuable-
metals, such as silver, which can be
recovered profitably as the ore is be-
ing processed. Some of the processes
by which silver may be separated from
lead ore are incompletely understood,
however.
One of these is known as the Parkes
process of lead refining, in which zinc
is added to molten lead to react with
silver so that a silver-zinc solid is
formed. This floats to the surface, per-
mitting separation.
To improve understanding of this
process, two University of Michigan
engineers made a study of the thermo-
dynamic interactions between silver
and zinc in molten lead. They re-
ported their results at the 94th annual
meeting of the American Institute of
Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum
engineers in Chicago.
The findings of U-M Prof. Robert
D. Pehlke and Research Associate
Kazuhisa Okajima concerning thermo-
dynamic interactions should permit a
more accurate determination of the
details of the Parkes process. (Oka-
jima is at the U-M on leave from Na-
goya University, Japan.) It may be,
that if these details can be better un-
derstood, the efficiency of the process
could be improved. Their study also
can be linked to research to clarify
the behavior of atoms in dilute metal-
lic solutions.
Two other U-M engineers also re-
ported, with Professor Pehlke, on as-
pacts of how nitrogen and hydrogen
react in liquid cobalt. These gaseous
elements tend to be harmful to prop-
erties of cobalt alloys if they are pres-
ent. When dissolved in metals, the
hydrogen reacts as a single proton.
Their research will also help metal-
lurgists understand the fundamental
relationship of the proton in inter-
action with various energy differences
of the electron in metals.
Nitrogen can also be harmful to al-
loys if it is allowed to react with vari-
ous molten metals in the preparation
of alloys. However, nitrogen was
found to be relatively insoluble in
cobalt. In fact, at atmospheric pres-
sure and temperature of 2900 degrees
Fahrenheit (or 1600 degrees C), solu-
bility was less than five parts of a
thousand by weight (or .0047). Alloy-
ing elements chromium, copper,
molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten and
vanadium in cobalt slightly increase
this solubility, while aluminum, iron,
nickel and silicon decrease it.
The editors of the Technic wish to

edge the source of the material carried
in this column in the February issue.
The article, "Aeroallergens," appeared

tion's Research News. The article was

It could be the first step to a wise career decision.
For never was there a better opportunity for young engineers
like yourself to participate in the growth of a dynamic,
young industry ... to enter the expanding world of advanced
VTOL systems.
Let's enlarge on this point. Throughout the history of
engineering, man's ability to progress has been accomplished
by combining one technology with another. And at Sikorsky
Aircraft we're doing just that.
The Sikorsky vehicle of today is an advanced VTOL system
. .. blending the technologies of sophisticated electronic
systems and the helicopter airframe to provide a uniquely
new, most versatile means of transportation. Today, our
VTOL systems are working in the broadest areas—ranging
from space capsule recovery to commercial and industrial
transport. And we are aiming far into the future with the
further advancement of this new technology.
And what about you? As a Sikorsky engineer, you would be
helping to move "tomorrow" closer by working in small
interdependent groups on demanding problems in such
areas as aerodynamics • human factors engineering
• automatic controls • structures engineering • weight
prediction • systems analysis • operations research
• reliability/maintainability engineering • autonavlga-
tion systems • computer technology ... among others.
Opportunities for individual stature and personal progress
are here ... now.
And professional competence is further advanced by our cor-
poration-financed Graduate Education Program.

and cut cost 16%
Originally, this earthmover wheel hub was not a forging. Now it is
forged in steel. Here's why . . .
While reviewing costs of the original part, the earthmover manu-
facturer discovered that: (1) Cost of the hub was too high; (2)
rejection rates during machining were high because of voids and
inclusions; and (3) hidden flaws required costly salvage operation.
By converting to forged steel hubs, the manufacturer has saved
16%, has completely eliminated rejects and repairs of parts in
process, has achieved 100% reliability of the part.
Forgings have greater inherent reliability and strength because
they:
1. Are solid, void-free metal
2. Have higher resistance to fatigue
3. Are strongest in withstanding impact and sudden load
4. Have high modulus of elasticity
5. Have low mechanical hysteresis
6. Have unique stress-oriented fiber structure
Memo to future engineers:
"Make it lighter and make it stronger" is
the demand today. No other metalworking
process meets these two requirements so
well as the forging process. Be sure you

production. Write for Case History No. 104.

Anderson's experience is a case in point.
After receiving his B.A. in Physics in June, 1962,
Dale joined our College Graduate Program and
was assigned to our Research Laboratories.
Recently he was given the responsibility for cor-
recting cab vibration occurring on a particular

Mechanical Engineering is a profession of con-
siderable breadth and is essential to virtually every
industry and phase of technology. Because of this
breadth, the curriculum in Mechanical Engineering
at the University of Michigan involves a well inte-
grated program in the basic sciences, engineering
sciences, mathematics and humanities. The program
also includes a relatively large number of electives,
thus permitting a student to take professionally
oriented courses in his particular area of interest or to
prepare for graduate study. Many students avail
themselves of the opportunities to enrich their educa-
tion by participating in research during their under-
graduate and graduate studies.
Among the engineering sciences in the Mechanical
Engineering program are dynamics, stress analysis,
materials, thermodynamics, fluid flow, heat transfer
and automatic control. A Mechanical Engineering
student is also introduced to design, experimental
procedures, and manufacturing processes as well as
to the use of both the analog and digital computer.
The stress in both the undergraduate and graduate
programs in Mechanical Engineering is to prepare
students for a responsible professional career which
includes such activities as design, development, re-
search, technical consultation, and management.

been considerably abetted by the use
of radioisotopes, another space age
development.
But even fewer people are aware
that farm equipment engineering is
also an outpost in the development of
applications for the new materials-
all the plastics and the exotic alloys
now so much in the news. Increasing
fluid pressures associated with ad-
vanced hydraulics and hydrostatics, the
development of gas turbines and fuel
cells, the interest in new methods of
applying fertilizers and herbicides-
all call for far-out research in the
field of engineering materials.
Today, for example, we find farm
equipment engineers immediately
concerned with a device which came
into being because of the need to
simulate rocket nozzle and re-entry
temperatures. If they can adapt the
plasma jet to our economics for spray
coating with heat and corrosion-re-
sistant ceramics or if they can use it
to put a layer of tungsten carbide
on mower and combine knives, they
will have found the value of another
unknown in the technological equa-
tion.
Or consider the subject of reli-
ability. Within our recent memory, it
was a new concept rising from the
need to predict life of spacecraft and
missile components which might be
irretrievable for failure evaluation.
Today farm equipment and other
down-to-earth industries constitute
the new territory for exploration in
this field. Our engineers have made
notable progress in adapting reli-
ability techniques, but a great deal of
creative work remains to be done if
we are to continue satisfying the de-
mands of a rapidly changing agricul-
ture. And all the newest techniques, as
well as those yet to be discovered, will
inevitably play a part in the effort.
Still, we don't have to look beyond
the present to get excited about the
contribution of farm equipment en-
gineers. Fifteeen years ago, who would
have foreseen ti actors with 95 PTO
horsepower, with hydrostatic power
steering, with ability to shift on the
go, and with a draft-sensing system
and brain box to maintain constant
depth of ground working tools? Who
would have foreseen a combine with
a four-row head? And if someone had
foreseen it, who would have known
what to do with all that wet corn?
Who would have imagined a planter
that drops exactly three kernels in a
hill pattern smaller than a silver dol-
lar, precisely meters fertilizer, herbi-
cide and pesticide, and moves along
the row at six to seven miles an hour?
At the accelerating rate of progress
we can expect in the future, we may
well equal the advancement of the
past fifteen years in the next five—or
even less. And in those years, the most
significant applications of scientific
knowledge are as likely to be demon-
strated on a few acres of midwestern
farmland as among the craters on the
moon.
Now I wonder if, by this time, a
rather interesting question may not
have occurred to you. If all these
things are true, why do we talk to
ourselves about them? There are mil-
lions of people who don't know this
story. Why not tell them?
It's true there probably are millions
of |&gt;eople who don't know the story.
But I'd just like to suggest there are
none who need to hear it more than
we ourselves.
The other day in a business maga-
zine I ran across an article with the
rather intriguing title "Martyrs Un-
limited." The very first sentence was
so thought-provoking that I'd like to
quote it to you:
"There is not one occupation, trade
or profession in this country that is
not misunderstood, neglected, un-
derrated, unloved and rejected—no
group that is not steadily slipping
in popular esteem and in ability to
attract the young . .."
It seems to me that we sometimes
concern ourselves so much with our
public image that we completely neg-
lect the one that turns up in the mir-
ror. We allow ourselves to become so
acutely aware of our competitors that
we are distracted from consideration
of the fine quality of our own prod-
ucts. We become so preoccupied with
the mushroom growth of engineering
outposts eleswhere that we fail to
recognize the one we occupy for what
it is.
We have time to watch the "ser-
vants" heading out in all directions for
the horizon, but no time at all for
"a walk around the palace."
I believe the worst thing that can
happen to any man in any job is to
forget how to get excited about it.
And for an engineer, such forgetful-
ness can be fatal. Creativity feeds on
a sense of urgency. It is sustained by
the realization of useful purpose. And
it soars in an atmosphere of move-
ment and drama.
If farm equipment engineers or con
struction equipment engineers fail to
appreciate the bounty of all these
things which now is theirs, then surely
they will deserve to be misunderstood,
underrated, and unsung.
Let's, by all means, talk to ourselves
if it will help us hang onto the knack
for excitement about the work of our
profession. If we don't have it, who
will? But if we do, we can stop worry
ing about protesting the fact in pub-
lic. The fact will speak for itself.
TECHNIC TEASERS
The Technic has decided to bring
back a feature which used to keep its
readers humble during the late fifties.
However, we are told that these feel-
ings of humility can easily turn to ag-
gressive hostilities if the problems con-
sistently overestimate the abilities of
the reading public. For this reason, we
have been extra careful to screen all
submitted material for only the most
straightforward, perhaps even trivial,
puzzles. For those of you who lack con-
fidence in your solutions, an answer
list has been printed below.
1) If Sara shouldn't, then Wanda would. It is
impossible that the statements: "Sara
should." and, "Camille couldn't." can
both be true at the same time. If Wanda
would, then Sara should and Camille
could. Therefore Camille could. Is the
conclusion valid?

2) Around a cylindrical tube, outside circum-
ference 4", length 9", 10 turns of a wire
are helically wound. The ends of the
wire coincide with the ends of the same
cylindrical element. Find the length of the
wire.

3) If 12 oxen eat the grass (which is growing
uniformly all the time) on 3% acres in 4
weeks, and if 21 oxen cat the grass on 10
acres in 9 weeks, how many oxen will it
take to eat all the grass on 24 acres in
18 weeks?
—Sir Isaac Newton. 1712
4) A man looking at a portrait says: "That
person's father was my father's son. I have
no brothers and no sons." What was the
relationship of the person in the portrait
to him?

10 years from now he may tire of 10 years ago he didn't wait for a
working with computers computer's verdict
People matter more than computers
To lure smart young engineers, we feature up-to-date com-
puter facilities. That's one good reason to have computers.
We have even more compelling reasons, not all to be found
in our widely advertised product lines like family cameras,
film, textile fibers, office equipment, plastics, etc.
What prudence prevents us from publicly spilling is what
occupies and fascinates a large corps of mechanical engi-
neers like Edward T. Kern (right) and his younger colleague,
William S. Walsh. To more colleagues from among the
mechanical engineers of the Class of 1965, we hereby offer
our persuasive combination of long-haul stability and
internal mobility.
We respect an engineer for requesting a chance to broaden
himself by a change of assignment. Both men pictured
here did so.
When we hired Ed fresh out of college in 1947, we had
him spend a year personally running a lathe and doing
bench assembly on new production equipment for film
manufacture. (We rarely start engineers that way any more.)
Then, until 1955, he developed machinery for paper-sensi-
tizing and film-emulsion coating. Next came a stint bossing
a 75-man crew that erected, maintained, and repaired
buildings and equipment for processing Kodacolor Prints
and other large-volume photographic products. Feeling his
feet all too firmly on the ground after three years of this,
he decided to grapple with a subtler form of reality than
concerns the average pipefitter, electrician, or bricklayer.
This decision he made just in time to join his present
team, then forming. For a while he found himself pitching
in with proposal preparation, customer contact, subcontract
technical co-ordination, customer briefings, etc. Gradually
the assignment evolved from communicating about techni-
cal matters to generating rather fundamental technical con-
tent of his own. This he does today, living the life of the
systems engineer, surrounded by logic, concepts, and limit-
ing parameters.
Bill, a 1962 graduate, spent his first year in vibration
analysis and learned how unimportant is the distinction
between an E.E. (which his diploma calls him) and an M.E.,
under which heading he now ventures on the same frontier
with Kern. Before we throw him his retirement party, for
all we know, he may win honors as the greatest living ex-
pert on knitting machinery. We have many interests.

Should You Work for a Big Company?
. W. Corbin, Vice President and General Manager, Industrial Sales Division.
An interview with General Electric's S
S. W. CORBIN
■ Wells Corbin heads what is probably
the world's largest industrial sales organi-
zation, employing more than 8000 persons
and selling hundreds of thousands of di-
verse products. He joined General Electric
in 1930 as a student engineer after gradu-
ation from Union College with a BSEE. After
moving through several assignments in in-
dustrial engineering and sales management,
he assumed his present position in 1960.
He was elected a General Electric vice
president in 1963.
Q. Mr. Corbin, why should t work for
a big company? Are there some
special advantages?
A. Just for a minute, consider what
the scope of product mix often found
in a big company means to you. A
broad range of products and services
gives you a variety of starting places
now. It widens tremendously your op-
portunity for growth. Engineers and
scientists at General Electric re-
search, design, manufacture and sell
thousands of products from micro-
miniature electronic components and
computer-controlled steel-mill sys-
tems for industry; to the world's
largest turbine-generators for utili-
ties; to radios, TV sets and appli-
ances for consumers; to satellites
and other complex systems for aero-
space and defense.
Q. How about attaining positions of
responsibility?
A. How much responsibility do you
want? If you'd like to contribute to
the design of tomorrow's atomic re-
actors—or work on the installation
of complex industrial systems—or
take part in supervising the manu-
facture of exotic machine-tool con-
trols—or design new hardware or
software for G-E computers—or direct
a million dollars in annual sales
through distributors—you can do it,
in a big company like General Elec-
tric, if you show you have the ability.
There's no limit to responsibility . . .
except your own talent and desire.
Q. Can big companies offer advan-
tages in training and career develop-
ment programs?
A. Yes. We employ large numbers of
people each year so we can often set
up specialized training programs
that are hard to duplicate elsewhere.
Our Technical Marketing Program,
for example, has specialized assign-
ments both for initial training and
career development that vary de-
pending on whether you want a
future in sales, application engineer-
ing or installation and service engi-
neering. In the Manufacturing Pro-
gram, assignments are given in manu-
facturing engineering, factory super-
vision, quality control, materials man-
agement or plant engineering. Other
specialized programs exist, like the
Product Engineering Program for you
prospective creative design engineers,
and the highly selective Research
Training Program.
Q. Doesn't that mean there will be
more competition for the top jobs?
A. You'll always find competition
for a good job, no matter where
you go! But in a company like G.E.
where there are 150 product opera-
tions, with broad research and sales
organizations to back them up, you'll
have less chance for your ambition to
be stalemated. Why? Simply because
there are more top jobs to compete
for.
Q. How can a big company help me
fight technological obsolescence?
A. Wherever you are in General Elec-
tric, you'll be helping create a rapid
pace of product development to
serve highly competitive markets. As
a member of the G-E team, you'll
be on the leading edge of the wave
of advancement—by adapting new re-
search findings to product designs,
by keeping your customers informed
of new product developments that
can improve or even revolutionize
their operations, and by developing
new machines, processes and
methods to manufacture these new
products. And there will be class-
work too. There's too much to be
done to let you get out of date!

Lt. Gregory Risch, aeronautical engineer from Notre Dame, varsity swimmer, missile test expert,
tells how you can be part of it.
(Lt. Risch, B.S. '62, did extensive un-
dergraduate work in aerodynamics,
helping to construct one of the coun-
try's largest and most successful smoke
tunnels. He has played an important
part in the operations of the test range
at Cape Kennedy.)
What's the
best way to become an
Air Force officer?
I wouldn't want to call any one wav
the "best" way. We count on getting
top-quality officers from all our sources.
First, there's the Air Force Academy.
I received mv commission through Air
Force ROTC. Main' colleges and uni-
versities will soon be providing two-
year AFROTC programs that you can
apply for during vour sophomore vear.
Then, for the college graduate, there's
Air Force Officer Training School—OTS.
Who's eligible
for Air Force OTS?
Any college graduate, male or female,
or a college student within 210 days
of graduation, is eligible to apply. Who
the Air Force will take depends on what
the particular needs are at the time.
Those with scientific or engineering de-
grees can usually count on receiving the
first openings.
Does the Air Force have
jobs for nonscience majors?
There are quite a few jobs in non-
technical fields such as administration
and personnel. And it is not essential
that prospective pilots or navigators
have backgrounds in the sciences. How-
ever, since the Air Force is one of the
world's leading technological organiza-
tions, a keen regard for science is im-
portant.
What sort of work
do young Air Force officers do?
Important work. An Air Force career
gives young people the opportunity to
do meaningful work right from the start.
That's the thing I like best about it.
I'm only a couple of years out of col-
lege, but already I'm working on a vital
project in an area that really interests
me. In other words, I'm getting to use
the things I studied in college. My edu-
cation is paying off, both for me and
for the United States.
What are the
possibilities for advancement?
They're plenty good. The Air Force be-
lieves in giving its young officers all the
responsibility they can handle. That's
not only good for you, it's good for the
Air Force. It gets the best-qualified
people into the top jobs where they can
contribute most to our defense effort.
How long am I committed to serve?
Four years from the time you receive
vour commission. If you go on to flight
school, four years from the time you're
awarded your pilot or navigator \ving;s.
Where can I find out more?
If there's an Air Force ROTC unit on
your campus, sec the Professor of Aero-
space Studies. If not, contact the near-
est Air Force recruiting office. It's listed
in the white pages of the telephone
book under "U.S. Government".

What does it take to "spark" a man to his very
best ... to bring out the fullest expression of his
ability and training? At Ford Motor Company
we are convinced that an invigorating business
and professional climate is one essential. A prime
ingredient of this climate is the stimulation that
comes from working with the top people in a
field . . . such as Dr. James Mercereau.
Jim Mercereau joined our Scientific Laboratory
in 1962. Recently, he headed a team of physicists
who verified aspects of the Quantum Theory by
creating a giant, observable quantum effect in
superconductors. This outstanding achievement
was the major reason the U. S. Junior Chamber of Commerce selected
Dr. Mercereau as one of "America's Ten Outstanding Young Men of 1964."
Your area of interest may be far different from Dr. Mercereau's; however,
you will come in contact with outstanding men in all fields at Ford
Motor Company.
We believe the coupling of top experience and talent with youth and
enthusiasm is stimulating to all concerned. College graduates who join
Ford Motor Company find themselves very much a part of this kind of
team. If you are interested in a career that provides the stimulation of
working with the best, see our representative when he visits your campus.
We think you'll be impressed by the things he can tell you about working
at Ford Motor Company.

A FACULTY EVALUATION
The value of engineering education is determined by sev-
eral factors that are found only on the college campus. Prob-
ably the most prominent of these factors is the wide range of
often conflicting interests that draw the faculty to the campus.
Some of the faculty members are here because they love to
teach; some love to take advantage of the extensive research
facilities; some enjoy the University atmosphere and com-
panionship of others interested in their specialty; and some—
probably a majority of them—are here to fulfill their desires in
some combination of the three aforementioned areas.
This unique combination of motivations brings to mind sev-
eral rather difficult questions. What is the University here
for? Does it exist for research, as one might well suspect from
noting the millions of dollars spent on research here every
year? Is it intended to be nothing more than a gathering place
for experts to hash over their specialties? Or is it still an in-
stitution whose primary concern is planting seeds of interest
and knowledge in the minds of the next generation?

Let us assume that the University's prime concern is still
the students. Furthermore, let us assume that the other things
that draw the faculty to the University do not conflict with
this primary function. Let us even assume that these minor
functions of the University actually complement the main
function.
This leads to the last, and the biggest, question. It the
primary role of the faculty is education, why have they never
received any training in education? There are many excellent
teachers in the College of Engineering, but there are also many
who have not learned the fine art of presenting concepts to
uninitiated minds. Engineers tend to think of psychologists
and professional educators as being rather scientifically incom-
petent, but many engineering faculty members could do them-
selves a big favor by acquainting themselves with a few funda-
mental pedagogical principles.
This is not to say that a couple of courses in the Education
School would automatically insure a one hundred per cent
competent faculty, for it is definitely an idealization to assume
that the faculty's shortcomings are due entirely to their lack
of training in education. Many of the professors just don't care
about teaching. Unfortunately, they—the ones that would
probably benefit the most from a little educational training-
are the last ones who would consent to take a course in educa-
tion.
How could pressure best be brought to bear upon those
faculty members who are failing as educators due to their lack
of educational training, lack of concern for their work, or
both? It would seem that a well organized student evaluation
of the faculty could be the best means available. For such an
evaluation to be effective it must be taken seriously by the
students, and it must be interpreted just as seriously by the
faculty. The Engineering Council has prepared a form for
faculty evaluation and has made it available for the faculty
to give to their students, but a professor does not have to
allow his students to evaluate him if he does not choose to
do so. And, unfortunately, the ones that could benefit from
student criticism are the same ones that will probably refuse
to be evaluated.
Therefore, the faculty evaluation must be made compulsory.
No faculty member would necessarily be hurt by such an
evaluation, and every faculty member should be forced to look
at himself through his students' eyes at least once a year. Per-
haps then some faculty members would find it expedient to
reassess their value to the students and the University.

The name to remember for career potential? SIKORSKY.
It could be the first step to a wise career decision.
For never was there a better opportunity for young engineers
like yourself to participate in the growth of a dynamic,
young industry... to enter the expanding world of advanced
VTOL systems.
Let's enlarge on this point. Throughout the history of
engineering, man's ability to progress has been accomplished
by combining one technology with another. And at Sikorsky
Aircraft we're doing just that.
The Sikorsky vehicle of today is an advanced VTOL system
... blending the technologies of sophisticated electronic
systems and the helicopter airframe to provide a uniquely
new, most versatile means of transportation. Today, our
VTOL systems are working in the broadest areas—ranging
from space capsule recovery to commercial and industrial
transport. And we are aiming far into the future with the
further advancement of this new technology.
And what about you? As a Sikorsky engineer, you would be
helping to move "tomorrow" closer by working in small
interdependent groups on demanding problems in such
areas as aerodynamics • human factors engineering
• automatic controls • structures engineering • weight
prediction • systems analysis • operations research
• reliability/maintainability engineering • autonavlga-
tion systems • computer technology ... among others.
Opportunities for individual stature and personal progress
are here ... now.
And professional competence is further advanced by our cor-
poration-financed Graduate Education Program.
Please consult your College Placement Office for campus
interview dates—or—for further information, write to

Special agent plots overthrow of hidden enemy,
The hidden enemy is vapor in automobile fuel lines.
Causes vapor-lock that stalls cars on warm days.
Our special agent is Dr. John O. Becker, University of

relationship as he specializes in fuel volatility at our
Whiting, Ind., Research &amp; Development lab. One of his
theories has already been proven. The next step—a
practical application useful in re-blending gasoline. To
make it less prone to vapor-lock.
In his spare time, Dr. Becker is boning-up on car
engines of the future. Maybe someday he'll help us
formulate a new kind of fuel for a yet-unknown engine.
How about you? Looking for a challenge—and a
chance to contribute to the exciting new technologies
shaping tomorrow's world? Your opportunity may be

Throughout history, mankind has
been afflicted with a succession of
diseases, each more horrible than the
last. Recently, however, such diseases
as smallpox, cholera, bubonic plague
and polio have been successfully con-
trolled and relegated to medical books
and occasional memories. Today, de-
spite enormous progress in the med-
ical sciences, we are again forced to
turn large amounts of time, money
and energy toward tracking down and
eradicating a new enemy: cancer. Be-
cause cancer manifests itself in such a
variety of forms, our forces are often
divided. Leukemia, a cancer of the
blood, is one such variety. This disease,
in turn, is also variegated. In fact, it
has been postulated that we actually
face a multitude of related diseases
and not one all-inclusive villain.
A BRIEF SUMMARY OF
THE DISEASE
Admittedly, our knowledge of leu-
kemia is limited. We are still in
doubt about what the enemy looks
like, how it works, where it resides,
etc. For this reason a dossier of some
sort including observations and de-
scriptions of the modus operandi is
valuable.
Unlike most of its predecessors leu-
kemia is almost invariably fatal and
often does not provide adequate symp-
toms for diagnosis for considerable
lengths of time. Often the patient
feels no need to even visit a physician
until his condition has already reached
the level of a leukemia. Leukemias
are diagnosed mainly through exam-
ination of the blood. This entails
studying the consequence rather than
the cause. Leukemia is actually a dis-
ease (either chronic or acute) of the
white - blood - cell - producing tissues
and as such, examination of these tis-
sues are sometimes vital for accurate
diagnosis. The resulting abnormally
formed cells appearing in tremen-
dously increased numbers form the
basis for our system of nomenclature.
The five normal types of white blood
cells or leukocytes are: neutrophil,
eosinophil, basophil, monocyte, and
lymphocyte. The first three are known
collectively as granulocytes (due to
the presence of granules in their cyto-
plasm.) Hence, we have terms such as
monocytic leukemia, granulocytic leu-
kemia, etc. The term myeloid leu-
kemia refers to leukemia of the bone
marrow.
In acute leukemia the onset resem-
bles an infectious condition with
fever, with anemia and ulcerations of
mucous membranes (especially of the
mouth and throat) being the predom-
inant symptoms. Acute leukemia may
initiate a large variety of diseases and
is itself rapidly progressive as in ex-
treme cases (fulminant leukemia)
when the patient dies within a few

weeks. Three conditions most fre-
quently accompany acute leukemia:
1) anemia—examination of the blood
finds anemia (the reduction in num-
ber of red blood cells and/or hemo-
globin) present almost without ex-
ception; 2) thrombocytopenia—a de-
crease in the number of blood plate-
lets in conjunction with abnormalities
of various kinds in the existing plate-
lets results in a prolonged bleeding
time and frequent hemorrhaging;
3) abnormal leukocytes often accom-
panied by leukopenia (a reduction in
the number of mature white blood
cells).
Chronic leukemia, as the name im-
plies, may be present for long periods
of time with such symptoms as an en-
larged spleen, leukocytosis (increase
in the number of mature white blood
cells), enlarged lymph nodes, and
anemia.* In chronic granulocytic leu-
kemia for example the white blood
cell count ranges from 50 to 300 thou-
sand and higher as compared to the
normal range of between 5 and 10
thousand.
Incidence
The occurrence of leukemia is
world-wide, but there are considerable
differences in its incidence in different
geographical areas and among differ-

ent peoples of the world. Recent fig-
ures published by the World Health
Organization show similar mortality
rates in most European countries, the
U.S., Israel, Australia and New Zea-
land, but a much lower rate in Japan.
The American Negro population has
a lower rate than the white popula-
tion and American Indians have lower
rates than either Caucasians or Ne-
groes.
The low figures for japan are ex-
plained by a virtual absence of the
chronic lymphocytic types. The dif-
ference in rates among Negroes and
whites in the U.S. is not easily ac-
counted for. Although social factors
may play a role, there seems to be a
real difference between the races in
the incidence of leukemia. Similarly,
leukemia is more common in Ameri-
can Jews than in Catholics or Protes-
tants. In addition, higher mortalities
from leukemia have been found in the
"upper" as compared to the "lower"
social groups. The best explanation
for such differences lies in the fact that
different populations may not only be
subject to varying degrees of exposure
to leukemogenic agents, but that their
susceptibility may also vary. External
factors and general social conditions
may add to these differences.
On a smaller scale, the incidence of
leukemia may be examined on the
basis of age, sex and occupational dif-
ferences within a given population.
Various studies have shown that acute
leukemias are fairly restricted to the
young and that children below five
years of age are most frequently af-
fected. Chronic leukemias fall into
the middle aged group with chronic
granulocytic leukemia primarily af-
flicting younger (30-39) groups (see fig.
I)-1
Leukemia is more common in males
than in females. Between the ages of
14 and 29 males and females are
equally affected, but over the age of
30 there is a significant increase in the
number of males with leukemia. Be-
cause of the differences in the inci-
dence rates among the sexes at various
age levels, it appears jx&gt;ssible that the
sex hormones may, in some unclear
manner, play a role in the process of
leukemogenesis.
Occupational differences may ac-
count for the significant differences in
incidence rates of still another seg-
ment of the population. Studies along
these lines are usually involved with
occupational exposure to a single
leukemogenic agent, namely radiation.
Leukemia is 1.7 times more common
among physicians than among white
males in the general population. Radi-
ologists, however, exhibit a frequency
of between 8 ami 10 times that of non
radiologist physicians.
In a study published by H. S. Mart-
land in 1931- it was learned that work-
ers who painteil watch dials with
pastes containing radium often in-
gested considerable quantities of this
element in the process of wetting their
brush tips with their tongues. After a
period of years, there was an intense
replacement of the normal adult fatty
marrow of these workers by an ac-
tively regenerating bone marrow, set-
ting the stage for myeloid leukemia.
THE TREND
Over the past thirty years, the mor-
tality rate from leukemia has been
rising steadily (see fig. 2).3 In 1939-
1940 only 3.6% of the deaths due to
cancer were attributed to leukemia.
This rate has increased steadily in the
United States from 39 per million
population in 1940 to 65 per million
in 1954. The increase in deaths due
to leukemia becomes even more strik-
ing if the population is broken up

fallout, which affects the total popu-
lation and affects the young more
than the old (most likely due to the
immaturity of the hemapoietic or
blood forming system of the young)
can hardly be held responsible for this
difference. According to Gilliam and
Walter4 the probability of dying from
leukemia under the age of 5 has been
stable since 1940. Do these alarming
statistics mean that more people every
year are acquiring and succumbing to
leukemia, or can they be accounted
for by the fact that leukemia is being
diagnosed more commonly and more
accurately while there has been little
or no change in the actual incidence?
During the period beginning after
World War I and continuing to the
present, a number of significant
changes have taken place in the field
or medicine which are relevant to this
problem. Among these changes are:
better laboratory facilities, new labo-
ratory methods such as marrow biopsy,
and an increase in the number of prac-
ticing hematologists. These and other
related factors have had a profound
effect on the numbers of leukemia pa-
tients actually diagnosed, thereby ac-
counting at least in part for the ap-
parent rise in leukemia mortality. It
is highly unlikely that we will ever
obtain conclusive data relating to
past years which would enable us to
ascertain the exact extent to which
the above factors have been involved.
Instead, we must rely upon the vastly
improved statistical methods now be-
ing implemented in order to form a
truer picture of the rates of leukemia
incidence and mortality.
The present knowledge concerning
the causes of leukemia is far from
complete and the conditions under
which the causative agents work is for
all practical purposes unknown. For
this reason we may profit by correlat-
ing statistical information with possi-
ble explanations.
It is generally accepted today, that
leukemia is neoplastic in nature (i.e.
is the result of a new and abnormal
growth). This view is substantiated by
the inexorable progress, lack of re-
sponse to treatment, and ultimately
fatal nature of the disease. A variety
of treatments can induce neoplasms.
Mouse leukemia has been generated
by means of irradiation with X-rays
and by application of known carcino-
gens (cancer causing agents), or estro-
genic hormones.
RADIATION EFFECTS
Ionizing radiations constitute the
only group of agents which have been
unequivocally shown to cause leu-
kemia in man and in experimental
animals. It has been known for some
thirtv years that X-rays can induce
leukemia but it was the advent of nu-
clear energy that was responsible for
bringing the effects of radiation be-
fore the medical and public eye.
Similarly, the incidence of leukemia
in survivors of the Hiroshima and
Nagasaki bombings of World War II
led to the re-examination of medically
applied radiations.
As tragic as the bombings of Hiro-
shima and Nagasaki were, the holo-
caust nevertheless provided the first
evidence of effects of a large, single
dose of ionizing radiation upon a
human population.
Recent studies done by the Atomic
Bomb Casualty Commission (author-
ized in 1946 by the President) have ex-
plored the possible connections be-
tween exposure to radiation and a
subsequent development of leukemia.
In compiling statistical data in the
Japanese city of Hiroshima, several
sources of material were used. Most
of the information was provided by-
patients referred by physicians to the
Commission with a diagnosis of leu-
kemia or suspected leukemia. Other
major sources included patients ad-
mitted to hospitals with similar diag-
noses and cases uncovered bv reviews
of death certificates where leukemia
was listed as the cause.
A positive correlation was found to
exist between the individual's distance
from the center of the explosion (the
hypocenter) and his chances of acquir-
ing leukemia (see fig. 3).3 Exposures
in areas within 2.000 meters contrib-
uted 78% of all deaths from leukemia
despite the fact that only 20% of the
total exposed population fell within
this range. Acute radiation effects,
such as purpura* and mouth lesions,
are reliable signs of radiation expo-
sure on a massive level. As the dis-
tance from the hypocenter increased
there was a marked progressive di-
minution in almost all such symptoms.
In all cases, irrespective of the indi-
vidual's distance from the hypocenter
at the time of exposure, acute and
chronic granulocytic forms of leu-
kemia were predominant in 1940, the
incidence of leukemia in Japan aver-
aged one-third that in the United
States in terms of cases per million
living persons and about one-fourth
in terms of the cause of death per ten
thousand deaths. The first massive in-
cidence of leukemia cases appeared in
1947, two years after exposure, and the
peak was only reached in the span
1950-1952. As late as 1958, thirteen
years after the dropping of the atomic
bombs, the recorded incidence of leu-
kemia in the exposed population was
still in excess of the unexposed rate.
Such data are of utmost value in
appraising our use of radiation in
times of peace. Results of a study clone
by Court Brown and Doll in 1957"
suggest that at dose levels greater than
100 rads, there is a linear relationship
between the close of radiation adminis-
tered and the number of persons de-
veloping leukemia. For closes of less
than 100 rads no sufficient knowledge
is available. Literally nothing is
known about partial body irradiations
such as X-ray exposures for diagnostic
purposes. Even the most pessimistic:
estimates have produced no support
for the suggestion that a rise in ex-
posure to radiation is responsible for

It was noted that, at worst, only one
out of 20 leukemia patients have ever
been exposed to significant doses of
radiation.
Of the numerous uses of radiation
in the field of medicine perhaps the
greatest amount of consternation has
been expressed in the area of X-irradi-
ation during pregnancy and conse-
quent foetal exposure. In gathering
evidence with regard to the leukemo-
genic effect on the foetus along these
lines, 39,166 children whose mothers
had had abdominal or pelvic irradia-
tion during their pregnancy were con-
sidered (1945-1958). Nine children
died of leukemia before 1958. The ex-
pected number of cases due to "ran-
dom" occurrence was 10.5. The
amount of radiation or the age at the
time of irradiation in intra-uterine
life did not seem to have a significant
affect. Recent large-scale studies have
so far failed to reveal any dispropor-
tionate occurrence of leukemia among
children irradiated in utero.
Not all evidence, however, is as
heartening. Hundreds of well-authen-
ticated cases were known to have fol-
lowed the administration of doses to
large parts of the body. As an ex-
ample, the use of I181 (a radioactive
isotope of iodine), is usually restricted
to patients over 40 years of age due to
genetic and leukemogenic difficulties
experienced during recent years. The
important unknown factor seems to be
the possibility of a threshold level to
radiation leukemogenesis. This would
mean that present uses of radiation
may only have consequences in the fu-
ture.
THE SEARCH
The mechanism(s) through which
leukemogenic agents work must be
understood if we are to conquer leu-
kemia. A great deal of the evidence
collected in recent years and the as-
sumption of a neoplastic nature of
leukemia lead to the belief that gen-
etic reasons or changes are involved.
This evidence includes the following:
a) Gross visible abnormalities are
often present in the chromosomes
of malignant tumors.
b) Certain leukemic cells are de-
ficient in one or a number of en-
zymes (the production of enzymes
is to a large extent genetically con-
trolled).
c) By means of inbreeding, strains
of mice have been produced which
dilfer in the frequency with which
they develop leukemia and in the
type they develop.
d) Greatly increased occurence of
leukemia in children showing stig-
mata of Mongolian idiocy (20 times
more common than in other chil-
dren). The chromosome comple-
ment of a Mongolian idiot is ab-
normal. The same chromosome (#21
in the "Philadelphia" classification)
has often been found to be abnor-
mal in chronic granulocytic leu-
kemia and its instability might well
be linked with leukemogenesis.
e) Although tumors and blood ab-
normalities have been produced in
chick embryos, the production of
leukemia in man by transfusions,
even of extremely large quantities
of untreated human blood, has
never been achieved.
The case for genetic involvement is
improving steadily but until conclu-
sive data is obtained, the vast number
of alternate theories must be fully ex-
amined and perhaps integrated via
their respective genetic aspects. Until
such time as the route by which and
the optimum conditions under which
leukemia works is known, it is impera-
tive that steps be taken to treat exist-
ing cases as adequately as possible.
The treatment of leukemia, although
all too often ineffectual, does provide
valuable emprical evidence for the
purpose of research.
In 1940, X-ray therapy was almost
the sole method for treating leukemia.
Several years later it was found that a
chemical called aminopterin brought
about striking remissions in approxi-
mately one half of the childhood leu-
kemia cases in which it was used. This
demonstration that an apparently ir-
reversible and hopeless disease could
be reversed and contained, if only
temporarily, led to new optimism and
enthusiasm on the part of workers in
this field. Since then, chemothera-
peutic measures have been greatly ac-
celerated although two main draw-
backs continue to exist. Most of these
agents are myelotoxic (injurious to
bone marrow) and resistance to their
action usually develops after certain
periods of time. Successive remissions
become shorter and shorter until all
value of such treatment is lost and
the "cure" may become worse than
the disease.
For this reason radiation therapy
continues to play a major role in the
treatment of leukemia. This process
makes use of the fact that most normal
cells are resistant to irradition in vitro.
Unfortunately, it seems as if leukemic
cells are too resistant to be entirely
eliminated from the body without the
use of radiation doses which are far
in excess of the "therapeutic range"
and are inevitably fatal to the patient.
It has been estimated that in order to
destroy all leukemic tissue and to pre-
vent its redevelopment, one would
need to apply at least three times the
accepted lethal dose of radiation. This
indicates that leukemic tissue becomes
part of the body's own tissue, and to
destroy it, while leaving normal cells
unaffected, is a worthy but impossible
endeavor at present.
Perhaps our first goal should not
necessarily be to cure leukemia but
rather to keep it under contol over
long periods and perhaps even for the
life span of the individual. This
would be tantamount to a "cure" once
it is realized that the state of good
health which most people enjoy does
not indicate a state of perfection
within our bodies but rather a condi-
tion in which "good" forces mereh
outweigh "bad" ones.
Goals involving a full understand-
ing of leukemia will be longer in com-
ing, yet we have every reason to feel
confident that they will be attained.
One breakthrough in one lab may set
the mechanism into motion which will
relegate leukemia and all cancers to
the ranks of their infamous predeces-
sors. History is on our side.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Tom Huck sought scientific excitement
He's finding it at Western Electric
Ohio University conferred a B.S.E.E. degree on C. T.
Huck in 1956. Tom knew of Western Electric's history
of manufacturing development. He realized, too, that
our personnel development program was expanding
to meet tomorrow's demands.
After graduation, Tom immediately began to work
on the development of electronic switching systems.
Then, in 1958, Tom went to Bell Telephone Labo-
ratories on a temporary assignment to help in the
advancement of our national military capabilities. At
their Whippany, New Jersey, labs, Tom worked with
the Western Electric development team on computer
circuitry for the Nike Zeus guidance system. Tom then
moved on to a new assignment at Western Electric's
Columbus, Ohio, Works. There, Tom is working on the
development of testing circuitry for the memory phase
of electronic switching systems.
This constant challenge of the totally new, com-
bined with advanced training and education oppor-
tunities, make a Western Electric career enjoyable,
stimulating and fruitful. Thousands of young men will
realize this in the next few years. How about you?

During the past decade, consider-
able interest has been fostered in
the techniques of unconventional
power generation, particularly in
those methods which employ no
moving parts. Thermoelectrics,
therrnoionics, solar cells, and fuel
cells are but a few of the areas to-
ward which current research efforts
have been concentrated (1)*. Still
another aspect of unconventional
power generation is that of mag-
netohydrodynamics (often abbrevi-
ated as MUD). Magnetohydrody-
namics, as the name suggests, in-
volves the study of those phenom-
ena which occur when an electri-
cally conducting fluid, such as an
ionized gas, moves in the presence
of a magnetic field. This article con-
siders this last concept of energy
conversion, and has been written
to serve as an introduction for those
who are unfamiliar with the topic
of MHD. The article, itself, con-
sists of three parts. Part 1 describes
the underlying principles which arc
basic to MHD power generation.
In Part 2, the major problems and
difficulties which severely limit its
practical application arc discussed.
Finally, Part 3 presents some of the
recently proposed MHD cycle ar-
rangements which may become fea-
sible in the near future.
I. THE BASIC CONCEPT OF
MHD POWER GENERATION
It is an observed fact that if a
positively charged particle moves in
a magnetic field, it experiences a
directed force given by the vectorial
expression:
F=q(VxB) (1)
( )*Unless noted otherwise, numbers in
brackets designate references at the
end of the article.
Where:
q=positive charge on the
particle
V—velocity of the particle
B=magnetic field intensity
(See Figure 1.)
It should be mentioned that if
the particle were negatively
charged, as in the case of an elec-
tron, it would experience a force
whose direction would be opposite
lo that giv en by equation (1).
The phenomenon described by
equation (1) forms the underlying
principle of MHD power genera-
tion. If an electrically conducting
fluid, such as an ionized gas or
liquid metal, flows through a mag-
netic field and cuts the magnetic
lines of (lux, the charged particles
in the fluid will experience a force.
By virtue of this force, the posi-
tively charged particles will move
in one direction and the negatively
charged particles in the other. If
each type of these charges were col-
lected on two separate plates or
electrodes, a potential difference
would exist across the pair of elec-
trodes. By connecting an external
load to the oppositely charged
plates, a current will flow from one
electrode to the other and hence
generate electrical power.
One possible system would con-
sist of a square duct, oriented in
the x-direction. (1) The electri-
cally conducting fluid moves
through a duct in the x-direction
(the motion being caused by an
axial pressure gradient in the fluid)
and cuts the magentic field (B) in
the z-direction. The top and bottom
walls of the duct are insulated while
the side walls are made electrically-
conducting. The force exerted on
the charged fluid particles displaces
them in the y-direction, the posi-
tively charged particles being
moved in the direction of the in-
creasing y, and the negatively
charged particles in the opposite
direction. As the charge on each
duct wall increases, a potential dif-
ference gradually builds up across
the two walls. This potential dif-
ference produces current through
the externally connected load re-
sistance RL, and hence supplies
electrical power to the load.
2. MAJOR PROBLEMS
AND DIFFICULTIES
There are several problems and
difficulties associated with magneto-
hydrodynamic power generation.
Some of these difficulties have been
overcome through the efforts of ex-
tended research and development,
while others are still being investi-
gated. The chief difficulties which
have been encountered fall into two
categories: those associated with the
MHD generator itself, and those af-
fecting the cycle in which the gen-
erator is installed. The former of
these two problem areas is treated
in this portion of the paper, while
the latter is left to Part 3 which dis-
cusses some proposed applications.
The major areas of concern that
are associated with the generator
proper are:
a) , choice of a suitable working
fluid.
b) . inherent generator losses.
c) . material selection,

Two chief parameters which gov

velocity. This is due to the fact
that the power produced per unit
volume of the generator is propor-
tional to the electrical conductivity
of the fluid and its velocity squared.
(I) If the machine is to assume an
acceptable size, these quantities
must be large. In addition to these
two criteria, the fluid must also be
inexpensive, particularly in those
applications in which the working
fluid is lost; e.g., in an open cycle.
At the present time, the most
feasible working fluid which meets
these criteria successfully is a high-
temperature, gaseous media con-
taining a small amount of an easily
ionizable material. (I) The high
temperatures (about 3500-5000°F)
and the addition of an ionizable
material serve to increase the elec-
trical conductivity of the gas. Gases
are desirable working fluids by vir-
tue of the fact that they are easily
accelerated to high velocities.*
Regarding ionization, it is im-
portant to note that when a gas is
only about 0.1% ionized by weight,
it is very nearly as good a conduc-
tor as it would be if it were com-
pletely ionized. (3) Hence, only a
small amount of an ionizable ma-
terial need be added to the gas
(this process is often called seeding).
It may he worthwhile to note that
a phenomenon known as non-equi-
librium ionization is presently be-
ing investigated and promises to
yield electrical conductivities as
much as 30% higher than those
•Liquid metals, although being good con-
ductors, experience sonic difficulty in this
respect and are not as appealing as gases.

anticipated from equilibrium con-
siderations.*(1)
To date, the most commonly pro-
posed working fluid is combustion
gas seeded with an alkali metal,
potassium being the element best
suited for economic reasons. (1),
(2), (4) Helium seeded with cesium
appears particularly promising for
gas cycles, but Rankine cycles using
rubidium are also being studied.
(1). (5)
b) Losses
There are several losses inherent
in the design of an MHD gener-
ator which pose a problem. These
losses are due chiefly to:1
i) Hall effect
ii) boundary layers
iii) end effects
iv) magnet coil losses
v) a.c. conversion
i) The Hall Effect
This phenomenon, which causes
the charged panicles in the work-
ing fluid to move in a curved path
normal to the plane of the mag-
netic field can cause significant
power losses for some MHD gener-
ators. The Hall effect may be ex-
plained as follows. It was men-
tioned previously that the posi-
tively charged particles in the work-
ing fluid are "pushed" towards one
electrode while the negatively
tharged particles are caused to
move towards the other electrode.
As the particles move in these direc-
tions, they experience an additional
force since they are again cutting
lines of magnetic flux. This "new"
force, which is also governed by
equation (1), tends to move the
particles in a direction opposite to
that of the incoming working fluid.
by Paris Genalis
Gerald Lazerek
Hence, in addition to the force
caused by an axial pressure gradi-
ent in the fluid, there are two
forces which now act on a charged
particle: a transverse force due to
its initial interaction with the mag-
netic field, and a secondary force
caused by a later interaction with
the magnetic field. The combined
effect of these forces causes the
charged particles to move in curved
paths perpendicular to the mag-
netic field. Consequently, fewer
charged particles reach the elec-
trodes, thereby reducing the poten-
tial difference across the electrodes.
This decrease in potential differ-
ence exhibits itself as a power loss
across an externally connected
load. The important thing to note
here is that the Hall effect causes a
loss in power. In some instances,
the power can reach a magni-
tude as large as 2% of the value
computed if Hall effects are ne-
glected! (1)
Due to the extended efforts of
both theoretical and experimental
research, several modifications to
the original MHD generator con-
cept of a square duct have been
realized. Two such solutions, which
appear particularly favorable at
present, are the use of segmented
electrodes and the "Hall" genera-
tor.* The latter is recommended
for those cases in which the power
losses are appreciable, while the
former appears advantageous for
reducing moderate power losses. (7)
ii) Boundary Layers
There are several problems as-
sociated with boundary layer for-
mation on the channel walls. First,
•The interested reader may refer to ref-
erences (1) and (7) for more information

by the magnetic intensity and velocity vectors.
by recalling that the boundary layer
is a region in which the fluid ve-
locity is less than that of the free
stream velocity, it is seen by equa-
tion (1) that, the force exerted on
charged particles in this region is
less than that in the free stream.
Consequently, the time interval re-
quired for charged particles to
reach the electrodes is greater and
hence, the current (flow of charge/
unit time) supplied to an exter-
nally connected load decreases, the
important effect being a reduction
in power supplied to the load.
Concerning the electrodes, a sec-
ond difficulty arises which com-
pounds the situation. Here, a space
charge sheath and a potential drop
at the electrode surface occurs. At
the present time, the true mechan-
isms occurring on the conducting
walls are not clearly understood,
and are the focus of considerable
research effort. (1)
In addition to these two difficul-
ties, boundary layer growth also
poses fluid friction and heat trans-
fer problems (the latter is particu-
larly important since the electrical
conductivity of the working fluid
depends strongly upon tempera-
ture)^!) Both of these effects have
been analyzed for their influence
upon the insulating walls of the
duct and appear to present no sig-
nificant limitation on generator
performance, particularly for large
scale machines. (1), (8)
iii) End Effects
In the channel region immedi-
ately upstream and downstream of
the magnetic field, the positively
charged particles in the working
fluid are attracted to the negative
electrode and the negatively
charged particles are drawn to the
positive electrode.* This reduces
the positive charge on the anode
and the negative charge on the
cathode, the overall effect being a
decrease in the potential difference
across the two electrodes by a loss
in power.
These end losses may be reduced
by extending the magnetic field be-
yond the end of each electrode, and
by installing baffles at the electrode
extremities. Another possible solu-
tion is the injection of seed ma-
terial into the main working fluid
at the upstream end of the elec-
trode, thereby confining the loss to
the downstream end of the channel.
(1)
iv) Magnet Coil Losses
Although theoretical studies dic-
tate that the total magnetic field
loss for a given power output of an
MHD generator is approximately
constant, experiments show that
these losses can reach an appreci-
*This may be explained by (he familiar

able magnitude. (1) One recent
study has shown that if water-cooled
copper field coils are employed in
a 500 mw plant, about 8% of the
total output will be lost. (9) How
ever, super-conducting magnets are
currently undergoing investigation
and appear to offer a possible solu-
tion if their initial cost can be re-
duced. One such example is a field
coil composed of a niobium-zir-
conium alloy cooled by liquid
helium. The cost of this super-
conducting alloy (about $350 per
pound) as well as the cost of a
suitable helium liquefication plant
is high, but promises to reduce the
losses appreciably. (1)
v) A.C. Conversion
The MHD generators described
so far have been D.C. devices which
may be suitable for power transmis-
sion over extremely short distances.
If it is desired to transmit this
power efficiently over long dis-
tances, either some type of an A.C.
inversion mechanism will have to
be adopted, or else the generator
modified to yield A.C. power.
The major obstacle prohibiting
the use of A.C. inversion equip-
ment is that these devices are fairlv
expensive, $20 per kw being a gen-
erally acceptable figure. Further-
more, the reliability of a.c. inver-
sion devices for central power sta-
tions that operate at high power
levels is questionable. (1)
The possibility of generating
A.C. directly in an MHD channel
is of some interest, but requiro
high electrical conductivities for
efficient operation. (1) Perhaps
when more is known about non-
equilibrium ionization, such
schemes will become feasible,
c) Materials
Possibly the largest single prob-
lem to be overcome before MHD
machines become a reality is that
of material selection. (1) This is
due to the fact that the channel
walls must be capable of withstand-
ing high velocities and tempera-
tures without undergoing deteriora-
tion. Tests have shown that refrac-
tory oxides, such as zirconia and
magnesia, are particularly well
adapted to resist these severe oper-
ating conditions, and may make

ing walls. (1) The choice of a suit-
able material for the electrodes is
more difficult however, because
they must also be good electrical
conductors. Few solutions have
been posed to overcome this diffi-
culty, and this is one of the prob-
lem areas towards which consider-
able research effort is directed.
It may also be mentioned that
careful consideration will have to
be given to the techniques of fab-
rication ol the channel walls since
microstructure has an important
bearing on the electrical and ther-
mal properties of manv materials.

3. CYCLE APPLICATIONS
The effective use of an MHD
generator can be made in either an

ing fluid is lost and must be continually
replenished while a closed cycle recircu-
lates the working fluid.
open or closed cycle.* While the
variety of both cycle arrangements
are unlimited, they possess the com-
mon characteristic that the temper-
atures within the MHD machine
must fall in the range of 5000°F-
3500° F (the electrical conductivity
of the working fluid becomes too
low below 3500° F). This causes two
problems:
1. how can the high temperatures
be attained?
2. what should be done with the
hot exhaust gases?
The latter problem has been
solved quite easily by using the
generator as a topping device for a
conventional steam plant. One pos-
sible solution to the former prob-
lem is illustrated in Figure 2 which
proposes a combined MHD-steam
open-cycle power plant. (12) Here,
the working fluid consists of seeded
combustion gases. "The seeded com-
bustion products are expanded in
a nozzle to a high velocity and pass
through the MHD generator. The
gases flow successively through the
high temperature side of the air
preheater and the boiler of a con-
ventional steam power plant. The
conventional plant in turn pro-
duces power to drive the compres-
sors and auxiliaries, antl also pro-
vides a useful electrical output."
(1) The plant also employs oxygen
enrichment and preheating of the
air that is required for combustion.
The use of such an arrangement
however, presents an additional
problem, the design of a high tem-
perature air preheater. In a preheat
cycle, the hot exhaust gases of the
MHD generator are utilized to
form a liquid slag in the gas-slag
heater. This liquid slag is pumped

FORGINGS-how they
improved the reliability
of this crosshead . . .
yet cut cost 20%
Originally, this crosshead for a lift truck was
not a forging. Now it is forged in steel. Here's
why . . .
The lift truck builder wanted to increase the
safety factor to meet greater bending and shear
stresses. He also wanted to increase the fatigue
strength of the part. And all without any in-
crease in weight or cost. He also wanted to
reduce tool breakage caused by irregularities,
voids, and inclusions.
He changed over to FORGED crossheads.
Now the crosshead has the required strength
and stress-resistance, costs 20% less when
machined and ready to assemble, increases
production rates 14% by reducing tool break-
age and increasing machining speeds.
Forgings are better for these reasons; they:
1. Are solid, free from voids and inclusions
2. Have high fatigue resistance
3. Are strongest under impact and shock loads
4. Have a higher modulus of elasticity
5. Have a unique stress-oriented fiber
structure
6. Are low in mechanical hysteresis
Memo to future engineers:
"Make it lighter and make it stronger" is the
demand today. No other metalworking process
meets these two requirements so well as the forg-
ing process. Be sure you know all about forgings.

BRAZILIAN PROJECT
Unknown to many students and
faculty of the University of Michigan,
the Engineering College has, for the
past 2i/2 years, undertaken a program
of assistance to the Brazilian govern-
ment's college level educational sys-
tem. Under the direction of Dean
J. C. Mouzon of the Engineering Col-
lege, this entire, unique program has
moved steadily and very successfully
towards completing its goals. In the
course of his duties, Dean Mouzon has
made several trips to Brazil to keep in
touch with the project's progress. In-
deed, he has become involved with
not only the University of Michigan's
role but also the entire problem of
Brazil's technical educational system.
He addressed the American Associa-
tion of Physics Teachers' Conference
on International Affairs about these
problems in January of this year. The
material in this article is taken from
that speech and also from an interview
with Dean Mouzon.
Brazil's Educational Problems
In a brief glance at the Brazilian
system; there are only 38 engineering
schools in the country which is the
fifth largest in the world. These cen-
ters of technological education are
almost all near the coast of Brazil. In
most colleges each curriculum is set
up and taught by only one or two
teachers. There is very little student-
faculty cooperation and learning.
Since teachers in Brazil are civil
service workers, their low pay is regu-
lated by the government. As a result,
the teaching profession is at the bot-
tom of the readily chosen fields.
Within the system, professors often
leave an established institution and
go to the more profitable area of the
new capital city, Brazilia. In fact the
University of Michigan's project lost
three exceedingly capable men, one
with a Ph.D. from Cal Tech, one with
an M.S. from Cal Tech, and one with
a Ph.D. from MIT, simply because
other locations and industry had bet-
ter financial opportunities.
Another setback is that the Bra-
zilian people tend to measure any
kind of progress in terms of immedi-
ately visible residts, such as buildings.
Extended planning of any nature
is very difficult to achieve with these
people because they are not accus-
tomed to it. Other traditional college
level problems include part-time pro-
fessors, inflexible curricula, irregular
class attendance and student strikes.
But one of the most pressing prob-
lems is that of the lacking appreci-
ation for qualified, well paid facul-
ties. This is expressed by Dean Mou-
zon, "So far as I know there is no edu-
cational institution in Brazil that fully
appreciates the fact that staff excel-
lence is the first requirement for a
first class institution. This, in my
opinion, is a symptom of the basic
problem related to college level educa-
tion in Brazil."
The University in Brazil
Due to the size of Brazil and its
hostile terrain, air travel is necessarily
very heavy. The Air Ministry in Brazil
is responsible not only for the limited
military operations but also for the
huge civil air operations. As a result,
after World War II the air ministry
laid plans for a high level technologi-
cal institution. It was formed in 1947.
and by 1950 the college was underway.
For the next ten years the Brazilian
government financed the institution,
called the Institutio Technologico de
Aeronautico, or ITA. (It is situated 60
miles north from Sao Paulo at Sao
Jose dos Campos.) In the late 195()'s,
ITA had problems with an inade-
quate faculty and slack educational
drive. Thus the Agency for Inter-
national Development, through the
United States government, asked the
University of Michigan's Engineering
College to undertake a program of as-
sistance to ITA. After two years, in
December 1961, the contract was
signed, and the first program of its
kind in South America was launched.
Objectives of the Project
For a program of such scope, broad
objectives had to be established. To
by Omer Voss
epiote from Dean Mouzon's address,
they were "To analyze existing pro-
grams at ITA, to recommend ways of
strengthening them and improving
them as appropriate and, where neces-
sary, to assist in the development of
new undergraduate and graduate pro-
grams in science and engineering and
related fields," also "To train appro-
priate Brazilian counterpart profes-
sors to the end that they may con-
tinue the work of improving and ex-
panding the programs at ITA after
U.S. assistance is terminated." Though
the plans had at first been directed bv
the Air Ministry, ITA's work is onlv
10% military in purpose. At present,
the Brazilian Air Force has no say
in determining the curriculum for the
Institute. Though one reason that the
Air Force has remained at the Insti-
tute is the research labs there, another
reason is that the Air Force acts as a
"buffer" between the officials of ITA
and the Brazilian politicians. It
must be remembered that the step
taken in requesting the United States
to help was large indeed. As was men-
tioned above, the ITA faculty that is
being trained is under civil service
pay. In many instances the staff is na-
turally unhappy, and especially so
since civil service is under the thumb
of politicians.
Program Accomplishments
As it has advanced, the project has
made some remarkable accomplish-
ments. According to director, Dean
Mouzon, they are "the establishment
of an undergraduate program in me-
chanical engineering with its curricu-
lum adopted by the Brazilian faculty.
The first students to receive a B.S.
Degree in Mechanical Engineering
will graduate next year. Also noted
is the establishment of a fundamental
course in materials for all undergradu-
ates. The Brazilian faculty is now
competent to teach this course. Major
strides have been made in establish-
ing a masters degree program in
mathematics currently underway. The
initial steps are being taken to estab-

in physics as well as to review and
modify the undergraduate program.
The final introduction of text books
and improved teaching methods has
been a great improvement over the
previous system of students memoriz-
ing the facidty's lectures. Arrange-
ments have been made with the Na-
tional Research Council of Brazil to
establish funds for the initial pur-
chase of books to be sold to the stu-
dents through the campus book store.
Significant progress has also been
made in training the Brazilian teach-
ing staff. For example, twenty-four
members of the tTA staff have re-
ceived and, in a large part, are still
receiving training on the spot by Uni-
versity of Michigan staff in the teach-
ing of one or more courses in me-
chanical engineering. Excellent prog-
ress is being made in teacher training
in mathematics. There have been sig-
nificant additions to the library. The
development of a relationship with
the Instituto de Enginernia de
Atomica in Sao Paulo such that fTA
students may work on theses at the re-
actor has been a great step forward.
A final example of the achievements
is the completion of three new in-
structional laboratories with develop-
ment of four others in progress. As
stated in the report, "Since the arrival
of the first group of Michigan profes-
sors at ITA, three laboratories, all in
mechanical engineering, have been in-
stalled and are being used for instruc-
tional purposes: 1) a heat transfer
laboratory which, in respect to the
quality of the equipment installed and
its adaptability to the need of under-
graduate and graduate level instruc-
tion, is unique in Brazil and outstand-
ing by American standards; 2) a ma-
chine dynamics and vibrations labora-
tory modelled after one at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, which also is
unique in Brazil; and 3) a time and
motion laboratory. The time and mo
tion laboratory is considered to be
complete; the other two are subject
to expansion. The following addi-
tional laboratories are being de-
veloped under the Michigan/Agency
for International Development (AID)
program: a thermodynamics labora-
tory, a gas dynamics-fluids mechanics
laboratory, a production laboratory
and an instrumentation and control
laboratory."
As to the future, in the next two
years the steps taken will be to com-
plete the undergraduate programs.
The ITA will also be near to having
a masters program in mechanical en-
gineering, materials and possibly
physics, as well as electronics and aero-
nautics. Hopes are high that the level
of scholarship will be great enough
to enable students with master degrees
to earn their Ph.D.s in the United
States in two years.
The Faculty
Currently there are nine members
of the University of Michigan faculty
at ITA. Figure 1 is a chart from the

Garrett-AiResearch? You'll have to
work harder and use more of
your knowledge than engineers
at most other companies.
Xf you're our kind of engineer,
you have some very definite ideas
about your career.
For example:
You've worked hard to get a
good education. Now you want to
put it to work in the best way
possible.
You will never be satisfied with
run-of-the-mill assignments. You
demand exciting,
challenging projects.
You not only accept
individual responsibil-
ity — you insist upon it.
Does that sound like
you? Then AiResearch
is your cup of tea.
Our business is
mainly in sophisticated aerospace
systems and subsystems.
Here, research, design, and de-
velopment lead to production of
actual hardware.
That means you
have the oppor-
tunity to start with
a customer's problem
and see it through to a
system that will get the job done.
The product lines at AiResearch,
Los Angeles Division, are environ-
mental systems, flight information
and controls sys-
tems, heat transfer
systems, secondary
power generator
systems for missiles
and space, electri-
cal systems, and
specialized indus-
trial systems.
In the Phoenix Division there are
gas turbines for propulsion and
secondary power, valves and con-
trol systems, air turbine starters
and motors, solar and nuclear
power systems.
In each category AiResearch
employs three kinds of engineers.
Preliminary design engineers do
the analytical and theoretical
work, then write proposals.
Design engineers do the lay-
outs; turn an idea into a product.
Developmental engineers are
responsible for making hardware
out of concepts.
Whichever field fits you best, we
can guarantee you this: you can
go as far and fast as your talents
can carry you. You can make as
much money as any engineer in a
comparable spot — anywhere. And
of course, at AiResearch, you'll
get all the plus benefits a top com-
pany offers.
Our engineering staff is smaller
than comparable companies. This
spells opportunity. It gives a man
who wants to make a mark plenty
of elbow room to expand. And
while he's doing it he's working
with, and learning from, some of
the real pros in the field.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


A recently graduated Science Engineering student doing Doctoral Research in
Instrumentation Engineering.
Science and technology are continuously expanding into
new fields of activity. During the past two decades sub-
jects of previously limited interest such as space physics,
radio astronomy, solid state devices, nuclear engineering,
computer science, systems engineering and energy conver-
sion have matured into recognized fields of specialization.
The future will undoubtedly bring more rapid advances
and expansion of this kind.
The Science Engineering Program is an interdepart-
mental, science-oriented program which provides a firm
foundation in mathematics, the physical and engineering
sciences, and in engineering analysis and design, and
which also allows sufficient elective freedom to permit
imaginative and energetic students to develop programs
oriented toward interests in newer fields of science and
engineering. Students presently enrolled in the Science
Engineering Program are specializing in such areas as bio-
engineering, radio astronomy, instrumentation engineer-
ing, communications science, computer science, electron
microscopy, nuclear engineering, electrical engineering,
chemical engineering, metallurgical engineering, materials
engineering, business administration, and aeronautical
engineering.
Recent graduates of the Program are undertaking
graduate studies or are working in a comparable, or per-
haps greater, variety of areas in other academic institutions
and industrial organizations.
RESPONSIBLE EDUCATION FOR TOMORROW'S ENGINEERS
The University of Michigan COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING offers programs
in undergraduate study leading to the Bachelor of Science in Engineering
BSE.) in: AERONAUTICAL ENGINEERING, CHEMICAL ENGINEERING,
CIVIL ENGINEERING, ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, ENGINEERING ME-
CHANICS, INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING, ENGINEERING MATERIALS, MATH-
EMATICS, MECHANICAL ENGINEERING, METALLURGICAL ENGINEERING,
METEOROLOGY and OCEANOGRAPHY, NAVAL ARCHITECTURE and
MARINE ENGINEERING, PHYSICS, and SCIENCE ENGINEERING.
Qualified students desiring to continue their studies beyond the
Bachelor's Degree should consult with the program advisor or advisory
committee for the desired program. Assistance is frequently available
either through fellowships or a variety of employment opportunities in
teaching or research. Inquiries on admission to Graduate Study should be
addressed to Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies. For par-
ticulars and announcements, address: Mr. A. R. Hellwarth, Secretary, Ann
Arbor, Michigan.

tours beyond two-year periods.
Professor Gustave Rabson assumed
the duties of the Chairman of The
University of Michigan Group and
Chief of Party on February 4, 1965.
He has agreed to stay at ITA until
about July 1, 1967. Members of The
University of Michigan faculty in Ann
Arbor and Brazil are spending con-
siderable time studying methods for
assisting ITA with the development
of a masters program in mechanical
engineering. It is hoped that this study
will be completed before the first of
June 1905. Assisting in the masters
program is the only remaining new
task currently being planned. Tenta-
tive plans are being formulated which
might permit the completion of the
program by making use of short-term
staff members sent to Brazil to per-
form specific tasks. Such an operation
is now technically feasible in view of
the sound base that has been estab-
lished and can be maintained by the
seasoned staff that will remain in Bra-
zil.
The Engineering College faculty is
paid solely by the University of Michi-
gan, and all equipment, shipping and
travel expenses are looted by the Uni-
versity. Certainly with a budget of
.$600,000, this is no small operation.
Financial payments are made by the
Brazilian government through Wash-
ington.
A Few New Steps
As the faculty established itself, it
incorporated many of the Engineer-
ing College traits. Some of these were
the establishment of a full time staff;
a flexible, faculty controlled curric-
ulum; an elimination of appointed
academic chairs; required class atten-
dance; the student honor system; and
a student government. To ensure the
continuing high caliber of students at
ITA, admission is by examination
only. Last year, 140 students were ac-
cepted out of 2800 that took ITA's en-
trance exams. Thus, the project has
established itself and its rules.
Specific Achievements
Two years ago no faculty member
of ITA had even a bachelors degree in
mechanical engineering, therefore,
the introduction of this curriculum
and the development of the necessary
staff to reach it plus extending it into
the graduate level represents the
major portion of the work undertaken
so far. Each of the following is a sum-
mary taken from the fourth semi-
annual report compiled by Dean Mou-
zon.
Four ITA staff members have re-
turned from the U.S. with advanced
training in mechanical engineering,
one with a Ph.D. Professor Kunzie,
who joined the ITA staff relatively
recently, has been appointed Chief of
the Division of Mechanical Engineer-
ing. He replaces Professor Chrispim
who replaced Professor Ricardo about
a year ago. The latter resigned from
ITA in November 1963.
Professor Rabson of The Univer-
sity of Michigan staff, and ITA's Pro-
fessors Borges and Amaral, who re-
cently returned to ITA from the U.S.
with Ph.D.'s, have been making great
progress in upgrading the Department
of Mathematics. It is anticipated that
the assistance and inspration rendered
by the visit of Professor Cesari, an in-
ternationally famous mathematician
at The University of Michigan and
under whom Borges studied for his
Ph.D., will go a long way toward
crystallizing the work in mathematics
at ITA.
The Physics Department appears to
be extremely cooperative with Pro-
fessor Zimmerman of The University
of Michigan staff, although he has
been at ITA only since July 1964. His
earlier experience working with the
Brazilian Atomic Energy Commission
and its reactor in Sao Paulo is paying
dividends. His developing cooperative
work between ITA and the staff of
the reactor, is a novel and healthy
experience for ITA anil Brazil. Pro-
lessor Zimmerman has also obtained
some support, although modest, in the
way of equipment from the Brazilians.
The Division of Electronics, the
work of which is comparable to that
of many departments of electrical en-
gineering in the U.S., has a good staff
and good leadership. All that this
group needs is a better environment
and some support in the way of
equipment. Some modest support is
being provided to them from con-
tract funds.
A significant number of new Ph.D.'s
have been returning to the staff of
the Division of Electronics, in fact so
many that ITA probably cannot and
should not keep them all. In view of
the above it was determined that it
was unnecessary to send a long-term
staff member from The University of
Michigan in this area.
The enrollment in aeronautics has
had a large drop since the introduc-
tion of the mechanical engineering
curiculum. This was to be expected
in view of the lack of any significant
aircraft industry in Brazil. At the con-
tinued insistence of Professor Cec-
chini, Reitor of ITA, Professor Alex
Petroff was sent to represent The Uni-
versity of Michigan in the area of air-
craft design. It turns out that he has
not found it possible to be particularly
useful in that area for three reasons:
One is the drop in enrollment; an-
other is the resignation of the Chief
of the Division in November 1963, and
thirdly there is the insistence of the
Brazilian staff member interested in
design that the students continue their
design projects on gliders only.
Professor Petroff has, however, made
himself useful in working on the de-
velopment of a joint aeronautical-
mechanical engineering laboratory in
fluid mechanics and presenting a new
course on propulsion. The Universitv
of Michigan does not expect any fur-
ther staff assistance in the area of aero-
nautical engineering after September
1965.
In the formal report of the inspec-
tion trip made to ITA in December.
1961, it was noted that a fundamental
course in materials and metallurgy
for all students must be established.
It was for this purpose that Professor
Schneidewind went to Brazil. As is
pointed out in the list of accomplish-
ments, this course has indeed been
adopted as part of the curriculum ami
there are Brazilian faculty members
who are now competent to teach it.
Problems
There have, of course, been many
problems to overcome since ITA was
set up in 1947. Before The University
of Michigan entered into the venture,
the Brazilian government had taken
steps to relieve the new institute of
many of the problems that plagued
that country's educational institutions.
ITA has made a definite impact on
Brazil. On the other hand no Brazilian
institution fully appreciates the fact
that staff excellence is the first require-
ment for a high quality institution.
ITA is no exception.
It is hard to judge as yet whether or
not ITA has made any real progress
on this problem. Placing the faculty
partially on civil service in recent
years was obviously a backward step.
During the past year ITA has lost
from its permanent faculty three of its
best men. These are: Professors Jacek

Octavio Gaspar S. Ricardo. There is
nothing new about an institution los-
ing good professors. In this case, how-
ever, there seems to be no evidence
that a serious effort was made to keep
them, nor is it clear that they will be
replaced with men of comparable
talents.
The general faculty situation at
ITA may possibly be deduced by re-
cent observations made by two mem-
bers of The University of Michigan
staff. Concerning the Mathematics
Department, Professor Rabson said
the following:
"Without counting myself there are
ten people in the department (and an
eleventh studying applied mathe-
matics at New York University).
There are three associate professors,
two (between 30 and 40) who have the
doctorate and Professor Lacaz, about
50, who has done some advanced work
in Italy. I believe that these three are
competent."
Eor the Physics Department, Pro-
fessor Zimmerman said:
"The dominant need of the De-
(Continued next page)

(Continued from page 31)
partment of Physics is for a high-
caliber faculty and department chair-
man. Many of the best teachers and
researchers in Brazilian physics have
begun a career at ITA only to change
their minds and leave. Every effort
must be made to attract good physi-
cists to our faculty, and to correct
some of the features of ITA which
evidently are objectionable. After that,
the other problems will resolve them-
selves."
This cooperative program spon-
sored by the AID at ITA is resulting
in an atmosphere in which the young
Brazilian faculty can for the time
being flourish. The visible results of
such a program can be measured in
terms of curriculum, laboratories,
libraries, and many new friendships.
It is hoped that helping the young
capable faculty members to get a good
start, in addition to the visible accom-
plishments, will result in the Bra-
zilians moving toward the resolution
of their fundamental educational
problems.
Now that the University of Michi-
gan has achieved so much, other in-
terests are willing to give support. The
Ford Foundation has set up fellow-
ships to encourage up-coming science
teachers in Brazil. The Organization
of American States and the Pan Ameri-
can countries are currently attending
the sessions.
As the project has developed, ITA
has become a major part of a science
center, the Central Technical Agency,
that includes "ITA, three creditable
Air Force research and development
laboratories, a national upper atmos-
pheric research laboratory and a satel-
lite tracking station." Yet with such a
complex, there is very little coopera-
tion between any single parts, and un-
forunately much valuable manpower
and effort are wasted.
Nonetheless, the strides that have
been made by the University of Mich-
igan Engineering College Brazilian
project are many and great. Not only
has the work affected ITA, but it has
also affected the entire technical edu-
cation system of Brazil. The new meth-
ods and systems of ITA are rapidly be-
ing adopted all over that country.
These amazing accomplishments are
another proud first for the University
of Michigan and a tribute to those
working on the project. END

to a slag air heater. As the pre-
heated air enters the air-slag heater,
it encounters a downward "rain" of
liquid Ryash or slag. By using this
technique, it is estimated that the
inlet air to the combustion chamber
will attain a temperature of about
3800° F. (4)
Another cycle which attempts to
solve the problem of achieving high
temperature working fluids is the
closed-cycle nuclear reactor power
plant. This cycle is basically a re-
generative gas turbine cycle which
employs helium as the working
fluid.* The regenerator is desirable
for high efficiencies since it permits
the high enthalpy associated with
the hot exhaust gases from the
MHI) generator to be used effec-
tively. As the gas leaves the regen-
erator, it is reduced in temperature
in the cooler and enters the com-
pressor. After being compressed,
the gas passes through the regen-
erator, is heated in the gas cooled
nuclear reactor and enters the
MHI) generator. The thermal ef-
ficiency of such a cycle is only about
25% but may be increased to al-
most 59% by using a steam plant in
place of the cooler.
A few remarks concerning the
economics of MHI) power cycles
may be made. In general, it can be
said that the initial costs which are
incurred are high and are due
chiefly to:
1. devices which attempt to raise
the temperature of the work-
ing fluid,
2. devices which utilize the hot
exhaust gases of the MHD
generator efficiently,
3. the cost of the generator itself,
4. the provision of seeding ma-
terials,
5. a.c. power transmission.
In addition to this it is expected
that the maintenance and repair
costs of an MHI) plant will be
higher than in a conventional steam
plant since many of the compon-
ents in MHI) cycles have not yet
•The interested reader may refer to ref-
erence S for an excellent description of
the chemical properties of helium which
makes its use particularly attractive for
this cycle.
proven their reliability over long
periods of time. These costs, how-
ever, are offset to a degree by the
high efficiencies obtainable by
MHD plants, and if their initial
costs can be reduced through the ef-
forts of extended research and de-
velopment, MHD cycles may be-
come competitive with conven-
tional plants in the near future.

They are to wed in June, and the
guy had better shut up before she
gets miffed. A gal has every right
to resent the implication that the
betrothed outpoints her in under-
standing of sewing and fabrics and
what's good or bad about them.
Even if it's true. Which it is. We
have made him a pro at it.
It is our crafty intent to stop
at nothing in our efforts to make
garments or fabric furnishings
that carry our identification tag
(as for KODEL Fiber) so pleas-
ing to the ultimate buyer in
every way that she will attribute
the satisfaction all to the fiber
and look for that tag evermore.
This means we put mechanical
engineers, chemical engineers,
chemists and—yes—physicists to
work freshening up the tech-
nology of dyeing, knitting, weav-
ing, sewing, and the other elderly
arts practiced not by us but by
our customers' customers.
As in all the other industries
in which we participate and for
which we seek scientific and
engineering recruits — photog-
raphy, information retrieval, aero-
space, plastics, graphic arts, x-ray,
chemicals—there is much to chal-
lenge the intellectually ambitious
in satisfying the common yearn-
ings of mankind for adornment
of the person and the home. Past
technical accomplishments in
fibers and fabrics, weak by com-
parison with what can be antici-
pated when fresh, better informed
minds pitch in, have sufficed
nonetheless to create the present
affluence where there is plenty
of money on hand to do what
smart people will tell us to do.
All we need are more smart people.
Drop us a line. From polymer

■ Wells Corbin heads what is probably
the world's largest industrial sales organi-
zation, employing more than 8000 persons
and selling hundreds of thousands of di-
verse products. He joined General Electric
in 1930 as a student engineer after gradu-
ation from Union College with a BSEE. After
moving through several assignments in in-
dustrial engineering and sales management,
he assumed his present position in 1960.
He was elected a General Electric vice
president in 1963.
Q. Mr. Corbin, why should I work for
a big company? Are there some
special advantages?
A. Just for a minute, consider what
the scope of product mix often found
in a big company means to you. A
broad range of products and services
gives you a variety of starting places
now. It widens tremendously your op-
portunity for growth. Engineers and
scientists at General Electric re-
search, design, manufacture and sell
thousands of products from micro-
miniature electronic components and
computer-control ied steel-mill sys-
tems for industry; to the world's
largest turbine-generators for utili-
ties; to radios, TV sets and appli-
ances for consumers; to satellites
and other complex systems for aero-
space and defense.
Q. How about attaining positions of
responsibility?
A. How much responsibility do you
want? If you'd like to contribute to
the design of tomorrow's atomic re-
actors—or work on the installation
of complex industrial systems—or
take part in supervising the manu-
facture of exotic machine-tool con-
trols—or design new hardware or
software for G-E computers—or direct
a million dollars in annual sales
through distributors—you can do it,
in a big company like General Elec-
tric, if you show you have the ability.
There's no limit to responsibility . . .
except your own talent and desire.
Q. Can big companies offer advan-
tages in training and career develop-
ment programs?
A. Yes. We employ large numbers of
people each year so we can often set
up specialized training programs
that are hard to duplicate elsewhere.
Our Technical Marketing Program,
for example, has specialized assign-
ments both for initial training and
career development that vary de-
pending on whether you want a
future in sales, application engineer-
ing or installation and service engi-
neering. In the Manufacturing Pro-
gram, assignments are given in manu-
facturing engineering, factory super-
vision, quality control, materials man-
agement or plant engineering. Other
specialized programs exist, like the
Product Engineering Program for you
prospective creative design engineers,
and the highly selective Research
Training Program.
Q. Doesn't that mean there will be
more competition for the top jobs?
A. You'll always find competition
for a good job, no matter where
you go! But in a company like G.E.
where there are 150 product opera-
tions, with broad research and sales
organizations to back them up, you'll
have less chance for your ambition to
be stalemated. Why? Simply because
there are more top jobs to compete
for.
Q. How can a big company help me
fight technological obsolescence?
A. Wherever you are in General Elec-
tric, you'll be helping create a rapid
pace of product development to
serve highly competitive markets. As
a member of the G-E team, you'll
be on the leading edge of the wave
of advancement—by adapting new re-
search findings to product designs,
by keeping your customers informed
of new product developments that
can improve or even revolutionize
their operations, and by developing
new machines, processes and
methods to manufacture these new
products. And there will be class-
work too. There's too much to be
done to let you get out of date!

now helps light Milan and power Italy's industrial boom
Westinghouse has supplied the world's
biggest atomic reactor of its kind to
Societa Elettronucleare Italiana (SELNI).
Located at Trino, near Milan, this plant
makes Italy the third largest nuclear pro-
ducer of electricity in the world and the
biggest in continental Europe.
The whole countryside around Milan is
in the midst of an industrial boom. The
grain-rich Po river valley is now pour-
ing out autos, machine tools, steel and
pharmaceuticals. This enormous growth
is a strain on the power resources of the
country, because Italy has an almost total
lack of domestic fuel. Atomic power . . .
which uses nuclear fuel . . . promises an
economic solution for Italy and other
power-short areas of the world.
You can be sure if it's Westinghouse

How about a friendly game of cards?
Watch out for our Gene Wollaston, though. He stacks
the deck. In fact, he's already stacked 80 decks—of
computer cards—to build a mathematical model to solve
important refinery problems. With his special skills, Dr.
Wollaston helps determine proper product yields and
properties from key refinery operations. The final result
should be an improved product—at a tremendous saving
of time and money. (Once the model is built, the cost of
solving a problem is as little as S3.00.)
So. as a card player, Gene's helping to take the gamble
out of running a refinery. No mean accomplishment for
a chemical engineer two years out of Illinois Institute
of Technology.
You're not a card player? Don't worry. As long as
you're looking for a meaningful challenge, your oppor-
tunity may be here at American Oil. We're also experi-
menting with fuel cells, spatial environment, and rust
protection in car engines—to mention a few of our diverse
fields of interest. Some of them may interest you, whether
you're in Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics,
or Metallurgy.

"Where would I fit best. . . lab, plant, field, sales, administra-
tion . . . ? What kind of projects . . . ? These were questions
I couldn't answer. So I looked for a company that would give
me room for lateral, as well as upward, growth. One that was
big enough and still personal enough that I could make adjust-
ments as I went along, and not get pigeon-holed.
I found what I wanted at Phillips.
Of course, Phillips is big ... 19th largest among industrials.
But as I got talking to them, I realized this was, surprisingly,
a people-type company. Pleasant, direct, informal. Personal.
I found out a lot more, too. I'd thought of Phillips only in terms
of oil, refining, gasoline. I hadn't known they were so deep in
LP-gas . . . Rubber. . . Plastics . . . Carbon Black . . . Rocket
Propellant Binders . . . Fertilizers . . . Packaging . . . Textile
Chemicals! And that's a highly abbreviated list.
I've been here 3 years now. I've had ample chance to define
my career and make changes. It's worked out very well.
Phillips is a growth company, and I feel I'm growing with it."

like an answer
to global problems of ignorance,
disease and physical deprivation?
Not yet. But we're getting closer.
Behind this movement is a simple statistic with startling im-
plications for all of us — It you count all the scientists and
engineers since the beginning of recorded history, ninety
percent are alive today!
We are now in the midst of the result —an incredible explo-
sion of information from every corner of the globe. And
somewhere within this explosion will be the ultimate answers
to mankind's oldest, and newest problems.
The challenges are many. First, to understand the nature
of this giant intellectual force. Then, to find the best way to
collect it, classify it, store it...and distribute it appropriately
and instantly to the people who need it.
In this light, you might consider today's Xerox products early
and primitive steps along a difficult but fascinating path.
You'd be right. Yet, has anyone taken these steps before us?
Your degree in Engineering, Science, Business Administration
or Liberal Arts can qualify you for some intriguing openings
at Xerox, in fundamental and applied research, engineering,
manufacturing, marketing/sales, finance and administration.

Arm yourself with facts about DuPont
These booklets helped influence some 863 new technical gradu-
ates of all degree levels to join us in 1964.
For example, if you want to start your career in a certain
section of the country, you'll find that Du Pont—with facilities
in 28 states—will try to accommodate you.
If you're interested in growth for what it can mean to you
personally, you'll be interested to know that our sales have
increased more than 750% since 1937. You've probably heard
that R&amp;D expenditures are a good indicator of a company's
future success. We spend $90 million a year on it, $60 million
of which goes straight into "pioneering research"—the discovery
of new scientific truths and new materials.
Our booklets will answer most of your preliminary questions.

ask Rover.
Ask about the Rover-B.R.M. A radical car with a rear-
mounted gas turbine engine. One of the 51 cars that started at
Le Mans this year. One of only 14 with the stamina to finish.
Ask Rover about the engine's unique heat exchanger that
doubled miles per gallon of fuel. They II tell you it was made of
a Coming-developed glass-ceramic trademarked CERCOR*.
Noel Penny, the engine's designer, states: "The low coeffi-
cient of expansion, low thermal conductivity, high specific heat
and economic feasibility of CERCOR glass-ceramic made it the
logical choice for the Rover, with a much better prospect for
future gas turbine engines than any metal counterpart."
Today glass can do jobs that metals can't—and more. Much
more. It can withstand the awesome pressures at the ocean's
floor, maintain constant electrical properties at missile speeds,
save weight without sacrificing strength, bring the stars close
to an astronomer's eye, bend, not bend, break, not break. It's
the most versatile basic material in the world today.
For solutions to their materials problems, industry and gov-
ernment are coming to Corning. Because Corning is the glass-
master. It's a broad, international company, with one of the
most daring, expert and imaginative research and engineering
staffs in the world. Plus, a marketing principle that commits
them to developing products only in areas where a need exists
and no product does.
If you know a company with a technological problem, or a
bright engineer looking for a future, mention Corning.

We all recognize that we live in an era of student
activism on our campuses. Much has been written about
this and many more analyses and studies will no doubt
be made. One question of interest to us is how this stu-
dent activism relates to students in the College of Engi-
neering.
It appears that one major factor is the question of the
purpose of our academic pursuits. Students are seriously
seeking to know why they are studying and toward what
goals they are striving. A few years ago, a graduate stu-
dent and teaching assistant at Berkeley, David Horowitz,
wrote a book entitled Student.1 In this book he writes:
"This country of ours is beautiful. We have known that,
even in our isolation. We have known the richness of its his-
tory, of its traditions, if its material wealth. It is the wealthiest
of the nations of the world. For its young, with a little to set
us on our way, it opens more courses for self-advancement,
more possibilities for success than any other place on the face
of the earth. Yet we arc leaving the universities and turning
away from the possibilities that are open in ever greater and
more unwholesome numbers. Four hundred thousand of us
leave school every year; half who begin college never finish.
"For those of us who remain in school and go on, the pros-
pect has very little brightness in it. Among my friends, most of
whom are graduate students, not one enjoys his studies or is
excited at the thought of continuing them. There is hardly a
man among them who would remain in school if there were a
place for him somewhere else."
It might well be that there is a relation between the
ensuing events at Berkeley and this lack of purpose on
the part of students.
What are the purposes and goals which an engineer-
ing student should set for himself? This is a particularly
important question for freshmen to ask, but one which
is of significance for all of us—faculty, graduate students,
and undergraduates. I would suggest that there are three
aspects to the answer to this question of purpose as it
relates to engineering students.
The first is that our material needs are essentially
satisfied through work. This was very clearly evident in
the days of a primarily agricultural economy. It is equally
true today, even though there is a much less direct con-
nection between the things which come into our posses-
sion and our own efforts. Engineers, however, have a
particular advantage in being intimately involved in pro-
viding the goods and services which both they and others
need or desire, and thus they can rather directly fulfill a
responsibility which each person has to work toward:
meeting his own needs and the needs of others.
We should be aware of the fact that there is a tend-
ency in our day to exalt the organizer and planner
and minimize the contribution of those who take the
responsibility for actually producing the goods and serv-
ices that we need. During a visit to South America this
past summer which I made with Associate Dean, James
Mouzon, he pointed out that in 1962 Brazil graduated
5.000 lawyers, 1,500 engineers, and 50 physicists. Now 1
would not in any sense belittle the work of lawyers
(especially since our new Vice President for Academic
i Ballantine Books, New York, 1962
Affairs is the former Dean of the Law School!), but these
figures do reflect a peculiar attitude. In Brazil many more
people are interested in doing the paper work and legal
work than in actually doing the hard work that is neces-
sary in the industrial development of a country such as
Brazil. Engineers have the opportunity and responsibility
to contribute rather directly and specifically to meeting
these needs. We should of course not react against man-
agement, but recognize that an increasing number of
engineers who have a solid record of accomplishment are
moving into positions of major administrative respon-
sibility. Our first responsibility is to produce effectively,
and management will come afterward.
A secontl point as regards the purpose of engineering
education relates to the fact that our work ought to be an
enjoyable and challenging experience. We spend from
one third to two thirds of almost every day at our work.
If our work provides a creative and stimulating outlet for
the abilities and talents which we have been given, our
work can be much more satisfying than simply an oppor-
tunity to earn a living. For many, engineering offers just
such an opportunity. Our responsibility as faculty mem-
bers is to communicate to students something of the
nature of the engineering profession and the challenge
which it offers. Students in turn should attempt to evalu-
ate both the profession and their own interests and to
attempt to ascertain areas of particular interest and
challenge. Fortunately, engineering is a profession of con-
siderable breadth and offers opportunity for a wide
variety of interest and abilities. Furthermore, an under-
graduate education in engineering is in itself an excellent
education, and provides many students a base from which
they can move into either related or quite different fields
of activity, should they find their real calling lies else-
where.
A third purpose of an engineering education is to
prepare students to assume the broader responsibilities to
life. We are each a member of the society in which we
live, and thus we each have both an opportunity and a
responsibility to participate in such activities as govern-
ment, professional organizations, schools, and churches.
Many of our engineering graduates have made outstand-
ing contributions in these areas. One of the reasons that
each of our programs has a significant amount of non-
technical electives is to enable students to prepare to
accept these broader responsibilities and to do so with
confidence, wisdom, and insight.
Engineering students ought to be activists, but in the
best sense of the word. We should not be afraid to ask
honest and definite questions about purposes and goals
and a host of other matters which relate to university
life. We should also be prepared to work diligently for
the answers, and in so doing accept the responsibilities
which are ours.

Company is:
responsibility
A key dimension of any job is the responsibility
involved. Graduates who join Ford Motor Com-
pany find the opportunity to accept responsibility
early in their careers. The earlier the better. How-
ever, we know the transition from the academic
world to the business world requires training.
Scholastic achievements must be complemented by
a solid understanding of the practical, day-to-day
aspects of the business. That is the most direct
route to accomplishment.
Stephen Jaeger
B.B.A., Unit. 0/ Pittsburgh
Stephen Jaeger, of the Ford Division's Milwaukee
District Sales Office, is a good example of how it
works. His first assignment, in January, 1963,
was in the Administrative Department where he had the opportunity to
become familiar with procedures and communications between dealerships
and the District Office. In four months he moved ahead to the Sales Plan-
ning and Analysis Department as an analyst. He studied dealerships in
terms of sales history, market penetration and potentials, and model mix.
This information was then incorporated into master plans for the District.
In March, 1964, he was promoted to Zone Manager—working directly with
19 dealers as a consultant on all phases of their complex operations. This
involves such areas as sales, finance, advertising, customer relations and
business management. Responsible job? You bet it is—especially for a man
not yet 25 years old. Over one million dollars in retail sales, annually, are
involved in just one dealership Steve contacts.
As a growth company in a growth industry, Ford Motor Company offers
an exceptionally wide spectrum of job opportunities. The chances are good
that openings exist in your field of interest. See our representative when
he visits your campus. We are looking for men who want responsibility—
and will be ready for it when it comes.

Neural Networks
For a long time machines that recognize speech
have stimulated the imagination of scientists,
from the engineer to the linguist, both because
of their potential usefulness to communication
technology and for the formidable technical
challenge they represent. Several years of re-
search at RCA have resulted in notable suc-
cesses in this field by using networks of elec-
tronic neurons (simulated nerve cells) to iden-
tify phonemes—the smallest practical units
into which speech sounds can be divided with-
out losing their identity. These neural net-
works operate on the several outputs of a
spectrum-analyzing filter, dynamically examin-
ing the spectrum and making decisions as to
phoneme identity.

During recent investigations, 18 consonant
sounds (for example, /m/ as in "mad" and
/h/ as in "hid") and 10 vowel sounds were
identified with 86'; to 99'',' reliability when
uttered by any of 6 speakers. Machine recog-
nition of consonants is, in general, much more
elusive than that of vowels, since the identity
of consonants is hidden in the transient be-
havior of the spectrum to a much greater ex-
tent than in its steady-state nature, as is the
case with vowels. Vowel characteristics, how-
ever, usually are more speaker dependent.
The recognition performance obtained repre-
sents, by a considerable margin, the best re-
sults achieved to date by any investigator.
A "neuron," as used in these networks, is a
simple computing element exhibiting the char-
acteristics of fan-in and fan-out, an input
threshold, and a specified analog relation be-
tween output and input when the input ex-
ceeds threshold. An array of several hundred
neurons used in speech analysis is structured
in layers: the first layer receives 20 parallel
inputs from the spectrum filter, and by inter-
connections among its member neurons makes
elementary decisions about the shape of the
spectrum. The many outputs of the first layer
pass, in turn, to a second and then to succes-
sive layers, which make ever more sophisti-
cated judgments both of the instantaneous
characteristics of the spectrum and of the
nature of its changes with time. Finally, binary
logic networks make decisions as to the most
likely identity of the phoneme.
In speech processing, neural networks per-
form with great simplicity, limited-accuracy
operations on a large number of simultaneous
inputs, and maintain continuously analog
measures of the reliability of each decision by
virtue of the analog properties of the comput-
ing elements. These properties, so well suited
for speech analysis, are just those required for
solving pattern recognition problems in general.
It is not surprising then, that neural networks
also show exciting promise in the fields of
visual and other kinds of pattern recognition,
as well as speech.

A Novel Frequency Divider for
TV Sync Generators
An economical, clticient and high-performance
frequency divider circuit for use in new RCA
color TV broadcast equipment has been de-
veloped. The circuit is a monostable multivi-
brator with a unique ability to adjust its timing
period to be proportional to the period of the
input trigger pulses. The circuit uses only two
transistors, and it has the ability to divide an
input frequency by a constant for a wide range
of input frequencies. It is also quite immune
to power supply variations and requires no
precision capacitors. The circuit requires no
externally-applied AFC voltage for regulating
the timing period, such as would be required
in this application with an ordinary mono-
stable divider.
The two periods of a cycle of operation, as
shown in the waveforms, are first, "measure,"
and then a "recover." When the circuit is in
the rest or "stable"* stale, 01 is saturated and
02 is turned off. Once triggered by an input
pulse, Q2 is placed in a constant current con-
ducting mode which causes C2 to discharge at
an essentially constant rate. This action is ter-
minated by the next succeeding pulse which
leaves the voltage across C2 at a value directly
related to the time period between the pulses.
The capacitor voltage is thus a measure of the
pulse repetition interval. The second pulse,
which terminates the measure period, also
causes regenerative circuit action which turns
02 off. Succeeding input pulses cause no fur-
ther circuit action until C2 charges (through
R4) to the point where diode CR2 can again
conduct. The first trigger pulse following the
"recover" period causes the cycle to reoccur.
A constant frequency division ratio is main-
tained over a wider input frequency range than
was previously possible as a result of the self-
adjusting timing feature. A new color sync
generator, which uses this type of circuit in
the frequency divider that relates the horizontal
and vertical scanning frequencies, is proving
to be highly successful. A 525:1 divider chain
is used which requires only 8 transistors. If a
chain of binary stages were used, 22 transistors
would be required. Also, a modified form of
this circuit is used to relate the horizontal
scanning frequency to the color TV subcarricr
frequency.

Frequency Dividers for TV Sync Generators," 1965

Transistorized Portable "Victrolas"
Although transistors have previously enjoyed
widespread use in portable receivers and mili-
tary communication equipment, only recently
have solid-stale devices made any significant
penetration into line operated home instru-
ment equipment. Advancing device technology
has made transistor circuitry cost competitive
with equivalent lube circuitry, while providing
improved reliability, instant warm-up, lighter
weight and cooler operation.
In low-cost phonographs using single stage
tube amplifiers, high-output pickups arc re-
quired. Such pickups arc quite stiff mechani-
cally, require a high stylus force, and thus
track marginally. These low-cost amplifiers
ordinarily use "transformerless" power sup-
plies with the attendant design problems of
minimizing hum and shock hazards.
RCA Victor's new transistorized portable
phonographs use multistage DC-coupled cir-
cuits providing ample power gain for use with
pickups of higher compliance and smoother
frequency response. Record wear and tracking
are thereby improved. The higher efficiency of
the output stage and the elimination of the
heater-power requirement result in a cooler
amplifier—and make possible the use of a
secondary winding on the phonograph motor
for the power supply. The resulting isolation
eliminates the shock hazard and makes pos-
sible the application of conventional ground-
ing techniques.
To minimize costs and improve reliability,
this amplifier has been designed to be built on
a printed circuit board. The need for a separate
supporting chassis has been eliminated by
mounting the printed board under the turn-
table on the record changer molorboard, al-
lowing the output chokes and filter capacitor
to extend through the motorboard. The motor-
board serves both as a heat sink and mounting
for the output transistors. Volume and tone
controls are mounted on the motorboard, and
all inter-connecting cables and wiring are in-
tegral with the record changer assembly.

STEPHEN STANLEY ATTWOOD
1897 -1965
Stephen S. Atlwood lixied fully for the University of
Michigan. He was associated with the University as a
student and teacher for more than fifty years. As his
achievements mounted, he became a dynamic part of the
University to both students and fellow faculty members.
He had a solid faith in the educational system under him,
It is with profound sadness that we acknowledge the
death of Dean Stephen Stanley Attwood of the College
of Engineering on June the eighth. At their May meeting
the Regents regretfully granted the Dean's request to be
relieved of his University responsibilities following his
sixty-eighth birthday on May 29.
Dean Attwood came to Ann Arbor as a student from
his native Cleveland in 1914, earned a baccalaureate in
mechanical engineering in course, and returned to the
University in 1920 to study further and to teach electrical
engineering. Earning a Master of Science degree in 1923,
he rose through the several ranks to a professorship in
1937.
During those years he became an increasingly valuable
consultant to the electrical industry, and completed the
first edition of a text which has served generations of
students. His own special interest was in applying electro-
magnetic field theory to electrical problems. In the Second
World War, he directed research on radio-wave propaga-
tion, and thereafter prepared the monumental official
report on the work accomplished. At the University once
more, he resumed his own highly creative research and
and his dedication was a tribute to his school and his
profession.
On June S, 1965, Dean Attwood passed away, just
twenty-two days before his formal retirement was to
begin. The following memoir was adopted by the Regents
of the University:
his sound and seminal teaching.
Appointed chairman of his Department in 1953 and
dean of his College five years later, he brought to his
executive tluties the same zeal, industry, and rigor of
judgment which he had displayed as teacher and as
engineer. Uniting firm management with an infectious
devotion to his school and his profession, he sustained
and strengthened the College of Engineering in a time of
rapid curriculum change and strenuous competition for
personnel. His guidance in developing the novel pro-
grams in astronautical and atomic engineering was par-
ticularly fruitful. In his personal associations, he was ever
genial, kindly, and gracious.
The Regents of the University are sensible of the grief
his colleagues feel when they contemplate his passing, and
of their deep sense of gratitude to him for his leadership.
On behalf of the entire University community, thev
would now pay tribute to his personal worth and his
many accomplishments, and would mourn the cutting off
of his life short of its mead of retirement and rest. To
Mrs. Attwood and his children, they tender their deepest
and most heartfelt sympathy.
THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


DEAN OF THE
COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING
Just a few days before classes began this fall, Professor
Gordon J. Van Wylen was named Dean of the University
of Michigan College of Engineering. He succeeds the late
Stephen S. Attwood, who died June 8, 1965, three weeks
before his scheduled retirement.
Dr. Van Wylen was formerly chairman of the Univer-
sity's Department of Mechanical Engineering. He as-
sumed that position just seven years after joining the
University faculty as an assistant professor in 1951. Prior
to that, Dr. Van Wylen served as an industrial engineer
for the E. 1. du Pont Company, 1942; as an instructor at
Pennsylvania State College, 1946-48; and as a research
assistant at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
1950-51. During World War 11, he served as an officer
on submarine duty with the LT. S. Navy in the Southwest
Pacific, 1943-46.
Since joining the faculty, Dr. Van Wylen has been ac-
tive both as a researcher at the University and as a con-
sultant to industry and government. He has participated
in several research projects supported by the Michigan
Memorial Phoenix Project, the National Science Founda-
tion, and the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-
tration, among others. Formerly, he was a consultant to
the General Motors Research Institute and to the Cryo-
genic Engineering Laboratory of the National Bureau of
Standards. At the present time Dr. Van Wylen is con-
sultant to the Office of Institutional Programs of the
National Science Foundation.
In announcing the appointment of Professor Van
Wvlen, Executive Vice-President Marvin Niehuss said:
GORDON J. VAN WYLEN
"Dr. Van Wylen has demonstrated genuine leadership as
a department chairman. He is outstanding both as a
scholar and a teacher, and he has the enthusiastic en-
dorsement of his associates in the College of Engineering.
"He has a keen understanding of the need for a strong
relationship between the industrial community of Mich-
igan and the education of future engineers and scientists.
"We are confident," Niehuss said, "that the College of
Engineering will receive distinguished leadership from
him."
In an attempt to get a truly close picture of our new
Dean, Managing Editor Richard Donnelly interviewed
Dr. Van Wylen during his first few weeks in office. His
comments follow.
In answer to a question about the central purpose of
the Dean's job in the engineering college, Dr. Van Wylen
was quick to state that the Dean has two primary areas
of responsibility to his faculty and student body: service
and leadership. The Dean's office, he believes, should
serve the faculty by enabling them to carry on their
teaching and their research effectively. Similarly, the
Dean's office should serve students by enabling them to
elfectively acquire the knowledge the faculty try to impart
and to actively participate in faculty research efforts.
Closely related to service is the Dean's second major
area of responsibility: leadership. The essence of the
Dean's leadership, as Dr. Van Wylen sees it, is his cre-
ation of a framework for many kinds of interactions, both
within the University and between the University and
OCTOBER 1965
15


the economic community. Most notably, there must be
the obvious interactions within the college; i.e. inter-
actions between students and faculty, and interactions
between the faculties of the various engineering college
departments. No less important are the close ties neces-
sary between faculty members engaged in research and
teaching in the pure sciences and the engineering college
faculty engaged in research and teaching in the applica-
tion of science. Finally, there is a much needed and pres-
ently limited interaction between members of the aca-
demic community and members of the industrial com-
munity. The Dean's effectiveness as a leader lies in his
ability to provide several points of contact at which inter-
actions of the above kinds may take place.
Dr. Van Wylen emphasized that one of his most im-
portant functions as Dean would be to listen a great
deal—to both students and faculty. Only in this way does
he feel that he can provide the leadership required of
him. (This should be welcome news for students who
feel that their education at the University of Michigan
is not all that it could be. It should be especially welcome
news for those students who have some suggestions for
improving their engineering education.)
Dean Van Wylen did not propose any specific forum
for interaction between the student body and the college
administration. However, he did indicate a direction
that proposals in the near future may follow. Dr. Van
Wylen believes that student opinion is best sampled, and
most effectively reacted to first at the department level,
and then at the college level. He foresees the formation of
committees within the various departments, consisting of
undergraduate and graduate students and faculty mem-
bers. Whether the student representatives would be
appointed by the faculty or elected by their classmates
is a matter for future decision.
Some questions must, of course, be left for the faculty
to answer. Others, however, can and should be considered
by students, Dr. Van Wylen believes. Such matters as the
effectiveness of teaching, the value of laboratory exercises,
the availability of counseling, and the quality of math,
physics and chemistry courses may well be discussed in
student-faculty committees at the department level.
In response to a question about the present position
of the college, Dr. Van Wylen said that he saw no glaring
deficiencies in the undergraduate program as it now
exists. He noted that the college at present is comprised
of strong and relatively independent tlepartments. Once
again he stressed that his function as Dean would be to
provide opportunity for interplay between the depart-
ments. Specifically relating to this matter of interplay,
Dr. Van Wylen feels that one of the cjuestions the college
will wish to ask itself in the near future is this: Are there
too many different undergraduate degree programs?
Dr. Van Wylen mentioned briefly one of the most
immediate problems the engineering college must face:
the move of engineering facilities to North Campus.
Professor Donald L. Katz of the Department of Chemical
Engineering has agreed to direct a study of the move to
North Campus. By next spring, Dr. Katz and his com-
mittee will have a site plan and will have formulated
the general concept and requirements for the engineering
college complex on North Campus.
Dr. Van Wylen talked for a short time on his phi-
losophy of engineering education. Industry, he feels, is
looking for the engineer who has made some accomplish-
ments during his college years. Industry is looking for the
engineer whose broad background enables him to apply
himself to many different kinds of problems—economic
and administrative as well as engineering problems. Dr.
Van Wylen noted that the engineer operates in a large
corporation, in a social organization really. In this he
differs from the doctor or lawyer, who works quite inde-
pendently. Thus, the engineer must be able to get along
with other people; he must be able to communicate
effectively and to debate articulately. The engineer's
education, then, must prepare him to do all these things.
In line with a general recognition of the above as
goals of an engineering education, Dr. Van Wylen cites
some current trends in engineering education in the
United States. The American Society of Engineering Edu-
cation has advocated the following: 1) a unified under-
graduate program in engineering, giving only a single
degree; and 2) a reduction in the number of credit hours
required for the first degree. Dr. Van Wylen thinks that
the college must take a close look at these trends and ask
whether they are right for engineering at the University
of Michigan.
In order to answer that question, he feels that the
college must author a clear statement of its objectives and
then abide by that statement. He cautions against a
"jump on the bandwagon" attitude for the University
in dealing with new trends in engineering education.
True leadership is not exhibited by a college which is
blown about by every little wind of change, he believes.
Dean Van Wylen's answer to one final question reveals
as much about his sincere devotion to engineering as
anything yet written. The final question: Do you intend
to keep your hand in the science part of engineering
now that your position requires you to be away from
the classroom and laboratory? Dr. Van Wylen's answer
was an emphatic "Yes!" To be an effective administrator,
he believes, one must be up-to-date and technically alive.
In order to help him remain alive, Dr. Van Wylen has
expressed to his colleagues in the Department of Me-
chanical Engineering a willingness to lecture their classes
in thermodynamics whenever they are absent. He does
confess that he wants to try teaching from his newh-
revised book. But one senses more than that slightly
selfish motive in his desire. One senses the kind of clevo
tion to the science that undergraduates can only hope
some day to have.

of Jim Brown's education
Because he joined Western Electric
Jim Brown, Northwestern University, '62, came with
Western Electric because he had heard about the Com-
pany's concern for the continued development of its
engineers after college graduation.
Jim has his degree in industrial engineering and is
continuing to learn and grow in professional stature
through Western Electric's Graduate Engineering
Training Program. The objectives and educational phi-
losophy of this Program are in the best of academic
traditions, designed for both experienced and new
engineers.
Like other Western Electric engineers, Jim started
out in this Program with a six-week course to help in
the transition from the classroom to industry. Since
then, Jim Brown has continued to take courses that
will help him keep up with the newest engineering
techniques in communications.
This training, together with formal college engi-
neering studies, has given Jim the ability to develop
his talents to the fullest extent. His present responsi-
bilities include the solution of engineering problems
in the manufacture of moly-permalloy core rings, a
component used to improve the quality of voice
transmission.

tions for the Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowships in engineering,
physics, or mathematics are now available for the academic year
beginning in 1966.
Trie program offers the qualified candidate the opportunity for
study and research at an outstanding university plus practical
and rewarding industrial summer experience at a Hughes facility.
Each Doctoral Fellowship includes tuition, books and thesis prep-
aration expenses, plus a stipend ranging from $2,200 to $3,100,
depending upon the number of the candidate's dependents. Full
salary is paid the Fellow during his summer work at Hughes.
Fellowships are awarded to outstanding students of promise.
A master's degree, or equivalent graduate work is required be-
fore beginning the Doctoral Fellowship Program.
HUGHES MASTERS FELLOWSHIPS. The Hughes Masters
Fellowship Program offers rewarding opportunities leading to the
master's degree. More than 100 new awards are available for
1966-67 to qualified applicants who possess a baccalaureate
degree in engineering, physics or mathematics. Tuition, books
and other academic expenses are paid by the Company. A sig-
nificant advantage offered by the Work-Study Program is the
opportunity to acquire professional experience while pursuing
the degree. Selected Fellows are allowed to work in several
different job assignments during the Fellowship period. This
experience often helps the Fellow to decide on his field of con-
centration and type of work. Fellows who associate with a
Company facility in the Los Angeles area usually attend the
University of Southern California, or the University of California,
Los Angeles.
A major economic advantage is that Fellows earn full salary
during the summers and work 24 hours per week during the
academic year. The resulting salary, added to the annual stipend
of $500 to $850 enables the typical Fellow to enjoy an income
in excess of $6,000 per year. Fellows' earnings increase com-
mensurate with their professional growth. In addition to these
Hughes
Fellowship
Programs
benefits, the Program enables the Fellow to affiliate with a rec-
ognized leader in electronics and aerospace engineering. Fel-
lows are eligible for regular Company benefits.
Work assignments at Hughes are matched closely to the Fellow's
interests. The primary emphasis at Hughes is research and de-
velopment in the field of electronics. Company projects include
space technology, including stability and trajectory analysis,
energy conversion, and structural design and analysis —com-
puter and reliability technology, circuit and information theory,
plasma electronics, microminiaturization, and human factor
analysis — research, development and product design on such
devices as parametric amplifiers, masers, lasers, microwave
tubes, antenna arrays, electron-tube and solid-state displays, and
components — design, analysis, integration and testing of space
and airborne missile and vehicle systems, infrared search and
tracking systems, radar systems, communication systems, un-
dersea warfare systems, and computer, data processing, and
display systems — theoretical and experimental work in atomic,
solid-state and plasma physics.
The classified nature of work at Hughes makes American citi-
zenship and eligibility for security clearance a requirement.
Most of the awards are Work-Study, however, a small number of
Full-Study Fellowships are awarded which permit the Fellow to
attend a university on a full-time basis during the academic year.
Upon completion of the Masters Program, Fellows are eligible
to apply for a Hughes Doctoral Fellowship and are given special
consideration for these awards.
Closing date for all applications: February 1, 1966. (Early
application is advisable, and all supporting references and tran-
scripts should be postmarked not later than February 1, 1966.)

By solving problems in astronautics, U.S. Air Force
scientists expand man's knowledge of the universe. Lt. Howard McKinley, M.A.,
tells about research careers on the Aerospace Team.
(Lt. McKinley holds degrees in elec-

the Georgia Institute of Technology and
the Armed Forces Institute of Tech-
nology. He received the 1963 Air Force
Research &amp; Development Award for his
work with inertial guidance compo-
nents. Here he answers some frequently-
asked questions about the place of
college-trained men and women in the
U.S. Air Force.)
Is Air Force research really
advanced, compared to what
others are doing?
It certainly is. As a matter of fact, much
of the work being done right now in uni-
versities and industry had its beginnings
in Air Force research and development
projects. After all, when you're involved
in the development of guidance systems
for space vehicles—a current Air Force
project in America's space program —
you're working on the frontiers of
knowledge.
What areas do Air Force scientists
get involved in?
Practically any you can name. Of course
the principal aim of Air Force research
is to expand our aerospace capability.
But in carrying out this general purpose,
individual projects explore an extremely
wide range of topics. "Side effects" of
Air Force research are often as impor-
tant, scientifically, as the main thrust.
How important is the work a recent
graduate can expect to do?
It's just as important and exciting as his
own knowledge and skill can make it.
From my own experience, I can say
that right from the start I was doing
vital, absorbing research. That's one of
the things that's so good about an Air
Force career—it gives young people the
chance to do meaningful work in the
areas that really interest them.
What non-scientific jobs does the
Air Force offer?
Of course the Air Force has a continu-
ing need for rated officers—pilots and
navigators. There are also many varied
and challenging administrative-manage-
rial positions. Remember, the Air Force
is a vast and complex organization. It
takes a great many different kinds of
people to keep it running. But there are
two uniform criteria: you've got to be
intelligent, and you've got to be willing
to work hard.
What sort of future do I have
in the Air Force?
Just as big as you want to make it. In
the Air Force, talent has a way of com-
ing to the top. It has to be that way, if
we're going to have the best people in
the right places, keeping America strong
and free.
What's the best way to start
an Air Force career?
An excellent way—the way I started—is
through Air Force Officer Training
School. OTS is a three-month course,
given at Lackland Air Force Base, near
San Antonio, Texas, that's open to both
men and women. You can apply when
you're within 210 days of graduation, or
after you've received your degree.
How long will I be committed
to serve?
Four years from the time you graduate
from OTS and receive your commis-
sion. If you go on to pilot or navigator
training, the four years starts when
you're awarded your wings.
Are there other ways to become
an Air Force officer?
There's Air Force ROTC, active at
many colleges and universities, and the
Air Force Academy, where admission
is by examination and Congressional
appointment. If you'd like more infor-
mation on any Air Force program, you
can get it from the Professor of Aero-
space Studies (if there's one on your
campus) or from an Air Force recruiter.

FLIGHT
SYSTEMS
by RITA SARNO
Some time before the close of this
decade, probably late in the year 1969,
the United States will attempt for the
first time to land a manned space
vehicle on our only natural satellite,
the Moon. Already underway, this
program has been christened "Project
Apollo" in the hope that it will shed
as much light on the nature of our
nearest celestial neighbor as another
Apollo was said to have shed upon the
nature of man and his world.
The mission of the astronauts who
will take part in the Apollo flight will
be three-fold. They will: 1) test new
materials, devices, and techniques em-
ployed in the project; 2) explore and
assimilate data on the lunar environ-
ment; and 3) determine the feasibility
of gathering astronomical data un-
obtainable from earth. While on the
moon, the safety of these men will
hinge upon the effectiveness of their
preparatory training and the reli-
ability of the devices designed to cre-
ate the artificial earth-type environ-
ment in which they will live. However,
during the flight from the earth to the
moon, and again during the return to
earth from the moon, the lives of the
members of the Apollo crew and the
success of their mission will depend
upon the performance of the space-
craft's inertial guidance system.
This system, the "brains" of the
Apollo spacecraft, is the result of
countless man-hours expended by
scientists and engineers of various
corporations and research institutions
throughout the nation. The system is
one of the most ingenious technolog-
ical advancements since the develop-
ment of radar. Its functions, and the
manner in which it accomplishes
them, are far too complex and diverse
to allow a comprehensive description
in an article of this length. What fol-
lows is an attempt to give the reader
a slightly more than superficial fa-
miliarity with this most remarkable
example of the fertility of the hu-
man mind.
The Apollo Guidance System per-
forms five major functions: 1) the
periodical establishment of an inertial
reference used for measurements and
computations; 2) alignment of iner-
tial measurements by precise optical
measurements; 3) calculation of the
position and velocity of the spacecraft
by optical or inertial techniques; 4)
generation of altitude control and
thrust commands to maintain the
spacecraft on a satisfactory trajectory;
and 5) the display of data pertinent
TRA1.SEARTH ICjCOUBSZ
NAVIGATION
to the guidance problem at hand.
With the exception of function num-
ber five, the Apollo Guidance System
operates according to a system of feed-
back and control which brings into
play three major subsystems—the iner-
tial, the optical, and the computer.
The first of these, the inertial sub-
system, consists of a measurement unit
mounted on a navigation base, three
coupling display units along with por-
tions of the power servo assembly, and
the display and control panel. The
function of this subsystem is three-fold
and includes: 1) measurement of
vehicle velocity; 2) measurement of
vehicle attitude; and, 3) assistance in
generating steering commands. This
"inertial" system, as its name indi-
cates, functions in such a manner as
to be totally independent of any direc-
tion from earth. Measurements are
made, not relative to earth, but rather
to the preprogrammed orientation of
the ship's gyros. Once launched, this
system is "on its own." It will not be
influenced by any earth-based mission
control system until the return of the
ship to earth.
The optical subsystem, the "eyes"
of the Apollo spacecraft, consists of
the optical assembly mounted on a
navigation base, two coupling display
units, and portions of the power-servo
assembly and display and control
panels. Its job is to supply angular
measurements of celestial objects to
the computer for the purpose of cal-
culating the spacecraft's position in
space. It also supplies similar measure-
ments to the computer to align the
inertial measurement unit (IMU)
stable member, which acts as a stand-
ard in determining the vehicle's ori-
entation in space. The optical system
combines the capabilities of a star-
tracker and a horizon sensor to ac-

complish its task, thus navigating the
Apollo craft with a fixed landmark—
the earth—and a variable reference—
the star line-of-sight. The star-tracker
is an electro-optical device used to
maintain an automatic lock-on after
manual acquisition of a navigational
star. It consists of optical elements,
two vibrating tuning fork scanning
mechanisms and the supporting elec-
tronics. Radiated light from a star is
focused at the fork by an objective
lens. The scanners modulate the star-
light and provide pulses of this light
to a photomultiplier tube. The photo-
multiplier tube provides signals to
the pre-amplifier, and an electrical
signal from the pre-amplifier is fed to
four narrow-band amplifiers. The out-
put of each is detected, and the sum
of the four signals is used for auto
matic gain control and star presence
indication.
The horizon sensor is also an elec-
tro-optical device which determines
the earth's horizon by detecting peak
atmosphere illumination. The earth's
"limb" can thus be used as a naviga-
tional reference in space just as the
limb of the sun is used in shipboard
navigation. The horizon sensor con-
sists of optical elements, a blue optical
filter, one vibrating fork scanning
mechanism, and supporting electronic
equipment.
The third subassembly in the
Apollo Guidance System, the com-
puter, is itself a remarkable engineer-
ing achievement. It consists of the
Apollo guidance computer and por-
tions of the display and control panels.
The functions of this system are: 1)
to calculate steering signals and en-
gine firings necessary to keep the
vehicle on a satisfactory trajectory;
2) to position the IMU stable mem-
ber to a definite coordinate system
determined by precise optical meas-
urements; 3) to conduct limited mal-
function isolation of the guidance
svstem by monitoring the level and
rate of systems signals; and 4) to sup-
ply pertinent spacecraft condition in-
formation to the display and control
panel.
These three subassemblies—inertial,
optical, and computer—will aid the
astronauts in determining the course
of the vehicle during the critical
periods of earth and lunar orbit, as
well as during the translunar and
transearth portions of the flight.
In any system of the complexity of
the Apollo guidance system, close
tolerances, as well as a demand for
extraordinarily high reliability neces-
sitate the establishment of a stringent
program of quality and reliability con-
trol. In the pursuit of this objective,
the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) in coopera-
tion with the holders of NASA con-
tracts, has set up an extensive system
of controls on all aspects of the Apollo
program. This system is designed to
aid the contractor in fulfilling the re-
quirements outlined in his contract.
In addition, it enables the government
to maintain uniformity in the speci-
fications it calls for in its many enter-
prises connected with space explora-
tion.
Before its acceptance by NASA,
each component of the Apollo guid-
ance system is subjected to repeated
tests and inspections to insure that
only parts of the highest quality are
at last incorporated into the flight
system. The tests are conducted only
by inspectors certified by NASA. Parts
falling short of the NASA require-
ments are submitted to a material re-
view board to determine whether their
irregularities are sufficient to prevent
their being used.
The reasons for the stringent con-
trol exercised by NASA are obvious.
First, the complexity and high cost
of all NASA systems results in a lower
density of test launchings than in any
other government program. AH com-
ponents must work the first time.
Second, manned space flights neces-
sitate attention to a host of details
(the foremost of which is the safety
of the Apollo crew) which other pro-
grams involving rockets and the like
are not required to consider. Finally,
astronomical considerations (align-
ment of celestial bodies, etc.) as well as
national prestige necessitate strict ad-
herence to the launch schedule. No
delays in this respect can be toler-
ated, and all NASA contracts include
an incentive clause according to
which the contractor will be rewarded
for meeting his contract, and penal-
ized if his product is responsible for
delaying a launch.
In the specific case of the Apollo
guidance system, the effects of a sys-
tem failure will be fully felt only
after the launch has taken place and
the vehicle is on its way toward its
objective. As a result, both NASA and
the contractors involved have pro-
vided for a particularly exacting test
program designed to seek out possible
malfunction before it can affect the
performance of a larger unit. After
being subjected to these tests-
environmental, mechanical, dimen-
sional, electrical, and optical—the re-
liability of each component is such
that the entire system has a reliability
which is as close to unity as possible.
This is as it must be, for the oppor-
tunities to abort an Apollo flight will
not be nearly so plentiful as in past
flights.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


OF
75 YEARS AGO
This article appeared in the 1890
Michigan Technic. The editors felt
that those readers who complain about
inadequate laboratories would be in-
terested in seeing what their fore-
lathers had to work with. In the near
future more information will appear
in the Technic on labs of yesteryear.
The Engineering Laboratory com-
prises the Mechanical Laboratory, the
Iron Room, the Wood Room, the
Forge Room, the Foundry, a Drafting
Room, an Engine Room, a Wash
Room, and Store Rooms.
The object of this laboratory is to
afford opportunities for original in-
vestigations, to make tests of various
kinds, to give instruction on the meth-
ods of conducting tests, and to instruct
in the practical application of tools
and materials to engineering purposes.
The present equipment of the vari-
ous departments is as follows:
Mechanical Laboratory — This
laboratory contains a 25 H. P. Lansing
high speed engine fitted with an auto-
matic shaft governor, also a throttling
governor arranged for experimental
work; a 50 H. P. Reynolds corliss en-
gine which furnishes power to entire
laboratory, is also arranged for test-
ing. Steam is furnished from a battery
of boilers in a separate building; these
boilers may, when desired, be used for
testing. A 40 H. P. Wheeler surface
condenser is connected with both en-
gines, and is so arranged as to con-
dense the steam from the engines run-
ning either non-condensing or con-
densing: a direct acting Blake air-
pump exhausts the condenser when
the engines are operated as con-
densing engines.
A Gordon duplex, a Blake, and a
Marsh, boiler feed pump are con-
nected with the condenser, and are
arranged for conducting tests to de-
termine their efficiencies. A Worthing-
ton duplex pump, an Aguapult pump
and several forms of injectors are
available for the same purpose. A cis-
tern of 150 bbls. capacity just outside
the laboratory, and an iron tank of
100 bbls. capacity placed in a tower
at an elevation of 80 feet, serve to
complete the arrangements for pump
and injectors sets. A Rider compres-
sion hot air engine, and an Otto gas
engine (in adjoining laboratory), are
also available for experimental work.
A complete Westinghouse air brake,
including pump, is mounted for con-
venient operation, and affords oppor-
tunity for experiments with com-
pressed air. Sturtevant and Buffalo
blowers afford further opportunities
for work on air.
An 18-inch Pelton and a 12-inch
Tuerk water motor, a small turbine
and hydraulic elevators serve for ex-
periments on hydraulic machinery.
An Ingersoll rock drill, fitted with
indicator attachments, may be tested
with steam.
The laboratory is provided with a
10 H. P. Webber transmitting dyna-
mometer, a 25 H. P. absorbing dy-
namometer, Prony brake and rope
brakes for the measurement of power.
Several forms of calorimeters, in-
cluding the Barrus superheating and
the Barrus universal calorimeters,
serve in determining the quality of
steam.
The laboratory possesses a pair each
of the Thompson, the Crosby, and the
Tabor indicators with a full comple-
ment of springs, pantographs, lazy
tongs and Brumbo pulleys, an Amsler
polar planimeter and two Coffin aver-
aging instruments, besides special
apparatus for testing indicator springs.
The laboratory is further equipped
with two dozen of Green's thermom-
eters, including three standards, ten
cased thermometers for steam and
water, besides a number by other
makers, also special thermometers and
pyrometers for measuring the tem-
perature of flue gases: one dozen pres-
sure gauges, including four standards
by different makers, five vacuum
gauges, two combination vacuum and
pressure gauges, and two Edson
recording gauges, one of which was
made to order for special work, a
standard square inch and several test
pumps; a Green barometer, an an-
eroid barometer, hygrometer, and two
anemometers; four platform scales of
from 200 to 2,000 lbs. capacity, two
of which are special with triple beams
and graduated to one fiftieth pounds,
several spring balances, and two U. S.
standard test weights; a tachometer,
two revolution counters and several
speed indicators; an Elliot apparatus
for analysis of flue gases; and an Alli-
ance pulley balancing machine.
In the near future there will be
provided a clock beating seconds with
electric attachment, chronographs for
determining speed variations, a Morin
and a cradle dynamometer, an open
mercury column, a boiler to carry 200
lbs. pressure for special work in steam
engineering, oil testing machines, and
a quantity of other apparatus for use
in special lines of investigation.
In addition to the laboratory equip-
ment the Knowles and the Gordon
pumping engines at the city water
works have been specially arranged
by the manufacturers for convenience
in making duty trials, and the engines
and boilers at the various mills and
factories in this and adjoining cities
are accessible for testing work.
Iron Room — The Iron Room con-
tains eight engine lathes ranging from
14-inch swing 5-foot bed to 30-inch
swing 23-foot bed, two speed lathes,
two planers, one shaj&gt;er, one drill
press, one boring mill, one universal
milling machine with gear cutting at-
tachment and full complement of mills
and cutters, two emery wheels, one
lathe grinding attachment, and grind-
stone, besides a number of vises and
a well equipped tool room.

Course — graduates of colleges and universities
from coast to coast.
What is the Loop Course? Since 1922, Bethlehem
has conducted this Course for training college
graduates for careers in Bethlehem's management.
Hundreds of men at all levels of Bethlehem man-
agement, including our Chairman, started their
careers as loopers.
The '65 Loop convened at our general offices in
Bethlehem, Pa., early in July. After five weeks of
thorough indoctrination, many of these men were
assigned to facilities throughout the country for
further brief training at the operations before
undertaking their first job assignments. Others,
such as sales and accounting trainees, may remain
at the general offices for some months before
being assigned.
Most Loopers Have Technical Degrees
Our primary need is for engineering and other
technical graduates. Such men have many fine
opportunities in all phases of steelmaking, as well
as in research, sales, mining, fabricated steel con-
struction, and shipbuilding. Also, both technical
and non-technical graduates are needed for other
important activities including accounting, sales,
purchasing, traffic, finance and law, industrial and
public relations, and general services.

Cooley Electronic Laboratory
researchers are shown
measuring the intermodula-
tion properties of a phase-
shift amplifier. This device,
which was developed at
CEL, utilizes a 9,000 Mc car-
rier for low-noise amplifica-
tion of signals in the 50-1 50
Mc band. A spectrum ana-
lyzer (left) is used to deter-
mine the magnitude and
frequency of the signals
generated in the intermodu-
lation process.
Student participation in teaching and research is
an ordinary element of graduate engineering educa-
tion at The University of Michigan. In recent years,
however, graduate student opportunities have ex-
panded rapidly. Teaching opportunities for gradu-
ate students have grown apace with undergraduate
student enrollments, and with the increased commit-
ment of faculty to guidance and teaching of graduate
students in both classroom and research environments.
Research opportunities for graduate students have
increased with the availability of government and
industrial support of academic research, aided by the
formation of group research structures within the
Department to accommodate the greatly expanded
research establishment. Participation in teaching and
research normally leads to a more rapid maturation of
the student's professional capacities.
Rapid changes in the basic sciences and technologies
relevant to the study and practice of Electrical En-
gineering have, of course, led to an evident need for
changes in curricula and teaching methods, and to
a need for more intensive exposure to problem defi-
nition and research technique.
Research is conducted in a number of departmental
research laboratories (e.g.. Radiation, Cooley Elec-
tronics, Electron Physics, Space Physics, Electro-Optics,
Radio Astronomy, Power Systems, Systems Engineer-
ing and Plasma Engineering) and in such technical
areas as information processing, computer, control
systems research, communication, physical electronics,
electromagnetic circuits, energy conversion, and a
variety of other disciplines.

WILL LASER RESEARCH BE
IN 1976

We have become quite important in the laser art. We
take much pleasure in the recognition accorded us for
contributions in materials and technology to super-
power infrared lasers for surgery. Our laser work will
be absorbing some of the physicists, electrical engineers,
and perhaps even mechanical engineers among those
who will be joining us from the campus in a few more
months. Others of these Class of 1966 engineers we
shall soon have working in technologies that they have
never even heard of before signing on.
Great! But before he does sign, the kind of chap who
particularly interests us is sharp enough to give a
thought to 1976. So do we. We fear technological ob-
solescence too, and his 1976 is our 1976.
In due time he will be surprised to learn about some
of the businesses we expect to be in then. As a thought-
ful person, he will be pleased to see how they relate to
the genuine needs (not just the frivolities) of the living
human beings in a peace-based society. In due time he
will be phased in when the fundamental research now
in progress is ready for the engineering that will make
it practical.
Don't expect to read all the details in an ad. Get in
touch with us. By a wise early choice of employer it is
still possible to enjoy the immediacy and the amenities
of a career in industry without a heavy price in personal
technological obsolescence.

Computer-controlled cars-every two minutes, day and night
In Pittsburgh the new Westinghouse
transit expressway shows how com-
muting can be made comfortable, con-
venient, fast and fun.
A two-mile pilot line has been built
to demonstrate the feasibility of this
new system. Lightweight, computer-
controlled cars can run every two
minutes, day and night. They operate
singly when passenger load is light,
form trains to handle heavy traffic.
Cars are fast and safe. They run si-
lently and smoothly on rubber tires
along their own expressway, free of
interfering traffic.
The Westinghouse transit express-
way costs less to install and operate
than a conventional subway or elevated.
If your city had one, you would
probably never find it necessary to
drive to work again.
You can be sure if it's Westinghouse

I couldn't answer. So I looked for a company that would give
me room for lateral, as well as upward, growth. One that was

I found what I wanted at Phillips.
Of course, Phillips is big . .. 19th largest among industrials.
But as I got talking to them, I realized this was, surprisingly,

ADVERTISING FOR
EDUCATORS
For four years undergraduates listen to industry tooting
its horn for engineers. Not once during those four years
do they hear even a peep from a second major employer
of engineers—engineering colleges.
For four years undergraduates listen to electronics
companies promise exciting careers in the "industry of
the computer age." Not once do they hear professors of
electrical engineering mention the excitement of teaching
and researching in electronics. For four years under-
graduates listen to steel companies promise satisfying
careers in the "industry which made America great."
Not once do they hear professors of metallurgical
engineering mention the satisfaction of teaching and
researching in metallurgy. For four years undergraduates
listen to aeronautics firms promise significant careers in
the "industry which expands the new American frontier."
Professors of aeronautical engineering say nothing about
the significance of their teaching. And chemical companies
promise challenging careers in the "industry which
assures better living for all Americans." Professors of
chemical engineering remain silent.
This behavior is especially hard to understand in
light of the current critical shortage of qualified
engineering faculty on most college campuses, since
the upshot of the whole situation is that many fine
students commit themselves to a career in industry before
they have even given teaching a cursory glance. This is
not to begrudge industry its fine engineers. Industrial
success often depends upon the technological achievements
of its engineers. And industrial success is a major factor
in keeping the United States strong. But so is academic
success a major factor in keeping America strong.
Why, then, don't engineering college faculty encourage
their students to explore teaching as a career? Perhaps
it is because they feel the students best qualified for
careers in teaching will attend graduate school just as
a matter of course. Then in graduate school, if the
students show the proper command of the subject, a
career in teaching can be suggested, they think.
This attitude assumes some kind of mystical pathway
leading unmistakably towards an eventual teaching
career for those students best qualified to teach. The
sad situation is, however, that some of the best qualified
undergraduates never even get started on the pathway;
and if they should happen to get started, they don't
find the way unmistakably marked at all.
For one thing, some undergraduates who would like
someday to teach and who may someday be well qualified to
teach, consider themselves incapable of teaching on the
basis of their undergraduate performance. A quick
glance at the records of some of the most distinguished
professors might well dispel that notion for them.
But they have no opportunity to glance at those records.
And no faculty member will encourage them, because
faculty members just don't talk about careers in teaching
with undergraduates. Sometimes, these students never
even attend graduate school.
An equally disheartening situation surrounds the
student whose performance as an undergraduate seems
to qualify him for a teaching career, but who finds his
engineering subjects unexciting and even boring. Such a
student may decide to attend law school or business
school, or may even change to a completely unrelated


healthy for both the student and for engineering. But
in a few cases the change most certainly would not have
taken place had the student been exposed to the more
enticing study of engineering on the frontiers of the
technology. With this exposure and the consequent
renewed interest in engineering, such a student might
some day become a first-rate professor. But he won't,
because no faculty member will tell him how enticing the
study of engineering is at the post-graduate level,
because faculty members just don't talk about careers in
teaching with undergraduates.
If engineering colleges are to maintain and improve
the quality of their faculties, they cannot afford to
lose these students. It is time, then, that engineering
colleges accepted what business long ago discovered:
advertising pays. Advertising can take several forms.
• Undergraduates have frequent opportunity to hear
from engineers in industry about their work, their
advancement, their company benefits.
Point 1: Professors of engineering should start talking to
their classes about their work, their achievements, the
benefits of their position as professional engineers.
• Undergraduates are flattered that companies will send
some of their most successful employees hundreds of
miles to interview students and invite them to apply for
employment.
Point 2: Engineering colleges should begin to interview
undergraduates who hold promise of some day becoming
able teachers and researchers—not to invite them to
apply for employment, but to discuss with them teaching
as a possible career.
• Undergraduates develop favorable or unfavorable
attitudes towards companies on the basis of their corporate
image, i.e. on the basis of the published material they
read, the people they meet, the photographs they are
shown, the facilities they visit.
Point 3: Engineering colleges should begin to work at
sprucing up their image as employers. Our college should
prepare some kind of short booklet describing a career
in teaching, with specific information about teaching
at the University of Michigan and general information
about leaching anywhere. Our college should pay
some attention to the display cases along the halls in
East Engineering. Some of them have not been
changed in four years, at least; some not in twenty,
probably. Our college should carefully consider its teachers
and its future teachers in designing the new complex on
the North Campus, in terms of office space, study areas,
lounges, and general liveability. One need only look at the
new Music School to see what an important contribution
to enjoyable study and effective teaching good
architecture can make.
Many a fine product has failed in the public market
l&gt;ecause people aren't aware it exists. Engineering faculties
surely believe that teaching is a fine profession. Teachers'
incomes now approach those of their colleagues in
industry. The intangible benefits in teaching perhaps
exceed those in industry. But still, some of the best
qualified students commit themselves to a career before
they have even considered leaching. With teachers in
short supply now, isn't a little bit of advertising a
legitimate and justifiable expense of engineering schools?

Not yet. But we're getting closer.
Behind this movement is a simple statistic with startling im-
plications for all of us — If you count all the scientists and
engineers since the beginning of recorded history, ninety
percent are alive today!
We are now in the midst of the result —an incredible explo-
sion of information from every corner of the globe. And
somewhere within this explosion will be the ultimate answers
to mankind's oldest, and newest problems.
The challenges are many. First, to understand the nature
of this giant intellectual force. Then, to find the best way to
collect it, classify it, store it... and distribute it appropriately
and instantly to the people who need it.
In this light, you might consider today's Xerox products early
and primitive steps along a difficult but fascinating path.
You'd be right. Yet, has anyone taken these steps before us?
Your degree in Engineering, Science, Business Administration
or Liberal Arts can qualify you for some intriguing openings
at Xerox, in fundamental and applied research, engineering,
manufacturing, marketing/sales, finance and administration.

Project POSSUM-(Polar Orbiting
Satellite System—University of Michi-
gan) was conceived, designed, written,
and presented by a group of 18 sen-
iors and 4 graduate students from the
Department of Aerospace Engineering
at the University of Michigan. The
entire project was completed in eight
weeks under the direction of Profes-
sor Wilbur C. Nelson, Department
Chairman. The final oral presentation
•was made to members of the faculty,
University research groups, and gov-
ernment and industrial representa-
tives.
The single requirement of the
course was that the class prepare a
detailed, comprehensive report on a
meteorological earth-satellite system.
A method of project organization was
suggested but the details were left to
the class. In addition, the class was re-
sponsible for the entire detailed de-
sign of the satellite — its structure,
weight, type of experimental equip-
ment, etc.
Indeed, the success of the eight-
week project ivas so startling that a
news release on the project was read
before Congress by Senator Phillip A.
Hart and entered in the Congressional
Record for June 30, 1965.
A great deal of the success of Proj-
ect POSSUM is clue to the organiza-
tion of the project. Five separate study
groups were organized. The first stud-
ied launch facilities, the second boost-
er systems, the third satellite systems,
the fourth communications and telem-
etry systems, and the fifth data proc-
essing systems. A sixth group was
charged with management of the Proj-
ect. On the basis of study by these six
groups two basic mission objectives
were agreed upon. The first objective
was to provide the fastest possible
means for obtaining current weather
information which could be used in
weather forecasting. The second ob-
jective was to collect information use-
ful for a scientific meteorological in-
vestigation of the atmosphere.
In spite of the vast number of
weather stations located all over the
earth, there are still several regions
from which very little meteoroligical
weather data is obtained. These in-
clude the Polar Regions and the large
expanses of ocean. Without weather
information from these regions it is
nearly impossible to predic t the weath-
er conditions over the populated
areas of the earth. POSSUM has been
designed to provide a low cost source
of this information. The data collected
can in turn be used by scientific and
educational institutions for their stud-
ies of the atmosphere.
Some of the topics of current scien-
tific interest are the shape and struc-
ture of clouds, characteristic dimen-
sions of clouds, wind structure,
characteristic wind velocity, the varia-
tion of cloud dimensions and wind
velocity with latitude, the effect of
islands such as Greenland on wind
and cloud structures, and the move-
ment and breakage of ice flows with
the seasons.
In order to accumulate sufficient
data, it was decided that the satellite
would need to remain in orbit for at
least a year. This requirement deter-
mines in part the minimum dimen-
sions for the orbit. A lower limit of
300 nautical miles was placed on the
orbit, and the upper limit was set by
the Van Allen and Starfish radiation
belts. For optimum resolution in the
pictures, the lowest possible orbit was
chosen. The final altitude was chosen
to be 300.6 nautical miles, at a veloc-
ity of 21,858 ft./sec, and with an or-
bital period of exactly 96 minutes.
In order to avoid over-healing of
the satellite at certain times in the
year due to its polar orbit, the POS-
SUM would be orientated such that
the earth-sun line would always lie in
the orbit plane. If this orbit were
exactly achieved, the satellite would
be eclipsed by the earth for some frac-
tion of its total orbital period dining
every satellite orbit. This would help
to minimize the temperature changes
of the equipment in the satellite. The
satellite would ac tually be in darkness
for 35.6 minutes and in the sun's
radiation for 60.4 minutes.
The orbital period of 96 minutes
was chosen for a definite purpose. As
stated in the POSSUM project report.
"Successive ascending nodes (points
on the equator where the satellite
crosses going in a northerly direction)
are separated by approximately 24 de-
grees. This results in the n-j-16th
orbit tracing over the exact same path
as the n-j-lst orbit, etc. Furthermore,
the time between the n-4- 1st and the
n-|-16th orbits is precisely 24 hours."
This means that a POSSUM in a cir-
cular orbit with an angle of inclina-
tion of 97.65 degrees, and with a pe-
riod of 96 minutes, would be directly
above the same point on earth at the

same time every clay. This is a very
desirable effect for both tracking and
meteorological purposes.
Although the POSSUM orbit plane
would have an eastward precession
rate, the satellite would pass over the
same point on the earth at the same
time every day. As the report states,
"This is explained by noting that in
one solar day (24 hours) , the earth
actually rotates through slightly more
than 360 degrees. The exact amount
of additional rotation is 0.986 degrees,
which is precisely the number of de-
grees that orbit plane precesses per
day." In such an orbit, the lifetime of
POSSUM would be approximately
ten years.
While orbital parameters were be-
ing calculated, the interior of the sat-
ellite was also being planned. To pro-
vide continuous visual coverage of
weather formations two systems were
incorporated in the satellite. One, the
Vidicon Camera System, VCS, is the
same as that used on the TIROS sat-
ellite and has a 1.0 n. mile subpoint
resolution at POSSUM'S altitude.
This gives a picture of a square 843
n. miles on a side. VCS takes its series
of pictures for 18.4 minutes. The
other system is a High Resolution In-
frared Radiometer, HRIR, for night-
time picture taking. This is essentially
the same system as that in Nimbus,
and it is comparable in photographic
ability to VCS.
The satellite is basically a right oc-
tagonal cylinder with a truncated oc-
tagonal right cone as a cap. This
shape provides maximum equipment
access and allows excellent packaging
arrangements for the equipment. The
packaging arrangements are designed
to transmit a minimum of booster
dynamic characteristics, which reduces
the chance for damage to the delicate
components during launch. This sim-
ple design enables a quite economical
construction of the satellite. To the
outside of the basic octagonal body
are attached the solar panels, as well as
two hinged solar paddles on opposite
sides of the satellite.
Materials used in the design and
construction of the satellite are of
great importance. One consideration
is weight. Various combinations of
aluminum and magnesium members
are used in the structure. The satellite
must be strong and have very good
heat transfer properties. In large meas-
ure the design of the satellite is dic-
tated by the environmental factors ex-
perienced during flight. These consist
of a maximum calculated thrust ac-
celeration of 17 g's, a lateral thrust
acceleration of 3 g's, a shock accelera-
tion load of 30 g's for approximately
11 milliseconds, and a maximum vi-
brational acceleration of 8 g's. Espe-
cially vulnerable to these stresses are
the framework joints. Special adhesive
films are used in these areas.
Other problems present themselves
after the launch, when flight stresses
have essentially disappeared. In order
for the VCS and HRIR photographic
systems to work, the satellite must be
stabilized in a earth-orientated posi-
tion. To produce this stabilization, a
yo-yo despin device and a magneticalb
anchored gravity gradient system are
incorporated in POSSUM.
The yo-yo device is designed to de-
spin the satellite from its initial rate
of 90 to 160 rpm (as it leaves the
Scout upper stage) to about 1 rpm.
This despinning takes place in a time
interval of less than one second! A
spin of 1 rpm is low enough to jjer-
mit the use of the gravity gradient
system to complete the stabilization
process. The gravity gradient system
was chosen over other methods of sta-
bilization, since it requires that one
axis of the spacecraft be directed to-
ward the center of mass of the earth
at all times. The VCS and HRIR are
positioned along this axis, so that they
always point toward the earth.
The behavior of the satellite in or-
bit is in part a function of the various
moments of inertia about it. These
moments can be adjusted by means of
weights on the ends of extendible rock.
A complete explanation of a system
of this sort is here paraphrased from
the POSSUM Project Report. A "Y
configuration in a single plane was
originally chosen for the system of ex-
tendible rods. However, upon recom-
mendation of General Electric, an in-
verted swept-back system was adopted
instead. Calculations showed that a
yaw resonance condition would result
if the original configuration were uti-
lized. Upon consideration of POS-
SUM'S particular requirements, Gen-
eral Electric recommended that one
rod be extended from the top of the
satellite and swept back 30 degrees
from the vertical in the orbit plane.
The remaining two rods would then
extend downward from the sides of
the satellite. Each rod would be swept
back 30 degrees for the vertical in the
orbit plane. In addition each rod
would make an angle of 45 degrees
with the orbit plane. General Electric
further recommended that the rod
lengths be approximately 50 ft. (See
Figure 1.)
For the purpose of damping satellite
oscillations while in orbit, the methods
of magnetic hysteresis, mechanical
hysteresis, viscous fluids, and eddy cur-
rents were considered. Each method
is dependent on relative motion be
tween two bodies for energy dissipa-

ellite. The other body is locked to an
outside force field and is called the
anchor.
The MAGS (Magnetically Anchored
Gravity System) was chosen. In this
method the magnetic field of the earth
is used to provide a damping refer-
ence. A magnetically anchored viscous
damper is used to damp out the satel-
lite oscillations. The damper consists
of two concentric spheres separated
by a viscous fluid. The inner sphere
contains a bar magnet which orients
itself according to the lines of mag-
netic flux of the earth's magnetic field.
This inner sphere also contains several
horseshoe magnets. The outer shell is
coated with a thin layer of Bismuth,
a diamagnetic material. The centering
force results from the repulsive action
of the horseshoe - magnet magnetic
field upon the diamagnetic material,
Bismuth, which serves as a medium
of suspension for the two spheres. Be-
tween the two spheres, then, there is
purely viscous shearing action and
absolutely no contact. The fluid be-
tween the spheres dissipates energy
with the rotation of the inner sphere,
which is locked to the earth's magnetic
field. Silicone oils are used as the vis-
cous fluid because of low temperature
sensitivity and long term temperature
stability. There is a bellows on the
damper to allow for expansion and
contraction of the viscous fluid under
changes in the environmental tem-
perature.
The previously mentioned gravity
gradient rods are the STEM (Storable
Tubular Extendible Member) devices,
manufactured by deHavilland Air-
craft of Canada, Ltd. The tubular ele-
ments are formed from a flat metal
strip, which is heat treated in a rolled,
tubular form. The resulting tube is
actually as strong as seamless tubing
anchored to structure
at this end
of the same diameter. The tubing is
stored in a strained, flattened form,
and is wound on a drum. It relieves
its strain by unwinding from the drum
and rolling into the more stable tub-
ular form, thereby extending itself.
This is a highly useful device for
POSSUM and for many other satel-
lites. (See Figure 2.)
While the stabilizing rods require
no power, the remaining systems of
the spacecraft do require electrical
power. In fact the satellite systems re-
quire continuous operation of a 28
volt power system. The power is sup-
plied by a bank of solar-cell storage
batteries. An array of N-on-P silicone
solar cells converts solar radiation to
electrical energy. The power from the
solar-cell bus is supplied to various
satellite subsystems. It is also used to
charge a secondary battery composed
of 40 nickel-cadmium storage cells.
Since the rate at which the batteries
are charged is a critical consideration
for long battery life, charge-rate con-
trollers are used to keep this rate at
permissible levels. This prevents bat-
tery failure due to excessive oxygen
liberation at the electrodes. Further-
more, a shunt limiter is included to
restrict the solar cell array to a desir-
able operating voltage. This shunt
limiter dissipates any excess energy-
produced in the solar cell array.
The solar cells cover all surfaces of
the satellite that receive solar radia-
tion. They are arranged in groups of
two parallel connected cells, called a
shingle. The entire unit consists of 85
shingles connected in series. (See
Figure 3.)
Although the solar panels are the
most vulnerable part of the satellite,
they are relatively safe from radiation
degradation, since the radiation belts
are a considerable distance away.

tion of the cells, 6 mil fuzed quart/
filters have been bonded to them.
These filters have blue reflective coat-
ings which reflect light energy of less
than 4000 A wave length, to which the
cells are insensitive. This then reduces
the amount of radiation that each cell
receives.
The POSSUM power supply is de-
signed for four basic modes of opera-
tion: Standby, VCS recording, HRIR
recording, and transmission. The
breakdown of these power require-
ments is given in Chart 1. All modes
of operation are not in effect at the
same time.
As mentioned earlier, thermal con-
trol is of prime concern. The delicate
nature of the POSSUM components
requires that suitable mounting sur-
face temperatures be maintained
throughout. The temperatures must
be between 40 and 100 degrees F.Thus
the hotter top of the satellite, upon
which the sun's rays fall directly is
isolated from the remainder of the
satellite. Furthermore, several conduc-
tive and radiative paths around the
structure are provided to minimize
temperature gradients. Thoughtful
placement of components helps to
limit temperature damage, and the
blue reflective coating on the solar
cells helps to keep the temperature of
the satellite low.
Another significant problem to be
solved was the link up of the com-

The VCS and HRIR photographic
information will be transmitted to the
two Command and Data Acquisition
(CDA) stations at Gilmore Creek,
Alaska, and at Wallops Island, Vir-
ginia. Not all of the data will be re-
layed to earth immediately, since at
several locations there are no (rack-
ing stations able to receive the data.
Therefore, a tape-recorder will be used
to store all collected information. The
playback of a tape containing the in-
formation collected during a single
orbit will require 2.83 minutes.
In all of the component systems
there is full redundancy, except for
the antenna. Every circuit in the
satellite is crosslinked to permit de-
tection of any failures that occur in
the system as a whole. In the correc-
tion of these failures, the POSSUM
telemetry system plays a vital role.
The purpose of the telemetry system,
according to the report, is to gather,
store, and transmit to the ground sta-
tions, the engineering information
needed to evaluate the detailed per-
formance, environmental conditions,
and general functioning of all the
spacecraft systems.
Again, this environmental data will
be gathered and stored continuously.
However, it can be transmitted to the
earth only at specific times. Thus, the
data collected during each orbit must
be identified with the specific location
over the earth at which it was col-
lected. This task is accomplished by
the clock system. The clock system has
three major purposes. First, it corre-
lates the data acquisition time with
the time location of the satellite in its
orbit. Second, it provides constant
frequency pulses to those satellite sub-
systems which must be frequency syn-
chronous. Third, it provides the lime
inputs to the programmed memory
storage unit for the execution of
stored commands.
A second important satellite unit is
the command system. It controls the
spacecraft sub-systems. It is closely
linked with the clock system, since it
must command tasks in orbit over re-
mote areas of the world, where no
ground command stations exist. Proj-
ect engineers had to decide what com-
mands would be given, in what order,
and at what time. A series of single
commands constitutes a task com-
mand. The satellite's first task com-
mand will be stored in a separate de-
structible-readout part of the memory
cell before launch. It will consist of
three commands, including despin-
ning, boom deployment, and solar-
paddle deployment. Once these task
commands have been read out of the
memory cell, this part of the cell will
be available for the storage of other
destructible commands.
Don Dieik (left), Project Manager, and Dun Chenoweth, Senior Croup Engineer, examine
a model of the POSSUM weather satellite.
With the satellite structure agreed
upon and the satellite fabricated, with
the sun-synchronous orbit achieved
and the command systems and data
gathering/transmitting systems func-
tioning, there remains the project of
processing all of the data that must
flow rapidly into the ground control
stations. The report states that the
problem of data processing involves, a
number of related problems. Among
them are the following. The ground
control station must have the ability
to track the satellite, receive and re-
cord its signals, analyze the received
signals, present the experimental and
satellite status data, send the experi-
mental data on to the users, interpret
the satellite's condition, and send it
commands for operation to be ex-
ecuted during the following orbits.
All of the information relayed from
the satellite will need to be completely
processed within the 96 minutes orbit
time. Otherwise, a pile-up of necessary
data would obviously occur. Further-
more, in order to be most useful, cloud
cover data in particular will need 10
be supplied to the NWSC quickly, so
that it can be used in weather evalua-
tion and forecasting.
The two Command and Data Ac-
quisition stations able to perform such
tasks for the POSSUM are those at Gil
more Creek, Alaska and at Wallops
Island, Virginia. The stations each
have 85 foot parabolic tracking an-
tennas with collimated command an-
tennas. They are equipped to reduce
the amplified signals from the satellite
to a usable data form and then to re-
transmit the data via a wide-band
cable to the POSSUM Technical Con
trol Center (PTCC) at Suitland.
Maryland. Here the data will be final
i/ed and command decisions made re-
garding future orbits. The data from
PTCC will then be relayed to the
National Weather Satellite Center
(NWSC), where the information will
be made available to many users. For-
tunately, much of this ground system
exists today, having been built for use
in the previous Nimbus and TOS
Projects.
One of the most imporant parts ol
the entire project is, of course, the
launch. The rocket must be designed
for the particular size and weight ol
the satellite. Also, the booster must Ik
reliable and inexpensive. For these
reasons the project engineers decided
on using the Advanced Scout rocket

made by Ling-Temco-Vought of Dal-
las, Texas. This launch vehicle will be
operative by the intended POSSUM
launch date: mid-October 1967. The
cost of the entire launch system is esti-
mated to be SI.3 million. This brings
the entire proposed cost for Project
POSSUM to $3,032,500.
Since the POSSUM will use Scout
as the launch vehicle, the launch site
was limited to three locations.Of these,
Point Arguello, California was chosen.
Point Arguello is a primary launch
site for satellites of polar orbits. Lo-
cated 165 miles northwest of Los
Angeles, the site is convenient for
transportation of both the personnel
and the materials that will be used for
POSSUM and the launch.
All personnel requirements and any
special equipment needed are planned
tor in advance, so as to minimize op-
erational delays of the launch. Follow-
ing the spacecraft's arrival at the
Western Test Range, Point Arguello,
it will be submitted to tests identical
to those made before shipment to the
test range. The use of existing test
equipment, previously designed for
pre-launch testing of TIROS and
Ximbus will decrease the cost of this
phase of the project.
Contributing to the overall excel-
lence of the project is the detail that
the planners went into beyond the
basic design and orbit calculations.
Typical of their attention to detail
is the complete break-down of the
launch facilities and tracking facili-
ties, and the circuit layout for the
launch-blockhouse area that was pre-
pared. Even control console location
and the arrangements of checkout and
control equipment panels in the block-
house are described. All the materials
supplied by the Aerospace Ground
Kquipment Group are listed, includ-
ing everything from spacecraft cover
to mechanic's tool kits.
The Project POSSUM enginers in-
clude in their report an outline of the
rountdown schedule, which takes into
account many complex launch factors.
Since POSSUM is to be launched into
a sun-synchronous orbit, the launch
may take place only during a very-
short period of time each day. The
launch time is exactly 582.55 seconds
before local solar noon. This is exactly
the time from launch to injection into
orbit. Due to the highly restrictive
launch window, there have been sev-
eral holds placed in the countdown
schedule. At a point seven hours prior
to launch, a complete go/no-go test
will be initiated. At the end of this
test, a conference committee composed
of a NASA test representative, a USAF
representative, the launch Control
Officer, a safety representative, and
representatives of the payload and
vehicle suppliers will evaluate the test
data and give the final word on the
launch. It is at this point that other
technicians take over. From this point
on the success of POSSUM is depend-
ent on the skill and knowledge that
gave rise to its development.
To be sure, Project POSSUM can
best be summed up as "A Poor Man's
Weather Satellite." In fact, these were
the very words of instruction given to
the project's student planners. But
this does not limit the project's effec-
tiveness. Indeed POSSUM would be
an invaluable addition to a world-
wide weather satellite system. A letter
from Holmes S. Moore, Head of the
Space Systems Branch—NWSC states,
"The Environmental Sc ience Services
Administration and NASA will con-
duct a cloud camera experiment on
an earth-synchronous satellite in 1966.
If this experiment is successful and
indicates that earth-synchronous satel-
lites can be used for cloud cover pic-
tures, a system such as POSSUM might
have application for polar coverage,
since the earth-synchronous satellite
is limited to ±50° latitude coverage."
POSSUM, a sun-synchronous satellite,
is designed to cover the remaining
latitudes from 55.5°N and 55.5° S to
the poles. Thus, complete global cov-
erage is possible thanks to POSSUM.
And POSSUM is possible thanks to a
group of University of Michigan en-
gineering students, their professors,
and members of the aerospace in-
dustry.

future is nearly as risky as forecasting
tomorrow's weather. How will we get
where we want to go ten or twent\
years from now? This question en-
compasses a number of considerations.
First, and apparently foremost, is our
increasing desire for speed. Old-timers
tell us to slow down and enjoy life,
hut we seem to enjoy it more at super
sonic speeds. Contrarily, we want
greater safety in our transportation.
And we evidently are becoming
spoiled because we continue to de-
mand greater comfort when traveling
Add a whole host of seemingly in-
solvable problems such as air pollu-
tion and traffic congestion, then re-
member that with today's engineering
technology almost anything is pos-
sible, and you are ready to paint a
rather hazy but interesting picture
of the transportation of the future.
This article deals with land trans-
portation. It is an effort to anticipate
some of the more practical develop
ments in this field over no more than
the next two decades. There will be
no attempt to dazzle the reader with
unrealistic but exciting transportation
fantasy. However, in this day and age.
with so much thrilling work being
done in science and engineering, these
predictions may prove to be on the
TRANSPORTATION
conservative side.
Land transportation can be divided
into two broad categories: trains and
automobiles. The train group includes
all vehicles which operate on a sta-
tionary track, e.g., subway, monorail,
as well as the conventional railroad
car used in urban and intercity travel.
These generally provide public trans-
portation and come under the head-
ing of mass transit. As we shall see.
this class of carriers very likely will
undergo some revolutionary changes
in track, car, and power and design
in the near future. The auto class in-

and a variety of other vehicles de-
signed for standard road use. Of these,
we will only be concerned with cars
and buses at this time. The future of
the automobile is difficult to predict,
for experts are by no means in agree-
ment on this matter. It appears that
the design of the auto itself may re-
main relatively unchanged and that
the major modifications could be in
the fields of street and highway con-
struction and certainly in traffic con-
trol.
In the history of passenger trans-
portation the relation between auto-
mobile and railroad has usually been
one of lopsided competition. Before
Henry Ford, the railroads had vir-
tually the entire market to themselves,
while a few rich eccentrics puttered
around in their horseless carriages.
The assembly line brought the auto-
mobile to the people and gradually
the car replaced the train as the major
passenger vehicle until today, as the
auto industry leads the nation toward
record economic heights, the railroads
find themselves deeper in the red with
each passenger they carry. Unless the
trains make drastic inprovements in
service, it is doubtful that they will
begin to compete strongly with the
auto in the next two decades. Eventu-
ally, of course, the trains' share of the
market will increase out of pure ne-
cessity. Our highways, especially those
in urban and suburban areas, are be-
coming saturated with automobiles,
and highway construction is unable
to keep pace with car production.
Even if the highways could be built
fast enough, this would prove a highly
unsatisfactory solution to the trans-
|M&gt;rtation problems of the future, for
it would result in an increasing mass
of concrete in and around our cities.
Soon, the situation would become in-
tolerable. Thus there will be a need
in the future for better coordination
between highway and railroad sys-
tems.
In order to gain a larger share of
the passenger market, the railroads
and subways of the future will develop
more fully these features of rail travel
which have inherent or potential ad-
vantages over automobile and bus
transportation. Even today, railroads
make much more efficient use of land
than highways do; it is estimated that
that "a single transit track can pro-
duce 40,000 passenger trips per hour,
whereas a single lane of highway uses
just as much land to produce but
3,000 passenger trips per hour.'" Al-
though, in actual practice today, the
gap is not nearly so large, in the fu-
ture with increased use of computers
to improve train spacing efficiency,
conventional trains will more nearly
approach this maximum. Further-
more, the new trains still in the de-
signing stage will have greater pas-
senger capacities and speeds which
will give railroads an even wider mar-
gin over the automobiles. Although
greater use of buses could lead the
highways to more economical land
use, it is doubtful that there will be
any appreciable improvement, espe-
cially on the jammed urban streets
and expressways.
The railroads have another poten-
tial advantage over the cars in terms
of speed capability. Although present
train speeds are not sufficient to draw
people off the highway, the trains of
the future will place a premium on
speed, especially for commuter service
and intercity travel in the megalopolis.
As we shall see in specific cases, the
trains of the future will attain speeds
of 100 mph and greater. The automo-
bile, on the other hand, though cap-
able of high velocity, is not likely to
improve much in this area in the next
two decades because of traffic and
safety conditions.
Tomorrow's trains will provide
greater safety relative to the automo-
bile. New developments in track de-
sign will reduce the possibility of de-
railment in spite of increased speeds
and computers should virtually elimi-
nate collisions by maintaining con-
stant surveillance of rail traffic con-
ditions. Also there will be improved
comfort on trains while the automo-
bile, which now holds a sizeable lead
on this score, won't make as substan-
tial gains.
The Trains of the Future
Now let us look at some of the
revolutionary trains which within ten
or twenty years may be streaking into
our daily life, just as the automobile
coughed and sputtered onto the Amer-
ican scene some fifty years ago. Some
of these new mass transit systems will
appear to be natural descendants of
today's trains; others will be extreme
departures from the usual image. All,
however, are feasible by our present
technological standards. Most of these
systems are being considered by the
Northeast Corridor Project, a federal
program established in 1962 to study
and plan a long range solution to the
chronic traffic jam which exists on a
nearly constant level between Boston
and Washington, D.C.* The rest of the
nation will watch carefully and learn
from the successes and failures of this
project, for although the Northeast
Corridor is the largest megalopolis,
there is every indication that other
regions around the nation will follow
its lead.
Probably one of the first develop-
ments will be a simple increase in
speed of the conventional passenger
train in the same manner as the new
Tokaido train of Japan.' This express,
running between Tokyo and Osaka,
at speetls between 125 and 150 mph,
is powered with conventional electric
motors designed by Westinghouse.
The high speed is made possible by
improved track and a more stable
roadbed. The track is made of heavy,
welded rail mounted on rubber blocks
and lies of pre-stressed concrete, and
there are no sharp curves on the line.
American companies feel that a sim-
ilar system could be built here and
that further research and development
could increase the speed to around

Two new short-range train systems
have already reached the experi-
mental stage. The more conventional
of these, being tried out on the Paris
Metro (subway) has the car running
on rubber tires along the same steel-
rail track presently used by steel-
wheeled vehicles.' Because they do not
have a flange, the rubber wheels are
Fig. 1 (Courtesy of Fortune Magazine)
not able to guide the car along the
track or switch the car from one track
to another. The guiding function is
accomplished by the use of special
horizontal rubber wheels. Switching
is achieved by conventional steel
wheels which are mounted on the
same axle as the main tires and
raise the car on a special track during
switching. The obvious advantages of
this type of subway car are reduced
noise and greater comfort. Further
benefits arc decreased vibratory stresses
which will permit lighter weight in
the cars and lower maintenance costs.
Also the rubber tires will give the
cars better grade-climbing ability
which will make routes through hilly
terrain more practical. The city of
Los Angeles is considering the use of
these cars and any new systems will no
doubt use tracks specially designed for
the new wheel structure instead of
conventional steel rails.
A train similar to the Metro but
more advanced was demonstrated last
summer in Pittsburgh.5 The tars have
a capacity of 28 persons and are linked
into trains which run at two-minute
intervals at speeds of 50 mph. De-
signed by Westinghouse. the cars re-
quire a special track with a center
guide rail (See Fig. 1). The support
tires and the horizontal guide tires
for steering are rubber and are lo-
cated on front and back. Powered elec-
trically, the train is controlled entirely
by computers. Designed lor short run
use, these trains could eventually be
integrated into a high-speed intercity
network.
A more spectacular proposal is that
of the General American Transporta-
tion Corp. which would combine the
benefits of the railroad and the toll-
way." Appropriately named RRollway,
this train would function as a sort of
land auto ferry service. The auto
driver would park his car crosswise on
the train and then retire to the com-
fort of a lounge located at one end of
the train car. In its present planning
stage the train would be comprised
of large cars, 128 feet long and 24
feet wide and would travel on 18 ft.-
gauge, conventional steel rails. Each
car wotdd carry twelve autos and
there would be a few all-passenger
cars with capacities between 300 and
500 persons distributed along the
length of the train. By allowing the
center of gravity to be lowered, the
extra-width rails would facilitate
speeds between 150 and 200 mph using
d.c. electric power. Fares would be
comparable to toll way rates (includ-
ing gasoline costs) and the driver and
his car would be spared the wear and
tear. Also, it is estimated that one such
line would have the traffic capacity
of a 10-lane highway, if trains were
run at five-minute intervals. And it
would have the attraction to the
driver of keeping him near the com-
fort and convenience of his car.
Much research has been done in
recent years on land vehicles which
operate without wheels. In most of
these, the car rests above the ground
(or water) on a thin cushion of air,
provided by large fans or air com-
pressors located beneath the car. For
water travel this method has been
developed for actual use. On land,
however, the unevenness of the terrain
presents problems. The most practical
way to utilize the air cushion concept
is with a train confined to a reasonably
level track. The Ford Motor Company
has done extensive research on one
such type of train.7 On the drawing
board each car is 124 ft. long, carries
200 passengers and is powered by a
turboprop engine in both the front
and back so that cars are not linked
together. It is named Levacar because
of the so-called "levapad," the metal
plate through which air is pumped,
forming a thin film for the car to ride
on. As shown in Fig. 2, the levapad
presses on the top and inside of the
rail, and the car is hooked onto the
elevated track, to prevent derailment.
This cylinder-shaped model is de-
signed to reach 150 mph., but a slight
power increase would raise speeds up
to 350 mph. In fact, experiments in-
dicate that such a car could go 500
mph with more improvement. Herein
lies the great advantage of wheel-less
vehicles, for experts believe wheeled
trains will never get much over 200
mph because of friction.
A similar type of air cushion train
system is being worked on by Britain's
Hovercraft, the makers of Hovercar.
One of their experimental models
would travel on an elevated track at
about 300 mph and use either diesel or
electric power. And Westinghouse is
investigating a track made of j&gt;enna-
nently magnetic material. The train
would have magnetic strips on its
underside which would be repelled by
the track, forming a "cushion" of mag-
netic flux. The rails for such a track
can already be produced at almost the
cost of steel track.
The use of jet propulsion in trains
is being studied, and even supersonic
speeds between 1000 and 2000 mph
are no longer considered impossible.
More likely for the near future, vet
still fairly far out, is the plan of Dr.
Joseph Foa of Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute." His train would travel in
a circular tube above or below ground
at speeds of 250 to 400 mph. Shaped
something like a cigar, each car would
be 9 ft. in diameter, 195 ft. long and
carry 200 people. There would be
three air cushion outlets at each end to
maintain the car about one foot from
the tube side. The power would be
from an aeronautic-type fanjet or ram-
jet which would rapidly move air in
front of the car to the rear, preventing
air pressure from building up ahead.
Regardless of the train design, con-
ventional or new-fangled, the use of
computers in future mass transit op
erations will become more and more
essential. Computers enable railroad
officials to keep constant tab on all
their cars and tell them how to link
trains together to maintain the effi-
cient service. Computers can be in-
corporated into train scheduling to
increase total use of cars and lower
train headway (the space between two
trains on the same track) in spite of
increasing speeds. They are also be-
coming invaluable in immediate de-
tection of mechanical failures in mov-

maintenance work.
In describing the possible trains of
the future, little has been said about
economic considerations. Naturally
there is often a wide gap between
technological feasibility and economic
feasibility. All of the models listed
could be built at reasonable cost but
only those which are deemed neces-
sary and sufficient by mass transit
planners will ever become reality. For
instance, some experts feel that an
intercity train of speed less than 200
mph will not be sufficiently fast to
draw people away from the comfort
and convenience of their cars. If this
were true, it would seem to eliminate
all conventional wheeled trains, like
the Tokaido-type express, from the
running. And of course whatever plan
is chosen for areas like the Northeast
Corridor will require that all the rail-
road lines operate in such a way as
best to meet the total transportation
needs of the public.
Automobile and Bus Travel
The future of automobile travel is
less certain than that of the railroad
and subway. Of course over a long
period of time, say 50 years, one can
expect some radical changes, but
whether or not these innovations will
be realized in the next 10 to 20 years
is not easy to say. As with the trains,
modern technology is already pre-
pared to make drastic alterations in
the car of tomorrow, but the progress
of the automobile is even more re-
stricted by economic considerations
than that of the railroads. The auto
companies, while no more profit-moti-
vated than the private railroads, are
in a much healthier condition and
therefore do not qualify for any of the
generous government research assist-
ance.
The rising importance of railroads
should in no way decrease the popu-
larity of the automobile. America is
more dependent on its private trans-
portation than ever before. Nothing
will replace the convenience of the
auto. Writing in Traffic Engineering
magazine, Carlton Robinson gives
four reasons why the auto sales will
continue to grow. First, incomes are
rising so more people can afford cars.
Second, more people are buying
homes, thereby decreasing urban pop-
ulation density, and thus increasing
the need for autos in travel to and
from the home. Contrary to some
opinion, Robinson states: "Trans-
portation is not a cause in urban
affairs; it is an effect. People may build
their homes in one sector rather than
another due to transportation acces-
sibility but the main choice—to build
at all—is the independent variable."
A third reason is, of course, the rise
in population. Finally, automobile
trips are becoming longer, especially
in urban areas where cross-town travel
is often necessary."
Exactly what changes will be made
in the actual design of the automo-
bile? In spite of the publicity given to
gas turbines and other types of power,
it appears likely that the conventional
'1-cycle carbureted piston engine will
be with us for the next twenty years
or longer. This seems to be the opin-
ion of the majority of car experts in-
cluding the famous French automotive
engineer, Fernand Picard, who lists
reasons why other types of proposed
engines are still in the distant future
as far as mass production is con-
cerned.'0 The gas turbine has achieved
performance comparable to that of
piston engines, but noise levels during
acceleration are still unacceptable. To
make any significant improvement in
this area would require additional
weight, cutting performance below
the demands of the public. However,
the turbine has the attractive feature
of low exhaust emission, so in these
days of increasing air pollution, it may
become popular sooner than expected.
The use of nuclear energy in auto-
mobiles has been considered, but there
are serious drawbacks to this type of
|x)wer. With a fission-type power
plant, the several tons of protective
shielding necessary would be prohibi-
tive. A fusion-type engine is still many
years in the future. Only if new re-
actions of low critical mass were dis-
covered would a nuclear engine be-
come feasible.
Another type of power, that of elec-
tricity, has been studied and has per-
haps the greatest potential of any of
the new proposals. One great advan-
tage of electrical power is that there
is no pollution effect. However, in its
present state, the battery-driven en-
gine lacks the necessary performance
in the medium-to high-speed range.
Also, weight is a problem, and there
seems little chance of improvement in
this respect. However, development of
different chemical combinations in the
battery could make the electric engine
a reality.
Even if the basic construction of the
automobile remains unchanged, there
will certainly be improvements in the
car of tomorrow. For one thing, the
problem of air pollution continues to
mount in America, causing a hazard to
health, damage to property and a gen-
eral demoralizing effect on the people.
All forms of transportation contribute
about 63% of the pollutants in the
atmosphere. The exhaust fumes of our
72 million automobiles are responsible
for four-fifths of this percentage." The
federal government has recently taken
legal action to insure reduction of car
fumes and the auto manufacturers
I
have finally expressed a willingness to
make the necessary improvement in
the immediate future.
There will be some advances in the
electrical systems, leading to more re-
liability and fewer maintenance costs.
The use of transistors for ignition is
being experimented with. Battery and
alternator improvements are antici-
pated and less complicated wiring will
no doubt follow.
The American can look forward to
greater comfort and smaller size in

to prove your worth early in your career. Dale
Anderson's experience is a case in point.
After receiving his B.A. in Physics in June, 1962,
Dale joined our College Graduate Program and
was assigned to our Research Laboratories.
Recently he was given the responsibility for cor-
recting cab vibration occurring on a particular

tricity was the cause of the trouble. Since little change could be effected
in tire compliance, his solution lay in redesigning the suspension system.
Tests of this experimental system show the problem to be reduced to an
insignificant level.
That's typical of the kind of meaningful assignments given to employes
while still in the College Graduate Program—regardless of their career

The Company's first engine, the Wasp, took
to the air on May 5,1926. Within a year the
Wasp set its first world record and went on
to smash existing records and set standards
for both land and seaplanes for years to

new standards of performance in much the
same way as the Wasp had done in the
1920 s. The 727 and DC-9 are indicative of
the new family of short-to-medium range

in
ship control
design
by Edson R. Graves
With the advent of automation the
layout of work places and the design
of large control consoles will become
an important, though relatively small,
consideration of the naval architect.
The human engineering aspect is in
essence the logical layout of control
and display centers. However, it must
be remembered that it is the object
of human engineering to make the
operators job more natural, not just
easier. By making the job more natu-
ral and efficient the operator will
be able to allow more time to making
that sometimes all-important snap
decision. It is in this respect that
the automated ship will be safer, at
least as far as the man behind the
control console is concerned. This
paper deals with the human engineer-
ing of the pilothouse and engine
rooms along with other safety factors
which human engineering can bring
about.
Before a designer can attempt to
lay out a wheelhouse, he must first be-
come familiar with the basic problems
of human engineering as related to the
layout of work places. The first ques
tion the designer must ask himself is:
"What is the purpose of this system?'*
By asking this question he should be
able to eliminate the problem of com-
bining unrelated tasks. The next prob-
lem to overcome is to decide just how
this task might best be performed.
Should the operator be seated or stand-
ing, which controls are the most impor-
tant and where should the emergency
controls be placed. These questions
are just a few of the basic ones a de-
signer must ask himself when consid-
ering the principles of human engi-
neering to design a control console.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


sidered in the layout of the work
place. Among the most important di-
mensions are the viewing distance and
the optimum viewing angle. The op
timum distance is usually taken as
28 inches under normal conditions
while the optimum angle is that angle
on either side of the center line which
the operator can see without eye
strain and without moving his head.
Another important set of dimensions
deals with the size, shape and contour
of display and control panels. The op-
timum is the continuous curved panel,
the si/e of which depends on whether
or not the operator is seated or stand-
ing. Of course, this type of panel
would be the most expensive to build.
When controls are sensitive and re-
quire fine adjustment it would be best
to have the operator seated instead
of standing. The seated operator has
good control over a smaller area and
would be more able to withstand the
rolling and pitching of a ship in heavy
weather. For a complete set of work
place dimensions,reference (1) should
be consulted.
After the basic control space has
been worked out, the next step is to
arrange the controls and displays into
the optimum array. The first thing is
to determine the frequency a control
or display is used. The next step is to
determine the accuracy and/or speed
with which the display must be read
and how much of an emergency will
be caused if there is an error in the
reading of the display. (1) And, as
would be expected, the controls and
displays having the top priority would
receive the optimum positions on the
control panel. The next problem is
to consider the location of the emer-
gency controls. The location of these
controls depends upon the seriousness
of the emergency should it arise. If
the emergency could become critical,
then these controls and displays are
given top priority; if not, they are
placed in readily accessible positions.
The grouping of controls and displays
along with the association between the
two is another important considera-
tion in the human engineering of
control panels. The two types of
groupings are the functional and the
sequential. Both groupings speak for
themselves. When associating controls
and displays it must be remembered
which controls go with which displays
and the relationship of the operator
to the piece of equipment he is con-
trolling. The spacing between indi-
vidual controls is of importance for
two reasons. The first being that con-
trols placed too close together are apt
to interfere with each other. The other
reason is that there is often a need for
being able to work the panel when
visibility is limited.
The final basic consideration is the
direction-of-movement relationship.
For example, if a throttle lever is
pushed forward, you would expect
motion or an increase in speed in that
direction. But consider the condition
where the fore and aft lever controls
a gage on which the pointer moves
horizontally. The question is: "which
way will the pointer move if the lever
is again displaced forward?" By the
adopted convention the pointer will
show an increase by moving from left
to right. There are four simple con-
ventions to remember, and they are:
(1) a lever moved up, (2) a lever
moved to the right, (3) a dial turned
clockwise, and (4) a lever moved for-
ward all indicate an increase. By fol-
lowing these conventions while the
control console is still in the design
stage, a great deal of time and trouble
may be saved.
One of the most imjjortant control
centers on board ship is the wheel-
house and now that we have a under-
standing of the basic human engineer-
ing problems we can attack its design.
While there are many problems to
consider in the layout of the wheel-
house, the two main problems are the
location of the chart room with re-
spect to the wheelhouse and the de-
gree of visibility which is needed in
the wheelhouse. These two problems
are not at all independent of each
other. The other problems which need
to be solved deal mainly with the ac-
tual positions of equipment in the
pilothouse layout. These smaller prob-
lems deal mainly with the basic prob-
lem in human engineering.
The more modern point of view
seems to favor the incorporation, at
least to some extent, of the chart room
into the wheelhouse, but very little
has actually been done to test the idea,
particularly in large vessels. The only
major attempt at this was done by
Sun Oil (4) in one of their new
tankers. But let us first look at the
reasons for combining the chart room
with the wheelhouse. For the human
engineering aspect we must analyze
the problem from the watch officer's
point of view since he is interested in
both the wheelhouse and the chart
room. Let us assume that the chart
room is directly aft of the wheelhouse
but separated from it. Basically, this
situation will become a, problem only
at night. When the watch officer needs
to consult the chart, he must break
contact with the bridge and enter the
lighted chartroom (2). There are two
main faults to be found with this pro-
cedure. The first, that by leaving the
wheelhouse the watch officer loses
touch with what is happening there.
Secondly, upon returning to the dark-
ened bridge, it might be a matter of
minutes before his eyes become re-
adjusted for night vision. Both the
loss of contact and proper vision on
the part of the officer in charge could
put the ship in serious trouble. At any
rate, neither of these losses can be
accounted for in the proper human
engineering of the wheelhouse, and
both need to be corrected. However,
there are many other problems which
do arise when making the chart room
and the wheelhouse a single unit.
F. E. Lanso (9) in his well-known
tear-drop shaped wheelhouse, has al-
lowed room for two chart desks. One
regular desk for day use and one hood-
ed desk provided with a red night light
for reading charts at night. To deter-
mine just how satisfactory the hooded
desk is will require that some actual
tests be made, however, it would seem
quite acceptable from the human en-
gineering standpoint. There are, how-
ever, many instruments which must
also be read at night, and thus require
light. The use of the red night lights
can be again employed. The Sun Oil
tanker wheelhouse design is patterned
quite closely after the Lanso design
but with one important exception. In
the Sun design a folding room divider
is used to separate the charts from the
rest of the wheelhouse and thus pro-
viding good chart reading for the
watch officer and crew while still al-
lowing proper contact with the wheel-
house. (4) The problem of inter-
rupted night vision, however, has not
been solved.
The layout of a wheelhouse of this
type is of great importance from the
human engineering standpoint, and
all of the design considerations relate

theory. For example, the placement
and direction of the sensory controls
is important. Should engine telegraph
be placed port or starboard and in a
lore and aft or transverse direction?
The human engineering conventions
dictate that the telegraph be placed
to the right of the optimum position
of the operator and in a fore and aft
direction with the lever showing an
increase in speed to forward. The
grouping priority conventions should
also be taken into account. If the
groups of instruments are separated,
there should be enough room to allow
completely unrestricted movement of
the operators about the bridge, espe-
cially at night. The optimum distance
between controls groups is about 2.5
to 3 feet. (1) With the advent of auto-
mation many of the new separated
instruments will be grouped into a
single control console, the problems
of which have already been men-
tioned. These control consoles will
have advantages such as convenience,
ease of control (with proper human
engineering designing), cleanliness of
space saving, but the maintenance
problems could become overwhelming
in magnitude. (2)
Even on a completely automated
ship it will still be necessary and ad-
visable to have a watch officer on the
bridge since his sensory system is bet-
ter than any machine yet developed.
(10) But, in order for him to see any
approaching trouble, he must have a
completely unrestricted view of the
surrounding water. The second main
feature of the Lanso pilot house de-
sign is the unrestricted view. Pilot-
houses with an unlimited view are
quite common in towboats, tugs and
fishing boats but they have seen only
a limited application in ocean going
craft. (3)
At night when the folding room di-
vider of the Sun design is used to keep
chart reading lights from the bridge,
it will also do much to limit the vis-
ibility of the watch. Thus, it would
seem that very little has been gained
in the way of human engineering dur-
ing night operations. The Sun pilot-
house does, however, have two features
which are very beneficial during day-
light hours. The first is that the glass
in all of the windows is tinted. The
second feature is that the front win-
dows are canted, thus reducing fur-
ther the amount of glare. Both the re-
duction in glare and the increase in
visibility are two very important con-
siderations to be taken into account
when human engineering a wheel-
house.
Since in this study of pilot houses
quite a bit has been said about the
design of Lanso (9) and the Sun de-
sign (4) it would seem advisable to
show these two designs and list the
important human engineering factors
under each figure.
The other important base of con-
trols is in the engine room of the ship.
Most of the problems from the human
engineering standpoint are related
back to the basic theory. Therefore,
in this part of the paper a few of these
principles will be brought to light.
The most important control and dis-
play in the engine room is the valve
and the gage or indicator. Valves gen-
erally turn clock-wise for a decrease
or toward off position, but this can be
confusing since the clock-wise-to-de-
crease concept conflicts with the con-
vention already set up, in which the
clock-wise motion denotes an increase.
(1) Therefore, good human engineer-
ing practice indicates that the valve
should clearly state purpose and di-
rection of increasing or decreasing.
The type of gage or indicator to be
employed for a specific job depends
on the type of information required,
the speed, and the degree of accuran
needed. For example, the steam pres-
sure gage is checked quite often to see
if the pressure is in the desired range
and any large deviation can be readily
seen, but no great accuracy is needed.
Therefore, as can be seen from the
chart on the next page the gage with
a moving pointer and fixed scale is
the optimum, and, in practice, the one
most commonly used. Table 1 shows
which tvpe of the 3 basic indicators
best (its the information, speed and
accuracy required. (7)
If information is desired quicklv
and accurately the "counter" is best
from the human engineering stand
point. Since the information can be

Check reading — verification that a normal value is being indicated (on-oll

Setting — verification that the associated control has been set to the required
value as needed (dial indicator of lathe)
read and interpreted without any
mental conversions. (10) In the auto-
mated engineroom the human engi-
neering control console will become
very important. If we assume that there
will be only two men in the engine
room with one man doing the actual
controlling while the other keeps a
check on the machinery in general,
the man at the controls will have a
highly important job and the natural
placement of the control console will
be of extreme importance.
When using the principles of hu-
man engineering to design the place-
ment of the console such factors as
noise and vibration must be taken
into account. But, it would seem that
the optimum position would be as
centralized as possible, thus allowing
the operator a minimum amount of
time to reach all corners of the engine
room should the need arise.
So far no mention has been made of
safety, which is one of the main rea-
sons for human engineering a ship.
The human engineered workplace
layout will naturally be safer thus,
making the ship as a whole safer. How-
ever, the human engineered safety
factor does not end here. Basically the
main problem is one of navigational
safety, the sending and receiving of
the maximum amount of information
about location and intention of course
change, etc. There are three modes
of conveying information to and from
other ships in the area and they are
sight, sound and instruments such as
radar and sonar. One method of im-
proving sight has already been dis-
cussed, but no matter what the de-
gree of visibility may be, poorly placed
and under powered running lights
just can't always be seen in time to
prevent a mishap. There is an ever
growing need for more powerful
lights, regulations which are up to
date with present ship speed and
power and precise standards for the
interpretation of running lights. (5
and 8) At present 25 candle power
lights are used, but the question is
now being asked, why not use modi-
fied airplane lights with candle power
ranging up to 10,000? (5) The place-
ment of these more powerful lights is
very critical since the reflection from
such lights could easily impare
the vision of the watch. Also, tests
should be made to determine the
specific shade of the red and green
lights which will give maximum visi-
bility in all types of weather, along
with regulation to insure the proper
use of these lights. The use of reflec-
tive surfaces should be avoided partic-
ularly in way of the bridge.
Sound signals can only be relied
upon up to about one-half a mile, but
even then there is no assurance that
the complete message has been re-
ceived or understcxxl correctly. (8)
There are several ways of improving
sound signals. The frequencies in
sound systems used now are generally
too high. It has been shown, that
lower frequencies carry further. Thus,
it would seem advisable to use these
lower frequencies. (5) Sound detec-
tion devices could also be used to in-
sure better communications. From the
human engineering standpoint, sharp
cornors, wires, etc. which cause am-
bient noises should be eliminated
thus, greatly reducing the number of
distracting noises.
The computer can be a very effec-
tive machine and when it is coupled
with a ship radar it can be a very use-
ful navigational device. The radar
information is fed into the computer
and the computer then determines
the closest point of approach. If this
approach distance falls within a pre-
determined critical distance, an alarm
sounds. The watch officer can then
quite simply change the speed and/or
the course to keep the ship out of
danger. Of course, the computer will
be able to handle more than one ship
at a time. However, this system, as
good as it might become, should never
eliminate the usual periodic checks of
the radar screen. (8)
A final safety consideration is the
bow lookout station. There are three
main factors influencing the design
of such a layout. This important sta-
tion should be human engineered in
such ways as to provide efficient and
complete communication with the
bridge, to include facilities to prevent
fatigue and finally to provide pro-
tection from the elements. (5)
Only a few of the basic human en-
gineering considerations have been
brought out in this attempt to apply
such considerations to the design of
control centers on board ship. There
are many more subtle factors to con-

MICHIGAN:
EDUCATION
AND
RESEARCH
The University of Michigan an-
nounces the inauguration this fall
of a program lending to the Bachelor's
degree in Nuclear Engineering. The
department of Nuclear Engineering,
formed in 1958, has previously offered
programs leading to the M.S. and to
the Ph.D. degree.
Graduates of the department, num-
bering more than 60 Ph.D.'s, and
more than 250 who have received the
M.S. degree, hold responsible positions
in nuclear energy installations around
the world. More than a third of those
receiving the Ph.D. degree are now
teaching in nuclear engineering or re-
lated areas. Graduates work at atomic
energy laboratories in Belgium, Nor-
way, Greece, Turkey, Israel, Mexico,
Puerto Rico,Thailand,Pakistan,South
Viet Nam, Erance, Japan, Taiwan,
and the United States.
The nuclear engineering program
at the University of Michigan, like
that at many other schools, was orig-
inally organized at the graduate
level because of the new and rapidly
changing character of the field. With
the growth and development of nu-
clear energy applications over the
years, nuclear engineering has become
stable and more readily definable as
a professional area.
Recent developments in applied nu-
clear energy have increased the de-
mand for nuclear engineers. Manu-
facturers have issued firm prices for
nuclear power plants that are com-
petitive with costs of conventional
power plants. Current Atomic Energy
Commission estimates are that by the
turn of the century half of all elec-
trical energy generated in the United
States will tome from nuclear power.
Estimates for 1!)8() predict that 10 to
20 per cent of electrical energy will
be supplied by nuclear plants.
The Atomic Energy Commission,
with the Department of the Interior,
is developing nuclear power plants for
water desalting. Large plants that
combine the production of water and
electricity look especially promising,
both the city of Los Angeles and Long
Island are currently considering nu-
clear power desalting systems.
The hemisphere's first commercial
food irradiation plant, a potato proc-
essing facility, was dedicated Sep-
tember Hi at Mont St. Hilaire, Que-
bec. The ,S800,000 plant was built by
Atomic Energy of Canada for a com-
mercial processor.
In the field of space power, current
projects range from operational test-
ing of small isotopic powered electri-
cal generators such as those used in
the Nimbus or Aeros weather satel-
lites, to development of reactor pow-
ered electrical generators producing
as much as 15 to 20 kilowatts of elec-
trical power suitable for manned
moon missions. The AEC and N ASA
are also likely to propose to Congress
next year the further development of
a nuclear powered rocket system call-
able of producing 200-300,000 lbs
thrust using a 5000 megawatt reactor
and costing about SI billion.
Commercial demand for radioiso-
topes is rising sharply. The A EC's
planned production during fiscal 1966
is more than ten times that of last year.
Controlled fusion is still receiving
large amounts of scientific and finan-
cial support in the U.S. and even more
abroad. The almost unlimited energv
resources which a practical svstem
would make available continue to
make this area worth pursuing.
With the growth and expansion
of applied nuclear energy, engineers

demand. The Department of Nuclear
Enginering with its background in
research and in teaching graduate
students is in an ideal position to
train the engineers needed to design,
construct and operate the many new
facilities now coming into being. It
will also continue, through its grad-
uate programs, to provide men
equipped to carry out the research
needed to make such new devices as a
controlled fusion reactor a reality.
METALWORKING RESEARCH
Metalworking research carried out
in Japan's institutes and universities
is more extensive than similar re-
search in the United States. This re-
flects Japan's emphasis on its modern
industrialized economy, a University
of .Michigan survey points out.
The study was made by the Indus-
trial Development Division of the
U-M Institute of Science and Tech-
nology. The report was written by C.
Carl Wilson (now at the General Mo-
tors Institute in Flint) under the
direction of Dr. Frank R. Bacon, Jr.
The report details the "what, where
and by whom" of such work in Japan,
and is the first detailed documentation
of this key sector of Japan's surging
economy. Japan's growth rate is the
largest of any industrialized nation
over the past 15 years. Its main growth
industries — machine tools, refrigera-
tors, radio and TV receivers, precision
instruments, autos and motor bikes —
depend heavily on metalworking tech-
nology.
The report points out that the total
man-months of research in Japanese
universities and non-profit institutes
was 3,438, compared to about 2,000
man-months in the U.S. About half
of the Japanese research was carried
out by the institutes, while in the
U.S. 70 per cent was done in institutes,
as compared to universities. The re-
port also noted that 85 per cent of
the research is supported by the Jap-
anese national government. In the
U.S., half the total support came from
industry. Half of the Japanese effort
is basic research, while in the U.S.
two-thirds of the university and some
•lO per cent of institute work was basic.
The report is the second in a series
of three documenting and comparing
metalworking research in the U.S.,
Japan and Europe. The report on the
European industry is due shortly.

Distribution Service, East University

OUTBOARD MOTOR SYSTEM
Electrical engineering upperclass-
men at The University of Michigan
who designed an all-elec tric outboard
motor system as a class project de-
scribed it as their "best educational
experience in four years of college."
The 16 students were given the task
to provide them with design expe-
rience of the kind they will get in in-
dustry. Until they entered this class,
most of their work had been theoret-
ical.
Students in the same course this
semester are struggling to design an
all-electric highway system. While the
present group is encountering heavy
going in the complexity of the prob-
lem, the U-M professors noted, those
who designed the outboard motor did
extremely well.
"We found this is a very, very effec-
tive approach to the teaching of en-
gineering design," the U-M faculty
said.
In the course, instructors served as
management of a corporation which
had clone a market survey and was
turning to its engineering stall for de-
velopment of a new product. In fact,
such a market survey was made, as well
as a military systems study to deter-
mine the need for the outboard motor,
before the course started.
Students were divided into sub-
groups to cope with three elements of
the problem: the power system, motor
control and mechanical design. Their
task was to produce a prototype model
ready for testing by the end of the 15-
week semester.
They did so, and met some realistic
problems along the way.
"They were in a tight scheduling
situation," Professor Diamond re-
ported. "And met problems common
to industry. One student learned a
supplier could not meet a deadline
lor furnishing a part for the proto-
type, so the student called him long
distance and really chewed the sup-
plier out."
The course was established at Mich-
igan a year ago to provide realistic
experience before the students entered
industry. While it is still evolving,
the U-M faculty are pleased with its
success and plan to continue it. Their
key problem is finding a situation in
which students must come up with a
specific mechanical design, they noted.
It should give them experience in pro-
ducing an electrical prototype. Thus,
the outboard motor type of project
is much more suitable than a complex
system design such as the automated
highway system, they pointed out.
AWARDS
A University of Michigan civil en-
gineer and one of his former graduate
students recently received jointly a
top award from the Water Pollution
Control Federation at its annual
awards banquet.
Prof. Jack A. Borchardt and Dr.
William E. Gates, now at the Georgia
Institute of Technology, received the
Harrison Prescott Eddy Medal for
their research showing how to extend
waste treatment to remove chemical
nutrients. The research showed how-
to remove from sewage plant effluents
the chemical nutrients which can ac-
celerate the growth of nuisance plants
or weeds that adversely affect the re-
ceiving ponds or waters. Such un-
wanted growth contributes to situa-
tions like that now present in Lake
Erie, where chemical nutrients speeded
up the aging and decline of the lake.
Previously,only organic nutrients were
removed by primary and secondary
sewage treatment. Thus, removal of
the chemical nutrients adds a third,
or tertiary, treatment stage.
Borchard and Gates achieved this
by controlling the environment of the
algae in the sewage treatment tanks
to force the algae to remove the chem-
ical nutrients as well as the organic
substances. Borchard said their me-
thod can be made to be 95 to 98 per
cent effective. That is, it can remove
that percentage of the chemical nu-
trients — which previously were not
removed at all.
The paper describing their work,
"Nitrogen and Phosphorous Extrac-
tion from Domestic Wastewater Treat-
ment Plant Effluents by Controlled
Algal Cultures," appeared in the Fed-
eration's journal of April 1964. The
Federation gives the Eddy medal an-
nually in "recognition of outstanding
research contributing in an important
degree to the existing knowledge of
the fundamental principles or proc-
esses of wastewater treatment."

by "lazy" neutrons can affect a chemi-
cal used in certain space vehicle bat-
teries has brought an award to a Uni-
versity of Michigan nuclear engineer
and one of his former students.
The paper by Prof. Chihiro Kikuchi
and Robert 15. Oswald, (r. — now of
the Harry Diamond Laboratories.
Washington, D. C. — was cited for
being the best of some 00 presented at
a conference here last summer. In it
Kikuchi and Oswald showed how the
battery chemical, cadmium sulphide,
would lose much of its ability to con-
duct electric current if it were irradi-
ated by the"lazy"or thermal neutrons.
Such neutrons are much less energetic
than the so-called fast neutrons. In
fact, because scientists thought ther-
mal neutrons didn't have enough mo-
mentum or energy to produce impor-
tant changes through irradiation, little
research had been spent seeking them.
At the IEEE (Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers) conference
on Nuclear and Space Radiation Ef-
fects, Kikuchi and Oswald reported
that thermal neutrons can indeed
cause significant changes. The finding
is significant in its implications about
batteries which must operate in a ra-
diation environment aboard space-
craft — with a nuclear power source
aboard, for example. Fast neutrons
alter materials chemically and phys-
ically by slamming into their atoms
and knocking them out of their posi-
tions within the material's crystal lat-
tice, the theoretical Tinker Toy-like
structure which represents how atoms
fit together to form materials.
The lazy thermal neutrons, how-
ever, are much more subtle. When one
is caught by a nucleus, excess energy
is driven off in the form of gamma
rays. The gamma rays springing from
the atom cause it to recoil — just as a
man diving off a boat shoves the boat
away from him. Thus the recoiling
atom shifts position within the crys-
tal lattice, producing the change in
the material's electrical and optical
properties.
Besides the change in cadmium
sulphide's electrical conductivity, the
U-M researchers found that ther-
mal neutron irradiation also altered
the crystal's optical properties. It
emitted a red glow when illumi-
nated with invisible ultraviolet light.
Under National Aeronautics and Space
Administration support, Kikuchi is
now extending his research into pos-
sible applications for this new knowl-
edge, and is looking into the effects
of thermal neutron irradiation on
other materials as well.
One application may be to control
impurities in crystal structures to more
than one part in a million. Irradia-
tion of the crystal by thermal neutrons
would tend to remove from the crys-
tal lattice structure atoms in unwant-
ed locations. This application could
be significant because impurities of
this scale are, for example, what make
transistors work.
Resides its role in space batteries,
cadmium has several other uses. One
important one is for shielding in nu-
clear reactors. This is, in fact, what
put Kikuchi and Oswald on to the
thermal neutron effects. Kikuchi re-
ports he came across the idea while
lecturing to one of his classes on the
use of cadmium as a shielding male-
rial. "The result shows," he noted,
"how teaching and basic research in-
teract and how they can lead to prac-
tical applications. In arying to make
fundamentals clear to students, you
often come up with new ideas. This
illustrates why," he continued, "most
basic ideas come from educational in-
stitutions. There the researchers are
also teachers."

Prof. Louis Weinberg of The Uni-
versity of Michigan department of
electrical engineering presented two
papers at the Allerton Conference on
Circuit and System Theory held at the
University of Illinois October 20-22.
The titles of the papers are "Plane
Representations and Codes for Planar
Graphs" and "Algorithms for Deter-
mining Automorphism Croups of
Planar Graphs."
Results presented in the papers are
based on research conducted by Pro-
fessor Weinberg under sponsorship of
the Radar Laboratory of the Institute
of Science and Technology. Dr. Wein-
berg, in addition to presenting his
theoretical results, discussed the prac-
tical applications to such problems as
pattern recognition, the automatic re-
trieval of information, and machine
translation of languages. For example,
one problem that has become acute in
past years is the search of patent files:
Dr. Weinberg's codes for chemical

Prof. Richard K. Osborn of The
University of Michigan department of
nuclear engineering was presented the
American Society for Engineering Ed-
ucation's Western Electric Fund
Award for excellence in instruction
of engineering students at the Michi-
gan-Ohio section meeting last spring
in Toledo. The award, established
last year to honor outstanding engi-
neering professors, consists of a certi-
ficate and cash honorarium.
Professor Osborn was selected for
"his abilities as a leader, as an in-
spired director of graduate students,
and his outstanding contributions in
nuclear engineering."
The citation also points out that
"the list of doctoral students who have
received degrees under his supervision
and their subsequent accomplishments
document his worth as an educator of
engineers."
Osborn joined the U-M faculty in
1057 as an assoc iate professor and was
promoted to professor two years later.
He came to the U-M from Oak Ridge
National Laboratory wrhere he had
been a research physicist and instruc-
tor.

If you were an astronaut, here's
what you'd see from your win-
dows as your spacecraft rendez-
voused with another in orbit to
link up and transfer men and sup-
plies. The "windows" actually are
TV screens on which computer-
driven views are presented ex-
actly as they would be seen by
an astronaut. The manned orbital
laboratory simulator shown here
is part of an advanced system,
called an Integrated Manned
Space Systems Simulator, which
is nearing completion at the As-
tronautics division of General Dy-
namics Corp., San Diego. When
completed, the entire system will
be capable of simulating in de-
tail every conceivable manned
mission in earth orbit, to the
moon, or to any planet in the
solar system. Its purpose is to
study man's role in space to gain
a better understanding of the
requirements for crew systems
and spacecraft design.
The beams from two lasers combine
and interfere with each other, causing
the circular rings on this screen. To
obtain such interference rings, it is
necessary for the two beams to be at
the same frequency and to have a con-
stant phase difference. Prior to this ex-
periment, interference patterns such
as these could be obtained only by
using beams derived from the same
source. John Rodda, left, and Louis
Enloe of Bell Telephone Laboratories
invented a way of loc&lt;ing the two
light beams from separate lasers to-
gether in phase. In experimental light
communications systems one laser could
be used on the transmitting end and
would be "tracked" by a second laser
located some distance away at the re-
ceiving end. Phase-locking two lasers
opens up a new area in optical com-
munications research.

his automobile of the future. Much of
the optional equipment of today's
cars, like air-conditioning, will very
likely become standard on tomorrow's
models. While changes in shape will
reflect fashion considerations more
than technological innovation, the
trend will definitely be toward com-
pactness of size. In Europe where
streets are often narrow and parking
space at a premium, a car the size of
our standard Chevrolet or Ford is a
rare sight. As American traffic and
parking conditions become more and
more congested, smaller cars will
necessarily follow.
Most of what has been said about
the automobile of the future can be
applied to the bus. Improvements in
auto design will generally be applic-
able in bus design. There will be
improvements in passenger comfort to
compete with the other forms of pub-
lic transportation. As with the rail-
roads, buses make possible a more
efficient use of land space than the
automobile. However, buses are not
expected to capture a larger share of
the passenger market than they now
have. In fact, moderate improvements
in the automobile might actually
weaken bus competition.
Roads and Traffic
Since there is no foreseeable let-up
in automobile production, the need
for more roads and better traffic con-
trols will continue to mount. Already,
most large cities are experiencing
some degree of intolerable street and
highway congestion. Sprawling metro-
politan areas like Los Angeles and the
Northeast Corridor from Boston to
Washington have unprecedented traf-
fic problems which require more than
the present massive road-building
programs. There is a need for long-
range planning which will utilize
scientific and technological innova-
tion and lead to more efficient use of
our streets and highways.
The 15-year Interstate Highway pro-
gram, in which the federal govern-
ment shares the cost of road con-
struction with the individual states
has given rise to a network of modern,
fast highways throughout the nation.
When the program terminates in 1972,
America's capacity for intercity auto-
mobile and bus transportation will
have been vastly increased. But it is
already evident that a mere extension
of this plan into the future will not
be sufficient to handle the traffic con-
ditions for very long. It has been esti-
mated that by 1980, 60%of all highway
travel will be in urban areas where
space is necessarily restricted.'2 Con-
sequently there is a need for better
traffic control systems.
Already at work in cities like De-
troit and Munich, Germany are tele-
vision systems which instantaneously
transmit to a central station pictures
of traffic conditions from critical areas
of the city. With an over-all view of
traffic flow throughout the city, the
engineer at the central station can
regulate the access to and from the
city's expressways. If one region is too
thick with cars, he can close entrances
to the highway or vice versa. He can
also adjust speed limits at different
points by means of scoreboard-like
signs. This type of system has much
promise for the near future.
The importance of the computer
in future traffic regulation cannot be
overestimated. The television system
just described would place too great
a burden on the operators at the cen-
tral station if more than a few key
locations were pictured. The modern,
high-speed computer is capable of re-
ceiving traffic information from a
great many points, evaluating the data
quickly and precisely, and automati-
cally making the adjustments through-
out the city necessary to optimize
traffic How.
Here, then, is a sampling of what
to exjxxt in land travel over the next
two decades. Regardless of the ac-
curacy of these predictions, we can
look forward to some exciting changes.
The engineer will play an important
role in implementing these changes,
which will have tremendous impact
on the lives of everyone.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


IN THE TECHNIC
OF
AND 25 YEARS AGO
50 YEARS AGO
Every engineering student today is
used to being accused of living in a
social and cultural vacuum. If it's
getting you down, take comfort in the
knowledge that your forefathers en-
dured the same criticisms. Witness
the TECHNIC of November 1915.
Cultural Subjects And The En-
gineering Student.
Not long ago, at a public meeting
of a large engineering society, this
remark among several outsiders re-
garding a certain engineer was over-
heard: "He is an engineer with a
personality and they are not often met
with."
An engineer with a personality! Are
they indeed so seldom met with that
such a remark was justified? Is this the
general impression of the many or the
mistaken idea of a few? Ask yourself
the questions.
Professor Swain of Harvard Univer-
sity, in an article in the May TECH-
NIC claimed that lack of personality
was the millstone around the neck of
the engineer which kept from him that
recognition as a professional man
which his training and qualities of
mind should justify. The remark has
been made that the profession of law
recruits its ranks from the cream of
the country's young men. This remark
may have foundation on the fact that
lawyers of prominence are continually
spreading the influence of iheir per-
sonality through the public expression
of their ideas. An engineer of equal
prominence in his profession is seldom
heard from. Public speaking is the
greatest medium for transmitting the
influence of a personality. Not only
is it a medium but it is a developer
as well.
This brings us to the point of this
article. What is the reason for this
condition? Why do not engineers ex-
press themselves more publicly? They
are the constructive geniuses of the
country and men with valuable and
progressive ideas, and a more public
expression of their ideas would bring
to them that recognition, which Pro-
fessor Swain claims they do not get.
The answer lies in their early train-
ing. The engineer is not as capable
of expressing himself as the lawyer
for his early training has not fitted
him to do so. In short the cultural
side of his education has been neglect-
ed. His education for the profession
until recent years has been along lines
which tended to develop a methodical,
precise, and more or less narrow trend
of mind and neglected the develop-
ment of that broadness of mind and
perspective which is brought about
through the study of cultural subjects.
The lawyer during his course of study
for the profession must devote a great
deal of time to the study of cultural
subjects. This also applies to the em-
bryo doctor. This has not been the
case until recent years with the en-
gineer. In fact it is only a few years
back when the enginering students at
this university were known as "the
roughnecks" of the campus. In the
last few years, things have changed
and such a remark is seldom if ever
heard any more. Cultural courses have
been opened to the engineer. Not only
have these courses been opened to him
but he has been urged and urged
strongly to take advantage of the op-
portunity afforded him, and he has
taken this advantage. More engineers
are enrolling in the cultural courses
than ever before. Engineering students
have a larger representation in the
oratorical sections at Cornell Univer-
sity than any other department of the
university. This is merely cited as an
instance. It is not the only cultural
subject, by any means, that engineers
are turning to, but it is an important
one, and the early training of the en-
gineer of the future will not justify
any such remark that he is a man lack-
ing in personality, a man without in-
terest to his fellow man except in a
professional way.

night crawlers
Dean Walter B. Rea and the Ann
Arbor police force, perennial sources
of material for this page, collaborated
early last summer and produced this:
Late on Friday night one of the
Dean's vigilant neighbors reported to
police headquarters that a prowler
was lurking about the house. A radio
squad car with two patrolmen was
rushed to the scene to apprehenil the
trespasser. Stalking stealthily around
the side of the house, the officers
pounced on the prowler—who turned
out to be our austere dean himself,
out hunting for night crawlers with a
flashlight.
babe in arms
Last month the Gargoyle had its an-
nual baby. Like the infant New Year,
this immature child confidently prom-
ised all sorts of good things for the
coming year. In smooth phrases that
belied its age, it tried to pull the old
ra//-ma-ta/z play on the supposedly-
naive freshmen. It painted in glowing
terms what they would expect to get
for only one dollar. This went on for
sentence after sentence, even as this.
Standing out in all the build-up was
this—the Garg will come out with a 52
page issue each and every month this
year, replete with pictures, etc.
Good luck, but wanna bet?

One of the outstanding properties
of Malleable Iron Castings
Ductility is a property which provides Malleable iron with a vital safety margin for parts
under stress.
A special heat conversion process transforms the material from brittle "white iron"
to a tough, ductile metal with 10-18% elongation in two inches for ferritic grades, 2-10%
for pearlitic malleables. Ductility is important for two reasons:
1. It guards against sudden failure of a
material. Under a static overload, a ductile
part will deform gradually, giving visual
evidence that failure is occuring. Impact
will create sudden deformation, but un-
less the overload is far above anticipated
levels, the part will stay in one piece.
The faith which engineers place in
Malleable castings for shock applications
is typified by the bridge rail posts pic-
tured at the right. More than 30 states
now specify Malleable for these posts
because tests show the material can
absorb greater impact than lightweight
metals.
MALLEABLE FOUNDERS SOCIETY • UNION COMMERCE BUILDING
CLEVELAND, OHIO 44115
2. A ductile material can be formed in
presses, and Malleable castings are com-
momly punched, roll threaded, joined to
other parts, or otherwise formed to meet
design requirements.
A well-known application is the Malleable
differential housing on an automobile.
On many cars steel tubes are rammed
into each of the side ports of the Malleable
differential housing to create the axle
housing. The Malleable expands slightly
to accept the tubes . . . then holds them
rigidly for the life of the automobile.
Despite the anticipated road jolts, the
only joining operation is a small puddle
weld to maintain alignment of the tubes.

some chemical engineers
prefer to work like this... and some prefer it like this
—we'll promote them both
You can talk to some of our chemical engineering big-
wigs and come away with the impression that a man who
has not yet forgotten everything he learned in freshman
calculus is an impractical theorist and a shirker. (Your
impression would be wrong. He doesn't mean that at all.
Bessel functions were his meat at one time.)
Others of our boss chemical engineers will sound as
though it is no longer decent for an educated professional
to look inside a reactor personally. (He neglects to tell
you how hard it was to give up a grand time as an ap-
prentice steamfitter to enter college.)
Observe, then, that both of these types have risen to
bigwigdom. It takes all kinds to run an outfit like ours.
The chap who applies new directions in the solid state
theory of catalysts to knock a nickel off the tankwagon
price of a monomer deserves reward comparable to that
of the grimy one who cuts a plant's downtime in half by
relocating the filters so that the pump motors quit burn-
ing out.
CHOICE is what we believe in offering, in addition"to
the expected emoluments. We believe in it for our own
good. We can offer it because of our vast and ever-grow-
ing diversification, which is all from within. We offer
choice at the outset and choice after you have had a
chance to try out your ambitions and sec how they work.
Drop us a line about your ambitions. If your ambitions
happen to be in mechanical or electrical engineering,
drop us a line just the same. We offer choice there, too.

"Where would I fit best. . . lab, plant, field, sales, administra-

I couldn't answer. So I looked for a company that would give
me room for lateral, as well as upward, growth. One that was
big enough and still personal enough that I could make adjust-

I found what I wanted at Phillips.
Of course, Phillips is big . . . 19th largest among industrials.
But as I got talking to them, I realized this was, surprisingly,
a people-type company. Pleasant, direct, informal. Personal.
I found out a lot more, too. I'd thought of Phillips only in terms
of oil, refining, gasoline. I hadn't known they were so deep in
LP-gas . . . Rubber. . . Plastics . . . Carbon Black . . . Rocket
Propellant Binders . . . Fertilizers . . . Packaging . . . Textile

EE, ME, ChE, Physics and Chemistry Graduates:
How soon after graduation will somebody
give you a chance to invent something?
It could happen on your first job.
Some very young engineers and scientists at
Xerox helped our "old timers" invent the electro-
mechanical-optical-chemical machine pictured above
—the Xerox 2400. On its patent documents you'll find
names like John Wirley (BSEE Univ. of Detroit '60),
Henry P. Jankowski (BSEE Rensselaer Poly '62), and
Larry H. Warren (BSEE Clarkson '63). They all joined
Xerox right after graduating.
The 2400 is no fluke. It's just a recent example
of a tradition that began in 1959, when Xerox revo-
lutionized the office copying field by introducing the
now world-famous 914 Copier. From the 914 onward,
every new piece of equipment or system we've devel-
oped has had no real counterpart already on the scene
from any competitor.
What about the future? It gets even more inter-
esting. Because as advanced as today's systems may
appear, they don't yet fully reveal the true technology
Xerox is pursuing—graphic communications.
Born out of the global information explosion
and its incredible potential for helping to solve man's
oldest problems (as well as his newest scientific rid-
dles), graphic communications at Xerox encompasses
the entire spectrum of communications in a graphic
sense: the formulation, reception, transmission, re-
cording, storing, retrieving, processing, copying and
presentation of any meaningful images.
And if you don't think all this has a habit of
creating continuing opportunities to "invent some-
thing," ask John, Henry, Larry ... or some of your
own alumni who started their careers here...or your
Placement Director. If you prefer, write directly to
Mr. Stephen G. Crawford, Xerox Corporation, P.O.
Box 1540, Rochester, New York 14603.
XEROX
An Equal Opportunity Employer
XEROX, 2400 AND 914 ARE TRADEMARKS OF XEROX CORPORATION
Performance Note: The Xerox 2400 (illustrated) can produce copies on ordinary paper directly from an original document at the rate of 2,400 per hour.
No "master" need be prepared first. An operator simply places the original on the machine, dials the number of copies wanted, and presses a button.

FACULTY EVALUATION
For as long as anyone can remember faculty
evaluations have been a part of normal university
procedure. This is to be expected, for whenever people
pay for a service they will very naturally and very
properly demand the right to criticize the quality of
that service. Our forefathers demanded representation
when they were taxed by the British. By the same token
students can be expected to demand the right to
criticize the quality of the education they pay for. At this
time this right is generally accepted, but there is
still debate on the procedure for administering
the evaluation.
Whenever the procedure for faculty evaluation is
discussed, two critical issues quickly leap to the front of
the discussion. First, should the evaluation be
compulsory? That is, should there be, in effect, an
edict from the administration demanding that the
faculty members pass out some form of questionnaire to
their students? Secondly, who will see the criticisms
after they have been made? That is, will they be
given to the administration for review, will they be
turned over to the department chairmen, will they be
given to the faculty member for his personal use. or
will they be discretely placed in the wastebasket? The
answers to these questions are almost as numerous
as the people concerned with the issues, for everyone
is intent on protecting his own best interests.
To give a reasonable answer to these questions one
must first decide what a faculty evaluation should
accomplish. Very often this is the point of disagreement—
or possibly just misunderstanding—that prevents
agreement on the aforementioned issues. There are very
definitely some things an evaluation cannot do, and
these should be eliminated immediately. First, it is almost
impossible to get rid of a faculty member, no matter
how incompetent, after he has established tenure.
He can be leaned on and he can be ridiculed, but he
will never be fired. Therefore, it is pointless to suggest
a faculty evaluation with the hope of eliminating the
few really incompetent teachers in the College.
Second, a faculty evaluation should never get into
the hands of anyone who might be in a position to use
it unjustly. This could get completely out of hand
and result in a Gestapo-like pressure on the faculty.
The Faculty must never have its autonomy jeopardized
or be forced to succumb to political or administrative
pressure. This would contradict the philosophy
of independent education.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


These factors eliminate the possibility of an
evaluation that would be reviewed by anyone-
administration, department chairmen, or a board of
students and faculty—other than the faculty
member being evaluated. They also essentially eliminate
the possibility of a compulsory evaluation because
a compulsory evaluation would infringe on the
autonomy of the teacher. There is also the very
pragmatic fact that the faculty simply would
not tolerate a compulsory evaluation.
What, then, can a faculty evaluation hope to
accomplish if it cannot be compulsory and it cannot
be reviewed by anyone other than the person being
evaluated? The evaluation questionnaire now in use is
the product of considerable effort by the Engineering
Council, and it is essentially a good one—that is,
it asks questions that can provide useful information
for the instructor. However, as everyone is well
aware, many faculty members fail to allow their students
to evaluate them. This may either be lack of concern
for the student and the quality of the instruction
he is getting or it may simply be a matter of oversight.
No matter what the reason is, there is very little
anyone can do about it because the evaluation cannot
be compulsory. The best that can be hoped for is that
the administration and department chairmen will
strongly and repeatedly suggest that the faculty
members pass out the evaluation forms in their classes.
It might also prove useful to give the forms to every
faculty member for every class he teaches and, in
this indirect manner, suggest that he should allow
the students to evaluate him.
Many students in favor of a compulsory evaluation
will strongly disagree with the opinions set forth here,
but they will find it difficult to explain how they will
put a compulsory evaluation into effect. It seems
the students have no course of action but to accept the
evaluation as it now stands and be satisfied with
giving clear and honest criticism that they feel their
instructors will find useful. The conscientious teachers
will thank you for pointing out the minor flaws in
their methods of instruction. And, hopefully, the
not-so-conscientious ones, if they hear the same valid
criticisms often enough, will have enough professional
pride to correct their mistakes.

Traveling Wave Masers
RCA's recent maser research and development
has yielded systems with outstanding low-noise
microwave amplifier performance along with
adaptability for field use. These amplifiers ex-
hibit ultra-low noise temperature (8-IO°K) and
high gain (30-40 db) with extreme gain sta-
bility. Wide tunability (up to 50';) and large
instantaneous bandwidth (up to ISO MHz)
have been achieved.
Several technique areas involved with this
work are of particular interest. Iron- and
chromium-doped rutilc (titanium dioxide) are
employed as active paramagnetic materials, in
a "meander-line" slow wave structure, provid-
ing wide bandwidth and high gain. Ferrite re-
verse isolators function to provide a high
degree of gain unidirectionality. The requisite
magnetic field is provided by a superconduct-
ing magnet within a cryogenic enclosure, and
the entire system is operated by a closed-cycle
refrigerator requiring no helium replenishment,
so that field use in radar systems, satellite com-
munications and radiometry is practical. Sec-
lionali/ed magnet structures with independent
controls permit "stagger-tuning" the maser,
so that its very high gain can be traded for
even greater bandwidth.
The illustration shows the active elements
of a maser amplifier typical of such a high-
performance system. The meander line, seen
as a zig-zag conducting path on a flexible in-
sulating sheet, goes down one side of the pump
cavity, folds over, and returns on the other
side. The cavity is the terminal portion of a
waveguide assembly, with microwave pump
energy being introduced at the other end. One
of two rutile paramagnetic crystals is shown
in close proximity to the meander line, the
ferrite isolator being on the opposite side of
the meander line and not visible. In operation,
the entire structure shown in the photograph
lies between pole faces of the superconducting
magnet, which provides a precisely controlled
and distributed transverse field, typically, of a
few thousand gauss. The assembly including
the magnet is enclosed in a chamber main-
tained at 4.2°K.
Amplifiers with performance as described
above are by no means the end. however. New
advances are in the offing through research in
areas including optical inversion (pumping),
operation at temperatures above 4.2°K, higher
frequency operation, and the use of active
materials in powder rather than single-crystal
form.

Integrated Launch Control
and Checkout Systems
for Saturn Lunar Vehicles
Highly sophisticated Saturn automatic ground
checkout and launch sequencing equipment
has been under development by RCA since
late I960 for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, Marshall Space Flight
Center. The original Saturn Ground Computer
System (SGCS) was used on the highly suc-
cessful Saturn I program: an advanced version
of the SGCS is currently being readied for the
Saturn IB and Saturn V programs. The RCA
110 computer was the heart of the Saturn I
SGCS: the RCA I10A is the heart of the
Saturn IB and Saturn V SGCS.
MTlLMk
The block diagram shows the tandem, two
computer configuration for Saturn V at Com-
plex 39, the lunar program "space port" at
NASA's Kennedy Space Center. Complex 39
is based on a mobile launch concept to gain
high efficiency in launch operations. Vehicles
are assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Build-
ing (VAB) on a Mobile Launcher structure.
After the Saturn V with its Apollo Spacecraft
is completely checked out, the vehicle in its
Launcher is transported to one of three launch
pads for a remotely controlled launch. The
computer in the Launch Control Center (LCC)
controls the activities of the "slave" computer
in the Mobile Launcher via a 250 kilobit/sec
digital data link. The configuration thus re-
mains the same for both VAB and pad opera-
tions: only the length of the data link changes.
The complex umbilical interface between the
vehicle and ground support equipment remains
undisturbed until launch. The LCC computer
controls the sequence of checkout and launch
countdown programs performed by the Mobile
Launcher computer via commands transmitted
over the data link. The "slave" computer in
turn performs the detailed testing and sequenc-
ing, performs evaluation and data compression
of test results, and transmits the data back to
the LCC computer which relays it to the cor-
rect operator for display. LCC operators can
override, via their console request keyboards,
the predetermined sequence of programs stored
in the Mobile Launcher computer or handle
unusual test situations.
In addition to conventional serial computer
functions, special parallel input/output capa-
bilities are included for control of 1008 discrete
(relay driver) outputs, monitoring of 1512 dis-
crete (contact closure) inputs, a wide range of
DC and AC analog outputs (72 in quantity),
a wide range of DC and AC analog inputs
(300 in quantity), telemetry interface, 3 internal
interval timers, several external clock inputs,
and an interface with the spaceborne computer.
In line with the developmental nature of the
total Saturn program, the role of RCA's
Saturn Ground Computer System is continu-
ing to expand in factory and static testing, as
well as launch operations, as automation tech-
niques are applied to other Saturn subsystems.

A Light Detector That Makes
Laser Communications Practical
RCA has developed a photoconductive device
that operates on an alternating current that
can sense up to 100 million changes in light
intensity per second. This is sufficient to dis-
tinguish as many as 25 separate television
programs, all carried on a single laser beam.
This major breakthrough in light detection is
extremely fast, enormously sensitive and is
responsive to the whole range of optical fre-
quencies, ranging from infra-red through the
visible spectrum to ultra-violet.
By contrast, previous means of detecting
laser light employed photoconductors operated
by direct current, photoelectric cells, semicon-
ductor photodiodes and electron photomulti-
plier tubes. The major drawbacks were that
these methods were either too slow, too in-
sensitive, or too limited to the portions of the
electromagnetic spectrum where most lasers
operate poorly, if indeed, at all.
The laser is, to state it simply, a high fre-
quency transmitter with the capacity to carry
a fantastic amount of information. The real
problem has been to develop a receiver both
fast enough and sensitive enough to detect and
process incoming information. This new device
has the sensitivity, speed and frequency range
that can make possible a practical system for
laser communications.
This radical new detector is a tiny speck-
sized piece of photoconductive material
mounted in a small cavity continuously bathed
in microwaves oscillating at 10 billion cycles
per second.
When a laser beam bearing information in
the form of intensity variations enters the
cavity, it strikes the photoconductor and frees
electrons. They, in turn, begin to oscillate
rapidly up and down within the material, in
direct response to the alternating electric field
inherent in the surrounding microwaves. These
electron oscillators control the amount of
microwave power that leaves the cavity. The
variations in the incoming light are then con-
verted to intensity variations in the outgoing
microwaves. Conventional microwave tech-
niques make it possible to process these vari-
ations. These techniques are similar to those
used in modern radar and commercial tele-
vision systems.

The Gemini flights of the United
States' have sillouetted the unfamiliar
shape of a new and valuable source of
electrical energy: the Fuel Cell.
By directly converting the chemical
energy of fuels to electrical energy, the
fuel cell tantalizes us with the possi-
bility of highly efficient electrical
power production for a wide variety
of applications.
This article defines a fuel cell and
then traces the development of the
fuel cell from its birth in 1839 to its
present role in our space program.
INTRODUCTION:
Most of the energy our civilization
uses every day comes from the chem-
ical bonds of gas, oil, and coal. But
in the process of utilizing that energy,
it wastes most of the energy. To say
the least, this is not so good.
For example, in a modern electrical
power plant a hydrocarbon fuel is
combined with oxygen: this releases
heat; this heat is used in a steam tur-
bine to produce mechanical energy;
this mechanical energy is then con-
verted to electrical energy in the gen-
erator. The final result of this series
of conversions is electrical energy at
an input-output efficiency of 35-40%.
Although the performance of the boil-
ers, turbines, and generators have been
improved over the years, the most
modern of our power plants do not
exceed this efficiency of 40%.
Likewise, well-tuned internal com-
bustion engines have attained an effi-
ciency of from 20-30% (depending on
type of engine and on the author one
chooses to believe). For the gas tur-
bine the efficiency has been estimated
at 40%.
In all of these electrical and me-
chanical power sources, the produc-
tion of heat is an intermediate step
in the total process. In such a heat
stage, the energy of the chemical bonds
of the fuel, which is stored in a highly
ordered manner, is transformed to
energy associated with great disorder
after the combustion process. The sec-
ond law of thermodynamics dictates
that most of the original energy of
the chemical bonds be discarded since
the second law says that there is a
downhill flow of energy in the uni-
verse. The maximum amount of use-
ful power that can be obtained from
the heat of combustion is that which
a Carnot engine would obtain when
operated between the temperature at
which the energy was released antl, in
general, the natural temperature of
the engine's environment. Because the
strength of materials and the econom-
ics of heat transfer necessitate the op-
erating temperatures of heat engines,
the second law says that greater than
half of the energy must be lost as
heat. Further losses result from fric-
tion.
However, the theoretical efficiency
of a fuel cell is 100% and actual oper-
ating efficiencies of present fuel cells
are from 45% to 85%, remarkably
higher than the above thermal pro-
cesses of power production. This high
efficiency is primary reason that scien-
tists and engineers and businessmen
are becoming increasingly interested
in the development of the fuel cell.
In the future, the use of fuel cells
should afford substantial fuel savings
and, at least in some cases, a large
cut in the amount of equipment
needed because the fuel cell is a direct
energy converter which has no moving
parts at all.
Because fuel cells are simple devices
which convert chemical energy into
electrical energy, there is no interme-
diate stage where heat must be ex-
pended to produce heat before produc-
ing electrical power. Thus the fuel cell
is not a heat engine and its efficiency
is not limited by the Second Law of
Thermodynamics because the fuel cell
can operate, at least in theory, at one
temperature, that is isothermally.
WHAT IS A FUEL CELL?
A fuel cell is essentially an electro-
chemical device in which the energy of
the chemical bonds of a fuel is con-
verted directly and extremely effici-
ently to electrical energy in the form
of a low voltage, direct-current. How-
ever, it can be said to resemble a
storage battery in construction. Be-
cause the fuel cell has two electrodes
seperated by an electrolyte anci the
electricity is created by chemical reac-
tion, a battery depletes its supply of
chemicals and becomes weaker and
weaker in its output. (If the battery
is a secondary battery it can be re-
charged, but its output still is not con-
stant.) In the fuel cell, on the other
hand, the chemical action that occurs
to make available the electrons is that
between the fuel and oxidizer and not
between electrodes themselves as in a
battery. Thus the electrical output will
continue as long as fuel and oxidizer
14

cell is often described as a primary
battery in which the fuel and oxidizer
are stored outside anil supplied as
needed. Although this definition refers
to the fuel cell as a battery, remember
that the fuel cell differs from the usual
battery in that the battery components
themselves, the electrodes and electro-
lytes, are not consumed in the chemi-
cal reaction as they are in a battery.
HOW DOES A FUEL CELL WORK?
The reaction in the fuel cell is a
combustion reaction and, whether the
combustion occurs in a heat engine
or a fuel cell, the principle is the same.
The difference between the combus-
tion processes in a heat engine and a
fuel cell is this: in the heat engine,
the fuel and oxidizer molecules are
directly mixed with each other and
electrons are transferred directly from
the fuel molecules to the oxidizer
molecules; in the fuel cell the fuel
molecules and oxidizer molecules are
prevented from contacting each other
directly, but the transfer of electrons
by a metallic path containing the elec-
trical load is permitted by the design
of the cell. Although there are various
types of fuel cells, they all have the
following basic design:
The fuel, which most often is in
the gaseous state, diffuses through the
porous anotle (the electrode at which
oxidation takes place) and is oxidized,
thus releasing electrons to the external
circuit. Similarly, the oxidizer diffuses
through the porous cathode (the elec-
trode at which reduction takes place)
and is reduced by the electrons which
have arrived from the anotle through
the external circuit. Fuel cells can be
designed to use many kinds of fuels
including solids, liquids or gases. Some
of the fuels that have been used are
zinc, alcohol, hydrazine, hydrogen, bu-
tane, propane, coal, and carbon mon-
oxide.
Among the various types of fuel
cells known today, probably the most
successful type has used relatively ex-
pensive fuel; hydrogen, with oxygen.
The following diagram outlines the
basic chemical processes in a hydrogen-
oxygen fuel cell.
HYDROGEN ELECTRODE
PROCESS
Hydrogen gas is introduced at the
porous fuel electrode (anode) from
the external fuel supply where it dif-
fuses to the reaction site. Now hydro-
gen in its normal condition is dia-
tomic, that is consists of a molecule
of two atoms, and is represented as H.j.
Near the reaction site, the diatomic
hydrogen becomes attached (chemi-
sorbed) to the surface of the electrode
reaction catalyst, where the molecules
of hydrogen split into two seperate
chemisorbed atoms. These individual

hydrogen atoms then diffuse a short
distance to the reaction site where
they meet hydroxyl (OH-) ions from
the electrolyte solution between the
electrodes. Here a catalyst is embedded
in the electrode walls to lower the ac-
tivation energy of the water forming
reaction, the energy level that need
be attained to initiate the reaction
process.
In the presence of the catalyst,
which is often platinum, the hydrogen
atoms combine with the hydroxyl ions
without the addition of any energy,
forming water and releasing electrons
to the electrode (anode). These elec-

At the hydrogen fuel electrode, the catalyst
plays a dual role. Besides acting to decrease
the activation energy necessary to commence
the reaction, it also serves as a bonding sur-
face upon which the hydrogen molecule
chemisorbs, splits, and migrates to the re-
action zone.

through the load to the cathode (oxy-
gen electrode where reduction takes
place) and it is this flow of electricity
through the external load that is the
useful electrical power output of the
fuel cell. Thus the following reactions
occur at the anode:
1. H2 (Free) —PL (chemisorbed)
2. H2 (chemisorbed) —»-
H (chemisorbed) -|- H (chemi-
sorbed)
3. 2H (chemisorbed) + 20H"—&gt;
2H20 -(- 2e and the net anode re-
action is H2 + 20H"—&gt;
2H20 + 2e
Note that at the anode (fuel elec-
trode where oxidation takes place) the
catalyst not only reduces the activation
energy of the reaction but acts as a
bonding surface upon which the hy-
drogen molecule chemisorbs and sep-
erates into two hydrogen atoms. In
the reaction with the hydroxyl ions,
hydrogen atoms, not molecules are
required.
Below is a sketch of the electrode
reaction site area showing that in the
pores of the electrode, the gaseous
hydrogen fuel molecules enter on one
side, are chemisorbed by the catalytic
surface (which must be large enough
to chemisorb all the entering mole-
cules) , and react with the hydroxyl
ions which enter from the other side.
For the reaction to occur the pore
must contain the point of electrochem-
ical reaction consisting of chemisorbed
particles, catalyst, electrolyte, and the
electrode. The exact location of this
reaction zone interface in the electrode
is controlled by the size of the pores,
the surface tension between the elec-
trode pore and the electrolyte, and
the relative pressures of the hydrogen
and the electrolyte. Immediately one
can see that the gas pressure must be
very well controlled or the fuel cell
will not operate properly. If the pres-
sure is too high, some or all the hy-
drogen will blow through the pore
into the electrolyte solution. On the
other hand, if the pressure is too low,
the electrolyte solution will seep into
the electrode and Hood the pores thus
covering the catalytic reaction sites
and halting or at least showing the
water-forming reaction. Generally
pressure differentials of greater than
100% must be avoided. It was this
flooding of the reaction site zone be-
cause of low fuel pressure which was
a problem for the fuel cell system of
the Gemini 5 flight.
OXYGEN ELECTRODE PROCESS
At the oxygen electrode the elec-
rons from the hydrogen electrode com-
bine with oxygen and water to form
hydroxyl ions which enter the electro-
lyte and migrate to the hydrogen elec-
trode where they react as explained
above to form water and release elec-
trons. More specifically, oxygen mole-
cules diffuse into the porous electrode
and are chemisorbed on a catalytic
bonding surface; then, still in dia-
tomic molecular form, they migrate a
short distance to the oxygen reaction
zone, where in the presence of a cata-
lyst, they combine with one water
molecule from the electrolyte, and
two electrons from the electrode to
form a perhydroxyl 02H- ion and
a hydroxyl OH- ion:
Oi (chemisorbed -f H2O + 2e &gt;
02H- 4- OH-
The hydroxyl ion is a desirable
product since it is used to replace one
of the two hydroxyl ions which are
being simultaneously consumed at the
hydrogen electrode for each molecule
of oxygen which reacts at the oxygen
electrode. The perhydroxyl ion is not
desirable since accumulation of these
ions around the oxygen electrode re-
action zone can significantly reduce
the voltage of the oxygen half-cell.

INTERFACE
To reduce the number of these per-
hydroxyl ions a catalyst is used to
split the unwanted ion into a hydroxyl
ion and a free oxygen atom. In this
manner a second hydroxyl ion is re-
leased to enter the electrolyte and an-
other oxygen atom is available for a
subsequent reaction. Not all of the
perhydroxyl ions can be eliminated,
however, so a voltage determining film
of these ions exists. The reactions
occuring at the oxygen electrode are:
1. On (free) —&gt;■ 0_&gt; (chemisorbed)
2. O2 (chemisorbed) 4 HiO + 2e
&gt; O.H- + OH-
3. 0,H &gt; OH- + O and
the net cathode reaction isi/g (02)
+ + 2e &gt; 20H-
At the oxygen electrode, the catalyst
is used to reduce the activation energy
of the reaction, to chemisorb the
oxygen atoms at the oxygen reaction
site, and to split the perhydroxyl ions
so that the cell can operate at a vol-
tage nearer to its true electrochemical
potential.
TOTAL FUEL CELL
REACTION PROCESS
In summary, the hydrogen enters
into the porous hydrogen electrode
and combines with hydroxyl ions from
the electrolyte to form water and re-
lease electrons which flow through the
external circuit to the oxygen elec-
trode. At the oxygen electrode, the
oxygen reacts with water and these
electrons to form hydroxyl ions in the
presence of the proper hydroxyl ions
to the hydrogen electrode. In order for
the electrical circuit to be complete,
these ions must be transported from
the oxygen electrode to the fuel elec-
trode. The actual migration process
involves ordinary diffusion, electro
static attraction and convection. Be-
sides being the hydroxyl ion transport
medium, the electrolyte is the supplier
of the water molecules needed for the
oxygen electrode reaction. Another ex-
tremely important function of the elec-
trolyte is to act as a barrier to prevent
the direct mixing and combustion of
the gases. The overall internal reac-
tions of the fuel cells are:
1. H2 + 20H ► 2HjO 4 2e
2. i/202 + H2O + 2e —&gt; 20H-
3. H2 4-1/202 &gt; H20
Throughout the fuel process, the
ionic equilibrium of the electrolyte is
maintained, because whenever two
hydroxyl ions are consumed at the
hydrogen electrode, two are formed
at the oxygen electrode. Moreover,
when one molecule of water is con-
sumed at the oxygen electrode, two
molecules of water are formed at the
hydrogen electrode and can either dif-
fuse into the electrolyte or into the
hydrogen, or both, depending on the
relative vapor pressures of the water
in the hydrogen and in the electrolyte.
However even if all the excess water
dissolves into the electrolyte, it will
take many hours of operation for
enough water to be absorbed to ap-
preciably dilute the electrolyte. In
more advanced fuel cells the extra
water is removed from the fuel cell.
The fuel cell heats up somewhat
because part of the energy is used to
continually keep the chemical rear-

energy. The catalyst lowers tin activa-
tion energy and therefore lowers the
amount of energy converted to heat.
The hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell is a
typical and exemplary fuel cell but
it was not the only type, nor was it
the first type.
DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY
OF THE FUEL CELL
The theory underlying fuel cells
is far from new. One hundred and
sixty five years ago, Humphrey Davy,
one of the pioneers in electrochemical
research, constructed a primitive fuel
cell that used nitric acid and carbon.
Another English scientist. Sir William
Grove, is generally considered to be
the "Father of the fuel cell." In 1839
Sir William was experimenting with
a chemical battery which he had built.
The battery used the water-forming
process of the reac tion between hydro-
gen and oxygen to produce an electric
current. Although he was primarily
concerned with the process involved
in the decomposition of water, Grove
was quick to observe that his inven-
tion, which had platinum electrodes
in contact with dilute sulfuric acid,
would cause "the permanent deflec-
tion" of a galvanometer connected to
the device. Thus we see the origins of
the fuel cell. Using twenty-six of his
(ells in series. Sir William Grove was
able to decompose water. Further-
more, he was the first person to notice-
that producing high current densities
in a gaseous fuel cell is a difficult task.
This problem is still being investi-
gated by present-day scientists and en-
gineers. Grove's insight into this prob-
lem is revealed by his statement that
"As the chemical or catalytic action
could only be supposed to take place,
with ordinary platina foil, at the line
or water mark where the liquid, gas
and platina met, the chief difficulty
was to obtain anything like a notable
surface of action."
The next recorded experimenting
with fuel cells occurred in about 188!)
or 1890. Two English chemists, Lud-
wig Mond and Carl Langer, invented
a iv pe of electrochemical device which
they actually referred to as a "fuel
cell." The output of their fuel cell
was approximately six amperes per
h-'.# However, the successful develop-
ment of the electric dynamo at this
same time diverted attention away
from the fuel cell to such an extent
that no more fuel cell research seems
to have been clone until the early
1940 s. At that time Berl studied and
reported on the peroxide mechanism
of a carbon-oxygen electrode. Then in
Germany, fusti worked with carbon
electrodes but reported that the sur-
face-of-action problem was critical and
started the very important research of
porous metallic electrodes. World
War II gave impetus to fuel cell re-
search. Francis T. Bacon of the De-
partment of F.ngineering of Cam-
bridge University in England started
fuel cell research as early as 1932. An-
other contributor to fuel cell research
has been the makers of Evereadv
Batteries, National Carbon, which
started its fuel cell research in the
1930s. It was not until after World
War II, however, that Bacon or Na-
tional Carbon disclosed any important
advances in fuel cell technology.
In 1950 only a very little research
was being conducted on fuel cells.*
National Carbon disclosed in 1958
diat they had a working fuel cell
which used elec trodes of porous car-
bon tubes and hydrogen as a fuel
with oxygen for the oxidizer. Their
fuel cell could also run on the much
cheaper fuel, cook gas, and use ordi-
nary air for the oxidizer. Using the
cheaper fuel and oxidant was a sig-
nificant advance.
1959 was the year when fuel cell
research blossomed. In England, the
faithful researcher of fuel cells, Fran-
cis T. Bacon (yes, a descendant of
the famous Francis Bacon) gave the
first demonstration of a really prac-
tical fuel cell. His unit used hydrogen
as the fuel and oxygen for the oxidizer
with a nickel catalyst. Whereas a com-
mon lead automobile battery pro-
duces about ten watts per pound, his
"Hydrox" Bacon cell produced 150
watts of power per pound. With an
output of 2t/2 kilowatts, the Bacon
fuel cell operated at a temperature
of 100 degrees F to speed the reaction,
and at a gaseous fuel pressure of 400-
600 pounds per square inch to speed
the diffusion process. The total effi-
ciency of the fuel cell was not 20% or
30%, but 70%. In this same year
Allis-Chalmers Corporation of Mil-
waukee, Wise, produced a full size
working tractor that used fuel cells
producing 15 kilowatts of power. Per-
haps the most significant fact about
the tractor was that it operated at
normal low temperatures and pres-
sure and used a conventional fuel,
propane. The tractor was developed
by a twenty man team.
From 1959 to 1961 the number of
researchers in the area of fuel cells
has increased rapidly. In the United
States of America alone there were
over 50 companies actively engaged
in fuel cell research by 1961. Among
them was Battelle Memorial Insti-
tute of Columbus. Ohio, an inde-
pendent research foundation, which
was (and still is) conducting fuel
oil investigations for more than forty
companies. These forty sponsors rep-
resent the oil, chemical, electrical,
electronics, automotive, transporta-
tion, aircraft, public utilities, engine,
and power plant industries. Battelle's
fuel cell research supplements, rather
than replaces, fuel cell studies being
carried on by individual companies
and by the Federal government. Be-
cause of Federal government spon-
sorship given around 1961 many uni-
versities, government installations,
nonprofit organizations and private
industries have been probing for a
better understanding of basic electro-
chemical processes, and have been
evaluating applications of fuel cells
to space vehicle electric power sys-
tems, and fuel cell power plants of
many different types have been and
are being fabricated and evaluated.
Among the many fuel cell research-
ers who were active from 1959 to
1961 was the General Electric Com-
pany. In 1960, Dr. Herman A. Lieb-
hafsky of the General Electric Re-
search Laboratory predicted that fuel
cells would be capable of powering an
automobile by 1963. No such car has
been built, but it seems that one prob-
ably could have been constructed
since Allis-Chalmers Corporation had
a working tractor as early as 1959
and a working golf cart by 1962 or
earlv 1963. The General Electric re-
searchers were not alone in their in-
* Mond and Langer had problems with the
reaction speed catalyst, which "poisoned"
quickly and ruined the fuel cell.
* In England, Francis T. Bacon was working
for the Electrical Research Association on the
high-pressure hydrogen oxygen Bacon system.
In Germany. Professor J list i. the inventor
and physicist, had started to develop the fir«r
Raney nickel D.S.K. metal defect fuel cell
electrodes.
In the U.S.S.R., Davtyan; in England, Cham
bcrs; in the United States, Gorin; and in Hol-
land, Ketelaar, were investigating the use of
high temperature carbonaceous fuel cells with
fused salt electrolytes.
In 1958 only a few companies in the United
States were very actively investigating the fuel
cell. These were National Carbon, Leesona,
General Electric, Aerojet, and Consolidation
Coal. The United States Navy and the United
States Army Signal Corps had .started a small
fuel cell research program.

With all
the companies
making the same promises,
how do you tell
the difference?
It is difficult! Perhaps the best and only way is to study the com-
pany carefully—to see if its structure, range and operational
modes permit it to make good its promises. If you scrutinize
Sylvania Electronic Systems, you'll discover a number of sal-
ient facts that may help clarify the matter for you.
Note first that Sylvania employs the small group form of or-
ganization—within its nationwide complex of research and de-
velopment groups, manufacturing plants and world-wide field
engineering operation. This makes swift individual progress
and development possible within a wide choice of current in-
house projects.
Note particularly the diversity and breadth of SES projects.
You may advance in a technical or administrative capacity in
any of these areas: ground electronics equipment for Minute-
man missile sites...research and development in electronic
warfare field...electronic security systems...
ASW systems...special purpose airborne com-
puters for incorporation into U.S. Air Force large
scale electronic systems...laser systems...de-
sign of spaceborne electronic and optical systems...plus
world wide engineering support systems.
Note that SES has worked out three distinct routes for ad-
vancement, all with equal rewards—technical specialist, tech-
nical manager, program/project manager.
Finally, note how SES encourages ambitious individuals to
accelerate their development through participation in Division-
wide conferences, in-plant courses and seminars and post-
graduate study plans conducted on an unusually generous
scale.
The success of the SES mission—to manage government'
systems programs for General Telephone &amp; Electronics, the
parent corporation—depends on the professional and intellec-
tual growth of its personnel. In every respect, SES has created
an environment to foster that growth. Be sure that any prospec-
tive employer you consider has established a
growth climate of like specifications.
Making promises is one thing. Making progress
another.

STAKE
IN
ENGINEERING
EDUCATION
by
G. V. EDMONSON
ASSOCIATE DEAN
This presentation was made by
Glenn V. Edmonson, Associate Dean,
College of Engineering, The Univer-
sity of Michigan at the General Elec-
tric Co. Seminar on April 13-H, 1965,
in Cincinnati, Ohio. The seminar
focused on "Engineers in Modern
Manufacturing Industry." What bet-
ter place is there to start than with
the education of an engineer? The
underlying thesis of this presentation
is that industry, which supports our
national economy, needs engineers
throughout its entire system who have
been trained to an advanced level
and who arc motivated to accept the
heavy technical and social responsi-
bilities of an engineering career.
There is growing concern, however,
among industrial executives and
some educators that the supply of
trained technical talent prepared to
accept these responsibilities is de-
creasing at a time when the demand
for such talent is greater than at any
time in history. Of equal concern to
many is the apparent reluctance on
the part of a large segment of the
present management in industry to
encourage the young engineer to use
the advanced concepts and methods
with which he is familiar and which
are applicable to the task assigned
him. These are the concerns upon
which attention is being focused.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Industry functions in a large, inter-
acting, complex society. Its survival
and its continuing ability to con-
tribute to that society are based upon
its ability to make a profit. Decisions
by management of an enterprise must
be socially acceptable, technologically
progressive, however feasible, and
economically sound. If, for the mo-
ment, the necessary hierarchy of cor-
porate organization may be set aside,
a view of a continuous spectrum of
technical and economic responsibility
emerges. Throughout the spectrum
attention can be focused on positions
requiring an engineer with a broad,
but advanced, technological educa-
tion. These positions are found from
the level of fledgling engineer to top
management.
The concern of industrial manage-
ment stems from the apparent lim-
ited usefulness of many young engi-
neers. The young man or woman
frequently takes more than the nor-
mal time in passing through the in-
terface between academic pursuits
and industrial productivity. The re-
sult is mutual dissatisfaction on both
the part of the employer and the em-
ployee. This dissatisfaction seems to
grow out of the lack of recognition
that the young engineer displays for
the corporate objective of profitabil-
ity. Profitability entails an under-
standing of topics such as economics,
productivity, corporate organization
and personnel development, public
responsibility, and short and long
range corporate goals. Of course, this
problem does not exist for each grad-
uate who enters industry; however,
the incident occurs often enough that
an attempt to understand it is sug-
gested.
The young engineer that is most
often sought after by industry is the
same young man, who, by virtue of
his past academic and extracurricular
performance, is also the person eligi-
ble to continue his education beyond
the first terminal point of the bach-
elor's degree. Approximately 90%
of those eligible to enter upon ad-
vanced training do so. Only 10% of
this group, who by all measures yet
devised give the most promise of early
success, are available to industry at
the completion of the undergraduate
program. Industry is therefore bound
to give consideration to young engi-
neers with advanced academic prep-
aration.
EDUCATION-1965
In view of the dissatisfactions over
the limited usefulness of the young
engineer that have been voiced from
many quarters, it seems in order to
briefly examine the changes that have
taken place in engineering education
and to determine the general guid-
ance provided the student in the pres-
ent degree programs.
In the last twenty years there have
been marked changes in educational
programs. The undergraduate pro-
grams have been extensively revised,
while both the master's and the doc-
tor's degree programs have developed
from specially planned programs for
the occasional student to definite, de-
finable programs in which a large
number of students are enrolled.
These changes were the result of two
pressures. The first was awareness that
the engineering graduate was unable
to cope with the more complex prob-
lems found in a rapidly advancing
industrial technology. Increased pow-
er, increased demands for precision,
and the need for a high degree of re-
liability, made the consideration of
the curriculum change the first order
of importance. The need for addi-
tional background in mathematics,
physics and chemistry was clearly
demonstrated. Curriculum changes
therefore provided for a deeper pen-
etration in these sciences. These
changes were followed by other course
changes that took advantage of the
mathematics, physics and chemistry
preparation the student had acquired.
Certain manual arts and survey
courses have been omitted. The end
result is the rigorous engineering ed-
ucational program of today.
Secondly, the rapid advance in tech-
nology has been accompanied by very
sophisticated aids in problem solving,
the computer being one of the most
widely accepted by industry. Prior to
the computer, the solution of many
complex problems would have been
considered economically unsound,
but today, these problems are being
solved. Educational programs in engi-
neering now provide instruction in
the use of the computer. The ability
of present engineering students to
solve complex technological problems
is thus greatly enhanced over that of
former students because of their abil-
ity to use this important aid to engi-
neering. The program changes and
additions, the new sophisticated
methods, and the very rapid accumu-
lation of teachable advanced techno-
logical information have influenced
the qualified student to continue his
education beyond the bachelor's de-
gree.
Bachelor's degree programs are gen-
erally overflowing with the necessary
science and mathematics preparatory
subjects. These subjects are usually
compartmentalized, and, in many in-
stitutions, organizationally and physi-
cally removed from engineering. Ap-
plications of these topics, however, are
demonstrated by engineering educa-
tors in the engineering sciences as
well as in the very few first techno-
logical subjects that are included in
undergraduate programs. At the same
time, only limited opportunities are
available in those programs that per-
mit the student to gain insight into
the social sciences and the humanities.
Although the engineer may claim that
economic considerations are one of
the distinctive characteristics of the
profession, economics as a topic has
been treated in undergraduate pro-
grams in only a cursory fashion. This
is usually a minimum exposure to
classical economic theory.
Master's degree programs as pres-
ently structured offer little opportun-
ity for breadth of education. At least
fifty percent of each program is spe-
cified to be in the departmental spe-
cialty, a varying fraction of the pro-
gram is to be completed in advanced
science and mathematics, and the re-
mainder, the smallest fraction, in cog-
nate subjects taken with the approval
of the program advisor. Some of the
students, upon entering the master's
program, consider it terminal and en-
roll in scattered compartmentalized
courses outside the specialty. Usually
those who consider the possibility of
continuing beyond the master's degree
(approximately 35%, who receive a
master's degree do continue their aca-
demic training) realize the necessity
of continued effort in the sciences.
They are aware that they must satisfy
the requirement of an original in-
vestigation and thesis contribution as
partial fulfillment of the doctor's de-
gree. Therefore, they avoid classifica-
tions in subjects that would be
important to the engineer establishing
himself in industry.
The student enrolled in a doctor's

work recommended to him by an
advisory committee from the engineer-
ing speciality in which he is enrolled.
Later he enters that course recom-
mended by an appointed doctoral
committee that is specifically con-
cerned that he become familiar with
topics which will enhance his capa-
bility to fulfill the investigation and
thesis requirement. The advanced
engineering educational opportunities
presently available to the qualified
student are all research-oriented. This
advanced student, considering his total
ac ademic preparation, is relatively less
prepared to accept many industrial
responsibilities than the bachelor's
degree student. Thus since there are
many technical assignments in in-
dustry other than research, new educa-
tional opportunities are indicated.
Before considering any new educa-
tional programs, the change in rela-
tionship between society and industry
and, in turn, the engineer upon whom
attention is directed must be ex-
amined in the same twenty years over
which engineering educational pro-
grams have changed. There has been a
pronounced shift in the behavior of
industry. There is now widespread
insistence that corporations be com-
petent to evaluate the social problems
with which they deal and to recognize
the social forces which they create.
The social consciousness that is in-
cumbent upon corporate management
must, likewise, be shared by the engi-
neer. He cannot escape this responsi-
bility. The engineer has the opportuniy
to emerge as an important, influential
person in our domestic economy. He
must know and understand the results
of scientific research, but be motivated
to use these results, and his ability to
apply mathematics, the phyical and
natural sciences, and one or more of
the engineering arts to demonstrate
technical and economic feasibility of
the design of new or improved sys-
tems, products, and processes for the
benefit of the society in which he lives.
Thus the total technological task as-
signed to the engineer is broad and
demanding. Many economic decisions
require technical judgments. The en-
gineer must make judgment of prod-
ucts and processes suggested by rele-
vant research information as they
afreet the corporate objective of profit-
ability, and also as they may have an
etiect on society and upon natural
resources. A flourishing economy and
a vast research capability are welded
together through the engineer. Deter-
minations of capital expenditure, re-
turn on investment, and depreciation
are made from the engineer's estimate
of the time interval before technical
obsolescence in the market takes place.
Further, the engineer can no longer
confine his plans to a domestic market,
fnternational business activity re-
quires that he extend his total knowl-
edge to the needs of a world society.
Along with this understanding, the
engineer must master and use many
new technological developments and
methods. For instance, technically
sound automated processes are less
than satisfactory if economically
doubtful or socially unacceptable. The
philosophy of optimization of multi-
ple parameter systems must be prac-
tised with diligence. Reliability has
come to mean more than the measure
of a fail-safe characteristic of a com-
ponent, fnstead, the engineer under-
stands reliability as a probabilistic
measure of a time-dependent continu-
ing function of a man-machine sys-
tem. A high order of reliability which
is the first of several important inter-
ests of the engineer is, likewise,
important to the profit objective.
These are a few of many technically
involved problems to be found in an
industrial enterprise that are of con-
cern to the engineer. The engineer
trained to participate in the decisions
and accept the responsibilities as in-
dicated is needed in industry. His
technical understanding must be at
the same or higher level than his
counterpart in research. In addition,
his educational background must in-
clude those areas of knowledge that
fit him for the broad responsibilities
of a technologically-orientated society.
THE NEW DIMENSION
A new dimension in engineering
education is emerging. The bases for
all engineering educational programs
up to this time are mathematics, phy-
sics, chemistry, and the engineering
sciences. Although the name designa-
tion of these disciplines remains, little
beyond the name is identifiable in
either content or approach to the
topics when compared with the teach-
ing of these disciplines twenty years
ago. The sciences have not only pro-
vided the engineer with an increased
power of understanding of the physi-
cal world, they have assembled rela-
tionships that provide him with a
continuous spectrum of foundation
knowledge. The common language of
mathematics spans the entire spec-
trum. The several engineering spe-
cialties (chemical engineering, electri-
cal engineering, mechanical engineer-
ing, etc.) are organized around one
of the physical sciences, or some por-
tion thereof, and have accordingly
established their identity. In each
case, the speciality penetrates farther
into that science associated with its
identity than other specialities. Fur-
ther, each of the educational programs
in engineering has integrated the
compartmentalized sciences and math-
ematics into the technology of the
specialty and has accordingly brought
about a balanced understanding at
all academic levels. A philosophical
approach to the solution of problems,
frequently referred to as the engineer-
ing method, has emerged from the
balanced understanding the engineer
has for the relation of the physical
sciences and mathematics. He is pre-
pared to solve complex technological
problems.
To academically prepare the engi-
neer for the position of total responsi-
bility and influence which is expected
of him in this technological age the
underlying disciplines of economics,
psychology,political and social sc ience,
and anthropology likewise need to be
included into the bases of engineering
educational programs. As in the case
of the physical sciences and mathe-
matics, these disciplines must likewise
become a part of the philosophy of
the engineering method. As the engi-
neering student progresses in the pro-
gram of his choice these bases will find
substance in such studies as engineer-
ing costs, product and market accepta-
bility, advanced economics, engineer-
ing and management systems, and
finance.
While this focuses upon the engi-
neer who has completed advanced
technical training, it is apparent that
the total bases for this new dimension
must be introduced in the undergrad-
ate preparation of the engineer in the
same way that the presently accepted
bases are introduced. Although the
level of understanding on the part
of the student at any point is con-
tingent upon the pre-college under-
standing that parents and secondan
teachers and counselors have for tin-
total needs of the professional engi-
neer, the advanced level of training
of the engineering student is accom-
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Great care must be exercised in
planning engineering educational pro-
grams that include this new dimen-
sion. The young engineer's attention
must not be diverted from his basic
motivation of preparing for and ac-
cepting the responsibilities associated
with an engineering career. There are
distinct advantages in an integrated
curriculum development of the scien-
tific-technological and the humanistic-
social sequences. For instance, the
over-lay of compartmentalized econ-
omic topics onto a terminal level of
engineering training tends to direct
the attention of the student to corpor-
ate staff functions. There is no ques-
tion of the need for staff functions
in industry; however, staff functions
are not required in an enterprise har-
boring an unsuccessful in-line engi-
neering activity. An engineering activ-
ity based upon sound application of
the engineering method is a require-
ment of this technological age.
A new concept in engineering
education needs to be discovered that
will allow for the introduction and
use of the new dimension. The engi-
neering function "design" defined to
include the problems of the real
world may be the concept upon which
the addition can be built. The func-
tion of "design", as used, encompasses
the creation of the component part,
the synthesis of the engineering sys-
tem, the process, the operating engi-
neering and management system, and
those other broad considerations of an
engineering analysis which contribute
to the overall objective, profitability.
The effort and expense required to
develop this "design" concept in an
academic program are economically
sound. There is an obvious limit. An
educational institution cannot accept
the responsibility of teaching young
engineers the details of a specific
enterprise and information which is
a matter of proprietary rights. On the
other hand, industry cannot afford to
establish an in-house educational op-
eration to provide its employees with
engineering philosophy that can be
taught in an educational institution.
The level of academic sophistication
that a student has acquired to focus
on the "design" problem is a function
of the time he has spent in training,
the quality of faculty in the institu-
tion, and the inherent ability of the
student and his student associates.The
understanding that a student acquires
for the relation between the prepara-
tory program and its use in profes-
sional activity is almost entirely de-
pendent upon a faculty philosophy
of the engineering method. At any
level there are real engineering "de-
sign" problems of current interest that
are widely representative of the de-
mands of the immediate and future
technology in which the engineer will
participate. These problems are aca-
demically challenging and education-
ally revealing to both the student and
industry. Close relationships between
students, faculty, and industry need
to be established and maintained.
The first of the two concerns out-
lined at the beginning of this article
may be satisfied when advanced tech-
nical educational opportunities as
discussed become a reality. The second
concern today is that the young engi-
neer may not be encouraged to use the
advanced concepts and methods with
which he is familiar. A discussion of
theory versus the practice of engineer-
ing usually finds a place close to this
concern. The number of times that
advanced methods proposed by the
engineer are down-graded by man-
agement is sufficiently frequent to
warrant consideration.
Technical literature is replete with
references to theory versus practice in
the profession of engineering. The
word "practical" finds its way into the
discussion of the performance capa-
bility of the young engineer on many
occasions. Within this literature and
in the thinking of some people an
apparent dichotomy exists which
starts to develop at the interface be-
tween academic training and indus-
trial participation. While it is true
that the function of the academic
institution is to provide an opportun-
ity for preparatory training and the
function of industry is to provide
society with economic goods and serv-
ices, one would anticipate a normal
progression of transition and a com-
plete carry-over of applicable informa-
tion. The tangle of opinion is further
complicated by an arbitrary assign-
ment of industrial positions to the
several levels of academic training by
both management and educators that
are quite inconsistent with the econ-
omic responsibility of the positions.
Research assignments are linked to
advanced degree students; design and
operation, to bachelor's degree stu-
dents. Is there a possible explanation
for the undercurrent surrounding the
world "practical" as well as the ten-
dency to relate academic level without
regard to industrial responsibility
particularly as that responsibility is
associated with the turn-over of cur-
rency in an enterprise?
The engineer has always accepted
a high order of responsibility in the
conduct of his work. The design of a
ship not only involved large expendi-
tures but human life rested upon the
stability of the design. Buildings are
designed and constructed to shelter
people and their activities. They must
withstand the projected maximum
loads, the extreme elements, and con-
tinue in use for long periods of time.
Contrasted with the scientist, the en-
gineer has not been privileged in most
cases to postulate a probable result,
construct a theoretical model and a
confirming experiment, nor had the
opportunity to reconstruct his theory
and model upon new experimental
evidence or failure. The engineer in-
stead has discharged his responsibili-
ties utilizing the arts of the profession,
proven practices, good judgment, in-
tuition and the experimental method
when possible. Theoretical modelling
has not been widely used in the prac-
tice of engineering because the solu-
tions resulting from the required
simplification of non-linear, multivari-
able descriptive equations of actual
designs were frequently so far removed
from experimental data that the con-
fidence level in the model was very
low, thus negating its attractiveness
except as an academic exercise. As a
result, when the economic considera-
tions permitted, the experimental
method was used.
The experimental design, test, test
evaluation, and the experimental ana-
log have continued to play a predom-
inant role in product and process de-
velopment. Many important problem
solutions that are perfectly valid for
further use have resulted from the
above method, Perhaps these consid-
erations provide one possible expla-
nation of the apparent dichotomy
between theory and practice and the
association of the engineer with a
lower level of training to design. Re-
pealed use of the experimental me-
thod and the accompanying exercise
of intuitive judgment have certainly
played an important part in enginer-
ing practice.

YOU'LL WANT TO HAVE THESE FACTS ABOUT SANDERS
WHAT IS THERE TO KNOW ABOUT SANDERS
You don't have to spend much time in industry to learn that
Sanders' growth and technical achievements are near models in
the technical community. Eleven brilliant engineer-founders led
the company in just 15 years to its position today—with a per-
sonnel roll of around 4,000 in 4 plants. The corporate sales fig-
ure has nearly tripled in the last 4 years—to over $59 million
in fiscal '65.
YOU'LL THINK HARD AT SANDERS
Obviously; a lot of hard thinking put the remarkable rise in
Sanders* growth curve. As a weapons systems company, Sanders
focuses this thinking on aggressive innovations rather than re-
lying on traditional concepts in order to speed the development-
to-delivery cycle, and to achieve total-mission reliability. As a
technical and business philosophy, this freedom to break with
conventional methods of doing things has fostered a creative
climate where original ideas multiply, professional knowledge
expands and individual advancement is accelerated.
The graduating engineer who seeks a place at the threshold of
state-of-the-art should be aware that Sanders pioneers contin-
uously in advanced areas of radar and phased array, missile
guidance, communications, ASW/oceanography, ECM, tactical
limited warfare, information display and data processing, data
storage, ground support, navigational aids, instruments, test
equipment, microwave and high density packaging.
A PLAN TO HELP YOU KEEP ON GROWING
Most important to your professional development is your asso-
ciation with men who can display technical "firsts." These arc
seasoned men who encourage you to similar accomplishment
and who urge you to speak your mind freely. As one Sanders
engineer puts it, "Channels of technical communication arc
wide open here."
Another spur to professional development is the liberal pre-paid
tuition program for advanced study at well regarded universities
near all Sanders* plant locations. And, too, a growing number
of top calibre in-plant courses are offered.

PROGRESS
Out of today's multitude of new
plastic materials have come the syn-
thetic reinforced plastics. An ob-
server's first reaction to the synthetic
fabric reinforced plastics is that they
are "just like fiberglass" but, as will
be illustrated, this resemblance ends
with the manner of application. They
may serve both as a protective cover-
ing of the basic strength members of
hulls, or as basic strength materials in
themselves. For the small craft de-
signer weary of "stickum" these ma-
terials are an improvement over can-
vas covering for hulls of all sizes. To
the designer experienced in glass re-
inforced plastics they will mean im-
proved impact and abrasion resist-
ance.
BASIC FIBERS AND FABRICS
Any of the many synthetic fibers
presently on the market may be used
as reinforcements. A few, such as
polypropylene, Dacron, and Dynel,
have shown exceptional promise, but
none of them has all of the good
properties of the others in specific
applications. The basic properties of
polypropylene, Dacron, and Dynel
will he examined here to the extent
that the reader will be able to decide
which fiber will best meet a specific
application.
First of all, polypropylene is pro-
duced in two basic forms, a square
weave fabric and a felt. The fabric
has belter mechanical properties than
the felt. Fabric is the only polypropy-
lene material currently being used in
small craft, but felts and mats have
some attractive properties. At present
there is only one producer of these
polypropylene fabrics for marine use.
He manufactures a 4-ounce fabric
dimensionally similar to 10-ounce
glass roving. The wetting out of these
fabrics compares favorably with that
of glass fabrics, and their drapability
is far superior. Mats and felts in some
instances can perform services out of
reach of fabrics. Some companies have
been experimenting with polypropy-
lene mat for covering decks and ply-
wood hulls. These mats resemble glass
mats, and if a hull could be construct-
ed entirely of polypropylene rein-
forced plastics, they could be used in
the same manner as in fiberglass con-
struction. These mat products are not
on the market yet, but when they do
arrive they should be inexpensive, yet
excellent for covering developable
surfaces.
Polypropylene felt is another inter-
esting product. This felt is dense yet
springy and saturates easily with
resins. A felt of this type, about T\T
inch thick, makes an effective gasket
material for double planking. Com-
bined with a flexible epoxy or poly-
urethane resin, a double plank con-
struction superior to that obtained
with muslin and orange shellac is at-
tained. The chief advantages are com-
plete, yet non-rigid, bonding between
planks, as well as excellent water and
decay resistance.
As for the finishing of synthetic re-
inforced plastic laminates this is not
unpleasant, since the cuttings and dust
are not filled with sharp needles. Some
difficulty may be had in sanding poly-
propylene laminates if excessive pres-
sure is applied. Due to the resilience
of the fibers, they will be pulled from
the resin by a dull disc, particularly il
the laminate begins to heat up. With
finer grits and higher speeds than art-
used with glass reinforced plastics,
there is no difficulty. The only diffi-
culty with the layup polypropylene
reinforced plastics is that the fibers
will float in the resin. Therefore only
that resin which is required to satur-
ate the fibers can be used. A smooth
surface can only be achieved by ap-
plying a finish coat to the hardened
laminate.
Stress-strain curves reveal the prop-
erties which make polypropylene re-
inforced plastics stand out from the
other reinforced plastics. The initial
failure, noted as the proportion.il
limit, is the point where the binding
resin begins to crack or pull awa\
from the polypropylene fibers. At thi-
point in the stressing of the laminate,
shear between the plies of fabric max
develop and the passage of water as a
liquid, rather than a vapor, will oc-
cur. It has been noted that when a
polypropylene reinforced laminate
stressetl to its proportional limit, the
flaws originate where the fibers run
perpendicular to the applied stres&gt;
This means a breakdown of the bom:
between the resin and reinforcing fir&gt;
ers. In all samples tested to date,
there has been a whitening of the
26
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


laminate increasing steadily with in-
creased stress. This indicates a yield-
ing of the reinforcement from the
binding resin even below the stress
which causes initial rupture. This
whitening, which takes place only
around fibers running perpendicular
to the applied stress, is temporary at
low stresses. It has long been known
that adhesion of thermosetting resins
to low density thermoplastics, such as
polypropylene and polyethylene, is
poor.
Some research has shown that the
adhesion of most thermosetting resins
to polypropylene is better than to
treated glass, but this does not mean
that the failure of the laminate
should be due to the failure of the
reinforcement, as is the case with
glass. On the contrary, the deflections
at yield of a polypropylene reinforced
plastic are not so great, the failure
of the laminate must be due to the
separation of the resin from the rein-
forcement.
The greatest attribute of poly-
propylene reinforced plastic is that,
although the laminate may fail and
not be watertight, it can still carry a
load. As is shown in the stress strain
curves, the load carrying capacity of a
laminate continues to increase as the
laminate is reduced from a rigid solid
to a lose cloth webbing. The ultimate
elongation of a polypropylene web-
bing is better than 20 per cent. In
effect, a hull covered with a poly-
propylene reinforced plastic is sur-
rounded by a continuous crack ar-
resting strap. The high elongation of
the webbing gives excellent shock re-
sistance, while its fibrous nature gives
excellent fatigue properties.
All of the low density thermo-
plastics have little resistance to creep
at normal temperature. (Creep being
the slow distortion after exposure to
prolonged stress.) Polypropylene re-
inforced plastics thus have low creep
strengths. Because of this low long
term load carrying capacity, large
structures made entirely out of poly-
propylene reinforced plastics are out
of the question. At any time, however,
there is the chance of permanent de-
formation and breakage. After failure
due to the breakdown of the resin to
fiber bond, repair by use of low visco-
sity resins is possible. Future experi-
mentation will be required to deter-
mine how well given resins will pene-
trate the voids. If saturation methods
prove successful, quick repairahility
will put polypropylene reinforced
plastics high on the list of small craft
construction materials.
Another product, Dynel fiber, has
been used successfully for over five
years in small craft construction. The
fiber may be obtained in three basic
forms, spun cloth, mat, and felt. All
three forms, when combined with a
flexible thermosetting resin, yield a
highly impact and abrasion resistant
laminate. Dynel fabrics which are
being used in the small trait industry
are all of the spun yarn type. The
open nature of this weave gives quick
saturation, even when using high
viscosity resins. Another advantage of

drapability which permits covering a
hull from one end to the other with a
continuous run of cloth. Sections such
as bulbous keels and rounded bows
present few problems. Dynel mats
have been used for many years in the
plastics industry to improve the abra-
sion, impact, and chemical resistance
of all types of reinforced laminates
having developable surfaces. These
materials have not been used to any
extent in the marine industry even
though they can do away with costly
gell coats on many items. Also Dynel
felts can be used successfully in mold-
ed structures where compound curves
art not severe. The felts have the ad-
vantage that they can be deformed by
hand to fit most curves in a structure
too severe for the mats. The prime
disadvantage of the felts is that a high
pressure molding process is necessary
to insure high fiber concentration.
The open weave of Dynel fabrics
permits quick saturation, but at the
same time, the rough surface which
results is difficult to smooth up if a
glossy finish is desired. The laminate
may be cleaned up somewhat by
washing off the surface fibers with
solvents, but sanding is still required
to complete the operation. A good
finish on Dynel often is not obtained
until the third finish coat. The coarse-
ness of a Dynel fabric reinforced plas-
tic is ideal for non-skid decking. The
sulfate is rough, but not abrasive like
a resin and pumice surface. If a pig-
ment is added to the laminating
resin, a Dynel deck will keep its ap-
pearance for many seasons of hard
wear. Reports have shown that a
Dynel doth non-skid surface, when
applied to a sound structure with flex-
ible resins, will last twice as long as
glass reinforced plastics coated with
pumice and resin. In fact, Dynel mat
products tan be used successfully on
developable surfaces such as plywood
hulls and decks at less cost than pos-
sible with the cloth due to the marked
reduction in finishing time. Many lay-
ers of felt are required to give a cov-
ering of equal impact strength to that
of a cloth covering, however, butts
and overlaps are not a problem. Only
one finish coat is required with the
mats. However, Dynel felt can be used
only under pressure. Thus it must be
restricted to molding operations and
gasketing lor double planking. Only
resins of high flexibility such as the
poly in ethanes can be used with Dynel
felt for double planking, and Dynel
combined with resins of high rigidity
is notch sensitive.
Dynel reinforcements, like poly-
propylene reinforcements, will float
in the laminating resins. A Dynel
laminate will remain suspended in a
viscous resin even though the specific
gravity of the fiber is well above that
of the resin. The adhesion of thermo-
setting resins to Dynel is complete. As
a result of this good adhesion, a crack
originating in the resin binder will
propagate rapidly through the Dynel
fibers. Spun yarn laminates are par-
ticularly notch sensitive due to the
large spacing between the fibers, and
the fracture is a result of this notch
sensitivity. Thus, use of Dynel rein-
forcements should be avoided on
structures which work. If it is neces-
sary to cover a hull which has
loosened up, only the most flexible
resins can be used.
The yield and tensile strengths of
polypropylene and Dynel reinforced
laminates are low with respect to
their weight. To attain a laminate
with high tensile and yield strengths,
a fiber of high strength and modulus
of elastivity is required. Dacron has
both high yield strength and a mod-
ulus of elasticity of about 1.7 X 10°
psi, and has been used very success-
fully as a reinforcement for thermo-
setting resins. Dacron may be ob-
tained in both fabric and felt forms,
and these Dacron fabrics come in a
variety of weights and weaves from
many companies. However, care must
be taken that a fabric used for rein-
forcement is not treated with finishes
of any kind. Hefore using a fabric it is
best that the bolt is traced back to the
mill where it was woven. Only then
can one be sure of both the finish
and the strength of the fibers. Then,
also, Dacron felts may be obtained,
but in general the low tensile
strengths of the fibers used make them
unsuitable for structural use. On the
other hand, felts can be used success-
fully as gaskets for double plank con-
struction.
While Dacron has not become a
popular reinforcement in indusin
because its physical characteristics are
similar to those of many natural
fibers, for the small craft designer
dacron has the advantage of more
predictable properties than the nat-
ural fibers. Unfortunately, the abra-
sion resistance of a Dacron reinforced
laminate is not as good as that of
Dynel, but it is much better than that
of glass or polypropylene. The last-
ing quality of a Dacron reinforced
laminate both above and below the
waterline is assured by the low mois-
ture absorption of the fibers, as well
as the good adhesion of thermosetting
resins. Also, the capacity of Dacron
reinforced plastics to carry steady
loads is excellent due to both the high
creep resistance of the fiber and the
adhesion of thermosetting resins
There is no appreciable loss of
strength in a Dacron reinforced lami-
nate clue lo prolonged submersion
Thus it is possible to construct a
Dacron reinformed hull having the
equivalent weight of a glass rein-
forced plastic hull. The high flexibil-
ity and low weight of the laminate
make possible high speed hulls hav-
ing exceptional impact resistance,
provided that large deflections of the
structure are not objectionable.
The author has not personally per-
formed tests to determine the phv-
sical properties of Dacron reinforced
plastics; the basic properties are well
established, however, and they are as
follows:

THERMOSETTING RESINS
The physical properties of a syn-
thetic fabric reinforced plastic are
as much affected by the properties of
the laminating resin as they are by
the properties of the fiber. Over the
past few years many boatbuilders have
used the synthetic reinforcements
only to find that they split, cracked,
and otherwise failed after only a few
seasons. Almost invariably these fail-
ures were due to the improper selec-
tion of resin.
Synthetic fibers are by nature flex-
ible. Using resins of high rigidity (as
are sold to the marine trade for glass
reinforced laminates) has cost boat-
builders and owners a considerable
sum over the past few years. Before
the selection of a resin is made, the
builder or designer must write to
many companies for their brochures
and recommendations. Every repu-
table company the author has dealt
with has willingly supplied whatever
advice and information necessary to
insure that their product will be
used properly.
Three basic thermosetting resins
are at present the most suitable for
use with synthetic fiber reinforce-
ments. The polyesters, and to a lesser
extent the epoxies, have been given
wide use by the small craft industry.
The third, the polyurethanes, show
good potential as laminating resin,
but to date their use in the marine
industry has been restricted to marine
Finishes and caulking compounds. A
rapid increase in the use of the poly-
urethanes over the next few years is
inevitable.
Polyester has found a permanent
home in the glass reinforced plastics
industry due to the low cost, non-
critical working conditions, and ease
of application. Part of its popularity
may be due to its being one of the
first thermosetting resins used in the
industry. When polyester is used with
glass reinforcements the results are
good, but such is not necessarily the
case when they are used with the syn-
thetics. For these polyesters to be suit-
able for synthetic reinforcements,
they must be a combination of the
flexible and rigid resins. As the flexi-
bility of a rigid polyester is increased
through the admixture of the flexible
polyesters, the other physical proper-
ties such as hardness, creep resistance,
and tensile strength are reduced dis-
proportionally. An ultimate elonga-
tion of 7 per cent or more is required
for all of the synthetic reinforcements.
When the polyesters are formulated
to this degree of flexibility they are
soft in comparison to other laminat-
ing resins. The use of suc h polyesters
should be restricted to structures not
subjected to direct impact or point
loadings. This means confining their
use to the covering of bulkheads,
transoms, some decks and the inner
skins of hulls.
Another disadvantage of polyester
is the poor adhesion of this resin to
wood structures, particularly when
there is an appreciable oil or water
content in the wood. When construct-
ing a synthetic covered wood hull, it
is necessary then to have the moisture
content of the wood during covering
near that at which it will exist dur-
ing its life in the water. At these high
moisture contents, the adhesion of
the polyester is poor. Thus the resin
should be avoided when making
bonds to wood. This contrasts with
the adhesion of polyester to such fib-
ers as Dacron and Dynel which is ex-
cellent, but the molecular structure
of polypropylene is such that there is
an interaction between the resin and
fiber. The esters of the polyester
cause swelling of the polypropylene
fibers and a weakness in the bond be-
tween the fiber and the resin. The in-
teraction between polyester and the
polypropylene also acts to inhibit the
hardening reaction of the polyester.
It has been noted by most people
working with polypropylene reinforce-
ments that more catalyst than usual
must be added in order to complete
the cure in a given amount of time.
This curing of a polyester laminate
is not complete at the point where
exotherm has ceased, and in actuality
the laminate will never completely
cure. Over many years a polyester
laminate will continue to cure, and in
doing so will become more brittle.
Polyester is affected more by radia-
tion and oxydation than most other
thermosetting resins. Thus care must
be taken to insure that the resin it-
self is protected by a pigmented
boundary such as might be attained
with paint. Unfortunately, some diffi-
culty with synthetic reinforced poly-
esters may occur due to shrinking
of the resin during cure. This shrink-
age causes locked-in tensile stresses.
Shrinkage of |x&gt;lyester resins by more
than 1 per cent during initial cure,
correspondingly reduces the potential
for elongation at yield. This shrink-
age must be compensated for by in-
creasing the flexibility of the resin.
The second group of epoxy resins
at present hold the most promise for
use with synthetic reinforcements.
With these resins a great variety of
properties may be derived with few
complications. The epoxies are capa-
ble of high elongations, yet they re-
tain their hardness. Epoxies can also
be formulated to extremes of flexi-
bility such as required in caulking
compounds, but even in this form
they possess high tensile strengths
and toughness. An epoxy used in
conjunction with polyamide or Thio-
kol will yield synthetic reinforced
laminates with both high elongation
and yield. When either polyamide or
Thiokol is combined with epoxy in
different ratios, the physical proper-
ties will vary proportionately. The
addition of either of these coreactants
will reduce the rigidity of the lami-
nate, but the hardness and toughness
will not suffer disproportionately.
Thirdly, the polyamides are with-
out a doubt the easiest of the coreac-
tants to use. These copolymers not
only add flexibility to the laminate,
but they also act as the curing agent.
At room temperature the time for
cure is 24 hours. An increase in tem-
perature will rapidly accelerate the
cure if desired. At 300 degrees Fahren-
heit the cure is 20 minutes. For most
shop work the room temperature cure
is fast enough.

The Company's first engine, the Wasp, took
to the air on May 5,1926. Within a year the
Wasp set its first world record and went on
to smash existing records and set standards
for both land and seaplanes for years to
come, carrying airframes and pilots higher,
farther, and faster than they had &lt;
before.
In recent years, planes powered by Pratt
&amp; Whitney Aircraft have gone on to set
new standards of performance in much the
same way as the Wasp had done in the
1920's. The 727 and DC-9 are indicative of
the new family of short-to-medium range
jetliners which are powered by the highly
successful JT8D turbofan. Examples of
current military utilizations are the J58-
powered Mach 3 YF-12A which recently
established four world aviation records and
the advanced TF30-powered F-lll variable-

help Bell System engineers
provide important communications services
As an engineer your future could be important to us.
You might be able to contribute to our continuing
leadership in the communications field. Therefore, you
should know something about us and how we operate.
Bell System engineers deal with modern problems
in modern ways. They have at their command the
latest in technology and equipment.
An example is how computer programs aid in
providing telephone service for new communities.
Engineers at Bell Telephone Laboratories have
devised computer programs broad enough in scope
so that Bell System operating telephone companies
can use them to engineer the required wide variety
of telephone plant networks.
As part of a continuing effort, programs have been
designed to analyze communications needs of an
area for determining the best plant network layout
and switching office location.
In general, the necessary data are collected and the
engineer selects a number of alternative plans to be
analyzed in detail by a computer. His final decision is
based primarily on an analysis of the computer output.
The computer supplies more significant data, and
supplies it much faster, than laborious, manual cal-
culation methods. The engineer is thus relieved of
dull, time-consuming computation, and he plans facili-
ties with increased confidence—knowing that he is
providing efficient and economical communications,
tailored for a given area.
You may well find a rewarding career in the Bell
System, where people find solutions to exciting
problems. The Bell System companies are equal
opportunity employers. Arrange for an on-campus
interview through your Placement Office, or talk to
a local Bell System company.

JOB REQUIREMENTS
RAFF ASSOCIATES currently has
openings for young Ph.D. physicists
and electrical engineers, well versed in
the fundamentals of their discipline,
whose interests are broad. They will
work in the fields of sonar ASW and
signal processing.
If interested write to Dr. Samuel J.
Raff, president of Raff Associates.
"DO NOT DISTURB
MY CIRCLES..."*
In studying the growth and attrition of companies or
countries and the success and failure of endeavors of many
kinds, significant causes can often be found in key executive
decisions.
As the world's technology advances, these vital decisions
tend more and more to require engineering and scientific
inputs and careful, objective study.
The decision maker for management normally does not
have the time nor the background for such a study. If he
relies on the recommendations of his own staff, often their
self-interest will unconsciously (or consciously) influence
recommendations. Similarly, the advice of outside consultants
may be conditioned by the equipment and services they sell,
or hope to sell.
Therefore, there is a clear and increasing need for the
services of organizations which can objectively study the
scientific and engineering aspects of a problem, analyze them,
and distill a clear and definitive recommendation.
This is the role of Raff Analytic Study Associates. It is
a sphere of growing importance. A scientist or engineer in
this particular area of work will have more impact on his
society and on his country's welfare than in any other type of
endeavor.
The importance of the work will be reflected in many forms
of satisfaction to the successful scientist or engineer in this
field.

Ten years ago we were making only a handful of relatively simple
semiconductor devices for a limited number of applications.
Today, with highly advanced and exotic processes, we are pro-
ducing hundreds of different and sophisticated semiconductors
— for thousands of applications. Our technicians can now control
material composition down to the molecules with precise regu-
lation of impurity levels—and on a daily production line basis.
This we call PERFORMANCE.
Five years ago we produced semiconductor packages the size of
a pencil eraser that replaced the big glass vacuum tubes in your
radio. Today we're making sophisticated semiconductors that per-
form giant-sized tasks—yet fit on a soupspoon like grains of rice.
We call this MINIATURIZATION.
Drop the old time vacuum tube and it would smash. Its parts
wore out pretty regularly too. Shake it or shock it beyond rela-
tively modest limits and you were in trouble. Now you can launch
a space vehicle with thousands of semiconductor components to
go all the way to the moon and back . . . and make it go back
around all over again. And a couple of times more after that.
That's RELIABILITY.
Shake 'em, shock 'em, squeeze 'em or freeze 'em—today's elec-
tronic devices have got to be able to take it . . . and perform.

epoxy is not critical as is the addition
of other hardeners, for a large change
in the proportion will neither change
the physical properties of the resin
significantly nor cause high exotherm.
At present the only polyamide suit-
able for laminating is Versamid 140
produced by General Mills. This has
the lowest viscosity of the polyamides
presently found in quantity on the
market. The viscosity of Versamid
110 is between 60 and 100 poises at
room temperature, and 50/50 ratio
of epoxy to Versamid 140 yields a
highly flexible product which has, in
the past, shown itself to be a versa-
tile adhesive. It has been used with
remarkable success in joining such di-
verse materials as aluminum and syn-
thetic rubbers. At times, it has even
been suggested as an adhesive for
polyethylene. The 50/50 ratio of
epoxy to Versamid 140, in conjunc-
tion with polypropylene cloth rein-
forcements, shows no tendency tow-
ard brittle cracking at strains as high
as -I per cent. Although a polyprop-
ylene laminate at this high strain
has without a doubt yielded, water
flow through the laminate is still va-
porous.
The application of a covering to
damp wood or metal requires the use
of polyamides. Polyamide cured epox-
ies work unusually well on damp
surfaces and are ideal for bonding
wood or damp rusted metals. The
excellent adhesion of polyamide co-
polymers is due to the high concen-
tration of carboxyl, polar amine, and
amide groups. The presence of a
small amount of moisture accelerates
the hardening process rather than re-
tards it. Thus no difficulties should
arise with the use of polyamide cured
epoxies on woods with moisture con-
tents even as high as 15 per cent. In
relation to this bonding with wood,
notable work with epoxy-polyamide
resins in the lamination and repair-
ing of wood members has been done
by Professor Charles Bouc while at
The University of Maine. In his pa-
per, "Wood-Plastic Composite Tech-
nology and its Application to Marine
Repairs and Construction," Professor
Bouc mentions that he has obtained
perfect bonds to oak members which
were near their saturation point.
Going beyond these states, such as
when higher flexibilities than can be
attained with a 50/50 ratio of epoxy
to Versamid 140 are required, it is
wise to consider the epoxy-Thiokol
formulations. Thiokol can be used
in conjunction with epoxies in any
ratio from 0 to 100 per cent. There
is no stoiciometric ratio for the two
materials since neither is a hardener
for the other. To react both the Thio-
kols and epoxies with one another, a
catalyst such as DETA or TETA is
used. These are the same catalysts
supplied with most epoxies intended
for marine use. Epoxy-Thiokol for-
mulations have been used success-
fully with synthetic reinforcements.
Between 10 per cent and 15 per cent
Thiokol to the epoxy will yield a
resin with sufficient flexibility for all
sy n t het i c re i nforcemen ts.
The application of epoxies must
be considered, since undiluted epox-
ies for laminating purposes may cause
difficulty if improper techniques are
used. Undiluted epoxies, within the
range of reasonable prices, have a
viscosity between 5 and 10 poises.
This is high by standards of poly-
ester users, and is made even higher
by the addition of Thiokol or poly-
amide.
When laminating with the high
viscosity epoxies and synthetic rein-
forcements, techniques similar to
those used when laying up laminates
of polyester and heavy rovings should
be used. First the surface is primed
with a heavy coating of resin and
then the cloth is pressed into it. Al-
though this process is longer than if
diluted resins were used, there is little
chance for sags or runs. The better
control of resin concentration means
that waste of the higher price resins
will be reduced to a minimum. (Un-
fortunately one problem forever crop-
ping up with the epoxies is derma-
titis. Epoxies cause skin irritation re-
sembling exema, and in severe cases
can cause permanent damage to the
skin. There are ways to avoid derma-
titis which are very simple and
straightforward. When followed, the
chances of contracting the disease
are slight. In other words, care must
always be taken with these synthetics.
When buying or using epoxies the
following information should be
noted.
1. As the molecular weight and the
viscosity of an epoxy increases,
the potential for sensitization de-
creases sharply.
2. The addition of solvents to epox-
ies for reducing viscosity makes
the resins highly sensitizing. Not
only are the epoxides carried into
the skin by the solvents, but the
solvents themselves are sensitizers.
Also, unless the solvents are ac-
tually reactive diluents, they will
be driven off as vapors. They are
a waste of money.
3. Never wash epoxies off of the
skin with solvents. Soap or mild
detergents do a much better job.
4. Do not allow the epoxies to come
in contact with any other part of
the body but the hands. Try not
to touch objects in the workshop
unless the hands are clean. Epoxy
resins will stick to all surfaces
and track around quickly.
5. Wash all work cloths immediateh
after using the resin to insure
that the clothing will not con-
taminate the body when used
again.
(&gt;. Epoxy must be touched to cause
dermatitis. It is impossible to get
dermatitis from the air.
Dealers in epoxy resins all carrv
skin creams or disposable gloves
which are effective barriers against
contact with resins. Many people
(about 85 per cent of the population)
are not affected by the presence ol
epoxies, but all people having a past
history of skin disorders and all work-
men who work for long hours with
epoxies should take preventative
measures at all times.)
Relatively new to the field of small
craft construction are the polyure-
thanes. To date these resins have
been used for "rubber" seam com-
pounds and marine finishes, and soon
they will be accepted as marine ad-
hesives and laminating resins. The
polyurethanes are well suited for ma-
rine applications due to their ex-
ceptional environmental resistance.

to the moisture of the surrounding
air have been used successfully on all
types of craft. The moisture curing
methanes have exceptional adhesion
to damp wood and can be used in
conditions often considered too poor
for other adhesives and sealants. The
Navy, for instance, has found that the
methanes are superior for coating
aircraft carrier flight decks and for
non-skid decks. The coefficient of fric-
tion of polyurethane is very high.

polyurethane lends itself to fabrica-
tion of lively, yet long lasting Dynel
reinforced decking.
The curing process for moisture
cured polyurethanes is too lengthy
for laminating purposes. The ther-
mosetting polyurethanes can be used
successfully for both the lamination
of wood and the fabrication of syn-
thetic: reinforced laminates. These
casting compounds can be formulated
to any hardness within the range of
the urethanes. They are brought to
polymerize by the addition of a cur-
ing agent in much the same way as
polyesters and epoxies. The urethanes
sold under the heading of adhesives
work, well as wood adhesives. For
laminating with synthetic reinforce-
ments the hardest of the polyure-
thanes are desirable. The author's
experience with synthetic reinforced
urethanes is limited, and there is no
test data available at present for in-
clusion in this article. A study of the
fundamental properties of the ure-
thanes allows one to determine trends
which will appear once experimenta-
tion takes place. The urethanes have
a low modulus of elasticity (9.0 X
I0Jpsi maximum). The resulting high
potential for elongation of 400 per
cent or more means that adhesive
problems with fibers such as poly-
propylene will be reduced to a min-
imum. Polyurethane, aside from the
more flexible Thiokol compositions,
is the only thermosetting resin dis-
cussed in this paper which is more
flexible than a polypropylene rein-
forcement. The unusually high elon-
gation of a polypropylene reinforced
laminate makes possible renovation
of older hulls.
WOOD CORE CONSTRUCTION
Lindsay Lord performed experi-
ments on various plastic covered
wood structures including three hulls
which were, excluding one, tested to
destruction. The one remaining hull,
a strip planked shell covered with
polypropylene reinforced thermoplas-
tics, is still in service. Since these first
experimental hulls, Lord has de-
signed over a dozen different hulls
utilizing synthetics for yachtsmen and
navies around the world. What fol-
lows is devoted to design of wood
hulls covered with polypropylene re-
inforced plastics. The structural pecu-
liarities of polypropylene reinforced
plastics which make them ideal as a
covering for wood structures will be
discussed in such a way that the
reader will be able to utilize them
perhaps in his own designs.
In his paper presented to the SSCD
Lindsay Lord gave a simple set of
rules for determining the core thick-
ness and the number of plies of poly-
propylene covering required to con-
struct a hull. These rules have the
advantage that the hulls built from
them have been successful and thus
a designer is not likely to get into
trouble using them. These rules,
which are a function of the vessel's
length, are based upon a geometric
expansion of a basic hull form. What
is required is a more universal pro-
cedure for determining the scantlings
of such diverse hulls as beam trawlers
anil sailing catamarans.
The hydrostatic loadings on a hull
can be determined adequately using
the principles of maximum head,
provided that it is not in the high
speed catagory and that there are no
large flat surfaces to promote pound-
ing in a seaway. For high speed hulls,
data from past hulls is required to
determine the bottom loadings. The
longitudinal loadings of a polyprop-
ylene reinforced plastic covered hull
may also be determined by conven-
tional means. The static loatl carrying
capacity of a hull panel is determined
only by the static loatl carrying ca-
pacity of the wood core since the
polypropylene reinforced plastics
have low creep strengths. The small
load carrying capacity the plastic cov-
ering could be included in the calcu-
lations, but it is not worth the time.
Wood also has a point where creep
under static loading becomes exces-
sive. Tables in Volume III of "Wood:
A Manual for its Use as a Shipbuild-
ing Material" gives excellent data for
determining if a structure is capable
of carrying the required static loads.
Underwater panels designed to carry
the dynamic loading of a hull will
usually have sufficient modulus to
sustain their shape, but decks and
other topside structures, on the other
hand, must be given careful consider-
ation.
Polypropylene reinforced plastics
can carry short term loads and thus
they influence the dynamic strength
of a structure. Polypropylene rein-
forced plastic does not assume as
much of a loatl as one might expect
due to its low modulus of elasticity.
Under dynamic loadings the basic
function of the polypropylene cover-
ing is to unify the structure at right
angles to the wood grain. The load
carrying capacity of a panel at right
angles to the grain is very low and
may be neglected in all calculations.
Treating a polypropylene reinforced
plastic covered panel as a simple
beam is adequate. If a frame spacing
similar to that required for a carvel
planked hull is used the resulting
planking will be very thin. Increas-
ing the frame spacing will bring up
the plank thickness enough to make
planking easier while the reduction
in number of frames substantially re-
duces cost. Hulls 30 feet and above
can be constructed completely around
sawn frames and bulkheads, but the
bulkheads must be stronger than
usual to absorb the twisting to which
such a thin skinned structure will be
subjected.
In large hulls the thin skins, which
are a result of polypropylene rein-
forced plastic overlay construction,
may not have sufficient longitudinal
strength in a seaway. For the larger
hulls it is best first to determine the
sectional modulus of the hull. Then
the bulkheads or frames are placed
to suit the requirements of hydro-
static loadings. Of particular value in
estimating the longitudinal require-
ments of a hull is Lindsay Lord's
book on Nuval Architecture of Plan-
ning Hulls. A polypropylene rein-
forced plastic overlay contributes
little to the longitudinal strength of a
hull because of its modulus of elas-
ticity. Alter a few sets of calculations
the designer will be able to derive a
percentage factor which may be
added to the strength of the core.
In most cases it will not exceed five
or ten percent. The lightest hull will
evolve if the thickness of the plank-
ing is fust determined by the require-
ments of longitudinal stress and then
the frames fitted to suit the hydro-
static loadings. Such a procedure be-
comes expensive in small hulls clue
to the great number of frames in-
volved.
With the aid of a digital computer,
some graphs of the structural prop-
erties of polypropylene reinforced
epoxy covered wood core laminates
were developed. They are helpful to
the designer both as an illustration
of the effects of polypropylene rein-

forced plastic coverings upon wood
cores, and as a tool in the actual
design of a hull. These graphs are
based upon wood cores having a mois-
ture content of 15 per cent and an
average grain slope of 1/10, which is
a good average for inexpensive struc-
tural materials. The thickness of one
ply of 4 ounce Vectra polypropylene
cloth is taken to be 0.017 inches. See
Table 1 for more details.
Table 1 for each species of wood
gives the bending moment per inch
width at failure of the composite
beam in the direction of the wood
grain.
Tests performed by the author ex-
plain the high impact resistance of a
polypropylene reinforced plastic cov-
ered wood core. Failure of such a
laminate occurs at the tensile face of
the wood when the wood ruptures.
Tf the load could be removed at the
instant of rupture, the polypropylene
reinforced plastic overlay would re-
main unharmed. In actual practice
the load will continue and the ten-
sile web of polypropylene will yield.
The tensile web will not rupture un-
til an ultimate elongation of over 20
per cent has been reached and the
compression face in all but extreme
cases will remain intact and water-
tight. Any crack in the wood core of
a polypropylene reinforced plastic
covered hull is prevented from pro-
pagating by the fibrous web which
forms. It is unwise to construct a
hull with polypropylene reinforced
plastic only on the outboard face.
Without the inner covering the im-
pact strength of the laminate is mark-
edly reduced. The planking of a hull
should be edge glued during con-
struction to reduce fatigue of the
structure. A loose seam is a built-in
crack which will fatigue the plastic
overlay to the point of leaking within
a few seasons. Any severe impact will
immediately cause yielding at the
ready-made notch. It is impossible for
a crack to follow a well made glue
joint.
A compression face can yield in
the case of a local impact. If the
wood core is crushed the polypropy-
lene reinforcement will be pulled into
the depression. The fibers at the lip
of the depression are in tension rather
than compression. The force required
to crush a core is a function of the
plastic covering's thickness. For most
displacement hulls and hulls oper-
ating in the lower ranges of planning
a good rule to use is:
N = 1 + 4T EQ. 1
where T is the core thickness in
inches and N is the number of plies
of 4 ounce Vectra polypropylene fab-
ric to be used. This rule may be used
for soft core materials such as cedars,
soft pines, white pines, and spruces.
A heavier covering will be required
for balsa cores clue to their increased
rigidity, while lighter coverings are
required for the hardwoods.
Contrary to popular belief, water
vapor enters and leaves a wood core
covered with either synthetic or glass
reinforced plastics. It is possible to
take a dry piece of wood, encapsulate
it in plastic, then drive its moisture
content up to the saturation point
by submersion. However, it is not
possible for the sample to go above
the saturation point. Due to the lack
of facilities, the author has been un-
able to determine the rate of mois-
ture diffusion of polypropylene rein-
forced plastics, but what data are
available show it to be high with
respect to that of wood. It is possible
to analyze the moisture content ol
a wood core as a void between plastic
walls. The moisture content of the
void is determined by the rate ol
moisture transmission from the walls.
For most hulls used during the sum-
mer and not heated during the win-
ter, a relative humidity inside the
hull of 70 per cent may be used. In
heated spaces the relative humiditx
will be much lower. A reduction of
the thickness of the inboard covering
of a structure will appreciably reduce
the moisture content of the wood.
This has the advantage that the hull
weight is reduced and the strength
of the core is increased. One problem
resulting from such a reduction of
the inner covering is that the differ-
ence in the load carrying capacities
of the coverings, as small as it is,
may cause warping of the panel if
the moisture content of the core
should change. A practical rule to
follow is never to have more than a
two ply difference between the inner
and outer covering. For best results
it is necessary to construct the core
of a hull near its equilibrium mois-
ture content. This is particularly true
if it is to be covered with rigid ma-
terials such as glass reinforced plas-
tics. If a hull is built of kiln dried
materials the plastic coverings will
be prematurely stressed and thus the
total strength of the structure will be
impaired. Air dried lumber can lie
used successfully below the waterline
but better results -will be obtained
with woods of higher moisture con-
tent provided that the laminating
resins are compatible. Cood results
can be attained using a core moisture
content of 15 per cent in conjunction
with the epoxy-polyamide resins,
while even higher moisture contents
may be used with the polyurethanes.
The width of the plank in wocxl
core construction is not critical if the
moisture content of the wood is close
to the equilibrium point. If the
planks are too wide, a large varia-
tion of moisture content may cause
warping. If the moisture content of
the planking is well controlled, the
plank width which minimizes labor
and material costs is the one to use.
During normal periods of haulout
and immersion the moisture content
of a hull will vary little. Thus there
will be little fatiguing of joints, de-

tic covering. It should also be noted
that wood completely encased in a
plastic will not decay. Moisture, heat,
bacteria, and air are required for
decay. Thus wood covered with syn-
thetic or glass reinforced plastics con-
tains all the necessities for decay but
air.
Polypropylene reinforced plastic
covered hulls are made economical by
the low cost of the core. The wood
used for polypropylene reinforced
plastic structures can be of a low
quality without jeopardizing the
strength of the hull. Knots are not
objectionable if small, and if proper
scarfs are used, long planks are not
required. It makes little difference
whether a plank is quarter or flat
sawn and planks which have warped
during- drying can often be used to
advantage. Fastenings are not critical.
Bright steel nails of the annular ring
tvpe are suitable for tacking together
the wood core, for the amount of air
which will penetrate polypropylene
reinforced plastic covered hull is in-
sufficient to cause rusting of the nails.

of a core wood is achieved by the

The physical dimensions of stems,
keels, and chines may be markedly
reduced. The keel and stem can best
be fabricated in one piece by lami-
nating them out of many layers of
sheet plywood cut to shape on a band
saw and glued together with epoxy
resins. Rabbets are not required at
the chines, and clamps are not re-
quired at the deck edge. Since the
deck edge is constructed in the same
manner as the chines. See Figure 3.
Polypropylene reinforced plastic
covered hulls are flexible. Heavy
items such as generators and heat
exchangers should not be mounted
on either the bottom or light frames.
Therefore attempts should be made
to mount all heavy items to bulk-
heads and floors.
Integral fish wells and tanks can
be used successfully in polypropylene
reinforced plastic overlay construc-
tion. Vents should be made larger
than normal since the large deflec-
tions of bottom panels will cause high
pressures to build up inside the tanks
in a seaway. The walls and tops of
all integral tanks should be designed
to withstand the same hydrostatic
pressures which exist outside the hull
at that point.
This then leads to finishing. There
are two ways to finish plastic lami-
nates. One is to put the coloring into
the plastic and the other is to paint
the completed laminate. Putting pig-
ment into the laminating resin is less
expensive than painting due to the

reduction in material costs and the
reduction in labor. Pigment in the
laminate also allows the workers to
see any unfair sections which ma\
result from the laminating. A disad-
vantage of having the pigment in the
laminating resin is that the laminate
is weakened and once the finish is
deteriorated, the laminate itself is
directly affected. However, a superior
finish may be attained by painting
the hull. A high gloss, hardness, and
concentration of pigment, as well as
a wide selection of colors is possible
only with paint. The lack of pigment
in a polypropylene reinforced plastic
laminate has the advantage that a
failure of the laminate can be vis-
ually inspected by removing the
painted surface.
Thus the synthetic reinforced plas-
tics have a changing, advancing role
in the design of small craft.

Now, with the assignment of responsibility to operate the
Army's Cleveland Tank-Automotive Plant, Allison is taking
on a new dimension to its capability in the design, develop-
ment and production of complex military weapons systems.
Thus, Allison represents a versatile opportunity for en-
gineers in the application of advanced technologies to aero-
space propulsion systems, and armored military vehicle sys-
tems—including one of their principal components, power
transmissions.
In addition, an expanding volume of work in commercial
fields gives a solid base to these urgently needed military
programs.

OF 75 YEARS AGO
This is a continuation of the article
printed in the October TECHNIC.
The editors felt that those readers who
complain about inadequate labora-
tories would be interested in seeing
ivhat their forefathers had to work
with.
THE ELECTRICAL LABORATORY
The electrical portion of electrical
engineering begins with a course
of illustrated lectures in electricity
and magnetism, which serves as a
foundation for a subsequent labora-
tory course in electrical measurements.
This practical work is accompanied
by lectures on units and the most
modern and approved methods of
making measurements of the various
electrical and magnetic quantities, to-
gether with methods of calibrating
the instruments and finding their con-
stants.
During the past year a good deal of
work has been done in the systematic
testing of batteries, obtaining their
polarization and recovery curves,
curves of current, internal resistance,
and terminal electromotive force.
This course is followed by one in
dynamo-electric machinery, two hours
a week being devoted to class work,
and two days to making tests of dy-
namos. The laboratory is now pro-
vided with two constant potential, and
two constant current dynamos, the lat-
ter of ten to twelve lamps capacity
each. A storage battery, 50 incandes-
cent lamps, If) arc lights, an iron
resistance of 120 ohms, capable of
carrying out 15 amperes, and pro-
vided with a switch board which al-
lows for ready coupling in parallel so
as to carry 300 amperes, together with
ammeters and voltmeters of sufficient
capacity, permit making of elaborate
tests on dynamo machines. During the
year characteristic curves have been
obtained of the several dynamos, tests
of efficiency have been made, and a
small dynamo has been "com-
pounded" for constant potential. Mo-
tor tests for efficiency have also been
tarried out.
A course in Mascart and Joubert's
electricity and magnetism is offered
as advanced work, and a course in
distribution of electricity and photom-
etry of incandescent lamps is required
of electrical engineers. The pho-
tometry room is provided with an
accurately graduated bar six meters
long, made by Darling, Brown, and
Sharp, and has a methoen screen and
an excellent rotating stand for meas-
urement of spherical candle power.
Important work on fuse wires, bat-
teries, incandescent lamps, standard
cells and other standards is also in
progress. The entire basement floor is
devoted to the electrical work. The
largest room, devoted to the engine and
dynamos, is shown in the engraving.
The smaller work rooms are all pro-
vided with substantial stone capped
piers. In them apparatus has been
placed for the most accurate work in
electrical measurements and investi-
gations. A portion of the building,
remote from the dynamos, has been
kept reasonably free from iron, so as
to permit of measuring the horizontal
component on terrestrial magnetism.
A large tangent and cosine galvanom-
eter, made by Edelmann, of Munich,
is plated in this part of the building.
Only the best apparatus has been ob-
tained: and additions will be made to
meet the rapidly growing demand,
occasioned by the great increase of
students desiring to avail themselves
of the new facilities in this direction.
THE CHEMICAL LABORATORY
The courses in the Chemical Lab-
oratory, arranged for the use of stu-
dents in metallurgy are as follows:
Course 1, in Qualitative Analytical
Chemistry, consisting of recitations
and laboratory work daily throughout
one semester, with opportunity for ad-
vanced work if desired; courses 4, 6,
and 7 in Quantitative Analytical
Chemistry; course 4 consisting of a ten
weeks drill, by means of lectures and
laboratory work, in elementary quan-
titative analysis, and courses 6 and 7
consisting of laboratory work daily,
throughout the entire semester, in the
most approved methods of analysis of
a large number of ores, fluxes and
furnace products in general. Course .5
in advanced general quantitative work
may be taken if desired, and is of the
same extent as the last two courses
mentioned. Blowpipe Analysis consists
of a six weeks course, by means of
lectures and laboratory work, and in-
cludes the identification of one hun-
dred minerals. The course in Assaying
in the dry way is also a six weeks
course, and includes the report of ac-
tual assays, for silver and gold, of
about twenty-five ores and furnace
products, and the assay of a variety of
ores for lead, tin, etc. There is abun-
dant table room in the laboratory for
students in analytical chemistry, and
blowpipe analysis. The quantitative
room is provided with a large hot-
plate and steam coil under a hood:
also with a steam bath of ample
capacity and fifteen Becker balances
for the sole use of students. A new
Assay furnace has been lately built,
having eight muffles of different sizes,
and there are two crucible furnaces
of fair capacity. For the use of stu-
dents in assaying there is a very deli-
cate assay-balance.
Two courses in Metallurgy are
given consisting of two lectures jier
week, during one semester, for each
course.
The courses are illustrated, as well
as possible, by means of charts ami
drawings, and, during the past vear.
an additional course of ten lectures
upon the metallurgy of steel was given
by Professor Langley.

National Security Agency
... where special programs encourage rapid professional advancement
for the engineer, scientist and mathematician launching his career.
NSA is a scientific and technological com-
munity unique in the United States, perhaps
in the world. Unique in its mission, its oper-
ation, its requirements . . . unique, too, in the
scope of opportunity it affords a young scien-
tist or engineer beginning his career.
A separate agency functioning within the
Department of Defense, NSA is responsible
for developing "secure" (i.e., invulnerable)
communications systems to transmit and re-
ceive vital information. Within this area, which
encompasses the whole field of cryptology—
the science of codes and ciphers—NSA project
teams pursue a broad spectrum of investiga-
tions taking them well beyond many known
and accepted boundaries of knowledge. Be-
ginning with basic research, these investiga-
tions progress through applied research,
development and design, prototype engineer-
ing, and on into various phases of applications
engineering.
At NSA you might specialize in any or sev-
eral of these sectors, depending on your
talents and special interests:
ENGINEERING. Antenna/transmitter/receiver
design . . . high speed computers (digital and
analog) . . . transistor circuitry . . . advanced
radio communications techniques . . . micro-
wave communications . . . audio and video
recording devices . . . cryogenic studies and
applications . . . integrated circuitry . . . mi-
crominiaturization.
PHYSICS. Solid state (basic and applied)
. . . electromagnetic propagation . . . upper
atmosphere phenomena . . . superconductivity
and cryogenics (Ph. D. graduates only).
MATHEMATICS. Statistical mathematics . . .
matrix algebra . . . finite fields . . . probability
. . . combinatorial analysis . . . programming
and symbolic logic.
Unequaled Facilities and Equipment

free you to concentrate on the most challen-
ging aspects of your projects, and thus help
speed your professional growth.
Outstanding Colleagues
You will work alongside people of enor-
mously varied backgrounds and intellectual
interests, over 500 of whom hold advanced
degrees.
Researchers at NSA also receive constant
stimulus from outside the agency. To assist in
certain program areas, NSA often calls on
special boards of consultants-outstanding
scientists and engineers from industry and
academic centers as well as from other gov-
ernment agencies.

vestigation of fuel tells for automo-
tive power plants. Chrysler Corpora-
tion reported in January, 1960, that
it had started work on the fuel cell
car, "Cella 1", which it hopes to per-
fect "within the next generation."
The car probably will have separate
electric motors for each wheel and
will use a circuit that will speed one
wheel to negotiate curves and with a
safeguard to prevent spins on ice or in
ditches.
Another company active in fuel cell
research between 1959 and 1961 was
Esso, whose Engineering and Research
Company has been understood to be
investigating the use of oil in fuel
cells for small home electrical power
plants. At this same time, the United
States Research Laboratory of the Na-
tional Carbon Company (a division
of Union Carbide Corporation) has
made fuel cells that operate at room
temperature and can use air instead
of pure oxygen for the oxidizer.
In Surrey, England. Dr. H. H.
Chambers, director of research of
the Sondes Place Research Institute
showed in 1960 a fuel cell which gen-
erated electricity using kerosene and
air. This fuel cell produces heat be-
cause the kerosene must be vaporized
before it can be used in the device.
Chambers foresees a generator about
the size of an office fding cabinet that
will be able to supply a house with
electrical power and warm it at the
same time with its byproduct, heat.
A small fuel cell power plant has
been used at Fort Huachuca, Ari-
zona, to power the Signal Corp's port-
able radar set called the "Silent Sen-
try." Such a power plant is of obvious
military import because its quietness
and lack of telltale exhaust or heat
radiations will make it much less
detectable to an enemy.
The Armed Forces are probably
the major customer and sponsor of
fuel cell research. The United States
Army Signal Corps Research and De-
velopment Laboratory at Fort Mon-
mouth, New Jersey, has been study-
ing them for years. In 1960 they had
a fuel cell operating on alcohol which
was four times as efficient in watts
per pound as the best storage batten.
Since that time fuel cells have become
more than ten times as efficient. The
Laboratory has also been working
on a sun powered fuel cell for space
use.
In 1961 the possibility of a bio-
chemical fuel cell was made reality.
The term biochemical is used be-
cause in this case the electrons come
from the decomposition of organic
material. Joseph Kage and Compam
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, devel-
oped a fuel cell that was able to
produce electricity at y2 volt con-
tinuously for several months. In the
cell, sugar was used as a nutrient for
bacteria which were added to speed
the decomposition of the organic
matter. Another researcher, Dr. Fred-
erick D. Sisler of the Geological Sur-
vey of the Interior Department, in-
vented a cell using seawater and bac-
teria. Both this fuel cell and that of
Kage and Company had an anode
section and a cathode detection sep-
arated by an ion diffusion bridge.

• nutrient were put on the anode side.
Oxygen and, in the Sisler cell, sea
&gt; water wrere put on the cathode side.
The idea of the biochemical fuel
cell is only about fifty years old.
U Putting bacterial metabolism to work
as an electrical power plant was prob-
ably first done in 1912 by M. C. Potter,
a British botanist. He made a prima-
tive bacterial battery of six cells using
I yeast around carbon electrodes and
produced a current of 1.25 milli-
amperes. Few people saw the sig-
nificance of this feat. Other research-
ers conducted similar experiments at
irregular intervals, and in 1931, B.
I Cohen of the John Hopkins Medical
I School produced a battery that had
an output of 2 milliamperes. How-
ever, investigations of biochemical
fuel cells were not continuous or in-
tensive until about 1960, when sev-
eral groups began working on the
idea. Sisler became interested in fuel
cells because he noticed that the de-
composition of organic matter on the
ocean bottom, plus the chemical and
physical conditions in the sea, pro-
duced a feeble electric current. Dr.
John Welsh and his associates at Jo-
seph Kage and Company noted that
enzymes from living cells are very
potent catalysts and might speed some
chemical reactions thousands or even
millions of times. Since a fuel cell uses
a catalyst to speed the electrochemical
reaction between the fuel and the
oxidant, they thought of the idea of
bacteria to produce the needed cat-
alysts in a fuel cell.
Dr. Rohrback of Magna Industries,
Inc. of California and his associates
discovered that certain bacteria was
responsible for the corrosion of oil
wells and pipe lines under the sea and
that these bacteria caused small
amounts of electricity to be generated
while they caused the corrosion. So
Magna began investigating the use of
biochemical fuel cells for producing
electric power for seagoing ships.
By 1962 Dr. Sisler and his co-work-
ers in a newly formed private research
company had built a small radio trans-
mitter, powered by fuel cells, which
had a range of 15 miles. Sisler also
showed a mcxlel of a ship operating
on biocells, using the sea water it
floated upon. Later in 1962 about
twelve companies had started bio-
chemical fuel cell research and they
held a biochemical fuel cell confer-
ence in Corvallis, Oregon. Some of
the companies were supported by the
Air Force, Army, Navy, and NASA.
In other parts of the world in 1961
and 1962, many foreign companies
were active in fuel cell research. In
Holland, Broers was investigating
high-temperature fuel cell systems
under the sponsorship of T.N.O. In
Fngland, Bacon and Chambers were
sponsored by the National Research
Development Corporation for engag-
ing in their fuel cell investigations.
Such private corporations in Eng-
land as British Petroleum, Shell,
Hawker-Seddley and Chloride have
been developing fuel cell systems.
As of 1961, the Central Electric Gen-
erating Board had an extensive pro-
gram on the feasibility of fuel cells for
central power stations.
In France much work has been
done on fuel cells by the researchers
of the French Petroleum Institute and
of the French Center of Electrical
Research. St. Gobain, Picheney, Com-
pagnie Generale D'Electricite, and
Compagnie Sans Fils have private fuel
cell research programs.
India, the U.S.S.R., Japan, and the
Commonwealth of Australia also had
fuel cell programs by 1963.
In the United States, hydrogen-
oxygen fuel cell systems were for sale
as early as 1961. These units ranged
in output from hundreds to thou-
sands of watts and with operating
lives of many thousands of hours with
practically no maintenance and effi-
ciencies in excess of 60%. In 1961
the United States Government was
testing fuel cells for use in submarines,
satellites and space vehicles, and for
ground power generation. Low temp-
erature hydrogen-oxygen fuel cells
were operational. Furthermore, by
1961 the type of fuel cell using cheap
fuels (oil, kerosene, gas) was being
systems engineered and tested at the
multikilowatt output level. Between
1959 and 1961 some of the endurance,
corrosion, cost, and reliability prob-
lems had been solved. Significant re-
sults had been made with medium
cost fuels: hydrazine, ammonia, meth-
anol, ethyline glycol, ethylene oxide,
or methylamines.
In 1963 Allis-Chalmers Manufac-
turing Company demonstrated a fuel
cell powered golf cart. Operating
with hydrazine as the fuel, the fuel
cell battery had an output of three
thousand watts. The fuel cells used
a capillary membrane between the
electrodes instead of the liquid or
paste electrolytes which many early
fuel cells have used.
In March 1962 the General Elec-
tric Company was awarded an $8,-
000,000 contract to produce a func-
tional fuel cell power supply for the
Gemini flights of our space program.
The Gemini flights of last summer
and fall did use the fuel cell power
package. This General Electric unit
produces two kilowatts and for at
least six weeks. Weighing only 175
pounds, the power supply provides
the electrical energy of about 2000
pounds of conventional batteries. Al-
through one model uses hydrogen
and oxygen, a more advanced model
by G.E. announced in 1963 can use
hydrocarbon fuels and operate at
150-200 degrees C instead of the 600-
1000 degrees C needed in the older
cells. An efficiency of about 70%
was deemed attainable. The power
pack used for the Gemini flights con-
sisted of two one kilowatt batteries
of three stacks in parallel. Each stack
contained thirty-two individual fuel
cells which used a solid electrolyte.
While General Electric was in
charge of the Gemini fuel cell devel-
opment, the Pratt and Whitney Air-
craft Division of United Aircraft Cor-
poration is responsible for the fuel
cell power plants to be used on the
Apollo phase of our space program.
Pratt and Whitney are working on a
Bacon type of fuel cell with potassium
hydroxide for the electrolyte. In 1964
they disclosed their modified Bacon
system battery which will have three
stacks of fuel cells in parallel, each
stack containing thirty-one individual
fuel cells. The output of the system is
1420 watts and weighs 1300 pounds,
much less than the weight of an
equivalent amount of conventional
batteries.
In 1964 Allis-Chalmers Manufac-
turing Company revealed a 2000 watt
hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell which it
had designed and built for N.A.S.A.
to be used for thirty day space flights.
In that same year, Texas Instruments,
Inc. demonstrated a fuel cell which
could operate on several relatively
inexpensive fuels, relative to hydro-
gen that is. The output of the fuel
cell was 100 watts and the cell could
use either jet fuel, alcohol, or nat-
ural gas. General Electric announced
a production model fuel cell battery

with 1100 watts peak power and a life
of 1100 hours for on-off duty. In
July 1964 Allis-Chalmers built a 750
watt fuel cell that operated on hydra-
zine.
The possibility of a regenerative
fuel cell, one which operates on a
closed system in which the fuel is oxi-
dized but the products of the reaction
are reconverted to the fuel and the
oxidizer for reuse, is being investi-
gated by Electro-Optical Systems for
N.A.S.A. Solar energy is to be used to
dissociate water into hydrogen and
oxygen, which then will be used to
operate the fuel cell.
In 1965 the Linden, New Jersey,
laboratory of the Esso Research and
Engineering Company showed a fuel
cell which uses alcohol as the fuel
and uses air for the oxidizer. The cell
heats to 140 degrees C, weighs 29
pounds and has an output of 100
watts at five volts. Esso is confident
the power-to-weight-ratio can soon be
improved now that the basic design
problems have been solved. At the
present time a fuel such as alcohol is
much cheaper than hydrogen and is
much easier to handle and store, since
hydrogen is highly explosive and is
stored in pressure tanks.
The Monsanto Research Corpora-
tion near Boston, Massachusetts, has
developed an amazing type of fuel
cell: the "dry-tape battery." The bat-
tery looks like a tape recorder; tapes
unreel from one reel to another, but
no music is produced. Instead, elec-
trical energy is produced when tapes
join together during their run. When
the tapes are stopped, the current
ceases.
Powered by a handful of coal, a
fuel cell operated television set was
demonstrated by the YVestinghouse
Electric Corporation of Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. This project is spon-
sored by the United States Office of
Coal Research.
In England. Shell Research Limited
built in 1965 a methane and air fuel
cell that has an output of five kilo-
watts and is used to power an electric-
powered air hammer for cement
breaking. The unit is mounted on a
truck and is much quieter of course
than the diesel engine it replaced.
A one man submarine was built by
Allis-Chalmers and powered by fuel
cells. Perhaps in the future regular
submarines can be powered by fuel
cells.
FUTURE APPLICATIONS OF
FUEL CELLS
Because fuel cells are highly effi-
cient sources of electrical power and
because their efficiency is independent
of the size of the fuel cell, they promise
to be of incalculable value to us in
the future.
Modern electrical power plants that
involve heat processes are necessarily
very inefficient and the fuel cell is
being considered for large-scale elec-
trical power production.
Power losses in transmission lines,
coupled with the cost of erecting and
maintaining the lines, makes elec-
tricity more expensive than if these
expenses could be eliminated. Maybe
they can be eliminated—by the use
of fuel cells in a small home power
plant and larger industrial fuel cell
power units.
Someday fuel cells may provide the
huge amounts of electrical power
which are used in the production of
aluminum. If so, maybe the alumi-
num companies will cluster around
natural gas sites instead of around
hydroelectric power dams.
Like batteries, fuel cells are port-
able, so when fuel cell technology is
more advanced we may see fuel cell
operated power lawn mowers, boats,
televisions, radios, vacuum cleaners,
and motor scooters and motorcycles
with no roar of exploding gasoline.
Someday we may find that fuel cells
can be applied to all forms of mo-
torized transportation. Right now
fuel cells seem very promising for
such vehicles as surface ships, sub-
marines, automobiles, tractors, trucks,
trains, monorails, subways, busses,
and golfcarts. Perhaps even airplanes
will some day use fuel cells for their
electrical systems if not for their pro-
pulsion systems.
Imagine driving a fuel cell automo-
bile. There would be very little vibra-
tion and virtually no noise. The ex-
haust would probably be harmless
water vapor and perhaps some car-
bon dioxide. Because the car would
operate on electric motors to turn
the wheels, there would be no need
for a transmission. DC motors seem
just ideal for powering cars since they
respond automatically to give in-
creased torque when under load. Ha\-
ing much fewer parts than an internal
combustion engine, the fuel cell and
motors should eventually be consider-
ably cheaper to buy. Because of the
fuel cells efficiency, less fuel would be
needed of course
At the present time many fuel cells
are impractical for many applications
because they require an expensive
catalyst, often platinum. But bacteria
and their derivatives provide excel-
lent catalysts and may play a leading
role in the future development of the
fuel cell. These enzymes are much
easier to use than conventional cat-
alysts and may make cheaper fuels
more practical to use by increasing
the reaction rate in the cell. Someday
biochemical fuel cells may use gar-
bage, sewage, leaves, grass and other
waste materials as fuel. In this man-
ner electrical power would be pro-
duced and wastes disposed at the
same time. General Electric, Mar-
quardt Inc., Magna Corporation, and
Ford's Aeronutronic division are al-
ready working for N.A.S.A. to de-
velop regenerative biochemical fuel
cell called the "Space Oasis." In this
system, biocells working in conjunc-
tion with an algae solar converter

ask Rover.
Ask about the Rover-B.R.M. A radical car with a rear-
mounted gas turbine engine. One of the 51 cars that started at
Le Mans this year. One of only 14 with the stamina to finish.
Ask Rover about the engine's unique heat exchanger that
doubled miles per gallon of fuel. They 11 tell you it was made of
a Corning-developed glass-ceramic trademarked CERCOR®.
Noel Penny, the engine's designer, states: "The low coeffi-
cient of expansion, low thermal conductivity, high specific heat
and economic feasibility of Cercor glass-ceramic made it the
logical choice for the Rover, with a much better prospect for
future gas turbine engines than any metal counterpart."
Today glass can do jobs that metals can't—and more. Much
more. It can withstand the awesome pressures at the ocean's
floor, maintain constant electrical properties at missile speeds,
save weight without sacrificing strength, bring the stars close
to an astronomer's eye, bend, not bend, break, not break. It's
the most versatile basic material in the world today.
For solutions to their materials problems, industry and gov-
ernment are coming to Corning. Because Corning is the glass-
master. It's a broad, international company, with one of the
most daring, expert and imaginative research and engineering
staffs in the world. Plus, a marketing principle that commits
them to developing products only in areas where a need exists
and no product does.

SUB-PLANE—This is an artist's conception of a sub-
mersible seaplane based on feasibility study results ob-
tained by General Dynamics/Convair, San Diego, Calif.
Sob-Plane is a vehicle that would be at home in the
air and underwater. After a six-month study program
on Sub-Plane, sponsored by the U.S. Navy Bureau of Naval
Weapons, Convair division engineers have concluded that
development of such a vehicle is feasible and practical.
On an underwater mission, as depicted in the artist's con-
ception, the vehicle would be powered by electric motors
and batteries. The three flight engines, two mounted on
struts above the wing and a third located aft of the wing
on top of the hull, would be sealed for the underwater
mission.
Bottle-like containers made of a semi-transparent sili-
cone rubber have been developed by Air Research Mfg.
Co. of Los Angeles.
The con'ainers, made of a silicone rubber compound
developed by General Electric are shaped like a blood
plasma bottle and have a rounded bottom. They offer
the advantage of a re-usable breakage-free container
that will withstand temperatures up to 500' F and remain
flexible at below — 65 °F. One of the most intriguing
possible uses of the container is as a dispenser of partially
liquified food and liquids ranging from water to blood
plasma in the conditions of weightlessness existing in a
spatial environment.
The silicone rubber construction offers several advan-
tages. The material is completely inert and non-allergenic
and is unaffected by sterilizations. It is both tasteless
and odorless.

He was a great scientist in his day
This Sumerian was minding our busi-
ness five thousand years ago.
Like Olin, he specialized in chemi-
cals and metals. He smelted copperand
tin to make bronze. He made an iron
axle, put it between two wheels, and off
he went.
Men have always been trying to find
the answers to important problems.To-
day, Olin is at it, harder than ever.
Our pioneering research in liquid
chlorine helped eradicate typhoid and
other water-borne diseases.
Our anti-tubercular drug, nydrazid?
is a major reason TB deaths de-
creased 60% in the last eight years.
Olin's ammonium phosphate fertiliz-
er (Ammo-Phos's) makes it possible for
farmers to grow more food than ever
before.
And to prevent the tremendous
waste in food spoilage, we're working on
an antibiotic-coated plastic wrapping.

To take a big sting out of life, Olin is
developing a high speed cartridge that
enables medicine to be injected without
the use of hypodermics.
Butnoneof these advances could
have been made without our scientists.
Every division of Olin seeks the cre-
ative, scientific mind for the answers to
the research problems of our day. If this

The intuitive character of decision
making and the experimental method
are giving way to analysis and synthe-
sis. This new engineering method has
been encouraged by the advances that
have been made in engineering educa-
tion and the powerful aids to complex
problem solution which have been
discussed previously. The complex
models satisfactorily describing real,
physical components or systems can
be solved through use of the computer.
The resulting solution need no longer
be viewed as invalid because of over-
simplification. The engineer's atten-
tion can be turned to the task of recog-
nizing all the influencing factors and
to logically state the problem he ex-
pects to solve. The engineer is begin-
ning to understand that the concept
of "truth" must be altered to the ideas
of "approximate truth." The probabil-
istic methods in engineering problem
solutions are forcing the engineer into
the advanced consideration of reliabil-
ity as well as into new methods of
decision making.
The responsibilities for decisions
concerning many matters of design
fall upon a selected group of men
referred to as management. These
men are occupying a position of re-
sponsibility because of their demon-
strated competence and leadership
ability. They have, however, advanced
to their position at a time when tre-
mendous advances in technology have
taken place; the changes have occured
so rapidly that full-time study would
have been required to have been famil-
iar with any broad front of develop-
ment. These are the men who must
decide upon the use or rejection of
new engineering concepts and me-
thods which the young engineer with
advanced training may propose.
There are men in these management
or supervisory groups in industry who
have and will continue to commit
their activity to a state of maintaining
the status quo so far as technical de-
velopments are concerned. New con-
cepts and methods are pre-judged and
rejected even though such a single
decision could start the death cycle
for the enterprise. Even more impor-
tant, these decisions imply other pos-
sible consequences. The engineering
talent they initially acquire may find
the management decisions to their
liking and gradually revert to the
kind of intuitive and experimental
approach to problem solution that is
popular. On the other hand, the young
men are much more likely to conclude
that there are better opportunities
elsewhere. The net result is a total loss
of investment in the men. There is
little that can be done to assist this
management category. Admittedly,
the dying process is mercifully slow.
However an alert management may
also find decisions to accept new tech-
nology, concepts and methods difficult
to make, even though bias is effectively
removed from the considerations. The
young engineer who had completed a
proposal and, within the limits of his
experience, has included an evaluation
of the economic and social as well as
the technical merits of the engineering
project to which he was assigned, has
satisfactorily completed the first phase
of a decision making process. His pro-
posal runs the risk of being rejected.
That possibility, however, is reduced
to a minimum. He becomes an effec-
tive partner of management. But man-
agement, who must finally make the
decision concerning the proposal, may
hesitate to launch into a new method
because of unfamiliarty with the un-
derlying science, technology, concept
or method. Those occupying these
positions in that total spectrum of
technical corporate responsibility are
fundamentally in the difficult position
of coping with a rapidly changing
technologically oriented world where
the necessity for making the decision
which will yield the optimum result
becomes ever more important. The
only offsetting activity presently con-
ceived that promises assistance is Con-
inuing Education.
Continuing Education is a complete
topic in itself. Certainly it is no longer
an activity for the other person. All
engineers who have responsibilities
within the total spectrum of industrial
organization are faced with having to
spend a portion of their time in the
process of keeping informed.
A rigorous, demanding engineering
educational program results from the
proposed new dimension. It will, how-
ever, provide an educational oppor-
tunity lor the qualified student in
order that he may accept the broad
responsibilities offered by a well-man-
aged industrial organization. The pro-
gram will prepare the student for a
rewarding professional career and a
background for management respon-
sibilities, if, in the conduct of his
technical work, he demonstrates the
abilities and aptitude associated with
the problems of final decision. Im-
plementation of this effort requires
a special faculty contribution, enthu-
siastic participation of students and
close cooperation with industry. In-
dustries' participation includes career
guidance.
For many years those institutions
concerned with providing educational
opportunities for engineers have ac-
cepted the task of guiding their stu-
dents in a progressive choice of career
aims as one of their major responsibil-
ities. In recent years this effort has
been complemented by government
agencies who have the same interests
as industry, namely, a continuing
supply of well qualified, trained young
men and women. These agencies have
considerable influence on educational
programs through the mechanisms of
fellowship grants, funded program as-
sistance and contracts. In all cases, the
funds are allocated for stated objec-
tives mutually agreeable to both
parties in advance of the grant. The
funds are specifically designated for
support of the young engineer while
training in the philosophy and me-
thods of research investigation. The
simple elements of the contract, an
offer and a consideration, are fouml
in all federal support programs.
Industry must accept a more active
leadership role in engineering edu-
cation. It must study its needs for
talent, make the result of those studies
known, and vigorously support those
institutions that respond. Industry
needs to take a hard look at the phi-
losophy of its educational funding
programs, give positive direction n&gt;
its resources allocated to fellowship
programs, provide assistance for ed-
ucational program development, and
resolve to participate in the educa-
tional process. The concern that in-
dustry has for the exercise of undue
influence is of little consequence
among people of good will. The need
for good communications and mutual
support cannot be over-emphasized.
Kindness is very indigestible. It dis-
agrees with very proud stomachs.
—William Thackerav
Anger blows out the lamp of the
mind. In the examination of a great
and important question, everyone
should be serene, slow-pulsed ami
calm. —Robert Ingersoi

would form a closed cycle. Biochem-
ically powered boats may not be far
from the present day. Just remember
this: every brewery is a potential elec-
trical power plant if biochemical fuel
cells can tap the fermentation process.
The biochemical fuel cell is only three
years old but seems to be a very
valuable newcomer.
Nor is the regular chemical fuel
cell very old. Intensive research was
started only seven years ago, in 1959.
Today's fuel cells are only the be-
ginnings of a whole new field of elec-
trical power production. In 1875 the
internal combustion engine was at
about the same level of development
as the fuel cell is now. And internal
combustion engines have improved
considerably since 1875, no doubt.
CONCLUSION
William T. Reid, project coordina-
tor of Battelle's "Fuel Cell Research
Group," has said that the fuel cell
shows . . . "the most promise of any
direct energy conversion" and that
"small power supply units in remote
areas, too small to be attractive for
nuclear power, but where problems
of fuel supply are dominant, will also
provide useful applications for fuel
cells . . . When industry eventually
builds fuel cells on a large scale with
a guaranteed life of say, 10,000 hours
and at an installed cost of perhaps
$50 per kilowatt capability, then fuel
cells certainly will go into many ap-
plications scarcely conceived today."
Continued fuel cell research prom-
ises to solve some of the many prob-
lems of fuel cell construction. Better
materials for electrodes, electrolytes,
fuels, and catalysts must be found be-
fore the marvels of the fuel cells can
be unveiled. Noting the use of fuel
cells in our space program I must say
that I think fuel cells will get "down
to earth" soon.

wants two kinds of mechanical engineers:
1. burning with ambition to reach manager's status
as soon as possible
• College grade-point average on the high side in
technical subjects
Secretly admitted to self at certain point in undergraduate career
that the scholar's way of life is for other people bill smart enough
to have kept secret from the professors who are, after till, scholars.
Diploma in, secret out.
• Seeks prosperous, highly diversified employer
Competitive personality who wants to play on a strong, long-
Jasting team in the big leagues.
• Unafraid of choices and changes
With a mechanical engineering background, we might find him
adept at keeping a troupe of welders happy on a new petro-
chemical project, or designing a new type of machine for the
lithographic industry, or organizing a small laser-manufacturing
department, or operating a large magnetic tape plant, or profit-
ably piloting one of the world's major industrial corporations.
2. able to hold a manager's job in time but sure he
wouldn't like it
• College grade-point average on the high side in
technical subjects
Why not? The subjects were intrinsically interesting, and most
of the professors proved to have a clear understanding of them.
• Seeks prosperous, highly diversified employer
To practice modern mechanical engineering—this is not 1936—
one needs scope, contacts, and resources.
• Unafraid of choices and changes
With a mechanical engineering background, he might choose to
take a high leap over the interdisciplinary wall into solid slate
physics, pull some excessively generalized equations out of a
journal that others on the circulation list quickly glance at and
pass along. Six months later he may have a new composition of
matter on board a ship bucking the solar wind to Mars.
What is said here about mechanical engineers is equally applicable to chemical
engineers and electrical engineers. Our expansion rate now demands technical
people who, at the one extreme, are still fresh from the classroom with its
benefits and, at the other, have had ten years of practice in their professions and
are now ready to select a lifetime employer. We olTer a choice of three communi-

ENGINEERING
There are a number of striking changes which are
occurring in the responsibilities which engineers assume
today. Engineers have always taken the responsibility
for the design and construction of major technical
projects involving the expenditure of millions of dollars,
for both industry and government. In this regard,
one traditionally thinks of such projects as major
transportation systems, a new suspension bridge, a
building of unprecedented height and size. However,
in modern technological developments this might
equally well be a supersonic transport, a space vehicle,
desalinization to provide desperately needed fresh
water, or a major communication system. Certainly
engineers will continue to take the leadership for the
technological developments that will take place in this
era of tremendously rapid change.
However, in addition to these technological areas,
today's engineers are taking greater responsibility in the
management of the total business enterprise, Scientific
American recently reported on a study
entitled "The Big Business Executive." This study
involved a careful analysis of the social and educational
backgrounds of executives in major corporations. This
study was correlated with several earlier studies so
that the report covered a total period 1900 to 1964.
The most striking conlusion was the tremendous inrease
in the number of these exeutives who had an engineering
education, and who had begun their careers as engineers.
In 1900 only 5% of these executives had an engineering
degree, as compared with 33% in 1964.
The rise of the engineering executive is but one of
many indications that, as our society becomes even more
technologically oriented, engineers will be called upon
to an increasing extent to assume responsibilities for
which not only economic, but social, cultural, and
political implications of greater and greater import.
These facts seem to argue for several trends in
engineering education in the post-World War II period.
Perhaps the most significant of these has been the
increased demand for mathematics and basic science
in engineering curricula, often, of course at the expense
of applied engineering courses. Accompanying this
has been the demand for more "liberal arts" in
engineering schools and colleges.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


demand for graduate engineering education. Ten years
ago in the United States one Master's degree was
awarded for every eight Bachelor's degrees. In 1964,
one Master's degree was awarded for every three
Bachelor's degrees. There is reason to believe that this
trend will continue. This is probably indicative of
(1) the need to develop integrated curricula which
effectively combine science, liberal arts, and the more
specialized engineering subjects, and (2) the necessity
of dealing with the explosive growth of the body of
knowledge in the several engineering disciplines.
Another aspect of engineering education that is of
interest to us is the increasing number of engineering
graduates who continue their formal education in other
professional schools, such as Business and Law.
Engineering education has proven to be an excellent
preparation for careers other than engineering.
This all sounds as though we are interested in
preparing engineering students for work in areas other
than engineering disciplines. Such is not the case.
We are interested, however, in remaining aware of the
purposes to which an engineering education may be put.
It is clear that one does not take up the practice of
engineering with the deliberate intent of becoming
an engineering executive. Most of those cited in the
article in the Scientific American were people who
progressed through a great variety of complex
engineering assignments to a place where their intel-
lectual skills and personal attributes could be more
effectively used in an executive than in an engineering
capacity. Their success was almost certainly based on
their capacity to excel in the practice of the engineering
profession.
Our goal at The University of Michigan is to provide
the finest engineering education possible. The ultimate
application of the knowledge gained in the various
programs of study here will, of course, be directed
toward goals that are individually derived.

Industry's choice for severe service.
GRINNELL DIAPHRAGM VALVES
The many features inherent in the
basically simple design of Grinnell
diaphragm valves make these valves
industry's choice for severe service.
The diaphragm, for example, pro-
vides two-way protection against
contamination: (1) valve lubricants,
dirt, or other foreign matter can't
enter the product stream; (2) the
product stream is sealed off from
contact with the bonnet mechanism.
In addition, valve body and body
linings, as well as diaphragms, are
available in a wide choice of mate-
rials to meet virtually any require1-
ment.
and engineers in over 60 major cities.
(5) the experience (over 100 years

ask Woods Hole.
Now glass can do what metals can —and more. Much more.
Ask Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
For years, the only way to get a sample of the ocean's floor
was to lower what they call a "bottom corer" on a wire and
then laboriously haul it up again. Not any more. Now a
"Boomerang Corer"-made for Woods Hole by Benthos, Inc.
— is simply tossed overboard and allowed to plunge freely.
When it slams into the ocean floor, it drives a sample of sedi-
ment into a hollow tube inside the corer.
The impact releases two glass spheres that can do what
most hollow metals can't: withstand the tremendous pres-
sures at the bottom of the ocean. They tug the tube loose and
float it to the surface. A flashing beacon inside one of the
spheres pinpoints its location for the waiting ship.
Today glass can be made to maintain constant electrical
properties at missile speeds. Be a heat exchanger in a gas tur-
bine engine. Save weight without sacrificing strength. Con-
duct or insulate. Bend. Not bend. Break. Not break. Melt.
Not melt. Do whatever you want it to. It is the most versatile
basic engineering material.
For solutions to their problems, industry and government
are coming to Corning. Because Corning is the glass-master.
We are widely diversified, internationally based, and have
one of the most daring, expert and imaginative engineering
staffs. Plus, a marketing principle that concentrates on devel-
oping products only in areas where a need exists and no prod-

after
graduation,
what
will they do
for me?
Every man with any job hunting experience knows not to ask that question.
And yet, we think it has some validity. After all, a man's growth can
depend as much on the company he works for as the company's growth
depends on the man (remember, there are no statues to committees).
So to invest in your growth, and ours, every young graduate engineer
who joins the Timken Company spends up to four years in one of 22 in-
dividualized training programs.
Extensive training
Instruction takes place on the job and in the classroom. Later on there are
executive development programs at leading universities.
But don't misunderstand us. The Timken Company is not a graduate
school. With us, you earn as you learn.
As one of our engineers, you'll learn much of what we know about tapered
roller bearings, or fine alloy steel, and their infinite applications. Hopefully,
you'll teach us something, too.
You can be an indoor-type working on straight application engineering,
research, testing and production. Or you can be an indoor-outdoor-type
and work in sales engineering. It doesn't matter—choice of assignment is
up to you.
Challenging assignments
If you choose the latter group, you'll work in automotive, industrial, and
railway bearing sales—or steel sales—helping customers solve their engineering
problems, which are also ours.
Some of our recent efforts: bearing engineering for a telephone cable-laying
ship now crossing the Pacific, the Alweg Monorail, the world's tallest crane
and biggest strip mining shovel, Craig Breedlove's Spirit of America, a
moveable grandstand for the new District of Columbia stadium. Steel prob-
lem solving for Atlas missile silos, Project Mohole, the latest Kaman Heli-
copters, a 400-foot crane boom and hundreds of automotive gear and die
applications.
We won't forget you
Advancement is not restricted to one department or division. A steel sales
engineer may be transferred to automotive sales and from there to Inter-
national. Whatever your job, we'll never forget where we've put you. This is
one of the advantages of working for a company that is the world's largest
producer of tapered roller bearings and a foremost producer of seamless
steel tubing, but is not the world's largest corporation. We employ about
20,000.
The Timken Company has three products: Bearings, Steel, Rock Bits.
Uses for these products number in the growing thousands. And there is
always something new stirring.
The dramatic switch of the nation's railroad freight cars to roller bearings,
a field we pioneered, is an example.
An international company
There are 31 Timken Company sales offices in the United States and Canada.
Practically every major city has one.
We serve markets in 119 countries from 14 manufacturing plants located
in Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, France, South Africa and the U.S.
And we're still growing strong.
If you are, too, we'd like to hear from you. Write to Department MC for

THE TUOVBLE
"Copyright 1954, by Harper's Magazine, Inc.
Reprinted by Special Permission."
Each spring, with the coming of
the crocus, the campus of every
college that can boast an engineering
school undergoes its annual invasion.
Recruiting agents from large indus-
trial concerns descend on the students
with attractive offers of employment;
some blue-ribbon institutions receive
proposals from a single company to
hire the entire senior class. So impor-
tant are these future engineers to in-
dustry that the professional recruiter
who can charm large numbers of them
into the services of his employer in
advance of graduation has become
more valuable, and more highly paid,
than the engineers he recruits.
There are just not enough engi-
neers in the United States to go round
—not enough to meet minimum na-
tional needs at present, let alone in
the future. During the past four years
in which the shortage has grown acute,
the yearly supply of engineering grad-
uates has gone steadily down. Our
retort! sharply contrasts with that of
the Soviet Union, where the annual
number has been increasing—as Ben-
jamin Fine recently pointed out in the
New York Times—and is now two and
one-hall times our own. If the number
of engineers is any indication, we are
losing the race for technical superior-
ity.
This is the somber reality behind
the organized—and often ludicrous-
courting of engineering students: the
full-page ads in the college news-
papers, expense-paid tours of the com-
pany plants during winter and spring
vacations, and reams of propaganda
done up in the glossiest Madison Ave-
nue style. Youngsters with two years'
experience at Amalgamated Washnut
appear in testimonials, looking re-
laxed and well fed, to endorse the
company. The text suggests that in-
dustry has been stagnant, awaiting
the arrival of this year's senior, who
will immediately on joining Amalga-
mated find himself on an upward
escalator to wealth and prestige.
Such is the young engineer's intro-
duction to his profession. During his
subsequent period of adjustment to
industry, however, the aftereffect of
these gaudy techniques may be an un-
pleasant one. Having overrated his
value to society, he may be overly
disillusioned when he finds he is less
valuable than he thought. And how
valuable is he? Obviously the engi-
neer is essential to the industrial
scheme of things, but it is not so ob-
vious what he does or why he does it.
One of the engineer's worst disillu-
sionments can be his discovery that
his function is little understood—
either by the public, by his employer,
or even by himself.
Not long ago, for example, there
was a sharp decline in the perform-
ance of a group of electronic engineers
in the New jersey plant of a large
television manufacturer. Fated with
the problem of firing these scarce men,
or keeping drones on the payroll, the
company's personnel department de-
cided to hold a grievance session,
where at last the engineers confessed
the real source of their dissatisfaction.
After several years of arduous effort—
and startling improvements in the
complicated mechanism they were
making—they had suddenly been told
that the product was being dropped
and that they would be assigned to
other work.
These men were bitterly angry at
the company, the front office, and the
people they called "buckslip shuf-
flers," and soon their complaints at
being unappreciated were flying across
the table. At some length a compam
official tried to explain that the item
had become economically impractic-
able to produce and that "cost-re-
grouping imperatives" required it-,
being dropped. Quite unconvinced,
one young scientist hotly announced
that he was quitting. He would look
for another job, he said, "where I'll
have a chance to work on pure engi-
neering without having to worry about
these commercial problems."
Granted that this unhappy social-
ist had a case; many companies do for
economic or psychological reason',
many things their own engineers know
to be inefficient. Yet it is a good ex
ample of how an industry, crying foi
engineers, can fail to get the most from
its own. This is the real "inefficiency,
this abrasive friction that is caused
when two conceptions of engineering
grate against each other. I am afraid
this particular engineer will discover,
in the next few years, that the so-called
pure technician is becoming an ana
chronism. And I am afraid that he will
not be the only engineer to be em-
bittered and frustrated by that dis-
covery.
Anyone who doubts the seriousiie^
with which industry takes the engineei
shortage need only refer to the Hell1
Wanted—Male section of any large
metropolitan newspaper. An informal
check I have made of the Sund.o
New York Times, off and on over an
extended period, has generallv re-
vealed about fifteen columns anions
the fifty-odd in the classified section
to be ads for engineers. This tops even
the shortage of salesmen, who rani

Numerous proposals have been
made to remedy this situation, niosi

of them by enlarging the supply of
engineering manpower. Some have
suggested study of the obstacles that
turn students away from engineering
early in their education. General
Leslie R. Groves, the military engineer
who ran the wartime atomic-bomb
project, has even argued that "failure
lo teach the fundamentals of arithme-
tic" is the major cause of trouble and
that restoration of corporal punish-
ment in the classroom is the way to
remove it. Since the time it takes to
train an engineer is so long, however,
these solutions can have no immediate
effect. Rarely do the most enlightened
discussions—including that of the late
Dr. Karl T. Compton of MIT, in an
issue of the Scientific American de-
voted to the human resources of the
United States—raise the question we
ought to ask, which is how to use
effectively the engineers we already
liave.
The National Society of Profes-
sional Engineers is a notable excep-
tion, for a study it has made indicates
the serious possibility that we are now
wasting our most scarce and expensive
manpower. Assuming this is true, the
solution would appear to be simple:
study what engineers do, identify the
non-engineering portions of it, and
solve the engineering shortage by elim-
inating them. Unfortunately this is
not so easy as it sounds, for in first
asking what an engineer is we will en-
counter conflicting views.
One is the engineer as society sees
him—which is anyone who has accum-
ulated technical knowledge above the
workman stage, a definition that could
easily include many salesmen and ac-
countants. Second, there is the theo-
retical scientist's version of the engi-
neer—which pictures him as a watered
down physicist, chemist, or mathema-
tician; a sort of hairy-chested scientist-
gone-wrong, who strides aggressively
around the factory pretending to be a
scientist. (Allied with this the busi-
nessman's view of the engineer, which
reflects a similar scorn.) Third, and
most complicated of all, is the engi-
neer's own view of what he is.
To look at these more closely, let
us take them in order—beginning with
the social view, or what we might
oversimplify by calling the Veblenian
engineer. Thorstein Veblen, the ag-
gressively engineering-minded sociol-
ogist and economist of the early years
of this century, believed that the suc-
cess of industrial enterprise was not
the achievement of financiers, or of
"money" interests, but of the tough,
"neutral" technicians — whom he
thought best qualified to manage
society for its own good.
"Without their continued and un-
remitting supervision and direction,"
he wrote in The. Engineers and the
Price System (1921), "the industrial
system would cease to be a system at
all. . . . And it is obvious that so soon
as they shall draw together . . . the
situation [will be] ready for a self-
selected, but inclusive, Soviet of tech-
nicians to take over the economic
affairs of the country. . . ."
Who's in Charge Here?
The Veblenian engineer took an
unconscionable time a-dying, if he is
dead yet. Shortly after the fall of Paris
in 1940, for example. Miss Dorothy
Thompson explained in one of her
columns why Hitler was winning. "He
has been fighting the war with an in-
dustrial and engineering economy,"
she wrote," while the democracies
have been fighting the war with a
money or financial economy." Later
that year, in Harpcr's,Wr. Carl Dreher
forcefully restated the same position,
by
George S. Odiorne
urging the engineers to step into the
driver's seat of American business,
thus "taking the heavy financial boot
off the brakes and letting the produc-
tive machinery run freely."
This urgent advice went unheeded
throughout the war, while the United
States—under the direction of such
"engineers" as a mail order house pres-
ident and a country lawyer from South
Carolina turned politician — spewed
forth the deluge of goods which met
in a single year not only a domestic
demand of a hundred billion dollars
but an additional ninety-six billion
for the military. In August 1944 Presi-
dent Roosevelt ordered the regular
Census of Manufactures moved for-
ward a year in order to tabulate this
miracle of production for posterity.
Military, fiscal, and business managers
—knowing little of the engineering
problems involved — had demanded
the impossible, and got it.
The engineering achievement was
indeed phenomenal. But it was not
the result of lifting "the heavy finan-
cial boot," or of the concealed fiscal
control that Veblen detested. It was
brought about by the overt use of all
the financial, sales, public-relations,
social, psychological, political, legal
(and if necessary illegal) devices for
driving the economy—above all, by a
torrent of money. Companies were
spurred into war production by tax
advantages on plant and equipment,
by guaranteed profits under a system
of cost-plus, and by the implicit threat
of wage-stabilization and manpower
reprisals if they failed to behave. Far
from taking over, the "guild of engi-
neers" eagerly knuckled down to meet
the quotas set by their entrepreneurial
bosses.
Despite this blooming of the econ-
omy without benefit of a central board

signs of that enthusiasm for engineers
which flowered some years before the
war under the name of Technocracy.
Senator Ralph Flanders, himself no
technocrat, expressed the opinion in
Mechanical Engineering not long ago
that engineering techniques can read-
ily be applied to many non-engineer-
ing problems. The nature of human
beings, he explained, is so similar that
they may be classified, arranged, and
handled statistically much as the engi-
neer runs correlations or stress anal-
yses. He felt that even social relations
and politics, which are but aggregate
actions of people, were subject to
sound engineering principles. Thus is
Veblen kepi up to date.
Concurrently, however, a vigorous
debate has been ranging within the
ranks of engineering societies and in
the pages of their journals, with one
side arguing not for engineers to
broaden their functions but to narrow
them. Protests are made that today's
engineer is being trained all wrong,
and given too many grubby shop skills
at the expense of scientific knowledge
—which brings us to the theoretical
scientist's view of the engineer. This
holds that the engineer exists chiefly
to convert the findings of pure re-
search into practical applications, and
therefore that the best engineer is the
one most thoroughly steeped in sci-
ence.
To the "pure" scientist, the ultimate
use of his findings is far less important
than the basic research which pro-
duced them. The newest electronic
device is simply a reshaping of known
principles: the latest synthetic raw
material is merely an adaptation of
something a chemist had long ago
learned. Accordingly, the engineer
who docs the adapting can be only a
subordinate on the ladder of science,
an intellectual huckster a few stages
above the Fuller Brush man but no
different in kind.
That this attitude exasperates the
engineers is understandable, but its
worst effect is on their attitude toward
themselves. Guiltily half-convinced of
its validity, some engineers seek to iso-
late themselves by a similar snobbery
from the other end of the scale—where
lie such unscientific groups as the psy-
chologists, economists, sales managers,
and public-relations counselors. More
often than we can afford, this brings
about disastrous consequences to re-
search, such as those which overtook
the television concern in New Jersey.
Yet, at the same time, from this
other end itself, the hapless engineer
encounters as much disdain from the
"pure" businessman as he gets from
"pure" scientists. He is by no means
as lavishly paid as his scarcity might
lead you to suppose, and even within
industries of a highly technical nature
his prestige may be far lower than that
of the most junior executive. Com-
menting on a Fortune article which
stated that the ratio of engineers to
non-engineers had risen, the engineer-
ing vice president of a large electrical
company wrote as follows:
This results not from an in-
crease in the proportion of engi-
neering work but rather from the
fact that engineers, as relatively
cheap help, are now used for so
many other activities than those
for which they were trained. Any-
how, there is a general assumption
that you can make more money
being a manager. This has gone
so far in my company that all
engineers in supervisory positions
are designated "managers of engi-
neering." If the engineers, instead,
were valued highly enough to be
provided with secretarial service,
draftsmen, technical assistance,
skilled mechanics, production
c hasers, etc., sufficient to free them
for the job which they alone can
do, then I am sure it would be
found not only that they could
turn out more and better work
but that the number of young
men taking engineering training
would rise in proportion to the
visible rewards. . . .
This engineer's personal plaint
brings us closer to the crux of the
matter—the demand on engineers for
what they often regard as "non-engi-
neering" work. Yet getting other peo-
ple to do these jobs is not the whole
solution, for it means accepting at
face value the engineer's view of him-
self—a view that is not always as clear-
cut or as realistic as the engineer him-
self may think.
Early in his training, the budding
engineer is usually given a definition
of his objective—to understand the
principles of science in order to apply
them to the use of Man. It is a chal-
lenging conception, implying the
mission of this one profession to sus-
tain the industrial world through its
special power to convert abstract and
impractical ideas into useful and
beautiful objects. It demands much
in the way of imagination, energy,
and creativeness. Psychologically, it
offers one of the most satisfying of
careers, with a sense of adequacy and
balance that is often lacking in other
occupations. Yet these are its jx&gt;ten
tialities rather than its precise condi
lion today; and the contrast—in the
light of the current "shortage"—raises
essential questions about the engi-
neer's role, and his long-range status
in modern society.
The "Engineering Mind"
If you ask the graduate of an engi-
neering college what an engineer is,
he will probably tell you that an en-
gineer is the graduate of an engineer-
ing college. He and his fellow degree-
holders see themselves as the '"real"
members of the profession, as opposed
to the hybrids and parasites who cling
about the fringes. The degree-holders
compose the influential societies,
which in turn have a large influence
on the engineering colleges: they make
up the voice of engineering.
Unfortunately, it is from these men
that the greatest pressure comes for
the isolation of engineering from both
science and business. Confident that
the engineering curriculum is a thing
of enduring and beautiful perfection,
they attribute to the engineering grad-
uate alone that set of mental habits
called the "engineering mind"—a tool
so versatile and unique that it confers
a virtual monopoly over logical proc-
esses to its possessor.
In any society that keeps careers
open to all, each professional group
has the delicate task of maintaining
standards without becoming an ex-
clusive club; the basic demands on
engineers will always be that their
bridges and buildings stand up, but
the idea of any profession as a closed
corporation is inevitably frustrating,
both to outsiders and to its members.
As long as the folklore of the trade
pictures the engineer as poised and
self-sufficient — evenly balanced l&gt;e-
tween two chasms into which he must
never fall — then he will feel a rigid
determination not to be tipped too
far either way, lest the whole guild
come crashing clown. And it is such
anxiety, in good part, which underlies
the overt complaints about salary, job
definition, and a higher place in the
industrial hierarchy. To their credit,
many thoughtful engineers recognize
this, and realize also that the solution
lies in a voluntary evolution in engi-
neers' ideas about themselves. Much
of the "watering-down" of engineering
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


and prefer to call "blending"—has
been brought about at engineers' ini-
tiative.
This is not a one-sided affair, how-
ever, with engineers doing all the com-
promising. A major responsibility for
the best use of their talent lies with
management—not only in organizing
their jobs but most especially in the
instruction it offers them when they
arrive in the plant. Current practice
assumes that the way to increase tech-
nical efficiency is to increase technical
in-plant training. My own conclusion,
after some study of the question, is
exactly the opposite—that the best case
can be made for more exposure of
embryo engineers to economics, litera-
ture, law, psychology, history, political
science, and as much purely general
information as they can absorb. This
is no educator's plea for the humani-
ties but a genuine conviction on my
part that no other device to increase
the engineer's efficiency will work. Not
only in the universities, but also in the
high-powered company training pro-
grams, we continue to train them for
jobs that in fact no longer exist.
For the present-day engineer, the
transition from university to labora-
tory or factory is easily made—it just
means going from one school to an-
other. His first year is frequently spent
in what amounts to a post-graduate
engineering course at company head-
quarters, where the general technical
principles learned at college are sup-
plemented by the specific information
the company requires. It is on gradu-
ation from this school that the engi-
neer finds adjustment most difficult,
for it is here that he must begin the
process of "unlearning." Idea by idea,
he must clear his mind of "pine" engi-
neering in order to make way for such
mundane considerations as cost, mar-
ketability, consumer foibles, company
folklore, union contracts, and the per-
sonality quirks of the chief engineer-
in short, all the finely tooled and deli-
cately adjusted machinery that keeps
society going. Often his work may con-
sist of a "project" in which he will
have to communicate intelligently
with other technicians, suppliers, cus-
tomers, lawyers, advertisers, and lay-
men. When he is incompetent to
handle these relationships his efficiency
suffers, and all too often his training
has given him little help.
Similar adjustment is demanded of
the new engineer if his work happens
to lie close to the frontiers of science,
where he finds to his dismay that the
questions which present themselves
are not so categorical as the ones he
encountered in the classroom. In fact
he discovers that in the very vanguard
of science, on the edge of the undis-
covered, the "answers" may be as in-
definite as the ones he was given in his
college courses in economics, sociology,
or the arts. If he is unequipped to
work in this climate of uncertainty
and doubt, then his efficiency suffers
further. Here again a great unlearning
process must take place before he will
be able to plunge, with relish and
confidence, into problems that permit
of no definite "solution." Inevitably
the successful engineer will make this
adjustment, but meanwhile time and
effort—his own and others'—will have
been wasted.
The Skilled Barbarian
The need for engineers in the mid-
twentieth century is not merely for
more of them, but for more of them
who can fit effectively into the non-
engineering world. Attempts to force-
feed the profession, or artificially to
elevate its prestige, can only mean a
progressive withdrawal by engineers
from society's going concern. Scorn,
antipathy, or indifference before the
demands of bargaining, persuasion,
debate, and compromise will even-
tually result in a loss both of status
and of voice for the very men on
whom a technical civilization must
heavily depend. Their need is for an
ability to visualize the culture in
which they live—not as a collection of
castes in which theirs alone is cus-
todian of the public weal, but as a
moving balance of interests that
naturally conflict, intermingle, and
change. They must undo the damage
of an education which treats engineer-
ing as knowledge, and engineers as
individuals, as though they could not
be identified with the real needs and
aspirations of the rest of society.
Already numerous engineering
schools have turned their efforts in
this direction. Among the admirable
results has been increasing use of a
combined plan, by which students can
lake three years at a liberal arts college
and then transfer for the remaining
two years to an engineering institu-
tion. Each of these graduate schools
may associate itself with a number of
colleges; as Columbia has done with
forty - three, Carnegie Tech with
twenty, MIT with fifteen, Rensselaer
Polytech with thirteen, Case and Illi-
nois with ten, and so on. The student
receives in college enough mathe-
matics and science to prepare him for
advanced study, but at the same time
he gets the humanities, arts, and social
sciences that few specialist schools
could possibly provide. At the end of
five years, he is given two degrees—a
Bachelor of both the Arts and Sciences.
This, in the long run, is a more prom-
ising solution for the engineer "short-
age" than any other I have seen pro-
posed.
Clearly it is not the way to beat the
Russians at the game of Who's Got
the Most Engineering Graduates? But
we have had enough experience with
industry to know that mere numbers
are not the answer. Technical society
is not measured in its productivity of
degree-holders, but of goods and serv-
ices; and no one of its parts is more
essential than the interplay of every
part with every other. Most important
of all, the contest for technical pre-
eminence must not lead us into the
trap of encouraging that type of tech-
nician who has been called the "skilled
barbarian"—the specialist tightly fitted
into his own slot and serenely indiffer-
ent to the "unscientific" turmoil in
which the rest of us live. Such a lux-
ury, in 1955, we can ill afford.

RESEARCH
Every morning most of us get out
of bed, bathe, shave or put on make-
up, don a variety of garments, eat
breakfast—all without conscious effort.
But to the crippled or disabled per-
son these and countless other little
routine acts can be staggering. The
shoelace or shirt button or lipstick—
the things most people take for
granted—becomes a fiendish device.
To help physically handicapped
people out of their restricted life and
make them more self-reliant and voca-
tionally productive is the basic aim of
the six-year-old University of Michi-
gan Orthetics Research Project, sup-
ported by the U.S. Vocational Rehabil-
itation Administration. Its teamwork,
under the direction of Dr. James W.
Rae, jr., chairman of the department
of physical medicine and rehabilita-
tion, is leading to a significant increase
in our knowledge of the complex bio-
mechanics involved in orthetic devices.
Orthetic devices are essentially
appliances, such as braces or splints,
applied to the body that assist the
disabled person in his functional ac-
tivities, in contrast to prosthetic
devices which replace missing parts of
the body. The widespread need lor
orthetic devices has long been known
and ingenious gadgets now help dis-
abled persons. Hut, in some ways, or-
thetic research is still the infant
prodigy of medicine.
According to a 19!&gt;7 national esti-
mate, more than 10,000 poliomyelitis
patients had paralysis of one arm,
about 15,000 had some paralysis of
both arms and more than 3,700 had
severe paralysis of both arms. Grim
as these figures may seem, they are
only a small part of the problem.
Numerous other diseases and injuries
cause functional losses. Therapists and
some laymen have come up with a
wide variety of orthetic devices—some
therapeutic and some not—over the
years. In fact, the development of
such self-help devices has generally
outrun the techniques for intelligent
evaluation and prescription of these
aids. The problem, simply, is that we
urgently need more basic knowledge
of the many factors involved. With
this in mind, the U-M Project has
concentrated not so much on produc-
ing orthetic devices as on understand-
ing what the devices should try to
accomplish. This has meant funda-
mental studies in anatomy, biome-
chanics, physiology, and many others.
Consider the U-M scientists' efforts
in biomechanic investigation. Normal
persons seldom realize it but they cat
with a tremendous variety of hand
motions. Slow eaters, fast eaters, and
fussy eaters show different patterns
of movements, U-M researchers found.
The napkin is used oftener than
usually assumed. The fork and knife
are used in a variety of motions that
are often complex. The handling of
fluids, however, is different. The
table - to - mouth pathway of, say, a
drinking glass becomes a less complex
motion. This hand-motion study is a
relatively simple example of the basic
study of human mechanics by the
University investigators. In this case,
they needed a thorough knowledge of
hand motions in daily activities for
efficient design of arm braces to re-
store arm and hand function.
Far more complex Michigan studies
are contributing to our biomechanical
knowledge. To illustrate: their efforts
to design a device for the correction
of arthritic hand deformities led to
an examination of the cause of the
deformity, and to redesign a feeder
they had to carry out a thorough
study of the mechanics of the upper
extremity as well as that of the de-
vice. (A feeder is a device to support
and permit movement of the severely
paralyzed upper extremity. With a
feeder, a patient may be able to feed
himself, comb hair, wash and do lim-
ited work on a surface in front of him.)
Important as they are, biomechanical
studies do not tell the whole story. In
fact, the problems facing the I'M
Project are so complex that an inter-
disciplinary approach is needed and
accordingly a research team was selec-
ted which crossed many departmental
lines.
During its first five years, the L*-M
Project has limited its attention to
the upper extremities, with particular
attention to the problems of flaccid-
type paralysis (that is, weakened oi
totally non-functioning muscles) and
deformities of the hand resulting from
rheumatoid arthritis. One phase of the
project has been its medical-psysiologic
studies. For example, the U-M scien-
tists theorized that the closer an or-
thetic device could come to replacing
the primary function lost in a disabil-
ity, the greater might be the return ol
function.
This concept, when applied to the
problems of flaccid paralysis, suggested
some interesting possibilities. Since
the primary function lost is the
transmission of signal from the brain
to the muscle, might not it be possible
to restore the lost function by activa-
ting denervated muscles artificial^
under the control of the will? In a
series of tests with animals, the U-M
investigators have given, on long-term
daily basis, regulated closes of electri-
cal stimulation to denervated muscle
and measured excitability, fatigue oi
tension in both the denervated muscle
and its opposite normal. This study
is still far from complete, but the re-
sults so far have been promising.
There is good indication that stimu-
lus can be delivered directly to de-
nervated muscle over long periods of
time without excessively damaging
the muscle.
The U-M researchers have not en-
tirely overlooked the design of orthe-
tic devices, which is intimately related
to biomechanical studies. Here in
brief are some of their major accom-
plishments to date:
Refinement of the design of the
"feeder," eliminating some of the
shortcomings associated with previous
feeder designs. It is believed that the
Michigan-developed design represents
a good balance between mechanical

WATER
... An Evaluation of the Nation's Water Supply
RITA SARNO
Water—"a chemical compound hav-
ing the formula ITO, one of the
most abundant anil widely distributed
substances on the face of the earth.
It occurs in nature in the solid, liquid,
and gaseous states of aggregation
known as ice or snow, water, and
steam or water vapor, respectively.
Water is a necessary constituent in
the cells of all animal and vegetable
tissues and in the crystals of many
minerals."
The above constitutes the definition
and description provided by the En-
cyclopedia Britannica of hydrogen
oxide, a colorless, odorless, tasteless
and otherwise innocuous substance
whose only salvation from anonymity
lies in the fact that it forms the very
basis of life as we know it.
Water covers nearly five-sevenths
of the terrestrial globe. It is found in
its pure state both on and below the
earth's surface as well as in the atmos-
phere in tremendous amounts. In ad-
dition, water is present in all living
plants and animals as well as in rocks
and minerals. When we consider this
apparent abundance, how can it be
that throughout the world today na-
tions large and small, technologicallv
advanced and underdeveloped, rich
and poor alike, all face a common di-
lemma — A critical shortage of this
seemingly most plentiful of our re-
sources?
The answer lies in the fact that the
problem is not one of quantity, but
of distribution. Obviously, the need
for water varies with location. So, too,
of course, does supply—but not always
in the proper proportion. Some fac-
tors governing the amount of water
required by an area include:
1) Living standard—In certain parts
of the Near East, the per capita
rate of water consumption is as
low as three to five gallons of water
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


American city, however, a per cap-
ita consumption of nearly 117 gal-
lons of water per clay is not un-
common.
2) Quality and cost of available water
—Where water is costly, or difficult
to obtain, its use diminishes com-
mensurately.
3) Nature of local industries—Indus-
try requires vast amounts of water,
cheap and readily available. Un-
fortunately, water used for indus-
trial purposes is seldom fit for
human consumption afterward. In
the absence of any feasible method
of reclamation, such water must
be regarded as "lost."
4) Public Use—Significant amounts of
water are necessary for public sani-
tation, waste disposal, and for use
against fires.
The preceding constitutes, of course,
only a partial list. If we stop to con-
sider for a moment the diverse factors
which tend to increase local water
consumption, it is not necessary to
stretch one's imagination very far to
understand how, for instance, a city
the size of New York could find itself

in a situation where, barring any un-
anticipated changes in annual rainfall,
all major reservoirs will be essentially
dry within one year of the date of the
printing of this article. And, in this,
New York is not unique. Indeed, ac-
cording to an article in a recent pub-
lication of the National Academy of
Sciences, the entire nation faces a
serious future water shortage. This is
due largely to the result of increased
agricultural needs as a consequence
of recent efforts to increase the amount
of arable land through widespread
application of irrigation techniques.
This situation is by no means unique
to our nation, nor even to our present
technological era. To one Sextus
Julius Frontinus, a citizen and his-
torian of ancient Rome, we are in-
debted for the following short history
of the construction of one of the less-
appreciated grandeurs of that city —
namely, its water-works.
"For 441 years from the foundation
of the city, the Romans were satisfied
with the use of such waters as they
drew from the Tiber, from wells, or
from springs—. In the thirtieth year
after the beginning of the Samnite
War, the Appian aqueduct was
brought into the city by Appius
Claudius Crassus."
The rules governing the distribu-
tion of water brought into the city by
its system of aqueducts would appear
complex even by todays standards;
however, the central government, in
an effort to clarify the procedure for
the general public, retimed it to one
cardinal rule:
"No one shall draw water without
an authorization from Caesar."
Also in evidence at this time were
attempts to conserve water. To this
end it was decreed that:
"The number of public fountains
shall be neither increased nor dimin-
ished."
For another account from a later
period, we turn to that provided by
an indenture of 1612 relating to the
"New River," the first aqueduct (com-
pleted in 1609) to supply the city of
London.
"Wee doe by these presents for us
our heirs and Successors straightly
charge and command all psons and
psons whatsoever That they or anic of
them doe not hereafter cast or putt

So much for early attempts to pre-
vent public water works from going to
the dogs (Catts, dead horses, etc...).
It is apparent from these early rendi-
tions that the idea of transporting
water from areas of plentiful supply
to those experiencing shortage, as well
as concern lest available sources be
overtaxed or rendered unusable as a
result of contamination, cannot be
attributed solely to the more highly
developed creative genius of 20th
century man. Obviously, modern man
has always displayed concern for the
need to insure a readily available
supply of potable water. How, then,
does one explain a situation of the
sort currently plaguing the New York
metropolitan area? As a start, let us
consider the nature of New York
City's water supply and the evolution
of the water-transport system by which
the city is served today.
Up until the year 1840, New York
City's water needs were met by the
Croton Aqueduct, which had a de-
livery capacity of -12 million gallons
per day. By 18*15, however, this was
considered inadequate in view of the
fact that the reserve supply on hand
at any time could be expected to last
no more than twenty days. A new
reservoir was finally constructed in
the year 1862 in Central Park, New
York. This had a capacity of one bil-
lion gallons and delivered a total of
95 million gallons per day. Rut by
this time, the needs of the city had in-
creased so that even this proved to be
inadequate. Indeed, during the sum-
mer, water pressure was so low that
water would not rise above the first
stories of the city's stilling tenements.
In 1885, a conduit from the Bronx
and Bryam Rivers added 28 million
gallons per day to the city's supply.
The second Croton Aqueduct added
another 300 million gallons daily, thus
bringing the city's total daily supply
to '125 million gallons.
On August 16, 1889, New York
Water Commissioner William Dalton
proposed that the city turn to a private
company to supply her ever-increasing
water needs. Thus, a forty-year con-
tract was signed with the Ramapo
Water Company under which New
York City would receive an additional
20 million gallons daily to be taktu
from the Catskill Water Shed at a cost
of seventy dollars per million gallons.
Under the terms of this contract, the
Ramapo Company was granted powers
greater than those granted any other
water company or municipality in
New York state by the legislature. As
a result of this legislation, New York
City found itself severely limited in
the means it had of obtaining addi-
tional water. In 1896, a further re-
striction was placed upon the city with
the passage of the Suffolk County An,
which prohibited the city from tap-
ping Suffolk County water supplies;
and in 1895, the final blow was dealt
when the Creater New York Charter
Act forbade New York City from ex-
tracting water from a source used by
any other city, town, or village. Thus
it was virtually impossible for the
City to develop any new sources of
water.
This intolerable situation was
finally remedied with the repeal of
the Act of 1895 which stripped the
Ramapo Company of its excessive
powers and placed the responsibility
of supplying one of the world's largest
cities with water once more in the
hands of a municipal agency.
The completion of the Catskill
Aqueduct in 1917, and the Scholarie
Reservoir in 1927 added 555 million
gallons per day to the city's supply,
but even this failed to quench the
tremendous and ever-increasing thirst
of the metropolis. In seeming despera-
tion, city officials focused their atten-
tion upon the east branch of the Dela-
ware River as a possible new source
of much-needed water. They were
immediately faced with resistance on
the part of New Jersey and Pennsyl-
vania, who believed that their own
water supplies would be jeopardized
should New York City be permitted
to encroach upon this source. When
the New York Board of Water Supply
recommended that work commence
without the approval of these two
states, an appeal was immediately
lodged with the United Slates Su-
preme Court. The Court ruled, how-
ever, that New York might take up to
440 million gallons of water per day
from the Delaware River "subject to
various safeguards." Construction be-
gan in 1937 on a means of claiming
this additional water, but work was
halted with the advent of World War

serious water shortages in the history
of New York State.
By 1946, the water needs of the
city had risen to the level of 1,055
million gallons per day. Failure to
complete the Delaware River works,
along with a severe reduction in rain-
fall, led to a drought in 1949 which
left the Catskill and Croton Reser-
voirs at less than 33% capacity. By
1950, however, pure chance, in the
form of a good deal of desperately-
needed rain, rescued the city from a
situation which might have proved
catastrophic.
In view of the never-ending race on
the part of city officials to keep a step
or two ahead of New York's skyrocket-
ing water needs, (a race which began
in 1840 and as yet shows no sign of
slackening pace) the fact that now, in
the year 1966, the city of New York
is still plagued by the possibility of a
drought even more severe than that
which raised such concern in 1949
should not come as a surprise. Pro-
vision lor public water supply is some-
thing which requires planning far in
advance of time of actual need. The
establishment of a pumping station,
or even the construction of yet another

Growth of municipal water supplies
reservoir will serve to do little more
than postpone the making of a de-
cision crucial not only to New York,
Growth of sewerage facilities lags water supply
but to the rest of the nation as well.
It is apparent that the so-called "con-
ventional" of providing for a con-
venient, economically feasible system
of public water supply (aqueducts,
reservoirs, etc. . .) will one day no
longer prove capable of meeting the
needs of our nation's sprawling cities.
The facts surrounding the water situ-
ation in this country are these:
1) The nation faces a serious future
water shortage. The average total
rainfall in the United States
amounts to approximately 4300
billion gallons daily, of which only
one-fourth appears as usable run-
off, the rest being lost to evapora-
tion. Three hundred-twenty billion
gallons per day are withdrawn for
use, of which nearly one-third is
not recoverable. Ninety-five per
cent of this loss is the result of
rapidly expanding agricultural
needs.
2) A rapidly increasing population,
especially that fraction living in
arid and semi-arid portions of the
country will help to bring about
a significant increase in the esti-
mated water needs of the nation.
3) An increased per capita consump-
tion of water may be expected due

The Company's first engine, the Wasp, took
to the air on May 5,1926. Within a year the
Wasp set its first world record and went on
to smash existing records and set standards
for both land and seaplanes for years to
come, carrying airframes and pilots higher,
farther, and faster than they had ever &lt;
before.
In recent years, planes powered by Pratt
&amp; Whitney Aircraft have gone on to set
new standards of performance in much the
same way as the Wasp had done in the
1920's. The 727 and DC-9 are indicative of
the new family of short-to-medium range
jetliners which are powered by the highly
successful JT8D turbofan. Examples of
current military utilizations are the J5S-
powered Mach 3 YF-12A which recently
established four world aviation records and
the advanced TF30-powered F-lll variable-
geometry fighter aircraft.

tist or engineer beginning his career.
A separate agency functioning within the
Department of Defense, NSA is responsible
for developing "secure" (i.e., invulnerable)
communications systems to transmit and re-
ceive vital information. Within this area, which
encompasses the whole field of cryptology-
the science of codes and ciphers-NSA project
teams pursue a broad spectrum of investiga-
tions taking them well beyond many known
and accepted boundaries of knowledge. Be-
ginning with basic research, these investiga-
tions progress through applied research,
development and design, prototype engineer-
ing, and on into various phases ot applications
engineering.
At NSA you might specialize in any or sev-
eral of these sectors, depending on your
talents and special interests:
ENGINEERING. Antenna/transmitter/receiver
design . . . high speed computers (digital and
analog) . . . transistor circuitry . . . advanced

ging aspects of your projects, and thus help
speed your professional growth.
Outstanding Colleagues
You will work alongside people of enor-
mously varied backgrounds and intellectual
interests, over 500 of whom hold advanced
degrees.
Researchers at NSA also receive constant
stimulus from outside the agency. To assist in
certain program areas, NSA often calls on
special boards of consultants—outstanding
scientists and engineers from industry and
academic centers as well as from other gov-
ernment agencies.
Career Development Opportunities
Your professional growth and earning power
expand from the day you join NSA, without
having to accumulate years of "experience."
NSA career development is orderly and swift;
substantial salary increases follow as you as-
sume more and more responsibility.
A number of NSA career development
programs help shorten the time when you
can contribute at your maximum potential.
These programs include:
ADVANCED STUDY. NSA's liberal graduate
study program affords you the opportunity to
pursue part-time study up to eight hours
each semester and/or one semester or more
of full-time graduate study at full salary. Near-
ly all academic costs are paid by NSA, whose
proximity to seven universities offering a
wealth of advanced courses and seminars is
an additional asset.
IN-HOUSE TRAINING. The new NSA em-
ployee first attends a six-week general orien-
tation program, followed by a period of spe-
cialized classroom study designed to broaden
familiarity with an area or areas of heavy NSA
concern (e.g., communications theory, crypt-
analysis, computer logic and analysis, solid
state physics). Formal study is complemented
by on-the-job training, as you work and learn
under the guidance and direction of highly
experienced associates.
PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, TRAVEL.
The agency fosters a climate of recognition
and advancement for its young professionals
by encouraging participation in professional
association affairs, and assisting you to attend
national meetings, seminars and conferences
as well as visit other research facilities where
related work is underway—government, uni-
versity and industrial—throughout the United
States.
Liberal Personnel Policies, Attractive

"DO NOT DISTURB
MY CIRCLES..."'
In studying the growth and attrition of companies or
countries and the success and failure of endeavors of many
kinds, significant causes can often be found in key executive
decisions.
As the world's technology advances, these vital decisions
tend more and more to require engineering and scientific
inputs and careful, objective study.
The decision maker for management normally does not
have the time nor the background for such a study. If he
relies on the recommendations of his own staff, often their
self-interest will unconsciously (or consciously) influence
recommendations. Similarly, the advice of outside consultants
may be conditioned by the equipment and services they sell,
or hope to sell.
Therefore, there is a clear and increasing need for the
services of organizations which can objectively study the
scientific and engineering aspects of a problem, analyze them,
and distill a clear and definitive recommendation.
This is the role of Raff Analytic Study Associates. It is
a sphere of growing importance. A scientist or engineer in
this particular area of work will have more impact on his
society and on his country's welfare than in any other type of
endeavor.
The importance of the work will be reflected in many forms
of satisfaction to the successful scientist or engineer in this
field.

that's six miles long?
Or reduce the size of something
almost too small to see?
TOUGH jobs... typical of the engineering
work being done day after day at
Western Electric, the manufacturing
and supply unit of the Bell System. And you
can have a hand in solving problems like these.
The six-mile product was a complete tele-
phone cable. How to test it before it was
buried underground — before modifications,
if necessary, became time-consuming and ex-
pensive? The solution was to design an "arti-
ficial cable" — a model a few inches in length
whose electrical characteristics matched
those of the full-size cable. In this way, engi-
neers learned which type of cable would do
the job best, how many repeater stations
would be needed, and where repeater equip-
ment should be installed. Artificial cable lets
us anticipate and solve many other problems
... before they ever arise.
The small product was a thin film circuit
— an electrical path only thousandths of the
thickness of a human hair. How do you de-
sign equipment to make certain parts thinner,
to increase resistance, without altering other
parts? WE engineers used capillary action to
bring liquid only to the desired areas — and
electrolysis brought about the precise reduc-
tion. It's quick in the telling, but it took sharp
minds to arrive at this solution.
Western Electric needs more sharp minds.
Whatever your field is, there are plenty of
opportunities for interesting work, and for
rapid advancement. If you set the highest
standards for yourself and seek a solid future

To build a rectangular color TV tube with more of a picture than the
earlier round tube type, and then squeeze it into a dimensionally
attractive cabinet—you face almost insurmountable challenges.
Just to build a conventional color tube, you must. . .
1. —with absolute precision, lay more than a million red, blue,
and green phosphor dots in a perfect triad pattern over the entire
surface of the picture screen. Why so tough? — because the light
source for the dots is a single ray coming through a pinhole. And it
must be bent by a correction lens with precise mathematical cal-
culation (different for each dot) to pass through over a third-of-
a-million pinholes and fall exactly at a given spot on the screen.
2. —Once you've figured out the phosphor dots, you must then
bend the electron beam broadcast by the TV station so that it
too passes through the third-of-a-million pinholes.
These are just some of the feats you must perform. But after
going through all this, you wind up with a tube with a neck so
long it requires a cabinet nearly a yard deep to hold it. To shorten
the neck requires mathematical calculations and engineering
techniques so demanding they fall beyond any brief description.
The complexity of the 23-inch rectangular color tube develop-
ment is considered by some of our consumer products engineers
even more of a technological challenge than designing some of
the sophisticated command systems required for space flights.
Motorola military engineers tend to disagree.

In order to acquaint the public with the
academic programs of the College, displavs
and demonstrations will be set up by students
from the different departments illustrating
the basic principles and techniques eniplovetl
in their classes. Typical of these will be a
demonstration in three-dimensional photog-
raphy using laser techniques by the Electrical
Engineering Department and some of the
modern surveying techniques by the Civil En-
gineering Department. Many of the Iabora
tory facilities used by the students will be
open and will be demonstrated during the
weekend. Examples of these are the subsonu
and supersonic wind-tunnels used for testing
models and for illustrating principles of aero-
dynamics. Similarly, students of Naval Archi-
tecture and Marine Engineering utilize the
lowing tank for environmental simulation for
testing their theories of fluid mechanics on
ships' hulls.

G-FACTOR FOUND
University of Michigan physicists
reported achieving the first accurate
measurement of the gyromagTieiii
ratio of the free positron—the elec-
tron's anti-matter counterpart, at the
American Physical Society meeting
in New York. Finding this ratio will
further nail down quantum electro-
dynamics, the modern physical theo-
ries of the ultimate structure of matter
and the universe. The experiment
extends to the world of anti-matter, in
fact, one of the key experiments upon
which rest the whole structure ol
modern physics.
U-M Prof. H.R. Crane and Dr
Arthur Rich said they have measured
the positron's gyromagnetic ratio, or
"g-factor," to one part in 100,00ti
They added that continued expert

curacy.
The anti-matter positron and the
electron are among the tiniest of
charged particles. Having both a spin
and a magnetic field, they are ana-
logous to tiny spinning bar magnets.
The g-factor is the ratio of the par-
ticle's spin to its magnetic moment
or magnetic force. "The exact ratio
Viet ween the spin and the magnetic
moment of these particles has come to
be of great importance in testing
modern quantum electrodynamics,"
Crane and Rich explained in an in-
terview. Physicists note the work is
among the most significant in nailing
clown all modern calculations involv-
ing waves and particles, not only
concerning atoms, but concerning also
the ultimate construction of the uni-
verse.
As early as 1950, Crane proposed
means of measuring the g-factor of an
electron. But fellow physicists main-
tained it couldn't be done. They said
attempted measurements would vio-
late the "uncertainty principle." This
holds in effect that you can't measure
things of this nature because you
change what you are trying to measure
in the very act of measurement.
By 1963, however, Crane and a
succession of U-M colleagues had
measured the g-factor of the free elec-
tron. Not only had they measured it
over 13 years, but in the process they
had achieved an accuracy of one part
in 100 million—one of the most ac-
curate measurements in the history of
science. No one has since approached
this, although attempts continue.
"Some of the physicists said we
couldn't do the experiment because a
comment by Niels Bohr about the
uncertainty principles had been mis-
construed by a text book used at the
time," Crane points out. Now physi-
cists say the experiments, by Crane
and his colleagues are among the best
few which soundly substantiate mod-
ern quantum electrodynamics."
So much for the prevalent world of
electrons and matter. But how about
the world of anti-matter? At least one
prominent physicist insists that the
symmetry required by physical theory
demands that half of the universe
consists of anti-matter. Crane and
Rich—then a Ph.D. candidate—turned
in 1962 to measurement of the posi-
tron's g-factor. "The results so far are
in accord with the idea that positrons
are in every way exactly the same as
electrons, excepting their being oppo-
site in charge, and their having an op-
posite magnetic moment in relation
to their direction of spin," the Michi-
gan physicists reported.
But they pointed out that the tech-
nical problems of measuring the posi-
tron's g-factor have proved even
harder than measuring the electron's.
"Negative electrons can be produced
easily and in large numbers," Crane
and Rich note. "With positrons, we
have fewer to work with—a billion
times fewer." A heated filament pro-
duced the negative electrons for the
earlier experiments. To get positrons,
however, the U-M physicists use ra-
dioactive cobalt which produces them
in its process of radioactive decay.
But the basic approach is similar.
After the particles are produced, they
are trapped in a "magnetic bottle,"
where their magnetic moments are
allowed to precess. Measuring the
number of times they precess— the
number of times the particle's axis of
spin weaves in a cone-like rotation in
a known time interval gives the par-
ticle's precession rate. Then, since the
precission rate is related to the spin
and magnetic field, the g-factor ratio
could be very accurately determined
if the magnetic field and other experi-
mental factors are rigidly controlled.
The number of precessions is ob-
tained by determining the orientation
of the particle as it emerges from the
magnetic bottle and comparing it to
the orientation of the particle's spin
axis as it entered the "bottle." Orien-
tation of the emerging electrons was
determined by observing their "scat-
tering," or angle of reflection, off a
target of gold nuclei. The orientation
of positrons is determined by letting
them form positronium, a pseudo-
atom consisting of an electron and
positron orbiting one another briefly
before they blip away in mutual
annihilation. The length of time the
positronium exists reveals the spin
axis orientation of the positron when
it left the bottle, the physicists ex-
plain.
Their present goal, extending the
positron g-factor measurements to an
accuracy approaching that of their pre-
vious work, won't be easy. "In exper-
iments with electrons, we were able
to hold them in the bottle up to a
thousandth of a second and thus mea-
sure very acurately the rate of pre-
cession," they explain. "This is pos-
sible with positrons, but until now,
because of the lower number we have
had to work with, it has been more
practical to hold them only about a
tenth of that time." They explained
that the longer the positrons are held
in the magnetic bottle, the longer it
takes to get the data they need—be-
cause trapping them longer means
they get fewer out and thereby fewer
data per unit of time. Holding them
longer would have made the experi-
ment prohibitively time-consuming.
AERONAUTICS-1914
The first course in aeronautical en-
gineering ever given in the United
States was taught by Prof. Felix Wlad-
islaw Pawlowski at The University of
Michigan in the academic year
1914-15. Pawlowski didn't have an
easy time establishing the course from
which evolved the education of Amer-
ican aircraft designers and, now, astro-
nauts. He came to the United States
in 1910, found himself a job in the
fledgling automotive industry, and set
about to fulfill his goal. He wrote let-

to rising living standards. In 1900,
the average per capita rate of con-
sumption came to approximately
eight gallons per person per day.
By 1950, the daily rate had in-
creased to thirty to fifty gallons
per person. At present, the aver-
age urban dweller uses nearly 117
gallons per day out of which
nearly forty gallons may be con-
sidered pure waste. At this rate,
barring the discovery of any new
sources, or new methods of ex-
tracting water from old sources, by
the year 2000, major metropolitan
areas will find themselves hope-
lessly behind in the effort to supply
urban dwellers as well as local in-
dustries with the water they must
have to meet even their most min-
imal needs.
How then do we solve this most
pressing problem, that of providing
water in adequate quantity and qual-
ity when and where needed? Proposed
solutions generally fall under one of
two headings:
1) Accommodate local needs to locally
available water supply without in-
creasing the latter. Under this heading
we find such methods as:
a) Reduce the number of people
and industries drawing on a partic-
ular source of supply.
b) Attempt to reduce per capita
consumption, as is being attempted
at present in New York City.
c) Attempt to reduce losses occur-
ring in storage, transit, and use.
d) Re-use of existing supplies.
2) The other alternative involves
bringing about an increase in available
water supply. This would include:
a) Providing for water transport
from regions of comparative plenty
to those experiencing a dearth of
usable water.
b) Converting previously unusable
supplies, both local and distant.
Of these, the last appears to be most
promising in all respects with the ex-
ception of cost. Desalination of sea
water; chemical purification of water
tainted by industrial wastes, and re-
circulation of water consumed by the
inhabitants of an area are methods
which only appear feasible on the
printed page. Water purification on
the scale necessary to support the in-
dustrial, agricultural, and every-day
per capita needs of an area would, at
present, render the cost of such
methods prohibitive.
What, then, is to be done? A pro-
gram of intensified research would
certainly appear to be in order to test
out and possibly increase the practica-
bility of the sort of reclamation men-
tioned above, as well as that of other,
seemingly radical suggestions which
are currently receiving consideration,
such as the possibility of inducing
man-directed changes in local climate.
But research takes time, and does not
guarantee a remedy to the situation.
The need for more water, water for
industry, for agriculture — for people,
confronts us NOW. And we dare not
look away. Manipulation of existing
sources of water can only serve to
stave off an impending water crisis
for at best a few years, as is amply
illustrated by the events leading up to
the present water situation in New
York. Provision for an economically
feasible system of water supply, and
one which is flexible enough to per-
mit modification to meet the ever-
expanding needs of a technological
age must be provided for now, while
our water situation is something less
than desperate, that we might keep
ourselves, perhaps not ahead, but at
least abreast of the ever-growing needs
of an ever-thirsty world.
FREEDOM
OF SHAPE...
One of the outstanding advantages
of Malleable Iron Castings
Casting is the simplest and most direct
way of creatingform and shape with metal.
Casting offers almost unlimited freedom
to the designer. A cast design is not re-
stricted by sizes or shapes of mill stock,
accessibility of tools, withdrawal allow-
ances for dies, or other limitations.
Complex shapes, interior cavities, and
streamlined contours, which would be
difficult or impossible to create with other
methods, are simple with a casting.
For instance, consider the complexity
of creating the dozens of teeth, lugs, holes
and collars on this pipe repair clamp. It
would be prohibitively expensive to pro-
duce by any method other than casting.
By using the casting process for economy,
1^ |
and Malleable iron for strength and ducti-
lity, these clamps combine service and
value.
The design freedom made possible by
casting also helps to make parts stronger.
Metal components tolerate loads better
if they are designed to distribute stresses
efficiently. Sharp corners or other abrupt
sectional changes tend to restrict the
uniform distribution of these stresses.
The corner thus becomes a logical site
of fatigue failure. In a casting, it is a sim-
ple matter to round out corners, blend
sections and taper connecting members
to achieve a design which will distribute
stresses.
The illustration shows how stresses "set
up" at sharp corners. A much smoother
transfer of stresses was achieved when
this part was switched to a Malleable
casting (shown on the right).

M.E.&amp;R. . . . Cont. from page 45
ters to 18 colleges and universities-
would any care to hire a person to
teach aeronautics?
Most colleges considered the pro-
posal so fantastic they didn't even
bother to reply, but of the few who
did reply, only Michigan and MIT
expressed any interest. However, MIT
had to decline at that time because of
lack of funds. U-M Engineering Dean
Mortimer E. Cooley could take Paw-
lowski on, however, and have him a
teaching assistant in mechanical engi-
neering in 1913 for a salary of $800
a year. In this position Pawlowski set
up the course for introduction the fol-
lowing year. Cooley was not unre-
served in his endorsement of Pawlow-
ski's activities. He wrote later in his
book, Scientific Blacksmith: "I hid
this course in the Department of Ma-
rine Engineering for a time, for aero-
nautical engineering was not con-
sidered important enough to make it
conspicuous by giving it a prominent
place."
Pawlowski's first course, Theory of
Aviation, for two hours credit, at-
tracted seven students. Four of them
were from "overseas." By 1917. the
course had expanded sufficiently so
that the U-M could grant its first de-
gree in the field, the bachelor of
science in aeronautical engineering.
U-M records show that William Fred-
erick Gerhardt was the first student to
receive it. The following year, in June
1918, four students earned the BS de-
gree in "aero," and Gerhardt earned a
master's degree in aeronautical engi-
neering. At this time, Pawlowski was
promoted to associate professor and re-
lieved of his teaching duties in me-
chanical engineering. He had pre-
pared himself for these tasks by study-
ing aeronautics in 1910 at the Univer-
sity of Paris under Prof. Lucien Mar-
chis. His interest had first been piqued
two years earlier when, at age 34, he
saw a flying exhibition by the Wright
brothers in a field near Paris. At that
time, he had asked the men from Day-
ton to give him flying lessons but
found they had pitched their novelty
toward the very affluent. So he taught
himself.
His efforts later at the U-M were
aided materially by Prof. Herbert Sad-
ler of the Scottish flying family, who
in 1911 had reorganized the U-M Aero
Club and had supervised the building
of a wind tunnel on the U-M campus.
Again, the effort had been stashed
away in a loft in the marine engineer-
ing department. Later Dean of Engi-
neering, Sadler encouraged Pawlowski
and oversaw development of the
course into a department.
Pawlowski retired in 1946 to Pau,
France, where he died February 17,
1951. Since his first days, the Univer-
sity has granted 2,731 degrees in aero-
nautical engineering. Its alumni hold
down some of the most respected jobs
in the industry.

reliability, cost, weight, and appear
ancc. On the basis of favorable pre-
liminary evaluation study, plans have
been made for extending the use anil
evaluation both at the University and
at other centers.
An externally powered arm brace,
for restoring arm and hand function,
has been designed. Each axis of this
experimental brace, called an analog
arm brace, matches the corresponding
axis of the anatomical joint. This de-
sign offers possibility of meeting the
variable patterns of functional loss
that occurs among the disabled. Con-
tinued development, clinical applica-
tion, and evaluation of this brace are
currently being carried out.
A splint for the rheumatoid hand
has traditionally consisted of static
devices designed to minimize pain,
correct deformity, and protect against
deforming forces. A basic problem
has been that they immobilize the
hand and thus prevent it from earn-
ing out useful activity. U-M research-
ers have developed a simple dynamic
splint for use by rheumatoid patient?.
It is worn during normal daily activity
and serves to limit deviation without
seriously affecting hand function. It
does little, however, to prevent de-
formity. On the basis of favorable
experience to date the splint will be
used and evaluated by other centers.
Also, a number of engineering
studies, oriented largely toward an
orthetic system for the paralyzed upper
extremity, were made. One study, for
example, dealt with various control
methods of a powered arm brace. How
can the patient control the brace
easily and at will is a critical factor
which must take into account such
things as gravity, friction of the brace
joint, the weight of the limb and load
to be transported, and so on. The U-M
scientists have been experimenting
with different types of control switches
in an effort to design an efficient switch
that can be built cheaply and used
easily.
Finally, the U-M Project's evalua-
tion group has been conducting local,
preliminary evaluations of various
U-M designs for further refinement
before being subjected to a complete
evaluation on a wider basis. Thus,
from many directions, the U-M scien-
tists are helping to build a solid
foundation needed to design, con-
struct, prescribe, and use orthetic de-
vices more effectively.

made pilots old hat?
Sure, the boys who
go off the "pads" get the big, bold head-
lines. But if you want to fly, the big op-
portunities are still with the aircraft that
take off and land on several thousand
feet of runway.
Who needs pilots? TAC does. And
MAC. And SAC.
There's a real future in Air Force fly-
ing. In years to come aircraft may fly
higher, faster, and farther than we dare
dream today. But they'll be flying, with
men who've had Air Force flight training
at the controls.
Of course the Air Force also has
plenty of jobs for those who won't be
flying. As one of the world's largest and
most advanced research and develop-
ment organizations, we have a continu-
ing need for scientists and engineers, as
well as administrators.
Young college graduates (both men
and women) in these fields will find that
they'll have the opportunity to do work
that is both interesting and important.
The fact is, nowhere will you have greater
latitude or responsibility right
horn the start than on the
is at the office of the Professor of Aero-
space Studies, if there is an Air Force
ROTC unit on your campus. If not, con-
tact the nearest Air Force recruiter for

portunities. Or mail the coupon below.

The box below permits a chemical engineer, just for kicks, to test himself for
possible interest in our kind of problems. Bright M.E.s, E.E.s, and other engi-
neers will pick up enough of the general idea to transpose the test to their own
fields of competence. The next step would be to drop us a line about yourself

of compensation should come up, we feel that now and far into the foreseeable
future we can afford the best.

We can react diketene and tert.-butyl alcohol to tert.-butyl
acetoacetate [CH3COCH2COOC(CH.,)3] by methods
that bring the price down to $3.50 a pound—about one-
sixth the prevailing research-quantity price—with the usual
prospect for a substantial further plunge as volume de-
velops. A plunge to reach the price level of methyl aceto-
acetate and ethyl acetoacetate, two currently large-vol-
ume acetoacetic esters of ours, is unlikely. The tert.-butyl
ester, however, has an advantage over the other two. When
alkylated to CH:jCOCHRCOOC(CH3),,, mere heating
with a trace of acid catalyst drives off first (CH3)2C = CH2
and then C02, leaving CH:jCOCH2R. With the cheaper
acetoacetate esters for making ketones, there is no such
neat cleavage. There the ethyl or methyl group has to be
hydrolyzed off, and if R happens to be hydrolysis-sensitive
itself, poof goes the yield. This same readiness of a-alkyl-
ated tert.-butyl acetoacetic esters to split out isobutylene
and then decarboxylate opens up promising routes also to
carboxylic acids, pyrroles, pyrazalones, uracils, and cou-
marins.
Now assume we have large supplies of diketene and tert.-butyl alcohol, as indeed we do.
The problem: multiply their combined economic value to many times the sum of their separate values.

A PREVIEW OF YOUR CAREER AT GENERAL ELECTRIC
Achieving Thrust for Mach 3
When the North American Aviation XB-70 established a mile-
stone by achieving Mach 3 flight, it was powered by six
General Electric J93 jet engines. That flight was the high
point of two decades of G-E leadership in jet power that
began when America's first jet plane was flown in 1942. In
addition to the 30,000-pound thrust J93's, the XB-70 carries a
unique, 240-kva electrical system that supplies all on-board
power needs—designed by G-E engineers. The challenge of
advanced flight propulsion promises even more opportunity
at G.E. GETF39 engines will help the new USAF C-5A fly more
payload than any other aircraft in the world; the Mach 3
GE4/J5 is designed to deliver 50,000-pound thrust for a U.S.
Supersonic Transport (SST). General Electric's involvement
in jet power since the beginning of propellerless flight has
made us one of the world's leading suppliers of these prime
movers. This is typical of the fast-paced technical challenge
you'll find in any of G.E.'s 120 decentralized product opera-
tions. To define your career interest at General Electric,

With all
the companies
making the same promises,
how do you tell
the difference?
It is difficult! Perhaps the best and only way is to study the com-
pany carefully—to see if its structure, range and operational
modes permit it to make good its promises. If you scrutinize
Sylvania Electronic Systems, you'll discover a number of sal-
ient facts that may help clarify the matter for you.
Note first that Sylvania employs the small group form of or-
ganization—within its nationwide complex of research and de-
velopment groups, manufacturing plants and world-wide field
engineering operation. This makes swift individual progress
and development possible within a wide choice of current in-
house projects.
Note particularly the diversity and breadth of SES projects.
You may advance in a technical or administrative capacity in
any of these areas: ground electronics equipment for Minute-
man missile sites... research and development in electronic
warfare field...electronic security systems...
ASW systems...special purpose airborne com-
puters for incorporation into U.S. Air Force large
scale electronic systems...laser systems...de-
sign of spaceborne electronic and optical systems...plus
world-wide engineering support systems.
Note that SES has worked out three distinct routes for ad-
vancement, all with equal rewards—technical specialist, tech-
nical manager, program/project manager.
Finally, note how SES encourages ambitious individuals to
accelerate their development through participation in Division-
wide conferences, in-plant courses and seminars and post-
graduate study plans conducted on an unusually generous
scale.
The success of the SES mission—to manage government'
systems programs for General Telephone &amp; Electronics, the
parent corporation—depends on the professional and intellec-
tual growth of its personnel. In every respect, SES has created
an environment to foster that growth. Be sure that any prospec-
tive employer you consider has established a
growth climate of like specifications.
Making promises is one thing. Making progress
is another.

ANONYMITY AND THE DRAFT
The present operation of the military draft is subject
to much criticism. The call-up has become so great that
the 2-S status of college students is being reviewed, and
quite soon draft boards will be plucking students out of
college to fulfill their quotas.
The boards have the potential draftees over a barrel.
A loud protest by a group is likely to bring the
individual's names into the spotlight and no matter
how impartial the selection is supposed to be, these
protesters' names are still fresh in the minds of the
board. It is a sad situation, indeed, when a citizen of
the United States must pause to determine the
consequences of a perfectly legitimate complaint voiced
under the freedom of speech that we in this countrv
are supposedly guaranteed. It appears that apathetic
citizens have a better chance of avoiding the draft than
do those who are genuinely interested in the situation
and are willing to voice their opinions.
But it is not so much the avoidance of the draft that
is at issue, but the injustice of punishing the dissenters.
This situation affects not only those eligible for the
draft, but those closely related to potential draftees
Recently the father of a college boy was heard to remark
that he wanted to write to his congressman and to the
national selective service office to complain about the
draft. He did not because he feared such a letter might
cause his son to be reclassified.
This may seem unbelievable; this type of thing just
does not happen in the United States, or does it?
Choking off dissent is not healthy for a democracy
such as ours. Dissent is a means of constant revision
and improvement necessary to any organization.
The students themselves express this fear of the
system. One student expressed the views of many when
he said, "I'm not even going to take the selective service
exam. It would just put my name in front of my board
and I don't want that." The general feeling is don't
make yourself known to your draft board. Of course,
there is always the problem of carrying enough credit
hours to make sure the board does not notice your
6


no longer enough to satisfy the board even if a fourteen
hour semester is preceeded or followed by a sixteen hour
one to give a total of thirty hours for the year as
required to remain in good standing. As soon as the
number fourteen shows up after your name, eyes light
up, questions begin to flow, and chances of being
reclassified soar.
But what if you are a high ranking officer in an
extracurricular campus activity? One student was told
by an appeals agent that activities provided no basis
for retention of a 2-S classification if the hours
requirement were not met (that is if less than fifteen
hours were taken in a semester). This seems to be
hurting the student who spends an appreciable amount
of time on an activity. In spite of the time he spends
on his activity, he is also expected to carry as many
credits as a fellow student who merely attends ( lasses
and goes home to study. Admittedly all those active in
extracurricular activities are not equally affected by
this, because the time spent on an activity is not great
until one reaches the top one or two positions within
an organization. By giving no consideration to
participation in campus organizations, the draft is
jeopardizing the success of many ac tivities because
people are unwilling to sacrifice their grades in order
to carry enough credits to keep their boards happy and
at the same time participate in an extracurricular
activity.
The present method of drafting tends to stifle all
opposition to it by creating much fear and anxiety on
the part of those directly affected. There is no means of
open criticism of the present system without leaving
oneself at its mercy.
This editorial is an example of the type of criticizing
that is likely to bring the author's name into the
spotlight at his local draft board. Once there the
board would begin looking for the slightest excuse to
"legitimately" reclassify him. To avoid this possibility
the author prefers to remain anonymous.

Alloys For High Temperatures
For many months the National
Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion and the Federal Aviation Agency
have been participating in the devel-
opment of a civilian supersonic jet
transport, called the SST. The first
model is expected to cruise at a speed
of Mach 2.2 (about 1,450 mph), but
is being designed so that with only
minor modification it should be able
to cruise at Mach 3 (about 2,000
mph) or faster. The project gives
rise to many problems never before
met: only military airplanes have
reached this speed, and many of their
requirements are quite different from
those of a safe and economically feas-
ible civilian passenger plane. One
group of problems concerns the ma-
terials for use in those parts of the
aircraft that will be subjected to the
highest temperatures — the areas
around the engines. Investigating ma-
terials which may be used in these
parts is one of the tasks of the High
Temperature Metallurgical Research
Group of the University's Depart-
ment of Chemical and Metallurgical
Engineering. The group is headed by
Professor James W. Freeman; this
particular project is conducted by Dr.
Thomas M. Cullen, Associate Re-
search Engineer, assisted by P. Doug-
las Goodell and David Wilson, grad-
uate students in metallurgical engi-
neering.
The speed at which the SST is to
fly will cause the metal skin covering
its surface to reach extremely high
maximum temperatures, as the above
sketch shows. (The sketch is intended
only to give a general idea; it is not
to be taken as representing any of the
designs being considered.) When
metals are subjected to stress at high
temperatures, they gradually stretch
and eventually fail; this effect is
known as creep. Alumninum-base al-
loys, which have long been used for
the skin of subsonic jet planes be-
cause of their lightness and strength,
begin to be subject to creep at a little
above room temperature. Hence more
heat-resistant materials must be used
for the SST. The wings and fuselage,
which are expected to reach maxi-
mum temperatures around 600° F,
will probably be made of titanium or
high-strength stainless steels, and
those parts subject to higher temper
alures will be made of superalloys.
Superalloy is the term applied bv
metallurgists to alloys, usually nickel
or cobalt-base, which are developed
lo be resistant to very high tempera-
tures, relatively high stresses (tensile,
thermal, vibratory, or shock), oxida-
tion, and embrittlement. They arc
much less subject to creep than alu-
minum alloys, but their use brings
new and very difficult problems in
designing and fabrication, as well as
in predicting their response to sen-
ice.
The background of the High
Temperature Metallurgical Research
Group made it well suited for investi-
gating the alloys capable of withstand-
ing extremely high temperatures.
Since the 1920's, when it was organized
by Professor A. E. White, the group
has studied the properties of metals at
very high temperatures. Under the
sponsorship of the National Advisor)
Committee for Aeronautics, predeces-
sor of NASA, it was one participant
in a national research program thai

search Group. At the left in the large photograph are temperature controllers and timers for the units. The
temperature of each furnace is controlled to within • 3 F The lower end of the specimen is attached to a
beam, and the specimen is subjected to stress by a lever arm arrangement. Pins at each end of the specimen
hold pairs of extensometer rods—one rod on each side attached to the upper end and one on each side
attached to the lower end—which extend out through the bottom of the furnace. Slender rods on which small
mirrors are mounted are clamped between the extensometer rods on either side of the specimen. As the
stress on the specimen deforms it—i.e., stretches it—the extensometer rods attached to the lower end of
the specimen move slightly downward, so that the mirrors revolve slightly in opposite directions. The re-
searcher then adjusts a telescope so that he can take readings, reflected in each mirror, of a nearby illumi-
nated graduated scale. These readings show how much the specimen has crept; the system is sensitive to
changes as small as 0.000005 inch per inch.
Figure 1
developed a whole new family of al-
loys for use at temperatures up to
1.500 or 1,600°F and made possible
the development of the gas turbine
engine used in jet aircraft. For some
years since then, working on projects
sponsored by both industry and gov-
ernment, the group has conducted
extensive studies of factors affecting
the strength of the alloys used in jet
engines. The experience gained from
such research was readily applicable
to the testing of skin material for
the SST.
The specific problem the Research
Group undertook to solve was as fol-
lows. First, was it feasible to use a
nickel-base superalloy, in sheets 0.025
to 0.030 inch thick, for the engine
areas of the SST? Second, if a super-
alloy were found suitable, could skin
made from it be expected to last the
life of the aircraft, at the expected
high temperatures and at a design
stress of from 40,000 to 70,000 pounds
per square inch (psi)?
Eight superalloys were studied. All
of them had been in use for some
years. The lag between the develop-
ment of a new alloy and its coming
into widespread use may be as long
as ten years, and the SST program
allows for no such delay; even the
specialized study of known alloys
needed for this program will take
about four years.
The superalloys studied had long
been used at temperatures above
1,200°F, but very little knowledge of
their behavior at low-er temperatures,
or their behavior in sheet form, had
been gathered. Since the SST will be
subjected to widely varying tempera-
tures, much more study was needed.
Accordingly, the first phase of the
investigation was a screening pro-
gram in which the load-carrying abil-
ity of sheets of the different super-
alloys at temperatures from —110° to
1,000°F was measured. Three were
found to have superior properties.
The Research Group then began
studies to determine whether the
properties of any of these materials
made it especially suitable for use in
the SST, and, if so, what its upper
temperature of usefulness would be.
Three criteria were set up: the
stress which would cause rupture in
the service life of the SST must be
greater than the expected design
stress; the skin must undergo no
more than 0.1% creep during the
service life of the SST; and the alloy
must be resistant to catastrophic
crack propagation, so that "fail-sale"

Basic to research on any alloy is
study of its microstructure, which has
a direct effect on its mechanical prop-
erties. Microstructure can be affected
by chemical composition, processing
conditions, and heat treatment; mi-
crostructural examination, if it is
properly done and the results are
correctly interpreted, can provide the
information necessary to avoid failure
in service. The studies are conducted
by use of optical and electron micro-
graphs; an electron micrograph is
shown, right. A sample of an alloy
is polished to a mirror surface and
then etched, usually with dilute acitls,
to bring out the grain structure. The
sample is then coated with a thin
layer of transparent plastic. This lay-
er, when cool, is stripped off, and the
resulting reverse relief of the surface
of the sample is photographed with
an electron microscope.
The electron micrograph shows the
matrix (a solid solution seen here as
the background and made up pri-
marily of nickel and chromium) and
various particles present in the alloy.
The particles are made up of nickel,
aluminum, titanium (Ni,(Al, Ti)), and
some complex carbide. The matrix
and the particles are known as phases
(phase is defined as "a physically ho-
mogeneous and distinct portion of a
material system"). Ideally, the metal-
lurgist could predict mechanical prop-
erties from knowledge of the chem-
istry and the structural phases; but
in practice such predictions are not
yet reliable, particularly for interme-
diate temperatures and for the long
service life of the SST.

fication characteristics, which may l&gt;e
affected by such variables as mold
design. Further, residual elements
may be present in the melting addi-
tions or may be picked up from the
crucible or the atmosphere timing
the melting operation. If these differ-

tected in the microstructure; and the
presence of some elements in a pro-
portion of only a few parts per mil-
lion can have a pronounced effect on
the mechanical properties of the allo\.
The microstructure of the nickel-
base alloys under study consists of a
solid solution matrix phase y inter-
spersed with a hardening phase y'
which can be either spherical or cubic.
The amount, size, and interparticle
spacing of the y phase (Ni.(Al, Tin
largely determines the alloy's beha-
vior at high temperatures; in general,
a superalloy's strength at high tem-
perature increases as the proportion
of the Ni,(Al, Ti) phase increases am!
as particle size and interparticle spac-
ing decrease.
The extent of segregation can be
diminished by hot working and by
hcai treatment. In the former ojjera-
tion an alloy is heated to a tempera-
ture at which it is relatively easy to
work and then put into usable form:
one effect of the process is that the
alloy becomes more homogeneous. In
heal treatment the alloy is held at a
certain temperature for a specified
length of time and then carefully
cooled by some controlled method,
such as slow, gradual cooling in a fur-
nace or rapid quenching in water.
This treatment serves to optimize the
mechanical properties of the alloy for

Each year it is the Technics privi-
lege to present a synopsis of the "An-
nual Report of Engineering Place-
ment" which is organized by Profes-
sor John G. Young. This report, avail-
able from room 128-H, shows current
opportunities and trends in engineer-
ing placement over the past year,
July 1964-July 1965.
The Engineering College maintains
an extensive placement service to en-
sure that its students and alumni may
take full advantage of the many and
diversified opportunities available to
engineers. Under Professor Young's
direction, the Engineering Placement
Service schedules about 725 visits
from firms in every corner of the na-
tion and of the globe. Each year, in
addition to expediting position in-
terviews, the Placement Service proc-
esses mounds of job-related informa-
tion to enable students to keep
abreast of engineering opportunities
and trends. The Report is one result
of these many services.
General Notes
Just as has been true in the past,
opportunities for engineers are at new
highs. The overall demand for Michi-
gan graduates was at least as strong
or stronger than last year. This is evi-
denced by increases in both recruit-
ing activity and volume offers. Start-
ing salaries also increased by about
the same amount as last year, accord-
ROOM 128-H
ing to the national College Place-
ment Council Survey. However, the
overall increase reported by our own
graduates was unexplainably some-
what less. The chemical and drug in-
dustry was distinguished by offering
the highest average salaries this year
at the B.S. level, while Chemical En-
gineering B.S. graduates received the
highest salaries of all the major pro-
grams. Aerospace and Electronics,
however, continued to pay the high-
est premium for M.S. degrees; but
again, their demand volume contin-
ued to decline except for a very few
employers.
Once again, the trend for a larger
proportion of our graduates to start
in the East rather than in the West
continued this year and was accom-
panied by a substantial increase in
the proportion staying in Michigan
and the Midwest. The proportion of
graduates starting in Michigan in-
creased by 4% this year, and other
Midwest areas increased by 3% with
appropriate reductions in the num-
bers going to the East and West.
Interviewers and Offers
Student activity in interviewing
and plant visits also increased this
year in spite of the advent of the
tri-term calendar. A decline in the
proportion going to military service
resulted in a somewhat larger num-
ber of graduates being available for
employment. The coming year's re-
port should provide some very inter-
esting details about the military-
graduate relationship. Although the
volume of interviewing for regular
employment continued to increase
substantially, there was a continued
decrease in the volume of interview-
ing for summer employment. This is
believed to be the result of more pre-
selection and fewer group meetings
by summer employers rather than a
decrease in student interest or the
number of openings. Again, in spite
of the compressed calendar, the num-
ber of interviews per student also
increased significantly. There was also
no decline in the number of plant
visits accepted. (See Table I.) There
was a notable increase in the volume
of interviewing by Ph.D. candidates,
but a slight decrease in the average
number of interviews per candidate
was also apparent. As previously men-
tioned, last year's increase in the pro-
portion of graduates going to military
service was reversed with a drop from
17% to 10%. There was a corres-
ponding gain in the proportion, ac-
cepting regular employment. The
proportion continuing in school re-
mained approximately the same.
Looking on to next year, there i&gt;
already an increase of nearly 10%
in advanced bookings for interview
visits compared to a 10% decrea«*

there was a continued decrease of
almost 6% in the number of em-
ployers on campus. While the number
of visits scheduled was the same as
last year, the decrease in cancellations
resulted in a net increase in com-
pleted visits of 3.5%. It is believed
that this reflects increasing consolida-
tion of representation by the multi-
division employers as well as an in-
creasing intensity of recruiting effort.
The proportion of visits from the
Aerospace industry continued its de-
cline by another 2%. Petroleum and

made fewer visits with corresponding
increases in Automotive and Utilities
companies.

gained by 7% and 5% respectively.
Electronics, State and Local Govern-
ment, and Education also lost ground
compared to last year, but Glass, etc.,
increased its proportion from 1% to
4%. How much of a trend there is
remains to be seen in the future
months.
The proportion of large employers
lost 2% of the 4% increase that was
reported last year, so evidently, no
trend has yet been established.
Also, last year's decrease in the
number of graduates starting in
Training Programs was reversed with
an even larger increase, but only at
the expense of Research and Devel-
opment, Design or Systems, and
Teaching. Overall, the average num-
ber of offers reported by students
accepting regular employment de-
clined somewhat, mostly at the M.S.
level. There is no evident explana-
tion for this since the volume of
otters reported by employers more
than doubled. For more details see

Salaries
The increase in starting salaries
this year was substantially less than
last year to all degree levels: 2.6%

The Company's first engine, the Wasp, took
to the air on May 5,1926. Within a year the
Wasp set its first world record and went on
to smash existing records and set standards
for both land and seaplanes for years to
come, carrying airframes and pilots higher,
farther, and faster than they had ever gone

In recent years, planes powered by
&amp; Whitney Aircraft have gone on to set
new standards of performance in much the
same way as the Wasp had done in the
1920's. The 727 and DC-9 are indicative of
the new family of short-to-medium range
jetliners which are powered by the highly
successful JT8D turbofan. Examples of
current military utilizations are the J58-
powered Mach 3 YF-12A which recently
established four world aviation records and
the advanced TF30-powered F-lll \
geometry fighter aircraft.

diversity
Larry Moore
B.M.E., Univ. of Kansas
The college graduate's initial exposure to the
world of business is often less than exhilarating.
The reason? A great many companies require the
recent graduate to serve a long-term apprentice-
ship in a role that offers little or no opportunity
to demonstrate personal capabilities. That is not
the way at Ford Motor Company. Our College
Graduate Program brings you into contact with
many phases of business, encourages self-expression
and helps you—and us—determine where your
greatest potential lies. An important benefit of the
Program is getting to know and work with some
of the most capable people in industry. One of many young men who
believes he has gained tremendously from this exposure and experience is
Larry Moore, a Product Design engineer.
After receiving his B.M.E. in February, 1964, Larry joined our College
Graduate Program and began work in brake design. Stimulating assign-
ments followed in product evaluation and disc brake development. Later,
he learned production techniques while supervising one phase of the
Mustang assembly line operations. An assignment in our Truck Sales
Promotion and Training Department added still another dimension to his
experience. The "big picture" of product development was brought into
focus for Larry when he became associated with Thunderbird Product
Planning. From there he moved to the Special Vehicles Section . . . into
the exciting world of high-performance cars!
Currently, Larry Moore is on leave of absence, studying to acquire his
M.B.A. degree at Michigan State. He feels—and rightly so—that we're
100 percent behind his desire to improve his educational background.
Young men with talent, initiative and ambition can go far with Ford
Motor Company. Think about it—and talk to our representative when
he next visits your campus.

An exciting growth curve can
be a tantalizing inducement
What's behind the curve is even more important.
The first thing that you will find is that it's made up of
more than a single line... more than a product line of the
world-famous office copiers that continue to provide so
much growth impetus.
But the closer you look, the more you'll see of the story
behind our growth, and the opening chapters of the new
growth stories ahead for Xerox and its people.
Now you're getting to the real reasons why we're look-
ing for more new graduates than ever in the history of
Xerox —more than 400 from the classes of '66 alone.
In the near term, we forecast an ever lengthening list
of products and systems for offices, schools and govern-
ments, on a global scale. Not exclusively new copying ma-
chines, but also document management systems which
reduce, consolidate and distribute information, making it
more readily accessible to the man who needs it. As fast
as he needs it. These are in our R&amp;D pipelines today.
In the longer view, the answers will come from our
deepening studies of graphic communications which em-
brace the entire spectrum of communications in a graphic
sense: the formulation, reception, transmission, recording,
storing, retrieving, processing, copying and presentation of
any meaningful images.
It all adds up to growth. But it's horizontal as well as
vertical. More interdisciplinary than most people realize.
We think it's the kind of growth that makes opportuni-
ties like these take on real meaning for the new grad:
FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED RESEARCH (PhD, MS or
BS in the fields of Physics, Chemistry, Optics and Photo-
graphic, and Engineering Sciences.) Emphasis here is on
experimentation and imaginative problem solving.
ENGINEERING (BS, MS in ME, EE, ChE. Also, openings
for majors in optics, photographic sciences, mathematics,
physics and engineering physics.) Emphasis here is on
creativity and imaginative problem solving.

JOB REQUIREMENTS
RAFF ASSOCIATES currently has
openings for young Ph.D. physicists
and electrical engineers, well versed in
the fundamentals of their discipline,
whose interests are broad. They will
work in the fields of sonar ASW and

If interested write to Dr. Samuel J.
Raff, president of Raff Associates.
"DO NOT DISTURB
MY CIRCLES."*
In studying the growth and attrition of companies or
countries and the success and failure of endeavors of many
kinds, significant causes can often be found in key executive
decisions.
As the world's technology advances, these vital decisions
tend more and more to require engineering and scientific
inputs and careful, objective study.
The decision maker for management normally does not
have the time nor the background for such a study. If he
relies on the recommendations of his own staff, often their
self-interest will unconsciously (or consciously) influence
recommendations. Similarly, the advice of outside consultants
may be conditioned by the equipment and services they sell,
or hope to sell.
Therefore, there is a clear and increasing need for the
services of organizations which can objectively study the
scientific and engineering aspects of a problem, analyze them,
and distill a clear and definitive recommendation.
This is the role of Raff Analytic Study Associates. It is
a sphere of growing importance. A scientist or engineer in
this particular area of work will have more impact on his
society and on his country's welfare than in any other type of
endeavor.
The importance of the work will be reflected in many forms
of satisfaction to the successful scientist or engineer in this
field.

OF A
SUCCESSFUL CAREER
BY WILLIAM H. WISELY.
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY. AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS
Over-simplified though it may be,
the graphical representation of a suc-
cessful career that is shown here will
illustrate certain elements that are
common to the pattern of success in
any walk of life. Like fingerprints, the
shape of the curve will never be the
same for any two individuals, but the
three phases of development and the
forces and factors that influence the
slopes, breakpoints, maxima and
ranges of the curve are common to all.
Phase I of the curve obviously rep-
resents the training and internship
period, which in large measure de-
termines the course of progress that is
to follow. This includes the academic
preparation, which documents the be-
ginning of the professional biography
that is to ensue. It also includes the
early years of practice, in which habits
are formed, abilities are tested and
proved, shortcomings evaluated, and
initial recognition acquired.
The significant breakpoint that
marks the onset of Phase II represents
that point in time at which the matur-
ing talents of the neophyte begin to be
recognized. Now new and greater re-
sponsibility is entrusted to him, and
the acceleration and ultimate height
of his progress are defined by the man-
ner in which these responsibilities are
met. Here the "men are separated
from the boys," and the quality of
the preparation made in Phase I is
measured by results.
Phase III portrays that happy sea-
son which follows achievement of sub-
stantial advancement, where the chal-
lenge is greatest and the competition
keenest. The rate of progress slows,
but nevertheless continues into, and
often through, the "retirement" years.
This, too, is the season of greatest re-
ward, both economically and in per-
sonal satisfaction, for by now there are
tangible accomplishments that bring
personal recognition and a sense of
pride.
The color scheme used in the chart
is also significant, with those early
drab years of study, discipline, and
mundane toil eventually giving way
to the fair weather days of rapid ad-
vancement and ever-brightening fu-
ture. Phase III represents the hue
seen through the rose-colored glasses
with which one might view his goals
and ambitions. Ironically, to the vet-
eran looking back, those early days
of youthful struggle may usually seem
to have been the rosiest of all!
To my mind the "profile of success"
as charted can apply to any vocation
or profession, with the same control-
ling factors and influences. We are
concerned here, however, with a pro-
fession, and it is apropos that a fun-
damental definition be given at this
point.
Roscoe Pound, former Dean of the
Harvard Law School, admirably de-
fines a profession as the pursuit of
a learned art in a spirit of service.
Note the two essential elements — the
"learned art" and the "spirit of serv-
ice." Both are indispensable, and they
must be manifest for the entire dura-
tion of a truly professional career.
My first intent in the development
of these remarks was to discuss the im-
portance of personal attitude to all
three phases of the successful engineer-
ing career. Upon checking with the
young men in the ASCE start, how-
ever, I was informed in no uncertain
terms that the young engineer is con-
cerned with his status NOW, and not
with generalities of his future. In
deference to this advice, my discussion
will be confined to Phase I—the in-
ternship stage—although there may
be an occasional suggestion that our
aspiring young candidate for fame and
glory should think and glance ahead
once in a while!
Getting right down to basics, there
are two raw materials that must be
developed in the individual to pre
pare him for a useful and rewarding
life. They are, first. Inherent Abilit\
and, second, Attitude. Except to point
out that the gifts and talents with
which one is naturally bestowed can
only be developed in the climate of a
proper mental attitude, I shall not
allude further to the personal abilities
and capacities of the individual. Om
primary concern here is the attitude
of the individual — and specifically
— the attitude that will best further
"the pursuit of a learned art in a spirit
of service."
Elements of the Professional Attitude
Were it possible to apply the tech-
niques of the chemist to the formula-
tion of the professional attitude it is
suggested that the four essential ele-
ments would be (1) Motivation, (2)
Discipline, (3) Participation and (-}'•
Enthusiasm. All of these, in their
proper proportion and relationship to
each other, impart vital properties to
the finished compound.
Motivation
Definition of objectives is certainly
the first step in planning any project.
The "Progress" that is plotted as the
ordinate of the career chart is a com-
posite of:
a) The financial return that makes
possible the comfort and security
of our families, and even a bit ol
luxury if things go well,
b) The persona] satisfaction that
comes with the knowledge that one

world about him — that his life i&gt;
26
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


low man, and
c) The recognition by one's asso-
ciates and others that he is a com-
petent artisan — that his works are
well-founded and well-made.
The secular rewards of financial
status and prestige require no eluci-
dation, for they are obviously direct
measures of successful progress. As the
years pass, however, the sense of con-
tribution to a better world will be all
the more cherished. The emphasis
moves to the "spirit of service" that is
one of the two requirements in Dean
Pound's definition of a profession.
The service motive, then, is a prime
requisite to the professional attitude.
It must be accepted and given a high
order of value in the early years of
the career, in order to inspire the
dedication of purpose that is always
manifest in those who have achieved
real and true success in their chosen
fields.
Discipline
It takes initiative and self-control
for one to evaluate his weaknesses and
shortcomings, and it also takes deter-
mination to do something about their
correction. No matter how extensive
his academic training, a young engi-
neer soon finds that there are great
gaps in his fund of knowledge. He
learns quickly that technology is not
static, and that new developments will
pass him by if he does not keep apace
through self-education.
The discipline to apply one's time
and energy to maintain his learned
art and to pursue it with diligence and
determination must be developed
early in the successful career. Once the
discipline is acquired, effective study
habits will become superior working
habits, and the ability to apportion
one's available time properly between
work and recreation becomes almost
automatic.
Participation
More than knowledge alone, of
course, is needed to build a career. In
any profession it is necessary to be
able to approach and meet associates
and the public, to communicate with
them, to work harmoniously with
them, and even to manage them under
the proper circumstances. It is impor-
tant, then, to begin early to establish
one's identity in his profession, and to
contribute to it where possible.
Through such contributions one will
make valuable contacts, make known
his abilities, and apprise those who
might use his services of his willing-
ness and capacity to handle greater
responsibility.
For the aspiring young civil engi-
neer the facilities of ASCE are invalu-
able as a framework for participation
in his profession. He can begin in the
student chapter to make himself
known, and to give of himself for the
benefit of the group. After leaving
school he can make himself available
for activity in the Younger Member

PROFILE OF A SUCCESSFUL CAREER
Forum or in the Local Section, as a
prelude to service at higher levels as
he becomes known. Not only does he
keep up with advancing technology
through the technical conferences and
publications of the Society, but also
does he contribute of his own knowl-
edge and experience to the progress
of the art through committee activity
and by preparing papers for presen-
tation and publication.
Participation in community func-
tions and public affairs is also a facet
of professional life, in which most
opportunities come after the career is
well launched. There should be a
readiness to accept these opportunities
to serve, however, whenever they may
come, and humble though thev may
be.
It should be noted that the kind of
participation encouraged here is predi-
cated more on contributing than on
receiving. Here again the service mo-
tive finds effect in the attainment of
the professional identification, con-
tacts and reputation that guide the
way to success.
It is a coincidence that the mem-
bership grades of ASCE are compati-
ble with the three stages of career de-
velopment in the chart. Associate
membership covers the preparation or
proving period which leads to the
grade of Member when full profes-
sional status is achieved. The recogni-
tion grade of Fellow is earned by-
superior performance and noteworthy
professional accomplishment as a suc-
cessful practitioner.
Fnth usiasm
Some complex chemical reactions
require a catalyst, which is a substance
that furthers the reaction without it-
self being consumed. The catalyst in
the formulation of professional atti-
tude is ENTHUSIASM - that magic
quality without which nothing really
worth while can be achieved. Roger
Adams, a famous scientist has this to
say about the importance of enthus-
iasm for one's job:
"There is nothing more important
to a man than to select for his life's
work some line with which he is
entirely happy, because then, re-
gardless of his ability and final at-
tainments, he is likely to advance
further than otherwise. Content-
ment with one's vocational activities
is a foundation that enables a man
to build upon it a superstructure
that may tower above original ex-
pectations. Enjoyment in daily work

and ninety per cent of a man's com-
pensation. This is the most import-
ant factor in the future happiness
and success of an individual."
If I had the power to bestow just
one gift upon every graduating civil
engineering student, it would be their
inculcation with a generous, whole-
some enthusiasm for his chosen career.
And to the young practitioner who is
not driven to his best effort by a con-
tinuing flow of enthusiasm I would
urge that he change his calling with-
out delay.
There are many slogans and cliches
about this miraculous stimulator of
human production. Just in case some
of you may feel that this dissertation
is somewhat too philosophical, how-
ever, I will cite only the claim that
"Enthusiasm is the yeast that raises
the dough" to make my point here.
Professional Attitude Defined
Professional attitude, then, might
be defined as a combination of per-
sonal motivation, discipline and par-
ticipation, activated by an enthusiastic
desire to render constructive service.
It is the powerful force that brings
about the greatest possible utilization
of the natural talent anil ability that
is available in the individual. It con-
stitutes the difference between the en-
gineer and the truly "professional"
engineer.
Some Specific Phase I Situations
One of my young consultants in the
ASCE staff opined that the students
would want to know "What should
they do next?" In an effort to comply
with this difficult charge I have se-
lected several typical situations that
might be encountered in the Phase
I internship period.
Selecting the First Job
To the graduating student the pros-
pect of a steady income becomes very
attractive. The size of that pay check
is important, to be sure, but it is by
no means all-important. Moreover,
there are some factors other than
geographical location and fringe bene-
fits that merit careful evaluation in
the selection of that first job. Among
these are:
1. Reputation and standing of the
potential employer.
2. Character and scope of experi-
ence that can be anticipated.
3. Range of responsibility and op-
portunity for advancement.
4. Professional reputation and
standing of one's working associates
and superiors.
5. Availability of facilities for grad-
uate education, special courses, etc.
A job that will yield broad experi-
ence in the area of specialty interest,
with training under men of recognized
competence and stature, with oppor-
tunity to assume continually greater
responsibility, and with convenient
outside educational facilities could
well provide a better foundation for
a career than another offering a higher
salary in a vacation climate.
It is relevant here to refer back to
Dr. Adams' observation that one will
do best and go farthest in work that
he thoroughly enjoys. There should
be no hesitancy to change jobs, within
reason, if there is real advancement
as measured by criteria other than
salary and fringe benefits. And above
all, the job that generates genuine
pride and enthusiasm should be prized
as a treasure.
Professional Identification
Mention has already been made of
the importance of ASCE membership
as a means of professional identifica-
tion and as a vehicle for participation
in technical and professional activities.
The civil engineers most likely to
succeed will be found among the 52,-
000 members of the Society.
Early in the career a decision will
also have to be made as to legal regis-
tration under the state laws. Regis-
tration is not mandotory for certain
kinds of practice, and it usually re-
quires passage of a written examina-
tion together with several years of ap-
proved experience.
It is significant that four of every
six members of ASCE are voluntarily
registered, and another one of every
six is an Engineer-in-Training. Every
embryonic civil engineer today should
act to become registered at the very
earliest time, both for the professional
identification that results and to sat-
isfy this requirement whenever is may
arise in a future assignment or engage-
ment. The registration examinations
are easiest when they are taken soon
after graduation. Do not procrastinate
in this important step!
To Moonlight or Not to Moonlight
More than once during his Phase I
internship the young engineer will be
offered the opportunity to pick up
some extra income by work outside of
his regular job. Such "moonlighting"
is not ethically improper if it is done
with the knowledge and consent of
the primary employer, and if there i~
no conflict of interest. It may even in
some cases be highly educational am',
broadening in the technical experi-
ence gained.
In general, however, the tempta-
tion to earn additional income through
outside employment should be care-
fully weighed. Would this same time
be more beneficially used for the Ion:;
haul if it were devoted to formal ed-
ucation toward a graduate degree? Or
toward the establishment of profes-
sional identification and stature b\
contributing to technical committees,
meetings and publications? Or toward
broadening one's acquaintanceship
and personal contacts through pro-
fessional activity?
The moonlighting job might slight-
ly enhance the rate of progress in
Phase I of the career chart, but at the
risk of jeopardizing the full potential
that might be realized in the later
stages of the career.
This decision is an important one.
The Call of the Union
The trade unions today are striving
mightily to recover the losses from
their ranks as a result of automation.
They are directing powerful efforb
toward the exploitation of union
membership among technical em-
ployees in the white collar group, in-
cluding all branches of engineering.
We have no quarrel with trade
unions for the manual crafts and skills,
but their objectives, policies and meth-

Attention to detail is an old
Bell System habit. Or maybe you call
it thoroughness. Or follow-through.
Anyway, we attended to an interesting
detail recently-the effect of rain
on the microwave link between a
communications satellite and our
pioneer ground station antenna
at Andover, Maine.
If we could but measure the rain's
effect, we could improve the design
of satellite ground stations.
The question was how.
Well, you often have to take your
laboratory tools where you find them,
and in this case we found ours in
Cassiopeia A, a strong and stable
radio star that is always visible from
Andover. We measured the noise
power from Cassiopeia A during dry
periods, and then measured the
reduction during rainy periods. The
result could be expressed as a
formula and employed accurately in
designing future ground stations.
The initial success of our Telstar®
satellites proved the feasibility
of communicating via space.
But it also opened the door—or the
heavens-to a whole new technology
which we are now busily
exploring in every detail.
In space, on land or beneath the sea
-wherever we operate-we go into
things thoroughly.
Sometimes we know when not
to come in out of the rain.

PHYSICISTS STUDY CAT
For the first time, scientists have
evidence that lasers may be useful in
detecting clear air turbulence, the
aircraft - battering, nerve - shattering
"bumps" an airplane may suddenly
encounter in a near-cloudless sky.
Over the past year, a trio of Univer-
sity of Michigan physicists have been
flying a light plane equipped with a
laser radar (optical wavelength ra-
dar) into regions of severe turbu-
lence in various sections of the coun-
try searching lor such evidence. The
three scientists — Peter A. Franken,
Joe A. fenney antl David M. Rank —
will continue their experiments un-
der Dr. Franken's direction with even
more advanced equipment this year.
Franken, a physicist noted for his
early work with laser applications,
is also an active private pilot with a
multi-engine rating. The research air-
craft, however, was piloteil by U-M
professional pilots.
Their work has been spurred bv the
insidious effects of "CAT," as pilots
term clear air turbulence. Not only
can it Hing coffee into passengers'
laps, it also has been blamed for send-
ing jetliners into uncontrollable at-
titudes which occasionally have re-
suhed in fatal trashes. The present
investigations of CA T are based on
the fact that "clear air is not really
clear. It always contains aerosols such
as tiny dust particles, ice crystals,
etc., typically about one micron (or
one-25,()00th inch) in size. Particles
of this size cannot be detected with
conventional microwave radar because
their wavelengths are so much larger
than the particles. Laser radars, how-
ever, are particularly effective because
optical wavelengths are comparable
to the size of these minute particles.
The work with lasers is based on the
fact that severe CAT is often associ-
ated with the interaction of two air
currents of significantly different tem-
peratures and dynamic conditions.
The Michigan scientists speculate
that there might be abrupt changes
in the particle concentration at the
interface between these currents,
which could be detected by the laser
radar.
Their current w-ork stems from ini-
tial experiments conducted in April
of 1964 by the Laser Systems Center
of Lear Siegler, Inc. (LSI) here in
collaboration with Dr. Franken. For
this, LSI equipped a twin-engine
Cessna 310 with a portable laser ra-
dar in the copilot's seat and flew it
into the wakes of large aircraft land-
ing and taking oft at Willow Run and
Detroit Metropolitan airports, with
the helpful cooperation of the con-
trol towers. Their results led to the
then-startling conclusion that other-
wise invisible aircraft wakes could
be detected by laser radar, which in
turn stimulated the present U-M pro-
gram. This program has been made
possible by support from the Offn &lt;
of Naval Research, the Bureau of Na-
val Weapons and the U.S. Weathei
Bureau.
Late in 1964, an Army L-2SD
(twin-engine Bonanza) operated b\
the U-M was equipped with an ad
vanced Q switched ruby laser and op
tical radar receiver manufactured b\
the LSI Laser Systems Center. A Q-
switched laser is equipped with a de-
vice which stores the already-brief
pulse of light until it reaches a highei
energy level, whereupon it is released
as an even shorter pulse of greatei
power. The aircraft also carried an
accelerometer to record turbulence.

and several cameras for registering
weather conditions and other techni-
cal data. The data were gathered by
flying into severe siorm areas near
Norman, Okla., and mountain wave
air current regions near Denver, Colo,
as well as around Detroit. Although
it is dangerous, clear air turbulence
is hard to find since it is such a local-
ized phenomenon, the U-M scientists
note: "As a result, moderate to se-
vere turbulence was rarely encoun-
tered."
Over 1300 experiments were per-
formed, of which 1200 revealed neith-
er turbulence nor discontinuities in
particulate matter. However, of the
remaining 100, approximately one-
third showed particulate discontinui-
ties alone, a third turbulence alone,
and the rest showed them together.
The fact that turbulence and aero-
sols are thus associated does not mean
the presence of aerosols indicates tur-
bulence, Dr. Franken cautioned, ft
does, however, provide the basis for

monitoring equipment assembled by LSI for the University of Michigan clear

jected through the fuselage walls and were aimed ahead of the aircraft.
continuing experiments.
"The critical question now is wheth-
er there are characteristic differences
in the distribution of the particulate
matter in turbulent versus quiet
areas," the U-M physicists report.
"We have in mind the possibility that
turbulent regions could provide a
bunching or 'blotchiness' of particu-

late matter that might have a merely
layered structure in calm atmos-
pheres." But he added: "The present
flight program could not distinguish
these . . . because . . . our optical ra-
dar provided only a one-dimensional
exploration of the atmosphere for-
ward of the aircraft."
So early this year experiments are
to continue, using a new type of laser
now under development by LSI. It is
expected that this new equipment
will provide "just the two-dimen-
sional map of the forward area re-
quired" for indentification of distinct
particle patterns, the report points
out. The continued research will be
carried out in jet stream and moun-
tain wave air currents and in severe
storm-associated turbulence, and at
altitudes up to 30,000 feet.
PROSPECTS IN ENGINEERING
Satisfying careers and a great de-
mand for his services exist for the
high school student interested in en-
gineering, says the dean of The Uni-
versity of Michigan Colloge of En-
gineering. "The need is unprecedent-
ed," Dean Gordon J. Van Wylen notes
in a statement for National Engineers
Week (Feb. 20-2(i). "We have never
seen anything like this in terms of
demand." The need ami the opportu-
nity to find challenging and satisfying
careers in engineering arise from the
needs of society, he points out: "Our
life and the world in which we live
are becoming increasingly technolog-
ically oriented. Not only do consumer
products such as houses, cars and re-
frigerators require more technical de-
velopment, but many national prob-
lems demand engineering solutions.
These include, for example, transpor-
tation, air and water pollution and
MARCH 1966
35


the continuing needs of the space and
defense programs, illustrate why "the
demand for engineers is skyrocket-
ing."
The U-M dean urged high school
students interested in engineering to
take all the math, chemistry and phys-
ics they can get in their high schools.
But English is not to be neglected, he
cautioned: "The engineer's ability to
read and communicate effectively is
becoming increasingly important." In
engineering college these skills are de-
veloped further along with engineer-
ing science, analysis, design and the
humanities. But the rigors of these
studies do not prohibit engineering
students from taking part in campus
life: Engineers now head the U-M in-
terfraternity council, Van Wylen
noted, and several are varsity ath-
letes. All of these help prepare the
students for positions of responsibility
and leadership, he said. About one-
third of all big businesses are now
headed by persons who were techni-
cally trained. And the U-M is well-
represented among these, the dean
said. It has long been among the top
few schools in the country both as
regards quality and the number of
all engineering degrees granted.
ENGINEERS SEEK NEW
HULL DESIGN
Naval architecture and marine en-
gineers at The University of Michi-
gan will seek to design from theory
a more efficient hull form for cargo
vessels of the future. The American
mediant marine is expected to need
cargo vessels in the near future that
ojjerate at substantially higher speeds
than are generally used by ships in
service today. This trend calls for
efficient hull forms in a speed range
where design information is still
scarce. A firm of naval architects and
marine engineers, Friede and Gold-
man of New Orleans, La., has granted
The University $10,000 for a one-
year research project. The object is
to find answers to some of the ques-
tions related to high speed hull de-
sign.
The staff of the U-M Department
of Naval Architecture and Marine
Engineering and some of its graduate
students will develop an optimized
hull form based on the theory of
wave resistance. A model of this will
be then tested and compared with
the performance of a model of a hull
form designed on an empirical basis.
Much of the work will lie based on
developments over the past few years
which make it possible now to seek
such new hull forms. These develop-
ments and research include mathe-
matical analysis of high speed hull
forms carried out at the U-M with
support from the U.S. Maritime Ad-
ministration over the past two years,
and U-M development work on the
bulbous bow.
SNOOPING ON APOLLO
Two University of Michigan ex-
periments were keyed to the launch
of the NASA Saturn IB-Apollo from
Cape Kennedy, Fla., on February 26,
1966. About five miles from the
launch area, a cross-shaped array of
nine ultrasensitive microphones lis-
tened to the rocket's rumble from its
lift-off to as high as 30 miles in a
measurement of high altitude winds.
And, as the vehicle came down near
Ascension Island in the South At-
lantic, another U-M crew fired an
instrumented package aloft on a small
rocket to measure the density of the
atmosphere through which the re-
turning spacecraft descended. Both
experiments were carried out by the
Space Physics Laboratory of the U-M
department of electrical engineering.
NASA Marshall Space Flight Center
sponsored the listening experiment,
while Goddard SFC supported the
Ascension Island work.
Nine microphones were stretched
out in twin mile-long arms of a cross,
and were so arranged to detect dif-
ferent arrival times of the noise of
the rocket's engine. The arrival times
of the noise vary according to the di-
rection and speed of the winds
through which the rocket passed, ex-
plained engineer Wesley Bushman,
in charge of the experiment. Correlat-
ing the arrival limes with the rocket's
position by means of radar tracking
of the rocket should have given a di-
rect measurement of high altitude
winds up to about 50 miles. "Using
the rocket as the noise source means
that measurments of these winds can
be made almost daily," Bushman
said, "and regular measurements of
these should be useful to meteorolo-
gists and atmospheric scientists."
The U-M lab developed the method
by basing it on previous work which
used rocket lofted grenades as the
noise source. These experiments had
been developed by the High Altitude
Laboratory of the U-M aerospace en-
gineering department.
"Also the measurements are useful
in studying the rocket's flight because
we measure the winds actually en-
countered by the rocket as it goes
through them. Nobody else has done
this at these altitudes," Bushman
pointed out.
The package fired from Ascension
Island was a pilot-static probe which
measures temperature, density ami
pressure. A Nike Apache boosted the
package for measurements up to 90
miles altitude. The crew at the South
Atlantic island launched a second
package twelve hours later to obtain
a measurement of the same parameters
during nighttime conditions. The
U-M Space Physics Laboratory has
used over a do/en of the pitot-static
probes in some 50 previous rocket
experiments. The Ascension Island
experiment is under the direction of
Jack Horvath. The crew members at
the island are John Rooks, Gary Ru-
pert anil Lyle Slider. Along with
Bushman at Cape Kennedy is Lynn
Degner.
WOLVERINES IN SPACE
Another former University of Mich-
igan student will play a key role in
America's space program. He is Astro-
naut David R. Scott, scheduled to try
to establish a world "spacewalk" rec-
ord of perhaps two hours during the
Gemini 8 orbital flight. Lift-off was set
for March 15 at Cape Kennedy. Scott
studied engineering at the Uriiversiiv
from 1949 to 1950. He then went on
to graduate fifth in his class at West
Point. Scott also earned a Master's
Degree at Massachusetts Insititute of
Technology. Last year, two other for-
mer U-M students, Astronauts Mc-
Divitt and White, were honored by
The University of Michigan in a spe-
cial ceremony. Astronaut White made
his famed space walk during their
historic flight.
MOON SCANNER PLANNED
University of Michigan research en-
gineers recently got the go-ahead to
begin design of a TV-like scanning
and imaging device for studying the
geology of the moon from a lunar
satellite. Their work on the "spectral
radiometric imaging system" will be-
gin under $96,000 funding from the
Department of Interior's U.S. Geo-
logical Survey. The system will pro-
duce TV-like images of the lunar
surface in many narrow spectral or
radiation bands — in the infrared and
ultraviolet radiation regions as well
36
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


ments in all three of these radiation
regions yield data about the physical
properties and elements of the lunar
surface materials, because such radia-
tion is a function of these properties.
Infrared engineers of the Willow Run
Laboratories, part of the U-M Insti-
tute of Science and Technology, will
develop the instrument for the Apol-
lo Applications Program — the plan
for lunar studies to complement
manned exploration of the moon.
Marvin R. Holter, U-M head of the
Infrared and Optical Sensor Labora-
tory, said the device in orbit around
the moon will permit scientists "to
identify elements on the lunar sur-
face ami produce a compositional and
structural map of the surface. "And
the fact that the information comes
in line-scanned image form (like a
TV picture) will also give us a good
picture of lunar geography." He
pointed out such surveys are neces-
sary because astronauts on foot will
be able to explore "only a small part
of the lunar surface in our lifetimes."
The 1ST group's work will be based
on their development of similar de-
vices for studies of earth's geography
and vegetation from a satellite — part
of a technique becoming known as
"remote sensing." Willow Run Lab-
oratories engineers were instrumental
in development of this technique and
its devices.
CONTINUING EDUCATION
PROBLEM
Some business executives may need
periodic sabbatical leaves to go back
to school, according to an associate
professor of marketing at The Uni-
versity of Michigan Graduate School
Profiles . . . cont. from page 28
is, however, a poor investment for the
future, as the same slope would be
expected to continue indefinitely, in-
fluenced only seniority and by the
aggressiveness of the union leadership.
Such a dismal prospect can hardly
be termed a professional career at all!
Summary and Conclusion
My premise here can be summarized
in Space Age terminology. Imagine
Phase I in the career chart as the
launching pad, where the rocket and
its scientific payload are carefully pre-
pared in every possible detail that can
l&gt;e anticipated. At the end of Phase I
comes the blast-off, when the missile
takes off with accelerating velocity,
of Business Administration. Dr. Mar-
tin R. Warshaw, in an address pre-
sented at a seminar on physical dis-
tribution management sponsored by
the Chicago Association of Com-
merce, said periodic full-time study
may be the best way for certain man-
agers to avoid "executive obsoles-
cence" and to keep from being "drop-
outs with degrees." Warshaw, who is
president of the Detroit Chapter of
the American Marketing Association,
said two factors are responsible for
the fact that most companies have
executives who have failed to keep
up with a rapidly-changing world and
thereby have cut their career poten-
tials short.
"First, technological change is oc-
curing with increased rapidity," he
explained. "With this change has
come the 'knowledge explosion' or
rapid proliferation of facts, relation-
ships, and know-how which can be
brought to bear on various aspects of
human endeavor. Although the im-
pact of change does not fall equally
on all areas of knowledge, very few
human beings can escape some degree
of diminution of their intellectual
capital. ". . . The second half of the
problem is that even in the face of an
ever-increasing knowledge gap, most
attempts to reduce the rate of mana-
gerial obsolescence receive marginal
efforts. At best, programs for manage-
ment upgrading receive small alloca-
tions of time from the work week.
At worst, education for executives is
relegated to overtime, a gray area in
the executive week which is best
identified as composed of those hours
when intellectual vitality is at a low
ebb."
Many middle managers need peri-
eventually to go into the Phase III
orbit at a time and place determined
by the power of the booster rocket.
Vital to the success of the Hight is
the efficiency of the propellant fuel.
I consider Professional Attitude to be
the propellant that prescribes the
course of the Hight to Success. If the
rocket engine has been tuned to its
best, the fuel compounded of the ele-
ments of Motivation, Discipline, Par-
ticipation and Enthusiasm in their
proper proportions, all ready and
waiting for the count-down on the
day of opportunity to meet greater
responsibility — then, truly, the sky
will be the limit!
fust one more thought, which may
odic re-exposure to formal study of
the business functions while those in
physical distribution management
would benefit from courses in eco-
nomic analysis, selected areas of math-
ematics such as calculus, linear alge-
bra, probability theory, and computer
simulation techniques, Warshaw said.
"The ideal situation would be one in
which a middle manager with top
management potential would be able
to receive a sabbatical of one year's
duration financed by his employer.
Such time spent at a first-rate gradu-
ate school of business would provide
the executive with opportunity to
pursue a well-rounded program of
study."
The alternative method of study
while working is inadequate on two
counts, Warshaw said: "First, it
makes the educational experience a
part-time task. The day-to-day re-
quirements of business get first call
on the executive's time and energies,
while learning takes place mainly on
non-compensated overtime. Second,
the firm does not make a sufficient fi-
nancial sacrifice when it sponsors
night or short-course educational pro-
grams." If the steel workers' union
can get 13-week sabbaticals for its
members, cannot management do bet-
ter for its own? Warshaw asked. "If
industry is serious about retraining
middle management and is willing
to make the investment in human
resources, we in the universities can
develop programs of study, preferably
on campus, which can lessen the mid-
dle management knowledge gap
now," he said. Ultimately, of course,
the executive must be led to assume
the burden of his own continuing
self-education, Warshaw added. |

educated as an engineer — used these
words in his luncheon invocation at
the San Francisco Annual Meeting of
ASCE in 1963. He said:
"As engineers, we take the materials

and shape them, and apply them to
the needs of men.

Or...in aircraft terminology: the new Allison Combustor
turns out four times the heat release of combustors in
production engines. Yet a combustor for a 10,000 lb. thrust
engine can be held in one hand.
It's an Allison breakthrough in lightweight engine tech-
nology. Immediate application: Allison Lift engines. De-
signed to propel tomorrow's jet aircraft straight up.
So far, Allison Lift engines have attained thrust/weight
ratios over four times those of production engines.
Other factors have contributed: Like new com-
pressor blades that raise pressure 50%.
Advanced turbine cooling techniques allow
higher inlet temperatures. Greater power. Lower
blade temperatures.
Even greater advances are on the way—for turbojet and
turbofan engines. With 30:1 thrust/weight ratios forecast.
Shorter compressors. More efficient combustors. For lift or
cruise engines.
Advanced lightweight technology is another demonstra-
tion of Allison's broad capabilities in research, engineer-

observation that the average differen-
tial for the M.S. degree in Chemical
was only $103 compared to $190 for
Electricals and $151 for Aero. Civil,
however, continued to show the low-
est average differential at $74, and it
is known that some employers of
Civil engineers offered no difference
in salary for the M.S. degree. See
Tables III and fV.
Similarly, Chemical industry was
tied with Electronics for the highest
B.S. average, ahead of both Aero-
space and Automotive at 4.4%. At
the M.S. level, the Chemical industry
ranked as fifth, with Aerospace and
Electronics substantially ahead of all
others. Again, this indicates the
higher premium for the M.S. degree
in these fields.
Thus in conclusion, it seems that
the engineering profession is again
on the upsurge. Looking ahead, it is
hard to predict any sure trends while
the subtle shifts in industry are tak-
ing place. One thing is apparent,
however; students and alumni are
making much better and more effec-
tive use of the Engineering Placement
Service. Don't be left behind, check

its intended use, by a process of mi-
crostructural rearrangement.
Alloys are tested in experimental
setups of the type shown in figure 1.
The specimen, usually a strip of alloy-
six inches long and one inch wide, is
suspended in a furnace and subjected
to stress by a lever arm arrangement.
As the stress on the specimen deforms
it—i.e., stretches it—readings are made
on a graduated scale capable of meas-
uring changes as small as 0.000005
inch per inch. Changes in the amount
of deformation with time are used
in determining the creep rate, and if
the specimen ruptures the time of its
rupture is recorded.
To test for sensitivity to cracks, the
Research Group uses "sharp edge-

of stress &lt;r (&lt;Ti &gt; &lt;r2 &gt; as), Tem-
notched" specimens to simulate the
presence of cracks. When a specimen
one inch wide is notched on both
sides so that the root radius of each
notch is about 0.0006 inch, the result
is a stress concentration factor of
about twenty; that is, applying a
given stress to the specimen increases
the instantaneous stress at the root
of the notch by a factor of twenty.
As a result deformation takes place
which relaxes the stress down to a
level, which, usually, the alloy can
carry without rupturing. For reasons
not yet understood, this deformation
does not always occur. One of the
chief reasons for the extensive re-
search being conducted is to learn
what it is that sometimes prevents
the deformation, and then to control
the phenomenon.
Stress-rupture time curves for the
notched specimens were established
at 800, 1,000, and 1,200°F. The posi-
tion of these curves showed that the
specimens had unexpectedly low
strength under stress at temperatures
of 1,000 and 1,200°F, although in
all other respects their properties
were extremely good. An undetected

sensitivity of the suj&gt;eralloys beiii-^
examined. If the causes can be found,
they can perhaps be eliminated b\
modifying variables of proces-i::,

As another part of the SST prin
gram, the Research Group is studying
a precipitation - hardened stainless
steel. Specimens are undergoing un-
interrupted creep-rupture tests, at
550° F, which are to last for 30.0OU
hours (about three and a half years;.
Standby generators are held in readi-
ness to keep the temperature constant
in case the University power supply
fails. The purpose is to determine
how much creep occurs, if any, ami
more important, whether and in what
way the alloy's mechanical properties
will change after long periods of stress
at this temperature.
Such long tests are inconvenient
but so far have been unavoidable. No
one has yet found a way to compress
time, but the group is looking lor
reliable methods of extrapolating
short-time data on mechanical prop-
erties to long periods. If such methods
are found, they should be applicable
to superalloys as well. |

wants two kinds of mechanical engineers:
1. burning with ambition to reach manager's status
as soon as possible
• College grade-point average on the high side in
technical subjects
Secrelly admitted to self at certain point in undergraduate career
that the scholar's way of life is for other people but smart enough
to have kept secret jrom the professors who are, after all, scholars.
Diploma in, secret out.
• Seeks prosperous, highly diversified employer
Competitive personality who wants to play on a strong, long-
lasting team in the big leagues.
• Unafraid of choices and changes
With a mechanical engineering background, we might find him
adept at keeping a troupe of welders happy on a new petro-
chemical project, or designing a new type of machine for the
lithographic industry, or organizing a small laser-manufacturing
department, or operating a large magnetic tape plant, or profit-
ably piloting one of the world's major industrial corporations.
2. able to hold a manager's job in time but sure he
wouldn't like it
• College grade-point average on the high side in
technical subjects
Why not? The subjects were intrinsically interesting, and most
of the professors proved to have a clear understanding of them.
• Seeks prosperous, highly diversified employer
To practice modern mechanical engineering—this is not 1936—
one needs scope, contacts, and resources.
• Unafraid of choices and changes
With a mechanical engineering background, he might choose tc
take a high leap over the interdisciplinary wall into solid state
physics, pull some excessively generalized equations out of a
journal that others on the circulation list quickly glance at and
pass along. Six months later he may have a new composition of
matter on board a ship bucking the solar wind to Mars.
What is said here about mechanical engineers is equally applicable to chemical
engineers and electrical engineers. Our expansion rate now demands technical
people who, at the one extreme, are still fresh from the classroom with its
benefits and, at the other, have had ten years of practice in their professions and
are now ready to select a lifetime employer. We ofTer a choice of three communi-

A PREVIEW OF YOUR CAREER AT GENERAL ELECTRIC
Achieving Thrust for Mach 3
When the North American Aviation XB-70 established a mile-
stone by achieving Mach 3 flight, it was powered by six
General Electric J93 jet engines. That flight was tha high
point of two decades of G-E leadership in jet power that
began when America's first jet plane was flown in 1942. In
addition to the 30,000-pound thrust J93's, the XB-70 carries a
unique, 240-kva electrical system that supplies all on-board
power needs—designed by G-E engineers. The challenge of
advanced flight propulsion promises even more opportunity
at G.E. GETF39 engines will help the new USAF C-5A fly more
payload than any other aircraft in the world; the Mach 3
GE4/J5 is designed to deliver 50,000-pound thrust for a U.S.
Supersonic Transport (SST). General Electric's involvement
in jet power since the beginning of propellerless flight has
made us one of the world's leading suppliers of these prime
movers. This is typical of the fa:t-paced technical challenge
you'll find in any of G.E.'s 120 decentralized product opera-
tions. To define your career interest at General Electric,

ask your printer.
Now glass can do what metals can't. Add sharpness and dis-
tinction to printing by flexography and simplify the whole
process as well. Ask your printer.
Flexography is the art of printing with rubber plates on flex-
ible materials, such as the paper, film and foil used for packag-
ing. Conventionally the rubber plate is prepared from a metal
engraving. Trouble is, rubber tends to exaggerate the tiny irreg-
ularities found in etched metal.
Then Corning came along with a remarkable method for
engraving on glass, every particle of which is photosensitive.
The image to be etched is developed all the way through the
glass.
So the etch is deep. Clean. Diamond-sharp. The reproduc-
tion sparkles. Type glitters. The blurred look of rubber plate
printing is gone.
Photosensitive glass was developed by Corning. It opens up
a world of unprecedented applications, like the discovery of
a major new basic material. Yet it is only part of the enormous
promise in glass.
Today, glass can be made six times stronger than steel. Or
as soft as silk. It can bend or not bend. Break or not break.
Melt or not melt. It can be molded, cast, machined, drawn and
pressed. In short, it possesses more useful capabilities than any
other known material.
For solutions to their materials problems, industry and gov-
ernment are coming to Corning. Because Corning is the glass-
master. It's a broad, international company, with one of the
most daring, expert and imaginative research and engineering
staffs in the world. Plus a marketing principle that commits
them to developing products only in areas where a need exists
and no product does.
Young engineers seeking challenge, opportunity and ad-
vancement are invited to write to Career Development Man-
ager, Corning Glass Works, Corning, New York.

What does it take to gain recognition at
Ford Motor Company? If you have skills
that we can utilize, and if you're ambitious
as well as able, you can move ahead fast at
Ford! Consider the career of Eric Mangelsen:
Eric came to work at our Ypsilanti Plant in
February, 1961. During the initial stage of
his training program, he was given the
assignment to supervise the development,
design and construction of special production
calibrating and test equipment for auto-
mobile voltage regulators. Later, he was
assigned to processing and production of the transistor ignition
amplifier system for our 1963 cars. He was responsible for introducing
a new cleaning process for voltage regulator contact points, which
substantially reduced costs. He was also instrumental in processing
the refined transistorized regulator system used in our new 1966
automobiles.
Now a member of management with broad responsibilities in a key
Production Department, Eric Mangelsen has moved ahead rapidly
with a company that believes in giving young men every opportunity
to demonstrate their skill and ingenuity. Why not investigate? Talk
to our representative when he visits your campus. You can go far

«7&lt;4e Zdito*'* Pen—
"Hi Jack, . . . that's right, I'm at the University
of Michigan."
"Oh yes, that's where those teach-ins started,
isn't it?"
"Yes, . . . but so did the Peace Corps, and so did
McDivitt and White."
"Are there really a lot of 'weirdoes' on campus?"
"Not really 'weirdoes.' It's a front for a lot of
students, but it isn't too long before the rest
of the world kicks back at them."
Supposedly, an engineer's view of his own
ampus is not as broad as that of students in the
&gt;ther colleges. But an engineer is every bit as
well informed as any student about the current
issues, whether they be local, national or
international. He has his own ideas, and he has
his own ways to express those ideas. But when
he does speak, how does he speak? It's certainly
not on the Diag. raising a chant for "peace," "fair
rights" etc. Personally, I like the right to walk
on the "M" whenever I wish to; but I must admit
too that I like a good laugh, and what's more
fun than to sit on a bench and watch a protest
group? But the engineer has little time, and even
less desire, to protest for protest's sake. He is
concerned with the world in which he will soon
be a very important part, a real world of the
present and the future.
The engineering student learns to tackle a
problem objectively, to find immediate causes,
and to propose a direct solution to the problem.
For the future, he wants to build and to create;
he wants to suggest change in a well constructed,
respectable, and clearly suitable manner. If, after
four years, he has not prepared himself for this
future, big business will reject him and his
ideas without further consideration and no second
change. Consequently, the engineer has little
chance to diversify into psychology and sociology,
even though these have a much larger role in
business today both in the office and in the
factory. But business cannot afford to play around
with these because play means money, and
money is a very dear commodity.
However, not only does business kick, but so
do school boards, civil service boards, and so
on. The influences on a student before college can
be very strong and disasterous if pointed at him
in the wrong way. A school board realizes this,
and screens teachers accordingly. There are enough
pressures on a high school student presently so
that he does not need extremist ideas thrown
up in front of him before he is capable of making
a rational judgement. The transition from high
school to college is difficult enough with the
harder courses, new freedoms and the increased
responsibilities. High school fads have no place in
college, but for many new students, the added
freedom means a chance for extensions of these
fads. Many of these were ruled out of high
6


school, but with new freedom they are revived and
stretched to comic proportions.
Rut fad is built upon fad, and soon each
grows shaky and tumbles. Presently, the college
(and national) fad is to protest, and it is carried
on apparently by that same minority. It is this
that makes the news. The method does get
attention, but for the most part it is ineffectual
sensationalism. For a "sit-in" on the Diag. creates
little more than a nuisance or a freak show.
One side of a college education teaches
acceptance, not of appearances, but by an
examination of facts and ideas. Another side
points out that the manner of presentation
determines how readily a point is accepted. As
crude as it may seem, a person is like any
product on a supermarket shelf; its appearance
determines its saleability. Millions of dollars are
spent for pleasant, attractive, eye-catching
labels and ads so that what is behind them will
be examined. After a while a customer knows
from experience what to expect inside from what's
outside. I am afraid I am getting s;ck of findme
out what is behind the beard, frizzy hair, "shades"
and filthy levis. Why bother to look inside any
more until the label changes? Maybe then, at least
it will be a different kind of dog food. I am
also sure that over twenty-eight of the thirty
thousand students on this campus are here to earn
a degree and to go on to fill responsible positions
in society. But for this other shiftless lot there
remains the role of the "perennial student" who
is left here year after year to organize the protests
and teach-ins.
For those serious and already mature students,
there is little time to be planning the next march.
The engineer, especially, must spend most of
his time on his studies, because low grades, at
present, mean Viet Nam. Unfortunately, it seems
that Viet Nam will beckon for the next few years.
Whenever another Viet Nam teach-in rolls
around, I will always remember what two leading
professors said of the first teach-in when they
announced it at dinner in my residence hall. "Since
most of you will die in Viet Nam, you should
come to the teach-in and learn what you'll really be
dying for!" I cannot help wondering since then
just how "near the lunatic fringe" really is?
Like most students, I would not want to die in
Viet Nam, but also like most responsible students,
I know what I would be dying for. Then too,
like most students, I would fight hard to live just
to come back to a Diag. rally and finally have
sense enough to stomp on the dying
embers of the fire.
Once we are off campus, the world kicks
back hard. Most engineers, thank heaven, are
prepared to work with the rest of the world before
they leave the campus, not to say that the
conscientious LSStA graduate is not. But the one
who has the stale, stereotyped look of protest
may find it extremely difficult to put his degree
to use, . . . but who knows, there may be
a "degree burning," yet. O G V

OF VISUAL
PER
by
Frederick Miller
This article considers several per-
ceptual theories that have been
promulgated to answer the question,
"How is it possible that intrinsically
different elements, such as motor and
sensory, can affect us?" The question
is not only answered, but the rela-
tionship between the two elements,
the "plasticity" of motor-sensory con-
trol, is described. One can observe
the meaningfulness of theories of per-
ception by observing that of the
myriad of sense data impinging upon
an organism, it is primarily through
the selection and organization of this
data that the organism makes any
sense out of the environment (an
apparent paradox). Or to use San-
ford's analogy, the organism senses
the world, interprets what he senses,
responds to the sensations, and then
responds to his own responses. The
relation of motor to sensory aspects
in perception is implicit in the last
two of Sanford's steps, because it is
proposed that by responding to re-
sponses the organism is in effect chang-
ing his perceptions of his environ-
ment.
This is a very familiar phenome-
non; for example, consider how dif-
ferent a person's face seems alter you
know him from the time before you
knew him. Or say the word "country"
over and over; when the "raw sensa-
tions" are separated from the observers
knowledge and memories about what
the stimulation object is really like,
the word becomes only a collection
of sounds. We always perceive things
in the context of the "memory
images"1 that we have associated with
them, in doing so there is clearly the
problem of discrepancies between the
physical and observed world, which
is what happens in an illusion.
The relationship between percep-
tual and motor skills can be illus-
trated by such common concepts as
learning by motor repetition, as well
as the more complex theories, as for
example, the theory that the move-
ment of vocal cords during thought
shows that possibility of motor par-
ticipation in thought processes. The
question of the relationship is more
pertaining to the degree and the
essence of the linkage. Does motor
participation merely aid in percep-
tion, or is it intrinsic? Does motor
participation speed up perception
that would occur more slowly with-
out it? Two extreme positions on
these questions have been espoused,
both of which are not entirely proven.
One theory, Behaviorism, emphasizes
the motor role and says that responses
determine the perception. The Gestalt
theory, in contrast, claims that per-
ception is entirely an organization of
sensory factors.
The Behaviorist theory seems to be
the one that empirical evidence has
pointed toward; however, the evidence
is hardly as conclusive and absolute
as the theory states, nor do philoso-
phers agree. Berkeley's structuralist
theory of space perception is an ex-
ample of the behaviorist form of
reasoning at its best.'' This particular
theory denies that visual cues provide
information about spacial perception,
while maintaining that space is a
learned ability, i.e. that depth per-
ception consists of memory images
associated with visual stimuli from
the past. Although evidence negates
attributing the role of depth percep-
tion entirely to motor-learning pro-
cesses, evidence does substantiate the
claim that motor elements play a defi-
nite role with sensation.
The reason that sensation alone can-
not determine depth perception is
that static cues are ambiguous, and
these are the cues to which sensation
yields; this is because the image in
the eye falls on a planar, two dimen-
sional retina. These static cues are
familiar as overlapping forms,
shadows, unparallel lines, etc., all of
which are clues to depth, i.e. two
dimensional pictures of three dimen-
sional arrangements. Each is am-
biguous since the same retinal image
could be produced by either a two-
or three-dimensional pattern.3 "Any
theory that bases perception on depth
cues must consider space perception
to be equally ambiguous." 4 Each ob-
ject and jjoint could be produced by
an infinite number of objects and
points at various distances from the
eye, if the angle of location with re-
spect to the eye is constant.
Binocular vision theoretically could
account for (and many say it defin-
itely does) depth vision, because un-
like other static cues, there is a neces-
sary connection between spacial dis-
tance of a point and the stereoscopic
disparity between the images on the
retinas of both eyes. However, this
APRIL 1966
11


people (i.e. children born with vision
in only one eye) have demonstrated
good spatial judgement."
Factors in Depth Perception
Whether Berkeley realized these
aspects that validated his premise or
not, he operates on the assumption
that depth perception cannot be at-
tributed to vision alone. The muscle-
movement theory of visual space that
Berkeley introduced is an empirical
theory, one basing perception on past
experience. By this theory depth per-
ception is attributed to three factors:
1. kinesthetic sensations from mus-
cles of accommodation and conver-
gence; 2. memories of previous kines-
thetics from touching; and 3. "pure"
visual sensations." The infant learns
the idea of distance by a combination
of visual and kinesthetic experiments,
i.e. his arm bent at such an angle
allows him to reach his favorite toy.
These are at first accidental discover-
ies, but they lead to later "memory
images," a subconscious muscular
tension for the toy at an equal dis-
tance away as during the first trial.
In addition, the muscular action of
the eyes in convergence of the two
eyes for binocular vision as well as
the accommodation to focus on the
retina give additional muscular depth
cues (focus on your nose to test this).
It was mentioned previously that
Berkeley's absolute statements about
depth perception being only a muscu-
lar process have been disproved.
Several experimenters have tested
chickens hatched and reared in dark-
ness, as well as human infants as
soon as they can move around. The
chickens had no opportunity for
visual - kinesthetic associations, yet
when placed on small perches various
distances from a level surface, there
was a hesitancy to jump increasingly
proportional to the increased distance
above the surface.7 Similar experi-
ments with human infants were de-
signed so that the child is placed on
a sheet of glass, one half of which has
a pattern immediately below, the
other half of which has the pattern
in such a position as to appear to
drop off, creating a "visual cliff.""
The infants avoided the cliff and froze
when placed on it. This evidence, in-
cluding that gathered from experi-
ments with many other kinds of ani-
mals, is internally quite consistant; it
points to an innate quality of some
aspects of depth perception. Berkeley's
contribution does illustrate a defin-
ite involvement of visiomotor ex-
perience. This involvement will be
explained later, but to further estab-
lish that it does exist, consider the
results of the experiments using a
"kitten carousel." * The apparatus is
designed so that an active kitten
wheels a passive kitten around in a
room which is lighted and has a non-
distinct background, i.e. they receive
the same visual stimulation. This ex-
periment is similar to the many deal-
ing with sensory or motor depriva-
tion, and the results are identical: the
passive kitten shows a marked in-
ability on the visual cliff, as well as
an incapacity involving other visual
tasks and visiomotor co-ordination.
Perhaps depth perception is not as
innate as the previous "visual cliff"
experiment had claimed. In any case,
the development of this perception
(whether innate or not) is related
directly to tonic sensation.
Work in the field of sensory-motor
interaction has been carried on by
three main groups: Werner and
Wapner in the United States, Ivo

Kohler in Austria, and Richard Held,
also in the United States.
The "Tonic" Theory
Werner and Wapner proposed a
theory of perception called the
"sensory-tonic field" theory.1" "Tonic"
refers to proprioceptive feedback from
the muscles, and "sensory" to afferent
activity in the nervous system. Basic-
ally the theory says that any percept
is a combination and interaction be-
tween sensory and tonic activity, and
further that these two sources of in-
put can substitute for each other (a
lack in one can compensate for an
excess in the other). This says that
motor and sensory factors are dynami-
cally equivalent, or that the motor
responses one makes to sensations de-
termine in part the perceptions. The
theory is hardly novel, but compel!
ing empirical evidence is offered in
support.
The first part of the evidence is
that the sensory and motor areas of
the cortex of the brain are not as
sharply separated as is commonh
thought. In particular, the involve-
ment of both sensory and motor re-
sponses in sight has been described.
The methodology of this demonstra-
tion is approximated by one experi-
ment on interaction between tonic
variables and the visual perception of
verticality. The subject's task was to
state the position at which a lumines-
cent rod in a dark room appeared
vertical. Tonic stimulation of two
types, electric stimulation of the sub-
jects neck muscles and auditory stimu-
lation to one ear, were applied.
Both forms of stimulation influ-
enced the position at which the rod
was perceived to be vertical. In gen-
eral the rod was displaced more for
the stimulated subject than unstimu-
lated, and the direction was opposite
the side where the stimulation oc-
cured. The results are interpreted as
"changes in perception attributed to
the influence on perception of verti-
cality of proprioreceptive impulses
arising through increased muscle
tonus." "The effect is a repulsion of
the perception that would occur
through purely sensory data by the
motor variable.
In another experiment the effect
of body tilt on the apparent vertical
rod was studied. As predicted, a
greater tilt, or a greater lack of sup
port, produced a greater effect on the
perception of the verticality of the
rod. "The crucial postural factor is

not position per se but degree of
muscular involvement.""
These two studies are only a few
of the many Werner and Wapner
made, but they illustrate the experi-
mental approach to the sensory-tonic
theory. In general they conclude that
the motor responses influence percep-
tion.
The work of the last two psycholo-
gists mentioned in the area of sensory-
motor control concerns the phe-
nomena of adaptation, changes in per-
ceptual norms. Adaption-level theory
is defined: "Using the whole gamete
of stimular magnitudes to which he
is accustomed as a "frame" for his
judgments, the individual establishes
an "average" as a standard."12 The
question to answer seems to be "What
criteria suffice to determine this
standard?" To answer this, Koher,
and others have studied primarily the
adaptation process which occur when
this "standard" is upset, and Held, in
a very strong penetrating study, has
come up with some fascinating evi-
dence to support the idea of plasticity
as the mediation between sensory and
tonic elements.
Visual Phenomena
What is so important about this
topic of adeptation is that it is in-
trinsic to perception based on stand-
ards which are not always constant,
but which seem to lead to a well
agreed upon picture of the outside
world. The visual system illustrates
the problem. The eye has several de-
fects, one of which is a lack of cor-
rection for spherical aberration on the
lens. If this is so, then straight lines
should look curved, but they don't.
There is also a phenomenon called
chromatic aberration, in which dif-
ferent wavelengths of light originat-
ing on a common point do not have
a common focus, yet studies have
shown that this also is equalized by
the visual system under normal con-
ditions." These facts would seem to
indicate that tests could be made
which would change the sensory data,
but the world construct would be pre-
served through some adjustment, and
this is exactly what has been done.
Some of the results of the more in-
teresting experiments will be only
briefly resumed.
One area of research has considered
adaptation, after effects, and succes-
sive contrasts. When one color is
viewed for a long time, an afterimage
of the opposite hue is seen. This has
usually been attributed to fatigue of
specific color receptors which allow
the remaining unfatigued receptors to
contribute disproportionately to what
is seen. Yet for some experiments the
resultant afterimage lasts for a con-
(Courtcsy oj Scientific American)
siderable length of time, far longer
than a fatigue theory could prove.
Also, similar aftereffects have been
demonstrated for such complex prop-
erties as si/e, shape, motion, and
hepatic sense (the shape determined
only through touch). One study with
figure aftereffects indicates that con-
tours are repelled from regions that
were previously saturated by other
contours. There is also a shape after-
effect, illustrated by allowing ones
eyes to scan a curved line for a short
period of time, and then looking at
a straight line. Not only will the
straight line appear curved, but sub-
sequent curved lines will then look
more straight." This phenomenon
could have specific relevance to the
spherical aberration of the eye, and
will be considered more closely when
goggle experiments are discussed.
How can a single mechanism ex-
plain all these visual aftereffects? The
contour repulsion is an illustration
of fixation, which involved no eye
movements. The shape repulsion was
one which occurred with free eye
movement. The goggle experiments
involve the entire body. Further, con-
sider experiments with kinesthetic
and proprioceptive aftereffects, in
which a blindfolded person rubs a
given shape and afterwards, when
asked to place his hands in a parallel

the subject turns his eyes to view
something at the right side of his
field of vision, he sees blue, and when
he turns his eyes left, he sees yellow.
And yet not only was there a great
degree of adaptation to this, but after
the goggles were removed, the sub-
ject for a considerable time saw the
complementary colors of the colors
of the halves of each lens of the
glasses, as he turned his eyes right and
left. Kohler deduces from his experi-
mentation the following:
We concluded, therefore, that
sense organs are not rigid machines
but living and variable systems,
the functioning of which is itself
subject to variation. If a sensory
system is exposed to a new and pro-
longed stimulus situation that de-
parts from the one normally ex-
perienced, the system can be ex-
pected to undergo a fundamental
change in its normal mode of opera-
tion.
When we make the system break
down and learn a new way of func-
tioning, we do not believe we are
forcing the system to function arti-
ficially or abnormally. We assume,
rather, that a single mechanism is
at work at all times."
Perception with Feedback
A final area of research on adap-
tion not only demonstrates motor in-
fluenced perception, but perception
conditioned to motor feedback, i.e.
Kohler's "single mechanism." The
question asked by Held is "How can
the visual control of spatially co-
ordinated action be stable under
normal circumstances yet sufficiently
modifiable to allow for recovery from
transformation.?"18 His answer is that
recovery takes time and a renewed
contact with the environment.
This plasticity in sensory-motor
systems is clearly illustrated by Koh-
ler's experiments; for adaption oc-
cured provided that during the ex-
periment the person wearing the
goggles was allowed to make volun-
tary contact with the environment.
This is then the single mechanism that
could explain all the phenomena pre-
viously listed, and the application to
three areas of human perception:
1. the development of normal sensory-
motor control in the young (i.e.
muscular co-ordination)
2. the maintenance of that control
once developed
(Continued on page 29)
position while blindfolded, he over-
compensates and his hands are un-
parallel in the direction opposite to
the shape originally felt. (This is
similar to the work of Werner and
Wapner).
These aftereffects can certainly
not be attributed to any conceivable
set of sensory receptor neurons,
since whole muscle systems are in-
volved. Instead, the aftereffects
occur in a space that transcends the
individual receptors and kinesthetic
receptors . .
This is to say, that the adjustment
deals with some sensory-tonic theory
of learning.
Distortion Tests
A second area of adaptation re-
search, pertinent to sensory-motor
control, is the experimental change in
the relationship between sensory
modalities. These experiments mostly
deal with adaptation to physical dis-
tortion produced by wearing prismatic
lenses. The kinds of distortion tested
have been:
1. overall displacement of visual
image of about eleven degrees
2. curvature of vertical straight lines
3. spherical dispersion (colored
fringes)
4. complex differential displacement
of visual images, varying with the
angle of regard and the direction
of head movement
5. colored glasses
In one experiment to test the first
distortion, subjects were made to wear
goggles that displaced what they saw,
and tests were made before, during
and after this exposure." The tests
consisted of drawing the completion
of a square on a piece of paper with
one vertex given, selection of addi-
tional lenses that would just elimi-
nate the effect of the original lenses in
the glasses, and location of audible
clicks. After three days, there was
more than forty percent adaptation
and after forty-two days the adapta-
tion was more than ninety percent.
Ivo Kohler has also experimented
extensively in this field of goggle
distortion.17 In one experiment, which
distorted the visual image and added
color aberrations at fringes of shapes,
both were adapted for. To show the
complexity of the adaptation and the
intrinsic involvement of motor, con-
sider another of Kohler's tests using
colored glasses. Each lens is so colored
that the right half is blue and the left

What might you be doing?
Asa MANUFACTURING ENGINEER you'd
/\ work closely with Bell Telephone
J. JL Laboratory engineers on the latest
concepts in communications systems. It would
be your job to work out production techniques
for these systems, which might mean devel-
oping special tools, machines, or test equip-
ment. You would have the opportunity of
guiding products from their final develop-
ment to the point where they roll off the pro-
duction line.
As an industrial engineer your work
would be more closely related to the search
for new ideas to reduce the cost of currently
manufactured products, to improve their
quality or make the job easier. Many of the
Industrial Engineer's problems relate to hu-
man engineering as well as to operations
research and the establishment of wage in-
centive rates.
As a systems equipment engineer
you'd really know how a communications sys-
tem operates, because you'd have built it on
paper before it was manufactured and in-
stalled. After one of your systems had been
installed, you'd be held accountable for its
performance and compatibility with existing
systems.
As a MILITARY SERVICE ENGINEER you'd
be concerned with research, design, develop-
ment, testing, production, delivery, and assist-
ance to the military in the operation and
maintenance of complex military systems.
Systems applications range from the ocean
depths to outer space. You could expect a
wide variety of engineering assignments in

INDUSTRIAL
ENGINEERING
by James Myers
Industrial Engineering at the Uni-
versity of Michigan is the newest and
one of the most progressive depart-
ments in the College of Engineering.
Industrial Engineering is so new, in
fact, that the department did not
gain accreditation until 1950. Since
it is such a new field the duties of an
Industrial Engineer in industry are
not yet clearly defined. In order to
achieve some conception of the In-
dustrial Engineer's role it is necessary
to examine his position in industry,
the history of Industrial Engineering
from its beginning in the early 190()'s,
and to study the development of the
Industral Engineering curriculum in
the University along with its unique
program for student training.
In today's industry there is a widen-
ing gap between industrial manage-
ment and engineering. This gap is a
result of the highly specialized nature
of our economy. Each specialty has
reached such a high level of complex-
ity and sophistication that meaningful
communication between them has
ceased. It is the role of the Industrial
Engineer to bridge this gap between
management and engineering. The
training of the Industrial Engineer
overlaps both science and manage-
ment and this gives him the ability
to communicate in both technical and
nontechnical terms and the under-
standing to appreciate both the prob-
lems of management and engineering.
At the turn of the century when
industrialization and economic ex-
pansion moved into high gear the
realization occurred that there were
factors of distance and time involved
in the integration and coordination
of the small unit operations in an
industrial organization. The study of
this problem began on a very small
scale. Representative of the research
carried out at the time was the work
of Frederick W. Taylor. His first
studies in "scientific management"
were aimed at the relationship of the
single worker to tools and machines.
Taylor was concerned with the ad-
justment of human performance to
suit the job and tools. These studies
have expanded considerably from this
meager beginning until today they
are concerned with the coordination
of men, materials, machines, and
methods to meet the optimum re-
quirements of social and economic
needs. This is what we now call In-
dustrial Engineering.
The fact that this coordination in-
volves the worker requires that the
Industrial Engineer must have un-
derstanding of the human factors
involved. He must understand the
coordination of group activities for
the efficient use of workers and the
psychological and physiological im-
plications involved. This takes on
increased importance when one sees
how the coordination of worker
groups has led to an increased role
of the worker in decision making.
This is particularly manifest in union-
management relations and brings to
light the fact that the Industrial En-
gineer strives for coordination, not
manipulation. It was manipulation
that drove the workers to the union
in the first place. The Industrial En-
gineer's understanding of the worker
allows him to predict and cope with
managerial problems.
The goal of coordination is eco-
nomic optimization This optimiza-
tion includes not only the coordina-
tion of worker groups, but also the
efficient use of materials and ma-
chines. For this, the Industrial Engi-
neer must put his technical knowledge
to use and must work closely with the
accounting and engineering depart-
ments to determine the most efficient
use of these assets. The ability to co-
ordinate makes the Industrial Engi-
neer especially valuable for decision
making since he is aware of economic
alternatives and can predict the be-
havior of industrial organizations.
The growth of Industrial Engineer-
ing is closely paralleled by the growth
of the Industrial Engineering depart-
ment at the University of Michigan.
A course in shop management was
offered in 1915 and it is believed to
be one of the first courses in Indus-
trial Engineering although the name.
Industrial Engineering, as such, did
not appear until 1921. As in most
other schools Industrial Engineering
began here as a branch of Mechanical

to obtain a combined IE and ME
degree for a 173 credit hours work.
It was some time before a Bachelor
of Science in Industrial Engineering
became available. This took place in
1950 when the Industrial Engineer-
ing department was accredited by the
Engineering Council for Professional
Development. However, Industrial
Engineering was not separated from
the Mechanical Engineering depart-
ment until 1956. The first doctor's
degree was given in 1953.
In 1955 the undergraduate program
began by offering the traditional
courses in Industrial Engineering:
1) factory management; 2) plant lay-
out and material handling; 3) motiva-
tion and time study; 4) job evaluation
and wage incentives; 5) engineering
economy; 6) production control and
7) manufacturing processes. The re-
maining subjects were mainly in Me-
chanical Engineering accompanied by
nine hours of electives. In 1956 a
required course in operation research
was added and in 1957 a course in
data processing. Since that time
courses in statistical management
control, human factors in engineer-
ing design, and work simplification
have been added to keep pace with
the latest Industrial Engineering
trends. Since Industrial Engineering
is such a new field new facets are
being developed every day and the
curriculum is continually being
changed to keep pace with this. 140
credit hours are required for gradua-
tion.
Since Industrial Engineering is still
in the process of change it would be
impossible for a student to take all
the courses necessary to equip him to
handle every situation. Therefore, it
is the aim of the Industrial Engineer-
ing department to present a funda-
mental program which does not teach
the student what he will do after
graduation, but teaches him an under-
standing of the use of science and
management together in an industrial
society. Future plans call for the in-
tegration and consolidation of present
courses and introduction of courses
from the first year graduate level.
This will make the requirements more
challenging to acquire and attract
better students.
There is also a graduate program
in Industrial Engineering embodying
rigorous studies and good lab facil-
ities. It is possible to obtain a Mas-
ter's Degree, a Professional Degree, or
a Ph.D. The program includes work
on research in work measurement,
methods analysis, plant layout, data
processing, industrial statistics, qual-
ity control and operation research.
Industrial Engineering programs in
other colleges throughout the country
are basically the same as this one.
However, from university to univer-
sity one finds varying thought on
which aspects of the program should
be emphasized; the humanities, with
stress on psychology or sociology; or
the pure engineering subjects. As the
role of the Industrial Engineer in in-
dustry becomes stabilized and shifts
either to the human factors side or to
the engineering side this controversy
will undoubtedly disappear, and the
Industrial Engineering program will
stabilize.
One of the most severe complaints
leveled against engineering colleges
today is the lack of experience that
graduates have in the field in which
they are trained. The Industrial En-
gineering department of the Uni-
versity of Michigan is a leader in
initiating a program to overcome this
deficiency.
The program, under the direction
of Prof. Clyde W. Johnson, began at
the U of M Medical Center in 1959.
Its underlying principle was that the
engineer should have a period of
internship similar to that of a doctor.
The basic outline of the program was
that students, under the direction of
IE faculty members, would work with
various hospital supervisors on studies
of several aspects of hospital opera-
tions. It should be noted that hos-
pitals are organized on a basis which
resembles industrial plants since they
provide medical services with produc-
tion facilities such as laundry and
food service. From the hospital's
point of view the purpose of the plan
was to arrest and reduce costs while
maintaining the same higher quality
of patient care. The results of the
program were very gratifying since a
$25,000 savings resulted from a study
on the handling of linen.
Another aspect of the program was
the training of hospital supervisors
by IE faculty members in work sim-
plification and methods improvement.
The purpose of this was to instill
in the hospital staff, from the top to
the bottom, an awareness of cost fac-
tors in the daily business routine.
Stressed in this training were the In-
dustrial Engineering principles of
plant layout, work sampling, plan-
ning and scheduling, value analysis
and engineering economy.
The way the program was admin-
istered was to ask for problems from
the supervisors and then teams of
students, supervisors and faculty
studied and analyzed these problems
to obtain solutions. These solutions
were then presented to the hospital
administration for permission to put
them into effect. When this had been
obtained and the program set in
operation a follow-up study was con-
ducted by the group to see that the
program was properly carried out
and to see what effect it had on cost
factors. The original program started
with three students and the program
now contains 25, ranging from the
sophomore to the graduate level. Stu-
dents work in teams usually headed
by a graduate student.
Today the program is still carried
out in basically the same manner, first
with a lecture to hospital supervisors
on what IE technics can do for them,
then an eight week course consisting
of one class per week on IE principles
and their applications, and then the
introduction of student-faculty-super-
visor teams to study the problems
obtained from the supervisors. Some
of the projects currently underway in
the University Hospital are: "opera-
tional analysis of the cardiovascular
unit of internal medicine; bedmaking
study-use of new disposable mattress
cover: determination of the frequency
of usage of disposable polyethylene
coated examination table covers in
clinics and the expected amount of
savings with their use; Women's Hos-
pital linen distribution system; patient
equipment room; linen distribution
system; and cost analysis for pack-
aged detergent disinfectant products.
The results of this program have
been so spectacular that similar pro-
grams are currently in progress in
public and private hospitals through-
out the state and in the Detroit Pub-
lic School System. By the end of 1966
12 projects will have been completed.
In the beginning of the program only
the basic methods of motion study,
layout, flow scheduling and work
sampling were used. In 1962 sim-
ulation, electronic data processing,
queueing theory, management games
and statistical inventory control were
introduced. These were technics com-

Air Force: can you help us solve one?
1. Repairs in space. If something goes
wrong with a vehicle in orbit, how can it
be fixed? Answers must be found, if large-
scale space operations are to become a
reality. For this and other assignments Air
Force scientists and engineers will be
called on to answer in the next few years,
we need the best brains available.
2. Lunar landing. The
exact composition of
the lunar surface, as
well as structural
and propulsion char-
acteristics of the space
vehicle, enter into
this problem. Important study remains to
be done—and, as an Air Force officer,
you could be the one to do it!
3. Life-support biology. The filling of
metabolic needs over very extended peri-
ods of time in space is one of the most
fascinating subjects that
Air Force scientists are in-
vestigating. The results
promise to have vital ram-
ifications for our life on
earth, as well as in outer
space.
4. Space orientation. The orbital prob-
lems of a spacecraft, including its ability
to maneuver over selected points on the
earth, are of vital importance to the mili-
tary utilization of space. There are plenty
of assignments for young Air Force physi-
cists in this area.
6. Space propulsion. As our
space flights cover greater
and greater distances, pro-
pulsion—more than any-
thing else—will become the
limiting factor. New fuels
and new propulsion tech-
niques must be found, if we
are to keep on exploring
the mysteries of space. And
it may well be an Air Force
scientist on his first assign-
ment who makes the big
breakthrough!
7. Pilot performance.
Important tests must still be
made to determine how the
pilots of manned aero-
spacecraft will react to
long periods away from
the earth. Of course
not every new Air
Force officer be-
comes involved in research and develop-
ment right away. But where the most ex-
citing advances are
taking place, young
Air Force scientists,
administrators,
pilots, and engineers
are on the scene.

5. Synergetic plane changing. The abil-
ity of a spacecraft to change altitude can
also be crucial to space operations. Where
but in the Air Force could Sc.B.'s get the
chance to work on such fascinating proj-
ects right at the start of their careers?

DEAN MORGAN
BS (ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING)
UNIVERSITY OF UTAH
A typical example of a PROJECT ENGINEER
is Dean Morgan. He joined UNIVAC upon
his graduation in 1960, and was assigned to
the Memory Engineering Department. For
two years he was engaged in the circuit and
logic design of a thin film control memory
for the UNIVAC 1107 computer, and a com-
puter developed for the U. S. Navy. During
the last assignment, Dean was given the re-
sponsibility of Proposal Manager for devel-
oping a proposal and cost estimate for a
small low power data buffer memory to be
used in a deep space experiment to be con-
ducted by Jet Propulsion Laboratories. This
was the Mariner IV Program.
In writing the proposal Dean became the
most likely candidate to head up the pro-
gram should we win. As it turned out,
UNIVAC was awarded the contract for the
design, development and fabrication of flight
models of a data buffer memory system.
FRAME-MARS BY MARINER IV
... a typical PROJECT ENGINEEER is about 28 years old, has completed two or
three design assignments, and this is the first firm he's worked for. He works in
an Engineering Department which has about 100 personnel. He is responsible for
all facets of a development. He will have direct responsibility over two to five other
engineers, and from five to ten technicians, he will be responsible for other func-
tions related to design such as reliability, design drafting, prototype construction,
documentation and manuals. On smaller programs he will be indirectly responsible
for the fabrication, checkout, environmental testing and delivery of all production
units. His administrative tasks will include planning, scheduling, performing merit
reviews on the personnel assigned to him. He will have to coordinate with Con-
tracts Personnel the basic contract, changes in scope and all fiscal project re-
porting. With Marketing he will have to cooperate in selling additional business
to the same and other customers. This will require that he generate technical
proposals, perform cost estimates and make presentations to management so they
can determine if further use can be made of this development.
DATA BUFFER MEMORY...
This tiny memory was approximately 6 inches square, 1 Inch thick, weighed 21
ounces, operated on less than V* watt of power. It contained 2,640 bits of storage.
Its function was to store the video picture each time the lens was opened, and
then, at the slower rate required by a tape recorder, the information was trans-
ferred to tape for subsequent playback to earth. The picture shown on television
and in print here indicates it worked perfectly.
The task of developing this highly reliable device combined with the problems of
manufacturing it to extreme environmental specifications were Dean's tasks for
over 1% years. Such cases are typical. Every day brings the possibility of a new
request for proposal and the possibility of a new assignment.

EDUCATION
AND
RESEARCH
Edited by
John Bair
RAMO LOOKS AHEAD
The balance of the century will
probably see the gap widen between
rapidly accelerating technological ad-
vance and lagging social progress, one
of the nation's top scientists and en-
gineers said Dr. Simon Ramo, who
served as the Air Force's chief scientist
on the ICBM program, the largest
peacetime defense project ever built,
gave this warning to students at The
University of Michigan Engineering
Convocation. The California research
executive, industrialist and educator
spoke before top U-M engineering
students received their awards, and
just after he received an honorary
Doctor of Engineering degree from
the University.
"We have the means to achieve
many goals," Dr. Ramo said, "but we
cannot yet handle them; we have built
the technology but not the sociology.
Futhermore as we keep proliferating
and improving this technology and
we do not improve our ability to
digest and assimilate it, we grow even
more confused and frustrated." Al-
though we "proceed to convince our-
selves that so much of our problems
are inevitable because of technology,"
he said, "... I do not believe this to
be valid unless we vallidate it with our
current thinking and actions and de-
liberately make our myths come true.
Instead I suggest we re-evaluate many
of our conceptions and misconcep-
tions, that we think in fresh new ways
about the future—and even about the
present."
He suggested that "perhaps the most
harmful myth, and hence the great-
est fear, thwarting social maturation
is that man and his ingenious ma-
chines are competitive." Such mythi
are "producing an acute socialigicaJ
blockage against science," he said.
But, "Man and his machines were
never intended to compete," the
founder of corporations pointed out
"They are partners for the infinite
progress of mankind. They permit the
broad extension of man's intellect to
a level inconceivable without this
partnership, and which we are onlv
primitively approaching today. This
partnership can satisfy society's need;
by expanding the spectrum of job.
professions and personal satisfactions
of the world's populations." He said
examples of this partnership range
from the X-ray, and electro-cardio-
graph to the bulldozer and automatic
information systems.
The vice chairman of TRW, Inc.
said the way to close the gap be
tween technological progress and
social lag is "in our articulation of
the envisioned new- 21st Century civi-
lization" and through education. In
the years ahead our education system
will be decisive in determining
whether the 21st Century is indeed
this anticipated golden era or. ironi-
cally, one of fool's gold."
He called for a "new hybrid profes
sion: the politico-socio-technologist
He will be an individual capable of
terpreting the coming technologi-
cal age," Dr. Ramo said, "of which
our age is the vanguard, an age in
which science, society and government
will be inextricably joined." Thus
he advised the U-M engineering stu-

tury goal. And set it high as you can;
don't limit it by some of the fears
and myths and misconceptions we
have about our world today. I am
optimistic that we can achieve the
kind of society we want our children
to live in. We have the tools to do
it—the technological tools. If we use
them properly and with imagination,
they can lead us into the 'golden
century' which lies just beyond this
troubled one we are now in."
FACULTY TAKES AWARDS
Professor Frank E. Richart, chair-
man of the department of civil engi-
neering at The University of Michi-
gan, has received an award for his
work in helping the Air Force solve a
frost heave problem at a minuteman
missile site. The commander of the
wing, Col. John H. Dacus, wrote Prof.
Richart. "Thanks to your contribu-
tion toward solving our complex 'frost
heave' problem, we are well on the
way toward meeting our delivery
schedule."
The citation accompanying Prof.
Richart's Ballistic Systems Division
Commander's Award notes the U-M
civil engineer "distinguished himself
by outstanding achievement" during
work at Grand Forks Air Force Base.
N. Dak. from April 8 to August 10
last year. "In this capacity. Professor
Richart was instrumental in resolving
one of the most difficult problems en-
countered in the history of site acti
vation," the citation reads. "As a
direct result of his personal efforts,
structures which had been displaced
from their original settings due to
frost heave were finally brought back
within established tolerances. Profes-
sor Richart's outstanding contribu-
tions to the Site Activation Task
Force reflect credit upon himself and
the United States Air Force."
Prof. William S. Housel of The
University of Michigan department
of civil engineering has received the
nation's top award for highway re-
search from the National Research
Board of the National Academy of
Sciences-National Research Council.
Prof. Housel received the Roy W.
Crum Award for Distinguished Serv-
ice in 1965. Presentation of the award
was made at the 45th annual meeting
of the Highway Research Board in
Washington. The board is part of the
NAS-NRC Division of Engineering
and Industrial Research.
As a research consultant to the
Michigan State Highway Department
(now the Michigan Department of
State Highways), Prof. Housel's con-
tributions to the highway field stem
from cooperative research programs
with the University. These have been
supported by industry, grants, federal
funds and the State Highway Depart-
ment. Among the most significant, it
was noted, is a 10-year study of pave-
ment design and performance which
set guidelines for objective evaluation
of pavement roughness. This evalua-
tion, subsequently correlated with
vehicle characteristics and driver or
passenger responses, led to the High-
way Research Board's subjective meas-
ure of riding quality or serviceability.
Although the cooperative pro-
gram has gone largely unpublicized
over the past 33 years, Prof. Housel
noted, it is expected that more atten-
tion will be focused on it as it de-
velops under the new opportunities
presented by the U-M Highway Safety
Institute. The Institute results from
a $10 million dollar gift to the U-M
by two automobile companies and the
Automobile Manufacturers Associa-
tion. Prof. Housel also was cited by
Engineering News-Record magazine
early this year as one of 40 civil engi-
neers who made "achievements of sig-
nificance" during 1965.

In the preface to the Treatise on
Natural Philosophy published in 1879
by Thomson and Tait, one reads:
"Nothing can be more fatal to prog-
ress than a too confident reliance on
mathematical symbols, for the stu-
dent is only too apt to take the
easier course and consider the for-
mula and not the fact as the physi-
cal reality." The physical reality, for
the civil engineer, is some form of
construction; and by his relationship
to construction the civil engineer is
identified. In 1964 this statement is
more pertinent than ever before. We
can be proud of this identification.
The great Italian engineer-archi-
tect, Nervi, states: "Because of its
varied aspects, of its persistence in
time, and of the scientific, techno-
logical, esthetic, and social factors
which influence it, construction may
well be considered the most typical
expression of the creativity of a peo-
ple and the most significant element
in the development of its civilization."
Speaking of Nervi, Mario Salvadori
states that he "combines two oppo-
site frames of mind in one person:
the synthetic, intuitive, artistic ap-
proach together with the analytic,
mathematical, scientific outlook."
Creative intuition
More than four hundred years ago,
which was two hundred years before
the first engineering school was
opened in France, the great dome of
St. Peters was conceived in the mind
of one man, then near the age of
eighty. That man, Michelangelo, died
in 1564, the year that Galileo was
born. But, from his youth, according
to Irving Stone, Michelangelo had
sculptured "from images in his mind.
His eyes and hands knew where every
line, curve, mass must emerge, and
at what depth in the heart of the
stone." Now in his old age he was
creating a domed structure that tow-
ered 335 feet in height, unlike any
other that had been built before.
He knew his material, for he had
quarried it and chiseled it, and to
get larger blocks of it, of greater uni-
formity, he had built roads into in-
accessible regions. He had the power
of intuitive and accurate visualization
raised to its peak and he was able
to make the direct approach in bridg-
ing the gap between conception and
finished construction. He was artist,
engineer, and even construction su-
perintendent for the building of his
dome. Today, in a more complex age,
we cannot rely on intuition alone in
the design of great structures. Never-
theless any really creative structural
engineer or architect must have a
liberal quantity of this same power.
A more modern illustration of the
direct approach is illustrated by the
story told about the Hortonsphere
which gained wide use as a proper
shape for a steel tank used in the
storage of liquids. Mr. Horton filled
a toy balloon with water and placed it
on a table. He said, "Make the tank
that way," and so it was.
Back into reality
Hardy Cross affirmed that an im-
portant duty of teachers was to force
students repeatedly back into the field
of reality and, even more, to teach
them to force themselves back into
reality. He continually jerked his stu-
dents out of the textbook, out of the
theory, back to a consideration of
the real structure. Hardy Cross said
that there was scarcely any absurdity
to which seniors would not agree if
it were presented to them with
enough Greek letters and integral
signs. He went on to say that the
sense of reality seems to decrease
with elaborateness of equipment, and
may finally disappear completeh
from laboratory work.
Good practicing engineers have a
vivid sense of reality. The good en-
gineer keeps in touch with realm
through analysis, tests, sketches
drawings, and specifications. His at-
tention is focused directly on the real
structure with which he is concerned
There is a real danger when new
developments in construction are in-
troduced with the appearance of ad-
vanced design and novel shapes, but
with neither a background of success-
ful usage in prior construction nor
the imaginative foresight that the ex-
perienced engineer gives to every type
of load and structural response that
may be involved in the development
of a new structural form. Such in-
complete engineering is leading to an
increasing number of structural fail-
ures, both during and after construc-
tion.
In an engineering sense, the de-
signer who makes mistakes of this
sort is out of touch with reality; he
would do well to abandon his text-
books—he has had too much of them
He might conceivably re-establish his
relationship with reality by prolonged
contemplation of a tree, designed by
nature to withstand the most violent
storm, flexible where it is frail, in its
leaves and smaller branches, but
growing in strength and never aban-
doning that most important factor-
continuity—first forming a trunk that
is securely rooted in the ground and
capable of supporting the branches
as they grow in size.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


by Bruce G. Johnston
Retarded progress
Paradoxically in an age of science,
a lack of intuitive understanding
may retard new scientific or engi-
neering discoveries. The formula for
the elastic buckling of a hinged col-
umn was developed by Euler in 1744
even before the full development of
the theory of the bent beam. Euler
must have thought very deeply about
the column. Two hundred years later,
after the extension of Euler's work in-
to the inelastic range of material be-
havior, incorrect patterns of thought
were still wedded to the formula
that Euler originally had developed
for elastic buckling. Let me para-
phrase my opening quotation of
Thomson and Tait: "The research
workers in the field of column be-
havior were mistaking the formula
for the column and forgetting to
think about the column itself."
The lack of structural insight also
shows up in the many failures oc-
curring during construction. Even
though a structure may be well de-
signed, if the engineer has not visu-
alized completely the various interme-
diate stages between the time when
the first steel is erected or concrete
placed until the structure has received
its final external clothing of walls,
failure may result. And for every con-
struction failure that occurs, there
must be many "near misses"—cases
in which the structure just managed
to survive until it was safely braced
in the way the final design drawings
indicated.
The changing world of engineering
Up to now I have emphasized the
jjovver and importance of structural
intuition. But we certainly cannot ig-
nore the great value of the mathema-
tical, numerical, and electronic tools
that in an increasingly complex way
have brought aid to our procedures
of structural analysis and design.
These aids to engineering have be-
come essential in a continually chang-
ing world of engineering where new
materials, methods of construction,
structural forms, and methods of fab-
rication are producing both progress
and problems. "How can we make
full use of modern tools and still re-
tain intuitive insight into structural
behavior?" To find the answer or an-
swers to this question should be of
great concern to everyone in engi-
neering education.
The most advanced study of struc-
tural theory can be an aid rather
than a hindrance to structural under-
standing. The differential equations
for shell behavior are not the shell
itself. Yet if we can think in terms of
the geometrical language that the dif-
ferential equations speak, rather than
in terms of abstract logic, our under-
standing of shell behavior will be
deepened. Similarly, the computer
can deepen rather than curtail our
understanding of reality.
At Michigan we have developed
computer programs into which we can
feed the physical properties of ma-
terial in a steel or aluminum alloy
column and we can also feed in the
imperfections such as residual stress
and/or initial curvature that exist in
a real column. Then the computer
prints out the load-deflection history
of the column up and beyond its
maximum capacity. While the com-
puter has the same limitations that
any theory has, involving our own
imperfect understanding of the be-
havior of materials and structures,
there are, aside from efficiency and
speed, some unique advantages. In
the computer input we can control
the simulated imperfections in a way
that would be most difficult in the
actual laboratory.
If we ask for a crooked column
for a laboratory test, it is nearly
impossible to achieve the exact crook-
edness that is desired. But it is a
simple matter to tell the computer
just how crooked the column should
be and, in addition, to simulate the
tests of half a dozen columns in a
few minutes' time with a systematic
increase in crookedness each step of
the way. Most important, those of
us who have been working with this
simulation of reality on the computer
have gained a better understanding of
the column itself.
Tools must remain servants
Much of the above is most true of
civil engineering, where the distinc-
tion between engineering and science
is clear cut. Other branches of engi-
neering, such as electrical and me-
chanical, are identified with product
development and production. These
are branches that broke away from
the civil engineering stem some years
ago. Civil engineering, in keeping
pace with growth, change, and new
knowledge, has at the same time re-
tained the basic character that stems
from its relationship to construction.
Science does provide important tools
for the civil engineer but the tools
must remain his servants. ■

"Drift-along" careers? We don't have them.
You won't find the environment at Sikorsky Aircraft
conducive to inertia. We earned our reputation as a pioneer
and leader in our dynamic, young industry by applying a
lot of mental muscle to a bewildering array of problems.
And being willing to buck the current in order to go places
is an essential engineering attitude with us today.
Are you this kind of young engineer? Willing to wrestle
with new ideas, hard work? Then you should certainly talk
to us about the opportunities for personal progress and
rewarding professional satisfaction offered in our world of

The Sikorsky vehicle of today reflects a startling new tech-
nology . . . the merging of sophisticated electronic systems
with the VTOL airframe to provide new dimensions in
airborne capabilities. These advanced VTOL systems are
fulfilling the broadest demands on their versatility . . . from
space capsule recovery to wide-ranging military and com-
mercial application. As for the future—it's bounded only
by the span of engineering imagination.
THE RIGHT SPOT FOR YOU? We'll have it. You'll be
given tough, responsible assignments within one of our
small, interdependent groups—working on demanding prob-
lems in such areas as aerodynamics • human factors engi-
neering • automatic controls • structures engineering • weight

3. adaptations to change.20
One extremely important application
of this theory which Kohler mentions
is the adjustment of the central ner-
vous system to allow for the growth
of the body. This growth would
affect areas such as the distance be-
tween the eyes and hence binocular
vision, along with the length of the
limbs and muscular co-ordination.
Held modified most of Kohler's ex-
periments to include this variable of
motor-involved vs. nonmotor-involved
adaptation. Goggled subjects were
divided into three groups, those that
were allowed no movement (depriva-
tion), those given passive movement
(the "kitten carousel"), and those
allowed active movement. Tests of
such traits in infants as depth per-
ception on the "visual cliff" and the
amount of motor and sensory co-
ordination confirmed that the actively
moving subjects displayed a much
higher degree of adaptation. This
motor-sensory feedback loop accounts
for an animals own movements chang-
ing what it sees and hears.
An Overall View
In taking the approach of plasticity
in motor-sensory control, this article
presents a relativistic stand. No at-
tempt has been made to deal with the
philosophical implications which this
theory has, viz. whether man is born
with a perceptual "tabula rasa"
(Rousseau), or with certain innate
abilities to perceive such factors as
space and form (Descartes). It ap-
pears that either of these concepts is
entirely compatible to the theory
of motor participation with senses in
perception, as well as the concept of
plasticity in the perceptual norms
(however they are determined). ■

reputation. Malleable can be cast close
to finish shape, thereby reducing or elim-
inating machining operations. What ma-
chining must be done can be accom-
plished quickly because Malleable iron is
the most easily machined of all ferrous
metals of comparable hardness.
One of the first considerations in design-
ing a metal part is its strength to perform
a given function.
In most instances, the second question
is always how to provide the necessary
strength ... at the lowest possible fin-
ished cost. On both counts, Malleable
iron castings offer exceptional advan-
tages. Here is why:
Malleable castings are available in two
general types (ferritic and pearlitic) and
in 9 ASTM grades that range in tensile
strength from 50,000 to 100,000 PSI.
Tensile strength figures represent the
load at which materials fail. Yield strength
and fatigue strength are among the more
important engineering yardsticks.
Yield strength represents the point at
which materials exceed the elastic limit.
Fatigue strength is the greatest stress
which can be sustained when the load is
applied repeatedly. As indicated by the
table below, Malleable has an advantage
over steel in fatigue strength and yield
strength when grades of identical tensile
strength are compared.

department is helping hospital ad-
ministrators achieve. The Industrial
Engineer tan do the economic fact
finding for the hospital, but in the
end it is the hospital's responsibility

The Industrial Engineer's future

Suggestion to Ch.E.s, M.E.s, and other engineers:
The University of Rochester has long com-
mitted itself to the pursuit of academic excel-
lence and long ago attained success in that
quest. Likewise, with a somewhat different
conception of higher education, has the Roch-
ester Institute of Technology earned high re-
gard. The two institutions are quite unrelated
to each other or to us, except that their for-
tunate presence in Rochester provides oppor-
tunity for those who join us with fresh bac-
calaureates to proceed right on course with the
next formal stage of professional or business
preparation. In Kingsport arrangements are
offered by the University of Tennessee Gradu-
ate School and East Tennessee State University.
Two big factors make such plans attractive:
1. Money. It can be a great comfort when supplied regularly by a
prosperous firm well aware that its fate depends on the intelligence
and devotion of the people it can lure into its fold.
2. Direct personal involvement in the realities. The realities en-
countered in a company that leans as heavily as we do on engineer-
ing, science, and scholarship can be nothing but helpful to one
whose motivation toward education is genuine and deep.
There is also a rough side:
You have to drive yourself pretty hard when you work and study
at the same time. This shows you up as a candidate for tough
assignments.

A PREVIEW OF YOUR CAREER AT GENERAL ELECTRIC
Achieving Thrust for Mach 3
When the North American Aviation XB-70 established a mile-
stone by achieving Mach 3 flight, it was powered by six
General Electric J93 jet engines. That flight was the high
point of two decades of G-E leadership in jet power that
began when America's first jet plane was flown in 1942. In
addition to the 30,000-pound thrust J93's, the XB-70 carries a
unique, 240-kva electrical system that supplies all on-board
power needs—designed by G-E engineers. The challenge of
advanced flight propulsion promises even more opportunity
at G.E. GETF39 engines will help the new USAF C-5A fly more
payload than any other aircraft in the world; the Mach 3
GE4/J5 is designed to deliver 50,000-pound thrust for a U.S.
Supersonic Transport (SST). General Electric's involvement
in jet power since the beginning of propellerless flight has
made us one of the world's leading suppliers of these prime
movers. This is typical of the fast-paced technical challenge
you'll find in any of G.E.'s 120 decentralized product opera-
tions. To define your career interest at General Electric,

Young Man!
A modern Jable with
technical overtones.
Once upon a time
there was a young sen-
ior in college named
Jack who couldn't de-
cide about his future.
He wanted to do
something worthwhile
alter graduation.
But there were so
many things to do, it
w as hard to decide. He
could go on to gradu-
ate school, or join the
ctA, or volunteer for
social welfare service, or participate in a protest movement
... or he could enter the business world.
Many of Jack's friends
urged him to steer clear of
big industry.
"There are no challenges
in air-conditioned offices,"
they warned.
And it was a challenge
Jack wanted — the kind of
challenge his forefathers
faced on the frontiers.
T hen he met a Mr.
Greeley.
Mr. Greeley recruited col-
lege students for Westinghouse Electric Corporation. He
was a kindly man to w hom Jack
opened his heart.
Mr. Greeley described to Jack the
exciting things being done by West-
inghouse all over the world. 'Jack was
fascinated and asked many searching
questions about the world's 21st
largest corporation. At the end of an
hour, Mr. Greeley advised Jack:
"Go Westinghouse, Young Man."
Jack did.
The first few weeks were difficult.
There was so much to learn.
Jack was to discover that at Westinghouse, learning was
a way of life, that a career with Westinghouse was one
long process of education and re-education.
Later Jack was permitted to decide which of six big
groups he would like to join.**
Jack selected the Westinghouse
Electric Utility Group.
With the Electric Utility
Group Jack learned about water
processing, about power genera-
tion, about underground dis-
tribution, and many other
things. Jack had not realized
how important to the survival
of modern man is the world of
electric utilities.
It was hard work. Sometimes after a particularly trying
day Jack would get discouraged. Then he'd remember the
warnings of his friends, back at college. And he'd wonder
w hether he had done the right thing.
Then came Jill. Pretty, intelli-
gent, warmhearted Jill. Jack had
met Jill at the drinking fountain
in the Utility Group Water Prov-
ince Department.
Jill was an engineer with West-
inghouse (Editor's Note: Women
are welcome at Westinghouse, an
^^^Jf^k equal opportunity employer).
Although the work became more
and more difficult and the hours
longer. Jack with Jill at his side
persevered.
Then came an assignment to join
a team of Westinghouse engineers
and scientists. The team was being sent to an underdevel-
oped nation in a faraway land to help rebuild a large
coastal city.
Jack and Jill's assignment: Help build a power plant
that would use nuclear fuel. (Nuclear fuel lasts longer
than coal or oil. And it's cleaner.) Energy from the nuclear
plant was used to change salt water from the nearby sea
into fresh water that the poor people of this country could
use as drinking water.
Working late one evening on the job site, Jack caught
someone in the act of salxnaging , ^
the construction of an extra-high-
voltage distribution system. This
system would bring power from the;
nuclear plant hundreds of miles'
into the inland areas of the country. »
After a dramatic chase through j
the winding streets of the city, a
chase in which the international
police and cia participated. Jack captured the subver-
sive agent. A grateful nation presented him with its high-
est award.
Finally, the project was completed. It was hard work but
it was good work. Thanks to the Westinghouse team, mil-
lions of people would live better.
The citizens of the country were grateful. They wanted
Jack and Jill and the others to stay
. . . offered them more than their
present salaries as an inducement
. . . but Westinghouse fringe bene-
fits more than olfset this offer.
At the airport, where a sad but
affectionate crowd of citizens
gathered to see them off, Jack
turned to Jill and asked:
"Will you marry me?"
Jill smiled and said: "I will if
you promise to let me join you on
other equally important turnkey
projects that Westinghouse is co-

What can you,
as an engineer,
expect to find
at Mead?
We like to call it an "environment for
growth."
You see, at The Mead Corporation, there are
opportunities of all kinds for engineers of
all kinds ... scientists, chemists, civil,
electrical, mechanical, industrial and
chemical engineers, as well as pulp and
paper technologists. In fact, with a little
work and perseverance, they're the kind of
openings that can take a man (or woman)
into product and process development,
process control and research, plant and
project engineering, production management
or any place else he's equipped to go.
If you're this kind of graduate—one who
jumps at the uncommon challenge, who
measures himself by his own achievements,
and wants a little bit more than he's seen
until now — we probably have a spot you
can grow in. Write to the Employment
Supervisor, The Mead Corporation,
Chillicothe, Ohio, and let him tell you more.

Now tiny glass devices can do what complex electromechani-
cal systems can't. Control the power of a locomotive without
the use of moving parts. And without breakdowns due to short
circuits, wear, heat deterioration and shock. Ask New York
Central.
These devices channel a small volume of fluid (air, gas or
liquid) under low pressure so that it activates a much more
powerful jet of fluid. This in turn helps control the massive
equipment which regulates the locomotive's speed and power.
Fluid devices are finding increasing use as machine and
process controls and in computer logic sections. Corning pro-
duces fluidic devices from its unique FOTOCERAM® photo-
sensitive glass-ceramic, which allows extremely accurate chem-
ical machining.
Today, glass can be made six times stronger than steel. Or as
soft as silk. It can bend or not bend. Break or not break. Melt
or not melt. It can be molded, cast, machined, drawn and
pressed. It possesses more capabilities than any other material.
For solutions to their materials problems, industry and gov-
ernment are coming to Corning. Because Corning is the glass-
master. It's a broad, international company, with one of the
most daring, expert and imaginative research and engineering
staffs in the world. Plus a marketing principle that commits
them to developing products only in areas where a need exists
and no product does.

PROGRAMMING A LIFE
It seems that men have always tended to associate human
qualities with computers. For example, of the related words
to "computer" in lioget's Thesaurus, "electric brain", "thinking
machine", and "electronic mastermind" seem to imply that
computers are intelligent, human-like machines. Even machine
names like Audrey (Automatic Digit Recognizer), ERMA
(Electronic Recording Machine), and IDA (Integro-Differ-
ential Analyzer) have been cleverly devised to be shortened
to human sounding names. Science fiction writers have long
intrigued us with stories of thinking machines so intelligent
that they threatened to take-over the world. But whether or
not there is danger in making machines that act human,
there seems a more than real danger in our age of making
one's human life imitate a machine.
Compuiers are big hunks of machinery composed of
hundreds of thousands of tiny parts; integrated circuits so
tiny that they can fit on the head of a pin. With the Hick of
a switch these whirring, clicking masses of twinkling lights
and moving parts can store data, analyze problems, and
ring out answers hundreds of times faster than humans
themselves can. With the help of computers, months* worth ol
data analysis can be shortened to minutes, ten or fifteen
different problems can be solved in less time than it takes the
bells of Burton Tower to announce the noon hour. But,
for all their fantastic potential and ability to outdo men
with their speed, computers can only "think" along the
immediate problem at hand. They must be programmed,
told what to do and how to react. By feeding them a
complete and unambiguous set of codified instructions,
we can teach them to find the stress on a beam, the molecular
formula of a compound, the trajectory of a space capsule.
How often do we, as engineers, notice ourselves being
programmed like computers? We move from class to class
learning the formula for this and the method of solving for that.
We are sent home with our slide rules and numlier problems,
to work on our memory devices to keep these complete
and unambiguous sets of instructions in our mind. When exam
time comes, we are fed data which we are to analyze and
plug into our formulas so we can ring out the correct answers.
We are turned on when the answer to a number problem is
needed, turned off when we've given it.
Many engineering school courses fit into this picture.
They teach us to learn formulas, plug in data, and spit out
answers. Why not, since with these simple sets of unambiguous
formulas we can build bridges, orbit satellites, or schedule the
production of nine million automobiles. No one can
seriously doubt that all of these courses are essential
to our future as engineers. Yet the clanger is in letting these
methods of study drive us into ruts, in letting them become
our sole purpose for being here.
Let us now differentiate between sole purpose and prime
purpose for being on the Michigan campus. Our first purpose,
or prime purpose, is to become engineers; that is what
brought us to college. But this isn't our sole or only purpose.
We must seek more than this. A good engineer must also
be a good salesman. He must be able to sell himself as well
as his ideas. Therefore he must purposely seek self-confidence
In selling himself to others, any engineer finds that he must
spend a good share of his time convincing administrators and
others who are not themselves engineers. Therefore, another
purpose for being here could be to receive in some limited
way a varied enough background so as not to be tied
to technical topics when not in the presence of other engineer
Since we constantly rub up against other people and wish
to make a good impression, if even just on those who supenise


us, we must make it our purpose to l&gt;e able to fit into a group.
Engineers find themselves in the midst of an urban-oriented
society, in cities that engineers built. A workable knowledge
of groups and what is presently "in" and what is "out," is of
extreme help in understanding those around us.
Whether we do or say the "in" thing, or choose to keep
a tighter hold on our identity by doing or saying something
more original, in our dealings with others we must learn in
which ways they will react to what we do. Any engineering
student who hasn't found out that the Mamas and the Papas
are "in" and white socks, flat-top hair-cuts, and slide rules
attached to belts are "out," is missing something vital to his
future. By learning that he will be scorned by a good share of
students around him if he attaches his slide rule to his belt,
he may choose to carry it with his books instead.
But regardless of whether he chooses to switch or not,
he must know and understand what those around him think,
or someday throw up his hands in confusion when none
of his ideas seem to be getting across.
The prime purpose, that of studying engineering, is the
reason we came to college. Because we have secondary purposes,
because we seek more than learning formulas, plugging
in data, and spitting out answers, we made Michigan
our choice of colleges.
By making the prime purpose our sole purpose for being
on campus, we miss the rest of what the Michigan campus
offers us. Too many of us narrow ourselves to just the
simple rut of learning formulas, plugging in data, and
.spitting out answers. We leave class, march straight home
to our dorms or apartments, and stay there until it is time
to roll out of our beds and into class again the next morning.
For this kind of an education, we don't need Michigan.
A good night-school would give us the same results.
Oreat talent from around the world sits at our doorsteps daily,
and all we need to do is step outside our doors to find
and enjoy it. For the secondary purpose of having a varied
background we have the Professional Theatre Program,
the concert series at Hill Auditorium, Canterbury House,
Cinema Guild, lectures at Rackham, and an infinite variety of
activities. For building our confidence and leadership
abilities we have student groups; fraternities and clubs,
the Technic, the Ensian, the Daily, University Activities Center,
Soph Show, Musket, Winter Weekend, Homecoming, and
lots more. For learning group tactics and how to get
along with others we have only to be observant.
I f not to join some of the groups and clubs, all we have to do
is observe at restaurants, movies, even classrooms, and
notice what is being said and done by those who lead,
for whether we wish to follow or not, we must understand
why others do.
By staying in the rut of a classroom to home to classroom path,
we close the doors to a successful later life.
We become introverted, quiet machines that simply whir
and hum and spit out information when others need it.
When they finish, they turn us off and shove us in the
corner until they need us again. By not being afraid of
ambiguities, of opinions, of emotions, of more than one right
answer, of diversity, of leadership, or of group dynamics,
we can program more into our life than anyone would
dare try stuffing into a computer. We can become walking,
talking, thinking human beings, rather than machines
which are controlled by others. We can sell what we design,
put action into our ideas. We can converse easily with others,
make new friends, become leaders as well as engineers.
And all it takes to begin is a couple of drastic measures,
like burning those white socks and turning olf that television.
By imitating an I.B.M. 7090, we may be used for now and
cast aside later for a system 360. By seeking more than
learning formulas, plugging in data, and spitting out answers,
we can direct and control both ourselves and computers, and
live a (idler, broader life. C O C

The term time study, in itself, does
not convey sufficient meaning for one
to grasp an understanding of what a
time study actually is. The image of
an office clock watcher may be the
first thought of one who is uninform-
ed. Actually, what is implied by the
term is the study of how time is
allotted to the performance of a task
by a man in carrying out an operation
on a piece of stock.
In order for a specific amount of
time to be allotted to a task, the task
in itself must have a definite begin-
ning and end. For purposes of this
report a task shall be the unit of work
and therefore indivisible into further
tasks.
The first problem in evaluating the
allotment of time to a task or group of
tasks is the task description. It must
be understood that a series of tasks
combine to result in an operation be-
ing performed. The individual task or
group of tasks of sufficient length to
permit stopwatch measurement com-
prise an element of the total opera-
tion. For time study purposes the total
operation is described by an elemental
breakdown rather than by a break-
down by tasks since an individual
task may be so short so as to be in-
conducive to stopwatch measurement.
The ideal length for an element is
about .12 minutes. For time studies
time is not recorded in seconds, but in
hundredths of a minute to permit easy
calculation. The elemental descrip-
tion is the foundation upon which
rests the quality of the time study.
In order to insure this quality it is
necessary that certain practices and
vocabulary be followed in the descrip-
tion. At Chevrolet Gear and Axle a
set of terms have been established to
bring standardization and clarity to
the elemental description.
by
Vocabulary for Elemental Description
ACT — term given to a grouping of move-
ments which can be used to describe man-
ual activity for job study.
GET — the act consisting of the muscular
movements required to move an object and
gain control of that object so that it can be
moved in a straight motion path to its
next destination.
PLACE —the act consisting of the muscular
movements required to move an object into
a definite position and release or hold it
there.
DISPOSE — the act consisting of the muscu-
lar movements required to move an object
in a given direction and release it without
reference to its final position.
PROCESS—the application of a mechanical,
chemical or other means which changes the
size, shape or condition of an object.
WAIT—the suspension of directed activity
on the part of the operator for justified or
unjustified reasons.
HOLD — keeping an object in a definite
position relative to another object so that
the holding member does not perform any
movements.
Perhaps the best way to emphasize
the importance of the use of these
specifically defined terms is by ex-
ample. If one were to describe the
starting of a machine the description
might read as follows:
WRONG-ACTIVATE MACHINE BY
PUSHING BUTTONS.
CORRECT-GET AND PLACE PUSH
BUTTONS AT EYE LEVEL ON PRESS
R&amp;LH TO BEGIN PROCESS.
The correct description answers
many questions which might be posed
by a person unfamiliar with the oper-
ation. First, a precise task breakdown
is achieved by use of a specific choice
of words. GET AND PLACE PUSH
BUTTONS is an exact description of
the movement for pushing the but-
where the buttons are located, the ma-
tons.
Second, the correct description tells
James Myers
chine is given a descriptive name and
it is indicated that both hands were
necessary. Finally, the use of the word
PROCESS instead of activate indicates
sj)ecifically that the press is perform-
ing an operation on a part, not just
idling. Other comparative example-^
of description would be;
WRONG-THROW STEERING KNUCKLE
DOWN CHUTE.
CORRECT - DISPOSE STEERING
KNUCKLE TO CHUTE.
WRONG-STAND AROUND WHILE MA
CHINE IS RUNNING.
CORRECT-WAIT FOR PROCESS.
The exactness and clarity of the ele-
mental description cannot be empha-
sized enough. Not only is it of benefit
to the time study man himself in beins;
able to explain the operation in detail
to someone else, but it is also of bene-
fit to another time study man who may
be reviewing the operation in the fu-
ture.
Descriptions can be made as de-
tailed and involved as is applicable to
a given situation. In the automotive
industry where all parts are of a rela-
tively large size it is sufficient to de-
scribe movements in terms of right
and left hands, and distances in feet.
However, in other cases it may be nec-
essary to describe a task as detailed
;is individual finger movements.
It should be indicated at this point
that more is involved in a time stud\
than just the division of time. A meth-
ods analysis is also involved and a
good time study man should never
cease looking for a better method with
which to do the job and then recom-
mend it to the foreman.
Once a time study man has an un-
derstanding of the art of preparing an
elemental description he is reach to
time an operation in the plant itself.
The first thing the time study man
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


charge of the job he wants to study.
This is done for self-protection more
than anything else, since it is a waste
of effort to time a job where there are
an unusual amount of mechanical
problems, there are labor difficulties or
the man is not an average operator.
The last of these reasons is by far the
most important. A time study shoidd
reflect what the average man can do,
not what the exceptional or la/y man
can do. The importance of this should
not be overlooked. Also in taking a
study, conversation with the operator
shoidd be avoided since this tends to
prejudice lxith the time study man
and the operator.
After consulting the foreman it is
necessary to observe the job being
timed to establish an elemental break-
down of the tasks and to be sure that
the operator is performing normally
and is not affected by the presence
of the time study man. It is not neces-
sary to establish a detailed elemental
description immediately, but it is nec-
essary to fix in one's mind and indi-
cate in abbreviated form at which
point of the operation the watches are
to be read. This point is called a read-
point and is at the end of an element.
The most difficult part of actually
timing the operation is developing the
eye coordination between watching
the read-points and writing the times
on the time study form. This coordi-
nation takes about two weeks to de-
velop. Even when facility has been
gained, taking practice readings is
advisable for each new time study to
firmly fix in the time study man's
mind where the read-points of the
ojieration are, to determine that they
are satisfactory for study and to assure
smooth eye coordination once the
study is underway.
Today in industry, there are two
basic watch systems for time study an-
alysis; the one watch or continuous
method and the four watch method.
Chevrolet Gear and Axle has recently
adopted the four watch method. The
one watch method consists of taking
watch readings from one watch only.
At each read-point the time study man
records the overall elapsed time and
then later determines the elemental
times by subtracting one read-point
from the next. The system is relatively
inefficient when compared to the four
watch system which consists of three
stop watches arranged to give consecu-
tive elemental times by squeezing a
bar and a fourth stop watch to give
the overall elapsed time of the study.
This method gives much more accu-
rate elemental times than the one
watch method since the time study
man can read and record the time of
the watch he has just stopped while
one of the other two watches continues
to record the next element.
The ideal time study is one in which
elements are recorded and the time
study is taken without a break in se-
quence or having to start the study
again in the middle. This ideal is sel-
dom realized since an operator often
performs tasks which are necessary or
unnecessary to the operation, but
which occur irregularly or out of ele-
mental sequence. These tasks are
called irregular elements and because
they are part of an operators actions
during a study they must be recorded
on the time study form. The way this
is done is to earmark the element be-
fore which the irregular element has
occurred and record the earmark sym-
bol, its length of duration and a brief
description under the heading "Ir-
regular Elements." An irregular ele-
ment may also be earmarked to show
that another irregular element follows
it immediately. When an irregular
element is completed the time study
man returns to recording regular ele-
mental time as usual. If an irregular
element occurs during a regular ele-
ment and the two cannot be segre-
gated it is necessary to earmark the
regular element in the upper right
hand corner of the box and indicate
in the "Remarks" column what oc-
curred. It is important that this be
done carefully to show how every
moment of time was used during the
duration of the study since irregular
elements must be scrutinized to deter-
mine whether or not they are essential
to the performance of the operation.
If they are not essential to the opera-
tion they will not be allowed in the
final calculations of the standard
hour per piece.
The earmarking of irregular ele-
ments should be done so as to convey
as much meaning as possible. The fol-
lowing examples should illustrate the
idea.
WH — wipe hands
S — smokes
MA—machine adjustment
MP — mark piece
RB— remove burrs
The theory of accounting for all
the time during the duration of a
study can often breakdown when the
complexity of the irregular elements
becomes unreasonable. An operator
can find a myriad of things to do while
]&gt;erforming the simple element of
walking from one machine to the next.
In such cases it may be necessary to
develop tables of standard data. In
order to do this each element neces-
sary to the operation must be studied
separately and an average time ar-
rived at. The separate elements are
then combined to accurately show
how the operation should be run un-
der ideal conditions and what the
average time for the operation should
be. Developing a time study by using
standard data should be avoided un-
less absolutely necessary since it in-
volves a judgement on the part of the
time study man as to what elements
are necessary to the operation and

When the job of timing an opera-
tion is finished, the time study man
can return to his desk to complete his
calculations. His first job is to deter-
mine which individual elemental
times he is going to allow in the cal-
culation of an average elemental time
for an element. Those times which are
not allowed are those which contain
an irregular element in the middle of
a regular element. The inclusion of
the extra task in the element causes
the time to be not representative and
therefore would affect the average if
allowed to remain. It is important to
note that the allowed average time
should be an average time for the per-
formance of only those tasks included
in the detailed elemental description
and should represent no extraneous
tasks.
Once the unallowed elements have
been determined and circled in red
the actual total is calculated. This
is the sum of all allowed and unal-
lowed limes under an elemental head-
ing. The elemental totals are then
summed with the time for the irregu-
lar elements and compared to the
overall time as recorded from the over-
all watch. A gross discrepancy in the

two times would indicate that a miv
take was made in taking the study
and that it should be taken again. Thr
next figure to calculate is the .AL-
LOWED TOTAL which is the sum
of all times under an elemental head
ing minus those elemental times which
are not allowed. This figure is then di-
vided by the number of elemental
times, which one has chosen to allow
under a given element, to arrive at the
ALLOWED AVERAGE TIME for
that element.
Next the time study man must set
up a detailed description of each ele-
ment using the procedure previously
outlined and record next to it the al-
lowed average for that element. Under
the heading ELEMENTAL DE-
SCRIPTION are also recorded the
time and description of those irregu
lar elements which are necessary to
the operation, but which occur less
than once j&gt;er cycle and at least once
per hour. This information can be ob-
tained from studying the irregular
elements observed during the stud\
and from conversation with the fore-
man. The time recorded under AL-
LOWED TIME column is the total
time of the irregular elements pro
rated over one piece.
EXAMPLE: Clear chips from drilling pht
form, .60 min. once every "» pieces.
Allowed time per piece: .GO min. -4- 5 pes.
= .12 min. per pc.
The allowed times for all the ele-
ments of a cycle are then totaled to
arrive at an ALLOWED AVERAGE
CYCLE TIME PER PIECE.
The next item to be considered in
calculating the STANDARD HOI R
PER PIECE is those irregular ele-
ments which occur less than once an
hour and at least once per shift. Ir-
regular elements of this type are called
SHIFT ALLOWANCES and accord
ing to the General Motors Work Stan-
dards Practice and Procedure manual
are divided into seven categories:
1— Tool changes and adjustments—time al
lowed for changing grinding wheels, sharp-
ening tools, etc.
2— Slockhandling—time allowed for handlius
stock or stock containers such as s'Jps.

5—Servicing equipment—time allowed fi&gt;*
adjustment or repairs done to a machine
4— Joh preparation and cleanup—time allovn'
for cleanup or arrangement of the kki

AVCS for NIMBUS and TIROS
NIMBUS—the research and devel-
opment spacecraft in the weather
satellite program of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion—utilized an Advanced Vidicon
Camera Subsystem (AVCS) which
represented a significant advance in
space television cameras.
This AVCS, designed and built by
RCA for the NASA Goddard Space
Flight Center, comprised three sepa-
rate one-inch vidicon camera tubes,
each with a lens and electronics
assembly. The cameras provided a
picture resolution of 800 TV lines
equivalent to an earth resolution of
one-half mile for a 500-mile altitude.
The dynamic range of AVCS was 0.4
to 0.004 foot-candle-seconds exclusive
of an automatic iris control which
could vary the light to the faceplate
over a range of a factor of 16. The
center camera looked straight down
at the earth and the right and left
cameras were canted to look 35-de-
grees away from the vertical axis.
Each set of three pictures then formed
a rectangular presentation of the earth
about 1300 miles across (east to west)
and 400 miles along (south to north)
the orbit path.
During each orbital path over the sun-
lit side of the earth, the Nimbus AVCS
took a total of 32 of these composite
pictures. This set of pictures provided
complete pole-to-pole meteorological
coverage of the 1300-mile wide swath,
with the rotation of the earth causing
the swath to move to an adjacent,
overlapping area during the next orbit.
In this way, complete earth coverage
was obtained each day.
The AVCS TV system was used on the
second NIMBUS satellite also, and,
in addition, with a slightly different
configuration, on the TIROS Opera-
tional System (TOS) satellites.
The RCA TOS satellites are designed
to provide similar full global weather
coverage every day from a sun-syn-
chronous, near-polar orbit. Each sat-
ellite will be oriented with its spin axis
perpendicular to the orbit plane. In
this position the satellite will be like
a wheel rolling in the orbit path. Thus,
AVCS continues to contribute to this
nation's progress toward improved
weather analysis and forecasting.

OF
STUDENT FACULTY
INTERACTION
edited by
Richard G. Donnelly
A seminar concerned with the broad
question of student-faculty interaction
was conducted near the end of last
semester by Michigan's chapter of the
Tau Beta Pi Association. The impetus
for this discussion was twofold: First,
the members of the Tan Beta Pi Gam-
ma Chapter were interested in being
of service to the college and to the
students of the college in some way.
They felt that they could assist in the
solution of some of the problems faced
by the college by encouraging discus-
sion of these problems in face-to-face
confrontation between faculty and
students. The second stimulus to the
discussion was the interest of Dean
Gordon J. Van Wylen in the relations
between the faculty and administra-
tion on the one hand and the stu-
dents of the college on the other. In
an interview published in the Technic
of October, 1965, Dean Van Wylen
popularized the term which was later
to become the basis for this seminar:
student-faculty interaction.
The discussion panel consisted of
Dean Van Wylen, Professor H. W.
P'arris, Chairman of the Electrical
Engineering Department, Professor
A. G. Hansen, then Chairman of the
Mechanical Engineering Department
(now Dean at the Georgia Institute of
Technology), and Professor W. C.
Nelson, Chairman of the Aerospace
Engineering Department. The au-
dience was made up of last semester's
Tau Beta Pi pledge class, many of the
chapter's active members, and faculty
representatives from most of the de-
partments of the college. Richard G.
Donnelly, past president of the Tau
Beta Pi chapter moderated the dis-
cussion.
In the interest of expanding tin-
possible influence of a discussion of
this sort, the Technic is here reprint-
ing excerpts from the seminar. For the
most part the text is direct quotes.
Some paraphrasing was necessary in
the interest of clarity and conciseness,
however.
MODERATOR, RICHARD G.
DONNELLY: Dean Van Wylen has
popularized the term "student-facuh\
interaction" for many of us in the
college. So I would like to ask him to
begin the discussion this evening b\
denning student-faculty interaction.
PANEL MEMBER, DEAN GOR-
DON J. VAN WYLEN: We all recog
nize that student-faculty interaction
occurs everyday. Rut interaction im-
plies that there is a two-way com-
munication. All too often in a uni-
versity environment the way of the
loop is closed. The communication is
one way during the class session and
20


We all recognize that this is rather
unsatisfactory for effective communi-
cation.
We all recognize also that there is
a good ileal of concern and interest
for student involvement in the affairs
of the university: in the selection of
a new President, in the selection of a
new dean. Student-faculty interaction,
then, implies not only better inter-
action between the student and his
professor as far as a given class is
concerned, or as far as a research
project is concerned, but we're also
talking about such things as:
1— How ran a student have some input as
to what he thinks about the curriculum
in his particular department, or
2— What does the student think about
a particular course, or
3— What docs he think about a particular
professor, or, finally.
1— How do wc get some input from the
students as regards the program of the
college as a whole?
Furthermore, we're also thinking
about the broader picture of how
students can make their opinions
known on the broader questions of
curriculum, course evaluation, faculty
effectiveness, and finally the policies
of the college as a whole.
DONNELLY: We would like now to
ask the other members of our panel
from their points of view as depart-
ment chairmen, if student-faculty
interaction of the type defined by
Dean Van VVylen is a desirable thing.
PANEL MEMBER, PROFESSOR
ARTHUR G. HANSEN: 1 would
certainly support the Dean's point
about the communication being two-
way. From strictly the faculty point
of view, we're interested in this in-
teraction as feedback. We're interested
in serving you best as far as the edu-
cational process is concerned. From
this point of view, we need to know
how the program is coming across,
how you react to it. As a whole we
need to know what the school en-
vironment is like.
PANEL MEMBER, PROFESSOR
WILBUR C. NELSON: I like to
think of interaction as something in-
volving communication and response.
In that sense, I think most of the
audience will agree, they are going to
spend the rest of their lives as en-
gineers in the "communication and
response field." The biggest problem
we have in the space program today
is not a technical problem. It is an
interaction problem, a communication
problem.
Obviously interactions will occur
not only after you leave here in
industry. They will occur in your
family life. So, I'd like to suggest we're
dealing with one of the most funda-
mental problems in nature and one
of the most fundamental engineering
problems. Thus, interaction is not
only a desirable thing. It is an ab-
solutely essential thing. Those of us
who fail in our engineering work, do
fail in fact in this interaction process.
PANEL MEMBER, PROFESSOR
HANSFORD W. FARRIS This
sounds a little bit in the category of
"motherhood" and "the flag." We
have interaction every day, and there
are certain institutions which make
it possible to carry it out at other
times than the sch(*&gt;l year. I'm quite
ready to endorse the idea that this
is a desirable thing. But I'd like to
pose a question regarding what we're
really after. Are we after this in the
large, in group activity; i.e. moving
the masses—the faculty and the stu-
dents—and mixing them together? Or
are we after something that means a
great deal more to the individual
with regard to say his professional
growth while he is an undergraduate
student. I think if the interaction
doesn't happen on a personal basis—
where the individual student gains
something and the individual profes-
sor gains something—I don't think it
really has happened.
You are synthesizing the basis for
your career throughout the four year
undergraduate period. One of the
major opportunities for an input to
this synthesis mechanism is getting to
know the faculty. This takes effort on
the part of the faculty member, who
is already burdened with two prime
aspects of his job, teaching and re-
search. He neglects, perhaps, a third
aspect: confrontation with the stu-
dent. On the other hand, student
effort is required to bring this con-
frontation about. As an important
part of the synthesis mechanism, this
confrontation is a desirable thing.
DONNELLY: The panel seems to be
unanimous in agreeing that student-
faculty interaction is a desirable thing.
If this is true, then we would be
interested in knowing in what spe-
cific ways students and faculty do
interact in the various departments
and on the college level.
PROF. HANSEN: First of all, we
should define the possible kinds of
interaction that we might have. I have
selected three. First, we have what I
would call a policy interaction where
students have a voice to some extent
in shaping policy. Second is a social
interaction in which the students meet
with the faculty to merely improve
relationships. And third something I
would call program critique and feed-
back.
Within our department we have
some contribution in all three. First
of all, as far as policy interaction is
concerned, we do not have anything
on the undergraduate level, but we do
have something on the graduate scale.
We have a graduate student council
which meets with members of our
graduate committee and represents the
graduate student. In the area of social
interaction, we have the various stu-
dent groups such as the ASME which
meets for noon luncheon every week.
We have in the fall an informal
graduate picnic to which all graduate
students are invited. Finally, in the
area of program critique and feedback,
I would think of the course evalua-
tions at the end of the term which
the professors receive.
We are about to try something new
in our departmental newsletter. We
will have a letter-to-the-editor type
column in which some of the ideas
you might have will be printed for all
to see. Lastly, we encourage such
things as open houses on the part of
the faculty, where you can come to
the house to talk to the professor.
This is a form of social interaction,
but also allows feedback from the stu-
dent on his opinion of the professor's
course.
DONNELLY: Professor Hansen, do
you feel these opportunities as they
exist today are adequate?
PROF. HANSEN: I would say that
they would be at least a fairly good
start on the graduate scale, but I think
more needs lo be done on the under-
graduate level at the present time.
DONNELLY: Professor Nelson, will
you mention some of the opportuni-
ties for student-faculty interaction in
your department?
PROF. NELSON: I'll trv to pick up
and perhaps add to some of the areas
Professor Hansen has mentioned
which are common perhaps to all the
departments. Initially, an interaction
OCTOBER 1966

street, and so we're talking about
techniques for getting this thing to
work two ways. We know that you
men are busy, and we're busy, so we
somehow have to clear up enough
time to have this interaction take
place. As a generality, we professors
see both ends of the scale. We talk
to students with some very bad prob-
lems and we get some outstanding stu-
dents who need help in getting some
advanced fellowship somewhere. But
we tend to miss the middle.
The opportunities which Professor
Hansen has mentioned, which are
roughly similar in our department,
are there but we are not working hard
enough at it. We do have in both the
undergraduate and graduate levels
an awareness and resjionsiveness on
the part of the staff. That is, they are
usually available not only at certain
stated hours but during some unstated
hours. We do have a weekly coffee
hour that is fairly well attended. We
have recently had meetings between
one ad hoc group of students and the
facidty which has resulted in what
we call an "early course comment
sheet,' which is being distributed now.
So, I would say the opportunities are
adequate, but they require a lot more
work on the part of all of us.
PROF. FARRIS: To run down the op-
ixwtunities available for interaction,
there are the obvious ones: the stu-
dent organizations both honorary and
professional. The IEEE meets regu-
larly with a large member of stu-
dents which often takes the form of
a platform presentation. I would not
say this represents an adequate op-
portunity for interaction of the type
we're talking about here. Another op-
portunity is available in the critiques
of professors. This interaction is a
closed type of thing, however, because
it is between one group of students
and one faculty member. One type of
interaction which I think would af-
fect both the broad policy and the
nature of the instruction would be
some mechanism for the adequate
assessment of teaching. We largely
depend upon a grass-roots, grapevine-
type mechanism to gather this infor-
mation. In general, I do not think
that the arrangements we have—at
least in electrical engineering—are
adequate for student-faculty interac-
tion of the type which I feel is mean-
ingful.
DONNELLY: Dean Van Wylen, we
would like you to mention some of
the opportunities for interaction
available on the college level—between
the students and the administration.
DEAN VAN WYLEN: I'm afraid
there is not a great deal to talk about
in this particular regard. The most
effective organization we have for
th:s purpose is the engineering coun-
cil. This has been a fairly effective
group this year. I have had indirect
communication with council through
its adviser. Dean Hellwarth meets
with the council regularly. I think
there is a certain role for the council
in tentis of the overall concerns of the
students, for example, the effectiveness
of the library, the placement service,
etc. There are other college-wide ac-
tivities which provide for a l'mited
amount of interaction: the Michigan
Technic, the honors council, Tau
Beta Pi, etc.
There is essentially nothing on the
college-wide level as far as graduates
are concerned; there are these other
opportunities at primarily the under-
graduate level. I'm inclined to think,
however, that the real effectivenevs of
student-faculty interaction lies at the
department level rather than at the
college level. The real significant in-
put can occur at the department. Gen-
erally I do not really feel that the op-
portunities for interac tion on the col-
lege level are adecpiate at the present
time. I would be happy to have your
opinions on the subject.
DONNELLY: The panel seems to
agree that interaction at the under-
graduate level is not adequate. But
our panel has noted that interaction
is a fundamental problem of life: that
it is a difficult problem; that it is a
two-way street requiring active partici-
pation of both faculty and students.
Dean Van Wylen believes that the
most effective interaction can take
place below the college level, at the
department level. I would now like to
ask for opinions from the floor. As
students, do you feel that the oppor-
tunities for your interaction with
faculty are adecpiate? Name some of
the opportunities available to you.
ALBERT R. FILLION: I agree with
what has been said so far in that I feel
the opportunities for student-faculty
interaction have not been adequate.
However, I think that we need to
clarify just what we want this inter-
action to be from the student point of
view. Of the three categories men-
tioned by Professor Hansen, I do not
feel that the student should have that
much to do with policy making. Pro-
gram critique and feedback, also. U
part of the administrator's job. The
third point—social interaction—is the
real way to get to the student and to
get to the problem. I do not think you
are really going to get down to what
the student feels about his courses,
his professors, what he feels about the
college as a whole and what he feels
about his engineering department in
particular, unless the professors get
to know the students on a personal or
social basis.
When I have the opportunity to
speak to one of my instructors, it us-
usually does something for my espnt
de corps and it increases my interest
and enthusiasm for the subject. I
think this is a serious lacking in mv
education—the fact that there really
isn't any esprit de corps for the col-
lege or for my department, because
there is this lack of a social, personal
relationship with the faculty. Instruc-
tor's don't appreciate your just knock-
ing on their door and saying, "I
thought I'd like to come in and chat
for awhile." The first thing that
should be improved upon is the social
communication between the faculty
and the students.
CHARLES KOSSACK: 1 agree in
part. However, I think the social in-
teraction is difficult to attain, be-
cause of our age differences, because
of pressure on faculty to publish, to
be good teachers, to do research. And
because of pressure on students to
"turn in their homework on time."
From my point of view, there are bet-
ter ways to attain the goals we want.
For example, I would I ke to see an
undergraduate seminar held in each
department. The group could be
made up of three or four facidty mem-
bers and maybe six to eight students
We could sit around a conference
table, drink coffee, and discuss engi-
neering problems—maybe a design
problem, your field of engineering in
general, practically anything. The
students would get to know their
faculty members; the teacher -wouldn't
just be the "man up front."
GERRIT LeGRAND: I'd like to in
terject just a short comment support
ing one form of student-faculty inter-
action we do have. Once a week in the
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


AIAA coffee hour. Several faculty
members and many students attend.
Another opportunity for student-
faculty interaction is our senior de-
sign course in which we have a good
deal of close contact with the faculty.
However, there is a barrier to student-
faculty interaction in that the profes-
sor administers the grade to the stu-
dent—he runs the course—so you're not
on a level with the professor, espe-
cially in the undergraduate program.
Nonetheless, some student-faculty
interaction definitely does exist.
DONNELLY: This is an appropriate
time to recall for ourselves the original
definition of student-faculty interac-
tion that was set up by Dean Van
Wylen. He defined it as an input from
the student to the faculty and also an
output from the faculty to the student
on matters of: 1 curriculum, 2) course
evaluation, 3) teacher evaluation, and
1) discussion of the college as a whole.
The question I have in my mind right
now is whether the social type of inter-
action between students and faculty
will be totally effective in dealing with
all of these matters. It will perhaps
make the classroom situation a little
more informal and a little easier. But
will it help to get at some of these
deeper problems—problems of cur-
riculum and course and professors,
and the problems which the college
as a whole must face?
QUESTION FROM THE FLOOR:
Exactly what bodies exist right now
in which the faculty can get to know
what the student thinks about his pro-
gram of study?
PROFESSOR NELSON: There is at
least one channel that I know- of and
that is every graduating senior is in-
\ ited to write at length, ad nausem,
what he thinks of the college of engi-
neering. That is dittoed up by the
Dean s office and transmitted to all
the departments. It is generally a
pretty thick document. It is limited
only by your capacity to communicate.
As someone indicated, this is probably
a pretty good time to check you out,
because presumably you arc not inter-
ested in whether you're flunking a
course or not. You are interested in
the welfare of the fellows who follow
after you.
PROFESOR HANSEN: I think
there are a few such ways in which
we can get this feedback, and to some
extent I am beginning to think that
perhaps you've been sold a bill of
goods. In this business of your educa-
tion, you are the customers. In spite
of the fact that we sometimes assume
a lofty role, it is you who we as faculty
depend upon. And, therefore, I think
that somewhere there must be a real
attitude that you are concerned, as
customers, in the kind of education
that you receive. Apparently, how-
ever, we have done a very good job
in convincing you that somehow this
usual customer attitude no longer
prevails when it comes to education.
I would like to see good motivation
on your part. Then I think the sort of
groups that you are referring to will
come into being.
JOHN RICHART: Since we are
speaking about the customer-salesman
relationship, I have been concerned
about the dropout rate in engineering.
I have been wondering about the sales-
men perhaps. Do the professors here
really sell engineering as a career at
the beginning of the undergraduate
level? There is really very little stu-
dent-faculty interaction when it is
needed most—in the first years of
study during which freshmen and
sophomores are introduced to some
very difficult subjects. Perhaps some
sort of mandatory office hours could
work effectively as a means to promote
student-faculty interaction, especially
on the freshmen and sophomore level.
Would someone care to comment on
this?
DEAN VAN WYLEN: I think you
have put your finger on one of the
very weak points of the college right
now. We try to give a fair amount of
attention to the freshmen program.
We have the freshmen counselors as
you know, who are certainly available
to students. However, I think that we
could do a great deal more to provide
this sort of interaction at the freshman
level. In fact, I wish I had a better
idea what freshmen think about the
freshman program right now. I think
we could well use a good deal more
input from freshmen and perhaps not
wait until they are seniors for this.
PROFESSOR NELSON: On the other
hand, I would like to point out that
we assign some of our best faculty to
freshman counselling. Freshmen are
required to come in for counseling,
and we do get quite a lot of feedback.
Again, this is a two-way street. You
need to learn to "claw" your way into
professors offices. You will find this
is a very handy tool in later life.
RICHARD D. POMP: I have had a
very distasteful experience with coun-
selling. I think Professor Nelson's
comment gives a little insight into
this problem. He said some of our
best professors are assigned to coun-
selling. I think the key word there is
assigned. When I walk into a counsel-
ling session—I'm not the most percep-
tive fellow in the world—but I get the
idea that this gentleman sitting here
across the table really doesn't want to
be there. This just is a burden on him
because he is a young man on the
faculty and someone has to do it. He
just doesn't have the interest in you
as a person. It is disheartening to
switch counsellors every semester. I
would like one counsellor. He might
learn to hate me. That's all right. As
long as he takes an interest in me.
This is a serious lack of communica-
tion. I think freshmen particularly arc-
very sensitive to this problem.
Another point. I think we could all
take a lesson from the College of Liter-
ature, Science, and the Arts, where
they have a very successful college
steering committee. We would do well
to follow their example and form
some sort of engineering college steer-
ing committee, maybe on the depart-
mental level, maybe on the college
level. This would not only increase
communication with the few faculty
members who would take part in it,
but it would also reflect the interest
of the student body as represented by
these people. For example, there seems
to be a lag in the college in these
changing times in which many engi-
neers are not going into engineering,
but are going management and law
and business. I think this change of
times should be reflected in our cur-
riculum. A steering committee could
accomplish this very successfully.
PROFESSOR JAMES W. DADLEY:
I really think we ought to support the
faculty end of this thing, too. So, I'll
volunteer. I was pleased that eventu-
ally we got around to talking about
counsellors and advisers. I think the
students' remarks on these matters are
very pertinent. It seems to me that
this is probably one of the best places
to begin a kind of rapport. The busi-
ness of having counsellors and the
program adviser shifted around is
an awkward arrangement. We have
recently changed program advisers in
our department. However, the pre-

COLLEGE DF ENGINEERING
Industrial engineering is the design and control of work, in the general sense of purposeful, productive, hu-
man activity in all of its organized forms. Thus, the industrial engineer may be concerned with the work of a
factory, an individual artisan, a machine, or a system that exists in manufacturing, in travel and transporta-
tion, in communication, in the professions, in government, or in the utilization of natural resources.
The industrial engineer must be capable of identifying, describing, and measuring all kinds of work while
specializing with respect to human and machine factors or with respect to organizations (systems) of humans
and machines. His training must, therefore, include substantial laboratory experience in methods of observation
of work and activity, in the sampling of active processes, and in techniques of measurement.
Since many processes involving work are typically the results of many evolutionary modifications, this op-
erating behavior is usually complicated. In recent years it has been realized that all the resources of vocabu-
lary, concept, and analogy of the pure and applied sciences are useful in describing and analyzing industrial
processes: a sales campaign is a study in epidemiology; an organization is a molecule with an associated chem-
istry; a production process is characterizable by tensors. Consequently, the student trained in the physical
sciences and their mathematics will find challenging problems in industrial phenomena. Moreover, processes of
significant scientific interest occur indigenously in industry. Among these are queues, storage systems (inven-
tory), feedback networks (of production or communication centers), and the large class of extremal variational
activities (exemplified in linear programming) in which delibera'e maximization of the rewards of productive
activity, subject to limitations on the resources of production, provides the kinetics of actual histories of work
done in plants, in agriculture, and in other technological production.

Imagine hearing from the Man on the Moon!
You will. And the first American voice that speaks to earth

Each of the 8 major phases of the historic Apollo space mission
which will carry the first American astronauts to the surface of

and exploration ... to earth return—will receive the critically
important support of Motorola electronics equipment.
But back to moon talk. Enroute to the moon—a Motorola Up
Data Link on board the Command Service Module will receive
mission data from earth. When the Apollo astronaut speaks to
earth from the moon, a Motorola transceiver will help send his
voice to us. A small Motorola-designed backpack antenna as-
sociated with the communication system will relay his words to
LM (the Lunar Module that lands the astronauts on the moon),
where the transceiver assists in relaying them on to earth.
A Motorola transponder will also help provide television, voice,
and digital communications ... across 238,857 miles.
Actually—ever since the first Mercury space flight in 1961,
sophisticated Motorola electronics have played a vital role in
controlling, signaling, tracking, and communicating in Amer-
ica's manned space programs. Motorola equipment has been
on every single U.S. manned spacecraft mission. Reliably.
Official mission reports confirm that a Motorola unit has never
malfunctioned or failed to operate on any of these flights.

With the advent of the "thinking"
machine, people are beginning to un-
derstand how horses felt when the car
was invented. Men can still do every-
thing a data-processing machine can
do; but it takes a thousand of them
working an entire lifetime to compute
what the latest electronic "brain" can
&lt;Jo in a day. Machines are a thousand
times faster than they were three years
ago, and a million times faster than
ten years ago.
A whole new industry has appeared
in scarcely more than a decade for the
design, development, manufacture,
maintenance and use of electronic
computers. Within the next decade
computers will affect our lives more
than any other technological develop-
ment. They affect us all because of
their influence on economic planning,
their ability to compress computation
and decision-making into fractions of
a second, their facility in directing and
controlling other machines, their
speed in solving problems too lengthy
for manual solution.
Information-processing systems are
controlling inventories, simulating
business enterprises, designing indus-
trial plants, reducing and analyzing
laboratory data and in simulating
thousands of research problems. They
are controlling complex chemical and


insurance premiums, controlling in-
ventories and scheduling manufactur-
ing and construction activities.
What benefits has the computer
brought about? By helping business
make the most efficient, fullest use of
available resources, computers and
information processing systems are in
effect enabling businessmen eliminate
waste, increase productivity, lower ex-
penses and thereby offer customers a
wider variety of products and services
at the lowest possible price.
Outstanding example of the wider
services as a result of the computer
has been the use of real-time computer
systems in air transportation. Com-
puters such as the UNIVAC 490 Real-
Time Series have enabled airlines to
book and maintain control of millions
of reservations and, in addition, even
reserve a steak for a passenger's meal
aloft. Through computers, airlines
reservations clerks in many different
cities are able to simultaneously check
into seat availability for hundreds of
flights and to book them as far as a
year in advance. Through data com-
munications, clerks obtain responses
to inquiries in seconds. Large-scale-
systems used by major airlines today
are capable of storing complete in-
formation on individual passengers in-
cluding his name, address, telephone
number, his preference of meals, and
even book a rented car at his destina-
tion.
These systems are already in opera-
tion on several airlines. In the plan-
ning stages are still greater manage-
ment information systems such as the
$56 million system ordered by United
Air Lines. Consisting of three giant
UNIVAC 1108 computers, the United
information system is being designed
to handle complete system-wide infor-
mation on its passenger and fleet
operations through 1975. In addition
to processing some 17 major categories
of information for the line, the UNI-
VAC -system will use television-like
cathode ray tube sets on a nationwide
basis to display data.
As a public servant, the computer's
potential value is limited only by
man's imagination. Applications in
medicine, law enforcement, science
and even as a tool to control the
rampages of nature represent only
a fraction of the benefits to be derived
from information processing.
In Cleveland, Ohio, Case Institute
and the Highland View Hospital have
slashed the time required to evaluate
the heavy load of medical research
data. With the help of a large-scale
UNIVAC 1107, evaluation time for
medical data has been cut from as
much as two weeks to one day. Com-
puters have become a vital tool in
that many problems in medicine anil
biology have been beyond the reach
of most laboratories because there was
no way to process the vast amounts of
data fast enough to make them useful
in ex|:&gt;eriments. By using a satellite
UNIVAC 1004 computer connected
by telephone lines to the 1107 at Case
Institute, medical researchers in the
smallest laboratories have access to
the largest computers by means of
ordinary telephone lines.
In law enforcement, New York State
Police have embraced a formidable
new partner, a streamlined communi-
cations network centered around a
UNIVAC 418 message switching com-
puter. The computer cuts the delivery
time of interstation messages from an
average of 40 minutes to five minutes
or less. The computerized network
established a direct line of teletype
communications between 78 state
police stations and 68 municipal po-
lice and sheriff offices tied into the
network. Moreover, the computer
stores registration numbers of stolen
cars and license plates ami will be
able to tell a state trooper within five
seconds whether or not a car is wanted.
Should a trooper encounter a sus-
picious auto he simply radios in the
registration number which is then
fed into the computer. If the car isn't
on the wanted list the computer re-
sponds negatively. But, if the car is
wanted a bell sounds and a message
is flashed to the inquiring officer.
Total elapsed time for this entire
oj&gt;eration is less than 60 seconds.
Historically, the cost of powerful
large-scale computers have made them
readily available to only the largest
businesses or organizations. Recent
advances in computer technology have
extended the benefits of the most
powerful data processing systems to
thousands of small users. Through a
technique known as computer time-
sharing, a number of small users with
remote devices in their offices or lab-
oratories can be connected and simul-
taneously use a large central com-
puter.
In Cambridge, Mass., Keydata Cor-
poration has pioneered a commercial
time-sharing service, an information
processing utility that provides data
processing service in much the samt
way public utilities provide gas and
electric. Each Keydata subscriber ha-
direct access to the central UNIVAC
491 System and pays only for his
shared-time on the large-scale com-
puter.
The electronic computer has revo-
lutionized scientific research. The
same type of real-time computers
which tlirect the flights and monitor
the condition of America's astronaut!,
are helping scientists to probe further
into deep space, to other planets in
the solar system and beyond. L'sinsr i
relatively new technique of radio
astronomy, scientists at the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology are
using a computer-controlled 120-foot
radio telescojje to gain greater insight
into communications in space, to
track with precision objects the sue
of a .22 caliber bullet a thousand miles
away, to map radio source of radio
signals from celestial bodies, to locate
and identify hydrogen and other tin
terials previously undetected, to probe
the atmosphere and surface properties
of Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Mercun
A UNIVAC 490 computer issues
some 250 commands a second to pre-
cisely direct the tracking of a 120-
foot antenna. In addition, the com-
puter will store a celestial almanac of
the sun, the moon, eight planets and
five radio stars. Instantaneously, the
computer will be able to answer smh
questions as "When the moon will
rise on November 30?" or "What will

degrees from Dartmouth College,
Wayne State University, and the
Michigan College of Mining and
Technology. He received the annual
Pittsburgh Spectroscopy Award in
1961. He served as Civilian Technical
Director of the first Bikini bomb tests
after World War II. He was first
director of the Michigan Memorial-
Phoenix Project for the development
of the peaceful uses of atomic energy
at the university.
In July, 1963 Dr. Sawyer was named
"Spectroscopist of the Month" by the
magazine "Arcs and Sparks" for his
contribution to scientific research and
education.
Valedictorian of his class at Dart-
mouth College, Dean Sawyer did grad-
uate work in physics at the University
of Chicago and served in the Navy
in World War I, designing optical in-
struments for the Bureau of Ordnance.
He joined the University of Michigan
faculty in 1919 and was promoted
successively through the ranks to Pro-
fessor of Physics in 1930. In 1946, he
was named Dean of the Horace H.
Rarkham School of Graduate Studies
and in 1959 Vice President for Re-
search. He directed the Michigan
Memorial-Phoenix Project from 1951
to 1959.
During World War II, Dr. Sawyer
was promoted to Commander in the
Naval Reserve. He was in charge of
the Armor and Projectile Laboratory
at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahl-
gren, Virginia from 1941 to 1943,
served as Experimental Laboratories
Officer in charge of testing and re-
search laboratories at the same station
from 1943 to 1945, and received the
Navy Commendation Ribbon.
He was Technical Director of Joint
Task Force One, engaged in carrying
out the "Crossroads" Atomic Bomb
Tests at Bikini Atoll from January to
October, 1946. He attained the rank
of Captain in 1950 and retired in July,
1957.
He is a member of the Scientific
Advisory Council of the Naval Weap-
ons Laboratory; the Advisory Com-
mittee for the Geophysical Institute of
the University of Alaska; and the Na-
tional Research Council.
He is a Fellow of The American
Physical Society and the Optical So-
ciety of America. He is Vice President
of Section B of the American Associa-
tion for the Adancement of Science.
As Vice President for Research of
the University of Michigan, he has
been responsible for coordination of
hundreds of the University's research
projects amounting to $40,000,000 a
year. As a graduate dean, he admin-
istered a program for over 6,000 grad-
uate students.
Dean Sawyer's most distinguished
scholarly contributions have been in
the field of spectroscopy, a branch of
optics which uses instruments for dis-
persing radiant light into wavelengths
and for observing or measuring the
resultant spectra which provide one
of the most powerful tools for the
study of atomic structure and for
analysis of the composition of the
source material.
As a Guggenheim Fellow in Berlin,
he developed a new type of vacuum
spectrograph and published with Pro-
fessor F. Paschen the first complete
analysis of the second spectra of a
metal, aluminum. Among his early
spectrographs accomplishments was
the development of the first high-
speed, analytical method for spectro-
graphs analysis of steel in cooperation
with Dr. H. B. Vincent. In addition,
he collaborated with Dr. Vincent in
creating the first analytical slide rule
for the reduction of spectrographs
data.
His book "Experimental Spectro-
scopy" was first published in 1944 and
has been republished in a third edi-
tion by Dover Press. It is an authori-
tative work in the field. In addition,
he is the author of 83 technical
articles.
Former Michigan Student to Head
Dept. of Electrical Engineering
at M.I.T.
Professor Louis D. Smullin, the en-
gineer who in 1962 succeeded in
bouncing a laser light beam off the
moon and detecting reflections back to
earth, has been appointed Head of
the Department of Electrical En-
gineering at the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology.
Professor Smullin, a widely-recog-
nized authority in microwave en-
gineering whose 1962 moon experi-
ment was a demonstration of the radar
applications of lasers, succeeds Pro-
fessor Peter Eli as who has served as
department head since 1960.
Announcement of the new appoint-
ment was made by Dean Gordon S.
Brown of the M.I.T. School of Engin-
eering and himself a former Head of
the Department of Electrical En-
gineering.
Professor Smullin has been connect-
ed with M.I.T. almost continuously
since 1941. He received the B.S. degree
in electrical engineering from the
University of Michigan in 1936, the
M.S. degree from M.I.T. in 1939, and
spent two years in industry before
joining the Radiation Laboratory in
November, 1941, where he directed
the Microwave Gas Discharge Group.
Following the war, Professor Smullin
was in industry for a year and a half,
then returned to M.I.T. to organize
and head the Microwave Tube Lab-
oratory of the M.I.T. Research
Lalx&gt;ratory of Electronics. He helped
plan and set up Lincoln Laboratory in
September 1952, became Head of the
Radar and Weapons Division at Lin-
coln. In September, 1955, he returned
to the main campus as associate pro-
fessor of electrical engineering and
was made professor in 1960.
In recent years, Professor Smullin's
microwave studies have led him to
the general area of plasma dynamics
and he now is head of the Active
Plasma Systems Group of RLE which
is concerned with producing ex-
tremely hot plasmas, research which
is basic to the long-range problem of
power production through controlled
thermonuclear fusion. The 1962 moon
bounce demonstration was not related
to plasma research, but was, instead,
a demonstration of the use of lasers in
a radar mode.
Professor Smullin has only just re-
turned from a one-year term on the
electrical engineering faculty at the
Indian Institute of Technology at
Kanpur, India. Professor Smullin was
a member of a three-man M.I.T. com-
mittee which recommended in 1961
that M.I.T. organize and join in the
university consortium which is now
helping build Kanpur under Agency
for International Development sup-
port.
Professor Smullin's colleagues char-
acterize him as an expert in the ex-
perimental exploitation of new theore-
tical concepts. In addition, he also has
shown unflagging and sympathetic
concern for the professional and per-
sonal growth of his students. Even
during his years at Lincoln Labora-
tory, he continued informal connec-
tions with his students in the RLE
Microwave Tube Laboratory. He has
been active in department curricula
development and academic affairs, de-

Only 1 graduate in 10 can be happy at Harshaw,
(but that 1 man won't be happy elsewhere).
The graduate whom we accept
has to have more than an unusual
amount of ability in his disci-
pline. He's got to have ambition,
too.
For instance, he shouldn't be
satisfied with the status quo... for
himself or for us. He should be-
lieve enough in his ideas to speak
up for them...even if he's a
minority of one. And pressure
doesn't wilt him; it brings out the
best in him.
W hy do we demand this desire
in a beginner? Alter 60 years of
business we know that Harshaw
grows only as fast as our people
lake us.
And grow, wc have. Steadily
and spectacularly. And our peo-
ple, naturally, grow along with
us. As fast as their talents can
take them.
Harshaw offers more than a
clear and fast track to advance-
ment.
There's stability in our age (fig
years), our financial structure
(we're trailed on the X.Y. Stock
Exchange), and our mix of work.
There's also a diversity of work
to keep you from boredom. (4
divisions, an R&amp;D department,
1000 different products and prod-
uct lines.)
And most important, a climate
that speeds your professional
development. Liberal education
assistance. Excellent universities
and libraries in the area. Top
professionals to counsel you. And
more.
So, if you're pretty finicky
where you begin your career, start
with us. We're pretty finicky, too.

•v« UPWARDS
WITH INTELLECTUAL PRODUCTIVITY
by
Prof. Harry Benford
Let's start by assuming that your
primary reason for being in Ann Ar-
bor is to gain an education. Your
professors are here to help you but
the key to success is within yourself. If
we could unscrew the top of your head
and pour the knowledge in we'd do
it; but we can't. If you want to get
the maximum return on the time and
money you're spending here, you must
do whatever you can to maximize
your productivity as a student. This
means, above all, that you must learn
to study effectively. And that's what
we're going to talk about now.
In every phase of your existence,
the underlying basis of satisfaction
and success is in your attitude. Your
college education is no exception.
Students who get miserable grades
and fail, do so not because they are
stupid or because their instructors are
sadists, but because they (the stu-
dents) have immature attitudes. They
are simply not ready to be shoved out
of the nest and sent off to college. If
this is your own problem, there's noth-
ing we on the faculty can do about it
except call it to your attention. There
are, however, several practical tips
we can give you, which—coupled with
good motivation—should lead to your
improved effectiveness as a student.
These are given in random order.
1. Always study with some purpose
in mind. Set yourself long term as
well as short term goals. Keep telling
yourself that within a few years you'll
be applying what you learn here to
earning a living. You'll be a profes-
sional who is paid for what he knows
more than for what he does.
2. Try to understand what use will
be made of what you're learning. We
on the faculty are firmly convinced
that every one of your courses will be
important to you sooner or later in
your professional life or in meeting
your responsibilities as a citizen. If
you have any doubts about the im-
portance of any of your courses, we'd
welcome a discussion.
3. Experiment to find out how,
where, and under what conditions
you concentrate best. Most students
find the following advice helpful:
a. Study at same time, same place each
day.
b. Have study materials together and all
ready to go. Don't give yourself excuses
for diddling. "Time is the coin of life—."
c. Work at top pitch for 20-30 minutes
at a time. Then pause and exercise or
rest for a few minutes. Then back to it.
d. Eliminate distractions: ladios, phone-
calls, yakking. girls in short skirts (and
other attractions of the library).
e. Don*t try to study at the same desk
where you carry on some hobby. And put
that picture of your one true love in
another, more he-lowed, place.
f. Most of us are more creative in the
morning. Save that time for your creative
work. And don't try to do anything when
you're completely exhausted—as many of
us tend to become in the late afternoon
or along about 3 A.M.
4. Understanding is more important
than memorizing, but they're both
important. You can help memorize
facts by writing them down; you can
OCTOBER 1966
39


them down in your own words. Pre-
tend that you are preparing a lecture
to be given the next day. How can you
present the material in a manner so
lucid that the sleepiest student will
see the light? And don't keep putting
it oft. Preparing a good set of notes is
next to impossible unless you keep
right up with the professor.
5. At the start of each term, make
a study schedule showing your hour
by hour work for a typical week. Set
aside at least a few sacred hours for
long term tasks such as term papers.
And be pragmatic about your strength
of character. Don't schedule yourself
for 80 hours of study per week if
you've never been able to bring your-
self to work 50. Moderation in all
things. Even in study. You have a
manifest destiny relative to the mem-
bers of the nubility up on the hill;
do not fail them.
6. Keep your study schedule in
front of you. Modify it and vary it
as necessary, daily or weekly. But
don't just drift along at the whim
of the most immediate pressures. And
don't spend so much time on one
course that you totally neglect an-
other. This seems too obvious to de-
serve mention; do you think college
students don't need such advice? Ha.
7. Make a conscious effort to speed
up your reading. But, of course, you
must gear your speed to the material
at hand; whipping through a novel
is fine but your technical books de-
mand more care. Overl(x&gt;king or mis-
reading a single word may change the
meaning of an entire paragraph.
8. Develop your exam-manship.
Don't overdo it to the point of quali-
fying to write a book on how to make
Tau Bet without an education. But
you're being foolish if you don't put
your best foot forward.* So, at the
risk of being unfrocked by the Ameri-
can Association of University Profes-
sors, let me now suggest how you may
indeed put your best foot forward.
I only ask that, in exchange for these
professional secrets, you heed and
practice all the other admonitions
enumerated herein. I'd like to think
that both of your feet will be at least
fairly presentable. Here are the ele-
ments of exam-manship:
*The Engineering English Department is cur-
rently carrying out research on how we can put a
best foot forward when wc have only two feet.
Some hypothesize that the expression dates back to
prehistoric times when men still ran around on
all fours.
a. First of all, try to out-psych the
professor. Put yourself in his shoes. What
questions would you ask? Ones that arc
fairly tough to answer hut easy to grade,
of course. And the correlation between
number of students in the class and in-
cidence of essay type questions is inverse
to an extreme.
b. Have a trial run. l ook up the file of
old exams at the library and sec how- well
you are prepared. While you're at it,
watch for favorite questions. Play the
probabilities.
c. Don't try to study the subject on
the morning of the exam. For every item
of knowledge you cram in at (he last
moment, there's an item forced out the
other end. Maybe that's where dandruff
comes from: excreted knowledge.
d. Somehow manage lo get yourself into
the proper psychological tension during the
exam. For all but the most blase of you,
that means learning to relax. Brains soaked
in adrenalin arc notoriously sluggish. How-
do you avoid exam-time tensions? Just keep
telling yourself during the test, and for
an hour or two beforehand, that you really
don't give a damn whether you pass the
thing or not; you're here to get an edu-
cation, not take tests. Ten years from now
you won't even remember whether you
ever took the bloody course. And in the
limitless reaches of this universe. Docs It
Really Matter At All?
"Oh, to be wafted away
From this black Aceldama ol sorrow,
Where the dust of an early today
Is the earth of a dusty tomorrow!"
e. Having mastered the art of submerg-
ing your tensions just before a test, see if
you can't persuade them to resurface and
keep you working hard between exams.
f. There arc different levels of learning:
from being aware of the existence of some
subject up to being so saturated with
understanding (hat it is a part of your
personality. Obviously, different parts of
the course material should be learned at
different levels. Try to pin your professor
down on this; he owes it to the class to be
specific. Possibly this never occurred to him
and you'll make him a better teacher if you
force him to give it some thought.
9. In digging your way through a
text book assignment, practice the
discipline of SQ1R as presented by the
authors of Learning to Learn (Hough-
ton Mifflin):
S: Survey
Q: Question
Read
Recite
Rite (write)
Review
Why survey} To gain perspective
and to spot the overall relationships.
Remembering scattered bits and pieces
is tough. How survey? Read the title,
the abstract (if given), the introduc-
tion, the section headings, and the
summary. Look at the tables and il-
lustrations. If none of these devices
are available, read the first and last
paragraphs and the first sentence o[
every third paragraph.
Why question} To help you de-
cide what's important so you can read
selectively. Also, to arouse your in-
terest and help you remember. Ask
yourself: what questions will this
material answer? Clues: the title, sec-
tion headings, etc. as above.
Read selectively; this will force you
lo think selectively. Don't waste your
time underlining. Read rapidly; keep
pushing yourself but not unreason-
ably.
Recite as soon as you've found an
answer to one of your questions. Stop
reading and form the answer in your
own words. Re-read that part if your
answer is hazy.
Write a one-page review sheet of
questions and answers for each chap-
ter. Use only key words. Example:
Why question?
Show what's important
Read selectively
Arouse interest
Help remember
Reviexv your effort as soon as you
finish the reading assignment. More
on this in the final bit of wisdom
below.
10. Repetition is a key element in
the learning process; without it ou:
memory fails us. But repetition and
review can take a lot of time. To use
our time to best advantage we miw
arrange our reviews at increasing in-
tervals. This is because our retention
of what we have memorized improves
with each repetition. If you made a
time-plot of how much you could re-
member about a given chapter that
you learned perfectly the first time
through but never reviewed, you'd gel
a forgettery curve like figure 1. Now ii
at some time you reviewed and n
learned all you had forgotten, your
forgettery curve would look like figim
2.
The initial slope of the new for-
gettery curve is only about half »l
what it was before the review. Thi-
leads to the rule that your review
schedule should be at doubling in
tervals: see figure 3.
After seven or eight repetitions
your forgettery curve will be \ irtualb
flat. In short, you'll practically h;m
the material memorized for life.
• • #
This completes our discussion &lt;&gt;l
how you can increase your own etJet
tiveness as a student. If you want if
improve, you can. What's your at::-
tude?

They're members of Bethlehem Steel's 1966 Loop Course
—graduates of colleges and universities from coast to coast.
What is the Loop Course? Since 1922, we have conducted
this course to train college graduates for management ca-
reers at Bethlehem Steel. Hundreds of men at all levels of
management, including our Chairman, started as loopers.
The '66 Loop convened at our general offices in Bethle-
hem, Pa., early in July. After five weeks of indoctrination,
many of these men were assigned to facilities throughout
the country for further brief training at the operations be-
fore undertaking their first job assignments. Others, such
as sales and accounting trainees, remain at the general
offices for longer periods before being assigned.
Although our primary need is for engineering and other
technical graduates—such men have many fine opportuni-
ties in all phases of steelmaking, as well as in research,
sales, mining, fabricated steel construction, and shipbuild-
ing—both technical and non-technical graduates are needed
for most of those activities as well as accounting, purchas-
ing, traffic, finance and law, industrial and public relations,
and general services.
You'll find a great deal more information in our booklet,
"Careers with Bethlehem Steel and the Loop Course." You
can obtain a copy at your Placement Office, or drop a post-

vious man had held the job for several
years. I think this works pretty well.
In a sense, though, it is not fair to
ask one man to carry a job like that
continually, because he has other in-
terests. Sure, he is interested in the
students and his fellow man, and so
on, but he has other interests, too. So,
I've been wondering if there are other
ways of doing this, ways in which we
could retain the advantage of having
a single man follow a group of stu-
dents for a long period.
PROFESSOR MAURICE J. SIN-
NOTT: Along the lines of Professor
Daily's comments, we are aware in
the Chemical-Metallurgical Depart-
ment of this problem in counselling
and contact with students. We are ini-
tiating a program which you might be
interested in hearing about. We are
essentially assigning every student in
the department to a faculty man for
as long as he is in the department. He
will get a personal invitation from the
faculty man to come and see him, at
least once a semester for sure, and
anytime he wants to see him about
anything.
In general, most of our students do
not want to make waves. You will hear
from the real bright students, very
vocally, and you will hear from the
students who get into difficulty. But
the great bulk of the students are
more or less voiceless. And they wish
to stay that way for some reason. You
have to go out and drag them in to
get their comments. We're going to
try dragging this semester. We're go-
ing to give each student someone he
can lean on. And we're going to try
to divorce this counselling from
strictly the classification bit. The
counsellor will be for discussing prob-
lems. The classification will be run
just as a mechanical thing, as it should
at this level. We will let you know
next year how we make out.
DONNELLY: We are generally
agreed that there is inadequate inter-
action between students and faculty
on the undergraduate level. The stu-
dents on the floor have expressed
some specific aspects of that: the lack
of social interaction, a very pro-
nounced apparent lack in the counsel-
ling process. Some have mentioned
that social interaction alone would
not allow an effective program of feed-
back on the questions of course evalu-
ation and curriculum emphasis.
We would like now to ask you for
suggestions of specific programs, which
may help to further interaction of this
sort. Professor Sinnott has mentioned
one. Professor Hansen mentioned
some earlier in his discussion. Profes-
sor Nelson mentioned that we can
write a letter when we graduate, to
tell the college what was good and
what was bad about our experience.
My personal feeling is that by the
time I graduate I will be so happy to
get out of here that I will have for-
gotten a good part of my gripes. I am
going to be very likely to praise the
school highly, because I felt I had had
competent faculty members and an
interesting experience.
I also feel—from my personal point
of view, which I would like to inter-
ject here for a second—that interaction
on the social level is definitely ineffi-
cient in helping to correc t the prob-
lems of course evaluation and curricu-
lum emphasis. Not only is it inefficient
from the standpoint that it takes a
large amount of the faculty member's
time, but it is inefficient in that the
faculty member will not get the opin-
ions brought to him bark to the place
where they can do some good.
So, asking you for suggestions of
further programs now, what arc some
possible areas for increased emphasis
on interaction? What sort of inter-
action would lead to improvement in
the areas which Dean Van Wylen has
defined for us: curriculum, course, and
faculty evaluation, and the problems
of the college as a whole?
QUESTION FROM THE FLOOR:
The course and instructor evaluations
are one such area. Dean Van Wylen,
how seriously are these evaluations
taken? Do they ever reach the Dean's
office? Or do they go to the instructor
and stop there?
DEAN VAN WYLEN: First, the way
the course evaluations are designed
now, they go only to the faculty. I
expect your question is in reference
to a matter which is really quite diffi-
cult, and that is to know what to do
with faculty members who are not
really the very best teachers. We do
make a conscious elfort as department
chairman—this would certainly be my
attitude also—to discuss with the
faculty how they might improve their
teaching and to make sure that they
are teaching courses for which the
abilities they have are best suited. If
we could do further, I would apprec
ate knowing them.
PROF. HANSEN: I think it might
be of interest for you to know why the
course evaluation forms are not askec
for by the department heads. At thi&gt;
level, when we hire a man onto the
faculty of a university like this, we
first and foremost regard him as a
professional. We treat him accord
ingly. To this extent we simply as-
sume that he will personally attempt
to correct his faults as they are de-
scribed to him on evaluation forms.
If this is not so, then we have made a
poor judgment in hiring the man in
the first place. We will admit that
poor judgments sometimes are made.
But the first and foremost concern
that a department head has is to re-
cognize that his staff are professionak
ROBERT C. INNES: I think the big
problem in faculty-student relations
is that the student has no way of know-
ing what is being done about his
gripes. Can't we do something about
that?
PROF. NELSON: I think I can speak
briefly to that. We have management
problems in this college. They in-
volve the faculty members personal
health; they involve his leaves of ab-
sence; they involve his research and
his teaching. We get to know, roughh,
the strong and weak points of our
faculty. We shift courses in order to
get flexibility among the staff. De-
pending on the semester you get a
man, depending on who is evaluating
him, you may think a professor is do-
ing a good or poor job of teaching.
What does this add up to? It adds up
to life. This is a management prob-
lem. The same kind of problems
which we all will face when we lea\e
Ann Arbor, Michigan. We are not
going to ask any professor on our staff
to go through a so-called popularit\
contest with students. That is unpro-
fessional and unethical. We are inter-
ested in your comments, but we want
you to realize our position, also.
PROF. FARRIS: We have one
particular course in our depart-
ment which students swear up and
down is the worst course they have
ever taken. They say they don't know
why it is required. An so on. Appro
pos to Prof. Nelson's comments, this
is the one course which comes back
four years later as being the course
which made the difference in that fel-
low's life. Students will come back

&gt;». we can be premature with our
u elements.
QUESTION FROM THE FLOOR:
&gt;ne of the best sources of information
ibout the curriculum is students who
"»ave been out working as engineers
in industry. Is there any feedback to
lie school from these people?
PROF. NELSON: Most of our faculty
:&gt;re in constant contact with the in-
dustry. However, we do not have an
industry committee to periodically re-
view our curriculum.
PROF. FARRIS: It is a controversial
cjuestion as to whether the university
as a whole should be responsive to
that particular feedback. The univer-
sity likes to feel that it is in a position
of leadership, in which case it may be
at the frontier of some investigation
—including curriculum development.
If we sit around waiting for feedback
to tell us what to do, we will always
be behind.
DONNELLY: This is probably a
good point at which to close this eve-
ning's discussion. Maybe ending on a
controversial point will help to keep
all of us thinking.
In summary of tonight's discussion,
Dean Van Wylen began with a defini-
tion of student-faculty interaction. He
included in his definition interaction
in the areas of curriculum emphasis,
course and faculty evaluation, and
problems of the college as a whole.
Professors Farris, Hansen, and Nelson
commented from their points of view
as department chairmen that student-
faculty interaction of the type defined
was a desirable thing. Prof. Hansen
stressed that the faculty were inter-
ested in interaction as a means to ob-
tain feedback from students on their
various problems and opinions. Prof.
Nelson asserted that interaction was a
communication-and-response type of
thing. Finally, Prof. Farris suggested
that in order to be effective, interac-
tion must take place on a personal
basis.
The three departmental chairman
on our panel mentioned various op-
portunities for interaction in their
particular departments. All agreed
that opportunities were either inade-
quate or not sufficiently utilized at
least on the undergraduate level. All
three suggested at one time or another,
however, that interaction takes a lot
of work on the part of both the
faculty and the student. Dean Van
Wylen mentioned the Engineering
Council as the best medium for inter-
action on the college level. He stated,
though, that the most effective inter-
action would take place below the col-
lege level—on the department level
and on a personal basis.
Members of the floor expressed their
opinions on the opportunities avail-
able to them for interaction. They
unanimously felt the need for more
student-faculty interaction, but dis-
agreed as to which form woidd be
most effective. The various informal
oportunities for interaction were dis-
cussed; counselling was discussed; the
freshman droj&gt;-out rate, faculty evalu-
ations, a college steering committee
were considered. Faculty and students
alike seemed to feel that much more
needed to be done. And both groups
agreed that both groups needed to
work at it. Although this discussion
did not produce a great deal in the
way of concrete suggestions for im-
provement of the problem, it can be
considered a healthy first step. Stu-
dents and faculty have a little better
idea of what each other are thinking.
The next step is open to members of
either group. ■

6—Other specified delays—allowed lime for
those permissible delays which have not
been mentioned elsewhere.
In addition to these six, an operator
is permitted twenty-four minutes per
shift to attend to his personal needs.
This time is categorized simply as
PERSONAL and is not assigned a
type number. Again, it must be kept
in mind that these shift allowances
are only permissible when their inclu-
sion is essential to the performance of
the operation.
As it is necessary to prorate the reg-
ular and irregular elemental times on
a per piece basis, so it is necessary to
prorate the time for shift allowances
in the same manner. In order to do
this a side calculation must be made
of which the final result is a standard
hour per piece, but whose internal
figures provide data for the more for-
mal presentation.
To give an example, suppose the
shift allowances for a particular opera-
tion are 24 minutes per shift personal
time and 10 minutes per shift for a
tool change. The total of these is 34
minutes per shift. It should be noted
that these are 34 minutes out of an
eight hour shift which are nonproduc-
tive. The first step of the side calcula-
tion is to subtract the total nonproduc-
tive minutes from the total number of
minutes in the shift.
ISO min/shft — 34 min/shft = 446 min/shft
446 minutes are the actual produc-
tive time per shift. In order to deter-
mine the number of pieces produced
in this time the total productive min-
utes must be divided by the AL-
LOWED CYCLE TIME PER PIECE
arrived at under the elemental de-
scription.
116 min/shft : .7015 min/pc =
585.6 pes/shft
585.6 is the average number of pieces
produced during a shift. This is the
figure by which to prorate the shift
allowances to arrive at a time per
piece. The calculation
585.6 pes/shft -f- 8 hr/shft = 73.2 pes/hr
yields an average hourly production
for a shift.
In order to determine what fraction
of one man hour is spent in the pro-
duction of one piece the following
calculation is necessary.
1 man hr -+- 73.2 pes/hr = .01366 man hr/pc
.01366 man hr/pc is the man power
required to perform a given opera-
tion on one piece of stock and is called
the STANDARD HOUR PER
PIECE. In making calculations, both
in the formal and informal presenta-
tions, the number of pieces is not
rounded off whereas time is.
To return to the more formal pre-
sentation it is necessary to record un-
der TOTAL PER ALLOWANCE
TYPE the shift allowances for each
of the seven categories and total them.
Using the data from the previous ex-
ample 10 minutes would be recorded
under Type 1 and 24 minutes under
Pers to arrive at a 34 minute total.
This data is next transferred to
the column headed ALLOWANCES
where more description is given. The
tool change could appear as follows
Type 1: Tool Change, 5 tools @ 2 min/tool
= 10 min/shft
The word Personal is also written

So you want to be a pilot?
It's not as hard as it looks. It's harder.
The days of flying by the seat of your pants are gone forever.
Now you have to know an awful lot about things like aerodynam-
ics, electronics, and celestial navigation.
Does that mean that flying in the Air Force has become
"automated"? It does not.
Any pilot will tell you that flying is still a great adventure. The
split second when a man leaves the runway solo for the first time
is still one of the most exciting moments of his life.
If you'd like to earn your wings, one of the best ways is through
Air Force ROTC. For details, contact the Professor of Aerospace
Studies, an Air Force representative, or mail the coupon.

Cosmic Ray Experiment
While communities throughout the
country wait with bated breath for
the Atomic Energy Commission to
decide where it will locate the propos-
ed 200 BEV (billion electron volt)
accelerator, a small group of physi-
cists, among them, Dr. Lawrence
Jones, a professor of physics at the
University of Michigan, is quietly
moving ahead with plans to fill the
gap until the machine is built.
The physicists recently received
word that the National Science Foun-
dation (NSF) would provide them
with study funds to determine the
feasibility of their plan, ft has granted
them $279,800 for this year.
They have proposed to use the en-
ergetic cosmic rays to produce some
of the same intra-nuclear collisions
that the big accelerator will produce.
Their device will be able to study the
strong interactions of protons, neu-
trons, and mesons at energies from
100 BEV to 1000 BEV with much
better precision and in far greater
numbers than has been possible in the
past.
By locating this equipment on a
mountain summit, such as Mt. Evans,
Colo., the intensity of the incoming
cosmic rays is about 50 times greater
than near sea level due to absorption
in the atmosphere.
The present plan grew out of dis-
cussions at a meeting at Case Institute
of Technology late in 1961. Prof. Jones
presented this concept there and
worked on details with Dr. Fred Mills
of the Midwestern Universities Re-
search Association (MURA). A pre-
liminary study in 1965, carried out
by Drs. Mills and Jones, together with
several other physicists from the Uni-
versities of Wisconsin and Michigan,
proved encouraging and led to the
detailed study plan just approved by
the NSF.
Prof. Jones says that the cosmic
ray experiment could be built and put
into operation in about four years
and would cost about $15 million.
The 200 BEV machine would require
seven or eight years for construction
antl testing, and cost estimates now top
$375 million.
Prof. Jones emphasizes that the
cosmic ray experiment wotdd in no
way substitute for the accelerator.
"Given the choice," he says, "the ac-
celerator would be far more valuable
and versatile than the cosmic ray ex-
periment. But our proposal would
|&gt;ermit a peek into the future, so to
s|&gt;eak, years before the accelerator
could be ready for ex]&gt;eriments." He
says that it is probable that the cosmic
ray results would even further whet
the appetites if scientists for the ac-
celerator and could provide data
which would lead to a more effective
exploitation of the latter when it is
finished.
Experiments will be carried out this
year by a team of physicists on feas-
ibility of the large, proposed device.
This would ultimately consist of two
large magnets of about 1500 tons each,
a large target of liquified hydrogen,
and an extensive array of particle
counters and spark chambers (devices
for producing a spark in neon gas
along the path of a cosmic ray par-
ticle through the chamber). Although
the cosmic ray experiment requires
no man-made machine to produce its
beam, the rare occurrence of cosmic
rays of an interesting energy requires
an enormous size of the apparatus to
collect data at a useful rate (several
cosmic ray interactions per minute).
Hence it would constitute a structure
as tall as a 10 story building and would
require many caremas plus a small
electronic computer to record the
data from each event.
Besides Jones and Mills, other
physicists engaged in the study include
Dr. P. V. Ramana Murthy at Michi-
gan and Dr. A. Subramanian at Wis-
consin. Both are on leave of absence
from the Tata Institute of Funda-
mental Research in Bombay, India.
Professors R. March, D. Hartung, and
K. R. Symon from Wisconsin, Pro-
fessor B. Dayton from Los Angeles
State College, and Dr. G. Del Castillo
from MURA also are involved in the
study program.
Wind Tunnels
The University of Michigan has had
wind tunnels on its campus for re-
search purposes since 1911, pre-dating
even the first U.S. college course in
aeronautics, which was originated a
the U-M in 1914-15 by Felix Pav
lowski.
The first wind tunnel at the Uni-
versity was built by members of the
Aero Club in 1911-12 and was
for design of the first glider construct
ed and built at the University.
Today there are eight wind tunnel&gt;
in operation at the University, used
for research ranging from studies of
smokestack gases to the investigation
of behavior of electric arcs in a super
sonic airstream.
Two of the wind tunnels are located
at Willow Run Laboratories, where
construction of the U-M's first super-
sonic wind tunnel began in 1946 un-
der an Air Force project. It is beine
used today by aerospace engineers for
an evaluation of jets in the side of i
model and their possible utility as a
replacement for the adjustable meta'
control flaps in supersonic aircraft.
The second tunnel built at Willo*
Run in 1951-52 was the first to use a
single nozzle for a continuous ran«c
supersonic flow. The electric an
studies in supersonic streams are beim:
carried out here. The tunnel also was
used in studies in which, for the fir-J
time, such an arc was stablized in a
supersonic airstream.
The wind tunnel used for studies
of smokestack plumes was built in
1926 in the East Engineering Build
ing. The remaining five wind tunnek
including two which operate at speeds
more than five times the speed ol
sound (or at hypersonic levels), are
in the aerospace research facilities on
the North Campus.
One of these, the "hot shot" tunnel,
had the largest energy storage capacity
of any wind tunnel on an American
campus when it was built in 196-
This Mach 20 wind tunnel require
100,000 kilowatts of power for its
one-fiftieth second tests.

and the 24 and 10 minute allowances
are prorated by the shift output of
585.6 pieces to arrive at a time per
piece for these allowances. The AL-
LOWED CYCLE TIME PER PIECE
and the ALLOWANCE TIME PER
PI ECE are then summed to arrive at
a total average time necessary to pro-
duce one piece. This figure is then di-
vided into 00 minutes to arrive at an
AVERACE HOURLY PRODUC-
TION. The figure obtained here
should correspond with the average
hourly production of the side calcula-
tion. Again, the STANDARD HOUR
PER PIECE is determined by divid-
ing into one man hour.
At this point the primary goal of
the time study has been accomplished;
a standard hour per piece has been
determined. However, there remain
several details which must be covered.
The first of these is the ATTAIN-
ABLE HOURLY PRODUCTION.
This is obtained by dividing into 60
minutes the ALLOWED CYCLE
TIME PER PIECE. The CROSS
HOURLY PRODUCTION is derived
by dividing 60 minutes by the AL-
LOWED CYCLE TIME PER PIECE
less any irregular elements. The re-
maining details of the operators badge
number, the machine brass tag num-
bers, etc. are strictly bookkeeping de-
vices and can be easily obtained from
the foreman.
The above summary of how to
take a time study covers the details
involved in arriving at a standard
hour per piece when there is only one
man, operating one machine and per-
forming only one operation on a piece
of stock. This is the simplest situation
with which a lime study man must
deal. Time studies which analyze more
complex situations such as one man
performing two operations or one man
operating two machines present no
further difficulties as far as elemental
descriptions are concerned. However,
some complications occur in the calcu-
lations. These other situations are
many and cannot be dealt with here
but as in the simplest casj the goal of
the time study man is to assign forac
fraction of a man hour to each part
which is processed.
Now that the theoretical aspects of
time study have been covered it is nec-
essary to view the time study section
as an integral part of the Standards
Department, and as a service group
which benefits the entire Gear and
Axle complex.
As a service department the basic
job of the time study section is to
maintain the Group Routings. In or-
der to understand the complete signi-
ficance of the two word title each term
must be explained separately. At Gear
and Axle there are several separate
and distinct plants each of which is
divided into groups. Within each
group a certain number of operations
are carried out on a part for which
the foreman of that group is chiefly re-
sponsible. The term routing implies
that a Group Routing shows the path
or route through a group which a part
follows as it is processed or operations
are performed on it. A Group Routing
shows each operation and the man-
power required for it as determined
by a time study and shows the total
manpower used to carry out all the
operations within a group. It is the
group total which is of importance to
a foreman since it indicates to him
the amount of manpower he should
be using to perform a given set of op-
erations. It is this amount of man-
power which he gets paid for and indi-
cates whether or not his group is run-
ning efficiently.
To determine a group efficiency the
standard time per piece is multiplied
by the number of pieces run during a
shift to arrive at the man hours that
should have been used to produce
that number of pieces. When this is
divided by the actual man hours used
an efficiency is determined. Not only
does this efficiency indicate the physi-
cal performance of a group, but it
also indicates whether or not the
group is making money. The man-
power in each group must be paid for
by the price of the final axle assembly.
Part of this price is the manpower nec-
essary to produce the component axle
parts as indicated by the routings. If
a group uses more men than the rout-
ing indicates is necessary, the group
loses money. If it uses less manpower
the group is making money. Hence,
the total standard time per piece on a
routing is extremely important to
Gear and Axle as a cost factor and
must be carefully determined.
As can be seen from a Group Rout-
ing there is time allowed for items
which cannot be classified as opera-
tions and therefore cannot be covered
by a time study, but are necessary to
the operation of the group and must
be paid for. Two of these are the tool-
setter allowance and the manload ad-
justment. The standard time allowed
for the freofsetter is calculated to pay a
group for the time which a toolsetter
must spend repairing the machines
necessary for the production of a given
part.
The manload adjustment pays for
the unutilized manpower in the group.
Although in reality, 'manload', as it
is called, can be calculated, it seems
more realistic to think of it as a vari-
able factor which brings the theory
used in the calculation of a time study
to the level of reality. A good time
study does not allow time for an oper-
ator to light a cigarette or wipe his
hands outside of the twenty-four per-
sonal minutes which can easily be
spent in the lavatory. The fact is, that
a man cannot meet the standards set
by theory strictly because he is a man
and not an automaton. In reality, an
operator cannot consistently get the
average hourly production shown on
a time study because of irregularities
of stockHow, machine downtime and
human frailties. This difference be-
tween what a man does get and what
he should get is in the manload ad-
justment. Also included under this
somewhat nebulous heading is the
manpower wasted when two sequen-
tial operations do not have equal rates
of production. If two operations pro-
duce 50 and 100 pieces an hour re-
spectively, the man operating the 100
an hour machine is going to be wait-
ing half the time for stock. Since wait-
ing for stock is not allowed on a time
study this unutilized manpower is
placed in manload.
The manpower determined by the
time studies plus the additional man-
power carried in the allowances and
manload adjustment constitutes the
total manpower necessary to perform
a given set of operations on a part.
The total manpower charged to a com-
pleted axle is the sum of all the man-
power assigned to the different groups
which process its components. This
manpower must be paid for and it is
added to the cost of the axle.
There are many other functions
which are performed by Time Study
which are more or less extra duties of
the department. A study of each would
lie wasteful. It is sufficient to say that
the Time Study section of Standards is
a valuable service organization and it
is my hope it will achieve greater
status as the importance of its work
becomes more widely recognized. ■

of melting cycles will soon be applied
on a practical basis. Die casting of
iron may be coming out of the theory
stage. The pace of new discoveries
will be just that much faster in the
years ahead.
Take a hard look at a career in
the Malleable castings industry.
Malleable foundries are of a size
where you will have the opportunity
to put your top skills to use almost
immediately. It's a growing industry,
as witnessed by the $75 million
expansion program now under way.
Its future is as bright as that of its
major customers — producers of
cars, trucks, and other transporta-
tion products, farm, construction
and other types of machinery.
The image of the foundry labora-
tory as a cubbyhole is being shat-
tered. Pictured above is one of
several new laboratory facilities built
by producers of Malleable castings
in the last few years.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


who joined us had the same aims,
color, and interests!
The guy who wrote what you are reading joined the com-
pany as an optical physicist. Now he's an advertising man.
His assistant, an English and French major from Catawba
College in Salisbury, N.C., who first joined our French
affiliate, Kodak-Pathe, in Paris, has just written a manual
in English that introduces beginners to a system of sepa-
rations chemistry for which we market equipment and
supplies. Her husband works in our Photographic Tech-
nology Division engineering color motion-picture proc-
essing systems. (Four other departments tried to lure him
away, but he decided he preferred the exciting new de-
velopment work in his area.) The chairman of our board
also came originally as a physicist, the president as a
mathematician, one of our two executive vice presidents
as a chemical engineer, the other as a Ph.D. chemist. On
the other hand, our vice president of marketing majored
in economics at the local university.
The point: out of self-interest, pure and frank, we
have to help every college graduate who joins us find
where he is happiest and can therefore earn raises fastest.
What makes this a little easier here for both parties is
our tremendous scope.
Having long been part of many, many more industiics
than the one with which the general public identifies us,
we operate in technologies that range from optics to
cattle nutrition, from knitting to laser-cavity design. Per-
haps more significant to the
person choosing an affiliation
for the long haul, we have
room and need for every shade
of personal bent. In most peo-
ple personal bent is still to be
discovered at the time of
college graduation.
One makeup is tuned for
avid pursuit of better under-
standing of the physicalworld,
whatever the purpose. He can
enjoy himself here. Another
will enjoy himself here far
more in tough competition to create demand for the ulti-
mate fruits of the first fellow's studies. One technical tal-
ent finishes what the other technical talent starts. To man
the long line between them, we have urgent need for just
about every other honest technical talent, male or female,
all creeds, all colors. That's how broad we are.
Chat with our representative on campus or drop a note
about yourself to Director,* Business and Technical Per-
sonnel Department, Eastman Kodak Company, Roch-
ester, N.Y. 14650.
*The engineer who previously occupied that position has been
promoted to associate director of the Photo Technology Division.
One of his former assistants then moved up to the job.
The general public knows us for
snapshots and home movies. We like
it that way. Actually, 72% of our
sales comes from elsewhere.

Young Man!
A modern fable with
technical overtones
Once there was a young college sen-
• ior named Jack who wanted desper-
\wL I ately to climb the beanstalk of
I success, facing the kind of challenges
his forefathers faced on the frontiers
of early America.
But Jack wasn't sure which kind
of beanstalk he wanted to climb.
His mother wanted him to take a
job at the local store so he'd be close
to home.
His friends urged him to join a
protest movement.
His professors wanted him to go
on to graduate school.
Then Jack met a Mr. Greeley
from Westinghouse. Mr. Greeley was
a recruiter of college students. He
was a kindly man with a warm smile,
and he explained how Jack could
get an advanced tuition-free degree
while working at Westinghouse.
Mr. Greeley also explained that
Westinghouse, being a giant organi-
zation, was in a much better position
than most to undertake projects that
would benefit the less fortunate
iA^HI peoples of the world.
Mr. Greeley's advice was:
"Go Westinghouse, young man!"
And Jack did.
Given a choice of six large oper-
ating groups* within Westinghouse,
Jack elected to join the Atomic, De-
fense and Space Group and was
promptly assigned to work on an
oceanographic project.
A fast learner, Jack took root quickly, reassuring his
graying but still pleasant-faced mother, "Don't worry,
Mom, I'm on my way to the top."
Though officially a trainee, Jack was a big help in the
development of Deepstar—a Jules Verne-like underscas ve-
hicle designed to explore the ocean depths. One of Deep-
star's many missions was to search for food sources to meet
the growing needs of a hungry world.
The project was an enormous success; Jack's manage-
ment was delighted.
But before a grateful unesco could honor him publicly,
Jack obtained a transfer to one of the many space projects
Westinghouse coordinates.
Jack's assignment: help develop a rendezvous system for
Gemini capsules.
To the news publications of the nation, this was the
story of the year. In fact, one of the big syndicates assigned
their most beautiful, technically oriented woman reporter
to get an exclusive story from
Jack ... at any cost.
One night while returning
from work . . . Jack was ac-
costed by the beautiful young
newswoman, who suggested
that Jack give her an exclu-
sive bylined story de-
scribing the project in
detail.
Though taken aback
by her beauty, Jack
never lost sight of his
duty. He pleaded with
the reporter to hold her
story until after the
launching. She agreed on tin-
condition thatjack would pro-
vide her with enough informa-
tion for a subsequent story
that would win her a Pulitzer
Prize for news reporting.
The pressure on Jack and
his closely knit engineering team tightened. By day, they'd
work on the space guidance system; by night. Jack would
feed background information to the beautiful, technically
a w ^ oriented reporter. It was hard work, but
,{ was important work.
^^B^f^P^. Finally the day arrived fur which the
^^^k W world had long waited. America's two
"capsules rendezvoused successfully. Man-
kind was now assured of a stairway to the stars.
While television-viewing millions rejoiced, Jack was as
good as his word, offering the beautiful lady reporter the
story she wanted so badly.
However, the girl, now smitten with
Jack, turned her back on the Pulitzer
Prize, preferring instead to join Westing-
house, attend its Advanced Education
School and obtain a degree in engineer-
ing. (Women are welcome at Westing-
house, an equal opportunity employer.)
Now they both work at Westinghouse
—while Jack designs atomic reactors for America's newest
missile-firing submarines, his beautiful
ex-reporter wife, an education specialist,
helps train Peace Corps volunteers for
overseas duty—and they're only a bean's
throw from the neat white cottage they
share with his mother.
And they all lived happily ever after.
Moral: By planting your career seeds with
Westinghouse, you, too, can climb the bean-
stalk of success, overcoming giant obstacles
and earning a lot oj golden rewards.
You can be sure if it's Westinghouse

Westinghouse who will be visiting your campus during the

"I'm a metallurgist...doing commercial
development... of plastic packaging.
That's Phillips diversity."
"Being a metallurgist at an oil company
seems strange enough. And when you add
that I'm a Commercial Development En-
gineer, primarily dealing with plastic
packaging, it sounds pretty improbable.
It would be, anywhere but Phillips.
"Actually, when I started at Phillips, I
worked on pipe. My interest led me from
just metals into cement-lined pipe and
other products, such as plastics. Then,
realizing what some of the new materials
could do, I involved myself more and more
in expanding their use. This in turn re-
sulted in my moving to the Commercial
Development Division. You see, the chain
of interests has its own logic.
"But when I was graduating from the
University of Illinois, I couldn't have fore-
seen that my interests would lead this
way. It took a company as big, as diverse,
and as flexible as Phillips to help me find
out what I wanted. And then to help me
do something about it.
"The company helped me in another
way, too. 1 felt a need to take responsible
action in my community. I joined the
Jaycees in the course of my outside ac-
tivities and was elected National Presi-
dent. I'd say it was worth a Ph. D. in human
relations. Phillips encouraged me all the
way. Even to giving me leave of absence.
Now, that's an unusual company."
Some other examples of the diversity
of Phillips include: petroleum exploration
and refining ... hydrocarbon research...
synthetic rubber . . . carbon black . ..
plastics and textile development... fer-
tilizers . . . LP-gas . . . and many more.

pany, 104 F. P. Bldg., Bartlesville, Okla-

Which degree counts most?
Besides a B.S., M.S., M.B.A., Ph.D. —or what have you —there
are other degrees vital to your future. The degree of imagina-
tion. Ambition. Responsibility.
If you have them in good measure, we know of no company
better able, or more disposed, to reward them. Handsomely.
In terms of professional recognition, intellectually stimulating
environment, and material reward.
We're big. But we're still young and growing. And plan to keep
on. In 1965, for example, our sales rose 23%. To over $860
million. And 516 million in the first half of '66.
We need top-notch people who can grow with us. People
who are well trained in chemistry, physics, chemical, elec-
trical, or mechanical engineering, marketing or finance.
And who have that extra degree.
Talk it over with your faculty and Placement Officer. And re-
gardless of your military commitments, be sure to see our rep-
resentative when he is on your campus. Or

Operating deep down in liquid helium, u few degrees above absolute zero,
the RCA experimental memory plane in the dewar is storing and
discharging information in the form of persistent circulating
supercurrents. In this state of zero resistance, thousands of memory bits
are executing "read-write" cycles at pre selected time intervals—ranging
from less than 0.5 microsecond to infinity, or just as long as the plane is
held in a superconductive state. At the right, a typical experimental RCA
cryoelectric memory plane with 64 binary bits is shown in actual size.
RCA Knows HOW in Electronic Components and Devices
You are facing a very important decision. When you
select the company that you want to join, consider how
important it is for your future career to join the leader.
For example, in this one area alone—Electronic Com-
ponents and Devices—you will find that RCA has set
standards of engineering excellence, in an environment
for learning, that is second to none.
EE, ME and IE opportunities exist for all degree
levels in every phase of research, design and develop-
ment, information systems, manufacturing, computer
marketing, and purchasing with RCA.
Another consideration — we believe in individual
growth. There are training programs, graduate educa-
tion programs, and in-house courses—all designed to
encourage your individual development and growth.
In addition, you will work in a distinguished scientific.
and engineering environment.
You owe it to yourself to find out more about the
great range of activities at RCA. See your college
placement director, or write to College Relations,

Jersey 08101.
Whatever your field of interest—we would like to

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Michigan is a student technical
achievement which is unmatched by
any other on campus. From a one
room studio built in 1948 in the base-
ment of West Quad, the station has
progressed a long way to its new
studios, formally dedicated at the be-
ginning of the 1965 school year, in the
basement of the Student Activities
Building.
The fourteen room layout, which
covers 1800 square feet, includes three
executive offices, a general office area,
a news, weather, and sports room
equipped with a UPI teletype, a rec-
ord library which is cross-referenced
in six different ways, an engineering
room for the maintenance and con-
struction of equipment, a production
room, a studio, a combo room, a
master control room and two small
announce booths.
WCBN has been able to finance its
operation through the sale of adver-
tising luhich for the 1964-1965 fiscal
year was $17,530 with profits of over
$9,000. It is hoped that these sales will
climb to $25,000.
Although WCBN's accomplish-
ments have been outstanding in all
fields of broadcasting the following
pictures illustrate the achievements of
the engineering staff in the construc-
tion of the new station.
The combo room is the most versatile broadcast studio in the station. It is
designed to be easily operated by one person. Among its features are two
tape cartridge players, a one channel control board, a built-in push-button
phone, and remote control starts-and-stops for the cartridge players and the
turntables.


activity at WCBN. Its most interesting
feature is the two-channel control
board which permits simultaneous
operation of two activities. From the
master control room one can control
the studio seen in the background and
two separate new-broadcast rooms,
the windows of which are on either
side of the clock.
The tap cartridge recorder-player is one of the out-
standing pieces of equipment at WCBN. The device
features a continuous loop tape with automatic cuing
which stops the tape when it is ready to be played
again. Although most radio stations buy this type of
equipment this particular cartridge machine is com-
pletely student built. The cartridge machine gives
great versatility to the individual broadcaster since
it brings advertising and program introductions to
his finger-tips.

four cylinders at the top of the complex are the power
supply for the amps and preamps on the station con-
trol boards. The six transformers immediately below
are the power and back-up power supplies for the
monitor amplifiers located immediately below. Below
these are the transformers which control the lights
on the control boards and the muting relays which
turn off the speakers in a studio when a microphone
is on.
The production room control board, which will serve in the
production of ads, special background effects and prerecorded
programming, will soon be completed and installed. The con-
trol board is completely transistorized and features plug-in,
replaceable pre-amps and program amplifiers. The ability to
replace vital parts gives the control board increased flexibility
since component failures are easily repaired. Other features
of the board are remote control starts and stops for tape
recorders and record turntables.

Attention to detail is an old
Bell System habit. Or maybe you call
it thoroughness. Or follow-through.
Anyway, we attended to an interesting
detail recently-the effect of rain
on the microwave link between a
communications satellite and our
pioneer ground station antenna
at Andover, Maine.
If we could but measure the rain's
effect, we could improve the design
of satellite ground stations.
The question was how.
Well, you often have to take your
laboratory tools where you find them,
and in this case we found ours in
Cassiopeia A, a strong and stable
radio star that is always visible from
Andover. We measured the noise
power from Cassiopeia A during dry
periods, and then measured the
reduction during rainy periods. The
result could be expressed as a
formula and employed accurately in
designing future ground stations.
The initial success of our Telstar"
satellites proved the feasibility
of communicating via space.
But it also opened the door-or the
heavens—to a whole new technology
which we are now busily
exploring in every detail.
In space, on land or beneath the sea
— wherever we operate—we go into
things thoroughly.
Sometimes we know when not
to come in out of the rain.

The job of management is to organize and make decisions. There are many
patterns of organization which have evolved during the years, which are fol-
lowed by business leaders today. The obviously sophisticated patterns of man-
agement decision making have been derveloping rapidly. Never before, how-
ever, has there been such an advanced set of aids to the business man as
Operations Research. OR gives management its first significant handle on
q ualifying objectives.
Why Is Operations Research Needed?
Operations Research has developed
due to a need for more objectivity and
less superfluous answers. As in all
walks of life, the business world has
been plagued with a tremendous
growth in ideas and problems. OR
has been an obvious outgrowth of
methods needed to clarify goals and
handle the greater complexity of mod-
ern business.
OR is complimentary to the bus-
ness man of today, not competitive.
It is an aid to managers—not a sub-
stitute for managers. Operations Re-
search is an interdisciplinary collec-
tion of scientific and mathematical
methods which can be applied to
problem solving. In order to under-
stand it more fully let us see how it
developed.
Historical Development of OR
The term "Operational Research"
was coined by the British during
World War II. It was the name ap-
plied to the War Operations work
being carried out by a group of scien-
tists who were studying radar detec-
tion methods. The English were con-
cerned with discriminating between
noise and targets on the radar screens
and thus extending the range and
warning capabilities of radar systems.
"Operational Research" teams in
the war effort were developed in var-
ious other fields of study, such as sub-
marine detection and shell trajectory.
It was found extremely valuable to
be able to use perhaps a mathemati-
cian, an accountant, a chemist, a
physicist, and an electrical engineer,
all on one team, using an interdisci-
plinary approach to solving a com-
mon problem.
The United States soon develo|)ed
the same kind of an effort toward
solving wartime problems. To give
an example of the si/e of the United
States efforts following the war, the
Rand group had 433 staff members
from seventeen different fields.
After the war, business applications
began and by 1950 several hundred
projects were being carried out by
large companies. A great deal of this
work was and still is carried out in
secrecy and therefore publicity has
not been too great.
The Use of OR
There is a great deal of reluctance
toward using OR. This reluctance
stems mostly from the executives who
feel they would relinquish power or
capability to the use of formulae.
Some businessmen claim there are too
many factors or too many intangibles
for OR to be applied to their areas.
The facts are that OR will not answer
any business problems or make an\
decisions. OR will aid in business de-
cisions and give a firm foundation
upon which to answer questions.
Most kinds of business problems fit
into one of the following six areas:
1. Marketing
2. Inventory
3. Strategy
4. Financial Management
5. Personnel
6. Research and development
Operations Research analysts stud\
a problem with three basic thoughts
in mind. First they tend to be system
oriented and try to keep "within the
big picture" of the company objec-
tives. Second, they use interdisciplin-
ary (or mixed) teams and strategies
and third, they endeavor to follow a
scientific approach to quantify and
define objectives.
The basic objectives of a business
are to retain things which are now
available and obtain things which are
not now available. These may be re-
sources such as time, money, and en-
ergy or states such as share of the
20

market, product leadership and pub-
lic acceptance. OR aids immearsur-
ably in these efforts.
Basic Technique of OR
Usually, the operations research anal-
ysts attempt to define objectives in
the form of a mathematical model.
"This is done by a great deal of dis-
cussion and perhaps a significant
amount of data collection. Once a
model has been developed the form
of the problem becomes exposed and
one or more of many mathematical
techniques can be used on the model.
The resulting abstract answers can
then be interpreted by the managers
and decisions can be made. Hence we
have a sort of joint venture (not un-
like that of design engineering)
where a problem is defined and an-
swered and the final product is used
by the managers with the overall com-
pany objectives in mind.
Methods Which Can Be Used
Most business problems seem to
lit into one of eight categories of
model development. The basic models
ire:
I. Inventory—This can be any idle
'-esource such as men, material, money
jr machines. These can all be used
properly to obtain something else of
value. For a problem to exist we must
have 1) costs wrhich increase as in-
ventory increases, and 2) costs which
decrease as inventory increases. The
optimization of these two variables is
the major objective to be considered
in this type of problem.
An example would be a study to
determine at what point a production
process inventory should be held, to
maximize profit and minimize out-
ages and customers dissatisfaction. A
multi-level inventory problem may
be considered when we think of what
amount of stock should be held in
each factory, field warehouse, and dis-
tributorship in order to meet the
company objectives.
These problems are usually solved
by calculus, probability theory, matrix
algebra (linear programming), cal-
culus of variation (dynamic program-
ming) and simulation.
2. Allocation — Distribution of re-
sources in a way that woidd have re-
sources available to be used in the
most efficient manner is another
prime objective of management. We
would like to handle the most jobs
with the least capital expenditure.
For example there may be various
routes, sizes of trucks and practical
time for delivery. The optimum would
be to have all deliveries made using
the best vehicle for the job, accord-
ing to a specific schedule.
We may also have several decisions
to make regarding which machines
should be used for which products.
These may be allocated in the most
practical way to save time and money.
Allocation problems arc usually
solved by mathematical program-
ming; linear, non-linear, stochastic,
parametric and dynamic.
3. Queuing Problems—(from the Eng-
lish word Queue—meaning "line")
These problems arise when service
times of facilities are studied. Here we
study "customers" passing through a
"service." The idea is to minimize idle
service facilities, overhead investment,
personnel and associated costs. Thus
we are considering a sort of "maximi-
zation of service" whether it be in
loading ships with a questionable
number of cranes or deciding how
many cash registers are needed in a
super market.
In the ship loading example we
may study the effect of tides on access
to docks, the various sizes of docks and
number of cranes and the resultant
maximization of service to the ships.
In the case of the supermarket cash
slOVEMBER 1966
21


some statistical sampling related to
existing facilities and therefore plan
an optimum number of cash registers.
Queuing problems are solved by
simulation, probability theory and
differential and integral equations.
4. Sequencing problems—These come
about when we try to select a queue
discipline so that some appropriate
measure of performance is minimized.
It is the study of system priorities in
such a way that "customers" are served
in a specific order so that total time is
minimized. There are various types
of sequencing problems, perhaps best
shown by examples.
A job shop which does machine
shop work can be simulated mathe-
matically. Knowing the orders for the
following week perhaps l.r&gt;0 "trial
runs" can be simulated on a Saturday
morning. The simulation takes into
account machine breakdowns, short-
ages of materials, absenteeism, vary-
ing production rates, etc. and gives
the most practical schedule plan to
use for the upcoming week. To give
an example of the complexity that is
considered, we would note that if we
had ten jobs to run on two machines
there are 3,700,00 ways to sequence
the job. Obviously, some of the ways
are better than others.
An area of consideration which is
gaining considerable impetus is Pro-
grammed Evaluation Review Tech-
nique (PERT) and Critical Path
Method (CPM). T hese techniques in-
dicate where to allocate parallel ef-
fort in order to speed up a project or
meet a certan deadline. Thus if we
were planning a plant expansion pro-
gram we could use PERT to sequence
the program from soil test drillings,
to training of personnel. By using
tested methods we could continually
revise estimates for completion of var-
ious phases of the work. This would
save effort on jobs that need no rush
and allow parallel effort to be ap-
plied to jobs that need to be rushed.
5. Routing Problems—There may be
multiple paths available which can be
used to get a job done. Here we could
use mathematical programming tech-
niques to study such problems as,
which is the shortest route a salesman
should take in order to cover all points
of his territory.
Parallels are easily noted within the
plant when we consider which route
an item such as a combination kitchen
cabinet-sink should take through final
assembly in order that it be handled
the least and still have all parts in
place. Another case for consideration
would be in the automotive industry.
Here wc have multiple model produc-
tion lines with parallel assembly areas
and lixed capacities at each assembly
station. The problem is which route
and sequence should the cars follow
in order for any given assembly sta-
tion (such as the trim area), not to be
bottlenecked.
(i. Replacement Problems—These de-
velop in two categories. One type de-
generates with the passage of time and
use (such as a machine tool). The
second type (such as light bulbs, tubes
and ball jjoint pens) "die" in a sudden
manner.
By the use of dynamic program-
ming these kinds of problems may be
studied in order to maximize utility
from the standpoint of service, capi-
tal investment and replacement cost.
7. Competitive Problems—have been
considered in the past, to be one of
the most nebulous kinds of problems.
These are "games" against nature or
competitors in business. Some termi-
nate at a fixed jx)int and others con-
tinue infinitely.
From past history some facts in a
competitive situation are known. The
future can then be predicted by statis-
tical melthods. (In some cases useful
models have been built up when ab-
solutely nothing was known about the
facts.)
The models developed for these
tcchnicpies have been used in war-
time to predict such things as loca-
tion of striking force, number of
force, and time of strike. Likewise in
industry, game theory models allow a
company to use strategy in advertising
and pricing with competitors. Also it
is used to establish policies on how to
handle union negotiations.
8. Search Problems—These show up
in a myriad of forms in the industrial
situation. There are usually two er-
rors which occur during searches. The
first is failure to detect something
when indeed it is there: usually due
to inadequate coverage- (sampling er-
ror), and second, failure to detect
something when indeed it is there,
because it was not seen (observational
error).
The techniques used were devel-
oped during the war when submarine
detection was a problem. It was found
that by intensively covering statisti-
cally selec ted areas that overall failurt-
in detection was minimized. In bu&gt;i
ness it is noted that auditing proee-J
ures are a parallel example. Another
use occurs in arranging the most logi
cal search routine to use for magnetic
storage of data processing informa-
tion.
Here we have considered how to
find something when we think it i"
there. Next this technique can Ik
inverted and used to study how to
place something so that it will be
found. An example is the study of lo-
cation of goods in a supermarket or
the location of advertising space in a
newspaper or magazine.
We have now covered the various
types of OR problems. We have en-
deavored to show what each type is
like. It was mentioned previcrush
that there are six general areas of
business into which these problems
usually fall. We are now prepared i&lt;&gt;
discuss these logical areas of applies
tion.
Types and Areas of Application
Various examples of OR applica-
tions have already been given. As was
mentioned before, these seem to fall
into the categories of marketing, in-
ventory, strategy, financial manage-
ment, plant and warehouse location
and research and development.
Marketing has been making large-
use of OR by simulation and mathe
matical programming. In simulation
a mathematical model is often de-
veloped which represents a specific
area in which a product is marketed.
By varying some parameters of the
simulation it can be noted which vari-
ables (i.e. advertising by various
means), cause the profit from sales to
increase the most. Mathematical pro-
gramming can also be used for this
purpose.
Similarly, a company can define
which parts of the budget should go
for salesmen, which part toward ad-
vertising, etc. The amount of money
or promotional effect which each po-
tential customer deserves, can also be
studied.
Inventory and Production problem&gt;
have been fairly well outlined at this
point. It might be added that stock
re-order points are one of the most
practical things which can be set with
inventory theory. Other uses include
the selection of the single program
which maximizes profits. Thus, pro-
22

nated in one general study.
Strategy studies have been discussed
some under competitive problems.
The major use of OR in strategy stu-
dies centers about forecasting, diver-
sification and selection of products.
If OR is properly applied it can aid
in design and site selection of plants,
to determine how many plants and
what the mix capabilities should be.
.Also it can be shown how they should
be automated and what kinds of
equipment should be installed. Stu-
dies are run to compare cost of con-
struction, employee training costs, in-
terest on investment, shipping, labor
costs, taxes, cost of moving, transfer
of management, etc.
Financial Management makes use
of OR in the design and selection of
accounting and auditing procedures.
In general, it has been used on all
types of office control including stu-
dies of paper work systems, manual
accounting and office scheduling,
dredit policies have also been de-
veloped and plans for processing de-
linquents and estimating credit risks.
The single greatest use in financial
management has been through the
use of simulation in capital budget-
ing. Several forecasts can be run on
the same simulation to compare long
range results, before they are even
started.
Personnel has made use of OR to
determine what mix of age and skills
is most desirable and what causes acci-
dents. It has also been used to study
absenteeism and labor turnover.
Other sampling routines have been
developed for use in dealing with
c laims and complaints.
Research and Development has
made extensive use of OR in order to
reduce blind trial and error and the
resultant wasted effort. Many statis-
tical prediction methods help to deter-
mine which parameter of a design are
most significant and thus engineers
are led toward more immediate at-
tainment of objectives.
Perhaps the most useful and signi-
ficant single item to a chief executive
is a mathematical model of the organi-
zation. Properly determined it can
predict almost immediately llie effects
of budget changes, prolits, risk poten-
tials, etc. Changes in production
scheduling and many oilier factors
can be analyzed for availability in a
very short time.
Quantifying Objectives for
OR Analysis
Most real world problems have a
large number of factors which influ-
ence the situation. The influence from
some of these factors is insignificant
while others are very important. It
is the job of the OR analyst to sort
out these factors, in order to develop
an effective model and give manage-
ment the answers they need for de-
c s-ions.
The OR analyst can make two basic
kinds of errors. The first is a mistake
in the logic in the process of reason-
ing from premises to conclusions to
solutions. The analyst must use many
significance tests in order to guard
against this kind of error. The second
kind of mistakes are that of selecting
the wrong variables or not enough of
the significant variables. The only way
to guard against this is to include all
conceivably pertinent variables and
then test their need.
A model may be very simple as in
some yes and no decision processes or
the model may be so complex that a
large computer may be needed to
solve it. It is warned however that
regardless of the effort or experience
of OR people, the executive should
never become the captive of a quanti-
tative model. Properly determined
and properly evaluated and applied,
however, the OR models can far
exceed the scope of the human mind.
How to Initiate Operations Research
OR can easily be tried in an organi-
zation. It is recommended that the
gross of the organization exceed per-
haps $10-20 million per year, in order
to support OR efforts.
The most practical way to try OR
is to hire a consulting group that is
familiar with the area. This way a
very small and fruitful project can be
selected which is rather certain to pay
lor itself. Usually a consulting group
will arrange a two or three month ex-
ploratory period, to see if OR is feas-
ible. An exploratory plan is very prac-
tical, especially il there is no specific
problem at hand.
The Future of OR
The techniques of Operations Re-
search are now being refined. OR is
what you make of it. It can be reli-
gated to simple problems without
sophistication or it may be used by
skillful people and prove invaluable
to management decision making.
Presently a lack of skilled people in
the area prevents any rapid growth of
OR teams. Secrecy has also stunted
OR since its nature is inherently
vague and its use is powerful and
worth covering up. Most available in-
formation comes directly from consul-
tants.
Operations Research is winning the
confidence of many managers. These
managers realize that OR is commen-
surate with overall company objec-
tives. Thus OR is being accepted in a
position near the top level in manage-
ment where communication is direct
to the chief executives.
As OR grows in acceptance, the
managers will become more free to
evaluate and make large decisions.
Most of the data handling will go on
within OR groups. Some managers
will accept the challenge of OR while
others will choose only to follow de-
fensively.

Marked changes are being made in
the sleel industry. Capital expendi-
tures approaching two billion dollars
annually are being directed toward
updating present facilities, building
new plants, and installing recently
developed processes. This article sum-
marizes highlights of the technological
revolution taking place in this basic
industry.
In the January H)65 issue of For-
tune magazine, one reads "The com-
lortable old world of the open-hearth
furnace and business-as-usual is being
shaken by vacuum-degassing units,
continuous casting, oxygen-injection

puters." This statement summarizes
the current revolution in the steel in-
dustry. The following paragraphs de-
scribe these new developments and
their influence on steelmaking opera-
tions, economic potential for the pro-
cesses, and the advantages of inte-
grating these processes into a modern
steelmaking plant.
BLAST FURNACE
During the past 25 years a con-
siderable effort has been expended in
increasing the productivity and effi-
ciency of the iron blast furnace. Sev-
eral improvements have led to in-
creases in production, such as higher
temperatures for the air blown into
the furnace. The top pressure of the
furnace has been increased such that
a greater amount of air can be blown
through the furnace at the same
lineal velocities. Injection of fuels,
such as oil and natural gas, with the
blast provide a lower coke require-
ment and increase furnace production.
The introduction of self-fluxing sinter
in which the sintered ore fines are
mixed with the calcium oxide and
charged to the furnace has also in-
creased production. This prepared
product, which includes the important
component of the limestone charge
as well as the ore, has provided
smoother and more efficient furnace
operation. However, of all of the
improvements attempted on the blast
furnace, the most significant and
startling was the introduction of pel-
lets.
The up-grading of ores which are
not sufficiently rich for direct pro-
cessing is a problem faced by all of
(he mineral-metal industries. In the
upper peninsula of Michigan and in
Wisconsin and Minnesota, there are
extensive quantities of "low grade'
ore, containing an average of 20-.SO',

iron. This iron content is low com-
pared to a very pure ore which might
contain as high as 70% iron, whereas,
most ores being used directly are over
50% iron, with the better grades as
high as 60% iron. The interest in uti-
lizing the low grade ores in iron pro-
duction extends back to the turn of
the century and even before. Exten-
sive exploration for iron ores in the
Wisconsin-Minnesota-Upper Michigan
area began about 1860, and in 1892
the word "taconite" was attached to
a low grade ore in the form of hard
rock which contained fine particles
of iron ore.
The direct use of taconite in the
blast furnace for smelting into iron
is not possible because of the large
quantity of impurities. In taconite,
the iron oxide particles are quite fine
and may be present in either mag-
netic (Fe:i04) or non-magnetic
(Fe203) form. Four types are illus-

sents a high grade magnetite which
could be included in the concentrate
to be prepared for charging to the
blast furnace. Particle D is an un-
usable gangue material which should
be discarded. Particles B and C show
two types of intermediate conditions.
They both contain sufficient iron ore
so they should be retained, but too
much gangue to be used as concen-
trate. If particle B were crushed finer,
for example along the dotted lines,
pieces would be produced that would
be sufficiently rich in iron ore to be
included with Particle A. Particle C,
however, would not be concentrated
by further crushing, and even though
it contains an appreciable amount of
iron, it is not a usable material. A
typical system for preparing \/2 to 1
inch in diameter pellets for charging
to the blast furnace is shown in
Figure 2. Magnetic separators are
shown which may be used on magnetic
ores. Flotation units also are often
employed for separating the iron ore
from the gangue.
The development of the pellet has
stemmed from laboratory research at
the Mines Experiment Station of the
University of Minnesota over the past
50 years. This research actually came
to fruition in the summer of 1960 with
a plant test at the Bellefonte furnace
of Armco Steel Corporation, Middle-
town, Ohio. The Bellefonte furnace
was rated at about 1500 tons per day.
After charging pellets to this furnace,
plant personnel experienced several
30 day periods in which the average
tonnage reached 2700-2800 tons per
day. Pellets had increased the produc-
tion by 60% while using 27% less
fuel! Higher blowing rates and lower
slag volumes were simultaneously ex-
perienced. This increase in blast fur-
nace production has dramatically
raised the productivity of this high
capital cost unit.
DEVELOPMENTS IN
STEELMAKING
The open-hearth furnace, which
refines a charge of molten pig iron
from the blast furnace along with
steel scrap, was the standard of the
industry until about 10 years ago
when the first oxygen steelmaking
plant in the United States was in-
stalled at McLouth Steel Corporation
in Trenton, Michigan (see cover pic-
ture) . The development of the Linde-
Frankel process for separating air into
oxygen and nitrogen by low tempera-
ture distillation provided a means by
which tonnage oxygen could be pro-
duced at a low cost. This led to the
development of the oxygen steelmak-
ing process, which was first practiced
at Gerlafingen, Switzerland, and later
scaled to higher production units at
Linz, Austria in the early 1950's.
The process involves an oxygen jet
which impinges on a molten iron bath.
No fuel is used and the only heat
input to the process is generated by
the purifying reactions between the
oxygen jet and the metal bath. One
operating difficulty encountered is
that large quantities of fume are
generated, and consequently, expen-
sive gas cleaning systems have become
an integral part of the oxygen steel-
making plant. The scrap requirement
is limited in the oxygen steelmaking
process, scrap consumption ranging
from about 25 to slightly over 30%
of the total charge. This usage cor-
responds approximately to the recycle
rate in a steel plant, and has di-
minished the requirement for pur-
chased scrap. This has created some
pressures in the scrap market and has
led, under most circumstances, to
lower scrap prices.
In spite of advances made in oxy-
gen steelmaking, the open-hearth
furnace is still the largest production
unit for steel in the United States,
and has been modified and its opera-
tion improved through the use of
tonnage oxygen. A modern open-
hearth furnace is illustrated in Figure
3. The use of supplementary oxygen
has increased the open-hearth refining
time, with heat times now as low as
4-6 hours.
DEGASSING OF STEEL
The improvement of steel quality
has created considerable interest, par-
ticularly by achieving various degrees
of oxygen control or "deoxidation"

Reliability is the probability of
performing without failure. And re-
liability of a system—such as an elec-
trical system, engine or transmission-
equals the reliability of each part
multiplied by every other. And the
reliability of each part is a percentage
less than unity (or 100 per cent).
Thus if a system consists of 50 parts,
each of which is 99 percent reliable
(a very high reliability), total reli-
ability of the system equals 99 percent
multiplied by itself 50 times.
The system's total reliability then
drops to 60 percent.
In spite of such technical difficulties,
automobile companies have made sub-
stantial progress in increasing reli-
ability of their products, the U of M
expert notes. Their warranties at-
test to this.
This is the "acid test for any auto-
mobile company," Lipson says. "The
ompany would be not only in danger
of losing customer acceptance if parts
were unreliable, but it would also
stand immediate financial loss in
servicing the warranty it placed on its
product."
The most critical parts as far as
safety is concerned?
"First, the steering system and sus-
pension system, including tires," says
Prof. Lipson, "and the the brakes."
Driver's themselves can help keep
reliability high by properly main-
taining their vehicles, he points out.
"But drivers, being human, fre-
quently don't do so," Lipson con
cedes.
"So the goal of a reliability pro-
gram must be to produce parts so
reliable that the effect of driver ne-
glect is minimized."
DESKTOP MEASUREMENT LAB
Developing a smaller, less expensive
laboratory for chemical engineering
students—and making the course more
interesting in the process—has helped
win an award for a University of
Michigan professor.
fames O. Wilkes of the U-M chem-
ical engineering faculty was one
five University teachers who recei\t!
Distinguished Service Awards from
U-M President Harlan Hatcher re-
cently.
Wilkes was cited for developing
mathematics for use in chemical en-
gineering studies and the laboratory
which, his citation said, "ma\ well
serve as a model for other schools .
The new laboratory requires le»
space and is cheaper to operate than
the old. By making experiments desk
top size instead of room size, both
equipment costs and running &gt; -
were reduced.
For example, Wilkes explains, one
experiment required a chemical re
actor that held 15 gallons ol chemicals.
34
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


By reducing this to desk-top size, it
now holds only a pint of liquid—a
savings of 120 times in the amount
of chemicals used.
Yet the same reactions could be
studied.
And students now concentrate on
studying basic principles of chemical
engineering processes, rather than
merely taking physical measurements.
The new rate operations laboratory
is designed to illustrate the funda-
mental principles underlying momen-
tum, heat, and mass transfer, and
reaction kinetics. It includes experi-
ments dealing with pipe friction, flow
through orifices, unsteady state heat
conduction, ion exchange, gas ab-
sorption, saponification of ethyl ace-
tate, and other topics.
The rate operations laboratory has
partly replaced an older measurements
laboratory which was primarily con-
cened with the determination of physi-
cal properties and the techniques
needed for such purposes. The meas-
urements laboratory involved gas
analysis, determination of heat of
solution, molecular weights, etc.
Moreover, the students are required
—as are all engineering students at the
U of M—to use a large computer to
solve several of the equations and
problems which arise from their lab-
oratory assignments.
There are three laboratories, match-
ed with three lecture courses. Wilkes
points out.
The old laboratories had larger
equipment in order to give exper-
ience with the kind of equipment
the students will use in industry,
the U-M professor explained. Such
large, commercial type equipment
was not as efficient or effective in
teaching fundamental principles as
the three new laboratories. However,
the students will still take a fourth
laboratory in which they use equip-
ment of semi-commercial size and
industrial character.
Last year Wilkes also won the
class of 38E award as the outstanding
young engineering faculty member.
NEW DEPARTMENT
CHAIRMEN
Prof. John A. Clark was appointed
chairman of The University of Michi-
gan mechanical engineering depart-
ment by the U-M Regents today.
Prof. Clark succeeds Prof. Arthur
G. Hansen, who left to become clean
of engineering at Georgia Institute
of Technology.
Known for his studies of heat
transfer and thermodynamics in large-
rocket engines, Prof. Clark has headed
department's heat transfer laboratory
since joining the U-M faculty in 1957.
Prior to that he taught at Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology since
1950 and had been associate director
of its heat transfer laboratory since
1954.
Prof. Clark earned his master of
science degree in 19-19 and his doctor

FACTORS
■n ENGINEERING
With the passage of time, engineers
become more aware thai dealing witli
people must be part of their art and I a . I u I
science. by Arthur Marks
A compulsory partnership has been
developed—the partnership of man
and machine. Stuck with this and the
increasing complexity of machine
systems, engineers have become deeply
involved in the study of how man and
machine operate together.
The first studies were instituted
during World War II when psychol-
ogists, physiologists, physicists, design
engineers, motion-and-time engineers
were all brought together to make
complex machinery that would be
practical for human use. A science
developed. It went by many names:
human factors, human engineering,
human factors engineering, applied
experimental psychology, ergonomics,
to name a few; but they were all
dedicated to the development of a
science that would design machines
which could be adequately controlled
by human operators.
Specifically, the aim of this early
research was to alleviate the heavy
demands that radar, sonar, and fast
airplanes placed on their human
operators. It marked the beginning
of the design of machines to match
men, rather than the selection and
training of certain men to match the
machine. The basic idea was to design
machines that could be operated by
anyone and with a minimum of train-
ing.
Human factors engineering has al-
ready had a considerable impact. The
space program is an ideal example.
How is a capsule or rocket designed so
that a man can survive in outer space?
How much acceleration can a man
take? From which direction can he
best take that acceleration? What hap-
pens to his senses when he undergoes
acceleration? These questions, and
more like them, have been answered.
Many more have not.
Everytime you use a machine of
any type, ask yourself the question:
"Is this machine designed so that it
can be most easily operated?" The
answer is usually no, because design-
ers forget the human operator and
consider only costs. In every home
there is an electric or gas stove. Look
at the controls. Does the operator have
to reach over hot burners to use the
controls? Does a quick glance reveal
whether any of the burners are on?
How much time does the operator
spend deciding which control goes
with which burner? Chances are the
human operator has not been given
full consideration.
Another common machine system
is our nation's highways. Human fac-
tors in the design of both highways
and automobiles have been overlook-
ed. Signs on the highways are often
difficult to read and their meaning
varies from state to state. Red lights
are hard to see at night, but can't be
changed because of convention. Little
signs on the corner tell you not to
turn from 4-6 p.m., but you don't
see them until after the ticket is being
written. It is a very complex system
that is in need of redesign. In Europe,
the first attempt at this is the stan-
dardization of symbolic road signs.
The number of accidents caused by
confusion had been so high that the
populace finally did something about
the problem.
What about the design of cars
themselves. How many things can
you spot that were not designed with
the human operator in mind? Wiper,
headlights and radio controls are all
of the same shape. This means that a
driver will have to locate the right
control by sight whe nhe should have
his eyes on the road. Controls of
different shapes allow location by
touch. Rearview mirrors cannot be
used when someone sits in the center
seat. The driver behind you cannot
see your brakelights (they are too
low) if he is too close. Designers for-
got the human factor, but the number
of highway fatalities has caused the
legislature to make them remember
it. Manufacturers will find out how to
design a "safer" car from human
factors engineers.
The correct designing of controls
and displays represents a key area in
human factors engineering. Controls
and displays are the interface, the
point of contact, between man and
machine. A control is how a man
makes a machine do what he wants
it to, a display tells the operator what
the machine is doing. Controls must
be designed to respond quickly and
accurately. Displays must reveal in-
formation about the system with
speed and clarity.
All engineers should educate them-
selves in this rapidly growing and
highly necessary field. Three periodi-
cals especially devoted to human fac-
tors are:
Ergonomics
IRE Transactions on Human Fac-
tors in Electronics
Journal of the Human Factors So-
ciety

One of the areas of research in which the Department of Meteorology and Oceanography is engaged is the effects of the Great Lakes on
the weather and the influence of weather on the currents and temperature of the Lakes. Satellite photographs, instrumented towers, and
research vessels provide complimentary information for use in these studies.
Meteorology and oceanography deal with the entire fluid envelope of the earth. While the oceanographer is
concerned with the description and explanation of natural phenomena in all bodies of water ranging from
small streams to the vast oceans, the meteorlogist concerns himself with all scales and aspects of atmospheric
phenomena ranging from the smallest turbulent eddies and microscopic cloud particles to the general circula-
tion of the atmosphere. These are disciplines of great breadth and considerable interaction. The upper boun-
dary of the oceans is also most of the lower boundary of the atmosphere and neither fluid can be adequately
understood without a thorough knowledge of the exchange of heat, momentum and moisture across tha: boun-
dary Furthermore, the basic dynamical aspects of fluid flow on a rotating plant are common to both disciplines.
The oceanographer also deals with the geology of the bottom sedimentation, the chemistry and biology of
the Earth's water bodies. The meteorologist studies the physics of weather phenomena as well as the chemistry
of air pollution and the special chemical effects of solar radiation on the thin upper atmosphere. Thus the edu-
cational programs in meteorology and oceanography integrate studies in a broad range of physical and na-
tural sciences, and mathematics, with the peculiar geophysical problems of the atmosphere and wa'erbodies.
Program options allow a degree of specialization in the dynamical, biological or geophysical aspects of ocean-
ography, in meteorology, or in aeronomy, the study of the upper atmosphere. Many students at the under-
graduate as well as at the graduate levels are afforded opportunities to participate in the Department's diver-
sified research program, thereby enriching their academic program. Among the facilities are four Great Lakes
research vessels.
Meteorologists and oceanographers are in great demand today and attractive employment opportunities
are available in government and industry. As society continues to increase its demands on our natural envi-
ronment, and we become more aware of both the capacity and limitations of the environment to support hu-
man endeavor, the demand for well educated and well trained atmospheric and marine scientists will continue
to expand.

ask a clinical chemist.
Determining the pH, or relative acidity, of a patient's blood
is a routine part of many physical examinations. Until re-
cently, this was a time-consuming process. It involved the
use of a cumbersome water bath to maintain the blood sam-
ple at body temperature. Now all it takes is 15 seconds. Ask
a clinical chemist.
The difference is a new blood pH system designed and
engineered by Corning research. Heart of the system is an
electrode with a glass element that senses the difference in
acidity between the sample and a liquid of standardized pH.
A proportional electronic heater holds the temperature of the
sample to within ±0.01°C of any preselected temperature.
Warm-up time from plug-in is only 3 minutes. An aspirator
provides for quick flushing of the electrode after each use.
Sophisticated instrumentation like this is just one more
example of the new glitter in glass. Today, glass can be made
six times stronger than steel. Or as soft as silk. It can bend or
not bend. Break or not break. Melt or not melt. It can be
molded, cast, machined, drawn and pressed. In short, it pos-
sesses more useful capabilities than any other known material.
For solutions to their materials problems, industry and
government are coming to Corning. Because Corning is the
glassmaster. It's a broad, international company, with one of
the most daring, expert and imaginative research and engi-
neering staffs in the world. Plus a marketing principle that
commits them to developing products only in areas where a
need exists and no product does.

with the use of varcum treatment
rather than by the use of a deoxidiz-
ing agent. There are several such
vacuum treating installations operat-
ing throughout the steel industry. The
use of a deoxidizing agent, such as
aluminum or silicon, produces a cor-
responding oxide, alumina or silica.
These oxides form inclusions which
often remain in the steel, sometimes
marring its surface or affecting its
properties; but by vacuum treating a
steel, carbon monoxide gas is removed,
thus accomplishing the removal of
oxygen without the use of an oxitle
forming element.
One type of degassing unit employs
a process developed by Dortmund
Hcirder Hiittenunion of Germany; it
involves the immersion of a large
refractory "suction bulb" into a ladle
of steel. By applying a vacuum to the
system, which is schematically illus-
trated in Figure 4, the liquid steel is
drawn up into the evacuated vessel
above the ladle. Under this vacuu
carbon monoxide gas is evolved li-
the melt. The vacuum is released y,
the steel is j&gt;ermitted to return tor
ladle. This cycle is repeated until ii:
desired level of deoxidatioa .&lt;
achieved.
A marked decrease in temperatiir-
of the steel is encountered dunrc
this process, and sufficient superhr.
must be put into the steel during ih
steclmaking operation. In Figure
a carbon arc heater is shown, whk:
is intended to supply additional hea:
during the degassing process. Tb
feature has been omitted in mos
installations for operating reasons.
CASTING PROCESSES
Two new casting processes which
threaten to replace standard inftf
casting at some time in the future
are receiving considerable attention it
the industry. There are continue
casting and pressure pouring.
The continuous casting process b
illustrated in Figure 5. Liquid steei
is poured into a water-cooled coppe
mold, forming a slab which is with-
drawn from the water-cooled mol-
down through a water spray zone anu
subsequently to a cut-off station when
the slab is cut into desired length-
Two critical points exist in this open
lion. The first is that a sufficiently
thick skin of steel must be built u|
prior to the time the slab leave*
the water-cooled copper mold. I he
steel skin must be strong enough t
support the head of liquid metal
above it, or a "breakout" occurs,
shutting down the operation. H'e
second critical jx&gt;int is that at tre
oxygen cut-off station, the slab mu&gt;'
be completely solidified to prevent the
cut-off torches from opening a liquid
metal core, which exists in the slab
to a considerable distance below uu
water-cooled copper mold.
Recent improvements in this prore*
have led to continuous casting u'J'
chines which requires less height, the
so-called "vertical with bending." 01
"S-type" machines. The iiistallati""
of these two latter units is much
easier since less height is require'
and normal craneways in the stei"
plant can be used without the nectr
shy ol providing a large excavati"11
or superstructure.

dustry in the United States in re""1'

ustry, at high casting speeds with
uality production.
Another new casting process, par-
icularly applicable to stainless steels,
. the pressure pouring process. Here
igh pressure air is used to force
iquid steel out of the ladle into a
lold made of carbon slabs. The use
f this type of slab mold permits easy
djustment in mold size and provides
n excellent surface quality. This
&gt;rocess is shown schematically in
'igure 6.
Considerable economic advantage
ouhl be realized from these new
asting processes. A high quality slab
s produced with very high yield.
rurthermore, the casting equipment
■liminates the necessity for ingot
nolds and their preparation, and re-
)laces the facilities for stripping the
nolds from the ingots, soaking pits,
md the slabbing mill. The potential
■conomic advantages are sufficient to
lave stimulated the interest of the
ndustry. Several full scale production
acilities are in operation in this
:ountry at the present time for the
production of billets and at least three
nstallations for the production of
large slabs are under construction.
COMPUTER CONTROL
Computer control of iron and steel-
making operations is rapidly taking
hold in the industry. One of the first
control problems attempted by a com-
puter was the control of the basic
oxygen steelmaking process. Success
in this area was limited but has

nevertheless produced encouraging
results in many instances. The current
thinking on control of the oxygen
steel-making process is that new and
improved instrumentation will have
to be achieved so that one can go
from a static-predictive system to a
dynamic system. Although the diffi-
culties of temperature and dust are
hampering efforts in this direction,
several instrument and computer
companies are involved in develop-
ing dynamic control systems, with
success claimed for two installations
of this type.
One of the most successful computer
applications in the steel industry is
computer control of the hot strip
mill. A decrease in occurrance of
"cobbles" or jams on the mill, in-
creased production, and improved con-
trol of strip tolerances are the achieve-
ments of computerized facilities. Also,
several development programs for
computer control of the blast fur-
nace are currently being implemented
and there is every indication that the
computer can be adapted to the needs
of this operation. Other computer
control installations in the industry
are on electric furnaces, galvanizing
and tinning lines, cold strip mills, and
slabbing mills. Considerable develop-
ment work as well is being directed
toward computer control of some of
the more recently developed processes,
such as pelletizing plants and con-
tinuous casting strands.
SUMMARY
The foregoing survey of techno-
logical developments in the steel in-
dustry exemplifies the changes occur-
ring within the industry. Pellets in
the blast furnace, oxygen steelmaking,
vacuum degassing, continuous casting
and computer control have been select-
ed as being representative of the new
developments. High rates of capital
expenditure to install these processes
have caused marked changes in an in-
dustry preparing for the future. ■

RESEARCH EXPENDITURES
Research budget expenditures at
The University of Michigan last year
averaged $1-million per week.
U-M Vice President for Research
A. Geoffrey Norman told University
Regents Friday (Oct. 21) that the
research budget for the 1965-66 fiscal
year was $52 million—the first time
it had exceeded $50 million.
This was an 8.8 per cent increase
over the previous year, he said.
Last year U-M granted 440 doc tor
of philosophy degrees, 3 per cent of
the nation's total, Norman noted. He
said the extent of the University's
research program reflects the quality
of its faculty and academic program.
"We are what we are," Norman
said, "as much because of the Univer-
sity's research enterprise as because of
any other single thing."
Norman noted that an American
Council on Education survey ranked
Michigan's graduate programs among
the nation's 10 best. He added:
"Our high position came about
because so many of our departments
are recognizably strong.
"They are strong because faculty
members in these departments are
productive scholars and are able to
secure financial support for their (re-
search) work from federal agencies
or foundations."
Most of the support—78 per cent
—came from federal agencies, Norman
said. Of these, the largest single source
of support was the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, from
which $12.7 million was obtained.
Defense agencies combined were the
source of $16.1 million.
Norman told the Regents that the
$52 million included only expendi-
tures from research budgets, not train-
ing activities in graduate and pro-
fessional programs.
He said expenditures by areas in
1965-66 were:
% of
Area $ Million total
Engineering sciences 16.4 32
Life sciences 14.0 27
Physical sciences 12.0 23
Social sciences 7.4 14
Norman noted that the trend for
increasing expenditures in research
in the life and social sciences was
continuing at a higher rate than the
others.
About 60 per cent of the $52 million
went for salaries and wages for the
research personnel. These included
700 members of the professorial staff,
partially paid from research funds;
1,500 academic research staff (non-
teaching); 2,900 non-academic: staff
(technicians, programmers, lab as-
sistants, etc.) and 3,600 students-
half of them undergraduate students.
'The large number of students in-
volved represents an important edu-
cational dividend,'' Norman said.
"Often their involvement in a research
project as a means of support deter-
mines their choice of professional
career."
Last years 8.8 per cent volume in-
crease of over the previous years is
a decline in the growth rate, Norman
told the Regents. But he pointed out
that U-M research budget expendi-
tures had doubled over those of six
years ago, and that such growth could
not be expected to continue.
Among factors limiting such growth
are the stabilization of federal
ing and the spreading of
funds to more schools and area
"In addition," he said, "the bum
ings and facilities that were adequJ
10 years ago are no longer adeqml
because of this progress in m
sciences."
One result of this is an increaid
difficulty in recruiting faculty. "T|
attract and hold the sort of £ac
we want, more than salary is necq
sary," Norman said. "The Universi
also must provide the facilities aaj
equipment to permit his research I
go forward successfully."
AUTOMOBILE RELIABILITY
Unlike fine wine or fishing stonq
which improve with age. mechanic
products deteriorate over time.
This means automobiles becomd
less safe with age and use. Just kml
much, no one now knows for certain!
So a University of Michigan mechani-
cal engineering professor, internatio*
ally known for his work on reliabiliij
of parts, is going to find out.
Working with support from tbd
U of M s new $10 million Highway
Safety Research Institute, Prof. Cbafi
les Lipson will carry out the project
with the aim of establishing design
and maintenance standards to insure
cars may be made safer.
"There has been little quantitative
information of how these parts art
affected by passage of time and num-
ber of miles driven," he says. "It »
our goal to investigate what has been
done in this area and what should
be clone to further the cause of safetv."
The Highway Safety Research In-
stitute was established at the Univer-
sity last December with the grant
from General Motors C'&gt;rp., Ford
Motor Co. and the Automobile Manu-
facturers Association. Its goal is to
develop a comprehensive approach io
highway safety. Professor Lipson's
project is one of several directed
toward this goal.
One of his aims is "to develop a
hierarchy of critical parts" so more
emphasis can be placed on parts more
likely to create auto safety problems,
he points out.
But increasing reliability is no
simple task—it pushes technology to
its limits, the U of M engineer notes.
Reliability decreases with complexity,
because as more parts are added the
total reliability of the system becomes
less.

A librarian friend of ours was ap-
proached recently by an obviously dif-
fident young man who asked where
the medical books could be found.
"What particular subject did you
have in mind?" asked our friend, in
an effort to be helpful.
After some embarrassed shuffling,
the young man said that he'd like to
see something on birth control.
"Did you have a particular author
or title in mind?" the librarian per-
sisted.
"No, ma'am," said the young man
desperately, "I don't care about that,
just so it's for beginners."

A man walked up to a vending
machine, put in a coin, and pressed
the button labeled "Coffee, double

the nozzles went into action, sending
forth coffee, cream and sugar. After
the proper amounts had gone down
the drain, the machine turned off.
"Now that's real automation," ex-
claimed the man. "This thing even
drinks it for you."
The bank robber shoved a note ac-

said the other man. "I never did."
A tourist in Nome, Alaska, seeing
his first Eskimo, noticed a native
mother with a blonde, blue-eyed baby

what?" asked the tourist.
"Half Coast Guard," the mother
replied.

Nope, but you gotta age the stuff,
ain't ya?"
Two small boys were in a library
chattering at the top of their voices.
The librarian hurried over. "Ssh! The
people in this room can't read!"
One of the boys looked at her with
sympathy:
"Dropouts, huh?"
The draftee was awakened roughly
by his platoon sergeant after the
rookie's first night in the Army bar-
racks.
"It's 4:30!" roared the sergeant.
"Four-thirty!" gasped the recruit.
"Man, you'd better get to bed. We've
got a big day tomorrow."
Then there was the little boy who
ran to his mother and said, "Daddy
took me to the zoo, and one of the
animals paid $48.40 across the board."
The stern father confronted his
daughter at breakfast. "I saw you
kissing a boy in a car last night,"
he said. "Who was it?'
"What color car?" the girl asked.

tions for the Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowships in engineer-
ing, physics, or mathematics are now available for the academic
year beginning in Autumn 1967.
The program offers the qualified candidate an outstanding
opportunity for study and research at a selected university, plus
professional industrial summer experience at a Hughes facility.
Each Doctoral Fellowship includes tuition, books and thesis
preparation expenses, plus stipend ranging from $2,200 to
$3,100, depending upon the Program year and the number of
candidate's dependents. Full salary is paid the Fellow during his
summer work at Hughes. Salaries are reviewed periodically and
increased with the growth of the individual. Fellowships are
awarded to outstanding students who have completed a master's
degree (or equivalent) and have been accepted as a candidate
for the doctoral degree.
HUGHES MASTERS FELLOWSHIPS. Approximately 100
new awards for '67 '68 are available to qualified applicants with
a baccalaureate degree in engineering, mathematics or physics.
Most of these awards are Work-Study Fellowships; a very lim-
ited number are Full-Study. Upon completion of the Masters
Program, Fellows are eligible to apply for and are given special
consideration for a Hughes Doctoral Fellowship.
Fellows who associate with a Company facility in the Los Angeles
area usually attend the University of Southern California or the
University of California, Los Angeles. Tuition, books and other
academic expenses are paid by the Company, plus a stipend
ranging from $500 to $850 for the academic year. A significant
advantage offered by the Work-Study Program is the opportunity
to acquire professional experience working with highly compe-
tent engineers and scientists while pursuing the M.S. degree.
Selected Fellows have the option to work in several different
assignments during the Fellowship period to help them decide
on their field of concentration and optimum work assignment.
Fellows earn full salary during the summer and pro-rata salary
for 24 hours work a week during the academic year. The com-
bined salary and stipend enables Fellow to enjoy an income in
excess of $6,500 per year during his two years as a Work-Study
Fellow. Salaries are increased commensurate with professional
growth and Fellows are eligible for regular Company benefits.
Work assignments are matched closely to the Fellow's interests.
Primary emphasis at Hughes is research and development in
the field of electronics for application to defense systems and
space technology. Fields of interest include stability and trajec-
tory analysis, energy conversion, structural design and analysis
— computer and reliability technology, circuit and information
theory, plasma electronics, microminiaturization, and human
factor analysis — research, development and product design on
such devices as parametric amplifiers, masers and lasers, micro-
wave tubes, antenna arrays, electron-tube and solid-state dis-
plays, and components — design analysis, integration and test-
ing of space and airborne missile and vehicle systems, infrared
search and tracking systems, and computer, data processing
and display systems — theoretical and experimental work in
solid-state and ion physics.
Citizenship: American citizenship and eligibility for security
clearance are required.

There is a wealth of information
available on a wide-open field that
is soon to become a necessary skill.
"One of the most pressing needs of
the modern scientific community is
that of efficient communication of
scientific theories and research data.
Awareness of existing information is
essential, not only for extending the
benefits that may be derived from
knowledge of the experience of many
researchers. In this era of rapid scien-
tific advances the need for adequate
scientific communication is becoming
increasingly critical and more diffi-
cult to satisfy. No longer is it possible
for the individual investigator to keep
up with all the technical information
in a given field."
-Paul G. Ronco, Donald B. De-
Voe, and Ezra V. Saul, "Docu-
mentation of Human Factors
Engineering Data"
It is my belief that the purpose of
a research paper is to force the student
to seek out some of this valuable
scientific documentation.
This paper is meant to serve as a
guide to further investigation of,
rather than merely an introduction to,
Human Factors Engineering.

The new Federal Water Pollution Control Administra- to attack water pollution nationally, regionally, and
tion has one of the most unique and all-encompassing locally at the same time, doing whatever must be done
missions ever granted a government organization. It is in six basic ways:
1/ AID TO COMMUNITIES—programs offering sanitary, civil, and industrial engineers the opportunity to plan, initiate, and
review grants for waste treatment plants so urgently needed throughout the land.
2/ ENFORCEMENT—because water pollution ignores political boundaries, experts in the field — bacteriologists,
biologists, chemists, hydrologists, sanitary engineers, limnologists, toxicologists, and lawyers, too
—are needed to identify pollutants, locate their source, and work with official and volunteer
groups to promote adherence to standards.
3/ RESEARCH—in thirteen new laboratories that will ultimately operate in critical areas, each dedicated to specific
research tasks or water problems. This gives sanitary engineers, chemists, biologists, bacteriolo-
gists, hydrologisls, geologists, oceanographers, limnologists, soil scientists, epidemiologists, and
toxicologists the chance to attack the problem in their own area, in their particular specialty.
4/ WATER BASIN IMPROVEMENT—comprehensive programs for each of the 9 major river basins, bringing the administrator
the planner, the economist, and the computer expert into the new science of water management
. . . into the building of mathematical models and the use of data collection and retrieval
techniques.
5/ ESTABLISHING WATER QUALITY STANDARDS—vital action to let municipalities, industries, and other water users under-
stand their responsibilities. Scientific and water resource management teams well-versed in the
intricacies of water pollution control and abatement will be needed for FWPCA offices in almost
every State.
6/ TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE—ultimately to be increased many times over in order to cope with new and unexpected problems
ranging from fish kills to contaminated municipal water supplies. Creat versatility on the part of
engineers and scientists will be needed to find adequate, immediate solutions.
DRAMATIC GROWTH ALMOST INEVITABLE
Over 700 career positions—many of them in engineer-
ing—are to be filled this first year. This is just the be-
ginning. What has taken decades to pollute will take
decades to reclaim. During this period, there will be
dramatic growth within the Administration itself, plus

There are slots.
Slots need people to fill them.
Someone exists who was born and educated to fill
each slot.
Find him. Drop him in. Tell him how lucky he is.
Look in once in a while to make sure he still fits
his slot.
This orderly concept has much to commend it, plus one fault:
some of the people most worth finding don't like it. Some very
fine employers have not yet discovered the fault. It is not up to
us to point it out to them. Luckily for us, we needn't be so
tightly bound to the slot system.
We can offer choice. A certain combination of the factors
diversification, size, centralization, and corporate philosophy
makes it feasible to offer so much choice.
Choice at the outset. Choice later on. Choice between quiet
persistence and the bold risks of the insistent innovator. Choice
between theory and practice. Choice between work in the
North and South. Choice between work wanted by the govern-
ment and work wanted directly by families, by business, by
education, by medicine, by science. To the extent that the slot
idea helps channel choice we use it, of course.
A corporation such as this is one means of coordinating the
strength of large numbers of effective persons. You may feel
that in the years ahead this type of organization must change.
You may feel that it must not change. Either way, to get a
chance to steer you have to come on board.
Advice to electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, chemical engi-
neers, chemists, and physicists — still on campus or as much as ten
years past the academic procession: while one starts by filling a slot, it
soon proves more fun to make one. So detailed list of openings ap-

GO WESTINGHOUSE,
YOUNG MAN!
Where a world-full
of projects abound
There was once a college senior named Al Addin who
yearned for his place in the sun.
However, at graduation time so many companies offered
him a job, Al didn't know which one to accept.
Then he met a Mr. Greeley, the recruiter from Westing-
house. Mr. Greeley was a kindly man with a warm smile.
He described to Al how at Westinghouse young men have
their choice of six operating groups* and work in friendly,
tight-knit little teams on the world's most exciting projects.
"Go Westinghouse, young man," Mr. Greeley urged.
And Al Addin did. He wanted to be part of Westinghouse
efforts to help the nation rebuild cities, so he joined the
corporation's Construction Group — supplier of the world's
widest range of products for the construction market.
One day, while Al was polishing a Westinghouse lamp,
a Jeanie appeared. This pretty, warmhearted, intelligent
Jeanie was an engineer with the Elevator Division. (Women
are welcome at Westinghouse, an equal opportunity em-
ployer.) As the daughter of one of the richest men in Amer-
ica, Jeanie was in a position to grant Al Addin three wishes.
Al's first wish — to help Westinghouse build a municipal
complex of apartments, offices, stores and parks within an
established metropolitan area.
Al's contribution to the project was to help develop a
computerized environmental analysis technique — an in-
genious system for precalculating the heating and cooling
needs of all the buildings in the complex. Grateful archi-
tects and consulting engineers voted Al the year's most
calculating supplier.
Al's second wish — to help develop a total transporta-
tion system for a new housing area being built.
Transportation for the new project would consist not
only of a remote-controlled mass transit system, taking
commuters to and from their places of business . . . but
it would also include sophisticated elevator and electric
stairway systems to be installed within the project's ter-
minal and living areas.
Al's third and last wish — to marry Jeanie.
She consented on the condition that he let her join him
on other major projects and urban systems assignments
undertaken by Westinghouse throughout the world.
Al Addin agreed . . . and they lived happily ever after.
MORAL: All your wishes for a prosperous career can be
granted if you join Westinghouse, where awaiting you are
challenges, hard work, building block education, travel,
adventure, and yes, even romance.
You can be sure if it's Westinghouse

Anaconda Wire &amp; Cable Co., and Anaconda Aluminum Co.
Extractive metallurgy is a
key to more metal
The metallurgical bubble bath above is
a flotation cell in a new Anaconda con-
centrator. Although it may seem crude
and simple to a layman, the process in-
volves complex combinations of colloi-
dal and surface chemistry, crystallog-
raphy, physics, and special grinding
methods adapted to the ores at each
individual mine. It represents one way
Anaconda's metallurgical research is
helping make more metal available for
our growing economy.
At Butte, Mont., such research, in rais-
ing recovery of metal from low-grade
ores, is making today's submarginal
material part of tomorrow's ore re-
serves.
As Anaconda's intensified geological
research and exploration turns up new
prospective mineral deposits, the need
for metallurgical research and devel-
opment grows. Each deposit must be
analyzed to determine the feasibility of
recovering its metal. And as research
develops more efficient extraction proc-
esses, lower grade and more complex
deposits can become mines.
To accomplish this, Anaconda is estab-
lishing a central extractive metallurgi-
cal research center at Tucson, Arizona.
It is carefully planned and is being su-
perbly equipped. It is near a large uni-
versity staff, which can be consulted as
needs arise, thus offering a stimulating
environment for progressive research
and development. In turn, this means
attractive new openings for a variety of
engineering talents—not only in metal-
lurgy, but also in chemistry, physics,
and mechanical engineering.
Dynamic test yields new data
on copper-metal springs
Copper metals are among the most
useful spring materials known to man.
The role of modulus of elasticity in this
application was studied at the Research
and Technical Center of Anaconda
American Brass for more precise data
and to make possible predicting spring
performance at various ambient tem-
peratures.
Modulus of elasticity can be deter-
mined by physical testing in tension or
compression. But Anaconda found the
dynamic method (below) easier to per-
form and just as accurate.
Results are of prime importance to de-
signers of spring devices. The signifi-
cantly lower modulus of elasticity for
copper metals means that at the same
level of stress, copper alloy components
will deflect or extend almost twice as
far as components made of steel—usu-
ally with no sacrifice of maximum
stress. This can mean more sensitive
controls—or "softer" action in the ab-
sorption of energy.
This is but one way Anaconda is refin-
ing and broadening knowledge of the
many useful properties of copper met-
The talents and skills of techni-
cally qualified men and women
will always be needed by
Anaconda in important positions
in exploration, mining, extrac-
tive metallurgy, manufacturing,
scientific research, sales, and ad-
ministration.

als. Such research opens vast new op-
portunities for growth—career oppor-
tunities at Anaconda American Brass
for college graduates in all fields of en-
gineering, in business administration,
and sales.
Bright future for a
bright metal
How do you make containers to hold
motor oil or citrus concentrates at low-
er costs? How can you package airline
in-flight meals to enable reconstituting
of foods at very high temperatures for
fast serving—and retain quality and fla-
vor? These are typical questions asked
and answered in the Packaging Devel-
opment Laboratory of Anaconda Alu-
minum.
A growing factor in the aluminum in-
dustry, Anaconda Aluminum is partic-
ularly strong in packaging—with plain
foil, laminated foil and rigid foil con-
tainer products. And it has developed
several firsts in the aluminum industry.
One is the patented foil-fibre container
for motor oil and for citrus concen-
trates. Another is foil containers (see
above) for better airline service in the
jet age. Now frozen and refrigerated
meals can be heated rapidly and served
quickly. Anaconda Aluminum has an
outstanding record of developments
which have had a tremendous impact
on the packaging industry.
Anaconda Aluminum is also a produc-
er of primary aluminum. To meet the
growing demand for the metal in pack-
aging, transportation, electrical, and
building products, Anaconda Alumi-
num has been steadily increasing its
output—is currently expanding its pri-
mary ingot capacity by two-thirds. This
expansion involves an investment of
$50,000,000.
Anaconda Alumium is growing, and
will become an increasingly important
factor in the bright future of the bright
metal. For this it needs people—not
only for its packaging laboratory and
foil operations, but also for its other
fabricating plants and reduction opera-
tions. This means growing opportuni-
ties for metallurgists, chemical engi-
neers, industrial engineers, plant engi-
neers, and system engineers. «»»

WHY? Because applying your knowledge and
stretching your imagination are the hardest—but
most satisfying —kinds of work there are.
And we have a whole grab-bag of problems that
will challenge your abilities and stimulate your pro-
fessional growth.
... For example, we designed and built an auto-
mated drilling vessel that allows us to drill for oil and
gas in water up to 4,000 feet deep.
... Our research has given us a new synthetic elas-
tomer—with the resiliency of rubber and the manu-
facturing versatility of plastic—which does not require
vulcanization.
... We've developed a new hydrocracking process
for vastly increasing the gasoline yield from a barrei
of crude oil.
We've solved these problems.
But we've got many others.
Would you like to consider helping us solve them?

Now tiny glass devices can do what complex electromechani-
cal systems can't. Control the power of a locomotive without
the use of moving parts. And without breakdowns due to short
circuits, wear, heat deterioration and shock. Ask New York
Central.
These devices channel a small volume of fluid (air, gas or
liquid) under low pressure so that it activates a much more
powerful jet of fluid. This in turn helps control the massive
equipment which regulates the locomotive's speed and power.
Fluid devices are finding increasing use as machine and
process controls and in computer logic sections. Corning pro-
duces fluidic devices from its unique FOTOCERAM® photo-
sensitive glass-ceramic, which allows extremely accurate chem-
ical machining.
Today, glass can be made six times stronger than steel. Or as
soft as silk. It can bend or not bend. Break or not break. Melt
or not melt. It can be molded, cast, machined, drawn and
pressed. It possesses more capabilities than any other material.
For solutions to their materials problems, industry and gov-
ernment are coming to Corning. Because Corning is the glass-
master. It's a broad, international company, with one of the
most daring, expert and imaginative research and engineering
staffs in the world. Plus a marketing principle that commits
them to developing products only in areas where a need exists
and no product does.

Engineering students are certainly not noted for their writing
ability. Yet they should be. To be a good engineer, one must be
able to communicate his ideas, to transfer his thought through
words in a manner such that there can be no mistake in understand
ing his plans, even down to the last detail.
The works of many fine poets have been interpreted ami re-
interpreted by scholars who claim to have found the true meaning
of certain poems, but whose ideas as to what this true meaning is
differ greatly. But engineers are not poets. There can be no hidden
meaning in what engineers write. They must write clearly ami
succinctly, carefully including every detail, so that everyone who
reads their plans will interpret the plans exactly as the engineer
want them to.
But if engineers aren't poets they certainly are salesmen. In order
to carry out their ideas, engineers must convince otheis of the need
for their plans. They must be able to defend their course of action.
They must sell themselves as well as their ideas, and they mu&gt;i
build confidence in others that their plans, if carried through, will
be the best possible way to handle any particular situation.
Since writing is such an important aspect in the making of an
engineer, in what ways can an engineer improve his ability to com-
municate? In addition to freshman composition, the University
offers technical writing courses, requires research papers of students
in many courses, and provides activities such as the TECHNIC, the
ARCH, GENERATION, GARGOYLE, and the DAILY, to increase
one's writing skills.
Even more lucrative, monetarily, in getting practice in writing
and excellent advice from qualified people, is the Cooley Essay con-
test. This contest is open to engineers only, and awards total $18W
for the top six essays submitted by University of Michigan College
of Engineering sudents (three awards in each of two categoriev-
Freshmen and Upperclassmen).
What better way is there to increase your own skill in writing
and possibly win hundreds of dollars at the same time? It's a tre-
mendous incentive. Why not try it? If you run into trouble, jiw
call on anyone from the essay committee. Good luck, and take goul
care of that prize money.
Here are the details:
The Cooley Essay Contest — 1966-67
Upperclass Division
Subject: STUDENT POWER. On campuses all over the country, cemir.'.
at the University of Michigan, students are demanding—and in sow
cases getting—greater personal freedom and more active roles in t■"-
decision-making of the university. At the University of Michigan iS~
Student Government Council's vote to separate itselt from the uniu'
sity's Office of Student Affairs is symptomatic of a larger student denu;'jl
lo be heard by, and to exert an influence on, the administration and
faculty. Sit-ins, teach-ins. referendum*, and even class boycott*
methods currently being used by students on many campuses to estabiiv
an effective "voice" within the university.
The purpose of this year's essay contest is to encourage you to defi:-:
that "voice," to delineate the goals as well as the limits of stutic'-'
power. Your conclusions may be supported entirely from your first-!"'"'
experience at the University of Michigan, or you may draw upon:
views of others.

Freshman Division
Subject: MEANING OUT OF CHAOS-A literary work, like other works
of art. is often said to bring meaning out of chaos; that is, such works
possess form and structure as against the unorganized chaos of impres-
sions and experiences we rail "real life." Thus, through significant
form and structure, the literary artist attempts to give the reader a
clearer insight into the meaning—or meanings— of some significant
aspect of human experience.
Select some work of literature—or some writer—that has, in your
judgment, been especially effective in bringing meaning out of chaos.
The meaning can, of course, vary infinitely. One rich source of meaning
in literature is the conflict of appearance versus reality in human life.
Other sources of meaning concern the nature of man. the definition of
the good life, the nature of the universe, to name a few.
The purpose of this year's contest is to entourage you to see literature
not merely as escapism, nor as recreation, but as a valuable source of
meaning. Your task is to explain and evaluate. The basic question your
essay will answer is: What meaning does the work of literature discover
in human experience and how valuable is that meaning to you?
Prizes: The freshman contest offers three prizes: $400 for first place; $150
for second place; $50 for third place. If the essays submitted are of
inadequate quality, the judges may recommend a different allocation of
the pritze money to the contest committee.
Committee Assistance: Members of the Cooley Committee will welcome in-
quiries and conferences regarding the contest. The committee members
are: Chester F. Chapin, Dwight W. Stevenson. M. Rasin Tek, Robert
P. Weeks, Raymond A. Yagle.
Length: At least 2.000 words.
Date: Essays are to be left at the English Department Office, Room 3516.
Natural Resources Building, not later than 12:00 noon. March 13, 1967.
Eligibility: The contest is open to any upperclassman in the College of
Engineering.
Form: The essay must be typed, double-spaced, on 8&gt;/&gt; x 11 inch paper.
Footnotes should indicate sources and borrowed material.
Three copies must be submitted.
Each copy must be bound in a folder and bear the fictitious name by
which the writer chooses to identify himself.
The form on the bottom of this page is to be filled out and placed in
a sealed envelope which bears on the outside the author's fictitious
name. This envelope is to be submitted with the essay.
Criteria to be followed in judging:
1. Grasp of thet subject.
2. Effectiveness of focus and organization.
3. Clarity and effectiveness of expression.
-1. Proper acknowledgment of borrowed material, if any.
5. Correctness in mechanics: spelling, diction, grammar, punctuation,
and sentence structure.

Is there hope for 26

most misunderstood
characters?
Although graphic communications o?
all kinds is our business, making ideas
matter is our main concern. Since this
encompasses every alphabet, numeri-
cal system and other graphic means
known to man, the possibilities are
endless.
For example, LDX (Long Distance
Xerography) has already begun to
demonstrate its immense potential as
a graphic way to put any idea across
continents or oceans ... in seconds
and with great fidelity.
We think it likely that LDX will do for
facsimile transmission and reproduc-
tion what our 914 copier did for office
copying. Revolutionize it.
And, we expect that, as with the
914, the revolution will come quietly.
Suddenly a world of people will have
ready access to documents that can
help bridge the communications gap.
To press this revolution forward we
are concentrating on exciting corol-
lary concepts like 3-dimensional
imaging, color xerography and the
global transmission of images through
computer systems.
But even as we extend ourselves to
explore and develop the potentialities
of LDX-type systems-such as may
print the morning paper at your break-
fast table some day-we're simultane-
ously giving a lot of thought to a range
of related possibilities. Not least is the
creation of potent, low cost educa-
tional concepts and techniques.
Your degree in Engineering, Sci-
ence, Statistics or Mathematics can
qualify you for some intriguing open-
ings at Xerox, in fundamental and

STUDENTS
QUIT!
by Doctor Roger D. Augustine
Study of Engineering
Reprinted from "Engineer'
Dr. Augustine directed the study,
"Persistence and Attrition of Engi-
neering Students at Three Midwest-
ern Universities," from which his ar-
ticle is derived. He was then assistant
to the dean of engineering at Michi-
gan State University. Dr. Augustine
now directs student activities at the
University of Iowa. The full study is
available from him.
OF COLLEGE STUDENTS who be-
gan their educational journey by way
of engineering, nearly 40 percent quit
studying the field by their junior
year.
Why this high toll?
Some answers to this question are
offered in a study completed this
year by the Office of the Dean of En-
gineering, Michigan State University.
The study, based on questionnaires
and interviews with students at Mich-
igan State, Northwestern, and the
University of Wisconsin, reveals that:
The curriculum posed a substan-
tial hurdle for many would-be engi-
neers.
Students who quit engineering
contrasted sharply with those who
persisted.
Pre-college and college engineer-
ing career guidance was a failure.
Of 326 juniors invited to participate
in the study, 221 returned completed
questionnaires. Interviews of 40 min-
utes each were held with 176 of the
students—104 who had persisted in
engineering, and 72 who had switched
to non-engineering majors.
Particular emphasis was placed on
selecting students who showed simi-
lar promise for success in engineer-
ing studies at the time of entering
college. For this purpose, scores on
the College Qualification Test or the
Scholastic Aptitude Tests were
matched.
All students, moreover, were also
eligible to remain in engineering, for
each had obtained at least a "C"
cumulative grade average while pur-
suing an engineering major.
In asking the students for their re-
actions to the freshman year, a vivid
account was evoked on the context
within which students decide to re-
main in engineering or leave it.
The question triggered a flood of
memories. The freshman year was
recalled as being a time of excite-
ment, of challenge, and of doubt—
a time of new friends, new demands,
new ideas, new values—a challenge
to traditional standards, old loyalties.
To many, the transition to college was
difficult and threatening. For othen
it was relatively easy—almost a let-
down.
Students Agree Curriculum
Is Difficult
But in one matter the students al-
most all agreed: The engineering
curriculum was an excruciating anil
relentless task master.
Over and over again, the student
recalled how they spent night after
night "grinding out" solutions to their
mathematics, chemistry, and physio
problems while their dormitory mate*
"took off" for coffee dates, intra
mural sports, concerts, or just a
"night out with the boys." Many were
chagrined that the demands of the.r
studies severely limited their social
lives.
Beneath the surface of the pleasure
and excitement of the freshman yea:
a thread of anxiety and tension was
identified. All students—both those
who eventually dropped out of enp
neering and those who stayed with
it—commonly remarked that the*
were worried about grades and tha:
they feared 'flunking out.'
Students were angry and frustrated
with the seemingly unrealistic de-
mands which were made of them it
many of their courses even befon
they had time to get their feet on th;
ground. Many found the freshman
year a period of self-doubt and det;

l id admission that they had felt very
inhappy, lost, or lonely that first
ear.
Under such trying conditions, who
vere the students that persevered
engineering? These are some of
lieir characteristics:
They tended to come from work-
ng class and upper middle class socio-
economic backgrounds as opposed to
ower middle class origins.
They tended to come from sub-
.irban high schools as opposed to city
ind rural high schools.
They generally enjoyed repairing
things and thinking about how things
work; they had an inclination to "tin-
ker around the house."
Often, a close relative or father
was an engineer.
Their commitment to engineering
was made at an earlier age than those
who left engineering.
They met their first exposure to
sophomore technical courses with en-
thusiasm.
Students who quit engineering
seemed to have a strong need for up-
ward social mobility; they attached
more importance to working with peo-
ple rather than with things; and they
had tended to choose engineering
Miidies for materialistic and prestige
purposes or to acquire a "good"
background for careers in other
fields. Many left because the techni-
cal courses were too difficult; they
felt unable or unprepared to succeed
in their engineering programs.
Mathematics Proved An Obstacle
A number of characteristics were
common to both groups, some sur-
prisingly so. Mathematics, for ex-
ample, proved to be a nemesis for a
majority of all students. A substantial
proportion thought their calculus
courses inappropriate and of little
relevance to their future needs in en-
gineering.
Only about one-third of even those
who had persisted in engineering re-
ported that they were basically hap-
py or satisfied during their freshman
sear. They, as well as those who had
quit engineering, criticised the cur-
ricula for being too narrow and too
inflexible with little opportunity for
expression of individual needs and
desires.
Typically, it was the successful stu-
dent who felt most restrained and
frustrated by the rigid sequences of
prescribed courses that he felt had
confronted him at the outset of his
college career. Honors programs, ad-
vanced placement, and credit by ex-
amination provided welcome but in-
sufficient relief from the rigidity of
engineering programs.
Another dimension to the problem
was the delay perceived by students
before they were able to enroll in
'real' engineering courses. The stu-
dents did not see mathematics, chem-
istry, and physics as engineering
courses, but rather as somewhat pe-
ripherally related, preparatory ac-
tivities.
They longed for the opportunity to
begin their engineering work in such
areas as electric circuits, the me-
chanics sequence, or electro-mechanics.
The dilemma for engineering edu-
cators, of course, is that these latter
courses build from the foundation laid
by mathematics and the engineering
sciences during the first year of
study. Hence, the frustration of de-
layed gratification in engineering edu-
cation seems to arise from the unique
nature of the engineering curriculum.
The study suggests a significant
screening process is provided by the
sophomore year. Few drop-outs re-
ported any enthusiasm for their so-
phomore engineering courses, where-
as a large number of students who
remained in engineering were very
happy with them.
Summer jobs and cooperative work
programs also aided students in
clarifying their occupational objec-
tives. Those who had worked at en-
gineering-related jobs reported al-
most unanimously that the experience
had proved worthwhile.
As one student put it, "It was great
just to find out what engineers do all
day!" Some concluded that they
should change majors before "get-
ting in any deeper." Those who re-
mained in engineering returned to
their studies with a new enthusiasm
and dedication.
The influences that led students to
choose engineering in the first place
were also explored. Almost all men-
tioned the influence of high school
science and mathematics. Proficiency
and interest in these courses were
c learly primary factors leading to the
study of engineering. Only a few re-
spondents cited shop courses, me-
chanical drawing, or occupations'
courses as influencing their decisions.
Other reasons for choosing engi-
neering included monetary gain, fi-
nancial stability, prestige, and the
mystique and glamour of the profes-
sion. More engineering dropouts men-
tioned these materialistic ends than
did those who persevered in engi-
neering.
It was also clear that a significant
proportion of engineering freshmen
simply intended to use engineering
training as a background for careers
in other fields. These students are
much more likely to leave engineer-
ing if they do not find that it is in-
teresting and meets their expecta-
tions.
A majority of the students inter-
viewed also reported that relatives,
were important in their choice of an
engineering major.
Minor Role For Guidance Counselors
Teachers and guidance counselors
on the other hand played a relatively
minor role in influencing students to-
ward engineering. A large number of
students reported that only a few
teachers or counselors seem to know
what engineering is about. Many stu-
dents admitted, "I really didn't know
what I was getting into, but it sounded
like the right thing to do."
A large proportion of the students
had been surprised at the content of
school work and the people with
whom they had discussed their plans
had provided no clues as to what they
would encounter. Similarly, students
reported that their preconceptions of
the engineering field were equally in-
accurate and ill-founded. As they be-
came better informed, many students
altered their educational plans.
At the college level also, students
relied on the guidance of academic
advisors. Most students indicated that
their relationships with advisors
were passive, distant, and procedural
in nature. On the other hand, only a
very small proportion of the students
themselves had sought out university
resources such as the counseling
service and other members of the
faculty.
In the light of what seems to be a
serious failure in engineering career
guidance, one of our most important
recommendations is that engineering
educators and engineering societies
undertake an earnest effort to com-
municate more widely and more
clearly to young people the nature ot
the work performed by engineers and
the content of engineering curricula.

JANUARY 1967


Throughout history men have em-
ployed elaborate rituals for making
up their minds. They have poured li-
bations and sacrificed oxen in hopes
of persuading a capricious and pos-
sibly hostile nature to reward their
decisions. They have consulted sib-
yles and watched the flight of birds
to discover what the future held in
store. They have put their faith in
proverbs and rules of thumb devised
to take some of the guesswork out of
living.
In managing the affairs of modern
business and government more sci-
entific decision methods are needed.
Unaided, the human mind cannot
possibly weigh the manifold com-
plexities involved in the development
of a missile, the erection of a fifty-
story building, the operation of an
enterprise producing hundreds of
products for millions of customers.
Thousands of decisions go into sched-
uling jobs, ordering supplies, man-
aging inventories, negotiating with
contractors, hiring labor, pricing
goods, and planning production fa-
cilities. The manager is further ha-
rassed by such uncertainties as the
policy-holders will die within a year.
Still other techniques deal with "un-
certainties"—chances that can be es-
timated because they depend on such
things as future developments or be
havior of competition.
Decision theorists use some took
that were developed several decades
ago, notably statistical sampling and
some newer methods such as lincai
programming, which is a short-cut
method of finding the best way to al-
locate scarce resources. In addition,
some brand-new techniques ha\e
been developed such as Program
Evaluation and Review Technique
(PERT), Critical Path Method
(CPM), and Dynamic Programming
Regardless of the technique, all de-
cision theory has a common pur-
pose: to show decision makers surei
ways to attain their goals.
The new scientific approach might
suggest the possibility that even the
most far-reaching business decisions
could be turned over entirely to com-
puters. But managers have no rea-
son to fear that they will be replaced
by machines producing decisions
"untouched by human brains
unpredictable tastes of consumers
and the speculative nature of eco-
nomic forecasts and research and de-
velopment programs. Thus all too of-
ten he must act largely on hunch and
intuition—and go home with the
gnawing suspicion that he might
have decided more wisely.
In recent years scientists have
been showing the manager how to
avoid some of the perplexity that at-
tends decision making. They have
been putting together a voluminous
bundle of mathematical techniques
for evaluating possible courses of ac-
tion. In attempting to rationalize the
process of deciding, they have de-
veloped "Decision Theory". This is
not really a single theory of how to
make decisions, but rather a collec-
tion of techniques for weighing many
factors in logical fashion. These tech-
niques become more important when
I he complexity is so confusing that
the human mind cannot arrive at a
wholly rational decision. Other tech-
niques cope with "risks"—chances
that can be accurately measured or
calculated, such as the probability
that a given number of insurance

Hunch anil intuition are still invalu-
at&gt;le. Indeed, most decision theorists
today are looking for ways to incor-
porate expert judgment with their
mathematics. They want to take full
advantage of the comprehensiveness
of the human mind to augment the
precision of computers. For his part,
the executive of the future will de-
pend on the tools of decision theory
much as an airplane pilot relies on
his instruments.
The cost of unsystematic and ir-
rational thinking by managers is un-
deniably enormous. If he wants to,
any good manager can easily recall
from his experience a wide assort-
ment of bungled problems and erro-
neous decisions. The number of un-
disclosed $10,000 mistakes made in a
large corporation every day is star-
tling!
Clear concepts about the reasoning
processes used by managers are still
scarce. In recent management litera-
ture a lot of attention has been paid
to the difficulties involved in han-
dling problems and making deci-
sions. But many of the theories and
svstems proposed seem to be either
obscurely complex or obscurely thin
and superficial, and they commonly
confuse the processes of problem and
analysis with those of decision mak-
ing. The arrival of computers and
data processing appears to have
compounded the confusion. On one
hand, managers are urged to apply
computers to their business prob-
lems, while, on the other hand, they
are frequently reminded that such
mechanisms and procedures cannot
make their decisions for them. The
reminder is essential, for no matter
how many computers he uses, the
manager himself still has to know
how to reason clearly about prob-
lems and their possible solutions.
There is, of course, more involved
in being a rational manager than the
ability to think through problems and
decisions logically and systemati-
cally. For one thing, a manager
needs good judgment to make good
decisions, and this capacity is itself
a compound of experience, values,
and innate abilities which may dic-
tate courses of action that are not
necessarily the products of strictly
logical reasoning. Setting objectives
and policies similarly involves con-
siderations that may not be reason-
able from one or another viewpoint.
But the capacity to reason system-
atically is unquestionably a basic ne-
cessity for any manager who hopes
to manage well. Successful man-
agers have developed this capacity
through experience.
Problem analysis and decision
making are management acts that
should be consciously and systemat-
ically performed, and if necessary,
recorded. The idea that a manager
should be conscious of exactly what
he is doing while he is managing
may not sound revolutionary, but the
fact is that such management is sel-
dom found in industry today. The ab-
sence of conscious, systematic prob-
lem analysis and decision making is
not only responsible for inefficiency
and waste, it is also res]&gt;onsible, in
large part, for the general neglect of
two of the most important manage-
ment functions:
• The setting of clear objectives
• The setting of clear performance
standards for personnel
There is every reason to believe

as evidenced during the past two dec-
ades, will continue to the future.
These continuing increases in tech-
nology inevitably mean that man-
agers will know less and less about
the skills and knowledge of those
they are managing, and will have to
depend more and more on their abil-
ity to manage the operating tech-
niques of those reporting to them. In
order to manage the way a subordi-
nate handles problems and decisions,
a manager has to know how to ask
just the right questions. Such skills
cannot, of course, be acquired over-
night. But they are a starting point
in preparing the ground-work needed
for making an astute decision.
No good manager needs to be con-
vinced that problem analysis and de-
cision making are the most impor-
tant things he does. His success vir-
tually depends on doing these things
well. Yet the pitfalls of problem analy-
sis and decision making are almost
certain to increase whenever a man-
ager is under pressure—which is usu-
ally the case when he is handling
very important work.
The best method for handling prob-
lems and decisions under the pres-
sure of elapsing time is by using sys-
tematic and logical methods. And the
more systematic and logical the
method, the more efficiently it will
work.
The process of decision making is
difficult because it involves not only
experience, knowledge, common sense,
and judgment, but also a great
many future uncertainties that may
threaten the action decided upon. A
systematic approach to decision mak-
ing is, therefore, just as valuable as
a systematic approach to problem
analysis. Its value is in direct pro-
portion to the increasing complexity
of the task.
There are five kinds of action that
a manager can choose in dealing
witli a problem. They are:
Interim Action:
Buys the manager time for find-
ing the cause of a problem.
Adaptive Action:
Lets the manager live with the
tolerable ellects of a problem or
with an ineradicable cause.
Corrective Action:
Gets rid of the known cause of a
problem.
Preventive Action:
Removes the possible cause of a
problem, or reduces its proba-
bility.
Contingency Action:
Provides stand-by arrangements
to offset or minimize the effects
of a serious potential problem.
As a general rule, the most effi-
cient action is corrective action. But
it is only possible where the cause is
known.
In any case, whatever action a
manager chooses to take will involve
decision making. And any decision
as to whether to take interim, adap-
tive, or corrective action against a
problem should be systematically de-
veloped by following the seven basic
concepts of decision making:
1. Setting Objectives From Which to
Choose
Objectives are derived from two
general areas: The results expected
to come from a decision, and the re-
sources available for expenditure in
carrying out a decision.
The manager usually starts with
the results he expects to achieve.
What is to be accomplished? Where
are we trying to go? What situations
are we trying to improve? What
kinds of results do we want mini-
mized?
Similarly, in seeking information
about resources to be committed, tin
manager explores the following
areas:
Men—skills, numbers
Money—capital, budget, cost
Material—facilities, equipment,
space
Time—short term, long term
Power—energy, transport, author-
ity
2. Classify Objectives According to
Importance
All the objectives should be listed
under two headings: Musis and
Wants. The Musts set the limits that
cannot be violated by any alterna-
tives.
The decision-making manager will
find that some Want objective will
always be far more important, more
critical than others, and here he ha&lt;
to sharpen his judgment as to the de-
gree of their relative importance. To

Ily.
The first step in this weighing pro-
•ss is to establish the position of
ich Want objective with relation to
ie next. This is done by giving it a
umerical weight of importance,
jch weighing can be done by start-
lg with the least important objec-
ve and giving it a weight of 1, then
■iking how many times more impor-
int any other objective is compared
&gt; it, and giving this second objective
weight in accordance, say 3 or 5.
.:ich of the remaining objectives can
e treated the same way. By this
icthod the least important objective
i taken as a bedrock standard of
comparison, and all other objectives
re ranked against it. Another meth-
tl is to use a straight numerical
cale, say from 1 to 10. (See Figure
)
1. Develop Alternatives From Which
o Choose
Finding alternatives is not a hit-or-
niss affair, but a patient, careful
earch for a specific action that will
perform a certain precise function.
After all, a manager is only looking
for a course of action; the best ac-
cording to the standards he has set.
The more systematically he uses
those standards in searching, the
more efficiently he can move through
a number of possibilities to find the
best action. (See Figure 2)
4. Evaluate the Alternatives Against
the Objectives to Make a Choice
To evaluate an alternative, the
manager tests it against the objec-
tives, measuring it to see how good
a job it will do. To do this system-
atically, he takes each alternative
and measures it individually against
each one of the Must and Want ob-
jectives. Each alternative is first as-
sessed against the Must objectives on
a Go/No Go basis.
To judge the performance of each
alternative against the Want objec-
tives, the manager should score each
of them against each one of the ob-
jectives separately. He can use a nu-
merical scoring scale for this, say 1
to 10.
5. Choose the Best Alternative as a
Tentative Decision
The alternative that receives the
highest weighted score on perfor-
mance against the objectives is tenta-
tively the best decision.
6. Assess the Adverse Consequences
of the Tentative Decision
A manager should take the best al-
ternatives and consider them inde-
pendently, visualizing each as though
it were already in operation. Some of
the promising places where a man-
ager might look for trouble as a re-
sult of his decision are:
People:
Nfotivation and attitudes
Skills and abilities
Performance and productivity
Health and safety
Organization:
Relationships, among units, func-
tions, persons
Communications
Responsibility and delegation

EFFECT
In 1879, it was observed that, when
a conducting material, i.e., a metal,
is placed in a magnetic field, a mi-
gration of electrons in the transverse
plane occurs which gives rise to a po-
tential difference between the upper
and lower edges of the conducting
strip (fig. 1). This Hall emf, as it is
called, can be measured with a po-
tentiometer, and its study has pro-
vided much information pertaining to
the conduction process.
Soon after the discovery of the Hall
effect, it was found that the materi-
als which we call semiconductors
display a Hall emf which is the re-
verse of that observed in metals.
Such materials conduct by a process
known as hole conduction rather than
by electron migration as in the case
of metals, and their carrier concen-
tration is relatively low (one free
electron per 1012 atoms at room tem-
perature compared to one free elec-
tron per atom for metals).
Hole conduction entails the migra-
tion of a positive charge through a
semiconductor crystal in a direction
opposite to that of electron migration.
Figure 2 illustrates the motion of a
hole through a crystal. In (a), the
hole is in the upper left-hand corner
of the diagram. An electron from an
adjacent electron pair moves to the
position of the hole. The hole (see b)
is now midway between the top and
bottom of the crystal and slightly to
the right of its original position. The
process is repeated in (c) and (d) un-
til the hole is at the right-hand side
of the crystal. The complete path of
the hole through the crystal is shown
in (f) .
Thus it is convenient to think of the
hole as a specific partical, holes in
motion constituting a positive current
to the same extent that electrons in
DEVICES
by Rita Sarno
motion constitute an electric (nega
ive) current. Because whole conduc-
tors combine the advantage of high
carrier mobility with low carrier den
sity, they are particularly suited fur
use in Hall effect devices, where
high carrier concentration is unde-
sirable because of the damaging et
feet which the resultant high temjx'ni
ture has on the Hall device com
ponents.
A Hall effect device is one which
relies for its operation on the develop-
ment of a potential difference be-
tween the two edges of a semicon
ductor strip placed in a magnetic
field. Knowledge of the magnitude
of this potential, as well as that of a
control current traveling longitudi-
nally in the J direction (see fig. 1'
facilitates determination of the in
tensity of a magnetic field into which
the Hall device is placed, making the
Hall effect device a particularh el
fective magnetic field probe. The*'
devices are capable of detecting and
measuring magnetic fields of inten
sity as low as 10 * gauss. Figure 3 il-
lustrates the electrical system which
constitutes a typical Hall effect de-
vice.

current into the system. Electrode-

REPORTS
When faced with writing a report,
do you:
(1) Say: Let's run a few more ex-
periments to get better data.
(2) Sit down with a pad and start
an outline with: I. Introduction and
then think about your next date.
(3) Grit your teeth, pick up a pen,
start writing on unlined paper con-
tinuously, slap a cover on it and get
it in.
(4) Get a big pile of references
close by and start copying. Your
conscience is cleared by adding a
bibliography and hiding the most used
reference by its foreign language ti-
tle.
The average student goes through
many of these phases which is prob-
ably all right but unless he outgrows
them, the probability is high that he
will never get further than assistant
something or other. Worse yet, he
will lead a frustrating professional
life because top management, wheth-
er in business or a university, will
"never understand him". To high-
light this point, I have questioned
many employers of Michigan engi-
neering graduates over the past 15
years. The only uncomplimentary re-
marks have been directed toward the
writing of the students—their tech-
nical competence has never been
criticized*
The purpose of this article is very
simple. It is: To help you to transfer
to the mind of the reader as quickly
as possible the knowledge you have
reached through your efforts. Fur-
thermore (and this will be horribly
unpalatable to many writers), your
report should be written so that the
reader can disengage himself from
reading it as soon as he finds he has
learned enough.
A common trick of otherwise ma-
ture investigators is to reason, after
two years of research on a given
topic with a staff or hard working as-
sistants, that the results must be
worth thorough reading by every
reader. They reason that the only
way to make sure that the reader
doesn't cheat himself, (or rob the in-
vestigator of due adulation and re-
spect) is to hide the conclusions
toward the end of the report. A
lengthy bibliography and acknowl-
edgements section along with several
appendices prevents the would-be
quick reader from finding the conclu-
sion quickly. Also giving the conclu-
sions as mathematical formulas and
dispersing the definitions of the sym-
bols carefully through the text is an-
other fine trick. Omission of an index
also helps.
What is really wrong with this
plan? Perhaps the best way to an-
swer this is to recall an early field
trip I took as a fresh, wet Ph.D. with
our company president who had nev-
er gone beyond the fifth grade. Dur-
ing a friendly evening conversation
he leaned over to me and saiil "Son-
ny, I'm going to tell you now the two
simple principles which have been of
most value to me. You won't think
much of them now but you will as you
grow older.
(1) You sell or you starve.
('!) Sell clearly, honestly, but above
all quickly."
Now these points may seem hor-
ribly crass and commercial but re-
flect a moment. For example, doesn't
even the potential winner of a Nobel
prize in science have to sell his ideas
to the scientific community? If \ou
don't sell you will starve—intellet-
tually—if not literally.
To return to the positive phase of
our objective, how can you effect the
quickest, clearest transfer of the
amount of your knowledge that the
reader should assimilate?
Here is a simple method which h;^
always worked—whether applied to
undergraduate, graduates, or proftv
sional people. It will relieve you from
the fear of report writing, make it an
intellectually satisfying experience
and best of all, clarify your next ev
periments. Furthermore, regardlev.
of monetary considerations, as vou
advance in professional life you will
be giving the clear distillate of the
best of your work to a great, continu-
ing and appreciative audience.
There are just eight steps in the
most complex report. (We will ui*
cuss a short form report later.) The*'
are:
(1) Preparation and Soid Searching
(2) Title
(3) Summary or Abstract
(4) Introduction, History, Obju
lives. Review of the Literatim
(5) Procedure
((&gt;) Presentation of the Data
(7) Discussion

engineering graduates and probaK
less common for Michigan grail
uates because of the many effiH'--

(8) Conclusions
/—Preparation and Soul Searching
The reason for this somewhat meta-
physical title is that many authors
consider that they have done their
duty if they merely describe all the
procedures and tell all the results ob-
tained. In other words, their motto
is: "Here is what we did and these
were the results and let the reader
draw his own conclusions". This is
probably the safest of all procedures
but the least useful. It is you, the
person who actively directed and par-
ticipated in the experiments, that un-
derstands the data best and therefore
is best equipped to organize the re-
port and draw valid conclusions. It
is you who ultimately must sift
through the mass of data to find the
one or two important new ideas or
principles worth transferring to the
mind of the reader.
Practically, how is this to be done?
If you have trouble with formal out-
line procedures and get stuck after
writing down "I Introduction", here
is an unconventional procedure that
always works. Get a good supply of
paper and pencils, a quiet, small
room, a comfortable desk and most
important, select your most produc-
tive time of day. If possible, have all
your data and references in good or-
der close by.
Now list—don't write sentences or
paragraphs—the principal ideas and
procedures which should go into the
report. Just as they come into your
mind. Don't worry about order. What
were the original objectives, the nov-
el procedures, the discarded proce-
dures, the expected and unexpected
results? Use only a few words or
symbols for each. Let these all come
out, uninhibited as in a brainstorming
session. Only after you think all the
ideas are there, should you start to
marshal them. Using the suggestions
of the following sections, start to
group your points under Procedure,
Discussion and so forth. Now that
you have done this, underline the
points to which you have given promi-
nence in order to impress the reader
with (a) your amount of hard work,
and (b) your knowledge of general
mathematics, statistics and com-
puters. Cross them out and make a
new honest start.
2-Title
The title determines whether the
report should be read at all by a
given reader and here is where hon-
esty and clarity begin. As potential
readers, most of us have at one time
or another furtively picked up a gaily
bound book labeled "Secrets of Mas-
culine Strength" only to explode a
firecracker inside upon opening it.
The scientific equivalent of this back-
fire is to finance a long translation
of an article in a foreign language
only to find that the intriguing title
covered an empty shell. On the other
hand, a title can be unduly detailed.
For example, review these two ti-
tles for the same report:
(1) "A Comparison of Carbon In-
sert Brake Shoes with Plain Brake
Shoes Using A-100 MPH Stops, B-
40 MP Drag Tests on Rolled Steel
Wheels"
(2) "The Effect of Carbon Insert
Brake Shoes Upon Wheel Tread
Structure"
The latter is simpler and empha-
sizes the principal novelty—the ef-
fect of the carbon insert upon the
structure of the wheel.
Also, it is well to review the title
after completing the report.
3—Summary or Abstract
You should write this section with
the following facts in mind.
(1) The readers holding the most
important positions will probably
read only this section.
(2) The majority of the people you
wish to instruct will read the whole
report only if they are interested in
the summary.
(3) A good summary will help the
reader assimilate the balance of the
report in half the time he would take
without it.
Let us not waste time on the argu-
ment as to whether the Abstract or
Summary are the same. Either
should be considered as a short re-
sume which can be separated from
the rest of the report and which will
tell the reader the objective of the
work, what was done, what results
were and, in some cases, give recom-
mendations for further work.
One attitude to take is to suppose an
important potential sponsor of your
research had only two minutes to
spend with you before boarding his
plane and asked you about your re-
cent research. You would spend a
few sentences on your objectives and
what led to your work. Then some
comments on procedures, particu-
larly any unconventional ones. Fol-

What is it?
Not the op art discs — we're
not about to describe them. We
are interested in the micro-photo
just above — specifically the little
rectangle in the center. It's a minuscule chip of silicon produced
in Motorola's semiconductor labs—on the verge of creating a
scientific revolution all its own.
The chip's dimensions are 0.060" by 0.080"—about the size of
a baby B-B. That tiny area incorporates 14 transistors, 10 resistors
and 2 capacitors—performing the same circuit functions as the
26 discrete components shown below. It's Motorola's chip off a
new block of electronics—it's an integrated circuit.
But why all the fuss?
Because the integrated circuit is the key to untold electronics
marvels, hitherto impractical. Because its small size, weight, and
power consumption lessen the cost of complex systems and
improve performance. Because it's more reliable, to boot.
Integrated circuits already are used in design plans for amazing
new computers — computers which will, in effect, function as
special extensions of the human brain. Computers
which, in time, will almost think. It's an
exciting business. It challenges everyone in it.
Within a year, the solid state art
will develop the means to store the
content of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica in a one inch cube—a solid
state memory system. One day, every
important university library
will have electronic knowledge
banks connected, perhaps by satellite,
for instant exchange of information.
People generally are impressed
by the chip with 26 components
But hang on. We've now got
one in the lab not much larger (0.120"
by 0.120") . . . with 524 components!
Hip chip? You bet.

EDUCATION and RESEARCH
EDITED BY JAMES MYERS
i
ANN ARBOR-Physicists have
found evidence that there are sever-
al layers within the proton, the
heavy, positively charged particle
within the atom's nucleus. The pro-
ton was formerly thought to have
some structure, but there had been
no strong evidence that it did. This
finding supports the idea of structure
in the proton.
Discovery of the layers in the pro-
ton was made by a team of scien-
tists using the 12.5 billion electron
volt Zero Gradient Synchrotron
(ZGS) at Argonne National Labora-
tory near Chicago.
The physicists are Prof. Alan D.
Krisch, research associate, Carl W.
Akerlof, and graduate student Ross
H. Hieber of The University of Mid
igan; Kenneth W. Edwards, Uni'
sity of Iowa; Keith Ruddick. I rm
sity of Minnesota; and Lazarus (■
Ratner of Argonne.
Their work was supported by iht
U.S. Atomic Energy Commission
The results indicate that the pro!
looks something like an onion will
either two or three layers. The t\
istence of the outer layer was knowi
from experiments bouncing elev
trons off protons, but previous
periments had not shown any inner
regions.
While the interpretation is far Era
conclusive, there are most likei1
three regions nine tenths, half am1

ion tli of an inch. The ZGS proton
earn permits measurement of sizes
own to one fiftieth of a fermi.
Discovery of regions within the
ton's nucleus emphasizes the fact
hat there are forces and relation-
hips that physicists have yet to un-
lerstand. No coherent theory yet ex-
tlains satisfactorily the particles
iow being discovered by the large
torn smashers.
"One possible explanation of the
lifferent regions is that each is the
ource of a different type of force,"
Crisch explained. However, such
nodels are still speculative. We hope
he proposed 200-bev atom-smasher
vill solve this puzzle."
The finding of this structure within
he proton extends a familiar pattern
n the history of physics. Each time
physicists have explored smaller dis-
anccs with higher energies a more
omplicated structure has been found.
To perform this experiment, Ar-
ronne ran its huge accelerator 24
tours a day for over a month, slam-
ning one proton into another. Every
;econd 100 billion protons from the
£GS collided with the protons in a
polyethylene target. After bouncing
iff, the energies of the protons were
measured by separating them with
nagnetic fields and detecting them
with devices known as scintillation
Lonnters.
The inner structure was found by
itudying the number of protons de-
lected by scintillation counters placed
it precise 90-degree angles from the
beam path. Krisch explained that
the denser the center, the greater the
chance that a higher-energy proton
would bounce into the counters. This
was because higher-energy particles
go deeper and can see the dense cen-
ter of the proton.
WASHINGTON-Means of pro-
ilucing a large but light weight lens
that might be useful in space astron-
omy was reported by two University of
Michigan engineers.
Emmett N. Leith and Juris Upat-
nieks of the U-M Institute of Science
and Technology also reported a meth-
od for making high quality holo-
grams even with poor quality light
sources. Thus certain holograms
could be made faster and cheaper.
A hologram is an image of an ob-
ject stored in a film or other medium
by means of recording the object's
interference pattern. Holograms are
being researched for a wide variety
of data-processing and scientific pur-
poses, as well as possible use for dis-
plays of entertainment devices.
The large light weight lens is a type
known as a fresnel zone plate. It dif-
fers from ordinary lenses in that it
provides a focus by difraction rath-
er than refraction, that is, the light
rays are bent by passing through a
series of tiny slits rather than a lens.
Although it has been known for
many years, the fresnel zone plate
has not been put to practical use, but
there has been a renewed interest in
the zone plate because of its advan-
tages. It can be easily made. It is
light in weight because it need be no
thicker than an ordinary film plate,
in contrast to the thick glass required
for ordinary lenses. It may be ideal
for use in space vehicles.
Leith and Upatnieks said the zone
plate has had a number of limita-
tions, including the aberrations or
distortions present in most lenses;
these can be corrected in lenses but
not in zone plates. The U-M engi-
neers report, however, that produc-
ing the zone plate by holographic
methods will eliminate or reduce the
aberrations.
This is because many different in-
terference patterns can be stored on
the same hologram film plate, they
pointed out.
Thus many zone plates can be
stored in the same film, each one
imaging only a small portion of the
object field and producing a good im-
age over this small area. Each of the
zone plates images a difierent por-
tion of the field, thus a large field is
covered by the effect of all of the
zone plates acting in unison.
Their method for upgrading holo-
gram recordings is somewhat simi-
lar to their production of the zone
plate.
To make a hologram the light must
be quite coherent, that is, the light
waves must all be "in step." Con-
tinuous-wave lasers are best for pro-
ducing a light of coherence suitable
for making holograms.
However, much of the coherence
energy of the laser beam is spread
out or used up by this diffraction pat-
tern inherent in the hologram.
Leith and Upatnieks asked, how-
ever: "Why not insert a diffraction
grating in the holographic plate it-
self so that so much coherence is not
required of the illuminating beam.
They point out that the available co-
herence can then be used to supply
the image instead of wasting energy
as a diffraction grating.
This method would reduce the co-
herence requirements by ten to a
thousand times, they said. "Thus,
high quality holograms can be pro-
duced using light sources that other-
wise would yield holograms of con-
siderably poorer quality," they said.
Even the mercury arc lamp as well
as pulsed lasers could then be used
to make holograms, they said, and
the production of holograms be made
cheaper, faster and more efficient.
Leith and Upatnieks note, however,
that the technique in its present form
is applicable only to objects that are
transparencies or scenes viewed in
silhouette.

USE OF NECESSARY
ANN ARBOR— A company's pro-

there is recognition of existing dif-
ferences between research and de-
velopment-trained personnel and the
management class, a University of
Michigan publication suggests.
Scientific research has so expanded
that a new work culture—"The Tech-
nocracy"—has evolved with differ-
ing loyalties, comments Management

many managers, yet this scientific
culture must co-exist with the mana-
gerial culture," the publication's edi-
torial states.
Here are seven R &amp; D-manage-
ment differences which are cited:
(1) Scientific values emphasize the
reliability of quantitative facts as a
basis of action, but the managerial
culture works within a framework of
attitudes and adaptation. While man-
agers do seek factual corroboration
of the success or failure of projects,
they rely greatly on intuition in set-
ting them up.
(2) A commitment to detail is a
hallmark of research excellence, but
managers are urged, in the interest
of efficiency and a broad view, to
delegate details.
(3) A scientist's concern with the
consistency of detail inclines him to
solicit his colleague's critical ap-
praisals of his work. The manager,
however, knows that procedures and
policies that will not work in one
area of management will suffice in
some other, and he is often unwilling
to accept criticism of a program.
(4) Scientists require a sense of in-
dependence in the performance of
daily work, as well as the freedom to
consider issues incidental to a stated
goal. Managers are committed to
maintaining systems of order that
align with stated goals.
(5) In the matter of primary loyal-
ties, there are marked differences in
the two cultures. The manager feels
himself a member of the company
team; the scientific or technical em-
ployee is more apt to identify with
his profession and to consider the
company the site of the work he is
committed to.
(6) The manager, accepting the
goals of the organization as his per-
sonal work goals, balances his work
values on an economic scale (profit
and growth). The scientist works with
outside professional goals that are
applicable to many fields, often un-
related to economic considerations,
and he may be unperturbed about
the lack of relation between his work
and company profit.
(7) The technical or scientific man
readily informs professional counter-
parts in other industries of his suc-
cesses. The manager feels a more
proprietary interest in innovations,
and, while interested in advancing
the science of administration, feels
less obligation to publish his exper-
ience and surrender to a competitor
the slight edge his company has there-
by achieved in pricing.

ANN ARBOR—Researchers from
around the globe will share their
knowledge to grapple with a puzzler
for all modern countries—highway in-
jury—at a University of Michigan
symposium during Sesquicentennial
Year 1967.
The "Symposium on the Prevention
of Highway Injury" will be one of the
first international conferences deal-
ing with the problem.
Authorities who have investigated
crucial aspects of this social vexa-
tion will present their research find-
ings here April 19, 20, and 21.
The three-day symposium is one of
many events heralding the Univer-
sity's 150th year of educational serv-
ice.
The U-M Medical School is spon-
soring the symposium in cooperation
with the U-M Highway Safety Re-
search Institute and the Extension
Service. HSRI has recently begun one
of the most comprehensive programs
in the nation, a many-faceted re-
search attack, to seek ways to im-
prove highway safety.
Automotive engineers, industry of-
ficials, highway designers, doctors
and medical authorities, safety in-
stitute directors, governmental agen-
cy members, legislators, and key
police officials will be among inter-
ested persons attending the sessions
in the Rackham Building on the Ann
Arbor campus.
The emphasis throughout the sym-
posium will be on highway injury pre-
vention, says Dr. Melvin L. Selzer,
associate professor of psychiatry at
the Medical School and symposium
committee chairman.
"It is our intent to stimulate
thought on the prevention of both rc
mote and immediate causes of injur
ies resulting from motor vehicle col-
lision," he notes.
"By remote causes we mean uV
factors related to the triggering c;
an accident—psychological, alcohol
ic, social stresses. Immediate cause*
are those in the collision sequence o(
events involving the driver and ve-
hicle."
The theme for the opening day so
sions (April 19) is the alcoholic driv-
er. Topics will deal with the need in
multiple approaches to accidents in-
volving alcohol, deterrents to drink
ing and driving, responsibility and
alcoholism, attempts in group ther-
apy and the effects of alcohol arc
drugs.
Speakers April 20 will discuss vi*
ion in connection with highway in-
jury. Topics will include visibilb
problems in night driving, reducing
disablty glare, improving visibilm
and the visual environment. The cor.
tribution of medical illness to trait
accidents will also be dealt with.
The final day's presentations (Ap-
ril 21) will deal with biomechanb
Studies on body injuries, seat belt in
juries, head injuries and the like mil
be analyzed in relationship to injur,
prevention.
Various authorities in the field of
highway safety research will panic
pate in a panel to conclude the sym
posium. The topic will be 'Imp'
Attenuation to Automobile Occuparm
under Crash Conditions."

7. Control effects of the final decision
by preventing adverse consequences
and by follow-up
This final stage of decision mak-
ing is critical to the whole procedure.
If a manager, having become clear
in his mind that he has chosen the
best way to achieve his objective,
simply gives the necessary orders
and moves on to the next problem,
he is automatically inviting serious
trouble. Once he starts to implement
his decision, every adverse conse-
quence he considered earlier be-
comes a potential problem. Now, be-
fore it is too late, he has the oppor-
tunity of preventing these conse-
quences from ever coming to pass.
(See Figure 3)
Finally, before he puts his plan in-
to effect he should recognize that
other difficulties will occur if he does
not carefully plan for implementing
his decision. To help assure this im-
plementation he should take the fol-
lowing five steps:
(a) Set up controls and reporting
procedures so that he can know
the progress of his plan against
the schedule.
(b) Follow-up on his orders to
know that they have been re-
ceived and understood.
(c) Determine responsibility for
carrying out his orders, and
verify that this is understood.
(d) Set up specific reporting dates
at which to measure the action
being taken.
(e) Set up a warning system that
will tell him as early as pos-
sible if his plan is getting into
trouble in any respect.
IDEAL DECISION MAKER
High intelligence is undoubted!*
one of the qualities the decision
maker must possess to rank as ideal.
Intelligence is a composite of various
mental abilities. This composite cer-
tainly must contain at least these
components of real quality:
Alertness
Imagination
Judgment
Ex|&gt;erience
Capacity to Reason Systematical^
Balanced personality is another es-
sential attribute of the "perfect de-
cider". He is an individual so consti-
tuted by nature, training, and experi-
ence that he will have developed his
own systems of values and goals and
integrated them in a rational arra\
with those of the organization he
helps administer. The concept also
implies an individual who, as a rule,
will move with respect to each de
cision situation which confronts him
in conformity with his hierarchy. Ob-
viously, the balanced personalitv will
not be inclined to pursue radical or
irrelevant courses nor will he often
react solely as a creature of emotion.
Courage is another trait basic to
perfection in the decision maker. It
is the quality which makes it possi-

might otherwise block. The process
of making a decision is by its very
nature quite capable of generating
fear in the decision maker. His de-
cis'ou may create and mobilize op-
position to it and therefore, some or
all of his friends, associates, assis-
tants, and other supporters may
move away from him in order to
avoid the possibility of suffering a
measure of blame for it or of sharing
other repercussions which may fall
on him. More or less deserted, the
decision maker can find himself
standing alone or at least with less-
ened support. Here is truly a very
real source of fear with which the de-
c'der may have to contend.
Acceptance bv the organization in
which he discharges his decision
(unction is another important require-
ment for the decision maker. Accep-
tance of the individual bv the or-
ganzation means several different
tilings. In a mild form, it is simple
friendship; in a little stronger form,
it is approval or agreement—ether
understood or expressed; in a still
more vigorous form, it is outright ef-
fort, actual or ready, to help the
member on his chosen course; and
in its most pristine form, it is love.
But, whatever its nature, organiza-
tional acceptance is essential to the
best in decision making. The extent
o! acceptance the decision maker
needs in order to proceed ideally de-
pends somewhat upon his emotional
make-up. If he is extremely sensitive
and values social approval dearly, he
well may need a high form of accep-
tance bordering even upon affection.
On the other hand, if he is the mo~e
callous type he may have relatively
little need for group support. The cor-
rect drgree of acceptance depends
also uoon rational factors such as the
(I eis'on maker's estimate of the help
he will require in making, communi-
&lt; atiner, selling, and carrying out
(-&gt;:rses he chooses.
DECISION MAKING AND
MANAGEMENT IN THE FUTURE
A number of factors evident at
present point out the probable nature
of the changes in future manage-
ment. First of all, technology is pro-
viding equipment that will not only
improve production techniques but
also communication and decision-
making processes. Automation, with
its continuous production, feedback,
;nd electronic computers, will have
a great impact on managerial func-
tirns. Secondly, the increased appli-
cation of mathematical approaches
pronr'ses to provide means for im-
proving decisions. The advantages
and limitations of the mathematical
models will be the subject of much
discussion in the near future. Thirdly,
the social and cultural position of the
nian-.ger will place greater demands
upon his decisions. The increased
size of the organizations, attention to
the dignity of the individual, social
pressures toward conformity in-
creased leisure, and accelerated ac-
tivities will require changes in a
manager's way of thinking. Fourthly,
the tyre of people becoming avail-
able for use in management will
make it possible to do many things
which heretofore have been merely
hopes. The larger number of highly
educated personnel will enable man-
agement to develop different ap-
proaches to its problems. More and
rnre people will be challenged to use
their unique mental powers and leave
to the machines the routine and pro-
grammed activities.
Several writers have attempted to
predict the character of manage-
ment in the future. Leavitt and Whis-
ler, authors of "Management in the
l?'80's" (Harvard Business Review)
feel that planning and creative work
will be moved upward in the organi-
/a'ion to the level of top manage-
ment. Decision will be reached with
the help of a number of specialists at
the top in a group instead of by a
single chief executive. Middle man-
agement will be divided more dis-
linctly into two types—those who will
become a part of top management
and those who will be downgraded
into routine executors. The distinc-
tion between the top management
and the routine operators will become
clearer—like that now existing be-
tween the worker and first line su-
pervisor. These observers see a ten-
dency to recentralize many functions
in top management, with less "par-
ticipation" of the middle managers.

What can you,
as an engineer,
expect to find
at Mead?
We like to call it an "environment for
growth."
You see, at The Mead Corporation, there are
opportunities of all kinds for engineers of
all kinds ... scientists, chemists, civil,
electrical, mechanical, industrial and
chemical engineers, as well as pulp and
paper technologists. In fact, with a little
work and perseverance, they're the kind of
openings that can take a man (or woman)
into product and process development,
process control and research, plant and
project engineering, production management
or any place else he's equipped to go.
If you're this kind of graduate—one who
jumps at the uncommon challenge, who
measures himself by his own achievements,
and wants a little bit more than he's seen
until now—we probably have a spot you
can grow in. Write to the Employment
Supervisor, The Mead Corporation,
Chillicothe, Ohio, and let him tell you more.

laied to the magnetic field strength
as follows:
c, =
where
iB
C0 = open circuit Hall emf
R,, = Hall coefficient
(characteristic of the
semiconductor)
i = Control current
d — thickness of semi-
conductor strip
B — magnetic field
strength.
The semiconductor strip is normally
of thickness 0.1mm or less. The elec-
trical system illustrated in fig. 3 is
generally encapsulated for protection
against damage caused by mechani-
cal strain, the usual encapsulating
materials being sintered ceramic and
cast resin.
To be suitable for use in a Hall ef-
fect device, a material must meet
ihe following requirements:
1. It must have a large Hall coef-
ficient, Rh, and low carrier concen-
tration; hence, it must be a semicon-
ductor.
2. Its resistivity must be sufficient-
ly low to permit power to be drawn
from the element (high carrier mo-
bility).
3. Its Hall constant and resistivity
must be relatively independent of
temperature.
Requirements 1 and 2 are met by
semiconducting compounds of ele-
ments of groups iii and iv of the pe-
riodic table. Of these, both indium
arsenide and indium arsenide phos-
phide meet requirement 3.
In most Hall effect devices, the
control current is rated so that the
semiconductor layer assumes a max-
imum temperature of approximately
20°C when the Hall device is used in
static air. The variation of the Hall
constant and hence of the open circuit
voltage which results from this rise
Fig k: Variation of Hall Coefficient with
Temperature for various Semiconductor Materials
in temperature is shown for various
semiconductor materials in figure 4.
To permit quantitative evaluation
of the proportionality existing be
tween the Hall emf and the control
magnetic field, the range of the con-
trol field must be delimited. Thus,
the range to which all linearity data
are referred extends from B — 0 tf&gt;
B — Bn, where Bn is the rated mag
netic field intensity of the Hall de-
vice. The Hall effect device is not
endangered if this rated value is ex-
ceeded.
Hall effect devices have three
principal areas of application. In the
first, the control current is maintained
constant. The Hall voltage is then a
measure of the magnetic field. Hall
devices designed in this manner are
employed as field probes and can be
used for sampling even strong in
homogeneous or tangential field*
Conversely, the magnetic field can
be maintained constant by using the
devices in the magnetic field to con-
trol the field excitation current. A
particularly important application ot
this process is the measurement ot
high direct currents by means of the
magnetic field that they generate.
In the second area of application,
the Hall voltage is permitted to be
influenced by an alternating mag-
netic field. An example of a prac
lical application of the preceding i*
found in the Hall modulator. An RK
control current applied to the Hall
device is modulated by a control
magnetic field oscillating in step with
an audio frequency.
Such a system can also be used to
convert an applied dc voltage to a
Hall ac voltage proportional to the
alternating magnetic field. A device
of this type is called a vibrator in
vertor.
The third area of application of
Hall effect devices involves the con
version of a variable control current
and a variable magnetic field into a
proportional electrical quantity, thus
making it possible to form product*,
reciprocals, and quotients. Such a
Hall multiplier can measure powei
from a given current and voltage aiu!
measure the torque of a dc motor
from air gap induction and armature
t ut rent.
To illustrate the operation of a typi-
cal Hall device, we shall consider a*
an example a Hall effect gaussmt
ter. This instrument is shown sche-
matically in fig. 5. The electrical *vs

Fig. 5: Hall Effect Gaussmeter
tem mounted in the probe in fig. 5
includes a semiconductor strip and
four leads. Current is supplied to the
system from a battery, the magnetic
field from the unknown source. This
is inserted into the unknown mag-
netic field and the output (Hall emf)
is read on the calibrated meter.
Other applications of Hall devices
include generation of oscillations at
the low end of the spectrum by feeding
the Hall voltage back to excite the
magnetic field (Hall oscillator) and
the direct harmonic analysis of per-
iodic wave forms.
The low weight and relatively small
size of these devices render them
particularly useful in obtaining mea-
surements in locations where dimen-
sions would preclude the use of stan-
dard measuring devices, e.g., extra
narrow or gaps where it is desired to
measure the magnetic field strength.
It is certain that the future will bring
with it further applications for de-
vices employing this interesting and
unique phenomenon.

TOUGHNESS
One of the outstanding advantages
of Malleable Iron Castings.
Toughness is the ability of a mate-
rial to withstand impact or repeated
loading.
Any material will fail. The key in
Malleable is that it will not fail sud-
denly. Under severe impact, Malle-
able will bend or stretch before
fracture occurs.
Malleable's impact strength is il-
lustrated in this test by a truck
manufacturer. To be absolutely sure
r 1^^^ .
of the strength of many components
in the cab, including the Malleable
iron cab support hinges, the truck
was crashed at high speed into a
barricade of ice. Although the cab
itself was battered beyond repair,
there was no damage to the Malle-
able parts, proof of the outstanding
impact resistance of this material.
Another facet of toughness is a
material's ability to withstand re-
peated loads of low magnitude. Fail-
ures of this type are due to fatigue,
and usually start with the appear-
ance of a crack at the stressed area
which progresses through the part
until fracture occurs.
Fatigue strength is a major factor
in design of automotive connecting
rods. The loads on these parts alter-
nate between tension and compres-
sion of varying magnitudes. In de-
signing a Pearlitic Malleable iron
connecting rod, a thorough series of
experiments was conducted which
demonstrated that the castings
have fatigue properties which ex-
ceed the performance requirements
of modern automobile engines.

move ahead fast
... so can you!
How do you make coin material — without silver — that
a vending machine can't tell from a conventional
silver quarter? How do you make a piece of wire with the
electrical conductivity of copper and the tensile
strength of steel? How can you provide a wearing surface
equivalent to diamond at a small fraction of the price?
These are the kinds of material problems you might work
on at Texas Instruments. Materials scientists solve
problems like these by cladding dissimilar metals
together to form a new material that has properties
unattainable with any monolithic alloy. Applied to such
products as thermostats and controls, TI metallurgical
skills solve problems like knowing when to turn off
your coffee pot or when to stop a large industrial motor.
Creative skills in materials and many other
technologies have helped TI double in size about
every three years for the past two decades. You might be

are illustrated here. All have as a common bond a
high level of innovation ... by creative people working

lowing this you would give the re-
sults and explain their importance to
other investigators.
All of these ingredients are needed
in the summary. As mentioned ear-
lier, a common error is to tell what
the objective was, say something
about procedure and indicate fhat
conclusions were reached. The
thought is "This should be enough to
trap the reader into going through
the report". Which of the following
summaries would you prefer as a
reader? Which would entice you into
reading the report assuming it were
in your field of interest. Note also the
different titles.
I. A Study of Iron-Carbon-Silicon-
Magnesium Alloys
Over two hundred melts of iron-
carbon-silicon-magnesium were made
using special techniques described in
the report. Special equipment of nov-
el design was developed. The data
are of importance because of the use
of magnesium in deoxidation and de-
sulfurization.
The solubility of magnesium in the
iron base liquid was measured. Ef-
fects of carbon content, temperature
and silicon were also determined.
The significance of the results is dis-
cussed at length in the report. Fur-
ther work is needed.
II. A New Method for Determination
of Liquid-Liquid Equilibria as
Applied to the Fe-C-Si-Mg System
The alkali and alkaline-earth met-
als have been used extensively for
deoxidation, desulfurization and con-
trol of graphite shape but equilibrium
data regarding their solubility in
liquid iron-base alloys have been un-
available because of experimental
difficulties. A method has been de-
veloped for maintaining a layer of
liquid magnesium over liquid iron-
base melts by applying argon at a
pressure greater than the vapor pres-
sure of magnesium, thereby prevent-
ing boiling. Sampling is accomplished
by remote control and the method
can be applied to other systems.
In the Fe-C-Si-Mg system, which
was investigated as a model, it has
been found that the solubility of mag-
nesium in the iron-base liquid is quite
appreciable (up to 3%) instead of in-
soluble as formerly supposed. The
solubility in order of decreasing im-
portance are carbon content, tem-
perature, and silicon content. The
solubility of iron in the magnesium
rich phase increases with tempera-
ture and probably with silicon. Parti-
tion factors and interactions among
the elements are also discussed.
Note that in II the reasons for the
work, the novel procedure and the re-
sults are given in enough detail to
satisfy the casual reader and care-
fully enough to introduce the report
to the concerned reader. Indeed, with
a good Summary and Index the read-
er is able to go to the parts of princi-
pal interest to him.
Another reason for writing a good
summary is that many readers are
led to reading professional work
through abstracts. The abstracter is
usually a busy man. Obviously you
will get the fairest abstract if you
give the man a good start.
It should be added that many inves-
tigators write the Summary last. A
better course is to write the Sum-
mary first so that the ensuing dis-
cussions will be oriented to the prin-
cipal points. However, parts of the
Summary may be rewritten after the
final detailed evaluation of the data
has been made. This often is needed
for a really well integrated report.
4—Introduction, History, Objectives,
Review of the Literature
This section will vary a great deal
depending upon the historical back-
ground of the work. The principal ef-
fort should be directed toward telling
why the particular objective was se-
lected and correlating what was done
previously. With care, the review of
the literature can be made a vital
interesting section, leaving the read-
er convinced that the objective of the
present work was soundly chosen and
built solidly on prior work. By con-
trast, a literature review can be a dull,
purposeless section if it is treated as
a routine job.
The objective should be clearly
stated in a separate paragraph either
at the beginning or at a prominent po-
sition in this section.
5—Procedure
This is usually the worst section in
which the writer grinds through an
interminable description of tech-
nique, usually wandering aimlessly
back and forth through a network of
tests. By contrast, the good writer
looks upon this section as something
akin to the opening moves in a chess
game in which the stage is set lor
the big events. If written properly
this section provides an opportunity
for building up the confidence of the
reader in the results to be discussed.
It is a fine place to deal with the triaK
and disappointments of early experi-
ments and so keep the later data sec-
tion unencumbered with them. This
is also a good time in a team effort
to point out the contributions of dif-
ferent groups.
As an example of good writing, let
us take a very simple case in which
you made an extensive examination
of a failed aircraft engine. Let us sup
pose you first made a thorough visual
inspection, then employed non
destructive tests such as X-ray, went
on to sectioning for mechanical test
specimens and finally to microscopic
work.
A logical set of subheadings would
be:
Procedure
A—Visual Inspection
B—X-Ray, Magnaflux, etc.
C—Sectioning and Mechanical Test
ing
D—Metallographic Work
This would accomplish two enck
First, the reader interested in the &lt;lc
tails of only one or two of these pro-
cedures can quickly find them using
the Index. Secondly, in the later sec-
tions on data and discussion, the
same divisions can be used.
The commonest error in writing the
Procedure section is to give results
and enter into discussion. It is al-
most unbelievable that in the major-
ity of reports containing this error
that the equally bad error is also
made of garbling the discussion with
procedure details which should have
been covered under Procedure!
The procedure section should de-
scribe and if necessary, defend pro-
cedural details. Sometimes, how
ever, this does involve using datn
For example, there is often the quo
tion of whether samples were hel-
long enough in a furnace for equilib-
rium, or how many determinations
are needed to attain a certain pre
cision. In these cases the necessan
data should be given and discussed
In other words, the reader should
leave the procedure section with jusi
about the same degree of confidence
as the investigator has in his dau
Also the decks should be cleared for
presentation and discussion of the
data.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Often the presentation of the data
lcl discussion of results are com-
ned in one section. However, there
e certain positive points in presen-
tion worth highlighting.
Every engineer considers himself
master at making graphs but few
rally are. The great temptation is
&gt; attempt to show to much detail
» one graph, with too little contrast
ecause the writer is very familiar
'ith the data points. On the other
and, too many writers become
reary at this point and do not have
lie energy or imagination to plot the
ata in different summary fashions.
l11 vital graphs should show data
&gt;oints or statistical limits. A graph
,-ithout substantiating data points
Hits too great a strain on the faith of
he reader.
The preparation of a good table is
he best test of the sophistication of
he writer. A table which merely lists
he facts without emphasis or order
s worthless except perhaps as a le-
jal document. Often a set of tables
iollowed by a table is needed. For ex-
ample, suppose that ten heats have
been cast in the development of a
new automotive gas turbine alloy.
From each heat five test bars have
been cast, chemical analyses for
eight elements performed, X-Ray's
of test bars made, metallographic
structure observed and tensile tests
performed. All of these tests can be
recorded and perhaps these tables
placed in the appendix. Let us sup-
pose the bars were all sound except
one, and that the principal effect was
the influence of nickel and chromium
upon elongation due to a variable
amount of a phase X in the micro-
structure. The summary table would
have the following headings, easily
contained on an 8i/2" x 11 page.
Heat No. | %Ni | %Cr. | Amount of
phase X | % Elongation j
A footnote could state the ranges of
other elements, that only bar from
heat Y showed an imperfection and
that the balance of the microstruc-
ture was composed of phases R, S, T
which had no pronounced effect.
One final precaution—there should
be enough experimental detail noted
on each graph and table so that it
stands on its own feet so that it can
be removed from the report. If it is
any good, it assuredly will be lifted.
7—Discussion of Results
This section is normally the most
difficult to the average writer. How-
ever, if the instructions have been
followed to this point, the section will
almost write itself. The principal
ideas have already been sifted out
for attention and the reader is ready
for them. Previous investigators have
been given their due. There is no
need to defend the procedures—this
has been done. The graphs and ta-
bles are self explanatory and present
the data well.
All that the writer has to do is to
follow a logical order. Often the data
can be discussed in detail in the
same order as the headings of the
procedure and then a general discus-
sion added. For example, in the
the findings of the visual and micro-
failed engine block discussed earlier,
scopic examinations can be discussed
first in detail and then the principal
facts can be correlated in a general
section.
8—Conclusions
The conclusions can be given in
more quantitative fashion than in the
summary. There is no need to give
any background and the effort should
be made to be as quantitative as pos-
sible.
Recommendations for further work
may also be given here.
An acknowledgement section, con-
ventional bibliography, an appendix
and index are usually required.
Short Form Reports
In many cases of routine investi-
gations some of these divisions may be
condensed or omitted. For example,
a short form (one or two page) re-
port may only contain an introduc-
tory paragraph giving history, objec-
tive and procedure and then the con-
clusions may be stated—all on the
first page.
The rest of the report can contain
procedure and discussion sections.
Again the idea is to put the most im-
portant material on the first page.
There is no need in this case to have
the conclusions given qualitatively in
a summary and again in a separate
section.
Grammar and Spelling
The emphasis in this report has
been on the organization and philos-
ophy of writing. It may be helpful to
list just a few of the common mis-
takes made by engineers of all ages:
(a) The use of a complex word
when a simpler one will do is as bad
as name dropping and other boast-
ing, e.g., say distinguish not differ-
entiate unless you mean it. On the
other hand, avoid repetition, use a
thesaurus.
(b) Confusion of affect and effect.
Both can be used as verbs but only
effect can be used as a noun. This
effect can affect your grades.
(c) Consensus is a long word—long
enough to mean the summary of the
opinions offered. Don't say "consen-
sus of opinion". To say "component
parts" is just about as redundant,
components will do.
(d) Avoid plural nouns with singu-
lar verbs and vice versa. This often
happens to good writers who will add
an extra noun in correcting the text
and then forget to patch up the verb.
(e) Avoid indiscriminate changes
in tense particularly in the same
paragraph. The use of the present
tense is often more lively and attrac-
tive in describing procedure but be
careful not to lapse indiscriminately
into the past.
(f) Old precautions that you
learned in grammar school but may
have forgotten:
i Use one sentence per idea.
ii Use topic sentences to start
paragraphs and more im-
portant, start a new para-
graph when the topic sen-
tence has exhausted its
coverage.
iii Avoid awkward or hack-
neyed phrases "This inves-
tigator believes etc.".
iv Write engineering reports
impersonally. Avoid I, you,
(Notice how I enjoyed vio-
lating this in this paper!)
(g) Most of all, after a fine experi-
mental job, don't be lazy. Prepare
good tables, figures or graphs to re-
place wordy descriptions.
(h) Reread carefully to make sure
that important statements not only
can be understood but cannot be mis-
understood.
One final word. Every bit of this
long discussion is intended to help
you write a shorter, more meaning-
ful report. The tune has passed when
the student was graded for the length
of his re]x&gt;rts in the university and
downgraded for the same reason in
his professional life. Only write when
you should—but when you do, make
it count.

Research
Engineers
wear many hats
By this we mean that each has an extended capability in discipline
other than his original area of specialization.
This capability is not necessarily one the engineer brings with him
to Foxboro — though, of course, it would be most welcome.
But it is one the engineer can gain at Foxboro.
The chemical engineer, for example, by adding a competence in
computer control technology, can lead the way in process control
research.
The physicist, who adds a competence in industrial processing to
his knowledge of fluid dynamics and gas composition, is thus able
to pioneer in process measurement techniques.
Other important disciplines — gas analysis, digital and analog con-
trol — can also be added at Foxboro.
They help the versatile engineers who acquire them — and ourselves
— grow faster.
And this growth — for all practical purposes — is unlimited.
If you already have this extended capability — or the capacity and
desire to gain it — Foxboro can offer you many ways to benefit by it.

J. GEORGE Thon, Manager of Engineering, Hydro and Transportation Division
CIVIL, MECHANICAL AND
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
One of a series of interviews in which
Bechtel Corporation executives discuss
career opportunities for college men.
QUESTION: Mr. Thon, the graduate con-
sidering a position with the Hydro and
Transportation Division of Bechtel is
interested primarily in two things: na-
ture of the overall work the Division
does, and what his starting assignment
would be.
Thon: In the Hydro and Transporta-
tion Division, as our name implies, we
cover two fields of engineering and en-
deavor—each one challenging to the
engineer but with a different emphasis.
Briefly, in Hydro work we design and
manage construction of dams, hydro-
electric powerhouses, tunnels, and wa-
ter collection systems. In this work we
integrate efforts of Electrical, Mechan-
ical, and Civil Engineers in the design
of a complete project. InTransportation
work we study, design, and manage
construction of rapid transit systems in
metropolitan cities. A graduate would
start either as an assistant engineer in
a specific project group or as a member
of one of the Hydrology, Hydraulics, or
Soils supporting groups. In an electri-
cal group he might start working on
one of the radically new systems of
electrification or automatic train con-
trol presently under development. Sim-
ilarly, in a mechanical group he might
work on the evaluation of hydraulic
turbine efficiencies or a ventilation sys-
tem for an underground station. As you
can see, a wide range of disciplines is
covered.
Question: Would he have any choice
as to preliminary assignment?
Thon: Yes. Both college training and
personal preferences are considered in
making an assignment.
Question: Since Bechtel not only en-
gineers a project but usually manages
construction as well, I assume there
must be close liaison between engineer-
ing and construction forces.
Thon: That is right. It is of paramount
importance at all times. We emphasize
the need for this close relationship in
the work of the young engineer. He is
shown why he must learn both design
and construction before he produces a
design that not only is theoretically
sound but also economical. He is given
frequent opportunities to visit project
sites. Transfers to construction are also
made available.
Question: How long does this training
period last?
Thon: There is no pat answer to that
question, since so much depends on in-
dividual ability and intensity of appli-
cation. If I were to generalize, I'd say
three to four years.
QUESTION: Can the young engineer
supplement the company's training,
program in any way?
Thon: Yes. We recognize the value of
university extension courses in special-
ized fields. He is encouraged to enroll in
such courses to broaden his knowledge,
and we have a policy of reimbursing
him for tuition fees and incidentals.
QUESTION: To what does he "graduate"
at the end of his training period?
Thon: He would be put in charge of one
of the phases of a project. For example,
he might take over a group designing
one of the many types of dams, from a
double curvature, thin arch dam to an
earth or rock fill dam. He might be re-
sponsible for a group analyzing water
hammer problems in pipelines or pen-
stocks, or be running an economic study
for a regional water collection system.
In the Transportation Group he might
head up a design team for a Rapid
Transit station in the center of a large
city, coordinating his work with archi-
tects and local officials. As a mechanical
or electrical engineer, he might be in
charge of design of a pumping station
or the preparation of a hydroelectric
generator specification. I think you will
see from the few aspects that I have
mentioned that there is no lack of vari-
ety in our work. We like to think we
are a young man's company.
The Hydro and Transportation Division is one
of eight major divisions of Bechtel Corporation.
Additional opportunities are available in the
Power and Industrial. Mining and Metals. Re-
finery and Chemical, Pipeline, and the two Inter-
national Divisions.
The engineer seeking professional challenge and
opportunity and wishing to work on projects of
pntional and international economic effect, will
find interesting beginning assignments and career
opportunities in the dynamic areas of Bechtel
Corporation's activities.
Bechtel Corporation (and its foreign subsidiariesi
designs, engineers and constructs in addition to
water supply, hydroelectric protects, and urban
rapid transit systems: conventional steam and
nuclear power plants, mining and metallurgical
processing projects, industrial plants, food proc-
essing plants, missile and space development pro-
grams, petroleum refineries, petrochemical and
chemical plants, pipeline systems, community
and regional planning, and developmental re-
search in all these areas.
Engineers are employed from many branches of
the engineering profession including chemical,
mechanical, electrical, civil (structural and hy-
dro), mining and metallurgical, architectural, nu-
clear, instrumentation and automatic control. Po-
sitions are also available for graduate engineers
with Masters' Degrees in Business Adminitration.

The world's foremost center
of industrial engineering
could be Building 56.
There it is. Would you like to work there?
"Industry has gone a long way toward satisfying those human
needs which can be reached through money, benefits, and security.
The future points to the job itself through improved job design
as a source of increased performance and satisfaction."
That's what we say in a new paper coming out of
Building 56. It relates the job design function of the
industrial engineer to the sciences that study human
behavior. Such a paper would not have come out of a
company where top management is less than sold on
the benefits of leading the field in applying the most
advanced concepts in industrial engineering no less
than in chemical, mechanical, or electrical engineer-
ing. We have a balance sheet to prove that our man-
agement knows which way is up.
Industrial engineers can come into Building 56
either from college, from graduate school, from mili-
tary service, or from a well-reasoned decision that
their present employment is not what they want for
the long haul.
Once in and with a little time gone by, choice con-
fronts a good industrial engineer. Does he want to

Like rapid transportation
Your technical career at General Electric can
cover a wide range of engineering
innovation. Take today's rapid transit problem
for example. Inquisitive minds in research
and design at G.E. have developed circuitry,
radar controls and propulsion systems
that can run and guide a 150 mph transit train.
Manufacturing engineers have
developed methods and machines
to produce these transit systems as efficiently
as possible. And technical marketing
specialists are working with cities and
government, planning their transportation
networks. Good reasons why at General Electric
innovations start and finish with the

YOUNG MAN!
Where a world-full
of projects abound
There was once a college senior named Al Addin who
yearned for his place in the sun.
However, at graduation time so many companies offered
him a job, Al didn't know which one to accept.
Then he met a Mr. Greeley, the recruiter from Westing-
houso. Mr. Greeley was a kindly man with a warm smile.
He described to Al how at Westinghouse young men have
their choice of six operating groups* and work in friendly,
tight-knit little teams on the world's most exciting projects.
"Go Westinghouse, young man," Mr. Greeley urged.
And Al Addin did. He wanted to be part of Westinghouse
efforts to help the nation rebuild cities, so he joined the
corporation's Construction Group — supplier of the world's
widest range of products for the construction market.
One day, while Al was polishing a Westinghouse lamp,
a Jeanie appeared. This pretty, warmhearted, intelligent
Jeanie was an engineer with the Elevator Division. (Women
are welcome at Westinghouse, an equal opportunity em-
ployer.) As the daughter of one of the richest men in Amer-
ica, Jeanie was in a position to grant Al Addin three wishes.
Al's first wish — to help Westinghouse build a municipal
complex of apartments, offices, stores and parks within an
established metropolitan area.
Al's contribution to the project was to help develop a
computerised environmental analysis technique — an in-
genious system for precalculating the heating and cooling
needs of all the buildings in the complex. Grateful archi-
tects and consulting engineers voted Al the year's most
calculating supplier.
Al's second wish — to help develop a total transporta-
tion system for a new housing area being built.
Transportation for the new project would consist not
only of a remote-controlled mass transit system, taking
commuters to and from their places of business . . . but
it would also include sophisticated elevator and electric
stairway systems to be installed within the project's ter-
minal and living areas.
Al's third and last wish — to marry Jeanie.
She consented on the condition that he let her join him
on other major projects and urban systems assignments
undertaken by Westinghouse throughout the world.
Al Addin agreed . . . and they lived happily ever after.
MORAL: All your wishes for a prosperous career can be
granted if you join Westinghouse, where awaiting you are
challenges, hard work, building block education, travel,
adventure, and yes, even romance.
You can be sure if it's Westinghouse

for improved performance
lsotropy is what the designer of this highly-
stressed 335-pound tractor yoke had in mind
when he specified cast-steel.
Not taken in by the shopworn "fiber" or "flow
line" argument, he knew that road-building
equipment is subjected to shock loads of high
magnitude—in several different directions—so
that he could not gamble with a construction
where toughness, impact and fatigue proper-
ties are not uniform in all directions.
Cast-steel also allowed the designer of
this tractor yoke plenty of engineering flexi-
bility ... He didn't have to worry about fitting
together cumbersome wrought shapes, and he
could put metal precisely where he wanted it
for load-carrying ability, to avoid possible areas
of stress concentration . . . And he could choose
the steel composition which would give him
optimum strength/cost ratio.

February's cover is a combination of
both old and new. Burton Tower, a long
standing monument and landmark of
The University of Michigan, stands solid-
ly in the background, symbolizing the
University's careful preservation of her
most hallowed traditions. The fore-
ground, however, is occupied by a sym-
bol of the present, in the form of the
new campus art display on the North
Ingalls Mall. Designed by Professor Phillip
C. Davis and contemporarily arranged,
the display shows in pictures the various
aspects of campus life experienced by
University of Michigan students now. The
display was ordered by the University's
Sesquicentennial Committee, and will re-
main throughout the year-long sesquicen-
tennial celebration. Professor Davis, by
the way, spent many months devising a
method for preserving art in the out-
of-doors. The result is this contribution
to campus, which will withstand the
severest of winter weather.

Looking inside
the earth for metals
The legendary prospector trudging on
foot through the wilderness scours the
surface of the earth—with luck gets a
hint of treasure inside through an out-
cropping of ore. But not all ore bodies
come near the surface. And pressures
to find more metals for the needs of
growing populations are so great we
can't wait for infrequent bonanzas.
Modern mineral exploration must have
"eyes" that see under the earth's sur-
face. Anaconda's program is based on
an ever greater understanding of the
distribution of elements in the earth's
crust and the processes by which they
are concentrated into ore deposits.
Geology and geological research are
thus "eyes" that help outline broad
areas of potential mineralization.
Gradually, the search is narrowed to
smaller target areas through scientific
application of geological, geophysical,
geochemical techniques and other tools
that are additional "eyes" for modern
prospecting.
Then these target areas must be tested
and evaluated in the light of experience
and the critical and significant features
commonly associated with ore-forming
processes. The three-dimensional geo-
logical model shown below was pre-
pared to help Anaconda geologists look
under the earth's crust at a later stage
in this process of evaluation.
Anaconda is a pioneer in the applica-
tion of geology to mining and explora-
tion. And it is intensifying and enlarg-
ing its program of laboratory and field
research at geological headquarters
throughout the hemisphere. This opens
broad new job opportunities in all
areas of earth sciences for geophysi-
cists. geochemists. geological engineers,
chemical engineers, physicists, and
metallurgists.
Anaconda settles an
old argument
The Statue of Liberty is one of the fin-
est examples of natural patina in the
world. And for years experts have
argued whether this patina is basic cop-
per sulfate or basic copper carbonate.
Some felt there should also be a good
percentage of chloride salts because of
the salty atmosphere whipped up by
the winds from the bay.
Anaconda spoiled all the fun by offer-
ing to get the answer. With the per-
mission of the statue's custodians, met-
allurgists from the Research and Tech-
nical Center of Anaconda American
Brass obtained adequate samples and
made an extensive analysis.
The talents and skills of techni-
cally qualified men and women
will always be needed by
Anaconda in important positions
in exploration, mining, extrac-
tive metallurgy, manufacturing,
scientific research, sales, and ad-
ministration.
If you would like more informa-
tion about Anaconda or wish to

Anaconda Company, 25 Broad-
way, N.Y., N.Y. 10004.

Results of X-ray diffraction, semi-
micro chemical, and wet chemical proc-
esses proved a predominance of cop-
per sulfate. This is easily explained by
the high estimate tonnage of sulfur-
bearing acids produced in New York's
atmosphere every day—and by the dif-
ference between the free energies of
formation of copper chloride and cop-
per sulfate.
Basic copper chloride content was less
than five per cent. And basic carbon-
ates are virtually absent because they
can't survive in the acid environment.
This pleasant little side trip was by no
means unrelated to the regular work of
the Anaconda research teams. They are
concerned with everything that hap-
pens to copper metals—and all the com-
binations of useful properties they can
supply. They work on new finishes for
copper metals and on industrial corro-
sion problems. They develop new
alloys to meet new needs. They pursue
pure research.
Anaconda's research and development
are key factors in expanding copper's
role in a rapidly advancing technology.
It is opening new opportunities for col-
lege graduates at Anaconda American
Brass in all fields of engineering, in
business administration and sales.
Cable to feed our growing,
power-hungry cities
Our big cities keep getting bigger. They
need much more electric power every
year, in big concentrated chunks of
load. And generator output must be
carried at high voltage to these new
load centers.
You can't string the transmission lines
down such places as Broadway, or
across 42nd St. So you dig—carry the
power in the already crowded space
under busy city streets.
Anaconda, anticipating this need, built
the best equipped high-voltage research
laboratory in the cable business (see
below)—and used it to develop the
345,000-volt cable now actually in use.
And now. Anaconda Wire &amp; Cable Co.
is busy working on plans to satisfy
power needs of tomorrow's cities.
Anaconda produces wire and cable not
only for the utility industry, but also
for modern communication systems.
telephone and CATV; and for count-
less applications in building and indus-
try. Constant engineering investigation
at the Company's four research centers
is opening new frontiers of knowledge
in wire and cable technology—new op-
portunities for engineering graduates.

THIS
MACHINE
CAN DO
ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING...
ALONE . But plug it into a data processing system
. . . and duck!
Motorola calls it a teleprinter—the TP-4000. It can spew out
three-and-a-half feet of lettersize copy in just 60 seconds. That's
probably as much as 50 secretaries could handle—a neat clip
of some 3000 words a minute—or 300 characters a second.
The teleprinter hasn't got a brain in its head — but lash it up
with a mind — like a computer's core storage
memory bank and it can play back data at real
time, virtually instant tk B recall. For example,
it can give you a /^•"^^^"i^^L copy readout of the

Vermont. Instantly. ^^^^^^^^^^^^ Ortell you precisely
how much fuel you ^^^^^^^^"""^P have, now, in your
Texas storage tanks while you're in Albany signing a contract.
Airlines can use them, banks, railroads, or even hospitals for
just about anything from data retrieval to inventory count and
traffic control.
Uncle Sam, too. For a machine with no mind of its own, the
mighty teleprinter can immediately verify the computer pro-
grammed signal sent to a space craft. And give a visual analysis
before the signal has a chance to be executed — an instant
check for accuracy. It will be used, for instance, at far flung
tracking stations as a precautionary check factor during the
Apollo moon mission.

examples of the modern multi-versity. From meager be-
ginnings in 1819, of two professors and seven students, the
modern university has a faculty of thousands, and a stu-
dent body which is at thirty-six thousand and growing
fast. Of this, the most astounding growth has occurred
within the last fifteen years, when the university jumped
from an enrollment of seventeen thousand to one of
thirty-six thousand. This phenomenal growth has brought
immense prosperity to the University and the student
alike. The University is recognized as a standard of edu-
cation throughout the world, and the student has the
resources of one of the finest teaching faculties ever as-
sembled by one institution. However, this growth has
been severely criticized by many of those who have
studied the matter. Many different ideas have been raised,
predominant among which is the idea that a multi-
versity relegates to the student the role of being simply
a number for a vast IBM technology. Most definitely, in
the College of Engineering this is not true. Of course some
effort is required on both sides of the picture. A professor
isn't going to recognize a student who sits in the back of
the room and for all practical purposes sleeps for the
duration of the course. However, almost without excep-
tion, if the student takes an interest in the course, if he
asks a question or two, goes and discusses the course with
his professor, or in some way makes his presence noticable,
thi professor will bend over backwards to help him. In
a large university system such as he University of Michi-
gan, professors are able to teach courses they enjoy, not
courses which they must teach because there is no one
else. Thus in most cases the course is something that is
exciting to the professor, and he will do everything within
his power to pass this enthusiasm on to the student. Many
professors will jump at the least little opportunity to help
students, so that they might pass on some important,
and in most cases, interesting points. One has only to sit
in classes and literally have the professor beg students to
come by during office hours to talk about the course,
about future courses in the field, or about relevant
courses in other departments to know this is true. This
is especially relevant in the College of Engineering. Al-
most all courses are related interdepartmentally. That is
a course in, say, chemical and metallurgical engineering
may depend upon previous courses in math, physics,
chemistry, engineering mechanics and so on. The list is
endless. Having the College split up into individual de-
partments also helps alleviate this "I'm a number" feel-
ing. By the time a student reaches his junior year, most
of his technical subjects will be with a limited number
of other students, all in his department and all part of
the same graduating class. Thus, instead of being a small
part of a large number of students, he becomes a large
part of a small number of students, something that can
be important when help is needed in a certain course,
or when he wishes to just exchange ideas within his field
with someone of similar interests. There is also the fact
that with the various departments within the College of
Engineering the counselling is specialized. For the small-
er departments there is one counsellor, for the larger
possibly two or three, but the idea is that the student
has this same counsellor throughout his undergraduate
program. This makes it possible for the student and coun-
sellor to really get to know each other, and plan aca-
demic programs with the student's interests and problems
in mind. Also with the increasing number of engineers
going into graduate work, it is possible to have the gui-
dance and recommendation of someone who is recognized
within the department and the field. Thus, looking at
Michigan in its entirety, the theory of the multi versity
seems to be rather unappealing, but with a closer look
at the College of Engineering in particular the picture
is apt to change. Instead of being a number, each and
every student can, with just a little effort, become known
and recognized by his professors, his counsellor, and
others he comes in contact with. Also, there isn't any
difficulty in developing long lasting friendships in the
supposedly cold atmosphere of the big university. Within
the large mass of the student body, there develops small-
er, more compact groups which each student comes to
know. The quality of education is beyond question, and
the coldness of a multi versity is a thought of those
who look from without, to the student a totally different
picture emerges.

MARITIME
ADMINISTRATION
CAREERS
Advance Swiftly at MAR AD... Participate in the Nation's Most
Exciting Career Development Program
You can embark on one of the most challenging
and satisfying careers ever offered to a college
graduate, a Civil Service appointment with the
Maritime Administration of the U. S. Department
of Commerce.
The Maritime Administration —we call it
"MARAD"—aids development of the American
merchant marine to carry the nation's water-
borne commerce during peacetime and serve as
a naval and military auxiliary in time of war or
national emergency.
MARAD Engineering Opportunities
Engineers of the Maritime Administration partici-
pate in design and construction of new ships,
improvement of existing ships, and maritime
research (basic and applied) and development.
Among the better-known recent products of
these activities are the Nuclear Ship Savannah
and the advanced Hydrofoil Ship Denison. Soon
to come (perhaps with your help): new concepts
in port operations, shipbuilding, ship operations,
and advanced vessels, such as "surface effect"
ships.
Engineering Work-Study Scholarships
To meet current and future engineering needs,
MARAD has developed a specialized program
for individuals who have earned their BS degrees
in Naval Architecture, Marine, Electrical, or
Mechanical Engineering, or a closely-related field.
Our work-study program combines classroom
and on-the-job training. It is designed so that you
may earn credit toward a master's degree in the
fields named above besides gaining the diver-
sified experience and proficiency that will lead to
positions of maximum responsibility in minimum
time. Requiring 30 to 36 months to complete, the
work-study program is in four phases:
(1) a six-month sea assignment.
(2) a six-month tour of duty and study at a
shipyard.
(3) assignment to the Washington Office of
Ship Construction or Research and De-
velopment for on-the-job training in Naval
Architecture, Marine or Electrical Engin-
eering.
(4) nine to 12 months advanced study in one of
these or related disciplines at a university
acceptable to MARAD—study which nor-
mally completes the requirements for a
master's degree.
You may earn promotions twice during the
work-study program, from GS-7 to GS-9 after a
year's service, then to GS-11 upon award of a
master's degree or its equivalent. And through-
out the program, in addition to full salary and
Federal Civil Service career benefits, you will be
reimbursed 100% for all educational, transpor-
tation and associated expenses.
Starting salaries for Engineers in each grade:
GS-7, $7,729; GS-9, $8,479; GS-11, $9,536. Sub-
sequent promotions are earned in keeping with
the employee's demonstrated fitness to take
greater responsibilities.

YOU'LL WANT TO HAVE THESE FACTS ABOUT SANDERS
A PLAN TO HELP YOU KEEP ON GROWING
Most important to your professional development is your asso-
ciation with men who can display technical "firsts." These are
seasoned men who encourage you to similar accomplishment
and who urge you to speak your mind freely. As one Sanders
engineer puts it, "Channels of technical communication are
wide open here."
Another spur to professional development is the liberal pre-paid
tuition program for advanced study at well regarded universities
near all Sanders* plant locations. And, too, a growing number
of top calibre in-plant courses are offered.
WHERE YOU FIND SANDERS ASSOCIATES
In Nashua, New Hampshire. Headquarters for the company, this
thriving community in beautiful hill country is about 30 minutes
from Boston's suburbs. In Bedford, Massachusetts. The new Bed-
ford Division is located in the heart of the "Electronics Row"
section—Route 128—near Boston. In Plainview, Long Island,
N. Y. Situated on Engineers' Hill in the Plainview Industrial Park,
Sanders" Geospace Electronics Division is just 45 minutes from
New York City. In Manchester, New Hampshire. Located in the
state's Queen City, this facility is conveniently near the airport
and the Nashua Headquarters plant.

WHAT IS THERE TO KNOW ABOUT SANDERS
You don't have to spend much time in industry to learn that
Sanders' growth and technical achievements are near models in
the electronics community. Eleven brilliant engineer-founders
(with a contract for $117) led the company in 15 years to its
position today—personnel roll exceeds 5,000 at 4 locations.
In a recent 4-year period, sales nearly tripled to a record $59.7
million for fiscal '65, and have already passed this for 1966.
YOU'LL THINK HARD AT SANDERS
Obviously, a lot of hard thinking put the remarkable rise in
Sanders' growth curve. As a weapons systems company, Sanders
focuses this thinking on aggressive innovations rather than re-
lying on traditional concepts in order to speed the development-
to-delivery cycle, and to achieve total-mission reliability. As a
technical and business philosophy, this freedom to break with
conventional methods of doing things has fostered a creative
climate where original ideas multiply, professional knowledge
expands and individual advancement is accelerated.

is the day
we start helping you
outgrow
The way we look at it (not only here
at Electric Boat Division, but in
General Dynamics as a whole)
good employes —properly placed,
trained and motivated—are our fastest
growing asset. So, right from the start,
well be doing everything in our power
to help you develop your full potential
through a strongly-implemented man-
agement-sponsored program that
makes your professional development
a matter of planning, not chance.
This program, called "people devel-
opment", is designed to spot your spe-
cial capabilities—to help you move, to
progress, even to change your product
area or technical discipline if that's what
it takes to increase the certainty of your
success. Part of the program is a philos-
ophy that charges each supervisor,
whatever his level, with developing his
own replacement. And our supervisors
are adept at recognizing individual
achievement and calling appropriate at-
tention to it. Part of it, too, is one of the
most extensive and far-sighted educa-
tional, study and post graduate pro-
your
job
grams ever offered by any company, to
encourage continued academic profi-
ciency. Hundreds of people in our Di-
vision participate each year.
But the thing that gives this approach
of ours real point is the challenge and
excitement of the field youH be work-
ing in—Oceanology—a field as new as
the Aerospace industry was new a
dozen years ago, and as promising; a
field that encompasses every means of
undersea operation and exploration
known to man.
And here, whether you're working on
a deep diving research vehicle or an
atomic sub, the opportunities for inno-
vation (as well as growth for the inno-
vative) are endless. For instance, every
atomic submarine we build is treated
as a new and different problem. Even
ships in the same class differ since
each succeeding one is, in fact, the
state-of-the-art at the time we're build-
ing it. Within any sub, advances might
occur in nuclear shielding design; in
heat transfer efficiency; in sound and
vibration control; in new materials; in
chemically based life support systems;
or in a dozen other areas. And because
of the close collaboration among men
of many different technical disciplines,
your thinking might spark a new idea
in any one of them. Just as their think-
ing might spark yours.
Living and working in Groton, Con-
necticut is a rewarding experience in
itself. For in this unique nautical com-
munity you are not only close to the
men and women who build and sail
submarines, but to all the abundant
pleasures of the sea. (Not that you're
far from more metropolitan pleasures
if that's your preference.)
So, if you are earning a degree in
engineering or science, and would like
to know more about how we will help
you outgrow job after job here at Elec-
tric Boat, make a date through your
Placement Office to see our representa-
tive, or write for a new informative bro-
chure to Mr. Donald K. Whynott.

Dean VanWylen joined the University of Michigan
faculty in 1951 and became Dean of the College of Engi-
neering in 1965. In addition to numerous technical arti-
cles, he has co-authored txoo hooks on thermodynamics
and is a member of the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers, the American Society for Engineering Educa-
tion, and the Society of Automotive Engineers. Dean
I an Wylen received both his bachelors and his masters
degrees in mechanical engineering from The University
of Michigan and his doctoral degree from the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology.
This issue of the Technic is a particularly significant
one because it is being sent to high schools in the state.
We hojje that it will convey to many high school students
some impressions of the college, an understanding of the
engineering profession, and an appreciation of the excel-
lent opportunities for students at The University of
Michigan.
In attempting to write an article that would be of
interest to high school and college students, the Editor
of the Technic suggested that I consider extra-curricular
activities. Are they important? Should they be limited
to our field of professional interest, such as engineering
societies? Or should a student deliberately choose activi-
ties that will develop his non-professional abilities and
interests, such as glee club or debating team? Should one
be merely a participant, or should he strive to be a lead-
er? These are but a few of the questions that can be
raised in regard to extra-curricular activities.
I would like to approach this subject, not by answer-
ing these specific questions, but by setting forth a num-
ber of basic principles. From these, each [&gt;erson can chart
his own pattern of participation and responsibility.
Each of us is a member of a number of groups or com-
munities. These include our family, the student body of
our high school or college, and other organizations such
as our church, fraternity, or athletic team. A student who
is studying engineering is in the process of becoming a
member of a professional community; and, in all proba-
bility, he will function during his professional life as a
member of a company or firm. We cannot live in isola-
tion in this world but will rather be a member of sev
eral of these communities, whether we like it or not.
One of the most important and one of the most diffi
cult aspects of life is to be an effective member of a
community. The relationship of the individual to the
community is a two-way relationship. On the one hand,
the individual has the responsibility to contribute to the
overall objectives and to work in harmony with hi&gt;
colleagues in achieving the objectives of the group. On
the other hand, the individual has much to receive from
the group as a whole and from other individuals in the
community. It is im}x&gt;rtant to keep these in balance
The individual who participates solely for what he can
receive becomes a parasite: and the one who has all the
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


answers, believing that he has little to receive, can great-
ly hinder the effectiveness of the group. The effective and
meaningful participation in a group calls for a balance
between these two extremes.
The matter of leadership should have the same balance.
The primary motive for leadership should be to serve.
As a by-product, however, the leader will find that his
life has been greatly enriched and challenged.
Extra-curricular activities are particularly important
in high school and college because there is much to be
learned about the effective participation in a community.
And since we will be involved in many communities
throughout our lives, it is particularly important to par-
ticipate in a number of groups during our formative
years. Here we can learn to take responsibility, to work
with others in developing and achieving goals, and to
find that balance between giving and receiving.
There are a few purely practical matters, however. One
should choose his extra-curricular activities very care-
fully. He should not let his life be run by these activities;
rather, he should be in control of the situation at all
times. A student should avoid overcommitment for at
least two reasons. One is to make sure that his extra-
curricular activities do not usurp the place of the funic-
ular program, for a student's primary responsibility is to
get the finest possible education. Second, one should not
participate in a group unless he can fulfill the responsibil-
ities that are expected of each member. Neither the in-
dividual nor the group can benefit from haphazard
participation.
One final point. One should choose his extra-curricular
activities so as to insure diversity and broadening. Cer-
tainly an engineering student should be a member of a
student chapter of a professional society, but he should
include another activity that will be broadening or cul-
turally rewarding. A student might well consider varying
his activities from year to year, during his high school
and college days, thus enriching his life and the lives of
many others by meaningful and effective participation in
a variety of groups and activities. Each of these activi-
ties will be a significant preparation for broader responsi-
bilities that lie ahead.

As a way of introduction to the University of Michigan and the College of Engineering in particu-
lar, the Technic decided to present a pictorial tour of the campus. This is the real heart of the
engineering program. The specialized labs on North Campus are interesting, but the life of the
freshman and sophomore engineer is, with a very few exceptions, centered on main campus. It is
here that the math and english courses are taught, where the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts holds its courses, where the Department of Engineering Graphics has its drawing rooms,
and where Physics and Chemistry have their respective buildings. If you have the chance to visit
the campus, it is these buildings that you should see, both inside and out, as well as the North
Campus laboratory buildings.
Angell Hall—Named after President Angell, who in the 19th century did more
than any other man to shape the University, this building houses the admin-
istrative offices of the College of Literature, Science and the Arts. Here the
freshman engineer may have his beginning calculus courses, or lectures and
recitations from any of the courses in the Literary College.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


student finds he spends a good deal of time in the Chemistry building. One of
the first schools to develop a well-rounded program in chemistry, the University
has maintained its position through well qualified professors and ample laboratory
facilities.
Undergraduate Library—or UGLI as it is more commonly known. This library is the largest facility
of its kind in the nation. In addition to the general volumes on the first and second floors, there is a
special Engineering and Transportation Library on the third and fourth floors, housing 300,000 vol-
umes and over 1,000 sets of periodicals including government documents and technical reports.

East Engineering Building—This, and West Engineering are the classroom buildings
for the College of Engineering. The building houses a variety of rooms, from
large lecture size to small recitation rooms in which the freshman engineer spends
much of his time. Also located here are the administrative offices of the deport-
ments of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering. Aerospace Engineering, ore
Electrical Engineering and their related laboratories.
Physics and Astronomy Building—One of the newest buildings on main campus, the departments of
Physics and Astronomy have their offices here. Freshman engineers spend at least a semester in the
physics labs located here, and make frequent use of the modern lecture rooms. In addition, the build-
ing houses the large Physics Library, with many pertinent references and technical journals.

versity provides for extensive student usage
of these facilities. Thus, theoretical course
content is augmented by laboratories in
which the student is given practical experi-
ence in using the computers.
West Engineering Building—This is the home of the College of Engineering. Most prominent landmark on the Campus
is the Engin Arch, one of the traditional entrances to the "Diag," the central walk across the main campus. Here are
located the offices of the College, and many of the departmental offices and classrooms.

PHILOSOPHY
FOR
BUSINESS
MANAGEMENT
by EDMUND B. FITZGERALD
President, Cutler-Hammer, Inc.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Business Management," is truly not related to the fact
that I am left-handed. It is rather my strong belief that
the principal responsibility of us as business managers
is the management of the left-hand side of our companies'
balance sheets. For the asset side of the balance sheet
really is the list of tools we have available to us and the
return we produce through the utilization of these tools is,
in fact, the method by which our performance is measured.
Fortunately, there are many financial types, including
accountants, bankers, credit managers and other volunteers
who stand continuously ready to tell us what we should do
with the righthand side of our balance sheets. Not having
been a whiz in either high school or college mathematics,
it is very comforting to know that so many people are
available for consultation on the righthand side of our
balance sheet. Unfortunately, advice on the lefthand side is
not as readily available which has caused me to evolve
this left-handed philosophy for business management.
This philosophy can be summarized in four simple
statements:
1) A business is an economic institution.
2) A business's only real asset is the people who work
for it.
3) Leadership is an absolute requirement for business
success.
4) It is more important to own a market than to own
a factory or warehouse.
These are simple statements. They certainly are not
earth-shaking and you have no doubt heard them all
before. However, sometimes in the maze of today's com-
plex business operations and sophisticated techniques and
systems it is comforting to find a set of simple statements
to which to retreat.
These statements and ideas are certainly not original
with me. For just as plagiarism is when you copy from
a single source and research is when you copy from many,
I have indulged in a great deal of research to produce
this philosophy.
A business is an economic institution. As such it serves
customers, provides jobs, through taxes pays for a portion
of the cost of government, is a purchaser of goods and
services, and is the source of substantial philanthropy
to the communities in which it operates. All of these
are vital and desirable functions, and from time to time
certain of these functions are singled out as the principal
reason for a business's existence. However, as an economic
institution a business's first task is to get economic results;
everything else we might desire must come later. I don't
mean to imply that to produce economic results that we,
as business managers, are entitled to run roughshod over
the populace as a whole. However, within the acceptable
FEBRUARY 1967


our first responsibility is to produce economic results
and it is to this responsibility that we should devote
most effective and creative efforts.
The companies for whom we work, possess certain
financial assets with which to exploit market opportunities.
These assets consist of the contributions of our owners or
shareholders, earnings of previous years retained in the
business and funds we have borrowed from others. These
assets are invested in our buildings and equipment, in-
ventories and accounts receivable from our customers.
Through the investment of these assets we strive to pro-
duce profits to pay for our share of the cost of government,
to compensate our owners or shareholders for the use
of their funds and to provide the financial seed corn to
plow back into our operations to produce the growth
we need to keep competitively healthy.
The absolute test of our collective business acumen is
the manner in which we apply these assets to the oppor-
tunities available to us and we are measured by the rate
of return we achieve on the assets thus employed.
In addition to financial assets, our companies possess
two other kinds of assets, perhaps less universal in ap-
plication but much more important to our immediate
future. The first and most important of these is capable
and experienced people. The second is our companies'
reputation in the market places in which we are active.
But the most important of these is people. Given the
right human assets we can create the market reputations
we desire and we can obtain the financial assets we need.
To obtain maximum effectiveness from our people
today, we organize, although a century ago we probably
would not have bothered, for then most businesses were
quite literally the result of the inspiration of a single
individual; they were quite generally small and nearly
always concerned with a single product or a relatively
simple product line.
In those circumstances it was perfectly possible for one
man to supply the inspiration, for one man to be suffi-
ciently expert to make all the important decisions him-
self, with the success or failure of his company dependent
solely upon his competence.
In this complicated age, that concept of business leader-
ship in many cases is no longer tenable. During the past
century, businesses have grown in size and in complexity:
governmental regulations relating to business conduct
have become more numerous and more difficult; and prod-
uct lines have become bewilderingly diverse.
In short, all of the elements of doing business in the
Twentieth Century have increased so much in variety
and complexity that their direction is in most cases beyond
the grasp of a single individual. Business has become a
team effort and the task of leadership is no longer one
of possessing outstanding competence in one or many
different areas, but rather dealing with many sorts of
individuals and of insuring high competence in all of
these new fields. And, above all, a business organization
must encourage these many specialized practitioners to
perform as a harmonious group dedicated to a common
objective.
Crawford H. Greenewalt, Chairman of Du Pont, put
it well in his address to the International Industrial
Conference in San Francisco last September when he said,
"The conclusion I have come to is that the differences
in managerial competence are due not to one person, not
the few geniuses that cross the stage from time to time,
but arise out of the creation of an atmosphere 'which
induces every man or woman connected with the enter
prise, no matter what their position, to perform his or her
task with a degree of competence and enthusiasm meas-
urably greater than what could be called their norma!
expectations."
This philosophy of management certainly dovetail*
closely with my own belief that people are a compare's
most important asset. Each of us might have difricult\
in successfully sustaining the position that our own peoplt
are inherently superior people for, individuallv, our
people probably cover as braod a range of capabilities as
you will find in most organizations. However, it is what
happens when you put them together that makes the
difference. It is the potency of the mixture as well as the
strength of its ingredients that are important.
Within our organizational structures we strive to bal-
ance things like individual initiative and freedom ol
action on one hand with guidance and restraint on the
other. We seek at all times for a balance between such
opposites as independence and discipline. We look lor
workable combinations of the best of both characteristics,
such as responsible independence and flexible discipline,
preferably self-discipline.
A most important ingredient of this approach is just
plain old-fashioned hard work which, when combined
with interest, energy and drive, give a company its vitality
Many business leaders have pointed out the danger
which lies in store for the company which becomes satis-
fied with itself and stops looking for new ways to push
back the frontiers of its potential. The example of the
extinct buggy manufacturer who deluded himself into
thinking his business was making buggies instead of
realizing that he was really in the business of providing
transportation is a cliche of the business world. We don'i
have to look far into more recent history to find other
less famous but none the less deadly examples of this
loss of the innovative vitality on which all business must
live.
Rather than the restless probing search for the better
way of doing each task, more and more persons at all
levels in the organization become increasingly satisfied
merely to discharge the functions listed in their job
descriptions, with little or no concern or knowledge of
how effective or ineffective this effort might be in achiev
ing company goals.
Nicholas Murray Butler once said that people can be
placed into three classes:
"(1) The few who make things happen,
(2) The many who watch things happen, and
(3) The overwhelming majority who have no idea
what has happened."
It is people who make things happen who provide the
real drive anil power for a progressive company. It nun
take a lot of watchers and even more uninfonneds to turn
out the day-to-day routine. Bttt the real progress conn*
from the few who have the vision and drive to innovatt
new approaches to old problems.
W'e must set goals for ourselves and for our organization*
which cause all of us to strain beyond our normal reaih

REUSABLE SPACECRAFT
HANDKERCHIEF OR KLEENEX?
by DAVID SCOTT
FEBRUARY 1967


Atlantic crossing is the economical
equivalent of expending a Saturn 5
for each space shot. The advantage of
a space vehicle that could be reused,
like the DC-3, and flown for twenty
years is obvious. However, a space
booster is very different from an air-
plane or an ocean liner. Reusable
boosters, after many trips into space,
woidd suffer deterioration from long
ex|x&gt;sure to radiation and micro-
meteoroid impact. Reentry heating,
acoustic vibration, recovery and land-
ing loads, climatic exposure and salt
water exposure are further threats to
the structure. Also, a reusable booster
would cost billions to develop and the
cost of individual boosters would be
high. However, lowered cost of opera-
tions would justify the new system.
The design criteria for the improved
system would follow these lines: (1)
reusability (partial or full), (2) pas-
sengers comfort and safety, (3) low
"G" environment for passengers, (4)
mission reliability, (5) high opera-
tional flexibility, (6) easy and inex-
pensive maintenance, (7) low produc-
tion cost, (8) low propellant cost per
flight and (9) satisfaction of a multi-
customer market (scientific, military,
commercial).
This reusable system would increase
the space market because non-astro-
nauts could travel in improved com-
partment environment with lower "G"
forces. Aircraft type reliability would
also increase the market. Increased
launch readiness would be extremely
valuable in space rescue and unpre-
dicted needs for personnel and special
equipment. The reusable vehicle could
shuttle between earth and a 24-36 man
space station once a week, supplying
subsistence, spare parts and rotating
the crew. Also, the assembly of lunar
or planetary vehicles in earth orbit
could be supported with men and
materials by this shuttle. Satellites
could be maintained and repaired, and
debris could be removed from orbit.
Reusable boosters would not remain
in space as debris or reenter the at-
mosphere uncontrolled. It is also pos-
sible that this reusable craft could
open a commercial market for a rapid
global transportation between distant
points on the earth.
NASA and aerospace corporations
began serious study of reusability four
years ago and studies continue today
at quickened pace. The types of re-
usable spacecraft studied can be cate-
gorized as follows:
1. From earth to earth orbit.
a. Orbital transix&gt;rt.
b. Global transportation vehicle.
2. Inter-orbital ferry vehicle.
a. Earth orbit to another earth
orbit.
b. Earth orbit to lunar orbit.
c. Earth orbit to planetary orbit.
3. Lunar surface to lunar orbit
shuttle.
4. Planetary surface to planetary
orbit shuttle.
The first attempt at reusability
might be the refurbishment of the first
stage of the Saturn 5.
REUSE OF THE SATURN 5
The Saturn 5 will be able to put
tremendous payloads into orbit—at a
high cost. Thus, the question of oper-
ating the booster economically arises.
Studies show that if and when firings
reach six to twelve a year for five
successive years, a ballistic recovery
system for the Saturn 5 first stage
would be justified. A ballistic recovery
could be accomplished by parachute
in combination with retro rockets that
fire before impact into the ocean. Ex-
periments to simulate landings of
boosters in the ocean have shown that
the amount of refurbishment is low.
A fixed wing flyback for the Saturn
5 first stage is justified if each vehicle
can be flown 12 and 24 times a year
for 10 and 5 year periods respectively.
A winged Saturn 5 first stage would
have a wing span comparable to that
of the B-52.
Recovery of the Saturn 5 second
stage is not economically feasible.
6 FLYBACK ENGINES
However, return of the second stage
to earth might be justified on the
basis of restricting the amount of
useless debris in space.
Engineers are considering not onh
the recovery and reuse of the Saturn 5
first stage but recovery of the space-
craft for reuse. A modified Apollo
carrying six passengers would have a
capability of flying approximately ten
missions, with landings in the ocean.
This could be the first reusable space-
craft; but, because of its low rate of
reuse and low passenger capacity, it
is still an expensive transportation
vehicle.
Also under consideration is a lifting
body spacecraft put into orbit by the
Saturn 5 and able to land on an
airplane runway. It would carry ten
passengers and a crew of two. Con-
siderable development effort would
be necessary but this spacecraft could
later be utilized as the final stage
of a multi-stage rocket airplane.
The generation of space boosters
beyond Saturn, if reusability is de-
signed into the system from the be-
ginning, will be one of two types-
vertical or horizontal takeoff.
RECOVERY OF VERTICAL
TAKEOFF BOOSTERS
Horizontal takeoff boosters would
have wings for ascending through the
atmosphere to space and would, on
return to earth, use the wings for a
conventional airplane type landing.
However, if reusable boosters of the
future are to takeoff vertically, the
landing method is not so clearly de
fined. Sophisticated recovery, such ;in

HORIZONTAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING
fixed wings, is justifiable only if each
vehicle makes at least ten flights and
the total mission market is greater
than 100. A new booster much larger
than the Saturn 5 with fixed wings is
not very practical because the struc-
tural weight of the wings would be
too large. And, since the Saturn 5 is
already highly developed, a new ver-
tical takeoff reusable booster could
be justified only if it is larger than
the Saturn. This rules out fixed wings.
Parawings, a recent development, are
light and would give maneuverability
comparable to fixed wings but, never-
theless, the geographical landing area
is limited. Also, there are problems
when the device is deployed under
high dynamic pressure. Steering is not
really necessary for recovery anyway
since the booster would land in the
ocean with or without the parawing.
The ideal recovery and deceleration
system, either for water or land land-
ings, appears to be a combination of
parachutes and retro rockets. Solid
fuel rockets have a high thrust to
weight ratio, low ignition times, and
high reliability. Retro rockets would
be used for final velocity adjustment
prior to touchdown. The combination
is lighter than either a pure parachute
system or pure retro rocket system.
Parachutes would slow the booster to
120 fps and then the rockets would
slow the booster to hover condition at
touchdown. Models have shown that
proper positioning of retro rockets
c an pre-shape the water to give more
favorable touchdown conditions, espe-
cially in rough seas. After landing,
empty fuel tanks would provide the
necessary buoyancy to keep the craft
afloat. The stage could then be towed
to a protective harbor for pickup by
a barge followed by refurbishment
operations. It is estimated that refur-
bishment costs would amount to about
7% of the total cost of the booster.
The actual weight of the booster
would be increased by about 17%
with the addition of the deceleration
system, heat shield and stabilizing fins.
This vertical takeoff (VTO) booster
is one concept of a reusable system—
the other concept being the horizontal
takeoff (HTO) spacecraft.
HORIZONTAL TAKEOFF
BOOSTERS
As space operations increase, hun-
dreds of engineers, scientists, military
personnel and specialized technicians
will be working there and it will be
impractical to give all of them exten-
sive training as astronauts. Thus, there
will be a need for an orbital "bus"
able to operate under conditions of
less than three "G's", and have reli-
able abort capabilities. An "airplane
type" flight into space would satisfy
these requirements.
This HTO craft would be a two or
three stage rocket airplane designed
for flying ten missions. The stages
would be nested one on top of an-
other; and all stages would be winged
for takeoff and for horizontal landings
on a runway. This configuration could
put ten passengers and 6,000 pounds
in orbit or carry a crew of two and
10,000 pounds into orbit. An air
breathing engine for the first stage is
beyond the forseeable state of the art;
but, for purposes of noise reduction,
air breathing engines in combination
with rocket propulsion appears better
than either form individually. The
second stage would be a liquid oxy-
gen hydrogen engine.
After the launch of this vehicle, it
would climb at an angle of twenty
degrees and the stages would separate
when the vehicle reached a velocity

THE NEED AND THE CHALLENGE
by E. L Wachspress
It would be helpful indeed if we could apply an erudite forecasting
technique to the problem of identifying those areas of applied mathematics that
will present the greatest challenge during the next decade. Such a forecast
would not only supply valuable information, but would illustrate the man-
machine interaction primarily responsible for the widening role of mathematics
in our society.
The acute shortage of industrial mathematicians makes such a study
impracticable—there are other, more pressing needs for their abilities. But
we can hypothesize the results of such a study by reviewing the pattern of
industrial mathematics over the past decade and projecting that pattern
against the future, recognizing our forecasting limitations and the unpredict-
ability of embryonic fields.
While the specifics that wre discuss are revealing in themselves, they also
identify overall trends such as the increasing need for processing large volumes
of complex information through high-speed computers and for developing
technologies to solve increasingly complex problems on machines that are
becoming ever more versatile.
The increased realization of contributions made by mathematicians through
computer applications has greatly accelerated the demand for mathematical
talent in industry. As a result, manpower in this burgeoning field is at a
premium; universities everywhere are expanding their facilities to meet this
demand.
University courses provide the foundation upon which a mathematician
builds according to his specialized interests. Calculus, ordinary and partial
differential equations, complex and real variables, algebra, functional analysis,
vector analysis, matrix theory, computer programming and mathematics ol
computation, probability and statistics, transform theory, and survey-type
courses on methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics are

end upon graduation; thereafter it is just more dependent upon the endurance
of the individual. The Master's or Doctoral thesis is often the springboard
into a specific area; the student should be advised to choose his topic
carefully—one that may lead to years of fascinating and rewarding research
as well as increasingly more challenging job assignments.
Many of the mathematical developments during the past decade are the
result of demands in the "new" sciences, such as space and nuclear energy.
In the latter field, many achievements in applied mathematics have evolved
from analytical work in the design of nuclear reactors.
Boundary-value problems such as those encountered in determining stresses,
fluid flow, heat and neutron distribution in nuclear reactors, and a variety of
phenomena have required extensive development of new techniques for
solving linear and nonlinear, ordinary and partial, differential equations in
great numbers and great degrees of complexity.
Industrial mathematicians have been more concerned with solving such
problems than with following the traditional academic approach of developing
existence and uniqueness proofs. The need for immediate answers encourages
the former approach but does not minimize the latter; periodically a new
theoretical result changes the outlook on an entire class of problems.
Variational principles have played a significant role, both in problem
formulation and in numerical solution. Discretization of continuous problems
to enable approximate solution by computerized finite difference techniques
has been accompanied by existense, uniqueness, and convergence analyses, all
requiring a wide background in basic mathematics. Integral equation
formulations are possible for these boundary-value problems and have stim-
ulated development of many techniques such as the Wiener-Hopf method.
The Monte-Carlo technique is developing into a powerful tool for solving
otherwise intractable problems, such as the frequently occurring statistical
problems and stochastic processes. Because of unresolved problems related
to mathematical techniques for variance reduction, however, the efficiency of
Monte-Carlo computations can be greatly enhanced.
Classical eigenfunction expansion methods for approximating solutions
to complex systems have been embellished by assorted schemes such as the
Case-Wigner singular eigenfunction method.
The theory of approximation encompasses many fields of mathematics
and provides a basis for analysis of the relative merits of alternatives for
solving physical problems. Concepts such as those encountered in functional
analysis appear highly abstract but actually have wide applicability to
numerical analysis.
The spectrum of training for industrial mathematics is quite broad; i.e.,
we find that engineering or physics, at the other end of the spectrum from
abstract mathematics, is extremely valuable to an industrial mathematician for
the obvious reason that his major concern is mathematical formulation and
solution of engineering and physics problems. During the past decade, the
need for engineers with greater proficiency in mathematics and physics has
contributed to the expansion of graduate engineering curricula in the
universities.
This demand for scientists and the expansion of facilities for their training

influenced by the development of the computer. Until quite recently, most
industrial mathematicians were concerned with specific engineering and physics
applications, and their contributions were severely restricted by the limitations
of the computational equipment available. Analytical solutions, obtained
only for idealized cases, served mainly as guides for designers and experi-
menters. Today, computers have increased tremendously the industrial
mathematician's stature as well as the significance of his contribution;
computer-implemented analysis now supplants experiment in many areas.
The rapidly expanding capabilities of computers, making feasible hitherto
impossible computations, enhance the position of the mathematician, who
is indispensable for efficient utilization and operation of a computer.
Several distinct computer-oriented disciplines coexist in industry today.
In order to use a computer, the mathematician must be able to communicate
with it. He may manipulate symbols meaningful to the computer, design
languages by means of which he can converse more freely, and develop
logical formalisms which facilitate programming of specific problems. His
contribution is known as computer software. Highly abstract areas of
mathematics, including modern algebra and symbolic logic, provide tools for
the software designer. An informative reference on this aspect of modern
industrial mathematics is Volume 1 of the International Federation of
Information Processing Societies (IFIPS) Congress, 1965, which discusses the
impact of computers on society and the role of the mathematician in designing
means for communicating with them.
Yesterday's industrial mathematician has joined forces with today's numer-
ical analysts whose primary function is to formulate mathematical techniques
for solving physical problems. Sometimes the mathematician can solve the
problem analytically, for he has some rather powerful techniques at his
disposal, but more often he must rely upon the computer. That the computer
has not decreased the importance of classical analysis, but has stimulated its
use, is somewhat paradoxical. If one has analyzed a problem, or class of
problems with similar principles, and has reached an impasse, one now has
recourse to a numerical analysis as elegant as its classified antecedent.
This technique is in its infancy, and a creative mathematician can contribute
much to growth of the technology. Each succeeding generation of computers
has so many new characteristics requiring advanced mathematical techniques
that the challenge to the creative mathematician is assured for years to come.
One example of this challenge is in the solving of equations that describe
the diffusion of neutrons within a reactor. KAPL has been among the pioneers
in this field. Millions of unknowns occur in some studies, and computation
strategy depends strongly upon the data-handling capabilities of the computer.
Mathematical procedures that involved the least amount of data-processing
were best for computers with relatively slow data-processing. Improved com-
puter designs are shifting the emphasis to techniques that require the least
number of arithmetic operations. There is an optimum balance between
calculation and data-processing for each computer. This balance appears
superficially to involve little if any creative mathematics, but the underlying
theory for each scheme may be quite involved and the analysis is far from
routine.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


mathematics journals (the abundance of which, incidentally, demonstrates
the impetus given to mathematics by the computer) to fully appreciate
problems currently under investigation. This suggestion is not directed only
to potential industrial mathematicians; university professors often obtain
research grants for work in the same areas in which industrial mathematicians
are active. Conversely, many industrial mathematicians remain close to
universities— lecturing, attending seminars and advanced courses, and exchang-
ing ideas with the university staffs.
If computer language and utilization will be major problems for tomorrow's
industrial mathematicians, so also will be computer management. Available
resources for the mathematical formulation and solution of physical problems
are so limited that a manager must select very carefully those problems for
which he thinks analysis will be most fruitful. Since a significant percentage of
the budget of a research and development operation may be alloted to
numerical computation on one or more computers, decisions affecting use
of these machines, are among the most critical faced by management. Further-
more, as computer development continues, the relative merits of these new
units must be constantly evaluated to determine the optimum point for
replacing or supplementing a unit. Such aspects of computer work present
demanding, highly specialized management challenges; the increasing value
of managers with technical backgrounds is evidenced by an upsurge in the
number of managers with advanced degrees in the physical sciences.
More intricate technology is a natural consequence of progress, and
specialization is essential for effective implementation of this technology.
The analyst who develops the mathematical model for a physical problem
and the basic methodology for its solution may not prepare his equations
for machine computation. Similarly, software developers are often involved
with long-range planning of computer language and programming techniques
and are seldom expected to transcribe specific equations into a form acceptable
to the computer.
It is rather the task of the programmer to translate mathematical formula-
tions of physical problems into machine language for numerical solution. His
contribution is one of placing programs at the disposal of engineers and
physicists so that they need only supply data in some standard form to obtain
solutions to specific problems as they arise.
Program accuracy is paramount; a great responsibility is imposed on the
programmer since an undetected program error may yield wrong answers to
complex problems upon which important design decisions are based. The
cost of digital computation is high; even higher is the cost of erroneous
computation in an age when printed computer output is all to readily
accepted as fact.
We have described the need for capable applied mathematicians, cited a
few of the development areas of recurrent interest, and assessed the computer
as a stimulant to diverse activity in applied mathematics. Throughout this
discussion, I have focused on one point: today the computer is a dominant
force in industrial mathematics; in the next decade it will be an even more
dominant force—evoking a challenge that will encourage the very best
of creative mathematics.

EDUCATION and RESEARCH
EDITED BY
JAMES MYERS
■
ANN ARBOR-The University of
Michigan is now receiving a new com-
puter that eventually will increase its
computing capacity fourfold or more.
The new system is needed because
the "old" one, an IBM 7090, is satur-
ated with use. It's now being operated
24 hours a day, seven days a week,
says Robert C. F. Bartels, director of
the U-M Computing Center.
The new computer, an IBM Sys-
tem/360, Model 67, is a time-sharing
machine. It's so new that it's been
installed in only two other places be-
sides the IBM laboratories—the Gen-
eral Motors Research Laboratory and
[he Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology. U-M faculty members played
an advisory role in the early develop-
ment of the Model 67.
A time-sharing machine is organized
to permit several persons to use it at
virtually the same time for technical
computation or data processing. Each
user will have a remote typewriter-
like terminal tying it to the cential
computer, and some will have tele-
vision-like screens for illustrations de-
scribed by equations in the computer.
The system switches between remote
terminals so fast that it appears to
each operator that he is the only one
using the machine.
Ten remote units are to be ready b\
midsummer, and eventually as mat)
as 200 will be scattered in laboratories
and offices across the U-M campus.
Bartels said.
IBM personnel are now installing
and checking out the computer's huge,
circuit-packed cabinets in the IM
Computing Center building on Nort]
University Avenue. Walls have been
knocked out and rebuilt to expand
the central computing room. Office-
have been squeezed along walls,
and pushed into corners.
Since the new computer was ordered
in April 1965, U-M mathematician-
and computer exj&gt;erts have been re

guage for it.
The former language was called
MAD, for "Michigan algorithm de-
coder." Now they're developing
MAD/1 for the time-sharing machine.
It's expected to be taught next fall.
In the meantime, the 2,000 students
who learned the old computer lan-
guage can continue to use it as they
complete homework and research as-
signments. The computing people at
the University devised an intermediate
language, or translator, to convert
MAD automatically for the new com-
puter. The translator is called Go-
MAD.
Bartels says the computer has as-
Mimed an important role in instruc-
tion and research at the U-M. Not
only are a large number of students
using it to complete study assignments,
but an increasing number are taking
advanced courses in use of the com-
puter.
"Enrollment in these courses is go-
ing up dramatically," Bartels notes.
T here are more than 500 students
taking the basic mathematical or pro-
gramming course this semester, when
normally enrollment drops off."
"And enrollment in the most ad-
vanced course, in which the mechanics
of computers is taught, has tripled
over last year. There are 92 in this
course, whereas normally 25 to 30
are enrolled."
Many students and research staffers
receive basic instruction in program-
ming in a series of five evening lec-
tures. No credit is given for these, but
the large lecture hall is always jammed
with 400 or more students plus a
hundred or so staff members.
Michigan pioneered in using the
computer in undergraduate courses,
and believes it now has more students
using the computer than any other
university. This in addition to the
computing requirements of the ad-
vanced research by graduate students
and faculty members.
The IBM System/360 has some four
limes the capacity and five times the
speed of the IBM 7090 it replaces.
Even so, Bartels estimates that it will
be forced into 24-hour operation with-
in a year.
But the new machine is flexible
enough to cope with the pressure.
Its capacity can be doubled simply
by hooking on another System/360.
| That is already planned and provided
! for. Bartels said.
While the installation is going on
and during initial operation of the
System/360, the old IBM 7090 will
also be operated to handle the de-
mand.
The components of the new system
already installed represent a $2.4 mil-
lion investment. When the unit is
complete, its value will be about $5
million.
ANN ARBOR-University of Mich-
igan Regents have appointed Prof.
Harry Benford as chairman of the
department of naval architecture and
marine engineering.
Prof. Benford replaces Prof. Rich-
ard B. Couch, department chairman
for the past 10 years, who will take
a one-year leave of absence to help
organize and develop a large new
shipyard in Quincy, Mass. Regents
also approved Prof. Couch's leave
today.
A graduate of the University, Prof.
Benford has been on the faculty since
1948. Before returning to Michigan
to teach, he worked for eight years
with the Newport News Shipbuilding
8c Drydock Co.
Since returning to the U-M, he has
been a consultant to numerous ship-
yards and other maritime groups.
During 1959-60 he was on leave to
serve as executive director of the
Maritime Research Advisory Commit-
tee of the National Academy of
Sciences-National Research Council.
In 1957 he received the President's
Award of the Society of Naval Archi-
tects and Marine Engineers (SNAME)
for the best local section paper of the
year. Prof. Benford is a member of
the society's council.
Prof. Couch joined the U-M in 1957
after having served as chief naval
architect in the Navy Department's
Bureau of Ships in Washington. He
was previously head of the Ship Di-
vision of the Navy's David Taylor
Model Basin.
He has also worked as engineer for
the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard and
as naval architect at the Puget Sound
Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Wash.
Last November Prof. Couch was
awarded the David W. Taylor Medal,
SNAME's highest honor, for "notable
achievement in naval architecture
and marine enginering." He was
elected vice president of the profes-
sional society at the same meeting.
FT. CHURCHILL, MAN.-Engi-
neers of the University of Michigan
Space Physics Laboratory have
launched a series of small rockets to
try to measure possible fluctuations in
gravity waves high in the atmosphere.
The launchings at the Canadian
missile station are to check a theory
forwarded by University of Chicago
aeronomist C. O. Hines that such
waves not only exist but have a
definite period, or time cycle. Hine's
theory indicates a period from peak to
peak of 200 minutes, give or take a
100 minutes.
No one previously has suggested a
definite period.
U-M meteorologists point out that
there are two current schools of
thought about how gravity waves may
exist in the atmosphere.
One maintains that such waves are
created by wind masses passing over
high mountain ranges. The other
holds that these waves are created by
masses of air themselves moving about
in the upper atmosphere, the mass
creating its own measurable gravity
disturbance.
Hine's theory doesn't exclude either
school, it simply indicates that the
waves may have a definite, measurable
period.
The Michigan engineers will make
their measurements with instruments
rocketed to altitudes of six to 50
miles to record variations in tempera-
ture, density, and pressure in the
atmosphere.
By carefully timing the firing of
the six rockets in a single day, any
correspondence between those varia-
tions and the suspected period would
be revealed, they point out.
The project is being carried out by
the U-M electrical engineering lab-
oratory under sponsorship of NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center.
Another high-atmosphere experi-
ment was carried out Tuesday (Jan.
24) by U-M engineers at Cape Ken-
nedy, Fla.
Six instrument packages were fired
200 miles up by Nike Tomahawk
rockets over an 18-hour period to
measure variations in the temperature
and density of natural nitrogen.
That experiment was one of a series
aimed at a better understanding of
h;gh-atmosphere physics. But the in-
formation gleaned is expected to have
tlirect practical application for Cape
Kennedy scientists in their launching
and control of satellites and space
vehicles.

obtained, however, at the Placement Service.
THE SUPPLY
Almost one thousand engineering students utilized the
Placement Service for regular and summer employment
at all degree levels. The increase in the number of degrees
granted by the University was 6%. A decrease in B.S.
degrees granted from 62% to 51% almost equalized them
with the total of advanced degrees.
A very substantial drop of 21% in the number of
citizens interviewing for regular employment is believed
to be the result of increased liability for military service.
The total number of interviews for both regular and
summer employment also dropped substantially in spite
of a 13% increase in the number of students interviewing
for summer jobs.
The average number of interviews per student decreased
from 12.1 last year to 11.3 despite the large number of
recruiting visits. The average number of plant visit
invitations increased about 10%, but the number accepted
decreased slightly. See table I.
THE DEMAND
Employer activity reached an all-time high with an
increase of 17% in the number of employers scheduling
visits and 15% in the number of visits scheduled. Much
of the increase was accounted for by an increase in
the number of "first-time" employers from 76 to 120.
An increase of 47% in the number of cancellations, mostlv
due to insufficient student appointments, resulted in an
increase of only 11% in the number of visits completed,
however.
The proportion of large employers again declined
bringing it back to the level of three years ago and indicat-
ing increasing activity of smaller organizations.
The average number of offers per student increased h\
about one offer at all degree levels, reflecting the general
increase in the volume of offers.
STARTING SALARIES
Starting salaries increased nearly twice as much as last
year at all degree levels: 4.7% for B.S., 4.0% for M.S.. and
6.0% for Ph.D's. These increases at the B.S. and M.S.

ported by the nation-wide College Placement Council
Survey, but the Ph.D. increase was twice as much as the
.1.0% re[)orted by C.P.C. These are not considered to be
large differences in the averages themselves, however,
in view of the relatively small numbers on which the
report is based.
Comparing the various programs at the B.S. level,
Electrical resumed the lead at $675 with Chemical, the
leader last year, dropping to fifth place among the major
programs with $661. In the C.P.C. survey, however, Chemi-
cal is still in the lead at $682 with Aerospace and Electrical
l imning very close at $681 and $679 respectively. At the
advanced degree levels, there was very little difference
between the major programs except for Civil which con-
tinues to show a substantially lower differential for the
M.S. degree.
Considering industries, differences at the B.S. level were
the smallest ever reported, with a spread of only about
$20 per month. Somewhat larger differences were indicated
at the M.S. level, however, with Aerospace and Electronics
leading at $8.11 and $820 respectively, followed by Pe-
troleum, Automotive, and Chemical in that order. This
again emphasizes the high premium for the M.S. degree
in the space and defense industries.
Government salaries were substantially lower than in-
dustry, except for the M.S. level with the Federal Govern-
ment. Education, although still lower than industry, seems
to be becoming quite comparable, especially at the Ph.D.
level. See table II.
POSITIONS ACCEPTED
The proportion of graduates starting their first jobs in
Michigan continued to increase to a total of 36%. This
was mainly at the expense of other midwestern states,
however, as the proportions going to the east and west
remained substantially the same.
The proportion starting with large firms dropped con-
spicuously from 63% to 51% with gains of 4% and
8% respectively for medium and small employers. This
was the largest variation experienced for several years,
and may indicate increasing activity of smaller organiza-
tions. See table III.
SUMMARY &amp; FORECAST
The volume of demand for technical graduates was
evidently the greatest since the current shortage first de-
veloped about 1950. This was evidenced by large increases
in recruiting activity, large increases in starting salaries
and an increase of 38% in the volume of offers reported
in the nation-wide College Placement Council Survey.
Demand seemed equally strong from both commercial
industries and government contractors.
This demand was aggravated at Michigan by the fact
that there were 20% fewer students interviewing for
regular employment than last year, in spite of a 6%
increase in the number of degrees granted. This is believed
the result of mounting military demand.
An even stronger market is indicated for next year
by an increase of nearly 40% in advanced bookings for
recruiting visits compared to an increase of about 10%
at the same time last year.

THROUGH
THE AGES
The world-famous Golden Gate Bridge is currently getting a new facelifting with
a paint rich in zinc. If you were to attempt to paint the Golden Gate by yourself,
you'd need 7,000 gallons of paint and 150 years to do the job! Once applied,
the zinc-rich paint will protect the steel bridge from corrosion for ten to 15 years
without repainting.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


on drive under an over-the-highway
iridge ... or pause to watch workmen
&gt;rnshing a huge water-spanner with
inc-rich paint ... or read about a
lew bridge soon to go up—give a
.bought to the days (only 500 years
igo) when most people thought a
bridge could be built only with the
ielp of the Devil!
It was believed that the Devil was
lord of all the world's waters and his
blood boiled every time they were
crossed by God's creatures. So when-
ever Irish peasants crossed a bridge,
they used to pray for the soul of the
builder because "Sure, and the poor
fellow must be roasting in hell!"
Many folk tales link bridges with
magic happenings. Other stories asso-
ciate bridges with miracles. And all
of us have seen movies in which a
bridge is used to symbolize love, mar-
riage, romance or mystery.
lesus said: "The world is merely
a bridge; ye are to pass over it."
Xerxes, the Persian Emperor, be-
headed the chief engineer when a pon-
toon bridge was destroyed by a storm
on the river. (Hot-tempered Xerxes
also ordered 300 lashes as punishment
for the river.)
"London Bridge is falling down,
falling down" was once close to the
truth. It never actually collapsed, but
it did sag dangerously because too
many houses and stores were built on
it. The famous bridge, begun in 1176,
look 33 years to build and was the
renter of London social life for 600
years.
Bridges through the ages were thus
thought dangerous things at best, and
it wasn't until 1779 when the first
iron bridge went up in Coalbrooke-
clale, England, that people began to
believe the Devil's powers over bridges
and their builders might be ended.
With the arrival of steel, the long-
span bridge became the challenge of
the hour. Cities, countries—all began
the clanking and riveting competition
for longer and longer suspension
bridges—competition that gave us
such early marvels as the Brooklyn
Bridge which unofficially ushered in
the Miracle Age of suspension bridge
building.
Everything about the new suspen-
sion bridges seemed eternal—except
their "record" lengths! In the old days,
Roman emperor Trajan's 170-foot
stone arch bridge held down first
place for 12 centuries. Brooklyn
Bridge's 1596-foot record lasted only
20 years. In 1931 the beautiful George
Washington Bridge blazed a new rec-
ord—3500 feet of suspended steel.
Surely this was a record that was un-
breakable—but it was broken only six
years later in 1937, when the Golden
Gate Bridge in San Francisco, with its
4200-foot suspended center span, sur-
passed that record.
To give you an idea of the size
of this great structure, if you were to
attempt to paint the the Golden Gate
by yourself, you'd need 7,000 gallons
of paint and 150 years to do the job.
As it is, a team of 30 men are
presently engaged in the 5-year job of
hand-coating the bridge with a zinc-
rich paint (sprayers can't be used be-
cause of the high winds). A paint rich
in zinc was selected because in addi-
tion to sealing out the corrosive salt
air moisture, it also protects by a
unique electrochemical action. This
means that the bridge won't require
repainting for ten to 15 years. The
painting will in no way impede the
more than 80,000 cars that cross the
Golden Gate every day.
The Romans, of course, had no
need of corrosive resistant zinc paint,
since their bridges and aqueducts were
built of stone. In fact, six of their
masonry arch bridges over the Tiber
River still stand in Rome. The most
beautiful of these is the Ponte di
Auguste, built about 5 B.C.
The bridges of history—whether in
Rome, San Francisco, or wherever you
may travel, tell a rich story and are
worth seeking out. For example, seek
out the old European bridges lined
with small shops. Or the Quebec
Bridge over the St. Lawrence, longest
cantilever bridge in the world. Look
for the mysterious Bridge of Sighs in
Venice, spanning the canal between
the Duke's Palace and the prison.
After receiving sentences in the palace,
prisoners sent across the bridge were
said to sigh very loudly. If you're
ever in Turkey, look for the oldest
bridge in the world, a 40-foot stone
slab 2810 years old in the City of
Izmir, a bridge said to be crossed by
the blind Greek poet, Homer and St.
Paul the Apostle.
We've come a long way since the
first cave man grunted and dropped a
log across a stream to keep his feet
dry. Our zinc-coated steel suspension
spans are, to the history of bridges,
what the steel skyscraper is to the his-
tory of architecture.
That old bridge-breaking Devil has
been run out of business! He tried a
comeback recently in Monroe, Wiscon-
sin, Swiss cheese capitol of America—
where the local bridge suddenly col-
lapsed. However, experts found it was
an excess of lactic acid flowing into
the river from the local cheese fac-
tories!

A MAN'S GAME
Danger is a man's game—and as
American psychologist William James
once said, "Men need the moral
equivalent of war"—in other words,
men rise to a challenge, need a bat-
tle to win; they perform best under
stress, and often need dangers to
demonstrate everything manly.
This is what psychologist Alfred
Adler called "masculine protest"—
defying life's perils. Men, danger, and
women have always been closely psy-
chologically related. Whenever there
have been daring men, beautiful wo-
men are present as admirers—to fight
for—or as an irresistible challenge in
themselves!
Danger is an inescapable fact of
life—but how certain men face these
hazards has been the subject of heroic
myths, adventure stories and today
is the object of careful psychological
research. Dr. Franz Alexander, noted
University of Chicago psychologist,
says that most people naturally avoid
risks, others almost recklessly march
out to defeat them. However, a ro-
mantic few think of fate as female
and playfully charm her. This can

clearly be seen in any daring pursuit
i from mountain climbing and war to
I automobile racing.
To speak of danger today, we must
I speak of the automobile—the power
anil beauty of these swift machines
has a deadly fascination for modern
i man. In this age of mass traffic and
i hundreds of horsepower, safety rules
i force (people to project their urge for
, speed and risks into the universal
sport of Grand Prix automobile rac-
ing where a few men live in high gear.
Realizing this, psychologists have ex-
amined the emotional meaning be-
hind racing and what breed of man
can regularly tolerate death risks.
IMuch of this research was studied by
MGM and incorporated into the spec-
tacular and dramatic Douglas and
, Lewis production, "GRAND PRIX,"
, a John Frankenheimer film in Cin-
ierama and Metrocolor produced by
Edward Lewis and directed by Frank-
enheimer.
There are two theories about the
sort of men who seek and live with
danger. Dr. Karl Menninger, foun-
der of the Menninger Clinic, main-
tains that the "death instinct" is
evident in the activities of dare-
devils—he believes "the greatest sat-
isfaction comes to those who not only
rise to the limit of their capacity, but
occasionally are ready to take risks
beyond their limit." This view is well
understood by the director of MGM's
"Grand Prix," John Frankenheimer
—himself a competition driver in Cal-
ifornia—who says "these racers are
dominated by a feeling of pride, they
think they can face death . . . maybe
the whole thing is a strong sense of
individuality which can't stand the
thought of living and dying like any
man in the street . . . maybe this is
ambition?"
This sort of playing with death has
a powerful spell for real men. [ames
Garner, MGM's star in "Grand Prix,"
has a reputation for handling fast
cars, wild horses and beautiful wo-
men—and refused to have a stunt man
do his driving! Lloyd's of London
found out and cancelled Garner's in-
surance for $250,000. Garner's re-
ply: "In the sport of auto racing, it's
worthwhile to take one's life deliber-
ately, meritoriously and consciously."
Other "Greats" have felt the same
way—Aly Khan, world playboy Por-
firio Rubirosa, Count Wolfgang Von
Trips—all men of fast cars and beau-
tiful women meeting death at high
speeds on the curving roads such as
those in France, Monaco, England,
Belgium. Holland and Italy—all
actual locations for the filming of
"Grand Prix."
Yet drivers are not all daredevils.
For some of them, racing is an hon-
orable, exciting way of directing
life's normal tension. Dr. Joseph
Wol]&gt;e of Temple University's De-
partment of Behavioral Sciences
calls this "an assertive response" to
life—"behavior which openly expresses
spontaneous and appropriate feeling."
FEBRUARY 1967

anxiety. Highly dangerous sports give
a man a chance to assert himself.
Stanford University psychologist
A.A. Maslow has shown that men have
a higher need for achievement and
that "self esteem" often comes with
winning or dominance in competi-
tions. With all life's normal frustra-
tions, a man has to put his foot down
somewhere and the foot down on the
accelerator is often most assertive,
most satisfying.
James Garner, interviewed during
one of the track trials, gave his own
personal feeling: "The essence of rac-
ing is that like life it should be danger-
ous"—psychologically a healthy at-
titude. But to represent the emotional
reality of Grand Prix racing, MGM
had to choose big people, real men
and women who accept life and its
dangers: Garner, former racer, cow-
boy, hunter and athlete . . . Yves Mon-
tand, French stevedore, fighter, sing-
er and automobile collector . . . Tos-
hiro Mifune, famed Japanese actor
renowned for his powerful portrayals
of ancient Samurai warriors . . . Brian
Bedford, Englishman extraordinaire
. . . and young Italian co-star An-
tonio Sabato, of whom directors even
said "All this guy cares about is cars
and women." Garner has often ob-
served, "Cars are like women, both
require strength, softness and control."
The leading women in GRAND
PRIX who provide these important
elements are Eva Marie Saint, Acad-
emy Award winner portraying a fash-
ion magazine editor; Jessica Walter,
fresh from her triumph in the film
version of "The Group'" appearing as
the wife of one driver and the para-
mour of a second; and exciting younj
French songstress Francoise Hanl\
who typifies the rootless wanderer*
who follow the Grand Prix circuit
from country to country and continent
to continent in search of an impov&gt;i-
ble tranquility.
The characters of GRAND PRIX
are on a quest for pleasure, and Cali-
fornia psychologist Erik Erickson de-
scribes the pleasure in competition
and success as a "head-on-attack"
on life. So here we're back to man's
need for danger, volunteering for haz-
ardous duty; "nothing ventured—noth-
ing gained." ■
THE TECHNIC PHOTO CREW
Technic photographers sometimes
go to unusual lengths to obtain the
photographs used in the magazine.
Jim Myers, left, who is also our fea-
tures editor, took an eighty-mile jaunt
with the present editor-in-chief Curt
Crysler to catch the glow of a steel mill
at dusk for our November full color
cover. Recently Jim conned Robert
Zeisloft, the former editor-in-chief, into
using his pilot's license to the Technic's
advantage by renting the Piper Chero-
kee shown below so that Myers could
capture a bird's-eye-wew of campus,
which is shown opposite the editorial
page in this issue.
Bruce Kuhnert, right, took advantage of some of our recent clear but cold weather and came up with an idea for
this issue's cover. Burton Tower, a famous landmark of the Michigan campus, is shown with the new outdoor art
exhibit filling the foreground. The picture captures some of the winter beauty of campus as seen from the eyes of

THERE'S A REVOLUTION (JET)
IN THE MAKING
Stop for a minute and think about the
supersonic revolution in air travel that
will take place in 1971. Then give some
more thought to the revolution itself.
The new jets and the speeds they will
travel. The passenger and freight termi-
nals that must be expanded to handle
the huge loads that will descend from
the giant transports.
Where does TWA fit into this revolu-
tion? Leading the innovators. We were
the first airline to order U.S.-built
supersonic transports when they were
still on the drawing boards. Our new
fully automated cargo terminals are al-
ready planned to circle the globe.
Be a part of this revolution, and make
a contribution to the dynamic changes
under way right now.
Right from the beginning, you'll be
thrown into hardware-oriented engi-
neering in many ways tougher than its
design and research cousins. Problems
like analyzing stresses in aircraft struc-
tures, evaluating power plant and
aircraft performance, developing new
maintenance and overhaul procedures,
designing tools and specifying equip-
ment requirements, designing plant
layouts—all demanding activities. Not
"ivory tower" problems, but rewarding
in equal measure, for you'll see your
ideas in action.
Begin to see what we have to offer?
The next generation of jets can fur-
ther speed your TWA career. And as
you move ahead, you'll soon see that
time isn't all that flies.
BS and MS degree candidates in
mechanical, electrical, aeronautical and
industrial engineering are invited to

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


In this year of celebration, the whole campus has joined in paying tribute to the University's hundred and fiftieth
year. The Technic, too, wishes to take time out to praise The University of Michigan for excellence in all fields and at
all times. As our part of the Sesquicentennial celebration we have devoted the entire March issue to reflections of the
past. Since not in a single issue nor even in all the issues of a single year could we reflect on all the happenings of a
hundred and fifty years, we on the Technic staff have collected articles dating predominantly from the one or two
decades before and after the turn of the century. Because the Technic, the nation's oldest engineering college maga-
zine, dates back eighty-five years to 1882, we have endeavored to obtain our material from old issues. And, since the
Technic is an engineering and scientific journal, we have chosen to reprint technical stories of some of the topics of
keenest interest in that time period. We also have included stories of historical interest about the College of Engi-
neering and about the Technic itself. Above is a picture of the beginning of the college of engineering, the first engi-
neering building, and below is the editorial of 1888 in which the name "The Technic" was first proposed as a
shortened form of the earlier years' title. We hope you'll join us in pausing for a moment to reminisce with Michigan
while the University moves on to greater excellence and more progress in all her fields of endeavor. C. C.
EDITORIALS.
The Technic Board has endeavoured to select from the papers read
before the Society those most worthy of preservation, and can but regret
that it could not have trebled instead of doubling the former size of the
publication, for there were many other papers read before the Society
that were well worthy of publication. Besides these papers the Board
has attempted the innovation of a frontispiece, and take great pleasure
in presenting to its readers the portrait of a most conscientious and
thorough teacher, and thus offering a slight tribute of the good will that
our Society feels towards one of its best friends—Prof. Chas. E. Greene.
Besides the frontispiece we have the sad honor of presenting, as a Me-
morial from his classes, a phototype of the late Professor Byron W.
Cheever. The Technic has heretofore been published as a Series of
Selected Papers read before Hie Engineering Society of the University of
Michigan. This legend seemed too cumbersome; the previous Sei'ies have
placed our publication upon a plane where it needs no excuse for exis-
tence, and the Board deemed it well worthy of a name. Its papers are
certainly of a technic nature, and so we have christened it The Technic
And now, hoping that our publication may receive a kindly greeting,
and may be looked upon as a credit to the University of Michigan and
our adopted profession, in behalf of the Engineering Society of the Uni-
versity of Michigan, we place before you '88's Technic

BY OLD STAFF MEN
1887- 1888
We regret very much not to be able
to present a write-up by either our
first Managing Editor, or our first
Business Manager.
1888- 1889
My recollection of my experience
with this publication is extremely
hazy, but believe that I was Manag-
ing Editor from the Fall of 1888 to
the Spring of 1889. The only thing
that I recall now is that while we had
considerable difficulty in securing in-
teresting papers for our publication,
we had much greater difficulty in get-
ting sufficient advertising matter to
furnish the capital required. Thk
Technic was in its infancy at that
time and we were able to get out but
one issue during the college year,
which required our utmost efforts at
that time. The management has in
later years been able to do much bet-
ter than this, and one who has been
through the mill knows that the pres-
ent editors must devote a great deal
of time to this work.
I regret that lack of time prevents
my giving, you an extended history of
work at that time, but feel sure that
you will appreciate the fact that it is
extremely difficult to call to mind, on
short notice, happenings 29 years ago.
I can only add that I hope the good
work will be kept up and The Tech-
nic will continue to grow in the
future as it has in the past.
Richard Khuen, Jr., '89.
1890
My recollections of details of the
work back in 1890 are a bit hazy.
What stands out is the writing of nu-
merous letters to obtain material for
publication, and the up-to-date editors
of the present day do not seem to be
able to overcome this habit. Though
The Technic has passed through
many vicissitudes it has grown with
the University, and is now a most
creditable college publication, and the
issue of four numbers a year we
should have thought quite impractic-
able when the work was done by a
smaller board.
The aim, of course, is to mark an
advance each year in its usefulness.
The worth of The Technic is mainly
to the undergraduate, and, with the
right veiwpoint, the judgment of The
Technic staff should be the best
guide in the selection of articles. Don't
use a lot of dry stuff you don't under-
stand, and don't want to read, simply
because you think it may appeal to'
the alumnus and give a high brow ap-
pearance to the publication. I think
some of the most valuable issues of
the early Technic were those con-
taining articles by the professors, in
which they presented some branch of
a subject usually covered in a lecture
course; in the printed form it was
more fully and clearly stated and
more easily studied.
The mere description of engineer-
ing works and manufacturing plants
is more properly for the professional
newspapers, the weekly technical jour-
nal, unless some new application is
involved. Articles treating general
methods and principles, not already
fully covered in text books, are for the
college publication. Such articles as
"Dynamics of the Reciprocating En-
gine," "Deflection of Beams," "Dis-
integration of Cement Floors and
Sidewalks," that have appeared in
The Technic, illustrate this class.
The "Alumni Notes" is a good fea-
ture, although of interest mainly to
the alumni, but this is enough of a
concession to the old fellows. They
have other sources for technical ar-
ticles—frequently more than they can
cover—and in The Technic they are
interested in seeing what the college
is doing—its professors and students.
The articles contributed by profes-
sors are likely to be of the greatest
value to the undergraduate, and per-
haps to the older men too. In any
case, the alumnus who is interested
in the University will read with the
greatest zest such matter as is cov-
ered on pages 169 to 186 of the last
issue, not forgetting the important
article at the bottom of page 168,
which will be to many of us the most
interesting feature of this number, as
it has always been an inspiring one.
L. C. Sabin, '90.
1891
Those of us who worked on the
1891 Technic worked just as hard
and in about the same way as the
present staff is apparently doing. We
had no faculty supervision and the
staff, or board as it was then called,
had to pay personally any deficit, if
there was one. So you may be sure
we tried hard to get out a good num-
ber and to obtain advertising enough
to pay for it. In my own experience
we were successful. Some.other is-
sues of the publication were not.
Dwight B. Cheever, '91.

A note from the office of R. P.
I.amont, Managing Editor in 1891,
and now President of the American
Steel Foundries, stated that he was
out of town and thus unable to send
us his write-up.
1894
Looking back over twenty-three
years I now realize that the The
Technic must have been well man-
aged in its seventh year to have at-
tained to its present growth and
prosperity. I can recall that it re-
quired much restraint to omit from
the frontispiece the photograph of
the Board of Editors all of whom
were some day to become prominent
engineers, and to substitute therefore
the photographs of plain professors,
four in number, Campbell, Patterson,
Ziwet and Wagner.
We did not attempt editorials in
those days, but devoted our time
instead to securing ante-mortem
euloguies of the aforesaid professors,
technical articles, and advertising con-
tracts.
There was great glee in headquar-
ters when Professor Carpenter of
Cornell sent in material for twenty-
two printed pages on engine testing,
thus assuring the volumetric success
of our journal, and that too without
a single half-tone illustration. For in
those days half-tones would almost
pass for legal tender.
Mr. F. C. Noble, our Business Man-
ager, was the man that traded adver-
tising space for trade and thus con-
verted the trade into the wherewithal
to meet printer's bills. He is now a
highly successful consulting engineer
in New York City.
I am writing this on my way to
California to testify as expert in
litigation connected with the specialty
of concrete bridge design and super-
vision that I have followed for the
past seventeen years.
Editorially you have made of The
Technic a creditable engineering
publication, but believe me, we of its
earlier years were some managers.
Daniel B. Luten, '94.
1895
The 1895 Technic was a "corker,"
at least that was what the Technic
Board thbught. Formally the Board
was listed as follows:
Alex. M. Haubrich, Managing Edi-
tor.
Herman Burr Leonard, Business
Manager.
Thomas Durand McColl, Homer
Wilson Wyckoff, Charles Henry
Spencer.
As a matter of fact, all the mem-
bers worked together so harmoniously
and earnestly that the credit for the
success of the '95 Technic was due
to each.
Looking back, the writer's most
vivid recollections are of the many
strenuous meetings in Leonard's rooms
to find ways and means to raise money
to finance the proposition. The at-
tacks on the faithful advertisers in
engineering publications were many
and varied but they finally "came
through." In the mean time, we sus-
tained many a shock when material
came in C. O. D. with nothing in the
treasury and not much more in the
"jeans" of the Committee. But we
finally "put it over" and left a clean
record.
Our great "hit" was a write-up on
the Observatory. Professor Hall pre-
pared the article. Interesting photos
were reproduced of the Observatory.
Biographs and excellent photograv-
ures of the many world renowned
astronomers that were associated with
the University of Michigan were also
included.
Another direct hit was the article by
Frank P. Davis, '76, on "The Nic-
aragua Canal Project," fully illus-
trated with maps and cuts.
Several other valuable papers were
included, and still others had to be
omitted, due to the limited size of the
publication.
Another feature of the '95 Tech-
nic was that it came out on time and
with a new cover. The cover was
designed by Homer Wyckoff. Homer
was a thorough student, a born artist,
an efficient engineer and a gentleman.
He has since crossed the "Great Di-
vide."
Alex M. Hauhrich, '95..
1898
At present I do not recall much
about the details of publishing The
Technic in 1898, except that of try-
ing to solicit sufficient advertising
funds to pay for publication.
The country had not recovered
from the severe financial stress of the
few preceeding years, and business
was not keen placing advertising in a
publication of small issue. Ours was
an annual of about one thousand
copies. The deficit amounted to about
thirty dollars at the end of the year
and was paid by the members of the
Board. The amount though small
seemed very large, I presume, owing
to the fact that we were just com-
pleting our college course, with our
future positions not yet assured.
I recall especially the keen interest
and kindly advice and help given as
by our much beloved Professor J. B.
Davis.
It has been very gratifying to me,
on recent visits to Ann Arbor, to
have the opportunity of going into the
well appointed office of The Tech-
nic and noting the business-like way
in which the publication is now con-
ducted.
Sutton Van Pelt, '98,
Business Manager.
1908
It has been nearly fifteen years
since our 1902 Technic was issued,
and I was Managing Editor. Just
previous to 1902, The Technic had
found the going not altogether
smooth. The Faculty had therefore
decided to give us some financial as-
sistance, which, supplemented with
our advertising which was supported
almost entirely by the alumni, enabled
us to get out our issue and pay all of
our bills.
Fifteen years is a long time and the
writer has forgotten most of the facts
regarding our 1902 Technic that
would be of special interest. One of
the special reasons for my failing
memory in this regard, is due to the
fact that all of the work for both de-
partments was done by Mr. Robert
Hall Merrill, one of my distinguished
classmates who is now with the New-
York Barge Canal. Merrill was one
of these highly intellectual parties,
and college work, as he expressed it.
was a mere bagatelle, so that it took
practically none of his time, and the
last half of the year he devoted con-
siderable time and energy to The
Technic.
About all I can remember is sitting
up nights reading proof; some of
which I understood and a greater por-
tion of which was away over my head.
I have read The Technic continu-
ously since graduation, and take a
great deal of pleasure in noting the
continuous improvement. We had
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


class and at that time the Engineer-
ing College was a part of the Literary
Arts Department. We had no sep-
arate class organizations, and there
were no engineering societies, and all
our student activities were in connec-
tion with the larger Literary Depart-
ment. C. W. Brooks, '02.
1904-05
In recalling my part as Managing
Editor of The Michigan Technic
in 19x54-05, two things of especial note
occur to me. The first was the change
from the old annual to a semi-annual
publication, which was ultimately ac-
complished for little more than the
cost of the one issue in preceding
years, thanks to a change of publish-
ers. That was the first year the Ann
Arbor Press, under the' energetic
management of Otto Hans, handled
The Technic, and I recall our joint
efforts and pleasant associations with
considerable satisfaction. The other
noteworthy recollection was the fact
that for the first time in the history of
The Technic, so far as then current
testimony proved, we closed the year
with a balance in the treasury, not-
withstanding the fact that we had
fallen heir to the usual deficit from
the year before and had fittingly cele-
brated the success of the new semi-
annual with a banquet to our loyal and
encouraging Advisory Board. This
record is a fitting tribute to our Busi-
ness Manager, Lyle Whitsit, whose
efforts coupled with the generous co-
operation of the publishers made for
our success.
In those days the Technic Board
was made up of five seniors and one
junior, the Chairman or Managing
Editor being he who had served on
the preceding Board as junior. I was
unfortunate in not having had the val-
uable experience of the junior year,
for as I recall, I was elected Chair-
man to fill a break in the succession.
Notwithstanding that, however, I
thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated
that year on the Technic Board, and
recall with pleasure the splendid cali-
ber of the men who were my as-
sociates, and the friendships cemented
at that time. There were besides
Whitsit, mentioned above, Ral Parker,
Walt Smith, Delmar Teed, seniors,
and Ben Braun, junior. Braun
crowned a strenuous apprenticeship
with noteworthy success as Chairman
in the succeeding year.
In commenting on Technic affairs,
1 cannot close without adding a word
of appreciation for the splendid publi-
cation now issued as The Michigan
Technic and the remarkable im-
provements of the last few years. All
those who have been connected with
this progress deserve great credit, and
I know I make no mistake in congrat-
ulating you and your associates for
the high standards maintained. The
Michigan Technic is the most wel-
come publication that comes to my
desk.
Ralph R. Tinkham, '05.
1906
It is getting to be quite a long call
back to the days of our struggles with
The Technic in 1906, but there are
two things which stand out prom-
inently in my memory. One was
reading proof and the other finances.
Seemed as if there was always some
proof to read, reams of it, and maybe
right at a time when you could think
of a lot of other things to do of a
lighter and more agreeable nature.
However, in this matter I happened
to be quite fortunate as there were
four other individuals in our house
who seemed to have a good deal of
waste time on their hands. Those
were Smith, Watson, Perkins, and
Kempton, '06 to '09, respectively;
evidently they had never read proof
before and were greatly interested in
my efforts. Right there I saw a splen-
did opportunity. Having read Tom
Sawyer at an earlier day and remem-
bering the episode of painting the
fence, I decided to try out Tom's
scheme on the above worthy material.
Dilating on the importance of the
work and showing reluctance to sub-
let any of it, they were immediately
very eager to take it off my hands,
and so they did most all of it, and did
a splendid job of it, as The Technic
of that year will prove.
Then there was the matter of fi-
nances which was no little worry. As
The Technic was now a semi-annual
publication, funds must be procured.
Here again we were singularly for-
tunate as we had a genial and withal
exceedingly industrious Business
Manager, Justin Kingdon. The money
requirements began to loom up bulky
and thereupon we had a serious busi-
ness session.
Now any one knows who knows
anything, knows that "Business Man-
ager" means one who gets the busi-
ness. After much talk and agreement
it was finally made clear to Kingdon
that this was his entire function and
that he must get in all the money. His
duty being plain, he went at it with a
rush, and with great success.
We both left Ann Arbor immedi-
ately after graduation and before all
bills were paid, but were happy in
knowing that enough ads had been
sold to pay all expenses of publishing
for that year.
I cannot say there was anything
particular in our issues of The Tech-
nic that was new or different from
those published before. There was
one thing though we felt rather proud
of, and that was the design for the
front cover. We made a live drawing
of the archway under the Engineering
building and this cut was used for sev-
eral years after in all issues.
In closing I may say despite the
great amount of work required to get
out an issue in those days when no
credit was allowed for the effort, I
have only a pleasant memory of the
hours spent on The. Technic
B. N. Braun.
1907
I wish I could write you something
that would be worthy of a place in the
Thirtieth Anniversary Issue of The
Technic, but in plumbing the well of
memory for what may have happened
ten years ago nothing much seems to
come to the surface.
However, there is one thing for
which we think the old Twentieth
Volumn is to be noted for and which,
it seems, was the forerunner of a new
development in design. And that is
the article by Prof. S. J. Zowski on
the Design of Water Turbines. We
had considerable difficulty in inducing
Prof. Zowski to write the article for
The Technic. That was his first
year in teaching at Michigan, he had
been in this country only about two
years and pleaded considerable dif-
ficulty with the English language. We
co-operated with him to the best of
our abilities—which weren't much—
and as a rough draft the article was
a big success. Soon after graduation
I heard much praise for this new
treatment of the subject from engi-
neers of long experience.

W. F. GERHARDT. '17
&lt;&lt;TF WE could be sure they were
A safe!" How many sympathetic
people have listened kindly to the
aerial propagandist, as he expounds
the advantages and joys of the third
mode of transportation as represented
by the aeroplane, only to quench
the fire of his enthusiasm with
this disheartening half-question. On
this point the aforesaid exponent of
travel via the starry blue may quote
mortality statistics by the mile or hurl
aeronautical theory by the gross ton,
but he can neither bind nor smother
that still small voice.
Maybe the conversion of these kind-
ly people is of no importance to the
aeronautical world. Certainly it has
devotees enough; in fact it is some-
what hampered at times by their num-
bers and enthusiasm. On general mis-
sionary principles, however, it does
desire to do so. We present, there-
fore, incontestable proof of the con-
tention that aircraft can be made one
hundred per cent safe.
At the outset we cannot refrain
from a chagrined admission that the
solution of the problem has come from
men apparently unacquainted with the
aeronautical field, in fact, even out-
side the engineering profession. The
only probable explanation seems to
be that an altruistic desire to end the
war has stimulated their genius in
perfecting aircraft to the point of
great accomplishment.
Proceeding to the matter in hand
we would like to call attention first to
a very novel type of aerial creation
called the Fly-plane (Fig. X.—We use
the latter end of the alphabet as it is
yet unknown whether or not they will
fly). Here we have, according to a
description in one of the popular mag-
azines, a very compact or condensed
form of airplane, for it measures but
twelve feet span and ten feet length.
The condensed fuselage takes the form
of a straight-jacket which, with its at-
tached wings, fits the pilot very com-
fortably. The walls are hollow to
contain the fuel and oil necessary to
the operation of the condensed motor.
This motor, a gnome, vest-pocket edi-
tion, operates a condensed propeller,
the apparent function of which is to
cool the pilot when the fight is hottest.
At least, if it were intended to product
a useful thrust it would be located so
that entire blast would not be deflected
by the jacket.
Launching and landing this graceful
18
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


'3oo Pea"
craft is of course a simple matter.
Bulky landing gear is replaced by
fleet and graceful human pedal ex-
tremeties. To dart into space the pilot
has only to start the powerful motor,
run at lifting speed, and hard up the
helm. Now it is claimed that these
craft can fly at a maximum speed of
100 miles per hour. From the very'
nature of an aeroplane, not excluding
condensed goods, the landing speed
must then be 35 to 50. This will make
this type of aircraft very popular with
track men. We were going to predict
that as vehicles for social calls, the
Fly-plane would be ideal for society
ladies, but second thought suggests
that prior to that time must come a
modification either of the speed in the
former or of running gear in the lat-
ter.
There is no mention made as to the
material from which the Fly-plane is
made. Some one has suggested that
from the character of the name it must
be fly-paper. It is further recommend-
ed that when the craft is produced in
quantity, as its originator claims it
will be, its trade name be "L'Avion a
l'Ange."
Turning from this type of fighting
plane, we may, for the sake of con-
trast, well direct our attention to the
giant offensive weapon of Fig. Y.
What could be more desirable than a
huge boat-shape helicopter which
could rise from the water without a
rapid forward speed, dart to the
enemy's fleet, hover over them and
with some uncanny means, as the
canned lightning here shown, utterly
destroy the whole of it? Why not in-
deed provide large roomy decks, where
the crew may move about with ease
and comfort, operating the heavy
siege guns, and discharging the five
tons of bombs carried? Nothing pre-
vents, according to the inventor, a
siege gun expert.
A few queries about the apparatus
as here represented, demand attention.
Why should the blast from the lifting
propellers be deflected horizontally by
the decks, thereby giving zero use-
ful lift? Or why again put the light-
ning tanks perpendicular to the direc-
tion of motion, when by placing them
longitudinally the resistance offered to-
forward motion could be reduced
three or four times? If, however, we
forget foolish questions of this char-
acter, we are prepared to admit that
here we have the potentialities for
putting an early end to the war.
Speaking of a speedy termination of
the horrible European (now European
ar.d American) struggle, wc are im-
pelled to glance at Fig. Z where in-
perspective sketch is shown the idea
which emanated from the brain of a
college Professor of Greek and Anci-
ent History. No, we do not have here
twin progeny of the old mill wheel of
sacred memory, nor yet lunch counter
order of Ferris Wheel "make it two" r
merely the craft which will end the
war in thirty days.

BY V. C. VAUGHAN.
The question of the water supply of small cities is one of great inter-
est and importance. There are in the United States each year about
40,000 deaths from typhoid fever and not less than ten times this number
of cases of sickness from the same disease. Many eminent sanitarians
believe that impure drinking water is the sole cause of typhoid fever, and
all physicians agree that such water is accountable for the great majority
of the cases. It is certain that if contamination of the water, soil and air
with animal excretions were wholly prevented there would be no typhoid
fever. This is no idle dream of visionary students of public health. It is
already a practically accomplished fact in a few cities. In 1849 the death rate
from typhoid fever in Munich was 24.6 per 10,000 inhabitants. At that time
the excretions from the body were deposited in privy vaults and the drinking
water was taken from shallow wells closely adjacent to the receptacles of
filth. First, sewers were built and the use of vaults prohibited. Later, a
fresh water supply was introduced, and in 1884 the death rate from
typhoid fever in Munich had fallen to less than 0.5 per 10,000 inhabitants.
A result almost equally striking has been accomplished at Vienna. Even
in New York with its notoriously garbage filled alleys, the death rate from
typhoid fever, thinks to care taken with the water supply, is only 2 per
10,000 and in Brooklyn only 1.5 per 10,000, while the average throughout
the United States is about 6.6. In truth, this, the typical filth disease of
the century, is more prevalent in the small cities and villages than in the
crowded metropolis with its great hordes of paupers from every nation
gathered in its huge tenement houses.
If typhoid fever has been practically stamped out of existence in
Munich and Brooklyn, why should it be allowed to prevail in our small
cities and villages? The failure to prevent the ravages of this disease
cannot be attributed to ignorance of its nature and origin. We are not in
the condition of the inhabitants of London, when visited by the black
plague in the 17th century. They were attacked by an unknown foe.
They knew nothing of the origin of the disease and practically nothing of
the means by which it was spread. They were struck down by an invisi-
ble hand. This is not true to-day and especially not true of typhoid
fever. The enemy hangs out its banner from every slaughter house the
offal from which pollutes the river or lake from which the city takes its
water supply. It establishes its garrison of germs in every filthy cess-pool
and vault. Notwithstanding these visible evidences of the approach of
this disease, it is allowed to slay 40,000 of the "flower of the land" an-
nually.
Would it pay to exterminate this disease? In answering this ques
tion, I will lay aside all questions of sentiment and look at the matter ex-
clusively from pecuniary standpoints. Conservative estimates place the
value of the average adult life to the state at $1,000. This is reached in
two ways: (1) the average production of the adult, and (2) the average
cost of rearing a person from birth to the age when that person becomes
able to support himself. If the average adult life is worth to the state
$1,000, the average life of those destroyed by typhoid fever is still greater;
because the majority of deaths from this disease occur in early manhood
or womanhood. But taking this estimate, the financial loss to this country
yearly in the deaths from typhoid fever amounts to $40,000,000. Then
there are at least 360,000 who are sick, but not fatally, who are incapaci-
tated from labor for weeks. The sum lost to the state in this item would
reach up among the millions. It should be remembered that these figures
represent an annual loss, and it will be admitted that these suuis saved
for a few years would supply every city of 2,000 or more inhabitants in
this country with a safe drinking water supply. ■

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


TRAFFIC
PROF. A. H. BLANCHARD
JANUARY, 1921
We have been familiar, for many
years, with the utilization of high-
ways for the transportation of pas-
sengers through the medium of horse-
drawn vericles and runabouts, tour-
ing cars and limousines. A develop-
ment in this field with which the high-
way engineer must reckon is the in-
stallation of motor-bus routes on
highways ouside of municipalities.
England has had an enormous devel-
opment in this field during the past
fifteen years. In this country, such
development had gained a certain
headway prior to the War, as indicat-
ed by the successful operation of 125
rural motor-bus routes in 1914 in the
State of New York. Motor-bus
routes have been rapidly developed
for the transportation of passengers
between urban districts which are not
adequately served by steam and elec-
tric railways. Another development
along this line is the utilization of the
motor-bus for the transportation of
children to consolidated rural schools.
The State of Mchigan is at the thres-
hold of this development and should
give it thorough consideration at once
in order to provide adequate high
grade educational facilities for its
rural population. To give some idea
of the development of traffic in this
field, it is well to call attention to the
fact that approximately 2,000,000
children living in 65,000 old rural
school districts throughout the United
States are now being transported
daily throughout the school year to
13,000 consolidated schools.
This discussion will be limited to a
consideration ofl pavements suitable
for interstate and intrastate trunk
highways which will be subjected to
an intensive motor truck traffic. The
width of the pavement should first be
given consideration. Roadways eco-
nomically designed must provide for
carrying the traffic on the paved road-
way surface and not rely upon
the shoulders to carry a part of the
traffic or serve as turnouts. It has
been demonstarted that the latter prac-
tice is neither economical from the
standpoint of the maintenance of pave-
ments and shoulders nor is it efficient
or safe from the standpoint of the
traffic using the highway. In other
words, we must provide for a mini-
mum of two lines of commercial traf-
fic and it is obvious that an operator
of a heavy motor truck will insist
upon allowing a certain amount of
leeway betwern the outside wheels of
the truck and the edge of the pave-
ment since many operators have had
unfortunate experiences with motor
trucks being stalled in soft shoulders
or ditched. Considering th"? factors
of widths and speeds of passenger
cars and motor trucks utilizing trunk
highways and that the laws of many
states permit a maximum width of
ei?ht feet for motor trucks, takrn in
conjunction with th? rapid increase
in the volume of traffic on trunk high-
ways, the conclusion is reached that
twenty feet, for the width of the pave-
ment surface on a trunk highway,
should be considered the minimum.
There are highways where the norm-
al traffic requires provision for two
lines of vehicles and the abnormal
traffic particularly on holidays, Satur-
day afternoons and Sundays will
render the adoption of twenty-four
to twenty-six feet justifiable. This is
due primarily to the fact that pro-
vision should be made for vehicles
standing at the side of the road while
temporarily requiring repairs. While
traveling on a highway in the vicinity
of Detroit on a Sunday during July,
eighteen vehicles parked at the side
of the roadway, and under repair,
were passed in fifteen minutes on a
five mile section. If the transport
survey indicates that the normal
amount of traffic will require provis-
ion for more than two lines of ve-
hicles, a greater width than twenty
feet must be adopted, the additional
width depending upon the character
of the traffic. It does not require
much imagination to reach the conclu-
sion that many interurban highways
will be subjected, during the next de-
cade, to traffic which will necessitate
roadways sufficiently wide to accom-
modate at least four lines of vehicles,
which would mean a width of thirty-
eight to forty-eight feet.
If these recommendations relative
to the requirements of present-day
traffic on trunk highways are not con-
sidered conservative, contemplate the
following facts pertaining to the in-
crease in the use of motor vehicles
during a period of five years. In 1914,
the total registration of motor ve-
hicles in the United States was 1,711,-
339, while in 1919, it was 7,558,848.
This means one motor vehicle to
every fourteen persons throughout
the Union. In Michigan, the 1919
records show that there was one
motor vehicle to every ten persons.
During this same period of five years,
the number of motor trucks in us? in-
creased from about 136,000 to 750,-
000. An conservative estimate indi-
cates that the registration of motor
trucks in 1920 will exceed 1,000,000.
The highways outside of our mun-
icipalities have had a changable status
during the past thirty years and the
reasons advanced for their improve-
ment has been many and varied, but
mostly sound. Fortunately, there has
been rapidly developing throughout
the land a conviction that highways
are merely a means to end and that
end is the economic and efficient
transportation of passengers and com-
modities. It has also become self-
evident that unimproved and improp-
erly built highways constitute a posi-
tive barrier to the development of
economic highway transport. In or-
der that highway transport should
take its proper place in our trans-
portation system, the following fund-
amental guiding principle must be ac-
cepted generally: Highways should be
designed, constructed, and maintianed
so as to enable them to carry efficiently
the motor vehicles required for the
rapid development and economic util-
ization of highway transport. m

TRACKS.
G. B. Springer,
Class of 'UO.
The right of way of the Illinois Central Railroad extends along the
shore of Lake Michigan from the Chicago terminus at Lake street to
Forty-seventh street, a distance of about five miles. Thence it begins
to diverge from the lake shore passing through one of the most desira-
ble residence parts of the city which is well populated about as far south
as Sixty-seventh street.
South of Sixty-seventh street are numerous suburban points on the
main line and on branches running
to South Chicago and Blue Island
which are about twelve and sixteen
miles respectively from the city.
The suburban traffic on the main
line is carried on as far south as
Homewood, which is twenty-five
miles from the city.
Seventy trains are run daily eacb
way between the city and Sixty-
seventh street at which points some
of these trains branch off for South
Chicago, while others leave the main
line further south for Blue Island
the remainder continuing to the end
of the suburban route on the main
line.
The commutation traffic of this
road is the largest in the United
States, the number of passengers
carried on its suburban line during
the year ending June 30th, 1892 be-
ing 7,945,937. During the year 18S7
4,828,128 passengers were carried
thus showing that the suburban
traffic has increased over fifty per
cent, in the past five years. During
22
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


two minute intervals from the city to Jackson Park.
For this World's Fair traffic, which is separate from the regular
suburban service, trains of ten cars, carrying about one thousand people
per train will be used, making the number carried per hour thirty
thousand. The cars were made especially for the purpose, the seats
being arranged as in ordinary open street cere.
The economy of time in unloading these trains will be evident when
it is said that from the time tbe train stops until it is drawn off empty
but thirty seconds elapse.
The regular suburban service will accommodate twenty thousand
people pet hour thus making it possible to transport fifty thousand
people per hour to the World's Fair site.
If the tracks had remained at grade and this enormous traffic been
carried on it would have been well-nigh impossible for vehicles or
pedestrians to have attempted to cross them without the most fatal re-
sults.
In view of these facts and in order to provide for the future use of
the streets intersecting the right of way without grade crossings, the
elevation of the tracks from Fifty-first to Sixty-seventh street was under-
taken.
Actual field operations were begun about the 20th, of June 1892. and
construction has since been pushed to completion, in accordance with
an ordinance passed by the city council of Chicago May 23rd, 1892. The
work has thus required about one year.
The elevation of the finished roadbed is 20.5 feet above city datum
while the average elevation of the old roadbed was 10.5 thus making the
embankment about ten feet in height.
Approach grades beginning at Forty-seventh and Seventy-first
streets connect the old roadbed with the elevated at Fifty-first and
Sixty-seventh streets, the gradient used being .3 of one per cent.
The embankment is of sand which was brought from a point in
Indiana near the lake shore, about twenty-six miles from the city.
The cars used in transporting the sand are similar to ordinary coal
cars and contain from thirty to thirty-two cubic yards, which is about
four or five times as much as flat cars ordinarily carry.
About six or eight inches of gravel was used for ballasting.
The roadbed will accommodate ten tracks for which the whole of
the two hundred foot right of way is used,excepting about forty feet on
the west side, on which are located the stations. These are left on the
lower level in their original positions, retaining walls having been built
in front of them to hold the embankment Two stairways at each
station for reaching the elevation are built in openings in the abutments.
At the street intersections plate girders, supported by columns and
masonry abutments, admit of the roadways and sidewalks being carried
beneath the tracks.
The abutments are locat3d on the property lines of streets where
there are no stations, but where there are stations the abutments are set
back of the property lines from forty to fifty feet. The space thus left
under the girders between the abutments and sidewalks is available for
extra ticket offices of the company or as rentable ground for stores,
stands, etc. On each curb line there is a row of columns spaced the
same distance apart as the tracks, being thirteen feet center to center
except where stairways occur, when the distance is twenty-six feet.
The distance between curb lines varies from forty to fifty feet ac-
cording to the widths of streets.
In general there are at street crossings three spans of eleven girders
each, the central span, extending between the two rows of columns,
being about forty feet in length while the side span extending from the
columns to the abutments,are from forty to fifty feet in length on some
streets and from ten to fifteen feet on others according to the location
of abutments as noted above.
The streets are lowered about three or three and one half feet on
the right of way and are connected with the original street surfaces by
slopes of one foot in twenty-five beginning at the right of way lines.
All depressed roadways and slopes are macadamized and a proper
system of sewage is instituted ; also seven to ten foot sidewalks are built
on the right of way and on slopes where old walk hae been disturbed,
all of which is done and to be maintained at the expense of the rail-
road company. ■

FINAL EXAMINATIONS
For some time the faculty and oth-
ers, who have really given much
thought to the matter, have seriously
questioned the value of final examin-
ations as given heretofore. About
one-seventh of the total time presum-
ably available for instruction has, till
this past semester, been devoted to
final examinations.
To quote from the March, 1917,
Technic,—"We spend one month out
of each nine trying to show the fac-
ulty that they have taught us some-
thing in the other eight. They ought
to have a fair idea of that themselves.
In those four weeks we do nothing
constructive or permanent."
The peculiar conditions due to the
war seem to have brought the whole
matter to a head, with the resujt that
classes in the Engineering College
were continued right through the time
that is ordinarily set aside for finals.
The various departments provided
such "written or oral tests of scholar-
ship" as they saw fit, these tests being
given during the regularly scheduled
periods for each course.
The system was successful where
the members of the faculty really got
the idea and entered into the spirit of
the scheme, which was to save the
time usually devoted to finals and use
it for some really constructive work.
Many students" have become much op-
posed to the plan. Doubtless this op-
position is made up largely of those
who were under the dominion of
some misguided faculty member who
felt that it was his duty to provide
quite a respectable final examination
for every meeting of the class during
the entire two weeks. Such a system
is vastly worse than the old method of
giving finals, and we can only say that
we are entirely in accord with the op-
position.
Let us sincerely hope that all facul-
ty members will cooperate to the full-
est extent in carrying out the true
idea of this new plan to gain time, if
this system is used again this coming
June.

Engineeresses.
A new refining element has been
gradually creeping into the Engineer-
ing Department within the last few
years. Reference is made to the ever
increasing number of young ladies
who are taking up the study of En-
gineering. A few years ago it was
not unusual to have two young ladies
in the engineering classes, but last
year there were six and this year thir-
teen!
The young ladies have been making
i^ood, too, as examination of the roll
of class officers of the Sophomore and
Freshman classes will show. One of
them is Vice-President of the Sopho-
more class, and another is Secretary
of the Freshman class. They are up-
holding their end of the scholarship
standards, also, and are not proving
a drag on the classes in any way, as
many have imagined. Two of the
young ladies have set a good example
for the rest in joining the Engineer-
ing society, and have thus signified
their intention of helping out the En-
gineering Department in its inside
work.
The girl who is not afraid of the
hard, uncasing toil of the Engineer,
who is willing to soil her dainty hands
in the attainment of an engineering
education, who is anxious to take such
an active part in the upbuilding of the
material world, deserves nothing but
the highest respect and consideration
of the Men in the Engineering De-
partment.

the "future soldiers" talking about the hard
workout they were given the night before
Drill is held every day, rain or shine, and
although for several weeks there was very
little "shine," the men were there just the
same.
The military suits have not yet arrived
but are expected soon. With their arrival
the campus will undoubtedly present a very
warlike aspect at all times of the day.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


NEW SERIES, NO. 14-15.
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ENGINEERING SOCIETY
THE NEW ENGINEERING BUILDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN.
BY PROFESSOR DENISON.
The rapidly increasing1 prominence assumed by the engineering'
profession is one of the significant facts of our time, profoundly
affecting every phase of modern life. Its direct bearing upon grave
economic and sociological problems and its resultant effect upon the
prosperity of the state, and its consequent recognition as a prime
factor in the ultimate issue of national and racial supremacy, have
all tended in a marked degree toward a new and revised estimate of
its worth to the world.
Furthermore, a knowledge of the long years of strenuous scien-
tific and professional training now required of those who would lead
in the physical constructive realm of the world's work, together with
the honorable rewards incident to successful achievement, have
largely enhanced the newer conception of the engineer's position.
One of the notable results of this increasing public esteem for
the profession is a more than willingness on the part of governments
and of private wealth to provide liberally for the suitable and digni-
fied housing and equipment of engineering schools, where able and
earnest young men may be thoroughly trained to become, literally,
the constructors of the future.
Doubtless It is in this spirit of an enlightened comprehension of
new conditions, as well as a conviction of the imperative, immediate
wants of the engineering department, if it is in any adequate way to
fulfill its function to the state, that the Board of Regents of the Uni-
versity have unanimously entered upon a liberal policy toward the
Department. At the last meeting of the board plans by Mason &amp;
Kahn, of Detroit, were adopted and the erection of a new engineer-
ing building determined upon, which, when completed, will not only
relieve the present encumbered and congested condition, but will
form a fitting establishment and home for the Department, affording
adequate accommodations for both the faculty and students, as well
as a safe and commodious shelter for the constantly augmenting col-
lections of models, apparatus, instruments and equipment. Beyond

oughly up-to-date fittings will by the saving of time and energy alone
enormously increase the efficiency even of the present teaching force,
and in numberless ways add to the facilities for the acquisition of
knowledge, to Bay nothing of the actual working convenience and
comfort of the student body.
To the "old graduate" and those of the faculty who recall condi-
tions existing say twenty-five years ago, the new installation will pre-
sent some striking and most encouraging contrasts.
For many years the engineering classes occupied three or four
rooms only in the old South Wing of University Hall, rooms formerly
used for student dormitories in the early days. They were heated by
wood stoves stoked by the professor or an obliging student from
immense wood-boxes, daily filled by "Jimmle" Ottley,—the same
"Jimmie 11 long since promotod to an easy berth in the cloak-room of
the Library. The water needed for the drawing room was supplied
from a battered zinc pail, refilled from time to time as use demanded.
It was a restricted environment,
"With creaking stair and wind-swept hall"
and old pine drawing desks "scarred by many a truant knife," but a
great deal of excellent work was done there, although under very
disadvantageous conditions and heavily discounted by the lack of
accommodations.
The new building will be in every way a notable antithesis to
these ancient quarters.
The site selected is the southeast region of the campus, inter-
sected by the beautiful " diagonal walk," dear to every University
habitue. The building itself will face on both South and East Uni-
versity Avenues, with a main central portion facing southeast and
northwest. An arcade 14 feet wide and 66 feet long will span the
diagonal walk, thus preserving that favorite pathway and converting
it into a most dignified and attractive approach to the entrances of
the new structure. This central portion, with its arched portals, will
be the most conspicuous architectural feature, with a ground plan 66
x 57 feet and a total height of some 75 feet, being four stories in the
clear. From this median part extends to the west on South Univer-
sity Avenue what we will call the South Wing, 60 x 174 feet, and on.
East University Avenue the East Wing, being in plan 60 x 213 feet,
with an extension to the north 22 x 100 feet for the prolongation of
the naval tank, while to the west at the north end of the East Wing
will extend a North Wing 60 x 60 feet for the steam laboratories, and
at the west end of the latter a projection 34 x 34 feet for experi-
mental work in high-pressure steam.
From this ground plan will rise a structure three and a half and
four stories high, containing one million five hundred thousand cubic
feet of space, of satisfying architectural lines, the style being that
of an adapted Renaissance, and to be erected at a cost, it is hoped, of
something less than $150,000.00.
The first story will be builtof rock-faced native field stone; the rest
of a dark, reddish-brown, vitrified paving brick, while the roof is to
be of red tile. Such is a rough outline of the latest authorized addi-
tion to the architectural examples on the Campus, which, together
with the present engineering building, the engineering shops, the
laboratories and the heating and lighting plant, will form an assem-
blage of buildings for the purposes of engineering instruction quite
comparable with any in the country. Indeed, the new building in
point of size, convenience and architectural effect will, it is believed,
rank well with any three or four used for its exclusive purpose in the
United States.
Entering now, more into a detailed description of the uses of the
various parts of the building, it is well at the outset to state the fea-
tures common to each of the storieB. First, all floors are to be of
concrete and expanded metal construction, thus rendering them fire-
proof and practically sound-proof as well. Through the middle of
each wing on all floors and through the central part extends a contin-
uous corridor eleven feet wide, out of which open the various lecture
rooms, recitation rooms, drawing rooms and offices. This main corri-
dor will therefore be about 400 feet long on each of the floors.
The entire building will be warmed by direct radiation and ven-
tilated by fans or blowers delivering 2,000 cubic feet per occupant per
hour. The steam will be distributed overhead in passages or ducts
near the outside walls of the building. The returns will be carried in
a special duct under the floor of the basement corridor.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


will not be depended upon for beating the building, except in mild
weather. At the close of work in the building the ventilation may be
entirely shut off and the warmth of the building maintained by direct
radiation. This system affords the maximum economy possible with
adequate ventilation when the building is occupied.
With the exception of the library and faculty room, the entire
inside woodwork will be southern pine throughout.
Entering now from the southeast corner of the campus, one trav-
els over the old diagonal walk for a distance of about one hundred
feet, passing under the southeast portal into the arcade, the walls of
which are of hammer-faced, light buff, Bedford limestone. The
vaulting will be of brick with stone ribs, while the pavement under
the arch will be of colored stone and brick.
To the right and to the left are windows guarded with artistic
iron grills, to be made in the University shops. At suitable points
hammered ironwork lanterns protect electric bulbs for lighting this
public passageway at night. Turning to the right, one passes through
one of the main entrance doorways to the ground floor of the East
Wing into a broad entrance hall to one of the main stairways. Here
along the east side and projecting one hundred feet north of the
building proper, will be found the naval or ship-testing tank for the
department of naval architecture. This tank is an altogether novel
feature, it being the only entirely enclosed and protected tank for
this purpose, and therefore available in all weathers, located at any
educational institution in the world, and marks a distinct advance in
the equipment of a school for naval architecture. The University of
Michigan will therefore occupy the unique position of being the first
university to build and equip such an experimental tank. The tank
is 22 feet wide, 300 feet long and 10 feet deep, with dry dock, model
rooms, etc., attached, and a gallery running entirely around it.
Although primarily for marine investigations this tank will also be
available for the mechanical engineering department and prove
itself a most valuable adjunct to the hydraulic laboratory.
Passing the staircase at the main entrance to East Wing, on the
west side of the corridor opposite the naval tank, are first the toilet
and locker rooms, then the physical testing room and the compressed
air room. These rooms together extend the entire length on the west
side of the East Wing. The physical testing room will contain test-
ing machines for the different kinds of materials used in engineering
construction, including apparatus for testing cements, concrete and
brick.
Passing from the East Wing into the North Wing, the first room
is the hydraulic laboratory, 32 x 56 feet, with a clear height of 14 feet.
This room is adjacent to the naval tank and contains a well 3 feet
wide and 20 feet long, connected to the bottom of the naval tank
from which a supply of water is obtained for the laboratory. The
different pumps will take their suction from this well and deliver into
a large weir tank where the water can be measured and thence
returned to the naval tank. A centrifugal pump of about 7,000,000
gallons daily capacity and a pressure pump of 1,000,000 gallons capac-
ity to work against a pressure of from 200 to 300 pounds per square
inch, will be features of this laboratory.
The south end of the hydraulic laboratory will contain one or
more ice machines for experimental work in mechanical refrigera-
tion.
The west end of the North Wing, 56 x 60 feet, will be devoted to
experimental work in steam engineering. In addition to the present
steam equipment, this laboratory will contain a special multiple
expansion engine, with cylinders arranged to secure a great variety
of expansions, with reheating receivers and other apparatus for work
with steam at unusually high pressures. The new equipment will
include steam turbines.
Extending to the north at the west end, is the boiler room in which
will be erected the present 35 horse-power boiler for pressures of 200
pounds per square inch, and a new 100 horse-power boiler for pressures
of 500 pounds per square inch. This new boiler will contain a super-
heater of a capacity to superheat the steam 200 degrees. The boilers
will be connected directly to the chimney in one corner, and will also
be provided with fan for induced draft. Space is provided in the
boiler room for a gas producer plant for the production of gas for fuel
purposes. A gallery 8 feet wide surrounds the boiler room, upon which
will be placed the induced draft apparatus, feed water heaters and
weighing tanks for boiler tests.
Returning to the arcade and passing into the South Wing of the
MARCH 1967


engineering department. Here are located two large electrical lab-
oratories, one for direct current for heavy machinery, the other for
alternating current for heavy machinery. Bejond these a series of
rooms for research work, a calibration room, a photometry room for
measurements on electric lamps, and a storage battery room.
Passing up to the second floor by one of the central stairways,
which are situated in towers projecting from the northwest front of
the main building, one comes to the second floor. On this floor imme-
diately over the arcade and occupying the central portion, is located
a beautiful room designated aB the library. This apartment is 30 x 54
feet and is a feature of the building upon which the entire faculty
united as most desirable. It will be wholly for the use of engineering
students, where they can meet each other, read or study, and profit-
ably pass the time intervening between lectures and other engage-
ments. Three large windows face directly southeast and overlook
the diagonal walk in that direction. At either end of the room will
be large eight-foot fire places. Permanent seats in corners and tables
and book alcoves, and such other furnishings as will make the room an
attactive meeting place. The ceiling will be deep overhead open
beam construction, the room finished in oak, with high wainscotting
and red tile floor, all of which will give the room something of a scho-
lastic atmosphere and tone.
The east side of the East Wing proper contains instructors' rooms,
file rooms and two class rooms. The west side contains laboratory
rooms for research work, and a room for compressed air work over the
compressed air room in the basement, a fan room for ventilating pur-
poses, and an instrument room. The north end of this wing contains
a computing room and an instructor's room adjacent to it. A room
20 x 36 feet immediately above the hydraulic laboratory in the base-
ment, will contain a large open tank holding about 4,000 gallons and a
closed tank for high pressure work. Apparatus will also be provided
in this room for experimental investigation of the flow of water
through nozzles and the action of water upon various shaped vanes,
including several types of water motors. The open tank will have a
flume leading to the basement, supplying water to a turbine wheel,
discharging into the wier tank previously mentioned. The location of
the open tank affords a head of about 20 feet.
The entire floor of the west end of the North Wing will be devoted
to general laboratory purposes, including a room for gas and hot air
engines, a calibration room, a room for the analysis of fuels and fur-
nace gases, and a room for the analysis and testing of lubricants.
The South Wing on this second floor will contain the office of the
Dean, lecture and recitation rooms and model room for the depart-
ment of civil engineering. Also two large recitation rooms and a
drawing room for the department of electrical engineering.
On the third floor, starting again from the main stairway in the
East Wing, the east side contains a recitation room with adjacent
study and drawing room 22 feet wide by 90 feet long. On the opposite
side of the corridor are rooms for recitation, for advanced drawing,
for a catalogue file, and for instructors.
With the exception of one room, the entire North Wing will be
devoted to naval architecture and marine engineering. Besides a
class room, a model room and a drawing room, there will be a mold
loft 33 x 60 feet for the laying down of ship lines full size, and for other
practical work of the ship yard, including steaming vat and bending
floor for light wood construction.
The fourth floor is devoted entirely to the work in stereotomy,
mechanism and drawing. In the central portion of the building will
be a large lecture room and office, separated by the usual corridor and
corresponding in size to the room below. In the East and South Wings
will be three large drawing rooms and one smaller drawing room.
These rooms will receive their light from one directon only, that is,
from a glass partition, lighted by an immense skylight situated over
the corridor. The corridors themselves will all be brightly lighted
from above and are especially adapted for the exhibition of drawings
on their wall space. In addition to the above there are four class
rooms. Thus, all the work in this department will be conducted on
one floor, a specially economical and convenient arrangement.
From this outline sketch of the new building it will be seen that
the Engineering Department may expect soon to be in possession of
a building which will be a credit to the University and a distinct and
valuable addition to the public property of the state: A building in
which the people may well take a reasonable pride, and it is certainly
to be hoped that they will avail themselves of all the opportunities it
affords. ■

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Thh Xew Union as Seen from the Old
The new Michigan Union Building is
now up three stories and work has been
started on the fourth. Students and oth-
ers are just beginning to realize what the
size of the finished building will be. If
those who do not yet appreciate it would
go through the part completed and then
mentally add on that yet to be finished,
they ought then to have a fair idea of it.
The firm doing the present work have
the contract for the outside work only and
expect to have the roof on by Christmas.
Probably the contracts for the inside work
will be let soon although the building is
not entirely subscribed for yet. When en-
tirely finished the building will be one such
as ought to make any Michigan man proud
to say that he had some part in its construc-
tion, that he in some way aided in making
the Michigan Union a success.

the new department of Hygiene. The basement and first floor plans
indicate clearly the' general arrangement of rooms devoted to Physics.
The greatest dimensions of the building are 72 by 115 feet. It is of
brick, with red sandstone trimmings. From the main entrance on the
north a descent of live steps leads to the basement, and a short flight of
stairs from the same main hall conducts to the corridor of the first floor.
The basement is eleven feet in the clear, and is finished with special ref-
erence to work in electricity. 1888

two-thirds of a century, Bechtel Corporation has been recognized as a builder for industry and government, and
years as a leading international engineer-constructor. Under single responsibility, the company provides every
service necessary for the complete realization of projects — including economic and technical studies, engineering design,
procurement, and construction or project management.
The Bechtel organization is large and diversified, with many staff specialists. Its deep and varied experience, world-
wide contacts, and capacity for work are made fully effective for client service by the close integration of all activities
under the direct control of the company's management.
COMPANY DESCRIPTION
Bechtel today is the outgrowth of a family construc-
tion business established in 1898. During its early years.
It played an important role in the development of the
West, participating in such projects as Hoover Dam and
the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Headquarters
are in San Francisco, with major offices in various cities
of the world.
Activities are geared principally to the requirements
of such basic industries as petroleum, petrochemicals,
chemicals, natural gas, electric and nuclear power, min-
ing, ore processing and metallurgy, food and paper, ce-
ment and other heavy industrial plants — and to land use
and development. In the public sector, the firm is active
In water use and conservation, rapid transit, and the
missile and space program.
Project responsibility is assigned to one of eight
operating divisions or to a specialized scientific depart-
ment. The divisions are Power &amp; Industrial; Hydro &amp;
Transportation; Mining &amp; Metals; Refinery &amp; Chemical;
Pipeline; International Power, Industrial &amp; Metals; Inter-
national Petroleum &amp; Chemical, and Vernon, California.
The Scientific Development Department provides service
to clients directly and also works closely with the com-
pany's operating divisions.
Engineering offices are located in San Francisco, Los
Angeles, New York City, Washington, D.C., Houston,
Montreal, London, Paris, The Hague, and Melbourne.
Bechtel keeps pace with the growing body of scientific
knowledge in all its areas of interest. The company will,
in the future, continue to meet the requirements of Its
clients in a rapidly advancing world, with emphasis on
work of magnitude, complexity, and challenge.
SPECIAL FEATURES AND ATTRACTIONS
As Bechtel continues to grow, its responsibilities In-
crease, providing capable employees with opportunities
for advancement with commensurate financial rewards
and personal satisfaction. Bechtel has two separate plans
which enable eligible full-time technical and adminis-
trative employees to participate in the company's suc-
cess: the Trust Plan and the Thrift Plan. Contributions
to the Trust Plan are made entirely by the company.
Participation in the Thrift Plan includes contributions
made by employees together with a percentage matching
amount by the company on a regular basis.
The Bechtel Group Insurance Plan combines high-
limit hospital, surgical, and extended major medical
benefits with liberal life insurance coverage for employ-
ees and their families.
All the company's major offices are located in areas
offering outstanding opportunities for cultural, recrea-
tional, and educational activities.
Bechtel is a large and dynamic organization. It is
highly competitive in the best sense of the word. An em-
ployee's future with the company is up to him. Increased
responsibility, accompanied by higher pay, depends upon
the combination of appropriate openings and the individu-
al's demonstrated ability to move ahead. Increasing
knowledge and etfectiveness through participation in pro-
fessional societies, business study groups, and evening
classes can improve one's readiness to assume more

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The design and construction of a spaceship, a computer, an automobile, a nuclear power station, or a modern city require the
use of materials. In fact engineering may be described as the profession which utilizes materials and energy for the benefit of society.
Our casual everyday observation of materials, be they metals, ceramics, or plastics, oftentimes lets us overlook their challenge to the
engineer. What materials, for example, should be used to provide the reentry heat shield of a spaceship, the memory core of a computer,
or the fuel cell of an electric car? The special requirements of each of these components, among many others, necessitate the education of
engineers with special knowledge of materials. Unfortunately there are too few high-school and college students who are aware of the
challenge of materials, and well trained men are scarce.
The challenge of metals, ceramics, and polymers lies in their internal structures. Just as the functioning of a TV set depends on the
internal connections and arrangements of its components, the properties and behavior of a material depend upon the atomic arrangements
and microstructure within it. Dave Jepson, a senior, is using an x-ray diffraction camera in the above photograph to analyze the crystal
structure of a metal so that some of its characteristics may be predicted. If the internal structure is changed during processing or use,
the properties will be changed. Conversely if the engineer wishes to obtain specific properties, he must process his materials so that the
desirable structures are present. This ability to design materials with desired properties is one of the current engineering breakthroughs.
Materials Engineering and Metallurgical Engineering are related but separate degrees as offered at the University of Michigan. The
Materials Engineer studies, selects and utilizes all kinds of materials in his work, be they metals, ceramics, or plastics. The Metallurgical
Engineer, while limiting his attention to metals, must refine and process metals as well as use them. Each requires a sound background
in mathematics, physics and chemistry, and strong support in the Engineering Sciences such as mechanics, thermodynamics, and electrical
circuits.
The Materials Engineering student takes certain metallurgy courses. He also studies polymers, i.e., plastics, and engineering ceramics,
those materials that contain metallic and nonmetallic elements such as glass, dielectrics, and high temperature oxides. He also implements
his basic knowledge of materials through design courses in a related engineering field.
The Metallurgical Engineer is more closely related to the Chemical Engineer in that he must understand the high temperature
chemistry of metal processing. Therefore he emphasizes the thermodynamics and heat transfer in addition to the mechanical behavior of
metals.
Materials Engineers and Metallurgical Engineers have the same chance as any other type of engineer to enter management, research,
sales, production, or teaching. Furthermore his opportunities are wide open because the demand for materials-oriented engineers far exceeds
the supply.
The College's 1967 TECHNIRAMA is scheduled September 22 and 23 as a part of the Sesquicentennial
program for Engineer's Week. Any school group desiring to visit the campus before that time—early May,
e.g.—may make the arrangements by writing to Dean Hellwarth, address below.

we've got a system
for keeping our people
interested in their work.
...the solar system.
At AC Electronics the solar system is our workshop. Some of our work is far out. Like building
the guidance/navigation system for Apollo and LM; or working on SABRE, the new Self-Aligning Boost
and Reentry system for missiles; on the Manned Orbiting Laboratory (MOL); on the Titan III C Space
Booster; and on supersonic and subsonic aircraft of the future.
Some of our work is more down to earth. Like the Ship's Self-Contained Navigation System
(SSCNS) we're working on for the Navy; or the fire-control system for the new Main Battle Tank, a
joint U.S.-Federal Republic of Germany program; and advanced digital computer development for other
military, space and commercial applications.
That's why life is never dull at AC Electronics. If there's anything new under the sun, chances
are we're working on it. And just to make sure you're kept up on what's new, there's our Career
Acceleration Program, which includes "in-plant" instruction. There is also a Tuition Refund Plan
available for any college-level courses taken to advance your career.
If you're completing your B.S. or M.S. degree in E.E., M.E., Math or Physics, check into the
exciting career opportunities at any of our three locations - Milwaukee, Boston, and Santa Barbara.

B. Sc. Those letters have an im-
pressive sound.
But they won't be so impressive
if you get shunted off into some
obscure corner of industry after
you leave college. A forgotten man.
You want activity. You want to
get in there and show your stuff.
All right. How do you propose to

Through Officer Training School
you get a chance to specialize
where you want... in the forefront
of modern science and technology.
Suppose, for example, you
wanted to become a pilot and serve
as aircraft commander on airplane
crews. You'd plan missions and
insure that the aircraft is pre-f light-
ed, inspected, loaded and equip-
ped for the assigned mission. You'll
be trained to fly exciting aircraft.
Just examples. There are so
many more.
Wouldn't it be pretty nice to en-
joy officers' pay and privileges?
And serve your country, as well?
Also, you get retirement benefits,
30 days' paid vacation, medical
and dental care.
B. Sc. Very impressive letters.
Now, do something with them.


engineers and scientists

Turning night into day with outdoor lighting is
one of the many challenges you may face
in your technical career at General Electric.
For example, inquisitive minds in research
and advanced design at General Electric are
evolving many concepts to make our recreation
areas available day and night. Design
engineers are developing concepts into
specifications, while manufacturing engineers
are developing the techniques and processes
that translate designs into outdoor lighting
systems.
In addition, technical marketing specialists are
working with electric utilities and city
planners, applying night-lighting to athletic
stadiums, city parks, or outdoor pavilions.

Don't just stand there.
Do something.
Go Westinghouse, young man.
You can help solve the world's fresh
water shortage. You can help trans-
form slums into beautiful new cities.
You can help curb hunger.
All over the world, nations and
people are living on a narrow edge
of existence simply because they
haven't enough fresh water. You can
help them. Today Westinghouse de-
salting plants are at work around the
world turning sea water into fresh
water. Many more will be needed.
That's where you come in.
You look at a city and see a slum
. . . but think what you can do about
it. In Los Angeles, San Francisco,
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, St. Louis,
New York, Minneapolis and many
other places, Westinghouse is help-
ing to turn slums into beautiful new
cities. This requires skills of the
highest order and the enthusiasm of
dedicated young people.
There is an answer to the world's
food problem . . . under the sea. A
great deal must be done, but the
sea's potential staggers the imagi-
nation. The ocean's floor is the rich-
est, most abundant land on the face
of the earth. Some day man will har-
vest it. Westinghouse has made the
first exploratory beginning. You can
get in on this beginning.
But these are only a few of the
pressing problems we're concerned
about. We need computer designers
to help build systems to control
rapid transit. We need brilliant young
You can be sure if it's Westinghouse

to the System 360 computer when it
finally becomes operational. The capabili-
ties of the CRT are currently being re-
searched by the CONCOMP Project. Future
uses include two or three dimensional
design, stress analysis and circuit design.
The cover picture shows the operator
solving a queuing problem aided by the
computer. By aiming the light-pen at one
of the words at the bottom of the screen,
the operator can cause the computer to
change mode so that he can select new
symbols, place the symbols in the design
and connect them, or erase the connecting
lines and symbols. All these operations
are carried out by aiming the light-pen
at the CRT screen.

IDEA CORR
Right now, hundreds of engineers, chem-
ists, and physicists are exploring their own
ideas at NCR. We encourage them because
we consider idea-people as the backbone of
technological advancement in our field of
total business system development.
And it works. Business Management maga-
zine, in its list of "emerging ideas of
1966," credits NCR with two out of seven:
pioneering in laser technology for record-
ing data, and development of our new PCMI
microfilm storage system.
Whether you're a seasoned pro, or an
ambitious self-starter, and whatever your
degree, if the excitement and satisfaction
of start-to-finish idea development appeal
to you, you'll go far with NCR. And so will

Since the end of World War II, materials research and de-
velopment has become a priority technology. Its growth
has been marked by a new language: viscoelastic prop-
erties, complex modulus, tensile energy absorption,
rheology — the terminology of the space age. And its
growth has been marked by an ever increasing need for
imaginative materials researchers together with versatile,
precise test equipment matched to their advanced needs.
For more than two decades, Instron has been producing
such equipment — sophisticated stress-strain testing in-
struments for college, government and industrial labora-
tories. Scientists use Instron equipment for basic re-
search, to better understand the capabilities of existing
materials, and to develop new materials. Instron instru-
ments and accessories may be found wherever there is
a need for extremely accurate data on physical properties
— from research on single crystals and whiskers to the
development of new ablative materials for the nation's
space program.
As a service, Instron distributes, without charge, reprints
of technical papers of particular interest to materials
scientists and engineers. Each is written by an expert in
his field.

Which degree counts most?
Besides a B.S., M.S., M.B.A., Ph.D.-or what have you-there
are other degrees vital to your future. The degree of imagina-
tion. Ambition. Responsibility.
If you have them in good measure, we know of no company
better able, or more disposed, to reward them. Handsomely.
In terms of professional recognition, intellectually stimulating
environment, and material reward.
We're big. But we're still young and growing. And plan to keep
on. In 1965, for example, our sales rose 23%. To over $860
million. And 516 million in the first half of '66.
We need top-notch people who can grow with us. People
who are well trained in chemistry, physics, chemical, elec-
trical, or mechanical engineering, marketing or finance.
And who have that extra degree.
Talk it over with your faculty and Placement Officer. And re-
gardless of your military commitments, be sure to see our rep-
resentative when he is on your campus. Or

WHY JOHNNY IS A POOR ENGINEER
If you are reading this article, you are probably an engineer.
Don't worry about it, though. I won't tell. You see, I'm one,
too; and I'm just as reluctant to admit it as you are. It's true
that I want to be an electronics engineer; but if that title also
implies that I cannot discuss any non-technical topic or that I
feel ill at ease without a slide-rule in my hand, then I'd rather
be called an "electronics systems analyst" - or just any group
of words without an image. The main reason for this, of
course, is that I don't think I fit with that image.
But the purpose of this article isn't to wage my own little
crusade to inform the readers of this magazine that I'm not
an "engineer." If that were the case, I would feel obligated to
start a crusade for a good number of other engineering stu-
dents who also do not fit the image. My concern, however,
is with the large group of engineering students who are the
cause of the gradual establishment of this image.
This problem, it seems, could be quite easily solved if those
interested in its discussion recognized exactly where the respon-
sibility for its correction lies. Quite precisely, this is with the
individual student. Unfortunately, it is much easier (and more
comfortable for those involved) to discuss "group responsibil-
ity." The individual variation of that awesome abstract hits
a little too close to the conscience.
The panel discussion that was held on March 13 seemed to
be an excellent example of this. After establishing the exact
nature of the problem, the entire discussion concerned itself
with the question of what the engineering college should do.
It's quite evident that some improvements from that group of
people are needed, but they are already in the works. The
simple fact that is continually ignored is that the engineering
college can only do so much. Even with the improvements
that will come of adding a few more hours of non-technical
electives, the engineering program will still only be capable of
giving an introduction to the arts and humanities. After all, its
main job is to turn out well-trained engineers. No one wants
to go to a doctor who commands only 90% of the knowledge
The story above was given to us as an article by a frustrated
treshman engineering student. The subject matter is more like
editorial material, however; and is included as such in this
issue. Miss Nickovich's essay is well worth reading and con-
tains a lot ol truth. Sweeping and imminent changes in the
engineering school are being made in the face ol many criti-
cisms of the school and its curriculum. Rut there is more to
why so many fewer students each year choose to stay in en-
gineering school. Some of the blame lies with the image that
engineering students create for themselves. This seems to be
Shirley's point, and it is well taken. The Technic welcomes
the chance to learn the feelings of others in the engineering
college, and hopes in these times ol self-criticism and change
necessary for his position. Why should anyone hire an engi-
neer who might have a similar rating in his field. So, the
obvious question to ask (and which no one has asked) is
where do we switch the responsibility after the Engineering
College has done its best and fulfilled its obligation to produce
high-caliber engineers.
It is my opinion that we have to shift the focus to the stu-
dent. Although he is the cause of the situation, no one seems
to bring him into it, and he's not about to bring himself into
it. He is extremely consistent in his ability to not care. This
was evident in the turnout for the March 13 discussion. By
the way, the title of the topic for that discussion was, 'Is an
Engineer a Slave to His Profession?" Now, a point that oc-
curred to me and to someone on the panel (though it didn't
get too far) was that the question was one that could be asked
about a man in any profession, not just engineering. If any
man can be a slave to his profession, then perhaps all the
various education disciplines need revision. I hardly think so.
In my opinion, anyone planning to enter a highly profession-
al or technical curriculum should take time to think about and
define this new reference frame. It is extremely obvious that
he is not going to Literature School. Why, then, does he insist
on getting a compact Literature School education in Engineer-
ing College? The student simply has to admit that he is re-
sponsible for his own "liberal" education. The whole problem,
then, stems from the fact that either these students are ignoring
the situation or they just don't see it. Unfortunately, both ol
these are signs of immaturity. Yet, I would hate to think diat
college freshmen are not mature enough for engineering, since
they can obviously do well in their courses. I don't know if
anything will come of a shift in emphasis; but if we at least
place the responsibility squarely where it belongs, perhaps the
students who haven't cared up to now will have to react as
men and face that part of the definition of an engineer that
encompasses the concept of maturity.
Shirley Nickovich
for the engineering school, that more students will take an
interest in what's going on. The changes made now will
directly affect the course of the engineering college for many
years to come. Do you have any new ideas, criticisms, or
gripes about the college? If so, let's have them. Speak out
and make sure the engineering college gets revamped with the
students' interests in mind. Although this is the last issue ol
the Technic until Kali, why not take a little time this summer
to jot down your ideas. Send them to the office, 3077 East
Engineering Building. We'll make an attempt at printing all
comers this Kali to show the administrators that we, too. have a
say in this matter of revamping the school.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


MICHIGAN FRESHMEN
70d» Ate *?6ey?
Reprinted from University Record, March 9, 1967
What are University of Michigan freshmen really like?
Rich? Poor? Intellectual? Lonely?
The best answers in 20 years to those questions are now
available, thanks to the nation-wide study of college fresh-
men conducted last fall by the American Council on Education.
Results of the questionnaires, which are completed by freshmen
on their first day on campus, have now been released to the
University by the Council. A summary of the findings has
been distributed to department chairmen and is available to
all faculty.
The data was collected from all freshmen, not just from a
sample. Of the Michigan entering class of 4,150 freshmen,
4,138 completed the questionnaire.
A question often disputed at Michigan in the last year or
so concerns the economic background of students. According
to this survey, Michigan has about an equal number of
"rich kids" and "poor kids" with the majority coming in between.
Specifically, nine percent of the students report family in-
comes of $30,000 or more, while 18 per cent report family
incomes of less than $8,000. Two percent reported family
income under $4,000 and 6 per cent between $4,000 and
$6,000. Forty-one per cent said their families had incomes
between $8,000 and $15,000.
Asked if they were concerned about being able to finance
college, five per cent of the Michigan freshmen said this was
a "major concern;" 54 per cent said they were concerned
but thought they would have enough money. Forty-one
per cent were sure they would have sufficient funds.
The University's admission application forms do not in-
clude questions about race, but the ACE forms (which were
anonymous) did include this question. The data indicates
that three per cent of Michigan's freshmen are Negro, one
per cent are Oriental, one per cent "other than Caucasian."
Asked what religion they were reared in, 53 per cent of the
freshmen said Protestant, 23 per cent Roman Catholic, 17
per cent Jewish, and 3 per cent "none." To questions about
their own present religious preference, the answers were 45 per
cent Protestant, 21 per cent Roman Catholic, 15 per cent
Jewish, 12 per cent "none."
About half of the fathers of Michigan freshmen have either
a college or post-college degree, and one-third of the mothers
have such degrees. More than 70 per cent of the freshmen
indicated they plan to obtain at least one degree beyond the
bachelor"s.
Eighty-three per cent of the freshmen graduated from public
secondary schools; 12 per cent from private-denominational
schools; and 5 per cent from private-nondenom inational schools.
One-third of the freshmen say there are at least four children
in their families, while another third have no more than one
brother or sister. One-half are the oldest or only child in
the family.
The average grade received in secondary school by these
students is B+. Fifteen per cent report average grades of A
or A+, while 28 per cent report averages of A-. About one-
third have been president of one or more school organizations,
and one-third have won a varsity letter in sports. One-fifth
have taken part in school dramatics, and an equal number
have edited a school publication.
Two-thirds of the freshmen say there is very little or no
chance that they will marry while in college, but 67 per cent
think there is "some chance" or a "good chance" they will
marry within a year after college.
Several questions on the ACE questionnaires had to do
with how thestudents saw themselves and how they characterized
their college or university.
Michigan freshmen believe that their academic ability is
above average - 90 per cent indicated this. But only half of
them believe themselves to be similarly high in "originality"
and "popularity." Seventy-six per cent believe they have "drive
to achieve" and 58 per cent think they have "leadership abil-
ity." Nineteen per cent label themselves as political conser-
vatives and 34 per cent as political liberals.
A small number indicated that they did the following things
frequently during their senior year in high school: came late
to class (4%), gambled with cards or dice (5%), stayed up all
night (4%), cribbed on an examination (1%), participated in
organized demonstrations (2%), smoked cigarettes (12%), went
to Sunday School (25%), prayed (42%), drank beer (9%),
listened to folk music (40%), discussed how to make money
with other students (28%).
A majority of the freshmen at the time of entering the Uni-
versity saw Michigan as "intellectual" (72%), realistic (60%),
and liberal (62%). Seventy-five per cent of them thought
students here are under great pressure to get high grades,
and 90 per cent believed that Michigan builds poise and
maturity. Forty-nine per cent indicated they thought their
classes would usually be run in a very informal manner,
and an equal per cent thought most students are "like num-
bers in a book."

DEPARTMENT OF NUCLEAR ENGINEERING
Nuclear engineering is a new and rapidly growing
branch of the engineering sciences concerned with the
study and utilization of processes involving atomic
nuclei. Man's efforts to develop new sources of energy
to serve his ever-expanding needs have played an im-
portant role throughout our history. Before about 25
years ago, these efforts were limited to chemical pro-
cesses in which the nuclei of atoms or molecules are
unchanged. Enrico Fermi's first nuclear reactor built
in 1942 ushered in a new era in which the nuclei
themselves could be utilized. In this case, the strong
nuclear binding forces resulted in liberated energy
which is typically millions of times greater per unit
mass of fuel. Today's newspapers illustrate the rapid
rate at which utility companies throughout the country
are turning to nuclear power for their new construction
for purely economic reasons. Fission power has clearly
come of age.
Although power reactors are an important part of
nuclear engineering, the field is much broader and
more diverse. At Michigan, the department currently
recognizes three general areas of activity: fission re-
actors, fusion and plasmas, and materials. The inclu-
sion of fusion studies encompasses alternate process
to fission for the production of nuclear energy. The
reaction of two light nuclei to form a "heavier product
can be an exothermic process in the same sense as
the fission of a heavy nucleus such as uranium into
smaller fragments is exothermic. While fusion power
is not yet a laboratory reality, the wide availability of
low-cost potential fuels encourages further research
and study. A large part of this work at present is con-
cerned with a better understanding of the properties
of ionized gases or plasmas which must serve as the
reaction medium.
As in many other applications, materials play a
vital part in nuclear technology. The intense thermal
and radiation environments of the reactor present
unique problems to the design engineer. A funda-
mental understanding of the basic processes through
which radiation and matter interact is essential if
progress is to be made in this area. Further, various
kinds of nuclear radiation are useful as probes to
investigate the structure and dynamics of materials.
The department maintains a strong research interest
in neutron diffraction and inelastic scattering, Mors-
bauer effect, radiation damage, electron spin reso-
nance, lasers, and other techniques for study of ma-
terials.
Course work in nuclear engineering emphasizes
the development of concepts and techniques basic to
a wide spectrum of nuclear applications. It is essen-
tial in the dynamic and developing nuclear field that
sufficient versatility be retained to enable the graduate
engineer to adapt to the ever-changing needs of the
future.
The College's 1967 TECHNIRAMA is scheduled September 22 and 23 as a part of the Sesquicentennial
program for Engineer's Week. Any school group desiring to visit the campus before that time—early May,

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


DAVE OSMER
Dave Osmer represents a lot of traits which are most admirable in college seniors, and is only one
of many such men at The Universfty of Michigan.
Dave's interest on campus has been dedicated to engineering extra-curricular activities. He has been
Secretary, Vice President, and now Past President of the Engineering Council. Dave was also Co-
Chairman of Publicity for Technirama 1966, a member of the Engineering Honor Council, Phi Gamma
Delta Social Fraternity, Triangles Honorary, Tau Beta Pi Scholastic Honorary, and President of
Vulcans Honorary Society.
The Engineering Council, to which Dave gave a major portion of his time, has grown to new pro-
portions of leadership and commanded greater respect on the campus scene.
In a recent interview, he expressed his feelings on what he gained from his extracurricular leadership
responsibilities. He summed it up very well when he said, "I gained a greater feeling for administra-
tive procedures. You might say, I learned how to learn to get things done." As anyone might guess,
Dave has an interest in future administrative positions.
During the interview, Dave reflected on his past year as top executive officer of the Engineering
Council. He expressed the feeling that he led by "innovation." By this he means, he presented ideas
to the Council and strived for the implementation of these ideas.
His major goal upon becoming President of the Engineering Council last fall was to help it become
an active participant in all campus activities. This way the Council could express the views and
feelings of the engineering student to the entire campus. This he accomplished as well as obtaining
a greater interest and active participation of the engineering students in the activities and projects of
the Council.
Dave graduated Co-Salutatorian from Lapeer High School in Michigan and entered The University
of Michigan in 1963 with Aerospace Engineering in mind. To obtain a broader background, he
switched his major to Engineering Math, has compiled a "B+" average, and will graduate next De-
cember.
Dave's immediate plans, after graduation, are part-time graduate work in a California University
while working for a yet to be chosen Aerospace firm.

THE THEORY AND PRACTICE
OF STUDENT POWER"
by Donald Kosy
Six undergraduates in the College of Engineering of the University of Michigan were awarded *1,400
in prize money for essays submitted in the College's annual Cooley Essay Contest.
The contest is supported by a provision of the will of the late Mortimer E. Cooley, dean of the College
of Engineering, who created the contest as a means of encouraging engineering students to explore
topics in the humanities and social sciences as a means of broadening their education.
Winner in the upperclass contest, Donald W. Kosy of Grosse Pointe Woods, received a first prize of
$500 for his essay on the topic of student power. His essay was entitled "The Theory and Practice of
Student Power."
The topic of the freshman contest was "Meaning out of Chaos: the Function of Literature." First prize
winner Andrew Peck of State College, Pennsylvania, won S275 for his essay on the short stories of
John Steinbeck.
The judges of the essays were four members of the Department of English of the College of Engineer-
ing: Professors Chester Leach, Robert Martin, Arthur Forbes, and Robert Weeks.
The opinions expressed in these essays are not necessarily those of the Michigan Technic.
'We need not suppose thatwhenpowerresidesin an exclusive danger of being overlooked; and, when looked at, is seen
class, that class will knowingly and deliberately sacrifice the with very different eyes from those of the person whom it
other classes to themselves; it suffices that, in the absence of directly concerns."
its natural defenders, the interest of the excluded is always in - John Stuart Mill
In history, as in the present day, students have never been
a very quiet bunch. In the middle ages, for example, the
students not only loudly declaimed their opinions but were
frequently much more violent. Says one preacher of that time:
They are so litigious and quarrelsome that there Is no peace with
them; wherever they go, be it Paris or Orleans, they disturb the
country, their associates, even the whole university . . . They quar-
rel among themselves over dogs, women, or what-not, slashing off
one another's fingers with their swords, or, with only knives in their
hands and nothing to protect their tonsured pates, rush into conflicts
from which armed knights would hold back. (1)
More recently, in the nineteenth century, campus politics pro-
voked a student demonstration. The firing of University of
Michigan President Henry P. Tappan incensed the students to
this action at a noisy campus rally. A little later a less serious
offense touched off the famous Star Theatre riot in Ann Arbor.
The ejection of some boisterous students from this vaudeville
theatre brought a mob of 900 to protest the action with eggs,
rotten fruit and bricks hurled from a construction project
across the street from the Star.
The present decade has seen much of what many consider
to be the same kind of student disorderliness. From marches
in the South to class boycotts in Berkeley, from pickets at
Wisconsin to sit-ins at Michigan, student unrest and revolt
looms large in the public eye. But these demonstrations are
quite unlike the rowdy hooliganism in other times. There is
an emphasis on non-violence, on the passive sit-in, on fairly
non-destructive displays of student concern and opinion. Fur-
thermore, these actions are now considered a means to an end.
not the end itself, and this is a much more important distinc-
tion than merely of form or technique. For the function of
today's demonstrations is the expression of social and political
dissatisfaction as opposed to simply being an excuse for stu-
dent rascality, and the importance of this functional difference
is that it betrays the underlying student philosophy. There
exists a new idealism among today's students, an idealism
which prescribes the form of today's protests, and in fact is
the main force behind them. There is additionally the feeling
that ideals are something more than talk or debate topics,
that these ideals should be the framework for all levels of
governmental structure, particularly university governments,
and that the construction and implementation of this structure
should be done right away. This is the end to which students
are agitating and there has been coined the catch phrase "stu-
dent power" to cover both the end and the agitation. But since
idealism is its foundation, any discussion of the nature of
student power must first develop the philosophy and ideas
forming this foundation before the methods and goals of its
advocates can be understood and evaluated.
The fundamental philosophical basis for student power rests
on a belief in participatory democracy. Somewhere along the
line students began to take seriously the standard American
platitudes about democracy which have been woven into uni-
versity governments. As a graduate student at the University
of Michigan put it:
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


of principle that motivates many of the activist students . . . Thdr
rallying cry is not free speech but rather participatory democracy.
Disillusioned by the rise of unresponsive bureaucracy in every
segment of American life, horrified by the effects of impersonal and
remote decision-making on the human spirit, these students have
learned in the South and In the slums that exploitation and aliena-
tion can be ended only when people have the right to participate In
decisions effecting their own situation. (2)
There is much evidence that this principle is indeed uppermost
in the minds of students. Notice that participatory democracy
demands the involvement of all the people in a given com-
munity. Hence the tremendous concern of activists for action
involving all the students, for referenda on policy decisions,
and large mass meetings for determining courses of action.
Hence the concern for faculty support and faculty participation,
as well as student action, in affairs beyond the classroom.
This is the feeling summarized by Edward Robinson, Student
Government Council President at Michigan, just after the
Council had broken off relations with the administration as a
symbol of student discontent with their position:
[The aim must be to work with the faculty and administration]] to
develop structures which let all the members of the University co-
operate in making decisions. (3)
Further investigation reveals the basis of the editorials in
college newspapers where the question of student participation
rages are also the "tired but valid cliches of democracy:
those who are regulated should participate in making the rules that
regulate them; otherwise rules are likely to be tailored ill . . . and
their application will be disrupted by the rebellions of those who
balk at the rules as alien control. (4)
To be morally binding, government should derive from the
consent of the governed. In short, students have the demo-
cratic right to a voice in the regulation of their own affairs.
Students are still further aggravated by administrations
which espouse these same ideals but don't follow through in
practice. The Office of Student Affairs' Vice President at Mich-
igan, for example, is empowered by the Regents to establish
regulations "with a view to involving all concerned segments
of the University community, specifically . . . faculties, inter-
ested and responsible student representatives, and members of
the administration." Yet in handing down a sit-in rule, the
Vice President never even bothered to Inform the student gov-
ernment As was ordered to do this by the Regents of the
University, the Student paper commented:
Hence the Regents' actions In November exude the hypocrisy of a
group of men who have forgotten - or never believed In - what
they endorsed in October [the time of their order to the V.P^. (5)
It is ironic that in universities which explore the democratic
institutions as some of the noblest devised by man, the imple-
mentation of these institutions are forgotten.
And it is further ironic that the maintenance of good faith
and the spirit of cooperation necessary in running such a large
organization as a modern university have been in practice
ignored. For it is the mechanism of democracy, in a context
of cooperation, which could greatly aid the smoother opera-
tion of the university organization. An analogy might be
"dpful here, though it is not perfectly applicable. The delega-
tion of power to local government is based on the assumption
that there are some questions affecting a specific community
more than they affect the entire state and that the members of
this community are better prepared to debate these and formu-
late regulations concerning them. This assumption holds for
the university community as well. In maintaining a respon-
sibility to the Regents or Trustees of a university it is more
desirable practically to delegate powers over certain areas to
those most dearly affected. The goals of administration in
these areas should be the same as those upon whom the effect
is greatest. In making rules for student behavior, for example,
or in the control of certain relations with the world outside the.
university, e.g. the House Un-American Activities Committee,
students are most concerned and practicality as well as democ-
racy dictates their inclusion in decisions on these matters.
Even fiscal responsibility in certain areas may be better han-
dled by students than administrators. The University Activities
Center at Michigan, for instance, is close to the student body,
is student run, and knows what students want. Consequendy,
it spends its large budget, derived from student funds, on
speakers, projects, and other services quite direcdy appropriate
to student needs and desires. As another example, the Oberlin
Student Association has had budgetary discretion for several
years over a $65,000/year Activities Fund to finance films,
speakers, the newspaper, etc., as the student will demands,
and has had few problems.
The lack of validity of the view expressed last fall by the
Director of News and Public Affairs for a Detroit television
station, Bob McBride, that
students telling administrators how to run the University of Mich-
igan Is like the patient telling the doctor what to prescribe for his
ailment. (6)
is now clear. Though administrators may have more expertise,
i.e. more time, information, and experience, they don't have
all the answers. Since an administrator's function is the
smooth operation of the university complex, it is implicit in
the student tumult of recent months that some decisions have
been off the mark. And it is precisely those decisions most
closely dealing with student welfare on which college admin-
istrators have stubbed the most toes. For, as pointed out in
the Knauss Report prepared for the University of Michigan
(Faculty) Senate Advisory Committee on University Affairs,
administrators cannot run a university without taking the
students and other members of the university community into
account, without accepting requests for involvement:
The final decisions concerning Important University matters are
made by the Board of Regents. But the Initial or primary decision
is usually made elsewhere . . . For proper governing of the Univer-
sity community there must be joint faculty, administration, and
student participation. The student has a' special" perspective which
enables him to perform an essential service for the University. This
is particularly true at the present time in the face of rapid expansion
and growth of the University. The students, as "consumers," are
uniquely able to provide essential data for decision making by other
members of the University community. (7)
This brings us back to the basic concepts and devices of
democracy as a vehicle for the flow of information and opin-
ion necessary to most efficient and the most just university
operation.
But more important than the principles of democracy, or the
issues of the most expedient way to run a university is the
question of whether the exercise of student influenceor authority

Like the situation in nearby Newark.
With civic and business leaders, we
began buzzing with ideas. "Let's teach
higher skills to some of the unem-

fy for jobs that are going begging—and
help themselves as well."
We lent our tool-and-die shop, eve-
nings. We found volunteer instructors.
A community group screened appli-
cants. Another supplied hand tools. The
Boys Club donated classroom facilities.
Another company sent more instructors.
Some 70 trainees enrolled. Their in-
centive? Self-improvement. Results to

CONTEST FIRST PLACE ENTRY
FOR THE FRESHMAN DIVISION:
THE RED PONY
BY JOHN STEINBECK
ESSAY BY Andrew Peck
The original three "Red Pony" stories, "The Gift," "The Great
Mountains," and "The Promise," are held together by one com-
mon theme - the boy Jody's introduction to death. In "The
Gift" he first comes face to face with death in its disgusting
form, through the tortured sickness of the red pony. In
"The Great Mountains" he meets it in its peaceful form,
through the old man, Gitano. And finally in "The Promise"
he meets death as a source of new life through the violent
birth of Nelly's colt.
Steinbeck works this introduction to death inwith a more
general scheme, Jody's general education on the Tiffin ranch.
In particular, "The Gift" and "The Promise" center on his learn-
ing to handle horses. This is an informal educational process
and its independence of formal education is clear throughout
the stories. Jody often appearson hisway to and from school,
but never in the classroom, except briefly in "The Gift." When
he goes to school the narrative breaks off, and then picks up
again when he comes home.
Two characters, Jody's father, Carl, and Billy Buck, the ranch
hand, implement Jody's education on the ranch. Carl is very
concerned that Jody learn everything on the ranch through
experience. Billy Buck speaks of him in "The Promise": "Carl
says he wants you to start right at the start. That's the only
way to learn." To make sure that Jody values everything he
learns, Carl maintains a strong discipline. Thus, he lets Jody
own a rifle when he is ten, but with the reservation that he
won't receive cartridges until he is twelve. Likewise, he gives
the red pony to Jody on the condition that Jody will train it
and care for it, gaining experience with the animal, but at the
same time learning the discipline of caring for his own
possessions. Carl could be called the reason for Jody's ex-
periences in the stories, but it was Billy Buck by whom Jody
was taught and with whom he communicated. As Steinbeck
comments "It was easier (for Jody) to talk to Billy Buck."
Billy stepped into the role of instructor in "The Gift" when
Jody received the pony. As soon as Carl had left the barn
after showing Jody the pony, "Billy became professional in
tone. 'Sure! (he's yours) That is, if you look out for him
and break him right. I'll show you how.'" From then on
Billy controlled the pony's training. He continually explained
what he knew about horses to Jody, and Jody listened care-
Ifully, "for he knew . . . that Billy Buck was a fine hand with
horses."
Jody, however, took his largest steps toward maturity in
"The Gift" on his own. For example he became more aware of
details around him. He noticed one day the movement of
the pony's muscles, and he found he could predict a horse's
emotion by the way in which it held its ears - things which
he hadn't noticed in a lifetime of being near horses, but which
were brought out now that he had one under his own care.
He also began to think about the future and to critically
examine his own performance.
As the day when he would first ride the pony drew near
he worried about the rain. He was afraid first that he might
be thrown in the mud or that the red morocco saddle might
get wet, and second that the pony might slip and fall on him
and break his leg or hip. "He had seen this happen to men
before, had seen how they writhed on the ground like squashed
bugs, and he was afraid of it."
More than the rain though, he was afraid that he might
disgrace himself publicly by not getting right back on if the
pony threw him off, or by grabbing hold of the saddle if he
felt himself slipping. Thus, Jody had learned to look ahead
not only at possible accidents but at public opinion regarding
his actions. 1
A more important lesson which Jody learned in "the Gift"
involved a change in attitude toward Billy Buck. Steinbeck
describes Billy as an expert ranch hand - he nearly always
won the contests at the stock trails. He was sensitive to
Jody's opinion of him and to Jody's own thoughts -- he
understood Jody's desire to name the pony after the Gabilan
Mountains.
But one is also aware that Billy is only a ranch hand.
Though he ate with the Tiflins he always waited outside until
one of the family was seated. Even in the first paragraph of
"The Gift" where Steinbeck describes Billy leaving the bunk-
house, he blew his nose with his fingers. Also the worn
places on his belt showed how he had grown stouter over
the years. He was, after all, subject to aging and physical
decline.
Jody, however, looked up to him as being the expert at all
manual things on the ranch, and expected him to be perfect
and infallible. The turning point in this attitude came when
Billy assured Jody that it would be safe to leave the pony
outside the barn during the day. When the rain came un-
expectedly and soaked the pony it shook Jody's confidence
APRIL 1967

confidence laid upon him. He made the logical excuse that
it was difficult to tell what the weather would do at that time
of year, but he felt "his excuse was lame. He had no right to
be fallible, and he knew it." When the pony became sick des-
pite his efforts he again reassured J ody. But finally he realized,
when he had to open the lump in the pony's throat, that Jody
wouldn't believe any more careless reassurances and he forced
himself to admit " 'Yes, he's pretty sick . . . '" It would not
be right to say Jody was disillusioned by Billy's failure when
the pony finally did die. His faith in Billy didn't amount
to something that strong. But he did learn a valuable lesson
-- that there is not a perfection in man which he could rely on.
The final climatic experience for Jody in "The Gift," and
the most important in relation to the theme of the three stories,
is the death of the pony. Though he had realized earlier,
when he saw the "dead hair," that the pony would die, the
actual event was his first physical confrontation with death.
With his feelings perhaps heightened by the fact that, ironically,
he was the one that fell asleep and allowed the pony to escape,
he became enraged. He leaped into the circle of buzzards and
beat one of them with a piece of quartz, but was unable to
alter the impersonal, unafraid, detached look in the red eyes.
When his father and Billy arrived, Carl told Jody that " 'the
buzzard din't kill the pony.'" But Billy whirled on him angrily
and said " 'Jesus Christ! man, can't you see how he'd feel
about it?'" For, to Jody the buzzards, "the black brotherhood,"
and the staring red eyes were an embodiment of death.
The second story "The Great Mountains" jumps forward to
the "humming heat" of midsummer. It is a listless, boring
season for Jody and it signals a temporary suspension of
time -• the entire story takes place in a twenty-four hour
period. As a result Steinbeck doesn't use a series of learning
experiences for Jody, as in the training of the red pony, to
develop the story. Rather, he builds it around a contrast
between Jody's reactions and his father's reactions to Gitano,
the old paisano who had returned to the ranch to die.
Jody was fascinated by the old man, but his father, who
had to think of the ranch, said that Gitano must leave. Stein-
beck developes the contrast by suggesting a parallel between
Jody's actions at the start of the story and Carl's later on.
When Jody's mother scolded him for hurting Doubletree Mutt
he felt badly and killed a thrush. This made him feel a
"little mean pain in his stomach" and he reacted by continuing
to cut the bird to pieces and then throwing the pieces in the
bushes. He didn't care about the bird's life but he knew what
older people would think; "he was ashamed because of their
potential opinion."
His father reacted to Gitano in the same way. He told the
paisano he would have to move on in the morning, and then,
later, cruelly suggested a parallel between Gitano and the
aging horse Easter. "He hated his brutality toward old Gitano,
and so he became brutal again."
Jody, however, was attracted to Gitano, first by a youthful
curiosity and a possible answer to his questions concerning
the great mountains, but also by something deeper. As he
listened to his father explaining why the old man couldn't
stay "he seemed to hear Gitano's gende voice and its un-
answerable, 'But I was born here.' Gitano was mysterious
like the mountains." Jody felt the same emotion when he saw
the rapier. It was something mysterious and out of the past
and contained "some fragile structure of truth" which would
be destroyed if he told anyone else. When Gitano headed
toward the mountains to die and left only an empty shell
of old clothes behind, Jody sensed a loss and felt a "sharp
loneliness."
Here Steinbeck maintains emphasis on Jody's emotions by
again contrasting his reactions with his father's. When Jess
Taylor came to tell Jody's father that he had seen Easter
and to ask whether he wanted to pursue the animal, Carl
only perceived, or seemed to only perceive, in the event, the
stealing of an old horse. "Hell no" he answered, "just save
my burying that horse." Jody, however, wandered off by
himself. "Longing caressed him, and it was so sharp that he
wanted to cry to get it out of his breast."
Carl's contrasting reaction here, and at the end of "The
Gift," was not due to callousness, but is explained more by his
love for things vital and living and his dislike for weakness
and helplessness in man and animal. In "The Gift" he scolded
Jody for worrying about the pony when it got wet. "'A horse,
he said, isn't any lapdog kind of thing." At the dinner table,
to make sure that everyone understook his point, he "grumbled
about weakness put into animals and men by too much
coddling." He was a man who kept up a hard, practical
front, but who occasionally revealed a gender side. In "The
Great Mountains," he checked himself by saying "but he ought
to be shot now" when he found himself becoming sentimental
about the old horse, Easter. And Jody noted in "The Gift"
that his father "for some reason" was proud to have the wild
quail come to eat with the chickens, and in "The Great Moun-
tains," that he liked the thought of the vast unknown regions
in the mountains.
It is significant that the great mountains, don't even have a
proper name. Unlike the eastern Gabilans, which, with their
hill ranches and pine trees, Jody associated with life, the
great mountains, as he found when he questioned his elders,
were something that no one else cared to ponder. After Gitano
left, however, he linked them with Gitano's purpose of "returning
to die." "He thought of the rapier and Gitano. And he thought
of the great mountains." After gazing at them, he lay down
. . . and he was full of a nameless sorrow." Nameless, like
the great mountains, because he couldn't grasp its meaning.
In the final story, "The Promise," Steinbeck returns to the
general theme of the first story in which Jody was to learn
by doing. That is, he was again in a situation, caring for
Nelly, in which his father and Billy hoped he would learn
by experience. There is evidence that Jody had matured,
however, because he was now required to work for something,
the colt, which was not yet his, instead of first receiving the
gift.
The promise' of the colt immediately seemed to lift Jody a
step further toward maturity. Steinbeck opens the story with
a description of Jody playing at hunting and at leading an
army. But as soon as Jody heard of the colt he became
much more serious. As he left Carl and Billy "his shoulders
swayed a little with maturity." By the time he had finished
his chores he had forgotten his afternoon games so completely
that the sight of a fat warty toad under a watering trough
failed to arouse him. He even walked beside Billy, helping
him carry a milk pail, instead of trailing behind as he had been
accustomed in "The Gift."
This last incident perhaps reveals a little of Jody's changed
attitude toward Billy. Billy again became Jody's instructor
in the care of Nelly, the mare, but Jody no longer relied on
him as infallible. When Billy explained how a colt some-
times had to be killed if it was in the wrong position at birth,
Jody became alarmed and pleaded ". . .you won't let anything
happen to the colt, will you?1 Remembering his mistakes with
the red pony, Billy could only reply that he would do every
tiling he could, but that he wouldn't promise anything. 'He
22

Later, however, while talking to Jody he became proud and
promised: "I'll see you get a good colt. I'll start you right."
This gives a dual meaning to the tide "The Promise." It can
either mean the original promise that Jody will receive a colt
or it can refer to this boast. For out of his boast grew a
conflict in Billy which brought the climax of the story. For,
once he had promised a good colt, and then repromised it
on the night of its birth, he was committed. When the birth
was wrong, instead of killing the colt to save Nelly, he had to
kill the mare with a hammer and rip the colt from her belly.
Billy's action was Jody's last lesson in death. It revealed
death as intertwined with birth and new life.
The conjuction of life and death is recurrent in the three
stories. The spring to which he constantly returned, was a
source of life to Jody with its patch of perpetually green
grass. It contrasted with the black cypress tree where pig
slaughtering took place. In "The Great Mountains" Jody
shuddered at the difference between the Gabilans and the great
mountains. During the pony's death he noticed that the stubble
of the old grass was disappearing into the crop of new. At
the beginning of "The Gift" Jody saw some buzzards flying
overhead. He hated them but realized even then that they
couldn't be harmed because they did away with carrion. At
the end of the story the buzzards reappeared and simultaneous-
ly drew life from the death of the pony and became the symbol
of death which Jody attacked.
If one seeks a final theme for the three stories, it would have
to be this one oflife from death. It appears for the reader as
the culmination of a three stage acquaintance through which
Jody passed.
A first meeting with death is likely to be an ugly emotional
encounter. And Steinbeck makes "The Gift" as ugly a first
encounter as possible for Jody. The Pony's illness was tragic
for Jody and the actual death was an unpleasant, foul affair.
The pony struggled away and died in the open. When Jody
grabbed the buzzard it vomited on him and then he beat it
frantically, first smashing its bill, and finally killing it. Fear
and anger dominated any rational thought in the boy and this
prompted him to attack the buzzards, the closest thing to a
tangible form of death that he had.
In his second meeting with death, however, Jody was able
to think more clearly. There was nothing unpleasant for Jody
about Gitano or his death as there had been with the red
pony. Gitano was not ugly with age. His "body was as
straight as that of a young man." He was not even senile in
manner. Nor was Jody attached to him through any family
ties which would cause remorse at his death. The peaceful
atmosphere of the occurence -- Gitano's death doesn't even
occur in the story but can only be supposed when he is re-
ported riding toward the mountains - and the mystery which
enshrouded Gitano, his past, the rapier, and the great moun-
tains, all invited thought by Jody. But he was denied any
clues to understanding.
The final story provides the clue -- the impersonal law of
nature. One thing must die that another may live. If Nelly
hadn't died, the colt would have. This is the essence of death
in nature. From Nelly's violent mating, through her long,
slow pregnancy, to the colt's violent birth, Jody witnessed
the will of nature; this final act so stunned him that he could
not even be glad about the new colt, but could only see the
bloody face, the haunted, tired eyes of Billy Buck hanging
m the air before him.

The Asphalt Institute Suggests
Projects in 5 Vital Areas
Phenomenal advances in roadbuilding techniques during
the past decade have made it clear that continued highway
research is a must.
Here are five important areas of highway design and con-
struction that America's roadbuilders need to know more
about:
1. Rational Pavement Thickness
Design and Materials Evaluation.
Research is required in areas of asphalt rheology, behavior
mechanisms of individual and combined layers of the pave-
ment structure, stage construction and pavement strength-
ening by Asphalt overlays.
Traffic evaluation, essential for thickness design, requires
improved proceduresforpredictingfutureamountsand loads.
2. Materials Specifications and Construction Quality-Control.
Needed are more scientific methods of writing specifications,
particularly rejection and acceptance criteria. Also needed
are speedier methods for quality-control tests at construc-
tion sites.
3. Drainage of Pavement Structures.
More should be known about need for subsurface drainage
of full-depth Asphalt pavements which rest directly on the
subgrade. . _ . . -
4. Compaction of Pavements,
Conventional Lifts and Thicker Lifts.
The recent use of much thicker lifts in asphalt pavement
construction suggests the need for new studies to develop
and refine techniques of measuring compaction.
5. Conservation and Beneficiation of Aggregates.
More study is needed on beneficiation of lower-quality base-
course aggregates by mixing them with Asphalt.

A strong, lightweight arch that may prove a boon to the construction industry has
been developed at the laboratories of Olin Mathieson Chemical Corporation.
Made of rigid urethane foam sheathed in light gauge aluminum, the thin arch with
a span of 22 feet sagged only three inches when the combined weight of two men
totaling 354 pounds was suspended from the center.
The entire weight of the arch is 250 pounds. It is three feet wide and has a peak
height of 8-1/2 feet. The aluminum faces are 32 one-thousandths of an inch thick,
and the rigid urethane was foamed in place.
The strength and stiffness of the arch are due to the rigidity of the corners at the
juncture of roof and wall sections. Tensile and compressive stresses induced by a
downward load on the roof are uniformly distributed over the faces by the thickening

enhances or inhibits the educational process. For what is the
basic purpose of a university but to educate the student As
stated in the Michigan LS &amp; A catalogue:
As Its primary goal, the College aims at expanding the intellectual
frontiers of each student by providing him with knowledge, not in
the narrow sense of facts alone, but in the broadest sense of new
awareness about man and his surroundings. In addition, the Col-
lege strives to give a student the ability to compare, contrast, analyze,
classify, discriminate, criticize, evaluate, and choose intelligently from
among the myriad experiences and ideas which confront him. In
short, the College hopes to stimulate a student to explore the unknown
as a means to understanding himself and his place in the universe. (8)
But of course, education is not all books and recitations.
'Exploring the unknown as a means to understanding" of
self and the world is not confined to the classroom. As one
student philosophizes:
Education . . . should Involve an intense personal exploration of
goals, values and directions. It is a living process, requiring a di-
rect relationship between classroom material and everyday activity.(9)
Education then, is not confined to the ivory tower of the schol-
ar. The university is for both intellectual stimulation and for
the further development of the character and abilities necessary
to become a contributing member of society. Experience in
social sensitivity relation to groups, the development of re-
sponsibility appropriate to a democratic adult society, and the
development of a personal and social consciousness are all a
part of the purpose of a university. As emphasized in the
Knauss Report the psychology of in loco parentis, the view
that ordering students about is beneficial to the whole aca-
demic procedure, is now in disrepute:
The University should not have an attitude of making reluctant
concessions to student demand, but must recognize that active student
participation Is a valuable part of education . . . The University
community is pervasive In the life of the student ... As part of the
educational process the student should be allowed to take his place
as a full participating member of the University community, and be
expected to participate fully in decisions affecting his welfare. He
should be concerned with, and directly Involved In, the total life of
the community. He should help formulate and enforce the rules he
is expected to observe, and have the opportunity to influence all
phases of the University's life. (10)
A university cannot then encourage critical thought and dis-
courage critical action and still serve its purpose.
At present, however, many university administrators and
trustees are just realizing the above principles and more often
believe that students are just proving they have become polish-
ed at the techniques of protest. Moreover, an established order
is a comfortable thing compared to the unknown problems
and possible consequences of powerful student influence in
university government. But the size of the recent student dem-
onstrations, up to 10,000 strong, should give us the clue that
there is more to it than just noise. There is certainly some-
thing wrong when a substantial fraction of the population
governed violate university regulations, the civil law and some-
times endanger their careers in order to dramatize their dis-
satisfaction.
According to Eric Hoffer, in his book on the nature of mass
movements, The True Believer,
this is nearly always the first step in seriously changing the condi-
tions of a society. (11)
This first phase is always most severely criticized as being too
extreme in scope, ill-planned, and too radical to do any good.
Paul Danish in Moderator, a national student magazine,
points this up:
But Isn't it rather callous - perhaps even irresponsible - to paralyze
a great university In order to make a political point? Isn't there a
better way the same result could be achieved? The answer is simply
no. (12)
Student governments have tried for years to increase their
authority. Prior to the much celebrated Free Speech Move-
ment at Berkeley, for example, students petitioned the duly
constituted authorities for redress of grievances for ten years.
They were conslstendy ignored. (13) When the Student Gov-
ernment Council (SGC) at Michigan broke its ties with the
administrators of the Office of Student Affairs (OSA) its mem-
bers were
forced to conclude . . . that the intent of the relationship between the
OSA and SCC to provide for communication between students and
other responsible elements of the University community has in fact
broken down. (14)
So, according to the president of the SGC at Michigan, it was
necessary to "break out" of the artificial barriers imposed on
student influence and authority by the old structure and derive
their power from the student body itself.
And deriving their power from the constituency instead of
from administrative fiat is the key to the beginning of the im-
plementation of student ideals. As many, including Robert J.
Harris a professor of law at Michigan, werequick to point out,
this was the first time the student government had any real
power at all. (15) It is this kind of popular support, in fact
that is the backbone of the phrase" student power." At the on-
set of movements on campus this power is simply the power to
embarrass, the power to make waves in a society sensitive to
disturbance. It is not very elegant, nor does it involve an
elaborate plan for the future. But the spector of such protests
has forced officials to take seriously the respectable representa-
tives of the student community who do have plans. Moreover,
this is only a transitory phase. It is useful only in that it
promotes dialogue and thought where there was none before.
Beyond that it is meaningless and destructive. And finally, the
primary importance of demonstration is in establishing a
plateau from which orderly organized political power can grow,
power based on the democratic principles necessary and legiti-
mate to the government of large universities. Notice that the
demonstrations are not Just rowdy roistering, but sincere at-
tempts by students to remake their world into a closer approx-
imation to their ideals. The mass meetings for participatory
democracy, the numerous editorials on the formulation of prac-
tical programs in the student press, and the sit-ins for cutting
through the red tape and sometimes hollow words of admin-
istrations, so characteristic of all the movements, are all ex-
amples of the start of the attempts at implementation springing
direcdy from the philosophy. James Reston, commentator for
the New York Times, said recendy:
Students are always protesting about policies after, rather than be-
fore, the policies are set, which Is like courting the girl after she has
married the other guy. (16)
This first phase, the active demonstration, is the students' at-
tempt to change their position in thechainof decision, to estab-
lish new procedures of communication, to establish new chan-
nels of influence so that it won't be necessary in the future to
APRIL 1967
27


of their affairs.
The second phase is, of course, the down to earth, practical
implementation of the philosophy, and there is no dearth of
suggestions as to how this should be done. Paul Goodman,
social critic and defender of student rights, believes that stu-
dents are in no position to effectively engage in important
decisions within the present structure and can see no way to
reconcile student political power with the power of the authori-
ties in control of the university. Instead he recommends the
development of parallel to the established college institutions:
The operative Idea in participatory democracy is decentralizing, to
multiply the number who are responsible, initiate and decide. In
principle there are two opposite ways of decentralizing either by
dividing over-centralized Institutions ... or by creating new small
enterprises to fill the needs big organizations neglect or only pretend
to fulfill ... the first ... Is not in the power of the young . . . The
other way of decentralizing, by creating parallel enterprises, better
suits the students zeal for direct action, and they have applied It
with energy and inventiveness. (17)
An example of such an institution Is the" experimental college"
in San Francisco which hires its own professors, designs the
curriculum around current student interests, and engages in a
much greater role in social action, particularly in the poverty
program, than more formal institutions. This"college" is run
entirely by students and enrolls 1600. The Knauss Report
previously cited advocates a rather more modest program of
reform and redistribution of power and influence among the
faculty students, and administrators but still making clear that
there are certain areas, e.g. rules for student conduct, in which
students should have primary authority. And beyond the
large scale programs there are many, many important areas
for student involvement including more curriculum Control,
judicial boards, etc. Harvard and Columbia have Independent
off campus newspapers under the control of students alone and
these are running well without faculty or administrative aid.
This list could go on but some have proposed that it is now
the time to draw up new "constitutions" for our universities,
working out and formalizing the areas where various groups
have sole or shared rule-making power. (18) But there are
two reasons for avoiding this. First, it is unreasonable at
this time to talk of, a priori, delineating the extent and quality
of student involvement and influence. This formalization and
lack of flexibility are what have caused the current campus
ferment and it should be avoided in the future. Explained one
administrator on a campus known for its good administrator-
student relation:
Last year one of the local campus parties wanted the administration
to define the area of student responsibility ... I begged them not
to ask for this and not to make us do it. That would limit student
government not strengthen it. We make no attempt to delimit the
reach of student influence. (19)
And second, while it is known that there are many problems
associated with university democracy, the extent to which these
limit the effectiveness or practicability of student action cannot
be accurately forseen.
This difficulties with participation democracy in the university
community are first the difficulties of all direct democracies.
There is seldom enough time, money, or labor to run all the
referenda necessary to determine the will of the people on all
things. Large "town meetings" of several thousand students
are inefficient, organizationally "messy," only barely adequate
in promoting a flow of information among the population,
and impossible to use as a legislative body. A mass cannot
govern, (20) as Walter Llppmann said, simply because the
flow of information necessary to keep them entirely informed
on all matters affecting them staggers the imagination, and
besides cannot possibly be digested along with the regular
responsibilities of the average citizen. The people can approve
or disapprove the government, elect it or remove it, but they
cannot themselves administer it. (21) Hence, the need for a
representative democracy.
Representative democracy by necessity puts the power of the
people into the hands of qualified leaders, if such are available.
These leaders must now be kept as informed as possible on
the questions upon which they decide. Information must be
available to them and they must have the time to determine
its significance. Because the decisions are now more remote,
apathy and disinterest are also disadvantages of representative
democracy. Although in some organizations political apathy
is a sign that things are running smoothly, involvement of the
student in deciding his affairs is crucial to his full and com-
plete education.
A lack of time for such involvement, though, is the problem
besetting student democracies, and the extent of involvement
before the burden of other responsibilities becomes too great
is unknown. The student is only a transitory visitor at the
university, with hardly enough chance for experience to develop
expertise at administration even if he worked at it full time.
And college administration is a fulltime job.
Another equally Important problem of student democracy
is the traditional question of how much freedom and how much
responsibility should the student ideally handle. Those are
also unknown quantities although there has been much more
argument over this than the question of the amount of time
available. There is the argument from democratic philosophy
that those more involved will have a greater desire to make
the right decisions. This is the contention that although stu-
dents are not risking their jobs, their decisions affect their lives
and therefore are not ill-considered. An example of the worth-
iness of this idea is the continuing success of the Greek system,
since the responsibility for all the details of living are generally
completely handled by undergraduates. Or there is the argu-
ment that those charged with responsibility become responsible.
The Knauss Report testifies to the justification of this idea:
In instances where responsibility lies clearly delineated, and the com-
mittee or board functions on a regular basis, student Influence can
be both substantial and effective ... It was found that often stu-
dents' views are of a major, if not the primary influence In policy
decisions of these boards. (22)
The effectiveness of student participation is less, however, where
the function of the group is not clear and where the group
operates only informally.
Counter to these runs the concern that the freer the organi-
zation is run, the freer it will operate. Before being given
responsibility, the students must show themselves responsible.
Not only is this position supported by the surrounding non-
academic community, as shown by the overwhelming defeat
of the 18-year old voting age proposal, but is historically
ensconsed in the established order. But since, as we have seen,
there are not only philosophical and ideological, but pragmatic
bases for the use and extension of student participation, there
is but to demonstrate the feasibility and practical desirability
of student power to administration and ultimate authority, the
public, to gain its acceptance. And to escape the viscious
circle of deciding whether the demonstration of student respon-
sibility comes before the granting of power or vice versa, as
well as practically reaching toward solution of problems and

dent power, their only solution is experiment.
The main trouble with the current concept of student power
is that its proponents fail to define it first and then try it out.
They want to delimit it right from the beginning, and there
fall into a fundamental trap. In politics one can never be
wrong, but in an experiment one is always right. In politics
once you've made the decision and built a structure you're
stuck with it, and the facility for amendment is usually tedious.
Moreover, the attitude prevails that an administrator must
"stick to his guns" and never made a wrong move. Comments
B. F. Skinner in his discussion of Utopia:
Politics really wouldn't give us the chance we want . . . You can't
try something first one way then another, like an experiment. The
politicians guess at all the answers and spend their time persuading
people they're right -- but they must know they're only guessing. (23)
In an experiment, however, there is no stigma of failure since
"failure" is just the indication that another hypothesis should
be tried. Though these experiments may be long, though the
need for flexibility in formulation of these social experiments
may be hard, it is the only way to assess the true value and
limitation of student power.
The "free universities" around the country are examples of
such experiments. As has been noted, the "experimental col-
lege" in San Francisco is doing very well and has met with
more interest than we are able to handle(24) according to one
of its coordinators. At other places, for example Ann Arbor,
the free university involvement is pretty much dead (25) due
to lack of organization, funds and student Interest. But this is
not to say it was not a worthy experiment, and not to imply
that it was a waste of time. The information is valuable
and has been added to the supply an implementation of stu-
dent participation. And there is no reason to believe that
experiments of this kind could not be done within an organized
university as well. It is difficult to imagine, in fact, a more
appropriate place for such social research.
Despite the problem of determining its limits, and despite the
headaches in implementing it, the discussion of the philosophy
of student power has shown the desirability of at least giving
it a try. Democratic philosophy justifies it, the value of student
information feedback in the decision-making system warrants
it, and the goals of the university educational process demands
it. Even administrators acknowledge the potency of student
power: Harlan Hatcher, President of the University of Michi-
gan has said:
The students have proven their value in such matters (policy mak-
ing). I really am impressed by them. I think if you give them two
or three years they could be in a position to run the university in
administrative positions. (26)
As to the limits on student involvement, that is an empirical
question dependent on the time necessary, the ability of stu-
dents to handle the increased responsibility and probably
many other factors. Society has often been astounded by the
prodigious intellectual achievements of today's youth, for ex-
ample the movement of college level work into the high schools.
That they may accomplish similarly spectacular feats of ad-
ministration and organization of their own affairs remains to
be seen. The best justification of student power is ultimately
the practical result, and hence it is this limit, rather than the
arbitrary ones of philosophy, authority, or legality, which
should be explored.

Electronic circuitry is in the early stages of an advance
as dramatic as the era of the transistor (left, inset).
Semiconductor integrated circuits (center, inset) already
have drastically reduced the size of computers, because
each IC contains the equivalent of dozens of transistors
and other discrete components. Printed circuit boards
connecting dozens of IC's provide electronic functions for
many industrial and military applications. Now, with
large scale integration (right, inset), more than a
thousand component equivalents can be packed into a
single tiny unit less than two inches square. Ultimately,
this component density may be increased 10-fold
and more. This is only one example of the kind of
technology that makes working at Texas Instruments
interesting and rewarding. You may also be interested in
other TI technologies, a few of which are illustrated
here. All have as a common bond a high level of
innovation ... by creative people working in a creative
environment. TI's growth and diversity offer exceptional
opportunities for outstanding college graduates at all
degree levels and in many disciplines. For a free brochure

American A irlines operator Kathy Sutler points to a specially
designed Weston 1201 Edgewise Meter which instantly tells
her the location of customer calls.
Model 1201, shown here in its standard configuration,
provides true fiat scale display at 1% accuracy without
parallax. Self-shielding CORMAG' mechanism mounts ver-
tically or horizontally.
Dial an American Airlines office in Omaha, St.
Louis or Minneapolis and Kathy Sittler is likely to
answer your call in Chicago. Her telephone, like 50
others at American's computerized reservations
center, is linked to nine midwestern cities.
Kathy knows which is your city because a pro-
jected moving pointer on the special Weston 1101
meter at her right points to it—for the duration of
your call. The result ? Faster, more efficient service.
Similar Weston meters give fast, clear information
to power plant operators, cyclotron technicians,
wind tunnel crews, high-speed transit engineers,
and hospital anesthesiologists. Parallax-free read-
out, compact design, and state-of-the-art perform-
ance are just three of the reasons these instru-
ments serve so many industries... with precision.

to the cold,
cruel world.
Of course, if your father's a millionaire, or you're about to marry an heiress,
then you have no problems. But, if not, then there's only one sensible thing to
do. Come to work at Allison Division of General Motors.
There's nothing cold or cruel here. Just the opposite. Particularly if you're an
engineer with big ideas. Aerospace projects? Allison's got them. Turbofan.
Turbojet. Turboprop. Turboshaft. Military and commercial applications right
across the board.
Maybe you're more down-to-earth. Fine. Some of Allison's advanced motor ve-
hicle projects will be more your cup of tea. Like the new M551 General Sheridan,
for instance. The powershift transmission, of course, is our specialty, and even
the gun launcher is an Allison brainchild.
There's more. And you can be part of it. Take your time. Check them all. But
don't forget Allison. Remember: life can be beautiful . . . even
without an heiress.

obscure corner of industry after
you leave college. A forgotten man.
You want activity. You want to
get in there and show your stuff.
All right. How do you propose to

If you join the United States Air
Force you'll become an expert fast.
The Air Force is like that. They
hand you a lot of responsibility fast.
Through Officer Training School
you get a chance to specialize
where you want... in the forefront
of modern science and technology.
Suppose, for example, you
wanted to become a pilot and serve
as aircraft commander on airplane
crews. You'd plan missions and
insure that the aircraft is pre-flight-
ed, inspected, loaded and equip-
ped for the assigned mission. You'll
be trained to fly exciting aircraft.
Just examples. There are so
many more.
Wouldn't it be pretty nice to en-
