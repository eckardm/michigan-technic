HOFFMAN PROCESS
BEFORE THE
FIRST OPERATION
Correct manufacturing methods and complete
equipment only partially constitute the re-
quisites for the manufacture of high quality
balls.
Before a lot of steel is fabricated into Hoover
Steel Balls it must first measure up to definite
quality standards.
In no other ball manufacturing plant are to
be found such complete laboratories as form
an integral part of the great Hoover plant.
Their functions are widely diversified and of
the greatest importance, for no ball possibly
can exceed the quality of the very steel that
enters :nto it.
All Hoover Steel Balls are made from the
same quality of special chrome-alloy. There
is but one standard, so thoroughly fixed that
the rigid tests of the Hoover laboratories
positively establish the fitness of the steel
before manufacture is begun.
Science underlies the making of Hoover Steel
Balls from the moment the raw steel is re-
ceived until the finished balls are shipped.
Hoover Steel Balls have won world-wide
recognition for their superior qualities of ac-
curacy, finish and resistance to wear and i
shook*.
Obviously, the complete Hoover Laboratories,
by rigid tests and inspections, guarantee the
maintenance of the high quality of Hoover
balli.
[SltiM,
Rigid examination and supervi-
sion of the materials which enter

HOFFMAN
PROCESS
The Hoover Steel Ball Company is one of
only three ball manufactories in the world
with rights to use the Hoffman Process. It
is universally recognized as the most ad-
vanced method for the uniform production of
highest finished steel balls. It replaces hu-
man inaccuracy with automatic precision to
.0001 inch.'
The ability of this company to meet all ship-
ping specifications is one other reason for
the general adoption of Hoover Steel Balls.

PARTS I AND II
Editor's Note.—It is through the cour-
tesy of the Encyclopedia Americana (Al-
bany, N. Y.) that zve arc able to present
this article to our readers, and we wish to
acknowledge our indebtedness to them at
this time.
These articles do not belong to the scries
"Critical Review of the Different Phases
of the Evolution and the History of the
Internal Combustion Engine" also by Prof.
Greincr. Part B (Gas Turbines) of this
series appeared in our Dec. 1918 issue, and
we hope to publish Part C (Oil Engines)
in October, 1919.
Parts I and II of the present series are
published herewith. Parts III and IV will
appear in the May, 1919 Technic.
It is the purpose of this series of
articles to cover the subject of in-
ternal combusion engines thoroughly,
but without going deeply into theory.
In discussing such a general topic it
is necessary to attack it from definite
points, and the logical place to start
is with
I. DEFINITIONS
An energy transformer, which con-
verts chemical energy stored up in
solid, liquid, or gaseous combustible
matter into heat and then into mech-
anical work, is called a heat engine.
The heat is produced by the combus-
tion of the fuel in air, and if this com-
bustion takes place within the cylinder
of the engine itself, the latter is gen-
erally termed internal combustion
engine, working either on the prin-
ciple of the reciprocating engine, or
of the turbine. While the external
combustion engine, i. e., the steam
engine receives its working medium,
the steam, ready made, and depends
therefore on such auxiliaries as the
boiler and furnace; the internal com-
bustion engine has to produce its own
working medium,—hot high-tension
gases, and moreover must do this in
a fraction of a second. Hence the in-
ternal combustion engine fulfills the
functions of the steam engine and the
steam boiler with furnace combined,
and is simpler than the latter; but it
is just this simplicity which presents
much more difficult and diverse prob-
lems in the design and construction
of the internal combustion engine.
The ability of the internal combustion
engine to utilize almost any kind of
fuel and its broad field of application
to stationary and automotive power
generation have brought into use such
easily definable and special names as:
Illuminating Gas Engine, Producer
Gas Engine, Blast Furnace Gas En-
gine, Coke Oven Gas Engine, Natural
Gas Engine, Alcohol Engine, Gaso-
line Engine, Heavy Oil Engine, Auto-
mobile Engine, Truck Engine, Trac-
tor Engine, Marine Engine, Aircraft
Engine.
II. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCI-
PLES.
Whatsoever the fuel or the field of
application may be every internal
combustion engine has to "satisfy the
following main requirements:


i.—The Cyclic Functions, i. e.,
the Admission, Compression, Ingi-
tion and Combustion of the Charge
within a fixed space, called Combus-
tion Chamber, which produces Ex-
pansive Power, and finally the Ex-
haust of the Burned Gases.
intimately interwoven. Each of the
requirements can not, however, be
realized to its highest degree. For
instance, with regard to stress condi-
tions, it is very desirable to keep the
cooling medium at the lowest possible
temperature; yet the lowest fuel con-

These problems are of a chemico-
physico-mechanical nature, and are
QRAtJK
sumption is attained only at a fairly
high temperature of the cooling water.
Thus in nearly all practical cases,
there can be only an approximate
solution, which must necessarily be a
happy balance between contradicting
conditions. Furthermore, the loca-
tion of the engine as well as the kind
of service, causes still more difficul-
ties, and indeed difficulties of a special
nature. The problems of the aircraft
engine, for instance, are decidedly


different from those of the automo-
bile engine, while the latter requires
features of design which are seldom
embodied in the stationary type of
engine.
CYCLIC FUNCTIONS
In order to satisfy the above five
basic requirements, the internal com-
bustion engine has to pass through a
definite "Cycle of Operation;" that is,
its piston has to make a number of
single strokes to gain one ''Power"
or "Impulse" stroke, known as the
"Working Stroke." Today, the four-
stroke cycle and two-stroke cycle are
most commonly used, and are briefly
called four and two cycle respectively.
A. FOUR-STROKE CYCLE
In the diagrams, figures i to 4, a
four-stroke cycle single acting gas
engine is briefly illustrated.
Figure 1 represents the engine with
the piston on the suction stroke, or its
first out-stroke. During this stroke,
a charge of gas and air, previously
mixed in the mixing chamber, is taken
through the inlet valve. In Figure 2,
the piston is starting on its first in-
stroke or compression stroke. The
inlet valve is closed and the charge
compressed. At or near the end of
the stroke, ignition occurs. Figure 3
shows the piston, just after the igni-
tion occurs. Figure 3 shows the pis-
ton, just after the ignition of the
gases, at the beginning of the work-
ing stroke, which is now the second
out-stroke. Due to the combustion of
the mixture within the cylinder, both
the temperature and the pressure of
the gases increase suddenly. The
high-tension gases thus produced,
drive the piston out, and while doing
this useful work, gradually expand to
nearly atmospheric pressure. At the
end of this stroke, the exhaust valve
is opened and the inert gases are
forced out of the cylinder during the
fourth stroke, figure 4, known as the
exhaust stroke, at or near the end of
which the mixture inlet valve is open-
ed, starting the cycle over again. The
changes of pressure within the
cylinder during the different strokes
are represented in the pressure-stroke
or pressure-volume diagrams, ia, 2a,
3a, 4a; in figure 5, these pressure-
volume diagrams are developed. Dur-
ing the first, second, and fourth
strokes the engine performs the func-
tions of a pump, deriving its power
from the excess energy stored up in
the flywheel during the power stroke.
The power is automatical)' adapted
to the load demand by a governor
acting on the gas inlet throttle valve.
During the cycle, a cooling medium,
usually water, flows through the
jacket surrounding the cylinder to
carry away the heat transmitted
through the cylinder walls, thus pre-
venting overheating of the latter.
B. TWO-STROKE CYCLE
To illustrate the two-stroke cycle
principle, a two-stroke cycle single
acting oil engine has been selected.
See Figs. 6 to 10.
In figure 6, the piston is in its outer
dead center position. The ports for
both the scavenging air and the ex-
haust are uncovered by the piston,
while the air inlet valve in the crank-
case is closed. The cylinder as well
as the crankcase is filled with air at
atmospheric pressure. The piston on
its instroke, figure 7, slides over the
air inlet port, cutting off the cylinder
from the crankcase. This causes the
pressure in the latter to fall below that
of the atmosphere, thereby opening
the automatic air inlet valve and ad-
mitting fresh air to the crankcase.
Further sliding of the piston then


FIG. 3.
FIG 3a.
FIG. 4.
F~IG.4a.
F/G. S.
cuts off the exhaust port from the
cylinder, and compression starts. Be-
fore the piston reaches the inner dead
center, figure 8, the fuel is sprayed
into the combustion space, which in
this case is the hot bulb, where it is
vaporized, mixed with air, and ignited
near dead center; the first operation
in the two-stroke cycle—the compres-
sion stroke—is now completed. The
temperature and the pressure of the
gases within the cylinder increase
quickly, and the high-tension gases
expanding gradually force the piston
out, figure 9, thus doing useful work.
At a point where the piston has yet
to travel about 15 per cent of its
stroke, the exhaust port is uncovered


by it and the exhaust gases are dis-
charged. Further sliding uncovers
the inlet port, figure 10, and the air
in the crankcase being compressed
slightly above atmospheric pressure
rushes into the cylinder and sweeps
out or scavenges the inert gases. This
power is adapted to the load by the
action of the governor on the fuel
pump. To assure continuous opera-
tion some heat is transmitted through
the walls and carried away by the
cooling medium passing through the
water jacket.

completes the cycle. Figures 8a, 9a,
and 10a, illustrate again the changes
of pressure within the cylinder dur-
ing the cyclic events. One further
feature to be noted is the necessity of
a fuel pump for the two-stroke cycle
engine. During the compression
stroke, the excess of energy which
was stored up in the flywheel during
the power stroke, is consumed. The
C. FOUR-STROKE VERSUS TWO-STROKK
CYCLE
Even though the two-stroke cycle
is theoretically superior to the four-
stroke cycle, yet the latter predomin-
ates. We can very readily, by com-
parison, see why this is true. The
main advantages of the four-stroke
cycle are its simple construction, high
speed, and low cost for small engines;


its disadvantages being the varying
torsional moment, heavy flywheel,
small specific output, large dimen-
sions, and contamination of the new
charge by the burned gases. As to
the main advantages of the two-stroke
cycle, they are a specific output, which
is about 75% to 90% larger than in
the four-stroke cycle; the size of the
engine is about half of that of a four-
stroke cycle engine for the same
power output, hence it has lower
weight; good scavenging with a cor-
respondingly purer mixture and larg-
er unit charge; elimination of valves
is a doubtful question as to the super-
iority of the one over the other, the
more so as the two-stroke cycle en-
gine is not yet fully developed. Only
the future can tell which of the two
will be the final victor in the race for
supremacy in design, construction,
operation, and economy.
D. CONSTANT VOLUME AND CONSTANT
PRESSURE CYCLE

stroke cycle engines, ignition with

by using slots or ports in cylinder
walls, thus assuring a more reliable
construction; more uniform torque;
ease of reversibility; large overload
capacity; ratio of cooling surface to
displacement volume larger, hence
better cooling effect and higher com-
pression than in the four-stroke
cycle. On the other hand, we have
disadvantages which may be stated
as follows: the charge must be moved
through two cylinders, hence greater
frictional resistance and lower mech-
anical efficiency; low speed; heat
losses during the power stroke larger
than in the four-stroke cycle. Quite
recently however, the two-stroke cycle
has come into wider use, especially
for high power units operating on
crude oil as fuel. Among experts, it
cycle, may take place either at ap-
proximately constant volume with
pressure increasing rapidly as figure
11, or at approximately constant
pressure with volume increasing
gradually, figure 12. In the first
case, the engine is usually spoken of
as an "Explosion" or "Otto" engine,
while the constant pressure engine is
usually called a "Combustion" or
"Diesel" engine. The late August N.
Otto of Cologne, and the late Rudolph
Diesel of Munich, were the first suc-
cessful builders of the constant vol-
ume and constant pressure engines
respectively.
There have been many other cycles
invented and more or less success-
fully applied, (see Historical Develop-
ment), yet the fact remains that al-


most all internal combustion engines
in practical operation today are run-
ning either on the Otto cycle or on
the Diesel cycle, the former being the
older and considerably in the lead.
In comparing these two cycles as
to theoretical thermal efficiency, it is
assumed that: (i) the gas used fol-
lows the law of a perfect gas; (2) the
ratio of the specific heats "k" is con-
stant; (3) the cylinder in which the
4—1. This completes the cycle and
the heat Q = Qa — Qr has been trans-
formed into work represented by the
area 1—2—3—4—1. As the efficiency
is the ratio of the output over the in-
put, we can write the expression:
(I) 7t= Q/Qa=(Qa-Qr) /&lt;?.

tight, i. e., adiabatic heat conditions
exist; (4) the inlet and outlet valves
open and close exactly at dead center;
(5) the work consumed during the
suction and the exhaust strokes is
neglected.
•a. Otto Cycle
Referring to figure 13, we can fol-
low through the different operations
of the cycle. Suction occurs along
the line o—1; adiabatic compression
along 1—2; ignition and combustion
at constant volume and addition of
heat, Q,,, along the line 2—3, with a
resulting increase of the absolute
temperature T2 to Tz and pressure
Pt to p3; adiabatic expansion along
3—4; and exhaust along 4—1—o,
whereby heat, QT, is rejected along

thermal efficiency of the Otto cycle,
"r" being the ratio of compression,
Vt / V„. Thus the termal efficiency
of the Otto cycle increases with the
compression ratio "/', as well as with
the ratio of specific heats "k". Since
the latter is a function of the mixture
ratio of gas to air, the efficiency de-
pends also on the mixture ratio. Lean
mixtures give higher values of k and
better efficiencies than rich ones. For
instance, for VJVz=v='2 and k—\.2,
rite=s 13% while for
V1/V2 = r— 10, 7jt =60%.
b. Diesel Cycle
As in the Otto cycle, we can deter-
mine the thermal efficiency from the
theoretical card. Referring to figure
14, suction takes place along o—1;
adiabatic high compression of the air
along 1—2; spraying of fuel into the
cylinder by means of highly com-
pressed air, self ignition, and combus-
tion along 2—3, thus adding the heat,
Qa, to the cycle; adiabatic expansion
along 3—4; exhaust along 4—1—o
whereby heat QT, is rejected. The
cycle is thus completed, the heat
Q = Qa—Qr being transformed into
work represented by the area 1—2—3
—4—1. Using the same notation as

ratio of cut-off volume to compression
volume.


(10) Ti/T1=.(Vt/Vi)* = LK
Equation 6 takes the form
(6a) *=(i —I/,*-*) (i/k)
x(Z,«-i)/(Z,-i))
giving the theoretical thermal effi-
ciency of the Diesel cycle. The ther-
mal efficiency of the Diesel cycle thus
depends not only on the ratio of com-
pression r, and the ratio of specific
heats k, but also on the ratio of the
loads L. For instance, for r = 13,
k = 1.41, L = 1.5, we get rn = 61.5%
and for r = 13, k = 1.41, L = 3;
Vt = 54%- This shows that the ther-
mal efficiency of the Diesel cycle de-
creases with the increase of the ratio
of loads.
In figure 15, the efficiencies of the
Otto as well as of the Diesel cycle are
graphically represented for equal
ratios of compression, r, heats, k, and
loads, L. From these diagrams it is
evident that at equal compression
ratios, the Otto cycle is superior to
the Diesel. In practice however, the
Otto cycle is limited in regard to the
compression ratio, (r = 8), in order
to prevent pre-ignition, while the
Diesel engine must essentially use a
high compression, r being in this case
approximately 16. At a low ratio of
load, L = 1.5, the Diesel engine has
the higher efficiency. At full load
however, L being approximately 3,
the thermal efficiency of both cycles
is about the same, in which case their
maximum combustion pressures, p3,
are about the same.

A. INDICATED EFFICIENCY. INDICATED
HORSE-POWER
The thermal efficiency as computed
above can never be realized in prac-
tice since many factors upon which it
depends cannot be mathematically
considered. Thus the assumption that
compression and expansion curves
are adiabatic in character is not true.
There must be heat losses due to cool-
ing, radiation, incomplete combustion
and several other reasons. The de-
gree of variation of the specific heats
with a change in temperature or pres-
sure or both, is still an open question.
The combustion lines are never true
constant-volume or constant-pressure
lines. Figure 16 shows the theoreti-
riouiee i&amp;.
cal diagram representing the heat Q,
and the actual diagram representing
the indicated heat, Qu actually con-
verted into work. The difference of
the two areas gives the actual loss due
to the factors cited above. The ratio
Qi / Q has a value from .5 to .8 and
is sometimes called the card factor.
The theoretical efficiency, -qt, is thus
reduced to: r)t Q t / Q = ^ = the Indi-
cated Efficiency. The Indicated
Horse-power, denoted by the symbol
A"i, is the work actually developed
within the cylinder. It is in direct
proportion to the area of the pressure-
volume or indicator diagram as actu-
ally obtained by means of an indica-
tor, and can be computed by means of
the formula Nl={PlSAX)/iyxf=
indicated horse power, in which P, is
the mean indicated pressure from the
indicator diagram in pounds per
square inch, S the length of the en-
gine stroke in feet, A the net area of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the piston in square inches, X the
number of power strokes per minute,
and 33,000 the number of foot-pounds
per minute in one horse power.
B. BRAKE HORSE-POWER. MECHANICAL
EFFICIENCY
The Brake Horse-power or Effec-
tive Horse-power, denoted by the
symbol A'e, is the actual work deliver-
ed from the main shaft of the engine
to the power consumer. Are is less
than Ari to the amount of the friction
horse-power Nt lost in the engine due
to friction. It is calculated by use of
the formula Ne=(2irlnlV) /33000 =
Brake Horse-power, in which / is the
length in feet of the lever arm of the
absorption brake used in measuring
the power of the engine, n the num-
ber of revolutions per minute, and IV
the net weight in pounds on the scales
used in weighing the load on the
brake.
The Mechanical Efficiency, rjm, is
the ratio of the brake horse-power,
and is expressed as vm = Ne / N%.
Test results show an increase in 7;m
with an increase of the ratio of loads,
but a decrease of vm with an increase
of the ratio of compression if pi does
not change materially.
C. OVER-ALE EFFICIENCY
The product, i/rijm —*»*■ Over-all
Efficiency, is commonly called "Brake
Efficiency" or ''Economical Efficiency.
It furnishes the means by which the
value of any internal combustion en-
gine with regard to fuel economy,
may be measured.
This economical efficiency 77,,, varies
with the load of the engine, as shown
in Fig. 17, which is the heat-balance
diagram of a 15 HPe (effective)
Diesel Oil Engine. At normal out-
put, 15 H.P. of the engine, 30% of
the available heat is converted into
useful work, while the remainder is
lost in friction, cooling water, exhaust
gases, and radiation, as illustrated in
the heat-balance diagram. Between
half and maximum load, the economy

of the Diesel Oil Engine varies only
slightly, in which respect it is super-
ior to the Otto Engine which shows
a more rapid decrease in economy.
D. ESSENTIAL MECHANICAL ELEMENTS
The power developed within the
cylinder may be transmitted to the
rotating shaft either according to the
turbine or the reciprocating engine
principle. As, today, gas turbine
power is not in practical use for in-
ternal combustion engines, the latter
only will be considered. Fig. 18 illus-
trates the mechanical elements of a
single acting, horizontal gas engine.
In the cylinder, A, is a close-fitting
trunk piston, B, a long opened piston,
fitted with piston rings, Bx held in
position in their grooves and prevent-
ed from revolving by means of small
pins, placed at different position for
each ring, so that the joints of the
rings cannot work in line and allow
the gases to blow past them. One end


ii
of the connecting rod, C is held to
the piston by the wrist pin, Be, which
is rigidly fixed in the body of the
piston. The other end of the con-
necting rod engages the crank pin, B.
The horizontal, straight-line move-
ment of the piston is thus transform-
ed, by the pendulum motion of the
connecting rod, C, into rotary motion
of the crankshaft, F. On this crank-
shaft which is supported by the main
bearing, F2, is fixed the flywheel F,
which gives the engine a more regular

GINES
In a single-acting engine Fig. 20.
work is done at one end of the cyl-
inder only, while the other, the crank
end, is open and exposed to the sur-
rounding air, thus giving a cooling
effect. The piston usually serves as
a cross-head. In a double-acting en-
gine, Figs. 23 and 24, work is done
at both ends of the cylinder. Here a
stuffing box and a separate crosshead
are necessary, and the piston and its

upon this shaft are fixed the cams,

and the exhaust valve, Hx. The cam
shaft also operates the magneto shown
in fig. 19, which, at the proper instant,
produces a spark at the terminals of
the spark plug, Jy, in the combustion

rod must be cooled. All modern
small and medium sized engines are
of the single acting type. Only in
such cases where the highest possible
cylinder capacity is required do manu-
facturers attempt to produce the dou
ble acting engine. At the present
time, the record capacity per cylinder
of the double acting two-cycle type is
about 2000 horse-power; of the four-
cycle, about 1500 horse-power.
F. MULTI-CYLINDER ARRANGEMENTS

and branching out into the various
fields of application, the internal

enced by such factors as space, weight

liability, and flexibility, that it ap-

single acting, double stroke, two cycle
engine. Two single acting, opposed
pistons, work in one cylinder provid-
ed with inlet and outlet slots. A
transverse yoke and three connecting
rods transmit the power developed in
the cylinder to a three-throw crank
shaft, thus freeing the cylinder of all
stresses but those due to the action of
the combustion pressures. Further-
more, the engine is well balanced and
therefore well suited for marine pur-
poses.
It must be especially mentioned that
the vertical, single acting four cycle,
four and six cylinder, all in line, Figs.
26 and 27, as well as the eight cylinder,
Fig. 31, and twelve cylinder, Fig. 35,

the twin six, have become the most
popular engine types in automobile,
marine, and aircraft practice. The
reason for it is that these types give
a more equal flow of power, and
weigh less per unit power than the
one cylinder type. When the first

for four stroke cycle engines of one,

From these curves it is evident that in
early opening of the exhaust valve,
while in the six cylinder type the tor-
que curves overlap, thus causing a
continuous flow of power with no
periods of idling. This factor is a
requisite in the operation of airplanes,
and very desirable in automobiles,
since flexibility and performance of
the motor is appreciated by any
driver, especially in heavy traffic.

Then
Vw = Nt- 2545 / C»- H a)
where H is the lower heat value in
British Thermal Units of the fuel
consumed. Considering that the
actual charge volume drawn in dur-
ing one suction stroke consists of the
fuel, Cst = (C*/30-«), and a cor-
responding amount of air, Z,st =
(C» • L / 30 • »), the sum of the two,
Vst, of which, is equal to the piston
displacement, D"ir / 4 ■ S, times the
volumetric efficiency -qv, (which is the

the piston displacement volume), the
equation for the determination of the
main dimensions will then be
ir-(Tr/4)S=V'.t/vv =
(CEt + Lsi)/ -q.
From equation (a):
Ci. = A7e-2545/H-r/w
and from this we get
Z.„ = .Y„ • 2545 ■ L / (H ■ ,„ ■ 30 ■ n)

For two cycle engines, it is obvious
that the factor 54 would be used in-
stead of 108. In the above equations,
L is the air in cubic feet actually used
to burn one cubic foot of the gaseous
or one pound of the liquid, fuel, while
-V0 is the effective horse-power for
one cylinder end only. In view of the
amount of experimental data avail-
able, a selection of L, H, and iw can
easily be made. For this purpose the
tables 1 and 2 are inserted.

from .75 to .65 for high speed engines, automatically operated—inlet valve;
from .65 to .50 for extremely high speed engines, auto, and aircraft engines.
Example:—A four-cycle, single-acting, one-cylinder anthracite producer
gas engine is to develop 170 Horsepower, at a piston speed of 800 feet per

From Table Xo. 2 use v* = .26; //= 140 B.T. U.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
3. Cooling
The maximum temperature devel-
oped within the cylinder of internal
combustion engines is 2500 degrees F.
or more. It is evident that neither
cast iron and cast steel nor any other
metal known at the present time could
resist such high temperatures. Furth-
ermore, pre-ignition of the charge and
distortion of the elements exposed to
such high temperatures would occur.
To prevent this, some method of cool-
ing must be resorted to. Water is the
cooling medium most commonly used.
In small engines, however, air may
serve the purpose. Usually only such
parts that are subjected to high tem-
peratures, such as the cylinder, cyl-
inder head, and exhaust valve, are
cooled, and this is done by surround-
ing these parts with water jackets; in
engines above 120 horsepower, cool-
ing should also be provided for the
piston, the piston rod, exhaust pipes,
bearings, and crosshead guide. It is
very desirable to have the circulation
of the water such that the parts of
the engine exposed to the greatest
heat are surrounded by the coldest
water. Since the heat carried off by
the cooling medium cannot be con-
verted into useful work, it is evident
that there must be a certain loss due
to this cooling of the engine. The
amount of this loss, see fig. 17, de-
pends on many factors, such as type
and load of engine, size of cylinder,
temperature of cooling water, and so
on, and varies from 25% to 50% of
the heat developed within the cylinder.
However, there is danger from over-
cooling as well as from under-cooling.
If the engine is over-cooled, the clear-
ance between the piston and cylinder
is decreased, the lubricating oil gets
more sluggish, and there will be a
large increase in mechanical friction,
with a corresponding decrease in me-
chanical efficiency. On the other
hand, if the engine is not sufficiently
cooled, there is danger from pre-ig-
nition, excessive expansion of parts,
and at very high temperatures, actual
failing of the cylinder and piston.
Each of the cooling systems has its
advantages and disadvantages. The
main advantages of air cooling are
simplicity, light weight, no charge for
the cooling medium, and no danger of
cracking the cylinder by freezing; the
disadvantages which may be cited are
applicability to small engines only, no
positive control over the temperature,
burning of the cylinder lubricating oil,
and in most cases high fuel consump-
tion. In the standard method of water
cooling, we have such advantages as
the control of the temperature regard-
less of weather conditions, the pos-
sibility of cooling internal parts of
large engines, and the regulation of
the clearance space between the cyl-
inder and piston, which in turn means
the partial control of the piston fric-
tion and also the prevention of the
escape of gases into the engine room.
On the other hand, there are certain
disadvantages of the water cooled
engine. There is an increase in weight
which is a most undesirable feature
in engines for automatic purposes;
danger of freezing in winter; collec-
tion of mud and formation of scale
which will clog up the water passages;
and the failure of the feed pump
where forced circulation is used.
In automobiles, trucks, tractors, and
airplanes, it is necessary to reclaim
the water. In this case the water is
circulated through a so-called radia-
tor, Fig. 35. This consists either, of
a great number of round tubes with
fins to radiate the heat, or flat tubes
through which the water flows in thin
sheets. In addition, air is forced
against these tubes by the forward


19
movement of the vehicle and by a fan.
The water, forced by means of a small
pump into the jacket of the cylinder,
gradually becomes warmer while pas-
sing upwards and finally is discharged
into the top of the radiator. There it
is divided into thin streams and direct-
ed against comparatively cold metal
which abstracts heat from the water.
Gradually cooling off, it flows down
Small and medium sized stationary
engines are provided with a large
water tank, see Fig. 18; the top of
the tank is connected with the top of
the water jacket, and the bottom of
the tank with the bottom of the jacket.
In small farm engines, this tank is an
integral part of the cylinder jacket,
thus eliminating piping entirely. In
large, high powered engines, the
Figs. 35 and 36
through the radiator to the suction
pipe of the pump, illustrated in Fig.
35, which again forces it back into
the jacket. A thermostat may be ad-
ded, see Fig. 36, and the flow of the
water so regulated that the temper-
ature of the water is constant at all
speeds of the engine. Some manu-
facturers do not use a pump at all,
but resort to the natural method of
water circulation—the thermo-syphon
system—which, however, requires a
larger amount of water and space.
quantity of cooling water generally
varies from 30 to 70 pounds per
horsepower hour, depending upon the
type and fuel used. A 6000 horse-
power engine would therefore re-
quire about 420,000 pounds of water
per hour. Where such a quantity of
clean water cannot be secured at a
very low cost, the cooling water must
be reclaimed. In the simplest design,
the hot water is piped to a cooling
pond where the heat is dissipated by
radiation and evaporation. In such


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
plants where ground area is limited,
the pond is generally displaced by a
cooling tower.
For all cases cited above, the cool-
ing water must be clean, for if im-
purities settle in the water jacket, the
cooling, especially of the cylinder
walls, becomes defective, the tempera-
ture rises, and preignition, caused by
incandescent deposits of carbon with-
in the combustion chamber, is likely
to occur. Again, the film of lubri-
cating oil between the piston, piston
rings and cylinder walls is rendered
so thin that it loses its sealing power;
the exploding gases then blow past the
piston rings and the oil is burned and
charred, thus destroying its lubricat-
ing value. Heavy wear, loss of power,
and even "freezing" of the parts are
the inevitable results.
4. Governing Methods
It has already been pointed out that
the working fluid for the internal
combustion engine must be produced
in the cylinder of the engine. Ac-
cordingly, the output of the engine
depends on so many factors, besides
the heat content of the charge, that it
is next to impossible to design such a
governing system as we might find,.
for instance, in a steam engine where-
in a certain position of the governor
corresponds to a definite load of the
engine. Nevertheless, engineering
skill has managed to devise very satis-
factory methods, the best known of
which are given below.
A. HIT AND MISS GOVERNING
In the "hit and "miss" type of gov-
erning, the engine operates under a
constant quality and constant quan-
tity charge. Explosions are cut out
at irregular intervals by keeping
either the gas inlet valve closed or the
outlet valve open. Although the
method is to be noted for its economy
and simplicity, it is used only in small
and medium sized engines and in such
cases where an irregular speed of
rotation is permissable.
2. QUALITY GOVERNING
The quantity of the charge in this
method is constant, see Figs. 37 and
38, and the power stroke occurs regu-
larly; but here the impulse is dimin-
ished by lowering the quality of the
charge or the mixture ratio of fuel to
air. This is effected by:
(1) changing the lift or the timing
of the fuel valve;
(2) changing the lift or the timing
of the air valve; or
(3) drawing back into the cylinder
a portion of the exhaust gases. This
method allows a constant compression
pressure but the charge burns slowly
and imperfectly, thus decreasing the
efficiency when operating at less than
full load.
C. QUANTITY GOVERNING
In this method of governing, the
quality of the mixture or the ratio of
air to gas, is constant, see Figs. 39
and 40; the power stroke occurs reg-
ularly. The work done during the
impulse stroke is decreased by
(1) Forcing part of the charge
back into the suction pipe;
(2) Earlier cut-oft of the incoming
charge; or
(3) Throttling of the charge dur-
ing the suction stroke.
Although in this system the compres-
sion pressure, and consequently the
efficiency drop, see Fig. 40.
The mechanical efficiency increases
with the decrease of the output. In
practice, quantity governing proves to
be superior to quality governing.


21
D. COMBINATION QUALITY—QUANTITY
GOVERNING
Illustrated in Figs. 41 and 42, it is
effected by using between maximum
and say half the load, the quality, and
below half the load, the quantity
method, thus combining the good
features of these two methods.
E. AUTOMOBILE ENGINES
If running on light oil, such as
gasoline, they are generally governed
by throttling the charge, and varying
the time if ignition.
F. DIESEL ENGINES
Governing differs slightly from the
quality method above. The engine
works at all loads with full air charge
and full compression pressure, but the
amount of oil is adapted to the load
in different ways, the best known of
which is to force the surplus of oil,
drawn in during the constant suction
stroke, back through the suction valve
into the suction pipe. The suction
valve is under the control of the gov-
ernor. Pressure-volume diagrams
regulated by this method are shown
in Fig. 43.
5. Ignition Systems
The charge in the cylinder of an in-
ternal combustion engine, after being
compressed, may be ignited by, (a)
Hot tube; (b) Hot bulb; (c) High
compression; (d) Electric spark. The
ignition point should be surrounded

by a pure charge, and located in the
center of the combustion chamber
which, for best economy, should be
spherical in shape. The time of ig-
nition must be adjustable. When the
combustion chamber is annular or
pocketed, two or more ignition points
must be provided to get good com-
bustion.
In the hot tube ignition system, see
Fig. 44, a small tube of nickel, plat-

nor-TUBE. iGN/roe.
inum, or porcelain about three inches
long and about one-quarter inch bore
is fixed to the combustion chamber;
the tube is heated by an external heat
source. During the compression
stroke, the charge is forced gradually
into the tube, and as soon as it reaches
the glowing zone, ignition occurs.
Timing is effected by shifting the ex-
ternal heat well. This method is very
simple and effective, but its short life
and external flame carrier soon caus-
ed it to be displaced by fuller ignition
systems.
In the hot bulb system, see Fig. 8,
a spherical or oval shaped cast iron
bulb serving as combustion chamber
is fixed to the cylinder. It is heated
by an external flame only for starting,
and as long as the engine is cold. This
method is very successfully used in
oil engines. The fuel is sprayed into
the bulb during the suction stroke in
four stroke cycle engines, and during
the compression stroke in two stroke
cycle engines. There it is vaporized
and then ignited by the compression
temperature. In most cases timing is
controlled by spraying water, in
proper quantities, into the bulb.
In the high compression system of
ignition such as we find in the Diesel
engine, pure air is compressed to
about 500 pounds per square inch,
thus heating the air to such a degree
that any oil, if properly atomized and
sprayed into the cylinder at the right
moment, readily ignites. Timing is
effected by adjusting the spray-needle
valve. Although very efficient and re-
liable, this method has one main
drawback: for the production and
storage of the spraying air, an air-
compressor and high pressure storage
tanks with their piping are necessary.
The most convenient and reliable
ignition system for gas and gasoline
engines is that using the electric
spark.. Of this system there are two
types: the low tension or break con-
tact type, see Fig. 45, and the high
tension or jump spark system, see
Fig. 46. The former involves the mo-
tion of a rocker-shaft, n, with a con-
tact hammer h, acting on a stationary
electrode, c. The two parts coming
together are necessarily subject to
wear which thus prevents the forma-
tion or deposit of carbon on the con-
tact faces; in this way the gases have
free access to the spark at the moment
of break of contact and this system


23
rig. *5
mak&lt;2-and-0raak.
Ignition Plug
is well suited for large low speed
engines where a hot "fat" spark is
most desirable.
The jump spark igniter, Fig. 46,
called the spark plug, has no moving
parts. It consists of a shell, S, con-
taining, c, one of the electrodes,
screwed into the combustion chamber
wall, and a porcelain insulator, p, car-
rying in its center the second elec-
trode, c. The two electrodes must
have a proper gap, about 1/32", and
be soot proof. To jump this gap, the
electric current must have a high
pressure, about 10,000 volts, produced
by a secondary or induction coil, and
a breaking device in the primary coil.
Thus the jump spark has electrical
complication and mechanical sim-
plicity, while the break spark has me-
chanical complication and electrical
simplicity. They are, however, ecpial-
ly efficient in service, and may be con-
nected with any source of electric cur-
rent such as the electric cell, the mag-
neto, the dynamo, or a combination
of these.
6. Starting the Internal Combus-
tion Engine
Before the internal combustion
engine is able to furnish power, i. e.,
before the power stroke can occur,
Fig. 46
the explosible charge must first be
drawn in and compressed. During
the actual running of the engine, this
work is usually done by the energy
stored up in the flywheel; with the
engine at rest however, no energy is
available from the wheel. Hence, to
start the engine, an external power
source is necessary. Small engines
working with low compression pres-
sure may be started by hand. Noth-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ing more than a hand crank is used
for this. It is attached directly to the
crankshaft. High powered engines
and those working on high compres-
sion pressures may be started either
by compressed air or by an electric
motor. In the first case, a small air
compressor connected to the engine
furnishes compressed air to a storage
tank during the regular operation of
the engine. To start the engine, com-
pressed air is then admitted, though
a hand or mechanically operated
starting valve, into the working cylin-
der where it expands. As soon as the
engine has the proper speed and
momentum, the starting valve is cut
out and the regular inlet and outlet
valves set in operation. There must
be no fuel admitted to the cylinder
during the starting period. Electric
motor starting is extensively used in
automobiles. The electric current is
drawn from an accumulator during
the starting period. At a certain
speed of the engine the electric motor,
instead of using electric current, pro-
duces it, that is, it is converted into
a dynamo which again recharges the
accumulator.


RATUS AS EMPLOYED IN THE
CHEMICAL INDUSTRY
W. L. BADGER
I. INTRODUCTION
It is usually taken as axiomatic that the flow of heat from a wanner to
a cooler body is proportional to the difference in temperature between them.
Later we shall have occasion to question this in certain cases, but in general
it may be taken as a working basis. In pratcice, however, the temperature
of one or both the substances being considered may vary in different parts
of the apparatus, so that we must deal with a mean difference in temperature.
This is not so directly obtained as might appear.
In general we may distinguish four cases:—
Case I. The temperature of the warmer fluid (the word fluid as used
in this article specifically includes both gases and liquids) is uniform
throughout the apparatus while the temperature of the cooler fluid varies;
for instance, warming a cold liquid with steam at constant pressure.
Case II. The temperature of the cooler fluid is uniform throughout
the apparatus and that of the warmer changes; for instance, boiling a liquid
at constant pressure by means of flue gases.
Case III. Both fluids change in temperature and flow through the ap-
paratus in the same direction.
Case IV. Both fluids change in temperature and flow through the ap-
paratus in opposite directions.
These cases are illustrated in Fig. i, in which the temperature is plotted
at different points in the apparatus. The nomenclature is that of Haus-
brand,1 as will be the case throughout this series of articles.
fca = temperature of the cooler fluid on entering the apparatus.
fce = temperature of the cooler fluid leaving the apparatus.
rwa = temperature of the warmer fluid entering the apparatus.
twe = temperature of the warmer fluid leaving the apparatus.
0, = difference in temperature between the two fluids at the entrance
to the apparatus.
6e = difference in temperature at the exit of the apparatus.
6m = mean difference in temperature.
The curves in Fig. i cannot be straight lines, for the transfer of heat
between the two fluids is proportional to their difference in temperature.
1E. Hausbrand,—"Verdampfen, Kondensieren, und Kiihlen." Fifth edition, 1012.

DISTANCE ALONG APPARATUS


Therefore, as the cooler fluid gets warmer, the difference in temperature is
less and the rate of flow of heat is less. Consequently the slope of the line
which indicates the change in temperature is less. It can be shown that for
all cases where the flow of heat is strictly proportional to the temperature
difference, these lines must be parabolas.
Now the mean temperature difference (0m) can only be the arithmetical
mean of 0a and 6e if the curves were straight lines—which they cannot be.
On the assumption that the curves are true parabolas it is found that the
same formula gives 6m for all four cases:—
0m=(A —».)/%.(«.)/(«.) (1)
Example. In a counter-current heat exchanger the cold liquid enters
at 10° and leaves at 8o°, while the warm liquid enters at ioo° and leaves at
50°. Then 0a = 50 — 10 = 40, and 0e «= 100 — 80 = 20
0m =(40 — 20) / loge (40 / 20) = 20 / 0.6931 = 28f5°.
This formula is rather cumbersome to use, as tables of natural logar-
ithms are not common. The formula may be modified to allow greater ease
in calculation, with a small sacrifice in accuracy. The following table gives
factors, based on the ratio of 0a to 0e, by which 0a is to be multiplied to
give 6m.

So, in the above example, 0a = 400, and 6a / 0a = 0.500. From the table the
factor for this case is 0.724. Multiplying 0a by this factor we have
dm = 28.960 instead of 28.850 by the rigid formula.
Parallel-current Operation vs. Counter-current. The essential
differences may be inferred directly from the curves in Fig. 1. In compar-
ing the two on the basis of capacity in a given apparatus, it is seen that 6m is
always much larger in parallel-current operation. .Therefore, other condi-
tions being equal, more heat will be transmitted per unit of area than with
counter-current and the total capacity of the apparatus, measured in B. T. U.
transmitted per unit time, will be greater.


In counter-current heating we have two features to consider. First,
as to the temperature to be reached, it will be seen that in parallel-current
heating tce can never be greater than tve, while in counter-current heating it
may approach fwa. That is, with a given initial temperature of the heating
medium we can get a higher final temperature of the heated substance.
Second, it will be seen that in counter-current heating, fwe may be nearly as
low as fca, while in parallel-current heating it can never be as low as /Cc-
That is, the hotter fluid may be cooled further, and therefore its heat more
fully utilized than in parallel-current heating. So, in general, for parallel-
current heating we have more heat passed through the heating surface, while
in counter-current we can heat to higher temperatures and have greater
efficiency.
II. HEATING LIQUIDS BY DIRECT FIRE
This is one of the cheapest methods of transmitting heat where power
does not enter into consideration. It is, however, inefficient and slow, and
not suited to many operations. When considering the boiling of water by
direct fire, as in the steam boiler, we find that American practice universally
allows 10 sq. ft. of heating surface per boiler horse power. Temperature
differences are very difficult to determine and an actual coefficient of heat
transmission can seldom be used. Since a boiler horse power is defined as
the evaporation of 34.5 lbs. of water from and at 2120 F. per hour, we find
that the above figures call for the passage of
3348 I!. T. U. per sq. ft. per hr. (2)
It is well known that this figure varies greatly. This manner of heating is
not of great interest to the chemical engineer, as it falls rather in the
province of the mechanical engineer. It may be stated, in passing, that any-
thing that increases the velocity of the gases over the heating surface greatly
increases the transmission of heat. Baffling the boiler so as to increase this
velocity may result in heat transmissions amounting to 200 to 300% of the
amount in (2) above, for continuous operation. Values as high as ten
times as great as (2) have been obtained experimentally.2
When we come to heating with hot flue gases at moderate temperatures
we find more application to the chemical industries. This finds a use in the
familiar economizer as applied to boilers, and to many forms of apparatus
used to absorb heat from waste gases. The old salt pan was an example of
this style of heating.
The general statement of the transmission of heat is that it varies with
the temperature difference. It may be stated as
W = kHGm (3)
where /(' = amount of heat passing per hour through a heating surface
whose area is //, when the temperature difference is (?,„. k is a constant
whose value varies widely according to conditions.
2 Sec U. S. Bureau of Mines, Bull. No. vr,—"The Transmission of Heat into Steam
Boilers" for an exhaustive discussion of this subject.


From a digest of available experiments, Hausbrand concludes that for
the transmission of heat from hot air to water or other similar liquids, the
liquid being inside clean iron tubes and not boiling
k = 2 -f- IO\/^ (4)
and
W = (2 + ioVv) H 0m (5)
where v= velocity of the air in meters per second
W = total heat passed in large calories per hour
H = heating surface in sq. m.
6m = mean difference in temperature in degrees C.
In English units
U"=(o.6+i7Vi'')HTn (6)
Where W, v', H', and '0m are B.T.fcJ. per hr., velocity in ft. per sec, heat-
ing surface in sq. ft., and degrees F., respectively.
When heating with flue gases instead of air (all other conditions being
as specified for (4)) the soot and dirt which they always carry calls for a
lower value of k; and we may take, in metric units,
IV = (2 + 5Vr:)H0m (7)
and in English units
W = (0.6 + 0.85Vc'') H'$'m (8)
where the symbols have the same values as in (5) and (6).
When the velocity of the flue gases is not known, a value not greater
than 20 may be assumed for r(or z'') in (5), 60 in (6), 13 in (7) and 40
in (8).
Example. 100 kg. of water per hr. are to be heated in an economizer
from io° C to 100 C. There are available stack gases at 3000 C, which
should not be cooled below 1503 C. How much heating surface is needed?
Assume a counter-current arrangement. 0a = 300 — 100 = 200;
#e =150 — 10 = 140. 6„/6a = 0.70, from the table on p.SFt the factor is
0.843. Multiply 0a by this gives 6m = 168.60. Assuming v = 13 and sub-
stituting in (7),
100 (100 — 10) = (2 + 5V3) ' H • 168.6
from which H = 26.70 sq. m.
Twenty-one experiments on economizers gave values for k in (7) vary-
ing from 8.95 to 13.62; average, 11.69.
III. THE TRANSFER OF HEAT FROM STEAM TO WATER
The transfer of heat from steam to water is by far the most useful
method, so far as the chemical engineer is concerned. The subject, however,
is a very complicated one and many conditions affect the results. It is
necessary to have a thorough understanding of the factors affecting the


transmission of heat from steam to water before attempting to discuss
numerical data.
Imagine a plate of copper or brass one foot square and y&amp; inch thick,
with steam on one side and water on the other, and with a difference in
temperature of i° F between the two sides. If we consult the data in hand-
books, we find that the thermal conductivity of brass is such that under the
circumstances we should expect about 4500 B. T. U. per hour to pass
through the square foot of surface. Actually we find that from 200 to
600 B. T. U.—averaging about 300—will pass if the water is boiling; while
if the water does not boil the heat passing may drop to possibly 60 B. T. U.
Evidently there is some resistance offered to the passage of heat through
the plate other than the thermal resistivity of the metal.
If we consider more closely the conditions existing on both sides of the
plate, we find that we may be fairly sure of the existence of the following
layers as we pass from steam to water:
1. A layer of mobile condensed water. If the surface is vertical or
inclined, this layer will increase in thickness toward the lower edge; if
horizontal, it will be nearly uniform and will have little motion.
2. A very thin—possibly molecular—layer of water at the surface of
the metal, held by molecular forces so closely that it has practically no
motion. Its exact condition is obscure, but it is not mobile and is very
tightly held. The word "adsorbed" has been coined to express this condition.
3. The layer of metal.
4. A layer of scale or other deposit.
5. A layer of adsorbed water similar to 2.
6. The free-moving and boiling liquid.
Now we know that heat passes through liquids by conduction very slow-
ly indeed. Most of the heat transfer into or through liquids is by convec-
tion, and the amount of heat so transferred is a function of the velocity of
circulation of the liquid. The conductivity of the scale is more of the order
of magnitude of that of the metal rather than of the water. Hence it would
seem that the bulk of the resistance to the flow of heat is in layers 1, 2, and 5.
Austin3 has investigated the magnitude of these surface resistances and finds
that they are equivalent to from 20 to 100 cm. of iron, according to condi-
tions. The actual thickness of layer 1 and 2 together is perhaps between 0.01
and 0.1 mm. Evidently a very important feature of all heating apparatus
of this nature is the provision of means to keep these layers of high thermal
resistance as thin as possible.
In the late 80s and early 90's this whole matter was carefully investi-
gated, first on a small scale and later on full-sized factory apparatus, by Dr.
H. Claassen, the superintendent of a German beet-sugar factory. His work
is the foundation of all we know on this subject. His final summary of the
effect of conditions on the transmission of heat from steam to water through
metallic surfaces is summed up as follows:—
'Zeitschrift dcs vereins dcr dcutschen Zuckcrindustrie, 1902, p. 1890


3i
The transfer of heat from steam to water depends on:
1. The speed of movement of the liquid over the heating surface.
2. The depth of the liquid, or the pressure, on the heating surface.
3. The speed with which the steam circulates over the heating surface.
4. The speed and thoroughness with which the condensed water is
drained away from the heating surface.
5. The removal of non-condensible gases from the steam space.
6. The freedom of the heating surface from scale or other foreign
substances.
7. The viscosity of the liquid.
8. The temperature at which the liquid is boiled.
9. The magnitude of the temperature drop between the steam and the
boiling liquid.
10. The nature and thickness of the metal wall.4
It will be worth while to consider these principles in some detail as they
are very fundamental. All devices in which liquids are to be heated with
steam must be considered in the light of these points.
The speed of the liquid has a bearing on the heat transmission in several
ways. First, conduction through a liquid is very slow. The bulk of the heat
must pass into the body of the liquid by convection from the surface. Any-
thing which increases the motion of the liquid increases the rate at which
highly heated layers near the heating surface are mixed with the main part
of the liquid and new, cooler layers are brought into contact with the hot
metal. Second, when the liquid boils, the bubbles of steam are formed at
the surface of the metal much faster than in the body of the liquid. They
often show a tendency to adhere to the metal and thus reduce the area in
actual contact with the liquid. Increasing the liquid velocity tends to sweep
away these bubbles. Third, it is undoubtedly true that the layer of adsorbed
liquid may be partially scoured away by the friction of rapidity moving
liquid. Since this film is one of the greatest obstacles to the flow of heat,
influences tending to reduce it will contribute greatly to the rate of heat
transmission.
The effect of the depth of the liquid is summed up in the increase in
boiling point caused by the hydrostatic head. Supopse water is boiling in
an open vessel. The boiling point of the surface layer only is ioo° C. At
lower depths the boiling point is higher because the particle of liquid con-
sidered is under a pressure of atmospheric plus the hydrostatic head due to
its depth of immersion. This increase in boiling point cannot be measured
for it exists only in the layer immediately adjacent to the heating surface.
Any measuring device could only take the temperature of the liquid at dis-
tances great enough so that all the liquid would be thoroughly mixed. The
magnitude of the effect is slight at atmospheric or higher pressures, but
becomes decidedly greater at lower pressures. The following table from
Hausbrand shows the calculated increase in boiling point in degrees C.

When it is remembered that depths of liquid of 2 meters are not uncommon
in evaporators, and that, at pressures around atmospheric or a little above, it
is not unreasonable to design with a mean temperature difference of 5° C, it
is seen that the lower parts of the heating surface may not be active as they
may be surrounded by a film of liquid whose boiling point is higher than the
temperature of the heating steam.
In thinking of the speed of the steam, we have again to remember that
the adsorbed film of water at the surface of the metal has a high resistance.
Increasing the speed of the steam not only helps to scrape away the mobile
layer of condensed water, but has an effect on the inner film as well. Also
we must remember that it is only those molecules of steam that impinge on
the heating surface that give up their heat to it. In a wide tube with low
velocities we may have a central core of steam molecules which never come
into contact with the wall. It is a matter of common experience that in all
forms of heating and evaporating apparatus the boiling is most vigorous
and appears soonest immediately around the place where the steam first
strikes the metal wall. This would seem to indicate that it is advisable to
make the cross-section of the steam space as small as possible and thereby
increase the steam velocity. This may be carried to an extreme; for the
cross-section may be too small to admit enough steam to keep up the pres-
sure. It is easily possible to have a heating coil so long in proportion to its
width that the end is cold, due to insufficient area of the opening.
The effect of draining of condensate is obvious. In the case of large
heating surfaces considerable ingenuity must be exercised to prevent flood-
ing the lower parts with condensate from the upper parts. This, also, is
another disadvantage of very long coils.
All steam contains air; many solutions evolve gases which pass into
the steam evolved from their boiling; and all apparatus under vacuum will
have some leaks. Since in complex processes the steam boiled off from a
solution at one step may be used under a higher vacuum at another step, it
is plain that the steam will be poorer in actual water vapor as it is re-used.
Naturally these non-condensible gases will collect in the farthest part of the
steam space and must be vented from that point. Just what is to be con-
sidered the farthest part of the steam space is not always a simple matter
to determine. This must be solved by studying the lines of flow of the
steam.
Another effect of air in the steam is to decrease its temperature. The
total pressure of the air-steam mixture is the sum of the partial pressures


of the air and the steam. But the temperature of the mixture depends on
the pressure of the water vapor alone. Hence the temperature of such a
mixture is always less than would be determined from the pressure on the
assumption of saturated steam. It is altogether too common to measure
pressure alone and determine the temperature from the steam tables.
The effect of scale is obvious. Its effect has, however, been exag-
gerated as compared to the effect of surface films of water.
The principal effect of the viscosity of the liquid is its effect on the
circulation. Not only does an increase in viscosity lower the velocity of
circulation of the liquid mass, but also increases the thickness of the film of
liquid adhering to the surfaces for a given velocity. Very thick and viscous
liquids are troublesome to handle from all points of view.
The temperature at which the liquid is boiled has a small and rather
obscure effect. For a given temperature drop and with all other conditions
equal, the rate of heat transmission is greater at higher temperatures. This
is partly due to the increased density of the heating steam, which permits
more steam molecules to come in contact with a given area of the heating
surface per unit of time. It is also partly due to the decreased viscosity of
all liquids at higher temperatures.
It is usually considered almost axiomatic that heat transmission is
proportional to the temperature drop. Claassen"' claims that as the tempera-
ture drop becomes greater, the rate of heat transmission per degree drop
increases. He ascribes this to the increased circulation caused by the in-
creased rate of liberation of steam. Kerr" cites experiments to show that
this is not the case and that the rate of heat transmission is independent of
the temperature drop. His experiments are possibly faulty and the proba-
bility is with Claasen's view.
As far as the thermal resistance of the metal wall is concerned, it is
obvious from what has been said above that this will have a minor effect
on the total heat transmission. The exact proportion by which it influences
the result depends on the magnitude of the purely surface effects, and they
are very difficult to determine. By taking the most reasonable figures for
the resistance of the various surface films, Hausbrand has calculated the
following tables, which show the relative effect of the nature and thickness
of the metal:

IV. PROPORTIONS OF STEAM COILS
From what has been said above, it is obvious that a hard and fast factor
for the transmission of heat through steam coils cannot be found. The
factors affecting heat transfer are too obscure to express them in a general
formula. Many attempts have been made, but all have resulted in clumsy
or inaccurate formulas.
From a digest of a large number of experiments on all kinds of heating
coils and pipes, Hausbrand deduces the following:—
The transmission of heat from steam inside copper tubes to water which
boils may be represented by
■*=i90o/ V(rfO- (9)
where k is the heat transmitted in large calories per sq, meter per hr. per
degree C, and d and / are the diameter and length of the tube, both in
meters.
In English units
V = 15320 /V (&lt;*'*') (10)
where k' is in B. T. U. per sq. ft. per degree F. per hr., and d' and f are the
diameter and length of the tube in inches. The total amount of heat (W)
in B. T. U. per hour, passing through the surface of a tube of H' sq. ft.
heating surface, with a temperature difference of 0'm degrees F. between the
steam and water, is
W'= (15320 H' 0'm)/y(&lt;f'/') (11)
If we multiply (11) by V(t/t) we have
W" = (15320 V*H' 6'm)/V(d'l'n) (12)
and remembering that the cylindrical surface of a tube is ir d /, (whence
\/(ird /)= y/H,) we may write
W =15320 (VW#')0m (13)
Multiplying out and taking 2/3 for safety, we have as a final working
formula in English units
W'= i8ioo(V#') Vm (14)
The corresponding transformation give, in metric units,
lV = 2200(VH)6m (15)
In using these formulas (14 and 15) it must always be remembered
that in the step between (12) and (13) a factor for the surface of one tube
was introduced. Hence if the amount of heat to be transmitted is such that
more than one tube is used, W or W must be taken as the heat transmitted
by one tube and not the total amount of heat.


If the conditions are other than those for which these formulas are
expressly derived (steam inside copper tubes surrounded by boiling water)
a factor must be used. The following table gives factors by which W or W
(in equation 14 or 15) is to be multiplied to get the total amount of heat
transmitted by each tube. Cu is taken as 2 mm. thick; wrought iron as 3 to
4 mm., cast iron as 10 mm. and Pb as 10 mm. thick—
Wrought Cast
Cu iron iron Pb
Solutions from o to 10% solids 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.45
Solutions from 10 to 25% solids 0.75 0.60 0.40 0.33
Pasty or crystallizing liquids 0.50 0.40 0.25 0.225
For these last the dimensions of the heating surface are of less importance
than the arrangement of the apparatus to promote circulation and easy
handling of the mass.
In properly proportioned tubes, 6m may be taken as 90% of the calcu-
lated value.
In deciding on the diameter of the tubes, there will often be incidental
considerations which will settle the matter. The actual diameter is of less
importance from the thermal standpoint than the ratio of length to diameter.
Hausbrand has calculated the following:
Where 6m = 30 to 400 C (0m' — 55 to 70° F), the ratio of length to
diameter should be
Temperature (C) 152 144 134 120 112 106 95 80
Temperature (F) 306 291 273 248 234 223 203 176
Pressure (Atm. absolute) 5 4 3 2 1.5 1.25 0.83 0.47
l/d 275 250 225 200 175 150 125 100
If the mean temperature difference is other than that assumed for the table,
multiply the values there given for l/d by 6/ V0m; or, in English units,
7/VC
(to be continued)


COLOR PROPERTIES
PAUL H. GEIGER
THE processes of paint making do
not produce results perfectly
uniform in color, even in cases where
the same formula is employed. It is
necessary, therefore, to have some
method of judging of a factory pro-
duct, whether or not it has the desir-
ed color qualities. Therefore the new
paints are matched against appropri-
ate samples which represent color
standards. There are two difficulties
in this method of testing paints. The
samples may change with age, and
by varying amounts. Also, there is no
way of expressing the amount by
which a new product fails to conform
to the standard. Perhaps, too, the
storing of an indefinite number of
samples may be considered a burden.
To avoid these troubles a scientific
method of color analysis is obviously
desireable. The Nutting Colorimeter
was designed to make possible this
scientific method. One of these instru-
ments was purchased by the Acme
White Lead and Color Works and by
the suggestion of Dr. Holley, the chief
chemist of that company and a mem-
ber of the Chemical Engineering fac-
ulty of the University, it was brought
to the physical laboratory in Ann Ar-
bor and work done with it on the
Acme White Lead and Color Works
fellowship.
The principle upon which the Nutt-
ing Colorimeter works may be stated
as follows: If white light falls upon
any surface then the light scattered
from it may be matched both in color
and in intensity by a mixture, in prop-
er proportions, of white light and
monochromatic light of appropriate
color. This principle has been shown
to be true experimentally and is quite
generally accepted by color psycholo-
gists. It is discussed at length in "Col-
or Measurement and Mixture," by W.
W. Abney.
Figure I shows the optical diagram
of the Nutting Colorimeter. R is a
white chalk reflecting surface and R'
is the sample whose color properties
are to be analyzed. Both are illumin-
ated by the standard white light.
Since this light needs to be reproduc-
ed in quality, at each test, care was
taken to select a good standard. A
triple acetylene burner manufactured
by the Eastman Kodak Company was
finally selected as a standard. The
pressure at which the acetylene was
fed to this burner was carefully regu-
lated and kept constant by the use of
a U-tube manometer. Another acetyl-
ene burner was placed at N, the light
from which was focused by lens L
upon the slit S. From the slit the
light passed through a pair of nicol
prisms and then through the constant
deviation prism at P, which produces
a spectrum. Only a small part of the
spectrum, however, is used, that is,
only light of a definite color or wave-
length finally passes through the glass
plate M to the Lummer-Brodhun
photometer cube B. The wave-length
of the light used is regulated by turn-
ing the drum D which slowly rotates
the prism. On D is a scale on which
is read the exact wave-length of the

light which is effective in the eye-piece
E. With this colored light is mixed,
at glass plate M, white light from the
surface R, which passes through nicol
A2. This mixed light is seen in the
center of the field of view in the eye-
piece; the other portion of the field of
view is illuminated by light through
the nicol prisms A3 from the sample
at R'. It is understood of course that
Nutting Colorimeter


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the function of the Lummer-Brodhun
cube is to separate the light from the
two sources (M and R') so as to give
two distinct fields, each illuminated by
one of these sources.
The function of the nicol prisms is
to alter the intensity of the light, from
zero when the nicols are crossed (the
vernier attached reading 90°) to the
maximum when the reading on the
scales would be 0°. Now it is evident
by the fundamental principle of color
matching, which is given above, that
the inside part of the field can be made
to exactly match the outside of the
field, for by adjusting the wave-length
drum D and the nicol At we can vary
the color and the intensity of the col-
ored light and by adjusting A2 we can
secure the desired amount of white
light in the mixture.
A record of that reading of the
verniers on the nicol prisms and the
wave-length wheel might be said to
constitute a record of the sample, but
the meaning of the record would be
valueless unless accompanied by a
long description of the apparatus it-
self. It is natural to want some num-
ber which expresses an easily stated
property of the paint. A statement of
that number has then some clear
meaning, apart from any knowledge
of the machine from which it is ob-
tained. Such properties which may be
easily stated and which completely
determine the color properties of a
painted surface are: first, wave-length
of the monochromatic light used; sec-
ond, percentage of the light reflected
which is white light; third, total re-
flecting power of the sample, which
may be defined as the ratio between
the total light reflected to the total
light incident upon the surface. To
define the properties of a colored sur-
face each and every one of these three
values must be given. Two surfaces
appearing different to the eye may
differ in one, two, or all of these three
constants.
To secure these constants is the ob-
jective point in manipulation. The
wave-length of the monochromatic
beam is read directly from the drum
at color match, and nothing further in
color specification is required. It can
be shown by mathematical and phys-
ical considerations that the percentage
of white in the mixture is given by the
formula
Percentage white light=
100/( i+C) (cos2 Ac)/(cos2 At)
where C is a constant of the instru-
ment, Ac is the reading at Q when
the instrument is adjusted so that the
center part of the field view exactly
matches the outer part, or in other
words there is a "color match." At is
the reading at Cx when there is a
"flicker match," to explain this a
further description of the apparatus
is required. The third constant, the
total reflecting power, is obtained in a
manner which will be described later
in this article.
The constant C depends upon the
construction of the instrument and
the reflecting powers of certain of its
parts. The constant for the particular
instrument used was found by an ex-
tended series of observations. In the
discussion of the instrument given
above it was stated that M was a glass
plate. In fact, however, M was a disc
divided into four equal sectors, two
of which were glass and the other two
nickeled mirrors. The disc was so
mounted that it could be rotated by a
variable speed motor outside of the
instrument. As the motor was re-
volved, first a glass plate, then a mir-
ror, then the other glass plate and
so on, came in position in front of the
nicol A.,. This disc therefore formed


39
a flicker photometer for comparing
the intensities of the colored light from
the prism and the white light from the
nicol A2. When color matches are be-
ing made the motor is not rotated and
the glass plate sector is in place, so
the statements made above are ap-
plicable. After this color match is
made, the motor is started, nicols at
A3 are crossed, thereby permitting no
light to go through them. Nicols A2
are left in the same position as when
the color match was being made, and
At is adjusted so that no flicker can
be observed in the eye-piece, or in
other words, so that the light reflected
from the mirrors when eitherof them
is in place is equal to the sum of the
light (from A2) reflected by the glass
sectors plus the light through these
sectors from the prism P. This read-
ing of A1 is called Af in the formula
for percentage white light given
above. The use of a flicker photo-
meter is so well known that it is use-
less to enter further into the theory
of its operation.
From the above considerations it is
evident how the percentage white
light is found. Next it is necessary to
find the third determining factor:—
the total reflecting power of the color
sample, which is the ratio of the light
reflected to the incident light. The
method used for determining this last
factor is primarily a method of com-
parison with a standard. The stand-
ard reflecting surface used was a
block of magnesium carbonate whose
reflecting power was taken as 88%.
(Nutting, Jones, and Elliott: "Tests
of Some Possible Reflecting Power
Standards." "Transactions Illumin-
ating Engineering Society," Volume
9, No. 7, 1914.)
The standard surface was placed
before nicol A2 of the Nutting Colori-
meter, in a box lined with a white
matte paper. In this box was placed
an electric lamp through which a de-
finite current passed which was of
such a magnitude that the resulting
light exactly matched the light from
the standard acetylene burner. The
reflecting surface was protected from
all direct rays by an opaque shield.
This method of illuminating the sur-
face gave freedom from any effect
which might be caused by the turning
of the surface being tested, in case
Lambert's Cosine law could not be
applied. Nicol Ax was adjusted for
no flicker (reading=A„) then the
standard was replaced by the surface
to be tested and Ax was again adjust-
ed for no flicker (reading=Ax).
Then the reflecting power is obtained
from the formula
R=.88 (cos2AI)//(cos2A8).
This method offers an advantage
over several others in that a flicker
photometer is used, this type of photo-
meter is recognized to be the one best
suited for matching intensities of two
differently colored beams. By com-
paring results obtained by different
observers under different conditions,
it was shown that the results are ac-
curate to one-half of one percent.
Visibility Curve
The Nutting Colorimeter can also
be used to compare the sensibility of
the eye for different wave-lengths,
and to show how the sight of different
individuals varies. It is a well known
fact that the color for maximum sen-
sibility of the eyes is different for
different observers, and that some can
see farther into the ultra-violet or the
infra-red than others. These individ-
ual differences are shown by visibility
curves, where comparative sensibili-
ties of the eye are plotted against
wave-length. In order to get data for


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
a curve like this the light going
through nicols A2 is kept constant,
and the position of A, is recorded for
different wave-lengths, which are var-
ied by turning drum D. Since the
energy of the source at N is not con-
stant at different wave-lengths it is
necessary to take into account the en-
ergy curve of this light source.
The visibility curves which were
obtained showed interesting character-
istics of the observers. The curves
may be of value in two ways: In the
first place, they would detect any de-
parture from normality of the eyes,
and, second, they might be used to ex-
plain any difference between the re-
sults for the wave-length of the dom-
inant hue (the monochromatic light
used to make the color match) obtain-
ed by different observers. Also a
person whose eyes were very sensitive
in the red would obtain a greater value
for the total reflecting power of a
deep red reflecting surface, than
would one with normal vision.


INTEGRATION
THEODORE R. RUNNING
It is not the purpose of this article to explain the different methods for
differentiating and integrating graphically hut to set forth in its simplest
form one method which, in the judgment of the writer, is the most accurate,
and, at the same time, most easily carried out. The method applies equally
well to tabulated functions and to functions represented by curves. The
method depends upon the principle of areas. Its application to integration
is well known, but its application to differentiation seems to be new.*
Many of the problems in the varied fields of engineering and applied
science involve the principles of the calculus. These problems, when they
arise from a consideration of observed data, do not often lend themselves to
a direct application of differentiation or integration formulas. They are fre-
quently of such a nature that accurate results are neither necessary nor
possible. The "allowable error" is an important consideration when taking
up the work of solving such problems.
It it is know:n that the data used as a basis may be in error as much as
one per cent it would manifestly l&gt;e needless to employ computation which
yields a higher degree of accuracy. Any mechanical means for obtaining
results to a sufficient degree of accuracy with the least amount of effort will
not only be a saving of time and mental wear, but will also lessen the prob-
ability of error.
Graphical representation of data, graphical computation, and graphical
solution of formulas are processes well known and often employed. Graph-
ical differentiation and graphical integration, however, are often replaced
by cumbersome and less accurate methods. It is indeed in the application to
differentiation and integration that graphical methods are most useful.
Graphical methods in general have a decided advantage over numerical
processes in one respect; they place before the eye more clearly and strik-
ingly the relation between the elements which enter into a given problem.
Any error which may materially affect the result is at once detected by
the eye.
Consider the curve AB, Fig. i, the integral curve of which is to be
constructed. From calculus the area under the curve between any two
ordinates, x — o and x = a, say, is represented by the definite integral
Y = fVr
where y stands for the ordinate of any point on the curve and Y for the
area. If now the area be taken from x = o to x = 0.5, and this area rep-
* After this article toes written the writer discovered that the method was pub-
lished by Holder; "Bin enfaches und genaues Verfahren der graphischen Differentia-
tion," Zcitschrift fur Turbincnwcscn, I'ol. to, pp. 455-456.

resented by an ordinate, it will locate a point P on the integral curve. If the
integral be taken from .r = o to x=i, that is a=i, and this area repre-
sented as an ordinate, it will locate the point Q on the integral curve.
Graphically these areas are determined as follows: Draw a line, EG,
parallel to the x-axis so that the area ABF is equal to the area FGH. This
can be done to a close degree of approximation, for the eye is a very good


judge of the equality of small areas. The area of the rectangle CEGa will
be equal to the area under the curve AH. This area is then computed and
the number of square units in this area represented by the ordinate aP.
Draw a line KM so that the area HKL is equal to LMN, then the area in
the rectangle aM will be equal to the area under the curve HN. This area
is represented by the line bQ, and the area under the curve AN will be
represented by the ordinate of the point Q. After a number of points are
determined as above, a smooth curve is drawn through them. This is the
integral curve. It is here assumed that the constant of integration is such
that the integral curve passes through the origin.
This process can be reversed. Given the curve CD it is required to find
the derived curve. The process is as follows: Measure the length of the
line aP. This will represent the number of square units under the derived
curve bounded by x = o and x = 0.5. Having this area, the rectangle CG
is now constructed. The length of the line bQ will represent the number of
square units in the area under the derived curve from .v = o.5 to x=l.
Having this area, the rectangle aM is similarly constructed. So, also, the
length of the line cR will represent the area under the derived curve from
x = 1 to x= 1.5. The above statements become evident from the definite
integral
,X"ydx=Yi—Y1
f
where y is the ordinate on the derived curve and Y^ and Y2 are ordinates
on the integral curve corresponding to xt and x2.
Now if a smooth curve AB be drawn such that the areas have the rela-
tion described in the integration the derived curve is obtained. An illustra-
tion is given below. The observed temperature O in degrees centigrade of a
vessel of cooling water at time t in minutes from the first observation is
given in the following table:
t
o
o 1 2 3 5 7 10 15 20
92.0 85.3 79.5 74.5 67.0 60.5 53.5 45.0 39.5
In Fig. 2 the curve represents in this data is designated by O. The difference
between the values of O corresponding to t = o and t = 1 is — 6.7. This
represents the area under the derived curve from t = o to t = 1 and since it
is negative, should be drawn below the t — axis, but for the purpose of
economy in space is drawn above it and the values of dO/dt indicated as
negative. This area is represented in the figure by a restangle whose upper
boundary is drawn. The difference between the values of O corresponding
to t = 1, and t = 2, which is — 5.8, is represented by the rectangle whose
upper boundary is indicated between t — 1 and t = 2. The other marking
the upper boundaries of rectangles are obtained in the same way.
A smooth curve is now drawn as described under graphical differentia-
tion. This is the derived curve and is designated by dO/dt. The ordinates
of this curve are the slopes at the corresponding points on the O curve. The
ordinates on the derived curve represent the time rate of change of tempera-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ture. The process of rinding the second derived curve is evident and needs
no further explanation.
The following is an illustration of integration: A beam 10 ft. long is
loaded as in the table below, where w is the weight per unit length at the
distance x ft. from the free end.

Let it be required:
1. to draw the integral curves to show
a. the shearing force, s= I zvd.v,
b. the bending moment, M = j sd.r,
2. to locate the position of the centroid along the beam.
The curve determined by sets of values of x and w is designated by w
in Fig. 3. This curve is integrated as was explained at the outset, the


45
horizontal lines indicating the upper boundaries of the rectangles. In this
way the curve marked S is obtained. Any ordinate on the curve represents
the shearing force on that section.
This curve is integrated and the curve marked M in the figure is ob-
tained. Any ordinate on this curve represents the bending moment about the

section containing the ordinate. If the value of M be divided by the value
of 5" at x= 10, the position of the centroid is at once obtained. This is done
graphically and is found to be approximately 6.2 ft. to the right of the free
end.


The proof that the curve M in Fig. 3 is the moment curve is quite
simple. From calculus, the moment of the weight to the left of any section,
.r= a, about that section is expressed by the definite integral
M = I (a — .r) wdx
Integrating this by parts and remembering that both a and w are variables,
we obtain
M = (x — v) Civdx + f Czvdxdx
The first term in this expression is zero when x = 0, and it is also equal to
zero when x = a. It appears then that
j (a — x) wdx= j f wdxdx
The right hand member is but a repeated integral which gives the curve M.
This process could easily be extended to moments of intertia, but enough
has been given for illustration. It might be added that integrating the M
curve in Fig. 3 will give a curve whose ordinates represent one-half of the
moment of inertia about the section containing the ordinate.


OHIO ENGINEERS FAVOR LICENSING
C. E. Drayer
Secretary, A. A. E. Discusses Need of Licensing All Engineers
MEMBERS of the Ohio Engineer-
ing Society on the first day of
its annual convention in Columbus,
voted unanimously in favor of the
principle of licensing engineers. It is
expected that the bill will be presented
to the state legislature at its present
session. The action of the Ohio Eng-
ineering Society followed an address
on "Licensing" by C. E. Drayer, Sec-
retary of the American Association of
Engineers.
President Clyde T. Morris of the
Association of Ohio Technical Soci-
eties announced a plan for the study
of the subject of licensing by all eng-
ineering organizations of Ohio in or-
der that a generally acceptable bill
may be drafted. He has called upon
the societies composing the Ohio
Association of Technical Societies tb
name committees on licensing. A con-
ference will be called at Columbus in
the near future for discussion and the
drafting of the bill.
Mr. Drayer emphasized the necess-
ity of such a law to provide for the
safety of our citizens and pointed out
that efficiency would be increased, re-
sulting in a very great saving to the
public. Licensing would help to digni-
fy the profession by tending to elevate
it. Licensing would promote unity of
the profession by pulling the control
of it by law into the hands of engi-
neers.
License laws now in effect in the
several states, as well as bills proposed
that failed of passage, and bills pend-
ing or to be introduced, were review-
ed and a comparative statement of
them prepared by the Committee on
Legislation of the American Associa-
tion of Engineers was exhibited. In
this chart the model law proposed by
the American Association of Engi-
neers in 1915 was used as a basis. It
was announced that the Legislative
Committee of the American Associa-
tion of Engineers would present a new
proposed law in about one month.
The need was recognized of a
"grandfather's clause" in any bill in
order to avoid an ex post facto law
and in order not to work hardship
upon anyone now in the practice of
the profession.
Regarding the question as to licens-
ing, for instance, only civil engineers
and surveyors, or all engineers, Mr.
Drayer siad, "Another moot point is
whether all branches of engineering
should be included, civil, mechanical,
electrical, mining and the score or
more of other varieties—or only the
civil. It must be borne in mind that
the line dividing them in many phases
of public work is rather imaginary—
for instance, in the construction of a
municipal waterworks and lighting
plant. The tendency is to increase
public utilities so that it is fair to as-
sume that more and more of the engi-
neer's work in the future will be in
public service.
It might be held in some quarters
that the mining engineer need not be
licensed if the principle underlying the


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
proposed legislation is to protect the
public. The safety of many lived de-
pends on the mining engineer, and
likewise the safety of millions of dol-
lars. It has been said by an experi-
enced mining engineer that four out
of five mining ventures, in all of which
the public invests its good money,
would not have been undertaken had
they been reported upon by a compe-
tent mining engineer.
Reasoning from analogy, one may
ask the proponents of licensing one
branch of the profession, "Why aren't
doctors examined only in the specialty
they practice, instead of in medicine
and anatomy and the like? Why are-
n't lawyers who will practice corpora-
tion law examined in this branch only,
instead of on general principles and
practices of law?"
The proper course would seem to
be to examine all engineers in the
fundamentals common to all branches,
as they come up to practice. Such
procedure might make possible the
drafting of a simple law which would
find general acceptance."
MICHIGAN'S PROPOSED ENGINEER LICENSE BILLS
We are presenting below the two
Engineer-License Bills as placed be-
fore the present session of the State
Legislature. There seems to be little
doubt at present but that one of these
bills, or a compromise of the two, will
be soon in force.
The first bill was drawn up by the
Michigan (State) Engineering So-
ciety. Its development has been fol-
lowed in various issues of the Tech-
nic. The second bill combines the
licensing of engineers and architects.
AN ACT providing for the certifica-
tion of engineers who engage in
certain specified branches of engi-
neering, and for the organization
of a Board of Examining Engineers.
The people of the State of Michigan
enact:
Section I. Any citizen of Michi-
gan engaged as a principal in any one
or more of the following branches of
engineering; the design and erection
of structural work for buildings and
bridges; the measurement of streams;
the location, design, and supervision
of construction and maintenance of
dams, river and harbor improve-
ments, highways, railways, navigation
canals, drainage and irrigation works,
garbage disposal plants, public sani-
tary systems, public water works and
municipal paving; and the making of
surveys relating to property, political
and geographical boundaries; (space
for describing other fields of engi-
neering) within the State of Michi-
gan, and who has been engaged as a
principal therein for a period of not
less than two years prior to the 30th
day of September, A. D. 1919, may
file with the State Board of Exam-
ining Engineers (to be hereafter pro-
vided for and hereafter designated as
the Board), not later than the 15th
day of October, A. D. 1919, a sworn
statement setting forth in full his
training and experience. The Board
shall certify all engineers qualifying
under the provisions of this section.
The certificates issued shall refer by
number to the sworn statements furn-
ished by applicants and filed in the
office of the Board.
Section 2. From and after the first
day of October, A. D. 1919, any per-
son not having complied with the pro-
visions of Section 1, shall before en-
gaging as a principal in any one or
more of the branches of engineering


49
specified in said Section i, within the
State of Michigan, satisfy the Board
that he has had not less than six years
of practical experience in one or more
branches of such engineering work, or
shall have been graduated in engi-
neering from a recognized school or
college of engineering and shall have
had, in addition thereto, not less than
two years of practical experience. The
Board shall require all such applicants
to qualify by examination in one or
more (as the applicant may select)
of the branches of engineering speci-
fied in Section i of this Act. The
Board shall certify all engineers qual-
ifying under the provisions of this
section. Practical experience, gained
prior to the first day of October, A.
D. 1919, shall be construed as work
performed in any one or more of the
branches of engineering specified in
Section 1, either in the capacity of a
principal or as a subordinate. From
and after the first day of October,
A. D. 1919, practical experience shall
be construed as work performed in
any such branch or branches of en-
gineering as a subordinate under the
supervision of one or more certified
engineers.
Section 3. The Board shall con-
sist of three representative engineers,
who shall have been, at the time of
their appointments, residents of the
State of Michigan for not less than
five years and engaged in one or more
of the branches of engineering spe-
cified in Section 1, not less than ten
years. Only registered engineers
shall be eligible to appointment to
the Board from and after the first
day of October, A. D. 1919. The Gov-
ernor shall appoint one member from
the Upper Peninsula, one from that
portion of the Southern Peninsula ly-
ing north of the Michigan Base Line
and one member from that portion of
the State lying south of the Michigan
Base Line. The terms of office of the
members of the Board shall be six
years (one member to be appointed
every two years), excepting that when
appointments are first made, the Gov-
ernor shall appoint one member for a
term of six years, one for a term of
four years and one for a term of two
years. The members of the Board
so appointed shall, on the first day of
July following the regular session of
the Legislature, take and subscribe the
oath of office prescribed by the con-
stitution and shall file the same in the
office of the Secretary of State. When
a vacancy shall occur in the Board by
reason of the death or resignation of
a member thereof, or for other rea-
sons, the Governor shall fill such va-
cancy by appointment for the unex-
pired term. The Board shall organize
within itself, electing a President and
a Secretary. The Secretary of the
Board shall keep a record of all busi-
ness transacted by the Board. In or-
der that the Board may carry into
effect the provisions of this Act, it
shall have authority to make and ad-
minister rules and regulations, not in
conflict with the laws of the State. The
Board shall collect the following fees:
For issuing each initial certificate ten
($10) dollars; for each subsequent,
annual renewal of certificate, five ($5)
dollars. All moneys collected under
the provisions of this Act shall be de-
posited in the State Treasury and cred-
ited to the fund of the Board. Such
fund shall be available for paying the
expenses of the Board, including the
hire of clerical assistance. Money shall
be paid out from this fund by the
State Treasurer, upon warrant drawn
by the Board, and approved by the
Auditor General. The members of the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Board shall receive in compensation
for their services twenty-five ($25)
dollars for each day they are engaged
in the work of the Board. Their act-
ual and necessary traveling expenses
shall be defrayed. The certificates is-
sued under the provisions of this Act
shall be of such forms as the Board
may adopt. They shall bear the seal
of the Board and the signatures of
the President and Secretary. All cer-
tificates shall expire at the termina-
tion of one year from the dates of
issue. Annual certificates shall be is-
sued by the Board upon request of
certified engineers, accompanied by
the annual fee therefor. Any engineer
who fails to renew his certificate shall
cease to be a certified engineer. The
Board shall make a biennial report to
the Governor, to be filed on or before
the thirtieth day of June preceding
regular sessions of the State Legisla-
ture, which shall contain a complete
account of all business transacted by
the Board, together with a detailed
statement of all receipts and disburse-
ments.
Section 4. Any person, who fails
to comply with the provisions of this
Act, shall be ineligible to appointment
or election to any State, county, town-
ship, city, village or other public office
of trust or honor, within the State of
Michigan, where the duties of such
office or offices involve any one or
more of the branches of engineerig
specified in Section 1. No public offic-
er within the State of Michigan shall
accept any work, which involves any
one or more of the branches of en-
gineering specified in Section 1, from
any person who fails to comply with
the provisions of this Act. Any per-
sons who shall engage as a principal,
in any one or more of such branches
of engineering, except under a certifi-
cate issued by the Board, shall be sub-
ject to a fine of one hundred ($100)
dollars for the first offense and five
hundred ($500) dollars or imprison-
ment for one year or both, in the dis-
cretion of the court, for each and any
subsequent offense. The Board may
at any time revoke the certificate of

INDIANA STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS AND ARCHITECTS SUBMIT
LICENSE BILL TO LEGISLATURE
A bill for the "Licensing of Archi-
tects and Structural Engineers, and
for regulating the Practice of Archi-
tecture and Structural Engineering"
in Indiana has been submitted by the
Legislative Committee for the Archi-
tects and Structural Engineers of that
state.
The situation in Indiana is unusual
in that the Constitution of the State
provides that the County Surveyor
shall be elected. This prevents fixing
qualification on that office.
Partly because of that, the bill in
that state has been drawn to cover
Architects and Structural Engineers
and another bill is pending which pro-
vides qualification and salaries for
County Surveyors when they are made
the County Engineer of Roads and
Bridges of the County. By these two
bills they hope to be able to accomplish
the desired result of having all com-
petent Civil Engineers take licenses
and at the same time permitting the
practice of County Surveyors when
not qualified, as contemplated by the
Constitution.
The interesting feature of the pres-
ent bill is that Structural Engineers
are examined in Structural Engineer-
ing and Architects are examined in
Architecture but either license permits
practicing in the entire field of Archi-
tecture and Structural Engineering.

EDITORIAL
IN THIS ISSUE first two of which appear in this issue,
We are most fortunate, through the while the latter two will be published
courtesy of the Encyclopedia Amer- in the May Technic. Without doubt
icania, to be able to present the arti- Professor Greiner's article will prove
cle, "A Brief Survey of the Internal most interesting and instructive to its
Combustion Engine" by Assistant readers.
Professor A. F. Greiner of the Me- Professor Badger has kindly con-
chanical Engineering Department. He tributed an interesting article in which
divides his subject into four parts, the he discusses the types of chemical ap-


55
paratus used in heating and evaporat-
ing processes. This article, like the
previous one, appears in two parts, the
second part being held over to the
May TechNic. Written by one thor-
oughly versed in his subject, this con-
tribution may wisely be preserved for
future reference.
THE NEW STAFF
With the publication of the March
Technic the new staff of the maga-
zine makes its debut, receiving the
reins of management from the 1918
staff. Although the old staff officially
ended its duties with the December
issue, it is in part the result of their
faithful work that the March Tech-
nic has been a success.
With all military obstacles removed
and operating under normal condi-
tions the new staff trusts that it may
receive the same hearty support which
has been formerly accorded by alumni
and students, which will render it
possible to equal if not exceed the
standards established by its predeces-
sors.
A DIFFERENT UNIVERSITY
The past four months have wit-
nessed a great change at Michigan.
Military authority has given way to
civilian jurisdiction and Michigan will
soon be what she was previous to the
war.
The deeds and actions of Michi-
gan men in this world conflict have
proved her greatness. Many of her
sons will never return to their Alma
Mater — they have made the su-
preme sacrifice. We honor them.
Their names will ever be remembered
in the annals of University history.
Hundreds of former students have re-
turned from the service to assume ci-
vilian duties once more. Their return
indicates a love for their University,
faith in her principles and a very
successful future.
A large training camp is being rap-
idly changed into a university cam-
pus. All the temporary structures are
being salvaged and soon will occupy
prominence on near by farms instead
of marring beautiful campus scenes.
Lots that have been trodden beneath
the feet of many soldiers will soon be
changed into the beautiful lawns of
years gone by. Returning alumni will
find that a great change has taken
place. A costly library will have re-
placed the old one; the old surveying
shops will no longer detract from the
campus' beauty; and a new diagonal
walk will grace its green turf. No
longer will the footsteps of marching
sentries echo in the engineering arch.
Scholarship is again of prime impor-
tance. Classes have their full attend-
ance as a result of demobilization of
the S. A. T. C. Men of Michigan
have assumed the spirit of former
years. Athletics have almost returned
to the standard of normal times.
Nor is Michigan forgetting her so-
cial activities. The J-Hop came back
stronger than ever before. A sopho-
more Prom and a frosh Frolic are
events of the future. An "all man"
opera proves to be the greatest event
of the season.
Campus activities are also claiming
many aspirants. The disastrous slump
of the past year will be remedied
many times by the actions of the fu-
ture.
Indeed the University is witnessing
a great change, and the present year
will always be remembered as a period
of transformation at the University
of Michigan.

BOOK REVIEWS
Conveyance and Distribution of Water
for Water Supply. By Edward
Edward Wewmann, C.E. D. Van
Nostrand Co., New York, Publish-
ers. Cloth; 6 x g% in.; 700 pp., 367
illustrations, eight plates. Price,
This book is a "practical treatise for
water-works engineers and superin-
tendents." It discusses design, con-
struction and distribution from both
theoretical and practical standpoints.
The book is almost encyclopedic in
its nature and it is particularly valu-
able because of the wealth of data
from actual installations which it con-
tains. The author has also discussed
carefully the leading types and makes
of appurtenances and devices used on
water works, including gates, valves,
hydrants, water meters and recording
instruments.
Although written especially for
water-works engineers, this book will
form a valuable addition to the library
of any engineer interested in water
supply.

FACULTY MEMBERS RETURN FROM
THE SERVICE
Eight officers returned from the service
to the engineering faculty at the beginning
of the second semester; Col. A. H. Lovell
of the electrical engineering department;
Lieut. Col. W. C. Hoad, head of the san-
itary engineering department; Lieut. Col.
Walter Fishleigh, head of the automobile
engineering department; Major Peter
Field, associate professor of mathematics;
Major A. E. White, of the chemical engi-
neering faculty; Capt. A. J. Decker, of the
civil engineering faculty; Lieut. J. C. Palm-
er, of the department of descriptive geom-
etry and drawing, and Lieut. F. A. Mickle,
instructor in mechanical engineering.
These men have been in the service prac-
tically ever since the United States entered
the war. Others of the engineering col-
lege faculty will not get their discharges
before next summer sometime, and among
those who will not be able to return to the
university till next fall, is Col. A. H. White,
head of the department of chemical engi-
neering.

Dear Brother Freshmen: On bended
knee I appeal to you. Most of us have been
at Michigan for half a year, some of us
came but in February, but all of us have
been here long enough to become thorough-
ly familiar with Michigan's traditions re-
garding a Freshman. Michigan gives her
life to us, it is but right that we should
stand back of her with all our might, it is
but right that we should do for her the
little that she asks of us—that we unite
with her who exists for our good.
Michigan asks that we wear our "Frosh"
toques (or pots, as the case may be). That
does not seem like such a terrible demand;
to show that we are somewhat green and
at the same time to show that we are mem-
bers of the class of '22 hardly approaches
the unbearable. To respect upper classmen
is but a matter of decent courtesy. To
keep out of the first five rows of the
Majestic is not these days a very great
hardship. To learn the "Yellow and Blue"'
should appear almost as matter-of-course
as to learn the national anthem.
Copy intended for publication in this department should be in the hands of the Editor
on or before the following dates:—
For March issue February 12 For October issue October 1
For May issue April 12 For December issue... .November 12
Copy may be mailed, or taken in person, to the offices of The Michigan Technic,
269-271 Engineering Building, Ann Arbor, Mich.
Manuscript, photographs, or other copy will not be returned unless specifically re-
quested.
Ms. should be on 8JA x 11 paper, typewritten, with double space between lines.
Phtographs should be on glossy paper, and mailed fiat.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Michigan's New Library
Freshmen! I offer up my humble prayer
that you who do not uphold Michigan's
traditions are well entertained some evening
by the members of the Sophomore class—
if they don't teach you to uphold Mich-
igan's traditions, we other Freshmen will!

THE MAT FESTIVAL
The days set for the 26th Annual May
Festival are May 14, 15, 16, and 17th. The
Festival this year "will be commemorative
of our great Victory and will serve as a
tribute to the many members of the Univer-
sity Choral Union and the other patriotic
young men of the University, Ann Arbor
and its environs who have served their
country so gallantly." It will consist of
six concerts. Among the choral works will
be Hadley's "Ode to Music," Gounod's
"Faust," and a work entitled "Fair Land of
Freedom," written especially for the occa-
sion by Dr. Stanley.
Among the better known artists who will
appear are Mme. Louise Homer, Ossip
Gabrilowitsch, Emilio DeD Gogorza, and
Anna Fitziu. The orchestral background
will be furnished by the Chicago Symphony
Orchestra, of which Frederick Stock is
conductor.
SEWS FROM CHINA
We present below a letter from Prof.
Merrick to Prof. Davis telling in a very in-
teresting manner how Michigan men are
starting in on their work of controlling the
Yellow River.
Mr. Joseph Ripley, '76, is in charge of
this work. Associate Professor H. B. Mer-
rick, '98; Ass't. Professor C. O. Carey, '06;
Ass't. Professor Hugh Brodie, '07; Ralph
Goodrich, '03, and three other Michigan
graduates compose Mr. Ripley's staff.
A Letter to Professor J. B. Davis
Yu Fong Hsien, Shantung, China.
1918-12-8.
We left Ann Arbor on Aug. 18th and
sailed from San Francisco on the afternoon
of the 24th. On our way across we touch-
ed at Honolulu for a day and had a very
enjoyable time, stretching our legs on solid
land again. The island on which Honolulu
is built is a beautiful spot favored by nature
with warm, soft air and abundant rain and
sun. The rain was over for the day when
we arrived and we had sunshine and clean
fresh air for our visit. The foliage and
flowers are semi-tropical and that means
luxuriant and beautiful. We all felt the


59
charm of the place and would have liked
very much to have remained longer.
On our way from the islands to Japan we
had some very rough weather, encounter-
ing four monsoons, each one seeming worse
than those before. At last we steamed into
the harbor at Yokohama and all the peace
and calm with the beautiful, symmetrical
cone of Fujiama rising majestically to the
westward. We were given the option of
going either by rail or boat from Yokohama
to Osaka, so we took our railway tickets
and after a day in Tokio, spent an entire
day on the train crossing the island to re-
join the boat for the remainder of the trip
to Shanghai. We were impressed with the
industry and efficiency of the Japanese peo-
ple. They are not as thorough as the
Chinese and their manufactured products
are made for appearance rather than dur-
ability. They make the most of every foot
of their fertile soil.
The passage through the straits at Moji
was very interesting. Great numbers of
Japanese and Chinese boats of all sizes were
constantly passing and repassing. Very
few of the boats were Chinese, however.
It seemed odd to see such immense sails
made of straw matting. The Jap is an ex-
pert and fearless sailor and ventures far in
small and clumsy vessels.
We reached Shanghai on Sept. 21st as
per schedule, and took eave of the many
friends we had made on the way over.
They were a mixed ot from many different
walks in life. Soldiers, marines, civilians
of many professions, missionaries and
brewers were among them. Now that the
liquor business is being driven from civil-
ized countries it is moving its habitat and
consorting with that part of humanity not
yet enlightened enough to protect them-
selves from it. We found Mr. R. D. Good-
rich waiting for us on the "Bund" as the
wharves are called on this side. He piloted
us to a hotel and told us that Mr. Ripley's
instructions were to await orders. So we
waited for about a week, taking in some of
the sights, sounds and (by no means least)
the smells. I would not select an oriental
seaport as the ideal place in which to rear
a family.
The foreigners who reside in these places
do not always do the country of their origin
credit and the missionary has his hands
full combatting the influence of this sort of
people. I think a more wholesome influence
is gradually creeping in, and will grow
stronger as thetime passes.
In a few days a letter from Mr. Ripley
said we were to report in Tientsin and
should make the trip by coastwise steamer
as the bandits had cut the railway. So we
engaged passage on an English boat and
were afloat four days, touching in the night
at Wei-hai-wei and in the day time at Che-
foo. At this latter place we ment ashore
for a few hours and took occasion to buy
some of the Pongee silk for the manufac-
ture of which this place is famous.
We reached Tienstin on Oct. 2nd and
found Mr. Ripley awaiting us. From that
time until Nov. 16th we spent the time
struggling to complete our preparations for
field work. A study was made of the work
which has been done and equipment and
apparatus put in order. It was slow and
discouraging work. The Chinese,—"Maybe
tomorrow,"' has the Spanish "manana"
beaten to a frazzle.
At last Party No. I, which is my party
left for Teh Chon to begin field operations.
Our work, proper, begins at Lin Tsing and
extends southerly from there entirely
across the province of Shantung. As no
elevations are available at Lin Tsing I am
hunning a line of precise levels some sixty
miles from the railway at Teh Chon to the
beginning of the work. The elevations are
from sea level at Ching Tao, the former
German concession, and the datum was
determined by the Germans. I am using a
Berger and Sons precise level of the type
used by the U. S. C. &amp; G. Survey and am
having very fair success as far as I am able
to judge. I wish we could have such an
instrument at the LTniversity.
I make two settings of the level for each
position of the rods and thus have a double
line of levels. I take the first sight, at the
second setting, in the forward direction and
figure the results as though I had run two
lines in opposite directions. I have so far


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
been able to keep the two lines from diverg-
ing very far.
Parties No. 2 and No. 3 left Tienstin on
the 20th of November and later passed me
on the way to Lin Tsing where they have
begun their work. I expect to overtake
them in a week or two and from there on
we will be near each other.
The work has been hindered quite a lit-
tle by the bandits, who seem to be an in-
stitution in this country. They seem to be
particularly active at this season of the
Tower over Engineering Arch
year, gathering in their winter supplies and
laying heavy tribute on the defenceless vil-
lages in the various districts. We work al-
ways accompanied by a military escort and
spend the nights only in the larger vil-
lages. I am at present quartered in a small
boat but will have to leave it at Lin Tsing
as there is very little water in the canal
between that place and the Yellow River.
Along that portion of the way we will live
in tents or Chinese inns. After crossing
the Yellow River each of us will have a
house boat fitted up with some degree of
convenience.
I have in my party an American born
Chinese recorder, a graduate of California
and post graduate from Columbia. He of
course speaks English fluently. As a sort
of helper to him I have a Shantung Chinese
who speaks no English whatever. My two
rodmen and instrument bearer are known
as survey coolies and are splendid, intellig-
ent workmen. The other four men who
do anything to help along (carry umbrella,
drive turning pins, carry paint for B. M.'s,
etc.) are just ordinary coolies. They
sometimes show evidence of intelligence
and could no doubt be trained to do a high-
er class of work. I think I was never so
lonesome as during the first week after be-
ginning work and I really am getting
a lot of enjoyment out of the work and all
the daily happenings. When I overtake the
other parties we will have a good time to-
gether.
Remember me very kindly to Mrs. Davis
■ and try to realize how welcome letters from
the "homeside" are over here.
Very truly yours.
H. B. Merrick.
I have been so selfishly absorbed in tell-
ing of myself that I for the moment forgot
to speak of the feeling of thanksgiving and
relief brought to us by the news of the end
of the war. Here's hoping the "talk battle-'
will be short and decisive, so that the world
may rest in peace for a time.
RECONSTRUCTION MEN SENT TO THE
UNIVERSITY BY U. S. GOV-
ERNMENT
Sergt. Harold L. Chandler, formerly of
the Ninth Field battalion, First Division,
U. S. A., enjoys the distinction of being
the first "reconstruction man" sent to the
engineering college by the government for
training. It is expected, however, that oth-
ers will be coming within a short time.
Sergt. Chandler's discharge says, "Dis-
abled in the line of duty." Because of this
handicap the government has considered his
case a "reconstruction one."
The government pays all the expenses of
the wounded or disabled soldier whom it


61
sends to college or to vocational schools for
"reconstruction" training, paying tuition,
buying all books, paying laboratory, fees,
and giving them an allotment each month
for board, room, and other expenses in-
cident to life in a university town.
NEW DIAGONAL WALK
Our alumni readers will be pleased to
learn that the campus of their Alma Mater
is to be made more attractive by the edi-
tion of a new diagonal walk. The new walk
will extend from Waterman gymnasium to
Memorial Hall, crossing the present diagon-
al walk at the flag pole and passing in front
of the new Library.
A* I* r.« £•
Owing to conflicts brought about by the
S. A. T. C. the first meeting of A. I. E. E.
was not held until Tuesday evening, Jan.
28, 1919. Prof. J. C. Parker spoke on "The
Future of the Engineer." Throughout his
talk he dealt with some of the main factors
and problems that the future engineer
would have to consider. He said, in part,
as follows:
"What shall it profit a man to gain the
whole world and lose his own soul? The
world war has shown that power and pres-
tige do not make a nation strong and that
territorial expansion is not national prow-
ess. A conversion has taken place in in-
ternational ideals.
"That which happens to a nation happens
to the individuals of the nation. Men are
thinking more about relative values. The
war has shown the relative value of the
unnaturalized American, the English miner
and the French peasant.
"Men have always worked for financial
gain in order to spend it on personal hap-
piness. What is the use of striving for great-
ness if we lose the power of gaining hap-
piness in doing so? Many men in working
for wealth and fame have destroyed their
capacity for happiness. The Electrical Eng-
ineering profession is not free from them.
"Why do we have engineers? An engi-
neer is an economist. Minimum cost and
maximum production are the essential fact-
ors. The Engineering profession makes
money.
"There is something deeper than econom-
ics in the Engineering profession. There
is a bigger reason than material comfort
for the nation. Engineering makes exist-
ence worth while. The Engineer is an
economist, a technician. An engineering
design that secures utmost economy has lost
its ultimate value to man kind.
"Social organization and natural beauty
does not seem to concern the average engi-
neer. The future engineer must find the re-
lation between nature and the human being.
"Engineering statesmen, artists, and soci-
ologists must be produced. There must be a
human relation between the employer and
employee. The engineer in the future must
promote this relation. He must be the
connecting link between public utilities and
the community served. He must be an
engineering stateman, not a mere technic-
ian." Professor Parker said in- closing,
"To get engineers of this type will solve
very well the question, 'What shall it profit
a man to gain the whole world and lose
his own soul'?"
A. S. M. E. TRIP TO CONKERS CREEK
POWER PLANT
Because of the abnormal conditions
brought about by the war, the University of
Michigan Student branch, American Society
Mechanical Engineers, was not very active
during the last school year. As a result, the
society began the first semester with a mem-
bership of seven.
After the armistice was signed, the S. A.
T. C. disbanded, and the campus had begun
to assume a normal status, it was decided
by the officers of the branch that conditions
were favorable for renewed activities.
The student branch in normal times was
so well known that it was never necessary
to resort to any very extensive membership
campaign, but since the membership is made
up of junior and senior mechanical engin-
eers, and as the present members of these
classes had never seen the branch under
normal conditions, it was necessary to in-
augerate some such campaign. So that the
upper-classmen might become acquainted


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
with the nature of the society, arrangements
were made, through Mr. Cope who is man-
ager of the Ann Arbor branch of the East-
ern Michigan Edison Co., for a trip to De-
troit to visit the Conners Creek power plant
of the Detroit Edison Co. The party was
to consist of the members of the A. S. M.
E., and a number of the faculty and this
seemed quite an incentive for there were
fifty-three names on the membership roll
before the day of the trip arrived and near-
ly every one took this opportunity to visit
the plant.
On Jan. 25, at 6:00 A. M., a special car
left Ann Arbor with the party and arrived
in Detroit at 9:00, Detroit time, so that
there was more than two hours left to in-
spect the plant before time for dinner.
At the plant the party was divided up
into groups of ten each and each group di-
rected by one of the plant's engineers who
acted as guide and general information
bureau. When the students failed to ask
questions the guides explained the various
pieces of apparatus in as much detail as the
time permitted. The inspection started
at the coal yards where the coal is brought
direct from the company's mines and as
fast as it is needed the cars are run in
over the hoppers and dumped. From there
it is conveyed directly to the crusher, then
elevated to the top floor and thence con-
veyed to the various chutes by which it is
conveyed by gravity to the stokers.
Next the boiler room was visited and the
men were shown the control apparatus by
which the steam pressure is regulated.
From there the groups were shown through
the condenser room and had explained to
them the various pumps and measuring de-
vices. Fnially they were taken to the tur-
bine room and from there to the switch
boards from which the power is sent to
all parts of the city.
After they had been shown all that there
was to see and had washed up, they were
conducted to the company's private dining
room where every one got a good meal.
After lunch the party broke up for the aft-
ernoon.
The society had previously made arrange-
ments for tickets to the show "Seventeen"
at the Garrick for all who wanted to go
and judging from the laughter and applause
every one who went enjoyed the show.
This trip is but the first of the events
the A. S. M. E. has planned, and regular
meetings will be held every month the rest
of the school year. A. D. Althouse,
Branch Secretary.
NEW PRIMARY BATTERY INVENTED
Professor Pawlowski of the aeronautical
department is acting in the capacity of con-
sulting engineer to a company now in the
stage of organization. His work is limited
to the mechanical problems connected with
the invention, which is a primary battery
for self-propelling vehicles. The present
battery is designed especially for use in
pleasure cars and has approximately the
same dimensions and weight as the ordi-
nary storage battery.
The electrolyte is maintained in circula-
tion throughout the cells. The circulation
of the electrolyte increases extensively the
current density or amperage per unit area
of the electrodes. Circulation is maintained
by a centrifugal pump driven by a special
electric motor.
Many advantages are claimed for it. The
mileage is doubled. Maintenance of circu-
lation requires only one-fourth horse
power. The battery will stand shocks and
jars, in which capacity it far excels the
storage battery. The upkeep of these bat-
teries is very simple and they do not re-
quire expert service. The inventor, Dr. Ed-
ward Sokol, electro-chemist, claims that in
the future electrolyte may be procured at
garages in exchange for the old electrolyte.
The zinc has to be changed only one-sixth
as often as the electrolyte. The inventor
claims also that its application for electri-
cally propelled cars will solve many difficul-
ties connected with electrification of railr
road terminals. It will not require a change
in the railroad system such as tearing up
track and building of superstructure. As the
old electrolyte will be regenerated electri-
cally and at same process the zinc re-
gained, this new battery is but a method of
buying electricity in the form of an elec-
trolyte.

MICHIGAN ENTERTAINS THE CHAM-
BER OF COMMERCE AT THE
NEW UNION
University of Michigan entertained six
hundred Ann Arbor citizens at the Union
February 26th, 1919, in one of the most
enthusiastic demonstrations ever held in
the interest of the city's welfare.
The new Chamber of Commerce dinner
proved substantially the growing spirit of
unselfish public interests that has been de-
veloping between the city of Ann Arbor
and the University.
"The Michigan Union is mighty glad that
the new Chahmber of Commerce of the
city of Ann Arbor was able to make use
of the Michigan Union for its first big ban-
quet; for it indicates a growing spirit of
fraternity between the campus and the bus-
inehs, professional, and laboring men of the
city," said Homer L. Heath, manager of
the Michigan Union.
"We are glad to have the people of the
city use the Michigan Union building for
such purposes. We feel that we have the
finest club building in the United States
and we want the people of the whole city to
know it, to use it wehenever possible, and
to feel as proud of it as we do for it is
an Ann Arbor as well as a campus insti-
tution."
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING TRIP
About sixty members of Ch.E. I and
Ch.E. 6 classes took advantage of the op-
portunity to visit a few of Detroit's man-
ufacturing plants on Jan. 7, 1919. They in-
spected the following plants: Detroit Steel
Castings Co.; Timken Detroit Axle Co.;
Solvay Coke Ovens, Detroit Iron and Steel
Blast Furnaces; and Detroit Malleable Iron
Works. .
NEW AUTOMOBILE LABORATORY
The automobile laboratory will be moved
in the near future from the mechanical lab-
oratory to larger quarters in the building
formerly occupied by the Signal Corps. A
large portion of the mechanical equipment
of Section B of the S. A. T. C, including
automobile and truck motors will be re-
tained. A new dynamometer will be pur-
chased and used in the testing laboratory.
It is planned that a portion of the building
will be used for tractors and internal com-
bustion engines in general. As a result of
this change in the laboratories M.E. 29 will
be made into a more practical course and
the student will be able to apply text book-
knowledge to a decided advantage.
1919 UNION OPERA
"Come On, Dad" is the title of the 1919
Union Opera. The opera this year gives
much promise of excelling all previous pro-
ductions.
"The unusual scenery, the numerous
lighting effects, the novel colorings in the
costumes should combine with the excellent
book and music of "Come On, Dad" to
make the show outrival any previous pro-
duction of the Mimes of the Michigan Un-
ion," was the statement made by Director
Shuter.

NEW UNION SWIMMING POOL
The swimming pool of the new Union
when completed will far excel any other
pool in the State both in decorations of
the natatorium, and in mechanical appli-
ances for heating and filtering the water.
This pool is 75 feet long, 30 feet wide, and
from 4 to 9 feet deep. The water is stored
in an underground resorvoir outside of the
building, from which it is pumped into the
filters. After Alteration the water is heated
before flowing into the pool. The overflow
of the pool drains back to the resorvior. A
definite amount of water is drained off from
the bottom of the resorvior periodically thus
removing all sediment. The drain from
the condenser of the refrigerating system
replaces this quantity of water. Additional
water may be added from the cistern, which
holds 180,000 gallons. Since all the water
used in the pool would be wasted in ordi-
nary installations, the comparative cost ot
operating it will be very small. All Mich-
igan men will be proud of the new Union
and its swimming pool.
RESEARCH
Automobile Engineering
In the Fall of 1917 a series of re-
search experiments were undertaken by
the automobile department. Owing to the
large amount of data and figures re-
quired to make a single test the results
are not yet in their finished form. Until
the results have been compiled and the
significance of each experiment can be
more thoroughly studied, we must neces-
sarily omit the technical data at this
time of writing. It is hoped that a com-
plete report may be published soon.
One set of tests conducted by Mr. Tay-
lor who was then working for his M.S.
degree was to determine the relation be-
tween fuel economy and power output in
a modern automobile motor. Trials were
made on the test block with various throttle
and needle-valve settings and the resulting
horsepower and fuel consumption curves
were then plotted. In general the results
would prove the following statements:
The most economical setting of the car-
buretor does not develop maximum horse-
power or torque. It was found that the lean
mixtures give the best economy. Of con-
siderable interest is the fact that these
"lean" gasoline air mixtures contained ap-
proximately the theoretical proportions of
hydrogen carbon and oxygen for complete
combustion. In other words, the fuel con-
sumption was the least when the air gaso-
line proportions were in accordance with
the following equations:
2H,+0,=2H0
C-r-02=CO,
It is somewhat surprising to notice that
the richer mixtures (more gasoline in pro-
portion to air) resulted in material increase
in power. This might possibly be explained
by the richer mixtures possessing a greater
rate of flame propagation. That is to say:
the explosive charge, when ignited, burns
more rapidly, thus increasing the tempera-
ture and therefore the pressure.
It is unfortunate that the carburetor ad-
justment which gives greatest economy does
not allow the greatest power output. It is
therefore up to each individual owner
which one he will sacrifice. In these days


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
of high gasoline costs, it would seem that
economy is of more value than great accele-
ration.
Another run of tests which have been
conducted and which are not yet entirely
finished is the determination of various
temperatures of the incoming gases on fuel
consumption and power. Such a test is a
timely one when there is so much idle con-
jecture among automotive engineers on the
question of hot-spot, water, and exhaust-
weight 2B four cylinder truck motor. The
latter is still undergoing test.
In the first tests the intake air was heated
and maintained at various temperatures, the
resulting horsepower torque and economy
curves being carefully recorded. Thermo-
couples were employed to show just what
temperatures there were at various points
in the manifold.
The truck motor is fitted with the hotspot
manifold and when the figures are ready
Union Swimming Pool
jacketed intake manifolds. Some claim that
water jacketing is sufficient if used in con-
nection with a hot air stove; while others
maintain that water-jacketing is wholly in-
adequate and that the logical and success-
ful method of accommodating modern low-
grade gasolines is the adoption of a hot-
spot manifold.
Three engines have been used in making
the tests. A standard light-weight four cy-
linder passenger car engine was first em-
ployed, being followed by a G. M. C. Amer-
ican ambulance motor and lastly a heavy
they will be carefully compared to the re-
sults of the first two tests.
Although the technical data as stated be-
fore is necessarily omitted the general in-
dication of the experiment is that as the in-
duction temperature is increased there is a
corresponding increase in power and effi-
ciency up to a certain point. After this point
is reached any increase in temperature low-
ers the output.
The results of these tests when completed
will be of much value in establishing facts
relative to preheated intake systems.

MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
Article on Chronograph in May Issue
In the May Issue of the Michigan Tech-
nic will be published an article on the
Chronograph by W. E. Lay of the Mechan-
ical Engineering department. The chrono-
graph is used by the American Society of
Automobile Engineers for testing the ac-
celeration of a car. At the present time ex-
periments are being conducted with a new
but similar piece of apparatus and far su-
perior to that made by the department a
year ago. This article will be of excep-
tional interest to anyone who drives an au-
tomobile.
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
In the Evaporator Laboratory the work
of last summer has been continued and ex-
panded. The work then begun was on the
relation between the level of liquid being
evaporated and the rate of heat transmis-
sion. It was shown that the maximum rate
of evaporation occurred when the tubes
were about a third submerged. This work
has been confirmed and extended to other
types of heating surfaces with the same
general result.
In one of the new plants for the fixation
of nitrogen established by the government
during the war, a step in the process was
to remove carbon monoxide from the nitro-
gen by washing with hot caustic soda under
pressure. The reaction results in the for-
mation of sodium formate, which has a
market value as a source of formic acid.
Through Lt.-Col. Ware, Superintendent of
the plant, formerly professor of Chemical
Engineering, the problem of the disposal of
the waste wash liquor and the recovery of
sodium formate was referred to the evap-
orator laboratory. The liquor arrived so
late that only preliminary work has been
done. The laboratory work is being done
by W. F. Zingg, W. H. Dow and C. L.
Anger.
In discussing heat transmission, it is al-
ways assumed that flow of heat is propor-
tional to temperature drop. In certain cases
in evaporating it has seemed that this was
not strictly true, but the recorded experi-
ments are contradictory. Zingg, Dow and
Anger have also worked on this point and
have definitely shown that at higher tem-
perature drops the rate of heat transmis-
sion is relatively greater than at low tem-
perature drops. This is because the higher
temperature drop puts more heat through
the surface per unit area and the more
violent boiling so caused creates a stronger
circulation. It is well known that the more
violent the circulation, other things being
equal, the more rapid the evaporation.
In the manufacture of paper pulp from
spruce wood there can be recovered from
the waste liquor a material known as spruce
turpentine. It is not a true turpentine, and
its principal constituent is a substance
known as cymene. During the war this be-
came important, as cymene can be con-
verted into toluene and toluene is the basis
for TNT. The department has on hand a
considerable amount of cymene obtained
when the problem of toluene production
was serious. The call for toluene having
lessened, Prof. Brier is trying to make from
cymene some substances useful in the dye
industry. J. C. Geniesse is doing the experi-
mental work. The problem is obscure and
difficult and progress is necessarily slow.
In casting aluminum, a serious difficulty
is met with, due to the fact that aluminum
oxide is so nearly the same specific gravity
as the metal that it does not separate from
the fluid metal in the mold. Consequently
the oftener aluminum is remelted the
poorer it is. Aluminum scrap is very dif-
ficult to remelt because of the large surface
exposed for oxidation. Prof. Laird and F.
E. Steinbach are attempting to remove the
oxide from the fluid metal by electrolysis
and are apparently getting useful results.
In the Liberty Motor the working parts
are at very high temperatures. A number
of failures in the aluminum pistons are
ascribed to a decrease in the tensile strength
of aluminum as the temperature rises. Prof.
Smart was commissioned by the War De-
partment to investigate this, and C. Zylstra
and A. H. Robinson are working on it. They
have built a small electric heater that will
go between the jaws of the testing machine


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
so that aluminum test bars can be broken
at any desired temperature. Not enough re-
sults have yet been obtained to warrant
conclusions.
Another problem Prof. Smart came in
contact with during the inspection of ma-
terials for the Liberty Motor was bronze
for bushings. The specifications called for
a certain hardness, a certain tensile strength
and a certain elongation. Hardness and
strength were easily met, but it was diffi-
cult to get sufficient elongation to pass the
specifications. Miss Hindshaw and Miss
Bristol, who were taking the special course
for Ordnance Inspection for women, are
working on this. They are making a study
of different rates of cooling of the bronze
as to their effect on microstructure and
physical properties, especially the elonga-
tion.
Many new alloy steels are developing,
and all their properties are not fully
worked out. It is not always easy to de-
termine the tensile strength of any lot of
material, for sometimes it may be in such
a form that it is undesirable to destroy
some to get a test piece. The hardness, as
determined by the Brinnell method, is eas-
ily and quickly determined without destroy-
ing the test piece. If its relation to other
properties were well known for each steel,
it would be a more useful method for rou-
tine control. Mr. Zimmerli and W. H.
Graves are working on this relation for cer-
tain alloy steels.
Mr. Wendler is investigating a type of
bomb calorimeter used in the Chemical En-
gineering Laboratory. The usual calorime-
ter is lined with gold or enamel to resist
the action of certain acids formed during
the explosion. These bombs are very ex-
pensive—too expensive for student use. To
avoid this there has been developed in this
laboratory a calorimeter made of monel
metal (a nickel-copper alloy) which only
costs one-sixth as much as the lined bombs
and which has given very satisfactory re-
sults in students' hands for three years. Mr.
Wendler is making a careful comparison of
this with a gold-lined bomb to see just how
great the errors in the monel bomb may be.
PHYSICS DEPARTMENT
Research in Macnetism
An investigation in magnetism has been
undertaken to determine whether it is cor-
rect to assume that the magnetization
curves plotted from results obtained by dif-
ferent methods are the same, and, if not,
what is the relationship between the vari-
ous curves. The methods involved are, (i)
the step by step method, starting with the
iron demagnetised, and the method of tak-
ing the locus of tips of symmetrical hystere-
sis loops of diminishing amplitudes, and
(2) the method of obtaining one branch of
an unsymmetrical hysteresis loop that
passes through the point (B=0, H=0).
Differences have been found and the tests,
while incomplete, indicate that the methods
of (1) produce the same curve, but the va-
rious curves obtained by (2) agree with
the other only in two points each, although
the general shapes are similar.

MARINE ENGINEERING
Work in the Naval Tank
During the past year a great deal of ex-
perimental work has been accomplished in
the naval tank, part at least being work for
the government. A series of experiments
were conducted for the U. S. Shipping-
Board, in an effort to determine the most
desirable form of ships body for the trans-
port service. From a parent set of lines,
six variations of after body were used. The
same model was used each time, and, being
made of wax, modifications of form could
be easily made. Efforts are constantly be-
ing made to obtain ships forms which have
less resistance, and also lend themselves to
greater ease of construction, and experi-
ments are at this time still being con-
ducted with this end in view.


D. W. HUNTER, 71, Editor
TECHNIC STAFF MAN DOES IMPORT-
ANT WORK
Claude M. Burns, of the civil engineering
class of 1917, and 1916 Editor of the Tech-
nic, is now stationed at Bordeaux, France.
He holds the rank of Second Lieutenant in
the Sanitary Corps. His work consists of
the examination of sources and all water
supplies used by the American troops in
the 40.000 square mile section of France.
Burns went overseas with Co. M of the
23rd Engineers and was soon promoted to
the rank of corporal. He was stationed at
various places in France and was recently
assigned to Base Section No. 2, laboratory
at Bordeaux.
A MICHIGAN TECHNIC MAN IN
FRANCE
Donald A. Thomas, who was a member
of the Technic staff during the year of
1916, is engaged at present with the A. E. F.
in France in work which, strangely enough
grew out of his interest in technical jour-
nalism. When war was declared by the
United States, Thomas was in the High-
way Department at Lansing, where he was
employed in the preparation of the bien-
nial reports and of the numerous bulletins
of the department. He had also inciden-
tally become a frequent contributer to the
Engineering News-Record and to a number
of other Engineering journals. As soon as
the United States entered the war, Thomas
resigned his position and enlisted in the six-
teenth Regiment of Engineers. This regi-
ment was engaged for practically the en-
tire first year of the war in the construc-
tion of a vast supply depot. When in June,
1918, their work was done and they were
moved, Thomas was removed on detached
service, since the work he had done had
made him indispensible in the office where
he had worked.
In October he was ordered to report to
the Commanding officer of the Chief Engi-
neer's Office at Tours for an interview with
the Historical Section. When he arrived
in Tuors, quite in the dark as to the rea-
son for his summons he found the Com-
manding Officer to be W. P. Wickham,
1916E, one of his own classmates who was
a second lieutenant. He also found a cap-
tain and a first lieutenant from Michigan in
the Historical Office, and in charge, R. K.
Tomlin, formerly managing editor of the
Engineering News-Record. Knowing that
Thomas was also in France, he had had him
called to assist in the work of the new de-
partment.
This department, which had been re-
named the Technical Information Section,
was charged with the compilation of the
whole historical and technical record of en-
gineering operations of the A. E. F., as well
as the preparation of technical papers on
live topics. This indicated the record of
the marvelous construction work from the
by ports to the depots and stations at the
front as well as the story of the combatant
engineers.
In November, just before the armistice
was signed, Thomas was commissioned 2nd
Lieutenant. He is now busy in the prepa-
ration of a book on the S. O. S.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
TECHNIC EDITOR IN CHARGE OF
TROOP WATER SUPPLY
TRAIN
Robert L. McNamee, '17, managing editor
of the 1916 Technic, is a lieutenant in the
Sanitary Corps, being in charge of the 302nd
Water Tank Train. Enlisting in February,
1918, he was sent to Washington, D. C,
where he attended an army medical school
for several months and later was assign-
ed to special work at Camden, N. J., Phil-
adelphia, and Baltimore. He received his
commission in September and shortly aft-
erwards went overseas.
The nature of his work consists in the
operation of water purification laboratories
mounted on trucks, by which the water used
by the army is chemically treated, thus
rendering it fit for drinking purposes.
LIEUT. EDWARD HEADMAN
Lieut. Edward Headman, son of James
Headman, 13s Chestnut St., Wyandotte,
was the first employe of the city of De-
troit to give his life in the service of his
country. He was connected with the sani-
tary department of the board of health. He
was attached to the 302 regiment of engi-
neers and sailed for France July, 1917. He
was a member of the class of 1916.

WELL-KNOWN ALUMNI DIES
Oliver W. Hall, of the class of 1914, died
on the night of January 13 at Camp Rari-
tan, New Jersey. He had volunteered in
the Motor Instruction Department of Camp
Raritan and had been there but a short
while when he was suddenly stricken with
Spanish influenza, of which he died.
The Michigan Technic feels the loss of
such a man probably more than any of the
organizations "Ollie" was connected with
while at college. He came into control of
the Technic at a time when it was, speak-
ing frankly, down and out. Under the guid-
ance of "Ollie" as Managing Editor, and
"Pete" Thompson as Business Manager, it
rapidly assumed its old place as one of
Michigan's best publications. Too much
credit cannot be given him for the work he
did on the paper. He was known through
his university life here as a hard worker,
a good student, and one of the best of fel-
lows. Michigan will keenly feel his loss.

EVAPORATORS
W. L. BADGER, PROFESSOR OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
Historical
While many operations still involve evaporation in open vessels at
atmospheric pressure, most of our modern processes involve evaporation in
a vacuum or in multiple effect. The first use of a vacuum to increase the
rate of evaporation is generally attributed to Howard, an Englishman, who
patented the process in 1812 and built the first vacuum pan in an English
sugar refinery. | His process involved all the essentials of vacuum evapora-
tion as we know it today—he condensed the vapors coming off the pan by the
use of a jet of cold water, and maintained the vacuum by a pump.
During the 30's it was recognized that if a vessel were boiling at a
pressure above atmospheric, the steam so produced might be led into coils
in a second open vessel and re-used. This was patented by Pecquer in 1834
and again in 1849, but his devices were very unsuccessful because of me-
chanical difficulties and faulty design. In 1845 Norbert Rillieux, an Amer-
ican, built the first practical multiple effect evaporator. He had a boiler,
much like a locomotive boiler, but heated it by passing exhaust steam from
an engine through the tubes. The steam formed in this first effect was then
passed into the the heating tubes of the second effect, and the second effect
was connected to a condenser and vacuum pump. Whatever credit belongs
to Pecquer for the discovery of the principle of multiple effect evaporation,
Rillieux was the first to make it practical and his name is usually linked with
the introduction of the multiple effect evaporator. In 1879 Rillieux's eva-
porator was modified by the introduction of the Wellner-Jelinek type, which
is practically the form in which today we know the class of evaporators hav-
ing horizontal heating tubes.
In 1851 Robert, the superintendent of a German beet-sugar factory,
built a new type of evaporator which still exists in almost its original form
as the standard or vertical tube evaporator. And during the 8o's the Lillie
and Yaryan appeared, which began the third class known as film evaporators.
Horizontal Tubs Evaporators
Rillieux's original evaporator is now of no significance; but its successor,
the Wellner-Jelinek, is widely used. Figs. 1 and 2 are copies of the drawings
of the original patent specifications; but except for the German valves and
fittings, might be drawings of evaporators now working. The body is rec-
tangular in plan, and has a steam chest at each end. From one steam chest
to the other run a number of tubes, about ?4" in diameter, held in tube
sheets at either end. Steam enters by the valves / at the ports indicated by
the large black circles at the right end of the plan in fig. 1. There are par-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
titions in the steam chest so that the steam passes down only the first bundle
of tubes. In the far steam chest it has access to the second bundle of tubes
on each side of the center, and finally passes back through the outer bundle
Each bundle of tubes has less tubes than the one preceding it, so that the
velocity of the steam is kept up in spite of its partial condensation. Con-
densed water is removed from the bottom of each compartment of each
steam chest—by valves n on the rear chest and by valves not shown on the
front steam chest. The liquid to be evaporated enters at i and leaves at k.
G is the return from the foam catcher, g is a wash water line, h is the vent for
for non-condensible gases, e is a guage glass, and m is a valve for high-press-
sure steam in case the exhaust furnished by I is insufficient.
A drawing of a large quadruple effect in a modern American beet sugar
factory is shown in Fig. 3. The liquor line runs back of the steel beam sup-
porting the evaporators and is not easily seen in the drawing. Non-condensed

gases are tapped of the top of each steam chest at two places and returned to
the vapor space of the same body. (It is customary to call the material used
for heating "steam" and that formed by evaporation "vapor;" though there is
no difference between them except temperature and pressure. The "vapor"
of one effect is the "steam" of the next effect). Condensed water is drawn
from each steam chest to receivers, one for each effect; and passes from re-
ceiver to receiver by the drop in pressure between succeeding effects, being
drawn from the last one by a pump. The three upright cylinders at the left
of the drawing are preheaters for the liquid (exactly the same as a surface
condenser). The vapor from the fourth effect goes to two, and the third
is heated by vapor diverted from the vapor space of the first effect. Later
we shall see the great economy to be reached by such means. Steam so di-

verted is called "extra steam." From the juice heaters the uncondensed re-
mainder of vapor from the fourth effect goes to a condenser, the fittings of
which are not shown. Fig. 4 is a photograph of a very similar evaporator
with the covers of the steam chests removed. It shows very clearly the par-
titions which force the steam to traverse the tubes in series instead of all in
parallel. The small pipe line running across the upper part of the bodies is
the non-condensed gas line, going to the condenser in this case.
The Wellner-Jelinek has not been very popular in Europe, but is very
common in this country. Many firms who supply complete plants build
evaporators of the Wellner-Jelinek type, without making a specialty of them.
A few firms make a particular business of these evaporators and their types
are well known.
The Swenson evaporator, shown in Figs. 5 and 6, is a very well-known
type . It differs from the typical Wellner-Jelinek only in being simpler, The

steam is put through all the tubes in parallel. The liquor enters on one side
near the bottom and leaves on the opposite side.
Fig. 6 shows the method generally used in securing the tubes in a hori-
zontal tube evaporator. It is shown more clearly in Fig. 7, which shows
only four tubes secured by each plate, while there are eight to a plate in Fig.

6. The tube sheet is fairly thick, and the holes for the tubes are a little
large and counter-sunk. The tubes are long enough to project through the
tube sheets, and are provided with conical gaskets of rubber or asbestos. In
the center of each group which is to be the unit (4, 6, or 8 tubes) is a stud.
Over this is placed a packing plate, so shaped as to draw up on the gaskets as
the nut on the stud is tightened. This arrangement is used by all makers of
horizontal tube evaporators.
Another well-known make is the Zaremba. This is characterised by the
cylindrical body, as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 9 shows a triple effect in which all
the connections are very clear.

The general feature of the horizontal tube evaporator is that it empha-
sizes the value of keeping the steam velocity high. Applying the rest of
Claassen's principles, we see that the liquor velocity will be low, the drainage
of condensate will be slow, but the effect of depth of liquor will be small.
Venting the non-condensed gases is good, as the steam velocity is high enough
to sweep them to the far steam chest. From a construction point of view,
the great advantage of this type is the ease with which the tubes may be re-
newed; and its great disadvantage the difficulty of removing scale. If the
tubes scale up much they cannot be gotten through the holes in the tube
sheet; and in any case chipping scale off the outside of a tube is slow and
costly. Hence the horizontal tube evaporator is generally used where scale
is not expected.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Vertical Tote Evaporators
The "Standard"' or Robert evaporator has changed very little since its
invention. Fig. 10 shows a diagrammatic view of this type. A-A and B-B
are tube sheets. Between them are expanded a large number of rather wide
tubes (generally 2 or 2^2" in diameter) from 3 to 6 feet long. In the cen-
ter is left a large downtake space, C. Steam, introduced at D, surrounds the
tubes. Condensed water is drawn off the lower tube sheet either through the
side of the evaporator or through the bottom. The liquid to be evaporated is
usually carried about level with the top tubesheet. As it boils in the tubes,
the bubbles of staem carry liquid up with them, and this liquid returns
through the central downtake. Thus the circulation is very vigorous.

This evaporator, like the Wellner-Jelinek, is the property of no one in
particular, but is built by many firms. A typical example is shown in Fig. 11.
In the elevation, only two tubes are shown—one just adjacent to the steam
belt, and or.e near the downtake. In this particular evaporator a steam belt,
into which the steam is delivered, surrounds the machine. This side of the
sfeam belt next the tubes is covered with plates so that the steam leaves the
belt only by spaces left between the plates. The idea is to get a uniform dis-
tribution of steam, but such devices are not often considered necessary. Tn
the elevation the ell on the vapor pipe is shown turned the wrong way, for the
sake of getting the drawing on the standard sheet. This same evaporator is
shown erected in a quadruple effect in Fig. 12. This figure has been drawn
to emphasize the piping, which may be traced in detail.
One of the minor variations on the standard vertical tube evaporator is
shown in Fig. 13. In Ihc first place, instead of the usual large central down-

take there is. a number of small downtakes all over the tube-sheets: and
second, there are baffles in the steam space to increase the steam velocity,
which is usually low in the vertical tube evaporator.
It is understood that the whole tube sheet is filled with small tubes at
each intersection of the 6o° center lines. Only the small tubes outlining the
spaces so filled are shown.
Fig. 14 shows the vertical tube evaporator as built by the Swenson Eva-
porator Co. Here, instead of tube sheets across the whole machine with a
central downtake, the tubes are contained in a central drum and the down-
Fig- 14
take is an annular belt on the outside of the drum. The first effect shows
the construction of the drum, with the steam feed down the center of the
evaporator. Above the tubes is a conical deflector to throw the liquid ejected
from the tubes over to the downtake. The condensed water is taken off the
side of the drum near the bottom, passing through the side of the machine
by a stuffing box. The single evaporator at the right is shown with a hopper
bottom for collecting crystals which may separate during evaporation. All
other evaporators so far shown have been for solutions which do not deposit
crystals during evaporation.
The vertical tube evaporator is almost universal in Europe, and is very
common in this country. It differs from the horizontal tube evaporator (in
the light of Claasen's principles) in having a higher liquid velocity and a
lower steam velocity. Drainage of the condensate is good, the effect of


hydrostatic head may be considerable; and venting may or may not be good.
The steam velocity is so low that there is not the tendency to sweep the non-
condensed gases to one spot. It has the great advantage that the tubes are
easily cleaned, since if scale forms it is on the inside of the tubes, whence it
can be removed by any boiler tube cleaning device. The tubes are not so
easily replaced as in the horizontal type, but in the drum type the whole
drum may be removed without much trouble. This drum, or the combina-
tion of tube sheets and tubes of the standard type, is sometimes called the
"Calandria."
In general, the choice between the two evaporators is largely one of
operating convenience. The horizontal is a little better on heat transmission,
but harrier to clean. Generally the vertical tube type is used where scale is
expected and the horizontal type where none is expected.

III. FUELS.
Almost any kind of fuel, irrespective of impurities or of heat value,
can be utilized in the internal combustion engine today. Fuel gases and
fuel oils form ready mixtures with air and burn without considerable resi-
due. Where gas is not available as a natural product or as the main or
by-product of the industry, it can be economically produced from solid
fuel in a special apparatus called a producer.
A. GASEOUS FUELS
Small and medium-size gas engines are operated by one of the follow-
ing kinds of gas—natural gas, illuminating or city gas, producer gas. Of
these, the last two are artificially made. Large gas engines utilize mostly:
blast furnace gas, coke oven gas, and, sometimes producer gas and natural
gas. The heat values of these gases differ widely, as may be seen from
table No. 2.
a. Natural gas is found in the oil districts of Pennsylvania and West
Virginia. It exists in the earth in pockets and is reached by wells which
are drilled to the pockets. In its natural state it is dry, clean, and highly
inflammable. For this reason it makes an ideal gas engine fuel when it
can be obtained at low cost.
b. City gas is made from bituminous coal by dry distillation. After
impurities, such as tar, have been carefully removed, it makes an excellent
fuel for gas engines up to 50-horsepower.
c. Producer gas can be manufactured from almost any kind of fuel,
such as anthracite coal, bituminous coal, coke, lignite, wood refuse, and
peat. If the engine draws from the gas producer the gas required for its
operation, the gas is called Suction Producer Gas. If air and steam are
blown into the producer, and the gas thus made is under pressure, the latter
is termed Pressure Producer Gas. Suction gas producer plants are leading
by far in the United States and are mostly operated by anthracite. Their
size rarely exceeds 200 horse-power. The suction producer gas is cheaper
than city gas, but on the other hand contains impurities which are liable
to cause trouble in the operation of the plant. In Fig. 47 the construction
of a suction producer plant is illustrated.

Air is drawn in through the generator, I, filled with fuel, 3, the lower
position of which is incandescent over the grates, 2. Water passes through
the pipe, 4, into the evaporating pan, 5, surrounding the generator. This
water is vaporised by the heat of the burning coal, 3. The steam thus
formed passes down through pipe, 6, and together with air enters the gen-
erator through the grate, rising through the fuel and producing gas. The
warm gas escapes through pipes, 7 and 8, into the lower part of scrubber,
10. Some of the impurities drop into the water trap, 9. Others are absorbed
by the porous and bulky coke, II, with which the scrubber is filled. A water

spray entering at the top of the scrubber cools and purines the rising gas.
From a pipe, 12, the cooled gas passes through a tar separator, 13, into a
small gas tank,-16, from which the gas is drawn by the engine as required.
In starting, the hand-operated blower is used for furnishing an air blast.
During that period, the gas is directed by means of valve, 19, through the
test-pipe, 18, into the atmosphere. After having reached the proper quality,
the gas is directed to the scrubber by turning the valve, 19, into the position
shown.
Pressure producer gas plants range from 200 to 2,000 horse-power.
Mostly bituminous coal or lignite is used as fuel. The cleaning apparatus of
such a plant must be more efficient than in the suction producer gas plant.

In larger plants it is very economical to install a by-product plant for the
treatment of the tar from which Sulphate of Ammonia and other products
are obtained, thus helping to lower the cost of operation. Fig. 48 illustrates
a typical pressure producer gas plant.
Pressure Producer Gas Plant
Steam is produced in a separate boiler, 19, from which it passes through
pipe 6 into pipe 5, where it is mixed with air, previously heated in tank, iB.
Steam and air together enter the generator, 1, through gate, 2. Rising
through the incandescent fuel, 3, they form gas, which is forced through
pipes 7 and 8 into the scrubber, 10, filled with coke. Cold water is sprayed
over the coke, cooling and purifying the rising gas. Through pipe, 12, the
gas passes first the tar separator, 13, then the drying filter, 14. filled with
sawdust, and finally enters, after having gone through a second tar sepa-
rator, 15, the gas tank, from which it flows, under slight pressure, to the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
engine. In case of a lignite plant, a steam boiler is not necessary, as the
lignite contains sufficient moisture.
d. Blast Furnace Gas. A blast furnace is, with regard to the produc-
tion of gas, a huge pressure gas producer. The gas coming from the blast
furnace contains a great quantity of impurities, such as lime dust, soot,
iron oxide, and sulphur. The quantity of impurities varies from 12 to 25
grams per cubic meter of gas, which must be reduced to .01 to .03 grams
per cubic meter of gas, as a greater amount will cause deposits in cylinder,
excessive wear of the moving parts, and danger to the engine. A blast
furnace gas cleaning plant is illustrated in Fig. 49.
Blast Furnace Gas Cleaning Plant
After leaving the dust trap, 1, the gas passes through the pipe, 2, to
a larger dust catcher, 3, continuing through pipe, 4, to the scrubber, 5. A
cold water spray entering at the top of the scrubber cools and purifies the
rising gas, which passes out at the top, then down in pipe, 6, leading it into
a rotary washing plant, 7, which removes nearly all the solid impurities.
From the cleaning plant the gas is conveyed through large gas mains, 8, to
the engine.
e. Coke Oven Gas is produced from bituminous coal during the pro-
duction of coke. A portion of the gas is used in the coke oven, but the
remainder or surplus gas can be used for operating gas engines. This
gas contains coke dust, tar and sulphur, and consequently must be purified
in a way similar to the one outlined above for the pressure producer plant.
1$. LIQUID FUELS AND THEIR ATOMISATION METHODS
The liquid fuels commonly used today are: Gasoline, Kerosene, Crude
Oil, Benzol, Alcohol, and Tar Oil. The first two are distillates of crude
oil, which is a native, generally liquid, combination of various hydrocarbons
and as such usually consists of 80 to 85 per cent carbon and 15 to 20 per
cent hydrogen. There is also a small percentage of impurities. Location
and geologic age have an influence on the relative proportions of the con-
stituents, as may be seen from the following analyses:

Crude oil is a mixture of several kinds of oil of different boiling points.
These oils can be, by fractional distillation, separated into three main
groups, namely: Volatile oils, 10 per cent; illuminating oil. 80 per cent; and
heavy oils. The first group contains, besides other oils, gasoline with a
boiling point 1600 to 2000 F. and a specific gravity from .65 to .70. It is
gasoline on which Otto engines, especially of the high speed automotive
type, operate so successfully. With the number of automobiles rapidly

increasing, the time fs not far when the critical point in the production of
gasoline will be reached. Many attempts have been made to utilize the
kerosene oils of the illuminating gas group, with a boiling point of about
3000 F. and more and a specific gravity of .78 to .86, in the Otto engine.
At slow speeds fair results have been achieved, while at high speeds kero-
sene has not yet proven to be satisfactory. It is right here where we can
get a true conception of the immense value of the Diesel engine, which not
only can burn volatile oils, but kerosene, heavy oils, residium oils, crude

oil, and tar oil; in short, any kind of liquid fuel; and this with an efficiency
which is high above that of any other type of heat engine.
For best economy of the fuel—i. e., for its quick and complete com-
bustion—it is absolutely necessary to surround each of its particles with a
sufficient number of air particles. In engines operating on gaseous fuels
this may be accomplished by adjusting the air throttle and gas throttle
valves for the proper gas-air ratio and by directing the gas and air streams
in such way that they hit each other at a right angle, thus assuring a thor-
ough mixing of the gas with the air. This is illustrated in Fig. 50. To
accomplish the same aim with liquid fuel, the latter must be first atomized,
assuring a more thorough amalgamation of the oil and air particles. Al-


95
though almost any device which permits a current of air to pass over or
through a volatile oil will serve the purpose, modern gasoline-air mixing
devices, termed carburetors, are called upon to deliver a mixture to the
cylinders that is not only of accurate proportion but also of proper com-
position at all engine speeds. The details of the modern carburetors differ
largely, yet the underlying principle is mostly still that of the pioneer "spray-
jet" automatic float feed carburetor evolved by Maybach about 35 years
ago. A single spray-jet, automatic float feed carburetor, as used by the
Packard Motor Car Company of Detroit, is illustrated in Fig. 51. Gaso-
line flows into the float chamber through a needle valve. A constant height
of the gasoline in the spray-nozzle connected with the float chamber is auto-
Heed/g-
(J&amp;iQina/
matically maintained by the float. The suction created by the pistons causes
air to enter the mixing chamber through the primary and auxiliary air
inlets. In passing through the venturi tube the primary air assumes a
speed of more than 7,000 feet per minute. It consequently draws gasoline
from the spray-nozzle and atomizes it. The proper gasoline-air mixture,
at all engine speeds, is maintained by the auxiliary air valve, the lift of
which increases with the vacuum in the mixing chamber or with the speed
of the engine. Many attempts have been made to atomize kerosene by the
methods described above, but they failed entirely in high speed engines.
In small, slow speed, stationary engines kerosene can be used with a fair
degree of success. The chief difficulty which prevents the substitution of
gasoline by kerosene is the fact that the latter does not vaporize readily
at ordinary temperatures. This calls for special vaporizing devices, such
as hot bulbs, see Fig. 8. In hot bulb engines the kerosene is sprayed, by
means of a small oil pump, into the red-hot bulb, where, due to the high
temperature, it vaporizes and mixes with the air forced into the bulb during


the compression stroke of the engine. Crude oil, the fuel of the Diesel
engine, requires for its atomization three essential auxiliaries: the fuel
pump, the fuel needle, and the air compressor. The most important one
of the three is the fuel needle, an illustration of which is shown in Fig. 52.
The fuel pump forces the oil under high pressure through the oil canal
into the distribution chamber surrounding the needle and filled with a num-
ber of annular, perforated plates. Nearly at the end of the compression
stroke the needle is slightly lifted, and the highly compressed air, furnished
by an air compressor through the air canal, forces the oil through the spray
nozzle at a very high speed into the combustion chamber, where a thor-
ough mixing of the oil and air particles takes place. Hence the needle
valve has two main functions: the distribution and the atomization of the
oil. In countries where gasoline and even crude oil are at a premium,
benzol, alcohol and tar oil have come into extensive use. Benzol, a by-
product in the manufacture of illuminating gas and coke, is in its crude
form a foul-smelling liquid. After the refining process it has a color similar
to that of water and can be atomized and burnt in the same way as gasoline.
Its slow flame propagation, however, lowers the flexibility of the engine.
Its carbon content is about 90 per cent, specific gravity equals .886, and its
heating value 17,000 B. T. U. per pound. To prevent carbon deposits in
the cylinder and freezing of the oil at a temperature below 320 F., it must
be mixed with alcohol.
Alcohol is produced by fermentation of grape sugar, or the latter's
raw material, like potatoes or grain. Water-free alcohol has a boiling point
of 1720 F., a specific gravity of .79, and a heating value of about 12,000
B. T. U. per pound. It can be atomized like gasoline, and is used in slow
speed, small, stationary engines only.
Since German engineers have succeeded in the design and manufacture
of a heavy type, horizontal tandem, double-acting Diesel engine, a new
fuel has entered the market, the tar oil. Of what importance this fuel
is may be seen from the fact that Germany alone uses more than 500,000
tons a year in stationary engines. Tar oil is, like benzol, a by-product in
the manufacture of coke and gas. Its boiling point'is about 6oo° F., its
specific gravity about 1.05, and its heating value about 17,000 B. T. U. per
pound. All parts of the engine coming in contact with this fuel, like fuel
pump and spray needle valve, must be made of special material, as ordi-
nary steel will be easily destroyed by it. To increase its flame propagation,
ignition oil is sometimes used.
IV. HISTORICAL AND MODERN INTERNAL COMBUSTION
ENGINES
The history of the internal combustion engine falls into two periods:
(1) The period of invention and speculation, 1678-1860; and (2) the period
of development and application, i860 to date.
As early as 1678, Hautefeuille advanced the idea of the vacuum gun-
powder pump. Through the explosion of gun-powder in a closed chamber
provided with valves, and the subsequent cooling of the gases of combus-


97
tion, a vacuum is created which is used for the drawing of water. In 1680
the same principle was applied by Huyghens in his vacuum gun-powder
engine, in which atmospheric pressure was used for the operation of a
piston. Such an engine was constructed and actually tested by Papin in
1688. For slightly more than a hundred years nothing was done, at least
no records are available showing the contrary. The invention and suc-
cessful application of illuminating gas toward the end of the eighteenth
century seemed to have stimulated the interest of inventors in the internal
combustion engine field again. John Barber took out a patent on a gas tur-
Fig. 54
bine in 1791. Gases produced from solid or liquid fuels and mixed in a
special chamber with air and a little water are ignited, and the resulting
impulse is to be utilized for the operation of a turbine wheel. In 1794
Robert Street invented the oil engine. Liquid fuel is evaporated in a cyl-
inder and mixed with air taken in during the first half of the stroke. The
mixture is ignited by a continuously burning ignition flame at the middle
of the stroke and the piston is driven outward by the gases. From 1800
to i860 many inventions along the internal combustion engine line have
been made, the most important of which are: the double-acting illuminating
gas engine of Lebon, 1801 ; the double-acting explosion engine of Wright,
1833; the explosion engine with compression of Barnett, 1838; the hot


tube engine of Drake, 1842, exhibited in Philadelphia in 1847, :ir,d having an
output of 20 horse-power at 60 R. P. M., and 103 pounds per square inch
explosion pressure; the hydrogen gas engine of Reithmann, 1852, actually
in operation in Munich until 1858; the atmospheric free piston engine of
Barsanti and Matteucci, 1854; the gas engine with compression of Degrand,
1858.
Since i860 the development of this type of prime mover was so rapid
and its application so broad that it is impossible to mention here even the
names of all the men who devoted their lifetime to this problem. Only
the foremost ones can be considered. In order to give a better survey of
this second period, the different engines are taken up in groups. Thus
we have:

gen as proposed by Herskine-Harzard, and one probably would recognize
Talbot's splendid ideas in the slide valve as used by Lenoir. But the Lenoir
engine draws in gas and air itself without previous mixing and that consti-
tutes its patent claims." Lenoir's original engine was modeled after the
standard steam engine, had a 3" bore, 5" stroke and a speed of 100 R. P. M.
It was without waterjacket, had a continuously sparking ignition plug,
located in the middle of the cylinder and laid bare by the piston, thus ignit-
ing the mixture in the front and back end alternately and giving off power
during the second half of the stroke only. Its fuel consumption was high,
and its overall efficiency from 3% to 4%.

Otto and Langen Free Piston Engine. Among the most zealous of
those who tried to improve the gas engine, was a young merchant, N. H.
Otto, of Koln. Through experiments in 1861 and 1862 he learned that cool-
ing the gases caused a great decrease in volume, and consequently a partial
vacuum. Otto endeavored to use this for the generation of power. After
many, tedious, experiments, he and his partner, E. Langen, to whom we owe
the systematic development of this engine, succeeded in perfecting an engine,
as shown in Fig. 54. The most striking feature of this engine is the use of
a free piston connected with the flywheel shaft, a, by means of rack, i, and
pinion, o, which runs freely on the shaft while the piston is on its upward
stroke, but by an ingenious clutch arrangement it grips the shaft on the down
stroke. • T;he valve, e, by one in- and out-stroke causes the exhaust, intake
and explosion in the order named. It is moved by rod, d, connected to

f and g lift the piston and the charge enters through slide valve, e. After
the piston has made a stroke of a few inches, valve, e, carries the ignition
flame to the inlet port causing an explosive combustion of the charge within
the cylinder. The power developed drives the piston upward with a maxi-
mum velocity of over 2,000 feet per minute. Due to over expansion and
cooling of the gases a vacuum is created below the piston and, on the down
stroke of the piston, work is done by the atmosphere and weight of piston

and rack. This free piston engine was exhibited at the Paris exposition in
1867. Even laymen were afraid of the instantaneous ascent of the rack, and
experts criticized severely the awkwardness and noise of the engine. After
a competitive test with fourteen other gas engines, in which it showed an over
all efficiency of 15%, opinions suddenly changed. It completely crushed
Lenoir, and held almost the sole command of the market for ten years, sev-
eral thousands being constructed in that period.

Brayton Engine. This engine is an American product and was intro-
duced by Brayton at the exhibition in Philadelphia in 1878. It is of the
single acting, two cycle type with a working stroke at every revolution. Gas
and air are compressed by a separate pump and then delivered to the motor
cylinder where, on entering, they are gradually ignited by a constantly
burning flame. There is not an explosion but a combustion at constant
pressure. At a certain point the supply of power is cut off and the hot
gases expand to almost atmospheric pressure before discharge. There is a
wire gauze fixed behind the flame, to prevent the flame from striking back
into the charge pipe. If this happens a serious explosion follows, stopping
or wrecking the engine. On this account Brayton abandoned the use of gas
and substituted light oils. Although the danger of explosion was thus re-

moved, new difficulties arose due to the rapid accumulation of soot in the
cylinder which cut the latter. A great number of Brayton engines have
been built by the Ready Motor Company of New York. The over all effi-
ciency of this engine was about 6%.
Otto Engine. Otto's aim was to use the entire stroke for the explosion
and expansion. To obtain this, he built an experimental machine in which
the engine turned forward for the intake; then the valves were closed and
the flywheel turned backward to compress the mixture, which was then
ignited by hand. The effect was surprising. The ignited mixture, on account
some time at high speed. This was more surprising, since, where the eng-
ine was operated without compression, it ran at a low speed. So by these ex-
periments, 1861-1862, Otto arrived at the compression of the charge before
explosion, ignition at the dead-center, and the accomplishment of the charg-
ing, compression, combustion and discharging events in one cylinder — in

short, he came onto the cycle which is the very foundation of the internal
combustion engine development. Great mechanical difficulties, however,
prompted Otto to drop his work on this engine and to devote his time to the
development of the free piston engine described above. Fifteen years later,
in 1877, Otto, again took up the work on the four stroke cycle and suc-
ceeded in perfecting the engine so favorably known throughout the world.
One of the first-new Otto engines is shown in Fig. 55. It is a horizontal, one
cylinder, four stroke cycle gas engine, consisting of cylinder with water
iacket. piston, piston-rod, crosshead, connecting-rod, crankshaft, flywheel,
frame, and timing gears. The cylinder has a clearance space, a, of about
2/3 of the piston displacement. The entrance of the gas and air, as well

as the ignition, is controlled by the slide valve, b, exhaust occurs through the
valve, c, both valves being operated from the half speed shaft, f, by means
of the crank, d, and the cam, e, respectively. The gas valve, g, is operated
by the cam g1. At the beginning of the intake stroke the exhaust valve, c,
is closed, while the slide valve, b, has moved its air channel to communicate
with the channel, i, of the cylinder head. Air alone is drawn in for the
first part of the stroke, which is supposed to force the burnt gases of the
clearance space against the receding piston. In the meantime the valve, 1,
has moved far enough to open the gas inlet, while the cam, g1, has opened
the gas valve, g, so that gas and air enter the cylinder simultaneously at the
end of the stroke. Now the slide, b, closes the port, i, and the charge is com-
pressed into the clearance space by the returning piston. During this time,
b, has moved to the right, and the ignition port, h, is opposite the port, i, so
that the flame is carried through, i, into the clearance space, a. Ignition
occurs on dead center and combustion takes place at almost constant vol-


105
urae. At the end of the expansion stroke the valve, c, is opened and exhaust
occurs during the next stroke. The burnt gases in the combustion chamber
cannot be expelled, but remain and become a part of the next charge. Gov-
erning is by the "hit and miss'' principle. The carrying out of the four
stroke cycle in the Otto Engine is mechanically almost perfect. The over all
efficiency was about 15% in small sized engines increasing with capacity of

HOLZWARTH GAS TURBINE.
The recent, great, success of the steam turbine has aroused not less
interest in the internal combustion turbine again. While from a thermo-
dynamical point of view the problem of the gas turbine is not worse and
not better than that of the reciprocating gas engine, the mechanical aspects


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
offer less encouragement. The combustion of fuel in the gas turbine may
take place at constant volume without or with compression of the charge or
at constant pressure. The only gas turbine, of considerable size, which so
far has yet appeared is that systematically developed by Hans Holzwarth.
It is of the explosion (constant volume), compressed charge type with a
nominal output of thousand horsepower at 3000 revolutions per minute, gas
and air are separately compressed by compressors and forced into a number

of combustion chambers arranged annularly around a vertical shaft, on which
a horizontal turbine wheel is fixed. Each combustion chamber contains gas
and air inlet valves, spark plugs, and nozzle valve. The latter is closed
during the charging period. The explosion pressure forces it open thus
enabling the high tension gases to pass through the ^mall nozzle on the
turbine wheel at high velocity. After having given up their energy to the

by throttling the gas or by cutting out the spark. The over all efficiency is
said to be 4%. This low value is mostly due to the mechanical complication
inherent to this type of internal combustion engine.
Humphrey Gas Pump. During the Brussels exposition in 1910, there
was exhibited a new type of pumping engine, using the work developed
by the explosion of a gas-air mixture for the lifting of water. It is known
as the Humphrey Gas Pump. Since that time this gas pump has gained a
world-wide reputation. It has been introduced into this country, and greatly
improved by American designers. Its operation can best be understood by
reference to Fig. 57. The pump consists of a vertical gas cylinder, A, with

inlet and outlet valves, B and C. These valves interlock with each other.
On the water side of the pump there is a suction pipe, D, a number of suction
valves, S, and a pressure pipe, E, connecting the cylinder with the pressure
tank, F. The water column, G, forms a gas tight piston. To start the
engine, the combustion chamber must be filled with an explosible gas-air
mixture, having the pressure, p„. This mixture is ignited and the pressure,
due to the combustion, suddenly increased to pt While this takes place the
volume will scarcely change so that combustion practically occurs at constant
volume. The water column, owing to the increased pressure on its surface,
is rapidly accelerated and the gases expand to volume \'! and pressure p„.
When the gas has reached a predetermined pressure the exhaust valve

open automatically. The inflowing water follows the moving water column
and fills the gas cylinder, thus partly replacing the burned gases. The hydro-
static pressure from the water tank reverses the water column closing the
water inlet valves and forcing the inert gases out through the exhaust valve.
Reaching the exhaust valve, the water seals the outlet and consequently the

remaining gases are compressed to the volume v4 and the pressure p4. Now
the water column reverses again. Reexpansion of the compressed gases
takes place and the pressure falls below the atmospheric pressure. The
mixture inlet valve, B, opens and a new charge is taken in until the volume
\1 is filled. The water column reverses again and compresses the charge

again. The engine works on the four cycle principle, the expansion and
compression occurs, theoretically, along adiabatic curves, and the cycle is
carried on by the oscillation of the water column due to the changes of
pressure. The action of the pump is not altered if instead of delivering into
the elevated tank it is discharged into an air vessel. The pump has the ad-

large pumps installed near the city of London, 15 tons of water are dis-
charged at each working stroke.

Daimler Engine. All important gas engine inventors, as Otto and
Brayton, modified their engines in order to use liquid fuel. It remained, how-
ever, for Daimler, the pioneer automobile engineer and former manager of
the Otto Gas Engine Works, to develop the first gasoline engine of the Otto

type for automotive work. The main characteristic of the Daimler engine
was its high speed. Contemporary gas engines, were running at 150 R. P.
M., while Daimler increased the speed to 800 R. P. M. This meant a con-
siderable reduction in weight at equal power output, yet on the other hand
a higher strain was set up in the various parts of the engine, necessitating
better materials of construction. Thus the Daimler engine incidentally gave
also the impetus for the development of high grade materials without which
the present day high grade internal combustion engines would be impossible.
Daimler's first engine, built in 1884, was of the horizontal one cylinder type,
and differed from the original Otto engine only in speed, weight, fuel, and
valve gear mechanism. Later he constructed vertical engines of the twin
cylinder V type, and four cylinder all in line type. The later, has gradually

been developed to the standard automobile engine of today, see Fig. 58
running at speeds of 600 R. P. M. to 3000 R. P. M. Starting at the left

The valve timing or cam shaft, G, driven through gear, G-, by pinion, F4, on

115
the four outlet cams, G4, are fixed to this shaft. At the lower end of each
of the connecting rods, C, is a splasher or oil dipper, C5. The crankcase, M,
encloses the base of the engine. Splash troughs, L, are in the bottoms of
the crankcase beneath each connecting rod, C. The oil reservoir, or sump,
Mi, is located beneath the crank case. The parts requiring lubrication are
the crank shaft bearings, crank pin bearings, piston pin bearings, cam shaft
bearings, timing gears, cams, valve lifter guides, pistons, piston rings, and
cylinder walls.
In almost all gasoline engines the intake of fresh gas to the cylinder,
and the exhaust of the inert gases from the combustion chamber are governed

by clashing "poppet" valves. These valves are rather noisy. To eliminate
this noise in automobile engines, Charles Y. Knight invented "sleeve valves"
also known as the Knight valves, which, besides offering other advantages,
have proved to be noiseless. Two cylindrical sliding valves glide silently up
and down between the cylinder wall and the piston, one working within the
other. Ports or openings, in these sleeves register with each other and with
the cylinder ports at proper intervals, forming large and unobstructed pass-
ages for intake and exhaust gases. The operation of the sleeve valves is
clearly explained in the illustration. Fig. 59.
The Daimler gasoline engine running on the Otto cycle has proved to be
such a successful prime mover that it has, today, in its modified and improved


form, and under various commercial names a dominant position in the entire
automotive field. Without it, the operation of not only the motor cycle and
automobile but the truck, tractor, motorboat, and aircraft would be almost
an impossibility. Of course, one type could not meet all the different re-
quirements of the various fields, hence the modern gasoline or light oil engine
necessarily must be of that specific design which readily adapts itself to the
given conditions. Such representative types are illustrated in Fig. 26, 27,
28, 29, 30, 31, 35, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73,
74 and 75.
The highest class of high speed gasoline engine design is that represented
by the aircraft engine. Many types have been developed both here and
abroad showing various characteristics. Those of American make are given
in Table No. 3.
The Liberty engine is perhaps the best known among those enumerated.
It is used in land and sea planes, has overhead valves and overhead cam-
shafts. Its individual cylinders are made of drawn steel tubing and bolted
to the upper half of the aluminum crankcase. The water jackets are of
pressed steel and welded to the cylinders. Fig. No. 73 shows a sectional
view of the Liberty Aircraft engine, as used on tanks, having integral cast
iron cylinders and jackets. The carburetors and the intake manifold are
mounted between two rows of cylinders, while the inlet and the outlet
valves are in the cylinder heads and under an angle of 300 with each other.
The pistons are of the trunk type and made of aluminum. In the army type,
the pistons have a crowned head giving an 18% compression space. The
navy type pistons have a flat head which gives a 20^% compression space.
Three piston rings on each piston assure pressure tightness. The piston
pins are seamless steel tubes driven into the bosses of the piston. The pins
are surrounded by bronze bushings which are inserted into the round
closed end of the connecting-rod. The latter has a I beam section and a
length of 12 inches. The lower end of the left rod is forked; that of the
right rod plain. The caps are held in place by studs. The crankshaft is
drop forged, of 2%" diameter and supported by seven bronze babbitt-lined
bearings. At its forward end, it carries a propeller hub, and at its rear end,
a bevel gear for driving the valve mechanism. Oil is supplied to the con-
necting rod bearings by means of openings drilled through the crankpins
and crankcheeks to the mainbearings. The latter are in direct communica-
tion with oil pumps located in the oil sump. The oil spray thrown off by
centrifugal force from the ends of the connecting rod lubricates the piston
pins and cylinder walls. A part of the oil conducted to the crankshaft main
bearing at the propeller end of the engine goes through a passage around
this bearing and up through pipe leads to the propeller and the camshaft
housing. From the end of the camshaft housing it is led around the end of
the camshaft bearing through a passage drilled diametrically through the
bearing midway of its length.
Once every revolution of the camshaft a hole drilled through the cam-
shaft into its hollow center registers with the oil passage through the bearing.
The oil is led through the hollow camshaft and out through holes in it to


117
each camshaft bearing. The excess oil lubricates the cams and rockers and
finally finds its way to the gear end of the camshaft housing, over the gears
and down the driveshaft housing into a chamber just above the oil pump.
The crankcase consists of two pieces, aluminum castings. The two
parts carry the upper and lower bearing shell respectively, and are held to-
gether by long studs which pass through the upper half of the crankcase.
From the bevel gear end of the crankshaft a vertical shaft is operated.
This in turn transmits motion to th? two intermediate camshafts which lie
Fig. 79
parallel with the center lines of the cylinders and drive the camshafts. The
latter, by means of cams and rockers actuate the valves which are of standard
mushroom type, and held in place by valve springs of the double concentric
type The clearances permitted in this engine vary from .00025 inches
minimum, occurring at the rocker levers to .07 inches maximum for end
play of crankshafts.
Diesel Engine. Dr. Rudolph Diesel of Munich, Bavaria, published in
1893 a book: "The Theory and Design of a Rational Heat Engine" in which


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
he described the principles of an ideal internal combustion engine, for the
efficient operation of which he formulated the three main requirements.
i) Creation.of the highest temperature in the cycle by mere compres-
sion of pure air and not by combustion of the charge;
2) Gradual introduction of atomized fuel into the highly compressed,
and consequently highly heated, air in such a way that the temperature of the
charge remains constant.
3) Proper selection of the air-gas ratio to allow a practical operation
of the engine without a waterjacket.
The compressive pressure of this ideal engine was 250 atmospheres.
Dr. Diesel expected considerable trouble due to the high pressures, conse-
Fig. 80. 170 Horsepower, Two-cycle Diesel Engine, one cylinder horizontal type
quently he proposed another "approximately ideal" cycle with lower com-
pression pressure and lower efficiency. Patents granted to Diesel enabled
him to form a partnership with the Maschinen Fabrik Augsburg and Fried-
rich Krupp of Essen. After several years of very difficult and tedious ex-
perimental work, Diesel found out that his ideal engine could not be realized.
The oil engine, however, which was developed by him and his associates be-
tween 1893 and 1898 showed, an over-all efficiency of 32%, and thus turned
out to be far the most efficient heat engine, yet built.
In Fig. 76 and 77 an early type of Diesel working on the four stroke
principle is illustrated. The main parts of the engine can be clearly recog-
nized in the transverse section Fig. 76. They are: the crankcase, the frame
with waterjacket, cylinder liner and cylinder cover, the piston with the
wristpin, connecting rod and crankpin, the two-stage air compressor. I„

and the fuel needle, B, operated by the levers D and V, respectively. In the
longitudinal section, Fig. JJ, there are shown: the crankshaft with flywheel
and pulley, the three bearings, the vertical shaft, c, driving the horizontal
camshaft, H, and the governor, M, the air inlet valve, E, and the exhaust
valve, A. The air furnished by the air compressor at a pressure of 1000
pounds per square inch must be cooled before it is stored in the airflasks.
By means of pipes the compressed air is carried from the flasks to the start-
ing valve F and the fuel needle, B. To start the engine the piston must be
slightly moved out of dead centre and the hand lever, G, laid down in the
horizontal position. This throws the needle valve out of action and brings
the lever arm, D, in contact with the starting cam thus putting the starting
valve in operation and allowing compressed air to enter the cylinder. The
piston begins to move down and the speed of the engine increases. After
the latter has made several revolutions the hand-lever, G, is turned back
into the vertical, the operating position, in which the fuel needle is in regular
operation and the starting valve at rest.
Tn this country the Busch-Sulzer Brothers — Diesel Engine Company
is the original and was, from 1898 to 1911, the only company manufacturing
Diesel Engines in America. It owns all U. S. patents granted to Dr. Rudolph
Diesel, and is closely associated with the old firm of Sulzer Bros., of
Winterthur, Switzerland, with which it is in intimate cooperation. After the
original U. S. Diesel patents had expired in 1912, many other engine concerns
took up the manufacture of the Diesel engine. Fig. 78, 79 and 80 illustrate
some recently designed Diesel engines of American make.


HUMAN SIDE OF ENGINEERING
FRED H. RINDGE, JR., NATIONAL SECRETARY OF INDUSTRIAL
DEPARTMENT OF THE Y. M. C. A.
I was riding on a train the other day with the General Manager of a
great manufacturing concern. As we passed a huge plant 4ie remarked, "We
have in that factory graduates of twenty eight different colleges and engi-
neering schools. A large number of those fellows are a blame nuisance."
When I inquired just what he meant, he said, "They come to us with a
splendid knowledge of theory and of technical details, but they have prac-
tically no knowledge of human nature, nor of how to handle working men.
I have to waste a great deal of time endeavoring to straighten out labor
difficulties arising as a result of the college men never having been trained
.adequately along these lines."
Many other illustrations could be given to prove the need for more
training in our engineering colleges along these lines. It is perfectly obvious
that in these days of industrial reconstruction it isn't enough for a man to be
a mechanical, civil, or electrical, or any other kind of a technical engineer.
He must be a human engineer, and a social engineer as well. The nation
needs leadership at this time as never before in history, and it is time that
we faced the problem fairly and squarely.
In the management of men, the engineer as usually trained, has his
severest test. Many engineers, remarkable for their judgment, skill and in-
telligence, fail dismally in handling men. The very nature of the training
of the engineer tends to unfit him in directing and controlling the rank and
file of the workmen. The exact and uncompromising methods so necessary
in engineering training cannot be applied in dealing with men. Fairness
and justice are the cardinal principles to be used always, but in addition, in
dealing with people one must know how to bring the human element into
all such relations. When this is properly done, the workman is inspired,
stimulated and led into obedience and loyalty to which no severity or rigid
rules could drive him.
"There is a great difference in the effect upon an employee of the way an
order or decision is given. You all have probably at some time dealt with
those in authority from whom you would rather receive a refusal than an
acquiescence from another. An adverse decision would be received from the
former superior and carried out with a feeling of grudging obedience and
almost revolt from the latter. The different effect upon the employee was
caused by the employer's knowledge of and due regard for one phase of the
human element in dealing with the employee."
The question is. "How can we give our engineering students training in
the human side of their chosen profession before they graduate, and have to
learn only by costly experiences and perhaps through bitter failures?"


Much is being done to help solve the problem. A number of colleges are
including in their regular engineering curricula a course on the '"Human
Side of Engineering." Such a course ought to include such topics as, The
Human Factor in Industry, The Evolution of the Individual Worker, The
Influence of the Modern Factory System on the Worker, Human Factors in
Production, The Ethics of Engineering and Business, Employment Man-
agement. Cooperative Organizations, Legislation and Public Opinion on In-
dustrial Questions, The Programs of Typical Companies, Scientific Manage-
ment in Its Human Relations, Intelligent Handling of Employes, The En-
gineer's Responsibility for Service, Industrial and Social Readjustment and
Reconstruction. Other colleges are putting a certain amount of this material
into already established courses. Many individual professors are bringing
these ideas to the fore in connection with their regular work, whatever the
subject taught. All this is splendid but not enough.
In the last analysis, college students must be brought face to face in fre-
quent contact with foreign and American working men and boys whom they
will have to handle directly or indirectly after graduation. This necessitates
the organization of various kinds of social service in the community, which
can be undertaken by college men one or two evening's a week, such as teach-
ing English to foreigners, leading technical classes of American working men
handling classes of American working boys, talking in shops at noon meet-
ings, in short, any kind of work which will make for special contact and mu-
tual understanding. To illustrate what I mean, the other night in the pour-
ing rain twelve college students from one of the Middle Western universi-
ties walked with me over the railroad ties, and on a siding of the track was a
railroad box car where were living twelve section men, who knew no English.
We climbed the ladder of the car and found ourselves in the midst of a
typical railroad bunk house. Without our knowing their language, or they
ours, we proceeded to teach these men their first lesson in English, by the
rapid fire Roberts Method. The men were able, in an hour, to repeat from
memory seventeen distinct sentences in English, and understand what they
were talking about. This is possible by acting out each sentence of the les-
son, by using charts, lesson sheets, and other methods of making clear each
sentence of the lesson. That the men were truly appreciative was quite evi-
dent when one of the college students returning to teach the class the second
lesson another evening, found that the men had plastered the sides of the box
car with newspapers, cleaned up the lamps, and put on their best clothes.
And they sat on the bench awaiting their second lesson. And all this hap-
pened without any suggestion from anyone except themselves. In other
words, their standard of living had been raised over night because some one
had taken a real interest in them. Needless to say the college men carried
on that class regularly, learned far more than they taught, and this sort of
thing has been duplicated hundreds of times all over the country. Men have
gone into the homes, boarding houses, foreign clubs, shops, etc., week after
week, in service of this kind, and have gained a knowledge of actual condi-
tions, and an insight into human nature, and a knowledge of how to handle
men which could not come in anv other wav.


In another instance some college men started a class for foreigners in
one of the marble works in Vermont. After the class had broken up the
manager said, "Do you fellows know who that last Italian was who left the
room'(" If you have been to Washington, D.C., you have noticed the beauti-
ful marble statues outside the Union Station. The last man to leave the
room was the man who carved most of those statues, but to my knowledge'
this was his lirst lesson in English." Surely a college man, realizing for the
first time this state of affairs, becomes naturally far more interested in the
problem in Americanization and the right handling of these men from other
lands, whose potentialities are seldom noticeable on the outside. Only direct
contact and human touch reveals the hidden depths of the ordinary man, and
it is the ordinary man in the last analysis, whom the engineer of the future
will be obliged to deal with.
One Saturday afternoon a group of college men went into a railroad
round house and learned more about the workings of the place than they
had ever learned in college. Then they went into the locker room, and a
keen American mechanic asked this question. "Suppose I want to put a
steel band around a cylinder head of an engine. I know how far it is across.
How large shall I make the band?" One of the students explained to him
the Pi D formula, and the mechanic was delighted. That man's question was
the beginning of a natural education class in the round house led by college
men for many months. In a similar way men have gone into the shops and
labor unions and just so long as they have gone in a spirit of willingness to
help and to learn, rather than simply to teach, they have succeeded admirably.
Who can doubt that they have learned far more than they have given? In a
similar fashion a young college man took hold of a club of apprentices from
the factories in a downtown settlement house. After six months the group
had grown from a gang of five to a club of twenty five, and the j ear's activi-
ties closed with an entertainment long to be remembered. At its close the
President of the club presented the college student with a silver loving cup
with the names of the twenty five boys suitably engraved upon it, as a token
of appreciation of what he had meant to them during the period of his lead-
ership. In this way the Bolsheviki have been outwitted and these boys have
been won for sterling American citizenship. Surely this service is tremen-
dously worth while, from an objective as well as subjective point of view,
and this as the sort of thing the Industrial Service Movement of the Y. M.
C. A. has been promoting for ten years throughout the United States and
Canada. In the year prior to the war there were over 4,500 college students
from 200 colleges actually serving 100.000 working men and boys each week.
Now that conditions in our colleges are settling down to normal again, and
now that the spirit of service is far greater than ever, our colleges should
graduate at least two thousand men a year who have caught this vision, and
who have had actual contact with this Movement. Already several thousand
men are on our mailing list at headquarters and are being kept in touch with
in their larger spheres of influence after graduation.
Many surprising things are being accomplished by these men who have
caught the vision of the human side of their jobs. I recall one young fellow


from the University of Michigan who taught a class of foreigners in Ann
Arbor several years ago. Within six months after graduation he held a
position in a motor car plant in Detroit, lie showed such unusual ability in
handling men and making friends with everybody that the management pick-
ed him out of many, doubled his salary and asked him to assume charge of
one of the most important phases of the welfare work in the entire plant. I
know another young Michigan graduate in the same city who had been given
complete control of the entire educational work of the plant, including many
classes in English and citizenship for foreign employees. He was making a
huge success of it, because he had gotten the sympathy and method as an
undergraduate at college. Why should not many more students at Ann Arbor
be engaged in service of this or similar kind at some regular time each week?
Further, in addition to instruction along lines of the human side of en-
gineering in the curriculum, and in addition to the supplementary experience
in practical industrial service such as indicated, it is entirely feasible for the
University of Michigan, as well as other colleges, to promote such features
as giving more attention to the human side of engineering in inspection trips,
including in the engineering libraries and similar rooms more material along
these lines, having one or more special human engineering bulletin boards on
which the latest material of companies and labor organizations dealing with
industrial betterment could be placed. Ohio State University has set a
splendid example for the country in holding a remarkable Congress of Hu-
man Engineering. For two days students were excused from all classes so
that they might hear prominent employers, labor leaders, engineers, welfare
experts, etc., present the different points of view of vital industrial and social
problems and the college man's opportunity and responsibility. Fifty five
hundred copies of the report have been mailed by request to interested pro-
fessors, business men, and others, indicating the unusual interest in this unus-
ual experiment.
Great interest is being shown in the whole human side of business all
over the world. It is vitally necessary that our college presidents, boards of
trustees, faculty members, and students, as well as alumni, take the most pro-
gressive position in relation to the whole matter. In connection with any-
thing that Michigan, or any of the other colleges, do, the Industrial Service
Movement of the Y. M. C. A. stands ready to cooperate in every possible
way.
Splendid cooperation has been given by the National Engineering socie-
ties and influential groups representing both capital and labor. Papers on
the Movement have been read at annual meetings of engineering societies,
as well as before gatherings of business men, industrial leaders, etc. Govern-
ment officials and representatives of both capital and labor heartilv approve
the whole plan. As one of the most prominent business men of the country
expressed it, "The Movement is one of the most significant and far-reaching
in connection with modern industry." The Industrial Service Movement
is proving in the most convincing way that social interest, and not self-inter-
est, and that the building of Christian character, is the key-note to the solu-
tion of many of our social and industrial problems.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Thus quietly but rapidly, without undue advertising, has been advancing
a great movement, broad in scope, submerging creed and class in altruistic
service, helping solve indirectly many vital problems of the day, making for
better understanding, the improving of conditions, and the transforming of
individual lives. At least a thousand men are graduating each year from our
colleges after having had a most helpful contact with the Movement in one
or more of its aspects. As thousands more of these men continue to graduate
with a new vision of their service opportunities and responsibilities, who can
foresee their influence in promoting industrial righteousness, and in main-
taining industrial peace?


Part I
• P. W. Steelsmith, '19
From the time the second make of automobile was manufactured, "car
performance" or "car ability" has been the supreme point of interest and
comparison. Each manufacturer has tried to produce an automobile which
would surpass that of his competitors in performance. Mechanical improve-
ments and body designs have received their share of interest. When, how-
ever, the buyer has decided upon the price he is willing to pay, his main in-
terest is centered upon the question, "How will car A compare with car B
in performance?"
The term "performance" or "ability", as the buyer demands it shall
mean, is not to be based upon freak stunjs. It is based upon what he, him-
self, will be able to do, and continue to do, with the automobile he purchases,
under actual average operating conditions.
What does "performance" mean and how can it be determined? What
does the buyer demand in the way of performance and how can he compare
results?
The Society of Automobile Engineers, recognizing the need for some
standard of comparison has developed a set of "standard tests for car per-
formance." These tests embody the following principles: (t) range of op-
erating speed, (2) speed of acceleration, (3) hill climbing ability, (4) fuel
economy.
There is another factor which greatly influences the buyer in his deci-
sion as to the car he chooses, which is an entirely personal element. This
factor is "comfort". At the present time there is no agreeable way of de-
termining "comfort" as a set rating. It might be defined as a mental or
physical condition resulting from riding qualities, driving ease, expense of
upkeep, car beauty, smooth running qualities, vibration, and other inherent
qualities. "Comfort must be determined by the buyer according to his own
estimation of the relative value of its various qualities.
In the matter of determining the ratings of the tangible elements let us
first consider acceleration and hill climbing ability. Assuming the inertia of
the rotating parts of two cars equal, the acceleration and hill-climbing ability
are both dependent upon and directly proportioned to, excess draw-bar pull
per pound of weight of the car, over that necessary to propel the car at a
given speed, against the usual road, wind, tire and f rictional resistances. We
have assumed in this statement that the inertia of the moving parts of the
two cars is equal. It has been found that the variation due to difference in
inertia of the rotating parts is small and may be considered a negligible quan-
tity in our computations. It may readily be seen that it would be a tremen-
dous task to determine this inertia and that the knowledge is not worth the


TUB MICHIGAN THCHNIC
labor as our results are not absolutely exact comparisons. The results are,
however, accurate enough to give a very fair and definite basis of compari-
sons which is all that is desired. To go deeper would be useless at the present
time.
Acceleration or "pick-up" may be measured by precision apparatus which
is described later in this article. A close approximate hill-climbing ability
can be calculated at any given speed, once the acceleration at that speed is
known. For these reasons it was agreed that acceleration tests be used as
the standard factor in car performances for indicating excess draw-bar pull.
In drawing a car at a constant speed on a level road, a certain constant
amount of power is required, and the throttle opening is constant. When the
throttle is opened an increase of power is developed. This increase or ex-
cess of power over that deevloped before the throttle was opened is expend-
ed in two ways (i) increasing the speed, i. c, acceleration, or (2) pulling or
hill-climbing. This excess power is called draw-bar pull.
We know—
F equals Ma equals W/32.2 X A.
Let Fj equals force equals excess draw-bar pull (D. B. P.).
W, equals weight of the car.
A, equals acceleration.
Tn Figure 1 the grade equals A/B.
F equals the force down the grade exerted by the car and which must
be overcome by the excess draw-bar pull.
W equals the weight of the car.
The triangles are similar.
Therefore A/B equals F/W equals the steepest grade the car will climb.
F/W equals F,/W, equals A/B equals the maximum grade.
F equals Wa/32.2 equals F, (a/32.2) equals Fj/W,.
Therefore the maximum grade which the car will climb equals a/32.2
equals (acceleration at the given speed/32.2).
Example I. Let us take a practical example: Assume a speed of 4
m.p.h. Assume an acceleration at the speed equals 2 ft./sec.2 The greatest
grade that the car can climb at a constant speed of 4 m.p.h. equals a/32.2
equals 2/32.2 equals 6.2%. This result is for the best throttle opening ob-
tainable at the given speed.


Example II. Assume a speed of 20 m.p.h. Assume that at this speed
we have reached a maximum acceleration. Assume that a equals 6 ft./sec.2
The greatest grade the car will climb then under any condition will be
(max. a/32.2 equals 6/32.2 equals 18.6%.
Complete car performance then becomes the resultant of (1) range of
operating speed, (2) acceleration, (3) fuel ecoonmy.
What might be called an experimental test of the standard test was run
at Sheepshead Bay Speedway, New York, Nov. 20 and 21, 1916. These
tests did not comply with all the rules of the "standard tests" and were mere-
ly to try out the system.
Realizing the importance of starting in a practical manner the testing
of different cars as a means of fair comparison of their relative performance
or ability, and appreciating the advantage of being able to procure the neces-
sary apparatus, the men carrying on a course in automobile research work-
under the guidance of Professor Walter T. Fishleigh and Professor Walter
E. Lay prepared for and ran a series of tests on several cars, in accordance
with the standard rules of the S. A. E.
The following tests were made:
(1) The car was driven upon a good pavement road to determine its
operating range of speed; that is, the lowest and highest speeds at and be-
tween which the engine and the car would operate steadily and successfully.
(2) The acceleration was tested, beginning with the lowest operating
speed and accelerating for 50 seconds. Successive tests were made starting
at 9-11, 14-16, 19-22, 26-3om.p.h.
(3) Tests were made to determine the fuel economy; that is, the miles
per gallon of gasoline. The runs were made at lowest operating speed, 9-11,
14-16, 19-22, 26-30, 35-40 m.p.h. and at maximum operating speed. These
tests were run over a pavement road north of Belleville. Michigan.
All tests were made without a change of any adjustment and with stand-
ard stock equipment. The load carried was that equal to five people of
weight of 150 pounds each.
There were other requirements too lengthy to report at this time, but
which tend to regulate the test to average operating conditions. .

Apparatus
Fuel Economy. The apparatus for the fuel economy tests provides a
means for accurately weighing the gasoline used during the test, (Cut).
It consists of two tanks, A and B mounted side by side. The gauges on the
side of the tanks show the level of the gasoline. The gauge on tank B has
a brass slider arranged to indicate approximately when 2 lbs. of gasoline
as the S. A. E. specifications demand that 2 lbs. of gasoline shall be used on
each Fuel economy test. The tanks are connected to a system of valves as


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
shown below them, in such a matter that, as the lever (X) is pulled or push-
ed, one tank is cut out and the other cut in at the same instant. The appa-
ratus is designed in this way so gasolene may be drawn from tank (A) for
maneuvering the car on turns and from tank (B) for testing. The tanks can
easily be removed from their mount, for weighing, by loosening the wing nut
at the top and knurled union at the bottom. The apparatus is mounted on
the windshield when cars with regular equipment are tested. The tubing
shown at the bottom replaces the usual gas line to the carburetor.
Fig. 2
Acceleration
The acceleration apparatus provides a means for obtaining data for a
space time curve from which the acceleration may be determined.
The acceleration is shown in Fig. (3). The accelerometer record is
shown in Fig (4). The record is taken on a paper strip. The roll of paper
is mounted as shown and is pulled across the table under the pens of the re-
volving drum (D) Fig. (3) which is driven by electric motor (M). The
pens are operated by electro-magnet jerks to one side at the proper instant.
The Seconds pen is operated by a chronometer. Fig. (5) which makes and
breaks the circuit every second, or one-fifth second, as desired. The pen


129
registering the beginning of the acceleration is operated by a contact on the
accelerator pedal, Fig. (6) which is in operation only the instant that the
accelerator pedal is depressed. The mark registered by it provides a means
for determining when acceleration starts. The holes made in the paper by
the spark are the part of the record by which the acceleration is determined,
as is shown in this report.

Geared to the front wheel of the car with a five to one ratio is the break-
er, Fig. (7), which operates the same as an ignition breaker. An ignition
coil is mounted on the base plate of the accelerometer and wired to the
breaker so that every time that the front wheel turns around once five sparks
jump through the paper. The distance between holes made by the spark
represents the distance passed over by the car in one-fifth of a revolution of
the front wheel.

The method of calculating- is of importance because data without a
knowledge of how to use it is useless.
Economy computations are very simple. Knowing the speed, the dis-
tance traveled, and the weight of the gasoline used, it is an easy matter to
Fig.
Fig. 6
convert miles per pound to miles per gallon and then to plot the result against
speed.
Acceleration calculations, on the other hand, are not so simple and require
considerable time. First the circumference of the left front wheel, to which
the breaker is attached, must be measured. The distance traversed by the
car, having its full complement of passengers or equivalent, during ten revo-


131
lutions of the front wheel is carefully determined. This distance divided
by ten epuals the average circumference. Next, the number of times the
breaker operates per revolution of the wheel must be known. The number
of holes, per second, in the record has to be counted. An increasing num-
ber of holes indicates a positive acceleration while a decreasing number of
holes indicates a negative acceleration.
After this has been done the acceleration may be calculated. It is as-
sumed that the increment of velocity of the car is constant during any second.
Fig. 7
Let N, equal the number of holes (fifths of revolution of the leic front
wheel) in any second.
N2 equal the number of holes (fifths of revolution of the left front
wheel) in previous second.
Vx equals velocity (in ft. per second) during any second.
V. equals velocity (in ft. per second) during previous second.
Vm equals velocity (in m. p. h.)
C equals constant equals distance represented by one-fifth revolution of
left front wheel equals (circumference of wheel/5).
A equals acceleration in ft. per second in any second.
T equals time in seconds.
0.682 equals conversion factor (ft./sec.) to m. p, h.

Then :—
Vt equals N,C; V„ equals NX;
V™! equals V, times 0.682; Vm2 equals V, times 0.682
A equals (Vx—V2)/T equals (Nt—N2)/C (in ft. per second2)

After learning the purpose of the tests, and having a knowledge of the
operation of the apparatus, and also of the method of calculation, the reader
will no douht wish to know something about the results obtained. As yet
the calculations are incomplete but it is believed, from what has been done,
that the results are good.
Kor the results of the economy tests see the curves of Fig. 7. It will
be noticed that both cars give very good economy through out the range of
fifteen to thirty miles per hour. As the carburetor cannot be adjusted except
at the beginning of the test, a speed range of twelve to thirty-one miles per


hour was all that could be obtained with the Ford car while a range of
five to forty-five miles per hour was obtained with the Dodge car.
The Society of Automobile Engineering specifications require that all
curves for any one car be plotted on the same curve sheet. Fig. 8 shows such
a curve sheet. The curves shown are similar to those given by Professor
Gallup in the May 1917 Society of Automobile Engineering Proceedings
which were obtained at the Indianapolis Speedway.
The irregularity of these curves is at once noticeable. Does a car really
accelerate in such an irregular manner as this would indicate or is it the
fault of the apparatus used?
This is the question which is troubling Engineers at present. It is hoped
that this improved apparatus will make it possible to show definitely whether
the curves should be smooth or irregular. In all probability, by the time this
article appears in print complete computations of the tests run April 11, and
14 will have been made and all curves drawn.


ALUMINUM ALLOYS
A. H. ROBINSON AND S. C. ZYLSTRA, '19
The use of aluminium as a commercial metal has increased tremen-
dously, within the last ten years, both when used as the pure metal and when
alloyed with others such as copper, magnesium, tin, calcium, zinc and nickel.
About 30-35 per cent of the aluminium produced is used in the manu-
facture of automobiles, such as castings and in sheet metal form. Its light-
ness and moderate tensile strength have been the causes for this use. Alum-
inium is also used extensively in the manufacture of electric apparatus and
for wire, being a very good conductor of electricity. Due to its great affinity
for oxygen it is used as a deoxidizer in the manufacture of steel, for the
removal of blow-holes. Other minor uses are for wrapping foil and paint
powder.
Quoting James E. Diamond in his report to the American Society of
Automobile Engineers: "The weight of the aluminium alloy piston is about
one-third that of a cast-iron one of the same design. . . . The coefficient
of friction of the aluminium piston alloy is but half that of iron. There
must therefore be a gain in mechanical efficiency of the engine. Hence the
piston side pressure may be increased without unfavorable results. The heat
conductivity of the aluminium piston alloy is from ten to fourteen times that
of iron and reflects itself in a marked decrease in the amount of carbon de-
posited on the piston head. Under favorable lubricating conditions there
may be a total absence of carbon. In engines with the smaller bores this
thermal property may be used to increase the compression beyond the point
at which pre-ignition would invariably occur with iron pistons.
The point of superiority most marked and of the greatest practical
worth in the Cothias piston has to do with the hardness. The Lynite piston
alloy has exceptional qualities even when cast in sand, and acquires a hardness
fully twenty-five per cent greater in the process referred to herein. In fact
its hardness falls not far short of that of the- average piston iron. At the
same time it is enough softer than the iron or semi-steel of the cylinder, that
in the event of piston seizure, the piston and not the cylinder is scored. One
result of this process is to strengthen the metal from 20 to 30 per cent. How-
ever this gain is secondary in importance to the gain in hardness. . . .
No difficulty is encountered in grinding the pistons made by the process
described due to the acquired hardness of the metal. Kerosene seems to be
the best grinding or cutting compound.
The troubles anticipated on account of the relatively greater expansion
of aluminium than iron have not materialized. The coefficient of expansion
for iron is .0000119 and aluminium .000023 per degree Fahrenheit but the
difference is not so significant as it might seem, since the greater thermal


conductivity of the aluminium alloy plays a part in the actual expansion."
In the discussion which followed the reading of this report it was point-
ed out that the oxy-acetylene flame, often used in removing the carbon from
the cylinder and piston, had no detrimental effect on the aluminium alloy, in
fact the piston head after it was cleaned showed just as high a polish as it
did originally. It was also shown that even though aluminium alloys on the
whole are softer than cast-iron they do not wear away any faster. An exam-
ple being that of a piston taken from an engine in a car which had been
driven about 11,000 miles. This piston showed a wear which is simply the
initial wear, of .00025 inch and is not any more than you might find on any
cast-iron or steel piston.
Aluminium when used as the pure cast metal has a tensile strength of
from 12,000 to 15.000 pounds per square inch with an elongation of ten to
forty per cent, but by cold working the tensile strength can be raised to from
22,000 to 35,000 pounds per square inch with an elongation of from one to
seven per cent. If worked to any great extent the metal must be annealed
to reduce the strains set up, otherwise checking and cracking will result. By
alloying with certain metals the tensile strength may or may not be increased,
depending on the composition of the alloy.
Since the alloy with which we are dealing is a mixture of copper and
aluminium a slight discussion of the copper-aluminium equilibrium diagram
may be of use. The liquidus consists of seven branches corresponding with
the separation of seven solid phases, one of these being the compound CuAl2,
and the others being solid solutions designated by the letters A, B, C, D, E
and N. The A solution may contain as much as 9 per cent aluminium, B
from 10-15 per cent, aluminium at 1,000° C. but at lower temperatures A
or B crystals develop. The fourth phase D is stable only between 570° C.
and 845° C. and contains from 78-73 per cent copper. At lower temperatures
this phase breaks up into a mixture of C and E. The compound CuAl2 cor-
responding to about 54 per cent copper, melts at 590° C. and is largely a crys-
talline body. The N solution consists chiefly of aluminium and has a limit-
ing concentration of alxmt 11 per cent copper. With the compound CuAl,
it forms a eutectic which has a well-defined banded structure. All of the
solid phases except A and B are white and all except A, B and N are brittle.
The only alloys of this series that have any commercial value are those con-
taining more than 89 and less than 11 per cent copper.
The alloys formed on the left side of the diagram, that is, those rich in
copper and consisting entirely of A solution are soft and ductible and the pres-
ence of B constituent makes itself known by an increase in tensile strength,
with a loss in ductility. The C constituent gives rise to brittleness and as the
amount of aluminium increases the brittleness becomes so great as to make
the alloy worthless. As the amount of copper decreases and aluminium in-
creases the N constituent is approached which has nearly the lightness of
aluminium with much better mechanical properties.
The particular alloy in which we are interested has its composition in
the N solid solution series, the approximate analysis being 92 per cent alum-
inium, 8 per cent copper and less than .3 per cent silicon as impurity. An-


other alloy of approximately the same composition but containing from I
to 1.7 per cent iron was also tested.
These alloys were used in the piston heads of a recently designed motor
and it was found that after operating continuously for periods of 24 hours
or more the alloys became pitted and porous, thus becoming much weaker.
It was found on further investigation that the operating temperature of the
piston head was between 500 and 550° C. This temperature approaches the
melting point of the alloy which is 6300 C. It was therefore desired to find
out what the relation was between the tensile properties of the alloy and
temperature. Also to find a method of increasing the tensile strength, as by
annealing and if this does increase the strength at what temperature and
how may hours of anneal?
In a preceding paragraph it was mentioned that on the right hand side
of the equilibrium diagram a eutectic was formed at about 32 per cent cop-
per and 68 per cent aluminium, this eutectic consisting of a compound CuAl2
and the solid solution N. Assuming this to be true it would be natural for
the eutectic to form around the grain boundaries of the alloy and in this
manner tend to weaken it. To eliminate this it was proposed to anneal the
test bars at a temperature slightly below the one at which the eutectic sepa-
rates out, and for varying lengths of time.
The bars were cast eight inches in length and circular in cross section,
and were heated in an electric muffle to a temperature of 5000 C. Thirty-
three bars were used making a total of eleven sets of three each. Three bars
were considered sufficient to make a good average for each anneal. The first
set was taken from the furnace at the end of one hour's heating, the second
set at the end of two hours and another set each two hours thereafter. This
gave the last set a total anneal of twenty hours.
These bars were then broken in an Olsen testing machine and the tensile
strengths observed were plotted against the number of hours aneal. Three
curves were plotted, a maximum, minimum and average. It was found that
the tensile, strength rose gradually as the length of time of annealing increased
until at. ten hours' anneal the maximum strength was produced, after which
it again dropped off. See Curves.
A microscopic examination of the structure of the bars was made and
it was found that in the case of bars which had not been annealed, that the
eutectic had formed around the grain boundaries as shown in figure I. Also
that as the time of anneal increased the eutectic gradually withdrew from the
boundaries and tended to form globules (white particles) as shown in Fig-
ures II and III. The black formations which show up the grain size and
boundaries are due to the impurities present such as silicon and small
amounts of iron. Tt is also thought that some of the eutectic in withdrawing
from the boundaries goes into solution at that temperature thus giving a
solid solution N. This may or may not be true and cannot be decided without
further work. This will be clone by heating the bars as before for varying
lengths of time but at a temperature of about 5750 C. instead of 5000 C. At
this temperature it is thought that the eutecic will go completely in solution
due to the fact that the eutectic separates out at 5450 C. and then if the bars


137
arc quenched in a medium which will prevent their cooling: so rapidly as to
crack, the resulting alloy will be a homogeneous solid solution N with pos-
sibly higher tensile strengths than that given by a mixture of compound and
solid solution.
In order to determine the tensile strength of the alloy at temperatures
varying from 50-550° C. a furnace had to be made which could be hung in


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
between the jaws of the testing machine. An alundnm tube twelve inches
long and two and one-quarter inches in diameter was wound with high resist-
ance wire. This was covered with a pasty mixture of Kaolin and asbestos
libre and allowed to dry. The tube was then packed in a metal drum twelve
inches in length and eight inches in diameter with infusorial earth. Special
steel grips to hold the test bars were made such that the bars which were
threaded on each end could be screwed into the grips and then the whole
thing run into the furnace from the top and held in place by a cross bar at
the upper end of the grip and top of testing machine. The lower end of the
bottom grip was also held in place by a cross bar similar to the one on top.
Thus when the bottom jaw of the machine was lowered sufficiently to come
in contact with the bottom cross bar a stress resulted which if increased
would eventually break the test bar. The furnace itself was held in position
by means of a rope which fastened to a loop of wire, surrounding the fur-
nace drum, and then up over the top of the testing machine. Current was
obtained from a 220 volt circuit and regulated by means of an ordinary
rheostat.
The bars were broken at temperatures running from 50° to 5500 C. and
again sets of three were used to get a good average.
The temperature of the bars was regulated by means of a thermo-couple
which was tied directly to the bar with a piece of asbestos string. The cou-
ple came out of the top of the furnace and led to a multi-voltmeter which,
by the use of a previously plotted curve, could be read in degrees V. or C.
Discussion of Cup.ves
The tensile strength curves for the straight copper-aluminium alloy
which was pulled at varying temperatures, show a slight increase in strength
at ioo° C. This cannot be accounted for unless it is due to the fact that
strains set up in the metal on cooling were released thus making the metal
less brittle but tougher. From this point on, however, the curve shows a

gradual decrease in strength until the temperature of 3000 C. is reached,
after which it drops off rapidly to a strength of less than 3,000 pounds per
square inch.
The copper-aluminium-iron alloy shows at room temperature a strength
of about 4,000 pounds more per square inch than the straight copper-alum-
inium alloy. This is probably due to the presence of the small amount of
iron. It does not show any increase in strength at ioo° C. but gradually falls

off until the temperature of 3000 C. is reached and from then on to 5500 C,
a decided decrease. This would indicate a change in structure but upon mi-
croscopic examination none could be found. Figure IV shows a cross sec-
tion view of the straight copper-aluminium alloy and Figure V a view of the
cooper-aluminium-iron alloy. The first named seems to have a more dense
appearance and would suggest greater strength but on viewing the alloy con-
taining iron it is easily seen that the eutectic, which so closely surrounds the
grains of the first alloy, has separated out forming white spots. In fact

this is more pronounced than in the alloy which was annealed. It would
seem then that to anneal the alloy, containing iron above 550° C. would be
useless, in fact no annealing at all would be necessary.
The elongation curves show that the annealed bars have practically a
constant elongation of about 1.5 per cent except for the bars which were
heated for ten hours and in this case the elongation only rises to 2 per cent.
Both of the other alloys, however, show a gradual increase up to 300° C.
and a rapid rise from then up to 5500 C. It is from this point on that the
strength decreases so rapidly.
No reduction of area could be determined on the annealed bars but for
the others the curves are very similar to the elongation, remaining practically
constant up to 3000 C. and then rising rapidly to 5500 C.
Conclusions
The conclusions to be drawn are, first, that the copper-aluir.inium-iron
alloy is the stronger of the two at ordinary temperatures but has only a
slight advantage at the higher temperature. It also takes a better finish on
machining than the straight copper-aluminium alloy, which might be a de-
sirable quality in some cases. The fracture of the iron alloy showed the
metal to be more free from blow-holes and slag-inclusions than the straight
aluminium alloy. It was also shown that, contrary to some opinions, an an-
nealing process in connection with the straight copper-aluminum alloy was
beneficial to the tensile strength.

EMPLOYMENT BUREAU
Perhaps the most important ques-
tion that a student in Engineering has
to answer is in what branch should he
specialize. This in most cases is de-
cided by a sort of a childish attraction
a student has for certain lines of work.
Others are influenced by their profes-
sors, by their parents, or by what they
have read. The choice is in some
cases, wisely done, but many times
mistakes are made which lead to a
great number of changes in positions
after graduation. It is necessary that
an Engineering student should have
this handicap? Why shouldn't he
know that there will be a place for him
in this industrial world for which he
has duly fitted himself?
In order to aid him to a fuller un-
derstanding of the opportunity which
awaits him, the Technic has instituted
a new department known as the Em-
ployment Bureau. We will present
here all data obtainable concerning
summer positions. This ought to be
an immense aid to students who wish
to link practical experience with their
University courses and at the same
time receive financial help for the com-
ing year. It is also our desire to pub-
lish material concerning the positions
which are open to graduates. Under-
graduates will then be able to learn
something of the nature of the posi-
tions which await them, and have the
opportunity to more fully equip them-
selves, while here, for those positions.
We trust that you will receive the
benefits for which this department was
organized.
LITERARY COURSES ADDED TO
ENGINEERING CURRICULUM?
The question of how the engineer may
be better equipped to meet the busi-
ness problems which are not included


143
in his college curriculum of study is a
query which at present is under serious
consideration at Michigan. The most
feasible solution which presents itself
is that the student in engineering
should be given several courses in the
literary college, thus creating a system
of study similar to that employed by
the medical and law schools.
The rapid advancement of the
science of engineering has promoted
the men of this profession to such a
standing that they are no longer sub-
ordinates in the business world but
take a leading role in its affairs. The
reconstruction work now being car-
ried on in Europe will serve to empha-
size the importance of this profession
and accelerate its advancement.
Deserving of its rank, the profession
rightfully demands that engineers not
only be technically skilled but should
also be equipped with a general busi-
ness knowledge.
It has been learned by experience
that the doctor, the lawyer, the dentist,
the druggist, and other leading pro-
fessional men of the world have been
more successful in their work by
reason that their training included a
general education course in addition
to courses pertaining solely to their
profession. Is the engineering student
a super-being who is gifted with the.
power of absorbing the good of this
work without having followed its
course of study?
The system of study for the technic-
al student should coincide quite largely
with that of his brother classmate
across the campus, that is, it should
consist of one or two years of literary
work followed by the usual four year
course in the engineering college.
Any action which the committee,
now considering the matter may see
fit to take which will encourage the
adoption of this plan, will be heartily
supported by the Tech nic.

PRESIDENT HARRY B. HUTCHINS
RESIGNS
With the resignation of President Hutch-
ins, which was accepted by the Board of Re-
gents at a special meeting held March 12,
we may assume the close of another period
in the history of the University. For, as
with his predecessors, the past ten years are
bound to be associated with his name. It is
a period upon which President Hutchins can
look back with satisfaction and honest
pride; for the record has been worthy, the
achievement solid. It has been a period of
growth in effectiveness and in numbers and
material equipment as well. How much, a
comparison with the Campus of 1909 will
show. More than that, the past ten years
have been a period of co-ordination, of
foundations laid for future development.
Largely through his skillful presentation of
the interests of the University to successive
Legislatures as well as to the people of the
commonwealth, the State has taken a new
and practical interest in the University, as
evidenced by the increasingly generous ap-
propriations. The alumni have been bound
to the University as never before and they
have been brought to see that even though
Michigan's chief support is from the State,
it is their responsibility and privilege to
aid their Alma Mater in many ways im-
possible to the tax payers. The first of our
own graduates to become President, this
has been the first task which President
Hutchins set himself. The Hill Audito-
rium, the Martha Cook Building, New-
berry Dormitory, the Betsy Barbour Dor-
mitory, and the Michigan Union, to say
nothing of scores of other benefactions,
are examples of this new spirit on the part
of the alumni which he has done so much
to foster.
But President Hutchins' influence has not
been solely directed toward material wel-
fare. He has brought the various depart-
ments of the Universiy together into a
well-rounded university; he has seen the
addition of several years in the Literary
College to the courses of practically all the
Professional Schools, and he has steadily
supported the increasing emphasis in the
quality of instruction of the University.
President Hutchins' great merit as an
administrator has been his simplicity, his
humanity, combined with a jealous care for
the welfare of the University. He has
guided the University well and wisely and
with a kindly sympathy toward everyone
with whom the wide range of his duties has
brought him into contact, which has com-
manded universal respect and affection,
even from those who have on occasion
disagreed with his policies. The whole
University body, faculty, sudents, and
graduates will join with the Michigan
Technic in a sincere and grateful acknowl-
edgement of the debt Michigan owes to him
and in heartfelt good wishes for him in
the well earned vacation he plans to take.

THE HONOR SYSTEM
Five years ago the students of the engi-
neering college adopted, with the hearty
approval of the faculty, the Honor System,
the purpose of which was to promote a
spirit of honor in examinations. This plan
was in effect a step towards self govern-
men, taking the responsibility for honorable
conduct in examinations out of the hands
of the faculty and placing it in the hands
of the students.
For five years the system has met with
ever increasing success, and it has not been


145
until just recently that there has been noted
any marked laxity in the observance of its
principles. This carelessness is probably due
to a lack of understanding on the part of
the underclassmen of their obligations as
individuals while governed by a system of
honor. It is for the information of Engi-
neering students in regards to their duties
in examinations that this article is writ-
ten.
The Honor System, being essentially a
form of self government, its success rests
entirely with the support of the students.
The primary purpose is to be on one's honor
during examinations and thus to be free
from the instructors' presence — in plain
language to be trusted. Do we need to be
watched ?—Certainly not.
As the underhanded method never brings
any good results in engineering practice, so
it never fools any one but the one who
practices it in college examinations. The
engineering profession wants men who can
be trusted. While we are being trained in
technical subjects in pursuit of our chosen
profession, we are causing to be developed
at the same time the habit of being trusted.
This quality we deem of more value to the
engineer than many a technical subject —
and here we have the fundamental reason
for which the Honor System was adopted.
The duties which we all assume upon
adopting the Honor System are as fol-
lows: —
To neither receive nor give aid in any
manner whatsoever in an examination.
To see that not only yourself but your
classmates as well, perform this duty.
These duties are not complex in theory
but have shown themselves to be more
difficult in the working out. We have
therefore a few suggesions to offer which
may assist the students in making the
Honor System a greater success: —
1. If you do not wish to take an exam-
ination under the honor system it is your
duty to tell your instructor and you will be
given the examination under the proctor
system. All persons taking examinations
in the College of Engineering will be ex-
pected to take them under the Honor Sys-
tem unless they otherwise request. Such
requests may be made before the examina-
tion and provisions will be made by the in-
structor.
2. Always take alternate seats whenever
possible.
3. Do not engage in unnecessary con-
versation, as it annoys your neighbor. Talk-
ing during an examination is liable to put
you in a suspicious light. If there is any
question about the statement of any exam-
ination questions ask the instructor before
he leaves the room or if he is not present
ask the class but do not discuss it with your
neighbors.
4. You should at all times feel free and
aboveboard but refrain from any action
which might bring unjust suspicion on you.
5. If you see any classmate using what
appears to be dishonorable means it is
your duty to call his attention to it and see
that it is stopped. If he persists call it to
the attention of the class and the matter
can probably be settled then and there.
6. If a man persists in dishonorable
methods after having been spoken to in
examinations about it, he should be reported
to the Honor committee, through the Sec-
retaries' office by written communication.
7. It is not permissible to check answers
while in the examination room.
The Honor Committee is composed of
two men elected from each of the four
classes and the chairman, a senior, elected
from and by the commitee at the end of
each year.
The committee trys all cases of cheating
and "near cheating" which are reported and
when a man is found guilty it imposes a
just penalty.
Other executive work necessary in the
operation of the system is done by the com-
mittee.
The Honor Committee should not be
held wholly responsible for the success of
the system.
The system will be a success only in-so-
far-as each student realizes and discharges
his duty.
The Honor Committee.


THE MICHIGAN THCHNIC
UNION MEMBERSHIP
CAMPAIGN
This year's campaign in behalf of the
Michigan Union has been an unusually
good one. In spite of the fact that there
are comparatively few men students attend-
ing the University, the campaign ended
with a total of over a thousand life mem-
berships. This number exceeds the number
gained in any previous year and is indica-
tive of the undergraduates' desire to see the
Union building completed.
THE NEW UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
Work on the new University Hospital is
to be begun July 1. This building, the
largest of its kind in the world, will be six
stories high and when completed will be
able to accommodate 1,200 patients. The
plans call for a building 420 feet long,
which will be in the form of two "Y's"
whose bases meet in the middle. It is to
be constructed of re-enforced concrete with
a brick curtain wall.
An appropriation of $700,000 has recently
been granted by the State Legislature, and
this, coupled with the $315,000 already ap-
propriated, makes a total of $1,015,000 now
available for the structure.
There can be no doubt but that there is
great need for such a hospital; a hospital
which will serve the whole State and espe-
cially the rural sections where no adequate
hospital service is provided.
INDUSTRIAL LEADER DELIVERS
LECTURE
Mr. Fred H. Rindge delivered a very in-
teresting lecture in Hill Auditorium Fri-
day evening, March seventh. The lecture
was given under the auspices of the Com-
merce Club and the Engineering Society.
Mr. Rindge has had extensive experience
with the National Y. M. C. A. Industrial
movement. Knowing his subject thoroughly
he brought it clearly in the minds of those
who attended the lecture.
The "Human Factor in Industry," and
the "Human Side of Engineering" were the
subjects that he chose. Mr. Rindge through-
out his lecture used "Capital and Labor"
and "American and Foreigner" as a
background for all of his arguments. An
interesting feature that he used in closing
was the method to be used in instructing
the foreigner in the rudiments of the Eng-
lish language.
In another part of this issue Mr. Rindge
has contributed a lengthy aricle entitled
"Training College Students in the Human
Side of Engineering."
PROFESSOR HENDERSON RELIEVED
FROM TEACHING
The many friends of Professor W. D.
Henderson will be pleased to learn that he
has been relieved from duty as Associate
Professor of Physics and appointed Di-
rector of the University Extension Service
with the title of professor.
LADY MEMBER OF FACULTY
RESIGNS
Miss Alice L. Hunt has tendered her res-
ignation to the Board of Regents. Miss
Hunt was an instructor in drawing and
has been with the University since 1899.
PROF. ANDERSON ABSENT FROM
ENGINEERING COLLEGE
Professor H. C. Anderson, head of the
mechanical engineering department, is in
Newark, New Jersey, testifying before the
Public Utilities Committee of the state in
a rate case involving the Public Service
Railway company. Professor Anderson was
employed by this company for two years
and a half, during which time he was on
leave of absence from the University.
FORMER STUDENTS RETURN TO
COLLEGE
Engineers are still returning from the
war to take up their courses in the Univer-
sity. Among those who have recently come
back are: G. E. Kunzee, '22E, who was
overseas; Ernest Nacgly, '19E, who was re-
cently discharged; Clifford Sparks, ex-'ipE,
who was a former football star; Richard
Chynoweth, ex-'ipE, will return for sum-


147
mer school. Captain Norman Peeble, '13E,
who was in France for eight months, vis-
ited the engineering department.
The returning men are taking up work
which they had not completed upon their
departure for war, and by finishing the
courses are receiving their credit in them.
RHODES SCHOLARSHIPS
Entrance examinations for Rhodes schol-
arships will hereafter be abolished accord-
ing to a circular issued by Frank Aydelotte,
American Secretary to the Rhodes trustees.
By the new ruling the candidate need only
make formal application signed by the au-
thorities of his college to be eligible for
appointment. In part the circular states
that after this year selections will be made
on points outlined in the Rhodes' will, which
are: scholarship, character, interest in out-
door sports, interest in one's fellows, and
instinct of leadership.
ENGINEERING AUTHORITIES
SPEAK AT CLUB DINNER
The annual dinner of the City Art and
Design Committee of the Twentieth Cen-
tury Club of Detroit which was held at
their club house on April 4th was attended
by several members of the faculties of the
colleges of Engineering and Architecture.
The affair took the form of a stirring meet-
ing to help put over the Belle Isle bridge
appropriation. Professor Lorch, dean of
the Department of Architecture and archi-
tect of the proposed bridge, made the prin-
cipal address, while Dean M. E. Cooley,
Professor H. E. Riggs, and Professor R.
M. Gram were honor guests.
MICHIGAN BAND ASSISTS IN LOAN
CAMPAIGNS
The Varsity band may well feel proud
of itself this year due to the fact that its
services have been sought on several oc-
casions to function in Victory Loan celebra-
tions. Early this spring the band jour-
neyed to Chicago where it assisted in gene-
rating "pep" at a meeting of seven hundred
and fifty Victory Loan county chairmen.
We conclude that the music makers must
have certainly made a good impression on
the Illinois delegation since all reports re-
ceived from Chicago vouch for the fact
that they acquitted themselves in fine style.
On April 19th the band left for a two
days engagement at Saginaw where it par-
ticipated in mass meetings launching the
Victory Loan campaign in that city. It
is needless to state that the organization
fulfilled all expectations.
Aside from these two out-of-town trips
the band has also been called upon to fur-
nish music at local mass meetings boosting
the Loan campaigns.
Alumni may feel assured that from the
standard of music furnished by this year's
organization, it may justly inherit the name
of its predecessors, "That Famous Michi-
gan Band."
PROSPECTS FOR R. O. T. C. NEXT
FALL
The establishment of a Coast Artillery
unit at the university next fall was dis-
cussed at a recent interview between
Colonel Jacobs of the regular army and
Professor H. E. Riggs, and it was decided
to appoint a committee to make an inves-
tigation concerning the matter. At the next
meeting of the board of regents the report
by this committee will be heard and it is
probable that some definite action will be
taken.
"Several branches of the service plan to
offer a four year course consisting of theory
and gymnastic drill in various collegiate
institutions," said Professor Riggs. "Those
courses offered by the Coast Artillery corps,
the Signal corps, and the Motor Transport
corps would be the ones for adoption at
the University."
The Signal corps section would be taken
under electrical engineering, the Coast Ar-
tillery unit under civil engineering, while
the Motor transport corps would be listed
in the Mechanical engineering curriculum.
According to General Orders 49 at least
one hundred men must be enrolled before
a R. O. T. C. unit may be formed. It is
planned that the work in connection with
these courses shall be purely academic in
character, except for short gymnastic drills


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
at periodical times, and that the men will
be required to wear uniforms unless the
faculty decides to the contrary. The course
will also include two and possibly three
summer camps which will probably be con-
ducted at the end of the freshman, sopho-
more, and junior years. At these camps,
the theory gained in the classroom will be
practiced.
Certain subjects will be required of the
men enrolling, which will include plane
and solid geometry, plane and spherical
trigonometry, college algebra, English, a
modern foreign language, college physics,
American history, general history, civics,
plane surveying, gunnery, and an intelli-
gent knowledge of the operation of the
slide rule.
The government will provide the material
and equipment for instruction, including
several types of guns and limbers.
CAMP DAVIS
In another month the Junior Civil engi-
neers will be swinging aboard north bound
trains, destined for Topinabee, Michigan,
where they will spend six weeks in the
wilds of Camp Davis.
It is here that the boys make lasting
friendships since the camp life reduces all
to a like plane of social standing. Here the
capitalist's son, accustomed to the finest of
luxuries, bunks alongside of his classmate
who may not have inherited as much
wealth. Here both eat from the same pine
table and both acquire a like coat of tan
under the blistering sun of northern Mich-
igan. At the close of their period at the
camp they will return to their work in Ann
Arbor with a real understanding of each
other and both will agree that his term
spent at Camp Davis was one of the hap-
piest of his college life.
ENGINEERING CLUB INCLUDES
SEVERAL FACULTY MEMBERS
At a gathering of many prominent engi-
neers at the Michigan Union on March
25th there was formed a new organization
to be known as the "Engineers' and Arch-
itects' Club," which is an outgrowth of the
old "Engineers' Club."
At the meeting a constitution was drafted
stating that the object of the club was "to
promote the social, economic and technical
interests of its membership, and to stimu-
late civic activity and public service."
Among the officers chosen were several
members of the engineering faculty of the
university, including Professors A. J.
Decker, W. T. Fishleigh, J. H. Cissel, L.
M. Gram, H. H. Higbee, W. H. Hoad, and
J. C. Parker.
Several topics of civic interest were
brought up, among which was the question
of metering the water supply of the city of
Ann Arbor. After Professor Hoad had
reported the results of his invesigation con-
cerning the matter a long discussion en-
sued, followed by the unanimous adoption
of a resolution approving the proposed sys-
tem.
Other subjects of civic interest discussed
were the proposed public utility commis-
sion and the so-called "Home Rule" bill for
the regulation of public utility corpora-
tions, which at present is before the Michi-
gan state legislature. Resolutions were
drawn up favoring the public utility bill
and authorizing a delegation composed of
Professors J. C. Parker, L. M. Gram, W.
C. Hoad, and Mr. G. S. Williams to ap-
pear before the legislative committee on
public affairs and urge the adoption of the
bill. This committee was also vested with
the right to protest against the passage of
the Home Rule Bill.
ENGINEERING BUILDING HAS
MOTOR EXHIBIT
Professor Walter T. Fishleigh of the
mechanical engineering deparment has as-
sembled a complete exhibit of many varie-
ties and types of automobile motors. This
exhibit is for the use of the students and
for public inspection.
Many parts of the various motors are
shown in sections so that their operation
and construction are made plain to the stu-
dent. There are also on exhibition dif-
ferent types of differentials, axles, trans-
missions, and other parts of an automo-
bile. Cam shafts and clutches are to be
found with complete ignition systems which


149
have been prepared so that they may be
operated and the entire system from mag-
neto to spark plug may be observed.
The Liberty motor which was formerly
used by the U. S. Training Detachment
has been retained by the engineering col-
lege to be used for instruction purposes.
MASS ATHLETICS
In realization of the growing need for
more students to participate in college ath-
letics than is now the case, several universi-
ties have co-operated to devise a new
branch of the sport This comes under the
name of Mass Athletics and as its name
suggests, it is to be a contest between the
mass of students from the various uni-
versities. Any man engaged in Varsity ath-
letics is ineligible to compete. Thus it is
seen that students who would otherwise
take no part in athletics will be given a
chance to represent the University.
The contest will be much the same as
our ordinary track meets, and will consist
of the broad jump, high jump, and various
dashes. The records of each of the two
hundred to three hundred men will be
taken and the University having the great-
est number of points will be acclaimed win-
ner.
This plan will be given its initial tryout
at Michigan some time this spring and its
success or failure at this time will deter-
mine whether or not it is going to be a
permanent feature of the athletic program.
TRACK
Michigan's hopes for a second successive
Western Conference championship in track
are most encouraging. With many veterans
exhibiting their old time form and re-en-
forced by excellent material from last year's
All Fresh squad, the Varsity team should
win the coveted track laurels of the middle
west again this spring.
In the two only meets staged during the
winter, Michigan added as many scalps to
its belt by defeating Chicago and Notre
Dame. The first of the outdoor meets in
which Michigan participated was held at
Des Moines on April 19th, when it met
some of the best teams in the middle west
in the Drake Relay Carnival. Michigan's
failure to win the meet caused much disap-
pointment on the campus but the fact the
defeat does not affect her standing in the
Conference serves as some consolation.
The apparent inability of Carl John-
son, Michigan's star, to get good starts
in the sprints cost him the price of
losing the 100 yard free-for-all and he
was forced to content himself with fourth
place in this event. That Johnson has lost
none of his speed is evidenced by his strong
finishes, but his failure to get away promptly
at the crack of the gun is a source of worry
to his coaches.
Two dual meets which will be staged on
Ferry field with Notre Dame and Chicago
some time during May are the next two
events which appear on Michigans track
calendar, and as the results of these meets
will figure strongly in the Western Con-
ference standings, track fans are eagerly
awaiting their arrivals.
THE PASSING OF THE OLD
SURVEYING BUILDING
In 1875 President Angell recommended
the construction of a temporary building to
be used as a hospital. He estimated that
the building might be used for a period of
five years. His plans were carried into ef-
fect and a hospital was erected on ground
now covered by the New Science Building.
The hospital was evidently designed for a
specific purpose for no person now familiar
with its plan is able to make a satisfactory
analysis of its architectural vagaries. The
building showed some signs of artistic in-
fluence, although experts may consider
them a rudimentary if not a trifling ele-
ment of design. The general plan, how-
ever, operated against any marked expres-
sion that would border on the ornate.
The building was used as a hospital for
more than twice its estimated life and then
dedicated to the Department of Dentistry as
a laboratory. It sheltered this department
until 1008, when it was moved from its
original site to ground immediately north of
the Engineering Building and occupied by
the Department of Surveying until June,
1918. The Engineering Building, planned


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
for six hundred students, had become so
crowded by 1908 that the Department of
Surveying could no longer be housed
therein. It is rumored that the building
lost some parts and gained others in its
journey across the campus and that when
it was finally put in place on the new site
its general appearance had changed in some
details. To those unacquainted with its
history, the building has always offered an
interesting study in arrangement of rooms
and general design. Professor Davis was
able to have some of his personal ideas in-
corporated in the plans for reconstruction.
When he was informed by experts in heat-
ing and ventilating that steam radiators
New View of the Enginfering Building
should be -placed on the floor not far from
the windows, he told them that when the
Lord created the earth He placed the heat-
ing plant overhead. Accordingly the coils
of steam pipe, which were substituted for
cast radiators, were placed near the ceiling.
The staff of the Surveying Department
appreciate the shelter that the building af-
forded for over ten years. The department
was faithful to the old building and work
was carried on there after floors, walls and
ceilings had parted company. The teaching
staff soon discovered where the roof leaked
during wet weather and where one might
exist, with the aid of overcoats and artics,
during the cold winter months.
While the wrecking of the building occa-
sions mixed feelings of regret and relief,
the Department of Surveying is inclined
to rejoice in sympathy with those who ad-
vocate the campus beautiful. Surveying is
housed temporarily in the Science Building
not far from the original site of the old
hospital and dental laboratory. Surveying
has always had temporary quarters and if
the destruction of its last home can be as-
sumed to be one of the necessary prelim-
inaries looking to the erection of a per-
manent building for the department, the
passing of this old landmark may symbol-
ize the rainbow of promise in disguise.

HIGHWAY LABORATORY TO TRY
EXPERIMENT NEVER AT-
TEMPTED BEFORE
Unproven theories in the line of re-in-
forced concrete bridge construction are
soon to be tested by the Highway laboratory
of the civil engineering department in an
experiment, such as has never before been
attempted. If successful an enormous an-
nual saving in the cost of bridge construc-
tion will be made possible.
To conduct the test a full sized bridge
slab, 16 feet square and carefully con-
structed of reinforced concrete was pre-
pared about a year ago and has since been
left to season. The slab has now been
supported by five 12-inch "I" beams and
preparations will soon be complete for the
test.
With the purpose in view of determining
whether or not such a type of construction
will support the greatest possible weight
that it might be subjected to, a highway
bridge pressure of 18 tons will be applied
by a hydraulic press. This is estimated as
a weight equal to the heaviest road roller.
If the experiment proves a success bridges
of this type will undoubtedly be installed
throughout the country.
Professors Cox, Gram, and Cissel, to-
gether with several of the senior engineers
are conducting the experiment. The ex-
pense is being assumed by the State High-
way Department.
While this is the most important work
of its kind ever carried on by the highway
laboratory, experiments of great impor-
tance to the future construction of good
roads are daily being conducted and it is
predicted that, in the course of a year, the
size and apparatus of the laboratory will
have to be doubled.

IF —
If you can keep your head when all about
you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt
you,
But make allowance for their doubting,
too:
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
Or being hated don't give way to hating,
And yet don"t look too good, nor talk too
wise;
If you can dream — and not make dreams
your master;
If you can think — and not make
thoughts your aim,
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two imposters just the
same:
If you can bear to hear the truth you've
spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for
fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to,
broken,
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-
out tools;
If you can make one heap of all your win-
nings
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-
toss,
And lose, and start again at your begin-
nings
And never breathe a word about your
loss:
If you can force your heart and nerve and
sinew
To serve your turn long after they are
gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in
you
Except the Will which says to them:
"Hold on!"
If you can talk with crowds and keep your
virtue,
Or walk with Kings — nor lose the com-
mon touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt
you,
If all men count with you, but none too
much:
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds' worth of distance
run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that's
in it,
And — which is more — you'll be a Man,
my son!

STATE BOARD EXAMINATION IN
ARCHITECTURE
During the April recess, the regular
spring examinations were held in Ann Ar-
bor by the Board for the Registration of
Architects. They were conducted in the
main drafting room of the College of
Architecture, and continued three days. A
half day was given to each of the follow-
ing: Steel Construction, Reinforced Con-
crete Construction, Design of a Truss, and
the Writing of Specifications.
On the last day twelve hours were given
to making a preliminary plan of a two
story building. This is the fourth year
that such examinations have been conduct-
ed. As usual the candidates comprised men
of all kinds and degrees of preparations,
some of them being college graduates,
others having had some technical training
and some having come up entirely through
the school of experience.
The standard of the examination is very
similar to that in other states, with a view
to ultimately having reciprocity as to credits
between the various states, thus to enable
those who have passed the examination
here, to register in other states without
re-examination.
It is worth noting that among the candi-
dates who have had no technical training,
a good proportion have passed all of the
examinations. Under the present act for
registration of architects, anyone twenty-
one years of age can take the examination
whenever he chooses, while under the new
joint act now under consideration at Lans-
ing, either six years experience or six
years combined experience and training will
be a prerequisite to taking the examination.
Under the joint bill, this requirement in
time will apply both to engineers and archi-
tects.
HOW THE ARCHITECT WORKS
William Duncan Cuthbert
The telephone bell rang one evening, and
a voice asked the writer if he could make
him some blue-prints. The matter warrant-
ed investigation, so an appointment was
made for a conference. The discussion
produced the information, that what was
desired was a set of architectural drawings
for a small house. The enquirer was famil-
iar with blue-prints; and his conception of
the process of making a set of working
drawings for a building, was based on the
drawing of white lines on blue paper in
some mysterious fashion.
There is indeed a great ignorance, even
among those who should be better informed,
of the efforts and processes involved in the
production of the drawings, which form
the basis of construction of any building.
An article on this subject appears not only
as a timely one but one of interest. Meth-
ods of procedure vary with the size of the
organization of the architectural office, and
this description will deal mainly with the
workings of a well-organized office; work-
ing on a "job" which would compare with
the average office, or hotel building of
eight or ten stories in height.
The most preliminary of preliminaries in
producing an architectural "job," is to get
the job. This article will assume that the
architect has received instructions from the
client to proceed with "sketches" and under
commonly accepted conditiones the job is
thus awarded to him. Sketches are pre-
liminary drawings, not available for con-
struction purposes. They set forth the
architect's conception of what the design of
the building should be; along with his
solution of the problem presented by the
requirements of the plan and are presented
for the client's approval. In the residence


'53
the necessities of the plan involve the de-
sired number of rooms, their size, and rela-
tion to each other. In commercial build-
ings there is the problem of a certain
financial return from each square foot of
area. Every job has its own individual re-
quirements to be met.
The "making" of sketches is an import-
ant operation; for upon their excellence
usually depends the early awarding of the
"commission" to "get out" the working
drawings. Many architects, even some with
a large amount of business, work out, per-
sonally, their rough sketches; some even
doing the actual work on the finished pro-
duct to present to the client. The architect
at the head of a large organization, how-
ever, usually has a designer, a man who is
in sympathy with his own architectural
tastes, and feeling, who handles the draw-
ing of the sketches working from the
description of the requirements and desires
he is provided with.
Through the medium of many discarded
"prelims," the final sketch scheme, or
schemes are produced. The plan conditions
have been met, and the elevation has the
right "character." The sketches are ar-
tistically drawn, and "rendered" in black
and white, or in color, with pencil or pen,
crayon or wpter color. Many times a pers-
pective is presented, either instead of, or
accompanying the elevation. On many large
competition jobs, a great amount of money
is often spent by the architect for "art
work," the rendering of the drawings by
professional artists.
After receiving the sketches the client
will study them for a few days; and with
the advice and counsel of the architect ar-
rive at a final decision in the matter of any
changes involved. At this point in the
negotiations the architect receives his "com-
mission;" he is authorized to proceed with
the preparation of the wroking drawings.
As an evidence of the agreement with
the client, some architects sign a plan con-
tract, which stipulates the amount of the
fees, and the time of payments. Other
architects ask the client to write a letter
corroborating and setting forth the agree-
ment entered into. Still others, with a
strong faith in the integrity of their fel-
low-men, and a strong adherence to the
ancient ethics of the profession, take the
client "at his word," and go ahead with the
plans on this basis. It is always desirable
to have a clear understanding of the
amount of fees and not assume that the
client knows standards.
The real work on the production of an
architectural job, now begins. The archi-
tect buys himself a cigar, and hurries back
to the office. Immediately there is a confer-
ence with the designer, the chief draftsman,
who is head of the architectural department,
the heads of the structural and mechanical
departments, the whole proposition is "laid
on the table," and the job is under way.
From now on the chief draftsman is the
guiding head of the job. The sketches are .
turned over to a responsible senior drafts-
man, who is furnished with two or three
assistants. The plans are laid out accurate-
ly to scale. The designer develops the de-
tails necessary for his design. The design
is restudied, and improved. Designs for
the treatment of the interior which have
had little attention thus far are developed.
Collaborating with the architectural depart-
ment, the structural men, having been fur-
nished with locations of walls, beams and
columns; supply the sizes of structural
members, which the architectural men must
work into the design. Simultaneously with
the other work, the mechanical men are
working out heating, ventilating, wiring and
plumbing lay-outs. It is the work of the
architectural department to co-ordinate the
work of all the departments, and to be re-
sponsible for the set of drawings as a
finished whole.
When the job is well under way the
specification writer is furnished with a set
of preliminary prints, and he commences
the draft of the specification. He is in
constant conference with the architectural
department in matters of constructive de-
tail, and kind and quality of material.
When his "copy" is completed it is turned
over to the typist who produces the "book."
In some offices, on large and important jobs
the specifications are printed by a printer,
and carefully bound, and titled.


154
The completed set of drawings consist of
the Architectural set, the Structural set,
and the Mechanical set. These drawings are
all prepared in ink on transparent tracing
cloth. It is from these tracings that blue-
prints are made; by a process fundamentally
similar to the making of photographic
prints.
The Architectural set consists of draw-
ings of floor plans and elevations at the
scale of one-eighth inch, or one-quarter
inch equals one foot; and various details
of exterior, and interior decoration and
construction at larger scales. On an aver-
age job as the type mentioned at the be-
ginning of the article, the architectural
sheets will number between thirty and forty.
The Structural set presents sheets of floor
. plans and details giving construction data,
sizes and types of members with methods
of framing. Structural sheets will number
about twelve to sixteen. The Mechanical
set shows the' heating lines, location of
radiators; ventilating ducts, vacuum cleaner
lines, as -well as many other items of me-
chanical and electrical '.equipment. The
number of sheets in this set will run from
eight to twelve.
The job is now ready to submit to the
contractors for an estimate of the. cost of
building. The lowest "bid" if from a thor-
oughly reputable contractor, and at a reas-
onable figure for good construction, is
usually accepted.
This article will leave the subject here.
The job is about to be built, and to come
under the more direct control of the super-
intending department. As the work pro-
ceeds the Architectural department furn-
ishes full-size details of the profiles of
mouldings, and of ornament. On important
ornament, models are submitted by the ar-
tisan for aproval, before the final work is
executed.
The final drawings produced by the ar-
chitect's office are the full-size details, and
these will number between thirty and forty
sheets, on a job such as we are discussing.
The erection and completion of the build-
ing, the payment of contractors, the settle-
ment of disputed claims, have not been
touched upon, and these are all big factors
in the production of the job.
NOTES ON THE ARCHITECTURE OF
NEW ORLEANS
By Wells Bennett
Southern architecture stands, to many
Northerners, for a certain picture, an image
of a stately mansion, especially marked by
a lofty portico, with a setting of suitably
venerable live-oaks and flower-laden olean-
ders. Further than this general idea, de-
rived from a widespread knowledge of
certain famous examples, relatively few
have ventured. There are, however, struct-
ural mannerisms that set off Southern ar-
chitecture from that with which we are
familiar and divides into more or less dis-
tinct groups Southern architecture itself.
Of these groups New Orleans is one. This
city and its locality, settled as they were
by French and Spanish, obtained their
traditions directly from France and Spain,
and, from its isolated position with regard
to the Eastern settlements, had little com-
munication with what we understand by
Colonial architecture. Upon these directly
European precedents, then, there have been
only those changes made necessary by the
development of a different mode of life in
a semi-tropical country.
Wood was necessarily the first building
material, superceded, as the colony pros-
pered, by brick, usually stuccoed, sometimes
painted. The dampness of brick walls, how-
ever, has since made wood the prime favor-
ite. The larger Southern houses owe no
small art of their charm to widespread,
rambling plans, with adjoining negro quar-
ters. In plantation homes these quarters
were sometimes well removed but in a
typical New Orleans of the "Vieux Carre,"
the housing for servants was separated
from the main house only by a court. Both
structures had a face on the street line,
connected by the high court wall. This lat-
ter, curved down to a central carriage gate,
the whole group forming an architectural
composition of great interest.
Basements, as we know them, are the
exception. Houses are sometimes raised so
that the first living floor is eight or ten feet
above the ground, leaving underneath a
basement with floor at grade. This eleva-
tion of the living floor affords relief from
the prevalent dampness and, as the space


155
under the first floor is kept as open as
possible, the free circulation of air makes
the house cooler in summer. This end is
also sought in the use of high ceilings.
The principal device for protection from the
sun, however, in terms of architectural
effect, is the balcony or gallery. These
galleries, frequently running entirely around
the house and carried through two stories,
are the striking feature of domestic archi-
tecture in Southern Louisiana. The balcon-'
ies and galleries with their floors, posts and
balustrades were first built in wood, de-
veloped with great delicacy in wrought iron,
then carried out floridly in cast iron, and, in
the American regime finally took on the
forms of the Classic Revival. This feature
thus runs a gamut of materials and forms,
each indicating the spirit of its period.
In the treatment of windows the South-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
eruers again followed climatic dictation.
Blinds, either solid or slatted, are, in the
early work, almost universial. Indeed, to
a stranger the residence streets of New
Orleans appear to be uninhabited, so closely
are the windows shuttered. The observer,
however, will note that in many cases a
long hook enables blinds to be swung part
way open, and the detection of an occasional
housewife peeping out assures him that the
houses are really occupied. In recent build-
ing, awnings and projecting caves are sub-
stituted for blinds with a great consequent
gain in airiness and cheed fulness.
These more obvious features of grouping,
balcony and window treatment only suggest
the elements that make New Orleans archi-
tecture unique. Modern residences have
taken on the guise of the Eastern Colonial,
English and other styles. In occosional in-
stances architects are seeing the real op-
portunity and are adapting appropriate ar-
chitectural forms to modern living require-
ments.
NOTES
An interesting exhibit of public school
art work was shown in the main gallery of
Alumni Memorial Hall, April 2, 3 and 4.
It was made up almost entirely of designs
made by children in various degrees of ad-
vancement, in the grade and high schools
of the State. It was collected by a com-
mittee of the drawing section of the School-
masters' Club, under the chairmanship of
Miss Agnes Van Buren, a teacher of design
and drawing in the Grand Rapids schools.
Flint, Kalamazoo, Detroit, Grand Rapids
and other cities are represented.
Many interesting pieces, showing great
variety of subject, letter and color scheme
were shown; color studies built up from
colored paper, which proves a most satis-
factory medium for decorative work; dec-
orative designs, both naturalistic and ab-
stract in character, represented by means
of stencils, in exactly the same way as a
decorative scheme in a room or hall; de-
signs made for printing from wood blocks.
The wood blocks have been cut by the
students and then printed, on paper, paper
crash and other textiles. We also find color
and design study, as applied to costumes;
a great variety of designs which could be
used for wall paper, burlaps, gowns, cur-
tains; in other words, a splendid demons-
tration of the value of design in life.
The exhibition demonstrated that children
in the public schools may develope. in an
elementary way, grasp of one of the most
valuable activities which lies at the base of
industry,—all those kinds of production
which have to do with stuffs for both
clothing and furnishing the home, and in-
deed, every attempt to make the necessary
objects of life more interesting. There are
occasionally persons who look upon art as
a fad, not remembering that this country
has, indirectly, paid large sums to those
foreign institutions that trained the de-
signers who make the imported object so
valuable. No country more than France has
grasped the value of public instruction in
these subjects, as a means for giving her
the markets of the world. Her example
and success point the way for the United
States and demonstrate the necessity of
schools of design for the training of talent-
ed young men and women to help further
production and commerce as well as pro-
vide a field of employment for creative
ability.
A selective number of decorative panels,
the gift of Mr. Booth, '22A have recently
been hung in the main drafting room. •
Several valuable paintings, the work of
Mr. L. A. Makielski and Mr. Barnes, both
of the architecture free-hand drawing de-
partment, have been displayed in the ex-
hibition room. A few present local natural-
istic subjects, which won warm student.ad-
miration, while others are partial studies,
display that mixture of freedom and skill,
which is real genius. The Detroit News
favored Mr. Barnes with an article con-
cerning his conception of art and repro-
duced his "Winters Trail on the Boulevard."
Professor Lorch, in conjunction with
severaly eminent engineering faculties, is
lending the designer's knowledge toward
the successful completion of Detroits $3,-
ocoooo bridge to the island.
The decorations of the architectural cor-
rider so disturbed the artistic sensibilities

of Ben Hertie, that immediately on ex-
pression of his indignation, he was ap-
pointed chairman of a Clean Up and Decor-
ative Committee. As a result the Seniors
are bereft of a drafting room, and with pil-
fered panels from the free-hand drawing
room, and selected "A" plates from the
archives, it is gradually being converted
into what promises to be a permanent ex-
hibition room.
Can you imagine it? The gentler Sex
suggesjt a "Smock" dance! jSomdthing
unique in costume colors should be present,
and just think fellows, we would scarcely
have to leave our own domain for pretty
partners. "But I suppose you fellows, who
get your inspiration at the Society Rooms
must have a smocker,"—thus they speak.
As we are going to press, Leo Hosmen,
—President of the Architectural Society
and 19 Architects,—announces that another
trip is planned to Detroit to study the Pot-
ter's art and sketch tapestries at the Art
Museum.
The benifits to be derived from the trips
cannot be over estimated, as the explana-
tion of a guide or workman coupled with
an architect's observation, impresses a fact
in a fraction of the time spent on library
articles. Let us not regret,—Let's go.
Mr. Nugent of the honor committee, at
the last meeting of the society explained
the methods used by the Honor Committee
on reported violations of the system. Since
architects taking examinations in the En-
gineering Department come within their
jurisdiction,— (unless requesting proctors,)
—it was the consenses of opinion that we
should be duly represented on same com-
mittee. This matter and the question of
class elections at the usual spring date in-
stead of October, will be handled by ap-
pointees in charge.

OBITUARY
The Captain
(An apostrophe and appreciation in mem-
ory of Captain Lawrence H. Bertsch,
written by his kinsman, Rev. H. D. Herr,
of Farragut, Iowa.)
Young artisan, so skilled and true,
When Freedom's bugle summoned you
You dropped your compass, scroll and rule
And every geometric tool
Creative genius can command,
With which you traced with cunning hand
Inventions from your teeming brain,
That fiery molds and foundry strain
Might bring them to mechanic birth
And iron angels give to earth: —
These tools of peace you laid aside
And marched away and for us — died.
Your years till noon were bright and true,
And who shall dare to pity you?
You had the starry eyes of youth
And had the sunny heart of truth;
By courage counseled — not by fears,
You lived in deeds and not in years;
So gentle and so masterful,
A captain with persuasive rule,
Commissioned first by Nature's hand
And later by Your native land,
You wore the khaki and the straps
Till God's good angel sounded taps.
So manly, generous and true,
You heard the trumpet Freedom blew
And with a firm, undaunted wilf
You offered genius' heart and skill,
And on the service of war
There shines for you a golden star;
Hearts at attention will remain
While memory views the funeral train
That bore you to a patriot's grave,
Wrapped in the flag you died to save,
And when reveille Peace shall play
We'll you salute — at break of day.
So Willing, worth, real and true,
What high reward has greeted you;
With martyr, patriot and sage,
Cross bearers in each clime and age,
You hold high converse in the skies,
Earth's history view with Christ-lit eyes;
Prophetic patterns there you trace
Of what shall be the glorious place
Of Freedom's lands, and chiefly yours,
So long as Liberty endures,
And seeing this you are content,
And we, on earth, soothe our lament.
Spencer Thorndyke Alden, who was in
the engineering college from 1913 to 1915,
enlisted in the U. S. Naval Mosquito Fleet,
coast patrol, April 12, 1917. The first of
September of the same year he resigned
from the coast patrol in favor of Naval
Aviation. He was commissioned an ensign
April 15, 1918. Ten days later he was
made commander of the coast patrol, and
expert instructor. About a month after
this promotion he was killed in an aero-
plane accident at Great South Bay, N. Y.
Stanley Roy Augspuger received a de-
gree of Bachelor of Science in forestry in
1917. He enlisted as a private in Com-
pany D in the 20th Engineers, a company
all men of which were well versed in for-
estry. He was on his way to France Feb.
55, 1918, when the U. S. S. Tuscania upon
which he was sailing was sunk, and he was
drowned off the coast of Scotland.

ARCHITECTURE
Building operations have been so nearly
at a standstill during the past two years
that there is now a serious shortage in
some classes of buildings. As a conse-
quence, architects' offices are now very
busy and are finding it difficult to get a
sufficient number of trained architectural
men. This means men who are skilled in
planning, designing and detailing of build-
ings, as well as able to do the structural
work pertaining to them. Men who have
had a good, all around architectural educa-
tion and have had some experience would
readily find positions. There are many
more vacancies now than there are men
to fill them. One office alone is asking for
three designers! The most fortunate men
will be those who are now ready to make
the most of the opportunity, whether as
designers, draftsmen, superintendents, or
in the occasional larger opening which often
implies a combination of all of these. Prof.
Lorch.
H. L. Stevens Co., 30 N. Michigan Ave.,

EMPTY THOUGHTS
The school instructor was teaching a
class in which there were some foreign
pupils whose vocabularies were not very
extensive.
"Now," he said, pointing to one of them,
"tell me what is a vacuum?"
The pupil thought hard for a moment,
and then answered: "I have it, in my
head, sir, but I can't express it."
AN UP-TO-DATE PUPIL
Teacher—"Name the five zones."
Pupil — "Temperate, intemperate, war,
postal, and o."
A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
"Look Red; I weigh three pounds more
than you do."
"Aw, you're cheatin'; You've got your
hands in your pockets." L. H. J.
THAT CLEVER BOY
The inspector was asking the class a few
questions.
"Now, how do bees dispose of their
honey?" he inquired.
"Please, sir, they cell it," announced the
clever boy of the class.
Soph—"I always smoke Camels after
dinner."
Ditto—"How's that?"
Soph—"You know they go so good on a
desert."
GETTING A RISE
"I tell you," snorted the old lady who
had just arrived at the hotel, getting quite
angry, "I won't have this room. I ain't
going to pay my money for a pigsty; and
as for sleeping in one of them beds, I sim-
ply won't do it."
"Get on in, mum,'' said he. "This ain't
your room; it's the elevator."
so:
The sailor had just told the old lady in
the train what his share in the Great War
was.
"In a submarine!" she exclaimed. "How
nice and what do you do?"
"Well, mum, I runs for'ard and tips her
down when we want to dive."
THAT RISING SUN
An old lady who lived on the coast went
to visit her son, who was in a Navy yard.
They were walking along one of the streets
in the evening when all of a sudden there
was a loud bang.
"Good heavens!" she exclaimed. "What
was that?"
"It's all right, mater," said the boy. "It's
only sunset."
"Sunset!" she ejaculated. "Well, I've
lived by the sea all my life, and I've never
heard the sun go down with a bang like
that before."
Mrs. Youngbride—"Our cook says those
eggs you sent yesterday were quite old."
Grocer—"Very sorry madam. They were
the best we could get. You see all the
young chickens were killed off for the holi-
day trade, so the old hens are the only ones
left to do the layin'."
AIN'T IT THE TRUTH?
Gas goes up, steel prices leap,
Sky high go our 'phone calls,
The cost of eats rises day by day,
Only Niagara Falls.
"EXTRA DRY"
"I raise my glass," the President said.
Said Poincare, "Say no more;
But raise it high,
And drink it dry—
For at home you'll get no more."

MODERN MIRACLES
Brown and Green were conversing to-
gether recently, and their arguments finally
occasioned a bet between them. Each
agreed to tell a peculiar incident, and the
reciter of the strongest episode was to re-
ceive the stakes. Brown commenced, and
said he knew a lady who was "turned into
wood." "Impossible," said Green; "explain
yourself!" "You see," was the reply, "the
lady was placed on a vessel and then she
was a-board!" "Very good," said Green;
"but listen to this! Once I knew a man
who had been deaf and dumb for twenty
years, but last week he regained speech in
one minute." "Nonsense," said Brown;
"but proceed I" "Well," replied Green, "the
man I mean went into a bicycle shop with
a friend and stooping down, he picked up a
wheel and 'spoke'!"
Who will fix the price of money? It now
takes twelve eggs to buy eighty-seven cents.
HIS DODGE
After Patsy Hogan had left Dublin for
the country, and rented a cottage with a
small back yard, he returned to town and
purchased a monkey. Not a word of his
scheme would he disclose to his old cronies.
But afterwards he explained. "'Twas like
this: I chained the monkey to a shtick in
me yard, and the coal thrains were passin'
all day, and on iv'ry thrain there was a
stoker. In one week I had two tons of coal
in me cellar, and the monkey was never
wanst hit!"
STRICTLY SPEAKING
"Father," said the sharp small boy, "I
saw a deaf and dumb beggar in the street
this morning, and he had an impediment in
his speech."
"A deaf and dumb man with an impedi-
ment in his speech!" exclaimed Father.
"Don't talk nonsense, Lancelot."
"But he had, Father," insisted the boy;
"one of his middle fingers was missing."
TRAGIC
In a small village in Ireland the mother
of a soldier met the village priest, who
asked her if she had had bad news.
"Shure, I have," she said. "Pat has been
killed."
"Oh, I am very sorry," said the priest.
"Did you receive word from the War
Office?"
"No," she said, "I received word from
Pat himself."
The priest looked perplexed, and said:
"But how is that?"
"Shure," she said, "here is the letter, read
it for yourself."
The letter said: "Dear Mother—I am
now in the Holy Land."
ANOTHER WAR SUBSTITUTE
Willie—"Mamma, you hire a woman to
do your washing, don't you?"
Mamma—"Yes."
Willie—"Then I don't see why I can't
hire a little boy to take my baths for me."

THE U. S. S. "New Mexico," the first
battleship of any nation to be electri-
cally propelled.Is one of the most important
achievements of the scientific age. She not
only develops the maximum power and,
with electrical control, has greater flexi-
bility of maneuver, which
is a distinct naval advan-
tage, but also gives greater
economy. At 10 knots, her
normal cruising speed, she
will steam on less fuel than
the best turbine-driven
ehlp that preceded her.

PROFESSOR A. H. LOVELL
This is a lecture given by Professor
A. II. Lovell, formerly Lieut. Col.
2,10th Engineers and Colonel, yd En-
gineer Training Regt. By permission
of the Chief of Engineers.—Editor.
In April, 1917, the Engineer Corps
was in size but 1.6 percent of the
Army. The ever-increasing demands
for technically trained men brought
this percentage up until it reached 10.8
per cent in November, 1918, and the
proportional percentage of Engineer
troops in France was about 20 per cent
greater than that of the Army as a
whole. While the whole Army in-
creased in size 19 1-2 times the en-
gineer troops grew to a number 131 1-2
times their original strength.
Each infantry division (27.865
men) includes one engineer regiment
(1,697 men) and one engineer train
(84 men). When six divisions are
united to form an army corps extra
engineer regiments are added accord-
ing to the work required, these regi-
ments being called corps troops.
Each engineer regiment consists of
a headquarters detachment and 2 bat-
talions of 3 companies of 250 men
each. Each company is furnished with
4 tool wagons, (limber and ca-
isson type) rolling kitchen, water cart
and mule pack train, permitting its
division into 4 platoons, each capable
of performing independently all ord-
inary engineering work. The engin-
eer train includes both animal-drawn
and motor vehicles, providing a mobile
depot of engineer tools, materials, and
supplies. There are approximately
6,600 items in the engineer sapper
equipment. Thirteen of the tool wag-
ons included in the engineer train are
intended for use in supplying tools
and materials to the infantry of the
division for intrenching purposes.
The commanding officer of the en-
gineer sapper regiment and train with
each division also carries the duties
of Division Engineer, and the regiment
performs the engineering work requir-
ed by its division in the field. The men
are armed with rifles and fight as in-
fantry in cases of grave emergency.
In addition to the engineers proper,
called "sappers" in the service, there
are infantry pioneers and personnel
detailed on engineer service. These
units are intended to relieve the highly
specialized sappers and the infantry
from the pioneer work incident to
movement, especially the necessity of
performing rough work with assault-
ing waves. At other times they assist
the sappers acting as detailed labor,
and should perform the unskilled
engineer work in preference to the
specialized sappers.
Engineer Functions: The primary
function of the engineers is to spread
the benefit of their special knowledge,
equipment, and training, over the field
of greatest possible usefulness, giving
preference, among tasks of equal mili-
tary importance, to those presenting
the greatest technical difficulties. In
emergencies, or in the absence of suf-
ficient troops of other arms, the task
of lighting will fall to the sappers,
which therefore becomes the second-
ary function of the engineer person-
nel.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
In the recent war the most impor-
tant functions of the engineer service
were:—
i. Rendering assistance and advice
as to the location of sites for field
fortifications.
2. Laying out field fortifications
of all kinds.
3. Construction of such elements
of field fortifications as require spec-
ial equipment or special knowledge
and skill, e. g. deep dugouts, observa-
tion posts, machine gun emplacements,
important entanglements, dressing sta-
tions, important elements of drainage
systems, bridges, mining, etc. (For-
tification work not requiring the as-
sistance of the engineers is normally
done by the troops which garrison the
works.)
4. Assistance to the infantry and
artillery in construction of field forti-
fications.
5. Such surveys and map making
as is necessary incidental to other en-
gineer operations and other map work
directly assigned. (Map making in
general is performed by engineer per-
sonnel under the direct supervision of
the intelligence Section (G-2) of gen-
eral staff and is not usually a part of
the engineer service.)
6. Provision and operation of
searchlights.
7. Construction and maintenance
of barracks, quarters, hospitals, stor-
age facilities, port work, and shelter
in general.
8. Standard gauge, railroad con-
struction and maintenance.
9. Construction and operation of
light railways.
10. Highway construction.
11. Water supply installation and
sewage disposal.
12. Electrical and mechanical in-
stallation and maintenance incident to
fortifications and shelters.
13. Provision of all engineer
stores, tools, and supplies needed in
any part of the enginer service. (This
includes construction and administra-
tion of depots, storehouses, dumps,
the provision and operation of shops
for fabrication and repairs, and for-
estry operations for the procurement
of the necessary lumber.)
14. Camouflage (provision of ma-
terials and supervision in their use.)
Any engineering work is of no value
unless it is accomplished so as to serve
the military purpose for which it was
designed. It must be carried out with
the fullest knowledge of the military
situation and time is the only true ec-
onomy. Unless ready when needed,
the structure may be of no value. Con-
sideration of money has no place in
military calculations. Operations of
division engineers as a consequence
will usually have to be undertaken
with insufficient and extemporized
means, with often only those supplies
and materials which are immediately
available at the site, and the work
must generally be done under the en-
emy's fire and always with the greatest
dispatch.
Foot Bridges: The engineers us-
ually encounter some very hot work
in constructing foot bridges for the
infantry to cross and attack on the op-
posite side of a stream. These will
be made of a multitude of materials,
anything which comes handy near the
site selected for the crossing. In Au-
gust, 1918, B and C Co.'s of the 6th
Engrs. constructed two foot bridges
across the Vesle for the 6th Brigade,
both built under fire, in front of their
own infantry, and without their as-
sistance or support.


175
Pontoon Bridges: If the standard
light pontoon train of the engineers can
be used, i. e. boats made by lashing
canvas covers on wooden frames, 185
feet of bridge can be made ready for
carrying cavalry and light loads. Fre-
quently German pontoon material was
available and could be used and even
French wine barrels were pressed into
service in the light bridge across the
Marne at Vincelles.
The American heavy pontoon divis-
ion consists of wooden boats, and 225
bridging of the Rhine by the First
Engineers in forty-one minutes, which
is more than four times as fast as the
Germany Army ever did it. The bridge
was a pontoon bridge 1,450 feet long.
Permanent Bridges: As soon as the
advance permitted, permanent bridges
followed the temporary structures.
Due to their ease of construction pile
and trestle bridges were largely used.
Portable, demountable, metallic
bridges were much used by the British
during the war and to a slight extent
Mouth of a 155 mm. Gun Thru Its Camouflage
ft. of bridge can be made in 19 min-
utes ready for heavy mobile artillery
traffic. It can be dismanteled in less
than 14 minutes. These were arrang-
ed so that the bridges could support a
load of 15 tons on one axle and a crew
of 30 men in addition. Captured Ger-
man pontoons were used, however, in
much of the bridge work in the Amer-
ican advance as in the bridge at Jaul-
gonne, France, built by the 6th Engrs.
and another bridge at Mezy, France.
Dispatches from Coblenz tell of the
by the French. In addition to all
kinds of bridge timber carried in the
American engineer dumps, there was a
supply of steel bridges made up in sec-
tions so that they could be transported
on trucks and bolted together in
the field. These bridges could carry
the 30-ton tanks and were extensively
used to replace destroyed structures.
Experience showed, that it was un-
safe to have main highway bridges
which were incapable of carrying the
maximum military loads. Whether


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
warning signs were posted or not such
bridges were standing invitations to
drivers of heavy vehicles to try them
out. In one instance a tank broke
through a bridge and thus left a body
of cavalry on the wrong side of the
stream to be ultimately captured by
the enemy. All bridges, therefore, if
material could be obtained, were con-
structed to take the heaviest loads, in-
cluding tanks. The latter impose a
load of 45 tons (including 50 per cent
for impact) which is about three times
that imposed by a continuous string
of heavily loaded motor trucks and
about the same as that imposed by a
continuous string of the heaviest mo-
bile artillery.
The bridge over the Meuse at Ste-
nay is probably a typical example.
Reconnaissance was made by Lt. Col.
Duller, 310th Engrs., and a party under
shell fire from 7 to 10:30 a. m., Nov.
nth. It was found that 6 bridges in
the viaduct, about 45 feet each, one
across the river, 160 feet, and 2 canal
bridges were all completely demolish-
ed. In all there were 510 feet of
bridging gone. There was no material
on the ground and the division was to
cross on the 16th. Lumber was picked
up from German dumps and heavy
iron beams secured by tearing down a
large factory nearby, so that construc-
tion began on the 13th. Three and a
half companies of engineers completed
the bridges at 6:30 p. m., Nov. 15th,
ready for heavy traffic, and the divis-
ion crossed on time. The 310th En-
gineers with the Russian Expedition
had to design a 50-ft. truss for con-
struction from 8-inch round timber,
that being the only material available.
Highway Construction: Macadam
and plank roads were the two prin-
cipal types in general military use in
France, with cordurov used occasion-
ally, though the latter are impracticable
for continuous heavy motor traffic.
In the forward areas roads had been
out of use for almost four years and
were cut from end to end by shell
holes, mine craters and trenches and
were generally but glorified cesspools.
Such was the case at Seicheprey at the
opening of the St. Mihiel push where
the Sixth Engineers found transpor-
tation completely blocked. After
marching all night on the roads this
regiment manhandled the vehicles,
ditched the most heavily loaded ones,
lightened the loads, made emergency
repairs, and in two hours had traffic
moving. At the end of 48 hours con-
tinuous building by the regiment under
an endless chain of trucks, troops and
wagons, the road passed traffic faster
than it was fed to it.
Railroads (Standard): 1303 con-
solidated standard guage locomotives
were shipped to France and enough
cars were sent so that if put end to end
they would extend 140 miles. By July
of this year there would have been 682
miles of cars. Many large railway
yards were built and many cut-offs
and improvements carried out.
Railroads (Narrow Guagc): For
the narrow gauge railroad used in
combat areas a special type of track
is used which consists of short sec-
tions of rail bolted to steel cross ties.
Only gasoline engines are used in the
forward areas as smoke from the ex-
haust or a flash of light from the fire-
box door would draw shell fire in-
stantly. The cost of hauling material
by the narrow gauge is about one-
seventh of that of hauling by trucks.
General Construction: The French
Government originally placed at our
disposal twenty-three ship berths with
the understanding that these were to
be increased by new construction as


177
rapidly as possible. Cargo shipments
grew from 20,000 tons in July, 1917, to
750,000 tons in October, 1917, and
eventually to 1,000,000 tons in No-
vember, 1918, and the engineers kept
pace by building docks, erecting un-
loading machinery and warehouses to
meet the increasing demands. When
hostilities ceased the American Ex-
pedition was using 8q ship berths and
160 would have been ready by June,
1919.
mately ninety per cent completed at the
time hostilities were suspended. As
an example of the speed of construc-
tion in this work the performance of
two working parties of the engineers
at Gievres is reported in the Stars and
Stripes. Sergeants Kenney and Doug-
las, arguing about the virtues of their
own outfits as builders, finally made a
200-franc wager that each outfit could
build a warehouse faster than the
other. Now a type C warehouse is

portation projects, there were demands
for cantonments, hospitals, air depots,
remount depots and storage facilities.
On December I, 1918, the authorized
construction project totalled 20,000,000
square feet of covered storage; 10,-
500,000 square feet of barracks, mess
halls, etc., in divisional areas; 8,500,-
000 square feet of miscellaneous con-
struction, such as air service shops,
hangars, warehouses, remount depots,
and veterinary hospitals; and hos-
pital accommodations for 260,000 pa-
tients. This program was approxi-
294 feet long, 50 feet wide, has twen-
ty-one bays in it, is roofed and has the
ends closed in with corrugated iron
plates, every one of which must be
nailed to the rafters. Each working
party of 62 men started when the
judges called time and in eight and a
half working hours 124 men had con-
structed two warehouses 294 feet long.
Each crew knew they had won the
bet, but the judges called it a tie, so
in order to show their appreciation of
each other the contending parties
pulled otT a roast pig banquet in the
mess shack.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Camouflage: This embraces not
only the concealment of everything
used in military operations—trenches,
gun emplacements, military trains, ma-
chines of all sorts, observation points,
horses and men,—but in making dum-
my trenches, gun emplacements, bridg-
es, etc. Concealment was first obtained
by employment of natural materials
at hand, such as branches of trees,
foliage, grass, etc., and, second, di-
rect painting of the objects to be con-
more economical material was devel-
oped here to replace it.
Forestry: For producing lumber
and timber products for the A. E. F.
there were shipped to France 46 log-
ging locomotives, 550 log cars, 200
miles of rail and 600 complete small
type saw mills with accessory log-
ging outfits. The output of sawed
lumber for October was 50,000 board
feet and would have increased to 100,-
000 board feet for January, 1919.
Road in the Valley of the Meuse Camouflaged
to Hide Troop Movements
cealed was adopted. This may con-
sist of painting the objects to resemble
the surrounding landscape, or in brok-
en color tones which cause an object
at ordinary distances of observation
to show very indistinctly and gradual-
ly disappear.
Screens are made of painted canvas
or burlap, raffia on wire netting, etc.
The camouflage factory at Dijon, em-
ployed 100 soldiers and 900 French
women, and produced 50,000 square
yards of camouflage cover daily. The
supply of burlap in Europe and the
United States was exhausted and a
The cord wood output was 80,000
cords. Standard gauge railway ties
produced would build 1,000 miles of
single track road, and the total length
of piling was 435 miles.
Demolitions: In their retreat the
German engineers constantly created
obstacles to delay the Allied advance
by destroying bridges, blocking roads,
demolishing railroads, mining struc-
tures and cross roads, building "boobv
traps" and snares, etc., all of which
the Allied engineers had to uncover
and repair ready for a rapid advance.
At the Vesle a favorite device of the


179
Bodies was to put wire in the river
bed to prevent wading supplemented
by mines. Then they kept the river
under artillery fire and drenched it
with gas. Under these conditions the
engineers would work on their bridges
in darkness or in moonlight. The
Hun spent much time on his traps and
they were quite varied in character.
The Stars and Stripes tells of one
chateau in a town quitted by the
Boche which blew up with a bang
after the Americans had occupied the
50 foot strand of wire to the handle
and from this distance, yanked it out
of the ground. A mine blew a 10 foot
hole in the middle of the road.
General Combat Conditions: Large
numbers of small tools and a vast
amount of construction material were
used by the engineers in the fortifica-
tion work. Daylight reconnaissance
in front of the infantry to locate their
line and nightly expeditions in front
to wire in the position are ordinary
rounds of duty for the sapper. Such
German Dugout Used as First Aid Station
village a couple of days. The explos-
ives had evidently been detonated by
a timing device. But as it was the
only unharmed building in the town,
the Americans, with the suspicion of
experience, had given it a wide berth.
From beneath the cellar of a chateau
the engineers dug 16 kegs of powder
after carefully disconnecting a trip
wire connected with the front door
step.
An engineer sergeant came upon a
German sword sticking in the bank
at the side of the road. He tied a
work used about 4,000,000 posts for
wire, 132,000 tons of barbed wire,
over 3,000,000 shovels, 2,000,000
picks, 22,000,000 sand bags, etc. In
this connection the sapper generally
mixes very intimately in the fight. On
the morning of Oct. 20, two and one-
half companies of the 6th Engineers
were told off to support a Bn. of
infantry in an attack against Claire
Chenes, the key to Hill 299, carrying
tools and wire to consolidate the posi-
tion after it was won. In the attack
the infantry were mowed down and


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
dissipated by murderous machine gun
tire from the Boche nests in Claire
Chenes, Hois, de Rappes and Rois de
Floret. The sappers dropped wire and
tools, pushed through the infantry and
captured the northern edge of the
woods. Here the thin engineer line
found itself fired on from front,
flanks, and even from rear, where
some Boch.es had filtered in behind
them. So. Capt. Littlejohn turned his
men round and they fought out again.
Directed by the infantry colonel in
charge to retake the Claire Chenes,
Capt. Littlejohn reformed his sur-
vivors, about ioo men, and with six
infantry men charged again. They
carried the woods completely, dug
themselves in and held the position un-
til relieved by infantry of the 5th Di-
vision seven days later.
In the advance of the 2nd Division
on July 17, 1919, from the Forest de
Yillers-Cotterets to Vierzy after
marching all night in heavy rain
through the forest the infantry double-
timed two or three kilometers in order
to reach their jumping off place and
attacked at 4:35 a. m. on the 18th.
Without food and almost without
water all day they drove in two kilo-
meters by 8 p. m., and captured Vier-
zy. Next morning the 2nd Engineers,
after digging all night, advanced
through the remnants of the 9th Inf.,
6th Marines and 23rd Inf., and at 7
o'clock drove forward again more
than two kilometers to Tigny where
they were stopped. They entrenched
here and aided by the machine gun
Bn. held all their gains. The Divis-
ion was now less than half strength
and had received no cooked food since
the night of the 16th, but had advanc-
ed eight kilometers in 26 hours. When
the famous 42nd Division pushed the
Germans across the Ourcq River and
pursued them toward the Yesle the
117th Engineers under Colonel Kelly
had the right flank on the front line,
replacing the exhausted 168th Infan-
try.
Again in the Russian campaign the
officers and men of A Company of the
310th Engineers assisted the infan-
try in action, bringing up machine
guijs on a road swept by heavy artill-
ery fire, and fighting very gallantly.
Searchlights: Anti-aircraft light
had to be developed, and a searchlight
equally as strong as the heavy 60 inch
seacost light was developed, weighing
less than one-ninth as much. The ef-
fective range of a searchlight used in
detecting airplanes is practically 12,-
000 feet, at which distance the vis-
ibility is 85 per cent.
Map Reproduction: This United
States department in France was said
to be the largest among the Allies.
The 29th Engineers with a printing
and lithograph plant on a five-ton
truck have turned out 10,000 copies of
field maps an hour. The British and
French have used a railway train and
their best output has been 300 copies
an hour. In some operations every
man in a trench raid party has been
furnished with a map of the Sector
involved.
Water Supply: The engineers in-
vestigate, locate, and mark all suitable
sources of water supply, improving
them and arranging watering points
for animals, supply points and baths
for men, storage tanks for railroads,
etc. In mobile warfare, the following
amounts of water are desirable :—one
gallon per man per day (cooking and
drinking) four to ten gallons per an-
imal per day, depending on whether
it is cold or hot weather.
Sound and Flash Ranging: This
most interesting work was done by the
74th Engineers, highly trained men
with skill and knowledge of sensitive
instruments which they used under
most trying circumstances. They were
trained by Lieut. Col. Trowbridge,


181
formerly professor of physics at
Princeton; Maj. Lyman, former pro-
fessor of physics at Harvard, and
Capt. Bazzoni, a prominent American
physicist.
The sound ranging sections, by de-
tecting the roar of the enemy guns,
and the flash ranging by spotting the
flashes or smoke puffs, were able to
give our artillery the location of the
batteries doing the firing, revealing
their camouflaged hiding places with
an accuracy that was a matter of
yards.
When sound ranging was first used
observers with stop watches were sta-
tioned at certain places along the front
and when they heard the report of an
enemy battery they recorded the time
to fractions of a second and reported
to a central station. These reports
were consolidated and plotted, and the
location of the battery determined.
This method was not sufficiently ac-
curate, however, and the observers
were supplanted with sensitive ma-
chines which would automatically
pick up the sound and record it at
once in the central station. These ma-
chines were five-gallon gasoline cans,
fitted up as microphones, and con-
nected with a central station where a
"movie" apparatus registered to very
small fractions of a second the differ-
ence in time of arrival of the sound at
the various microphones. Sound
travels noo feet per second, and by
knowing what observation posts or
microphones registered the sound first
and taking into consideration the time
and location of other microphones it
was possible for the experts at the
central station to plot on the map the
location of the guns firing.
It was easy to have gasoline cans
detect sound, but to keep these micro-
phones connected with the central sta-
tion during active shelling was danger-
ous work. Officers and men were
constantly exposed to shell lire in keep-
ing the wires clear and mending
breaks.
Under certain weather conditions
sound ranging could not be used; for
instance, when a strong wind was
blowing toward the enemy positions.
This would retard and disperse the
sound so the detectors could not pick
it up. Under such conditions the
flash ranging stations were relied on to
aid the artillery. When owing to the
terrain or weather conditions, the
flash rangers could not operate, the
sound rangers carried on the task, so
the two methods supplemented each
other.
To fix the position of a gun by its
flashes the intersection of three ac-
curately observed rays was required.
A post seeing a flash or smoke puff
would report to central its approxi-
mate bearing ajid location. Central
thus had an approximate position for
the gun and gave other posts a line to
look along to direct them on the same
flashes. The post which first sees the
flash takes the lead and signals as each
flash is seen to central and the other
posts. The other posts having been
given a rough angle' by central watch
until they pick up a flash occurring at
the same instant as the signal from
the leading post, they signal "flash."'
Central takes time of each flash as
given by the observers and if the sig-
nals are received at central together
the posts are looking at the same flash.
Central then knows an intersection has
been obtained and asks for the exact
angles from each post.
In checking up enemy positions after
our troops had driven the Germans
out, it was found that the location
given by the sound and flash rangers
after several observations were in
many instances within ten yards of the
enemy batteries.


DEAN M. E. COOLEY
This address was delivered by Dean
Cooley to a graduating class. Several
phrases have been altered to make it
suitable for our use.—Editor.
What thought shall I give you,
young gentlemen, on the morning of
your entrance into these halls; when
you are to fit yourselves in the world
of strife and gain—and loss? That
last word does not fit well with your
present mood, for within your horizon
to-day there is room only for the
things which gladden the heart—the
hopes and ambitions which brought
you to College.
It is a fair land which awaits you
when viewed from the hill-top, but
between you and the goal you seek
lie all of the obstacles which have been
discovered by those who have pre-
ceded you as explorers in the field of
life's work. Not only those obstacles,
but others, which can become known
to you only as individuals. It is to
those other obstacles, the obstructions
which you will find lying in your own
particular path, that I would direct
these words. The goal awaiting the
man who can overcome obstacles, par-
ticularly those peculiar to himself, is
success. The key which unlocks the
door and brings the magic word within
the scope of your vision is self-analy-
sis.
"Know thyself." spake Solon, one
of the seven wise men of Greece 600
years before Christ. These words are
inscribed over the entrance of Apollo's
temple at Delphi. Let them also be
inscribed over the entrance of the
temple of your mind,—burned in with
fire that they may never be effaced.
The man that truly knows himself has
a profound knowledge of man. Pope
said: "The study of mankind is man."
Remember always that while the world
is ever new, the foundation truths are
always old. Beneath the surface of
the boiling human pot the liquid re-
mains unchanged in the elements con-
tributed by nature. It is only in the
elements contributed by man himself
that there are differences, and these
but rise to the surface to be skimmed
off. If you would know your fellow
man, know also yourself.
To those of us who have been longer
on the trail comes a flood of thought
and a great desire to put in words a
few of them that you may learn to
read the signs aright and keep the
path when the blazings are but faint
and the portages overgrown and hid-
den. However well we may perform
our task it remains that after all we
have disclosed to you only the things
as we have seen them, and you cannot
know them for yourself until after
you have seen them with your own
eyes.
We aid our vision to see distant ob-
jects with the telescope. But the
goal which can be seen only
with the telescope is indeed far
distant, and may never be reached.
The aid to vision which I would rec-
ommend to you, young gentlemen, and
which will bring the object of your
search close home and quite within
your grasp is the binocular self-analy-
sis. Look close within and not far
away if you would find the golden key.


183
There may be two of you who, so far
as your record in college goes, are
equal. The day you graduate we pre-
dict for both of you a successful ca-
reer. But one far outstrips the other
in the race to come. What is the ex-
planation? If you, the one who has
been outstripped, will but seek the ex-
planation, and pursue it to the end, it
will come finally to an examination of
yourself. It may be that what we call
"luck" for want of a better word, has
had something to do with it. We al-
most always seek some excuse for our
failures, blame someone or assign
some cause that gives us comfort, all
the time fighting shy of the real cause.
There is the point I want to impress
upon you. Look not about you but
within for the cause, and be mighty
sure you do a good job of looking.
Let me illustrate. Many years ago
there was a student here who had a
growl in his voice. He gave the im-
pression of always carrying a chip on
his shoulder. His classmates did not
fraternize with him. Over the draw-
ing board with him on some problem,
it occured to me that he was uncon-
scious of his fault, so one day I asked
him if he knew he had a growl in his
voice. He was astonished—had never
thought of it, and almost immediately
his face lighted up with a look of un-
derstanding and he thanked me sin-
cerely for calling his attention to it.
Today he is the sales manager in one
of our largest cities for one of the
most celebrated manufacturing con-
cerns in this country. This position
he has held many years—far outstrip-
ping some of his classmates who gave
brighter promise while in college. Not
the least important, he is happily mar-
ried, has a family of children nearly
ready for college, has given immeas-
urable pleasure to his parents, who
were simple farming people here in
Michigan, to whom he introduced me
on his graduation day, and never fails
to call on me, or on members of my
family, with his wife and children,
whenever he is within reaching dis-
tance. Young gentlemen, that distin-
guished son of Michigan made good
use of the binocular, self-analysis,
once his attention was called to it. It
revealed to him the golden key which
unlocked the door, not only to suc-
cess in a pecuniary sense, but what is
vastly more important,—to success as
a citizen of influence in the community
in which he lives, and as the respected
and loved head of his splendid family.
Possibly it may not be clear to
some of you just what I mean by self-
analysis. It is the examination which
enables one to see in himself the things
so readily apparent in another. To
the man honest with himself it is a
splendid discipline. It creates in one
a modesty which notwithstanding the
tendency of the times, may still be
considered a virtue. It engenders a
spirit of sympathy. It fosters those
qualities which attract us and which
make us say of him that he is gentle
and well-bred, and possesses a charm-
ing personality. If you, young gentle-
men, could only know how often we
who have been charged with your
training are asked to pass upon your
merits by your prospective employers,
and how often the question of your
personality is inquired into, I am sure
you would more fully appreciate that
these virtues summed up in good
breeding have a distinct commercial
value, and play no small part in one's
success in life. Self analysis will dis-
close to you all these things and many
more. It will be Alladin's blanket to
carry you safely, even swiftly, over
seas of discontent, anxiety and unrest.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
I must not let this opportunity pass
without a word on the proper relation
of you as beginners in the world's
work to the man who after graduation
gives you employment and makes you
a member of his business staff. It is
all-important for you to remember
that you are beginners. The men
higher up in authority have most of
them traveled the same road you are
starting on; many of them, indeed, be-
gan far lower down and had to sur-
mount obstacles which you will es-
cape. But remember that the race is
not always to the swift. The longer
road does not necessarily mean a long-
er time to reach your goal. The train-
ing, the discipline acquired in the early
stages of the journey, will give the
power to travel more swiftly the lat-
ter stages of the journey. Be content,
therefore, if your first employment
but affords you the means to live in
a simple way, provided there is a reil
'goal ahead. Fortunate indeed is the
young man who finds his first employ-
ment at a low salary, a bare living
wage, with prospects ahead; and un-
fortunate he who starts at .? much
higher rate with no prospects. It is
a sad day when the expected promo-
tion does not materialize for the rea-
son that the pay is already too high.
Happiness and success are measured
by the derivative which determines
the direction of the tangent to your
curve. Keep this tangent always in
the ascent and be content to stc.rt at
a low enough point to insure that it
will not change direction indicating a
fived peak in your curve.
I would have you remember another
thing which you will recognize from
your study of mechanics. The ex-
ertion of a great force is made pos-
sible only by a great resistance to be
overcome. It is the same thing when
applied to man and his career in life.
With ro resistances to be overcome,
there is no call for great force. On
the other hand, the more difficult the
task, the greater is the strength re-
quired to accomplish it. Seek, there-
fore, not the easy road to success if
you would achieve renown in your
profession. Note on Commencement
Day the men who receive honorary
degrees, and the simple sentence pro-
nounced by the President which forms
the basis on which the degree rests.
Each one of those so honored has
had some magic word, motto, or star,
which has kept his eyes ever upward
in his journey since the day when like
yourselves he entered college and
dreamed of the days ahead.
"What would we do in this world of
ours,
Were it not for the dreams ahead?
For those thorns are mixed with the
blooming flowers,
No matter which path we tread.
"And each of us has his golden goal,
Stretching far into the years:
And ever he climbs with a hopeful
soul,
With alternate smiles and tears.
"That dream ahead is what holds him
up
Through the storms of a ceaseless
fight;
When his lips are pressed to the
wormwood's cup
And clouds shut out the light."
And now the final word, young
men. It may not spell success when
measured by the commercial scale.
But it will stand large on the books
kept by God and your fellow men


'85
when the day arrives for the weighing.
I would have you more than all else
be honest and fearless, and ever look-
ing within to see whether the acts of
your life are meeting with the approv-
ing smile of that little god, who like
the sign boards by the wayside, keeps
one ever on the right road. Be real
men wherever you find your place in
life and remember always that
"It takes a man to stand alone,
A man whose heart is strong.
To do what he believes is right
And single-handed make his fight
When thousands call him wrong.
"It takes a man to turn aside
The popular applause,
To stand against the moving tide
Of multitudes when they deride
And not forsake his cause.
"It takes a man content to be
Unpopular, uncheered,
To battle conscientiously
For right his fellows may not see
When hatred's head is reared.
"Great deeds are seldom born of praise
With smiles right is not won:
Unpopular are oft the ways
Of him who seeks the truth to raise
Until his work is done.''

EVAPORATORS
PROFESSOR W. L. BADGER
Film Type Evaporators
According to the theories discussed in a previous article (Michigan
Technic, March, 1919, p. 30) the principal resistance to the flow of heat
through the heating surface of an evaporator is that occurring in the surface
films. Attempts to increase the heat transmission are, therefore, directed
toward reducing the thickness of these films. In the horizontal tube evap-
orator this is done by putting the steam inside long, narrow tubes. This
gives the steam a high velocity and helps scrape off the film on the steam
side. The vertical tube evaporator has been designed to increase the liquor
circulation as much as possible, and thus reduce the film on the liquor side.
There is, however, a class of evaporators in which special attempts are made
to reduce the resistance to heat transmission, and from peculiar features
which they embody they are known as film type evaporators.
One of the very well known examples is the Kestner evaporator; shown
in Figs 15 and 16. In Fig 16, M is the body and R are the tubes, fastened
into tube sheets at the top and bottom. Steam enters at A and surrounds
the tubes. Condensed water leaves at E and non-condensed gases at C.
The liquid to be evaporated is fed at T, but is kept so that, as shown by a
gage glass, it would never rise but a few inches in the tubes. It boils in the
bottom of the tubes, but bubbles of liquid are entrained in the steam and
rise with it, as in the vertical tube evaporator. The tubes, however, instead
of being four to six feet long, as in the vertical tube type, are 20 to 30
feet long. Thus the liquor does not escape at once, but is submitted to further
boiling as it splashes up in the tubes. This still further increases the amount
of steam generated, and the increased velocity so given to the steam carries
the liquid up at such rate that it is spread out in a thin film on the side of the
tubes, travelling upward at a high velocity, until steam and liquid issue from
the top of the tubes as a spray that strikes the separator D. On the under
side of the plate D are spiral vanes, which give a whirling motion to the
spray, with the result that the liquid is thrown to the wall of the head by
centrifugal force. It is drawn off by L to go to the next effect, while the
steam leaves at P&gt;.
Owing to the high velocity of the film of liquid which travels upward,
the heat transmission is very high. The highest coefficient of heat trans-
mission which has come to the writer's attention was reported from a Kest-
ner. The apparatus has the further advantages that only a very small amount
of liquid is in the process at any time, and it is subjected to the action of an
elevated temperature for a very short time only. In the evaporation of sugar
juices, it is ordinarily considered unsafe to heat them at any time above 115


187
degrees Centigrade owing to the danger of decomposition of the sugar with
consequent discoloration. In the Kestner they have been boiled at 120 de-
grees Centigrade without injury, because of the short time they were ex-
Fig. 15
Setting for Kestner Triple Effect
posed to the boiling temperature. One result of this is that Kestners are
often used to increase the capacity of an existing evaporator without in-
creasing the steam consumption. Because of it's high heat transmission, a


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Kestner can be put in ahead of an existing evap-
orator as an additional effect even though only a
small temperature drop is available for it.
Another film is the Yaryan, shown in Fig. 17.
Here there are a number of horizonal tubes be-
tween two tube sheets. The inlet for liquor to
be evaporated is at the lower right comer of the
section view; but not all the tubes are open to the
feed liquor. They are grouped in bundles—five in
a bundle in the view shown—and all but one tube
in each bundle enter return bends in such a
way that all the tubes in a bundle are in series.
That is, the liquor enters only one, and then has
to pass through all the others before it issues at
the left as a spray which which strike the baffles
shown in the head. Steam is admitted to the
top of the shell and surrounds the tubes. The
action is exactly similar to a Kestner, the only
difference being that the machine is horizontal
and the tubes are in several lengths in series; in-
stead of the machine being verticle and the tubes
arranged only one to a pass. This machine, like all
film type machines, will handle foamy liquids
quite well; though foamy liquids are the'most
difficult class to evaporate of any that are ever
met.
The third common representative of the class
of film evaporators is the Lille, shown in Figs.
18, 19, 20 and 21. In Fig. 18 it will be noticed
that there is but one tube sheet, at the left end of
the shell. This is thickened in the center, and
in it are expanded a number of horizontal tubes,
supported solely by the grip of the tube sheet.
They have a slight slant, so that the condensed
water drains to the left. In the end of each tube is
rolled a plug carrying the vent for the non-con-
densible gasses. This is shown in greater detail
in Fig. 19. In the bottom of the shell is a liquor
well, and the liquor to be evaporated enters at the
pointe marked "Feed" thru a valve controlled by
a float in the well. On the bottom of each effect
is a centrifugal pump taking its suction from the
liquor well, and having two discharge pipes. One
goes to the next effect or to the thick liquor re-
ceiver; the other goes to a recirculating pipe
ending in a spray system in the top of the same
body. All the liquor drawn out of the effect
by the pump and not passed on to the next effect is re-circulatcd, shower-
ing down over the tubes. Thus the tubes are never submerged and
Fig. 16
Kestner
Evaporator


189
Fig. 17
YarYAN Evaporator
there is never any hydrostatic head on the heating surface- This is in
accordance with Classen's second principle, mentioned in the previous article
referred to above. There is no high liquor velocity as in the other two
film evaporators mentioned; all the gain is in this avoidance of the static
head.
Since the liquor being evaporated is on the outside of the tubes, if it de-
posits scale, cleaning is very difficult. To overcome this the Lille is some-
times built "reversing" ; that is, so arranged that either effect may be the first
effect. A reversible quadruple effect is shown in Fig. 21. It is run with
■effect A as the first and effect D as the last till it scales up; and is then re-

versed, so that A is last and D is first. The changes in temperature cause
enough expansion and contraction to crack off the scale.
All the film type evaporators give higher heat transmission coefficients
than either the horizontal or vertical tube types; but they are more expensive
machines and require a higher class of labor to operate them.
Removal of Solids.
In all the above descriptions of evaporators little mention has been made
of the removal of precipitates which may form during evaporation. It
should first be noticed that wherever any solid matter is expected, the ver-
tical tube type is generally chosen ; tho this is by no means a fixed rule.'
Methods for the removal of solids may be classified as:
1. Dumping the entire contents of the evaporator thru a foot valve.
2. Use of a salt leg and elevator.
3. Use of a receiver or filter.

The first method is the one universally used in sugar work, where the
contents of the pan is dumped thru a foot valve into a mixing trough, from
which it goes directly to the centrifugal separators. This method is trouble-
some and is only used where the mixture of crystals and mother liquor is
stiff and viscous, as in the manufacture of sugar.
The second method is very largely used in the salt industry. The evap-
orator is built with a conical bottom, and this is prolonged into a vertical
pipe of rather large dimensions. Cone and pipe must be long enough so
that the normal liquor level is more than the barometric height (33 feet)
above the outlet at the bottom. At the bottom of the vertical pipe or "salt
leg" is an elevator boot, and a bucket elevator removes the salt continuously
as fast as it drops down the salt leg. The elevator must be enclosed up to
the liquor level, so that the vaccum in the evaporator may be broken without
losing the liquor in the evaporator. This method involves a large amount of

room, as the pans must be high above the floor and the elevators also take up
considerable space It is almost automatic and not expensive to maintain.
It gives a rather wet product which must either be stored for some time to
drain, or must be centrifuged. It wastes considerable of the mother liquor.
This is, of course, no drawback in the case of common salt, as the brine is so
cheap as to make the loss negligible.
The third method is probably the most generally applicable. It is il-
lustrated in the first part of the present article (Michigan Technic, May,
1919, p. 87). The evaporator is provided with a conical bottom, and below
this is a receiver. Between the receiver and the cone bottom is a valve of
rather large opening. This valve may be. normally closed, and only opened
when crystals have accumulated in the hopper; or it may be open all the
time so that the crystals settle directly into the receiver as fast as they form.
In either case, when a charge of crystals has accumulated in the receiver,


the valve between the bottom and the receiver is closed, a vent in the top
of the receiver is opened, and the accumulated charge withdrawn. The re-
ceiver may be emptied into a filter or a centrifugal, or it may contain a filter
in itself. In the later case, only the mother liquor is pumped out; and the
crystals remaining on the filter are removed by a hand hole.

Calculations for Multiple Effect Evaporators
There are several methods for calculating the performance of multiple
effect evaporators, but the method due to Hausbrand gives a very good
understanding of the phenomena to be studied. Fig. 22 is a slight modifi-
cation of Hausbrand's diagram, which is the basis for the calculations of
this method.
The large rectangles represent the several effects of a quadruple effect
evaporator. The strip W represents the weight of liquor fed to the evapo-
rator, and as it diminishes in width it shows the progress of evaporation.
Let us suppose that it is fed at a temperature of tw. Then the heat neces-
sary to bring it to the boiling point is W(tt - tw) and the weight of steam
(at a temperature t0 and with a total heat of c0) necessary for this heating
would be
This assumes that the condensed water leaves the apparatus at the same
temperature as the boiling liquid. To evaporate one kilogram of water at
a temperature of tj takes (ct - ta) calories. Then the heat necessary to
evaporate d, kg. is d1(c1 —tt) cal., and the weight of steam needed for this
evaporation is
d0=di(c1-t1)/(c0-t1)
The total weight of steam fed to the first effect is, of course, D„=d'' -f- d0;
and the weight of condensed water leaving the first effect is bI=D„.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Going from the first to the second effect we have W - Dx kg. of liquid
at a temperature tlt and D, kg. of vapor also at a temperature tr But the
pressure in the second effect is lower than the pressure in the first effect, so
that the boiling point in the second effect is only t2. Therefore the liquor
coming from the first effect will be superheated in the second effect; and the
result is a certain amount of spontaneous evaporation or flash. The excess
heat brought in by the liquor from I is (W - D)(t, - t,). To generate
one kg. of steam in the second effect takes c2 - t2 cal.; and if we assume as
Fig. 22
before that the condensed water leaves at the temperature of the boiling
liquor (t2), the amount of self-evaporation will be
s2=(W-D1)(tg-t1)/(c,-t,)
In addition to this is the "regular" evaporation caused by the D, kg. of steam
coming from the first effect, and it will be
d2=D1(c1-t2)/(c2-t:!).
In the third effect we may write, from similar reasoning
sa=(W-D1-D2)(t8-ts)/(ca-ta)
m3=s2(c2-t3)/(c3-t3)
da=d2(c2-t8)/(ca-ts)
Da=s,+ma-fda
Everything in the fourth effect may be similarly expressed.
Thus by a combination of equations for the various effects we may
express any of the quantities in terms of W, D0, and the various c's and t's.
Hence the most important thing for us to have is the temperature of each


effect, since the total heat in steam may be taken from steam tables if the
temperature is known.
However, in no case are the intermediate temperatures under our con-
trol; nor can they be predicted with certainty. We determine the tempera-
ture of steam ti be fed to the first effect by considerations of economy in the
factory as a whole. We determine the temperature of the last effect by the
vacuum which can be economically maintained with the condenser and
vacuum pump available. The rest of the temperatures are in a state of
mobile equilibrium, and any change in any condition affecting the evaporator
caused a new distribution of the temperature drop between the first and the
last effect. For instance, suppose scale forms on the tubes in the second
effect only. Then this effect does not condense the vapors coming from the
first effect as fast as formerly; and the pressure (and hence the tempera-
ture) of the first effect increases. The second effect does not generate vapor
as fast as before; and hence the third effect, condensing as efficiently as
before, causes a higher vacuum (and hence a lower temperature) than be-
fore in the second effect. Thus the first result of scale in the second effect
is an increase in the temperature drop across the second effect; but this
altered temperature in the second effect in turn is passed on to the third.
The result is a totally different series of temperatures; only the heating
steam and the boiling point of the fourth effect being unaffected. Hence,
though the development of the above equations is very important for a thor-
ough understanding of the phenomena in a multiple effect evaporator, they
are of no great help without data not ordinarily available.
Hausbrand has assumed various temperature drops and, with the above
equations, calculated the values of the various quantities in his diagrams.
The result of a very large number of trial calculations is that the relative
quantities evaporated in each effect do not change much as the temperature
distribution changes. Therefore, average values from the trial calculations
will be of value even if we do not know the temperature distribution. The
results are, in terms of Da: N

Triple effect 1.000 l(&gt;97 I233
Quadruple effect 1.000 1.123 1.187 1.316
It is also necessary to know the evaporation for which the heat must pass
through the heating surfaces (as distinguished from self-evaporation, for
which the heat does not pass through heating surfaces).

Triple effect 1.000 1-0075 1.138
Quadruple effect 1.000 1.0055 1.109 1.196


Another useful set of ratios is the total evaporation in each effect in terms
of the total evaporation in all effects:
Dt D2 D3 D4
Double effect 0.4647 0.5353
Triple effect 0.3003 0.3294 0.3703
Quadruple effect 0.2161 02427 0.2568 0.2844
It will be noticed that these add up to 1.000 for each case.
Let us consider the following case: A quadruple effect evaporator takes
1250 liters of thin liquor per hour, and evaporates it to 250 liters thick liquor.
Assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the specific heat of thin and thick
liquor is 1.000; that the boiling point is the saint as that of water, and that
the condensed water leaves each effect at the temperature of the boiling
liquor. Then
D1i+D,+D,+D4=iooo kg.
D!=2i6.i kg.
D4=2844 kg.
d,=2i6.iX 1.0055=217.3 kg.
d3-r-rn3:=2T6.iX 1-109=239.6 kg.
d4+nvr-nt=2i6.iXi.196=258.5 kg.
Now let us assume that we can hold a vacuum corresponding to 60° C.
in the last effect; that the condenser is fed with water at 200 C, and that the
hot water may leave the condenser at 550. Let us also assume that steam
is fed to the first effect at 1050, the boiling point in the first effect tt is
TOO0, and the temperature of the feed (tw) is 20 degrees.
One of the advantages of carrying out the calculations in the metric
system is that steam tables become unnecessary. The total heat in 1 kg. of
steam at a temperature t is
c=6o6.5+o.305t
This formula gives results close to the best figures available. For prelim-
inary calculations it may be rounded off to 606.5-l-0.3t.
Then, to heat the feed from 20 to 100° takes 1250(100-20) calories-
One kg. of heating steam gives up, in the first effect, (606.5+0.3X'05) —
100 calories, or 538.0 calories. Then
d*=( 1250X80)7538.0=185.9 kg.
From the formula already developed, in a similar way,
d0=d1(c1-t,)/(c0-t1)
or
d =216.1(636.5 - 100)/(638-0 - ioo)=2i5.7 kg.
and the total steam fed to the machine is
D0=d"+d0=i85.9+2i5.7=4Oi.6 kg.


In the condenser we put 284.4 kg. of vapor at 6o°, and the condensed
water leaves at 55°. Then the heat which must be taken up by the cooling
water is
2844(624.5-55)=284.4X569-5
Each kg. of water fed to the condenser can take up (55 -20) or 35 calories.
The weight of water needed will therefore be
(2844X569-5)/35=4627 kg.
Besides the steam and water consumption, we are also interested in the
heating surface needed. Here there are several difficulties. In the first
place, we do not know the coefficients of heat transmission. These vary
very widely from effect to effect. In the second place, we do not know the
temperature drops with certainty. The result is that we take an average
figure for the rate of evaporation and use that for all effects. The conse-
quence of this is that we put too little heating surface in the last effect and
too much in the first. But it may be easily shown that the result of this is
to make a smaller temperature drop across the first effect and a larger one
across the last effect. Since in the last effect the liquor is more concen-
trated, probably more viscous, and boiled under unfavorable conditions
generally, the increased temperature drop here is desirable rather than not.
Hausbrand says that for liquids presenting no unusual difficulty in
evaporation, in vertical tube machines with copper tubes not less than three
feet long, we may expect to evaporate
in simple effect, 70-80 liters water per hr. per sq. ru-
in double effect, 30-36 liters water per hr. per sq. m.
in triple effect, 20-25 liters water per hr. per sq. m.
in quadruple effect, 18-21 liters water per hr. per sq. m.
Iron tubes decrease this by 10 to 15 per cent. Horizontal tube
apparatus gives 15 per cent more. Vertical tube evaporators with low liquor
levels may give up to 10 per cent above these figures.
For the above example let us assume 20 liters evaporated per hour.
Then we would have •
in the 1st effect, 216.1/20=10.8 sq. m. heating surface
in the 2nd effect, 217.3/20=10.9 sq. m. heating surface
in the 3rd effect, 239.6/20=12.0 sq. m. heating surface
in the 4th effect, 258.5/20=12.9 sq. m. heating surface
It is very undesirable to make the different effects of different sizes. It
would take separate drawings, separate patterns, and would make the cost
out of all proportion to the value of the differences. For such slight vari-
ations we would average the results and make each effect with n-6 square
meters heating surface.
Multiple Effect Evaporators Using "Extra Steam"
It frequently happens that in processes using evaporators there is a
call for steam for heating or for other uses where the vapors passing from


one effect of an evaporator to another would be of sufficient temperature for
the purpose. Steam diverted from an evaporator is more economical than
steam directly from the mains, as it has already evaporated one or more
times its weight of water, according to the effect from which it is taken.
Such steam is called "extra steam" and forms a notable method for in-
creasing the steam and water economy of a process as a whole. It opens
up the possibility of an endless number of combinations; and the discus-
sion here will be very limited.
Let us designate this extra steam by eu e2, e3, etc., according as it is
obtained from the vapors leaving the first, second, third, etc., effect, respec-
tively. In the case of the first effect, we only have to add enough heating
steam, de, to produce tr kg. more of evaporation. But if we take e2 kg. of
vapors from the second effect, we must evaporate fr kg. in the first effect to
produce it. Similarly to give e3 kg. of extra steam from the third effect we
must make f2 kg. of evaporation in the second effect and gi kg. in the first,
to account for it.
In order to carry out the necessary calculations it is necessary for us
to have some idea of the temperatures of the different effects. This was not
necessary in the simple calculations, but is indispensible here; though the
figures here need not be very accurate.
If an evaporator is designed with the same amount of heating surface
in each effect (in the case of a simple multiple effect) or with the heating
surface properly proportioned for extra evaporation, the temperature dis-
tribution from effect to effect will be moderately definite for ordinary work-
ing conditions- Hausbrand gives the temperature drops between steam and
liquid for each effect as
I. II. III. IV.
Double effect 1.000 1.58
Triple effect 1.000 1.44 3-4!4
Quadruple effect 1.000 1.105 M^ 2-t75
Let us assume the following case:—1250 kg. of a solution are to be
evaporated to 250 kg. in a quadruple effect. 100 kg. of extra steam are to
be drawn from the first effect, 100 kg. from the second, and 100 kg. from the
third. The use of the temperatures of the individual effects comes here; in
determining how much extra steam has to be drawn for the purpose in
hand. Since we have assumed a flat figure for the extra steam, the values
for the temperature drops will not appear in this particular problem. Other
conditions will be assumed as in the previous problem.
It is simplest to deal with all quantities involved in the extra steam first;
and then treat the remainder of the evaporation as if it were a regular quad-
ruple effect. Hausbrand gives, from the average of many calculations under
widely different assumptions, that
in triple effect f1=o-992e;,
in quad, effect gi=0-995f2
fI=o.99Se2


Then we have, in kg., in each effect, evaporation involved in the production
of extra steam as follows:
I. II. III.
e!=ioo
fi= 99-5 e2=ioo
gt= 90.2 f.= 90.7 e3=ioo
289.7 190.7 100
The sum of these quantities gives 5804 kg. of evaporation already accounted
for. Subtracting this from 1000 kg. gives 419.6 kg. yet to be evaporated.
This is handled exactly as if a separate evaporator were to handle it in quad-
ruple effect. We will then have
0=419.6X0.2161=90.7 kg.
02=419.6X0.2427=101.8 kg.
03=419.6X0.2568=107.7 kg.
0=419.6X0-2844=1 19.3 kg
Total 419.5 kg.
The total evaporation in each effect is then
I. II. III. IV.
For extra steam 289.7 190.7 100.0
Regular evaporation 90.7 101.8 107.7 I!9-3
380.4 292.5 207.7 "9-3
To cause the 380.4 kg. of evaporation in the first effect takes 380.4X536.5/
538.0=379.4 kg.=d0.
To heat the feed from tw(20°) to tj (100 degrees) takes
d=i25oX8o/538.o=i85.9 kg.
and the total steam to be supplied to the first effect is
D0=d0+d1=379.4+185.9=565.3 kg.
With the same assumptions as before regarding the condenser, we have
Water to condenser=fi9.3X569.5/35=i94i kg.
To determine the heating surface required we must subtract, from the total
evaporation found above, the self-evaporation; as heat for the self-evapor-
ation does not go through the heating surface. We have
D^d,
D„/d2=i.i23/i.oo55
D3/(d3-(-m3)=i.i87/i.io9
D4/(d4+m44-n4)=i.3i6/i.i96
From these ratios we have
d1=38o.4 kg.
d2=292.5X 1.0055/1.123=261.9 kg.
d3+m3=207-7X 1.109/1.187=194.0 kg.
d4+m4-|-n4=ii9.3Xi. 196/1.136=108.4 kg.


and figuring the heating surfaces at 20 kg. evaporation per square meter this
gives for the respective heating surfaces
1=19.0 sq. m.
11=13.1 sq. m.
111= 9.7 sq- m.
IV= 5.4 sq. m.
Although it is more expensive to have the bodies of different sizes, in this
case they differ so much that it would entirely disarrange the temperature
drops (and hence the amounts of extra steam needed from each effect for the
given purposes) if the heating surface were uniformly distributed. In
this case it would be necessary to make all the bodies of the sizes indicated.
It might be of interest to determine from Hausbrand's figures what
we may expect the temperature of each effect to be. We have fixed the
heating steam at 105°, and the fourth effect at 60 degrees; giving us 45
degrees total temperature drop as a working range. If we divide this into
four parts so that these parts are to each other as
1:00 : 1.105 :: 1.480 : 2.175
we will have as the temperature drops in the various effects, and the cor-
responding boiling points
Effect Drop Boiling point
I . 7.8 97.2
II 8.6 88-6
III 11.7 76.9
IV 17.0 60.0
The assumption first made, that the boiling point of the first effect would be
about ioo°, is not far enough out of the way to appreciably affect the ratio
of evaporation in the first effect to steam used.
Suppose that the regular quadruple effect first discussed was used in
the same process as the evaporator using extra steam; and the 300 kg. of
extra steam taken from the evaporator in the second case were now replaced
by 300 kg. of steam from the mains. The comparison would show:
Regular Quadruple with
quadruple extra steam
Steam used 701.6 kg. 56.53 kg.
Water to condenser 4627.0 kg. 1941.0 kg.
Against this saving must be balanced the increased cost of the second evapo-
rator (due to the bodies being all different in size) and the greater losses
from radiation in the more complicated pipe lines. In most cases where an
evaporator is a part of a process in which there is much call for steam for
heating, it will be found economical to take extra steam from the evaporator
in spite of the increased first cost. It is often economical to use extra
steam in preheaters to bring the feed to the evaporator iself up as near to
the boiling point as possible instead of doing all the heating in the first effect.
In the manufacture of beet sugar, where the juice has to be heated often,
there are often found extremely complicated arrangements using extra
steam, in order to have the highest heat economy for the whole system.


MAURICE Y. KAPETANSKY, '17E
The processes of welding have gained so much favor, owing to their
extensive use by our government on war work, that an interest in experi-
ment and research work along these lines has been greatly developed. In
automotive lines, the adaptability of welding processes, proven during the
period of the war in the fabricating of airplane and truck parts, is being
turned to the products of peace times, the touring car, trucks and tractors.
The most famous of the products of the welder is the Liberty engine with
its more than 120 lineal inches of sheet metal welding to the cylinder.
There are twelve cylinders. The battle planes in which these engines
were installed each contain several hundred welded parts and fittings.
The duties of the testing laboratories in connection with these welded
parts are many and varied. From steel yard to packing case the laboratory
acts as a guardian of the metal parts.
The composition of every piece of metal is tested and made a matter
of record for acceptance or rejection. The processes are specified, the
strength, ductility and hardness must conform to very close limits, and if a
new steel is used or the old methods do not bring the article up to specifica-
tions, the testing laboratory must diagnose the trouble and prescribe the
correct treatment to remedy the fault. To make the tests necessary to the
inspection and diagnosis of the faults of welded materials, the metallurgical
laboratory is operated in three divisions, the chemical, physical and metal-
lographic laboratories. The chemical laboratory is the first in line. Samples
of the different metals bought or used, are submitted to it, and. if the metal
conforms to the specifications drawn up for the parts for which it is to be
used, it is accepted. For many welding operations it is essential that the
metal conform to the specifications for welding material. In electric resis-
tance or butt-welding, especially where 100% of the original strength is re-
quired, the steel must conform to certain chemical analysis.
For instance, the steels used for the illustration of this article were sub-
mitted to the chemical laboratory, and the following report made on the
chemical contents. The welding rods and fluxes are also the subject of an-
alysis and study, and the following table shows the difficulties experienced
by welders in obtaining suitable welding wire.

Merits and demerits of welding wires used.
1. A flux-covered wire for arc welding, expensive. It proved to be a
good filler for arc-welding, equally efficient with or without its flux coating,
which proved to be mostly calcium carbonate (common chalk).
2. A reliable trade-marked wire for gas or arc-welding, cheap. It
proved equally good for arc or gas, as low carbon and sulphur content would
indicate.
3. A soft iron, domestic wire, copper-coated, cheap regular stock.
This filler could not be used for arc welding because of its copper coating,
but it was very good for gas welding.
4. A Swedish iron wire, regular stock imported. It is not suitable
for welding on account of high sulphur.
5. A low-carbon-nickel steel wire, welding stock. It is low in sulphur,
but high in carbon, it is useful for gas or arc welding.
6. A low carbon-vanadium wire, welding stock. It is suitable for gas
welding, but drawn to too great a hardness for arc.
7. A wire sold for arc-welding, supposed to be welding stock, but
too high in carbon.
8. A wire sold for either gas or arc welding. Entirely out of reason
in carbon content.
Welding wire No. 2 was used on the straight carbon steels, and No. 5
and No. 6 on the nickel and vanadium alloys in gas welding.
No. 2 wire was also substituted for No. 6 wire in arc-welding on account
of hardness of latter. There were no fluxes to analyze in this case, but the
gases are sometimes tested for purity and deterious substances. The carbon
content is arrived at by means of the apparatus shown in illustration No. 1.
DETERMINATION OF CARBON BY DIRECT COMBUSTION
The furnace with attached apparatus, as shown in illustration No. I,
is placed on a bench or on a shelf about 10 inches wide fastened to the wall,
near the balance, and near bench containing solutions required. The oxygen,
as shown, passes from the tank through a valve for regulating the pressure,
then through a solution of KOH (50%), then through a U tube containing
pieces of KOH, then through a U tube containing soda-lime in one half
and calcium chloride (anhydrous) in the other, thence through silica tube in


203
furnace. The silica tube is closed at one end, where the oxygen enters,
by a rubber stopper through which passes a short piece of glass tubing at-
tached to a short piece of rubber tubing leading from the U-tubes. The
stopper can be removed conveniently for insertion and removal of boats.
This stopper should be protected from the heat. This is done by attaching
a piece of copper gauze rolled into a cone shape and wired to a piece of
glass tubing projecting through stopper, the cone being filled with loosely
packed abestos.
The other end of the silica tube should contain a plub of loosely packed
asgestos placed before the rubber stopper. Passing through this stopper it
a glass tube connected to a U-tube containing powdered zinc (30 mesh),
about 10cm. This zinc is for the purpose of removing phosphorus and sul-
phur which are oxidized in the process of combustion and which, if allowed
to pass into the reagent for absorbing the C02, would vitiate the result. The
caustic potash and other reagents placed in the first part of the train are for
the purpose of removing any carbon dioxide and moisture from the oxygen.
ILLUSTfWTiON N0.1.
The temperature of the furnace, which is most satisfactorily heated by
electricity, should be maintained at about 19000 F. The temperature should
be checked occasionally by a pyrometer.
Two solutions are required by the method to be described. The stand-
ard barium hydroxide Ba (OH), solution is made by dissolving 18 to 20
grms. of Ba (OH)2 in 1 liter of freshly distilled water. The standard hy-
drochloric acid is made by dissolving 8.1 c. c. con. HCL (Sp. Grav. 1.16) in
1 liter of distilled water. These solutions are approximately tenth normal
and are most conveniently made up in volumes of 8 to 10 liters. When
properly protected they are quite stable, but should be restandardized from
time to time.
The Ba (OH )&gt; solution must be protected from the CO* in the air. This
is readily done by means of a bulb or U-tube containing soda-
lime attached to a short glass tube passing through one of the openings of a
three hole stopper as shown in the illustration. Through the other two
openings pass two glass tubes, one extending nearly to the bottom of the
bottle. These tubes are attached to a burette provided with a two-way stop-
cock as shown.
Either freshly distilled water or distilled water placed in a container
provided with a soda-lime tube and siphon should be conveniently provided
for washing purposes.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Standardization of Solutions
The solutions being prepared as above, the value of the Ba(OH)„
solution is now determined in terms of the HC1 solution by measuring out
from the burette into a 250 cc. Erlenmeyer flask 30 cc. of Ba(OH)2 solu-
tion adding 2-3 drops of phenophthalein indicator and titrating at once with
the HC1 solution until the pink color just disappears. The titration with
HC1 is most conveniently done by means of an automatic burrette attached
to a bottle containing 8 to 10 liters of solution. The average of three titra-
tions gives us, say 35.7 cc. HCl-30 cc Ba(OH)2. The furnace being heated
to the required temperature, 1 gram of standard steel (U. S. Gov't. Std.


0.372 per cent carbon, say) is weighed out and placed in boat. The boat
may be composed of nickel, earthenware, or alundum. A layer of powdered
alundum should be placed in the bottom of the boat also spread along bottom
■of silica tube to protect it. In placing sample in boat, it should be spread
out somewhat along boat. Next into the Meyer tube 30 cc. of Ba(OH)2
solution is run in and the tube attached as shown, the oxygen having been
previously turned on for a few minutes to sweep out any C02 in the train.
The stopper is now removed from the rear of silica tube, the weighed sample
pushed by means of a wire to the middle of the furnace, the stopper quickly
inserted and the flow of oxygen regulated to give a steady stream. The time
should be noted as in most cases the combustion is completed and the CO,
swept out of the train in 15 minutes. It will be noticed that very shortly the
solution of Ba(OH), becomes turbid, then milky in color depending on the
■carbon content of the steel. In the meantime another sample is weighed,
placed in a boat, and at the end of 15 minutes another Meyer tube is pre-
pared and substituted in place of the first in which a stopper is placed to
protect it from the air. The burned sample is now quickly removed and the
one next weighed inserted so that combustion of the second is going on while
the first is being titrated. The contents of Meyer tube are now quickly
poured out into 250 cc. Erlenmeyer flask, the tube washed out 2 to 3 times
with the wash water provided, indicator added, and at once titrated with the
standard HC1. Thus we find it takes 29.7 cc. say, hence 35.7 cc. - 29.7 cc.
equals 6 cc, the amount neutralized by CO, from the carbon in the sample.
Then 0.372 -f- 6=0.062 per cent. Each cc. of the standard HC1 then is
equal to .062 per cent carbon. It is well to standardize the HC1 solution
against two or more standard samples. Having now found the values of
our solution we proceed in the same manner in determining the carbon con-
tent of samples to be analyzed. For example, a combustion having been
made using 30 cc. of Ba(OH), solution it is found that 29.4 cc. of HC1
solution are required to neutralize the solution. Hence 35.7 cc, the HC1
solution equivalent to 30 cc. of Ba(OH)i solution, less 29.4 cc. gives 6.3 cc.
which was neutralized by the COi from the combustion of the steel.. 6.3 x
0.062 per cent=o.390 per cent carbon in the sample.
With two Meyer tubes and three boats the furnace can be kept in
continuous operation. Four determinations per hour can be made and from
20 to 25 minutes out of each hour can be used for other work.
With ten liters of solutions several hundred determinations can be
made. No weighing is required except in weighing out the samples. The
method gives quite accurate results and the writers believe it is more uni-
formly reliable than the methods usually employed where weighed "absorb-
tion bulbs" are used.
There are several objections to the use of "absorbtion bulbs" which
are weighed before and after each determination. These bulbs are filled
with soda-lime and phosphorous pentoxide, or strong KOH solutions and
CaCl,, or pulverized KOH and asbestos, and in all cases the weight is con-
siderable, from 60 to 80 grams, whereas the weight of the CO, absorbed is
at most a few milligrams. To avoid errors a tare must be used and the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
sensibility of the balance must be fairly high to insure accurate results. The
higher the sensibility the slower the vibrations, of the pointer, necessitating
longer time for weighing. Also care must be taken that the "absorbtion bulb"
and tare are not unduly heated or cooled. Care must be taken in handling
so as to keep the surfaces clean. Also the bulbs in some cases are quite
fragile and easily broken. The large glass surface exposed by the bulb is
quickly affected by the moisture of the air. Care must be taken in testing
occasionally to insure that the absorbing capacity is not becoming exhausted.

Practically all of the above difficulties are avoided by the volumetric
method described. A fresh solution is used for absorption in each deter-
mination and the operation plainly seen. Changes in temperature and mois-
ture content of the air do not affect the accuracy of the result.
The boats should be ignited before being used. The wire used in in-
serting and withdrawing the boats from the furnace is conveniently made
with a short hook at the end and a bend in it giving the distance from the
end of the furnace for the location of the boat.
In case it is desired to check the standardization, this can readily be
done by weighing out 0.1326 gram of pure dry NaX03, dissolving in a
small amount of water and titrating with the standard HC1 using methyl
orange as an indicator. The above weight of Na2C03 is exactly neutralized
by 250 cc. of N-10 HC1 1.0 cc. of N-10 HC1 is exactly equivalent to 0.0006
gram of carbon or 0.06%. Having thus found the normality of the standard
HC1, the value in terms of carbon can be readily calculated thus giving a
check on the factor found by using a standard steel.


The Physical Laboratory
Assured of the correctness of steels, welding rods, fluxes, etc., the
physical laboratory takes hold, using special machinery capable of exerting
from one to 300,000 pounds pressure in the form of crushing, pulling, twist-
ing or resistance to shearing or bending of materials, samples of stock re-
ceived are as often as possible made up in one of the forms shown in illus-
tration No. 2.
The pulling force necessary to break the bar at some point between A
and B is known as tensile strength; the point at which it starts to increase
in length—elastic limit. For the purpose of this article, only the tensile
strength will be considered although this test is not always required of a
weld—in fact, other properties may be wanted. The physical test on sheet
stock makes use of the flat test bar Fig. No. 3, of the same outline as the
round bar, but of flat cross section. The impact test makes use of the bar
shown in Fig. 4, Illustration No. 2.
Method of Welding
For the sake of uniformity, the welds used in illustrating this article
were made of i-inch round stock. In order to make the cross sections uni-
form the apeces of the stock were separated by %.". The reason for thus
separating them is to allow the metal to flow through the opening and be held
there by the skin or surface tensions of the molten metal. If not separated,
the skin or surface tension would operate to hold the flowing metal out of
the center causing a shortening of material which would be disastrous to the
strength of the weld.
From the 1" bars welded as above the standard tensile bars Fig. No. 1.
Illustration No. 2, were prepared on the lathe ground to a finish on the
guage section so that the cross section would be accurate for the purpose of
computing the cross sectional area, which in this case is .505 sq. in.
At this stige 6 tensile bars, made of the same bar stock as those welded,
were tested in the Riehle pulling machine for comparison and following re-
sults were obtained.

We have now a comparison between the strength of the original bars
and the welds by two methods, both of which are applicable to parts made of
bar stock.
Heat Treating
The sudden and destructive heat of the welding flame necessary to flow
the metal must, of necessity, break up the grains of the steel, and cause
what is known among metallurgists as grain-growth. Any hot-working of
metal above its critical range, or disturbance of its form or structure at a
lesser heat, causes a need for a reheating to at least remove strains. In
welding, the process is familiar to welders as annealing. In the case under
observation, the welded bars were brought to a heat of i6oo°F accurately
registered by the thermo-couples on recording instruments, then quenched in
oil.
They were heated once more, this time to a temperature iooo°F and
allowed to slowly cool in the air. When the arc-welded bars so heat treated
were subjected to a tensile test, the following data was obtained:

From the above table the relative value of welds, both with or without
heat treatment, can readily be ascertained. By experiment and accurate
tabulation of the results, the most efficient methods can be determined and
heat treatment controlled so as to give physical properties most desirable
for welded parts. Where the question arises as to overheating or burning
of metals, it has been found that the metallographic laboratory can be relied
on to such an extent that all physical tests can be dispensed with until it
becomes a question of final selection. The heat treatment necessary to
reclaim a piece of overheated steel, or the rejection of a process or a metal
which cannot be successfully used is determined by microscopic methods.
The Metallographic Laboratory
Metallography may be likened to anatomy where a specimen is dissected
with the object of a thorough investigation. Metals are likewise dissected
and subjected to an examination under the microscope.
The external appearance of metals suggests little to the layman but it has
become a valuable safeguard to determine quality. It is recognized by all
engineers, and is a great asset to the automotive industry especially.
By sampling is meant the location and number of areas to be examined.
It is not necessary to examine the entire surface of a-mass of metal, pro-
vided a sufficient number of small areas be taken which properly represent it.
In selecting areas it is very desirable to follow a fixed rule and prepare
the surfaces at definite positions for the sake of comparison.
In the present instance this is done by preparing for the camera, sur-
faces adjacent to the fracture, one side being heat treated and the other
not.
To understand the story told by the accompanying photographs, three
things must be remembered.
1. All metals are crystalline in structure.
2. There is a critical temperature for every kind of metal according to
the elements contained in them.
3. The heat of the welding flame being at least three to four times the
critical temperature or the heat which changes the crystalline structure, it


211
Fie. 107
Fig. 109
Fig. m
Fig. iii


transpires that the welding-flame heat causes a grain-growth or enlarging of
the structure in the metal adjacent to the weld, as in illustration ioo.
In applying this rule to the present case, it must be remembered that a
piece of steel can be heated only to a limited temperature determined by the
amount of carbon or special elements in the steel for the best physical prop-
erties.
If the welder oversteps its temperature boundaries, grain growth at
once sets in with trouble accompanying it. Steel men are familiar with the
process of crystallization that renders metals weak and unreliable.
The arc temperature, especially in the hands of a careless operator, will
work havoc with steel, as shown in illustration No. ioo, where the metal
adjacent to the weld has been greately overheated, as shown by the large
crystal; and in comparison of their size with those in other illustrations in the
article.
All illustrations are from photographs magnified one hundred times
allowing a comparison of the grain size brought about by the different
processes on the different steels. That a weld is equivalent to a casting is
also shown in Fig. No. ioo, where the lighter area is composed of a welding
wire low in carbon, sulphur and manganese and melted by the heat of the
arc. When overheating and burning of welded parts become a menace to the
physical properties of welded materials it becomes important for the metal-
lurgist to deviie remedies.
Four types of steel have been chosen for microscopic examination.
These were analyzed as show in Table No. I.
No. 2—A medium Carbon Steel.
No. 3—A high Carbon Steel.
No. 5—Chrome Nickel Steel.
No. 6—Chrome Vanadium.
Photographs were taken of each of these steels in their natural state:
Figures No. ioi, 104, 107, no.
The welded bars when failures in the tensile test took place, were sub-
mitted to the melallographic laboratory. A section of the portion adjacent
to one side of the weld of each was prepared and polished. In each of these
the section showing the line of demarcation or the line of welding was photo-
graphed as shown in Figs. 102, 105, 108, and 11.
The other ends of the broken tensile bars were heat treated. They were
heated to a temperature of 1600° Farenheit, quenched in oil, then reheated
to 10000 Farenheit and allowed to cool in the air. Sections cut from the sur-
face nearest the heat treated weld were then put under the microscope, and
Figs. Nos. 103, 106, 109 and 112 show the results.
The Carbon Steels
Fig. No. 101 shows the original crystalline structure of a hot-rolled
carbon steel, made by the Basic Open Hearth Process. The black particles
are known as pearlite, the white ones as ferrite. There is a larger percentage
of this steel used in manufacturing welded parts, than of all others com-
bined, although it is high in carbon for that purpose.
Fig. No. 102 is the same steel showing the line of welding called the line


of demarcation between the weld and original stock. Black spots observed
on the welded .trea (white) are due to either oxidation or slaggy inclusions.
Heat treating this medium carbon steel produced the results shown in
Fig. No. 103. Here the structure of both weld and stock has been refined
and the line of demarcation has almost been obliterated, showing the weld to
have gained in strength.
A high carbon steel, Fig. No. 104, is a basic open hearth containing
pearlite and feriite, the black area predominating over the white one.
Fig. No. T05 gives us an idea of the difference between the weld and
the original metal, the latter being of a finer crystalline appearance. The
irregular darker mass is that of the weld.
After heat treatment, Fig. 106, the line of demarcation was entirely
eliminated producing a uniform, finely distributed grain throughout. A
structure like this is very desirable because it suggests strength, molecular
cohesion between the grains having been increased. The two foregoing
welds were made with No. 2 welding wire, as indicated in table No. 2.
This steel while not a high carbon-steel was selected as typical of as high a
carbon steel as it is deemed proper for welding purposes. The tool and cut-
ting steels, their welding and treatment belong to other research work than
the limited scope of this article justifies.
The Alloy Steels
A chrome nickel steel hot weld is shown in Fig. 107. The structure
is almost like thot of a straight carbon steel.
Microphotograph 108 shows the weld in this steel, white plate 109 ex-
hibits the weld in a heat-treated condition, showing a finely divided crystal
throughout the surface. Welding wire used was No. 5—a low carbon nickel
steel. See table No. 2. The electric arc was used.
Fig. no showing a chrome vanadium steel according to analysis, and
comparison with No. in illustrates the effect of the heat on struc-
ture of the grains. The darker area of large flakes is the cast condition
of the welding. The line of demarcation between stock and weld was entirely
eliminated, and the structure completely refined by the above described
method of heat treatment. This tool was welded by the oxyacetylene process
using No. 6 wire, shown on Table No. 2.
Summary
The above experimental data is typical of all cases of heat treated
welds. It is a counter check on the tensile, impact or hardness tests, and
rarely if ever fails. The interpretation of the story told by the microscope
must be in the hands of competent and experienced metallurgists. The use
of the microscope alone in determining the value of welds saves a great
deal of preparation, as the cost of preparing specimens for microscopical
examination is only one-fourth or fifth that of preparing samples of the
same metal for physical test.
Of course, when it comes to a question of whether the right kind of steel
is being used the chemical laboratory must decide- To determine the
physical properties, such as tensile strength, resistance to vibratory stresses,
hardness, etc., die physical laboratory is to be called upon.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
returned to the faculty of the Eco-
nomics department.
The formal opening of the Union
is expected to occur about December
i. The reading rooms and swimming
pool, however, will not be ready until
January. There will be approximately
three thousand men appointed to
Union committees. This will tend to
make the Union a more representative
and popular institution.
Save for the installation of the fur-
niture, the new Library is complete.
With the characteristic Michigan
spirit prevailing and intensifying, the
University should be able to anticipate
its most progressive year.
The Engineering Society
With a certain feeling of pride the
officers of the Engineering Society
have watched the closing days of their
membership campaign- The results
show that over 600 have helped start
the greatest year of the society by
giving it their support.
A society membership gives you
the privilege of the society rooms. You
will find these rooms a splendid place
to get acquainted, not on special oc-
casions but everyday, between classes,
or in a vacant hour. The Society
rooms are intended for you. Use
them! During the year there are sev-
eral smokers, a dance or two, and
perhaps several speakers will be en-
gaged. It's going to be a great year,
boys, so let's get in all its activities.
The officers couldn't be beat! There
is Darbaker for president who is sup-
ported by Weston as vice-president,
by Gardener as treasurer and by Stor-
rer as secretary. Get behind these
men. Tell them what you want and
what you think will help to improve
the society.
t It is the only organization for the
entire engineering student body. Yes,
we have other organizations and clubs
but none express the spirit of the
Engineering College as a whole. Let
us support the Society which binds us
all together as students of the world's
greatest University. Boost the En-
gineering Society, boost the Engineer-
ing College and, above all, boost Mich-
igan.
A membership also entitles you to
the Technic, the only campus engineer-
ing magazine. Through it you can
keep in touch with campus doings.
You are enabled to keep in touch with
the news of the engineering field and
be informed of the newest develop-
ments in all branches of engineering.
You can read what some of the grad-
uates are doing—men who have gone
before you and are upholding the
Michigan standards in the world to-
day. The Technic tells you what the
faculty is doing for you- It is one of
the several benefits which come
through membership in the Engineer-
ing Society.
Traditions Day
The second annual Traditions Day
has proved a success, thus assuring the
permanency of this latest addition to
Michigan's historic ideals and tradi-
tions. It was first inaugurated last
spring after the demobilization of the
S. A. T. C. to instruct the freshmen
class in Michigan traditions and to
allow the upperclassmen to refresh
their memories concerning them. The
date of Traditions Day was advanced
from the spring to the fall term and
will henceforth be held sometime dur-
ing the first few weeks of school.
All hail to the latest addition to
Michigan's traditions: Traditions
Day!

The Honor System
This fall the Honor System is re-
ceiving new impetus and new backing.
Efforts are being made to make it
even more practical than it is. To
this end the Honor Systems used iii
various other colleges and universities
are to be studied. Most of the fresh-
men have never before taken exam-
inations under the Honor System and
many of the sophomores do not under-
stand its principles due to the fact
that it was practically a failure last
year on account of ,the conditions
prevalent during and following the
regime of the S. A. T. C.
Only by the co-operation of every
student can the Honor System be a
success. Take precautions so that you
will not be tempted to cheat. Take
alternate seats whenever possible.
Keep your eyes on your own work and
avoid all appearances of deceit. Do
not talk about the examination while
leaving the room. Don't compare
answers either during the examination
or in the hearing of those who have
not finished. In this way you will
help make the Honor System a suc-
cess-
If you see anything that looks like
cheating, warn the person or persons
concerned quietly and, if they persist,
announce the ifact to the class or
notify the honor committee.
Uphold the Honor System!
A Greater University
As the new semester begins, chief
among the many things engaging our
attention is the prospect of a still
greater year for Michigan.
As had been expected, we have be-
gun with the largest enrollment in our
history. This increase is shared by all
the colleges proportionately, the Engi-
neering College surpassing its former
attendance records by fully a third.
During the coming year nineteen hun-
dred students from all parts of the
nation will receive instruction in it.
The sudden influx of students gave
rise to additional problems, chief
among which was the task of provid-
ing suitable living quarters. Many of
the available rooms had been rented
to new residents of Ann Arbor brought
here during the summer by local
manufacturing concerns. Faced by
the fact that scores of prospective and
former students were transfering to
other universities because of inability
to obtain rooms, the Rooms Commit-
tee of the Michigan Union made a
house-to-house canvas of the city.
Through its efforts the situation was
relieved. A dormitory system is be-
ing urged for adoption to obviate the
reoccurrence of a similar situation.
Although classes are large and (ven-
ing classes are held in several courses
and the present number of professors
and instructors is insufficient, many
instructors have returned from na-
tional service and are prepared to im-
part new knowledge to their classes.
Moreover, the University has obtained
the services of several men of excep-
tional worth, among whom may be
mentioned Dr. Cabot, the new chief of
the surgical department; Professor
Blanchard, who takes the newly con-
stituted chair in Highway Engineer-
ing and Professor Friday, who has


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The committee also considers it advisable
to have only two penalties: suspension and
expulsion. In the past it has been the opin-
ion of the committee that some men were
willing to chance being caught if they could
pass an examination by cheating which they
could not possibly pass otherwise. Some
had rather risk apologizing before a
class or an assembly than losing credit in
a course. With suspension or expulsion as
the alternative instead of a reprimand or
an apology, most men would think twice
before attempting to cheat.
There are various other changes contem-
plated by the committe, and these will be
worked out during the investigation and
submitted to the student body later for its
approval.
Several mistaken ideas concerning the
system appear to be current. This organi-
zation is entirely independent of the facul-
ty, being entirely a student organization.
The judgments of the committee are not
submitted to the faculty unless the student
appeals the decision rendered to the Disci-
pline Committee of the College. By pledg-
ing himself to support the Honor System
the student agrees to neither give nor re-
ceive aid in any form during any examina-
tion or test conducted under the jurisdiction
of the Engineering College. In order to
uphold the Honor System and eliminate all
chances of suspicion falling upon himself
the student should abstain from doing any-
thing which would appear, in the eyes of
another, to be suspicious. Checking an-
swers during an examinaion is manifestly
improper, since it saves the time required
to rework the problem in order to see if it
is correct, but some have thought that
checking answers at any time was per-
missible. No student should talk concern-
ing the examination while on the way to
the desk or at the desk, or check answers
at the desk, because some carelessly spoken
word might enable several seated near by
to answer the questions, and so aid would
be given directly, although perhaps uncon-
sciously. The policy of taking alternate
seats whenever possible is also a good one,
since it lessens the chances for one student
to, accidently or purposely, look at an-
other's paper.
If each student will adopt the policy of
playing safe" and avoiding all actions
which are suspicious, the work of the Honor
Committee will be greatly facilitated, and
the future success of the Honor System
will be assured.
THE HONOR COMMITTEE.
REMARKABLE ATTENDANCE IN
UNIVERSITY FOR YEAR
1919-1920
As is the case with all the big Universi-
ties of the country, Michigan finds herself
at the start of the present year with a rec-
ord enrollment in all of her colleges. Lat-
est reports give an increase of about 35%
in the University as a whole, and an in-
crease of one thousand and five hundred
students in the College of Literature and the
College of Engineering and Architecture,
respectively.
The College of Engineering and Architec-
ture had a total enrollment of 1,903 stu-
dents up to noon of Oct. 6, as compared
with the enrollment in the college during
the S. A. T. C. of 4,133 students, of whom
2,247 were Section "B" men and included
all of the training detachment located in
Ann Arbor. The enrollment in the Engi-
neering College this year outnumbers the
previous maximum in 1916 by 500 students.
Chief among the causes for this sudden
influx of students is the great demand for
technically trained men that has been
brought about by the war. This demand,
while pre-existent; was never so forcibly
brought before the eyes of the people as
throughout the war period. Not only has
the war demonstrated the demand for the
technically trained official but also his ad-
vantage over the untrained man.
Another very important cause is the re-
turn of a great number of ex-service men.
Many men have entered for the first time
this year because war activities prevented
them from starting with their class.
The increasing wealth of the country may
also be a factor in bringing the attendance
to its present high mark. Many men who
might have found it impossible in years


219
past to attend the University, must now
find themselves in a position to go on with
their education.
A big enrollment means a big year. Let's
go, Michigan!
ENGINEERING PROFESSORS RE-
TURN FROM SERVICE
Professors A. H. White and A. E. White
of the Chemistry Department, and Profes-
sor Herbert C. Sadler of the Engineering
Department, have returned to the Univer-
sity after having spent several years in the
service of the government.
Professor Sadler left Ann Arbor during
1917-1918. to become a director of steel
ship construction in the Emergency Fleet
Corporation under Chas. M. Schwab. He
resumes his position as head of the Marine
Engineering Department.
Prof. A. H. White was engaged in sev-
eral different branches of the service. He
enlisted May 15, 1917, as Captain of artil-
lery ammunition inspection and was dis-
charged July, 1919, as Lieut.-Colonel of a
new division in charge of projects for the
fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. He was
chief of the research section and associate
chief of the division. This division con-
trolled the expenditure of $140,000,000.
Prof. A. E. White was visiting in Phila-
delphia at the time this item went to press,
and could not be reached. He held a re-
sponsible office in one of the government's
largest munition plants.
LT. COL. COMMANDS NEW R. O. T. C.
UNITS.
Lt. Col. John P. Lucas is in command of
the artillery, ordnance, and signal corps
units established at the beginning of this
semester. He will also be professor of mil-
itary science and tactics.
Engineers will be practically the onht
men eligible for enlistment. Academic
studies will center largely around military
work thruout the four years of college.
Also two summer camps will be held, one
probably at the end of the freshman and
the other at the end of the junior year.
Upon completion of the prescribed courses
those candidates who pass the required ex-
aminations will receive commissions in the
reserve corps.
Ration pay amounting to approximately
$12 a month will be given to each candi-
date dring his last two years of training,
and while in summer camps all expenses
including uniform will be paid.
Lieut. Col. J. P. Lucas
MR. J. H. BATEMAN ENGAGED AS
PROFESSOR.
The Civil Engineering Department is
particultrly fortunate in obtaining the ser-
vices of Mr. J. H. Bateman as assistant
Professor in Highway Engineering. He
comes to the department following an ex-
perience of several years in the design and
construction of highways thruout the state.
Professor Bateman was graduated in the
spring of nineteen fifteen, receiving the de-
gree of B. C. E. After leaving college he
spent two years as assistant engineer with
the Michigan State Highway Department,
after which he became engineer in charge
of the road construction thruout the state.
He leaves the latter position to come to the
University through the joint cooperation
of the College of Engineering and the State
Highway Department.
Previous to entering the University he
had had three and one-half years experience


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
with the Engineer Corps of the United
States Army, during which time his work
was connected with the river and harhor
improvements on the Snint Mary's Falls
Canal in the Upper Peninsula.
Clifford Sparks
He comes here not only to teach; but
also, thru investigation at the University
Highway Lahoratory, to establish stand-
ards upon which the State Highway De-
partment may lease specifications for fu-
ture road construction. His office is in
the Xew Highway Laboratory Building.
WORK COMMENCES ON NEW HOS-
PITAL.
On Sept. 30th the ground was first broken
on the site of the new university hospital.
The work of excavating will require the re-
moval of 25,000 cubic yards of earth and
will cover a period of from six weeks to
two months. Snyder and Son of Ann Ar-
bor have the contract for this work.
The hospital proper will face on Ann
Street, crossing and shutting off Observa-
tory Street at the head of which the admin-
istration building will front.
The hospital will consist of three con-
nected buildings, the administration build-
ing in front, the hospital proper in the mid-
dle, and a building devoted to special pur-
poses such as laboratories, operating rooms,
etc., in the rear. The entire structure will
be of reinforced concrete construction
faced with brick.
The administration building is to be 150
feet long, the main hospital, which is a
building of two wings with Y's at each
end, 420 feet long, and the rear building
256 feet. Some comparative idea of the
size may be obtained when it is realized
that the rear building is to be 10 feet longer
than the greatest length of the Natural
Science building.
The hospital proper will be six stories
in height and will be so constructed that
more floors may be added to it in the
future. It is hoped sometime to double its
size and capacity. Present plans will per-
mit the accomodation of 600 patients.
Equipment will be complete and modern in
every detail. X-ray diagnosis, and research
work of every type will be special features.
THE MICHIGAN UNION.
The new Union building is now rapidly
nearing completion. The recent arrival of
large quantities of material has made this
possible. The date for the opening had
been set for October 15, but conditions
proved to be such that this was changed to
November 15. All things indicate that the
building will be ready before the snow
flies.
In the basement there is a stag grill


22t
room and soda fountain, both of which have
been in operation for some time. Work
on the bowling alleys is progressing, and
all the equipment is at hand ready to be
installed. The swimming pool is in the
same stage of construction that it was last
June. About $35,000 is required to finish
the tile work, dressing rooms, and to put
in the pumping and filtration machinery.
Floors are being laid in the lobby and
ball on the first floor. In the big assembly-
room some of the interior finish is already
on the walls, and maple flooring is piled
waiting to be laid.
The billiard tables have been set up and
this room is ready for the use of members.
Practically all of the woodwork and light-
ing fixtures are in place. No changes have
been made as yet in the plank stairway but
this will be completed soon.
The third and fourth floors are entirely
finished except for a few minor details.
The third is now used as a reading room
and for organization meetings. On the
fourth there are forty bedrooms capable of
accomodating sixty-eight persons. It has
been deemed advisable to keep these for
the use of transients only. The few rooms
in the tower are rapidly being finished and
occupied by campus organizations.
The new Union will be one of the finest
clubhouses in the country and we can feel
proud to have this wonderful building on
the campus.
VARSITY DEBATING.
The Central League Debate, which is a
triangular debate between the Universities
of Chicago and Northwestern, and Mich-
igan occurs the third Friday in January.
The question for debate is "Resolved that
the Federal Government should own and
operate the coal mines of the United
States."
The preliminaries will occur the last week
in October, when six men from each of the
Literary societies and a small representa-
tion from the Law school will be selected.
This constitutes the debating sqaud which
is turned over to the faculty of the de-
partment of public speaking; and students
speak before them and others of the faculty
who are especially interested in the sub-
ject. Eight men arc selected out of the
twenty-five or thirty, three of whom shall
become an affirmative team and three a
negative team, with an alternate for each
team.
We hold three debates on the same night,
two of which Michigan takes part in. Our
affirmative team goes to Northwestern Uni-
versity and our negative team meets Chi-
cago here.
Michigan Union
The Midwest Debating League has its
contest the last Friday in March. This is
also a triangular debate in which we debate
Wisconsin and Illinois. Try-outs will oc-
cur early in December, in the same man-
ner as those for the Central Debating
League.
Engineers who have not had four years
of college work, may enter these contests
thru one of the societies of the Literary
department. Professor Trueblood is anx-
ious to have a large number enter, and
especially urges engineers to come out. The
Dean of the Engineering school of Cornell
University once said to his students, "If


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
you men would learn to speak well you
would become head of the corporations in
this Country." In other Universities the
Engineers take up this kind of work, and
we can see no reason why the Engineers
here should not enter this branch of stu-
dent activitity.
A. B. Weston
The annual oratorical contest occurs the
first week in March, and like the debating
contests, only undergraduates may partici-
pate. The orations are limited to 1,850
words. The prizes are one hundred dollars
for first honor and fifty dollars for second.
Besides this, the winner also receives the
Chicago Alumni medal, the finest of its
kind. The die for this medal cost the Chi-
cago alumni $1,350. The winner will rep-
resent this University in the final contest
of the Northern Oratorical League which
will be held at Madison, Wisconsin on the
first Friday in May.
Engineers are urged to take part in this
contest also.
THE PRE-FESTIVAL CONCERTS.
The Choral Union is offering this year
a most exceptional group of artists in its
Pre-festival series of concerts.
The first to appear this season will be
Geraldine Farrar. the beautiful prima-donna
of the Metropolitan Opera. She will be
assisted by Arthur Hackett, the tenor who
so delighted his audiences at the May Fes-
tival last year; and Rosita Renard, the
pianist.
The second, and also the sixth concert
of the series is to be given by the Detroit
Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of
Ossip Gabrilowitsch, its most wonderful
pianist-conductor. The soloist for the first
concert is Mrs. George B. Rhead, the well-
known pianist.
Jascha Heifetz, whose perfect technique
combined with his wonderful expression
and breadth of tone has thrilled his aud-
itors ever since he has taken the concert
stage, provides what promises to be a most
enjoyable evening at the third concert.
The next concert, which takes place the
night of January fifteenth, presents Ric-
cardo Stracciari, the baritone, in whom we
find possibly one of the greatest singers in
America to-day.
Josef Hofmann gives the concert which
appears on the program in February. Since
the retirement of Paderewski from the
concert stage, there is probably no pianist
who can quite come up to the glorious
mark that Hofmann has set for himself
in the field of music.
This finishes with the Pre-festival course.
Probably never before in the history of the
Choral Union has such a galaxy of artists
been gathered on the boards of Hill Aud-
itorium during a single season.

ATHLETIC PROSPECTUS.
Michigan opened the season's athletics
by defeating Case, 34 to o; M. A. C, 26 to
o, and losing to O. S. U., 13 to 3.
The football team has many formidable
obstacles to overcome having games sched-
uled with Northwestern, Nov. 1; Chicago
at Chicago, Nov. 8; Illinois at Urbana,
Nov. 15;'and finally Minnesota at Ann
Arbor, Nov. 22.
Sizing up the team as a whole it is very
strong with most of its strength centered
in the back field. Weston, Sparks and
Cruse have done especially well in breaking
thru the opponent's line, and it is this work
that counts to make a score. Sparks has
proved a very capable pilot at quarter while
Captain Soetz, Dunn and Fortune have
done the best work on the line.
The team has been doing better on the
offensive than defense and this is a good
fault providing the Wolverines can keep
the offensive. However, Coach Yost has
been grilling the line recently and a great
improvement has been seen.
The All-Freshmen team this year has no
lack of aspirants as over 100 men reported
for the first few days of practice. Many
on the All-Fresh team are men who played
on other college teams last year and they
have beaten Yost's reserves in scrimmage.
New Basketball Coach
Basketball, now in its third season, has
a very promising outlook.
The team is to be coached by E. J. Mather
who has a fine athletic record behind him.
Mr. Mather is from Lake Forest University,
where he had been captain of baseball,
basketball and football teams during his
years at college. In 1909 he was picked
by the Chicago Daily News as all-western
end. After graduation the new coach spent
his time aiding the Lake Forest team and
after two years he went to Kalamazoo Col-
lege where he coached basketball five years.
Four of these years the team won four
charrfpionships in the M. I. A. A.
Coupling an excellent coach with good
material, the results are invariably
splendid. Captain Rychener and Williams,
last year's guards, and Karpus as one for-
ward form a nucleus for a banner team.
Many substitutes who did well last year
are back ready to help the new coach.
Cross Country and Track
Steve Farrell has already sounded the
call for track and quite a number of men
are seen each afternoon on Geddes Ave.
and also Ferry Field.
William Cruse
The cross country men are receiving a
good stiff training as they have two dual
events and a conference meet arranged this
season. On Nov. 8th Michigan competes
with Michigan Aggies for the M. A. C.
cup. One more victory by the Wolverines
and complete possession of the cup will be
obtained, as Michigan has defeated the
Farmers two out of three times. A team
of six men on Nov. 15 will accompany
the football team to Urbana where they
will stage distance events with Illinois.


THE MICHIGAN TECH NIC
Carl Johnson, Captain of this year's track
team is urging all men to get out for track.
A premature outlook at varsity track this
year promises well as twelve of last year's
team are back among whom are Johnson,
Butler, Moersch, Meese, Cook, Burkholder,
Losch, Westbrook and Lashmit.
CAMP DAVIS
By Prof. Clarence T. Johnston
With the summer session of 1919 Camp
Davis concluded its forty-sixth year. Be-
cause of its history and its traditions, it is
something more than an institution and a
place. The spirit of Professor J. B. Davis
is always found there and the most careless
observer ultimately becomes conscious of
an influence that can not be appreciated
until felt. Camp Davis is, therefore, a state
of mind to those who possess the faculty
of discerning principles, character and fine
qualities in things that are commonly classi-
fied with the materialistic and uninspiring.
Camp Davis might be located almost any-
where and yet enjoy some natural advan-
tages. The spirit that dominates the camp,
however, is a rare quality that can not well
be defined. This intangible thing manifests
itself in the necessary business and social
activities of the citizens of the camp. It
is disclosed by the attitude always assumed
when misfortunes or some difficult task is
confronted. At such times we quote from
the great teacher who founded the camp
and guarded its early growth. If the prob-
lem relates to construction, some one says,
"use plenty of large nails." If the subject
of surveying is referred to in a general
way a definition will be submitted in some
such words as these: "Surveying is an
applied science which enables us to measure
distance and angles.—neither of which can
be done." When some general advice seems
in order a second-hand quotation from Josh
Billings will be forthcoming: "It is better
not to know so many things than it is to
know so many things that are not so," or
"You can find eighteen men who can tell
how to do a tiling where you can find one
who can do it." Without realizing the
source from which the sentiment springs
instructors at the camp will find themselves
saying, "Surveying is learned by study, by
work and practice—not merely by staying
'round where surveyors, books and instru-
ments are."
While the camp lies in the midst of a
wilderness, it is never-the-less, richly en-
dowed by nature. This natural home of the
white pine still produces trees. These fur-
nish material for stakes in abundance and
the sandy soil offers but little resistance as
the surveyor extemds his line and marks
the necessary stations along it. Douglas
Lake can never be forgotten by those who
have plunged into its waters several times
a. day for a period of eight weeks. The
sandy shore with its convenient docks, the
diving tower, the Michigan Union, the har-
bor, the mess, the sanitary system, the good
drinking water, the camp physician and his
hospital are features which immediately ap-
peal to students, the members of the teaching
staff and visiting friends. The ball diamond
on the hill south of camp, the horseshoe
"courts," an occasional pickerel from the
lake or a trout from Carp Creek, the blue-
berry and the blackberry and even the
Black Fly furnish opportunities for closer
acquaintance and guarantees of pleasant
memories.—or at least memories.
Camp Davis offers the same opportunities
to every student. These opportunities may
be found anywhere from the support of a
common mess to the location of the vernal
equinox. Surveying demands a thorough
preparation in fundamentals. It is difficult
to jump very far without solid ground on
which to stand. To attain success in the
practice of surveying judgment of a some-
what rare type must be developed. Camp
Davis assumes to provide opportunity for
laying a foundation which should support
such judgment. The mastery of funda-
mentals brings confidence and confidence
prepares the way toward the development
of judgment. The camp brings students
into close contact with each other and" with
the teaching staff. Problems that seem re-
mote and obscure in the class room be-
come plain as instructors discuss them at


The Observatory
Hill Auditorium


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the camp, in the field or on the waters of
Douglas Lake.
The summer of 1919 records one of the
most profitable sessions of Camp Davis. It
was a reconstruction camp . For two years
war courses had taken the place of some
of the normally prescribed work. Students,
for the most part, had been soldiers or
sailors in the great war. These men were
obliged to readjust themselves to the de-
mands of civil life and to accept anew
the responsibilities of citizenship. Funda-
mentals which war had wholly disregarded,
or warped in a greater or less degree, were
brought forth from the cloisters of memory
or gleaned from texts that were carefully
laid aside when the nation called for help.
The camp not only maintained its standing
in so far as scholarship is concerned, but
some administrative problems were clarified,
thus laying a better foundation for the
camps that are to come. The camp again
demonstrated the truth of a favorite maxim
of its founder: "When your theory and
your horse-sense do not agree, follow your
horse-sense."
WOUNDED SOLDIERS AT THE
UNIVERSITY.
-The government of the United States
is sending to the University of Michigan
this year about one hundred wounded sold-
iers. These men will take the regular
university courses at the expense of the
government, and are given an allowance
every month to cover all of their expenses.
Men who are unmarried receive) eighty
dollars a month while in attendance at the
University, while those who are married
receive one hundred and twenty dollars.
SEVERAL PROFESSORS LEAVING.
Prof. Bursley has been unable to obtain
leave of absence. He is going to Europe in
order to settle the estate of his mother.
Prof. Buhsley has been unable to obtain
his discharge from the Ordnance Depart-
ment of the Army for another year. His
services in disposing of machinery have
been invaluable.
Prof. Fishleigh has resigned in order to
join the Ford Motor Co. No announce-
ment of his successor has been made.
Prof. Sutherland of the Marine Engineer-
ing Department will be unable to resume his
work at the University for a few weeks.
He has been delayed because of a strike of
dockmen in Sweden.
Mr. Carl Legg has been appointed an
instructor in the Mechanical Engineering
Department.

NEW COURSES IN HIGHWAY
ENGINEERING
Professor Arthur E. Blanchard has been
appointed by the Board of Regents as pro-
fessor of the new course in Highway En-
gineering. The new phase included in Pro-
fessor Blanchard's courses is that of High-
way Transportation, including traffic sur-
veys, classifications, and census. The course
also takes in the different kinds of vehicles
and the roads which are most suitable for
each type of traffic.


227
Of special note to men who have al-
ready graduated is the special course which
will begin shortly before the Christmas
holidays and which will run on until the
first of April. It is not necessary to fin-
ish this course al at once, as it is designed
primarily so that men who are already in
that particular line, or who are road ma-
chinery men, or truck salesmen can get
their Master's degree in Engineering.
There are two fellowships open in this
course. The Detroit Edison fellowship
in Highway Engineering and Mr. R. D.
Chapin's fellowship in Hikhway Engineer-
ing.
The spirit of the whole course is co-
operation with the highway men and other
interested persons, as well as the student
body. As an example of this, Mr. F. Z.
Lane, transportation engineer for the
Packard Company, says that they will be
able to send certain of their men over to
take this course, which will make them
available for intelligent transportaion ser-
vice. A new era of activity for the high-
ways has begun, and it needs trained men
both at the construction and traffic ends.
One of the most important features of
this course is the Davis library of High-
way Engineering. This is the most com-
plete set of books on Highway engineering
and other allied subjects in the country. It
is available to the public as well as to the
student body. In addition to this library
there are of course the chemical and the reg-
ular engineering libraries which will doubt-
less be used also by the advanced students
in Highway Engineering.
RESEARCH WORK IN ELECTRICAL
DEPARTMENT.
This semester there are five students car-
rying on special research work in the Elec-
trical Department. E. E. 18, as this course
is known, is intended primarily for grad-
uates.. Students electing this course while
working under the general supervision of
a member of the faculty are expected to
plan and carry on the work by themselves
and to make a report in the form of a
thesis.
Four students are working under the di-
rection of Prof. Bailey, and are studying
special problems relating to induction mo-
tors. These men have been especially fa-
vored in their work because the University
has secured some new apparatus, among
which are three or four motors, an electric
dynometer, and a potential regulator to
hold electric pressure constant.

rather than just with her athletics. The
alumni of the University should be a source
of information to the faculty regarding
what the outside world wants in the way
of preparation in engineering.

The Alumni Fund is growing. Con-
tributions to the amount of $2,000 have
been received from members of the classes
of 1916, 1917, 1919. and many individual
pledges to swell this fund are being re-
ceived.
With the close of the last fiscal year 120
new endowment members were enrolled in
the Association. By this means $3,300 has
been pledged to the Fund.
The Girls' Dormitories and Hill Audit-
orium, with the Alumni Memorial Hall,
etc., stand as evidence of a growing
spirit on the part of the Michigan Alumni.
In very few years we shall have a fund as
large as Yale, Brown, and Cornell.
The General Alumni Association was
founded about twenty-two years ago from
the separate associations of department
alumni organizations. However, many pro-
fessional men have considered that they
have lost a great deal in being separate
from professional organizations, and for this
reison the separate schools will have spec-
ial editors and sections in the Alumnus,
thought the general organization will be
permanent.

Mortimer H. Cooley


AN APPRECIATION AND BIOGRAPHY
Forty years ago, by congressional act, engineer officers of the Navy
were detailed to various educational institutions for giving special instruc-
tion in steam engineering and ship building. By good fortune, one of these
young officers, one standing exceptionally high in order of merit, fresh
from his overseas practice cruise, and full of old-world romance and the
enthusiasm of a new-world builder, was detailed to one of the middle west
colleges—the University of Michigan, then an institution of broad vision,
but sorely restricted in its equipment and financial resources.
It is unnecessary to recount the years of dogged, optimistic persever-
ance that wrought the ultimate transformation from the first meager equip-
ment of the new department, housed in a small temporary structure, 24 by
36 ft., to the great human laboratory for technical training of today, which
now commands one-fourth of the 8000 seekers after knowledge at the big
Ann Arbor institution, and has placed over 3000 men in active professional
life.
Today, Mortimer Cooley, seasoned executive, diplomatist, arbitrator,
leader of wise men, friend of youth, good fellow, fair fighter and idol of
the thousands who have passed under the wholesome influence of his com-
manding personality, looks back through fragrant clouds from his reflec-
tive pipe and chuckles, and dreams of still greater achievements, greater
institutions of learning, laboratories of human as well as industrial re-
search, greater success in the service of his fellows—in that deft compound-
ing of human wisdom through intimate association with the minds of other
men—so that the discordant notes sometimes sounded, now by labor, now
by capital, may be merged in a greater understanding and a greater serv-
ice.
As Cadet Cooley looked upon life with eager, happy eyes, so does the
President of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers still look upon
life; surveys the restless industrial field today, and plans and plans—that
his honored profession may help to make the world safe for democractic
institutions. Unconsciously, those who know him best rally to his support
with heart and hand. For Mortimer Cooley never forgets a friendly deed,
and demands in all justice, man to man, the same service, the same energy
and the same devotion. He will not tolerate laggards in high or low places,
especially among the parasilic class which seeks to bask in the light of
other men's labors, particularly of young men, but with infinite patience
and good will, the instincts of the true leader of men guide him to give to his
fellows freely of this store of wisdom—not only book knowledge, but of
that vastly more important kind, unnamed, unmeasured, unclassified—call
it diplomacy, personality, instinct, what you will.
Example: Junior college student, known as a "grind" or "crammer."
Studies a day ahead of his class so as to acquire additional luster of schol-


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
arship. Said "shark" is treading the dangerous byways of thermodynamics,
and endeavors to "corner" the attention of the class by asking previous
questions. Without a moment's hesitation, Professor replies with serious,
worried countenance, deprecatingly: "Well now, Mr. Blank, you have got
me absolutely floored; but give me time and I will look it up." Wisdom of
the ancients! Said shark did not tumble for two days, until the class, in
the orderly course of events, suddenly passed by his "piece de resistance"
and blew up his ammunition dump. He nearly died from mortification, but
it was a good lesson. The Professor only winked.
Thus the name of Mortimer Cooley has become synonymous with a
personality, strong, robust, virile, unwavering, but always kindly and help-
ful, magnetically cheerful and profoundly democratic, never brutal in his
admonitions, tricky with his adversaries or to the slightest degree pompous
in his success—in other words, the antithesis of the typical Prussian bur-
eaucrat.
These essentially personal qualities of the individual have brought to
Mortimer Cooley enviable positions of leadership, as the dean of a promi-
nent engineering college, as the arbitrator in numerous cases of valuations
of railroad and other properties aggregating more than a billion, mostly
for the public but frequently also for corporations; as expert technical ad-
visor in many court cases; deputized by the General Staff of the Army to
oversee the important student army training activities in all middle west
colleges, and finally as the head of the American Society of Mechanical En-
gineers, in the most important period of its existence—the period of flux—
when radical and conservative, "fire eater" and "standpatter," straggle for
supremacy, while the world grinds on with its wonted complexity, wait-
ing for the engineer to assume his place as the leader of men in those walks
of life for which he is peculiarly fitted. To such a task Mortimer Cooley
has brought his fortunate gifts and devotion, and his selection was unani-
mous.
To add that he is a member of numerous societies of learning, such
as the United States Naval Institute, the American Society, of Naval Engi-
neers, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science, etc.. indicates what well-seasoned
timber may be found in the ranks of these learned and technical societies.
Mortimer Cooley, born March 28, 1855, was tne fifth member of a
family of eight children, all reared on a farm in Canandaigua Township,
Ontario County, New York. He is of the ninth generation of Cooleys in
this country. Benjamin, the first of the name in this country, came from
England and settled in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1642, where for many
years he was a selectman. Benjamin was an ensign in the Hampshire
Regiment, commanded by Major John Pynchon, in the King Philip War.
He was a weaver by trade and lived not far from Mill River. The Barney
&amp; Berry Skate Factory, overlooking the Connecticut River, is located on
the rear end of the old Cooley homestead. Later a dozen or more Cooleys
owned homes in Longmeadow, four or five miles south of Springfield, on
the other side of Mill River. As the tribe multiplied some of them moved


235
to Granville, Massachusetts, a beautiful and picturesque locality at the south
end of the Green Mountains. The fourth generation were living in Gran-
ville prior to the Revolutionary War. Mortimer Cooley's great-grandfather
John was a cattle drover. His trips took him west as far as Ohio. Canan-
daigua, New York, must have appealed to him strongly as it did to a num-
ber of others who came there from Granville. John took up his home there
soon after 1790.
To "grow up" on a farm is a great heritage. One learns how to ''do
the chores," and thus to take a man's real place in human society. Such
book learning as one got was in the district schools supplemented, it might
be, by a year or two in the fine old academies of those days. Seldom did
a farmer's son have the opportuntiy to go to college. He must indeed have
been ambitious and persistent to get beyond the academy, and relatively
few got even that far. Mortimer Cooley spent three terms in the old Can-
andaigua Academy. He boarded himself two winter terms and walked
from his home, three and one-half miles away, one spring term, "doing
the chores" morning and evening. That and taking care of the garden
Saturdays were the conditions which secured for him the unusual privilege
of being excused from regular farm work. For two winters he taught
district school and in that way earned the money needed to pay his expenses
at the Academy and to finance his next step towards an education.
It was in the summer of 1874 that Mortimer Cooley was able to rea-
lize the ambition of his life for a career on the high seas. The four-year
course for cadet engineers had just been established at the U. S. Naval Acad-
emy and appointments were open to competition. Of some seventy can-
didates who tried the examination, twenty-five were appointed; Mortimer
Cooley passed seventh and four years later graduated seventh in a class
of fourteen. He took an active part in athletics, was captain of his class
crew, and stood high with the foil and broadswords. There were no varsity
teams in those days.
On graduating from the Naval Academy, Cadet Engineer Cooley was
assigned to the U. S. S. Quinnebaug, which sailed in the fall of 1878 to the
Mediterranean. He returned on the U. S. S. Alliance a year later and on
Christmas day, 1879, was married to Carolyn Elizabeth Moseley, of Fair-
port, New York. The Alliance, after being overhauled at the Norfolk
Navy Yard, cruised on the North Atlantic Station from Newfoundland to
the West Indies. While the ship was at Port Royal, S. C, a telegram came
to Cadet Engineer Cooley announcing the arrival of his first born. She
being the first child of the class, his classmates took upon themselves the
responsibility of naming her with appropriate naval ceremonies. She was
duly christened Alliance, in the ship's honor, and if the tales of rear admi-
rals of today who were cadets in those days are to be believed, the occasion
was a notable one in the annals of the Navy.
Cadet Engineer Cooley was forthwith detached and ordered home for
a few weeks, then to the Bureau of Steam Engineering at the Navy De-
partment. In June, 1881, he was examined and promoted to Assistant En-
gineer and in August was ordered to the University of Michigan to teach


steam engineering and iron shipbuilding. At the end of three years, on re-
quest of the Regents, his detail was continued a fourth year. Being then de-
tached and ordered to the Pacific Station, the Regents conferred on Assist-
ant Engineer Cooley the honorary degree of Mechanical Engineer and in-
vited him to resign and accept the chair in Mechanical Engineering. This
he did, his resignation taking effect December 31, 1885. It was with a great
deal of regret that he resigned, as he was in love with the Service. There
was at the time no prospect for any great increase in the naval force, and
it seemed to him the opportunity for real work afforded him at the Univer-
sity ought not to be declined.
Professor Cooley has given his entire life since he was twenty-six
years of age to university work—thirty-eight years up to now. He has been
Dean for fifteen years, having been appointed in February, 1904. The
Michigan Agricultural College conferred on him the degree of LL.D. in
1907, and the University of Nebraska the degree of Eng. D. in 1911. When
he came to the University there were but sixty or seventy engineering stu-
dents out of a total of about thirteen hundred in the University, and the
entire technical work in engineering was done in seven rooms at the south
end of the main university building. The first engineering laboratory was
built the winter after he came. It was a two-story brick veneer building
24x36 feet, costing $1500 and the equipment $1000. In it Professor Cooley
himself taught forging, pattern making and machine shop practice. It was
styled by his colleagues "the Scientific Blacksmith Shop." It was the be-
ginning of an effort, now altogether general, to give to engineering stu-
dents, while in college, some practical knowledge of the materials and pro-
cesses used in the execution of engineering projects.
But Professor Cooley could not wean himself altogether from the naval
service. He was from 1895 to 1911 the Chief Engineer officer of the Michi-
gan State Naval Brigade and is now a retired officer in the Brigade. In
1898 he returned to the Navy as Chief Engineer during the Spanish War.
He was attached to the U. S. S. Yosemite and later to the League Island
Navy Yard, his period of service being altogether about ten months His
honorable discharge was handed him by the Commandant of the navy
yard with words of commendation for his efficient work.
While on blockade duty off San Juan, P. R., the Yosemite engaged in a
five-hour battle with the Spanish forts, gunboats and torpedo boats follow-
ing the interception of the Antonio Lopez, a Spanish cruiser loaded with mu-
nitions, putting into the harbor. During the blockade a serious fire broke
out in the coal bunkers of the Yosemite, which for a time threatened seri-
ous consequences. The fire was deep down and could not be reached. Chief
Engineer Cooley, recalling the method of sinking piles on western rivers by
means of a water pipe attached to the pile, had a hose and nozzle triced to a
long slice-bar. with which, under fire pressure from the pumps, the fires
were successfully quenched. The slice-bar could be shoved down into the
coal like a knife into soft butter.
Following his return to the University in 1899. Professor Cooley was
invited by the Citizens' Committee of Detroit, of which Governor Pingree


was Chairman, to appraise the power plants, rolling stock and stores and
supplies of the Detroit street railways, which the city was contemplating
purchasing. It was a hurry job and was done in a hurry. The appointment
was made on Friday, the staff organized Saturday and the report submitted
the following Saturday covering $2,000,000 of property. The following
year, 1900, at the request of Governor Pingree, the Board of State Tax
Commissioners, and the Board of State Auditors, Professor Cooley under-
too to appraise the specific tax paying properties of the State of Michigan,
which included the Steam Railroads, the Telegraphs, the Telephones, the
Plank Roads and the River Improvements. This was late in August. The
field work was completed in ninety days and the results submitted at the
end of December in time for the incoming Legislature. The work involved
the inspection of 10,000 miles of track, thirty odd thousands of the freight
cars, all the passenger and special equipments, all the locomotives, tele-
graph, and telephone lines, in short everything involved in the different
kinds of properties. Some one-hundred-fifty men were employed. The
total of the appraisal was about $240,000,000.
As a result of this work the Legislature enacted laws placing the rail-
roads on an ad valorem tax basis, which increased their taxes threefold
and more. When the assessment was made under the new law in 1903, the
railroads brought suit to enjoin their collection. This made necessary an-
other appraisal as at the date of the assessment in which the value found for
the railroads was $240,000,000, an increase of $40,000,000, due largely to
using 1903 prices for labor and materials instead of the average from 1890
to 1900. The case was carried to the U. S. Supreme Court and being finally
decided in favor of the State, brought into the state treasury twelve or fif-
teen millions in back taxes.
Michigan's pioneer work in valuation of large public utility properties
was soon followed by other states. First among them was Wisconsin in a
valuation of her steam railroads. Substantially the same methods were em-
ployed as in Michigan. Professor Cooley was consulting engineer.
In the twenty years which have elapsed since that first apraisal in De-
troit, Professor Cooley has had charge of many hundreds of appraisals in
various states and municipalities, in most of them employed by the public.
In all of them he has stood consistently for correct results regardless of em-
ployer, "hewing to the line, letting the chips fall where they may." In the
aggregate the value of property appraised under his direction lies somewhere
between one and one-quarter and one and one-half billion dollars.
Nor has Professor Cooley neglected opportunities to serve in other ca-
pacities. He was for a time chairman of the Board of Fire Commissioners,
and President of the Common Council in Ann Arbor in 1890-91. He served
on the Board of Awards for the World's Fair in Chicago in 1893, and for
the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo. He has for twenty-five years
served as mechanical expert in patent cases, and testified many times on
mechanical matters before juries and commissions. He was for five years
(1907-1912) chairman of the Block Signal and Train Control Board of the
Interstate Commerce Commission.


Professor Cooley is a Fellow of the American Association for the Ad-
vancement of Science, member of the American Society of Mechanical En-
gineers, American Society of Civil Engineers, American Institute of Con-
sulting Engineers, Franklin Institute, Society for the Promotion of Engi-
neering Education, Society of Naval Engineers, Michigan Engineering So-
ciety, Detroit Engineering Society, Sigma Phi, Tail Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, the
Army and Navy Clubs in Washington and in New York, the Detroit Club
and Yondotega Club in Detroit.
Professor and Mrs. Mortimer Cooley have four children, three daugh-
ters and one son. All are married and seven grandchildren now keep them
from growing old. The son is a Commander in the United States Navy.
Thus has Mortimer Cooley established his record of unusual accom-
plishment and honest devotion to his democratic ideals. And he is still
"doing the chores."


W. L. BADGER
Condensers
The subject of condensers is covered fully in many works on steam
engineering, and no attempt will be made to go deeply into the subject here.
It will be sufficient to describe briefly the various types, and their relation
to each other and to the conditions met with in evaporator work.
To describe a condenser fully involves classifying it from more than
one standpoint, hence a strictly systematic classification cannot be made.
Condensers are generally classified as:
A. Surface condensers.
B. Contact condensers.
1. Parallel-current.
2. Counter-current.
Strictly speaking, surface condensers may also be classified as parallel or
counter-current, but the distinction is of little significance. But in addition
to the above, condensers may also be classified as to whether they are wet or
dry; and as to whether they are barometric or non-barometric. Though all
combinations of the above are possible, certain ones are commonest. For
instance, a counter-current barometric condenser is always a dry condenser;
and a parallel-current non-barometric condenser is almost always a wet con-
denser.
Taking up the points in the above systems of classification, we may de-
fine a surface condenser as one where the heat of the steam has to pass
through a metal surface before it reaches the cooling water; while in a con-
tact condenser (jet condenser is a term sometimes loosely used for this
class) the water comes into direct contact with the steam. A parallel current
condenser is one in which the air and other non-condensed gases leave the
condenser at the temperature of the warmest water; while in a counter-
current condenser the non-condensed gases leave the condenser at the temp-
erature of the coolest water. A barometric condenser is one mounted in
such a way that the waste water leaves it by gravity; in a non-barometric
condenser a pump is used to remove the water.
Fig. i shows a small and simple surface condenser. Surface condensers
have been greatly improved in recent years with the development of the
steam turbine; but such expensive and elaborate installations are seldom
necessary for evaporator work. In the condenser here illustrated the con-
denser proper is mounted directly upon the combined pumps which operate
it. The steam to be condensed enters at A. Cooling water enters the pump
cylinder to the right at B. is pumped into the condenser at C, passes to the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
left through the lower half of the tubes and back again through the upper
tubes to be discharged at D. It is either wasted or cooled and returned. The
condensed water and non-condensed gases are drawn out of the condenser
by the left pump cylinder at E and discharged at F.
Fig. 1
Fin. 2
In general a surface condenser will be used in power plant work
where a high vacuum is desired. Since a high vacuum is seldom necessary
in evaporator work, the surface condenser is not used unless it is desirable
to recover the condensed water or other liquid. It often happens that there
is a place in a chemical process where heating is necessary; and under such
conditions that the vapors from the evaporator can be used. In such a case


241
the liquor heater becomes in effect a surface condenser, though it will usually
be followed by a contact condenser to give the desired vacuum. But as a
general thing, surface condensers are little used for evaporator work.

Fie. 3
Fig. 2 shows a very simple form of parallel-current, wet, non-baro-
metric condenser. The steam to be condensed enters at A and the cooling
water enters at B. There is a device to spray the cooling water into the
body of the condenser. Warm water and non-condensed gases are drawn
off by the pump. This condenser is a contact condenser because the cooling
water and steam come into direct contact. It is parallel current because the
non-condensed gases leave at the temperature of the warm water, it is wet
condenser because the same pump handles both air and water. This is
about the cheapest and simplest type. Because of its low first cost and the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
small space required it is often used on small installations; and it will give a
vacuum good enough for ordinary evaporator work.
Fig. 3 shows a common type of parallel-current condenser for larger
installations. The inlets for steam and water and the method of distribut-

ing the water are evident. The throat of the condenser is constricted at
the point where the water leaves; and by thus increasing the velocity of the
water, the condenser may be made to create its own vacuum by the injector
action in this constricted throat. Thus the condenser may be mounted high
enough to act as a barometric condenser and yet remove its own air without
a special pump. To do this requires a large amount of water. If the supply
of water is limited, or for anv other reason the injector action is not sufficient.


an air pump may be attached to the smaller flange to the left just below the
steam inlet; in which case the condenser would be a parallel-current dry
barometric condenser.
Fig. 4 shows a counter-current dry barometric condenser—the type
usually preferred for large evaporator installations. There are many types
of constuction employed, but this example shows the essential features.
Steam enters the large opening on the right, and rises through the cascades
of cooling water, condensing as it rises, till only air is left to be drawn
off from the small connection at the top. Water enters at the small upper
inlet at the right, is distributed over a series of baffles to bring it into thor-
ough contact with the steam, and finally leaves by gravity at the bottom. It
must be remembered that to ust gravity discharge of this hot water the
condenser vessel must be located at least 30 to 35 feet above the point of dis-
charge or "hot well."
Fig. 5 shows a modification of the parallel-current wet condenser using
the injector principle for removing non-condensed gases. Here the incom-
ing water is given a high velocity in the jets at N. The vanes CT serve to
direct the steam into contact with this water without disturbing the jets; and
water and air together leave at C. In this case the velocity of the water
is so high that its energy is great enough to overcome the pressure of the
atmosphere. Consequently this condenser will discharge not only the non-
condensed gases, but the hot water also, without the*use of a pump or a
barometric leg.
Several illustrations in a previous article1 show the arrangement of con-
densers in relation to evaporators.
. Condenser Theory
Let t0=inlet temperature of cooling water.
t^exit temperature of water.
t„=exit temperature of air.
t=temperature of steam to be condensed.
p0=total pressure in the condenser.
pa=partial pressure of air.
p„=partial pressure of water vapor.
n=lbs. water used per lb. steam condensed.
r=latent heat of steam at the temperature t.
W=total weight of water used per minute.
D=total weight of steam condensed per minute.
Then the amount of heat that must be extracted from each pound of steam
is r+(t - t,) ; and the amount of heat that can be taken up by each pound
of cooling water is t, - t0. Then
n=[r+(t-t1)]/(t1-t0)
and W=nD.
"Tech nic, May, 1919, p. 84, ff."


The difference in operation of parallel and counter-current condensers
is also an important consideration. The diagrams in Fig. 6 indicate the
pressure relations in the two types. Horizontal distances represent dis-
tances along the condenser body, and vertical distances represent pressures.
It is assumed that the cross-section of the passages in the condenser are suf-
ficient so that there is no drop in pressure between different parts; in other
words, p0 is uniform throughout the condenser. This is essentially the con-
dition in actual practice.
At any point in the condenser the total pressure will be made up of the
partial pressures of air and water vapor, or
Po=Pa+Pw
The steam entering the condenser contains a certain but small percent of
air, hence pa at the steam inlet end is very small, and the same in both
cases.
In the counter-current condenser pw at the inlet for the water is very
small, because the temperature of the water is low. Hence pa must be
larger; that is, the air is denser and consequently needs a smaller pump to
remove it. This is the most obvious advantage of the counter-current con-
denser, but the least important one.
The air which is pumped out of either condenser is not dry air but a
mixture of air and water vapor. The concentration of air in this mixture is
Pa/Po- Suppose that in a parallel current condenser the amount of water
fed was so small that its final temperature was t—that is, the same as that
of the steam. Then pw at the exit would be the same as pw at the inlet; and
if p0 is to be constant, pa would be the same at the exit as at the inlet. In
other words, the air pump would have to remove a mixture of steam and
air in which the concentration of air was the same as in the steam entering;
which means that the steam could not be condensed at all but would be
simply pumped out in the same condition as when it entered. Hence, in
order to have a mixture of air and steam to remove which shall have a reas-
onably large concentration of air and hence have a reasonably small volume,
the water must never rise to the temperature of the steam—that is, tt must
always be less than t.
On the other hand, in a counter-current condenser, the question of the
temperature of the exit water has nothing to do with the vapor pressure of
water in the air-water mixture to be removed by the air pump. There is no
reason at all why the water in a counter-current condenser may not rise to
the temperature of the steam, without interfering with the operation; pro-
vided always that there is sufficient contact between water and steam to
condense all the steam before it gets to the air outlet.
But, referring to the formula for the amount of water needed by a
condenser, we see that the important temperature is that of the water leav-
ing (t,). The larger ti, the larger the denominator of the fraction, and
hence the smaller the amount of water needed per pound of steam. Hence


we see that the important distinction between parallel and counter-current
condensers is that the parallel-current condenser, for the same vacuum and
the same inlet water temperature, will always require much more water.
Therefore, when an evaporator is small and its operating costs correspond-
ingly low, we generally use a parallel-current condenser; for its higher
water consumption will not offset its lower first cost. But as the size of the
installation increases, and the water for a condenser becomes an increasingly
large item, a point is reached where the saving in water by a counter-current
condenser more than offsets its larger first cost. So we nearly always find
counter-current condensers on large installations.
The question may be raised as to why we do not consider the highest
possible vacuum desirable for evaporator work. In steam turbine practice
every half inch of vacuum is carried that the equipment will permit, and the
design of condensers is being intensively studied to increase the vacuum
which may be carried. In evaporator work, on the other hand, we often
find a vacuum of 26 inches, and seldom more than 28 inches, on a 30 inch
barometer.
In steam turbine work, the work recovered is a function of the volume
to which the steam may be expanded. Therefore, the higher the vacuum, the
larger the final volume of the steam and the greater the amount of work
recovered from a pound of steam. But in evaporator work the vacuum only
influences the temperature, and hence the temperature drop. And the tem-
perature drop affects the capacity of an evaporator much less at the lower
end of the range than at the upper. Lowering the temperature of the last
effect by five degrees does not add as much to the capacity of the evaporator
as raising the temperature of the first effect one degree. Hence, since high
vacuum costs money, and more money per inch of vacuum the higher it is
pushed, we usually are content in evaporator work with 26 to 27 inches of
vacuum on a 30 inch barometer.
Air Pumps
The pumps used to remove the mixture of air and water from a wet
condenser generally do not differ materially from ordinary steam pumps and
need no special description. Dry air pumps are usually expected to create
a higher vacuum and have some special features. Fig. 7 shows the air
cylinder of a dry air pump. A is the inlet from the condenser, B is the main
piston, and C is the slide valve. No piston can be made or operated so that
there will not be some clearance between the piston and the. cylinder wall at
the end of the stroke. Assume for example that this space is 10 per cent
of the displacement in one stroke. Then, when the vacuum in the condenser
has been reduced to 0.1 atmosphere, the air drawn into the cylinder on the
suction stroke will just reach one atmosphere when fully compressed into
the clearance at the end of the stroke and therefore cannot escape into the
air. On the return stroke it will merely re-expand and prevent any more
air bing drawn into the cylinder from the condenser. Hence if the clear-
ance is i/nth of the displacement, no higher vacuum than i/n atmosphere
may be reached. To obviate this difficulty what is called an equalizing port


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
is added to the valve. When the piston reached the position shown in Fig. 7,
the slide valve was first so placed that port 3 connected port 5 with the dis-
charge D. This allowed any excess air to escape but left the clearance space
Fig. 7

filled with air at atmospheric pressure. At the same time port 4 had connect-
ed port 6 with the inlet so that the other end of the cylinder is full of air at
condenser pressure. Before the piston reverses its travel (to move to the
right) the valve B will have moved (to the right) first so as to cut off port
6 from the inlet and port 5 from the outlet. Next port 2 will connect port
5 with 6. This means that the air in the clearance at the left end of the
cylinder will expand into the right end of the cylinder, leaving both spaces at
a little above condenser pressure. Hence on the next stroke it is assured
that (he compression in the clearance will be greater than atmospheric pres-
sure, so that some air will escape ; and before the suction stroke is completed


247
Fig. 9
Fig. 10
the pressure in the left end of the cylinder will fall below that of the con-
denser, so that some new air will be drawn in. Hence, with the equalizing
port, the vacuum is not limited by the ratio of clearance to displacement.
Fig. 8 shows the same arrangement applied to a rotary valve. The lettering


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
is the same as for Fig. 7, and the operation is exactly the same as described
above.
Fig. 9 shows a vacuum pump for use with wet condensers which is dif-
ferent from the type mentioned above. Water and air enter at A and drain
Fig. 11
into the conical bottom. As the conical piston B comes down it splashes
water and air through the ports shown into the inside of the cylinder above
the piston. The curved upper walls of the bottom part of the pump direct
these splashes in through the ports. As the piston rises the air is trapped
above the water as soon as the ports are passed; and is forced out through
the valve shown; to be discharged at C. Since there is water to be discharged
at each stroke, there is more than enough to fill all the clearances above the
piston and hence the air discharge is positive and complete.


Recently an entirely different type of air pump has been developed for
condenser service. Fig. 10 shows one representative of this class. It con-
sists of an ordinary centrifugal pump drawing water through the passages
B and discharging through nozzles into the passages C. A are ports con-
nected to the condenser, and the water issuing from the impeller of the
pump and passing into the nozzles acts like a water-jet suction pump to
carry air with it. Though this pump handles water and air together, it is not
necessarily a wet pump so far as concerns the condenser operation. The wa-
ter used may be as cold as is desired; hence the air may be discharged under
the same conditions as were prescribed above for a counter-current dry con-
denser when discussing the advantages of this type of condenser. Of course,
if this pump uses the hot water from the condenser itself it becomes a wet
vacuum pump.
Removal of Condensed Water
There are many systems for handling the condensate from evaporators,
but all involve some combination of pumps or traps. If the steam space is
above atmospheric pressure, the condensed water is generally taken out by
a trap. If the steam space is below atmospheric, the condensate is some-
times pumped out and sometimes removed by a trap. Hence a consider-
ation of traps is important in this connection.
There are very many traps on the market, and no attempt can be made
to describe all or even all important types. Only one of each class will be
mentioned; and it is to be understood that for each class described there are
many representatives.
Traps may be divided into the following classes:
1. Expansion.
2. Float.
3. Bucket.
4. Tilt.
In addition, traps may be either return or non-return, though this distinction
applies particularly to tilt traps. A return is a trap which will discharge
water to a place of higher pressure (or elevation) than the space which it
drains. A non-return trap will only discharge to a place of lower pressure.
Fig. 11 represents a simple expansion trap. A is the steam inlet, B is the
valve, and C is a cartridge containing a corrugated thin-walled tube D. Be-
tween the wall of the cartridge and the corrugated tube is an oil. The valve
disc is attached to the inside of the corrugated tube. When the trap is filled
with water the oil is contracted and the valve is open. When all the water
has drained out and steam strikes the cartridge the oil expands and closes
the valve. This is only good for small capacities. It is evidently a non-
return trap as it will only discharge into a space of lower pressure than that
of the steam space it drains.
Fig. 12 represents a float trap. Water from the space to be drained
enters at the connection marked "inlet" and collects in the body. When it
rises high enough to actuate the float, the needle valves shown are opened


THE MICHIGAN TECHNJC
and the pressure of the steam behind the trap forces the water out. This is
also a non-return trap.
Bucket traps are somewhat similar to float traps in that the valve
Fig. 12

SEAT
VALVS
Fig. 13
mechanism is operated by a floating device. They differ in that the water
to be discharged enters the floating device, while in float traps proper the
float is always closed. Fig. 13 is one type of bucket trap. The trap has filled
with water to such an extent that the bucket has filled and dropped, open-


251
ing the discharge valve. The pressure of the steam in the space being
drained forces out the water, but before it is all gone and the outlet un-
sealed for the escape of steam, the bucket will rise and close the valve. This
again is a non-return trap.
Fig. 14 is a return tilt trap. A pear-shaped cast iron bowl A is mounted
on a trunnion and supported by a counterweight E. The trunnion is held in
a semi-circular yoke, which is shown in front view to the right. The trun-
nion is divided in the middle, so that water flowing in at D passes only into
the neck of the bowl. Pipe K connects the inside of the bowl with the left
half of the trunnion and yoke and the valves I and J. During filling J
is open and is piped to the space being drained to equalize the inside of the
bowl with that space. When enough water has accumulated to overbalance
the counterweight, the bowl drops, and in so doing the lever G lifts the valve
stem H and closes valve J, at the same time opening valve I. Valve I is con-
Fig. 14
nected to high-pressure steam and the pressure so introduced into the top
of the bowl forces the water back out through the right half of the trun-
nion G to the space desired. By the arrangement of two check valves as
shown in Fig. 15 the discharge of the trap does not affect the space drained.
These tilt traps are also made non-return.
In draining the condensate from single effect evaporators or the first
effects of multiple effects, the condensed water is usually returned to the
boiler. This either calls for a pump or a non-return trap; the non-return
trap discharging to an open feed tank from which the boiler feed is taken.
In draining from succeeding effects, or from any space under a vacuum, a
return trap is needed to discharge even into an open tank. Water from
these later effects usualy is not needed in the boiler, as water representing
all the steam used was returned from the first effect. Enough may be used
from the second effect to provide make-up.
In handling water from multiple effect evaporators many systems are
used, but they are more or less modifications of two. One is to take the
water from each effect by a return trap or pump. The other is to pass the
condensed water from one steam chest to the steam chest of the next effect,
or to a receiver located directly under the steam chest of the next effect and
equalized into it. In this method only non-return traps need be used, as


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
there is the pressure drop between the effects to operate the non-return
traps. Since the condensed water of one effect is superheated with respect
to the steam space of the next effect, by this method there is a small amount
of flash in each receiver which may be returned to the steam chest into which
* *TEAM
Fig. is
the receiver is equalized. Thus all the condensate is withdrawn finally at the
temperature of the last effect. Many think that the complications so intro-
duced are more expensive than a loss of the heat in the condensate. Very
complicated systems appear in plants such as sugar mills, where condensed
water is recovered not only from multiple effect evaporators but also from
a wide variety of other heating and evaporating apparatus under many dif
ferent pressures.


PROFESSOR W. H. HOBBS
Geysers, of which about one hundred are found in the Yellowstone Na-
tional Park, are boiling springs which violently erupt a mixture of hot water
and steam either at regular or irregular intervals. The heat necessary to
boil the water is supplied from uncooled silicious volcanic lavas which arc
hidden beneath the surface and from which the silica which separates out
as "geyserite" and builds a bowl at the geyser mouth is derived.
The eruptions within the geyser are easily explained when the general
form of the water column standing below the bowls is taken into consider-
ation, and this action is easily illustrated by the use of simple apparatus
which may be operated in the lecture room. The water of the geyser stands
in a column probably near the vertical and in most cases at least fifty feet
in depth and the heat appears to be supplied in the form of superheated
steam which enters from lateral fissures in the walls enclosing the column.
This steam steadily raises the temperature of the geyser water, which dur-
ing eruptions is suddenly cooled by its ejection into the air and its subsequent
return in large part to the column of water below.
The separation of the silica from the boiling water to form the bowl
has the effect of contracting the opening and so preventing the easy liber-
ation of steam, and it thus shortens the period between eruptions while in
creasing the height of the ejected column of water in the same manner as
does the reduction in diameter of the nozzle of a garden hose.
The column of water beneath the surface of the geyser is probably
heated for the most part at considerable depths and, because of slow con-
ventional circulation, it is in consequence at those depths much hotter than
the water which is slowly boiling at the top of the column. It is kept from
boiling in the lower levels because at these levels there is sustained the pres-
sure from the column of water above, and this pressure has the effect of
elevating the temperature at which water will boil. In one of the Icelandic
geysers which was carefully studied the water began to boil first at a depth
of forty-five feet, and the steam thus liberated by its expansion suddenly
lifted the column of water. This sudden lifting of the upper portion of the
water column when boiling begins at some depth is the reason that the gey-
sers overflow just before eruption, but this elevation of the column is also
essential to the suddenness of the eruption, because superheated water is
thereby brought to levels at which the pressure is greatly reduced, the boil-
ing point lowered, and the mass suddenly bursts into steam which ejects a
large amount of water along with it. Cooled in the air and largely returned
from the bowl to the water column below, a certain length of time is neces-
sary before the steam continually entering from the walls is able to bring
the water again to the boiling point at a low level.
The silica which is separated from the water to build up the bowls and


terraces owes its rapid deposition to the work of organisms living in the
water, and these algae produce a deposit an inch in thickness in the same
time that a layer one-one hundred and sixtieth the thickness will be pro-
duced by the simple process of evaporization.
Geysers of somewhat similar nature are found in New Zealand and in
Iceland, though by far the finest examples are found in the Yellowstone Na-
tional Park. In Iceland it has been common to shorten the period between
eruptions by dumping into the geyser a barrow-load of sods so as to pre-
vent the escape of the steam and promote the quick boiling of the water.
In the Yellowstone Park, until the practice was prohibited, a similar effect
was produced in a different way by soaping the geysers. After the destruc-
tion of the magnificent Excelsior Geyser by this means, severe penalties were
imposed for any repetition of the practice.


PROFESSOR J. E. EMSWILER
The following article is intended primarily for the student. All students
of engineering are concerned with the probem of the sources of energy and
the development and operation of engines and mechanisms for its trans-
mutation from one form to another. In view of this general interest of all
engineers, every engineering student is required to take a course in Heat
Engines, in order that he may have an opportunity to become familiar with
the fundamental principles upon which they operate. This article is offered
with the hope that it may afford some assistance in acquiring a better con-
ception of some of those fundamentals which are somewhat elusive. The
more standpoints from which they can be viewed, the more likely it is that
some one will be found which will appeal to the individual as particularly
enlightening.
If there is one single thing that distinguishes our present age from past
eras more than any other, it is the use of power in vast quantities for the
service of mankind.
One hundred years ago, our energy supplies had hardly been recognized
because agencies for their utilization had been scarce more than invented, to
say nothing of being developed. However, scientific thinkers and inventors
were becoming very active in studying the fundamental physical laws that
were already discovered, and attempting to utilize them in connection with
the development of heat engines, and it was in that period that foundations
of the science of thermodynamics were laid.
Almost without exception, possibly with no exception, our supply of
energy, whether of the mechanical, electrical, or kinetic form, comes primar-
ily from the heat form. For us as engineers, it is sufficient to say that our
primary source of energy is heat. A heat engine is a mechanism or assem-
blage of mechanisms for converting heat energy into usefuly work. All
prime movers are therefore heat engines, viewed from this angle. It is at
once obvious that a gas engine, or steam engine (more properly a steam
plant) is a heat engine. But the statement that the windmill and the water
turbine are heat engines also, may not be accepted at once without some
thought. The motive force of the windmill is derived from the kinetic
energy of air currents, which in turn are induced by the unequal heating of
air in different areas of the earth's surface by the sun's rays. The water
turbine is operated by water in passing from one level to another in a
properly designed and constructed channel. How was the water elevated
to its high level? By the sun's rays causing evaporation of the water from
exposed surfaces, the energy thus applied rendering the working substance
(H20) buoyant in the atmosphere, resulting in its elevation in the clouds.
Upon condensation the water falls to the ground and some of it is utilized
to operate our turbine.


The windmill and the turbine are links in a chain of events which con-
stitute a thermodynamic cycle. In one sense, therefore, they are to be
classed as heat engines; they deliver useful work from heat energy. In
another sense, they are not heat engines, since they do not in themselves
change heat into work. All the thermal processes involved take place en-
tirely outside these mechanisms. Nature furnishes nearly all the machin-
ery for the power plants of which they are a part.
There are four essential elements necessary for a heat engine:
a. A working substance.
b. A heat source.
c. A heat utilizer.
d. A refrigerator.
The working substance loads up with heat at the source, carrying its
load to the heat utilizer, where a portion is changed to mechanical work.
Not all the heat energy can be converted into work; some of it remains in the
form of heat. However, in passing through the heat utilizer, it is rendered
unavailable; it is no longer useful as a source supply and must be rejected
from the working substance, in order to make room for a new load at the
beginning of another cycle. The refrigerator is the dumping place for the
unavailable heat. Into it is rejected all energy that is legitimately or origin-
ally unavailable in a system; and into it is sunk all energy that has been
rendered unavailable through wastage and losses.
The great refrigerator for all heat engines is the atmosphere. Heat can
be unloaded from one vehicle to another only when the temperature of the
first is higher than that of the second, except with outside assistance. The
refrigerator of a system is the medium which possesses the lowest available
temperature. The atmospheric air, circulating freely, tends to reduce the
temperature of all objects and media within a given vicinity, to a common
level of temperature, which, in general, is the lowest available temperature.
The working substance makes connection among the source, utilizer and
refrigerator. Any given portion of the mass of the substance may be acted
upon by these agents, either sequentially or simultaneously. In the case of
the steam plant, the working substance (H20) is first affected by the heat
source—the boiler. It then acts upon the heat utilizer, and is finally passed
along to the refrigerator. The heat effects, referred to the working sub-
stance, are sequential. In a gas engine, the charge of working substance
(air) may be receiving heat from the combustion of the fuels; may be ex-
panding and doing work upon the piston; and may be in the process of being
cooled by the water jacket, all at the same time. The heat effects, referred
to the working substance, are here simultaneous.
The first law of thermodynamics expresses the fact that whenever heaf
is changed into work, a certain definite number of work units appear for
each heat unit destroyed. Or, when work energy is changed into heat, that
same definite number of work units disappear for each unit of heat, created.
So far as the first Law of Thermodynamics is concerned, there is nothing to
prevent us from believing that, whenever a given quantity of heat is fur-


nished to a working substance, we can possibly get the equivalent of that
energy out of the working substance as work, provided we overlook all
inefficiencies in our heat utilizer. Unfortunately, experience and theoretical
analysis show that such is not the case. When we load up the working sub-
stance with a quantity of heat H, we can not expect to get an amount of
work equivalent to the heat energy H. This is, in effect, the Second Law
of Thermodynamics: viz., of a given quantity of heat supplied, only a frac-
tion can possibly be converted into work; the remainder will persist as heat.
To make the statement of the First Law complete, it is necessary to say
how many work units are the equivalent of one heat unit, or vice versa. In
our system of English units, 778 ft. pounds represent the same amount of
energy as one B. T. U. In like manner, it is necessary to be able to state
some definite relation between the available and unavailable portions of a
given heat quantity. The case is not so simple here, as is that of the First
Law. It can not be disposed of by direct experiment, but must be arrived at
by analysis.
The available portion of a given quantity of heat is best thought of as
that amount which a perfect heat engine could convert into work. This is
not an answer to the investigation, but it indicates a line of inquiry. It also
shows why direct experiment is out of the question. We have no perfect
heat engine to experiment with. Sadi Carnot, a Frenchman, was the first
to work out the problem. He presented his results about 1825 or 1830.
which was some ten or fifteen years previous to Joule's establishment of the
value of J (778). The Second Law of Thermodynamics, therefore, as a
demonstrated fact, precedes the First.
How will a perfect heat engine work? Upon what cycle should it per-
form its function? A cycle refers to a succession of events with respect to
the working substance—its reception and rejection of heat and transmuta-
tion of heat and work. Carnot invented the cycle which bears his name; and
proved that an engine operating upon it could not be exceeded in efficiency
by an engine operating upon any other cycle. Other cycles might equal, but
none could exceed it. Hence, if the efficiency of a Carnot cycle can be
worked out, it may be considered as the fraction of the entire amount of
heat supplied, which can possibly be changed into work. This fraction is
(Tt—T2)/T1where Ti is the highest available temperature, and T„ is the
lowest.
It is not difficult to prove that the efficiency of a Carnot engine is(Tx—
T^/Ti (T2)/Tj But it is not so easy to prove that the Carnot en-
gine is the most efficient engine possible.
The first essential of a perfect heat engine is reversibility. The term
here alludes to heat processes, of course, and not to direction of mechanical
operation. A reversible cycle is a series of operations, each one of which
is reversible, in this thermodynamic sense. A reversible operation is one
in which there is a steady and controlled balance between the forces involved.
An illustration will serve to assist in establishing a physical conception of
what a reversible process means.
Imagine an inclined plane connecting the upper floor of a building with


the cellar. There is a car which runs on the plane, and there is attached to
one end of the car, by a suitable hook, a rope which runs over a pulley, be-
yond the head of the incline and to the end of which a weight is fastened.
The connection between car and pulley is such that the rope is parallel to the
incline. All the mechanisms are assumed to be frictionless. There is a sup-
ply of sand bags, or other weights, on the top floor, which can be loaded
upon the car. The weight of the load on the car is available for doing work
upon the weight which the rope raises vertically.
Now let sand bags be loaded on the truck in just sufficient amount to
lift the weight on the rope. As the car descends its own weight and the load
are just balanced by the vertical moving weight. The slightest excess pres-
sure by the operator causes the system to function. Always there is steady
and orderly operation. When the car reaches the bottom of the incline, the
potential energy of position originally possessed by the sand bags has been
transferred to potential energy of position in the weight, which is the objec-
tive sought.
The operation can now be reversed, if desired. The operator can cause
the elevated weight to pull the car and its load back to its original position.
His energy system is then in exactly the same condition as it was at first.
He need not call in any assistance from outside sources of energy. The
descent of the loaded car is a reversible operation.
Suppose that somewhere along the inclined plane there is a step—an
abrupt descent. Imagine the loaded car descending again, doing work upon
the weight, arriving at the bottom of the incline as before, having success-
fully dropped at the step. Can the operator retrace the process, causing the
elevated weight to bring the car back to its initial position? He can not do
so without resorting to an extraneous supply of energy. The original oper-
ation is irreversible. There has been a departure from the orderly state of
balance between force and resistance, and at that point a loss in availability
of some energy resulted.
Carnot's cycle, it will be recalled, consists of four operations, viz
i. Isothermal expansion of the working substance.
2. Adiabatic expansion of the working substance.
3. Isothermal compression of the working substance.
4. Adiabatic compression of the working substance.
The cycle is pictured on PV coordinates in Fig. 1. Let us examine the sev-
eral operations and see if we can satisfy ourselves that they are all re-
versible.
During the operation AB, heat is being supplied to the gas. Now when
a gas receives heat energy, that energy must be disposed of in one of two
ways. viz. by storage in the mass of gas, in which case its intrinsic energy is
increased, which (in the case of perfect gases) is indicated by a rise in
temperature; or, the gas may do external work by pushing against a yield-
ing resistance, in which case the heat supplied, or some of it, is immediately
transferred into some dynamic or potential form of mechanical (or electri-
cal) energy, and does not remain stored in the gas.


259
Referring again to the operation AB, work is done to the extent rep-
resented by the area AjABBj, but none of the heat supplied is stored in the
gas, because its temperature at B is no higher than it was at A. From A to
B there has been maintained a steady balance of force between the pressure
of the gas and the yielding resistance of the piston. At B, the piston could
be made to come back on the gas, doing work upon the charge, which would
tend to raise the temperature of the charge. But if the gas be placed in
communication with the source, the excess heat generated would flow back
into the source, if the minutest excess of temperature dT be assumed. We
could therefore accomplish the operation AB and retrace it, coming back to
A, with the store of heat in the working substance just the same as when
we originally started from A; with the quantity of heat in the source un-
changed ; and without having to call for any outside help in getting the piston
back from B to A. The operation AB is therefore reversible.
Undoubtedly, the question has already arisen in the minds of some
reader, why is this case of isothermal expansion not one in which the trans-
fer of heat into work is 100 per cent efficient? and therefore a contradiction
to the statement previously made, viz. that all of a given quantity of heat
can never be converted into work. It is true that during an isothermal ex-
pansion of a perfect gas, the heat supplied is continually passing into me-
chanical energy. But all the while, the volume of the working substance is
growing, and we can not keep up the process indefinitely. We can not build
a cylinder large enough to contain our charge, beyond a certain volume. We
are compeled to suspend this isothermal operation, and consider means of
getting our piston back to its starting point and the working substance back
to its initial state. One possible means is to reverse the operation, but there
would be no object in this, because it would take all the work developed by
the expansion to effect the compression, and nothing would be accom-
plished in the way of effectively changing heat into work.
In Carnot's cycle, after isothermal expansion, the gas charge is locked
up in the cylinder, away from communication with the heat source, and
allowed to expand further against the yielding resistance of the piston.


Whatever work is done, is done at the expense of intrinsic or stored energy
in the gas; that is, the expansion is adiabatic. The temperature must neces-
sarily decline, because the store of intrinsic energy is indicated by the tem-
perature. Adiabatic expansion is a reversible operation, because it is theo-
retically possible to call back the mechanical work done on the piston and
make it compress the gas, bringing it back to state B, Fig. i, which was its
initial state.
The volume of the gas (at C) is now even greater than it was at B,
where the isothermal operation ceased. It is therefore necessary to take
steps to reconcentrate the charge—to get it back to its original state. To
do this work must be done upon the gas compressing it. Nothing would be
gained to compress adiabatically, retracing BC. The compressing must be
done in such a way that it will take less work to reduce the volume than was
produced in augmenting the volume in the operation BC. The compression
must be accompanied by cooling, and the best relation to be maintained be-
tween the rate of doing work by compression, and heat withdrawal, is to
have them equal; that is, compress isothermally along CD—the third oper-
ation of the Carnot cycle.
The gas charge has now been considerably reduced in size. We might
continue compressing isothermally until the volume is reduced to the orig-
inal volume at A. But it is apparent that such a continuation would bring
us to some point E, at a lesser pressure than the initial pressure. A fourth
operation, EA, would then be necessary to restore the working substance
completely to its initial state. It would be necessary to apply heat to bring
the state from E to A, and the heating would be accompanied by no work
done. The heat would have to come from our heat source at temperature
T,. The temperature at E is T,—something less than Tx. If the working
subtsance be placed in communication with the heat source, heat will pass
from the source to the gas, and the gas can be heated to state A. But can
the operation be reversed? Can the heat be made to flow back from the
working substance to the source, leaving the working substance in the in-
itial state E; with the original quantity of heat in the source; and with no
help from an outside source of heat or work? It is obvious that it can not.
Heat can not jump from a lower temperature medium into a higher temper-
atured one; any more than water can jump from a vessel at one level into a
vessel at a higher level.
The operation EA is therefore an irreversible operation, and it may
be well to pause here and attempt to see why only reversible operations can
be considered in connection with the perfect heat engine. Why should an
irreversible operation imply loss and imperfection? The passage of heat
from a body, or source, at higher temperature, to one at lower temperatures,
as represented by EA, is one of the most common and universal occur-
rences. It includes that heat operation known as "radiation" which de-
scribes the passage of heat from various hot surfaces in a power plant, to the
atmosphere; or the intentional transfer of heat from a radiator or stove to
the air oi a room. There is a drop of temperature from a higher level to a
lower level. The case is analogous to the descent of water poured from one


vessel to another; or a stream pouring over a falls. Before the descent, the
water possessed a certain head or energy potential for doing work. After
falling to the lower level, that head has disappeared; there is no longer any
available energy in the mass of water. Similarly, before the passage of heat
from the hotter body to the colder one, there was a certain potentiality for
doing work. In other words, some of the heat was available. After the
operation, we find the availability reduced, with no work to show for it. We
still have the entire amount of heat, just as we have the whole quantity of
water. But some of the heat which was originally available for work, has
now become unavailable. It is an irreversible process.
If, instead of permitting the water to fall unrestrained from one level
to another, we interpose a perfect water wheel, then we have substituted an
orderly and restrained descent. Every ounce of force is applied to a yielding
resistance, which results in the transfer of energy of head to energy of the
water wheel shaft. The water may be thought of as sinking to its lower
level without any splash or commotion.
The thermal operations are. parallel. When heat passes from the hot
body to the cold one, there is what we may call, having in mind the picture
above, a "thermal splash." There is not necessarily any loss in quantity
of heat, but there is a loss in availability of heat. Availability, it must be
understood, alludes to the possibility of doing work from heat. It is always
associated with the heat engine. A steam radiator may be perfectly satis-
factory in transferring heat from steam to air and in so doing may cause
complete loss of availability. But a radiator is not a heat engine; its pur-
pose is only to change heat from one body to another, not to change heat into
work.
An irreversible operation is one which involves sudden disordered, or
chaotic changes in states, and is always accompanied by loss in availability
of energy. A reversible operation is an orderly, balanced, and restrained
transfer of energy, and is accomplished without loss of availability.
It is now perhaps clear why the cycle of a perfect heat engine must be
a reversible cycle—a series of events which are reversible operations. Any
irreversible operation in the chain of events means a slip downward from
the high aim of the perfect heat engine.
Going back to the Carnot cycle, it is evident that since the path EA
is not that of a reversible operation, we must get the subsance from some
point on CE to A by one or more reversible paths. In the Carnot cycle, the
isothermal compression is stopped at a point D, such that the point A can
be reached by the adiabatic path DA. The adiabatic is a reversible oper-
ation,, and by its employment here, the cycle is closed, and the requirement
is fulfiled that the cycle shall be made up of reversible operations. The cycle
is therefore a reversible cycle. The work that is derived from heat when
heat passes from the source toward the refrigerator, could be used to pump
the unavailable heat deposited in the refrigerator, back into the source, leav-
ing everything as it was originally.
After Carnot had worked out his reversible cycle for a heat engine, he
showed that no engine could be more efficient than a reversible engine. He


did this by imagining, for the sake of argument, an engine A more efficient
than a reversible engine B. A and B are both connected to the same source
and the same refrigerator, and are coupled together. A drives B, which
being a reversible engine, will pump heat from the refrigerator into the
source. A draws heat from the source, converting some of it into work, and
depositing the remainder, the unavailable heat, in the refrigerator. The en-
tire system of source, refrigerator, and engines A and B, is locked up away
from all communication with other sources of energy, and the system is
started. Since A is running B, there will be exactly the same amount of
work developed in A as is expended in B. But because A is more efficient
ihan B, the latter will deposit more heat in the source than A uses, and will
draw more from the refrigerator than A deposits. The result is obvious.
Sooner or later the refrigerator will be pumped "dry." All the originally
low temperature heat will now be in the high temperature source. This we
may reasonably call an impossibility just as much as we would say it is im-
possible to have a water wheel developing power from a falls, to run a pump
which would lift the water from the tail race up to the head race faster than
the water wheel needed it. We are compelled to concede with Carnot that
ah engine operating upon a reversible cycle is the best possible engine.
The efficiency of a reversible engine therefore becomes the yard stick
whereby we measure the available energy in a given quantity of heat. The
efficiency of the Carnot cycle is found to be (Tt—T2)/Tl where T, is the
temperature of the heat source, and T„ that of the refrigerator. Of a given
quantity of Heat, the portion (T1 — Tj/TJ H is available, and the por-
tion TzH/Tj is unavailable. We have therefore a quanitative expression to
accompany the Second Law of Thermodynamics, just as we have Joule's
equivalent as a quantitative relation accompanying the First Law.
A heat engine is a mechanism interposed between a heat source and a
refrigerator. All heat which escapes from the source, and finds its way to
the refrigerator, by passing the heat engine, represents a loss of available
energy. It may be thought of as a heat leak. All "radiation" losses, or those
resulting in passage of heat by direct contact of a cold body with a hot
one, are of this kind.
The heat engine must have at least one operation during which the
working substance is in communication with the heat source; and at least
one during which it is in contact with the refrigerator. Both these oper-
ations are isothermals in the Carnot cycle, and isothermals should be sought
for any cycle. That is to say, for best efficiency, all the heat taken in by the
working substance, should be received by the working substance, at the
temperature of the source; and all the heat rejected, at the temperature of
the refrigerator. The change of temperature of the working substance,
from the one extreme to the other, is accomplished without communication
with either source or refrigerator; contact with the heat utilizer only is main-
tained.
It is not be noted that it would be possible to have a working substance
experience the changes described for a Carnot cycle, and yet have an engine
that was not very efficient for the purpose intended. The heat reception


temperature T, of the working substance, might be far below the tempera-
ture Tj of the source itself, in which case there would be irreversible action
in getting the heat from the source to the working substance. The perfect
heat engine must take in all its heat at the temperature of the source, and
reject the unavailable heat at the temperature of the refrigerator.
In a steam power plant, the above condition, as alluding to the reception
of heat by the working substance, is far from being fulfilled. The heat
developed by combustion furnishes a source in the hot gases at about 2000
degrees F. The temperature of the working substance—the water in the
boiler—may not be more than 4000 F. The passage of heat from a 2000 de-
gree source into a 400 degree working substance, is an irreversible, and there-
fore a lossful operation. A boiler could conceivably be 100 per cent efficient,
as we define efficiency when alluding to boiler operation. All the heat of the
coal would appear in the steam. Yet viewed as an element of a heat engine,
such a boiler might be far from efficient, on account of the irreversible
transfer of heat from gases to water. It would conserve the heat quantity
perfectly, but would permit wastage of availability.
Loss of availability is always traceable to one of two causes—direct
contact (or radiation) transfer of heat from a body of one temperature to
one at a lower temperature; or throttling. The first has just been discussed;
the second can not be more than merely touched upon here. Throttling
alludes to the handling of the working substance itself. Just as the drop in
temperature from a high level to a low level without the intervention of a
heat engine is an irreversible operation; so the passage of the state of a sub-
stance from a high pressure to a lower pressure, without the intervention
of a mechanism which will keep the motive forces balanced all the time
against yielding resistance, is an irreversible process.


C. V. KENT
The special suitability of each piece of manufactured steel for its par-
ticular task is dependent upon its history to a remarkable degree. Lack of
a proper "bringing up" will spoil any piece, however perfect its composition
and homogeneity. This history is primarily one of heat treatment and in-
volves practically only two variables: (I) the temperatures to which it has
been successively brought, and (2) the rapidity with which these shifts have
been accomplished. Carbon, nickel and the rare metal alloy steels have
their special charcteristics, but in each, physical properties, such as hardness,
toughness, malleability, rigidity and the like, may be varied within extraor-
dnary wide limits, by changes in the two factors given above. It is there-
fore a matter of dollars and cents to the steel manufacturer to heat treat
his product as exactly as possible. What has been said of steel, can be said
in a lesser degree of other alloys, of refractories, pottery and the like. The
special instruments by which the manufacturer measures and controls the
high temperatures involved in heat treatment are called "pyrometers."
During the past year (1918) I was in the service of the inspection di-
vision of the Ordnance Department as a pyrometric supervisor. In the
course of my work, I visited between one hundred and one hundred and
sixty munition factories throughout the country, inspecting installations,
checking and testing the apparatus and advising whatever changes might be
made to facilitate production. I was thus fortunately able to obtain a unique
and comprehensive view of the pyrometric situation in this country.
Fifty years ago, the accepted pyrometer was the human eye. The iron
worker could guess the temperature of his steel to fifty degrees most of the
time. Long experience and familiarity with his furnace and his steel gave
him a standard. In the dim light of the furnace room the eye is remarkably
sensitive. Fifty degrees (it could be less than twenty-five under favorable
conditions) was ample accuracy for the simple treatment then required.
Eye estimation, except in rare instances is no longer a feasible method
of procedure. In the large factories of today labor will not take an appren-
ticeship of a dozen years to train the vision. No variable human standard
will serve to guide the heat treatment of modern standardized products.
Twenty-five, fifteen or even five degrees (Fahrenheit) may be the limit of
temperature variation allowable in special operations.
The modern electrical pyrometer has been developed to meet this
demand for exactitude. It must be confessed that the terribly difficult con-
ditions under which it must operate, are almost too much for it. The red
hot "fire end" in the furnace must withstand an occasional banging by the
iron bars of the furnace workman. In this heat and exposed to active gases it
must maintain its electrical properties unchanged for day and weeks. The


temperature registering instrument is as finely constructed as a watch. Yet is
must be accurate in action to a few ten thousandths of a volt, when exposed
to the continual jarring and rumbling of heavy machinery and the ceaseless
fall of smoke and dust and iron-scale. The frequent testing and checking,
which is a sine qua non of pyrometry, is in itself an admission that it is not
yet perfect. The pyrometer manufacturer himself will tell you in an in-
cautious moment that it is a "necessary evil."
To the layman, the furnaces used in the heat treatment of steel are of
two classes: in the quenching furnaces the .metal is heated to perhaps 1500
degrees F. It is then cooled or quenched in oil or water baths. Being now
too hard, the steel is tempered by reheating in the "drawing furnaces" to say
about 1250 degrees F. (faint red heat) and slowly cooled. Practically all
furnaces are heated by oil burners.
In this country the industrial pyrometer is of the thermo-couple type.
A thermo-couple, in its simplest form, consists of two wires of different
metals, whose ends are twisted and welded together to form a complete
electrical circuit. (Fig. 1.) If either junction of the dissimilar wires are
heated, an electro-motive force is generated and an electric current flows.
Its direction depends on which junction is heated, and on the nature of the
metals of which the wires are made. The pure metals and alloys used as
elements of the industrial thermo-couple, give e.m.f.s which are practically
proportional to the difference of temperature between the hot and cold junc-
tions. Thus if one junction is maintained at a constant temperature (say 75
degrees F.) and the other, the "fire end," introduced into a furnace, its tem-
perature can be found by any instrument capable of measuring the e.m.f. or
current produced in the circuit. . .
If the circuit of the thermo-couple is cut at any point, even between the
elements of the cold junction, and the cut ends joined by a third wire or
wires of any metals, as long as the cut ends have the same temperature, the
e.m.f. generated by the thermo-couple proper is unchanged. Therefore we
may join the cut ends by copper lead wires to a distant millivoltmeter, which
when calibrated in terms of degrees, will give us the temperature of the "fire
end" (Fig. 2.) This is the usual "millivoltmeter type" of pyrometer, which is
found in perhaps three-fourths of the installations in this country. The
essential advantage of this type of pyrometer is its simplicity and the fact
that it is self registering. The furnace man does not have to do anything to
make it read. All he needs to know is that the pointer must be brought to a
particular place on the scale by his firing.
The system has one serious disadvantage. The millivoltmeter reading
is of course proportional to the current flowing in the circuit. In fact, the
millivoltmeter may be considered as a milliammeter with perfect scientific
propriety. The current flowing is given by the equation, I=E,R, in which
I is the current, E the e.m.f. due to the thermo-junctions, and R the resistance
of the circuit, including thermo-rouple, leads and indicating instrument. The
e.m.f. is proportional to the temperature difference to be read. Therefore,
only in the case that the circuit resistance is constant, will the temperature

readings be correct. This constancy of resistance is impossible however,
owing to the changes produced by varying temperatures of the fire end, lead
wires and millivoltmeter. Assuming the resistance of the circuit to be mainly
of copper, a not impossible daily or seasonable variation of temperature of
40 degrees or 50 degrees will produce a variation or error in the apparent
temperature indications of the millivoltmeter, of 5 per cent.

The older types of millivoltmeters are of low resistance, the whole
circuit consisting in some cases of but a few ohms. The current and force
actuating the pointer are accordingly large, and the instruments can be made
extremely rugged. I have seen these instruments in such a state of neglect
that it was evident that they had not been touched since the day of their
installation years before; yet they were practically perfect in action. In
these low resistance circuits, resistance variations bulk very large. This type
can hardly be relied upon to better than 50 degrees F except under unusual
conditions.
The modern millivoltmeter has many times the sensibility of its fore-
runner. In fact it should, and does detect variations of current of less than
one millionth of an ampere. Such an instrument has the sensitivity of a
galvanometer, and yet is supposed to operate in a turmoil of jars, vibrations,
smoke, dirt and noise.
With such small currents needed, the line resistance can be made very
large, from 500 to more than 1000 ohms. In practice, most of this resistance
is usually concentrated in a coil of some high resistance alloy with a negli-
gible temperature coefficient of resistance. .The influence of temperature
variations on the circuit is thus made very small, although it never can be
wholly eliminated.


In view therefore of the effects of the ineradicable potential drop in the
thermo-couple and leads, one pyrometric firm has adopted the potentiometer
as its measuring instrument. The essentials of this system are shown in the
accompanying diagram (Fig. 3.) A known current is produced in an auxil-
iary circuit in a known resistance AB. A galvanometer G, is connected in
one of the leads of the thermo-couple. If the ends of the thermo-couple
are touched to the resistance AB at such a distance apart that the potential
drop in ab due to the auxiliary current is exactly equal to the E.M.F. of the
couple, and opposes it, no current will flow through the thermo-couple and
leads, and the galvanometer will not deflect. The e.m.f. of the thermo-
couple, and consequently the temperature difference to be measured, are pro-
portional to the included length ab, of the resistance wire. The wire, AB,
is usually calibrated directly in degrees Fahrenheit. A standard cell can be
substituted for the thermo-couple in order to adjust the current from the
auxiliary cell to its proper value.
Since no current flows through the thermo-couple circuit at the time of
a temperature observation, the resistance and changes of resistance of this
portion of the circuit have no effect upon the readings. The potentiometer
has an additional advantage over the millivoltmeter in that no gradual deter-
ioration of calibration is possible. It either functions correctly or not at
all. It is a surprising fact that the potentiometer pyrometer is actually a
more rugged instrument than the millivoltmeter,—although the contrary is
taken for granted. The potentiometer has one practical disadvantage in con-
nection with its use by unskilled workmen,—the indicator form requires
manual adjustment for each reading.
It is necessary in connection with the heat treatment of many plants to
have a continuous record of the furnace temperatures. In the millivoltmeter
recorder which has been developed for this purpose, the instrument pointer
is pressed periodically by clock work against a revolving disc or moving strip
of paper. Its position is marked on the paper by carbon paper, an inked
thread or even the electric spark. Thus a time-temperature graph is traced.
The temperature scales used by these instruments are usually too much com-
pressed. Also the feeble power developed by the clock work is often insuffi-
cient for the work it must do, and they are consequently liable to get out of
order.
In the potentiometer recorder, ample power is afforded the simple
mechanism by a constant speed electric motor connected to the lighting mains.
The galvanometer does no work. A boom or short pointer on the swinging
coil serves to set in motion the entirely mechanical operation of sliding the
lead wire contact on the resistance AB (see Fig. 3) to the balance point.
An accompanying motion of a pen or printing wheel is simultaneously
effected over the record sheet. It is a remarkable instrument in construction
and accuracy and possesses a very wide temperature scale.
Records of several thermo-couples are usually printed simultaneously
upon the same paper. To accomplish this, a switch, actuated by the driving


mechanism, shifts the connections from one to the other. Recorder and
indicator can be applied to the same thermo-couples. In many of the larger
plants the following complete system has been adopted. (i) Red, white and
green signal lights over the furnaces, which are operated by the most im-
portant thermo-couple in each, automatically announce to the furnace oper-
ator whether he is maintaining the correct heat. (2) An indicator is present
in the furnace room which can be connected at will to any of the thermo-
couples. There are usually several fire ends in each furnace. I have seen
as many as twenty surrounding a large gun during its heat treatment. (3) A
recorder in the heat treatment office, which gives continuous records of the
more important fire ends.
The wires which form the fire ends are generally alloys. One of the
commonest of these is made of nickel and chronium. It has a high e.m.f.
against other metals of say 20 millivolts per 1000 degrees F. and is unusually
resistant to oxidation, being in fact practically the same alloy which is used
as the heating wire in electric toasters, etc. The other element of the couple
in which this is used is usually an alloy of aluminum and nickel. Many
thermo-couple combinations are possible. They should all possess high e.
m. f.s, and great constancy and strength. Another common couple is con-
stantan against iron. Its e.m.f. is about 30 millivolts per 1000 degrees, and it
is comparatively inexpensive, but the iron is of course easily oxidized. The
"noble metal" couple, platinum vs. platinum-rhodium is used as a standard.
When protected by an impervious porcelain tube, it is perfectly constant and
can be used up to nearly 3000 degrees F.
The fire end should always be protected from the direct heat and active
gases of the furnace by a stout metal tube. Iron tubes are most commonly
used as they are not expensive. However, they oxidize quickly and are
pervious to gases at red heat. The nickel-chronium alloy is preferable as
tube material but costs money. These protecting tubes are commonly about
three feet long and one inch in diameter, 1-8 inch wire, or thereabout, is
used for the thermo-couples. The insulation is generally short lengths of
porcelain tubes. Asbestos should not be used for this purpose at high tem-
peratures as it seems to interact chemically with the thermo-couple wire.
Practically all of the "base metal" couples can be used with safety and
confidence up to 1600 degrees F. or even 1800 degrees F. I would trust
none of them, however, above 1600 degrees without daily testing. Above
this point there seems to be a greatly increased tendency for the e.m.f. to be
low. This deterioration increases with great rapidity when once started.
For instance a western munition plant was .heating hand grenades to 1700
degrees, this temperature being maintained supposedly with the aid of new
calibrated thermo-couples which had been put in the furnaces three days
before our visit of inspection. The millivoltmeters were correct and indi-
cated the proper temperatures, but the fire ends were found to have deterior-
ated so badly in three days that their indications were low by more than
300 degrees. The white-hot grenades were sticking together as they came


out of the furnaces. The furnace men knew the heat did not look right in
spite of the pyrometers, but as there were no spare couples or testing outfit of
any kind, they had no way to justify their suspicions. All of which points a
moral—always have some sort of testing outfit.
The cold junction is the bete-noire of practical pyrometry. In the older
installations, the lead wires were connected directly to the external head of
the fire end, which located the cold junction at this point. These junctions
are often too hot to' touch with the hand. Fluctuations of 50 degrees or even
100 degrees are common. The cold junction is simply disregarded as a factor
in the measurement. A manufacturer near Philadelphia who had turned
from the production of linoleum to 75 mm. shells, blandly informed the in-
spector that his pyrometers "had no cold junctions." Lucky man.
The most common disposal of the cold junction is to bury it in a sealed
protecting tube in the ground at a depth of ten or fifteen feet. This will
ordinarily protect it from all but slow seasonal variations of temperature,
and the millivoltmeter zero can be set for its average temperature with an
error of not more than 20 degrees. One pyrometer firm makes it a practice
to bury the cold junction not more than three feet, and close beside the
furnace at that. I have seen one of their installations in Cleveland where
the cold junction temperatures are known to vary by 150 degrees during the
year. The presence of moisture in the protecting tube will generally produce
disturbing electrolytic currents in the thermo-couple circuit. While burial
gives fair results when properly done it is a makeshift at best. The uncer-
tainty as to the cold junction temperature in this procedure is one of the
most common sources of error.
One pyrometer manufacturer has placed a network of resistance con-
taining a copper coil at the junction, which is situated at the exterior end of
the fire end. When this changes in temperature, the consequent variation of
resistance of the copper coil allows just enough current from an auxiliary
dry cell to flow through the millivoltmeter to compensate for this fluctuation.
This compensation system was surprisingly satisfactory wherever investi-
gated.
In the potentiometer system, the lead wires are made of the same high
resistance metals as the thermo-couple proper, since the reading of the indi-
cator is independent of the resistance of the leads. The cold junction is
therefore situated at the instrument. Variations in its temperature are com-
pensated manually or by the change in resistance of a nickel coil in the auxil-
iary circuit.
Of course the makers of pyrometers are well aware of the defects of
their systems and instruments,—and also of those of their competitors. They
are effecting marked improvements from year to year. Pyrometers are natur-
ally expensive. The transitory thermo-couple costs from $5 to $15. an indi-
cator, $75 to $150. and a recorder, $200 to $500. The cost of installation
is also large. Many manufacturers, penny wise, pare down the installations
they order beyond the irreducible minimum of satisfactory operation. The


omission of a testing set is one of the most common instances. Others, from
prejudice or ignorance, will insist on the most costly equipment, absolutely
unsuited to their needs. The pyrometer manufacturers will usually put in
excellent installations, if given free hand. They follow up their systems
when possible, and seem glad to be called upon in times of pyrometric trouble.
It is to their interest to do so. The pyrometer is young, and it is as impor-
tant just now for them to educate their clientele, as it is to sell them.
I do not believe they have given one point in their installations all the
importance that it deserves. This is the question of the proper location of
the fire ends. A pyrometer, however good, gives merely the temperature of
Its fire end and this temperature may be said to be practically never that of
the material being heat treated. The fire end should be placed as near the
work as possible, at a point where its temperature will approach closely that
of the material being heat treated. Conditions are so widely different that its
proper placing is an individual question in each furnace, whch can best be
solved by a careful study of actual operating conditions.
Where the furnace has good doors and is well insulated thermally and
has plenty of well situated burners, the problem is relatively simple. The
temperature within is practically uniform and there is little difference in
choice of location.
However, consider the hastily erected furnaces so often found, especi-
ally in munition factories. The thin walls are full of cracks and holes and
the doors may be loose sheet iron shields, or chain curtains or absent alto-
gether. The rush of production has pushed both the passing of the material
treated through the furnace, and consequently the firing, to the limit. The
necessarily rapid rate of heating the steel being treated involves enormous
tempearture gradients. In such a furnace I have seen continual fluctuations
of 50 degrees at a given place, and differences of 100 degrees between points
six inches apart on the same level. The temperature of the steel itself will
vary from point to point on a given piece. What is meant by the temperature
of the steel in such a heat treatment, and where can a fire end be placed to
measure it?
The brass mills are among the worst offenders in respect to the placing
of fire ends. The annealing furnaces are charged from time to time with
anything, from heavy, board-like brass slabs in a layer on the floor, to rolls
of thin sheet metal piled up to the furnace arch. A "safety first-' policy will
therefore usually place the fire ends close against the roof where they roost
safe from harm and certainly innocent of usefulness.
In a brass plant in one of the Great Lakes cities they were actually
pulled up into the brick work, where they were covered with a thick deposit
of flocculent oxide,—an excellent heat insulator, while a cloud of green flame
rolled across the arch just beneath. What possible relation could the tem-
peratures of the hidden fire ends bear to that of the six inch layer of brass
slabe on the furnace floor, two feet below? As a matter of professional
interest, the temperatures of the brass slabs themselves were investigated.


The top and bottom of the close packed pile differed by more than no de-
grees at the moment when they were considered to be brought to heat and
ready for withdrawal.
It was evident that the pyrometers were entirely disregarded (they had
to be) the visual judgment of the furnace man being the sole heat control.
An accuracy of better than 100 degrees was impossible under the circum-
stances. If the revelations of the microphotographs and the conclusions as
to the effect of heat treatment which can be found in any metallurgical text-
book can be believed, the product of such casual annealing should have been
of indifferent quality. Probably it was. But as the furnace foreman re-
marked, "what's the use of fussing with pyrometers? The company's mak-
ing too much money now."
In general, the pyrometric installations investigated might be divided into
three classes from the point of view of accuracy in temperature measure-
ments. In the "good" plants, this was twenty-five degrees or less, this total
error being divided about as follows—10 degrees in the line and cold junc-
tion (for millivoltmeter installations); 5 degrees in instrument; and 10
degrees in the difference between the temperature of the fire end and the
material heat treated. The first source of error is absent in the potentio-
meter system and the accuracy is accordingly somewhat better. The "good"
plants comprise more than half of those examined. In the majority of the
remainder in which the temperature error is within 50 per cent, pyrometric
conditions might be called "fair." The final class, the sad examples, needs
no description beyond the examples already given.
At the beginning of the government inspection work, an optical pyro-
meter was purchased as an experiment. This temperature measuring instru-
ment is totally different from those so far described. It consists essentially
of a simple telescope, shown diagrammatically in Figure 4, through which
one looks directly at the incandescent material whose temperature is to be
found. The image of the work formed by the objective, is situated at the
filament of a small incandescent lamp placed within the telescope and one
sees in the field of view the filament superimposed on the image of the
material observed. A red absorbing glass in the eyepiece brings them both
to the same color. To make a temperature reading, the current through
the filament from a dry cell or two is adjusted by means of a rheostat until
the filament is of the same brightness as the heated object. The filament
then becomes indistinguishable from the background object and since the
filament and iron are both approximately "black bodies," they are now at
the same temperature. An ammeter in the lamp circuit gives the current
used, and the temperature is read off from a current-temperature calibration
sheet.
As before mentioned, the use of this instrument as a standard in testing
under practical conditions was doubted. Fortunately, I was compelled very
early to depend upon it almost entirely, in the course of an extended investi-
gation in one of the largest cannon plants in the country. The use of the
optical pyrometer eliminated the troublesome preparation and insertion of


the testing fire end in the furnace, and there was no wait for the re-estab-
lishment of temperature equilibrium before readings could be made. Only
a few moments were required for an observation,—no small matter where
hundreds of thermo-couples were in operation, and many tests must be made
in an atmosphere of stifling gases and scorching heat. Readings by any
operator were found to agree with those of any other to within 10 degrees,
and the instrument seemed absolutely permanent, barring injuries to the
ammeter.
With it, we measured the temperatures of the huge gun forgings as
they were squashed into shape by the hydraulic hammer and of the forty
foot guns from end to end, as they hung in the furnaces. We checked the
fire ends themselves, and measured the rate of heating of the actual
material being heat treated (for this is not always the same as the rate
of rise of the fire end.) We made temperature maps of whole furnaces
comparing temperatures of walls, material and fire ends. It can be seen
that much of this exploring work is utterly impossible to the thermo-couple.
Within its limits, the optical pyrometer is an exceedingly valuable in-
strument. It will not operate, of course, below visible heat (1200 degrees
or 1250 degrees) but on the other hand, it has the temperature field to itself
above 1800 degrees or 2000 degrees. It is essentially a portable instrument,
and as such, the ammeter is liable to injury in the hands of the ordinary
workman. It is not self-operating. It cannot be successfully used in a
smoky furnace. Its usual calibration is made for approximately "black
bodies" such as iron. This however, can be changed to conform to the differ-
ent emission law of other material. Bausch and Lomb employ it in the
control of the temperature of melted optical glass in the glass pot furnaces
of their plant at Rochester.
In spite of the suspicion of scientific accuracy, and methods, which one
sometimes meets in older firms, and in spite of too many poor equipments,
the pyrometer today, is in the last phase of being accepted as an absolutely
necessary adjunct of good heat treatment, whether of brass, glass, brick or
iron. The scientific metallurgist who must know his heat treatments with
exactitude, insists on the best pyrometric practice. There is no doubt of
the enthusiastic agreement of the pyrometer manufacturer. The best mod-
ern metal plants recognize the advantage to them in dollars and cents of
the use of the modern pyrometer. It is evident even to the layman who
has had a glimpse of this great industry that heat treatment by guess cannot
meet requirements. The munition plant which was "in trouble," usually
possessed poor furnaces or a poor pyrometric equipment, or both.
It is curious how this reluctance to measure things exactly and to ob-
tain quantitative data, lingers among the older men. Their favorite motto
is, "The eye is better than any pyrometer ever made." True, the eye
is an exceedingly sensitive instrument in comparing temperature, for it can
detect differences of temperature of less than 10 degrees under almost any
conditions. Unfortunately it has no standard in the furnace room by which
it can compare, except memory. Nevertheless, it can estimate actual tem-
peratures to within 50 degrees, if no extraneous glare is present and con-


ditions are constant and an experienced operator can do much better than
this—some of the time.'
The memory standard, however, is a variable, from man to man, and
time to time. That of the day operator is different from that of the man
in the night shift. The defection of the day foreman who judged by eye in
a munition plant near Pittsburgh, shut down the heat treating furnaces dur-
ing daylight. The standard changes from Saturday evening to Monday
morning. It shrinks 50 degrees to 100 degrees when a patch of sunlight or
the furnace flames are in the field of view. Several exactly similar furnaces
in a Detroit factory were heating ten inch shells in the same process. Yet
the shells from a furnace in the sunlight were 120 degrees hotter than those
from another in the darker end of the room. (The superintendent assured
me that their plant depended on the pyrometers, and that they were tested
every day.)
The older industries and plants of the Eastern Seaboard and New Eng-
land are the most backward in pyrometric equipment and practice. Natur-
ally enough, the best examples of pyrometry are found in our own door-
yard, in the automobile industries. They want the best physical properties
of the metals they use, with the minimum weight. Exact heat treatment is
thus a necessity.
The industrial pyrometer is a scientific instrument which came from
research laboratories into the terribly severe conditions of the furnace room.
The education of the industries as to its capabilities and limitations is a
crying need. It is just a thermometer to the workman. He expects it to
act just like the one he hangs on his front porch. He should be told and
he should be shown that the indicator or recorder is as delicate as a watch;
that the fire end is not made to withstand the red heat of the furnace for-
ever; that the whole installation shows a devilish perversity in going wrong.
He must understand that it is absolutely necessary to test and check it every
few days. It must be coddled from birth. Give him a chance to become
acquainted with it and he will learn to trust it.
Such education can best come, and is coming, from the pyrometer manu-
facturers themselves. They are keenly alive to this necessity, since it is to
their interest to see that plants which have purchased their equipment know
how to run it. Although the field is narrow, some of this education can
properly come from the universities. The technical graduate who goes into
the industries cannot avoid the pyrometer. He should be already familiar
with at least the principles, electrical and otherwise, of temperature meas-
urement.
It is a far cry from the eye of Tubal Cain, anxiously glued to his fur-
nace of mud and stone, to the 16-point recorder of today. It has been some-
thing of a pleasure and an education to get a glimpse of the steps between,
in this huge, vivid industry, upon which so much of the life of today de-
pends.


E. H. SNIFFIN, MANAGER OF THE POWER DEPT.,
WESTINGHOUSE ELEC. &amp; MFG. CO.
It is useful sometimes to stand off
a little way and take a view of your
work, the field of your activity and its
relations to the general scheme of
things. To go up on a mountain, so
to speak, and look down upon the
world, to ponder what its inhabitants
are all doing and why, and where you
fit into the plan. One may well muse
over the purpose of it all. It seems
like a very fair earth, where men ought
to be very decent and very comfort-
able. Then why have they made such
a sorry mess of it? Perhaps it is in
the divine scheme that they should
make a mess of it. We know there
has always been a terrible struggle,
perhaps always will be, for the things
that bring us food, covering, shelter
and delight for the senses, and the
landscape will soften very gradually
as men slowly learn that it is not a
struggle of units, but a struggle of
humanity in the mass; that we can-
not live alone, but that we depend
upon each other and that the one sub-
stantial happiness that comes to any
man is to be measured by the extent
of his service to others.
And so I cannot talk about the
engineer until I find his place in this
scheme of things; and when I see
what he has done for the world, when
I find that within the last century he
has practically revolutionized the liv-
ing conditions of civilized people and
made the world more habitable than
was even dreamed of by the greatest
imaginations of former ages. I am
bound to conclude that the engineer,
perhaps above all others, has contri-
buted most to the material welfare of
humanity. What is known as the
world's industrial revolution began
about a hundred years ago when by
the application of steam as motive
power and the inventions of machines
for various purposes which it stimu-
lated, and the onward march of scien-
tific discovery, there followed the age
which has culminated in our own day
in a world transformation. And what
a romance it has been, this work of
the engineer. Not alone for money
gain has he labored, albeit he has
made it for others, but to him has
come a wealth greater—
"Than all Bocara's vaunted gold,
Than all the gems of Samarcand."
the consciousness of a great world
service. He has hitched his wagon to
a star. Do you remember that beau-
tiful poem of Kipling's which be-
gins—
"When earth's last picture is painted.
And the tubes are twisted and dried."
and then he describes that heavenly
existence where:
"No one shall work for money,
And no one shall work for fame.
But each, for the joy of the working,
And each in his separate star,
Shall draw the thing as he sees it,
For the God of Things as they
are."
The engineer does not have to die
to do that. He does it while he is
here. He has been the interpreter of
physical facts and natural laws and
marshalled them into useful paths of


275
world employment. He has "drawn
the thing as he sees it, for the God of
things as they are." I sometimes
imagine when I look at a great piece
of engineering work,—an ocean steam-
er, a long span of bridge, a big
dam, an immense power-house,—that
if the creator of it should have passed
into the shadows, his soul must still
hover near this monument of its earth-
ly expression, for that would be Heav-
en indeed.
It is this feeling that I have for the
engineer, the love and esteem I hold
for him, that prompts me to ask this
question,—why is not the engineer a
more conspicuous member of the com-
munity? The query is by no means
original with me. It is beginning to
concern the engineer himself. It has
been accentuated perhaps by his large
contributions to our victory in the
great war, not only through his engi-
neering achievements, but his power
of organization and administration,
the employment of a mind trained to'
deal with facts and form accurate
conclusions. It has been the frequent
topic before many of our engineering
societies.
The problem, it seems to me, lies
more particularly with the engineer as
an individual and that is the chief
thought in my mind. Why is he not
a more conspicuous citizen? Why do
we not have more of the benefit of
his trained mind in our public affairs?
Is he to be so highly specialized in his
profession as not to be a man among
men, he of the trained mind, and not
help to solve the problems common to
us all? Shall we leave it to the law-
yers to hold public offices? If so. I
am wondering what special qualifica-
tions the lawyer has for the public
service that the engineer does not pos-
sess, or at least might not readily ac-
quire. I can very easily imagine that
the engineer in his lifetime search for
facts, for the truth of things, dealing
as he must with economic problems
which suffer no gloss or guile, might
indeed be a very valuable public serv-
ant. I am told that the membership
of the Sixty-fifth Congress contains
not a single engineer in either the
Upper or Lower House. It must be a
matter of chagrin to us, when we
come to think of it, that in our coun-
try with its wonderful scientific and
mechanical achievements which hav
been the biggest thing in our develop-
ment there stand out very few among
our engineers or scientists whos
voice is heard in our national council
What a pity; and how much better it
would be for the country if the re-
verse were true.
I think the trouble starts at the
school. I am glad to say that that
feature is improving, but I think rath-
er slowly. As a rule technical school
graduates have shown too much the
effect of a specialied training at the
expense of an education. The engi-
neer seems to be stamped upon them
at the expense of the man. Their
general interest in things has not been
stimulated. They have not the cath-
olicity of taste or ready response to
environment that marks the well
rounded man. Then followed their
years of work, their concentration up-
on the thing they loved, with little
heed for the verities or amenities of
our common social existei ;e. I do
not complain of the engineer's useful-
ness. There is nothing but praise to
be said for the value of his work. But
he lives in a world of men who have
their own way of appraising his value
and I am contending that he has thi
training that will enable him to serve
them in a greater degree still, if he

will come out of his hermitage and
mingle with the open world. We must
remember that in our own country
there is very little spontaneity of
recognition of the men of science. In
the older countries they are selected
for distinguished honors. . Great Brit-
ian knights her Thompsons, her Par-
sons, her Whitworths, her Bessemers,
a long list of them who take place with
her statesmen, her scholars, her pub-
licists. Pqincare, the President of
France, is said to be one of the world's
greatest mathematicians. Clemen-
ceau was once a physician and I am
told that there are about seventy phy-
sicians in the present Chamber of
Deputies. And Paderewski is now
running Poland. If this artist, who
1 suppose is temperamental, can leave
his keyboard and work with all his
brain and brawn and heart and soul
for the nationality of his country,
what do you suppose the engineer
might do? Artist that he is, he fits
very well into my theme. Our first
President was an engineer. Franklin
was a scientist. But both of these
great men had other compelling inter-
ests that made their names immortal.
The habit went out of fashion at an
early date.
The fact is that our own country
is not inclined to exalt a man into
realms of distinction beyond his defi-
nite accomplishment, although it does
quickly recognize him for what he
does, and it is as true of human nature
here as elsewhere, that your light
gives better illumination when ex-
posed than when hid under a bushel.
Our friend, the engineer is too mod-
est. Any man would be who spends
his life struggling with natural laws;
he finds out how small he is. And I
suppose it to be natural that he should
view with but casual interest the many
phases of our social life, and especi-
ally the banalities, as he sees it, of
politics. So he keeps aloof from all
these trifling, artificial, unsubstantial
affairs, and remains the engineer. And
the public lets him have his way. Now
this is undoubtedly very wrong. There
is nothing more true than the fact that
people live upon the earth in a social
state of interdependence, the most
successful of them under representa-
tive forms of government. Through
these representatives national, state
and municipal laws and local ordi-
nances are enacted, supposed to give
the maximum benefit to the greatest
number. These important functions
are exercised often from political mo-
tives purely. Very often the motive
is honest and sincere, but the result is
unwise, unsound and sometimes vici-
ous in its consequences. Do you sup-
pose, for instance, that the hydro-
electric situation in our country today
would have existed had there been
among our lawmakers enough men
with the engineering and economic
knowledge to know what they were
doing? No, it required a world war,
with its stress upon every ounce of
our national energy to make us fully
realize that we have about twice as
much undeveloped water power in
this country as there is steam power
in use, including locomotives, scarcely
any of which will invite a dollar of
capital under our present ill-consid-
ered laws. So the President is now
trying to speed up the remedial legis-
lation that has been under consider-
ation for many years.
But, as I said before, the engineer
will not be picked from his profession
to serve in public life. He must him-
self show social and public activity.
He must make men aware of him. I
wonder if I might say he must adver-


277
tise himself—that word "advertise"
has a new significance to me since I
have seen how necessary and success-
ful it was in such a good and worthy
cause as our Liberty Bond campaigns.
When Emerson said that if you could
do something better than any one else
could do it, the world would make a
path to your door, even though you
lived in the heart of a wood, he had in
mind only one phase of human nature.
It is equally a fact that the greatest
truth that was ever established will be
accepted more readily if it hits you in
the face at every turn. Not as an en-
gineer shall he advertise, but as a man
of superior mind, who in the sweep
of his knowledge and the sincerity of
his purpose shall become a strong and
helpful influence in our public affairs.
We are living in a critical period of
the world's history. We have jus
expended nearly ten million lives and
two hundred billions of wealth, and
were ready to give all our lives and all
our wealth to preserve our heritage
of freedom and righteousness.
Thrones have been demolished and
governments upset and the world is
trying to find its way, let us hope, to a
new and better order of existence.
Meanwhile there are tens of millions
of people living under conditions of
social chaos, and it would be a bold
man who could say how far it will
go, or indeed, whether our own fair
land shall be immune from the blight
of these poisonous theories that have
already spread from the Volga to the
Rhine. Let us hope not. But let us
make sure that it shall be every man's
duty to come out of his isolation into
his fullest obligations of citizenship;
that men of trained mind and trained
character shall seek their places in the
councils of our country; and that the
engineer above all others shall no
longer exclude himself from the full-
est measure of public service.


ORGANIZATION
LOUIS E. AYRES, '08E
That there has occurred, during re-
cent months, a very decided awaken-
ing in the engineering profession can
scarcely be doubted. The minds of
engineers everywhere are filled with
plans for the reorganization of old
societies or the formation of new ones.
In many communities both large and
small, enthusiastic and portentous
meetings have been held and local so-
cieties have avowed larger purposes
and taken on new life. The interest-
ing features about all this tendency
towards better professional cooper-
ation are first, its spontaneity and sec-
ondly, the fact that it has little to it
that is technical, but rather it is social
and economic in character. The engi-
neer as a machine has reached a point
well nigh perfection, but the engineer
as a human being and as an American
citizen is in great need of attention.
The movement is nothing more or less
than a widespread demand that a great
profession hold up its head and as an
organized social unit play its proper
part in the economic struggle now en-
gaging society.
It seems hardly necessary to re-
mind engineers of the importance of
giving serious thought to the signifi-
cance of these present day tendencies
because in addition to some of the
superficial causes and objects of the
organization movements which we all
perceive, there is an end to be sought,
not so obvious, but vital to every pro-
fessional man and to society.
From a national standpoint there
are at present two camps of activity,
two centers of disturbance in the en-
gineering world. First, the four old
national so-called founder societies,
controlled for years by New York oli-
garchies have sensed the wave of dis-
content sweeping over the profession
and have appointed development com-
mittees to make a "broad survey of
the functions and purposes" of these
societies "in order that intelligent and
effective readjustment may be accom-
plished" so that engineers "may take
their proper place in the larger sphere
of influence now opening to the pro-
fession." Secondly, a new National
Society, the American Association of
Engineers, lately formed in Chicago
"to promote the economic and social
welfare" of the engineer, has during
the last two years experienced a tre-
mendous growth throughout the mid-
dle and far west.
Three questions may well be asked:
([) wherein do these movements dif-
fer, (2) are they opposing or does
one but supplement the other, and
(3) to which should I give my allegi-
ance? No attempt is made herein
to answer these questions but the
writer desires merely to point out
briefly certain significant facts that
may or may not assist others in reach-
ing conclusions.
In the first place, without great
stretch of imagination the engineers
of this country may readily be group-
ed into three classes: (a) the upper
class or "bourgeoise" comprising the
consulting engineers and chief engi-
neers and all other persons who have


279
achieved considerable professional
■and financial success; (b) the lower
class or "proletariat" comprising all
those persons occupying subordinate
engineering positions as draftsmen,
rodmen and the like and (c) a great
middle class who do not clearly belong
to either the "bourgeoisie" or "prole-
tariat" but constitute the bulk of the
profession. The exact lines of demar-
cation between the classes are, it is
true, not sharp, but recent tendencies
are drawing the group lines more
clearly. In general may we not say,
however, that the governments in the
four founder societies comprise the
"bourgeoisie" while the membership
includes for the most part the middle
class; and the American Association
of Engineers has a government of the
middle class and a membership of the
"proletariat."
Let us not mince words, but call a
spade a spade. The most potent force
leading engineers to come together for
their "social and economic welfare" is
selfish in the narrow sense of that
word. The demand on the part of
draftsmen that they be adequately
compensated however is not one whit*
more selfish than the desire for great-
er public recognition by the leaders of
the profession. It is natural that men
should be concerned most with those
things most intimately related to their
own selfish interests. It is natural
that the draftsman should be primarily
interested in better pay or shorter
hours and the consulting engineers
and others who have reached the up-
per rungs of the ladder of success in
things that increase reputation and af-
ford opportunity for greater public
service.
The agitation for adequate com-
pensation, although desirable, is
fraught with some danger. It has be-
hind it the same impelling force that
has produced the labor union and
made the American Federation of
Labor such a power in American in-
dustry and politics. It is natural that
the draftsman should see, in an alli-
ance with the American Federation of
Labor an answer to his problem, and
in several instances already it has
proved a quick and effective answer.
But the engineering profession is un-
alterably opposed to affiliation with the
American Federation of Labor or the
utilization of any of its methods. Pro-
fessional men will never resort to such
means to attain their ends for by so
doing the profession would be reduced
to the level of modern industry and
as a profession would disappear. The
engineer would then become an indus-
trial worker.
A strong tendency toward such af-
filiation exists, however, among the
younger and less successful members
of the profession and as such must be
recognized and faced. If affiliation
with organized labor is not to become
general among the "proletariat" then
a strong organization of some other
sort must undertake to accomplish
what such affiliation would undoubt-
edly accomplish, namely, adequate
compensation for the average worker.
To fill this need, to do this job, is, I
take it, one of the aims of the Amer-
ican Association of Engineers.*
To undertake such a task is to as-
sume a great responsibility to the en-
gineering profession. Can the aims
*The writer does not mean to suggest that
this is the only function of the American
Association of Engineers, but at the pres-
ent time it appears to be its chief function.
Either through the American Association or
the plans of the development committees
of the four founder societies, or a union of
the two, will eventually be worked out the
larger purposes of the profession.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
sought be attained if the bulk of the
membership continues to be of the
"proletariat?" Many high class profes-
sional men are now leading the Amer-
ican Association and directing its
policies, but may not their situation
become as precarious as that of the
conservative leaders of organized la-
bor unless the great middle class of
the engineering profession comes to
their support. Is there any other
agency that offers as great a bulwark
for the profession against the en-
croachments of organized labor and
if not then on this ground alone the
American Association of Engineers
is deserving of the support of all.
But the great mass of the profes-
sion have finer, bigger, more altruistic
interests in present day agitation than
those arising out of purely selfish
aims. There is a wide-spread feeling
of the need for higher professional
standards and greater public service,
a demand for a larger interest and an
increased participation in municipal,
state and national affairs, not for self-
ish purposes but in order that as a pro-
fession we may render to our coun-
try and to the world the full service
of which we are capable.
Possibly the reason for this demand
can be expressed no better than it has
been by the Board of Directors of the
American Society of Civil Engineers
in a preamble and resolutions adopted
June 18, 1918, from which I quote the
following:
"The development and application
of the sciences in recent decades have
caused profound changes in the social
and industrial relationships of all
peoples.
"The engineer has been a leader
in this progress.
"Sociological and economic condi-
tions are in a state of flux and are
leading to new alignments of the ele-
ments of society.
"These new conditions are affect-
ing deeply the profession of engineer-
ing in its services to society, in its
varied relationships to communities
and to nations."
Although no one should take a
deeper interest and play a larger part
in the tremendous economic struggle
that today concerns the world than the
engineer, he is not the only profes-
sional man concerned. The world is
now in great need of leadership from
all of its educated classes.
Millions of men in Europe and per-
haps hundreds of thousands in Amer-
ica are today afflicted with an infec-
tious social malady. Many of these
men do not acknowledge the right of
the state to exist and enforce its man-
dates on the citizens under its juris-
diction for the maintenance of order
and the protection of property and
life. They are intent upon the de-
struction of the existing social order
and all that is a part thereof, the
church, the state and the home. These
•men are not mere small, separate and
unimportant groups of I. W. W.'s,
Syndicalists and Anarchists, scattered
throughout the country, but large
numbers of them have ingratiated
themselves into the American Feder-
ation of Labor and bid fair to control
its policies.
Whether we like it or not the time
has passed when the ordinary indi-
vidual can hope to be an influence in
vidual affairs of society. In fact, de-
mocracy has always been dominated
to some extent by one class or another.
We were first ruled in this country by
a beneficient aligarchy of brains, later
by organized capital and today the
united power of men who work with
their hands threatens to completely


281
control, if not overthrow government.
Democracy during the recent war was
a compromise between three organ-
ized units of society, capitalists, labor-
ers and farmers, with the influence of
labor largely predominating. The re-
sults of the struggle during a gener-
ation between labor and capital have
on the whole been beneficial not only
to labor but to the general public. All
of the improvements in and surround-
ing modern industry have directly or
indirectly resulted therefrom. But
labor is fighting primarily for its own
interests and not for the interests of
the public. The hand-worker is neces-
sary to the world and his rights must
be protected but likewise every other
class of our intricate society. Special
privilege for one class, be that class
large or small, is undemocratic and
the domination of class over class is
tyranny.
Professional men have not yet
spoken as a single social unit. Doc-
tors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, and
all the other products of our schools
and universities who should be best
fitted to represent the public in the
counsels of government, having rights
at least equal to and responsibilities
even greater than those of the capital-
ists, or the laborers or farmers, have
not yet been united into a single social
class. Until they are so united the
individual members thereof and the
general public may expect to suffer
from the domination of others.
Herein lies the greatest reason for
an all comprehensive engineering or-
ganization, including the upper, mid-
dle and lower classes of engineering
society, unselfish in its controlling
purposes and equal to the task of en-
abling that profession which has here-
tofore been so largely responsible for
man's advancement to take its proper
place in the larger sphere of oppor-
tunity afforded by a new world and a
new social order.
I believe that America's democracy
can be perpetuated through the efforts
of her educated classes acting as
strongly organised social units and no
class has within itself greater poten-
tial power for effective public service
than the engineering profession. If
educated men remain content as on-
lookers and bystanders, if engineers,
lawyers, doctors, teachers and all pro-
fessional and scientific men hold aloof
from the class struggle of democracy,
then real democracy will disappear
and in its stead we will have either the
beneficient dictatorship of sane labor
or it may be the outrageous tyranny
of a soviet regime. Most of us would
not relish the former; few of us an-
ticipate the latter.
Here then is a call to duty for the
engineering profession and a call tha
men of vision appreciate. Who car
say that this splendid opportunity for
service has not already been a poten
factor in our present professional
awakening?


FOR INDUSTRIAL EFFICIENCY
C. W. GUSTAVUS, "18E
In the industrial world today one
of the greatest problems is to put the
right man in the right place, from the
position of the chief executive down
to the janitor. This difficulty has been
aggravated within the last two years
or more due to so many people work-
ing in trades and occupations at which
they have never worked before. That
this is true can be seen in the present
order of things, brought about by les-
sened production and a demand great-
er than ever asked before. Lessened
production is also augmented by so
many people changing from war work
back to some line of endeavor differ-
ent from what they have been accus-
tomed to, because thoughts of today
and the views of the future are differ-
ent than those held before the war
cloud burst. From this brief resume
it can be seen that the thing to do dur-
ing the readjustment period is to get
the people into work where they can
do the most good. This does not
necessarily mean getting them to do
what they always been doing, because
misfits always existed, and will con-
tinue to exist unless better means are
devised for determining a person's
fitness.
The application of psychological
research and findings to alleviate this
difficulty will now be discussed.
Application
In the present day and age the goal
of everyone seems to be that of get-
ting the most possible by the least ef-
fort. Do not misconstrue my assertion
and think that I refer to highway rob-
bery, games of chance and unfair bus-
iness methods. What I mean is the de-
sire for efficiency, that is, the elimina-
tion of waste. Heretofore we were sat-
isfied so long as a thing was done, but
now we are concerned as to how it is
done. This is very true, especially of
our large industrial establishments
and the whole situation simmers down
to the determination of how things
should be done. This question has
been settled as far as machinery is
concerned, and only the human factor
remains as our chief problem. We
have this human factor under control
as far as to how it should work, but
the great question is to get the right
person,—one who is just suited to the
requirements established. Psychology
seems to be an aid in securing the
right person and its application for
industrial efficiency will now be ex-
plained.
Psychology and its application for
industrial efficiency is in its infancy,
and like anything else that is new, has
its ardent followers and also those
who are directly opposed to it. The
followers are the students in the psy-
chological laboratories and the men of
affairs, men who are on the watch for
anything that looks as if it is worthy
of a fair trial. The opponents are
especially the unions because they are
afraid of the reduction of workmen
in their respective trades. This is a
fallacy, however, that the theory of
economics proves false.
The prime purpose of psychological
inquiry is to put the right man in the


283
right place. We do not want misfit
in the industrial work and it can read-
ily be seen that this is the key to effi-
ciency. And what is more, this is a
solution that seems to be satisfactory
to those two great factions, namely,
labor and capital. Capital is willing
to interest itself and when labor sees
capital attempting to help it, we have
two great bodies working toward a
common end and when this condition
exists we can be very hopeful for re-
sults that will be worth while and
beneficial to the whole human race.
Before taking up the subject of psy-
chology itself it will be best to differ-
entiate the two apparently distinct ap-
plications of it in obtaining industrial
efficiency.
The first method, and which I think
is not as satisfactory, is the establish-
ment of the vocational bureau. Here
psychological analyses are conducted
and the person applying is given advice
as to which kind of work he would be
best suited for. With the assistance
of compiled data we could perhaps
quite accurately tell where a man
would fit best, but on a whole this is
too general. We must be more min-
ute. In the first place, we have no
reliable data, the statistics used for
this purpose being in their infancy,
and the second great and serious draw-
back is that every job or position has
distinct peculiarities. Our experi-
mental phychology should not look to
general fitness, but to special, exact
fitness. This can be only accomplished
by applying our second method, the
psychological test, especially prepared
for a certain vocation, at .the time a
person makes application for the. work.
This, however, has one drawback, but
it can be overcome as will be men-
tioned later. This second method has
a decided advantage over the first in-
asmuch as everyone would come under
the test, whereas if a person was left
to himself to inquire at the vocational
bureau, he would in some cases sub-
stitute his own judgment as to what
he wants to do or is best fitted for.
Tradition and inheritance would also
be considered by the person and our
endeavors in psychological findings
would not be put to the real test.
Another great problem that con-
fronts us is the application and meth-
ods used in getting results by psycho-
logical research. There are two dis-
tinct difficulties, namely, the reproduc-
tion of the conditions under which the
person will actually work, and the pre-
vention of a different attitude of mind
by the person under the test than the
attitude that would exist during the
actual work. It is vitally essential
that these two conditions be accurately
taken care of or our purposes would
be immediately defeated. Here we
are again hard pressed for confirma-
tion of our tests. Reliable data is not
available and the condition that our
man is being tested for does not very
often arise in most work. To make
this clear we will take the example of
the tests for avoidance of accidents
by motormen in the electric railway
service. Here accidents are innumer-
able and actual results can be easily
compared for confirmation of psycho-
logical findings. But when it comes to
establishing a test for the fitness of a
certain man as captain of a large
trans-Atlantic liner, we cannot do this.
Suddenly unexpected complications on
the bridge of a ship of this nature are
not common, and Titanic disasters oc-
cur very rarely, so from a scientific


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
viewpoint, cases for comparison in the
ship'service are not very good.
Another phase that is very impor-
tant to watch for is when and where
to draw the line on efficiency. This
brings up the question as to whether
the man should be tested for just those
qualities that have a direct bearing on
the work or should he also be tested
for qualities that have an indirect bear-
ing. As a simple example we can take
an elevator conductor. Our psycho-
logical tests would show him well
adapted to quick nerve reaction by
sudden observations. This would en-
able him to judge distances and stop
his car the first time so that its floor
would be level with the building floor.
But was he tested for recklessness?
Often have I stepped into an elevator
and could feel the cage beginning to
drop before taking my other foot from
the building floor. Such action might
be conducive to great efficiency in
handling a crowd with a minimum
number of elevators, but it is not the
best thing for safety first. Another
quality that would have an indirect
bearing would be the man's honesty.
It would be but the work of a moment
to stop his car at a floor where he
knew that a nearby office was vacant
for a few moments and successfully
rob the safe. It might be mentioned
here that, as this example shows, it is
best to apply the test at the time appli-
cation is made for employment, be-
cause honesty or other qualities may or
may not be a very deciding factor, ac-
cording to the conditions prevailing.
Finally we come to the application
of our psychological tests. As was
previously mentioned, the best place to
use the test is at the time of employ-
ment, but as stated, there is a serious
drawback. This drawback seems to
be the preparation of a test that will
not require a fully equipped, expensive
laboratory. To make such a test effec-
tive in the hands of the average em-
ployer means that it must be simple
and easily applied. It has been shown
by the late Professor Munsterberg of
Harvard University that comparative
simple tests such as card sorting and
piling have given wonderful results
and it is hoped for that the psycho-
logical analysis can be resolved into a
simple effective method. By it it is
hoped that the right man will be put in
the right place and this means nothing
more than what our economist has
shown us is necessary to efficiency,
that is, every man doing that which he
is best suited for. Many may scoff at
the theories of the psychologist, but it
is a step in the right direction for se-
curing industrial efficiency.

EDITORIAL
Due to unpresentable difficulties at
the Press the publication of the De-
cember issue of the Technic was de-
layed. We ask our readers to excuse
its tardiness.
With this issue the present staff of
the Technic finishes a very successful
year. Following a most discouraging
period due to war conditions at the
University the publication was placed
in the control of the 1919 staff, which
set to work at once to establish the
Technic on a firm basis.
While the success of our efforts
from the standpoint of the value of the
articles published will be left to the
decision of the reader, the business


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
staff is gratified to state that, despite
difficulties of reorganization, the finan-
cial condition of the publication has
been raised from a minus quantity to
a very positive one.
Prospects for 1920 are unusually
cheerful. A large number of very ac-
tive assistants have volunteered to help
the staff members and other means are
at hand to assist members of the new
staff to assume their duties after the
Christmas holidays. Already several
interesting articles have been arranged,
some of which deal with very impor-
tant discoveries made by professors at
the University engaged in research
work.
The Technic has the largest number
of subscribers in its history and is read
by technical men all over the country.
That the Technic may continue to be
and, if possible, augment its present
worthy of the University of Michigan
prestige will be the goal of the new
staff.
Radical Changes Occur in Engi-
neering Society
At last the break has come between
the A. S. M. E. and the Engineering
society. Now we no longer have one
organization, but a number of smaller
ones, each working independently of
the others. It is true that for some
time the societies seem to have been
working against each other, and it is
probably because of this friction that
the A. S. M. E. decided to dissolve
affiliation with the Engineering society.
But, nevertheless, it is with regret
that we see them separate. We have
always maintained that the branches
are a logical part of the society; and
we still believe that there should be
one large organization in this College
if we are to have a maximum of
strength and efficiency. No one will
question but that there should be
means of unification of the A. S. M.
E., A. I. E. E., and other branch so-
cieties. They are all representative of
the Engineering school and as such
they should be combined into one great
general society.
What we would like to see then, is
a reorganization of these branches and
the present general society. The prob-
lem is to co-ordinate them in such a
way as to produce a real, live, active,
and truly representative Engineering
society.
Should the Engineer Take a Five
Course?
At present there is much agitation
in favor of a five year curriculum for
a degree in the College of Engineer-
ing. This plan is meeting with the
hearty support and approval of the
faculty. It is a movement that should
be supported.
More cultural work is essential.
Under the present system students in
the College of Engineering are unable
to secure sufficient cultural work.
Students who graduate in the alloted
space of time seldom have had more
than two cultural courses outside of
language requirements and the gen-
eral average is lower than this. Nearly
every engineer takes at least twelve
hours of required work in foreign
language. This leaves but four hours
of cultural electives and a desire to
secure knowledge of such subjects as
philosophy, economics, sociology, and
courses in business administration.
Assuming that we are to have a five
year course in the near future, how
can such a course in engineering be
best given? Two years of literary


287
work as a prerequisite for engineering
is finding some favor but it is not the
ideal method. A pre-engineer fresh-
man taking two years of literary work
would not derive all possible benefit
out of his courses, feeling that they
had no bearing on engineering. Again
three years of straight technical work
would prove monotonous.
Another system which is being dis-
cussed favorably by the student body
is to change the present four year
course to five years and make at least
one course each semester a required
cultural subject. In five years this
would amount to ten or more courses
of approximately thirty credit hours.
This system would make schedules
more varied and interesting. The
freshman or sophomore would not ap-
preciate courses dealing with account-
ing, economics, business administra-
tion, and labor problems, while a jun-
ior or senior would realize their im-
portance and consequently would de-
rive the benefit intended by taking
such work.
Some sort of a decision on this ques-
tion will probably be made in the near
future and it is hoped that the above
mentioned system will be given proper
consideration by the faculty.
"Bring Him to Michigan"
These parting words given us on
the eve of the winter holidays had ref-
erence chiefly to prep school athletic
stars who might be persuaded to dedi-
cate their prowess to the Maize and
Blue.
We surely welcome athletes to
Michigan and even make unusual ef-
forts to bring them here. Why not
carry the idea a step further and let
the "him" be a prominent student who
during his high school period has
shown promise of becoming a great
engineer, lawyer, doctor or the like.
Michigan is surely more than an ath-
letic institution. For three years a
man on the gridiron or track may place
Michigan's triumphs upon the sport-
ing pages of all our large dailies, but
an eminent professional man can carry
the prestige of Michigan around the
world for a lifetime. So, if you have
any influence with any prep school
athlete, head him towards Ferry Field,
and if it lies within your power to con-
tribute to Michigan's lasting fame, will
you be a true Michigan man if you
miss your' opportunity?
To 23E
Freshtr.er engineers! Yon have been
with us several months now and should
be well versed in Michigan traditions.
As a class the Engineering College has
not been ashamed of you. However,
no class is perfect and, like other
groups of incoming students, you have
among you individuals who are either
foolish or blind.
The matter to which we have refer-
ence is that of toques. There are still
a few among you, chiefly "S. A. T. C.
frosh" who because of a short period
on the campus as members of the S.
A. T. C. deem themselves above their
fellow classmen, despite the fact that
they have failed to complete the work
of a single semester, either here or
elsewhere. When spring comes their
cases will be very summarily dealt
with and their vanity unceremoniously
squelched. However, during the
months intervening between the pres-
ent and the time when the upperclass-
men are wont to administer punish-
ment, the Engineering College is ex-
pecting '23E to look within itself and


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
cause a score of gray toques with yel-
low tops to be purchased. Then the
accusation may not be made that '23E
is lacking in upholding this Michigan
tradition.
Furthermore, gentlemen remove
their head, coverings while in the halls
of public buildings. This applies to
the halls of the Engineering College as
well.
In This Issue
In this issue the Technic offers the
last of a series of articles on modern
evaporators written especially for it by
Prof. W. L. Badger. The concluding
article deals with evaporator accessor-
ies.
"Heat and Work" is the title of an
article by Prof. J. E. Emswiler which
should have a strong interest for engi-
neering students. The article deals
with heat engines.
"Psychology and Industrial Effi-
ciency" by C. W. Gustavus deals with
a phase of modern industry which is
growing in importance. "The En^'
neer and the Community" reflects the
increasing realization by technical men
of their duties to their fellowmen.
In an "Appreciation of Dean Cool-
ey" the Technic voices its regard for
the master mind of Michigan's engi-
neering college. The first part of this
article is taken from an article pub-
lished in Power Plant Engineering.
The construction of geysers is trea*
ed in an interesting exposition by Prof.
W. H. Hobbs.

M. L. BURTON ELECTED PRESIDENT
OF UNIVERSITY
Marion LeRoy Burton, president of the
University of Minnesota, has accepted the
unanimous offer of the Regents of the Uni-
versity of Michigan to succeed President
Harry B. Hutchins. He will assume his
duties on the ist of July next.
He is a young man, only 45 years old,
and has a long period of constructive use-
fulness ahead of him. He will be able to
complete any program that he might inau-
gurate at the University, and with a record
that would insure him being a capable and
successful educator and administrator. The
University of Minnesota has advanced rap-
idly under the presidency of Dr. Burton.
His scholarly abilities are attested by the
number of degrees bestowed on him by the
universities and colleges of the country.
He has been President of the University
of Minnesota since July I, 1917, having left
the presidency of Smith College, at North
Hampton, Mass., to fill the former position.
He was born at Brooklyn, la., Aug. 29,
1874. He was graduated from Carleton
College in 1900. He has received the fol-
lowing degrees; Ph. D., Yale, 1907; D.D.
Carleton College, 1909; LL.D. Tufts Col-
lege, 1911; also the same degree from the
Western Reserve College, 1911; and from
Amherst and Hobart in 1913.
It was the general atmosphere of Ann
Arbor, its location, the fact that it was a
college town, and the opportunities there
for big, constructive work, that induced
Dr. Burton to accept.
President Burton is a man of impressive
but not ponderous personality He is con-
siderably above the average in stature,
erect and vigorous, with much more the air
of the business world than of the scholarly
cloister. Innate refinement of person-
ality is as evident as the reserve strength
necessary to a man who assumes responsi-
bility for the direction of an institution rep-
resenting a vast outlay of money as well as
the traditions of intellectuality.
We all join together in wishing Dr. Bur-
ton the best of success in his new task, and
we realize that Michigan's reputation and
fame will be greatly strengthened, because
of the guidance of one who is so capable.
PROFESSOR PARKER DOES IMPOR-
TANT CIVIC WORK
On November 4, the City of Kalamazoo
had a city election to pass on a bond issue
of $1,260,000 for the purpose of building a
municipal lighting and power plant which
had been recommended in a report by a
firm of consulting engineers retained by
the City Commission. The Citizens Voters'
League retained Professor John C. Parker
of the Electrical Engineering Department to
review the report of the engineers. Pro-
fessor Parker found that the engineers had
apparently under-estimated the expense and
over-estimated the possible earnings of the
municipal plant. His analysis of the report
was published in the daily papers and on
November 4, a 2 to I vote defeated the
bond issue.
DR. HOLLIS SPEAKS
Dr. Ira N. Hollis, late president of the
A. S. M. E., and now chairman of that
organization's committee on relations to
colleges, spoke to the student body of the
Engineering College on the subject of "A
Day's Work." At Annapolis Dr. Hollis and
Dean M. E. Cooley were room-mates. His
visit in Ann Arbor was brought about by


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the influence of the student branch of the
A. S. M. E. He is the president of the
Worcester Polytechnic Institute.
"I am in sympathy with the aims of the
labor unions," Dr. Hollis said, "but I be-
lieve that they make the men lose interest
in their work. They only do enough work
to earn a reasonable wage. Although the
unrest is precipitated by the war, the
strikes and labor unrest are about due at
this time because the conditions created be-
fore the war."
"The twentieth century is one of recon-
struction in which the application of the
inventions are to be worked out, and civili-
zation is to more fully profit by them."
THE 1921 J HOP
The J Hop at Michigan is known far and
wide as being the biggest social function
undertaken by that University. The com-
mittee in charge is doing everything pos-
sible to maintain this high standard in the
production of the 1921 Junior Hop. Twelve
men, representative of the Junior classes
of every college on the campus comprise
this commitee. The various sub-committees
have been appointed and each man is al-
ready busily engaged with his own partic-
uar detail of the function.
The 1921 J-Hop will occur on the even-
ing of February 13th., in Waterman Gym-
nasium, equalling and excelling if possible
the functions that have been given in form-
er years.
The members of the committee are as
follows, R. E. Dillon, chairman, R. McKean,
R. Kuhn, G. Roderick, T. Kings ford, J.
Watts, L. Schott, H. French, R. Marshall,
H. Erbland, C. Lemp, and M. McGowan.
THE DAVIS HIGHWAY LIBRARY
To answer the needs of the highway en-
gineer, to give him opportunities for orig-
inal and concentrated research work, there
was founded in 1910, through the efforts
of Mr Charles Henry Davis, president of
the National Highways Association, a
Library of Highway Engineering. This
library is maintained in connection with the
graduate courses offered by Prof. A. H.
Blanchard in Highway Engineering at the
University of Michigan. It is the most
complete collection in this country of works
on highway engineering and allied sub-
jects.
The Library contains bound volumes,
manuscripts, pamphlets, reports, specifica-
tions, maps, drawings, blue-prints, and the
latest trade catalogues descriptive of ma-
chinery and materials used in highway en-
gineering throughout the world. Town,
municipal, county, park, state, and gov-
ernment reports and specifications form a
very valuable part of the Library. In ad-
dition to works pertaining essentially to
highway engineering, there are many vol-
umes on allied subjects, such as chemistry,
physics, geology, town planning, civic im-
provement, law, finance, scientific manage-
ment, and civil and mechanical engineering.
The rare books include treatises written in
French, German, and English dating back
as early as 1720, and including the first
editions of the works of John Loudon
McAdam.
Over fifty periodicals are subscribed to,
including French, German, English, and
Canadian journals. As a guide and aid in
research work, all periodicals are abstracted
and indexed on cards. In all technical liter-
ature, the latest information being none too
new, it is the periodicals which usually con-
tain the most valuable and up-to-date data.
Each abstract card contains the subject of
the article, the title and author, the pages
and columns of the periodicals in which
it appears, a brief abstract, and the number
of words and a symbol indicating its value
from the standpoint of the highway engi-
neer. Often sufficient information is given
on the card, so that no further search is
necessary. This file supplements the print-
ed engineering indexes, the scope of which
is necessarily too broad to allow of exten-
sive indexing of any one subdivision of
engineering, such as roads and pavements.
All monographs, pamphlets, specifications,
and paper-bound reports are bound in num-
bered manila folders and filed in a series
of vertical cabinets of different sizes built
for filing correspondence, legal and archi-
tectural forms. The material contained in


291
the files is indexed in three card catalogues,
covering authors, titles, and subject-matter
respectively.
Many engineers have already availed
themselves of the opportunity to carry on
extensive research work, and it is hoped
that in the near future highway officials,
engineers, contractors, and all interested in
any problem in highway engineering will
feel free to consult and make use of this
special Library.
RHODES SCHOLARSHIP AWARDED
TO CARSON
The Engineering College is proud of the
fact that one of its younger faculty mem-
bers has won the Rhodes Scholarship.
Ralph Carson '17, for three years on the
English staff of the Engineering College,
has the honor of being the first man ap-
pointed to that honor, from Michigan, since
1917. Because of the war, no men were
appointed during the years of 1918 and 1919,
and hence Michigan's quota has been
doubled for the next two years. It is cus-
tomary to appoint 32 men from the United
States each year.
Mr. Carson has not only been very suc-
cessful and popular as an instructor, but
has been chairman of the Junior mentor
committee, and has in many ways taken an
active interest in the life of the college.
He left in December for his new work
at Oxford, England, where, according to
the provisions of the scholarship, he will
study for the next three years. Mr. Car-
son's departure is a distinct loss to the En-
gineering College, but the many friends he
has won here are proud of the honor that
has come to him and wish him success in
his new work.
BASKETBALL
Michigan's basketball outlook for this
season is exceptionally bright, the men are
turning out well, show fine form, display
accurate basket tossing and are coached by
an efficient, up-to-date, energetic basketball
coach. Coach Edward Mather has an ex-
cellent record behind him and is starting
out to keep it excellent. His coaching is the
kind that develops a "team" rather than
one or two men, and teamwork wins the
game.
He says, "The Conference is going to be
surprised at Michigan's prowess. Illinois,
Minnesota, Chicago and Wisconsin will all
have strong teams and think that Michigan
will be easy prey. They are mistaken. We
have good material, men who are able to
fill their positions completely, and men who
are working for Michigan. I could ask for
nothing better."
Captain Rychener has piloted his team
through the Holiday trip most success-
fully, developing team work and individual
playing that bid fair to put Michigan in
the lead of the Conference teams.
The first night of vacation Western Nor-
mal five outplayed Michigan in a 27 to 14
contest. The varsity forwards seemed to
be unable to get near the basket due to
the fine defense of the Normals.
On the night of December 31st Michigan
beat the Oakland Motor team, at Pontiac,
20 to 9. New Years, the Champion Igni-
tions five lost to the Wolverines 34 to 15.
Dunne and Rychener starring continually,
while Rea showed up as an excellent bas-
ket tosser.
Two games were played in Detroit, one
a victory over the D. A. C, 36 to 17, and
the other a defeat at the hands of the
Rayls, 19 to 14. This was the last game on
the Holiday trip, but as the Rayls are con-
sidered one of the country's strongest, no
one is discouraged.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
TRACK
Track Coach Steve Farrell said, "Mich-
igan is going to win." With that statement
as an incentive, and Farrell seldom makes a
mistake, Michigan men should come out
when the call is given and help. With the
exception of the milers and half-milers,
Farrell thinks that he has an undefeatable
lot of men.
After the Christmas holidays training
started in earnest. Of course it is confined
to the Gym until the weather permits of
outdoor work, nevertheless nearly as good
practice can be done. As soon as spring
comes and the ground gets hard enough to
run on, the cross country squads will again
be seen galloping over the hills. Farrell is
not going to let anything be forgotten in the
training line and when June 5th brings the
Conference track meet here his men will
be ready to respond to the cry, "Let's Go
Michigan."
A big mass meeting was held Thursday
night, January 8th, to formally open the-
track season and an outline of Michigan's
possibilities was given by Coach Farrell.
Many of the old point winners are back
and the new material seems exceptionally
good. Carl Johnson has not forgotten how
to take the hurdles and Farrell thinks that
he will be able to surpass his old records
Rurkholder is occupying the front lines
in speed and endurance, and is a pivotal
man in everyone's calculations. As a run-
ning mate for Johnson, Beardsley seems to
be the choice and is counted on to help
greatly in the Track meet here this spring.
Meese and Joiner are working hard and
Farrell says that the conference will have
to show some mighty fine material to out-
distance them. At the shot put Joe Baker
is showing his old form and is counted on
to again win this event.

Joseph Wins 1919 Harpham Trophy
In spite of the heavy snowfall Joseph
completed the Turkey Day run within three
seconds of record time. The six men who
received their jerseys crossed the line in
this order: Joseph, Schimmel, Maynard,
Earle, Pemberthy, and Nowlan.
The Harpham Trophy race was estab-
lished in 1916 by a former Michigan ath-
lete, after whom it was named, for the pur-
pose of creating greater interest in cross
country running.
The course starts and ends at the Ferry
Field clubhouse and covers a distance of five
miles. Each year the winner's name is en-
graved on the bronze plate which hangs in
Waterman Gym. In addition to this the
winner is presented with a large silver
loving cup, and the men taking second and
third places receive small cups.
Previous to this year the plate bore the
names of Carrol 1916, Sedgwick 1917, Houf-
stater 1918. A record of 27 minutes and
34 seconds is held by Sedgwick.
NEW GAS BURNER INSTALLED IN
FOUNDRY
In order to show the advantages of both
coke and gas burners the foundry has in-
stalled a new Premier Maxim gas burner
for mixing brass and all non-ferrous metals.
The installation was completed during the
Christmas holidays and some tests were run
before the school opened again in Janu-
ary.
The gas burner is supposed to be cheaper
and more efficient than the coke burner.
Comparative tests are to be made and the
actual saving and efficiency found. In the
gas burner the heat can be regulated to a
much finer degree, as the intensity of the
flame is proportional to the volume of gas


293
and air admitted. This fact alone reduces
the cost of operation considerably.
During the latter part of December a
test on brass was run, the object being to
determine the chemical and physical changes
which take place in the alloy as it is being
heated Starting with the metal at a temper-
ature of about 65 degrees, Mr. Scheffner
and Mr. J. R. Hastings have observed and
tabulated the chemical and physical changes
that occur as the metal becomes hotter and
hotter, until the final temperature of about
950 degrees is reached. They proposed to
profession. The following statement was
given to the Technic by Prof. L. M. Gram,
newly elected president of the Detroit
branch of the A. S. C. E., following a meet-
ing of that body which includes many Ann
Arbor engineers:
"In response to a demand by engineers
generally throughout the country there is
now under way a concerted effort on the
part of the four national engineering soci-
eties; i. e., A. S. C. E., A. S. M. E., A. I.
E. E. and A. I. Min. E., to bring activities
into closer harmony. Indeed, some of the
Unusual View of the En
find the highest temperature to which the
metal could be subjected and still keep the
topper from segregating from the zinc, thus
finding the critical temperature of the brass.
It is hoped that the new shops, which are
to be built near the hospital, will be started
and completed soon so that facilities for
research and important calculations, which
are lacking in the present shops, will be
available.
ONE GENERAL SOCIETY
A national engineering society embracing
all branches of the profession and elimin-
ating the various existing societies for the
men in different branches of engineering is
icing urged by many men prominent in the
gineering Building and Shops
more radical of their members feel that a
determined effort should be made at this
time to combine all of the national engineer-
ing societies into one, believing such an
organization with its unity of spirit and
effort would be a vast improvement over
present conditions. There is a growing
feeling that engineers are too prone to ab-
sorb themselves in technical matters to the
exclusion of the broader problems which
are floating over them meanwhile. It is
thought that a single organization might in-
spire the members to more careful study
and action on issues affecting not only the
welfare of all engineers, but public interests
as well.
For the purpose of carefully surveying


294
the entire situation and recommending suit-
able action, development committees were
appointed by the four national societies
named and their joint report is being dis-
cussed by the members preliminary to bal-
loting. The report, in part, follows:
Identity and purpose. That the identity
of the four national engineering societies
be maintained and that the chief aim of
this society be the continued pursuit of the
objects for which it was created.
National organization. That a compre-
hensive national organization or council of
engineers be created to be composed of
representatives of national engineering so-
cieties in the proportion of one representa-
tive for each society for the first 200 to
2000 members, and one additional represen-
tative for each additional 2000 members or
major fraction thereof; and of representa-
tives of local, state and regional societies
in the proportion of one representative for
each society for the first 100 to 1000 mem-
bers, and one additional representative for
each 1000 additional members or fraction
thereof.
That this council has an executive board
chosen from among its members with a
specified representation from the national
societies and a proportional representation
from the local societies.
That the council should beet annually or
biennially, maintain a central office and deal
with questions of public welfare wherein
technical knowledge is involved, and with
matters of common concern to the various
branches of the profession.
That this organization be so framed as to
include allied technical societies
That national societies contribute $1.50
and other societies $1.00 per member to the
support of the national organization.
That co-operation among the various en-
gineering and allied technical societies in
technical activities, and affiliations of such
local organizations for general public serv-
ice and welfare work be encouraged.
That periodic joint meetings of the four
national engineering societies be arranged.
That the bill to create a national depart-
ment of public works receive the active
support of all engineers.
NEW INSTRUCTOR IN THE ENGI-
NEERING COLLEGE
On the evening of the 17th of October
a formal reception was given by President
Hutchins and the Board of Regents in
honor of the members of the faculty. This
reception is always held the same day as
Convocation. The affair was similar to
those of previous years except that this
year there was an exceptionally large at-
tendance, caused by the large numbers of
new men. The purpose of this reception is
to welcome the new members of the several
faculties. The new members of the Engi-
neering Faculty are:
John H. Bateman.
Arthur H. Blanchard.
Lawrence \V. Brunson.
William H. Egly.
James F. Fairman.
Arthur W. Gillespie.
Charles W. Good.
Oliver F. Heyden.
Ashley W. Hudnut.

INSPECTION TRIPS TAKEN BY
SEVERAL CLASSES
Several trips to Detroit and Chelsea
plants have been made during the past
months by groups of students in the Engi-
neering College. More than 100 students
were in each of the groups.
Students in the Chemical Engineering 5
class visited the Berry Brothers' varnish
plant, the Parke-Davis pharmacidial plant,
the Detroit City Gas plant, the Armstrong
Tanning plant, all in Detroit, and the Hiram
Walker distillery and the Postum Cereal
plant in Walkerville. Ont. Prof. A. H.
White and Prof. W. L. Badger were in
charge of the trip.
On the same day, November 29, members


295
of the A. S. M. E. visited the Detroit plants
of the Burrough's Adding Machine Com-
pany and the Cadillac Motor Company, A.
D. Althouse, '23?, was in charge of the
trip.
Saturday, December 6, Chemical Engi-
neering students in course 1 divided into
two groups, one of which visited the De-
troit industries while the other inspected
the Chelsea plants. The following week the
city not visited on the previous Saturday
was the destination of each of the groups.
The Michigan Portland Cement Company
of Chelsea and the Semet Solvay Company,
the Detroit Steel Casting Co and the De-
troit Iron and Steel Company of the Mich-
igan metropolis were visited.
The students in Shop 3 visited the foun-
dries of the Russel Wheel and Foundry
Company and the Aluminum Castings Com-
pany on December 11.
ACTIVITIES IN THE HIGHWAY
DEPARTMENT
The National Highway Traffic Associ-
ation, organized for the advancement of the
efficiency and regulation of highway traffic,
will hold its annual convention here Janu-
ary 5th to 9th. A large number of dele-
gates from all over the country are ex-
pected to attend. Morning and afternoon
session's will be held to discuss various sub-
jects as presented by experts. Prof. Arthur
H. Blanchard, newly appointed professor in
highway engineering here, is president of
the association.
The conference is open to the public and
all interested in highway transport are in-
vited by the University to attend the ses-
sions. The following are some of the sub-
jects which will be treated by men of ex-
perience in their special branches: Speeds,
weights and dimensions of motor trucks,
tractors, trailers and motor-busses; legisla-
tion relative to highway transport fran-
chises; interrelationship between highways,
railroads and waterways; port, terminal and
warehouse facilities including efficient
methods of packing, handling, loading and
unloading raw and finished materials;
"Back to the Farm" movement; inter-city
haulage; long and short haulage outside of
cities; rural motor express; return load
bureaus; plant and factory haulage; high-
way transport management; fundamentals
of highway transport; cost and rec-
ord systems; transportation surveys; funda-
mentals of highway engineering affecting
economic highway transport including trac-
tion, grades, foundations, curves, widths of
roadway, shoulders, types of roads and
pavements, bridges, detours and highway
signs.
The University of Michigan, being fore-
most in realizing the need of experienced
highway engineers to occupy innumerable
positions connected with the administration,
financing, design, construction and mainte-
nance of 2,500,000 miles of rural highways
and thousands of miles of streets in the
municipalities of the United States, estab-
lished a chair of Highway Engineering in
the Department of Civil Engineering and
has prepared special short courses for grad-
uate students and qualified special students
that may be taken during the winter months
when leaves of absence may be obtained
most readily by men engaged in the prac-
ice of highway engineering and highway
transport. During the present winter a
course in highway transport, one in the
study of bituminous surfaces and bitumin-
ous pavements, another in highway bridges
and a fourth in highway laboratory re-
search will be given from December to
March, inclusive. This course in highway
transport is the first ever given in a univer-
sity.
During 1920-1921 additional short courses
will be offered to enable the graduates to
obtain the degree of Master of Science in
engineering. Persons of mature age who
do not hold a degree will be admitted as
special students, not candidates for a de-
gree. Professor Blanchard will be glad to
correspond with anyone interested in the
new courses.
The University is well equipped for the
testing of stone, gravel, brick, cement and
bituminous materials. Additional equip-
ment will be installed this winter. When
present plans are completed, it is said,
Michigan will have the best highway labor-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
atory in the United States. The Davis
Library of Highway Engineering, located in
Room 407 of the Engineering building is
the most complete collection of works on
highway engineering in the country. In
addition, the University Library and the
Chemical Library may be used.

CHEMICAL ENGINEERING RE-
SEARCH
For a number of years Prof. A. H. White
has been studying volume changes in cement
under various conditions. This work is
being continued this semester by Mr. C. E.
Hardy who is working on the effect of
freezing on the strength and expansion of
cement test bars. Professor White is also
directing the work of Mr. C. A. Moulthrop
who is working on the recovery of sugar
from beet molasses by the strontium pro-
cess. This process has been too expensive
in the past, but with the higher prices of
sugar there is a possibility of its being


297
practical. Mr. I. D. Patterson is also work-
ing under him on the recovery of rubber
from manufactured articles.
Prof. A. H. White is beginning an in-
vestigation for the Detroit Edison Com-
pany on the causes of corrosion in econo-
mizer tubes. The life of the materials
usually employed in economisers is unreas-
onably short and it is hoped that some
indications may be found as to the proper
metal to employ. A study is also being
made of the causes of warping in iron cast-
ings. This necessitates storing castings for
long periods of time in case they are to be
accurately machined. The work is being
done by Mr. G. E. Campbell. Mr. C. J.
Tobin has a similar problem.
Under the direction of Professor Bad-
ger and Mr. Baker a study is being started
of conditions in the horizontal tube type of
evaporator. This work is being done by
Mr J. A. Bonnet, Mr. C. L. Rice, and Mr.
T. C. Simpson. All the work in the liter
ature on the theory of heat transmission
in evaporators has been done on the vertical
tube type, so that the field is very large
for investigations on the horizontal tube
type. The problem now under way is the
relation of depth of liquor and depth of
tube bank to capacity. Another problem
being handled in the Evaporator Laboratory
is the development of a new type of film
evaporator. The design of this type needs
a large amount of data that is not at pres-
ent available. Mr. L. A. deMarsh has this
problem. Mr. M. B. Doty is working on
the boiling point of caustic soda solutions
of different strengths and under different
pressures. This will furnish data needed
for the accurate design of caustic soda
evaporators.
Prof. W. P. Wood and Professor Upthe-
grove have a number of problems under
way in metallurgy. Mr. L. A. Rayman is
working on the shrinkage of steel during
heat treating Mr. N. H. Schermer and Mr.
A. M. Solomon are studying the heat treat-
ment and properties on nickel steel. Mr.
S. M. Schnitz is trying to find some evi-
dences of action between carbon monoxide
and nickel steel. This last has a bearing
on the causes of corrosion of these steels.
THE DETERMINATION OF THE
HEAT CONDUCTIVITY OF IRON
AND VARIOUS STEELS UP TO
10000 C.
The method which is being used is an
adaptation of the old Forbes method as
described in standard writings upon the
subject. The method consists in determin-
ing directly the conductivity from the
formula H=k.A. dT/dx, where H is the
heat conducted along a bare bar of cross
section A and temperature gradient dT/
dx. The gradient is determined directly
by a thermo-couple and the heat passing
through a given cross section by an auxil-
iary experiment.
In looking over reports of work done
in measuring the constant known as coef-
ficient of heat conductivity, it is observed
that the methods used are in many cases
very crude and that very little work has
been done except at relatively low tem-
peratures, i. e. 300 degrees C and lower.
In modern commercial practice quantities
of metal are often heated to 10000 C and
higher. The time necessary to heat a large
forging up to any required temperature or
conversely the rate of cooling of such a
forging when quenched are very important.
Inspection by agents of the United States
Government during the recent war showed
that many large arsenals had only empir-
ical methods for heating metal parts. As a
result as high as 75% of the output of some
factories was rejected. Since iron and steel
enter into modern industry in so many
ways their thermal conductivity should be
accurately known up to temperatures near
the melting point.
Angell of Wisconsin, using a method
suggested by Mendenhall, has measured
the thermal and electrical conductivities of
aluminum and nickel up to 6oo° C and
1200° C respectively. His method neces-
sitates the boring of a hole through a metal
and thus making it a hollow cylinder at
the center of which the radical conduction
is measured. This is obviously an impos-
sible method for hard steels which are
machined with difficulty. Worthing of the
Nela Research Laboratory has measured


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the thermal conductivities of tungsten, tan-
talum, and carbon at incandescence by
measuring the temperature along an elec-
trically heated filament in an incandescent
light bulb. The emissive power and con-
sequently the heat radiated at each temper-
ature are known. The energy imput was
measured and from this data the conduc-
tivity calculated.
The temperature gradient dT/dx is
measured along a metal bar heated elec-
trically by an A. C. current from a large
Welding Transformer. A narrow slit with
parallel sides is first cut along the bar to
its center. By placing a thermo-element
in the cavity insulated by fine glass or
quartz tubes the temperature can be meas-
ured from the center of the bar toward
either end. The black body temperature
thus obtained is quite accurately the tem-
perature of the whole cross section of the
bar if the bar is not too large in diameter.
Measurements previously made of temper-
ature by placing a thermo-element on the
surface of the bar or in a hole bored in the
bar are readily proven to be incorrect values
of the true temperature.
To find the heat passing through a given
cross section of the bar the Welding Trans-
former, previously mentioned, will be used.
The center of the bar will be the hottest
part and the temperature will fall off to-
ward the ends due to conduction of the
heavy leads. A current transformer,
through which one or more turns of the
secondary from the transformer pass, with
an A. C. ammeter offer a means of meas-
uring the current through the bar accur-
ately to 0.1 of 1 per cent. This value of
the current I used in the formula E I or PR
gives a value of the electrical imput of
energy. As E for -a small drop over sec-
tions of the bar cannot accurately be meas-
ured on an A.C. circuit, it is proposed to
measure the resistance of sections of the
bar by means of a Kelvin Double Bridge
and an A. C. galvanometer. Near the
center of the bar, if the bar be six inches
or more in length, there will be a short
section whose axial temperature gradient is
negligible, and whose temperature is a max-
imum for the bar. Hence all the heat gen-
erated in this section, i. e. PR, must be
lost at the surface by radiation or convec-
tion. Thus the electrical imput, i. e. the
surface loss, can be measured for several
temperatures of this section of the bar.
A graph of heat loss per square cm. against
temperature can then be constructed. The
heat passing through a given cross section
of the bar (toward the ends from the max-
imum temperature at the center) is equal
to the PR heat generated minus the loss
by radiation and convection between the
point of maximum temperature and the
given cross section. This loss can be found
from the graph previously mentioned.
Thus having measured H, A and dT/
dx, substitution of values in the formula
gives k. The method is direct and there-
fore simple in theory. It is independent of
the laws of heat loss provided the heat loss
from one section of the bar does not affect
another section. It can be used at low
temperatures as well as high, for hard steels
as well as soft iron, for one metal as well
as another. By using A.C. current Thomp-
son Effects and Parasitic currents are elim-
inated.

A BOULEVARD WALK


J. C. GODDEYNE, '21 A, Editor
H. S. BOOTH, '22A, Assistant
The Ministry of Beauty
You of the T-Square and the triangle!
You of the pencil, palette and the brush!
Agents are you of the great ministry of
beauty; you are the regenerators of the
race. In every age it is you who foster
this spirit in man—you of consecrated lives,
great is your mission. The perception of
beauty, not the praise of men, must be
your reward; the consciousness of inferior
work, your failure. You are to battle with
the commonplace, and carry courage and
hope to the struggling millions in the sea
of dread necessity, who yet yearn for bet-
ter things and a diviner life. There are
such—their name a legion—who have not
the gift of expression, but in whom the
love of the beautiful is unextinguishable.
Minister to these through your work and
it shall be blessed. While all the world
grows old, you remain young. In the midst
of cold dead globes you are the radiant
suns which shall warm them to at least a
reflected light. Through your work you
shall enter many homes and leave them
brighter; enter many hearts and leave them
happier.
When beauty and utility are seen to serve
the same end we receive a double bene-
fit. Where the two are forcibly separated
and falsely regarded as antithetical, it
arises from a failure to graps the basic idea
that beauty is itself the supreme necessity
in man's development. Barren must he be
of true and lasting thought without this.
Of all his work it is that alone which is
builded to beauty that lasts any consider-
able time. Impermanent as are all works of
man, yet while time aims to destroy, many
forces enlist themselves to protect and pre-
serve the work of beauty. It outlives gen-
eration after generation. It becomes the
child of centuries and still does not lose the
freshness of its youth. Museums are built
and nations assume protection of the paint-
in and the statue. A whole people cherish
their temples and cathedrals, their carvings
and stained glass. And where they become
indifferent, the neglected soon passes to the
control of those anxious to preserve and
venerate.
For the artist there is all hope so long
as he cleaves to the moral purpose of
beauty—from thence draws his inspiration,
with that fills his life. But let him depart
from that and he is lost. Art, then, must
be the temple wherein he worships the sub-
lime; his life a worship and his work the
evidence of such—the greatness, the virility,
the purity of his work but the greater
evidence. His inspiration must come from
above and within. He must see beauty
only, and know that beauty is spiritual.
Let him live in his Latin Quarters if he
choose, genial master of a lofty purpose,
with eyes only for the ideal. Art must be
his only bride and art is but one form of
worship of the immanent God. ' But if he
can not so live, let him forsake art. It is
no use for him to fly to the top of the high-
est mountain; his weakness dwells there as
well. To the strong, sane man Paris is a
vain show. He ceases to be aware of any-
thing but the purpose which brings him
there. He submerges all things to his chos-
en work. But to the weakling it is a vicious
school; he is soon infected with, the preva-
lent immorality and a slight waiver detracts
from the decision of his line—a little cloudi-
ness from the clarity of his colors.
I paint my character into my picture—I
build it into my house. These then de-
clare for my perception of beauty whether
it be real or superficial, whether it spring
from love or is personal and vain. Weak-
ness of character is as unsightly as leprosy.
But force of character, decision, strength,
tempered with great love is the real bemity


301
and will project itself in art such as no
lesser worth can create.
Painter, sculptor, architect—one and all
must rise to the universal. What have they
to do with personality who should live
solely for beauty? Yet as a fact they are
too often encumbered with a monstrous
egotism. They forget that personality is
an opaque glass and lets no clear sunlight
through. He who would consecrate him-
self to harmany must first of all come into
harmonious relations with his fellows. How
may he give fit expression to the universal
so long as he is warped, crabbed, bigoted,
in his outlook? His responsibility is
greater than is often realized. If I have
not risen out of myself, my brush convict?,
my pencil betrays me. I must give myself
wholly to beauty of life and beauty of
thought; my heart must be right or beauty
will not use me.
We are impressed by those examples of
art wherein we feel the universal had free
play. It is this that makes them to be
great. In the masterpiece it is beauty apart
from race and place—grace and beauty per-
sonified. These are not so much Greeks as
men and women. On San Minato we are
sensible, not of a biblical David, but of an
emblem of youth and courage. Not so
always with the paintings of the old mas-
ters; despite their technical marvels we
feel them to have been limited by subjects
which had not the elements of universality
but sprang from dogma. We look at the
traditional Madonnas but it is Motherhood
and Childhood that holds us. The tradi-
tions we may have outgrown, but of moth-
erhood and childhood we never outgrow.
Few of us can find inspiration in Egyp-
tian art and few of us in Japanese paint-
ings. We feel they do not appeal to univer-
sal sympathies but were done for ancient
Egyptians or almond-eyed Orientals. We
have not the key; can not see it with our
kind of eyes. All this, of course, refers to
the best value of art—its universal element.
Other elements there are notably an his-
toric value in reflecting what is purely local
in sentiment. Somehow the landscape is
never local, it is even universal. The same
sun, sky and sea, the same light and shade.
Nor are men ever purely local but all
strung as it were on one common strand
where in are twisted certain emotions, pas-
sions, aspirations. It is this element in the
picture that impresses the beholder and for
lack of this he is not impressed.
America today, the America in which you
and I find ourselves and in which we must
work out our own destinies, stands at the
threshhold of a new era. The bursting of
the old bonds, the seeking for new chan-
nels of expression, the impatience with con-
servatism in many forms are the signs of
higher intuitional faculties clamoring for
recognition. We have come to realize the
existence of mental qualities above and
apart from reasoning faculties—faculties of
the inner substance of man.
Art expression in America—be it in arch-
itecture, sculpture or painting—is bound to
be eclectic in its bases, its influences and
its forms; but from this common soil of
commingled cultures individual ideas will
grow abundantly. In a country made up of
so many racial strains, it is idle to seek for
a uniqueness in art expression which is not
the uniqueness of the individual. Amer-
ica's future, artistically, rests in the hands
of those who fully comprehend the strength
of the words, "The art of any generation
depends not upon its knowledge but upon
its ideals of faith and hope."
Bruce M. Donaldson,
Instructor in Fine Arts.
Honors to Professor Lorch
Hearty praise and thanks were extended
to Prof. Emil Lorch by the architects of
Michigan on Saturday, November 1st, for
his untiring efforts in behalf of all artistic
development, not only in the state, but in
the entire country. The dinner was given
by the Michigan Chapter of the American
Institute of Architects and the Michigan
Society of Architects, at the Detroit Ath-
letic Club, and was attended by over one
hundred practicing architects, professors *of
the department, and several of the stud-
ents. .
Thinking of the many things accomplish-'
ed, Professor Lorch deserved all the laurels


y&gt;2
heaped upon him by the various speakers.
A reserved man never makes much noise
about what he is doing, but keeps working
persistently from day to day, until he fin-
ally succeeds in gaining his desires. What
has Professor Lorch been seeking? He
has not sought wealth, for he has given of
both his means and energy for the ad-
vancement of those things he believes most
lasting in. life. He has always worked for
the progress of art in the United States and
for the last twelve years has worked par-
ticularly for architectural development. He
has led the Department of Architecture
from a group of thirty men to a body of
ambitious students, so crowded together
that their further progress is hindered
by their crampt quarters and inappropriate
surroundings. This increase is due to Pro-
fessor Lorch's progressive methods of run-
ning the most progressive architectural
school in the country—one of the many
worthwhile things he has accomplished.
Starting his professional career as a
draftsman, he studied at the Detroit Mu-
seum of Art School, before attending the
Boston Institute of Technology. He later
trained in the offices of many great archi-
tectural firms and received his Master of
Arts degree at Harvard in 1903. Beside
this training, he was an instructor during
different periods at the Art Institute of
Chicago, the Chicago School of Architec-
ture, Harvard University and the Drexel
Institute of Philadelphia, where he received
much practical training in preparation for
the position he now holds.
During the course of the speeches it was
pointed out that Professor Lorch's chief
interest, the Department of Architecture,
is at present handicapped by being located
in inappropriate surroundings and crowded
quarters, and by being an integral part of a
scientific college. This combination was
thought extremely detrimental to the ad-
vancement of good architecture in this
state, as was evidenced by the fact that
allpresent supported a motion to the effect
that a campaign be started in order to
bring about the creation of a separate col-
lege of Architecture, located in a building
appropriate to the study of architecture.
This idea, if carried out, would relieve the
congested situation in the College of En-
gineering, and give the architectural stud-
ents a genuine chance to progress.
W. G. Malcomson was toastmaster and
called on Messrs. George Booth, E. A.
Schilling, Marcus Burrowes, George
Brown, Guy Miller and Eugene Osgood for
addresses. In reply to these, Professor
Lorch assured his listeners that nothing
could be accomplished by a single man, but
only through the combined efforts of men,
and thanked them for their hearty support
in all his undertakings and for their testi-
monial of friendship.
Now All Together
Such an auspicious revival of the old
time spirit was exemplified last spring by
the committee in charge of the "Architec-
tural Salon," and the subsequent midnight
revelings in the ashes of the Old Surveying
building, that all of us are wont to have
encouraging anticipations for a successful
continuation of our society.
Primarily the Architectural Society seeks
to offer a sort of all-together gathering
similar to the assemblies of the Engineer-
ing College and College of Literature.
Surely no one can gainsay the advantages
to be gleaned through the good fellowship
thus sown. Here frosh not only meets
frosh, but he learns who's who and why
among the upperclassmen, and a close and
sympathetic friendship results, a more hon-
est criticism of our problems is offered,
petty antagonism is forgotten, and a sin-
cere striving for Michigan ideals exists.
Occasionaly we have outside representa-
tives of our profession to speak to us con-
cerning some work in which they are 1
gaged. We thus acquire an intrinsic
knowledge of labor, economical and gov-
ernmental issues that a project involves —
potent factors of today, though we are often
prone to neglect their study and devote
our hours over the drawing board. A half
hour spent with these men teaches us more
than a week in the library and might be
compared to the time on the scaffolding in
a construction course.


303
Now and then we devote an evening en-
tirely to social enjoyment, as the Salon
last spring. The faculty is usually repre-
sented, and the drawing board and sketches
yield to the festal board and a line directly
from the heart. Members of the faculty
are not as severe as might appear, and a
recital of their joys and tribulations al-
ways serve to renew our endeavor and to
strengthen our ambitions.
This fall Mr. Grylls of Smith, Hinchman
and Grylls of Detroit has consented to de-
scribe his tour of Japan,—that bit of pic-
turesqueness in the Pacific and the land of
flowers, sunshine and pagodas. From the
lips of an architect such a description is of
incalculable value, embracing a country of
design with which we do not come much
in contact in our scheduled history courses
and that often makes the appropriate treat-
ment for tea houses, the garden rest, and
similar creations that seem to spring from
nature's Ian. Mr. Pond, the designer of
the Union, has promised to hold a con-
ference at an informal meeting which
should prove enlightening, for surely we
have a wealth of vexing questions which
have shaped themselves in the past few
years. Mr. Albert Kahn, the designer of
Hill Auditorium, last year gave us a lec-
ture concerning his trip to France. Pro-
fessor Hunt obtained an expert from the
Bedford Limestone Association, and by a
series of well chosen slides and terse re-
marks duly compensated all who attended.
Dr. Goodyear was induced to display his
matchless collection of enlarged photo-
graphs of French and Italian cathedrals.
We do not attempt to enumerate all the
worth-while things the society has accom-
plished, but merely wish to emphasize the
capabilities of such an organization.
Countless channels present themselves for
further effort toward an ideal attainment.
For instance, excursions can be more suc-
cessfully arranged if the society as a body
eagerly respond. Then too, traveling ex-
hibits of our work have proven feasible,
our housing exhibit having demonstrated
this. Would they not promote a more gen-
eral and widespread interest in our pro-
fession and prompt latent talent to chose
our Alma Mater as the place for their edu-
cational career. A design for an architec-
tural college could form the subject of a
competition, for surely our quarters are re-
tarding the progress of the school. It has
been suggested that a trip to Europe be
made next summer if sufficient students
signify their willingness. Such a trip would
greatly enhance the value of an academic
training.
Finally, the scope of all our ambitions
can only be influenced by your enthusi-
asm. Let us, therefore, resolve to attend
regularly the Michigan Architectural So-
ciety semi-monthly meetings. Let us re-
frain from offering excuses of any nature,
but rather give our hearty support.
Medal to "Darby" Kenyon
On November 12th Professor Lorch, in
the name of the American Institute of
Architects, conferred the honorary medal
on J. D. Kenyon '18. His introductory
remarks dealt mostly with the aspirations
of the association, its intimate relations to
the student body, the purpose and origin
of granting such a medal, and the recent
modifications of the requirements govern-
ing its bestowal. At present, instead of the
highest grade during the usual four years
in all subjects necessary, the committee of
awards must be particularly cognizant of
general architectural ability.
Here especially Mr. Kenyon won well
earned distinction. All of his designs bear
a characteristic conception of construction
and beauty, a true interpretation of the
problems, and disclose the guidance of an
ever watchful critic. Coupled with his valu-
able drawings, Mr. Kenyon leaves a nobler
heritage with us—the memory of a real
character, sound convictions, an even
temper and an indomitable will. He, too,
can be doubly proud, having experienced
the most interesting vicissitudes with the
A. E. F. with which a soldier can be blest.
Our heartfelt congratulations are extended
him.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Inter-Professional Conference
One of the most interesting and promis-
ing movements which has ever been sug-
gested is that known as "The Inter-Pro-
fesional Conference," which was held
in Detroit, November 28-29. At this meet-
ing it was hoped to form some kind of an
organization representing all the profes-
sions, or to decide whether such an or-
ganization is feasible.
The Conference was organized at the
invitation of the post-war committee on
architectural practice of the American In-
stitute of Architects to bring the profes-
sions together in order to plan more effec-
tive relations with each other and toward
the social problems of the day.
The acting chairman of the committee on
organization was Robert D. Kohn of New
York, a well-known practicing architect,
who spoke before the students of the Col-
lege of Architecture three years ago. On
the committee of organization were repre-
sentatives of the medical, legal, engineer-
ing, educational and other professions.
Some of the topics which have been sug-
gested for discussion by the Conference
were as follows:
A.—Professional Organizations Their
Functions and Inter-relations
(1) The possibilities of co-operation be-
tween the professions for the common good.
(2) Comparison of the ethical standards
of the different professions; in how far
they are socially minded; in how far self-
regarding.
(3) To what extent is the enforcement
of professional standards desirable or prac-
tical?
(4) What is the best type of professional
organization?
(5) Can they be made more democratic?
Should they become professional guilds?
B.—Relation of the Professions to the
Public
(1) How can the idea of the obligation
for public service be extended among the
professions?
(2) Can the enthusiasm of the war-time
service to the government be perpetuated
to any appreciable degree?
(3) How can a better qualified technical
service be secured to the federal, state and
municipal governments?
(4) How can public opinion be directed
to the necessity for this service?
(5) To what extent do the professions
now supply the quality and scope of serv-
ice needed by all classes of society?
(6) How can the professional man get
into right relations with all salary and
wage earners who come under his direc-
tion?
(7) Can the professions represent the
public interest in matters of labor adjust-
ments?
C.—Educational Obligations of the Pro-
fessions
(1) How can education for the profes-
sions be made more real as to the problems
of the day?
(2) Are the men in professional practice
in sufficiently close touch with the technical
educational institutions?
(3) How can the average professional
establishment be made more democratic,
and so advance the education of masters
and men?
(4) What can be done to spread, in the
high schools and colleges, knowledge of the
significance, ideals and functions of the
several professions?
It has been suggested by members of the
volunteer committee on organization that a
national conference organization of the
professions would be mainly effective
through the organization of inter-profes-
sional conference groups in the commun-
ities throughout the country. These local
groups would then be brought together
annually through delegates.
Nearly all the upperclassmen spent the
past summer serving a fraction of the re-
quired period in the practitioners office.
The demand was unprecedented, requests
coming from Kansas in the west and New
Jersey in the east.
A noteworthy exhibition of architectural
drawings was held during the summer
months at the Memorial Hall Gallery. It


305
•consisted chiefly of the current work of
1917-1918 and collectively showed the re-
sults of training and application, from the
most fundamental harmony and proportion
composition to the advanced work of the
post-graduates.
BACK AGAIN
A large number of ex-soldiers, who dur-
ing the war learned the value of an educa-
tion, have returned to Michigan or have
enrolled to begin their work here. The
first influx of returning students occurred
at the opening of the second semester last
year when a number of men from the can-
tonments enrolled for further study. The
opening of the fall semester witnessed the
expected but unprecedented tide of stud-
ents literally swamping the town and Uni-
versity.
The war records of a few of the return-
ing fighters follow:
R. V. Gay '21, entered the army stores
course in November, 1917. He was as-
signed to various ordnance detachments and
did constructural work in the layout of
shops at the Watertown Arsenal.
M. E. Hammond '21, has a service memo
of 18 months at various training camps.
Prior to his discharge he was an instructor
and acting commander of the 53rd Train-
ing Battery, F. A. Training School.
H. J. Bisbee '21, was with Company A,
55th Engineers, A. E. F., stationed at Mon-
tierchaume Chatearaux Inde, working as a
draftsman at construction headquarters.
J. E. Somppi ex-'i8, spent his time, at
the radio school, College Station, Texas.
U. of M. was well represented at this
school.
Edwin M. Reid '19 was an officer in the
air service, photographic station, A. E. F.
G. W. Gill '19, a student at Ohio State
University prior to his service in the A.
E. F., is here to complete his architectural
training.
Ward Davenport ex'21, has returned this
fall after spending more than a year in
ordnance work.
"Bob' Frantz, graduate, has also return-
ed from France and is assisting the teach-
ing staff.
O. F. Stone '19, supervised construction
work at Camp Custer.
Herbert Schmitz '19 touched at Con-
stantinople, Antwerp and Brest while'in the
navy.
H. Batiu '21, was transferred from the
ordnance department to the entertainment
staff and was a member of the band which
introduced jazz in Paris.
Architectural Jury
In June a jury of prominent Detroit
architects graded the design problems of
'20 and '21 class. Regarding this innova-
tion The Michigan Architect &amp; Engineer
states:
"The purpose in having architects help
in this way is to bring about full co-oper-
ation between architectural practitioners
and the school, to give architects an oppor-
tunity to see just what is being accom-
plished and to enable them to make sug-
gestions on the basis of first-hand observa-
tion. By re-casting the juries from time to
time, the students will come in contact
with a fairly large number of architects.
It is proposed to extend the plan some-
what further in having one or more mem-
bers of the jury speak to the students after
the grading has been done, to explain to
them the basis of their decision.
The jury system of marking has been
in vogue at the University of Michigan for
nine years, and has been remarkably satis-
factory, the entire faculty acting as a jury.
Not until now, however, have outside ar-
chitects served on such juries. During these
years, the grading plan has comprised a
point system, whereby students receiving
high grades are enabled to complete their
requirements in design more rapidly than
do students receiving but a passing grade,
the purpose of the plan being .to stimulate
good work. The plan is analagous in prin-
ciple to that in vogue at the Ecole des
Beaux Arts, where the various grades of
"mention" serve the same purpose."
The jury consisted of George D. Mason,
president of the Michigan State Board for
the Registration of Architects; Charles
Kotting, president, Michigan Chapter,


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
American Institute of Architects, and Ed-
ward A. Schilling, president of the Mich-
igan Society of Architects.
Clearing the Way
At a recent meeting of the Michigan
architects a movement was launched to
establish an independent department of
architecture here at Michigan.
Let us quote the Detroit Free Press:
"Edward C. Van Leyden of Detroit, chair-
man of the educational committee of the
Michigan society, won the support of the
120 members of the two organizations pres-
ent when he announced a desire to again
appeal to the regents to separate the de-
partment of architecture from the school of
engineering, of which it is now a part. A
similar effort prior to the war was unsuc-
cessful.
"Architecture belongs to the fine arts,"
Mr. Van Leyen said in his address. "It is
not an adjunct to engineering and should
not be made a branch of scientific educa-
tion. Dentistry and pharmacy have sepa-
rate departments, yet in pharmacy prior to
the war, there were only 52 students, while
in architecture there were 125. Architec-
ture is of sufficient importance to be con-
ducted as an independent school.'
To support his theory Mr. Van Leyen
read letters from 17 noted architects in
various parts of the country, all expressing
views similar to his own."
This change has been advocated for a
number of years but never before with such
an asuring aspect. A new school would be
a boon to every architect. Our accomplish-
ments now bear comparison to highly en-
dowed architectural schools, and although
we have worked two at a drafting table,
never has the solicitious freshman been
turned from our ranks, because the fresh-
men are scattered throughout the drafting
rooms, where the influences of upperclass
environment and criticism are a vast help.
If the support of the various university
faculties is commensurate with the fidelity
manifested ever since we shared the Engi-
neering Arch then the most genuine aid
is forthcoming, the accomplishment of
which will be a joy forever.
Of the class of 1918—Norton is with
Bradfield Mead in Grand Rapids; Sullivan
is in M. R. Burrowes' office, Detroit;
Greenberg is working at Smith, Hinchman
&amp; Grylls; Hamer &amp; Kiefer are at Esseslt-
goin; Murphy at Hannford's; Hertel and
Blumberg at Albert Kahn's; Nugent is
with L. J. Heenan, Pontiac; Hewlett has
an architectural job in Toledo; Kenyon is
on building appraisal work in Detroit; Ku-
ccra is in California; Larke has returned
for post graduate work; Misses Hildner
and Mack, both of whom took special de-
sign, are also engaged in architectural work
in Detroit.
The majority of them come over to see
a game and renew acquaintances occasion-
ally.
The May issue of the Technic will con-
tain a complete and up-to-the-minute list
of many of the old grads, space being in-
sufficient in this number.
An Architectural Number
The Technic has generously offered the
May number to be primarily an architec-
tural undertaking. To this end will be in-
cluded designs and drawings by the stud-
ents, newsy alumni notes, selected editor-
ials, departmental remarks and contribu-
tions by members of the teaching staff. We
earnestly appeal to our patrons and friends
to lend assistance to the Technic and we
especially request the alumni to co-operate
in this venture by forwarding their present
addresses and in general to let us know
"how it's going."
It has been costumary to issue an annual
bulletin of our department to give the
architectural profession and past students
a glimpse of our work, but this year pros-
pects seemed rather dubious due to pecun-
iary circumstances.

When it's late at night
And it's cold
And you're just coming home
And every arc light glares upon your toque
And you've heard the sophs are "out"
And you're alone
And you hear a bunch of great, big fel-
lows coming
And you are certain that they must be
sophs
And you are thinking of ducking
Then, when you see that they are also
"Wearing the gray"
And you all stop for hot coffee,
Gee, ain't it the real Michigan feeling!!
Prof. Running: "My records show that
two "A's" were made in the examination.
One was for absence."
From Chem. 2E blue book: "A normal
solution is a solution that is perfectly nor-
mal in all respects."
A newspaper across the border remarks
that when Canadian bands obtain a good
look at H.R.H. Prince of Wales they play
"God Save the King" with great fervor.
We agree with the student who sadly
quoth, "Everything is going up except my
marks."
The result of Exp. le assures us that it

diers there. One is a Frenchman, the one
over there is English and there's an Ital-
ian. What kind of a fellow is the one by

Second '23E: He isn't a man, because
he's got skirts on. Maybe it's a woman from
the Battalion of Death."
First Frosh: "No, she isn't a woman be-
cause she has a man's appearance."
"" Second Frosh: "Oh, I know. It's a
member of the famous Middlesex regi-

Clerk: "So would I, madame."
Bandit: "Your money or I'll throw you

Victim: "Over the cliff? It's only a
bluff."
Advice—Something we take when no-
body is looking.
Editor of I. W. W. Paper: "Has the ap-
plicant any special qualifications for work?"
"Yes, he was dishonorably discharged
from the U. S. Army."

Company's Research Activities
During the War:
Submarine detection devices
X-ray tube for medical service
Radio telephone and telegraph
Electric welding and applications
Searchlights for the Army
and Navy
Electric furnaces for gun
shrinkage
Magneto insulation for air service
Detonators for submarine mines
Incendiary and smoke bombs
Fixation of nitrogen
Substitutes for materials
The Service of an Electrical
Research Laboratory
The research facilities of the General Electric Company
are an asset of world-wide importance, as recent war
work so clearly demonstrated.
A most interesting story tells of the devices evolved
which substantially aided in solving one of the most
, pressing problems—the submarine menace. The results
attained in radio communication, special X-ray equip-
ment for field hospital service and many other products,
for both combatant and industrial use, did their full
share in securing the victory.
In the G-E laboratories are employed highly trained
physicists, chemists, metallurgists and engineers—ex-
perts of international reputation. These men are work-
ing not only to convert the resources of Nature to be of
Bervice to man, but to increase the usefulness of elec-
tricity in every line of endeavor.
Scientific research works hand in hand with the development
of new devices, more efficient apparatus and process of manu-
facture. It leads to the discovery of better materials, which
ultimately make happier and more livable the life of all mankind.

President-elect Marion LeRov Burton


JOHN R. ALLEN
My first contact with Dr. Marion LeRoy Burton was during his presi-
dency at the University of Minnesota. After having known him intimately
at Minnesota, I can assure the engineering students and alumni of Michi-
gan that the Board of Regents have made a most excellent choice.
He has had just the right kind of training for a college president. In
early life he was obliged to work his way and help support the family after
the death of his father. He worked his way through Carleton College and
later earned his way through Yale University, receiving a Ph.D. degree.
Shortly after graduation he became pastor of the Church of the Pilgrims
made famous by Rev. Dr. Salter Storrs. That he is a brilliant speaker is
assured by the fact that he held so important a position while still a young
man.
During 1910 he travelled abroad and the following year became presi-
dent of Smith College where he remained until 1917. Since that time he has
been president of Minnesota. ,
While at Minnesota I always enjoyed going to see President Burton.
He has none of that ceremonious manner of some college presidents, and
does not try to impress you with the dignity of his office. He appeals to
you as being open-minded, virile, and active. At the same time he is not
austere but is sympathetic and enjoyable. No one can work with him with-
out respecting his judgment and loving his personality.
President Burton has one quality that saves the day in many a trying
circumstance. He has a fine sense of humor and he always sees the funny
side of any situation.
Beside being a good student and a good college president he is a good
athlete and used to play first base on the college team.
As dean of the Engineering College at Minnesota, I found President
Burton in sympathy with engineering matters. His views on professional
training, especially in engineering, were always excellent, and he has a good
knowledge of the engineers's problems.
Above all, he is a Christian gentleman and a true American and is not
afraid to expresss his convictions even under trying circumstances. Presi-
dent Burton gives his own life as an example of the opportunity that is open
to every man in this country if he will avail himself of it.
It is a great satisfaction to feel that Michigan has a new president that
is qualified by personality, education, and experience to be a worthy suc-
cessor to the presidents that have preceded him.


INVESTOR, EMPLOYEE, AND CUSTOMER
A. C. MARSHALL, VICE-PRESIDENT DETROIT EDISON CO.
In talking to the Senior Engineers,
a few weeks ago, no elaborate dis-
cussion of the relations betwen capi-
tal and labor was attempted. On the
contrary, I tried to give a few simple
observations and conclusions, the re-
sult of some years in public utility
work and also called attention to a
third party, the public, and its rights
and relations to both the investor and
the workers. Neither observations nor
conclusions are new, as inevitably,
one's opinions are largely the conscious
or unconscious absorption of the
thoughts of others.
About all there is to managing a
public service corporation is to main-
tain harmonious and equitable rela-
tions between three groups of people;
the stockholders who furnish the
money to establish the business, and
for which they receive dividends; the
employes who contribute their serv-
ices to the company for which they
receive wages; and the customers, or
the public, who buy the service ren-
rendered by the company and pay for
it at properly fixed rates. By stock-
holders I mean to include the holders
of stocks, bonds, notes or any other
form of securties, and by employes I
mean not only common laborers, but
every one from the General Manager
down to the office boys.
The individual make-up of these
groups may be exceedingly mixed. The
stockholders may be both employes
and customers, and the employes are
almost certain to be customers and
may be stockholders, and the custom-
ers may be both stockholders and em-
ployes. Nevertheless as groups, they
are distinct and the interests of each
are distinct.
At first thought, it may appear that
the interests of the three groups are
not only distinct, but antagonistic, but
this is not true. The three groups are
absolutely dependent on one another
and in the absence of any one group
the business cannot exist. There is
no greater fallacy than that dividends
and wages are antagonistic, in the
sense that i f small dividends were paid
the more could be paid in wages, or if
no dividends were paid, wages could
be still higher, or if wages were low-
er, dividends could be higher.
Without dividends there would be
no capital invested, therefore, no bus-
iness to employ labor and therefore
no wages. If inadequate wages were
paid, there would soon be no earn-
ings with which to pay dividends, and
if the rates for service are inequita-
bly adjusted, either too high or too
low, there would soon be no earnings
with which to pay either wages or
dividends. As society is constituted
today, without dividends there would
certainly be no money with which to
pay wages. Whether or not, at some
future time, there may be a society so
constituted that wages without divi-
dends will be possible, is one question
which, thank heaven, the public util-
ity manager does not have to answer.
It is the duty of the public utility
manager to determine what is a fair
return that these three groups should
get out of the operation of such a
business. Take first the stockholders.
What rate of return is proper for
money invested in a public service cor-


poration? There is a difference be-
tween the proper and allowable re-
turn on money invested in a public
utility and that invested in a purely
private business. In almost all cases
of private business, competition may
be relied upon to keep the rate of re-
turn reasonable. A public utility is
usually a monopoly, and not being sub-
ject so much to the restrictions of
competition, there is need for some
kind of regulation. To furnish this
regulation there have arisen many
forms of regulating bodies, nearly all
states now having Public Utility Com-
missions of one form or another. The
control over rate of return on the in-
vestment is through the regulation of
rates for the service.
Courts and Commissions have said
for years that the rate of return on
capital so invested shall be a reason-
able rate, but the difficulty has been to
say what constituted a reasonable
rate. It is plain that a fixed numeri-
cal rate of interest cannot be reason-
able in all cases and opinion has grad-
ually crystallized around this defini-
tion—a reasonable rate of return on
capital invested in a public utility is
that return which will bring into the
business freely and cheerfully, the ad-
ditional money required to carry on
the business. It is as important to
have the capital come cheerfully and
willingly as it is to have cheerful and
willing employes. Please note that
the return shall be neither more nor
less than this amount necessary to
bring the money. It is easy to see
why it cannot be less, and it should not
be more because too large returns tend
to extravagance in management, and
the general lowering of efficiency, and
finally to concealment of profits, with
all the evils incident thereto.
The next consideration is to deter-
mine the fair rate of wages to the
employes. Omitting for later discus-
sion, the various phases of profit shar-
ing, the wage paid to employes
should be the going wage in the com-
munity for corresponding classes of
work, with an endeavor to maintain
the upper limit of the range rather
than the average. In other words,
keep very slightly above the going
wage, rather than take chances of go-
ing below it. This slight margin will
insure the getting of the pick of the
men in any class and will materially
reduce labor turnover. It has been
recently stated in a magazine article
that the employes' share of the pro-
ceeds of any business is all the prof-
its of that business after the invested
capital has received the return which
will insure the bringing of money into
the business. This may or may not
be true. As stated, it ignores the third
party to the deal, the public, or cus-
tomers who buy the output of the bus-
iness. It may be true when the price
of the product is fixed by competition,
but in a natural monopoly, such as a
public utility, it is not a sufficient def-
inition of the employes share to state
that the employes should receive all
the profit after a reasonable return
on the capital. The customer or the
public must be considered.
A public utility is really organized
to serve the public, which brings us to
the third point. What is a fair rate to
the customer or the public for the
service rendered by the company? Is
it no(j the minimum rate which will
bring enough gross earnings to pay
operating expenses, including the
proper wage as defined above, and
have sufficient net earnings left to pay
the fair return on the capital invested.
In operating expenses there must be
included a sufficient allowance for de-
preciation to protect the integrity of


the investment and there should be
sufficient excess in net earnings over
dividends actually paid, to accumulate
a reasonable surplus.
To recapitulate, the matter can '-.e
sumed up as follows: The stockholder
should receive a return on his money
sufficient to induce him not only to
cheerfully allow his money to remain
in the business, but to furnish addi-
tion?! money as the business requires.
The employe should receive a wage
equal to. or slightly greater than the
going wage in the community. The
customer should pay for the service
rendered by the company at the mini-
mum rate that will bring earnings
enough to pay operating expenses, in-
cluding a proper depreciation account,
and leave net earnings enough to pay
a fair return on the capital invested
and to accumulate a small surplus.
This all seems simple enough, but
unfortunately, this is not quite all
there is to it. The additional prob-
lems come from the complex human
relations brought in by the employes.
It is all well enough to say a company
should purchase its labor in the cheap-
est possible market, the same as it
purchases its coal and other supplies
and this is true enough, if we make
proper qualifications. We cannot .get
around the fact, however, that labor
is not a commodity such as coal, but
is the service of human beings and
we cannot ignore the human relations
thereby introduced.
It is the recognition of this fact that
has brought about all those activities
grouped under the somewhat indefi-
nite term "Welfare Work." These
include old age pensions, group insur-
ance, recreation centers, visiting
nurses, free medical service, all kinds
of mutual benefit associations, and the
almost endless varieties of profit shar-
ing schemes. These activities can be
carried out in a way to develop the
worker's individuality, but are liable
to lapse into paternalistic ideas un-
less carefully watched.
The paternalistic attitude assumes
that the company knows more than
its employes about what is good for
the employe, concerning health, hab-
its of living, methods of spending and
saving money, investments and pro-
visions for old age. It is assumed
that while the employe may be enti-
tled to a greater share of the prod-
ucts of industry than he has received
in the past, it is still up to the em-
ployer to say what part he should re-
ceive, and in what form he should
receive it, and what he should do
with it.
The individualistic theory on the
contrary is based on the belief that
the employe should receive his share
of the products of the business to do
'with as he sees fit, and that the so-
called welfare work should be con-
fined to efforts to cultivate self re-
liance, initiative, and independence in
the employe, rather than cultivate a
sense of dependency upon the com-
pany or some other agency to take
care of him in time of trouble, and
provide a living during his old age.
There is no doubt that, in general,
American workmen resent paternal-
istic welfare work, and especially so
if such welfare work is much adver-
tised, as is done by some large cor-
porations. Their position is that they
would much prefer having the money
spent in such welfare work paid to
them in cash in the pay envelope. It
is certainly better that a corporation
should pay a man all that it can af-
ford to pay him, and all that is com-
ing to him for his services, in money,
in his weekly or monthly pay enve-


lope. The employe then feels that his
account with the company is practi-
cally settled every pay day, and that
nothing is being withheld to pay for
possible future benefits that he may
or may not need, and that he may or
may not get.
This plan does not necessarily mean
that the company should not take any
human interest in the employes, or
that all welfare work should be elim-
inated, but it does have a bearing on
the manner in which this interest is
manifested. Consider for a minute
the old shop, before the days of big
corporations, where the boss worked
as one of the men, or. if not, at least
knew personally every employe, his
family history and living conditions.
If there were sickness in an employe's
family, there was personal interest
manifested by the boss, or possibly by
his wife. Food and medical attend-
ance were provided, if necessary, but
all was done as a matter of kindly
human interest and with no public-
ity or advertising of any kind. A big
corporation can do a certain amount
of this work in this same spirit. It
can provide a pay during sick leave,
it can provide medical attendance
where needed, and it can arrange for
a loan of money to employes at a
nominal rate of interest, the loan to
be paid back in very small install-
ments. But it should be done quietly,
and above all things, with no attempt
to make advertising matter of the
employes' necessities. The average
man would rather do without the ben-
efits than to feel the company was
making advertising capital out of its
method of bestowing the benefits.
Profit sharing schemes, the old age
pension and so-called bonus systems
of pay, are some of the most talked
of features of employes' relations
work.
.Many profit sharing schemes tend
to be paternalistic in nature. A com-
pany will agree to divide a certain
amount of money among the employes
at the end of the business year, but
will stipulate that this will not be
paid in cash, but in preferred stock
or bonds, or deposited as a savings
account with the company and in many
cases, this amount is forfeited, if the
employe leaves the company before a
certain number of years. No wonder
the employe resents this. He feels he
has either earned this money or he
has not. If he has earned it ho wants
it without any strings to it.
A pension system providing a life
pension to be paid to the employe up-
on disability or upon retirement after
a certain long period of service, is a
popular feature of welfare work. It
has much to commend it. It is true
that many classes of working people
are naturally careless of the future.
They are happy-go-lucky, spending
money when they have it, with little
thought of the future. On the other
hand, it is doubtful if the cure for
this tendency is to take from their
shoulders and put on the corporation
this care for the unproductive years
of old age. I have heard workmen
discuss old age pensions along this
line; the pension is either a deferred
wage, or it is a charity, something
for nothing. If it is a charity, they
do not want it. They are not asking
for charity. On the other hand, if
it is a deferred wage, something that
they have earned, they want it when
they earn it, and they ask what right
the employer has to defer the payment
of something that they have already
earned.


Bonus systems of pay usually con-
sist of a standard wage for a standard
amount of work or output, and an ad-
ditional amount of pay for additional
output. It is an attempt to secure the
benefit of the old straight piece-work
system without its disadvantages.
None of these bonus schemes have
been entirely satisfactory. Sometimes
a man will earn a big bonus for a
while by a spurt in speed, which he
cannot maintain, then he falls back
to what is for him a more normal
rate of production, with all the bad
mental reactions always resulting
from a decrease in pay, or from a de-
motion of any kind.
As a device to increase production,
at a profit to both workman and the
company, a bonus system looks prom-
ising. It should be possible to work
out a scheme in which the bonus
would be entirely additional to the
regular wage, that should be in itself
adequate and equal to the going wage
in the community. The bonus should
be paid by a separate check and every
effort made to have it appear an en-
tirely different matter from the reg-
ular pay. The worker should be per-
fectly free to earn it, or not, as he
pleases, and if he does not please to
earn it he should still receive a nor-
mal adequate pay. If such a system
could be worked, the increased pro-
duction per man-hour would certainly
be very welcome; because increased
production per man-hour is what the
company and the world needs just
now.
It may be possible, however, that
even as so worked out, this bonus
scheme would be subject to at least
one of the objections pertaining to all
such systems, and that is the difficulty
of maintaining the interest of the em-
ploye. When first put into effect,
great interest is maintained by almost
all the workers, but this interest in-
variably begins to lag and in the
words of the salesman — " the idea
has to be continually resold to the
men." In the words of Professor
Hirshfeld — "the scheme is not self
supporting, psychologically."
I hope you will think of these
things. It's up to you young men to
settle some of these questions in the
next few years. And remember what
President-Elect Burton said at a din-
ner at the Detroit Athletic Club last
Friday night; I cannot quote his
words, but the substance was that
what was needed was a closer union
between the educational leaders and
the conservative labor leaders of this
country to work out these problems.


BENJ. F. BAILEY, PROFESSOR OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
When a young man enters college
he is starting the greatest enterprise
of his life. It is going to cost him
four years of his life and several
thousand dollars of money. He
should have a clear idea of what he
expects in return for the investment.
In the first place I must state most
emphatically that he should not strive
merely to accumulate a large store of
facts. Suppose he succeeds in his en-
deavor and remembers everything he
has been taught in his college course.
Would he be an engineer? Certainly
not. He would a poor imitation of a
hand book. His net cash value would
be about $6.00 provided he would
feed himself. To be of any use in
the world he must have something
more than knowledge.
I believe nearly evryone would ad-
mit that the faculty of a good college
of engineering is a body of learned
men. Yet I pity the faculty if it were
measured by the same yardstick it ap-
plies to the student body. Suppose
the faculty were tomorrow herded to-
gether and compelled to take an ex-
amination in freshman mathematics.
How many do you think would pass?
I know one who would not and yet he
uses his mathematics in his daily
work. Most of us have forgotten
most of our mathematics, and yet we
could not teach if we had not had
mathematics. However, if called up-
on to do so, most of us could in a
week or so put ourselves in a position
to teach mathematics. We know the
broad principles, though we have for-
gotten the details.
Yes, most of us manage to get along
with very few facts stored in our
brains. Tf we want certain informa-
tion we look it up. The handbook
is far more reliable and holds far
more than the finest brain. Yet there
is a certain minimum of information
that the engineer must have at his
finger ends. The amount of this is
small and is probably decreasing.
Fifty years ago the professional man
had to know how to write. Today the
typewriter relieves him of this neces-
sity. A few years ago he was sup-
posed to know how to multiply and
divide. Today he consults his slide
rule or' uses a computing machine.
The machine does what the brain
formerly had to do, and does it far
better.
By now some of my readers are
probably thinking that if they are go-
ing to forget all they have learned
(ultimately sinking to the level of the
faculty) and if an engineer does not
need to know anything anyway, why
are they here at all. Why waste four
years "getting an education"? In ans-
wer I merely ask them to use their
eyes. Compare a group of uneducated
ditch diggers with a group of engi-
neers, or doctors or lawyers. There
is a difference and there is a reason.
Go to the gymnasium and exercise
one arm daily for a year, meanwhile
keeping the other strapped to the side.
Will there be a difference? Does this
suggest the reason?
What is it that the educated engi-
neer has that the uneducated laborer
has not? In my opinion three things,
a small store of facts, the ability to
think and a measure of culture. I
have stated these in the inverse order
of their importance and also in the
order in which they successively be-
come most useful.
The young graduate just starting
his professional career needs to have


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
some facts at his fingers' ends and he
must know how to find other facts he
may need. It is surprising how few
these facts may be. The employer
rarely complains about how little eng-
ineering graduates know. He fre-
quently complains that they can not
think or do not use common sense.
The problems an engineer just
starting his professional work is call-
ed upon to solve are usually of the
riature of the following: "Survey this
plot of land and determine its exact
area." "Make a detail drawing of the
piece marked R in the assembly draw-
ing I am giving you." "Take this
voltmeter down to the cement mill and
observe the voltage variation." "Run
over to the planing mill and see why
their motor will not start." These
problems all call for technical knowl-
edge, although the amount is not
great.
A few years later if all goes well
with our young engineer he will some
day find himself confronted with some
such probem as one of the following.
"Redesign our line of motors so we
can sell at competitive prices and still
make some money." "Revise our
schedule of rates so that they will be
fairer to the public and to ourselves."
"Write a report recommending wheth-
er or not a certain section of track
should be operated by electric or steam
locomotives." If you will examine
these problems you will see that none
of them are of a nature that permits
of an exact answer. There is an ex-
act value to the area of the piece of
land and there is a definite reason
why the motor will not start. The
problem of designing the line of
motors does not admit of a definite
answer. Of course an engineer might
design motors which would not at all
meet the specifications. His "answer"
would be wrong. Another might pro-
duce motors which would have ex-
cellent characteristics but which could
not be built and sold at a profit. A
third engineers might design motors
which were cheap to build but which
would not stand up in practice. The
successful designer would be the one
who could best combine the various
qualities required and produce a
motor good enough to do the work
required of it reasonably well and at
the same time so laid out as to admit
of cheap manufacture.
The problems first stated are typ-
ical of those assigned to engineering
assistants. If a man never progress-
es beyond the handling of such pro-
blems, he had better far have not come
to college. All the technical knowl-
edge required can be readily acquired
in a trade school or correspondence
course or even "picked up" in the
workshop.
The problems stated later are such
as would be assigned to an engineer
who has "arrived." The distinction
between the two classes of works is
similar to that between the work of
an orderly in a hospital and the work
of a physician. If the problems are
carefully read it will be apparent that
no one of them admits of a definite
answer. There is a radical difference
between the assignments, "determine
the stress in this beam" and "design
'a beam to carry this load." The man
just out of college is well qualified to
answer the first. To the second, there
is no one answer. Of course if the
beam fails in service, the answer is
wrong. But it is equally wrong if the
beam is twice as trong as necessary or
if it is made of an unsuitable and
costly material. Between these two
extremes there are an infinite num-
ber of answers and among a great
many of them, no one could say posi-
tively which was the best. To make a
good answer the engineer would have
to take into account a number of fac-


tors among which may be mentioned,
the facilities for manufacturing the
beam, the relative cost of labor and
material, the probable effect of a fail-
ure of the beam, the probability that
the load may be increased in the fut-
ure, the length of time that the beam
will probably be in service, the scrap
value of the beam when it is finally re-
moved, the facilities for transporta-
tion, etc. A great deal might be said
about each of these points, but to con-
sider only the last, if the beam were
to be shipped to a point in the interior
of Mexico it might be necessary to
design it so that it could be built up
of small pieces, each of which could be
transported by a mule and erected in
place.
Enough has been said to show clear-
ly that to design a good beam the eng-
ineer must know a great many things
that are "not in the book." If he has
been alert and observing he will have
acquired this specialized knowledge,
largely without conscious effort. Ob-
viously this information can not be ac-
quired in college. We believe how-
ever that his college training will be
of inestimable help to him in quick-
ening his powers of observation, giv-
ing him some idea of what is essential
and what non-essntial and in develop-
in? his ambition.
But in addition to the "book learn-
ing" he acquired in college and the
specialized knowledge he has picked
up outside, the engineer needs some-
thing else. For lack of a better name
we may call this engineering judg-
ment. He must weigh all the ele-
ments involved and use his judgment
in giving to each its due weight. He
can never know that a certain consid-
eration should have a certain weight,
but the greater his experience; the
more he has thought about these
things; in a word the better an en-
gineer he is, the more likely he is to
judge correctly.
This quality of judgment is largely
what makes a big man in any profes-
sion. The high-priced lawyer does
not know that the course he maps out
is going to win your case, but you pay
his fee because he has the reputation
of frequently judging correctly. On
the other hand mere knowledge is
cheap. We can find the information
in a hand book and almost anybody
can learn and remember it.
Of ocurse there are many other
qualities an engineer must have if he
is to rise in the profession but space
forbids that I should discuss them. I
will only mention honesty, vision, dil-
igence, initiative, application and loy-
alty.
In addition he should have the cul-
ture that comes only from association
with fine people and fine books. For-
tunate indeed is the student who comes
from a cultured and refined home.
Without this background the cultural
courses of the high school and uni-
versity frequently fail to "take." Our
ideal engineer, however, through the
combined efforts of the home and the
school has acquired a certain outlook
upon life which we call culture. We
can hardly define culture, except by
telling what it does for a man. Not
all are affected in the same way. It
enables one to attend a performance
of Hamlet and enjoy it as much as
though it were the latest movie. An-
other can listen to a symphony orches-
tra for an entire evening without long-
ing for jazz. Occasionally one will
be found who can read a Shake-
spearian play with as much enjoy-
ment as the latest "best seller." In
some cases it actually leads to such
openness of mind that a man may
change from one political party to an-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
other or from one religion to another.
Incidentally it takes a big man to ad-
mit that his first opinion was wrong
and that he has changed it.
Unfortunately a dose of culture
does not always take and we some-
times produce an alleged cultured man
who would never speak of a farm
tool but who might mention an agri-
cultural implement; whose conversa-
tion is punctuated with French or
Latin phrases and who is planning to
write a paper upon some subject he
does not understand to inflict upon
some unfortunates who will listen
only that they may have a chance to
get even later.
I think one sign of the cultured man
is that he invariably has some inter-
est outside of his daily work. He may
be a musician or an amateur astron-
omer, or a collector of rare books.
He does these things not to impress
the neighbors, but because he loves to
do them. Perhaps he took up some-
thing of this kind as a duty but be-
fore he knew it a love for the sub-
ject developed and he takes his keen-
est pleasure in the study of his
hobby.
A lack of broad culture is perhaps
the most glaring deficiency of the en-
gineer today. His work is such as
to throw him constantly with other
engineers and he must make a con-
scious effort to keep from becoming
narrow. To the doctor or lawyer or
preacher, the chance to broaden by
contact with other minds comes nat-
urally. Let us not allow the practi-
tioners of these professions to sur-
pass us in breadth of culture. The
"ceiling" of an engineer is too fre-
quently fixed by the fact tltat his out-
look is too narrow to allow him to
step upward to the higher positions
that are awaiting him.
If the faculty has lived up to the
above ideals, the young graduate, un-
less he has understood the reasons un-
derlying his education, is doomed to
some bitter disappointments. He maj
find that he cannot make tracings to
compare with those of the girl next
to him whose education ended with
the grammar school. He may not be
able to locate motor trouble ns well as
the shop trained man who never heard
of conic sections, and the cub machin-
ist may hold him in contempt because
he never heard of a set of "John
blocks." But after a few years of
striving, with some specialized knowl-
edge added to his equipment and with
a great deal more wisdom in his brain,
with his judgment developed and his
brain educated so he can actually
think, our graduate cuts quite a dif-
ferent figure. Some problem arises
and nobody knows the answer. Gas-
oline is disappearing and an engine
must be developed to run on some
substitute. Our factory is losing
money on every motor it builds and
the line must be re-designed or we
must go out of business. To whom
do we turn then? To the expert
tracer? To the capable "trouble
shooter?" Certainly not. We choose
the man with the broadest possible
training, the man who can look at a
subject from every angle, the man
who seeks only the truth, the man
who can think. In a word we get the
best engineer we can find, and we
give him a chance to add to the sum
of human happiness in a degree that
rarely comes to men of other profes-
sions. Then and only then is his col-
lege education justified.


A NEGLECTED OPPORTUNITY
JAS. ROWLAND BIBBINS, '99E
A nation's wealth, prosperity, and
advancement has its roots in creative
genius. Genius and invention arc
synonymous. Invention is the pro-
duct of Research—usually—although
occasionally of accident.
Research, successfully organized
and efficiently administered, is a voca-
tion, not an avocation. It requires
business acumen as well as highly spe-
cialized knowledge. It requires capi-
tal investment in laboratories, for as-
certaining the difference between Fact
and Assumption. It requires keen
intellects, fired with all the romanti-
cism of the truth-seeker—no compro-
misers with Things-as-they-are. It
requires the librarian's patient search
of records, the computor's laborious
collation of data, the scientist's skilled
manipulation of delicate instruments,
the mathematician's incisive penetra-
tion beyond the realm of the proven
Possible, into the uncharted seas of
the supposed Impossible. It requires,
Editor's Note—At this writing it ap-
pears that definite recognition of the
object of this paper has been forth-
coming by a resolution of the Board
of Regents, authorizing the establish-
ment of a Department of Research
practically along lines desired by the
Chicago Alumni. And further, the
Carnegie Corporation has just do-
nated $5,000,000 for the use of the
National Research Council and Na-
tional Academy of Sciences, which
enjoys a federal charter. The Na-
tional Research Council is representa-
tive of some forty scientific and En-
gineering Societies of the country.
too, such mundane things as offices,
clerks, and index and filing systems,
mailing lists, and, unfortunately, fat
bank accounts.
But most of all, successful Research
calls for the component genius of di-
rection and the motive power of in-
dustrial application. Altruism is
beautiful in conception; by itself, it
contributes only very indirectly to the
wealth of nations. And so, without
such organization, millions of man-
hours, unselfish devoted hours of bril-
liant searchers, may be lost between
Time's upper and nether mill-stones—
mixed in with the coarse grist of In-
dustry. Only here and there does the
Miller sieve out the precious findings.
The Golden Mill-Race
In recent years, especially under the
relentless spur of the War-God, Re-
search has been on every tongue in
the honored vocation of Science and
Engineering. We have thrilled with
the strong desire to unleash the pow-
ers of the human mind for Human-
ity's sake—to elevate industry from
grim plodding to proud intelligent
achievements. So we fill bookshelves,
multiply committees, duplicate ef-
forts, soar to dizzy heights of enthu-
siasm, and then volplane back to solid
earth—our motive power exhausted.
The futility of forced altruism is
again demonstrated.
Meanwhile, Industry plods on, ex-
tracting its sorry mite from the pound
of mute coal, running its golden
stream of by-products back to the
earth whence they came, oblivious of
the unseen riches beneath its feet.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
But Industry is not blind nor sodden
with the precedents of centuries. It
is simply groping. It jumps at Lead-
ership and Invention. In a trice, it
casts out the Imperfect for the Per-
fect—when Invention yields its
treasures in tangible form.
The Vicious Circle
Efficiency, Reconstruction are high-
sounding, breath-taking phrases. They
smack of a new order of things, and
organizations of infinite variety flour-
ish for the accomplishment of these
desiderata, with what pitifully inade-
quate results. World-orders change;
nations vanish over-night. Yet, ere
political warfare ceases, economic
'warfare stealthily creeps in. Pres-
ently, Cupidity, the old miser, is again
at work. Labor troubles multiply;
new price-horizons ensue; the pur-
chasing power of labor falls; then—
more labor troubles. Tariff walls are
erected; the nation insulates itself
upon fictitious economic levels and
sooner or later the bubble bursts, for
again the vicious cycle is complete.
Wanted—Men
Now, being back on solid ground
again, let us recognize that Industry
as well as Agriculture, has its techni-
cal problems. These problems can
only be solved by Research. The En-
gineering Scientist is the man to fer-
ret out the mysteries, to increase the
efficiency, to do the reconstruction.
The industries want MEN. They al-
ready have the MONEY in abun-
dance. Their executives are keen in
search of improved materials, meth-
ods, processes. If successful, the
product instantly becomes better and
cheaper. Many of the larger indus-
tries alone are spending millions for
Research of such a character as adap-
ted to their essentially commercial un-
dertakings. But this is not sufficient;
the need is more far-reaching, for the
tremendous urge of production is too
great. And what of the lesser indus-
tries? They have not the means or
ability to maintain expensive research
laboratories, nor perhaps the vision to
see the need of them, although it is
these very industries that are most in
need of encouragement.
Where, then, may we find a solu-
tion of this modern problem—Re-
search?
The answer seems to the writer to
rest largely with that agency that will
produce MEN—men of vision, abil-
ity and perspective. These men are
produced at the seats of learning—
and nowhere else (with occasional
brilliant exceptions). These institu-
tions of learning are creatures of the
State—and of the Nation. Their
academic influence is admittedly na-
tion-wide. They are usually sup-
ported by the State and indirectly,
through taxation, by the industries.
Yet for some reason, the impression
of academic limitations still prevails
generally in Industry, although this is
being gradually broken down by the
splendid work of unselfish pioneers in
technical learning who have* given o;
themselves to obliterate the unfortu-
nate impression.
The Croivnjxg Need
Shall this situation continue—a
great State to whom we owe alle-
giance, proud of its seat of learning,
which has given millicns of its treas-
ure for the benefit of Agriculture,
but not one cent for Industry—for its
development, the perfection ot its pro-
cesses, its creative ability? Is this
true Efficiency, Reconstruction? Does
it reflect credit upon the consistency
of a people professing the conserva-
tion of natural resources? Medical


li
research has already achieved world-
wide recognition, and justly. Millions
are poured into educational "Founda-
tions." Why not a Foundation for
Industrial Research? The late war is
called an engineers' war; what pro-,
portion of our 110,000,000 of people
understand the enormous contribu-
tions of developmental research in
the fortuitous result?
Concretely, then, what can engi-
neers do to secure recognition, estab-
lishment and support of a broad, na-
tion-wide "Foundation" for. Indus-
trial Research?
To the writer the solution has for-
mulated itself as a result of the valu-
able research work already accom-
plished with exceedingly limited facil-
ities:
1st. Organize the State institu-
tions for Advanced Research.
2nd. Endow their laboratories lib-
erally for special work in particular
fields suited to the needs of the Dis-
trict.
3rd. Co-ordinate these State lab-
oratories under efficient National
guidance.
4th. Encourage the Association of
industries in properly endowing this
work of observation.
5th. Secure the recognition of
Congress and its support in paving
the way, at least, for nation-wide re-
search in state units.
6th. Organized and unremitting
publicity.
As a step toward this object, the
engineering graduates of Michigan,
under the leadership of the Chicago
Association, memorialized the Regents
of the University of Michigan in
Tune, 1916, recommending the estab-
lishment of a separate Department of
Technical Research, extending on a
much broader scale the excellent work
already done in its various laborato-
ries on Marine Technology, High-
ways and Sanitation, etc. This memo-
rial pointed out the unfortunate fact
that Michigan had no scholarship nor
honoraria established by the institu-
tion itself for higher technical re-
search. Yet the institution has achiev-
ed the position of largest attendance
of all state institutions of the coun-
try (barring Agricultural Depart-
ments). Fortunately the situation is
changing and plans are being devised
by the Regents for establishing closer
association with the industries in or-
ganizing a Research Department. It
now rests largely upon Industry to
recognize this important step by suit-
able endowments.
The State of Illinois has already
taken this action and the work of the
experiment station has grown to such
an extent as to justify the equipment
of a separate laboratory for such spe-
cial industries as Ceramics. The work
of other laboratories, such as research
in Concrete Usage at Lewis Institute,
Gas Engineering at Armour lsntitute,
Railroad Technology at Purdue and
Illinois, Aerodynamics at Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology, Hy-
draulics at Cornell and Mining and
Metallurgy at Pittsburgh — all should
lend weight and momentum to
a movement which the engineering
fraternity should carry to the very
gates of Congress, as a body, not in-
dividually. In the last Congress, bills
were presented for promoting and fi-
nancing nation-wide industrial Re-
search in a limited way. These bills
or others more suited to the needs
should be revived in the next Con-
gress and pressed to passage after
suitable revision to incorporate ap-
proved methods of administration of
the enterprise.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Turning Swords Into Plough-
sharks
And finally, the engineering frater-
nity, both local and national, should
undertake a campaign of publicity —
dignified propaganda—directed es-
pecially towaids the Industries and
the Legislatures, with the specific ob-
ject of forging a closer bond of mu-
tual service and understanding, in
which the seats of learning shall be
encouraged to turn their academic
swords into ploughshares. Under this
"entente cordiale," the business ex-
ecutive with vision will turn instinct-
ively to the laboratory for the solu-
tion of his problems and to its train-
ed investigators for his future staff,
and in return contribute handsomely
to its permanent endowment.
Picture such a nation-wide system
of local laboratories, all serving the
special needs of their State or Dis-
trict, also pursuing other investiga-
tions of broader interest, but all fed-
erated into one great National Foun-
dation efficiently co-ordinated under
a budget system, to attain maximum
collective efficiency. Here would be
the measure of the Engineers' great-
est contribution to real Reconstruc-
tion, not of the moment but for all
time. It will take careful, unselfish or-
ganization, a full-time staff, and mil-
lions, also a national campaign for
recognition, which could well be un-
dertaken by the National Engineering
Societies. Then and then only will
real results follow in the form of
suitable endowments and action. Who
would dare today to deplore the in-
vestment in the development of the
steam turbine, the gas engine, the
mechanical stoker, the auto-truck, the
depth-bomb, the by-product coke
oven, the tungsten filament, the wire-
less telephone, alloy steels, concrete
reinforcement, etc., etc.—'yet they have
all come within the century. Such in-
deed is also the promise of the fu-
ture. Men of vision plan ahead of
time, like wise nations. To the Engi-
neer-Scientist, Research offers the
golden opportunity of service to his
profession and to the Nation.

New University Hospital Under Construction


BRIDGE
W. F. DAVIDSON, '13E
In connection with the construction
and equipment of the great army can-
tonments built during 1917 and 1918,
there were many new and unusual
problems. One of these problems led
to the construction of a suspension
bridge and seems to afford enough in-
terest to merit a description.
Camp Sherman, Ohio, is situated
on the west bank of the Scioto River
about two miles north of Chillicothe
where the only bridges for several
miles are located. When it became
necessary to construct a rifle range,
preliminary reconnaisance soon show-
ed that the only suitable site was east
of the river and aproximately three
miles from the camp. But by the
nearest available river-crossing the
distance was nearly six miles. As a
first solution, the Division Engineer
ordered each of the six engineer com-
panies to construct a bridge. The
work was to afford special training
and was carried on in connection with
routine drill with little regard for
speed. Yet in ten days five compa-
nies had each completed a pile or tres-
tle-bent bridge and the sixth company
had opened a pontoon.
The pontoon was of somewhat nov-
el construction. No regular boat
equipage was available, but one of the
officers observed that there were nu-
merous empty barrels about the camp
—and barrels float. With true engi-
neer instinct he soon had his men at
work. Parties were sent out to lo-
cate materials and others followed at
once with wagons to collect these. At
the site details were at work con-
structing racks, each to hold three
barrels placed end to end. As rapidly
as these were completed, they were
launched and rafted into position and
held by anchors of large stones. The
floor was laid as the work progressed.
For stringers, 2"x6"xi2'-o" pine
was used, and for flooring, scrap lum-
ber picked up around camp. The en-
tire bridge, 310 feet long, was com-
pleted, except for a hand rail, in less
than an hour's working time.
All familiar with the eccentricities
of southern Ohio streams knew full
well that these bridges would be
washed away with the first flood or
movement of ice, although the pon-
toon might be saved by timely re-
moval. Accordingly, the driver was
assigned the duty of reporting on pos-
sible high level bridges. It was evi-
dent at once that a suspension bridge
offered the only hope of solution. The
available sites afforded little choice
and differed principally as to width of
crossing. In making the final selec-
tion, the deciding factors were a min:
imum width and a maximum of pro-
tection against erosion near piers and
abutments. An idea of the cross-sec-
tion of the stream at this point may
be gained from the drawings. Avail-
able data showed that high water
stages about 25 feet above normal
were to be expected. One flood had
reached such height that the high
west bank had been flooded, but this
was largely due to a constriction of
the channel two miles down stream
by a railway embankment, since re-
placed by a trestle. On account of


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the relatively low east bank, and to
make the towers as low as possible,
a grade for the bridge floor was chos-
en 27 feet above low water. This
placed the west abutment on the face
of the steep bank, but as only foot
troops were to be considered, it did
not involve any serious difficulties in
construction of an approach. Further,
it greatly simplified the necessary
tower construction on this side. On
the east side of the river there is a
ridge separating the present stream
bed from an older portion slightly
location of the towers thus deter-
mined, the more detailed design was
undertaken. As an electrical engi-
neer the writer had not had experi-
ence with this type of bridge design,
but transmission line problems pre-
sent many of the same characteristics.
To secure minimum height of towers
and maximum resistance to distortion,
it was desirable that the deflection of
the cables be made as small as pos-
sible. On the other hand, stresses in
the cables increased very rapidly with
decrease in the deflection. Inquiry at
Barrkl Pontoon
more to the east. This ridge afforded
the only possible site for the east
tower, as the span of 550 feet, which
would have been necessary with the
tower on the higher east bank, would
have proved prohibitive. However,
as intimated above, numerous large
sycamores in all of this low land gave
considerable protection against ero-
sion. Still further assurance of pro-
tection came from the fact that this
low ground was on the inside of a
bend in the stream, and consequently
not exposed to its full force.
With the height of roadway and
several warehouses showed that 1300
feet of 2% inch plough steel cable
was available. The cable had been
used but our investigator reported it
in good condition. There was little
prospect of getting anything better,
and the design was developed on the
assumption that these cables would be
used. This set the deflection at i-i4th
of the span and thus determined the
required tower heights. The use of
camber to strengthen the roadway
was given up because of the resultant
increased tower height. No serious
difficulties were encountered in the


17
tower design. The height, area of
base, load, and sections of the main
members were specified. The other
details were worked out as the work
progressed. As shown by the pho-
tographs, the main members were un-
hewn sycamores cut near the site; the
bracing was principally 4x10 inch
The design of the roadway was of
necessity largely empirical and de-
pendent upon individual judgment. Of
first importance was the requirement
that it should be of minimum weight
in order to increase the rather small
preliminary factor of safety assumed
for the cables. In the second place,

fir. Bolts, lag screws, dowels, ship
spikes, and sixty-penny nails were
used for fastenings; each according
as it was available. Work on these
towers progressed very slowly for it

dle of an exceptionally cold winter.
it must be stiff enough to reduce de-
flections under non-uniform loading
to reasonable figures, and it must af-
ford the requisite lateral bracing. Fi-
nally, the design must be such that
only the simplest materials would be
required and assembly could be made
by inexperienced men.
To take up these points in order:


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
To reduce the weight, it was decided
at once that the floor should be of
two inch pine, generally of planks
ten inches wide spaced one inch
apart. This resulted in a minimum
dead weight of this element and gave
some assurance that the snow and ice
load would never become excessive.
East Tower and Approach
Further than this it was not possible
to do more than keep sections as
small as possible with the factors of
safety used in military bridges. The
problem of determining the stresses
incident to distortion was impossible
of accurate solution. A loading of
"infantry in column of two's'' or 125
pounds per linear foot had been speci-
fied. It required only a short study
to show that the stresses in any struc-
ture limiting the distortion to one foot
under the most severe cases of une-
qual loading were far greater than
could be carried by any type of stiff-
ening girder which could be construc-
ted within the limiting conditions of
materials and weights. The basis of
design was accordingly modified to
call for that structure which would
give a minimum of distortion with
out stressing any member beyond its
elastic limit. Various methods of in-
terlacing and latticing the suspension
between the main cables and the floor
system were considered, but all seem-
ed too elaborate to give much prom-
ise of success and they were aban-
doned. A truss of rectangular pan-
els writh wire diagonals was finally
chosen as offering the greatest possi-
bilities. Details of the design as de-
veloped are shown in the drawings.
It will be noted that the members are
all two inch by six inch pine, spiked
together. The floor stringers and top
chord of the truss were made as
nearly continuous as possible by us-
ing fourteen foot lengths which pro-
vided lap joints two feet long. The
spring of the wire diagonals was re-
lied upon to furnish the necessary re-
silience.
The provisions for erection may be
of some interest. All parts were cut
to size in jigs improvised as the work
progressed. Hand saws were used
where gains were to be cut, but for all
other sawing a cross-cut, two-man saw
was used and as many as ten pieces
cut at one time. The floor beams and
their spacers were assembled in jigs
and securely nailed to secure uniform-
ity.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Work thus far had been carried on
during the middle of the winter and it
was not until March that an attempt
was made to construct the anchor-
ages. On the west bank a pit was dug
twelve feet deep and an anchor log
of elm twenty-four feet long and
Details of Suspension
about three feet in diameter at the
butt placed in it and embedded in ap-
proximately five xubic yards of con-
crete held together with chicken wire
and a grillage of poles. Lengths of
cable sufficient to reach to the turn-
buckles were placed about the log
prior to the concreting. On the oppo-
site side of the river conditions were
less favorable. The soil contained a
considerable amount of clay which
froze whenever the work was halted
over night. Several- hundred pounds
of dynamite were used with varying
success. The nature of the soil as
disclosed led to a change of plans for
the anchorage and the final construc-
tion involved two twenty-four foot
logs placed in parallel pits forty feet
apart. The main cables were fasten-
ed to upright posts placed in the first
pit, and these posts in turn were held
at the foot by the horizontal anchor
log and at the top by cables extend-
ing to the second pit. A large grill-
age of four inch poles helped to dis-
tribute the load.
By the time the anchorage; were
complete, the river had reached such
a stage that the swift current and de-
bris made it impossible to get a line
across for hauling the main cables.
Something had to be done. A piece
of four-inch pipe four feet long was
secured from a scrap heap, and a tight
fitting wooden plug driven in for a
foot. At the end of this plug a quar-
ter inch hole was drilled to take a
fuse. The mortar was next clamped
to a stump on the west bank and ad-
justed to an elevation of 450. A
charge of six ounces of black powder
was placed and the "rocket" inserted.
This rocket was a piece of oak two
and a half feet long and having a free
sliding fit within the pipe. The line—
600 feet of marline—was attached to
the rocket, the fuse placed and lighted.
The result was startling. The rock-
et went hurtling through the air and
landed in a field far across the river
—and the marline remained, unable to
follow so precipitous a flight. The
second trial met with full succcess.
Only four ounces of powder were
used and a cushioning air space two


21
inches long was left at the base of the
rocket. The line was carried freely
from its coil to a point near the base
of the large tower.
When the main cables arrived they
proved to be 1*4 inch instead of 2lA
inch as reported and their condition
was problematical. Two lengths of
i% mch new cable—the only size
available—were ordered at once and
preparations made to test the old ca-
ble. To do this it was placed and
pulled as tight as available tackle
would permit. Temporary shortening
slings were placed in the ends. A
heavy block and tackle was attached
at the center of the span with pro-
vision for manipulating it from the
shore. A scale beam forty feet long
of eight inch square timber was at-
tached at its center to the lower block.
At a point three feet from the center
six drift logs were attached by means
of steel cables, while on the oppo-
site end of the beam were hung sand
bags of predetermined weight. Com-
putations had been made to determine
the deflection at the center and the
necessary load to stress the cables to
twice normal working value. Load
was then applied until the beam was
horizontal and the deflection checked
by observations with a transit. While
the cables carried the load, it was evi-
dent that they had very little reserve
capacity.
The next step was to place the ca-
bles at the proper height. Relatively
short turn buckles made it essential
that the necessary adjustment of
length be completed before load was
applied. This involved an interesting
study of the length of the free cable
from one anchorage to the other, the
alongation under load, and the dip of
the free cable. The non-symmetrical
arrangement of supporting towers
added to the complications. It may
be noted that with the bridge com-
plete, the lengths were such that the
turn buckles were all close to the
center of their travel.
With two main cables in place,
erection of the roadway was begun.
Roadway and West Abutmicnt
A detail of about twenty men started
from the east tower and two hours
later a similar detail commenced work
from the west abutment. A platform
two feet and a half wide was placed
on top of the main cables with lines
so that it could be moved forward as
required. Two men worked here
attaching the slings, previously cut to

length and attached to eye bolts, at
ten foot intervals. The lower ends
of the slings would then be pulled
over the completed section and the
floor beam and stirrup attached. Next
the stringers were placed and secured
with temporary lashings, the beam
swung into place and the trailing ends
of the stringers locked into position
as determined by the notches cut in
them. The joints in the stringers were
secured with one nail in each and a
temporary floor of loose planks laid,
when the process was repeated. It
will be noted that the hand ail was
not placed and that only temporary
nailing was used at the stringer joints.
This was necessitated by the extreme
distortion—nearly eight feet at one
time—with the unequal loadings in-
cident to erection. Seven hours af-
ter starting the assembly the roadway
had been laid. It was a source of
some gratification to have the string-
ers fit to within four inches.
Before it was thought advisable to
increase the loading by the addition
of the hand rail and complete floor
planking, the second set of cables
was put in place and the slings con-
nected about both cables. The placing
of the remaining parts, including up
and down stream guys to prevent side
sway was soon completed.
The behavior of the bridge under
load was very interesting. It was
found that infantry could move eas-
ily in column of files, but the ten-
dency to vibrate was rather too great
with column of twos. Two months
use of the bridge developed some
weak diagonal members and these
were replaced. A last inspection
made in July 1919—fourteen months
after opening the bridge—showed
one broken hand rail and about ten
badly pulled diagonals. This was not
surprising, however, since the bridge
had received no care since the depart-
ure of its builders for France.

H. H. HIGBIE, PROFESSOR OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING*
Everyone who follows current
events in public affairs, business and
industry, through newspapers or spe-
cialized journals, recognizes the fact
that we have industrial problems
which are large, important, and press-
ing urgently for solution at the pres-
ent time. The engineer is not lacking
in his appreciation of the existence of
these problems and the necessity for
prompt equitable solution of them,
but quite generally he is not sensible
of his large share of responsibility for
the very existence of such problems,
of his special fitness to engage in
them, and of his great opportunity to
do public service through working
them out. This writing is undertaken
with a view to emphasizing these ideas
of responsibility, of special qualifica-
tions, of opportunities for distin-
guished and timely service of engi-
neers to society; the writer disclaims
any apparent pretence to speaking
about these problems and services as
authority or even as expert in the
field of what has been called "indus-
trial engineering''—he speaks merely
as a qualified observer and student of
engineering affairs in the interest of a
broader and more human participation
of engineers in the large problems of
today and the near future.
It should help us to face our prob-
lems and opportunities if, at the out-
set, we could reach a clear understand-
ing and appreciation of the degree to
which the engineer has been respon-
sible for the development of the mod-

ing Society at Lansing, Mich., January 29,

ern industrial organization, and for
the dangers with which society is
threatened on account of it. A lit-
tle reflection on industrial and eco-
nomic history indicates that engineer-
ing works (whether those of self-
styled engineers or of inventors
whose nominal vocation was some-
thing else, it matters not) have pro-
vided both the incentives and the op-
portunity for unrest among those who
labor in industry, if not the very ne-
cessities of reform which must be sat-
isfied before we may have true inter-
nal peace and lasting democracy.
The invention of power machinery,
of engines for transforming large
quantities of energy and placing it in
concenerated form under easy control,
and of automatic machines to do the
work of many human hands, result-
ed gradually in specializing and nar-
rowing the labor and abilities of the
ordinary man. Formerly, the job was
an art wherein difficult manipulation
of the hands and a more or less intri-
cate technique made it necessary for
each worker to serve a long period as
apprentice and journeyman before he
could be called a master workman;
now it has become an easy and irk-
some task of repeating endlessly in
rapid succession a few stuntifying
mental or manual operations, or of
playing nurse to a senseless and mean-
ingless machine. Formerly the work-
men personally followed his task
through all stages from raw material
to finished product, and conceived
thereby an affection for his job and a
pride in it; now he works merely on
a small part of the complete product,
he works in a standardized fashion
from rigid specifications, and usually


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
no attempt is made to give him a
vision of his place in the scheme of
things, so that the joys of initiative
and achievement are cut out of his
industrial life, his ambitions are
dwarfed, and his job comes to mean
to him merely a livelihood, a game
wherein his object is to get as much
and give as little as possible.
Formerly, the product was created
in limited quantity by a small organi-
zation, the less experienced workers
operating under the personal obser-
vation and direction of the master,
usually living in his neighborhood and
often in his home with his family;
now the almost infinite specializa-
tion and ramification of tasks and
machines has made it necessary to or-
ganize for economical production
through large aggregation of capital
and workers, with an intermediate
class of managers who are neither of
the workmen nor of the masters and
who often serve to keep these two
apart. Thus the control of the indus-
try is likely to be impersonal and un-
sympathetic, while the worker lacks
the motive of loyalty to the organi-
zation and works entirely for selfish
ends. The employer has come to look
upon the employee as a commodity to
be bought or sold according to its
market value, or as a machine to be
valued merely according to its effi-
ciency, and scrapped when worn out
or obsolete. The employee, as resent-
ful for inhumanity as appreciative of
generosity, has acquired through years
of such misapprehension and unrea-
sonable but deep-seated feeling of an-
tagonism to the co-ordinate arm of
production which he delights to ana-
thematize as "Capital." Thus, he
great public finds its interests and wel-
fare subordinated, through our pres-
ent forms of social, industrial and po-
litical organization, to a guerilla war-
fare between factions of a small mi-
nority of the population, which right-
fully should be partners working with
mutual respect in friendly co-opera-
tion.
The engineer's work has had more
far-reaching result than this, however.
His inventions and discoveries, his
applications of scientific methods to
useful ends, have resulted in tremen-
dous production and cheapening not
only of the bare necessities of life,
but also of the luxuries. Today there
is an automobile in use for each twen-
ty of our population, whereas in 1906
the ratio was only one to each two
thousand of population, approximate-
ly; or, the pleasure automobile is at
least ten times as common today as it
was thirteen years ago. So it is the
same with pianos and talking ma-
chines, with books and magazines,
with pictures and amusements, with
myriad conveniences and pleasures
which once were unknown or were
beyond the hopes of a vast major-
ity of the people, but which now are
sought and expected to be possessed
as a matter of course by even the
humblest laborer who is at all sus-
ceptible to their natural appeal, or to
envy, or to clever advertising. The
social significance of this is tremen-
dous. People have had developed in
them so many new and costly wants,
through business enterprise founded
on engineering achievements, that they
are moved to demand an ever in-
creasing share in the product of their
labors to provide the means to sat-
isfy these wants. In some conspicu-
ous cases people have claimed and at-
tempted to seize actually more than
they produced, with resultant des-
truction of industry, and of democrat-
ic government. In all cases people


25
have become restless and dissatisfied,
ready for any innovation, good or bad,
which may enable them to satisfy
these wants that have been created
through the work of the engineer, and
consequently society and governments
are in a state of uncertainty and
change.
Along with the development of a
great volume of wants in multitudes
of people who did not feel them be-
fore, has come the creation of a large
amount of leisure time for the indi-
vidual, wherein he is able to reflect
upon his condition and the real or fan-
cied wrongs inflicted upon him by the
existing social, industrial or political
order, as well as to enjoy the satisfac-
tion of those wants for which he is
able to win sustenance. This leisure
time results from the tremendous in-
crease in productivity of the individ-
ual brought about through ingenious
machines and engineering methods.
In the times when a working day oc-
cupied man's muscles for twelve to
fifteen hours he had much less lei-
sure, ambition, enterprise and surplus
energy than he has today after his
working period of six to nine hours
is ended; too often this leisure is
wasted or employed in destructive ac-
tivities, whereas if the working man
could be induced generally to employ
it in educating himself toward enjoy-
ment of higher pleasures of life or
productive 'activities outside of his
regular job, the potential advantage
to mankind could hardly be imagined.
We have then, a multitude of social,
industrial, and political problems
which are traceable more or less di-
rectly to the well-meant efforts of en-
gineers. It should naturally occur to
us to consider not only whether engi-
neers have a special duty to attempt
solution of these problems, but also
whether engineers have aptitude and
knowledge which mark them as men
specially qualified to work on such
problems. In this connection, it is in-
teresting to note statements, by the
venerable president of Harvard Uni-
versity. Doctor Charles W. Eliot, in
addressing the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers at Boston in
1919, as follows:
"We look forward with a great deal
of assurance to the future great ser-
viceableness of the profession which
you gentlemen represent, and we wel-
come the great benefits to man which
the service of this profession will ren-
der. It used to be considered a ma-
terialistic profession, but I do not
know that there is any profession
which involves a broader or more
constant use of human imagination,
and also the broader use of what we
may call truthfulness of mind, rever-
ence for truth, obedience to truth and
reliance on truth, for the civilization
and advancement of the human race."
No less inspiring is the call to duty
sounded as far back as 1882 by Doctor
Robert H. Thurston, the first presi-
dent of the American Society of Me-
chanical Engineers, as follows:
"In singular and discreditable con-
trast with all the gains in recent and
current practice in engineering, stands
one feature of our work which has
more importance to us and to the
world and which has a more direct
and controlling influence upon the
material prosperity and happiness of
the nation than any modern invention
or than any discovery of science. I
refer to the relation of the employers
to the working classes and to the mu-
tual interest of labor and capital. It
is from us, if from any body of men,
that the world should expect a com-
plete and satisfactory practical solu-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tion of the so-called "labor problem."
More is expected of us than even of
our legislators. And how little has
been accomplished."
At is annual meeting on December
4th, 1919, the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers adopted a dec-
laration of principles in regard to in-
dustrial conditions, from which the
following statements are abstracted:
"Social and industrial unrest result
from the fact that human relations
have not kept step with economic evo-
lution. Competent directive manage-
ment of essential enterprises is the
logical solution. Such management
must be free from autocratic control,
whether by capital or labor. . . .Pro-
ductivity and public service are ab-
solutely essential. On account of the
peculiarly intimate familiarity of en-
gineers with industrial problems, our
responsibility is great."
The influence which engineers may
exert in industry is indicated clearly
in a close parallelism between the Dec-
laration of Principles above men-
tioned, and the "Bill of Rights"
which emanated about a week later
from a conference in Washington of
labor leaders representing one hun-
dred nineteen national and interna-
tional unions including the lour rail-
road brotherhoods. This Bill of
Rights included the following direct
appeal from labor organizations to
engineers: "To promote further the
production of the adequate supply of
the world's needs for use in the
standards of life, we urge that there
be established co-operation between
scientists of industry and the repre-
sentatives of organized workers."
The personal qualities which the
engineer may bring to bear upon the
solution of our industrial problems
are thus recognized as being most
substantial and powerful. He is in-
terested and trained, from the very
beginning in discovering and applying
in the best conceivable fashion the
fundamental truths of nature, and not
in producing results based merely on
precedents or formulas, or tolerance
of makeshifts; he is analytical, train-
ed in observation and sound reason-
ing, in seeking to understand the law
for the purpose of abiding by it; his
aims and methods are constructive,
if not conservative, or conventional;
he is accustomed to seek and to use
knowledge and power economically
in the service of others, not selfishly
or autocratically; he is a practical
idealist—a man of action, who is nev-
er satisfied with things as they are,
but is perpetually dreaming of some
things better while making his
dreams come true.
Although many of the develop-
ments in modern industrial organiza-
tion, equipment and methods which
have been aimed to improve the con-
ditions and product of labor are trace-
able to men of engineering mind (who
often designate themselves "indus-
trial engineers"), it must be confessed
that the great majority of engineers
have neglected this opportunity and
have limited seriously the service
which they are so well qualified by
nature and training to render, by con-
centrating their interest and effort
upon the technology of their profes-
sion to the exclusion of its human re-
lations. Recognition of this defect,
and of the probability that it is due
in large measure to faulty training of
engineers, is the last milestone so far
passed in progress of engineering sci-
ence and education. Engineers gen-
erally have already begun to interest
themselves and to engage effectively
in public affairs and extra-profession-


27
al services; engineering colleges are
revising their curricula in the direc-
tion away from premature speciali-
zation toward a much broader and less
technical fundamental education; con-
sequently we may hope to find engi-
neers, a generation hence, occupying
a much more influential and highly re-
garded place among the profession and
in public affairs than they have been
accorded in the past.
So truly has modern industry grown
out of engineering achievements, that
there is hardly any branch of indus-
trial work in which an engineer can-
not qualify for service much more ef-
fectively than a man without engi-
neering training, other things being
equal. Thus, we find engineers con-
cerned with production, with the per-
sonnel and organization of manage-
ment, with the selection, instruction,
control and supervision of labor, with
the layout and construction of indus-
trial buildings, with the design, instal-
lation and arrangement of equipment
and facilities for production. We
find engineers concerned with econom-
ics of operation, with generation, con-
trol and distribution of power supply
to factories, with systems for record-
ing and analysing the use of time, ma •
terials and energy, with reduction of
useless motion and fatigue. It is es-
timated, for instance, that even su-
perficial work in elimination of fa-
tigue should yield a saving of two
billion dollars per year in the United
States.
We find engineers employed in care
of the health and safety of the work-
ers, in framing and executing laws
to reduce hazards and to mitigate the
effects of injuries and occupational
diseases, — building codes, lighting
codes and safety codes of laws and or-
dinances. This subject has become so
broad and important that we actually
have specialists in "safety engineer-
ing;" it has been estimated that the
"safety first" movement during the
last ten years has reduced the number
of fatal accidents in the United
States from 35,000 to 22,000, with
corresponding reduction of the
amount of maiming and disabling.
Engineers are found engaged in
studying and devising plans for pay-
ment of wages and division of the
profits of industry, in testing, distrib-
uting, advertising and selling the pro-
duct, in specifying and purchasing
materials; industrial executives are
adopting the methods of engineers
and engineers are becoming industrial
executives.
These activities are all ably sum-
marized by Mr. C. B. Going as fol-
lows: "Industrial engineering is the
formulated science of management.
It directs the efficient conduct of man-
ufacturing, construction, transporta-
tion, or even commercial enterprises
of any undertaking, indeed, in which
human labor is directed to accom-
plishing any kind of work."
From the foregoing it may be evi-
dent that in the future the problems
of the engineer should involve hu-
man factors, whereas in the past the
engineer has concerned himself gen-
erally if not exclusively with physical
problems—problems of forces and
materials. The engineer in industry,
certainly, must take account of the
mental and moral laws which govern
the human agencies who execute his
plans as well as of the physical, chem-
ical, and mathematical laws which con-
trol the materials and the insensate
energies with which he must work.
The engineers' work has always been
directed to improve the condition of
living through applications of science


THE MICHIGAN TECHMC
and use of natural laws; but now
through his neglect to take account of
the psychology of workmen, all his
accomplishments bid fair to be nulli-
fied through self limited production of
workers, through discontent, strikes,
and sabotage which are more or less
directly traceable to neglect of the
human factors of industry, to the
weaknessess and ambitions of the hu-
man machine and tools.
In whatever work the engineer may
be engaged, whether industry, or pub-
lic work or private constructive en-
terprise,he is usually the connecting
link between "capital and labor"—he
is the respected adviser who guides
the expenditure of the first as well as
the efforts of the second. His mo-
tives are generally conceded to be un-
selfish, he is accustomed to consider-
ing himself the servant of other peo-
ple rather than of his own fortunes.
He has the trained intelligence and
the innate respect for verities which
are essential to correct and lasting so-
lution of the difficult relation of capi-
tal and labor which perplex the whole
of society almost as much as they af-
fect industry. It is distinctly the duty
of engineers, in this exigency, to di-
vert their attention from narrow paths
of technical endeavor, for the pur-
pose of formulating a solution of
these social problems, a solution
which shall conform just as closely
to psychological and normal laws as
their usual plans and specifications
conform to physical laws; and, by
their honesty and purity of purpose,
by their characteristic clarity and di-
rectness of thought and method, and
by the public confidence and respect
which is the heritage of their profes-
sion, to carry their convictions and
their prescriptions into effec: for the
lasting benefit of mankind.

ROY W. SELLARS, PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY
To have a philosopher write for a
technical magazine is assuredly an ex-
periment. It is, in fact, doubly an ex-
periment: one for the editor and one
for the philosopher. The editor asks
himself, What shall I get? Will any-
one understand it? Will it be too
abstract? The philosopher runs over
in his mind his natural approach to
problems and seeks perplexedly to
compare it with the professional
man's point of view and interests. Can
he find common ground and yet sug-
gest something new? Perhaps a dif-
ferent perspective, perhaps a slightly
unusual emphasis?
Let us suppose, then, that there was
a symposium on the subject of de-
mocracy. The engineer would un-
doubtedly point out the difference in
the technique of industry to-day. He
would call attention to the conquest
of nature through applied science and
ingenious invention. Man's produc-
tive capacity is today at least a hun-
dred-fold what it was a century and a
half ago. And production has stimu-
lated transportation to make the range
of commerce world-wide. The pow-
er-loom has the huge locomotive and
the ocean-liner for its complement.
And the age of coal may be passing
into the age of electricity.
I shall not attempt to point out even
the chief discoveries and inventions
which are in operation in the indus-
trial world to-day. The factories are
object lessons in what has been accom-
plished. And the details can be known
only by technicians. Yet even the edu-
cated man who has not specialized in
this field of activity has some aware-
ness of what has been achieved.
In such a hypothetical symposium,
the philosopher, if asked to partici-
pate, would probably listen with gen-
uine interest to the tale of technical.
progress and then ask what this prog-
resss means in terms of human life.
Has this change in industrial methods
and in power of production affected
human relations? Does democracy
mean the same to-day that it did a
hundred years ago? Or have new
problems arisen for social adjustment?
Has human happiness increased com-
mensurately with this multiplication
of productive capacity? Are human
needs of a necessary kind satisfied be-
fore luxuries are made? Have the
hours of labor been decreased in ac-
cordance with the capacity to pro-
duce? Are the relations between
masters and men much as they were
in the past? In short, the questions
the philosopher would be apt to pro-
pound and to discuss in such a sym-
posium would be concerned with the
bearing of technical improvements
upon the good life. These, he would
say, are instrumental values. They
are tools and instruments for the pro-
duction of goods and services. How
are they co-ordinated with intrinsic
values, with human happiness and
fellowship?
These questions at which I have
hinted point to what I have called
complications in democracy. The
query I have in mind is this, Can
democracy remain quite the same
when social conditions alter tremen-
dously?
We all know in a general way what
we mean by democracy. The word
comes trippingly enough from our


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
tongues. And yet do we often
enough seek to explore what is basic
in the idea and what the implications
of this idea are? I shall take upon
myself the responsibility of answer-
ing these questions in the negative. It
has been my experience as a teacher
and as a somewhat socratic questioner
of my fellows that democracy has
been to us Americans too much of a
"blessed word." We have drifted
with the current a little too uncriti-
cally.
It may repay us to recall the class-
ical example of '"blessed words," and
then ask ourselves whether the criti-
cism at which I have hinted is not in
a measure justified.
An old Scotch lady, 'tis said, went
to the kirk one Sabbath morning. On
her return, the rest of the family re-
alized that she was deeply moved.
Thinking that the sermon must have
been the cause of this unusual emo-
tion, they asked her what the text had
been. But she only rocked herself
back and forth in her chair, half
shouting, half sobbing out: "Mesopo-
tamia, Mesopotamia, blessed word!"
This word had come to have for her a
deep emotional import; it was what
the psychologists call a stimulus to the
mystical, religious side of her nature.
Now I believe that this story is an
allegory of wide application. In how
many fields and affairs, does not emo-
tion and habit replace and stop analy-
sis and reflection. A word is apt to
be a stimulus to which people respond
instinctively as we say.
But in a University this careless-
ness and emotionalism will not do. It
is a place set apart and dedicated to
reflection. We want to know what
we mean by the terms we use; we
want to be alive to the needs and
problems of our generation; we want
to be creators and interpreters of
life in our turn jus.t as our fathers
were in theirs. Let us therefore seek
to take counsel together and try to
grasp more distinctly what the prob-
lems confronting democracy are.
To begin to understand democracy
in its wide sense, we must appreciate
both the human sentiments it stress-
es and the institutions which are more
or less molded by those sentiments.
We may call these two sides of de-
mocracy the inner and the outer. Un-
less people are hypocrites, we should
expect their institutions to be fairly
in accord with their values cf per-
sons and things. In the long run,
surely, institutions are functions—a
term engineers will appreciate—of
what people feel to be right.
The sentiments which we Ameri-
cans have in mind when we 'hink of
democracy are somewhat as follows:
self-respect, a sense of justice, a dis-
like of caste, kindliness, a willingness
to co-operate. This is not a long list,
but it brings out those feelings of fel-
lowship and humanity which are the
basic traits of democracy. There does
not need to be gush and sentimental-
ism about democracy, but assuredly
something of respect for all sorts of
human beings is implied. Every citi-
zen must be capable of taking some-
thing of, the attitude of the old puri-
tan who said of a human wreck,
"There but for the grace of God
goes—," inserting his own name in
the blank.
The first era of democracy was in-
dividualistic and at times just a little
too harsh and self-congratulatory. It
was the devil-take-the-hindmost credo.
We are now passing into a new era
more co-operative in its habits and so-
cial instincts. WTiat will come of this
closer connection between individuals,


3'
their fuller sense of interdependence,
is one of the complications of modern
democracy.
On the institutional side, democra-
cy has found partial expression in
government, in methods and spirit of
social intercourse, and in economic in-
stitutions. The citizen who takes de-
mocracy seriously—and I hope that
all university students do—will be
continually asking himself whether
these institutions and social methods
can be improved in this or that con-
crete respect so as to correspond more
with the ideal which he has of democ-
racy. The danger is to take institu-
tions too much for granted, to tacitly
assume that they are unimprovable.
Are tools and instruments the only
things which mankind can improve?
Of course, not. Social relations need
adjustments.
Political democracy has largely en-
grossed the attention of Americans in
the past. That was their great experi-
ment and pretty well took up their ef-
fort. That was natural while we
were an agricultural people engaged
in founding homesteads. But we are
now an industrial people and over
half of us live in cities. New prob-
lems are before us to face.
The social aspects of democracy
also need attention. In the field of
voluntary association, the strength and
sincerity of democratic feelings soon
reveal themselves. When society
splits into groups which are hostile to
one another, when the poor and the
rich live in separate worlds, when the
educated man does not sympathize in
an intelligent way with the troubles of
the uneducated, then the sentiment of
democracy needs revivification. On
the social side, democracy arose as a
deepening and broadening of sympa-
thy and as a challenging of those arti-
ficial barriers which in the past di-
vided society into casts. The lesson
here is that the social spirit of democ-
racy is not easy to maintain.
But I wish to place peculiar stress
upon the complications arising from
the industrial methods of today. I
do not think that Americans yet rea-
lize how grim and pressing these in-
dustrial problems are, and how they
affect all sides of life. We have been
in such a hurly-burly of commercial-
ism and invention that we could not
take thought for the new relations
which grew up. Can we carry some-
thing expressive of democracy over
into industry?
I can, perhaps, put the situation
clearly enough if I point out that in
the old days industry consisted of two
stories, the employer and his work-
men, while now it is at least four sto-
ries in height. There is the laborer
below, then come the foremen and
subordinate managers, next we have
the technicians, then the administra-
tors. Perhaps we would be justified
in adding a fifth story, that of the fin-
anciers. The control is obviously
from above and, what is more, the
personal touch is largely lost. It is
this complicated structure which gives
rise to the danger of autocracy. Can
this autocracy, so far as it is neces-
sary, be qualified by devices savoring
of a democratic spirit? I take that
to be a very important problem in the
field of social organization. Upon
finding a solution much depends. Ex-
periments along the line of workshop
committees and councils are move-
ments to be commended. Here we
have an obvious complication. So
engaged have Americans been in pro-
duction that they have drifted into
the narrow outlook of specialists.
They have forgotten too much the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
human side of industry. I do not
think that American business men
meant to be autocrats, but the temp-
tation was great and they often suc-
cumbed.
Let me draw an analogy between
politics and industry. Would Amer-
icans be satisfied with an efficient gov-
ernment if there were no element of
self-government in it? That .vas our
quarrel as democrats with Germany-
It is maintained by many keen think-
ers that our commercial life is full of
autocracy which is justified in the
minds of its advocates by the effici-
ency it supposedly gives. But can
we have autocracy in industry and
democracy in the other aspects of so-
ciety? To introduce a human note
into industry is the task of a democ-
racy become self-conscious in regard
to these problems.
The task is not an easy one and
will require calmness and willingness
to co-operate and experiment. I do
think that the English tradition of ad-
justment and compromise will be val-
uable for us as we enter these trou-
bled waters. Force will net settle
problems; thinking and feeling are
alone effective. The thinking must
be specific, realistic and informed; the
feeling must arise out of truly broad
and genuinely democratic sentiment*.
It is the duty of all young university
men to take a scientific, I might almost
say, a philosophic, view of these prob-
lems. Don't take sides too hastily.
The need is to be socially-minded and
to be sensitive to the broader rela-
tions and implications of these contro-
versies.
New Engineering Blii.ding


ING DURING THE WAR
H. C. SADLER, PROFESSOR OF MARINE ENGINEERING
Previously to the summer of .1914,
or at the beginning of the Great War,
shipbuilding did not rank as one of
the larger industries of the United
States. While we possessed some of
'the finest shipyards in the world, they
were comparatively few in number.
Owing to the necessity of greatly in-
creased production of Naval vessels,
the shipbuilding capacity of the bel-
ligerent powers during the years 1914
to 1917 was taxed to its utmost, with
the result that comparatively few
merchant vessels were being turned
out by the big shipbuilding countries
of Europe.
During this period therefore, it was
only natural that the eyes of all coun-
tries should be turned towards the
United States to supply the deficiency.
This led to an increase in ships built
as compared with former years.
It was not however, until the United
States entered the war, and particu-
larly when the submarine menace be-
gan to become acute, that the neces-
sity for vastly increased production
of ships by this country became evi-
dent. By this time the Emergency
Fleet Corporation, the operative con-
struction part of the United States
Shipping Board, had become estab-
lished, with Charles M. Schwab as Di-
rector General.
Perhaps few people realize that the
Emergency Fleet Corporation han-
dled the largest construction pro-
gram ever attempted, not only in this
country, but in the world. Besides
building many new shipyards, in-
creasing the facilities of existing ones,
it was also necessary to provide for
the production of engines, boilers,
auxiliary machinery, outfit, etc. The
corporation therefore, controlled not
only the output of every shipyard in
the country, but also that of innumer-
able other industries which supplied
the necessary adjuncts that go to make
a finished ship. Incidentally also it
had practically to build cities, trans-
portation lines, etc., in order to house
the labor, or bring it from surorund-
ing districts to the various shipyards.
When it is considered that the or-
ganization to do all this was got to-
gether and operating successfully in
considerably less than a year from the
declaration of war, this in itself may
be looked upon as one of our great
achievements. At the time of the
armistice, the contracts completed and
arranged for amounted to over three
billion dollars.
While it is not the purpose of this
article to go into any detail regarding
the shipbuilding program, a few de-
velopments directly traceable to war
conditions may be of interest.
One of the most important of these
was, what might be called the appli-
cation of the methods of quantity pro-
duction to the construction of both
ships and their machinery. Before
the war, it was rarely the case that
more than two or three vessels of ex-
actly the same type were ever con-
structed. One of the first problems
therefore was to reduce the number
of types or designs of ships to a min-
imum. Unfortunately this idea could
not be carried out to its logical con-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
elusion, viz., of having every builder
of say a 9,000 ton vessel build from
exactly the same plans, for the follow-
ing reasons. When the Emergency
Fleet Corporation commandeered the
shipyards they were all filled with
contracts for foreign owners, and
consequently all plans, molds, steel
orders, etc., were already prepared;
and each builder had his own designs.
To have standardized on ' design"
would have meant a considerable de-
lay in construction, so instead of this
each 'shipyard" was standardized.
This meant that in nearly all cases a
shipyard built only one type of ship.
Where however, new shipyards were
built under Government supervision
this method reached its most highly
developed state, in what was a com-
pletely new development, viz., the
"Fabricated ships." The three yards
where this scheme was in force in its
entirety were, The Submarine Boat
Corporation, The Merchant Ship-
building Company, and "Hog Island."
Briefly the "fabricated" ship is one
where practically all the . steel is
punched, sheared and parts partial-
ly assembled at the structural steel
works, and the shipyard is in this case,
simply an erecting plant where the
various members are assembled and
the above shipyards were fabricated
riveted. The parts of the vessels for
in practically every state in the coun-
try as far as the Middle West, and
even as far north as Canada. When
it is considered that the material for
say one hundred and fifty vessels all
precisely alike could be ordered at one
time, quantity production was made
possible. While certain difficulties
occurred, the scheme proved a com-
plete success. One of the plants, viz.,
Hog Island, has come in for a good
deal of criticism, largely because it
was a somewhat sensational under-
taking to build a shipyard with fifty
ways, and consequently excellent fod-
der for the voracious and too san-
guine "Press." Suffice it to say that
such an undertaking had never before
been attempted or even dreamed of;
and although it took somewhat longer
to complete than was originally esti-
mated, the final results show that as
a means of producing ships, it was in.
every way a success. Even after the
armistice, when the pressure of war
production was greatly reduced, it
was completing, or one might say
"manufacturing," between six and
seven 7,500 ton ships a month, and
successful ships at that.
Careful attention to quantity pro-
duction methods was also reflected in
other shipyards, whereas before the
war, the building of two ships per way
per anum was considered no mean
performance, one shipyard on the west
coast. The Skinner &amp; Eddy Company
of Seattle, more than doubled this
amount, and actually produced com-
pleted ships of about 9,000 tons at
the rate of five per way per annum.
Another interesting development
was in connection with the main pro-
pelling machinery of the merchant
vessels built during the war. The fa-
cilities for building the typical marine
reciprocating engine were naturally
somewhat limited, with the result that
other types of machinery had to be
called on to make good the deficiency.
Although the geared turbine had
been used to a somewhat limited ex-
tent before the war, its application to
merchant vessels was one of the out-
standing developments of our ship-
building program. While certain
difficulties naturally occurred, these
were finally overcome; and with the
experience thus gained I think it is


35
safe to say that this type of machinery
for ships has come to stay.
Other new types were also under
construction or ordered, among which
may be mentioned the electric drive,
and the Diesel engine; but nearly all
these were cancelled after the armis-
tice. If the war had lasted another
six months these newer forms of pro-
pulsion would have had a more com-
plete trial.
The question of standardization was
also being vigorously attacked in nu-
merous lines, and among these lines
which were completed may be men-
tioned, life boats, windlasses, valves,
deck and machinery stores, outfit,
hardware, plumbing, etc. Here again
the armistice arrived a little too soon
to see more complete fulfilment of the
standardization of all details of equip-
ment.
Another interesting and completely
new science or art, in which great
strides were made, was in the painting
of vessels so as to deceive the sub-
marine commander. The name
"Camouflage" was applied to this al-
though in reality the Dazzie System
more nearly expresses the idea. It
is impossible to conceal a ship at sea
by the same processes of Camouflage
as used on land, but by the applica-
tion of proper systems, perspective,
and the breaking up of outline, it is
possible to so disguise a vessel that
when viewed through a periscope, it
is very difficult to determine which
way she is headed, or even to get any
fixed lines upon which observations
may be taken. Thanks to the untir-
ing efforts of numerous artists, this
new science made rapid strides, and
the writer was fortunate in being able
to have a complete record of this work
presented to the University of Michi-
gan, together with a small experimen-
tal theatre and its equipment for test-
ing various designs.
Wooden shipbuilding had almost
disappeared except for few concerns
and for some smaller and special
types of vessels. In the early days
of the war it appeared that our only
hope of increasing the output of ships
lay in the wooden vessel. If anyone
could have foreseen, at that time, the
developments in steel ship construc-
tion which were actually accomplish-
ed, the story of the wood ship might
have been different. Suffice ir to say,
that in spite of numerous difficulties
hundreds of these vessels were pro-
duced and probably did their share in
helping toward the final results.
The concrete ship was also devel-
oped, but here again owing to the
newness of the problem, a large
amount of scientific investigation had
to be undertaken before the final de-
signs could be prepared. At one time
something over fifty of these vessels
ranging up to 7,500 tons were under
contract, but the final number actual-
ly built was considerably reduced. Of
these completed, time alone can show
how this form of construction will
be able to compete with the steel ship,
but from an Engineering standard the
successful application of reinforced
concrete to shipbuilding is a distinct
achievement.
Taking it all together the country
may well be proud of the results ac-
complished. To have brought the
shipbuilding production of the coun-
try to a position where the output ex-
ceeded that of Great Britain, and in
the end to have built up a tangible
asset in the shape of a much needed
Merchant Marine of over ten million
tons, cannot, as in the case of some
other war activities be classified as a
"War Loss."


NATIONAL INDUSTRY
J. H. COLWELL. PRIMARY EXAMINER,
U. S. PATENT OFFICE
In normal times the Patent Office
is, to a certain extent, a barometer or
index of the industrial activities of
the nation, and it is a logical conclu-
sion that under the stress of war con-
ditions the energies, efforts, and
thought of the people would, in a de-
gree, be reflected in the applications
and specifications filed in the office.
These inventions and improve-
ments disclose many varieties of de-
vices and methods relating directly to
war, the purely military, both defen-
sive and offensive, predominating. In
addition to the regularly filed specifi-
cations constituting a part of the per-
manent records of the office, letters
and papers were daily received, pre-
senting every conceivable form of de-
vice, conception and idea designed to
accomplish some desired function and
result, with requests for advice on the
practicability and probable value to
the government, and also asking in-
formation in some particular field,
and how to get a plan before the pro-
per military authorities.
Owing to the widely distributed anci
more or less inaccurate accounts and
reports published in the magazines
and the daily press on submarine and
U-boat activities, it was but natural
that the minds of many were directed
in channels towards devising means
to meet and combat that menace.
Hundreds of applications relating
to U-boats were filed; some of them
meritorious and practical, some ordi-
nary, and others crude and of no val-
ue in the incomplete form presented
towards meeting existing conditions
from a practical standpoint. Many
amounted to no more than mere con-
ceptions, or ideas, relating to some-
thing it was wished to accomplish
without setting forth or presenting
any concrete structure or means for
effecting the solution. Some of these
latter may possibly contain valuable
suggestions and hints, but the exigen-
cies and conditions of the times pre-
cluded any extended experimentation,
trials or tests with such doubtful and
problematical results. Time was an
all important factor and quantity pro-
duction a necessity.
It is by no means an improbability
that in the future, after the country
has settled to normal condition and
status, that certain of these devices
and suggestions, when subjected to
careful study, scrutiny and experi-
ment by practical and theoretical ex-
perts in the respective lines, may fur-
nish and reveal information to pre-
pare and blaze the way to a practical
solution of some present problem in
the arts.
It is a curious commentary and
phase of human nature that novices
start out to initiate and make improve-
ments in mechanisms relating to arts
in which they have little or no previ-
ous information and knowledge, in-
stead of, as would naturally be sup-
posed, directing their efforts along
lines and channels in which they may
be more or less familiar.
Numerous suggestions have been
submitted relating to submarine hull


37
construction with a view of strength-
ening and increasing capacity and dis-
placement, improving the propulsion
the steering control and the depth
regulation, as well as devising safety
and escape means in case of the ves-
sel being unable to rise to the surface.
These latter take the form in many
instances of buoys, which, on being
released, rise to the surface, thus
serving to locate a sunken vessel, sup-
ply fresh air, and furnish communi-
cation by means of telephone connec-
tions and air tubes to the imprisoned
crew.
If in the future the submarine were
generally utilized for water transpor-
tation, or salvage purposes, as it is at
present to some extene. these devices
would be of great importance in serv-
ing a most useful and valuable pur-
pose in reducing and obviating un-
necessary loss of life and waste of
material wealth.
A large field for marine salvage
work was created by U-boat destruc-
tiveness in sinking a vast amount of
tonnage, and it may be that the sub-
marine will become a decided con-
structive factor in the recovery.
As a defense against submarine tor-
pedo attacks, all sorts of contrivances
to protect ships' hulls have been sug-
gested, and submitted to the Patent
Office. The most numerous in the
early part of the war were in the na-
ture of nets of many varied construc-
tions, including linked plates, endless
rotating belts of plating, spars extend-
ing laterally from the vessels' sides,
and provided with bombs capable of
being lowered into the water. It is
believed, however, that they failed to
be of practical value. Self-propelled
torpedoes have also been devised to be
guided from outriggers to travel a
course on each side parallel to that of
the ship, and arranged to be controlled
and exploded therefrom at will by
means of electric connections.
Many forms of so-called unsink-
able marine craft have been designed,
some taking the form of a great num-
ber of small compartments provided
with air tanks to render the ship more
buoyant; others in providing ordi-
nary ships' compartments with flexi-
ble air tight bags arranged to be au-
tomatically, or otherwise quickly in-
flated with gas or air, so that water
could be expelled from a damaged
compartment; other systems involve
a double hull, so that in case the out-
er shell was damaged by a torpedo or
collision, the main hull would remain
intact. It is understood that this sys-
tem has been looked upon with favor
by the government and ship men, and
many of the suggestions may be of
value in the future to practical ship
builders and constructors.
The demand for immediate quan-
tity production in marine tonnage
brought about a revival in the long
dormant art of wooden ship construc-
tion. Several systems have been in-
troduced and, with the aid of modern
mechanical appliances, ships of con-
siderable size were built in a compara-
tively short time. A serious objec-
tion encountered is the length of time
required to properly season the tim-
ber.
Different systems of iron and fab-
ricated construction have been pre-
sented, including asembling and unit-
ing the framing, deck beams, and pla-
ting by electric welding processes,
which in a 11 probability will play an
important part in the upkeep of the
nation's marine tonnage.
The employment of reinforcd con-
crete in ship building, owing lo lower
cost, but principally to the facility and


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
rapidity of construction, received a de-
cided impetus. The idea was old,
barges and small craft having been
built so constructed, yet, it had never
been attempted on a large scale or in
sea-going vessels of large displace-
ment. As an example of the practical
application of concrete in the con-
struction of sea-going vessels, owing
its existence to the exigencies of war
conditions, the 5000 ton steamship
Faith, built on the California coast
in a period of a little over six weeks
is referred to. It is understood that
a number of these vessels of consid-
erable displacement, 5000 to 7500
tons, have been built or contemplated,
and that their performance has been
satisfactory, and a practical success
so far as can be judged at the present
time. The various plans proposed in
this type of vessel follow largely the
lines of steel construction with the
longitudinal and transverse frame
members, bulkheads, etc., construct-
ed of concrete reinforced by various
methods. This involved a study of
materials with a view of obtaining
light, strong, and waterproof stone.
It has generally been accomplished by
incorporating a naturally occurring
light earth, or a manufactured mate-
rial in the mixture, either in a finely
divided form,,pr as large particles con-
stituting an aggregate for the con-
crete.
It may be that the designs submit-
ted, efforts expended, and the large
amount of information furnished in
the patents granted have paved the
way for a formidable rival of the
steel ship, due to the relative cheap-
ness, and the time saving factor in
the construction of concrete ships,
which is considerable. About one-
eighth to one-tenth of the labor, and
that mostly unskilled, is required in
building such a vessel, as compared
with a steel vessel of equal tonnage.
The importance and the application
of heavier than air craft to military
purposes is obvious and self evident.
The attention of the country :mme-
diately centered on this new form of
vehicle ,and it was natural that the
minds of experts and inventors were
directed to improvements in and de-
vising new forms of aeroplanes, as
well as to numerous related auxiliary
devices, with the result that the Pat-
ent Office was flooded with applica-
tipns bearing on aeronautical de-
vices.
There is believed to be no exag-
geration in asserting that the advance
in the development of heavier than air
craft made during the past five years
would have taken from fifteen to
twenty years under normal circum-
stances. "Necessity is the mother of
invention."
In so far as the development of a
practical machine is reflected in the
Patent Office, no new principle or,
mode of air sustained flight appears
to have been evolved. The aeroplane
of the present day is based on the
same principle and involves the gen-
eral structure as rst employed by the
Wright Brothers in their successful
air flight in the first decade of this cen-
tury. Notwithstanding this, however,
there is a wide gap between the air
craft of today and that of 1914 as re-
gards the general efficiency, inherent
stability, carrying capacity,, motive
power, controls, radius of action, as
well as in various accessories, includ-
ing instructional and training devices.
The improvements show a general
tendency to widen the range of use by
anticipating larger load carrying ca-
pacity, necessitating increased engine
power, and improved motor construe-


39
tion. Different types of modern
planes are now equipped with engines
ranging up to over 1200 H. P., includ-
ing multiple engine units with re-
serve power.
There is no reason to suppose that
the limit has been reached, but on
the contrary, that air navigation is
still in its infancy.
Increased power calls for in-
creased strength in frame construc-
tion without too great a sacrifice of
lightness, as weight is a vital factor.
This brought to the fore forms of
bracing, struts, and trussed wing
beams. To overcome excessive wind
resistance of exposed parts, which
causes a useless waste of power and
speed, attention was turned to fair-
ing and stream lining all such parts,
as struts, spars, engine housings, fuel
tanks and radiator casings, as well as
landing carriage frames. As at high
speeds comparatively small areas ex-
ert by their wind resistance a greater
relative detrimental influence, it is
even suggested to stream line the guy
and brace wires.
To secure increased strength with
the necessary lightness, resort is had
to hollow metal tubing, but more gen-
erally to various forms of laminated
wood framing, as embodied in struts,
wing beams and ribs, as well as the
fuselage and pilot's car itself. With
methods devised and means of unit-
ing and arranging the grain of wood
laminae, it is possible to construct a
wing rib lighter than one of steel of
the same strength. Various materi-
als, as aluminum and other metals and
compressed and treated fibrous struc-
ture are constantly being devised, as
substitutes for linen in the supporting
wings and also, various substances
and compositions commonly termed
"dope," for treating the wing sur-
faces.
The hulls and pontoons of hydro-
aeroplanes and flying boats are con-
stantly being increased in size and
strengthened to make them more sea-
worthy in withstanding rough water,
and the shock of alighting thereon.
This has led to the creation of what
might be considered a distinct branch
in marine ship building, to some ex-
tent following the lines of the earlier
hydroplane or speed boat. Increased
strength necessitates the introduction
of longitudinal and transveise hull
framing, providing bulkheads for bal-
last and other compartments analo-
gous to that in ship building with vari-
ations to resist special strains result-
ing from the peculiar demands.
A system of aeroplane construction
which is being developed and particu-
larly adapted to large craft, appears
on its face, not only interesting, but
plausible and practical, provided the
location of the weight is not detrimen-
tal. Broadly stated, the system com-
prises a hollow plane merged into the
fuselage so that the large trussed wing
spars, the engine housings and fuel
tanks, as well as the pilot, are en-
closed within the lifting surface it-
self. The centre of the plane between
the upper and lower walls is deep,
while the wings taper to small depths
towards the tips. The entire machine,
including the pilot's car, is practical-
ly a part of the lifting surface, there-
by necessitating comparatively few
external wind resisting parts.
Among other devices which are be-
ing continually received are detach-
ing means for readily releasing bombs,
mail bags and other articles, steering
devices and automatic controls, wind
pressure vanes for automatically reg-
ulating the speed, maintaining a con-


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
stant angle of incidence and prevent-
ing machine being pointed dangerous-
ly upward to exceed the critical angle
and thus cause stalling, with a result-
ing fatal tail spin.
Knock-down aeroplanes for ready
transportation and assembling, tele-
phone and telegraph accessories, and
wind fans or mills for driving electric
generators, and air and fuel pumps
have received considerable attention.
The merits of a heavier than air
craft capable of hovering in the air, or
stopping in flight, and also of descend-
ing and rising vertically have been ful-
ly appreciated both for military and
other purposes. The advantages of
such a machine are obvious; among
them is the necessity of only a limited
or small area or ground space for
landing and launching. Numbers of
machines designed to possess these
qualifications have appeared, the most
common type being the helicopter or
horizontally rotating screw propelller
for exerting vertical thrust. Some of
these have no lifting plane, relying
solely on the helicopter thrust, while
others propose to use the helicopter in
conjunction with +he ordinar/ aero-
plane and so :o arrange the power
transmission that the tractor or push-
er propellers can be out out an«-l power
aplied (o the helicopter, or both oper-
ated simultaneously.
Although it appears that, as yet,
no practical and successful machine of
the above type has been evolved, it is
by no means improbable that this
problem will be solved in the near fu-
ture, in view of what has been accom-
plished and the gerat strides in de-
velopment along these lines by keen
minded men of mechanical experience.
In view of the constantly increas-
ing altitudes being reached in air
navigation, numerous systems are be-
ing developed for obviating the ill ef-
fects of the highly rarefied atmos-
phere, both on the pilot and in the
functioning of the motor. These com-
prise various arrangements for com-
pressing air, including wind fans, or
motors otherwise operated. Some
utilize the exhaust of the main en-
gines for driving a turbo-compressor.
By this means, a constant supply of
air at uniform pressure is received,
which is automatically regulated in
accordance with elevation.
In hydraulic and fluid pressure ap-
paratus, the general trend during the
past three years appears in details of
invention in previously known types.
Hydraulic motors in variable power
forging presses have been designed
and improved to secure more complete
control of high and low pressures,
economy of high pressure fluid, and
simplicity of the valve mechanism
employed for those purposes.
In fluid motors for hydraulic tur-
bines, an improvement of more orig-
inal character, which is believed to
have considerable importance, con-
sists in so arranging the draft tube
through which the water discharged
from the turbine flows to the tail race
that a large part of the energy usual-
ly remaining in that water is regained
by means of a suction effect upon the
water which is passing through the
turbine. By the use of this improve-
ment, natural low heads, which would
not be otherwise profitable, can be
made available; but its utility is not
confined to such cases.
In steam turbines of general appli-
cation, the type having reversely ro-
tating disks carrying blades in posi-
tion to revolve in adjacent circles in
a space through which the steam
flows radially from centre to perpi-
hery has been particularly developed.


4i
In elastic fluid turbines, especially
intended for aeroplanes, certain in-
ventions which utilize the gas, that
may be derived from a fuel burned in,
and exhausted from the main motor
to drive an auxiliary mechanism, such
as a fan to cool the motor, are ingeni-
ous and of practical value. In some
instances, the main motor is fed with
fuel at a rate to correspond with the
elevation of the aeroplane.
To fluid current motors, including
impellers for driving vehicles, among
others, aeroplanes, inventors have
been and are paying considerable at-
tention. Special efforts have been
directed to the form, material and
mode of construction of the blades of
screw impellers.
In air and gas pumps, recent activi-
ty has been towards the automatic
control of high duty compressors.
Particular points which may be men-
tioned are devices for speed govern-
ing electric motors, driving compres-
sors, and the improvement of thin
elastic metal valves and co-operating
parts for such service.
A pioneer improvement of seeming
high merit and real practical value
within its field has been developed for
producing very high vacua by means
of a jet of vapor, say vapor of mer-
cury, the characteristic function in
which is the prevention of any flow
of molecules of vapor toward the
space to be evacuated.
In pumps, special attention has
been directed to improvements in the
valve mechanism for controlling the
flow of actuating fluid in pumps for
drilled wells of the type wherein com-
pressed air acts directly upon the li-
quid to be pumped, and to improve-
ments in associated devices for auto-
matically controlling the action of
such pumps.
In the art of photography, there has
been a marked development, including
cameras especially adapted for tak-
ing photographs from air craft, and
in methods of utilizing such photo-
graphs in map making and surveying;
meter reading cameras for making
photographic records of the readings
of gas, electric and other meters; col-
or photography, including photo-me-
chanical color reproduction process-
es; printing machines for printing
photographs, and especially for print-
ing moving picture positive films from
moving picture negatives; and range
focusing cameras, consisting of range
finding devices interconnected with
the focusing mechanism to facilitate
focusing.
In metallurgy and metal treatment,
the trend of activity has been to re-
production of new alloys and the
treatment of steel compositions to en-
hance various chemical and physical
properties. Among the various metal
compositions, alloy steels are most nu-
merous, and the number of applica-
tions involving the employment in al-
loys of rare and refractory metals
have been steadily increasing. Heat
treatment of iron and steel materials
is an art which seems to be developing
rapidly and apparently becoming of
great importance.
The art of electric welding is con-
stantly advancing and the develop-
ments of the past few years have ap-
parently been so important that the
art may be almost designated a "new
art." In the electric furnace art, both
apparatus and processes have received
great attention, and the applications
of the electric furnace to steel making
and alloy manufacture comprise an
important part of this activity.
Numerous applications have been
filed for patents on gas masks and


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
many of the improvements made
therein are applicable for use in mines
and other places where poisonous and
noxious gases are likely to be found.
Of most significance in the chemi-
cal arts, the following have seen the
greatest activity and offer promise in
their application to normal peace in-
dustries:
Chlorination and nitration process-
es of organic substances in the prepa-
ration of nitro- and chlor- derivatives
of value not only in explosives, bat
also in dye manufacture; such chlor-
inated and nitrated products find ex-
tended use as solvents and as starting
points in organic syntheses. The need
of organic solvents, etc., such as al-
cohol, acetone, etc., has given added
impetus to the production of these
materials by fermentation and sapon-
ification, the latter process often ac-
companying an initial chlorination
step; further, catalytic oxidation has
been aplied to these various materials
to produce valuable substances such
as ketones and organic acids, the de-
velopment being both in the method
of treatment and the materials treat-
ed.
The manufacture of nitrogen com-
pounds by fixation of atmospheric ni-
trogen became of the most vital im-
portance during the war, and many
processes were devised both for the
production of intermediate nitrogen
compounds in this way and for their
conversion into explosives. During
the past year, a large number of pat-
ents have appeared, many of which
were withheld from publication while
the war was in progress, dealing with
various phases of this subject. Al-
though the need for vast quantities of
explosives has passed, nitrogen com-
pounds are as necessary for soils as
for shells, and it appears that many
of the fixation proceses may be eco-
nomically applied to the production of
fertilizers. Perhaps the process
which furnishes the largest amount of
atmospheric nitrogen in fixed and
available form is the cyanamid proc-
ess. This consists in brief of fusing
a mixture of lime and carbon in an
electric furnace to form calcium car-
bid, treating the carbid with nitrogen
to form calcium cyanamid, and sub-
jecting this to the action of water at
high temperature and under pressure
to free ammonia. The ammonia so
obtained is oxidized by passing it with
air over a catalytic substance produc-
ing nitrogen oxids. These yeild nitric
acid by absorption in water.
Ammonia and nitric acid are sim-
ilarly produced from cyamids, nitrids
and other salts containing fixed at-
mospheric nitrogen. A number of
patents have also recently i-:sued re-
lating to the direct synthesis of nitro-
gen and hydrogen to form ammonia.
Ammonia produced in these ways may-
be neutralized with sulfuric acid,
yielding ammonium sulfate, one of
the most valuable fertilizers. Where
nitric acid is produced by oxidation
of ammonia, it may be converted into
useful agricultural form by treatment
with lime or other basic substances to
form nitrates. It is asserted that on
a large scale of production, fertilizers
so produced can compete in price with
sodium nitrate from the Chile nitrate
beds, the former principal source of
supply. The only other important
source of nitrogen products, aside
from the fixation of atmospheric ni-
trogen and the Chile supply, is the re-
covery of ammonia from the distilla-
tion gases of coal. In this country, a
large number of coke ovens are not
provided with recovery works This
waste is gradually being eliminated,


43
however, and a number of recent pat-
ents cover improvements in the tech-
nique of recovering ammonia from
coal gases as ammonium sulfate.
In the manufacture of refractories
for steel furnaces and the like, mag-
nesite and dolomitic limestone have
been used in an attempt to make re-
fractories equalto those formerly
made from the Austrian magnesite.
A study of the proper relations of
flux to the refractory has developed
improvements over the prior art.
In devising compositions for spe-
cial glasses and lenses to be used for
transmitting and absorbing various
kinds of light rays, especially the ul-
tra-violet and infra-red, metals hith-
erto not used in this art have been dis-
solved in the glass batches, cither in
elemental or combined condition.
The recovery of potash from feld-
spar by fusion or learching, and from
flue dust from cement kilns by elec-
trical precipitation or absorption, has
been seriously studied by chemists
since the shutting off of the German
pitash fields.
Activity in the art of fire extin-
guishing compositions has been large-
ly in the field of organic extinguish-
ing liquids. The problem in both or-
ganic and inorganic chemical prepa-
rations has been to obtain liquids of
very low freezing points, while re-
taining extinguishing properties of
the righest degree. The halogen sub-
stitution products of certain hydro-
carbons are uninflammable and have
been known for several years to be
good fire extinguishers, the most com-
mon and least expensive being carbon
tetrachloride, but this freezes at
-3°F. Several organic compounds,
both solid and liquid, have been pat-
ented in combination with carbon te-
trachloride for the purpose of lower-
ing the freezing point. Another im-
portant direction, although less ex-
tensively followed, has been toward
improvement of foam producing
methods, combined and coacting with
extinguishing liquids.
In the art of fireproofing materials,
cloth has been the special material to
which attention has been directed.
Coatings for aeroplane wings, having
a cellulose ester base and fireproofing
ingredients have been recently pat-
ented.
Improvements have been made in
processes for precipitating exchange
silicates or filter masses, which soften
water by double decomposition re-
actions. The aim has been to obtain
silicates having good physical char-
acteristics such as subdivision and
hardness, as well as chemical effici-
ency.
In varnish making, cumarone and
indent resins, found in solvent naph-
tha (i65°-i75°C.) are polymerized
by acid, heat, or dehydrating treat-
ment, producing resinous substances
soluble in certain organic solvents.
Considerable attention has been di-
rected to devices and systems used in
the industries for purifying water and
separating by-products, many being
utilized in mining and metallurgy.
In the electric art, in some lines tre-
mendous advance has been made dur-
ing the past three years. One aspect
is especially noteworthy, viz., the rap-
id breaking down of the line between
the three arts of telegraphy, telepho-
ny and radio communication, and the
development of a signaling are com-
mon to the three, making use of ele-
ments heretofore generally legarded
as more or less characteristic of one
or the other of these arts.
In the radio art. specifically re-
garded, improvements have been


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
made along several lines. The an-
tenna element and the concept of its
mode of functioning have been stud-
ied, and especial attention given to
large aerial constructions and to the
more extended use of the loop form.
In conection with the latter, particu-
larly, underground and underwater
radio systems have been developed
and systems for signaling to subma-
rines. The important question of sta-
tic and other interference has pro-
duced much activity, giving rise to
applications of the loop antenna and
to various special arrangements of
extended aerials, and changes both in
receivers and trasmitters. The. small
loop or coil has been found useful in
further development in directive
transmission, and in the aeroplane ra-
dio compass.
In the case of so-called high power
stations, i. e., of the Poulson arc type,
the controller has been greatly im-
proved, and considerable use has been
made of audio-frequency in telegra-
phy, telephony and radio torpedo con-
trol at short distances.
Vacuum tube generators and ampli-
tude control, or "modulation," of the
generated oscillations have been con-
stantly improved; and their easy adap-
tation to wire telephony or to composi-
ted systems has opened up a large
field of improvement, especially in
long distance multiplex telephony, so
that now what was once a single com-
munication line, telegraph or tele-
phone, is one providing several
"channels" for simultaneous commu-
nication.
This has naturally led to many im-
provements in balancing networks, in-
cluding filters, loading coils, etc., and
in the amplifier or relay elements. This
last feature has been attended by a
great development in the so-called
vacuum tube relay and the repeaters,
of which it generally forms a part.
Balancing means are automatically se-
lected and connected in repeater sys-
tems and for use in composite and
phantom circuits. Multi-stage ampli-
fiers are now practicable. Develop-
ments in the vacuum tube have been
along the lines of electrode arrange-
ment and composition involving the
new use of many rare metals, and salts
of various gas contents involving rare
gases, of the cooling of the tubes, and
of circuit connections therewith.
In telephony, strictly regarded, the
tremendous advance of automatic de-
velopment has continued, many im-
provements being directed toward
greater applicability of automatic
switching, this automatic type being
made to furnish all the service of a
manual system. Much attention has
been given the private automatic ex-
change, also to simplex and phantom
adaptations, and refinement and vari-
ation in switch structure itselt.
It is firmly believed that this vast
store of more or less valuable infor-
mation and knowledge called into ex-
istence under stress of war conditions
can and will have an important bear-
ing on the great constructive work
now confronting the nation and exert
a stimulating influence on the peace-
ful arts.


PUBLIC WORKS
GARDNER S. WILLIAMS, '89E
The United States Government has
built up and expanded itself in a more
or less haphazard way starting with
the three original departments—
State, Treasury and War, until it is
difficult for anyone to understand the
relationship of the various bureaus
and services that are brought togeth-
er under a single cabinet officer.
The three original departments
were increased by the addition of that
of the Navy during the administra-
tion of John Adams. The Postmaster
General first appeared in the Cabinet
during Jackson's administration, and
the Attorney-General during that of
Tyler.
In 1849 the Department of the In-
terior was created and had transfer-
red to it the Patent Office and the
Census from the Department of
State, the General Land Office and
supervision over mines, from the
Treasury, Indian affairs from the War
Department, the Pension Bureau from
the War and Navy Departments, and
Public Buildings from the President,
to which was added the Penitentiary
of the District of Columbia. The
Census Bureau was later transferred
to the Department of Commerce and
Labor, and the Penitentiary has been
removed, but the other services still
remain in the Interior Department,
and there have been added the Geo-
logical Survey, the Reclamation Serv-
ice, the Bureau of Education, the St.
Elizabeth's and Freedman's Hospit-
als, the Columbia Institute for the
Deaf and Howard University.
The Interior Department was de-
signed to be and has been a sort of
miscellaneous pigeon-hole for gov-
ernmental functions and may be ex-
pected to be more or less heterogene-
ous, but it is hardly more so than the
Treasury Department which embraces
subjects requiring its Secretary to ex-
ercise the functions of a banker, an
architect, a builder, a doctor, an in-
surance agent, a mariner, a life-saver,
a policeman, a printer and a portrait-
ist.
Not only are unrelated subejets
gathered into one department, but re-
lated subejets are scattered thru sev-
eral instead of being in one.
For example, so simple a matter as
river surveys may involve
(1) The Department of War: Corps
Corps of Engineers.
(2) The Department of State: The
International Boundary Com-
mission.
(3) The Department of Commerce:
The Coast and Geodetic Sur-
vey.
(4) The Department of Agriculture:
(a) The Bureau of Roads and
Rural Engineering.
(b) The Forest Service.
(c) The Bureau of Soils.
(d) The Weather Bureau.
(5) The Department of the Interior:
(a) The Geological Survey.
(b) The General Land Office.
(c) The Reclamation Service.
(d) The Bureau of Indian Af-
fairs.
(e) The National Park Service.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
As to the matter of buildings it ap-
pears that they may be constructed
by seven executive department and
four unattached bodies and that al-
together there are twenty-seven sepa-
rate and distinct agencies of the Gov-
ernment authorized to build them.
Such conditions as the foregoing
indicate an organization anything but
businesslike and we well may wish
for another Hamilton to arise and re-
organize the Government.
It may, perhaps, seem strange that
none of our great statesmen have di-
rected their energies to this purpose,
but it is unfortunately a fact that such
an effort would be largely a thankless
task, and a reform, if it is to come, can
only come in response to a definite
and widespread demand from "home."
It has therefore been left to the
Engineers to start a reorganization
by attempting to have brought to-
gether the engineering and architec-
tural work of the Government. The
idea has been under consideration by
Engineers for many years and as far
back as 1880 a bill was before Con-
gress to create a Department of Pub-
lic Works.
The present movement was inaug-
urated at a Convention of Architects,
Engineers, Chemists and Contract-
ors held at Chicago in April, 1919, at
at which there were present 71 dele-
gates representing 74 Societies and
other organizations having an aggre-
gate membership of over 100.000.
That Conference recommended:
"1. That the services and bureaus
of the National Government,
having to do chiefly with mat-
ters of engineering and archi-
tecture, be grouped in one de-
partment to be known as the
Department of Public Work?.
2. That the Department of Pub-
lic Works comprise those
works which are built and op-
erated for the use of the pub-
lic.
3. That the Department of Pub-
lic Works be made available
when desirable for the per-
formance of special engineer-
ing and architectural work for
the use of other Government
bureaus.
4. That there be a systematic
classification and organiza-
tion of engineers, architects
and other employees whose
status shall be such that they
may be recruited and main-
tained on merit."
and appointed a committee to draw a
bill to carry out these recommenda-
tions.
The bill was prepared, and has
been introduced into the Senate by
Senator Jones of Washington, as S.
2232, and in the House by Congress-
man Reavis of Nebraska as H. 6649,
and is commonly referred to as the
Jones-Reavis Bill.
Recognizing the well-founded ob-
jection to an increase in the number of
Cabinet Officers and Departments of
the Government, the framers of the
bill propose to convert the Interior
Department, which now embraces the
Geological Survey, Reclamation Ser-
vice, Bureau of Mines, National
Parks, Public Buildings and Alaskan
Engineering Commissison into a De-
partment of Public Works by trans-
ferring to it from other departments
those Bureaus and Services related
thereto, and transferring out of it to
other Departments those now in it
which are not so related.
The Department of Public Works
as thus proposed will embrace in ad-
dition to the foregoing:


47
The Supervising Architects' Of-
fice now under the Treasury Depart-
ment.
The Construction Division of the
Army, River and Harbor Improve-
ments, Mississippi River Commission,
California Debris Commisssion, now
under the War Department;
The Coast and Geodetic Survey
and Bureau of Standards, now under
the Department of Commerce; and
The Bureau of Public Roads and
the Forest Service now under the
Department of Agriculture.
The Bill provides that there shall
be four Assistant Secretaries having
jurisdiction as follows:
One over all matters of Engineer-
ing design and construction.
One over all Architectural design
and construction,
One over all Scientific work and
Surveys, and
One over all Land and Legal mat-
ters.
To assure the opportunity for train-
ing the Engineer Officers of the
Army in engineering work the Bill
provides that they may be detailed
for service in the Department of Pub-
lic Works.
Such in brief is the Jones-Reavis
Bill to convert the Department of the
Interior into a Department of Public
Works.
Nearly all other civilized countries
have their public works centralized in
a similar manner and our States and
Cities are doing the same. Perhaps
one reason that the National Govern-
ment has not done so before is that
for many years it was held that it had
no authority to engage in such mat-
ters, but whatever the constitutional
authority, it is a fact that for the
current year Congress appropriated
over $600,000,000 for engineering,
architectural and public works func-
tions.
The sixteen Bureaus and Services
that it is at present proposed to col-
lect into the Department of Public
Works are responsible for nearly half
this sum, and it is believed that at
least ten percent of their expenditures
can be saved by a reasonable combina-
tion and correlation of their work.
The following is quoted from a
statement issued by the National Pub-
lic Works Department Association,
whose headquarters are at 502 Mc-
Lachlen Building, Washington.
The establishment of a National
Department of Public Works would
do the following things:
(1) Create an industrial organiza-
tion out of many functions and there-
by make it possible for the Govern-
ment to conduct its public works busi-
ness according to the same principles
that have made American industries
so successful; this will result from:
(2) Increased efficiency, by bring-
ing under one head and dovetailing
into a well balanced machine all
works now built or operated for the
use of the public; and through this
th"re will be created:
(3) Large economies. There
would be more wise and considerate
appraisal of plans, projects and ex-
penditures, the reduced costs that al-
ways come with specializezd effort and
quantity production, and the decrease
in overheads that must occur, when
separated organizations are amalga-
mated. There would be less expendi-
ture or greater results for each dollar
expended.
(4) Eliminate rivalry and compe-
tition for appropriations and author-
ity between departments and bureaus,
which is now placing a large and need-
less burden on the taxpayer.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
(5) Provide a specialized organ-
ization to do technical work for other
departments of Government, which
are now carrying on such work in an
incidental and therefore expensive
way.
(6) Standardization of Govern-
ment contracts and specifications, for
the lack of which the taxpayer is bur-
dened with unnecessary costs and con-
tractors are subject to needless haz-
ards.
(7) Simplification of specifica-
tions for materials, machineiy, etc.,
and elimination of thousands of use-
less grades, types and sizes, which in-
crease costs and difficulties not only
to the Government but to the manu-
facturer as well.
(8) Provide a complete business
organization which can, when war or
other emergency comes, be turned in-
stantly to the business at hand.
(9) Render efficient the establish-
ment and operation of a budget sys-
tem.
(10 Serve as a regulator of our
national industries because under a
rational system of control the Gov-
ernment can speed up its work in
dull times and slow down in boom
times.
(11) Provide means for giving to
the officers of the Corps of Engi-
neers, U. S. Army, a broader engi-
neering experience than they now
have, covering lines required in war
conduct.
(12) Bring the United States into
line with the other important coun-
tries of the world, all but one of which
have departments of public works
under a Cabinet Minister.
(13) Provide for co-ordinated
technical research and create machin-
ery whereby we could compete more
nearly on a parity in mechanical mat-
ters with the research departments of
other great powers.


G. J. WAGNER*
No doubt most of you have read
with interest the Engineering Coun-
cil Committee's report on the com-
pensation of Engineeers published in
the Engineering News Record of
January 15th, 1920. Those of you
who have carefully studied this re-
port no doubt were amazed at the
clearness with which the facts per-
taining to the compensation of engi-
neers have been presented in this ar-
ticle.
It is not my desire to take up your
time by going into this report for I
feel that each one of you should study
this situation for himself, but I do
want to enlarge on certain points in
this report in order to drive home if
possible the necessity for this So-
ciety to do its utmost to assist in bring-
ing about as soon as possible the pro-
posed changes in the compensation
of engineers mentioned in this re-
port.
It is a matter of fact as brought
out by the investigation of the En-
gineering Council Committee, that in
1913 the Committee was convinced
that the compensation for engineering
work compared favorably with that
received by men of other professions,
because very few were interested
enough at that time to even reply to
the inquiries sent out by the Commit-
tee.
Since that time, however, a radi-
cal change of opinion has taken place
on the part of Engineering execu-
*A paper read before the last meeting of
the Michigan Engineering Society.
tives, shown by the fact that practi-
cally the entire federal engineering
service, except the war department
has co-operated with the Engineering
Council Committee in its inquiry, as
well also have 42 per cent of the State
officials and 70 per cent of the Munic-
ipal officials to whom the inquiries
were sent out by the Council Commit-
tee.
The reason for this sudden change
in the opinion of the same men from
1914 to the present time, is in my
opinion solely due to the fact that up
to only a short time ago there were
more engineers available than there
was a demand for.
Looking back over my experience I
find that beginning in August, 1914,
up to six months ago, there was a
constant pressure of re-trenchment
which of course had its effect in hold-
ing down engineering services to the
lowest possible point. No great un-
dertakings were planned for the fu-
ture, requiring the service of expert
engineers, with the result that engi-
neers in general were glad to get a
position at most any salary they would
be paid. At the present time, how-
ever, we find a different view of the
entire situation and the atmosphere is
clearing itself from one of retrench-
ment to one of a great burst of con-
struction activity of all kinds. This
is not only limited to new construc-
tion but it is the rebuilding of many
different engineering works which
have been allowed to depreciate since
the beginning of the war.
All during the war labor became


5°
more and more difficult to obtain and
in order to get increased wages the
entire labor market has become a
floating proposition. Labor has be-
come so accustomed to floating in or-
der to secure increased wages, that I
am told some large automobile fac-
tories make it a point at the present
time of holding their men at one
plant only a short time and then trans-
ferring them to another plant, simply
to keep them from leaving the Com-
pany entirely and going to another
concern where they hope to secure
an increased wage.
All during this time the engineer
quietly waited for better times to
come and now that the time of short-
age of engineers is really beginning
to dawn, we find that in order to in-
crease the compensation of the engi-
neers from that of the pre-war pe-
riod under which most salaried men
are still working to the present day
new working basis, requires something
more than the mere good-will of an
executive especially in Municipal,
County, State and Government engi-
neering work. Engineering salaries
have remained on a low level so long
compared with the compensation of
other lines that it will take the con-
certed effort of the entire engineering
profession to bring this compensa-
tion to a present day working basis in
a short time.
Now the important question in my
opinion which confronts not only this
society, but the engineering world in
general, is whether or not we are go-
ing to have the engineers become a
body of floaters to gradually work up
the income of each individual to a
point where it meets the present day
conditions, or are we going to resort
to some other means to bring about
this condition automatically and to
completely stabalize the engineering
field.
Until recently when the demand for
engineers began to exceed the supply
there was no real reason why the en-
gineers in general could do very much
to change their own conditions, be-
cause if an engineer resigned his po-
sition there were always plenty of ap-
plicants to take his place.
At the present moment, however,
we as a profession are faced with the
same problems as the business man of
the entire world and that is, that the
sooner the general business condi-
tions of the world settle down to a
stable condition, the sooner will we
really make progress in the much-
needed reconstruction of things.
Almost every week before the
Chamber of Commerce or other civic
body some one gives an address on
how to solve the unrest in these after
war times.
The general rule among these
speakers seems to be that they are
always seeking to solve this difficulty'
by changing the business of some other
line of industry than that which the
speaker is connected.
For example, not long ago, a noted
banker delivered an address on this
subject and he laid special stress on
the advisability that the whole solu-
tion rests on the reduction in the cost
of agricultural products.
This banker had nothing to say as
to what should be done with the bank-
ing business but was satisfied that he
saw some trouble in the agricultural
industry.
I would not attempt to advise you
on how to settle these conditions of
unrest in this country but I do know
that if the men of each class of in-
dustry or profession would first try
and solve this problem in their own


5i
particular field in which they are fa-
miliar their ideas about other profes-
sions or industries would then be ac-
cepted by the public.
We as engineers have the same
problem to meet. We should be able
to solve the difficulties in other lines
of industry, but we cannot hope to do
so until we have completely stabilized
our own profession.
Our problem is a very small one
compared with that of other indus-
tries and once we have our problem
solved we will then be able to be of
some aid in solving the problems of
others.!
Looking at the matter optimistically
we can only see that labor and ma-
terial and also engineering services
must be at high level for some time to
come and therefore the only way to
properly balance our own profession
is to bring forth and advocate a class-
ified compensation for engineers
something similar, at least, to that ad-
vocated by the Engineers' Council
Committee. The sooner such a class-
ification is put into effect the sooner
will the engineering profession have
done its part to stabilize its own pro-
fession and put it on the ne wafter-
war-working basis.
Such a classification is not only of
benefit to the individual himself but
also the executive who has to handle
the Engineers.
All executives have had a strenu-
ous time in the last five years handling
the heavy turnover of labor and the
strain is bound to be much greater in
the future if the same conditions be-
gin to loom up in the engineering part
of any organization.
The executive in general will there-
fore welcome, I am certain, a standard
classification for engineering services
such as will be satisfactory to the en-
gineering profession itself and which
will keep the individual engineer sat-
isfied during the heavy construction
period which is rapidly approaching
us.
I think also that the matter of pride
should be given some consideration in
the handling of this matter. During
the five years gone by the engineers
simply have taken what they could
get because there was no demand.
Now, however, when the pendulum
has swung the other way the engineers
cannot pride themselves as being real
men able to do big things if they can-
not even bring about conditions in
their own profession such that the in-
come of the individual engineer is
large enough to meet the present con-
ditions.
I had in my office the other day a
man who is considered one of the
foremost Engineers in the country.
This man has a method of equitably
handling public utility matters. . The
proposition in itself sounds feasible
enough but this engineer is not large
enough to have the public at this time
accept his views.
I talked with him and found out
that he was doing nothing at all to-
ward assisting in the proper organiza-
tion of engineers so that as a body the
engineering opinion would bear some
weight with the public.
Public opinion is five years behind
the times and the breach between pub-
lic opinion and the thoughts of the
men thinking as of today is too great
for any one engineer to settle.
What we need is organization so
that the engineering profession as a
whole can give an opinion that will
have some weight with the public.
One thing is sure and that is that
engineers must change from the way
they have been doing things in the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
past as far as organization is con-
cerned. I know of on other profes-
sion which accomplishes so little as a
whole to direct public opinion as the
engineers. The reason for this is
that in the past each engineer has
prided himself as being an indepen-
dent unit thinking absolutely for him-
self, shifting for himself and not pay-
ing much attention to the other fel-
low.
The result is that in the solving of
the big questions of the day, we look
to combinations of capital, labor and
agriculture, while the engineer, each
as a unit for himself, stands divided
and produces no result.
The license law under which we are
operating at present here in Michi-
gan will aid a great deal in training;
engineers to stand together to solve
as a whole not only compensation
matters but also the large business
problems of the day which need the
best brains in the world.
You are not going to get very far,
however, in having the opinion of the
engineer bear weight in these huge
problems unless the engineers as a
whole properly co-operate so as to
have an opinion which has back of it
the force of the engineering profes-
sion.
Now the important question is what
can this society do to aid in putting
across this matter of proper classi-
fied compensation?
You must admit that at the pres-
ent time this Society reorganized as it
is on a broad basis can handle this
proposition much more easily than it
handled the Engineers' Registration
law under the old society.
In view of the Registration law we
now have a central bureau where the
experience of each engineer is listed
and he is given credit in his title ac-
cording to that experience.
Now is it not logical that after we
have a standard classified Registra-
tion of experience that the compensa-
tion covering this experience should
also be in a standard classified form?
These two propositions are so close-
ly related, and in view of the fact that
we have put one over, it will take only
a small effort to put the other across.
I feel that as far as fact and inves-
tigations are concerned that this so-
ciety can well consider the report of
the Engineering Council and do all
that we can to assist the Council in
carrying its investigations to a suc-
cessful end.
After these investigation? are com-
pleted it then remains for this so-
ciety to tstablrh th? dassified com-
pensation rate her'? in Michigan.
There is no other society in Michi-
gan that is nearly as well equipped as
the Michigan Engineering Society for
properly waging a campaign of edu-
cation on this matter of compensa-
tion.
The fact that it is the Michigan En-
gineering Society behind it, will have
a big effect of causing the public to
accept the proposition as it comes to
them.


TRUCK OPERATING COST
A. H. BLANCHARD, PROFESSOR OF HIGHWAY ENGINEERING
Highways are merely the means to an end. That end is primarily eco-
nomic and efficient transportation of passengers and commodities. If this
fundamental principle had been the universal basis for the improvement of
highways during the past twenty years, the problem of determining the re-
lation of highways to motor truck operating cost would have been materially
simplified. The highway transport engineer or manager cannot assume, for
every transportation route, that what has been done is what should have
been done. In fact, in the case of any one of thousands of proposed routes,
he cannot assume that the highways are 100% improved even based on the
crudest ideas of what constitutes an improved highway. It is well to bear in
mind that the construction of highways outside of municipailties is today
in its infancy. Furthermore, it should be recognized that of the 2,500,000
miles of highways outside of municipalities in the United States, only
twelve percent can be classified as improved and that not over one-fourth
of one per cent are suitable to carry intensive motor truck traffic. No thor-
ough consideration appears to have been given to the effect of highways on
operating cost by many legislators and commissions when establishing sched-
ules of legal rates for transportation of commodities. For example, the Ne-
braska uniform rate of one and one-half cents per one hundred pounds per
mile recognizes the fact that the roads of Nebraska will not permit a three
hundred day a year business with five ton trucks, but entirely fails to recog-
nize the fundamental fact that a thirty-mile haul on one route may easily cost
twice as much as on another route, particularly as only about two per cent
of Nebraska's rural routes are classified as improved.
It is evident that a thorough field investigation of every proposed high-
way transport route should be made and that the results of this survey
should be an important factor in the final decision pertaining to the estab-
lishment of a highway transport business. The result of this survey, from
the standpoint of highways, may be roughly classified under the following
three heads: first, relation of unimproved highways to operating cost;
second, relation of proposed new construction and the reconstruction of im-
proved sections to operating costs; and third, relation of sections of im-
proved highways which will not be reconstructed for a period of less than
five years to operating cost.
The first class of sections of a proposed route, namely, the unimproved
portions of highways, may present conditions of narrow widths of roadways,
steep grades, sharp turns or rocky, sandy or clayey surfaces, such that a
glance will be sufficient to condemn the route for efficient highway transport.
Generally speaking, unimproved highways constitute a positive economic
barrier to the development of a highway transportation business. Take for


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
example George H. Pride's 1919 average daily cost of $28.56 covering the
operation of a five ton truck for an average of fifty miles per day for three
hundred days per year. Mr. Pride's cost analysis is as follows:
Driver $ 5.00
Tires, guaranteed basis 3.00
Oil, grease, kerosene, graphite, etc 5°
Gasoline, 3&gt;4 miles per gallon, 14 gallons at 25c per gallon 3.50
Depreciation, 20% on $6,000 investment 4.00
Interest, 6% on $6,000 investment 60
Insurance, average $450 per year 1.50
Garage, rental, etc., $300 per year, per car 1.00
Maintenance, minor repairs, supplies, tire chains, tires, lamps, springs,
spark plugs, etc 1.00
Overhaul, complete overhaul, prorated, 5c per mile, or $600 yearly
on a fifty mile day 2.00
License 20
Body Upkeep, repairs and painting 30
Supervision, based on 10% of costs to this point 2.26
Lost time; time lost on repairs, no work, weather or other causes, 20%
figured on total, less gas, tires, and oil, etc 3.70
Total cost per day operated $28.56
The above figures are based on New York Citv conditions including the
average type of improved highway outside of cities over which his trucks
operate. Let us diagnose Mr. Pride's cost sheet and determine what would
be the effect of substituting a system of poor roads for the system of im-
proved roads in the near vicinity of New York City. It is self-evident that
poor roads would materially raise the cost of at least the following items on
the cost sheet; tires, oil, grease, gasoline, depreciation, maintenance, and
lost time period. A combination of a rough roadway on steep grades
for a mile section of a twenty-five mile route might easilv double or treble
the operating cost if not actually rendering continuous operation of a truck
over such a route impracticable.
The following interesting deduction pertaining to saving in gasoline
which will result when the system of five thousand miles of highways in Il-
linois are improved has been made by A. N. Johnson. He assumes that these
highways will develop a traffic of 500 motor vehicles per day for 300 days
in the year. He estimates that the saving of gasoline by the above traffic
on improved roads as compared with earth roads would be 66,000.000 gal-
lons per year or approximately $15,000,000. The results of tests carried
out by the White Company of Cleveland with a two-ton motor truck are of
interest as an indication of the saving of gasoline due to operation of motor
trucks on some of the types of pavements suitable for trunk highways as
compared with operation over earth roads. The investigations showed that
on concrete and brick pavements it was practicable to operate a loaded two-
ton motor truck for an average of 11.5 miles on one gallon of gasoline,


whereas on the average earth road only 5.8 miles to the gallon was obtain-
able. In round figures, the conclusion drawn from the test indicate that it
was possible to operate the.two-ton truck on high class pavements for twice
the distance which was practicable on earth roads.
The second classification of highway sections cover those parts of
routes which are liable to be constructed or reconstructed within a compara-
tively short period after the establishment of a transportation business. This
phase of highway improvement demands serious consideration as construc-
tion and reconstruction generally implies that vehicular traffic will be shunt-
ed onto detours, most of which are far from satisfactory, considered from
the standpoint of economic highway transport. The growth of motor trans-
port will force highway engineers to give serious attention to providing ser-
viceable roadways for traffic during highway improvement. In some cases
roadways are provided alongside the highway under improvement, in oth-
ers one-half of the highway is improved at a time and in others the traffic
uses detours. Highway transportation interests will soon emphatically de-
mand that the same consideration be given to the facilitation of highway
transport as is usually provided for railway transport when a railroad line
is under reconstruction.
In connection with the third general class of highway sections of a given
route, that is, improved sections which will not be reconstructed in the near
future, it is necessary to consider the influence of each fundamental ele-
ment of a highway upon economic highway transport. The elements which
will be considered are drainage, foundations, grades, widths of roadway,
shoulders, curves, roadway wearing courses and bridges.
DRAINAGE AND FOUNDATIONS. American highway literature
contains an enormous amount of advice pertaining to drainage and founda-
tions. Although it is generally conceded that the importance of this sub-
ject has not been over-emphasized, nevertheless American practice is far
from satisfactory. The writer believes that the increasing use of highways
by motor transport will cause so many failures of insufficiently drained
highways and others which have weak foundations that there will be a gen-
eral improvement in the near future. As loads are transmitted from the
wearing course to the foundation and from there distributed to the sub-
grade, the bearing power of the soil composing the subgrade is an important
factor in the design of the highway. It is well known that the bearing pow-
er of soils in many instances is materially increased by efficient drainage. The
roadway, therefore, should be so drained that the maximum bearing power
of the subgrade is developed. While a poorly drained roadway might sup-
port a light rural traffic, it will be rapidly destroyed if subjected to com-
mercial motor transport including, for example, several 5-ton trucks.
The greatest improvement noted in American foundation practice is
the use of cement-concrete foundations, or stone foundations of equivalent
strength, on state trunk highway systems. The concrete foundation, as a
structure, should be analyzed from the standpoint of the external forces
acting upon it, the stresses resulting from such forces and the composition
and depth of the concrete foundation to provide for the strains within it.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Based on statistics furnished by many motor truck companies, the maximum
concentrated load under one rear wheel may amount to 11,000 pounds.
This load, therefore, distributed over the area of contact of the tire may
be considered the force for which the foundation should be designed from
the standpoint of direct compression. The foundation may likewise be
considered as a beam or slab, two or four concentrated loads of the above
amount being considered as beam reactions while the upward pressure of
the earth against the base of the foundation may be considered as a dis-
tributed load. Depending upon the possible position of the loads assumed,
the beam or slab may be considered as a continuous structure or one with
cantilever projections. Again, assuming that the subsoil under certain sec-
tions of the foundation is not in contact with the base of the foundation,
a beam or slab action may take place considering the external force to con-
sist of a single concentrated load of 11,000 pounds and the beam or slab
to have both ends fixed or to have one end fixed and one end free. It is
self-evident that several assumptions may be made relative to pressure
on the subsoil, the condition of the subsoil beneath the concrete founda-
tion, the distribution of the external forces, and impact forces.
Although data is meagre upon which to design concrete founda-
tions, nevertheless it is high time that a concrete foundation should be
looked upon as a structure and designed as far as possible according to
the methods now used in designing other structures. The design of the
foundation is particularly complicated due to lack of knowledge per-
taining to the distribution of the load through the concrete, the pressure
on the subgrade supporting the foundation, and the manner in which the
concrete foundation acts as a structure. It is apparent, however, that a
series of assumptions may be made upon which the design of the con-
crete foundation may be used, and that the results may be used as a guide
to determine the composition and depth of the foundation.
The highway transport engineer or manager can neither assume that
drainage systems and foundations have been scientifically designed nor
that these important elements of a highway have been constructed in
accordance with practice based on service tests. Highway transport lit-
erature contains many references to cases where motor trucks have become
mired in poorly drained roadways or have broken through wearing courses
supported by weak foundations. When the transport survey is made, care
should be taken to determine, by inquiries along the route, the ability of the
roadway to carry heavy loads during the spring especially. It is well to keep
constantly in mind that an ideal roadway surface is not necessarily an indi-
cation that the drainage system and foundations are suitble for motor truck
traffic. From the foregoing discussion it will be seen that poor drainage
and weak foundations on a section of a transportation route may readily
wreck a highway transport business or at least require the charging of
higher rates to cover increased cost of operation.
Grades. Only general deductions may be made pertaining to require-
ments relative to grades for motor transport. Unfortunately little data is
at hand covering the relative efficiency of truck transportation over various


grades on different types of roadway surfaces. Of course, the general
deduction may be made that the cost of haulage varies directly with an
increase in grade and that the tonnage which can be economically hauled
varies inversely with an increase in grade. In all probability the present
fundamentals of grade design will not be modified until sufficient data has
been accumulated to demonstrate that present practices are uneconomical
either from the standpoint of motor" transport or the maintenance of the
roadway. The cost items relative to tires, grease, oil, gasoline, and lost time
period, and probably depreciation and maintenance will be increased by
material grades on transport routes. General allowance can be made but
close estimates are impracticable unless the transport engineer has bed expe-
rience with exactly the same conditions which he encounters on a new route.
Widths of Roadway and Shoulders. Roadways economically designed
must provide for carrying the traffic on the paved roadway surface and not
rely upon earth shoulders to carry a part of the traffic or serve as turn-
outs. It has been demonstrated that the latter practice is not economical
from the standpoint of the maintenance of the pavement or shoulders nor
is it efficient or safe from the standpoint of traffic using the highway. In
order that a two traffic line highway should be satisfactory for all classes of
vehicular traffic, it will be necessary to follow English interurban traffic
practice which requires that slow moving, or in this case commercial traf-
fic, shall keep to the side of the roadway. It is, however, obvious that a
heavy motor truck operator will insist upon allowing a certain amount of
leeway between the outside wheels of the truck and the edge of the road-
way, as many operators have had unfortunate experiences with motor trucks
being stalled in soft shoulders or ditched. From observations of commer-
cial traffic made on many highways outside of municipalities, it is the writ-
er's conclusion that it will be necessary to allow at least a foot clearance
between the body of the truck and the edge of the paved roadway. Further-
more, these observations indicate that motor truck drivers, travelling at
speeds from ten to fifteen miles an hour, will endeavor to maintain a clear-
ance of two feet between passing vehicles. A compilation of the maximum
width of 8 feet for each of two trucks and the clearances suggested indi-
cates that a minimum of 20 feet for two lines of traffic is a conservative
recommendation. It should be observed that the county highways of Eng-
land and the nationa routes of France have been constructed with roadways
having widths of not less than 20 feet for many years. If the transporta-
tion survey indicates that the amount of traffic will require provision for
more than two lines of vehicles, a greater width than 20 feet should be
adopted, the additional width depending upon the character of the traffic.
It does not require much imagination to reach the conclusion that many
inter-urban highways will be subjected, during the next decade, to traffic
which will necessitate roadways sufficiently wide to accommodate at least
to lines of motor trucks and two lines of passenger cars.
The above discussion indicates that highway transport investigators
will do well to give careful thought to widths of roadways on a proposed
route. On a narrow roadway, say from nine to fourteen feet, there ill be, in


many cases, continual danger of running onto earth shoulders with resultant
serious loss of time if the truck should become stuck in soft material.
Furthermore, a given width of roadway is able to carry a certain maxi-
mum traffic. As this limiting amount of traffic is approached or exceeded,
there will be serious loss of time due to congestion of vehicles. The cost
item of lost time, therefore, may be materially increased due to narrow
and inadequate roadways existing on a given transport route.
Curves. Motor vehicle traffic has effected a decided improvement in
the design of highway curves especially in the direction of the easing
of sharp curves, provisions for clear sight around curves and the bank-
ing of roadways. The importance of these details will be accentuated
by the development of motor truck traffic. Many routes have so many
sharp turns, that this element of highways may effect economic transport
through lost time in negotiating such turns, increased wear of tires, and
possible depreciation and maintenance due to collisions or other acci-
dents.
Roadway Wearing Courses. The forces due to motor truck traffic,
which should be given consideration in the selection of a roadway wear-
ing course, are the direct load causing compression in the wearing sur-
face, impact forces, and shearing forces of the driving wheels, the amount
of which will be a function of the weight of the vehicle and the speed at
which it travels. If all of these forces have not been given proper con-
sideration, the wearing course will wear rapidly or will disintegrate. The
wearing course is of particular interest to motor truck users because of
the variations in resistence to traction on different types of roadway sur-
faces. Statistics are meagre relative to traction, especially as concerns
motor trucks. Investigations made to date are merely a drop in the bucket
as compared with the amount of research which should be undertaken in
order to have reliable data available. At the present time, only the most
general conclusions can be drawn as was the case with the tests carried
on by the White Company cited above.
Highway transport interests should give careful consideration to the
effect of motor trucks due to travel on different types of roadway wear-
ing courses. The mistake is too often made of considering wearing
courses in their ideal state or during the first six months after comple-
tion. All types wear under traffic and hence the character of the surface
of a roadway after two to five years life is generally more important than
its condition upon completion of an improvement. Not only is resist-
ence to traffic increased as the surface becomes worn but furthermore,
the effect on the motor truck through impact forces caused by travel on
rigid monolithic pavements will result in a material advance in deprecia-
tion and maintenance charges.
Bridges. A bridge is an integral part of a highway. It is to be
regretted that this fact usually has not been recognized by law makers.
Many highways are built of sufficient strength to carry the motor traffic
to which they are subjected while the bridges are so weak that their con-
dition prevents the use of the highway by a part of the motor truck traf-


fie. Many citations may be given of highways which have had to be
abandoned as commercial transportation routes due solely to the weak
conditions of the bridges. One reason for this condition is that many
state laws provide for the construction and maintenance of roadways by
the state, while the bridges are under the jurisdiction of counties or towns.
It is self-evident that bridges of trunk highways connecting municipali-
ties should be designed for loads of not less than 30,000 pounds and it
would appear advisable, considering the character of the structure, to fol-
low the practice of the Pennsylvania State Highway Department and
design highway bridges for loads of 40,000 pounds. The clear width of
the roadway of a bridge should comply with the requirements pertaining
to roadway width cited above. In addition, the vertical clearance should
be given consideration and in this connection the overall height of 12 feet
2 inches for motor trucks heretofore mentioned should receive attention.
This is an important factor, not only in the design through truss bridges
_but likewise in providing for clearance underneath railway bridges.
Highway transport companies should thoroughly investigate permiss-
able loads, clearances and roadway widths of highway bridges on trans-
portation routes. Many instances have come to the attention of the writer
where bridge load limits of two or three tons have occurred on highways
whose surfaces are capable of carrying five-ton motor truck traffic.
English Practice. A discussion of the relation of highways to operat-
ing cost would be incomplete without reference to the large fund of gen-
eral information which may be found in the motor truck literature of
England, where highway transport outside of municipalities has bjeen
under development for several decades. The status of motor transport
in England in 1909 is aptly described in the following statement by Col.
R. E. Crompton, M. Inst. C. E. "Although our roads came first, and
their development occupied the best thoughts of our leading engineers at
the time of Telford, when railways were introduced road development took
a second place until recently, when it was seen that the general intro-
duction of motor vehicles was rapidly bringing back the roads into favor,
not only for carrying passengers and distributing materials for short
runs, but to act as feeders to the railways, and in many cases to become
rivals to the railways themselves for short hauls, or, in fact, in all cases
where economies in the terminal charges and in the packing of goods,
especially those of a perishable character, can be effected by these goods
being loaded at the starting point into a vehicle which carries direct to
the consumer without transhipment or intermediate handling. The eco-
nomical advantages of this last consideration are so great that many busi-
ness firms have now found that they prefer to deliver direct in their own
vehicles goods which they had hitherto to send by their horse-drawn vehi-
cles to the railway stations and which had to be twice transferred, first
from their vehicles on to those of the railway, and again from the rail-
way vehicle to the railway's vans. A study of the statistics of increase of
traffic on roads radiating distances of at least thirty miles from our large
business centers has shown us that, as the vehicles and as the roads them-
selves are improved, this radius of direct haulage is likely to increase, and


will probably have a very important effect on the distribution of the pop-
ulation, and must with absolute certainty be reckoned with in consider-
ing all questions of construction and upkeep of the roads themselves."
Conclusion. The foregoing discussion indicates that the probable
cost of transport over highways outside of municipalities is not suscep-
tible of an exact mathematical analysis. Although this situation is far
from satisfactory, it does not mean that highway transport should not be
based on as definite analysis a s our present fund of information and
experience warrants. The interrelationship between highways and the
cost of highway transport is so interwoven and complex that many high-
way transport managers have literally thrown up their hands and simply
taken a chance upon the results to be secured from organizing transpor-
tation companies. Based on the meagre investigations made to date-.,
taken in combination with the combined experience of English and Amer-
ican Highway Transport authorities and highway engineers, it is evident
that certain general conclusions may be drawn as a result of a careful
highway transport survey for any proposed transportation business. A
consideration of these deductions will usually warrant the installation of
a highway transport business or the positive rejection of the preposition.
This is particularly true when it is considered that the installation of
highway transport in a given community should not be based on a narrow
margin of profit. There are too many uncertain factors, such as competi-
tion with other transport companies and common carriers by rail and
water, state regulations pertaining to weights, dimensions and speeds of
motor trucks, legislation pertaining to licenses, franchises and rates, snow
removal practice, and variations in the volume of business, to justify a
highway transport engineer or manager figuring profits and losses from
a business stand-point in thousands of dollars and the variations in oper-
ating cost due to the several highway factors in thousandths of a cent.


COURTESY OF WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC CO.
What may be classed as one of the notable achievements of the West-
inghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company during the past year was the
completion of the largest and most powerful electric passenger locomotive
ever built.
This locomotive is one of ten being built by the Company for the Chi-
cago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad Company, to be used between Harlow-
ton, Montana, and Avery, Idaho, a distance of 440 miles or approximately
the same distance as between East Pittsburgh and New York.
These locomotives will be used in passenger service and will handle
such famous trains as the Columbian and the Olympian, which are made up
of eight to twelve steel Pullman cars. On grades similar to that of the
Pennsylvania Railroad at the Horseshoe Curve, one of these locomotives
Giant Locomotive and Persons Who Built It
will haul such a heavy train at a speed of approximately 25 miles an hour,
and on level grades will be able to attain the maximum speed of 65 to 70
miles per hour, which is the greatest speed permissible.
The construction of these monster engines presented many difficult
problems to both our Engineering Department and to the Shop, and a por-
tion of the Engineering Department was actually moved down to the rail-
way shop so that they could give immediate attention to all items requiring
engineering information. In other words, it placed the draftsmen and the
engineers right on the job so that the shop force could be advised of the va-
rious questions as they arose, without losing time in making up drawings.
In this manner, the production of this locomotive was materially hastened.
More than two hundred persons were directly interested in this con-
struction, and these are all shown in the illustration excepting the men on
night turn. Technical Students on the Westinghouse Graduate Student


Course did a large part of the wiring of the control mechanism with its in-
finitude of contactors, relays, cutouts, and various safety devices.
Following is a table of the sizes and ratings of these locomotives:
Classification 4-6-2-2-6-4
Total Weight of Locomotive . .275 tons
Weight on Driving Wheels 336,000 pounds
Number of Driving Axles 6
Weight on Leading Bogie Truck 66,000 pounds
Weight on Trailing Pony Truck 41,000 pounds
Total Wheel Base 79 ft., 10 in.
Driving Wheel Base 16 ft. 9 in.
Rigid Wheel Base 16 ft., 9 in.
Diameter of Driving Wheels 68 inches
Diameter, Bogie and Trailer Wheels 36 inches
Capacity—One Hour Rating 42,000 Horsepower
Tractive Effort—One Hour Rating 66,000 pounds
Height from Rail to Top of Cab 14 ft, 6 in.
Height from Rail to Top of Locked Paritagraph 16 ft., 7% in.
Service Capacity:—One of these engines will alone handle the largest
transcontinental trains over the electrified sections between Eastern Mon-
tana and the Pacific Coast, including the intervening mountain ranges.
One of the problems encountered was that of placing the cab with its
equipment upon trucks and special lifting devices were necessary whereby
three cranes could be used at one time. This was one of the most intricate,
if not the heaviest lift that ha^ ever been made.
It has been asked, "What are the advantages of the Electric Locomo-
tive over the Steam Locomotive?" Briefly, this is the answer:
To operate heavy trains at higher average speeds is the object sought
for by progressive railroad men. The application of heavier and more pow-
erful locomotive equipment is necessary. To supply this, with the estab-
lished reliability and safety of operation, with a lessened destruction of
rails and roadbed, and with even more pleasant working conditions for the
operatives, was the problem solved by our engineers and Works in building
this great locomotive. It represents the present maximum in single cab
construction, carrying within one room, with the exception of the main
motors themselves, all control and auxiliary equipment including a vertical
tube train heating steam boiler with water and fuel oil storage tanks. Full
road clearances were used and wheels, running gear and equalization ar-
rangements were adopted such as would not impose undue concentration
of weight on the track, either vertically or longitudinally. All engine parts
and equipment are fully spring-borne with the exception of axles, wheels
and journal boxes. The power is transmitted to the driving wheels through
a non-friction spring drive.
The result is an engine—the most powerful in passenger service in the
world—with unexcelled tracking qualities, flexible and easy on the track
and capable of hauling the heaviest transcontinental passenger trains at
the highest permissible speeds.

EDITORIAL
"Reconstruction" was a mighty fine word about a year ago.
We were to be a glorious, sovereign nation, the ideal of
ur o cy the world, so our orators promised us. Now, however, that
same word has a rather bitter and disquieting ring. It has
come to be synonymous with industrial unrest.
During the war we cooperated; now we have gone back to our plants
or offices or class rooms to further our own interests. We are leaving the
problems of reconstruction to politicians. However, we grew at least tem-
porarily acutely interested when coal ceased to arrive for a short time last
winter and when we had to plan what to do in case the threatened trans-
portation strike should become a reality.
Realizing that no organization or individual allied with the engineering
profession has the right to remain passive while his country is in need of
such assistance as can be rendered, the Michigan Technic has reconstruct-
ed its editorial policy. The fostering of the cooperation of engineers, engi-


neering students and engineering organizations for service to their country
is the keystone of its new purpose. To do this, the Technic will try to
impress upon American engineers the means whereby they can aid their
country in the solution of its industrial problems and to show the students
of engineering how they can best fit themselves to take their proper places in
reconstructing the nation.
The Technic will strive to continue to publish valuable articles dealing
with research work and to serve as a medium for campus and department
organizations.
The editors of the Technic hope that their new policy will be favor-
ably received, and that the desire of its readers to cooperate for the common
good will be shown by numerous unsolicited articles and suggestions.
Cultural work means dollars and cents to the engineer.
Cultural Work vs This is the message to engineering students from men who
Earning Capacity have "been through the mill" of the profession.
"They simply can't get engineers who have had even
the basis of a cultural education, no matter how much money they are will-
ing to pay," states Dean Cooley, referring to industrial executives who at-
tempt to fill engineering positions requiring some cultural knowledge.
"All recognize the fact that if we engineers were better acquainted with
banking, accountancy, administration, salesmanship and law, that we could
get ahead faster." This statement appears in an editorial of the "Profes-
sional Engineer."
"The 'ceiling' of an engineer is too frequently fixed by the fact that
outlook is too narrow to allow him to step to the higher positions that are
awaiting him," laments Prof. Bailey in answering the question of what a
college should do for a student.
Dean Butts states that the faculty is considering modifying the curric-
ula so that more cultural work may be taken. However, he states that the
trouble comes in convincing the student himself of the value of the less
technical courses.
Now is the time for Michigan students to determine whether they wish
to run the risk of stunting their careers in order to get into their field a year
earlier. Your professors, speaking from experience, tell you that a few more
cultural courses will be more dollars and cents to you—and lots of it. Let
a broader education enlarge your field of endeavor.
Much lias been written and more said in favor of broader
Greater Service— education, hence greater usefulness, of the engineer. All
Oreater Reward recognize that if we engineers were somewhat acquainted
with banking, accountancy, management, salesmanship, and
law that we could get ahead faster. Instead of having our field limited to
one of the junior positions when engineering work becomes slack, we should
branch out in a related field of endeavor.
Some bewail the fact that engineers are leaving the profession in such
large numbers these days for better paying positions in the commercial field.
Why not sing a Hosanna? If the business world finds the engineer useful
with his meagre training in its mysteries, why not twice as useful with a


business education? Instead of limiting the supply of engineers, why not
make engineering service more fluid, more useful? Never mind the supply increase the demand.
The colleges have been quite busy in supplying technical knowledge to
the undergraduates and have found little time for the broad studies of eco-
nomics, psychology, history, and English, let alone such important subjects,
non-technical in character, as enumerated above which would make the engi-
neer a business asset. It also should be borne in mind that such subjects
as management, accountancy, finance, and law can be better approached
when the mind is a little more mature than in undergraduate days.
The national Executive Committee at its meeting on January 10th called
upon the Committee on Engineering Education, of which Professor Frederic
Bass is chairman, to make a preliminary report on the feasibility of en ex-
tension course in such subjects as management, accountancy, law, and fi-
nance under the auspices of A. A. E. If this undertaking has the promise
and is of the magnitude that those who have studied it in a preliminary way
believe it is, the report might well come before the annual convention for
authority for development.
Possibly the extension course might be so designed as to be taken by
the young man who has just graduated, a postgraduate home study course
supplemental to his college training. A study habit is then well defined and
plenty of time is usually available. Most engineers in practice know full
well that if they had worked half as hard in the two to five years following
graduation as they did in school or after they had been out ten years, that
later work might be more fruitful and less arduous. Obviously the course
could be taken by any engineer who had the time.
Why not make engineering service more useful and more fluid? How
better can it be done than by such an extension course as outlined above?
—Professional Engineer.
At last the Michigan legislature has passed a law requiring
The Engineer that only men whose ability as engineers has been favorably
Licence Law passed on by a state board of examination may engage in
construction work of a public nature.
The passage of this bill marks the opening of a new era in the profes-
sion of engineering in Michigan. A distinction has been recognized between
the practical man of limited training and the graduate of a recognized engi-
neering school. The provisions of the new statute should discourage the
employment of men who pose as "engineers" and lower the prestige of that
profession.
The bill requires that anyone designating himself as an architect or
engineer must have been registered by a state board created by the same
measure. An applicant for registration must have had six years experience
under able employers, or must have a diploma from a technical school and
two years of experience.
For a number of years the Technic has advocated the passage of a
bill of this nature and feels confident that its efforts, combined with those
of the faculty, especially Prof. C. T. Johnston, have accomplished a perma-
nent and important step in elevating the profession.


ARTHUR J. STOCK, '22, Editor
FACULTY CONSIDERING PLANS
FOR FIVE YEAR COURSE
Believing that the present success of
Michigan graduates is due to their ability
to solve any general engineering problem
that may confront them while engaged in
special work, the faculty of the College of
Engineering is preparing a new curriculum
in order that the future Michigan gradu-
ate may be even better fitted to be an all-
round engineer rather than a specialist.
"There have been several faculty meet-
ings to consider what changes shall be
made, but the definite courses have not yet
been determined,'' states Assistant Dean
Butts. "What the world needs is less of a
mechanical or civil or chemical engineer
and more of a man equipped to handle
problems of the community as well as of
his plant.
"Engineers are realizing that there ex-
ists a place for them in the solution of
present economic problems. The new age
is a broadening one to which we believe
our present selection of studies is not as
adaptable as the one we are preparing.
Although I am not yet able to say positively
at present, yet it seems probable that fewer
of the higher courses in the various branch-
es of engineering will be required and that
more cultural work and courses in other
branches of engineering will be substituted.
It may amount to enlarging the number of
group options."
When asked whether the prospective
change would effect only the new students
who enter after its adoption. Professor
Butts replied that that would probably be
the case, although present students might
be given the opportunity to make a choice
between the old and"the new programs.
UNIVERSITY EMPLOYMENT
BUREAU IS CREATED
Until recently there has not been a sys-
tem of recording announcements of open
positions which come into the Engineer-
ing College continually from manufactur-
ing firms and contractors throughout the
country. Now, however, due to Prof. An-
derson's suggestion, a system has been
adopted.
Asst. Prof. Micklc is the head of what
might be called the Engineering Employ-
ment Bureau. All correspondence concern-
ing vacant positions is now turned over to
Prof. Mickle, who keeps an accurate file of
them, and is able to answer queries for
positions without much hesitation.
The merits of this system are twofold;
they give the students the full list of open
places, and save the time of other instruct-
ors who were often bothered with inquiries
concerning employment.
This consolidation came just in time to


67
help the February graduate and, as quite a
number of fine positions were listed, the
out-going men realized the importance of
this new system and benefited by it.
interesting as well as instructive, and was
greatly enjoyed by the class.
MICHIGAN ENGINEERING SOCIETY
HOLDS MEETING AT LANSING
Several Michigan professors attended the
Forty-first annual meeting of the Michigan
Engineering Society held at Lansing, Jan.
28, 29, 30. It is probable that this will be
the last meeting the Society, since a new
constitution drawn up at the meeting and
now being balloted upon provides that the
Society shall become the Michigan chapter
of the American Association of Engineers.
Professors Blanchard, Higbie and Johnston
addressed the meeting.
EX-SERVICE MEN SUCCEED
A number of Ex-service men sent here
by the government are now classified as
first year students. Very few failures were
reported among them, d,ue to the earnest-
ness with which they pursued their courses,
according to Prof. Butts.
Almost all the special students who were
allowed to enter the University last fall
without the equivalent of a high school
diploma have done well in their first se-
mester's work. Students who had been in
service from one to two years and were un-
willing to return to a high school were al-
lowed to take the elementary courses in
mathematics and pre-engineering work,
upon the completion of which they will
be rated as freshmen.
LIEUTENANT-COMMANDER SPEAKS
TO FRESHMEN
Lieutenant-Commander Schneider, '02,
spoke before the Freshman class at its
weekly assembly on the fourteenth of Jan-
uary. Lieutenant Schneider has been sta-
tioned in the Samoan Islands for some
years, being in charge of construction
work for the Navy Department, which gov-
erns the islands. He related several ex-
periences he has had in the Samoan group,
some of them being very amusing, and
also described the islands, their inhabi-
tants and customs. The talk was highly
E. H. LESLIE ENGAGED AS PRO-
FESSOR OF CHEMICAL
ENGINEERING
Professor E. H. Leslie, who has just
arrived at the University to commence his
duties in the Department of Chemical En-
gineering, comes from the U. S. Industrial
Alcohol Company. This is a large cor-
poration manufacturing alcohol and a va-
riety of organic chemicals. Prior to that
he was in charge of refinery development
work for the General Petroleum Corpora-
tion of Los Angeles. In that connection
he designed and supervised the initial in-
stallations of the plants built for the United
States Army which produced toluol for
T. N. T. from Californian petroleum.
Dr. Leslie obtained his undergraduate
training at the University of Illinois and
during his senior year there he was colonel
of the cadet regiment. After graduating
he spent three years in graduate work at
.Columbia University, receiving the Degree
of Doctor of Philosophy. His special study
was alone the line of petroleum decomposi-
tion and gas manufacture.
Professor Leslie will handle the courses
in Illuminating and Fuel Gas Manufacture
and other specialized courses in organic
chemistry.
OUTLOOK FOR BASEBALL IS
BRIGHT
Michigan will play some of the strongest
teams of the conference and south this
year. The team will take a trip south as
usual, and will meet the University of
Kentucky first. The other teams played
will be the Alabama Polytechnic Institute,
the University of Georgia and the Vander-
bilt University, which always has had an
exceptionally strong team.
There are eight conference teams which
will be played during the month of May
and the first week of June. It is expected
that another game will be arranged with
M. A. C. and perhaps two with Notre
Dame.

SWIMMING TO BE A VARSITY
SPORT
In the past swimming was only an in-
formal sport at Michigan. We had many
good swimmers among us, but they had no
chance to show what they could accom-
plish.
Last fall, a team was gathered together
and put to work under Coach Drulard.
The work was entirely unofficial, as swim-
ming was not then a Varsity sport. Peti-
tion was brought before*the Board of Ath-
letic Control in January, to recognize the
sport, to award numerals for men on
class teams and letters for men on the Var-
sity.
Varsity meets have been held, among
them, one with the Junior College of De-
troit. Others are being planned, and
swimming should soon take its proper
place among official Michigan sports.
NAVAL DEPARTMENT COMPLETES
IMPORTANT WORK FOR THE
GOVERNMENT
Additional work in testing models for
the Emergency Fleet Corporation is being
done by men in the marine engineering
department. During the war it was the
policy of the Corporation to allow each
shipyard to build the particular type of
cargo steamer with which it was familiar.
These ships were not always of the best
shape for easy driving, but the necessity
of a large output made it advisable to con-
tinue to produce them.
After the armistice was signed the press-
ure upon production was relieved some-
what and more emphasis was placed upon
the best form for easy driving. The Emer-
gency Fleet Corporation requested the De-
partment of Naval Architecture to carry
out tests upon a certain form in order
that the best combination of bow and stern
might be determined.
A certain bow was tried with eight dif-
ferent sterns. The naval tank of the Uni-
versity is especially well adapted to this
type of experiment as it uses wax models
and it is comparatively easy to modify the
shape at any desired place by cutting away
or padding out. Upon the satisfactory com-
pletion of these tests the Corporation con-
tinued its work until 26 models had been
tested at four different drafts each. Im-
portant data is being worked up and fur-
ther experiments are being planned by the
University to cover the field completely.
SCOPE OF FOUNDRY ENLARGED
In keeping with the present international
tendency of changing the old order for a
new and better, comes the decision of the
Eng. College that a revision in the curri-
cula of the Shops is necessary. The for-
mer classification includes Pattern Making
under Shop No. 3; the new classification
places Pattern Making in with Shop I, the
wood shop, and leaves Foundry alone as
Shop 3. Of course pattern making and
casting go together but in order to follow
out the new plan and aim of the Foundry
course it was thought best to adopt the
latter schedule.
The Foundry work will cover the regu-
lar period of four hours per week for the
semester, but will go deeper into the cast-
ing problem. The endeavor being to al-
low as much time for research work and
experimentation as possible. It is Professor
Airey's plan to do research for oi'tside in-
terests. This will lessen the routine and


69
drudgery of the present system and also
give the students a larger insight of the
scope of casting and foundry work.
SIGNAL CORPS LABORATORY
The laboratory of the Signal Corps unit
of the R. O. T. C. is in room ros, New
Engineering Building. The equipment on
hand at present is, principally, that which
was used for field communication in
France. This consists of telegraph, tele-
phone and radio equipment, signal lamps,
etc. The radio equipment is more exten-
sive than any other as this branch of the
service of communication is becoming of
increasing importance and will probably
in the next war supplant, to a large extent,
the use of wire.
The only transmitter in use at the pres-
ent time is an undamped wave set send-
ing at 825 Meters. In a few days, how-
ever, a spark set will be in operation on a
wave length somewhere between 400 and
800 Meters.
In addition to this, considerable experi-
menting has been done with the Wireless
Telephone. These signals can be picked
up by any damped wave set at about 685
Meters. Any student who is interested in
this apparatus and would like to inspect it
is at perfect liberty to visit the laboratory.
Arrangements should be made with Cap-
tain Lucas in Room 239.
THE PYROMETRIC COURSE AND
LABORATORY
The department of Chemical Engineer-
ing has recognized for many years that
most of its students, particularly those in
the metallurgical groups, would early after
graduation come in contact with pyromet-
ric practice. To this end the course on
fuel utilization (Ch. E. 2.) has considered
the subject of pyrometry to some extent,
but not until the year 1918-1919 was an
advanced course in pyrometry (Ch. E. 24)
offered. In this respect, Michigan was be-
hind Purdue, M. I. T., Columbia pud other
Universities for these were already offer-
ing pyrometric courses having completely
equipped laboratory facilities.
As first inaugurated the course after giv-
ing the necessary theoretical background
became of a descriptive nature. This method
was open to the serious objection that it
gave the student no practice in the art of
conducting heat measurements, nor did a
description of recording and automatic con-
trol devises give the student a working
knowledge of these instruments or an
ability to use them. Since descriptive mat-
ter, however, well presented does not make
up for lack of practice, a laboratory be-
came an immediate necessity.
During the present year the much needed
equipment was obtained and the labora-
tory will be in service after the present
semester. Among the more important pieces
of apparatus which will be installed, might
be mentioned, Morse and Wanner optical
pyrometers, a recording pyrometer of the
potentiometer type, transformation point
apparatus, precision, portable and students
potentometers, pyrovolter, milivoltmeter py-
rometers of various makes, many types of
thermocouples and the necessary furnaces.
With this installation and the accessories
together with the furnace installation for
the metallurgical processes student will
have an excellent opportunity to study py-
rometry under both theoretical and practi-
cal conditions.
This laboratory work will consist in the
calibration of millivoltmeters, thermocou-
ples and optical pyrometers. Testing of
the recording instruments together with
care, repair and calibration of all instru-
ments and installations, will follow pre-
liminary electrical measurements. To help
students in metallurgical work they will
also determine the recalesence points of
several different steels.
The only prerequisite courses are Ch. E.'
2 and either Ch. E. 6 or 25.

About 70 new students were enrolled at
the beginning of the second semester. This
is a larger number than in any previous
year, save in 1919, when 90 students, most
of whom were in national service, regis-
tered in the College of Engineering.
A resume of the progress made during
the presidency of H. B. Hutchins is being


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC

University.
Professor Sadler is on a technical com-
mittee of the American Bureau of Ship-
ping. The object of this committee is to
form some sort of a classification of ves-
sels.
NEW AUTO LABORATORY READY
FOR USE
A new Automobile Laboratory has been
added to the list of laboratories at Michi-
gan so that men may obtain a thorough
knowledge of the most modern machine of
travel; of all its ailments and remedies,
and of its construction and parts. It is
equipped with the most up-to-date ma-
chines and testers. Some are outside prod-
ucts, but quite a few are the result of the
inventive genius of some of Michigan's
auto experts. As yet all that equipment
is not installed, but enough is in place so
that the Laboratory may be opened for re-
search along a few lines of the automo-
bile engineering.
The Laboratory is in the building which
was built and occupied as a store house and
practical laboratory for the signal corps of
section B of the S. A. T. C, and is just
north of the Engineering Building, making
it convenient for those taking the course
to go and come from their other classes.
Plans for the placing of the equipment
have been developed after long and care-
ful study of the uses to be made and con-
venience and efficiency of the machine in
question. Men well versed in the automo-
bile line have been interviewed and their
ideas and plans obtained. Little sugges-
tions and hints have been collected and
formed into one general plan. The com-
plete laboratory will be a model after
which all laboratories trying for efficiency,
small space and convenience will be plan-
ned.
By careful arrangement the same tester,
can be used on three or four motors with-
out removing the motors from their bases.
This change can be accomplished in from
five to seven minutes.
There are two dynamometers, about
twenty-five feet apart, one a 90-horse power
Diehl, the other an 100-horse power
Sprage, each mounted on a ball bearing
turnable base. Arranged in a semi-circle
around each dynamometer are four con-
crete bases for the engines that are to be
tested. The blocks are about four or five
feet from the dynamometers. A rhaft with
two universial joints is to connect the en-
gine with the tester. A complete switch
board, within easy reading and operating
distance, controls the dynamometer.
Two large drums, connected by a shaft,
and mounted on a ball bearing pedestal,
bearings set so that the tops of the drums
come even with the floor, are another part
of the equipment. These drums can also
be connected to the dynamometers through
two transmissions. The idea being to put
the rear wheels of an auto in contact with
the tops of the drums, and thus determine
the power actually applied to the load.
This new laboratory will also furnish
the means for a great deal of interesting
research along the gas engine line. Pos-
sibly a new engine will be evolved that will
supplant those now in use. Anyway the
equipment is now ready to be used.
DEAN COOLEY FAVORS MORE
CULTURAL ELECTIVES
"Beware of over-specialization" is the
warning of Dean M. E. Cooley to engineer-
ing students. Most of the truly important
men in the profession are those who have
had a well-rounded training in place of the
usual strictly technical one, according to
the observations of Dr. Cooley.
Why do so many of the prominent tech-
nical schools turn out men apparently un-
fitted to assume positions of high respon-
sibility in industry and in community life?
Dean Cooley has numerous answers to this
question, chief of which is that the student
is so anxious to start making money out
of engineering that he blights his future
by attempting to fit himself for his work
in but four years of college, most of whicn
is spent along some special branch of en-
gineering.
Although a classical education including


7«
Greek, Latin and a modern language and
ancient and modern history may seem
wholly unconnected with strength and re-
sistance of materials, Dean Cooley believes
that these form an ideal foundation for an
engineering career. This work, started in
the high school, should be continued dur-
ing the college course along with the en-
gineering courses.
There is a great demand for engineers
for the higher salaried positions and this
demand is felt in all branches of the pro-
fession. This reacts to cause graduates to
forsake positions as instructors to fill
places offering greater pecuniary reward.
Moreover, reports of especially desirable
positions tempt undergraduates to seek to
obtain a degree in a minimum amount of
time, sacrificing in their haste the broad-
ening courses that would better fit them
for positions of responsibility in later life.
Dean Cooley points out that it is un-
doubtably true that some men slight the
more cultural work and still achieve more
than the average success. However, he
emphasizes that much more often the time
comes when a man has laboriously climbed
the lower rungs of his ladder and he is
thwarted in achieving greater success by
lack of that training enjoyed oy the men
among whom he must mingle.
PROP. PAWLOWSKI RETURNS
Prof. F. W. Pawlowski, head of the
aeronautical department, has returned to
the University following several months
spent in research work for the Polish gov-
ernment. Prof. Pawlowski will give
courses in general aviation, theory of avia-
tion, design of airplane motors, theory and
design of propellers and aero dynamics.
About 12 students have elected a straight
aeronautical course besides many students
from other departments who are electing
one or more of the courses.
BIG GUN COMING TO MICHIGAN
The Coast Artillery Division of the
Michigan R. O. T. C, under Capt. Arthur,
has received notice of the shipment of
material which was ordered some time ago.
When this arrives and is installed, those
taking the course will have a full set of
equipment with which to work. The equip-
ment includes: a 150 mm gun G. P. F. (long
rifle); two trucks; and a complete fire
control installation, which includes mate-
rial for both plotting room and observa-
tion station with the exception that azimuth
instruments will be used in place of the
usual position-finding instruments. The gun
is mounted on a rubber tired carrage with
a split tail, and it is the best intermediate
type used in the Great War. All the equip-
ment will be installed in the Mold loft
except the gun which will be housed in the
rear of the Engineering Building.
Experiments now being carried on by
Prof. W. E. Lay and others in the me-
chanical engineering department may do
much to revolutionize the use of fuels for
auto and other gas engines. Tests are be-
ing made on two new fuels that their value
may be compared to that of gasoline and
kerosene.
Research work is also being done on the
fact that automobiles run more smoothly
at night than in the day-time.

SEWARD N. LAWSON, '21, Editor
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW
"What are those large iron things?"
asked the young lady who was being shown
through the railway shops.
"Those are the locomotive boilers," re-
plied the mechanical engineer who was do-
ing the honors.
"What do they boil a locomotive for?"
was the next query.
And the answer came, "Why, to make
the engine tender."
A FAVORITE WITH THE UTS
22 Lit: "Ever read Spinoza?"
22 Eng: "Nope, never cared much for
them Mexican authors."
22 Lit: "How about Pope?"
22 Eng: "Them religious writers never
appealed to me."
22 Lit: "Have you tried Dryden?"
22 Eng: "Nix, wouldn't read any of
that prohibition literature."
22 Lit: "Surely you've read Ben John-
son?"
22 Eng: "Sure, sure. My father knows
him. He's president of the American
League.
YOU SAID IT
"Waiter bring me everything you've got
for $2.00."
"Boss, you said a mouthful."
LOTS OF WORK
"Is there an opening here for a bright,
energetic young man?"
"Yes, please close it as you go out."
"Even love itself is governed by certain
scientific principles."—Extract from prof.'s
speech.
Quite right, professor; by applying
Boyle's law we find the lower the gas
the greater the pressure."—Michigan Daily.
YELL IT
"Did you hear him, dear, when he said
that a kiss was the language of love?"
"Yes, why don't you say something?"
DID IT HURT HER?
"There was a terrible accident down in
the next block!"
"What happened?"
"An auto skidded and hit a woman in
the safety zone."
IN THE BOARDING HOUSE
She: "I want to have my room fixed up.
There is an awful draft. I think it's com-
ing in thru the key hole."
He: "All right, I'll look into that to-
night."
SOME BILL
"I went to the doctor the other day for
my cold and he put me in the bath tub
for four hours."
"What did he charge you?"
"He soaked me for $50.00."
"Ivy, why don't you cling to me," he
cried in whispers thick.
"Oh, Archibald, I will," said she, "I think
that you're a brick."
Daughter: "Oh, father, how grand it is
to be alive! The world is to good for
anything. Why isn't everyone happy?"
Father: "Who is he this time?"
The Parson: "When our ideals get above
the mercenary, then, and only then, shall
we have a perfect system -of society. The
ushers will now pass the collection boxes.
You are asked to subscribe liberally, as
the church is hard pressed just at present."
Action will remove the doubt which
theory cannot solve.—Bancroft.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
She: "I suppose you had a pleasant sea
voyage?"
He: "Oh yes, everything came out nice-
ly."—Jack-O-Lantcrn.
Burglar: "Don't be alarmed, leddy. I
shan't touch yer—all I want is yer money."
Old Maid: "Oh, go away! You are just
like all the other horrid men."—Jack-O-
Lantcrn.
"Yes," said the campus socialist, "I'm
a red-eyed radical Bolshevik, I am, Down
with classes, and up with marks."—Gar-
goyle.
"The man I met yesterday did not look
particularly intelligent and yet he told me
that he made his living by his pen."
"So he does; he raises pigs."
"I want a lower berth on the midnight
train to New York."
"No more lowers," said the clerk.
"Then I'll take an upper."
"No more uppers."
"Well, do what you can for me."
"I'm doing it now. All I can do is to
sympathize with you."
The liquor interests are trying to "knock"
real hard. They want us to take the bottles
away from the babies too.
She: "What kind of airships do they
use for reconnoitering?'
He: "Seaplanes, I suppose?''
Miss (watching aviator doing stunts
overhead): "Would you call his doing the
figure eight higher mathematics?"
Take: "Yep. Plane geometry."—Aerial
Arc.
The unlucky Marine in Russia was tell-
ing his troubles to a sympathetic friend.
"No leave, no letters, no United States,
no luck at all!"
"Never mind, you'll soon be dead."
"Yes." said the unlucky Gyrene, "and if
T was de^d now and on my way to heaven,
I'll bet T'd be brought down by the anti-
aircraft."
Methusaleh: "When is a plane not a
plane?"
Father Time: "When it's aloft."
•HIS SECOND
Pilot: "Have you ever been up before?"
Passenger: "Only one short stretch at
Blackwell's Island."
"Mother, may I go out to fly?"
"Yes, my daughter fair;
Be sure and shun the horrid sky
And don't go near the air."
"No, your honor, at least not happily."
make me give up all thought of marriage.
It will be cheaper to let her sue me for
breach of promise."
Speaking of Congress—nobody can tell
just where this peace is going to end.
A visitor at the Capitol was accompan-
ied by his small son. The little boy watch-
ed from the gallery when the House came
to order.
"Why did the minister pray for all those
men, papa?"
'He didn't. He looked 'em over and
prayed for the country."—Current Opinion.
"The great question now before us," be-
gan the ponderous constituent—
"We've got more questions on hand just
now than we really need," interrupted Sen-
ator Sorgum. "Come around with an ans-
wer once in awhile."—Washington Star.
Everything that science and art can of-
fer is the direct result of somebody's idea.
The man who can give the world one new
idea has rendered immortal service to
humanity.
About the greatest mistake that a fellow
can make in this life of ours is to be con-
tinually fearing that he will make one.
He: "What would you say if I should ask
you to marry me?"
She: "No."
He: "Then I wont ask you."—Punch
Bowl


Si
SEEING IS BELIEVING
'I should like to see any man kiss me,"
The prudish young Ypsi maid cries.
Miss Co-ed answers: "Why bless me!
Do you usually close your eyes?"
WORTH IT
Jack: "See that girl there on the beach?
She gets ten thousand dollars a year posing
for artists."
John: "That's some figure."—Lehigh
Burr.
ANY ROUND HERE
Louise: "I had a date with a baseball
pitcher the other night."
Vi: "How was he?"
Louise: "He was kinda wild." — Sun
Dial..
Lil' Bro.: "Going to the library to-
night?''
Big Bro.: "No, I have to study."
He: "Didn't your father approve of your
riding habit?"
She: "Yes, father did; but the horse
fainted."—Record.
It was just the other day,
In a fortune telling place.
A pretty maiden read my mind,
And then she slapped my face.
—Gargoyle.
I saw Esau kissing Kate
And what's more we all three saw;
For I saw Esau, he saw me,
And she saw I saw Esau.
"Dad, what's a social scale?"
"Generally speaking, son, it's a
where money is weighed."
place
Official notices received from the Secre-
tary's office have convinced us that every-
thing is going up except our marks.
'23E: "Why is a little dog in a refriger-
ator like one leg of a right triangle?"
'22E: "Because he is a purp-in-de-cool-
er."
'20E: "Everything is different around
here than what it used to be when I was
a freshman."
'20L: "Yes, except the jokes.''
Last year's freshman: "What did they
do before the law of gravity was passed?"
Have you noticed that absence makes
the marks grow rounder?
We'll never forget our college days, but
it's the nights that will furnish the most
vivid memories.
These jokes are intended primarily for
ex-service students who are used to other
privations and hardships.
A tragedy of modern life unfolds itself
forthwith:
There was once a man who was more
lonesome than he was rich. Companion-
ship he constantly craved for. As a means
of obtaining this he purchased the common
modern light vehicle of transportation that
he might have the opportunity of taking
his neighbors down to work in the morn-
ing and on pleasure trips. However, neith-
er the model of the car nor the owner's
ability as a driver were conducive to the
comfort of chance occupants. Thus one
day after the last installment had been paid
on it and it had acquired an odious repu-
tation as a rider of rocky roads, we see
the lonesome autoist bucking the road on
the lookout for someone to keep him com-
pany.
"Have a ride?" he hailed Mr. Jones.
"Uh, no. Fine day to walk, thanks?"
"Want a lift, Smith?"
"Sorry but I-I-I have an appointment."
"May I take you downtown, Mr. Stone?"
But Stone had ducked and run.
In desperation our friend hailed his
Chinese laundryman who had just rounded
the corner. Uninitiated to the wagon of
torture, the oriental accepted a ride .
An here comes the sad, sad part. (Soft
music, please.) A few blocks further on
the auto had a terrific smash-up and all that
was ever found was a crank and a washer.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
If what we don't know won't hurt us,
most of us are immune from harm.
Maybe the profs hired teamsters to do
their grading.
The system of ordering books in the Un-
iversity Library in place of taking them di-
rectly from the shelves, we understand, is
to prevent "stack losses."
"What makes your husband look so pale
and nervous, is there anything the matter?"
"Oh, just before you came, we had a
drawing to see who would fire the cook
this afternoon, and he won."
Maiden Lady: "Sir, I want you to take
back that parrott you sold me last week.
He swears very badly."
Dealer: "He's only a young bird ma'am,
he'll learn to swear better when he's a
little older."
One kind word to the living is better
than a long-drawn eulogy over the dead.
It's hard for some of us men to under-
stand when women say what they mean and
mean what they say.
"Now George," said a father, who was
famous for being close fisted, "I want to
give you a piece of advice."
"What's the matter with it?" was the re-
ply.
She: '"Home Sweet Home' is such a
beautiful song, don't you think so?"
He: "Yes, and so useful too. If it
wasn't for that song nobody would know-
to wind up a dance."
"I's from N'Yawk," said a young color-
ed soldier who had just returned from over
there, "and dose Germans sure did find us
tough customers. Why de part of N'Yawk
I come from is so touch, even the canary
birds sing bass."
Judge: (to man arrested for beating his
wife.) "Now, my man, can't you live with-
out fighting your wife?"
As the car jolted and swayed, a stout
woman standing up, lurched against a
seated passenger, knocking his hat over his
eyes. He rose and offered her his seat.
"You are very kind, sir," she said.
"Not at all," was the answer, "merely
self-defense."

THE following few pages are presented by the Architectural College as
a resume of some of its work in design, free-hand drawing and con-
struction,—confined mostly to the pictorial rather than the purely construc-
tional and constituting but one of the many phases in the training of the
architect.
It is to be regretted that many particularly commendable works are
unavailable because they have been sent to the first Congress of Architects,
Montevideo, Uruguay, and that the scarcity of printers and quality of paper
preclude much material of great interest and value.
We desire to commend to our subscribers, and especially architects,
the careful consideration of the matter contained in the advertising pages
of this number.
Lastly we wish to thank our architectural members and incidentally to
express the hope that next year even a better selection can be shown.

VALVES
L. P. COULTER, '97E.
Before considering the subject in
detail, it might be well to touch on the
subject of gate valves in general.
There are two classes of gate valves,
one known as the "inside screw type,"
and the other as the "outside screw or
yoke type." The "outside screw type"
has a screw which moves up and down
beyond the yoke and indicates approxi-
Fig. 2
Fig. i
mately the position of the valve. The
threaded stem is turned by means of
a bronze nut to which driving means is
attached.
The "inside screw" turns thru a
threaded nut seated in the valve gate
and power is applied to the stem by
means of suitable gearing between the
source of power and the stem.
A solid wedge taper seat valve is
shown in Fig. i, a tapered seated or
Fig-
disc
2, and a
valve in
double disc valve in
parallel seat double
Fig- 3-
Four different methods are applied
in the operation of gate valves, namely
manual, piston, electric and water mo-
tor. Manual control need not be con-
sidered as every one will agree that
power operation is preferable. It is
Fig. 3
used in most cases only as an auxiliary
means of control in case of failure of
power.
Piston or cylinder operated valves
are driven by either air, steam or
water, water being considered the best
medium. This type is quite simple in
construction but is not suitable for out-
door use on account of possibility of
freezing the liquid. Furthermore, it
is sometimes impractical because of


87
space limitations on account of the size
of piston required. Remote control
can only be satisfactorily obtained by
the installation of a system of electri-
cally operated control valves which
would at once suggest the advisability
of using electric operation throughout
in place of a combination of electric
and cylinder operation, thus doing
away with one source of power.
Water motor control has been used
in this country to a limited extent and
the movement of the gate valve so as
to drive it firmly but not too tightly
into its seat.
The parts required for electric drive
are a motor, a set of gears between
the motor and the valve stem, some
means of stopping at the limit, and a
control station.
Where the electric motor is used this
presents some difficulty due to the
momentum of the motor armature.
Either a very quick stop must be ob-
Fig. s
Fig. 6
it has the same limitations as piston
operation.
Electrical operation presents the fol-
lowing advantages over the other
methods:
First—Adaptability for remote con-
trol.
Second—Ease of attachment to ex-
isting valves.
Third—Not effected by freezing
temperatures.
Where power operation of any char-
acter is used, the principal problem is
to furnish a control which will limit
tained or the motor must be quickly
disengaged to prevent further travel
and jamming.
One of the systems which has been
employed uses a series motor with a
jam overload relay which operates
when the valve is jammed closed. This
relay in turn opens the main circuit
switch. Closing a valve in this man-
ner results in the necessity of a ham-
mer blow to unseat the valve. To take
care of this a jam nut is provided on
the valve stem in such a position that
the motor is up to speed before it re-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ceives the load. Due to the series motor
characteristics after unseating the
valve the motor would race to the open
position and then come to such a sud-
den stop that it frequently twisted off
the valve stem. This tendency to race
can be eliminated by use of a com-
pound wound motor in place of a
series wound motor to give a more
uniform speed of operation and still
retain the pull out characteristics of
the series motor.
On some control systems, a mag-
netically operated main switch has
been used in conjunction with a travel-
ling nut limit switch geared to the
valve and arranged to open the circuit
at each limit thru the main switch.
This arrangement requires very care-
ful and accurate adjustment to operate
satisfactory.
At present there are two types of
electric valve controls extensively used
in this country. The multi-unit drive
and the Dean system.
The multi-unit system is so named
on account of its supplying four sep-
arate units, that is to say, the motor,
limit switch, reducing gear and the
controller. Such a device is shown in
part in Figure No. 5.
The Dean system employs a com-
bination of the motor, gears and limit
switch in one unit and a control station
which can be located at any convenient
point. Application of this type of con-
trol is shown on Figure No. 6.
The advantages claimed for this
system over the multi-unit system are
as follows: 1 st. Ease of attachment to
existing valves without shutting down
the line; 2nd, does not depend upon
momentum or drift of moving parts
to seat the valve; 3rd, has ample un-
seating and seating torque; 4th, a
single unit system over a multi-unit
system; 5th, an enclosed single unit
which is also waterproof.
The method of obtaining a quick
stop and eliminating the effect of
momentum and overtravel is entirely
different from that employed on the
multi-unit system. Figures A and B
show cross sections of the reducing
gear. A planetary gear is shown in
Figure A, the external member of
which is marked I. The center pinion
is revolved by the motor and this
pinion turns the planetary pinion shaft
in the direction shown. The outer
member or internal gear is free to re-
volve on a machine surface in the
casing. It is restrained from doing so
by two plugs which also pass thru the
casing as shown. Another view of the
outside surface of the internal gear is
shown in Figure B, and this surface is
provided with two channels, extending
half way around in one direction as
shown in C, and the other in the oppo-
site direction as shown in D. With
both plugs in, the internal gear cannot
move, therefore with the sun pinion
being driven by the motor, the plane-
tary pinions must turn on their own
axes and travel around the internal
gear.
Let us assume that the valve is clos-
ing and that the plug is restraining
the movement of the internal gear
which tends to move in the direction
indicated by the arrow E as shown in
Figure A. At a predetermined mo-
ment when the valve is tightly closed,
but not jammed, this plug is quickly
withdrawn from the slot by a special
cam movement. ■ The internal gear is
free to revolve in the direction shown
since there is no friction now to re-
strain its movement. At the precise
moment of withdrawing the plug the
limit switch interrupts the electrical
circuit and the momentum of the

tion in the opposite direction before
the plug comes in contact with the
stop, therefore, allowing half a revolu-
tion of the internal gear before the
valve actually starts to operate. This
provides a light hammer blow which is
sometimes necessary on a tightly
seated valve.
The moment one of the plugs is
withdrawn the slow speed drive shaft
stops instantly thus insuring that it
case a single control station is required
the motor circuit is handled directly
on the limit switch and a relay panel
is not required. In the case of a
multi point control system, a relay
panel is required to prevent possible
short due to the operation of two or
more of the stations in opposite direc-
tions.
On both systems of control it is to
be noted that signal lamps are pro-

operation, irrespective of load or fric-
tion.
The valve gate is seated tightly
under power to a predetermined point,
an overtravel being entirely disregard-
ed as a means of seating the valve.

In the Dean system, these lamps are lit
at their corresponding limits but in the
intermediate positions both are lit.
There is a growing demand for
automatic controlled gate valves and
this subject is being given considerable
consideration by a number of engi-
neers.


INTEREST THE ENGINEER
C. T. JOHNSTON
Heretofore, engineers have been sat-
isfied to be merely workers rather than
directors of the forces which stimu-
late and support society, and in conse-
quence, they have generally been
assigned to the second table. While
they are regarded as an essential part
of the social fabric, yet they are
counted with the element that is kept
subordinate. Their professional activ-
ities extend into every community and
throughout all strata of society. Think-
ing people must now realize that engi-
neers are soon to assert themselves in
support of a properly balanced leader-
ship in the great fields of civics, in-
dustry, economics and politics.
The law-maker acts only when pub-
lic sentiment demands the recognition
of principles that underlie legislation.
Engineers have never organized thor-
oughly even in support of things tech-
nical. They have numerous societies,
but each one stands for some distinct
and independent purpose. Many engi-
neers feel that the original technical
societies have atrophied in the com-
mercial atmosphere of Xew York City.
It is said that the Hudson River is
wider than the Atlantic Ocean when
viewed from the top of the building
which houses these societies. Many
engineers feel that as long as their
destiny is directed by the element that
has been harbored for so many years
in the national metropolis, no great in-
terest will be manifested by the profes-
sion at large in the solution of the
great economic and political questions
which now seetlie in the social caldron.
Expressions of this kind disclose un-
rest, to say the least.
The Michigan Engineering Society
is moving with the current which is to
bring the great body of engineers to-
gether in support of principles that are
now strangers at the doors of our leg-
islative halls. Engineers have discov-
ered that • the individual, however
strong and courageous he may be,
plays but a small part in the great con-
flict of ideas which finds its focus at
Washington and at our state capitals.
Opinion is translated into legislation
only by the weight of numbers which
lend it support. Effective support only
comes when opinion is articulated. It
is apparent to us that the engineers of
the nation, as individuals, strongly
favor the creation of a national de-
partment of public works, assuming
that they have given the subject any
consideration. The engineer who
might voice a contrary opinion would
be looked upon as a rare curiosity.
However, individual engineers might
continue to entertain favorable opin-
ions regarding the establishment of
such a department until the sound of
the last trumpet, when Gabriel would
record them as innocuous spirits, fully
satisfied with the joy of anticipation.
The movement for a national depart-
ment of public works only assumed a
tangible form when organized groups
representing engineers and engineer-
ing, joined their voices in a common
demand.
State legislation which should in-
terest Michigan engineers at this time


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
should concern the support of prin-
ciples, measures and administrative
machinery which will ultimately be-
come unified in a state department of
public works. As we begin to take an
active part in support of these public
duties we will be asked why the engi-
neer should assume any responsibility
for the framing, enactment and ad-
ministration of the laws of the state.
Most engineers are citizens. Many
engineers fully appreciate the demand
for what might be called engineering
sentiment in connection with many
branches of state and national govern-
ment. In the absence of scientific
thought what has society substituted?
Let us go back a little in our history.
The pioneer explorers of the state who
pulled the gunter chain and carried
the unreliable compass in greater or
less proximity to our section and town-
ship lines (as science would establish
them) should have exhibited some
elementary signs of engineering abil-
ity. They were hurriedly drafted into
service because of the high fever
among land speculators. Frequently,
members of congress were stockhold-
ers in companies which exploited the
public domain. In order that surveys
might be performed to serve these
speculators, rather than the public or
the general government, the work was
let by contract and a most vicious sys-
tem developed. These surveys ignored
science in the measurement of dis-
tance, the determination of direction
and in the character of monuments
that were set. The majority of these
contract surveyors broke away from
their employers as they found attract-
ive localities for settlement when they
became the exponents of surveying for
the new communities that soon came
into being. Many of these men en-
gaged in farming, milling or store-
keeping on the side. This kind of sur-
veying has left a blight that depresses
the field of practice and sears the
minds of many who might otherwise
support better things. A state depart-
ment of public works should support a
branch which would stimulate practice
of this kind. Every existing monu-
ment would be respected and the loca-
tion of missing monuments would be
ascertained. Monuments would then
be tied together, thus giving each free-
holder definite information relative to
the location and area he owns. Monu-
ments would be of metal and each
would show on its face the corner it is
presumed to represent. Local offices
would come into being where reliable
data relative to boundary surveys
would always be available. Such a
department woul stimulate interest in
the enactment of the Torrens law for
registering land titles. It would then
become the administrator of that law.
Deeds to real estate thereafter would
have to be based on surveys made by
men competent in measurement, in the
determination of direction and in all
of the details of field operations. If a
state department of public works
housed only this branch of service the
creation of the department would be
fully warranted.
A sub-department which had to do
with boundary surveys would soon
stimulate a rational conception of
riparian boundaries and public inter-
ests in streams and lakes would soon
be defined and protected. No private
rights or interests would be invaded
yet all interests would be stabilized.
There is no beginning or end to the
sophistry applied to riparian bound-
aries as now defined. The doctrines
which support our existing administra-
tration under court control, are un-
sound, inadequate and foreign to a


93
country where public interests are pre-
sumed to have some recognition and
where private rights are supposed to
be defined and protected. In discus-
sing some current reasoning of his
time, at least ninety years ago, Macau-
lay makes the following comments:
"How it chanced that a man who rea-
soned on his premises so ably, should
assume his premises so foolishly is one
of the great mysteries of human na-
ture. The same inconsistency may be
observed in the schoolmen of the mid-
dle ages. Those writers show so much
acuteness and force of mind in argu-
ing on their wretched data, that a mod-
ern reader is perpetually at a loss to
comprehend how such minds came by
such data. Not a flaw in the super-
structure of the theory which they are
rearing escapes their vigilance. Yet
they are blind to the obvious unsound-
ness of the foundation. It is the same
with some eminent lawyers. Their
legal arguments are intellectual prod-
igies, abounding with the happiest
analogies and the most refined distinc-
tions. The principles of their arbitrary
science being once admitted, the
statute-book and the reports being
once assumed as the foundation of
reasoning, these men must be allowed
to be perfect masters of logic. But if
a question arises as to the postulates
on which their whole system rests, if
they are called upon to vindicate the
fundamental maxims of that system
which they have passed their lives in
studying, these very men often talk
the language of savages or of children.
Those who have listened to a man of
this class in his own court, and who
have witnessed the skill with which he
analyzes and digests a vast mass of
evidence, or reconciles a crowd of pre-
cedents which at first sight seem con-
tradictory, scarcely know him again
when, a few hours later, they hear him
speak on the other side of Westmin-
ister Hall in his capacity of legislator.
They can scarcely believe that the
paltry quirks which are faintly heard
through a storm of coughing, and
which do not impose upon the plainest
country gentleman, can proceed from
the sharp and vigorous intellect which
had excited their admiration under the
same roof on the same day." Because
the engineer's voice has not been heard
in the councils of government, our
courts are obliged to accept responsi-
bilities for which judges are not pre-
pared, either by training or practice.
There should be a sub-department
where water resources might be ad-
ministered. This office would have
charge of drainage, water power de-
velopment, water supplies for towns
and cities, the improvement of chan-
nels where sewage and waste products
might be cared for, the protection of
lakes and streams in behalf of that
great element of the public interested
in sport, recreation, camping and good
health. The state should give some
guarantees to those who cut ice and
store it for summer use. The lumber-
man should be able to float his logs to
market. Western states recognize this
necessity, yet logs are driven under
public supervision and the private
parties interested are held responsible
for all damage that may be done to
improvements along the banks of
streams or to structures in their chan-
nels. Private and public uses of water
will never be protected and stabilized
until they are administered by the
state. Our present government of
water resources is based largely on
misfit doctrines that have been in-
herited from the feudal days of central
Europe.
The engineer should be largely rep-


THE MICHIGAN TUCHNIC
resented on commissions which regu-
late public utilities. The Public Utility
Commission might well be a branch of
the state department of public works.
Another sub-department would be
charged with the administration of
laws relating to public safety.
The State Highway Department, of
which all engineers have reason to be
proud, would be one of the strong
branches of this department.
The state department of public
works would cooperate closely with
the State Board of Health. It would
seen become a source of inspiration
for city planning and for the protec-
tion and improvement of the scenic
features of the state. It would be
helpful to the Public Domain Commis-
sion. Out town, city and village plat
law would soon be revised and placed
under competent official direction. A
state department of public works
would find many opportunities for a
close cooperation with a national de-
partment of the same type.
A state department of public works
must be viewed wholly as a matter of
good public business. While such a
department would naturally be a great
stimulus to engineering, engineers
should support the movement in the
interest of good government. We
would weaken our position by the dis-
cussion of details of organization or
of personnel, at this time. Should
such a department be created at once,
or should it have a slow development,
we should always support the best
engineering talent for the administra-
tive places that may be provided.
These men should command the
esteem and confidence of the public
and they should be more than tech-
nicians. Not only should they know
something about the law which per-
tains to their duties, but they should
understand the laws that govern fields
of activity that are close to them. They
should know where the principles of
these laws have been derived.
A profession becomes great in the
estimation of the public when the in-
dividual members thereof manifest a
deep-seated public interest and when,
as professional men, they perform a
great and uniform service to society.
While we know that the engineer has
probably done more for the human
race than have the men of any other
single profession, engineering is in its
infancy and there are branches of our
work to which we can not point with
pride. We will not enjoy complete
public confidence and respect until we
clean up some of our professional
backyards and alleys. Since I am in
close touch with one of these depress-
ing fields of practice, I wish to tell you
what we must do before we are to have
the united support of some very im-
portant elements of Michigan society.
I have referred to boundary surveying.
You know how influential the farmers
of Michigan are at the present time
and you realize that this influence is
not to decrease. While our brethren
of the field of highway engineering
have done much to demonstrate to the
farmer that the engineer has some of
the attributes of leadership, yet more
must be done before this great element
will be willing to entrust further re-
sponsibilities to men of our profession.
When boundary surveying is properly
performed a measure of ability is re-
quired that we have failed to appre-
ciate in past years. We refer to the
surveyor as though he were some kind
of a cheap subordinate. If you will
read the early history of Virginia you
will find one George Washington
placed in a poor light by the fashion-
able element because he was a sur-


95
veyor. We must stimulate this field
and stand shoulder to shoulder in sup-
port of the best laws, the best kind of
administration and the best kind of
practice. When we stand as a unit for
better things the people we presume to
serve will gradually accept our esti-
mate of the work we perform. In-
competency runs throughout our his-
tory of boundary surveying. It is na-
tural that the freeholder is convinced
that this kind of work should be
classed with common labor. It has not
been exposed to applied science to any
great extent. Before the farmer sees
much of importance in boundary sur-
veying the practitioners must perform
some educational work. Monuments
must be found and replaced with sub-
stitutes which will endure. Each
farmer must know the area he owns.
He should not continue to pay taxes
on lands that belong to a neighbor be-
cause of errors in the original govern-
ment surveys. When a farmer dedi-
cates land to the public for highways
or for other purposes he should be
given some credit therefor. He should
certainly be relieved from taxation on
lands that he can no longer use profit-
ably. The average farmer would pre-
fer to dedicate,—that is actually trans-
fer,—lands covered by water to the
public rather than to be required to
pay taxes on unproductive areas. In
this way the public may in part regain
title to public property. The farmer
is apt to direct us to study easements
and to discover for him why he should
be imposed upon simply because some
old common law term stands as a bar-
rier to justice and progress. We
should be able to talk about riparian
boundaries without involving the dis-
cussion with obsolete sophistry from
the middle and dark ages. We will
probably have to go back and accept
some of these long-forgotten responsi-
bilities before the farmer will be ready
to say that the engineer should have a
higher place in the political life of the
state.
There are other elements of society
that may be heard from before a
unanimous demand is made for the
engineer to assume a greater measure
of leadership.
Patriotism and public interest are
synonymous in final analysis. The
engineer has been a hired man for so
long that his public interest has been
somewhat warped. However, the new
life that is now stimulating engineering
organization must direct his thoughts
along new channels. It is gratifying
to know that engineering sentiment is
growing. The engineer must accept
the minor responsibilities that now
come to him and make such a record
in the performance of the duties of
the hour that the thinking public will
be ready to accept the profession as
standing for something constructive
and definite in the field of politics and
government.

EDITORIAL
It is only fair to the architects that we explain why the
An Architec- Architectural issue has become a reality. As an integral
tural Issue part of the Colleges of Engineering and Architecture, it
seems that they have never received much publicity at the
hands of the Technic, or of any other campus publication. They were cut
off from the campus world in their own private wing of the Engineering
building, and lived a life apart. This last year or so, however, the School
of Architecture has grown by leaps and bounds. Their quarters were no
longer roomy and spacious, but grew cramped due to the large increase in
attendance. So the architects began to agitate for a new Architectural build-
ing which should give them the right working atmosphere and room to grow
in. This dream has not come true yet, but we hope that when building
prices come down the legislature will see fit to appropriate enough money
to finish the Engineering quadrangle.


President Hutchins, of the University of Michigan, is re-
Harry Burns signing this year, after nearly fifty years of service. In his
Hutchins— retirement the University loses a man whose like it may
never see again. It is almost unnecessary for us to repeat
what he has accomplished with his broadly viewed constructive policy and
progressive stand on matters pertaining to the University. It is due to him
that Michigan remains today ahead of its contemporaries in both intellectual
achievements and in outlook,—a pioneer in development and progress. To
such as he America owes her place in the world, for he was a fighter and
a builder. He was of that type of man who could conquer the obstacles
which beset the road to better and higher things, and who kept on even in
the heat of mid-day while others dallied in the shade by the roadside and
called on them to desist from their labors. He. was, and is, a chieftain of
his race, one who has left his mark so indelibly on the road of progress that
it shall not pass away, but will be transmitted to future generations and on
down to the end.
So to him the student body of the Colleges of Engineering and Archi-
tecture wish to convey their deepest regard, and even though realizing the
impotency of words, they wish him to know that he has the most profound
respect of the entire school, and hope that his years may be many, each one
filling to the brim the chalice of happiness.
The Engineering Society for some time past has played
. So let "ratner a minor Part in the affairs of the Engineering Col-
Constitutlon 'e£e- The c°l'ege has kept on growing from year to year,
and with it student branches of national engineering organ-
izations came into existence, but the general students' society did nothing
at all to promote a spirit of unity between these individual professional
societies and the student body as a whole. This may have been due some-
what to lack of initiative on the part of the officers of the Engineering
Society, but the chief reason was because the Engineering College, in en-
larging and broadening its scope, had completely outgrown the original con-
stitution of the society.
This spring, realizing the state of affairs which had grown up because
of this neglect, the officers of the society and the heads of the Technic
took the old constitution and redrafted it throughout. The object of this
revision was to bring the scope of the society up to meet the needs of the
present-day College of Engineering, and making the society better able to
cope with present problems arising in the general run of things in the school.
This new constitution provides for membership in the general society of
every student in the. Engineering College; membership in the different pro-
fessional organizations being open to upper-classmen only. Membership in
the general society includes a subscription to the Technic, so every member
of the Engineering Society and associated organizations will be a subscriber
to the Technic, which is still the official organ of the Society. It tends, in
general, to promote closer unity between the various departments of the
Engineering College, and should help greatly in the future growth and de-
velopment of the College.

SUCCESSFUL SEASON EXPECTED
AT CAMP DAVIS
Within another month. Camp Davis will
have opened for six weeks of comradeship
and instruction for the Junior Civil Engi-
neers. The camp, situated in the wilds of
Cheboygan County, on the shore of Doug-
las Lake, offers all the advantages of a
summer colony. It has its own sanitary
system, sandy beach, excellent bathing fa-
cilities, -plains, woods, and streams. Above
all else, however, it is dominated by the
spirit of Prof. J. B. Davis, its founder.
This wonderful inheritance, which pervades
the entire atmosphere, impresses itself in-
delibly upon even a casual observer. At
work or sport, the founder's optimism is
ever present.
Eighty students are expecting to attend
the camp this summer. This large number
will be more easily accommodated by last
year's addition of ten steel houses. These
cottages are built upon a principle by which
they are cool even in the hottest days and
yet warm and dry if the weather is cool
and damp.
In order to get the camp activities under
way as soon as possible, the applicants for
camp citizenship will organize themselves
into a body before leaving Ann Arboi.
Those to be elected are Camp President,
Transportation Manager, Song Leader,
Editor of the Black Fly, and Athletic Di-
rector. These officers, with suggestions
from last year's officials, will immediately
take charge of their work.
The teaching staff this year consists of:
Prof. C. T. Johnston, head of the Survey-
ing Department. Director; Prof. Gram,
Prof. King, Asst. Prof. Carey, Asst. Prof.
Brodie, Mr. Matthews, Mr. Holcomb, Mr.
Corson, Mr. Slack. In case Prof. King can-
not attend, Asst. Prof. Wisler will go in
his place. If it is impossible for him to
arrange his affairs so that he may go. Mr.
Thomas J. Mitchell who has been with the
Lake Survey for the last two years, may
be available. Dr. W. E. Forsythe, Director
of the University Health Service, will be
physician for Camp Davis and the Bio-
logical Station.
Athletic attractions are well supplied to
the camp by nature. The wonderful bath-
ing facilities, clear water, sandy beach and
the diving tower will claim the attention of
most, but other sports, including tennis,
boxing and baseball are provided for.
Among the other innumerable inducements
of the camp are occasional trout from Carp
Creek and the black flies.
At Camp Davis the students are in such
close touch with the faculty that classroom
theory in conjunction with practical work
is learned with far greater thoroughness
than is possible in Ann Arbor. The insight
into the fundamentals of surveying that is


IN MEMORIAM
Professor Emeritus Joseph B. Davis
The University owes him a debt of gratitude for the devoted service
which he rendered during the long period of thirty-eight years. His memory
will be cherished like that of other professors who have given their best years
to this institution.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
also gained in this way is of inestimable
value. Then too, the proximity of student
to instructor gives the camp citizen an
opportunity to learn the real worth of those
self-same instructors of the classroom with
whom they had but a passing acquaintance,
that they are intensely human and desire
friendship.
So it is with all this before them: the
prospects of a good time, fellowship and
some work, that the Junior Civil's will en-
train for Camp Davis.
RESULTS OF FROSH TESTS
The work of compiling and analyzing
the results of the Intelligence Tests given
to the Freshmen entering the Colleges of
Engineering and Architecture in October,
1919, is progressing as rapidly as prac-
ticable. The Committee of Mentors, to
whom was assigned the task of conducting
these tests, believes that any conclusions
or announcements of specific results from
the examinations at this time would be
premature and unwise, and they also desire
to study the results of the second semester
grades, as well as the first semester grades,
in connection with the results of the Intel-
ligence Tests, before any publicity is given
to the results. Presumably there will be
rendered at the coming convention of the
Society for the Promotion of Engineering
Education (which will occur in Ann Arbor
June 29 to July 2) a program report of the
Committee on Intelligence Tests, which had
general charge of such tests throughout
the country. These results should be ex-
tremely interesting, as the tests were given
to about ten thousand freshmen in about
fifty colleges.
The detailed analysis of results that is
now being undertaken by the Committee in
charge of the tests at the University of
Michigan aims to obtain reliable informa-
tion regarding the following points:
1. What relation exists, if any, between
the grade of work done by a student in col-
lege (particularly in those subjects which
are most critically important to Engineers
or most significantly indicative of engineer-
ing aptitude or ability), and the grades at-
tained in each part of the Intelligence
Test?
2. What relation exists, if any, between
the students' aptitude and ability demon-
strated in the most significant courses in
the Engineering College, and the grades in
related subjects which are given to the
student in high school and marked upon
his credentials for admission to the Univer-
sity?
3. What inconsistencies are there in the
systems of grading students which are em-
ployed in the various courses of study?
4. What are the relative standings of the
various high schools whose students are
usually admitted to this university without
an examination? What are the particular
weaknesses of each high school as shown by
the records of its students and with the
results of the Intelligence Tests?
It is felt that the study of the results of
this Intelligence Test marks the beginning
of a systematic analysis of the records of
students in the college, which may have
very important results in the future.

For the Committee of Mentors.
PROFESSORS OF ENGINEERING TO
HOLD CONVENTION HERE
The Society for the Promotion of Engi-
neering Education, the oldest and one of
the influential of the national Engineering
societies, will hold its annual meeting in
Ann Arbor, June 29 to July 2. About three
hundred delegates are expected, represent-
ing all the important engineering schools in
the country. The local committee, consist-
ing of Professors J. Raleigh Nelson, chair-
man, J. C. Parker, Theodore Running and
F. C. Finch, have secured the Union as
headquarters and the guests at the conven-
tion will be entertained at the Union and in
the adjacent fraternities. A reception will
be tendered the visitors the opening night
by President Burton, and a luncheon will
be given at the Barton Hills Country Club.
One day will be spent in an excursion to
Detroit, where opportunity will be given
the delegates to inspect the Detroit Water-
works, the Hudson Motor Company, the


101
Berry Bros. Varnish Works, the Connors
Creek Power Plant, and the construction
work on the Belle Isle Bridge. The pro-
gram, while it is not yet completed, already
contains some very important papers. Dean
Cooley regards the coming of this body of
education of national repute as an event of
great significance for the Engineering
College.
PROF. FRIDAY SPEAKS AT CLASS
ASSEMBLIES
During the last month Prof. Friday has
addressed several class assemblies on the
subject of the phenomenal rise of prices
during and after the war. He showed that
many of the so-called reasons were in
reality but the effect of others which were
not self-evident to the average citizen, and
followed with an explanation of the real
causes of the present inflated prices.
Nothing less than a general depression,
involving business failures, a consequent
lessening of the demand for goods and an
increase in the efficiency of labor, will bring
about a lowering of prices. Such a depres-
sion is bound to come, but, in Prof. Fri-
day's estimation, we cannot hope for a
decrease in prices to less than 175% of
those of 1913.
ALLEN F. SHERZER SUCCEEDS
PROF. ZOWSKI
Assistant Professor Allen F. Sherzer,
'13E, has been appointed to give the courses
in hydraulic machinery formerly given by
Professor Zowski, who has been granted a
leave of absence until 1921. Prof. Allen
Sherzer was with the Kingsford Foundry
and Machine Co. of Oswega, N. Y., at the
time of his appointment. He assumed his
duties here on May first.
FELLOWSHIPS OFFERED IN HIGH-
WAY ENGINEERING
The Department of Civil Engineering an-
nounces that the following Fellowships are
available during the collegiate year 1920-
1921:
The Roy D. Chapin Fellowship in High-
way Transport. This Fellowship is offered
to provide for the investigation of an ap-
proved subject relative to Highway Trans-
port. It pays the sum of $250 with an
allowance of $50 for expenses.
There is also a Roy D. Chapin Fellowship
offered in highway engineering.
Two Detroit Edison Fellowships in High-
way Engineering. These Fellowships are
offered for the investigation of approved
subjects relative to moderate cost country
roads. Each Fellowship pays the sum of
$250 with an allowance of $50 for expenses.
During the months of December, 1920, to
March, 1921, inclusive, the University of
Michigan will offer at least seventeen
graduate short period courses in Highway
Engineering and Highway Transport. Each
course will consist of thirty lectures to
be given in a period of two weeks. The
time schedule of the courses will be an-
nounced later. Each course will count as
two hours' credit towards the total of
twenty-four hours required for the Master
of Science degree.
Any students wishing more complete in-
formation on the above are requested to
see Prof. Blanchard.
NEW CONSTITUTION ACCEPTED
FOR ENGINEERING SOCIETY
The Engineering Society's activities have
been more or less limited by the fact that
as the society now exists it is not properly
organized and does not have an adequate
constitution. For several years it has grad-
ually been ceasing to be representative of
the students of the Engineering College.
This was furthered by the interruption of
its activities during the war period. More-
over, the Engineering Society was organized
when the College was small and the courses
were less specialized. However, with the
growth of the engineering school, the diver-
sification of courses, and the specialization
in the various departments, the interests of
the students, especially of the upperclass-
men, have been narrowed to their own de-
partment and to thejr branch societies, as
the A. S. M. E., A. I. E. E., etc. This is,
of course, quite natural, but does not mean
that there is no room for a general engi-
neering society.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Because of this specialization, there
should be a society to act as a coordinating
medium, so that the Engineering College
may be a college and not merely a group
of departments. It can be active in the
common interests of all the departments,
and represent the Engineering College on
the campus. This is in accordance with the
broader national idea of the unification of
the national societies in order to further
engineering as a profession.
In accordance with these ideas, a com-
mittee of seniors investigated the relation-
ship of the Engineering Society to the
branch organizations and, after correlating
the opinion of the faculty and the student
body, recommended that the constitution be
redrawn so as to incorporate the branch
societies. Membership in the branch so-
cieties and in the Engineering Society for
upper classmen should not be taken inde-
pendently. Underclassmen will be eligible
for membership in the Engineering Society
only. Each member will receive the
TECHNIC.
The governing body will be composed of
representatives of the branch societies and
of the TECHNIC and the officers of the
Engineering Society.
Acting on these suggestions a new con-
stitution has been drawn and accepted at the
campus elections on May 12th, that con-
tains, these clauses and which unites the
College branches of the different societies
into the Engineering Society, so that by
joining the Engineering Society one also is
considered a member of the other society of
his department. It is hoped that this will do
away with the narrowness that has been
the fault before, and help gu'e the student
a bigger, broader education.
STATE ENGINEERING SOCIETY
NOW IN A .A. E.
What was formerly the Michigan Engi-
neering Society is now the Michigan chap-
ter of the American Association of Engi-
neers as a result of the balloting on the
new constitution of the society. W. W.
Cox, of Port Huron, was chosen president;
O. E. Eckert, of Lansing, vice-president; A.
J. Decker, of the University of Michigan,
treasurer; and J. H. Bateman, also of the
University of Michigan, secretary-
The A. A. E. is a national society which
is absorbing the various state organizations,
and whose aim is "to raise the standards of
ethics of the engineering profession and to
promote the economic and social welfare of
engineers.'' The Michigan chapter has about
one thousand members.
A. S. M. E.
Those who have had a chance to hear
the lectures and see the movies given by
the A. S. M. E. during the year, realize
the benefit gained through membership to
such a society.
Speeches and illustrated lectures have
been given by men prominent in the Uni-
versity, and in the industrial world. All
meetings have been interesting and some
have been open to the college at large, be-
cause the speakers were men whom all
engineers should hear.
It is the aim of all engineering societies
to enlarge the scope of those attending,
and working along this idea the A. S. M. E.
tries to have a program that will make
every one go home with a new thought and
a better idea of his profession.
The officers have planned to have an in-
teresting program for the next year and
any suggestions that might be of general
interest can be given to L. K. Ferris, chair-
man.
A. I. E. E.
The local branch of the A. I. E. E. has
done a great deal of benefit this past year.
They have had speakers, from big electrical
concerns, or industrial centers, lantern
slides have helped illustrate some of the
topics, and smokers have encouraged the
idea of good fellowship.
Many interesting talks have been given to
the society that allow a student to see just
what he will have to face after he goes out
from here, and how some big men have
taken care of those problems. The A. I. E.
E. gives its members the privilege of at-
tending the meetings held in Detroit where


103
they can meet these successful men and get
their ideas.
Any questions that may arise regarding
the program of the A. I. E. E. will be an-
swered by the President of the Society,
Lester M. Ilgenfritz, or G. R. Anderson.
THE CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
SOCIETY
In the early part of December, 1919,
Prof. A. H. White appointed a committee
composed of Chemical Engineers, to ar-
range a plan for reorganizing the Chemical
branch of the Engineering Society, which
had gone out of existence during the war.
This committee arranged for a smoker
for the Chemical Engineers, at which plans
for reorganizing were completed. The old
constitution was adopted and the following
officers were elected: President, J. W. Ken-
nedy; vice-president, K. Harms; secretary-
treasurer, J. C. Geniesse.
Thus far three meetings have been held
and several more have been planned. On
March 25, Mr. C. T. Bragg, manager of the
Michigan Smelting and Refining Co., gave
an interesting talk on "The Present Status
of the Electric Furnace." On Wednesday,
April 7, 1920, the Indiana Limestone
Quarrymen's Association presented a mov-
ing picture on Indiana Limestone.
Another moving picture was given by the
National Malleable Association on Wednes-
day, May 5th, in the Natural Science audi-
torium. The subject was "Malleable Iron."
From the character of the above meet-
ings, the purpose of the Chemical Branch of
the Engineering Society can easily be under-
stood. Its object is to procure speakers who
will be of technical interest to the Chemical
Engineer along the lines of his chosen pro-
fession. J. W. Kennedy,
Pres. Chetn. Eng. Soc.
AERONAUTICAL SOCIETY CON-
SIDERS PURCHASE OF PLANE
The University of Michigan Aeronautical
Society is for the purpose of encouraging
aeronautics in the University. Its function
is to promote a social organization for those
interested in aeronautics, to assist the study
of aeronautical developments by securing
authorities on aeronautical questions for
lectures and to bring together aviators and
aeronautical engineering students.
Membership in the society is open to any
man of the University whom the member-
ship committee deems desirable because of
interest shown in aeronautics. At present
the membership consists of about thirty ex-
Air Service men and as many more Aero-
nautical Engineering students.
Reserve officers in the society hope to
organize a Reserve Aid Service unit, all
pilots and officers of which are University
of Michigan men. Also, ways and means
are being considered for securing an aero-
plane for entering in future Intercollegiate
Aerial Derbies.
James C. Morrison, Treas.
SUMMER SCHOOL POLICY
CHANGED
In previous years the Summer School
has been looked upon as a last resort to
make up back work. This idea of the
school is rapidly giving way to one in which
it is looked upon as an added opportunity
for college work, especially since the policy
of the coming session has been radically
changed.
For the first time in its history the courses
concerning engineering are under the direct
control of the Engineering College. The
result is that practically all courses which
are available during the collegiate year are
open. Even highly specialized courses will
be given. Another change in policy is that
the senior members of the faculty will be
on the staff. This will raise the standard of
the school to a higher degree.
UNIVERSITY WIRELESS STATION
RECEIVES LICENSE
The University wireless station has been
assigned its former call letters (8 X A) and
has resumed its pre-war basis. This sta-
tion is for experimental purposes only.
However it is equipped with the latest
equipment and is capable of receiving mes-
sages from about 7,000 miles. This station
is open to visitors on Monday evenings. At


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
other times it is open to operators exclu-
sively.
The call letters of the wireless station of
the Signal Corps is W N 9.
FOOTBALL OUTLOOK FOR 1920
The following schedule and the enthusi-
astic turnout at the field for spring practice
promise to make 1920 a most successful
year in football. Over fifty men reported for
practice, including M-men of last year and
Yost's all-American, Steketee. Steketee's
work is especially promising, his booting
being characterized by the same old power.
Coach Mather, with the aid of former var-
sity men, began by putting the candidates
through fast practice in rudiments. He
followed this by blocking and tackling work,
passing and formation drills, and scrim-
mages. Coach Yost was greatly gratified
with the quality of the men and their work.
With those prospects, which Fielding H.
Yost has developed out of this spring's
squad, Michigan may look forward to a
strenuous 1920 football season.
Schedule
Oct. 9—Case Scientific School at Ann
Arbor, Mich.
October 16—Michigan Agricultural Col-
lege at Ann Arbor, Mich.
October 23—University of Illinois at Ann

TRACK
The spring of 1920 held a most formid-
able track schedule for Michigan. Not only
did it meet Illinois and Chicago in dual
meets, but it acquitted itself well at the
Drake Relays, and a week later, at the Penn
Relays. One of the most exciting meets
was between Michigan and Cornell, at
Ithaca, when Cornell won the meet
by inches in the relay. While this meet
was an indoor meet, yet it serves as the
only means of comparison between Michi-
gan and the East. The outdoor Eastern
Intercollegiates were not attended by Mich-
igan due to the confliction with the train-
ing for the Conference meet held a week
later at Ann Arbor.
SWIMMING TEAM COMPLETES
SUCCESSFUL SEASON
Although this is the first season in which
Michigan has ever been represented in
aquatic sports, its informal swimming team
has brought out some exceptionally fine
material. Due to the efforts of Coach Dru-
lard and Lindon Babcock, (Capt.), the sport
has been introduced to the Campus. Since
the first call for tryouts, 125 men have
appeared this semester. Of these, 15 are on
the regular squad while 15 more have been
retained as promising material.
An interclass meet was held, which was
won by the freshmen with 34 points. Seven
men received their numerals.
METALLURGICAL LABORATORY
INSTALLED IN FOUNDRY
At a recent meeting of the Board of
Regents a sum of money amounting to
$1,100 was donated to the Shops Depart-
ment for the installation of a Metallurgical
Research laboratory. This donation further
carries out the plan of the University to
establish research facilities and encourage
work along that line. It is hoped that the
foundaries in this vicinity will take advant-
age of this laboratory and co-operate with
it in finding the most economical propor-
tions and the best kind of iron to use in
the making of different machinery. This re-
search work is rapidly assuming great im-
portance due to the soaring price of iron,
and its coming scarcity.
All the chemical experiments and tests
are taken care of in the new laboratory,
which is thoroughly fitted to handle all fer-
rous and non-ferrous metals. The chemical
tests themselves are carried on by some
member of the chemical department, who is
assisting in the research and greatly aiding


105
the men of the shops to get to the bottom of
the analysis.
The physical tests are carried on in the
mechanical laboratory and any assistance
that is needed is furnished by that depart-
ment. This arrangement is by far the most
satisfactory and efficient that could be de-
vised, as it gives the research laboratory the
use of the fine equipment of the Mechanical
Department, and does not necessitate a
cluttered research laboratory full of ma-
chines for testing.
WATER SOFTENER INSTALLED IN
POWER HOUSE
The change to the Steere Farm water has
brought up with added force the question
of water softening and the University has
found it necessary to buy two water soften-
ing plants, one of the zeolite type for the
laundry and one of the hot process types
for the power plant. With the purchase of
the laundry softener the manufacturers
donated to the Chemical Engineering De-
partment a model apparatus with the ca-
pacity of fifty gallons per hour. An in-
vestigation of the capacity in operation of
this type is now under way.

RESEARCH IN CHEMICAL ENGI-
NEERING
Organic
The Research in the Chemical Engineer-
ing department has begun to Come back to
its pre-war magnitude.
The work this semester happens to be
largely organic. Prof. A. H. White is try-
ing to find some substitute for sulphites in
the manufacture of wood pulp for paper
making. The waste liquors from the sul-
phite process are a very great nuisance and
new substances are being tried for cooking
the wood. Also he is trying to change some
of the now nearly useless products of wood
distillation into products of value as sol-
vents or fuers, and the utilization of waste
from the manufacture of buttons from so-
called vegetable ivory. This is a tropical
nut whose shell is the usual material for
buttons, but the waste in working it up is
now nearly 90%.
Inorganic
A study of the effect of freezing on con-
crete is being conducted. Results would in-
dicate that if cement in a 1 to 2 mix has
four or five days of setting, it is then no
longer in serious danger of freezing. Under
laboratory conditions some test pieces with
as little as two days of setting showed no
deterioration on freezing. This work also
indicates that the density of the concrete
may possibly be an indication of its ability
to resist freezing.
An investigation is being carried out as to
the effect of enriching air with oxygen for
use in a gas producer. It is thought that be-
fore long oxygen can be produced on a large
scale and its use will not be prohibited by
expense. If the air for a gas producer
could be so enriched it would mean a much
higher quality of gas.
Metallurgical
A very extensive investigation into the
causes of corrosion of the metal in the
economizers of the Detroit Edison Co. is
being carried out. Such work goes slowly
and as yet no definite conclusions can have
been reached. The cause of brittleness in
chrome-nickle steels is being determined.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
These steels become very brittle by the
treatment which makes ordinary steels soft
and vice versa.
Apparatus
The various problems connected with
apparatus naturally center around the
Evaporator Laboratory. The standard hor-
izontal tube evaporator is a widely used
type but no investigation into its theory has
ever been conducted.
RESEARCH IN INDUCTION MOTOR
CHARACTERISTICS
In the large majority of problems in
electrical engineering, it has been found
that by making certain assumptions, usually
of comparatively minor importance, we are
able to set up exact mathematical expres-
sions which simplify such problems to a
remarkable degree; and that the errors in-
volved in making such assumptions are
usually negligible. There has, perhaps, been
a resulting tendency toward too great sim-
plification, notably in the expressions de-
rived from the circle diagram for the in-
duction motor, which frequently fail to
bear out the facts obtained by tests. This
has led us to undertake the problem of in-
vestigating the actual conditions in induc-
tion motors, in order to determine the real
value and the limitations of the circle
diagram as commonly used in making com-
putations in design.
Up to date, the motors that have been
tested are the Diebl at 3 H. P., 60 cycle,
220 volts; one two phase and one three
phase; both motors being built in the same
frame size and having identical rotors.
Although we have obtained a great deal of
interesting data from these machines, it is
obviously too early to form any positive
conclusions until tests have been made on
a number of motors. This data seems to
indicate, however, that the circle diagram
has a decided limitation, but the influence
of design upon the circle has yet to be
determined.
Only Small Motors Available
Unfortunately, we are limited as to the
size of motors that can be tested by the
available equipment, which consists of a
Diebl dynanometer of three H. P. con-
tinuous rating. One would hardly dare
form any general conclusions from tests of
motors of small horsepower.
A great many interesting problems have
presented themselves from time to time in
connection with our work, some of them
closely related to the main problems and
most necessary parts of them, and others
of such a character as to furnish ample
material for entirely separate problems. One
of the most interesting of the latter class is
the effect of unbalanced voltages in a poly-
phase system on the various motor charac-
teristics. The subject was suggested by the
fact that any of the local sources of three-
phase alternating current have unequal
voltages between the phases, and it became
necessary to generate the power for our
tests by machines in the laboratory. Some
time later, there appeared an article in The
Electrical World in which some very sim-
ple expressions were derived for calculating
the effect of motor unbalance on the start-
ing and pull-out torques and on the con-
tinuous output of a motor. The expression
for the continuous output entirely neglected
the effect of power factor, so a test was
run to determine its merit. It was found
that the expressions for starting and pull-
out torques were, substantially correct, but
the expression for obtaining the reduced
output was greatly in error, and would
give values much too large. However, for
the small voltage unbalance usually found
in the lines of a large central station, the
motor characteristics are but slightly
affected.
As is always the case in beginning a new
research problem, a great deal of time is
consumed in finding out what apparatus is
best suited for the work, making new ap-
paratus suited to the needs of a particular
test, and arranging a system of carrying
on the work to best advantage. Such pre-
liminary work has been completed, and we
are now in a position to obtain data which,
it is hoped, will be found valuable.

WILLIAM P. CAMPBELL, '22, Editor
My Dear Telmore :—
I say, old fellow, I am about to bawl you
out,—to reprimand you, that is, for your
inadvertency—your, your careless regard of
friends and acquaintances—your awful ne-
glect of the simplest of conventional de-
corums—your, your unapproachable—. But
I am dealing too much in generalities; one
especial point is our present concern. I
am about to "haul you over the coals" as
I have said (and as the saying goes), and
Telmore, to be more serious, I trust, and
am sure, that you are past the state wherein
the mention, in a friendly way, of a weak-
ness (called a "failing") shall be the cause
of severance of our friendship and an eter-
nal feud. With that assumption hearken
further; the pages of your biography show,
old boy, the disposition that is so common
amongst the habitants of this "mortal coil"
to do the least you can and still retain the
belief that you are "getting away with it."
"Let the other do the work," and "get as
much as possible without an effort on my
part," seem the creeds which your mode of
conduct seem to propagate. As a concrete
example; you. as a student of an alumnus
of the U. of M., have for the past thirty
odd years received the Technic. In every
issue of the magazine you've found great in-
terest—something of a technical nature and
news of your friends among your old class-
mates. These things you read and give not
a moment's thought to their compilation, to
the efforts of the men on the other end—
and truly, old boy, they don't want you to,
for it's not your duty as a subscriber. But
once in a while, Telmore, you find amongst
the pages a little white or maybe yellow
blank upon which we request that you shall
set down any bit of information you may
have of classmates or others of alumni, or
information of yourself. And the reason
for our asking this is that we want to let
alumni read all the news that we can get
about their friends, and that information
you must give to us—it doesn't grow on
trees, we cannot raise it from the ground
or draw it from the skies—it has got to
come from you, Telmore, you and your
friends. Give it to us, old man, don't let
"the other fellow" do it all. This is from
friend to friend and we are sure you'll do it.
Most sincerely,
The Alumni Editor.
Michigan alumni in Detroit are active.
Our athletic situation has aroused them and
led them to see that they may assist the
University in many ways. So to aid us they
have organized several special committees.
Robert H. Clancy, Field Secretary of the


THE MICHIGAN TBCHNIC
Detroit Club, in a recent speech regarding
their actions, stated:
"The movement does not consider ath-
letics merely, but the promotion of the best
interests of the University in every respect.
We want to get more money for the Uni-
versity through the Legislature and through
gifts of prosperous citizens to extend the
useful and the noble work of instruction
and of research. We want to encourage
our professors and instructors by generous
treatment; we want more buildings, more
equipment. We want to educate the peo-
ple by a highly developed system of pub-
licity that this University is one of the
best and most powerful friends they may
have."
Mr. Clancy then outlined the plan of or-
ganization, referring especially to athletics.
The plan assumes the attention of students
as well as alumni. He said further:
"Now there has been a little speculation
as to whether Michigan men will offer ma-
terial or extraordinary inducements, such
as the payment of money, to induce ath-
letes to enter Michigan. Some of the
greatest stars in this state have been per-
suaded in the past to enter other colleges,
mainly in the East, by what are politely
called 'extraordinary inducements.' We
may, lose this year some of the most cele-
brated stars in the state, boys who should
go to Ann Arbor, but who have been ap-
proached with alluring offers, by agents of
other schools. .
"But the University of Michigan would
rather lose all the high school stars in the
state than buy them, as negro slaves were
formerly bought on the auction block by
the highest bidder. If an athlete is at
heart a gold-digger, or is tempted by
scouts of colleges to become one, Ann Ar-
bor must pass him by. We will offer every
fair, honorable and legitimate inducement
to get him, but further than that we can-
not go."
And Mr. Clancy said of service in other
fields:
"We should encourage gifts and endow-
ments from public spirited citizens whether
they are graduates of Michigan or not.
There are a hundred and fifty millionaires
in this state and none of these could do a
worthier work than to give money for spe-
cial funds to fight diseases, such as pneu-
monia and influenza, develop engineering,
aid the study of social and political prob-
lems, buy books, increase the salaries of in-
structors and professors, or aid in a hundred
and one ways where the money would be
spent to wonderful advantage."
They have aimed high; we shall watch
and when possible, aid them.
MILWAUKEE HAS EFFICIENT
ALUMNI ORGANIZATION
"The Iivest University Alumni organiza-
tion in the city." During the past year this
has been said by graduates of all colleges
when speaking of the Milwaukee Associa-
tion. And we have proved our right to the
title in regard to both social events and
service to our University. Our activities,
like many other things, were limited during
the war because of the press of other mat-
ters and the necessity of government work.
But last spring meetings were resumed with
the first dinner in honor of our returned
service men and in the interests of the
Michigan Union. Talks were given by Col.
C. A. Evans, '04M, Capt. W. J. Egan, '16M,
Maj. J. S. Stover, '05L, and others. Over
$5,000 in additional controbutions were
pledged for the Union and officers for the
following year were elected.
After the summer vacation a luncheon
was held at the University Club and plans
for the coming year were discussed. In an
effort to get everyone acquainted, four
"mixers" or smokers have been held since
that time. After bowling three or four
games, a meeting was held in adjoining
rooms and the evening concluded with a
buffet supper. Rivalry has been intense in
the bowling games between teams made
up of the Lits, Laws, Medics and Engi-
neers. It culminated with a renewal of the
old feud between Laws and Engineers
by the Engineers who won two out of three
pins. As a result the Lawyers entertained at
a dinner afterwards and showed that they
were winners in that line.


109
We have been fortunate in having at
all meetings, Claude G. Pendill, '11E, of
Kenosha, who plays the piano and leads
the singing. He also furnished a Camp
Davis song book from which pamphlets
were printed containing all the popular
Michigan songs. Many of the "old boys"
had never heard some of them and they
are very enthusiastic over "Mr. Noah,"
"The Baptist Sunday School," "The Bum
Army," and "Varsity." On Nov. 8th, eighty-
five fans and fanettes went to Chicago on a
special train to sec our football team in
action, it being the first opportunity for two
years. The game was a sad disappointment,
but we are going back the next time in in-
creased numbers and help put over the win-
ning punch.
Our annual banquet will be held the
third day of May, at which we will
have as our guests President Hutchins,
Dean Vaughn and Dean Cooley. It will be
the big event of the year. Although this
is the first prohibition banquet, it is expected
matters will be livened up by the "promises"
already made. The year will be closed with
a picnic some time in June, which may be
held jointly with the Chicago Alumni at a
place between the two cities.
The Milwaukee Alumni want to put the
University of Michigan "back on the map-'
in Woscinson. Of late years there have
not been as many boys going to Ann Arbor
as there should have been and the Univer-
sity has not received the publicity it should
have. The return to the Conference should
be a big help in both ways. A press commit-
tee has been appointed and by this means we
have had alumni meetings, athletic events,
and matters of general interest given the
space they deserve.
We are very anxious to have the
senior engineers visit the city on one of
their spring trips. We hoped that we could
have the pleasure of entertaining them this
year but the trip was dropped because of
traveling expenses. We believe Milwaukee
has as many interesting industrial plants as
any city and the University as well as the
boys would benefit from a trip here. To
help graduates or others who are looking for
positions, a committee, composed of one man
from each department, have written to the
deans and offered their assistance and the
influence of our association in placing men
in attractive work.
Arrangements have been made with the
University for obtaining seven sets of
photographs of the campus and sur-
roundings and one set will be placed in
each high school of the city, either in a
large frame or in an album. We have sub-
scribed for the Alumnus, the Gargoyle, and
the Daily for each of the high schools. Now
that graduation time is drawing near a spe-
cial committee is to be appointed whose duty
will be to interest boys in the University
and get them to go there next fall. This is
an outline of what the Milwaukee Alumni
have done the past year. Finances have been
taken care of by the regular dues and a
theater benefit party. We expect to be of
greater service next year to the University
and our fellow graduates and to this end
have worked out several novel schemes and
entertainments.
H. B. MERRTCK WRITES FROM
CHINA
Dear Dean Cooley:—
Just now we are having a three-day holi-
day to celebrate the Chinese New Year.
I am taking advantage of this opportunity
to write to you. I have planned to do it
often before, but this is the first time 1
have really started.
China is a great place for holidays. I
have been compiling a small book of in-
structions for my field parties and in look-
ing over the old circular letters which have
been sent out from time to time I find
that this commission grants to its employees
thirty days' vacation on full pay every year.
Also, if a man marries he gets the same
amount of leave on full pay; if his mother
dies he mourns for a month on full pay;
the same thing happens if his father dies;
if he is sick he receives full pay for the
first twenty days and half pay for the next
twenty days. So you see under favorable
(?) circumstances a man may receive full
pay for five months without working.


THE MICHIGAN TECHXIC
Only one of the original force of foreign
engineers is left on the Grand Canal Board.
M. Merrill, Mich., 'oo, is still with us. Col.
Wiggin, late of the A. E. F. in France, is
the acting chief engineer. He has asso-
ciated with him Mr. O. J. Todd, a Michigan
man, who graduated about '06 or '07, I
think.
I left the Board on November 30th and
came directly to the Chihli River Commis-
sion. The place had very kindly been held
open for me since August.
If you look on the map of China you
will notice the Peking-Hankow railway run-
ning in a generally southern direction from
Peking. All the drainage which this rail-
way crosses between Peking and the Yellow
River, in addition to one or two rivers on
the east of Peking, concentrates at Tientsin.
If, as occasionally happens, nearly all these
rivers are in flood at the same time the
situation becomes somewhat saturated
around this city. Also, at times, nearly all
the plains country between the railway and
the Grand Canal is covered with water.
Of course, much of this water runs off
rapidly but the slope is so flat that in many-
places large areas remain inundated for
years. My men have just finished sounding
through the ice such an area covering some
twenty-five hundred square kilometers, hav-
ing a depth of about a meter and a half.
The Chihli River Commission was ap-
pointed to make plans looking toward an
amelioration of such conditions. As a pre-
liminary to these plans a survey is neces-
sary. The Chinese military authorities have
mapped a large pirt of the province, using
sketch boards. These maps are a help in
the work but are not sufficiently accurate to
form a basis for river improvement plans.
Indeed they are almost entirely lacking in
elevations.
It is to make the surveys and maps for
this purpose that the department of Topo-
graphic Surveys was formed.
The department has had i more or less
checkered career so far, having had three
heads in two years. In the beginning no
one quite realized the magnitude of the un-
dertaking. The proper solution of the prob-
lem requires, not only a map of the plains
as was at first contemplated, but a survey
of the whole drainage area, from the Yellow
River north to the Lwan Ho.
The Commission is composed as follows:
Mr. Hauing Hsi-ling, Director-General of
Flood Relief and Conservancy, President of
the Commission.
Admiral Woo Yu-ling, (Chinese), in
charge of Taku Naval Dockyard.
Mr. Yang Pao-ling, (Chinese), the engi-
neer of the National Conservancy Bureau.
Returned student from Cornell and Purdue.
Mr. H. van der Veen, (Dutch), engineer-
ing advisor to the National Conservancy
Bureau.
Mr. Pincione, (Italian), engineer-in-chief
to the Hai Ho Conservancy Commission.
Mr. H. von Heidenstam, (Swede), engi-
neer-in-chief to the Whangpoo Conservancy
Board.
Mr. W. F. Taylor, (English), Coast In-
spector of the Maritime Customs.
Mr. T. S. Wei. (Chinese), secretary, and
Mr. F. Hussey-Freke, (English), treas-
urer.
Mr. van der Veen is the member dele-
gated by the Commission to look after the
work of the survey department and of the
works department, of the latter of which
Mr. Ralph Goodrich is engineer in charge.
He is a Hollander and very pleasant to work
with. You will notice that the commission
is made up of several nationalities.
Quite a lot of work has been done on the
surveys and maps but more remains to be
done. None of the maps have been quite
finished as yet. It will require some con-
siderable time to bring them up to date.
There is still more field work to do than
has been done. Of course, in a proposition
of this kind there is always the danger that
the money will not be forthcoming to carry
it to completion. We just had a scare last
month. But it has been decided that we
can continue for some time yet. You see
that is somewhat indefinite. All public work
in China is in the same condition.
I have five parties in the field. Counting
engineers, coolies and helpers, they number
about three hundred. The drafting force
numbers about fifty-five.


in
Of course I am trying to improve the
standard of the work and to lead the Chi-
nese engineers to a better appreciation of
the art of surveying and the accuracy it is
possible and desirable to attain. Their way
of showing that a survey is correct is never
to check it, never to connect it properly
with another survey and never to close it
on itself. How then can any one show an
error in the work!? However I find them
quite willing to be shown and eager to
please.
I want to thank you for asking for leave
of absence for the present semester for me.
Just now it looks as though I would like
leave for another year if that is not asking
too much. I will write you further in re-
gard to this later.
Please remember me kindly to the mem-
bers of the faculty who will be interested.
Sincerely yours,
(Signed) H. B. Merrick.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The minister in the country town had just
received an appointment to the position as
chaplain in the state reformatory, so every-
one awaited with much interest his parting
sermon. They found the text which had
been selected on the bulletin board. It was:
"I go to prepare a place for you." The
church was crowded.
"I went to a wooden wedding last week."
"You did? How was that?"
"Two Poles got married."
"There was an awful accident up the road.
An automobile ran over me."
"You don't look a bit hurt, where were
you?"
"Under the bridge."
He who hesitates gets left by the last car.
Dear Dad:—
Roses are red,
Violets are blue;
Please send me fifty;
I love you.
Your Son.
Dear Son:—
Roses are red,
Some are pink;
Enclosed find fifty—
I don't think.
—Omaha Register.
I suppose when a deaf and dumb couple
get married they may be said to be unspeak-
ably happy.
"A big truck ran over my dog's tail this
morning."
"Did it affect his carriage?"
"I don't know, but it stopped his wagin'."
If you want to get robbed of your good
name, put it in your umbrella.
REGISTRATION DAY
"And what is your father's occupation?"
'23: "Piano finisher."
"Yes; but does he move them or var-
nish them?"
"Thompson made a great report in C. E.
95 today."
"What about?"
"Oh, he didn't say."
He was a homesick colored soldier in a
labor battalion, and he saw no chance of
discharge.
"De nex' wah dey has," he announced to
a friend, "dey's two men dat ain't goin'—
me an' de man dey sends to git me."
The gob was on shore-leave and happy
because he had found a girl as affectionate
as he. His joy was dimmed, however, for
a bluecoat had forbidden spooning in the
park and his girl had tabooed it in the
streets. But life took a new turn when he
saw a man kiss his wife farewell in front
of the Pennsylvania Station, New York. He
rushed his girl toward a crowd hurrying
toward the Philadelphia express, and bade
her a fond farewell. When the crowd thin-
ned, they joined a throng for Washington,
and repeated the act. They repeated it again
before the Chicago train.
This was too much for a colored porter
who had been watching. He stepped up
to the gob. "Boss," he said, "why don't you
go down-stairs and try the Long Island
Station? Dem local trains am a-leavin'
mos' all de time!"
IN DOUBT
The pompous politician burst into the
lawyer's office and in an excited manner
asked:
"What would you do if a paper should
call you a thief and a liar?"
"Well," said the lawyer scrutinizingly, "if
I were you I'd toss up a nickel to see
whether I'd reform or lick the editor."


117
In a city schoolroom there was one pupil
who would insist on saying, "I have went."
One day the teacher grew very angry at the
child. "You will have to stay after school,"
she said, "and write 'I have gone," one thou-
sand times. Perhaps that will cure you."
The boy obeyed, and when he had fin-
ished, not finding the teacher, he wrote her
the following note:
Dear Teacher:
I wrote "I have gone" one thousand times,
and as you were out of the room, I have
went home.
A FIXED FESTIVAL
"What is your prayer-meeting night
here?" inquired the solemn guest.
"Every Wednesday evening," replied the
landlord of the Petunia tavern, "unless there
happens to be an unusually good fillum on
at the moving-picture show."
IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS
"In my class at school," related old Fes-
tus Pester, "was a lad who appeared to be
a confirmed numskull. He had such diffi-
culty in mastering his studies that every-
body predicted he would always be a booby.
And the strange part of it is that he didn't
fool us all by becoming a great captain of
industry, a successful financier or something
of the kind. He was a lunkhead then, and
he is yet. Why, he has been sent to the
legislature seven times in succession, to my
positive knowledge."
HER UNBALANCED ACCOUNT
The bank mailed her a letter, reading thus:
"Madam: We're grieved to say that your
account
Is overdrawn ten dollars. Send to us
As early as convenient that amount."
On its receipt the lady quickly wrote
And mailed, in hopes it would not be too
late,
A check on that same bank, with this short
note:
"I'm very glad to set the matter straight."
—John B. Dolsen.
HIS MOST REMARKABLE WAY
"An excellent man. isn't he?"
"One of the best I have ever known," re-
plied J. Fuller Gloom. "Why, when he
misses his train on account of his own pro-
crastination he blames himself, and it never
enters his mind to hold everybody else re-
sponsible."
MULTUM IN PARVO
A well-known lawyer, small in stature but
mighty in intellect, was, in his youthful
days, opposed by an attorney, a veritable
giant in size and the possessor of a most in-
timidating manner. Going up to the young
attorney, who looked not much larger than
Tom Thumb in comparison, the giant guf-
fawed down upon him:
"Are you the attorney opposing me? Why,
I could put you in my vest pocket."
"Perhaps," said the unabashed little man;
"but if you did so you would have more
law in your pocket than you ever had in
your head!"
NOT THE KIND HE KEPT
A Chicago citizen who wanted some the-
ater tickets telephoned the box office and
asked, "Can I get a box for two tonight?"
A puzzled voice answered from the other
end of the line, "We don't have boxes for
two."
"Isn't this the theater?" he asked crossly.
"Why, no," said the puzzled man at the
other end, "you are talking to an under-
taker."
Ethel, a slender youthful matron, and her
Aunt Emma, a woman of generous avoir-
dupois, went on a joint shopping tour, each
filled with an ambitious desire to purchase
a new spring suit.
Upon their return home Ethel was asked
what success each had.
"Well," she replied, a trifle reluctantly, "I
got along fairly well, but Aunt Emma is
getting so stout that about all she can get
ready-made is an umbrella."

tjow Large is an Atom?
ATOMS are so infinitesimal that to be seen under the most
. powerful microscope one hundred million must be grouped.
The atom used to be the smallest indivisible unit of matter.
When the X-Rays and radium were discovered physicists found
that they were dealing with smaller things than atoms—with
particles they call "electrons."
Atoms are built up of electrons, just as the solar system is built
up of sun and planets. Magnify the hydrogen atom, says Sir
Oliver Lodge, to the size of a cathedral, and an electron, in com-
parison, will be no bigger than a bird-shot.
Not much substantial progress can be made in chemical and
electrical industries unless the action of electrons is studied. For
that reason the chemists and physicists in the Research Labora-
tories of the General Electric Company are as much concerned
with the very constitution of matter as they are with the develop-
ment of new inventions. They use the X-Ray tube as if it were
a machine-gun; for by its means electrons are shot et targets in
new ways so as to reveal more about the structure cf matter.
As the result of such experiments, the X-Ray tube has been
greatly improved and the vacuum tube, now so indispensable in
radio communication, has been developed into a kind of trigger
device for guiding electrons by radio waves.
Years may thus be spent in what seems to be merely a purely
"theoretical" investigation. Yet nothing is so practical as a good
theory. The whole structure of modern mechanical engineering
is reared on Newton's laws of gravitation and motion—theories
stated in the form of immutable propositions.
In the past the theories that resulted from purely scientific re-
search usually came from the university laboratories, whereupon
the industries applied them. The Research Laboratories of the
General Electric Company conceive it as part of their task to ex-
plore the unknown in the same spirit, even though there may be
no immediate commercial goal in view. Sooner or later the world
profits by such research in pure science. Wireless communica-
tion, for example, was accomplished largely as the result of Herz's
brilliant series of purely scientific experiments demonstrating the
existence of wireless waves.

GARDNER S. WILLIAMS
I. Historical
Proposed Waterway Development Led to the Adoption of the Constitution
of the United States
In connection with the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Waterway, it is inter-
esting to recall that from a proposed waterway to connect the Ohio and
Potomac Rivers there came first the meeting at Mount Vernon, upon George
Washington's invitation, of commissioners from Maryland and Virginia,
in 1784, then the Annapolis Convention in 1786, and from the latter the call
for the Philadelphia Convention which framed the Constitution of these
United States and made our grand nation out of thirteen separate common-
wealths. And it may not be too much to hope that from the St. Lawrence
Waterway movement there may grow up such a better understanding
between the two great commonwealths of North America as will unite them
in closer bonds of friendship and mutual interest.
Great Lakes Tidewater Canals Have Already Been Surveyed and
Estimated Upon
The idea of a canal between the Great Lakes and the ocean is not new,
and its first outcome was the old Erie Canal, whose completion in 1825 is
barely within the memory of the oldest now living.
A more comprehensive program was inaugurated in 1895, when Con-
gress by point resolution authorized the creation of the "Deep Waterways
Commission" which submitted its report in January, 1897. This commis-
sion, which was composed of James B. Angell, President of the University
of Michigan; John E. Russel, ex-Governor of Massachusetts, and Lyman
E. Cooley, C. E., of Chicago, Illinois, acted jointly with a similar commis-
sion of Canada, composed of Oliver A. Howland, M. P. P., of Toronto;
Thomas C. Keefer, C. E., of Ottawa, and Thomas Munro, C. E., of Coteau
Landing. The report of the commission contains a vast amount of informa-
tion, gathered largely through the industry of Mr. Cooley, and one of its
most interesting exhibits is the "General Route Map" of suggested water-
way improvements connecting the Great Lakes with tidewater.
The transmission of the report to Congress in January, 1897, was fol-
lowed in the following June by the authorization of a "Board of Engineers
on Deep Waterways," which was appointed in July, 1897, and consisted of
Major Charles W. Raymond, Corps of Engineers, U. S. A.; Alfred Noble,
C. E., of Chicago, and George Y. Wisner, C. E., of Detroit. The report of
this board was submitted on June 30, 1900, and contains estimates for a
21-foot and a 30-foot channel between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic
Ocean by various routes within the territory of the United States, including
that through the Upper St. Lawrence to Lake St. Frances and thence south
through Lake Champlain and the Hudson River, the estimated cost of which


was $214,000,000 for a 30-foot channel 250 feet wide, with locks 740 feet
long and 80 feet wide, providing in case of flights of locks a duplicate system
60 feet wide.
In the investigation of the "Board of Engineers on Deep Waterways"
no consideration was given to the development of water power, nor was the
cost of rights of way or property damages included in the estimates.
II. Physical Characteristics
The Usable Energy of the Great Lake System Amounts to Eleven Million
Horse-Powers, Which is Equivalent to That of Sixty
Million Tons of Coal Annually
If all the water flowing and all the fall from Lake Superior to Montreal
could be converted into power without loss, the yield would be nearly
15,000,000 horse-powers. But of this amount some 200,000 horse-powers
represented by the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers, for lack of concentration
of fall, cannot be utilized with any apparatus yet devised, and of the remain-
der between 20 and 25 per cent will be lost in conversion to electrical horse-
power, so that the usable energy of the Great Lakes system reduces to about
11,000,000 horse-powers, of which about 90,000 are at Sault Ste. Marie,
about 5,700,000 on the Niagara River, and about 4,400,000 on the St.
Lawrence.
To produce this 11,000,000 horse-powers in the most efficient and up-to-
date steam plants would require the burning of over 60,000,000 tons of
high grade coal, which is equal to about ten per cent of the total annual coal
output of the United States and its dependencies, and one-third as much as
is used annually by all the steam railroads of the country.
Plate II presents a profile of the Great Lakes system from Lake Supe-
rior to the St. Lawrence River.
Less Tlian Twelve Per Cent of the Power is Now Utilized
The essential requirements for a water power are that a volume of
water shall pass abruptly from a higher to a lower level.
On the outlets of the Great Lakes nature has met these requirements
completely at but one point—Niagara Falls—but it has approximated to
them at Sault Ste. Marie on the Lower Niagara and on the St. Lawrence.
The utilization of power at Niagara Falls has been hampered to a con-
siderable extent by sentimental objections to the impairment of the greatest
s ngle example of nature's prodigality to be found in the world.
To a less extent the utilization of the St. Lawrence water power has
been restricted on similar grounds.
At the Soo about 60 per cent of the possible power has been developed.
At Niagara the power in use and under development amounts to less than
20 per cent of the total, and on the St. Lawrence to less than 7 per cent.
The power now used and in immediate contemplation of use on the
Great Lakes system is less than 1.500,000 horse-powers.


Forty-six Miles of Restricted Waterway in Canals and Locks Exist
in Present St. Lawrence Navigation
The existence of a natural water power on any stream is in itself an
obstruction to navigation, for it involves either a fall or a rapid, and in
order that either may be surmounted by ships, one or more locks must be
employed. At the present time navigation on the St, Lawrence is carried
past the various rapids by a series of canals and locks having a total length
of 46 miles. For pleasure navigation light draft passenger boats bound
down traverse the rapids and during the tourist season do a thriving busi-
ness. These boats on the upbound trip have to use the canals, but the time
required is so much greater than that occupied by the down trip that the
interests controlling them have usually opposed anything in the nature of
power development in the main river as being likely to interfere with a
lucrative traffic.
Deep Water Navigation Requires Slack Water Pools in River and Elimina-
tion of Canals Which Will Produce Ideal Power Conditions
So long as the navigation is small in volume and confined to light draft
boats, the plan adopted of constructing canals around the rapids is the most
economical, but in the case of a deep waterway commerce the canals must
be eliminated as far as possible, both on account of the restricted speed of
transit through them and of the danger of collision entailed by the narrow
channels, and the full width of the river must be utilized wherever prac-
ticable. To accomplish this, the fall now extending over the 46 miles of
rapids must be concentrated at a few points—by the construction of dams,
creating slack water pools above them, with locks at each dam to pass the
traffic up and down. The construction of these dams, which are imperative
in the interest of navigation, afford the ideal condition for the utilizat on of
the water-power, and the two interests, navigation and power, may easily
be brought to work in harmony.
Plate V shows a map of that portion of the St. Lawrence River extend-
ing from Ogdensburg to Montreal.
III. Water-power Development
Utilization of the Three Power Sections on the St. Lawrence Requires the
Same Construction Needed for Deep Water Navigation
The Upper Rapids
Beginning at Lake Ontario, the first section of the river to be so
improved is that between Ogdensburg and Lake St. Francis, and this nat-
urally divides into two reaches, the upper extending from Ogdensburg to
Morrisburg, a distance of 23 miles, and incluidng the Galops Rapids and
Rapide Plat, with a fall of about 34 feet, and the lower extending from
Morrisburg to Lake St. Francis, a distance of 27 miles, and including the
Long Sault Rapids, with a fall of 53 feet. A power development of about
600,000 horse-powers in the latter reach has been under consideration for
several years by the Long Sault Development Company, which was char-
tered under a special act of the New York legislature. This act became a
law on May 23, 1907, and Congressional action was sought by the company


in 1907, 1909, 1911 and 1912. Some modifications of the plans then pro-
posed would be necessary to provide for the increased navigation require-
ments now in contemplation, but the fundamental idea of the development
would remain, and the very extensive and thorough investigations of the
company will be of great value.
The possibilities of the upper reach have received considerable study
in connection with the suggested regulation of the level of Lake Ontario
and of the flow of the St. Lawrence River in the interest of navigation at
the port of Montreal. The simplest and most effective means of accom-
plishing both ends is by the construction which will make most available the
water power of the reach.
The United States Board of Engineers on Deep Waterways, in their
report to the Secretary of War, under date of June 30, 1900, considered the
development of both 21-foot and 30-foot navigation through botli these
reaches of the river, without consideration of water power possibilities. An
examination of that report shows their preference to have been for such
development as is above described, but in some cases the plan was deviated
from or only partially recommended because of its cost. When, however,
the value of the power is considered, the additional cost as a burden on the
public can be wholly eliminated.
The upper reach is as yet undeveloped for power purposes.
From the lower reach water is diverted to the power plant of the St.
Lawrence Power Company at Massena, New York, and a small amount of
power is developed at Waddington, on the American side, and near Mille
Roches, on the Ontario side, the total development being about 80,000 horse-
powers.
The Middle Rapids
The second section of the river affording water power begins at the
outlet of Lake St. Francis, where the Grand Trunk Railway bridge is located,
and extends to Lake St. Louis, a distance of fourteen miles, embracing the
Coteau, Cedars and Cascade Rapids, with a fall of 83 feet.
Power in this reach is developed by the Montreal Cotton Mills at Val-
leyfield, by the Canadian Light and Power Company through the abandoned
Beauharnois Canal at a power house below St. Timithee, and at Cedars by
the Cedar Rapids Manufacturing and Power Company and the Montreal
Heat, Light and Power Company, the latter by a diversion from the Sou1-
langes Canal, the total operating and contemplated development being about
210,000 horse-powers.
A very thorough investigation of the power possibilities of this reach
was made by the J. G. White Company of New York for the Canadian
Light and Power Company of Montreal in 1910, wherein was contemplated
diversions of water from Lake St. Francis by way of the enlarged Beau-
harnois Canal and a restriction of the flow through the rapids to a steam-
boat channel or chute for purposes of downbound navigation. While this
plan i.s entirely feasible, it does not provide for unbound traffic, and the
more logical procedure would be to so dam the rapids as to create slack-
water pools connected by locks. The larg? power development on the Cedar
Rapids would probably render desirable the development of a portion of


the Coteau Rapids power in a separate plant, using for its tailwater the
headwater level of the Cedar plant and passing at least the quantity of
water used by it. Navigation requirements would also call for two locks,
one at the foot of the Coteau Rapids and one at the foot of the Cedars,
with Lake St. Francis as the upper pool of the former and the so-called
middle pool between the Coteau and Cedar Rapids as the upper pool of the
latter lock. This plan of development would in no way interfere with exist-
ing water powers, but would enable the whole remaining flow of the river,
exclusive of the small amount needed for lockage, to be converted into
power, a part at the upper lock and the rest at the lower lock.
The Cascade Rapids would then be controlled by a separate dam with,
locks, and a power plant there would utilize the ent're flow.
The Lower Rapids
The last section of the St. Lawrence River to be considered from a water-
power standpoint extends from Lake St. Louis to Montreal, a distance of
eight miles, and is made up of the famous Lachine or China Rapids, with
a fall of about 45 feet. The Lachine Rapids Power Plant, the earliest large
development on the river,.has a capacity of about 13.000 horse-powers and
is the chief utilization thus far of the power in this section of the stream.
Plate VI shows a profile of the St. Lawrence River Rapids, with the
present navigation channels and the proposed development of combined
power and deep walerway.
Present Poiver Plants Use Only a Small Part of the Flozv, Whereas
the Whole Can be Used and Nai'igation Furthered
All of the present developments on the St. Lawrence River, like those
on the Niagara, utilize a wing or diverting dam extending a limited distance
into the river and connecting to a channel or conduit which conducts the
water to the site of the power house further down stream. In none of
them has an attempt been made to dam the river as a whole.
The only place on the outlets of the Great Lakes where a substantial
damming of the whole river has been undertaken is at Sault Ste. Marie,
where all but about two hundred feet of the river may be closed off; but
the successful construction of the Keokuk Plant on the Mississippi River,
where the entire river is closed, puts beyond question the engineering possi-
bility of such constructions on the St. Lawrence River.
The treatment, in the navigation scheme, of the rapids of the St. Law-
rence is one place where water power and navigation interests can join
hands and work unitedly for the same end. since that end leads to the great-
est benefit for each.
IV. Output, Income and Costs
Power of the St. Lawrence Could Supply Quebec, Eastern Ontario, New
England, Ncw'York. and Northern New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
and Satr Twenty Million Tons of Coal Annually
The possibility of the development of over 4,000,000 electrical horse-
powers from the waters of the St. Lawrence raises the question ns to its
probable market.


At the present tJme a radius of distribution of 300 miles may be taken
as an economical limit, although this limit is really dependent upon the value
of power at the point to which it is delivered.
The geographic center of the St. Lawrence power system is in Lake
St. Francis, and a 300-mile radius therefrom reaches the outskirts of New
York City and includes Boston to the south, takes in Portland, Maine, to
the east, Quebec to the northeast, Lake Nipissing and Cobalt to the north-
west, and Toronto. Hamilton, Niagara Falls and Buffalo to the southwest.
It embraces practically th? whole of New England and New York, with a
fifth of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
Plate XV is a map of the territory adjacent to the Great Lakes system
and shows the possible radii of distribution of St. Lawrence power.
Durin the first three months of 1920 there was generated by coal in
the portions of the state included above over 1,000,000 horse-powers of
electrical energy, exclusive of mechanical power produced but not converted
into electricity.
Allowing for necessary losses in transmission, which would probably
amuont to an average of 25 per cent, it is seen that in the replacement of
coal-generated electricity alone in the American territory served one-third
of the output of the river could be used. If electric traction should be sub-
stituted in this region for steam traction on th? railroads—which is the
most wasteful of fuel of all uses—fully another third of the output would
be absorbed, and the two combined uses would result in a saving of about
20,000,000 tons of coal annually, and a utilization of over two-thirds of the
capacity of the river, leaving the rema'nder for Canadian industry.
As Canada has, exclusive of the St. Marys, Niagar and St. Lawrence
Rivers, more than 2,000,000 undeveloped horse-powers in Ontario, and
over 4,000,000 in Quebec, it seems unlikely that Canadian interests will
desire to retain more than a third of the St. Lawrence power.
Plate XVI, which is taken from the report on the Long Sault Devel-
opment, shows possible water power sites in Ontario and Quebec and in
New York and the regions of economical distribution from the St. Lawrence
Valley.
Cost of St. Laurence Power Delivered at New York About the Same as
Steam Power Generated in Large Central Plants Already Constructed
The next and final question to consider is the cost of power to the con-
sumer at the limit of distribution. The cost per horse-power per year at
the generating station switchboards, under present conditions, may be taken
at $18.00, and the transmission charges, based on the experience of the
Hydro-Electric Commission of Ontario, may be taken similarly at S12.OO
per 100 miles. The resulting cost to the consumer at a distance of 300
miles would then be $54.00 per horse-power, plus the profit demanded by
the producer, which would probably bring the price to about $65.00. This
is approximately one cent per kilowatt hour and is below the present cost
of producing in all but the very highest grade steam generating stations


which were built before the present h:gh costs of construction. The com-
putation, however, indicates that 300 miles is about the limit of profitable
transmission under present conditions.
Cost of St. Laurence Water Power and Navigation Development
"The United States Board of Engineers on Deep Waterways," report-
ing in 1900, estimated the cost of a 30-foot channel from Ogdensburg to
Lake St. Francis at $35,000,000. To complete the channel to Montreal
would probably have involved twice as much more, bringing the cost in
1900 for the navigation development now proposed to $100,000,000. Due
to present increased costs of both labor and materials over 1900, it is esti-
mated on the foregoing basis that this cost would be trebled, making the
necessary waterway investment, exclusive of power development, S300,-
000,000.
A somewhat more accurate estimate of the cost of navigation improve-
ments may be obtained as follows:
Eight pairs of locks providing duplicate facilities for handling
traffic, based upon cost of locks at Sault Ste Marie $100,000,000
Eight dams based on the cost of Dam No. 1, on the Mississippi
River near Minneapolis 200,000,000
Improvements to waterway channels 50,000,000
Total for navigation improvements $350,000,000
To develop 4,000,000 horse-powers in connection with the navigation
improvements it is estimated that $100 per horse-power will be required,
bringing the. strictly power development investment to $400,000,000 and
giving a grand total for the combined scheme of $750,000,000.
Earning Capacity of the St. Lawrence Water Power
On the assumption that ultimately 4,000,000 horse-powers could be
disposed of at the generating switchboard for one-quarter of a cent per
horse-power hour, which is about what steam-gereated electricity costs in
the best large plants before the war, the gross income would be $87,600,000
annually. An allowance of 7 per cent for interest and depreciation on
waterway construction of $350,000,000 amounts to $24,500,000 and leaves
$63,100,000 as earnings of the power development, which is over 15 per
cent on the power development investment.
It is to be borne in mind in this connection that the above income can
only be realized after years of effort and that early returns would be much
less, and that therefore a long tenure of occupation must be assured to
attract capital to this field.


ST. LAWRENCE
WILLIAM H. ADAMS
In the following paper an attempt will be made to gather together the
main facts about the proposed improvement of the St. Lawrence River to
permit the entrance of ocean shipping into the Great Lakes.
A brief historical account of existing routes will be followed by a dis-
cussion of the need of improved transportation facilities and the advantages
of direct routes which will permit unbroken shipment from lake ports to
seaboard and foreign destinations. It will be shown that there is a large
existing tonnage of ocean cargo carriers of suitable draft to immediately
engaged in Great Lakes commerce with the sea when the barriers anj
removed.
The engineering features of the proposed work will be discussed and
the present status of the project shown.
Finally, an effort will be made to foreshadow the results which will
follow the making of ocean ports out of the cities bordering on the Great
Lakes.
The project to create from the Great Lakes an American Mediterranean
—to bring the Atlantic into the heart of the continent—is not new. Four
hundred years ago LaSalle and Marquette dragged their birchbark canoe?
around the rapids of the St. Lawrence and foresaw the day when this inland
empire would be in direct touch, by water, with the Old World. A half
century ago canals then deemed adequate were constructed to bypass the
rapids of the upper St. Lawrence and the Falls of Niagara.' But in the
intervening years the size and draft of ocean vessels has steadily increased:
due to the introduction of steel it has become practicable to construct much
larger ships; the principal harbors of the world have been deepened to
accommodate the larger craft and the inland waterways of the Great Lakes
system and in effect the lakes themselves have become barge canals to feed
the ocean ports. Ihe commercial ocean carrier of the last decades of the
nineteenth century had outgrown the Welland and St. Lawrence Canals.
An occasional ocean vessel finds its way into the lakes at this time.
Within the last month a cargo of Cuban sugar was received direct at a lake
port. A shipload of motor cars left Toledo for a foreign destination to
August of this year. But the principal traffic in the canals consists of barge
shipments to Montreal for trans-shipment to ocean carried at that port, and
traffic to Buffalo for a rail haul to New York City.
The New York Barge Can at.
The old Frie Canal across New York State from Buffalo to Albany
was built in the nineteenth century. Tt carried a large tonnage from the
start, and without doubt was the principal factor in the growth of New
York City as the premier port of America. Tbis canal has recently b'-en


replaced by a new and enlarged barge canal. This canal has cost the State
of New York over $160,000,000. It follows the old canal to a large extent,
but wherever the old canal consisted of a ditch along the bank of a river
the barge canal consists of a series of dams and locks, permitting power
towage at good speeds. It is intended that the final draft will be twelve
feet; the present effective draft is less than ten feet, owing to persistent
shoaling of rivers. The locks are 312 feet long; they will permit the simul-
taneous passage of a fleet of four 600-ton barges. Ihere are no toll charges.
The State has built terminals at most of the cities along the canal, and
is building comprehensive terminals at the port of New York for trans-
shipment from canal barge to ocean vessels.
The canal is crossed by hundreds of fixed bridges, with the very low
clearance of 15.5 feet; it was intended to make practically impossible the
navigation of the canal by any lake vessels, compelling trans-shipment at
Buffalo, the western terminus.
The St. Lawrence waterway will be subject to no such limitations. The
locks will permit the passage of 80 per cent of the world's tonnage; the
course will be over broad rivers with but a few miles of restricted channel;
the cost of trans-shipment will be avoided, and the excessive delays and
handling charges at New York will not be necessary.
Barge Canal Capacity
The total annual capacity of the New York Barge Canal, based on
available water supply for the operation of locks, is estimated at 20,000,000
tons—both east- and west-bound. In the operation of the old Erie Canal
it was found that local traffic required more than half the capacity of the
waterway. The thriving cities of central New York today will probably
require a large part of the tonnage for local needs. It is also expected that
a large movement of Lake Erie coal to the seaboard will develop via the
barge canal; it is evident that there is little available capacity for the com-
merce of cities farther west.
Seaboard Freight Movement
Detroit has an annual foreign trade (principally through the port of
New York) amounting to approximately 1,000,000 tons, and a seaboard
movement of over 5,000,000 tons annually. It seems probable that the total
seaboard movement of freight from Great Lakes states is well over ioo,-
000,000 tons annually. Complete figures are being compiled and will shortly
be available.
1 HE Railroad Outlook
In recent years it has become evident to most students of commercial
affairs that there is a decided economic limit to the continual increase of
railroad facilities in any given locality. New railroads can readily be built
into new territory, or new industrial centers developed, but it is being real-
ized that beyond a certain point the increase of rail facilities at present
industrial centers to take care of further normal growth can onlv be done


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
at a cost which throws a heavy burden on all other traffic. The inexorable
"law of diminishing returns" cannot be repealed. As a result we have
sharp increases in freight rates spread broadcast over the entire country,
largely to cover excessive operating costs of congested terminals and to
provide the vastly increased costs of new terminal facilities in old industrial
centers.
It is said that in the movement of freight from Chicago to New York
the cost to the carriers of handling the freight after it reaches New York
yard limits is actually greater than the cost of the entire line haul. And
on short hauls the terminal costs frequently eat up the entire revenue.
It is evident that if we are to have a continuing growth for our mid-
west industrial cities we must supplement the railroads by other transpor-
Map ok St. Lawhence amp Atlantic Seaboard, Showing Trade Routes
tation facilities. That this fact is already recognized is shown by the. rapid
growth of the relatively expensive motor truck haulage. It is also indicated
by the marked manner in which large industries are deserting our industrial
centers and creating their Garys and Marysvilles, where rail congestion will
not soon be a factor in local transportation.
At the same time, it is n oless evident that the agricultural interests of
the country are in a serious situation owing to shortages in transportation
facilities. While European markets are bare of grain and even our sea-
board cities are experiencing scarcity, producers are obliged to bold their
grain on the farms because of shortage of suitable cars. But the actual
shortage of cars is much less than the apparent shortage. The roads which
serve the grain-growing sections terminate at Great Lakes cities—Dulutb,
Milwaukee, Chicago, Toledo, Detroit and Cleveland. Here their cars of
grain are banded over to eastern lines and start tlieir journey to the con-


gested ports of the Atlantic seaboard. For long periods of time the average
movement of freight cars east of Chicago has been as low as 12 to 15 miles
a day. In effect, the cars of the western roads are used by the eastern
roads at warehouses for 23 hours out of each day, only moving about one
hour out of the twenty-four.
If the roads which terminate at lake ports could discharge their grain
into lake-and-ocean vessels in either foreign or coastwise trade, their cars
could stay on their roads and be rushed back for more grain. It has been
stated that this would be equivalent to the addition of more than 200,000
box cars to the equipment of the grain-carfving roads—more in value than
the estimated cost of the St. Lawrence improvement.
Comparative Costs, Rail vs. Water
1 he saving in freight costs due to such facilities would be very marked.
The average freight rate on the Great Lakes is not over one mill per ton
mile; the average rail freight rate is about 7.5 mills per ton mile. It is
probable that a lake-and-ocean rate on miscelaneous cargo from Chicago
or Detroit to the seaboard would be established at not more than $8.00 to
$10.00 per ton, as compared with an average rail freight rate of $12.00 to
$15.00 per ton. The saving in freight charges on grain alone has been
estimated at $20,00,000 a year if the all-water route were available. It
may be noted that the ocean freight rate between New York and Galveston,
a distance approximately equal to the sailing distance between Detroit and
New York, has frequently been as low as $4.00 per ton. Such rates depend
to a large extent on the tonnage of return cargoes offered. Sufficient data
is not available at this time to make more than a very approximate estimate
of probable rates in coastwise or foreign trade.
Shifting Statistics
The shipping using the Panama Canal in 1918 amounted, to 6,131,675
tons. The Suez Canal in 1918 accommodated a total shipping amounting
to 9,251,601 tons. The freight moved through the "Soo" canals in 1910
amounted to 91,288,219 tons. The entire foreign and domestic commerce
using- New York harbor in 1918 amounted to approximately 100,000,000
tons, of which 32,000,000 tons was in the foreign trade.
It is evident that present and potential business for a direct water route
from the lakes to the sea is many times greater than the tonnage using even
some of the more successful harbors of the world.
1 he following table gives, in round numbers, the tonnage using some
typical ports in pre-war years:
Philadelphia 30,000.000 tons
San Francisco Hay . . 10,000.000 tons
Norfolk, Va 20,000,000 tons
Charleston, S. C 1.000.000 tons
Savannah, Ga 2,500.000 tons
Manchester. England 3.500,000 tons


The present harbor and channel improvements on the Great Lakes pro-
vide for vessels with a draft of 21 to 22 feet. The locks of the new Welland
Canal will provide a depth over the sills of 30 feet, though the canal itself
is being dredged at present to a depth of only 25 feet. With an effective
draft of 22 feet, ships up to 6000 tons could use present lake harbors; with
a depth of 25 feet the channels could accommodate ships up to 10,000 tons;
if deepened to 30 feet all but the very largest ocean ships could enter lake
harbors. The following table of existing ocean shipping, using various
world routes out of American ports, indicates the practice of the United
States Shipping Board:

Available World Shipping
The total shipping of the world, grouped according to size, is given
below, and shows the great predominance of comparatively small vessels
(July, 1920):
Less than 1500 tons deadweight capacity, 12,501 ships; total tonnage,
6,563,340 tons deadweight capacity.
1500 to 3000 tons deadweight capacity, 3,251 ships; total tonnage,
6,401,400 tons deadweight capacity.
3000 to 7000 tons deadweight capacity, 5,250 ships; total tonnage,
23,951,000 tons deadweight capacity.
7000 to 15,000 tons deadweight capacity, 3,126 ships; total tonnage,
27,288,000 tons deadweight capacity.
Above 15,000 tons deadweight capacity, 238 ships; total tonnage, 5,303,-
000 tons deadweight capacity.
There exists shipping to the extent of nearly 35,000,000 tons deadwe'ght
capacity which could use the existing channels and harbors of the Great


Lakes if deep water connections were established. The present tendency
in ship design is to greater beam in proportion to draft, and there are afloat
today a number of cargo vessels of recent construction with a deadweight
capacity of more than 8000 tons on a draft of less than 22 feet.
New Welland Canal
The Canadian Government has in process of construction a ship canal
to replace the older Welland Canal between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.
The summit level of the new canal is the level of Lake Erie, giving unlim-
ited water for lockage. There are to be not more than seven locks to over-
come the difference in level of 326 feet. The locks will be 800 feet long
with a depth of water over the sills of 30 feet. The canal itself at present
will be dredged to 25 feet. (The most recent "Soo" lock has a depth over
the sills of 24.54 feet.) More than $25,000,000 has been expended to date
on the new Welland Canal; it is estimated as 40 per cent complete and could
Ik&gt; finished in three years. There will be no tolls: passage wil! be free to

ships of both the United States and Canada, although the United States will
pay no part of the cost of the work.
From Lake Ontario to Montreal
Between Lake Ontario and tidewater at Montreal there is a drop of
221 feet, as follows:
International River 92 feet
Canadian River 129 feet
The present St. Lawrence canals have a depth of 14 feet and are all
on the Canadian side. Passenger boats run the rapids, returning by way
of the canals.
The proposed improvement to accommodate ocean shipping will prob-
ably consist of a series of dams with navigation locks. This will provide
the broad reaches of the river in place of restricted navigation of narrow
canals. It will also permit the full utilization of the vast power possibilities
of the St. Lawrence River to be developed
Hydro-Electric Power
The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence system forms the greatest power
reservoir in the world. Drawing from watersheds in widely separated


parts of the continent the lakes act as huge equalizing reservoirs: the sea-
sonal variation in flow is extremely small.
The mean annual flow erf the St. Lawrence River is given as 240,000
second feet; the maximum and minimum flow do not vary more than 25
per cent either way from the mean. By utilizing Lake Ontario as a storage
reservoir with a variable head of five feet above present high water, the
annual variations on the flowage of the outlet river could be entirely equal-
ized.
The area of Lake Ontario is given as 7243 square miles; assuming a
maximum flow of 280,000 second feet, increasing from 240,000 second feet
to a peak in three months and falling to normal in the succeeding three
months, the excess water impounded would raise the level of Lake Ontario
about three feet above normal.
The high water flow of the Mississippi River at the Keokuk Dam is
more than thirty times the low, upon which the power development is nec-
essarily based, as no storage is possible at Keokuk. It will be seen that the
St. Lawrence is capable of developing a power of remarkable uniformity.
Moreover, with Lake Ontario as a storage reservoir it will be possible to
develop the power for domestic use with a widely fluctuating load factor.
In most hydro-electric developments the power is necessarily wasted when
not used; in the St. Lawrence the water can be merely held back until the
load increases.
This consideration enormously increases the value of the hydro-electric
power involved. At Niagara and at most other large water powers it has
been thought necessary from an economic standpoint that the power shall
be used in the development of basic industries, so-called, such as the chem-
ical industries, which can only exist on a very low cost for power, and
which can use the power continuously. This condition could be remedied
at Niagara by the construction of a dam at the head of the Niagara River
to hold back the water when the power load drops off; such an arrangement
would vastly increase the value of Niagara power, permitting its use with-
out waste for industries which cannot use power continuously, but which
can afford to pay a price for power on the basis of the cost of producing
power from coal.
This is evidently a higher use of power than in the so-called basic
industries which should be carried on where there is little industrial dennnd
for power, or where storage is not available.
The full development of the power at Niagara is hampered by the
groundless apprehension of the destruction of the scenic value of the falls
themselves and the rapids between the falls and Lake Ontario, where about
half of the drop occurs. It is also hampered by the very real necessity of
permitting a large part of the water to pass to carry floating ice past the
power intakes. This would also be relieved to a large extent by the con-
struction of a dam at the head of the Niagara River, and such relief would
greatly increase the power possibilities at Niagara.
The development of the power along the St. Lawrence below Lake


1.33
Ontario will not be seriously hampered by ice, as the impounding dams will
hold back the ice and permit the full flow of the river for power purposes.
To this should be added that in winter no water would be required for lock-
age on navigation. This further equalizes the power flow possibilities.
The recoverable power on the St. Lawrence is therefore much greater
than that which can be utilized at Niagara, where the drop is nearly 100
feet more. And for the reason the St. Lawrence power can be stored by
holding back the water in part, its value for power purposes is greater..
Trade Routes Between North America and Europe, Showing Comparative
Distances from Montreal and New York
It is estimated that not less than 4,000.000 horse-power is available!
This is many times greater than the present development at Niagara, which
has brought wealth and prosperity to the great industrial districts of Niagara
Falls in both the United States and Canada, and the benefits of which have
been spread over all of Ontario and over all of western New York.
Com. Saved
The saving on coal involved will probably take care of the future indus-
trial development of the states and provinces benefited for fifty years. And
for the present the rolling stock of the eastern railroads engaged in hauling
domestic coal will be largely released for other service.
Commission at Work
Authorized by acts of Congress and Parliament, the International Toint
Commission is at this time investigating the engineering and economic phases
of the proposed improvement. Hearings have been held in many interested
cities and districts in both countries, and by the end of (he year it is expected
that a report will be rendered setting out the estimated cost of the work,
the proper division of costs between the two countries, the probable effects
upon both countries from an economic standpoint, and suggesting methods
of financing the construction costs. It is probable that the coming session


THE MICHIGAN THCHNIC
of Congress will see initiated the necessary legislation involved. With a
reasonable rates of progress the way to the sea should be open by the spring
of 1925.
A Look Ahead
Lake cities which will then become ocean ports for eight months in the
year will enter upon a new phase of their development. Harbor facilities
must be provided, including ample warehousing for the accumulation of
cargoes during the closed season. Cities in the grain trade will doubtless
ship their grain direct to foreign ports. Industrial cities will derive their
greatest advantage from the direct and low-cost route between the middle
west and the seaboard. Direct trade will doubtless spring up between the
lakes and South America, with manufactured goods and grain as outbound
cargo and coffee, crude rubber and other tropical products as direct imports.
Cuban sugar could be refined in Great Lakes meet sugar plants, thus extend-
ing their operations over many months when the plants are now idle. Lake
shipyards will doubtless be able to compete successfully with the seaboard
in the construction of oce.an tonnage. During the war many vessels cf
moderate size—suitable for passage through the Welland Canal —were
built on the lakes, and high standards were set in speed and in economy of
construction.
The agricultural interests can expect direct shipments at very large
savings in freight of nitrates from Chile, phosphates from Florida, and
potash from Europe.
The population of the stales and provinces contiguous to the Great
Lakes or tributary thereto is less than 30,000,000 people. The area is suf-
ficient to support a population of 200,000,000, with a density less than Con-
necticut or Massachusetts. With ocean navigation at our gates and the
flags of all nations at our wharves, the opportunities for continued develop-
ment will be almost limitless. The constructive genius of America built
the Panama Canal in a decade, after centuries of failure in other hands.
The next great public work to which our engineers will be directed will be
the opening of a cbar highway from the Great Lakes to the sea.

It is of the utmost importance in
engineering, where often hundreds of
thousands of dollars are spent in con-
struction work, to have definite and
up-to-date plans prepared. These
must be ready before the first shovel
of dirt is lifted off the ground.
The miracle of a large power house,
lated specifications and careful prep-
arations in a tangible form, they must
be represented on paper with such
accuracy and precision as to leave no
room for arguments, misunderstand-
ings or disastrous confusion to the
men in charge of the actual field work.
To do this planning and arranging
Fie. No. i
growing out of the very mud until the
tireless turbines are spinning, is the
result of preconceived ideas and an-
alysis of conditions, guided by the
highest type of experienced engineer-
ing judgment.

of the electrical equipment, upon
which nearly every other general fea-
ture of an installation depends, is one
of the essential functions of the elec-
trical drafting department.
The erroneous conception common-
ly prevails that the chief business of
a drafting room consists in "pushing
the pencil." As a matter of fact, to
the designer, the actual drafting itself


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
is merely a mechanical procedure, per-
fectible by practice; incidental in its
nature, but nevertheless of importance
as far as the conveying of ideas and
arrived-at conclusions is concerned.
It is a recognized fact among the
veterans of the art that he is a good
drafting-man who can represent with
one line what another thinks he must
accomplish, with two. On the other
hand, it is obvious that a good drafts-
man is not necessarily a good engi-
neer, and vice versa.
Below we will endeavor to give a
rough and naturally incomplete out-
line of some of the more important
aspects which it is the duty of the elec-
trical drafting department to carry on.
As an illustrative example, let us at
random pick out an actual order such
as may come in at any time:
"It has been definitely decided to
build 'X-Ave' substation. F.rst con-
ference regarding same will be held
next week, but you are to start order-
ing' material at once."
To order material before definite
plans have been decided upon may
seem offhand an- anomalous condition
to fulfill. Nevertheless, from previ-
ous problems of a similar nature and
an intuitive insight into the possible
needs, gained by exhaustive expe-
rience, the designing engineers of the
electrical drafting department have
already a fair grasp of the probable
situation. And now begins a sort of
a rushing detective job in order to as-
certain what is wanted, how much and
when.
Some of the more indispenable
questions which require immediate
settlement are these:
(i) Will the complete structure be
built?
(2) If so, will it be completely
equipped?
(3) Must parallel operation of lines
be provided for?
(4) What make and what type of
oil switches should be selected?
(5) What make of lightning arrest-
er will be used?
(6) How many trunk lines will be
established at present?
(7) How many transformer-com-
partments will be provided for? etc.,
etc.
As a general rule, the man to whom
the work is assigned proceeds at once
with a one-line diagram of the main
circuits, and by means of templets
possible arrangements of machine-
units, oil switches .transformers, reg-
ulators, etc., are studied. It is impor-
tant that the general plans are drawn
up at once, so as to enable the other
departments, as architectural, under-
ground, piping, purchasing depart-
ment, etc., to cooperate with their part
of the work without hesitation. These
general plans, though as yet devoid of
show ng any details, nevertheless re-
quire considerable judgment and crit-
icism before they are ready for ap-
proval.
After final approval has been se-
cured, it becomes of vital importance
to develop further work in such a
manner that the excavations and the
building proper can commence at the
earliest possible time. Only after
these structural points have been defi-
nitely evolved, cleared up and ap-
proved are the mass of untold elec-
trical deta'Is attacked and disposed of
in methodical fashion.
Sometimes an outsider has the per-
fectly natural tendency to judge and
criticise the lay-out and design by the


137
standards of his immediate personal
experience and environment. It is for
this reason that he looks here and
there with disdain (alas i now and
then with an oath!) upon the plans
and specifications. He fails to realize
that these plans are the result of
painstaking study, many discussions,
and the cons-^quence of classified
knowledge to which he can, by the
tions to the small unit which it sup-
ports. And yet it may be just merely
big enough to support a generator or
a converter which it is intended to
carry, let us say, in six months from
today. .Then again, a door may be
specified to be apparently twice as
large as is necessary to move through
it the biggest single piece of machin-
ery in the station at the time. "The

nature of his work, have no access.
J fe cannot have the advantage of a
sense of perspective of the designing
engineer who, through years of expe-
rience in both the field and office, must
have the interrelation of constructive
units and details, to the organization
as a whole, at the end of his finger-
tips.
For instance, a generator-founda-
tion may seem to be out of all propor-
idea of that big door! Why, it's ridic-
ulous!" the thinking man on the job
may remark in passing. Well and
and true! But may be some fore-
sighted mind intends to move through
that very same door, and in the not
distant future, a unit larger than any
one in the station at the time.
These two examples, as cited above,
could be repeated in endless number.
Foresight means thousands of dollars


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
and frequently old equipment is in-
terchanged with newer one. Life the
skillful chess-player will make his
moves in thoughtful meditation, so
must the engineer ever be on guard,
and, to use the vernacular, be able to
see things and events "beyond the tip
of his nose."
The drafting room is not confined
merely to the laying-out and specify-
ing of large and small electrical in-
stallation with all necessary and often
complex switchboard wiring and con-
structions. The design of industrial
engineering equipment for Edison
customers, out-of-door substations,
field inspection, the making and keep-
ing of up-to-date engineering records.
All these actiivties come under the
scope of the electrical drafting depart-
ment.
Many novel ideas and new mechan-
ical as well as electrical devices have
been developed, either because their
need became obvious or because their
urgency arose out of the rapidly ad-
vancing stages of the art. It may also
prove interesting to note that the
methods of making the drawings
proper do not remain stationary; they
undergo slow but systematic changes.
This was true in particular during the
last few years when the lack of com-
petent hands evidenced several funda-
mental changes which have proven to
be of more than ordinary advantage.
As an illustrative verification of the
statement above, I want to show below
the conduit drawings of two different
stations in which the number of con-
duits used and their general arrange-
ment was nearly identical in almost
every respect.
Figure Xo. i shows the conduit plan
for the control of high tension oil
switches at Conners Creek Power
House. Please note especially that
each conduit has an indiv.dual number
somewhere along its course. (Only
part of courses are shown.) In strik-
ing contrast to Figure No. i, Figure
No. 2 shows a corresponding view of
the Waterman Avenue Station, in
which only those runs are shown
which are abnormal and of a non-
typical nature. In the latter figure
you. will observe the absence of nu-
merous confusing lines. All those
condu ts not shown are to be consid-
ered as typical and representative of
similar conduit lay-outs, and are re-
ferred to in a separate chart.
As will be readily seen, the drawing
is thus simplified to a high degree by
the application of this ingeniously de-
vised chart system which makes it pos-
sible for the man in the field to check
in a simple manner and with certainty
each individual conduit needed and
specified by the use of the drawing and
chart.
The underlying principle of this
chart rests essentially upon a stand-
ardized letter-number system, but its
detailed description would require un-
warranted space here to elucidate.
Figure No. 3 is a photograph of
part of the actual conduit runs as in-
stalled from the drawing, a cut of
which is shown in Figure No. 2.
The old-fashioned viewpoint was
to look upon drafting departments in
general as a necessary evil, if not with
feelings bordering on those which we
have toward luxury that could even-
tually be dispensed with. Even the
accountant system of today will class-
ify the upkeep of such departments
under the ledger on "Overhead
Charges," because they cannot neces-


'39
sarily participate in actual production.
The t me has passed when the pea-
nut-roasting gentleman of yesterday
will, after a few months' training,
develop into a draftsman,—still less a
designer! And the saying that "more
jazz can be learned in a month than
music in a year" holds true here as
well as in any other professional line.
We may here endeavor to hint at
the general routine of turning out the
drawings. First, a pencil drawing is
made on the spot. Usually, after a
day or two, when the pencil drawing
is completed, it is turned over to the
discriminating eyes of a "checker."
The latter must check every and even
the smallest detail and account by in-
dependent reasoning for each and
every dimension given on this pencil-
drawing. Especially for an under-
study, these are hours of "pleasant"
words and "gentle" criticism. Then
it is the time when the understudy re-
Fig. No. 3
made on transparent paper, because
sometimes certain details, already
drawn up before, are to be embodied
in the new drawing. If to the same
scale, it might be desirable to use them
for comparison as to size or location.
If necessary, these details can be
traced through this vellum, and this
alone is a saving of time.
On the other hand, in case of errors,
they can be readily erased, or if
changes are called for, they can be
ceives the least sympathy from the
vigilant checker and gets the most out
of his job.
It is evident that the checking is
very important, since even the best of
meH will make mitsakes. In construc-
tion work, often an apparently insig-
nificant error in the drawing may re-
sult in a loss of many dollars, and
sometimes a mistake may cost the life
of an innocent or a brave man.
After the pencil drawing has been


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
checked it is carefully traced on trac-
ing cloth, from which any desired
number of blue prints can be made.
When speed is necessary and no time
is left to make tracings, vellum is used
to make the blue prints. Once in a
very long while, in spite of all precau-
tions, there will creep an error through
this "second line of defense." As an
example, I recollect where one of the
lesser stars of the constellation (not
saying who, of course!) specified, in
a moment of absent-mindedness, an
opening in a concrete floor for cable-
ducts, in the following manner:
"Leave opening for future ducks!"


MENT BY THE SAN JOAQUIN
LIGHT AND POWER CORPORATION
R. C. STARR
The Kerckhoff hydro-electric devel-
ment of the San Joaquin Light &amp;
I'ower Corporation of Fresno is lo-
cated on the San Joaquin River, about
40 miles (64.41 led.) from Fresno, the
inland metropolis of California. The
project is named in honor of W. G.
Kerckhoff, President of the San Joa-
quin Light &amp; Power Corporation, and
a pioneer in the development of power
in the San Joaquin Valley.
The development consists of the
construction of a reinforced concrete,
constant angle arched dam, an 18' x
18' unl ned tunnel, 16,875 feet long
from portal to portal, driven from five
headings; a steel penstock line con-
sisting of three 8-foot steel pipes each
950 feet long, and reinforced concrete
power house with outdoor high ten-
sion step-up station, a single-pole,
110,000-volt transmission line, and
three substations.
Dam
The dam is a constant angle arched
dam, located in a narrow horseshoe
bend in the river, about two miles
(3.22 kil.) below the company's pres-
ent Power House No. 1. The storage
thus formed impounds 8000 acre feet
of water at 985 feet elevation, 4000
acre feet being above the pressure
tunnel. This will permit operation of
the plant at full load for thirty-two
hours, using 1500 cu. ft. per second.
The natural stream flow of the San
Joaquin River, with a drainage of
1800 square miles, is augmented by
receiving water stored by other proj-
ects on the San Joaquin River and its
tributaries, consisting of the Crane
Valley Reservoir of the San Joaquin
Light &amp; I'ower Corporation and I lunt-
ington Lake Reservoir of the South-
ern California Edison Co. Future
developments at Shaver Lake. Flor-
ence Lake, Blaney Meadows and Ver-
million Valley by the Southern Cali-
fornia Edison Co. will increase the
mountain storage of water by 300,000
acre feet.
On the top of the dam are installed
fourteen 14' x 20' Taintor radial
gates, manufactured by the California
Culvert Co. of San Francisco, and at
the bottom of the dam are three 72"
risinf stem sluice gates, manufactured
by Coffin Valve Co. of Boston, Mass.
The crest under the Taintor gates is
971.34 feet, and the elevation of the
walkway 994.5 feet above sea level,
or 104.5 above the original river bed;
the length on top is 570 feet. A spe-
cially designed motor-driven hoist is
provided for operating the Taintor
gates. The sluice gates are operated
by hand by means of a geared gate
stand. One opening for the Taintor
gates has been provided with a log
chute extending out from the face of
the dam, through which driftwood
may pass without injury to the gates
when passing over the crest. The crest
is constructed on a parabolic curve
and a lip extends out over the down-
stream face in order to discharge the
water some distance from the face and
free from the foot of the dam. The
material from the excavation was cast


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
down stream and formed considerable
of an embankment below the dam, so
that the water falls from the crest into
a pool about 30 feet deep, eliminating
all danger of cutting the rock at the
foot, or in any way effecting it.
The capacity of the Taiutor gates
permits the discharge of 100,000 cu.
ft. per second, this being sufficient to
take care of any floods. When the
gates are closed the elevation of the
water, with no overflow, will be 985
feet above sea level, and will back the
water up to the tail race of Power
House No. 1.
There is no fish ladder in connec-
tion with this dam, as the minimum
flow is about 800 cu. ft. per second,
and at low water stages all of this
water will be required for the genera-
tion of power, thus leaving the river
dry from the dam to the power house,
a distance of about eleven miles. If
sufficient water were permitted to dis-
charge over a fish ladder, the nature
of the river bed is so rough that all of
this water would be required for the
fish to navigate. In view of these
facts it has been decided to build a
fish hatchery near Power House No.
1 and transport the eggs from the
lower waters.
The dam contains 23.489 cu. yds.
of concrete (or about one-half that
required for a gravity section).
Diamond drilling at the dam site
was started May 20, 1919. Only the
rough preliminary surveys and engi-
neering work had been done to this
date. Excavation of the dam com-
menced July 20, 1919, Test holes for
the foundation had to he drilled and
a camp constructed before actual
work on the dam could he commenced.
The dam site (five miles from Au-
berry, the nearest railroad terminal)
is located at the foot of a mountain
slope, having a maximum grade of
92.5% and a difference in elevation
from river to top of grade of 1100
feet, with no road to the top of the
grade. Crews of men were assem-
bled, roads built, and machinery trans-
ported to the site. Men toiled relent-
lessly in the dust and heat, dragging
the air compressors and other machin-
ery down the dusty mountain side,
with poison oak on all sides. There-
was no time to be wasted building in-
clines and installing hoists. It was
necessary to have the foundations of
the dam in before the rising waters
of the fall rains could interfere with
the construction. First concrete was
accordingly poured on August 12,
1919, and the dam completed Decem-
ber 15, 1919.
At the time this development was
started, the San Joaquin Light &amp;
Power Corporation was exceedingly
short of power and it was therefore
necessary to put the power plant into
operation at the earliest possible mo-
ment.
Tunnel
The tunnel extends from Kerckhott
Lake, which is the storage reservoir
formed by the construction of the
dam, to a point near the power house
site, where it connects with the steel
penstock line to the power house. It
has an average driven cross section of
320 square feet and a total length of
16,875 feet, and is all through a hard,
grey granite formation and required
no timbering or lining. For the pur-
pose of driving the tunnel in record
ti.me, it was divided into four sections.
Section No. 1 and 2 is 8400 feet long
and passes under a mountain peak
1000 feet under ground. This is the
longest section, and due to the fact


•43
that it passes under a mountain peak
no shorter section could be driven. It
was opened on June 6, 1919, and com-
pleted July 27, 1920.
The north end was driven with
Denver Rock Drill Manufacturing
Co.'s Turbro drills, using \%" hollow
steel ranging in length from 4 feet to
20 feet. These drdls have an inde-
pendent rotating mechanism which
was especially adaptable to this par-
ticular ground. The other four head-
ings were drilled with Ingersoll Ley-
ner No. 248 drills, these drills show-
ing the lowest operating cost. The
Sullivan Class DX 61 drills proved
unsuccessful due to their high operat-
ing costs and the inability to keep
operators on the drill because of ex-
cessive vibration.
The method used in driving the tunr
nel is termed the "heading and bench
method," in which a bench about 14
feet long and 7 or 8 feet from the
roof is carried. A crew of four drill-
ers and four chucktenders operating
four drills,—called the heading crew,
—drill from 35 to 40 holes from 15
to 20 feet deep into the heading; the
holes near the center pointing toward
each other, coming together at the
bottom of the holes. These holes are
called the "cut holes" and when shot
pull out a wedge-shape piece of the
rock. The holes are drilled while the
former shot is being mucked out in
front of the bench. The mucking is
done with "Marion 40" steam shovels
operated with 100 pounds per square
inch air pressure furnished by a 4"
pipe line from the compressor house.
The dipper stick was made 7' 6" and
special i J^-yard tunnel dippers were
made to suit the clearance of the tun-
nel. The biggest factor in the won-
derful progress made on these tun-
nels has been the efficient operation of
the steam shovels. This is the first
successful attempt ever made to ob-
tain maximum progress with the
greatest economy. All former tunnel
progress records having been made
with pioneer headings mucked by
hand. All other tunnels of this size
where shovels have been used for
mucking have been constructed by
first driving a pioneer heading outside
the required tunnel section, and have
cost 50% more per foot where driven
in similar grey granite than these tun-
nels where the entire tunnels have
been mucked by steam shovels with-
out driving a pioneer heading in ad-
vance, although the wage scale and
cost of powder has been IOO/4 higher
than was paid before the war.
After the muck is cleaned up a crew
of five drillers and five chucktenders,
called the bench crew, are called and
drill from 12 to 16 holes horizontally
into the bench the same depth as the
holes in the heading. The drilling of
the bench requires about four hours,
after wh'ch this crew loads the holes
with about 700 pounds 60% gelatine
dynamite, and shoots in the rotation
desired by an electric current of 440
volts. The time of loading and shoot-
ing the holes is usually from midnight
to 7 A. M. About 8 A. M. the tunnel
is clear of gas and a crew starts clean-
ing up the tracks preparatory to mov-
ing the shovel ahead,—the shovel hav-
ing been moved back about 300 feet
to protect it from the shot. At 10 A.
M. the steam shovel starts operating
and about noon the drilling vrew is
ready to go into the heading again.
A complete round of 15 to 18 feet is
made in each 24-hour period.
The muck is hauled out in "West-
ern" side dump cars rebuilt to 6 ft.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
wheel base and body lengthened to
12 ft., holding approximately 6 yards.
These are hauled by 6-ton, 250-volt,
DC electric locomotives in trains of
four cars each.
The lighting of the tunnel consists
of 60-watt mill type "Mazda" lamps,
spaced about 50 feet apart. The light-
ing mains are 3-wire, No. 2-RC
The ventilation of the tunnel is ac-
complished with an American Blower
Co. fan, running 1200 RPM, belted
to a 150 H. P. induction motor. The
fan is arranged with dampers so that
gases may be exhausted or fresh air
blown in. The pipe line is a 24" diam-
eter, riveted steel, run within 300 feet
of the heading. This system is also
augmented by the compressed air re-
leased from the steam shovel and air
drills.
Water to the amount of 800 gallons
per minute was encountered in tunnel
No. 1, and this was effectively re-
moved with a 6" single stage centrifu-
gal pump, direct connected to a 440-
volt, 50 II. P. induction motor.
In Tunnel No. 2 Exide Ily-Cap
storage batteries were installed on
General Electric locomotives having
27.5 ampere rating on a five-hour
basis. They were connected to float
on the trolley carrying a pressure of
approximately 265 volts. The bat-
teries were always connected to the
trolley except when handling cars
within 300 feet to 600 feet from the
heading, where no trolley is installed.
This arrangement avoids the necessity
of maintaining a trolley wire to the
heading, where it would interfere with
the muckmg or shooting, or on the
dump, where the track is not fixed.
The method of floating the battery on
a trolley permits the use of a much
smaller capacity in battery and does
not require taking batteries out of
service for charging. These batteries
have been in operation five months
without discharging more than 50%
at any time, and are now in first-class
cond.tion. "Sangamo" ampere hour
meters are installed on them, which
indicate the amount of ampere hours
in the battery at all times. The only
maintenance cost has been the filling
with distilled water as required. Two
electricians took care of all the elec-
trical work, including the maintenance
of the light and shooting circuits,
which would otherwise have required
four. A 37.5 KW generator supplies
ample power for three locomotives.
The locomotives thus equipped were
able to haul four 6-yard cars loaded
with muck on a level grade at 6 miles
per hour.
The crew working from Adit 1, or
the south end of the long section, has
the envious record of not losing a sin-
gle round from February 1, 1920,
driving 2479 leet of tunnel in 177
days, or a daily average of 14 feet.
The maximum progress for one round
was made on July 25 by Tunnel No.
1 crew, when 19' 4" of tunnel was
shot out, the drillers having used 20-
foot steel.
Penstock Lines
The penstock lines consist of three
steel pipe lines connecting the south
portal of the tunnel to the water
wheels. The pipe is 8 feet in diam-
ter at the portal and 7 feet at the
wheels. Just outside of the portal are
three 8' rising stem gate valves, manu-
factured by Joshua Hendy Tron
Works of San Francisco, weighing
complete 60,000 pounds each. The
valve and by-pass is operated electric-
ally from the power house switch-
board and so electrically interlocked


145
as to require the operation of the gates
and by-pass valve in proper sequence.
Just ahead of the water wheels are
installed three 84" Butterfly valves,
manufactured by Allis-Chalmers Co.
of Milwaukee, Wis., electrically con-
trolled from the switchboard. They
are designed to withstand the full
penstock pressure when it is desired
to inspect the wheel and leave the
water in the penstock. Air relief
valves are installed on the top of each
pipe line in two strategic locations to
permit the entrance of air when the
penstock lines are emptied, to prevent
collapsing. No stand-pipes are used
on these penstock lines, but a surge
tank lias been cut out of the solid
granite a short distance back from the
tunnel portal. This surge tank con-
sists of a chamber 40 feet in diameter
at the roof of the tunnel, tapering up
to 17 feet diameter at the spillway ele-
vation, above which is approximately
the elevation of the top of the Taintor
gates of the Kerckhoff dam. The tun-
nel will be operated under about 50
feet of head and this surge tank will
tend to keep constant the flow of
water in the tunnel under changes of
loads on the generators, and provide
a relief for surges in the penstocks.
The penstock lines were manufac-
tured by the Western Pipe &amp; Steel
Co. of San Francisco in record time.
This company deserves special credit
for its assistance in getting the Kerck-
hoff project into operation early
enough in the fall to meet the condi-
tions of shortage in the San Joaquin
Valley for irrgation purposes. It
gave precedence to this work, to the
exclusion of all other orders, thus per-
mitting the pipe to b° completed and
installed before the completion of the
tunnel, so that the plant could go into
operation at the earliest possible mo-
ment. The penstock lines were com-
pletely erected, riveted, calked and
anchored in thirty-two days' time.
Power House
The power house is located in a box
canyon through which the San Joa-
quin River flows. The floor elevation
is 675 feet above sea level. The build-
ing is of reinforced concrete, with
100' x 36' floor space, and is 70 feet
high. It is equipped with a Shaw 50-
ton crane with a 10-ton auxil.ary,
using 440-volt alternating current mo-
tors. The building is built into the
solid granite side of a mountain and
access thereto is obtained by an in-
cline railway 1000 feet long w.th a
maximum grade of 100% just before
it enters the power house, which is at
right angles to, the longitudinal center
line of the building. A retaining wall
extending 15 feet above the floor
forms the lower part of the r.ver-side
of the build.ng in order to protect the
machinery from any possible flood
which might occur due to a drift jam
or other causes below the power house
which might back the flood water up
the canyon. The protection against
flood waters in the narrow canyon in
normal low water accounts for the
long shaft, the distance between the
center line of turbine and generator
floor being 25 feet.
The building, from floor to roof,
was constructed in thirty-seven days,
and the crane installed while forms
were still under the roof. During this
same period the water wheels were
erected and grouted in.
Equipment
The equipment consists of three
15,000 H. P., 360 RPM, vertical shaft,
single runner, "Frances" type turbines,


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
direct connected to 14,200-KVA, 6600-
volt, 60-cycle, 3-phase, alternating cur-
rent generators; two 500 H. P., simi-
lar type turbines, running at 900 RPM
and direct connected to 300-KW, 250-
volt exciters, with 15-KW, 125-volt
DC generators, mounted on the top
for generation of the control current,
with which the plant is operated. All
of the above equipment was manufac-
tured by the Allis-Chalmers Manufac-
turing Co. of Milwaukee, and deliv-
ered on scheduled time in spite of all
difficulties due to labor shortage. Spe-
cial credit should be given them for
this achievement and the fact that the
Allis-Chalmers erectors, direct from
the Niagara Falls institution, erected
the complete hydraulic generator and
exciter equipment in less than ninety
days, the first twenty days erecting
two water wheels without the aid of
the crane. AllJs-Chalmers winders
wired the stators in the field in four-
teen days per machine.
The switchboard and low tension
switches were manufactured by the
(General Electric Co.
The generator units are operated
with the latest type of Kingsbury
bearings, mounted on top of the unit,
and supporting the entire weight of
the rotating part as well as the reac-
tion from the runner due to the water
passing through the wheel. The bear-
ings were especially designed, and the
method of installing the cooling coils
to keep the temperature of the oil
within proper limits is considered
more efficient and economical and will
be used for the first time in the Kerck-
hoff machines. This system eliminates
the possibility of foreign particles and
scale from the pipes getting into the
oil, which usually occurs when the oil
is circulated through cooling coils;
and furthermore, it eliminates the
necessity of expensive filters which
would otherwise be required.
The governor is the latest type,
manufactured by the Allis-Chalmers
Co., in which the governor weights
are mounted on the main shaft and
mechanically connected to the relay
and floating valves, which admit oil
pressure to the gate operating cylin-
ders.
A friction break is mounted on the
underside of steady bearing and break
blocks press up against a ring on the
under side of the rotor. Oftentimes
a small leakage through the water
wheel will keep the generator rotating
long after it has been disconnected
from the busses and these breaks are
used to bring it to a stop when desired.
Each machine is provided with its
own motor-driven governor oil pump,
pressure and receiving tanks, and a
hand-oil pump, the oil pumps being
interconnected so that either of the
pumps may be used on any machine.
The main gates on both the Allis-
Chalmers generators and the exciter
sets are electrically controlled from
the switchboard, so that the machines
may be started up and brought up to
speed directly by the switchboard op-
erator. The main water wheel units
are provided with pressure relief
valves which are operated automat-
ically by the governor or by an ex-
cessive increase in pipe line pressure
due to surge on load changes.
Switchboard
The main control switchboard con-
sists of a General Electric bench
board with pedestal type Terrill volt-
age regulator. This was wired com-
pletely in the field in fourteen days
by San Joaquin Light &amp; Power Com-
pany's construction department em-


'47
ployees. Watt hour meters and relays
are placed on the back of the panels.
A mimic bus on the bench gives a one-
line diagram of connections. Temper-
ature exploring coils are inserted in
the generator windings with temper-
ature indicator on the switchboard,
enabling the operator to read temper-
ature of generator at any time.
The 6600-volt system is the trans-
fer bus system, using one main bus
and a transfer bus which permits op-
erating the generator direct connected
to its bank of transformers on a unit
system or on the bus to other banks
if its bank is out of service. A bus
scctionalizing switch is provided, sep-
arating the main bus into the sections,
from either side of which the station
service may be taken. The generators
and step-up transformers are protect-
ed by differential relays which open
all switches to isolate the faulty appa-
ratus. The generator and exciter field
rheostat and field switches are remote
controlled from the switchboard.
The step-up transformers are nine
in number, having a capacity of 5000-
KVA, 6600/127,000 Y, which form
three banks. No spare transformer
is provided, as this capacity will per-
mit putting the load of three genera-
tors on two banks without serious
overheating. They ate located out of
doors and close to the power house
building, supported by concrete beams
constructed with catch basins in such
a manner that oil from an exploded
tank quickly runs away from the
transformers and is discharged into
the river.
The high tension switching tower
consists of three bays of steel struc-
ture erected on the mountain side back
of the power house building. The
brace and supporting trusses are at
an angle of 45 degrees and parallel
to the slope of the mountain side. The
high tension buses are also in a plane
of 45 degrees, necessitated by the na-
ture of the ground. The high tension
switches are Type K-4-B. manufac-
tured by the Kollman Electric &amp; Man-
ufacturing Co. of Los Angeles, and
are the four-break type, guaranteed
to stand the A. I. T. E. test. Ohio
Brass Co. oil-filled bushings are used
on all the 127,000 Kellman switches
and the step-up transformers.
The 110,000-volt transmission line
is approximately 110 miles long, ex-
tending from the Kerckhoff power
house to Sanger and Corcoran and
later to McKittrick, connecting with
the steam generating station at
Bakersfield. The conductor is an
aluminum cable having a cross section
of 266,000 CM spaced 10 feet apart
and insulated with seven suspension
insulators on the suspension and eight
on the strains. The poles are 60 feet,
cedar, with channel iron cross-arms of
the wishbone type. Poles are spaced
about 580 feet and have creosoted
butts.
The substations are all of similar
design and are of the outdoor type.
Auto transformers are used of 5000-
KVA capacity, stepping down from
110,000-volt to 60,000 volt, distribut-
ing the power over the present lines.
Transportation of Material
All material was received by rail at
Auberry on the San Joaquin &amp; East-
ern Railway and hauled to the dam
site and power house with Mack five-
ton trucks, White two-ton truck and
a 75 H. P. Holt caterpillar, with trail-
ers of 10-ton and 35-ton capacity.
The trailers are the cross connected
reach type, so that both axles turn,
requiring the trailers to track. The


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
haul is over mountain roads for five
miles, with many turns and a maxi-
mum grade of 12%. Six 10-ton trail-
ers, loaded, have been hauled over this
road in one train and 1000 tons of
equipment were transported in seven
days. The penstock pipe was hauled
in about 22-foot lengths with Mack
five-ton trucks and a two-wheel five-
ton dolly, average weight of the sec-
tions being about eight tons.
The heaviest piece of equipment
weighed 58,000 pounds. This . was
hauled with no difficulty on a special
35-ton Holt trailer having steel wheel
60" diameter and 14" tread to the
power house from Auberry, a distance
of five and one-half miles, in four
hours, including time taken to load
and unload trailer.
At a time when industrial conditions
are so upset throughout the country,
this article would not be complete
without reference to the wonderful
efficiency of labor which has prevailed
on this job. It has been the policy of
the company to pay a fair day's wage
for a fair day's work, and it has de-
manded and received the service paid
for. The wonderful progress has beeti
made by the firm by just treatment of
the men. by those in charge of the
work, securing the hearty cooperation
of all employees. No one man should
receive special credit for this wonder-
ful accomplishment, for it is the result
of each, from the lowest to the highest,
taking a personal interest in the part
he had to play in the construction of
a great power plant. Neither envy,
discord, nor confusion was suffered
to interrupt the peace and tranquility
which has pervaded the job. Such an
achievement, completing a 50,000 H.
P. hydro-electric plant in 15 months
(the first in America started and com-
pleted since the war), under present-
day conditions, would not have been
possible had it not been for the won-
derful support given the writer by the
management: W. G. Kerckhoff, Pres-
ident; A. G. Balch, Vice-President;
A. G. Wishon, General Manager; A.
Emory Wishon, Assistant General
Manager; I. W. Alexander, Stock

Purchasing Agent, all of whom de-
serve special credit for their support.
Of the organization, the following
men deserve special credit for the part
they performed: Henry R. Stevens,
Superintendent of Construction; L. L.
Ell.s, Assistant Superintendent; Dick

The successful tunnel contractors
were D. D. DeLuca and W. A. Whit-

C. O. CAREY
In the eastern part of China a vast
plain from 150 to 500 miles wide ex-
tends from the vicinity of Peking and
Tientsin to Hang-chow, a distance of
about 900 miles. This plain forms an
area roughly semicircular in shape,
with the Shantung promontory on the
east occupying the center of the circle.
It is of delta formation ,built up by
the deposits carried down from the
mountains by the numerous streams,
including the Huang Ho, or Yellow
River, and the Yangtse Kiang. Of
the numerous streams draining the
mountains, the Huang Ho has been
most instrumental in the formation
of this great plain. On account of
abnormal conditions this stream has
made no permanent channel for itself,
but has changed its course across the
plain from century to century, taking
possession of whatever channels gave
it easiest access to the sea, sometimes
flowing to the north of the Shantung
peninsula and sometimes to the south.
For the past four thousand years the
Chinese have tried to keep it under
control by building dikes along its
course, but at frequent intervals it has
broken through these dikes and flood-
ed vast areas, causing great loss of
life and property.
The Grand Canal traverses this
plain from Hang-chow to Peking, cut-
ting through the Yangtse near Chin-
kiang and the Huang Ho a few miles
nort hof Chi-nan. The oldest part of
the canal was dug in 486 R. C, and
the last section was completed about
1290. The streams traversing this
flood plain are kept in their channels
by means of artificial dikes. On ac-
count of lack of control of the water
coming into the Grand Canal, during
the rainy seasons the streams pour
their flood waters into the canal in
such quantities that it cannot be car-
ried away rapidly enough, resulting in
the overtopping or breaking through
of the dikes and flooding large areas
of land along the canal; and during
the dry seasons of the year, through
many miles of its course there is not
sufficient water to navigate even the
smaller canal boats. That part of the
canal extending from the Yellow
River north to Lin-ching, a distance
of about 65 miles, has been dry for
about twenty years, most of the stream
bed being under cultivation at the
present time. That portion of the
canal from the Yellow River south to
the southern border of Shantung
Province is navigable for a few
months in the year for small boats.
In 1916 arrangements were made
with New York financiers for a loan
of $6,000,000 to the Chinese govern-
ment for the reconstruction of that
part of the Grand Canal which ex-
tends through Shantung Province.
The loan agreement was not com-
pleted on account of the disbanding
of the Chinese Parliament, but funds
for a preliminary survey were ad-
vanced by the American financiers.
Mr. Joseph Ripley, consulting engi-
neer, a graduate in civil engineering
in the class of 1876 of the University
of Michigan, was selected to go to
China as chief engineer, in charge of
the preliminary surveys and investi-
gations. The other American engi-
neers on the work were Mr. J. W.


THE MICHIGAN TECIIXIC
Beardsley, assistant chief engineer,
and Messrs. R. W. Merrill, R. D.
Goodrich, H. B. Merrick, C. O. Carey
and H. Brodie, principal assistant en-
gineers. All but Mr. Beardsley, who
is a graduate of Cornell University,
are graduates of the University of
an offic2 organization. The remainder
of the party sailed from San Fran-
cisco on August 23, and reached
Shanghai September 21. The party
was detained here one week on ac-
count of bandit activities in Shantung
Province. Trains could not be run
Map op Territory Covered by Engineers in China
Michigan. The last three named on
the list are members of the surveying
staff of the College of Engineering.
Mr. Ripley, Mr. Beardsley and Mr.
Goodrich left for China about the
middle of July, 1918, and arrived in
Tientsin about the middle of August,
where they established headquarters
for the work and began to get together
through to Tientsin. This was not a
very encouraging outlook for the
work, for the disturbances were
through the territory in which most
of our field work was to be conducted.
After waiting a week for a train the
party left Shanghai by boat and ar-
rived at Tientsin after a four days'
trip up the east coast of China.


151
About six weeks' time was con-
sumed in Tientsin organizing field
parties, getting together equipment
and supplies, arranging for military
protection and passports for the par-
ties .passing customs with equipment
and baggage, and other "red tape"
transactions required for putting an
official party of the Chinese govern-
ment in motion.
Four parties were put into the field
in November, 1918. A base line party,
himself the personal representative of
the director-general, and assumed a
great deal of dignity, as it was his
duty to notify the magistrate of our
arrival in his district and to make
official calls on the civil and military
authorities of each district through
which the party passed. The Chinese
delight in ceremony, and the deputy
cashiers seemed to enjoy this part of
their work very much. The Ameri-
can engineers sometimes received and

laying out a control line for the sur-
veys along the canal; topographic
party, precise level party, and a hydro-
graphic party. Each party was made
up of an American engineer in charge,
a deputy cashier, Chinese engineers,
survey coolies, coolies, servants, po-
lice guards and soldiers. The deputy
cashier was an English-speaking Chi-
nese who carried the funds for the
party expenses, bought supplies, ar-
ranged for transportation, quarters,
etc.. and looked after the coolies, ser-
vants and soldiers. Tie considered
returned calls of the officials, and oc-
casionally were entertained at a Chi-
nese dinner. These were very inter-
esting experiences and were always
enjoyed, although the Chinese food
does not appeal very strongly to the
foreigner at first. At these dinners
the foreigners always made a demon-
stration of their skill in handling chop
sticks, to the delight of the natives.
One feature that was new to the
experience of the American engineers
was the apparent need of military pro-
tection for the field parties. During


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
the fall of 1918 bands of bandits were
reported to be very active through
that part of the country where sur-
veys were to be started, and the Chi-
nese officials were reluctant to let us
go into the field unless accompanied
by sufficient protection. Only a few
months before an American engineer
had been captured by bandits in Honan
Province and carried into the moun-
tains and held for about two months
for ransom. The Chinese government
finally secured his release by making
to be the stopping place for the night.
As we approached the village the na-
tives began firing off their guns. This
caused some excitement for a few
minutes. We learned that the vil-
lagers, on seeing our soldiers and
boats approaching, thought it was a
band of bandits and fired their guns
to scare us away. One large boat was
lost by a hydrographic party on the
Yellow River, on account of a little
brush with a small band of bandits.
Two soldiers of the hydrographic
Survey Party Moving Alonc the Canal Dyke
certain concessions to the bandit lead-
ers. Twenty-five or more soldiers
were sent out with each field party.
Although there were frequent rumors
of bandit bands in our vicinity, no seri-
ous encounters occurred during the
course of the work. We avoided
traveling after night as much as pos-
sible and endeavored to have our
quarters in the larger villages which
were better protected. On one trip
up the canal the party was compelled
to travel some distance after dark in
order to reach a large village that was
party had been sent up the river about
two miles from the village where the
party was quartered to get a boat for
use in stream gauging. When they
were returning with the boat bandits
on the opposite shore demanded the
boat, and on the refusal of the soldiers
to bring it to them began firing at the
boat. The soldiers returned the fire.
The boatmen became frightened, and
deserting the rudder and leaving the
sail up. crawled under deck. It was a
windy day and the boat was soon
overturned in the swift current. Sol-


'53
diers from the village heard the shoot-
ing and came to the rescue. The men
were picked up by another boat, but
the overturned junk was lost.
The field work of the surveys was
done by Chinese engineers. All but a
few in minor positions could speak
English. Some of them had received
a part or all of their technical educa-
tion in American universities, the re-
mainder in Chinese colleges or univer-
sities. For the most part we found
the Chinese engineers were very pleas-
ant and agreeable men with whom to
work. They are somewhat slower
than thi average American, but are
patient and trustworthy in the per-
formance of their duties. They do not
have as much initiative as the western
people who have had more experience
in handling modern scientific prob-
lems, but they have a keen sense of
responsibility, and "loss of face-' is a
very serious thing to the Chinese. One
Chinese engineer in charge of a hv-
drographic party making current meter
measurements on the Yellow River
lost a meter in the swift current by the
breaking of the supporting cable, and
was unable to recover it. He returned
to the field office with his party and
handed in his resignation, and no
amount of persuasion could induce
him to return and continue the work.
The means of transportation in the
interior of China are very primitive.
()ne of the greatest needs in the devel-
opment' of the country is better trans-
portation facilities. With an area of
about 4,000,003 square miles and a
population of 400,000.000, China has
only about 6,000 miles of railroad.
The canal systems need improving,
and the highways in the part of the
country through which our work ex-
tended are for the most part cart trails
across the fields. Apparently very
little attempt has ever been made at
road improvement, and in many places
these highways, which have been in
use for generations, have become
channels several feet deep and are
filled with water during the rainy
season.
In traveling through the country the
field parties used boats whenever it
was possible, as small house boats
could be obtained on the navigable
streams, which furnished living quar-
ters for the men as well as transpor-
tation for men and equipment. On
cross-country trips where boats were
not available carts were used. The
baggage was usually carried on heavy
two-wheeled carts drawn by oxen,
cows, mules, ponies and donkeys
hitched in various combinations and
in varying numbers, depending on the
load and the road to be traveled. Sur-
vey coolies, servants and soldiers took
turns riding on these carts with the
baggage. The engineers on these
trips usually rode in Peking cars. This
type is a two-wheeled- covered cart
without springs or seat, the occupant
sitting or reclining on the floor. It is
just large enough to accommodate one
person conveniently inside, and two
persons can sit in front with the feet
hanging down on the sides. In some
cases it was necessary to use wheel-
barrow for transportation. The writer
made one trip of about twenty miles
and another of about sixty miles in
which wheelbarrows were used to
carry baggage and equipment and part
of the personnel of the party. On the
latter trip the Chinese engineers rode
on barrows, two men to a barrow.
The American engineer was provided
with a sedan chair carried by four
coolies, with two extra coolies for a


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
change at frequent intervals. On one
of these trips a caravan of fifty-two
barrows was used.
The Chinese wheelbarrow is differ-
ent from those used in the United
States. The wheel is larger and the
frame is built around it so the load is
practically balanced at the sides of the
wheel. The coolie pushes the barrow
by means of a strap tied to the handles
and passed over his shoulders. If the
load is very heavv one or more coolies
wooden bearings and apparently they
rarely ever put any grease on them.
Consequently, the screeching noises
they make as they are pushed along
with their heavy loads are rather dis-
tressing to the ears of those not accus-
tomed to them.
On the trips through the interior it
was necessary for each American en-
gineer to have his own servants, carry
provisions, cooking outfit, beds and
bedding. Such things as beef, pork,
House Boats of Hydrograthic Party—Junction of the Shush Ho, at Left, with
Grand Canal
are put in front with ropes to help
pull. Frequently a donkey is hitched
in front and sometimes an ox or a
cow.
It is not an uncommon sight to
see a string of barrows crossing the
country with sails on them, if a good
breeze happens to be blowing in the
direction in which they are traveling.
In many parts of China the barrow is
one of the common means of travel.
I have seen as many as four women
riding on one barrow.
The heavy wooden wheels of these
barrows have wooden axles with
mutton, chicken and eggs could be pur-
chased at the larger villages. Such
supplies as canned goods, canned
cream, sugar, flour, butter, lard, cof-
fee, etc., were purchased in Tientsin
in quantities and carried with the bag-
gage. Chinese cooks who could speak-
some English and had had training in
our style of cooking were employed.
Living quarters were secured in
different villages as the work pro-
gressed. Frequently the buildings in
temple grounds were used, sometime':
schoolrooms and sometimes the build-


155
ings of private families. We carried
tents with us, but could use them very
little on account of the alleged danger
from bandits. Sometimes a tent was
put up inside one of the large rooms
of a house during the cold weather.
It was cleaner and warmer inside the
tent. Small oil heaters were carried
during the winter months to provide
a little heat. The Chinese do not have
much heat in their houses, depending
mostly on additional clothing to keep
them warm during cold weather.
In our travels through the interior
villages we saw very few indications
of hostility towards us or our work.
The people seemed to have the impres-
sion that we were going to do some-
thing to better their conditions, but
could not understand why we did not
get to work instead of running up and
down the canal and across country
with funny looking instruments. We
found the natives good-natured, usu-
ally with a smile on their faces, but
as full of curiosity as small children.
One could not stop anywhere without
soon being surrounded by a throng of
all ages, staring in wide-eyed wonder
at the curious looking foreigner. The
news of our approach seemed to travel
ahead of us. As we came in sight of
a village we would usually see a crowd
of people standing outside awaiting
our arrival, and they would follow us
through the streets just as the small
boys in America follow the parade on
circus day. I suppose it was no dif-
ferent, however, than what would
happen if a Chinese dressed in his
native costume were to travel through
the villages of Michigan. Human na-
ture, after all, is very much the same
wherever you go. We found the na-
tives were curious about our clothing
during the cold weather. They would
feel of it and then shake their heads
and point to their own heavily padded
clothing. Ours felt very thin in com-
parison.
On our arrived at Lin-ching, where
the first surveys were started, crowds
were gathered along the canal watch-
ing as our baggage and equipment
were being unloaded. The next day
the American missionaries told us that
some of the native Christians came to
them and asked if we were from thei.
country. On being told that we were
they replied that we were not Chris-
tians, for they saw us carrying our
family gods ashore. They had seen
our boxes of instruments, painted
rods, etc.
The handling of Chinese money is
a nightmare to a person when he first
attempts to use it and keep track of
his expenditures. The dollar is the
unit and the silver dollar is in general
use. The small coins in use are the
silver ten-, twenty- and fifty-cent
pieces, and the copper one-cent pieces,
and cash (a small copper coin with
a square hole in the center). The sil-
ver dollar is worth more than 100 cop-
pers, and the rate of exchange varies
from day to day, from 130 to 135 cop-
pers usually being equal in value to
the silver dollar. Neither are the
twenty-cent pieces worth one-fifth of
a dollar, nor the ten-cent piece one-
tenth of a dollar. About $1.20 in
small silver coins equal the value of
the silver dollar. However, a few new
silver coins are coming into circulation
which are worth their face value.
These are called "big" money as dis-
tinguished from the others, called
"little" money. The "big" money
coins are not very popular because
there are so few of them in compari-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
son with the others that one is-apt to
spend them as "little" money and lose
the difference in the value of the two.
Paper money is in general use in the
cities, but that of one city is not ac-
cepted in another. In the interior one
must carry his money in silver dol-
lars, copper coins and cash.
The development of China is hin-
dered not only by lack of adequate
transportation and communication fa-
cilities but by the lack of public order
an dsecurity. There is no strong cen-
tral government, and there is a con-
stant strife between north and south.
On account of the poverty and weak-
ness she has become the prey of
stronger and more aggressive nations.
There is an opportunity for Amer-
ican money and American brains to
help China in the development of her
vast natural resources for in a greater
measure than the people of any other
nationality the Americans have the
confidence of the Chinese. The friend-
ship of China for America is manifest
everywhere. They regard the United
States as a nation which desires to
secure fair play for them in their deal-
ings with the other nations of the
world. The United States refused to
accept indemnity and has never de-
manded concessions and territory, but
has sent to China thousands of men
and women who have spent their lives
there doing unselfishly deeds of mercy
and benevolence. They look on the
United States as a nation with no self-
ish aims, to whom they can look for
leadership in the solution of their
problems in such a way as to guaran-
tee their national integrity, and to a
realization of American ideals of
democratic government.

doesn't have to worry about conflicts, extra hours, and the like. T-Te is
assigned a number in line, according to the lateness of his arrival. His
classification card is made out for him. The close surveillance of the man
at the door prevents him from getting ahead of his rightful place in the line.
But when he has gone through the fresh ordeals and is embarking
on the adventure of his sophomore or junior or senior year he is allowed


more independence in choice and action. Very frequently, in classification,
such a thing as rotation and the question of "He who comes first is served
first" are not considered. In the search for duplicate record cards, in the
struggle for a hearing at the classification desk, and in the battle at enroll-
ment, it is usually a case of the survival of the fittest or the most successful
at line plunges.
Physical endurance is a necessary requisite in a man if he wishes to
classify and enroll.
To reduce time and effort in classification and enrollment to a minimum,
efficient men in numbers, all insistent on observance of rotation with respect
to priority of arrival, are required.
Join The
Professional
Societies
The University of Michigan Engineering Society has been
reorganized and the various branches are entering upon
the year's activities very enthusiastically. But to make it
a successful institution each department must support its
branch organization. The Tech of M. I. T. gives some very good reasons
for joining such societies which are very applicable to our case:
'"The professional societies of the various courses in the Institute have
started campaigns for new members, and it behooves every man to stop and
consider the significance of these organizations. In the first place, each
student should look upon his alliance with one of these societies not only
as being beneficial to himself but also as a matter of duty, in much the
same light as he would look upon his enrollment in an athletic activity.
"Men come to Technology to fit themselves in the engineering profes-
sions, but how little they realize that all their lectures, laboratory and class-
room work gives them nothing more than a foundation for their future
work. They must have also a knowledge of the practical application of
their studies, a knowledge of current engineering projects, and most impor-
tant of all, a knowledge of the men who are prominent in the profession.
To supply these connecting links is the function of the professional societies.
"One of the most frequent criticisms made of Technology graduates is
that, however excellent their ideas may be, they are unable to present them
verbally. At the meetings and smokers of the societ'es there is a fine oppor-
tunity for discussion. Also, the most successful men in the country can
be obtained to speak at these meetings, and Technology's ability to procure
these men is unique. Further, industrial plants are open to the inspection
of Institute students, and the highest officers of the concerns are usually
detailed to conduct the men through their factories. This is taken advan-
tage of by very frequent excursions to many places in Boston and vicinity.
"The most valuable thing a man can get out of the societies is the
acquaintances and friendships which he forms, both with students and with
the prominent men that he meets. On graduation a man with such an
acquaintance is in a far better position than a man who has not had the
opportunity to meet these people, and after graduation the successful man


is the one who can count on assistance and advice from others in his pro-
fession with whom he has become acquainted through his professional
society."

This book is an extension of a briefer work, entitled "Engineering

Some suggestions valuable in the preparation of the text were given by
Prof. J. E. Emswiler of the Mechanical Engineering Department in the
University of Michigan.
Well planned, with material arranged in logical order, and with numer-

of information. The print is large and clear, and the volume, which is well
bound, includes a large appendix which contains data helpful to the student.
The book, which is now being used as a text in the Engineering College at
the University of Michigan, presents the fundamentals of engineering ther-
modynamics clearly and with the necessary detail. It should meet all the
requirements of a college text on this important subject.

BUDGET TO PROVIDE FOR ENGI-
NEERING LABORATORIES
It is expected that the State Legislature
will pass the proposed budget of the Uni-
versity, without deductions. Foremost
among other items is the provision for new
engineering laboratories which are to cost
$1,500,000. The present buildings and
equipment are entirely inadequate for the
large number of students enrolled. Orig-
inally planned for 1,000 students, they are
now crowded with 2,080. Although there
has been no increase in floor space since
1910 and 1911, the following table shows
the expansion in the past and the prospec-
tive expansion for the future:
Number of
Year Students
1900 260
1905 1,030
1005 1,030
1010 1,330
1915 1,630
1920 2,080
1923 3,000
1930 3.500
Another table which sheds interesting
light on the situation compares the floor
space per student in the other universities
with that of Michigan:
Squure Feet
University per Student
University of Pennsylvania... 352
Johns Hopkins University... 348
University of Iowa 312
University of Illinois 250
University of Michigan 137
This crowded condition has been ob-
served by all of us. The shops are so
crowded that many students are unable to
take required shop courses until later in
their course. Sections in other classes are
much larger than desirable. Everyone real-
izes that crowded condition in class rooms
not only keeps the men from coming into
close contact with instructors, but causes
poor ventilation, dangerous to health. A
larger teaching staff would be impracticable
for lack of class and lecture rooms. Tem-
porary buildings are housing .1 few of the
laboratories. The automobile laboratory is
in the old S. A. T. C. building. The high-
way and evaporating laboratories are in the
old heating plant and the Department of
Surveying, which was in the New Science
building for a year and a half, is in the
southwest wing of the New Library build-
ing. Laboratories must be housed in sub-
stantial quarters if they are to give best
results. It can be readily seen from these
facts that new buildings are the only solu-
tion of the problem. The proposed new


161
building will give room for the Engineer-
ing Shops, Materials Testing Laboratory,
Stca mLaboratory, Hydraulics Laboratory,
Heating and Ventilating Laboratory, Re-
frigerating Laboratory, Automobile Lab-
oratory, Aerodynamic Laboratory, Electri-
cal Laboratory, Highway Laboratory, Evap-
erator Laboratory, and the Chemical Engi-
neering Laboratory.
The present shop building will be con-
verted for the use of the Architectural,
Drawing, Surveying, and Military Depart-
ments. The present engineering labora-
tories and the space now used by archi-
tecture and drawing would be converted
into class and lecture rooms. The Chemical
Engineering Laboratories could be used for
chemistry, thereby increasing the chemistry
floor space by one-third. Shop and labora-
tory is simpler and less expensive than
ordinary buildings, affording maximum re-
lief at minimum expenditure.
REVISED PROGRAM OF STUDIES
In the winter of 1918-19 the Faculty ot
the Colleges of Engineering and Architec-
ture appointed a committee to study our
curricula and recommend any changes
thought desirable. This committee sub-
mitted its report late in the fall of 1919-20.
From that time until last June the Faculty
discussed the main points involved and
then directed the Dean to incorporate the
several conclusions reached in a new cur-
riculum and submit it for further discus-
sion this year (1920-21).
The most notable result of Faculty de-
liberations last year was the proposal of a
five-year program of studies so arranged
that students could still graduate at the
en dof four years with the B. S. degree,
A part of the technical work now given
in the four-year course of study would be
transferred to the fifth year, with perhaps
some new work added. But the amount
left would qualify four-year graduates to
undertake the usual problems falling to
graduates.
Another feature of the proposed pro-
gram was the inclusion in it of a greater
amount of non-technical work, such as his-
tory, political economy, philosophy, astron-
omy, geology, as well as the extension of
work in some of the present subjects taught
—English and modern languages, for ex-
ample. The work would be arranged on
the so-called "ribbon" plan as distinguished
from the "block" plan; that is, the work
would be divided into, say, literary and
general studies as one ribbon, mathematics
as another, sciences as a third, and tech-
nical subjects as a fourth. The ribbons
would start at the beginning of the first
year and continue through the four years
and also the fifth.
Under this plan, a freshman would not,
as now, be required to get off all of his
English and modern languages and mathe-
matics in the first two years, but these sub-
jects would extend into the later years. At
the same time, the student would not wait
for two years before taking up his tech-
nical work, but would begin it at once on
entering college. Thus, if unable to con-
tinue beyond the first year, he would gn
out into the world with some technical
training which would better fit him to earn
a living.
It is, of course, impossible to say what
will be the result of Faculty discussion this
year. But it is not too much to say that
the Faculty will probably adopt some pro-
gram of studies which will enable the turn-
ing out of better educated engineers; that
is, more broadly educated, and that in the
future we shall find our graduates in posi-
tions made available to them by that broad-
er training.

INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH
The Department of Engineering Research
wa sestablishcd on October 1, 1920, by the
Board of Regents. Its purpose is to bring
the University in closer relationship with
the industries of the state. This relation-
ship will largely be through the medium
of research work and the rendering avail-
able of the library and its facilities on a
scale not previously employed.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
This department has been under con-
sideration for some time. In 1916 the Re-
gents were advised by the Engineering
Alumni of Chicago of the desirability of
establishing some such department. This
matter was again brought to the attention
of the Regents in February, 1919, by a
communication from a committee from the
Michigan Manufacturers' Association con-
sisting of Mr. M. S. Neal, Mr. F. S. Bigler,
and Mr. H. C. Bulkley. The subject of the
communication was referred to a Univer-
sity committee consisting of Regents Han-
chett, Clements, and Leland, the President,
Dean M. E. Cooley, and Professors J. E.
Emswiler and A. E. White. Their report
relative to the establishment of a depart-
ment was favorable and contained recom-
mendations regarding the type of organ-
ization. An important meeting with the
leading manufacturers of the state was
held in Ann Arbor last May at which ad-
dresses were made by President Hutchins,
Dean Cooley, Professors H. E. Riggs, H.
C. Anderson, J. C. Parker, A. H. White,
H. C. Sadler, E. Lorch, and by a number
of the state's industrial leaders. At this
meeting the men from the industries which
are hereafter to be known as the Advisory
Board of 100 appointed an Executive Com-
mittee of 17, with Mr. J. M. Murphy, of the
Murphy Chair Company of Detroit, as
chairman, and Mr. J. M. Lovett, general
manager of the Michigan Manufacturers'
Association, as secretary.
This Executive Committee met with the
University committee July 7 of this year
and recommended to the Regents the step
which they took on October 1, 19.20—
namely, the definite establishment of a De-
partment of Engineering Research.
It is the primary object of this depart-
ment to work with the industries in lines
of technical and scientific research. It is
not the intention for the department to
undertake work of a purely routine char-
acter, for that can be performed to better
advantage in the plant proper or in testing
laboratories close by the plant tlwn at the
University. Since the University is a pub-
lic institution, the results of the work done
in the department must be open for pub-
lication. Because of this requirement it
is believed that some of the work under-
taken will at least be through the medium
of associations or groups of manufacturers
interested in the same field.
Owing to the limited funds which the
University authorities have available for
new expenditures it will be necessary for
the industries having work done to pay a
considerable portion of the cost. Instead
of this being a handicap, it is felt that it
will be an asset, for it will create a wider
interest among manufacturers than would
be the case were the state to bear all of
the cost, and the problems will tend to be
a more happy combination of the strictly
technical and thoroughly practical than
would otherwise be the case.
But a mere glance at figures giving the
industrial growth and wealth of the state
will be convincing evidence of the need
of such a department. Within the past few
years the state has become the seventh state
industrially in the Union. But a few years
ago it was thirteenth. In point of products
produced the value from industries in 1910
was close to $2,000,000,000, whereas the
value for the same period in farm products
was approximately $500,000,000. The pro-
ducers of values from the farm have been
able to turn to the Michigan Agricultural
College for scientific help, but there has
been no place especially established t:&gt;
which the producers of industrial values in
the state could turn until the formation of
the Department of Engineering Research.
The department is in the Colleges of En-
gineering and Architecture and is directly
under the dean of these colleges. The ad-
ministrative work of the department is in
the hands of a director. There are two
important committees attached to the de-
partment; one an administrative committee,
consisting of the heads of the departments
of civil, mechanical, electrical, chemical,
marine, and aeronautical engineering and
architecture, in addition to the deon and
the director; the other a committee of 100


163
leading manufacturers and technical lead-
ers in the state selected with reference to
(1) location, (2) type of industry. This
hoard has already organized and elected
an Executive Committee of 17.
Albert E. White, Professor of Chemical
Kngineering, has been appointed director.
A considerable number of problems are
already in the possession of the director
which have been received without any so-
licitation or advertisement regarding a de-
partment established for the performance
of research work. It is believed that when
it becomes generally known that such a
department has been established many
problems of a wide and varied character,
the solution of which will be of real value
to the industries and through them to the
people of the state, will be presented.
A. E. White.
FELLOWSHIP GIVEN TO ENGINEER
In order to encourage investigation and
research on cutting tools, the National
Twist Drill &amp; Tool Company, of Detroit,
has offered a fellowship of $500 each to the
two men who find the best method of mak-
ing and using drills and cutters.
Mr. J. B. Whinery, '21E, who. after
graduating from the Literary College,
cime over to the Engineering and spe.it
the past summer doing research work in
the shops. Mr. Whinery became interested
in the offer of the fellowship and began
to investigate the use of cutters and drills.
His work has developed so well that the
twist drill company has awarded him one
of the fellowships. His experiments have
been on the milling cutter and he has en-
deavored to find the best operating speed
for highest efficiency, the angle at which
the teeth should be set for the least wear,
and consequently at which the cutting is
increased to a maximum.
Up to the present time these investiga-
tions have been very satisfactory and have
definitely fixed the correct angle and rate
of speed for milling cutters so that the
highest efficiency can be obtained.
NEW GUN ARRIVES FOR COAST
ARTILLERY UNIT
The materiel of the Coast Artillery Unit
is rapidly becoming complete, and nearly
every week brings some new equipment.
The latest arrival is a new French 155 mm.
G. P. F. long range gun, mounted on a
split-tail carriage. This is the type of gun
that was used so successfully against the
Germans and has been since adopted by
the United States instead of the six-inch
rifle.
Engineering students who have military
credit and who are taking courses in chem-
ical or mechanical engineering may have
the opportunity of joining the ordnance
division of the Reserve Officers Training
Corps next semester if thirty additional
men announce their willingness to take the
new courses.
More than the" required 100 students
signed up for the aero course. The ord-
nance unit is now the only engineering unit
not established. If this unit is formed an
attempt will be made to establish calvary
and infantry units, to which all freshmen
or upperclassmen with military credit will
be eligible.
At present there are three officers and
four enlisted men assigned to the Univer-
sity. An additional officer and one enlisted
man will be stationed here if the ordnance
unit is added.
TURBINE MAKES A WORLD'S
WORLD'S RECORD
At 5:20 p. m. March 8, 1920, there was
finished what, from available data, is a
world's record for the continuous, opera-
tion of large steam turbines, in that the
unit was stopped for the first time since
the early morning of December 15, 1919.
This continuous operation covered a period
of 84 days, n hours and 36 minutes, and
established a world's record for the opera-
tion of multiple element steam turbines of
the cross compound type. The machine
was the 45,000 K. W. turbine manufactured
by the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufac-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
turing Company for the Narragansett
Electric Lighting Company.
During this run there were generated
51,104,000 K. W. H., or considerably more
than the total yearly output of the Narra-
gansett company for any year prior to 1915.
The average daily output was three or four
times the maximum possible annual out-
put of the first machines owned by the
Narraganset company. During this record
run it turned out about 84.2 per cent of
the total station output. Another interest-
ing feature in connection with this record
pumped through the generator each hour
to fill the turbine room seventeen times.
Not the least important feature by far
to promote continuous operation is the
self-contained lubricating system, which
contains 800 gallons of oil. This oil is
pumped through the cooler, which keeps
down the temperature, to the bearings at
the rate of 600 gallons per hour, and in
addition to lubricating the bearings and
dissipating the heat due to friction, etc.,
is used to operate the main admission
valves. Considerable importance is at-
TrRiiiNE Generator which Hoi.d&gt; World's
Record
is the wide variation in load at various
times, from a minimum of 6,000 K. W. to
a maximum of 41,000 K. W.
Some conception of the enormous amount
of steam and air used by this machine may-
be had by some homely comparisons. Dur-
ing the present run, sufficient steam was
passed through the machine to equal about
540 times the entire weight of both elec-
tric and steam ends and the bed-plates.
Also, to keep the generators cool, over 18,-
000,000.000 cubic feet of air were passed
through the generators, which equals 2,000
times the total weight of the generators
and their bed-plates. Sufficient air is
tached to the oiling system, since its fail-
ure for thirty seconds would wreck the
bearings and possibly carry destruction to
other parts of the machine. An auxiliary
is also kept ready for immediate use, to
prevent any such occurrence.
AN ENGINEERING EXHIBIT
An engineering exhibit was held for the
last time in hte spring of 1916. War con-
ditions and the general unsettled period
subsequent prevented its reoccurrence in
either of the two years following. With
th; return of practically normal conditions


i65
in 1919 an exhibit was possible, but due to
lack of concerted effort among those in-
terested, the project was not seriously con-
sidered.
Because no exhibit has been held since
1916, the undergraduates as a whole are
not familiar with the real value of an ex-
hibit to their college and to themselves.
The exhibit, as its name implies, is an
exhibition of engineering works and tools.
It goes farther: it shows what the engineer
is thinking and his relation to the outside
world. It gives the visitor an insight into
pletion of a worth while task, and in this
cooperation they would learn to know not
only their fellow workers but also the work
would foster more intimate relations be-
tween the students and the teaching staff.
Finally, the exhibit would show the engi-
neering student how his chosen profession
is looked upon by society. It would per-
haps make him realize the responsibilities
that the engineer of the future must
shoulder.
An exhibit will cost much in time and
labor, but the returns will be well worth
New Turbine in University Power Plant
the practically unlimited fields of engineer-
ing advancement and it brings him to real-
ize the true importance of the engineer and
the world's utter dependence on him.
Each department in the college contributes
its share toward the complete exhibit. The
men in each department endeavor to pres-
ent phases of their respective arts, in which
an outsider would be most interested and
which would give him the best idea of their
particular field. In working up an exhibit
the men may learn many technical points
which would not be taught regularly in
their college courses. They would learn
to cooperate toward the successful com-
the effort. Let's start the ball rolling and
make the 1921 Engineering Exhibit the best
ever.
POWER PLANT INSTALLS NEW
GENERATOR
The great increase in the lighting and
electrical equipment of the University has
forced the power plant to continually over-
load their generators, which increased the
possibility of a breakdown, which would
greatly inconvenience many departments.
In order to do away with this constant
overloading and also have plenty of power


THE MICHIGAN TBCUNIC
if one machine should break down, the in-
stallation of a new generation has been
made necessary.
The new generator is an A. D. T. eight-
pole, 6oo-kilowatt, three-phase, 6o-cycle,
non-condensing turbo-generator without
exciter, and is to operate at 360 R. P. M.
on 125 pounds of steam, with from five to
eight pounds back pressure. It will take
care of all the present overload and can
be run in place of the Corliss generator
should it break down.
Its installation gives the power plant a
good margin of safety and allows the lab-
oratories to continue experiments which
until now have been attempted but seldom
because of the fear of overloading the plant
too much.
STATE BOARD REGISTERS
ENGINEERS
Has Permanent Offices Located in
Detroit
The new law regulating the practice ot
architecture, engineering, and surveying in
the State of .Michigan has now been in
effect for a little over a year, and the joint
Board appointed by the Governor to suc-
ceed the old Board of Architect Exam-
iners has been functioning for about the
same length of time. The first few months
after the Board was appointed were occu-
pied in petting organized, corresponding
with other State Registration Boards in
order to determine their methods, and in
locating suitable offices for the Board. Or-
ganization was finally completed and offices
were opened in Detroit the early part of
December, ioto. Regulation application
blanks were adopted and sent out to all
applicants, and since that time about one
thousand applications have been received.
Under the provisions of the new Act, all
the architects, some five hundred in num-
ber, who had been already registered by
the former Architects Board, were auto-
matically considered as registered, so that
the new Board has been devoting its time
principally to engineers and surveyors.
Also, while the law provides for the regis-
tration of all kinds of professional engi-
neers and surveyors, it is only mandatory
with those who engage in engineering or
surveying as principals or who hold re-
sponsible public positions as engineers or
surveyors, and of this number, as would
naturally be expected, the greater part are
civil engineers.
Over One Hundred Rejected
While it is true that the greater propor-
tion of applicants have been those who
applied for registration without examina-
tion, and who might be expected to be regi-
istered as a matter of course, it has been
necessary to devote a great amount of
time in investigating applications and dis-
cussing them in order to determine whether
or not the applicants were entitled to reg-
istration. This may be realized from the
fact thnt about one hundred applications
have been rejected to date. The reasons
for rejection have been many and varied,
among them being lack of the required
amount of experience, evidence from reli-
able sources that the applicants were in-
competent, and lack of evidence to show
that the applicants actually were engineers.
There have also been numerous applicants
who have been advised that they were not
eligible for registration without examina-
tion and that they would therefore be re-
quired to pass the examination before they
could be registered. Of this number, some
have already taken the examinations and
have obtained a passing grade, while others
have cither failed parts of the examinations
or refused to take them. About six hun-
dred applications have been approved, some
two hundred are still awaiting considera-
tion by the Board, while the rest are either
waiting for examination or are being held
until such time as the particular questions
involved in them can be discussed at
greater length.
No doubt there arc a great many engi-
neers in Michigan who are eligible for
registration who have not applied as yet.
Most of these are engineers who are not
immediately affected by the law and who
therefore do not feel that it is to their ad-


167
vantage to be registered. The law has been
in effect too short a time as yet to deter-
mine whether or not it will be beneficial
to an engineer to be registered. Registra-
tion is not required in very many states as
yet, but the practice of registration is
spreading and some states have already
passed laws much more rigid than the
Michigan law which practically require
•that all architects, surveyors and profes-
sional engineers of any sort who hold posi-
tions of responsibility must be registered.
Registration by Examination
In conclusion, a word should be said on
the subject of registration by examination.
A great many of the young engineers have
felt that they have been done an injustice
in being required to take an examination
while others whom they feel have not as
good qualifications have been registered
without examination. We will grant that
this is not entirely fair, but the same has
been true of the other registration laws
when they first went into effect, such as
the ones regulating the practice of law and
medicine. There are certain people who
have to be admitted because it is impos-
sible to pass a law legislating people out
of the business in which they have been
engaged. We will except of course the re-
cent dry laws, but in that instance at least
everyone was treated alike. However, the
intention of this Act is that eventually
everybody who practices architecture, engi-
neering or surveying in this State will have
to come up to certain requirements fixed
by examination, and when that day comes
it is to be hoped that the status of these
professions will be very much improved
thereby. Also, while each state realizes
that when it adopts a registration law it is
compelled to register certain undesirable
members of the professions of its own, it
does not intend to accept applicants from
other states merely because they were in-
eligible for registration in their own states.
Therefore, some states refuse to register
foreign applicants without examination
unless they have been registered in their
own states by examination. Obviously, an
engineer, and particularly a young engineer,
never knows when he may wish to migrate
to another state, and it is going to be much
easier for him to arrange for registration
in his new location if he can show that he
has been registered in his original state by
examination. An examination for civil
engineers was held last April. Twenty-
four candidates were examined. Half of
them received a passing grade, while most
of the others only failed in one or two sub-
jects in which they will have a chance to
be examined again at the next semi-annual
examination.

AGGRESSIVE POLICY TAKEN BY
NEW PRESIDENT
President Burton Urges Each Dean
to Consider the Development
of His Unit
The growth of a University depends pri-
marily upon the efficiency and ambitions
of its President and Deans. That Michigan
has men of high caliber and of great hopes
for its future can be seen from the follow-
ing, which was sent by the President to the
various Deans:
"It will be extremely helpful to me if
each Dean will set forth as fully as he
finds convenient his plans and aims for the
development of his unit during the next
five years.
"'Any facts or considerations which you
desire to present will be vitally interesting
to me. You must not assume that I know
anything about your history, problems or
aims. I have endeavored to acquire some
knowledge of the University, but only as
you present the facts to me shall I be sure
that I am dealing with realities rather than
rumors. I want to see your college through
your lens.
"In setting forth your five years program
I shall appreciate it if you find it agreeable
to place the emphasis upon educational con-
siderations. What do you regard as the
real work of your college? Are you se-
curing the right type of student? Is the
actual work of the class room and labora-


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
tory of university grade? Do you feel that
members of your Faculty are giving suf-
ficient consideration to the methods of in-
struction? Does research flourish in your
department?
*******
"Above all, I should be profoundly
pleased if you should share with me your
highest hopes and aspirations for the future
of your College. The days just ahead
should be full of rich hopes and possibili-
ties. I believe that we must think in new
terms and courageously attack the vital
issues of University work. Some univer-
sity in America is destined to exercise real
leadership during the next decade. Mich-
igan has done it before and she can do it
again. I do believe that we need not be
afraid of the magnitude of our task. If
you have big dreams in the back of your
head, now is the time to drag them out into
real light."
DEAN COOLEY NAMED ADVISER
TO POSTAL COMMISSION
Dean Cooley has been appointed to the
advisory council of the United States Pos-
tal Commission, which was created by
Congress to improve the postal service.
The men appointed to this commission, of
whom there are seven, are men of wide
experience and large users of the mail.
It is understood that several engineering
projects are to be considered in an effort
to make the service more efficient. Among
these projects is to be considered the pneu-
matic service in the large cities, and the
building of a mail tunnel between the Penn-
sylvania terminals in New York City.
Dean Cooley was elected president of the
American Society for the Promotion of
Engineering Education at the last meeting
of the society, which was held in Ann
Arbor last June.
broaches for keyseating. The machine is
equipped with instruments to measure the
strength of pull. It is hope that this broach
will be able to demonstrate the advantage
of broaching certain classes of holes over
other methods of machining them.
Research as to the correct shape of teeth
for milling cutters is being conducted at
the request of the National Twist Drill and
Tool Co. A special shaped cutter of but
one tooth is placed in a Milwaukee miller
and the time and forces acting on each cut
are measured. It is thought that the time
is recorded accurately to one five-thou-
sandth part of a second. The shape of
milling cutters now in use are based on the
idea of a rotary file.
FIXATION OF NITROGEN BY THE
CLAUDE PROCESS INVESTI-
GATED
Prof. A. II. White has spent the summer
in France investigating the Claude Process
for the fixation of nitrogen of the air. Due
to the war, little has been done in the
commercial use of this process. Professor
White traveled under the direction of the
Air Nitrates Corporation.
BROACH GIVEN TO MACHINE SHOP
The American Broach Co. of Ann Arbor
has given to the machine shop one of their
broaching machines, together with several
EQUIPMENT OF THE CENTRAL
SHOP IS NOW COMPLETE
The Central shop, which is located on
the second floor of the shop building in
the room which was known as the drawing
room, has received and installed all neces-
sary equipment and has been in operation
for the last month. The organization of
this shop is similar to the tool-making de-
partment of a large industrial concern. It
will make such special equipment as will
be needed in the machine shop, and also
construct equipment for any other depart-
ment of the college. The advantage gained
in having a shop of this nature in connec-
tion with the University is the lack of red
tape necessary in its operation. Articles
can also be produced cheaper due to no
overhead expenses.


169
A large number of machines were pur-
chased from the Ordnance Department at
15% of cost price. Among the equipment
of the shop may be mentioned an Acme
automatic screw machine, Le Blond lathe,
Rivett lathe, Walcott lathe, turret lathe,
surface grinder, Snyder drill press, Van
Norman duplex miller, Garvin profiler,
Kempsmith miller, and Oakley plain
grinder.
J. M. NICKELSON ENGAGED AS A
PROFESSOR
Mr. J. M. Nickelson has been engaged
as a professor to teach auto engine and
chassis design. Up to the present year he
has been employed as an experimental en-
gineer for the General Motors Corporation.
He was stationed at their Buick plant at
Flint, Michigan. Mr. Nickelson was in the
Ambulance service during the war. Mr.
Lay will continue to teach the practical and
laboratory work of the automotive depart-
ment.
CHEM. ENG. DEPARTMENT TO DO
ORDNANCE WORK
The Chemical Engineering Department
has recently entered into a contract with
the Ordnance Department of the U. S.
Army to make a study of the properties of
cartridge (70-30) brass. The problem con-
sists of two parts, which are independent
of each other and will be worked out sep-
arately An attempt will be made to find
the relationship between the tensile strength,
Brinell hardness, and grain size, and how
these properties are varied by changing any
one of them.
The causes of "season cracking" (aging)
of 70-30 brass, as it is found in cartridge
cases, constitutes the other part of the
problem. "Season cracking" is , cracking
caused by slight corrosion until the area
has been so reduced that it fails under the
internal strains that are present.

RESEARCH ON THE SHRINKAGE
OF STEEL
For the past few months Prof. Wood,
of the Chemical Engineering Department,
has been interested in the shrinkage of
steels under repeated heat treatments. The
work was begun on carbon steels. It was
found that the shrinkage varied as the car-
bon content up to the so-called eutectoid
steels. The work is to be continued with
alloy steels. The results of this research
will determine the number of times a piece

can be heat treated over again, because of
faulty heat treatment, before the piece must
be scrapped as undersized.

But the spring that does the squeaking
Is the one that gets the grease.
METHODS OP SHOP INSTRUCTION
CHANGED
Machine Shop to Start Production on
Spring Spreaders
A change is being made in the Engineer-
ing Shops in the direction of Modern Meth-
ods of Production. Shop 4 is at present
largely manual training, which class of in-
o
activities of a production organization and
will fit him much better for after life than
merely high class manual training.
Michigan Will be First
The tendency in the above direction is
being felt in various parts of the country,
but so far as is known the Engineering
College of Michigan will be the first to
attempt production on a scale as outlined
above. The articles to be made have a
market already and the Engineering Shops
are undertaking certain responsibilities in
agreeing to furnish these in definite quan-
tities. This responsibility, however, is abso-
lutely essential for this new move, and it
is expected that this responsibility will be
passed on to the students taking this course,
•Spring -Spreader
UnwEn&amp;rroFMicHiaM
struction is being more and more covered
by up-to-date high schools.
This coming fall a change will be begun
that will mark a decided alteration in the
methods of our shop instruction. The com-
mercial manufacture of a spring spreader
(two designs) has been undertaken by our
shops for the purpose of giving an oppor-
tunity to teach production on a real pro-
ductive scale. It is expected to get up to
a production of two hundred per day. The
two articles, while small, have a good
variety of operations in their manufacture.
Each student taking Shop 4 will be re-
quired to perform every single operation
connected with the manufacture of these
spring spreaders and will also have to take
a turn at such administrative jobs as time
clerk, stock chaser, inspector, foreman, etc.
In this way it is expected that a student
will get a fair idea of the multitudinous
because some of the psychological phases
of modern production work are equilly if
not more important than the technical
phases. Failure to grasp this fact has
caused many men to develop along narrow-
technical lines and neglect much broader
and more remunerative opportunities on the
economic side of production problems.

TIME REQUIRED TO MAKE MAL-
LEABLE IRON REDUCED
Investigations have been carried on in
the metallurgical laboratory on the anneal-
ing of white cast iron during the past
semester and summer school. The work
is a continuance of the work carried on in
1917 by R. S. Archer under the supervision
of Prof. A. E. White.
The problem under investigation is the


171
determination of the time and temperature
relationship required to produce equilibrium
between the combined and graphitic carbon
in white cast iron. Samples of the white
cast iron were heat treated in an electric
muffle, and after heat treatment the sam-
ples were tested metallographically and
chemically, and accurate knowledge of the
conditions of the carbon was thus obtained.
The work has been in progress since
February, 1.920, and is still unfinished. The
interest in the annealing period of whit'?
cast iron was raised" through" the intfdUuc-
tion of the Dressier kiln to replace! the
present oven practice as a means of anneal-
ing in the malleable industry. The present
work, while of theoretical interest, wil| be
directly applicable to the kiln annealing
process. The time required to make Mal-
leable castings has been reduced from .sev-
eral days to a few hours by use of this kiln.

WILLIAM P. CAMPBELL, '22, Editor
AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT
The Technic wishes to take this oppor-
tunity to thank the Michigan Alumnus for
the kind assistance that it continually offers,
for it is confessedly through its columns
and the generosities of its office the major-
ity of our alumni news is obtainable. We
ate grateful to them.
Ralph M. Carson, 17L, after graduation
an instructor in English in the Engineering
College, sent the following letter to The
Michigan Alumnus. Mr. Carson is study-
ing at Oxford, England.
"Dear Sir: I shall write you just a note,
(1) to ask you to change my mailing ad-
dress for The Alumnus from Mr. Wylie'i
residence to Oriel College, where I can be
reached most easily; (2) to let The Alum-
nus know how I find Oxford.
"Both the countryside and the University
are beautiful, for, despite the time of the
year, the weather is mild and sunny to a
surprising degree. The lovely green of the
country, the clustered trees, the small, trim
fields and houses, and the college buildings
(close on the sidewalk as they usually are),
with the soft tones of their weathered walls
and their graceful pinnacles and spires,—
these make very pretty pictures, whether
one cycles to Abingdon or rides down the
winding High Street. But I understand
that the real beauty of England comes on
with the spring. Prices I find are high,
butter and sugar being still rationed, and
woolens being notably 'dear'; yet the level
is lower than in the United States, and
books are fairly cheap. There is much dis-
content, of course, with the faltering policy
of the Lloyd-George ministry; and there is
a great deal of puzzling over the 'why' of
America's recent tendency to withdraw
from the European entente. Inquiries about
America's attitude sometimes embarrass
me, since in too many cases I can't see any
good reason for it myself. But the British
arc good sports, and are willing to accept
the single word 'politics' as containing a
good deal of explanation. The undergrad-
uates, though reserved at first, are really
very companionable, so that by this time
I have received a good deal of countenance
at Oriel. They show a degree of education
and a level of interest (especially in poli-
tics) much above that of the American col-
lege man; this is plain from the style of
the student periodicals, and from scraps
of conversation that one overhears. The
intellectual banter that passes among them
is, to an American, almost ludicrous for its
very intellectuality."

E. Fred Wood d*ied suddenly Jan. 5, 1920,
at New York City. Mr. Wood was born
in Milwaukee, Wis., on Aug. 28, 1858. His
public school education was received in his
home town. He entered the University of
Michigan and specialized in metallurgy.
After graduation he obtained some prac-
tical experience in metallurgical operations
in the mines of I,eadville and other western
mining centers. He later entered the serv-
ice of the Carnegie Steel Company and was
soon promoted to the position of assistant
general superintendent of the plant at
Homestead. When Mr. Frick was shot,
during the strike of 1892, Mr. Wood had
entire charge of the plant. He was one of
the famous group of young men whom Mr.
Carnegie selected for the position of so-
called "Carnegie Veteran Association."
After the sale of the Carnegie interests
to the United States Steel Corporation in
1900, Mr. Wood became first vice-president
of the International Nickel Company, and
was an important factor in developing the
mining, smelting, and refining business of
the company from a small experimental
undertaking to the largest business of its
kind.
When the United States entered the
World War Mr. Wood severed his official
connection with the International Nickel
Company in order that he might devote
himself entirely to public work. He be-
came a member of the Committee on Pro-
duction of the War Industries Board, serv-
ing during the entire war without compen-
sation and in a manner that was conspicu-
ously fine and of inestimable value.
Mr. Wood had visited nearly every coun-
try of the world. He was a member of
numerous clubs of communal and national
note. He was married in 1882 and is sur~
vived by Mrs. Wood and a daughter, Mrs.
Hilda W. Allen, of New York City.

"My first job was
to build a shanty"
WHEN I got out of school," said the
old grad, "I went nround all primed
to discuss equilibrium of moments or to
lay out a high tension system between
New York and Chicago.
"But the first thing the boss set me at
was lo build a shanty. That had me
stumped. It ditln"t seem fair. I'd never
had n shiintv course at college.
"Sti.l I rolled mv sleeves up and started
in. At first the thing wouldn't 'jell at
all. The joints didn't stay put. The roof
sagged in the middle.
"But I went over my plans and rea-
soned out the why and wherefore of the
trouble on a common-sense basis. I
stayed with that job till 1 had it licked.
"Then I suddenly realized that the
biggest thing I had learned at college
was not the bits of specific information,
but something of much more importance
which these had taught me—the ability
to think."

problems. Visualize how those basic
laws can apply to other and vaster work.
Then you'll be ready for whatever new

DR. LYNN HAROLD HOUGH
President of Northwestern University during the year 1919-20
Julius Caesar was murdered in 44
B.C. If he had come back to this
world a thousand years later he would
have found much the same situation
as to the making and the transporting
of the articles which supply human
wants as when he died. If he had
waited about eight hundred years
more he would still have found the
familiar forge and flail, distaff and
hand loom of his own time. But if he
had made his journey a hundred years
later he would have found a world so
changed that he would have looked
about him with utter amazement.
Great machines would have been do-
ing the work he had seen accomplished
in such simple fashion. And over the
land trains moving at tremendous
speed upon steel rails would have fill-
ed him with fear, while steam driven
ships would have seemed to him to
turn the sea into a place of magic.
Let us run over a few of the names
which belong to the Hall of Fame of
this new age of machinery. In 1767
James Hargraves invented the spin-
ning jenny making it possible for one
spinner to do the work formerly done
by eight or ten. In 1768 Richard
Arkwright made a device for draw-
ing out thread by means of rollers.
In 1779 Samuel Crompton combined
the spinning jenny and the roller ma-
chine. And before the century came
to an end a machine had been invent-
ed which made it possible to spin two
hundred threads at once. In 1784 Dr.
Cartwright, a clergyman, invented a
new loom which automatically threw
the shuttle and shifted the weft. This
was just the beginning. Now one man
can do as much weaving in a day as
two hundred could accomplish with
the old hand loom. In 1792 Eli Whit-
ney invented the cotton gin which took
as many seeds out of cotton in a day
as a hundred and sixty hand work-
ers had been able to remove. In 1769
the blast furnace came into use. In
1856 the Bessemer process was in-
augurated. In 1769 James Watt had
made the steam engine a practical in-
vention. In 1785 the steam engine
was first applied to running machin-
ery. In 1790 steam power was first
applied to the blast. Robert Fulton's
steamboat proved a success in 1807.
In 1830 Stephenson's locomotive
"Rocket" stood a test successfully.
In 1838 the Great Western crossed
the Atlantic driven by steam alone.
The telegraph came in 1832. The tele-
phone in 1876. The. wireless arrived
in 1895. These and other inventions
have revolutionized the life of the
world.
In 1913 the machines of Great Brit-
ain produced seven billion yards of
cotton cloth. It has been estimated
that this would have made one hund-
red and seventy-five belts a yard wide
to go entirely around the earth. It
is stated that the commerce of the
United States and Great Britain in-
creased eight hundred per cent in the
half century from 1830 to 1880. Lon-
don which in the seventeenth century
had half a million inhabitants now has
a population of seven millions. At
the beginning of the nineteenth cen-
tury there were in Europe fourteen
cities of more than one hundred thous-
and inhabitants. Now there are one
hundred and forty such cities.
This new age of machinery is es-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
sentially a triumph of the brains of
man. Water travel began when men
used floating logs for purposes oi
transportation. Gradually they mov-
ed forward until the sailing ship was
developed. And at last within a hund-
red years came the ocean steamer.
From the floating log to the 40,000
ton steam liner is the distance the
mind of man has enabled humanity to
travel. It is true that once in posses-
sion of machinery men run the dang-
er of becoming the slaves of their own
inventions. As Emerson once said
bitterly things may get into the saddle
and ride mankind. But at all events
every step in the way of invention is
a step which is possible because of the
power of man's mind. And the age
of machinery is essentially a human
triumph.
We must frankly admit, however,
that the age of machinery is a period
of new and complicated problems.
It is a wonderful age for all the in-
ventors and for all the men who think
about material things and forces with
a creative mind. The man who in-
vents a new type of machine exercises
a high type of mental activity. But
the thousands of men who use the
machine may use almost no activity
of mind. They learn a few motions,
a few tricks of control, and the thing
is done. It is a fine thing to use a
typewriter. lis rather a bad thing
to become a typewriter. It is a good
thing to use a machine as a slave. It
is a bad thing for a human being to
turn into a machine. It seems clear
enough that one of the first neces-
sities if the race is to continue vigorous
of mind and quick in personal power,
is just the organization of life in such
a fashion that the men who operate
machines shall have hours which are
short enough, and wages large enough
to make possible the use of some time
each day in really productive mental
activity. We cannot deny that at first
many people were ground under the
wheels of the machinery. The tale of
the labor of women and children, in
England before the awakening of the
whole nation to the enormity of the
wr,ong which was done, is a bit of ter-
rible reading. The encouraging thing,
however, is that with every decade
the user of the machine has been given
a better chance at life and its larger
opportunities. The old wrongs have
not continued static. One by one
they have been righted. And just
here we come upon a very critical
question. As the hours of the worker
have become shorter and his wages
have increased has he used the extra
time which he has come to possess in
some sort of activity which has en-
riched and developed his mind and en-
larged the power of his personal life?
Books are within the range of the man
of moderate means as never before.
And the fashion in which the en-
franchised worker treats his oppor-
tunity to become a citizen of the ages
through familarity with great books
tells the story of the upbuilding or of
the disintegration of our national fib-
er. We are not underestimating the
problems which must yet be solved to
give the worker in the machine age his
due realm of life. But we are saying
that even more crucial is the matter of
his using every new hour of leisure
in a really productive way.
At first it seemed that when one
man could do the work of two hund-
red by means of a wonderful machine,
one hundred and niney-nine men
were left without work. As a matter
of fact with the coming of the ma-
chine age the wants and the tastes of
men so changed and developed that
doors of new opportunity kept open-
ing all the while. When we think of


181
all the men employed in some aspect
of automobile manufacture and
trade which had no existence a few
years ago, we see an illustration of
this development. It is still true, how-
ever, that a highly trained type of
organizing mind can produce a situa-
tion where much human hardship and
waste is avoided.
The city which has grown about
the factory has definite problems of
its own. And the story of the slums
in many cities, the situation in miser-
able and inadequate housing, the fac-
tory with almost no regard for sanit-
ation constitute an indictment of the
gravest character against those re-
sponsible for these conditions. Here
again it must be said that the indus-
trial nations have not supinely accept-
ed bad conditions. The decades im-
mediately behind us have seen a per-
petual procession of reforms and the
work is going on all the while. It
has become clear that even from the
standpoint of business efficiency the
human product of the machine age as
well as the articles which are being
manufactured must be considered.
Your efficiency expert must be an ex-
pert in conceiving human values as
well as in speeding up manufacturing
and sales activity. For at last all de-
mand goes back to a human type full
of health and growing activity and en-
larging life. Every manufacturing
plant creates goods and maintains a
group of people who consume goods.
And its production of consumers with
growing needs and growing ability to
pay for their supply as well as of
articles to be put upon the market is
a part of its contribution to prosper-
ity. All this is becoming increasing-
ly evident to thoughtful men and is
making the pathway of wise adjust-
ment easier.
It seems sufficiently clear that the
practical problems demand the high-
est type of organizing mind and the
most effectively trained expert in the
methods of efficiency. And from this
point of view it is curious enough
that the new world of which many
eager radicals are dreaming has no
place for the organizing mind which
is of such fundamental importance.
The workers of the world have
wrongs which must be righted. But
the word worker must be made large
enought to include the statesman of a
far flung organization and the master
of classifying materials and tasks and
matters of transportation if the work-
ers are not to be betrayed at the very
moment when they think they are
securing their rights. The innocent en-
thusiasm which imagines that a group
of untrained workers could take over
all the complicated relationships of a
big business in any possible system of
social relationships has simply failed
to face the facts. The only class con-
sciousness which promises well for
the future of the world is that which
puts every person whose work of
hand or mind or heart is really pro-
ductive into one great class. And the
organizing mind will have a notable
place in that class in any type of life
the age of machinery can utilize in
its successful functioning.
The exploiter of the employing
group who secures the most possible
labor for the least possible remunera-
tion without considering the human
values involved, and the exploiter of
the laboring group who gives the least
possible service for the largest possi-
ble remuneration, neglecting his work
whenever he can, are each of them
foes of humanity and therefore in the
long run of industrial and commercial
efficiency. In the intricate organiza-
tion which the machine age has pro-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
duced this is not always immediately
clear. But it is none the less de-
cisively true.
The immediate problem which we
now confront is a problem of speeding
up production all over the world.
Xo debates about the disposal of the
golden eggs amount to much if the
goose stops leaving these eggs in the
nest. Even problems of distribution
as acute as they are, are less funda-
mental than those of production. The
army of slaves which machinery puts
at our disposal really simplifies the
problem. These multitudinous ma-
chines which so implicitly do our bid-
ding spell a vastly increased oppor-
tunity for all the world. We are hitch-
ing the inanimate forces of the world
to all our burdens. But what they do
will depend upon the human spirit
which operates them. Their effective-
ness will depend upon the enthusiasm
with which men everywhere receive
and act upon the gospel of production.
And at last their capacity to continue
productive will depend upon a wise
and fruitful distribution which is per-
petually building up the human fiber
of the world. The age of machinery
requires a more highly developed type
of organizing mind than the world
has ever known before. And in its
own way it is all the while teaching us
that in the last analysis efficiency de-
pends upon justice and brotherhood.


CASSIUS M. DAVIS, '08
Railway and Traction Engineering Department of the General Electric Co.
Nearly everyone is familiar with the status of our electric railways.
A few roads are paying small dividends, some have abandoned miles of
track, many have been forced into the hands of receivers, and all are strug-
gling to justify their existence.
They have come into this sad plight partly through the advent of the
automobile, partly through shortsightedness and inefficient management,
partly through the inability of the general public to grasp the broad idea of
the Golden Rule, but chiefly through the rapid increase in the cost of labor
and materials.
The railways were slow to appreciate the situation until they awoke
to find themselves on the verge of bankruptcy. It was as if a plague had
overspread the land, striking down indiscriminately the rich and the poov...
the respected and the despised. It was soon evident the old family doctor,
Retrenchment, could not cope with the disease and a specialist must be
called in.
Fortunately, not one, but several specialists were soon available, each
one prepared to relieve a portion of the suffering and all cooperating in an
endeavor to effect a cure. Some of the more important are the lighter
weight cars, the one-man car, more efficient utilization of equipment and
plant, and the automatic substation. These specialists treat more or less
specific phases of the malady, but all produce results in harmony with gen-
eral recovery.
The rate of recovery from all deep-seated troubles is slow. So it is
with the electric railways. -Many have apparently passed the crisis, others
are ''very low," and others doubtless will not have the vitality to carry them
through.
It will be the purpose of this article to outline some of the more import-
ant factors (and, possibly, to suggest others) which influence the applica-
tions of automatic substations to electric railways. No conclusions will be
drawn and no plea made for the wholesale adoption of automatic control
for all electric lines. Like every device requiring the expenditure of capital,
it must be applied with judgment and its worth assured. Undoubtedly it
has a large field of application which experience of the past six years has
only just scratched. Also, undoubtedly, there are many cases where it can-
not be adequately justified. Kach case must be considered on its own merits.
The most rapid decline in the earning power of the railways was due
to the unprecedented rise in cost of material and labor. Therefore, any
means whereby the amount of either or both of these items could be cur-
tailed offered the greatest hope of relief. Unfortunately, material and
labor are more or less inter-dependent, at least to the extent that wherever
labor is dispensed with a certain amount of material must be substituted.
The automatic substation is an illustration. The operator in a railway
substation can be eliminated if some electro-mechanical means can be


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
found for doing his work. His duties are simple: Starting and stopping
machines, closing breakers after overloads, keeping the log and taking care
of routine maintenance. All these duties except the last one can be done
without human aid, but a certain amount of material must be substituted.
The material substituted means increased capital outlay with its at-
tendent annual expense, and therefore economics enter.
Mr. B. J. Arnold of Chicago seems to be the first one on record who
seriously considered the practical applications of automatic substations to
electric railways. Jn 1914 he proposed a trial installation and the manufac-
Automatic Substation Equipment Installed on Grand Rapids, Grand Haven, and
Muskegon Railway
turers built an experimental equipment which was installed in the Union
Station of the Elgin &amp; ltelvidere Electric Co. The trial was entirely suc-
cessful and today there are over one hundred railway automatic substa-
tions in successful operation.
Xo attempt will be made here to describe the detailed operation of an
automatic substation. It would be tedious reading and soon out of date.*
However, a general statement of operation is needed to make this article
* Those interested will find detailed description in the following articles: Allen
&amp; Taylor, Trans. A. I. F. E. IQ15, p. 1801; Davis G. E. Review, Aoril IQ20, p. 342.
An interesting account of the Chicago, North Shore and Milwaukee Ry. appears in an
article by Jones in Klectric Railway, Jan. II, 1910. p. 84.

complete. The controlling equipment consists of an assemblage of con-
tractors, relays, resistors and auxiliary equipment, so connected to the sub-
station converting apparatus that a demand for power starts up the unit or
units in the substation and a cessation of power demand shuts down the
respective unit or units. The demand for power is indicated by the lower-
ing of the trolley or third rail voltage at the substation. The cessation of
power is indicated by the lowering of the current output from the substation.
While the substation is in operation the equipment is provided with every
kind of protection to insure safe and uninterrupted service. Overloads due
to congested traffic are limited by series resistances in the machine and feed-
er circuits. Over heating is prevented by thermostats: short-circuits, over-
and under-speed, under-voltage, single phase, reversed potential, by suit-
able relays, centrifugal devices, current trips, etc., etc. In short, the entire
substation is so equipped that the door may be locked for days at a time
and yet the appartus will perform just as though an experienced operator
were on hand. There are cases on record where absolutely no attention was
paid certain substations for several weeks.
The automatic substation was developed primarily as a labor saving
device. Incidentally it makes possible certain other savings, both tangible
and intangible, which will be referred to later on.
A labor saving device must first justify itself from an investment point
of view. In the face of the present financial status of our railways, it must
justify itself by a very wide margin. Money is too hard to get for public
utility investment to take chances on a 10% or 15% return. The investment
must warrant a 20% or 25% return. Some properties require more or less.
Hence the installation of an automatic equipment should pay for itself in
about five years. This is purely on a dollars and cents basis. There are
often other considerations which dictate the rate of return demanded on
an investment.
The reduction of expense for substation labor-brings up some inter-
esting academic problems, which are worth while considering. One of
these problems deals with substation location.
On purely theoretical grounds, the best disposition of substations along
an interurban road, or about a city is that which costs the least to install and
the minimum to operate. As the number of substations for a given system
is increased the greater the capital required in land, buildings, machinery,
and frequently high tension transmission lines, but the less required in D. C.
feeder. Correspondingly, the fixed charges, labor, maintenance and miscel-
laneous expense on substations increases with their decreases. Theoretical-
ly, then, it is possible to find the point of minimum investment. This point
is where the addition of one more substation would just offset the reduction
in feeder copper. In a like manner the point of minimum operating expense
can be found where the addition of one more substation would increase the
substation operating expense by more than the decrease in fixed charges
on the feeder investment. The number of substations required to give a
minimum capital cost may or may not agree with the number to give mini-
mum operating expense.
Practically, it is impossible to realize the conditions indicated by theory.


THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C
There are several contributory causes. Local conditions are almost never
ideal. Land may not be available where desired. Local ordinances may not
permit reaching the desired spot with suitable a. c. high tension, or, in the
case of cities, they may not permit substations of any description in the
desired locality, even if land could be secured. Then there are certain items
of investment to which definite values of interest and depreciation cannot
be assigned. Feeder copper, for instance, has an indefinitely long life and
ten thousand dollars invested in feeders is much more secure than the same
amount invested in building and machinery. It would be poor judgment to
increase the number of substations to the theoretical limit mentioned in the
A Portat-ik Automatic Railway Substation, Di.s Mcines City Railway Co.
preceding paragraph. In fact the conservative engineer would stop where
the value of feeder copper saved would be somewhat greater than the cost
of the additional substation, not just equal it.
Returning to the theoretical discussion, it is evident the reduction of
the labor item by the use of automatic substations permits the finding of a new
minimum of operating expense. This point will correspond to a closer spac-
ing of substations and less feeder copper. How much this minimum will be
shifted depends, of course, on the price paid for labor and the replacing
apparatus. The proportion of labor to other operating expense is a large
factor. The labor in a manually operated 500 K. W. interurban substation
may be 20% of the total operating expense, including power, while in a
3000 K. W. city substation the labor may not be more than 5%. Assuming
both the urban and interurban substations to be most economically located


for manual control, and further assuming all labor eliminated, it will be
evident the spacing of the interurban substations may be changed quite a
little while the city substations would change hardly at all.
It might be said in passing, the automatic substation does not eliminate
all labor because the equipment must be frequently inspected. One man can
usually look after three or four substations.
The rapid increase in the cost of labor and materials in the last few
years has had as marked an effect on substation operation as on the rest of
the system. Take an interurban substation of 500 K. W. capacity installed
fifteen years ago, the operating figures might have looked something like
this:
Original cost at $40 per K. W., $20000.
Fixed charges at 12% :$ 2400
Two operators, each at $75 1800
Maintenance and supplies at 1.5% 300
A. C. power at .8c (975000 K. W. H.) 7800
Total, $12300
At the present time, due to increases in everything, the corresponding items
might be:
Fixed charges at 15 % $ 3000
Three operators, each at $150 5400
Maintenance and supplies at 2% 400
A. C. power at 1.2c (975000 K. W. H.) 11700
Total $20500
The substation expense, in the case assumed, has increased about 60%.
In other words it costs over one and a half times as much now to furnish
just the propelling power to the cars.
If automatic control were applied to the above substation, the invested
capital would be increased by $7500. The operating costs would run about
as follows:
Fixed charges at 15% $ 4125
Labor for inspection 400
Maintenance and supplies at 2% 550
A. C. power at 1.2c (965000 K. W. H.) 11580
Total $16655
This represents a saving of about $3900 per year. The equipment
would thus pay for itself in about two years.
Of course, the above are not actual figures on any road, but are pro-
duced here to show the magnitudes of the quantities involved. They are
probably not far wrong for many interurban lines handling relatively light
traffic. Citv substations would vield entirely different amounts, but the


net increase will be about tbe same. The increase in labor would represent
a much smaller relative amount, while the increased cost of power would
be a big item. As an example we might take a 3000 K. W. substation cost-
ing $20 per K. \Y. or $60000, in 1905.
Fixed charges at 12% $ 7200
Four operators, each at $75 3600
Maintenance and supplies at 1.5% '575
A. C. power at .8c (15,000,000 K. W. II.) 120000
Total $132375
Today the costs might run:
Fixed charges at 15% $ 9000
Six operators, each at $150 10800
Maintenance and supplies at 2°/o 2100
A. C. power at 1.2c (15,000,000 K. W. II.) 180000*
Total $201700
The total increase in this case is about 50%.
It will be seen the largest item of expense in both classes of substations
is power. Unfortunately a motor car takes as much power where supplied
by an automatic substation as by a manual. The automatic equipment does
make it possible, however, to realize some saving in A. C. power for the
reason that, operating on power demand, it keeps the converting apparatus
shut down when power is not required. There is no useless churning of the
air and heating by core loss. Conversion losses at light, inefficient loads
and no load are saved. The amount of power thus conserved depends
entirely on traffic conditions, the largest quantities coinciding with least
frequent service. On interurban roads the aggregate time shut down varies
all the way from nothing to 50% of the operating day, that is from zero to
nine hours in an 18 hour day. In city service some substations may be run-
ning practically continuously 24 hours while others may operate only a
few hours in the morning and a few hours again in the evening. In sub-
stations of more than one unit, some A. C. power is saved because additional
units are cut in and out only when needed, whereas in manually operated
substations the power conditions are always liberally anticipated. Auto-
matic operation also tends to raise the conversion efficiency since the
machines when running, carry loads more nearly equal to their rated
capacities where the efficiency is best.
An advantage of automatic control which is important, and the value
of which is difficult to capitalize, appears in the mitigation of electrolysis.
The desirability of subdividing sources of power has long been appreciated,
* The cost of power is based on the assumption that the roads generate their own
energy and that the increase in the cost of power has heen due to increase in the cost
of power station labor and coal. The cost of energy generated by large stations, kept
up-to-date, has not increased appieciably.

but the high cost of operating a multiplicity of substations has been the
deterring element. A means is now available which makes such operation
more feasible.
Automatic control has been seldom applied to multiple unit substations.
The obvious reason is it takes no more labor to run a four unit station than
a single unit. 'The greater number of automatic units in one substation the
less the return on the investment. Consequently, in most city systems it
would not pay to convert existing substations.
Past practice on city roads has been the result of gradual growth.
Many systems, excluding, of course, the largest, began with three, two or
even cne substation—in some cases the "substation" was a d. c. power plant
Automatic Railway Substation—Cincinnati, I.awkenceburg and Aurora Electric
Street Raiiavay
—and as the traffic increased, additional units were added and more feeder
copper installed. This resulted in a tremendous investment in copper. Such
a method of providing for increased traffic was natural and logical because
it was the most economical way of following a slow growth. However, it
is not logical to carry the method too far. After a time it pays to convert
much of the copper value into substations.
It is here the automatic substation shows its worth in city service, since
it offers a more economical scheme of operation than manual control. The
total capacity can be split up into a number of substations of moderate size,
the labor for operating decreased and the excess feeder salvaged to defray
the expense. The result will be a more efficient system with better average
trolley voltage and correspondingly improved schedules. It has been found


the total system power demand may be reduced by furnishing power from
several small capacity substations properly distributed instead of a single
large substation. It has also been possible on some systems to assign a de-
finite value to the reduction of total system operating expenses for each
volt increase in average trolley voltage.
The application of automatic control to interurban lines differs some-
what. In the first place the growth of traffic has not been so rapid and the
original arrangement of substations and feeders has been adequate. In the
second place many interurban lines permit of a large increase of traffic (by
reduction of headway) without a noticeable reduction in average trolley
voltage or a serious increase in peak demands on the substation. Con-
sequently, it is often economically, possible to convert existing substations
to automatic control. The machines are usually of moderate capacity and
operate either singly or two in parallel. It is not economical, however, to
convert existing substations on roads carrying such heavy traffic that several
units per substation are required and where a correspondingly large amount
of feeder is installed. In such cases the economical arrangement under auto-
matic control dictates a subdivision of converting units and a reduction of
feeder copper.
From the foregoing discusison it will be seen the use of automatic
control for substations may allow a re-adjustment of the distribution sys-
tems of both city and interurban roads which permits of better operating
economies. It is encouraging to report many railways have been quick to
appreciate the advantages such control offers and they are finding it possible
to make the conversion in spite of the difficulty of securing capital.
THE ENGINEER
There stands a bridge, a monument of strength
Strong, unadorned, thru all its flawless length,
Like some huge giant spanning alien lands,
Yet think—all this was made by human hands.
Builders and workers, myriad as ants
Sweating and toiling, helped the slow advance.
But do these men create the thing they build?—
Ah, they but labor as some mind has willed,
Some brain, the cans? of all the perfect whole.
Service his aim, accomplishment his goal.

We seek at last the master mind, the king in his own sphere,
The man who does things, and we find—the fighting engineer.

CHARLES S. KINNISON
Advertising Manager of Hoskins Mfg. Co.
Why are you taking an engineering
course? Js it because that you feel
you are either mechanically or analy-
tically inclined? Perhaps you know
of several young men who made good
in an engineering line, and that was
the impelling force that made you
think you'd like to be an engineer, too.
But probably the principal reason was
that a technical training gives a man
specialized knowledge that he can
commercialize almost immediately
after his graduation. It means that
your field of endeavor is established,
and that you won't waste your time
feeling your way along, trying to de-
cide just what line of work you shall
follow. Many engineering graduates
find that they have acquired the wrong
kind of information for their partic-
ular ability, after they've gotten out
of school, but when they first enter-
ed the engineering college, they had
their minds made up on the line of
work they thought they wanted to
follow.
The man who studies mechanical
engineering, for example, does so be-
cause he thinks he'd be a good me-
chanical engineer, and he expects to
use his training in the enginering de-
partment of an automobile company,
perhaps. He doesn't intend to furrow
his brow over the intricacies of differ-
ential equations, mechanics, hydraulics,
etc., and then go out and make his liv-
ing selling real estate.
It is no reflection on the engineer-
ing profession to say that a man is
not necessarily an engineer just be-
cause his diploma says he is. The
diploma merely indicates that his
academic standing was sufficiently
high to allow him to graduate, and be
given a degree. He may, however,
be A-1 on theory and Z-oy on its prac-
tical application, and he may not dis-
cover that Z-99 part of his character-
istics until he is out on his first real
job. This doesn't mean that his ment-
al equipment is not of a high order
or that he lacks capability, lie may
have a $20,000 mind as a patent at-
torney, and yet not be worth twenty
dollars a week as an engineer. And
he'd probably be a very mediocre
patent attorney, without his engineer-
ing training.
It is not always true that a man
has to wait until he's out of school to
find that he has picked the wrong line.
He may realize it when he's a junior
or a senior. This consciousness
doesn't necessarily come to him, only
when he is "falling down" in his work.
He may even be meriting half his
classes, and yet sense that he's just
a little bit out of the sphere in which
he belongs. If he's a junior, say, when
this consciousness comes to him, he's
apt to feel very much discouraged,
because of his three years' investment-
in time and money. In reality, how-
ever, he should not feel that way. It's
natural that he should be disappoint-
ed, but he should not for one minute
feel that he's a failure. If a man
holds his morals high, and keeps his
health, an engineering training cannot
be wasted. It's bound to be an asset.
It can't be otherwise. His mind has
been trained to be analytical, and a
mind that reasons things out. g~ts
down to rock-bottom and takes noth-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ing for granted, except its religion, is
sure to be useful, and its owner suc-
cessful.
What does all this have to do with
the subject of these remarks, "The
Advertising Engineer"?
There's an unhlled demand for the
technical man who can apply his
training toward advertising and sales
work, particularly the former. The
industries pay good salaries to the
engineer who has the sales instinct,
the specialized knowledge, and the
ability to write. I le is said to be,
and seems to be, a rara avis. The
average engineering student looks on
his English courses like a small boy
does his bath. It's an event that hap-
pens once or twice a week, an event
that is endured because of sheer nec-
essity. The engineer can't see how
the ability to write and to use good
English is particularly an asset to him.
It might be good stuff for literary
guys, but not for the hard-boiled eng-
ineers, they think. It's because of
this attitude, that there is a scarcity
of technical men who can write.
Why engineering students should
hold this viewpoint is difficult to un-
derstand. Why wouldn't a man with
electrical training be just as willing
to apply his specialized knowledge to
the publicity problems of a motor
manufacturer, as to the engineering
side of the business?
There certainly is nothing disagree-
able about technical advertising, and
furthermore, it is a field offering far
less competition than the one of man-
ufacturing or of applied engineering.
It also affords a man a wider field
of activity, giving him the opportun-
ity to develop his business intellect,
and to become an income producer
for his employer—a tangible producer
of revenue. The man who can point
definitely to the dollars and cents that
he has produced for his company,
points definitely to the factor that
fixes his own income. It's not so easy
for the man in the engineering depart-
ment to do this, valuable though he
may be. simply because he can't point
definitely to the monetary income he
has produced, even though his brain
may have saved his company thous-
ands of dollars.
So, if you happen to be an engineer
who doubts his fitness for the prac-
tical side of his profession, don't quit
the course, unless you're sure that all
phases of it are distasteful to you.
Develop an ability to write and then
cultivate it. You may not use that
ability in advertising alone; it's just
as useful in technical journalism, but
possibly does not bring the same
financial returns.
It is not to be assumed that an eng-
ineer with writing ability is immed-
iately qualified to handle the adver-
tising of a technical product. He
must obviously know something about
the manufacturing end of that busi-
ness, and most important of all. he
should have had some selling exper-
ience, preferably in connection with
the product he is to advertise. He
need not qualify as a first-class sales-
man. The important thing is to know
something of the attitude of his par-
ticular buying public, and to learn
what constitutes the best sales appeal
by actually making some sales. In
acquiring this experience, the engineer
may discover that he is a real honest-
to-goodness salesman. If he makes
this discovery, he can forget all about
advertising, if he cares to. It means
that he has found his green pasture.
And that's what we're all seeking.


DEAN M. E. COOLEY
It has occurred to me that I could
do no better in these words to you
than to try to answer a question which
each and every one of you has asked
himself, or should ask himself: "How
best can I succeed in my chosen field
of work? What should I do to make
of myself the greatest success?" It is
not an easy question to answer, for,
like many an algebraic problem, the
unknown quantities are greater in
number than the equation embracing
them. Moreover, it is difficult for a
young man to see himself as others see
him. It would be fortunate indeed if
the young man could write down on
paper the several equations of himself
so that he could study them deliber-
ately and then apply the principles of
mathematics to their solution. The
problem would be found to embrace
such elem:nts as inertia, velocity, ac-
celeration, momentum, vis viva, and
maxima and minima. Indeed a knowl-
edge of your limitations are of the
first importance. The while problem
may be stated in two words: Know
thyself.
The first and most important ques-
tion to ask one's self is what did God
intend I should do in the world's
work? Many, if not most failures
can be charged up to not having learn-
ed the answer to that question. If on
a close analysis of yourself the answer
points to something different from
what you had planned to do, do not
hesitate to change, and to change at
once. For be assured that if you do
the work you were intended for you
will make a success of it, and nothing
can prevent it.
It will require courage in many in-
stances to accept the result of such an
analysis of one's self, but remember
the physics of the problem, and that as
naturally as water runs down hill, and
requires power to force it up hill, so
with you in your work—if selected
with regard to your fitness, success
will flow readily, and if not, power
will be continually required to bring
about success.
A young man was graduated from
this University in engineering in
1905. He came here off a farm and
helped himself through college by
work. He applied himself faithfully
to his chosen profession for nearly
five years, and was fairly successful.
He paid back the money he had bor-
rowed while in college, helped bear
some of the expenses at his old home,
and save the rest of his money. He
has now gone back to the farm in the
belief that for a man of his temper-
ament a greater measure of success
could there be obtained than in eng-
ineering. I know that young man in-
timately and am sure he has made no
mistake. He probably would never
have been more than just a good aver-
age engineer, but he will make a suc-
cess as a farmer. His education has
not been wasted. It will be a great
comfort to him in the years to come;
and even if it has done no more for
him than to enable him to settle the
one great question, it was amply just-
ified.
It is important to know just what
constitutes success. Do not make the
very common mistake of measuring
success by the amount of money you
can earn. One must have money and
enough to live on, but it is not the all
important thing at the beginning of
life. It becomes really important only


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
when one's working days are drawing
to a close, and enough must be had to
bridge over the shoals to the deep
water where the ferryman waits for
the final passage.
In one sense success is the realiza-
tion of one's ambition. It is the
achievement of the result of one's
plans and labor. It is the bringing
about of the end sought to be accom-
plished. We are sometimes confused,
I think, by the surgeon who says the
operation was successful, notwith-
standing the patient died. In the arts
we may have its parallel in the case
of a machine which produces the re-
sult intended, but fails because there
is not enough demand for the pro-
duct, or because of insufficient raw
material to work upon.
Professor John E. Sweet, the fath-
er of the Straight-Line Engine, used
to tell the story of the man who de-
signed and built a most perfect ma-
chine for manufacturing pins. It was
a wide step in advance of the art. A
large factory was .built in Syracuse,
and when completed the proprietors
went into the market for pin wire.
The price quoted was so high as to
lead to the remark that at such a price
the wire cost as much as the finished
pins. "Oh," said the wire merchants,
"if you would like to have the wire
run through the pin machines and
made into pins, it can be done at the
same price." There was a case of a
success which, owing to other circum-
stances, resulted in failure.
Failure itself is often success. Such
a case is found in the problem which
one has attempted to solve expecting
a certain result, and in the solution
it is completely demonstrated that no
such result was possible. It may be
quite as much of a success to prove a
thine can not be done at all, and it
may be more of a success, than to
achieve a partial result which leads on
to the expenditure of more time and
money with the final result failure
after all.
In measuring success in life I would
like to start with citizenship. Let
everyone, first of all, be a good citizen,
one who commands the respect of his
neighbors, one who has ideals and is
successful in inspiring them in others,
so that the community and the home
are all better for those ideals. A
man who conducts himself so as to
maintain his self-respect is a great
success. A man who lives his life
within his income and meets his obli-
gations is a success. The man who by
his example creates in his neighbor a
desire to emulate him is a success. A
man who never shirks responsibility,
and takes upon himself duties to be
performed and does his best in per-
forming them is a success. In none of
these things need money be consider-
ed, except sufficient to live on and do
the things which come to hand.
I do not mean in my definition of
success to omit the truly great things,
but everyone knows of them, and they
need not be mentioned. I want you,
young man, to go out into the world
prepared to credit yourself with being
successful even if you do not ac-
complish something which the world
would call truly great.
One of my old friends wrote me
the other dav a most interesting letter
concerning himself. After graduating
from the Arts Department here at
Michigan, he attended an eastern eng-
ineering school.
He had often wondered why he
did not get along better in the world.
The lesson is so valuable and so pert-
inent to the spirit of my remarks,
however, that I have taken the liberty
of quoting parts of his letter. Under-
stand it is from a man now nearly or


J95
quite fifty years old. This is his let-
ter:
'It has just entered my head, that
many engineering graduates might be
the better for a little bit of advice, or
perhaps, warning, in regard to the
necessity of discriminating between
knowing how work should be done,
and knowing hozv to get it done. I
have suffered all my life from know-
ing how things should be done, and
leaving them for some other fellow
to finish; and it is only within the
last year that I have had my eyes
fully opened to the folly of such a
plan of action. The extra work of
completing the job is nothing to the
man who has done the preliminary
work and laid out the completion of
it. But the man who actually gets it
done and sees that it is finished, who
has to go over th° other man's prelim-
inary work and become familiar with
the plan for its completion, before he
starts, is the one who gets all the cred-
it, and moreover he lias a right to it.
He is the man who gets the money
anyhow.
"I never discovered this little secret
until I struck the sales end of the
engineering business, and found that
unless I carried my work clear
throueh to where I could say, "Here!
Make this, as shown and specified.
Deliver here on such a date, for such
a price, to b" paid on such a date.' the
work was not complete and I could
claim no credit for it, unless, of
course, conditions were such that it
was a nhvsical impossibilitv for me
to got a11 the data mvself and attend to
the wind-no before it was turned over
to the production end.
"The man who took the trouble to
teach me this, is fifteen years younger
than mvself and never saw the in-
side of a technical school. He got his
engineering in the shop, and at sea,
and was absorbing business principles
all the time. Eight years ago he was
working under me at the 'Brown-
Hoist' in Cleveland, and when I went
to work for him a year ago, I found
he had been analyzing my character
while working for me, and had his
whole plan prepared for reconstruct-
ing the inside of my head, and he has
done it. I have for some time been
puzzled to know just what it was that
I had learned that made me succeed
as I had never done before, and have
concluded that it is simply this: 'Carry
whatever you do to a conclusion, to a
point where you can turn over some-
thing concrete, so that all that remains
is simply an order or a set of direc-
tions, the origin of which need not
be investigated, and in which there is
nothing to be checked. In other words,
to do the work so that you can tell
the next man just what he is to do,
and so that he can hold you responsi-
ble for what has been done up to the
time he receives the order.
"I suppose to many, even very
young engineers, these are self-evid-
ent truths, and to them it might
seem childish to put such things into
words, but from my own unpleasant
experience, I suspect that the major-
ity of young men are not alive to the
matter, and that many do not get wise
till quite late in life, like myself, and
some (a good many) never learn it."
That man has a son coming to
Michigan next year. He is interested
in you who are just entering life's
race. There is one rule I have always
tried to follow. It may not add much
to one's success as measured by
money, but it has at least afforded a
great amount of personal satisfaction.
Often when an engineer is called upon
in a consulting capacity, he is asked to
produce a particular result, and not
infrequently is told that no other re-


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
suit is needed or desired. This, I have
as a rule declined to do, and when
urged to hurry my report have said,
"I can not give you my report until it
is finished. While you may be satis-
fied with the work already done, I am
not. When I am satisfied you also
will be satisfied." Work should al-
ways be carried on to a point which
will enable the engineer to advise in
light of the things developed during
the investigation. That is particular-
ly true of a new project. If reported
on after only a partial investigation,
work might have been commenced and
money expended along lines found,
after a complete investigation, to be
entirely wrong.
It is an engineer's duty to work out
problems for his employer which will
show conclusively all that can be
known for and against a project.
Moreover, it is a duty one owes him-
self for one's reputation should not
be jeopardized. A reputation is an
engineer's capital. Properly treated
it will bear a good return, but ill
treatment will not only diminish the
return but ultimately destroy the prin-
cipal. Young men, you must cherish
your reputation above all things if
you are to continue in the practice of
engineering.
A young engineer once handed me
a letter in which he was offered a
contract in a certain way, and asked,
"What would you do about it?" I
replied, "Young man, if you expect
to continue in engineering work only
one course is possible; if you plan to
go into other work two courses are
possible." He smiled—and is still
engaged in engineering work and very
successfully. Once an engineer has
been purchased, it speedily becomes
known among salesmen, and sooner
or later among the engineer's em-
ployers, and that is the beginning of
the end, if not the end itself.
And now a final word. Be true to
your employer. You may not agree
with him or with his policies. You
may dislike him, but as long as you
work for him and receive his pay, be
true to him. Such conduct will win
for you your employer's respect, and
he will aid you when you go from his
service. Always give your employer
ample notice of your intention to
leave, give him the true reasons if
asked them. Make a sacrifice if nec-
essary to prevent any embarrassment
which might result from your leaving.
These are little things, but they win.
Be content with moderate or even
small pay if there is a future in sight.
Oftentimes the small beginning makes
the most satisfactory ending. It is
better to start at $75 or $80 a month
and advance steadily upward with no
limit in sight than to start at $100 or
$125 with a known limit of advance-
ment ahead of you. Put by a part
of your earnings, 10% at least. Put
it in a separate bank and do not touch
it until you have to. If your pay is
$50, put by five of it and if $100, put
by ten. When the accumulation
makes $500, take it out of the savings
bank and buy a good bond. In a short
time you will have two or three bonds.
Then when you want to raise money,
to go into business it may be, you can
offer your bonds as collateral and get
the money without asking anyone to
go on your note with you. It gives
a fine feeling of independence and en-
hances one's manhood.
Probably no better example of the
qualities which make for success can
be found anywhere than in that little
story entitled, "Carrying a Message
to Garcia." When asked if you can
do a certain thing, let your answer
be "Aye, Aye, Sir," then go about it


197
and do it. If in the attempt you find
yourself in a hole, climb out. If
you can't climb out, then die in the at-
tempt. Don't be a coward, be cour-
ageous and brave and always in a
manly way. Let me give you, in clos-
ing, the lines of John Trotwood
Moore entitled:
SUCCESS
'Tis the coward who quits to misfor-
tune,
'Tis the knave who changes each
day,
'Tis the fool who wins half the battle,
Then throws all his chances away.
•
There is little in life but labor,
And tomorrow may find that a
dream;
Success is the bride of Endeavor,
And luck—but a meteor's gleam.
The time to succeed is when others,
Discouraged, show tracs of tire;
The battle is fought in the home-
stretch—
And won—'tw.ixt the flag and the
wire.


NAN AND SHANTUNG PROVINCES,
CHINA
PROF. H. BRODIE, C.E.
On January 20, 1919, Mr. Joseph
Riplej, Chief Engineer of the Grand
Canal Improvement Board, accom-
panied by Mr. J. VV. Beardsley, As-
sistant Chief, and Messrs. Ralph
Goodrich and R. II. Merrill, engin-
eers, arrived on the banks of the Yel-
low River at Yu Shan where, accord-
ing to previous arrangements, engin-
eers Brodie, Carey and Merrick
awaited them. The three last named
were in charge of parties surveying
the Grand Canal in this section.
The purpose of this meeting was to
enable all the American engineers to
have the opportunity of seeing this
important section of the canal as well
as to join in a conference of all the
foreign engineers on the Grand Canal
Improvement Board on the important
problems before the Board. From
January 20th to the 25th the party
covered both branches of the canal
on both sides of the river and all oth-
er points along the river that might
be made use of in the new crossing
proposed.
At these conferences the water sup-
ply for that branch of the canal lying
north of the Yellow River and the
possibility of floods from the Yellow
River destroying any improvements
made along this section of the canal
were discussed as well as the pro-
blem of the canal crossing itself.
It was agreed that much more in-
formation was desired concerning the
territory to the west of the canal as
well as the dike systems along the
river. Three sources of water supply
seemed possible: First, from the
streams from the Shantung hills to
the south; second, from the Yellow
River; and, third, from the Wei River
to the northwest. Each presented
difficulties as well as advantages.
The urgent calls for reports seem-
ed to warrant our discontinuing our
survey to the south over territory
which had previously been covered
by a series of disconnected surveys
conducted by Chinese engineers, and
directing our attention to these other
problems that had not been consider-
ed by the Chinese engineers. These
matters were taken under considera-
tion by the chief, and the engineers in
charge of the field work returned to
their parties and continued the sur-
vey of the canal some six miles south
of the Yellow River. Mr. Goodrich
continued his investigations in hydro-
graphic work in this section and the
chief and the remainder of the party
returned to headquarters.
About the first of February the
writer received instructions to pre-
pare to make the shorter reconnais-
sance run discussed at our confer-
ence. On February 10th we complet-
ed the topographic survey along the
canal at An Shan, some eight miles
south of the Yellow river, and accom-
panied by the two best parties re-
turned to Acheng, a small city on the
canal some ten miles north of the Yel-
low River.
The survey as authorized by the
chief was to be made by two parties
of Chinese engineers; one with trans-


199
it stadia, and one with level for a
check on elevations. Only side shots
of importance were to be made and
the location of drainage channels, old
river beds and such other natural fea-
tures that might be of service in in-
terpreting the nature of the country
were to be taken or noted.
As outlined by the chief, this line
ran in a northwesterly direction from
Acheng through Shen Hsien to the
Wei River near Ta-ming-fu, then re-
turning to Shen Hsien, it continued
south through Kwen-cheng across the
Yellow River through Yun-cheng,
Ku-ye to Kin-sing, near the
south border of Shantung Province,
thence northeasterly to Tsining on the
Grand Canal, a total distance of 162
miles. This trip was completed in
17 working days, and as one day was
consumed in moving from the Wei
River back to Shen Hsien, an average
of a little better than 10 miles a day
was made.
On the run from Acheng to the Wei
River three old beds of the Yellow
River were crossed, all extending to
the northeast and indicating that the
Yellow River had at some time in the
past occupied the bed of the Wei.
A wide sandy depression now marks
these old beds while a slight ridge
on either side marks the lines of the
old dikes. All is now under cultiva-
tion except where the old bed is too
sandy and this is covered with drift-
ing dunes some ten to fifteen feet in
height.
That part of the line between Ach-
eng and Ta-ming-fu passes through
a fairly fertile tract that is densely
populated. Two crops a year are
grown through the greater part of
this section. Wheat in the winter and
beans, millet, kaolyiang and peanuts
in the summer. Large orchards of
Chinese dates, cultivated haws, and
persimmons were found all along this
line.
On the run south from Shen Hsieu
the party soon got into the more
sandy flood plains and less densely
populated sections. The land for
many miles on both sides of the Yellow
River was rather radly cut up by the
floods that had recently passed
through. It was found that the less
fertile tract extended well down to
the neighborhood of Ku-yeh and the
signs of the floods as far as Kin-
siang.
Nearly all of this section, particu-
larly the poorer section, lies in what is
known as the principal bandit region
of Shantung Province and the party
was loath to push on into this section.
It was difficult to understand why the
parties were not making better time
at the beginning until, by careful in-
quiry, it was found that they were
afraid. After considerable persuasion
and argument the engineer in charge
convinced them that safety lay in
speed and from then on there was no
need of urging the men to hurry, but
it became necessary to urge care and
restraint lest they make errors in their
haste. The entire party would hurry
from one large city or village to an-
other much like a bunch of scared rab-
bits scurrying from one cover to an-
other. Several villages were passed
that had recently been plundered and
one group of blackened mud walls
gave evidence of the wrath of the
bandit when unsuccessfully resisted. /
On arriving at the branch office at
Tsining the party was set at work
platting the notes of the reconnais-
sance and overhauling and repairing
the equipment. The information gain-
ed on this trip brought out more clear-
ly the need of the longer reconnais-
sance along the Yellow River out to
the west of the canal, and on April


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
12th we received orders from our
chief to prepare for this trip.
The general instructions were to
make a survey of all dikes along the
river noting their conditions, particu-
larly any weak, points and frequently
taking cross sections; to cover the
lands on either side of these dikes by
stadia, to obtain where possible all in-
formation regarding the position of
the stream, its banks, and the elevation
of the water surface; to take fre-
vey coolies hired and a military guard
of about 90 men detailed for the trip.
All provisions and equipment were
carefully packed for a long, rough
trip.
On April 21st the party left Tsin-
ing, Shantung Province, for Cheng-
Chou-fu, Honan Province, and ar-
rived there the evening of the 23rd.
Some time was spent here in obtain-
ing information from the railway of-
ficials so that our surveys might be
Repairing the Dike Along the Yellow River
quent cross-sections of the stream and
gagings; to observe at least twice
daily the ground water level as in-
dicated by the water in wells; to take
careful notes of all signs of former
breaks in the dikes and to get all in-
formation regarding these from the
people that it was possible to obtain.
So extensive a survey required con-
siderable preparation. Three months
provisions were purchased for the
American engineers, additional instru-
ments and equipment were procured
wherever possible, engineers and sur-
connected with theirs and enable us to
distribute our field parties to advant-
age in the small villages along the
river.
On April 28th two parties were
sent to the south bank at the cross-
ing of the Pekin Hankow Railway to
begin their work and on the next
morning three parties were sent to the
bridge on the north bank and the re-
mamder as well as the office force, to
villa^s near the south bank.
Three dikes were found to parallel
the river through Honan Province,


201
one to the south and two to the north.
The two best parties, one transit stadia
and the other level, were assigned to
carry the line along the south dike.
One transit stadia party was assigned
to carry a line along each of the north
outer dikes and a level party was de-
tailed to the cross-section lines. These
lines were to be run across the val-
ley from outer dike to outer dike, con-
necting with the stadia surveys at
each crossing of the dike. The level
used on this work was fitted with
stadia wires so that distances might
be read and a pocket compass used
to obtain bearings. Thus cross sec-
tions of the valley vver° obtained
every four or five days and a check
made upon the levels of all the stadia
parties.
As there was no outer dike on the
south side through Honan, the other
field party was set at obtaining rec-
ords of all stream gage stations, tak-
ing samples of the water in the river,
taking cross-sections of the bed, and
making gages at these cross-sections.
They were to cooperate with the stadia
parties on both inner dikes so that all
gaging stations found would be in-
corporated in our surveys as the par-
ties passed. It is interesting to note
that though the Chinese officials had
required a careful record to be kept
of the stages of the river at these sta-
tions they had never been connected
by a survey and had never been made
use of.
If possible, daily observations on
the sun were made by each stadia
party to check the azimuth of their
line, and four observations were made
during the trip for longitude. The
notes were sent in to the fHd office
every three or four days and particu-
lar pains were taken to check the
level notes and the traverse so that
errors, if made, might be readily
checked up before the party got very
far from the point.
Soon after the work got well under
way the office force was moved ahead
into Kaifeng, capital of Honan Pro-
vince, for better working quarters and
to obtain all historical information pos-
sible pertaining to movements of the
Yellow River through Honan. When
the field party had reached a point
opposite Kaifeng on the south dike,
they turned south and ran a line to
the railway at this point for a check
on their levels and to obtain informa-
tion as to the topography of the coun-
try through this section.
Considerable time was spent to
thoroughly cover the territory around
where the great break of the dike oc-
curred in 1851-52. This is in the
eastern border of Honan near the
Honan Chihli provincial boundary and
where the river now turns sharply to
the northeast. Several days were
spent here in covering the old river
bed and dikes and noting both cause
and effect of the break as far as pos-
sible.
For centuries past the river had
been piling up the flood plains between
the inner dikes until they had become
several meters higher than the plains
outside the dikes. This distance be-
tween the inner dikes varying from
four to ten miles. At a point just be-
low where the break occurred the vil-
lagers conceived the idea of reclaiming
some of this flood plain and built a
dike enclosing quite a large area. At
one point this dike restricted the
stream bed to about one mile in widtli
and tended to throw the current hnrd
against the north bank or dike. The
people on the north side, f^arine a
break here, built another short dike
out into the flood plain to fend off the
current and thereby still further re-
stricted the channel.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The result was that the channel was
scoured out at this restricted place but
greater deposition took place just
above where the current was retarded
by the damming below. Therefore
the bed was built up and thrown still
farther to the north and finally cut
through the north inner dike at an
unguarded point.
The rush of waters soon cut a wide
gap through the dike and scoured out
a channel in the old deposits so much
great plain and finally cut across the
Grand Canal near Tung-a and took
possession of the bed of the Wei Riv-
er and thus found a way to the sea.
The new mouth was some 900 miles,
by coast line, to the north of the old
one, and on the opposite side of the
Shantung Mountains.
New dikes were hastily thrown up
along both sides of the new channel
and in some parts a double system of
dikes were built both to the north and
Ferry on the Yellow River
deeper than the channel in the old bed
that it was impossible to turn the
stream back into its old course. A
great quantity of silt above the break
was torn loose and carried down by
the flood and deposited on the plains
to the northeast in the effort of the
river to readjust itself to the change
in levels in the new course. It was
found that a village some twenty miles
from the break and nearly in the di-
rect course of the flood was buried
some four or five feet by this silt.
The flood spread for miles over this
south of the stream. In places these
are still too weak to stand a serious
flood and frequently break, causing
considerable damage. Both Chihli and
Shantung Provinces have parties con-
stantly strengthening and repairing the
dikes.
Our survey was continued down the
new channel and connected up with
the previous survey made along the
Grand Canal. Later we endeavored
to extend the survey down the river
below the canal to the Tientsin Pukow
railway bridge but the bandit condi-


203
tions were so threatening that all but
two parties refused to go farther.
These were given a much larger mil-
itary guard and started along the
north inner dike and the remainder
of the force was taken down the river
iu boats and sent in to the headquart-
ers at Tientsin. There is no south
dike system through this section as the
river follows closely along the foot
the Shantung mountains.
Our surveys showed that both the
Yellow and Wei rivers could be used
as sources of supply for water for the
canal but rather expensive as the wat-
er would have to be conducted some
distance. From gages on the Wei
River it was found that this stream
could not well be drawn on during the
dry season, as present shipping re-
quires all the available supply. From
samples sent in by our party it was
found that the silt carried in the wat-
ers of the Yellow River for the great-
er part of the year would render set-
tling basins of so short a life that this
source would be expensive and for
short periods only. The streams from
the Shantung Mountains to the south
are a nearer source of supply and
from later investigations seem to be
of sufficient volume to afford the nec-
essary quantities for the present. The
Chin Ho, a stream in the northwestern
part of the Honan Province, seems to
be a source of supply that would meet
all increased demands from the de-
velopment of commerce in this sec-
tion, but we were unable to com-
plete investigations here. These in-
vestigations are now being made and
will soon be available.
Our investigations of the conditions
along the Yellow River show: First,
that the bed is again being built up and
will in a comparatively short tim/s
force the river into a new course;
second, that there are weak points in
the dikes of Honan that might break
at almost any flood and once broken
would be hard to close. Here appar-
ently is the next great break and if
this occurs the floods will find an
outlet to the sea well to the south near
Shanghai or well to the north at
Tientsin, depending on which dike,
the north or south, is broken. Through
Chihli and Shantung Provinces it was
found that the dikes were weak in
places and quite likely to give way
but that the damage would probably
be more local and the stream would be
apt to again find its way back into its
present bed. In either case, consid-
erable damage is likely to be done
along the canal.


NON-TECHNICAL POINTS
H. J. M. G.
Of Smith, Hinchman and Grylls
"I'm sorry, Jim, but I can't feel
that you are the man for the job.
Your technical knowledge seems to
be alright, and you've been with us
longer than anyone else. There's no
kick on that."
"Well then," said Jim, "what is the
matter? Please speak plainly. Why
is the Board of Directors putting
Brown in ahead of me as General
Manager?"
"I don't konw," said the Vice-Pres-
ident. "We talked it over and the
general sentiment was rather in favor
of you. When the votes were count-
ed, however, Brown had it by a large
majority. Some of the Directors like
you personally very much, and I am
one of them. I knew your father, of
course, and we all worked together
here for many years. I remember
when he brought you to the office the
first time. You were about ten, and
your dad introduced you as gravely
as though you had been a bank-pres-
ident. He said many times he was
going to have you work up from the
bottom. lie was right about it. too.
"Mow, Jim, when you ask me
'What's the matter,' you have me
stuck. Sit down over there, and listen
to a few words from an older man.
If I could answer your question I
would do something that all the sages
from Aristotle to Emerson have work-
ed on. Do you ever read the Class-
ics? Great stuff—you ought to b?gin
pt once. Just pick up a book by
Darwin or Huxley or Adam Smith
and spend a few hours entertaining
yourself. The style, of course, and
general cultural value is unquestioned.
What might surprise you, however, is
to find that you can actually use these
hundred-year-old ideas in your every-
day business.
"It's the truth. And there's the use
of effective English in your letters
and conversation. A business letter
is the only link between our house and
a great many of our best clients. The
importance of correct and effective
English is not appreciated by one
engineer in a hundred. You engineers
think that if you can design a beam
and stress out a roof-truss, you are
fitted to run a big corporation—or
anything else, for that matter.
"There's one thing you have, Jim,
that's indispensable, and that honesty.
Some men actually work harder try-
ing to put something over than they
would have to work to do the thing it-
self. I can do business with a man
who is incompetent, or blind, or broke,
or even drunk; but I cannot do busi-
ness with a liar. Some men get so
they can actually tell when a man is
lying, and this ability certainly comes
in handy. But there is no one thing
so inevitably fatal as dishonesty."
The Vice-President paused and
gazed out the window. The first snow
of the season was falling. It was aft-
er five and most of the office force
had gfone home. Jim spoke up.
"Yes, Mr. Williams. I know I am
honest—this is one point in my favor.
I have a technical degree, of course.
I have hen Chief Engineer for two
years. This is one reason why T want
to know just what is lacking in mv


205
make-up. I'd give a whole lot to know
what's the matter with me!"
The white-haired veteran thought a
full minute. "Jim," he said, "there's
no one big thing the matter with you.
Rather is it a combination of small
things. Do you ever imagine yourself
in my chair, for instance, confronted
with problems in management, in
finance, or in determining a sales pol-
icy? You have ambition I know, but
have you that fixity of purpose—that
stay-on the main track faculty—that
leads you ever onward and upward.
Aren't you inclined to put aside your
job at five o'clock for a dinner or a
theatre party? There's such a thing
as having your name in the society
column a little too often—don't you
think so?
"Another very important thing is
judgment. In the first place aren't
you a little inclined to avoid using
your own judgment? Perhaps this is
because your observation faculties
haven't been developed. A man can't
have sound judgment unless he has
sound facts to begin on. And the best
way to get your facts is to observe
them for yourself.
"Now, Jim, here is your chance to
show your real stuff. Figure out for
yourself what you lack—use your own
observation. Plan out a future for
yourself—use your own imagination.
Figure out how to do it and watch
your own progress—judge the import-
ant things for yourself. See yourself
as others see you—get the other fel-
low's point of view.
"I might sit here and point out a
dozen things like these and maybe
I'd be wrong on half of them. The
main thing is to figure it out for your-
self. Your coming in here and asking
me what I think is wrong is a precious
thing to me—I'm glad you came—but
you should have been able to figure
it out for yourself. The practice on
such things is sometimes more valu-
able than the actual thing itself. My
advice to you is to keep your head
up and your tail over the dashboard
—and go to it!"
This was five years ago. When the
new General Manager resigned to or-
ganize a competing company, the
Board of Directors unanimously elect-
ed Jim to direct their end of the fight.
It's a great game.

PROF. F. N. MENEFEE. C.E.
What you find in the succeeding
paragraphs is addressed to engineer-
ing students. In a sense it is a crit-
icism of a condition for which the
student is not responsible. It is an at-
tempt to point out to the student a
condition which older engineers knew
only and well, but which they have
not succeeded in correcting. Observa-
tion has led many engineers to the
conclusion that there is something
lacking in the engineer which if he
possessed it would make him a more
potent factor in our present complex
system.
In many, places today particularly
in our engineering colleges, the broad
general question of "The Future Eng-
ineer," how we shall train him is un-
der advisement. Colleges and govern-
ments reform slowly, however, while
your college days pass quickly.
I do not presume to be giving you
advance information as to what your
curricula will require of you a year
from today, but if it should recom-
mend broader training my suggestions
may be of service then if not immed-
iately.
The question is closely connected
with the personal welfare of the eng-
ineer, and is, for that reason, import-
ant. It affects the engineer's influ-
ence in the world and that makes it
more important; for I take it, regard-
less of a man's profession, he justifies
his existence in proportion to the
amount he contributes in making the
world a better place to live and de-
velop in. If the foregoing is true,
anything that will assist him in mak-
ing the world a better place for hum-
ans to live and develop in, is worth
discussing.
It will suffice for our purpose to as-
sume that the engineer has the tech-
nical qualifications that are necessary
for him to possess in order success-
fully to prosecute his technical work.
Now, what is it that the engineers
have observed? What is.lacking? We
have observed that engineers in the
past have not taken as large a share in
public life as other professional men,
and a careful survey and analysis
leads one to the conclusion that, as a
class, we lack the power effectively to
express the thousand ideas that spring
from our qualifications (about which
I will speak later). We lack the pow-
er to make an individual, a group, or
an audience, see and believe us. Pos-
session of this would be satisfying to
the engineer and, I believe, beneficial
to the public. Generally speaking, the
engineer seldom gets beyond the group,
his failure to convince an audience is
largely because he seldom gets up
nerve to tackle one. Curiously, very
often the engineer lacks power to
write convincingly enough. A good
salesman believes in his goods and so
do most engineers. Then why is the
engineer a poor salesman? He lacks
power to describe attractively or viz-
ualizc or picture that which he sees.
Sometimes he doesn't know his Eng-
lish well. He may know his technical
language. X Y Cosine thetas, but to be
of the fullest usefulness he must know
his English well and be able to use it
so that the layman can understand.
Not use it' just fairly well, like the
Freshman who, going up the steps
two at a time, to a class in English,
was accosted by "Hello, Bill, what
d'you know?" answered, "Nothing
but English, what the Hell do you
know?"
Then the engineer's rigorous tech-


207
nical training is apt to make us hyper-
critical, we analyze all problems from
our technical viewpoint, pass judg-
ment and forget that it is one thing to
see clearly the answer ourselves, and
another to convince the public. We
forget that it is not enough to be able
to form a correct conclusion. We.for-
get that all sciences are, or should be.
subservient to the science of human
nature. That all humans while seek-
ing the truth are prone to accept that
doctrine which is delivered in the most
attractive wrapper. Hence the success
of the demagoge to the disgust of the
engineer, who criticizes alike the dem-
agoge and the public and retires to his
slide rule and logarithms.—things that
do not assist him in his problem of
how to deal with public questions.
Now, let us look into the problem of
the engineer and see whether we are
justified in assuming that we really
are qualified to do other things besides
figuring out the power requirements
of a factory, or the dimensions of
members of a bridge to carry certain
loads, or the loss of voltage in a trans-
mission line.
Consider the engineer's training. lie
studies the law of gravity, the laws
of chemistry, the laws governing the
transmission of light, the laws of heat,
the laws of electricity, the laws of re-
sistance of materials to stresses, to
transmission of heat, light, electricty,
etc. For four years he intensely
studies nature's laws, not man-made
laws, but God's laws. Plato said,
"The laws of nature are the mathe-
matical thoughts of God." Think-
that over. You engineers are being
schooled in the laws that the Creator
has established. Your intellects cer-
tainly possess close kinship to the
force we call God, that force which
created the universe and put it into
operation, else your intellect could not
comprehend and follow and some-
times discover new laws to reveal to
your fellow beings. Laws, of course,
that have been in existence since the
creation, awaiting development of
your capability to reduce them to man
made expressions and conventions, aft-
er which they become tools of the
engineer for the accomplishment of
world wonders. Do you see where
you stand in the scheme of the uni-
verse? You are enlisting yourselves
in a service which demands that you
learn the regulation established by the
Creator and by putting them into
operation you are assisting the Divine
Force which operates the world. Do
you see that in learning to deal with
infinitesimals, in learning of the small-
est unit that goes to make up a sub-
stance, in learning the simplest forces
in electricity and steam, and heat, that
you are dealing in first principles, in
basic facts, that you are preparing
yourselves for combining all these
principles in the various ways in which
they are capable of combination for
the common good of man? Do you
see that you are laying the true found-
ation for the faculty of analysis? For
a greater understanding of cause and
effect? Do you see that in the solution
of the problems that are put before
you, you are taking given facts and
combining them in harmony with na-
ture's laws, and that the results are
predictable in conformity with the
closeness with which you follow those
laws? Do you see that after four
years of such training and a few
years of practice, the engineer's habit
of taking basic facts and building dis-
cussions on them, fits him admirably
for solving economic problems as well
as engineering problems? Doesn't it
seem reasonable that public questions
requiring searching analysis and care-
ful combination of basic facts and


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
variables, would be handled as well,
or perhaps better, by the engineer than
by others who are lacking in the
training of analysis?
Isn't it possible that the broad re-
quirements, of an engineer's training,
generally considerable travel in his
younger years and the compulsion of
a speedy verdict and judgment on his
works, has made the engineer, as a
class, the most accurate of thinkers?
To the last question let me invite your
attention to a statement which I heard
a certain General in the army make
not long ago. He said that grades of
the engineers in the army psychology
tests were higher, as a class, than the
grades of any other profession. He
casually remarked, "Obviously noth-
ing nothing can be published to that
effect, but it is true."
Yes, I believe we are qualified to be
something in addition to just "figure
mills on the far end of the push but-
ton." But first let us see what the
engineer has actually done with the
limitation of being unable to talk with-
out a pencil in his hand.
Did you ever stop to consider that
within the last century, or less, the
engineer has added ioo or possibly
200 per cent to the life of the individ-
ual. That is, assuming that the indi-
vidual is doing something—working
or playing during his waking hours,
and assuming that he puts the time
which the engineers saves him to some
use—work or play. To get this con-
clusion, consider that to get light, we
turn a switch instead of getting the
lamp and lighting it. We light the gas
stove in an instant instead of chopping
wood and starting the kitchen range,
we turn the tap for water instead of
going to the well, we empty water into
the kitchen sink instead of carrying it
out into the back yard and throwing
it broadcast, we have sewer systems
which not only save time but actually
increase the health and average of life,
we telephone instead of going to the
market and carrying our goods home,
we ride by automobile instead of horse
and buggy, we save time thru better
roads, we cross the continent or ocean
in days instead of months, whether
we move from our own doorstep or
not, we have goods and commodities
from the ends of the earth, we have
power appliances of every description
and kind that save time and make pos-
sible operations that would otherwise
be impossible, these and many more
timesavers, are creditable to the eng-
ineer's application of science.
Yes, I believe the engineer is not
only qualified by training, but by the
test of service, to participate in all ac-
tivities of life to a greater extent than
he does, but due to the complexity of
social organizations today, the public
must be convinced of his worth. You
learn in technical terms but you must
express in simple, forceful layman
terms. You must learn to write well
or picture well. What architect would
ever get a commission to draw plans
for a great cathedral without first sub-
mitting a beautiful drawing in colors,
properly set with trees and shrubs,
with a well-drawn sky-line of moun-
tains -and clouds? The general public
doesn't see the minarets, the gargoyles,
louvers and ballustrades, they see the
beautiful arrangement of towers, bel-
fries, windows and stone railings.
I believe the engineer has the latent
qualities for great influence but that
custom has not lead him to present
himself properly. Too often custom
has not pointed out the benefit of
simplicity and departure from techni-
calities. It seems that it is his duty to
learn if he is to make the proper use
of his ability. But to perform that
duty we must learn to talk. Why


209
should an engineer shrink back in his
chair in a public meeting and always
listen when, with a little practice, he
will, through his training in first
principles, and his power of analysis,
be able to contribute to the solution
of the question at hand.
Well, here is a note of encourage-
ment. Engineers are entering more
and more into public life. I am sorry
to say that our colleges have taught
their students that the highest position
in our land was within their reach.
Why shouldn't we make it plain that
with a good sound training in nature's
laws, plenty of reading along human-
itarian lines, experience in engineering
and business (they can't de divorced)
an engineer should be as capable of
administering in high life as well as
the lawyer or a business man? But
you must learn to talk and make your-
self understood.
Start now, increase your vocabul-
ary, try it on your associates and on
your teachers, teach a Sunday School
class, make use of every opportunity
to put your ideas and thoughts into
words. Our language is not hard,
foreigners master it and though they
make amusing use of our terms, they
often excel us in getting the idea
across. A foreign storekeeper once
said to a lazy clerk, by way of com-
mendation, "I see you come early of
late, you used to always be behind
before, but now you're first at last."
Let me remind you that every true
American enjoys having his say.
Don't sit back with your logarithm
table and slide rule and expect the
world to act as you are thinking. It
seems to me that ours is a great op-
portunity with the foundation of our
predecessors well laid, and that our
duty is plain.
Don't assume from what I have said
that all laws of nature have been re-
duced to mathematical expressions,
more will be when the engineer broad-
ens out. There is one law of nature
which compels one to make some use
of every force our natures possess. A
man possessed of artistic ability or
training will express that training in
some sort of outward activity. One
endowed with mechanical talent will
find himself exercising along mechan-
ical lines, for good or for bad, and a
man with analytical training will an-
alyze and if he will, outwardly express
the fact that he has done so. Lack of
power of expression may repress him,
but not prevent some outward man-
ifestation; if a good writer or a good
talker, he will get great satisfaction
in the understanding he can generate
between himself and others, his an-
alytical power will grow and most
likely be constructively used. Other-
wise, he is apt to degenerate into an
armchair critic, one who analyzes for
the fault in all activities around him.
This is the state that engineers are apt
to slip into if care is not exercised to
prevent it. It is the inevitable result
of a faulty system of education, where
a force is generated and its compli-
ment, the power of utilization of that
force is almost solely neglected.
Cease being critical except of your-
self, nothing is perfect—accept this
doctrine and patiently and persua-
sively swing others to your sugges-
tions of improvements. John Coch-
ran, Director of Publicity for the Un-
ited States Bureau of Mines, hints
that a technical man in a great art
gallery, among simple minded folk,
who were admiring the "Venus de
Milo" in their crude, enthusiastic way,
would take issue with them and sug-
gest that it is not true to nature be-
cause it does not have warts on its
feet and no varicose veins on the leg.
And, gentlemen, if you don't see the


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
application of the idea to the engineer,
I believe you will in a few more years.
You are going to, on some of your
good technical work, adopt a critical
attitude toward the way public of-
fairs are handled and, in fact, a crit-
ical attitude towards things in gener-
al, both small and great. Now, isn't
it more fitting that the engineer's pow-
er of analysis should be applied posi-
tively as well as negatively? Wouldn't
it be better if both individually and
collectively the engineer could keep to
himself the criticism and use that
power constructively? In so doing,
we at once meet with the necessity of
cooperating with others, and by writ-
ing or speaking, persuade and con-
vince others, all types of people of
what we believe to be the better way?
If we say "yes'' to this question we
are face to face with the engineer's
lack of training in this line.
Some of you may want suggestions
as to how to proceed to this accom-
plishing of influencing others in pub-
lic or semi-public addresses. I pre-
sume there is no rule that would ap-
ply to all. Literary and law students
take regular courses in oratory. Cer-
tainly a reasonable mastery of Eng-
lish and rhetoric is desirable, and this
coupled with a will to express your
thoughts clearly, with well chosen
words in the class room, will form
a fair foundation upon which to build.


W. B. CAMPBELL
Vice-President of the Commercial Milling Co.
Wage earners, in nearly all parts of
the civilized world, labor under a spir-
it of great discontent. Their leaders
have taught them that Labor pro-
duces all wealth and therefore right-
fully owns it, that Capital wrongfully
possesses the fruit of their toil.
The statement so far as it relates to
the production of things seems almost
an axiom and yet we have no peace
on earth because we disagree so ab-
solutely regarding it.
Assuming that the great majority of
men earnestly seek the truth, it would
appear that some misunderstanding
keeps Labor and Capital apart. This
paper will argue that the trouble arises
from the inability or unwillingness of
the partisans to recognize Labor un-
less it happens to be dressed in over-
alls and shirtsleeves.
Perhaps no one has had more to do
in moulding opinion among Michigan
wage earners than Mr. Batts. In the
course of a serious newspaper debate,
he recently denounced schools and
colleges as the enemies of Labor. He
asked why teachers submit problems
such as: If A buys two dozen pairs
of shoes at $3.50 per pair and sells
them at $6.00 per pair how much does
he make?, thus fixing the attention of
the child on profits and never gives
such problems as: If P&gt; makes twenty
four pairs of shoes a day and receives
$5.00 for his labor and his employer C
sells them at $3.50 per pair, what be-
comes of the difference?, turning the
pupil's thoughts to greater things than
profits.
Mr. Batts probably finds enemies
where there are none and he knows
that Social problems could not supply
mathematical training, but, never tne
less, the world is interested in his pro-
blem.
Labor in its simplest terms, finds
itself in possession of a bit of land
in a wilderness. It pours itself forth
upon the land, fells trees, rears a hut,
digs the soil, plants, cares for and
reaps its scanty harvests and some day
wakens to find that the spot in the
wilderness has become a farm. Much
of the natural wealth of the forest
has been destroyed, but something
more valuable has replaced it. No
labor has been sold neither has any
been given away. No employer
entered into the enterprise. No
wisely engaged labor has been lost. It
has just been transformed into fertile
fields and buildings and grain. It has
become Capital.
In the course of time other settlers
located nearby. It soon appeared that
certain tasks, such as the threshing,
could be performed much more eco-
nomically when a numbed of men
worked together, than when each
worked alone. There was little or no
money in the community. Labor was
practically their only Capital and cer-
tainly the most liquid asset, so they
"Changed Work." That is to say,
they paid for labor with labor. Each
man was employer for a day and then
became wage earner until he had paid
each helper a day's labor. In our
complicated system this really hap-
pens, only the change of work is not
a direct one and we use certificates
that we call money, etc., that show
that we have rendered the Community


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
a certain unit of labor and are en-
titled to one of equivalent value in
return when ever we can find some-
one willing to make the trade. After
completing a unit of labor; a day, a
week, a ''job", a free man has a just
claim for compensation. He also has
the right to dispose of the compensa-
tion as he will, subject to reasonable
regulations; to dispose of all; or to
disposa of a part and retain the re-
mainder. To refuse this inherent
right and to demand that the wage
. earner dispose of all compensation
immediately, would soon reduce the
world to the level of the non-food ac-
cumulating brutes. He may, indeed
he must, while gifted with surplus en-
ergy exert himself beyond the limit re-
quired for his daily sustenance so he
may store up and preserve that sur-
plus for future use.
Life blesses every normal man with
a period during which he possesses
this surplus of energy and we know
that a time will come when we can
not produce sufficient to meet our
necessities. While there is yet time,
that surplus labor must transform it-
self into something tangible that can
be preserved for the period of under-
production.
The instant he preserves any part
thereof, it becomes Capital. If this
is true, then Capital is really Canned
Labor.
These conditions spring from no
special social system. Robinson Cru-
soe, minus his man Friday, on his
fruitful island, would have had no so-
cial system, but he would have found
no escape from these requirements.
There can be no questions as to
the necessity of Capital, i.e.. Canned
Labor. We have only to decide wheth-
er we shall each retain his own sur-
plus or shall turn it over to some
Master whose name may be The State,
The Soviet, or what you will.
Did B really make twenty four pairs
of shoes in a day or was he but one
of a host of workers, some visible and
some invisible, who labored together
to produce them?
We need not consider the visible
helpers, the fireman, engineer, teams-
ters, porters, salesmen and the like,
for the pupils of Mr. Batts readily
recognize most of these indirect work-
ers, but Labor that was performed in
the past—though Canned Labor—is
withstanding it really is far and away
really the greatest factor in this pro-
duction.
C, the employer, may be an individ-
ual or may be many, a corporation, but
each contributed a part or all of his
Canned Labor, some of them may have
added unto the Canned Labor in-
herited from ancestors. The company
exchanged this for the labor of brick-
makers, teamsters, masons, inventors,
engineers, skilled mechanics and many
others and when B starts his machine,
all workers who contributed in any
• way to the construction of the plant
stand alongside B ready to contribute
certain aid to the company, because
the company has turned over to them
some form of certificate of compen-
sation for an equivalent amount of
labor done some time in the past.
C, D, E, and F do not stand at his
side at the instant, but instead they
arose hours ago, may be five, ten, fifty
years ago and performed their share
of the task that these inventors, build-
ers and skilled mechanics now repay.
C may be in the office at other work
and D his work done may be out on
the golf links, but their labors enter
into the production of the twenty four
pairs of shoes just as surely as does
that of B. Strip B of the help these


213
men contribute and place him once
more on the cobblers bench and B can
make but a fraction of a pair a day.
We shall not know exactly whether
B, C or any one else involved in the
problem receives his just share of the
proceeds of the sale of the twenty
four pairs of shoes until we know
just how much labor each contribut-
ed. We have not sought the exact
answer, but rather the course we
must take if we would know the
truth.
We recognize the fact that some-
times a part or all of our justly earn-
ed stores of Canned Labor and our
shares in the common natural wealth
are taken from us because of the op-
erations of special privilege or
through the unequal distribution of
the unearned increment or downright
dishonesty.
Our lawmakers recognize all of
these evils and have undertaken to
curb special privilege and yet develop
our natural resources, to obtain a
more equitable distribution of the un-
earned increment and to prevent dis-
honesty. If given reasonable time we
may look for solutions of the first
and second phases of the problem.
With the last we must contend until
the millenjum under any social sys-
tem.
The world has tried all proposed
systems. It has made its real pro-
gress under the capitalistic form, for
here, alone, can we hope for the stim-
ulant of individual initiative.
Picture in your mind the poverty
stricken throng that has entered to
United States through Ellis Island
and then test our system by a search
through the commercial reports,
through lists of students in our col-
leges; or take your stand beside some
popular highway on a holiday and
mark the happy faces that drive by
you and note how many names and
faces you identify as those who but
recently were of that throng at Ellis
Island.
We have not failed, we will still
strive to improve; but they who would
destroy our government would des-
stroy mankind's best earthly friend.


TRAFFIC
PROF. A. H. BLANCHARD
This discussion of "Paved High-
ways for Present-Day Traffic," will
be confined to the consideration of
traffic in interstate and intrastate trunk
highways and the roadway require-
ments which should be met in order
properly to provide for traffic devel-
opment.
An investigation of the probable
traffic development on any highway
outside of a municipality should be
based upon what has come to be com-
monly known as a highway trans-
port survey, which includes a consid-
eration of all classes of traffic which
might use the highway, rural and ur-
ban transportation opportunities and
competing carriers including railway
and waterway facilities. What are
the several methods of transportation
included in the general term, highway
transport? It is evident that highway
transport includes all methods of
transportation of passengers and com-
modities over highways.
We have been familiar, for many
years, with the utilization of high-
ways for the transportation of pas-
sengers through the medium of horse-
drawn vericles and runabouts, tour-
ing cars and limousines. A develop-
ment in this field with which the high-
way engineer must reckon is the in-
stallation of motor-bus routes on
highways ouside of municipalities.
England has had an enormous devel-
opment in this field during the past
fifteen years. In this country, such
development had gained a certain
headway prior to the War, as indicat-
ed by the successful operation of 125
rural motor-bus routes in T914 in the
State of New York. Motor-bus
routes have been rapidly developed
for the transportation of passengers
between urban districts which are not
adequately served by steam and elec-
tric railways. Another development
along this line is the utilization of the
motor-bus for the transportation of
children to consolidated rural schools.
The State of Mchigan is at the thres-
hold of this development and should
give it thorough consideration at once
in order to provide adequate high
grade educational facilities for its
rural population. To give some idea
of the development of traffic in this
field, it is well to call attention to the
fact that approximately 2,000,000
children living in 65,000 old rural
school districts throughout the United
States are now being transported
daily throughout the school year to
13,000 consolidated schools.
The methods of transportation of
commodities are many and varied. Re-
stricting the discussion to the methods
used outside of municipalities, we
have first what might be called inter-
urban haulage, which includes all
methods of highway transport used
for transportation of commodities be-
tween municipalities. We then have
short and long rural haulage which
includes all highway transport meth-
ods which utilize highways outside
of municipalities except intercity haul-
age and highway transport operating
on definite routes according to serv-
ice schedules. In this field is in-
cluded transport by companies whose
business is exclusively long and short
distance trucking and the traffic re-
sulting from the transportation of
commodities by men engaged in farm-


215
ing, by wholesale and retail stores of
our municipalities, and by the trans-
portation departments of our plants,
factories, lumber camps, mines, and
other industries using natural re-
sources. There are several other
methods of highway transport which
require consideration but only one
more will be mentioned, namely, the
rural motor express, which pertains to
the transportation of commodities on
prescribed routes and, generally, ac-
cording to schedule, in the field of
commerce between rural producers
and a terminal city, village, railway
depot or waterway dock. By analyz-
ing the development along each of
these lines of highway transport, we
arrive at an estimate of the vehicular
traffic which will use a given trunk
highway.
In most cases, provision must be
made for a rapid increase in the vol-
ume and weight of traffic units. For
example* the writer has recently re-
ceived results of traffic investigations
in the State of Rhode Island. On one
trunk highway, the daily motor truck
traffic increased 1113% between
August, 1913, and August, 1920, the
numerical daily increase being from
47 motor trucks in 1913 to 570 in
1920. On another trunk highway, the
increase in automobile traffic from
1915 to 1920 was 102% or an increase
in number of vehicles from 1980 in
1915 to 4008 in 1920, and an increase
in this period of 659% in the number
of motor trucks, as in 1915. the daily
average was 79 and in 1920, it was
600. These increases are due solely
to the development of highway trans-
port and not because the trunk high-
ways cited were unimproved in 1913
and 1915 respectively. In consider-
ing these increases, it should be borne
in mind that Rhode Island had had a
large percentage of its trunk mileage
constructed for many years as it
started its highway development pro-
gram in 1903 with a law which pro-
vided only for a system of state trunk
highways to be constructed and main-
tained by and at the expense of the
State.
The problem of the design of a
highway from the standpoint of traf-
fic resolves itself into a determination
of the probable amount and character
of vehicular traffic during a future
period, the design of the grades, curv-
es, and width of the roadway so that
it will be efficiently serviceable for the
traffic which it is to carry, the de-
termination of the amount and char-
acter of external forces to which the
different parts of the highway are sub-
jected and finally the design of the
bridges, drainage systems, founda-
tions and roadways so that they will
have sufficient internal strength to re-
sist the external forces during a reas-
onable period of time.
The forces, due to motor truck
traffic, which should be given consid-
eration in the design of a roadway
wearing course and its substructures
are the direct load causing compres-
sion, impact-forces, shearing-forces
of the driving wheels, and the result-
ant-forces between the subgrade and
the pavement foundation. Necessar-
ily these forces are functions of the
volume, weight, speed, and character
of the vehicles using the highways.
These factors are determined as a re-
sult of information furnished by high-
way transport surveys and legislative
regulations covering these factors.
The best indication which we have of
the probable normal maximum
weights of vehicles to which high-
ways will be subjected in the immed-
iate future is the recommendation of
a Committee of the National High-
way Traffic Association which was
adopted at the 1919 Convention of the
American Road Builders Association


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
and which was later incorporated in
the Proposed Uniform Vehicle Law
which is supported by several nation-
'al organizations. The above recom-
mendation pertaining to motor trucks
allows a load per linear inch of width
of tire of 800 pounds and a maximum
gross load on four wheels of 28,000
pounds. These limitations, which
have been embodied in the laws of
several states, allow the use of motor
trucks having a capacity of seven and
one-half tons. In this connection, it
should be noted that the Trailer Man-
ufacturers' Association of America
has advocated legislation limiting the
weight on four wheels of a trailer,
including vehicle, body and load, to
28,000 pounds. These recommenda-
tions give us a definite starting point
for the design of pavements and their
substructures. Although those who
have given careful consideration to
the probable development of highway
transport believe that the economic
and efficient development of this form
of transportation will not necessitate,
for many years, the utilization of
motor trucks having a greater capacity
than seven and one-half tons, never-
theless it is admitted that it may be
desirable in isolated cases to transport
over highways, loads on four
wheels in excess of the limit
prescribed. The transportation of
such weights, however, should be pro-
vided for by special legislation rather
than be accepted as the fundamental
basis for design. This matter has
been properly handled in a regulation
which has been advocated for inclu-
sion in state statues by the Trailer
Manufacturers' Association of Am-
erica. This section reads as follows:
"Authority to he given to state, coun-
ty, city and township authorities to
issue special permits for the operation
of vehicles exceeding the foregoing
gross weights, weight per axle and
weight per inch of tire over highways
under their jurisdiction, provided the
highways and bridges to be used are
designated and operators of the ve-
hicles for which permits are issued
are made responsible for any damage
that may be done to the highways and
bridges by reason of such operation."
The recent transportation of a load
of 100,000 pounds on a single trailer
would come within this provision.
This discussion will be limited to a
consideration oft pavements suitable
for interstate and intrastate trunk
highways which will be subjected to
an intensive motor truck traffic. The
width of the pavement should first be
given consideration. Roadways eco-
nomically designed must provide for
carrying the traffic on the paved road-
way surface and not rely upon
the shoulders to carry a part of the
traffic or serve as turnouts. It has
been demonstarted that the latter prac-
tice is neither economical from the
standpoint of the maintenance of pave-
ments and shoulders nor is it efficient
or safe from the standpoint of the
traffic using the highway. In other
words, we must provide for a mini-
mum of two lines of commercial traf-
fic and it is obvious that an operator
of a heavy motor truck will insist
upon allowing a certain amount of
leeway bet\ve?n the outside wheels of
the truck and the edge of the pave-
ment since many operators have had
unfortunate experiences with motor
trucks being stalled in soft shoulders
or ditched. Considering the factors
of widths and speeds of passenger
cars and motor trucks utilizing trunk
highways and that the laws of manv
states permit a maximum width of
eight feet for motor trucks, taken in
coniunction with the rapid increase
in the volume of traffic on trunk high-


217
ways, the conclusion is reached that
twenty feet, for the width of the pave-
ment surface on a trunk highway,
should be considered the minimum.
There are highways where the norm-
al traffic requires provision for two
lines of vehicles and the abnormal
traffic particularly on holidays, Satur-
day afternoons and Sundays will
render the adoption of twenty-four
to twenty-six feet justifiable. This is
due primarily to the fact that pro-
vision should be made for vehicles
standing at the side of the road while
temporarily requiring repairs. While
traveling on a highway in the vicinity
of Detroit on a Sunday during July,
eighteen vehicles parked at the side
of the roadway, and under repair,
were passed in fifteen minutes on a
five mile section. If the transport
survey indicates that the normal
amount of traffic will require provis-
ion for more than two lines of ve-
hicles, a greater width than twenty
feet must be adopted, the additional
width depending upon the character
of the traffic. It does not require
much imagination to reach the conclu-
sion that many interurban highways
will be subjected, during the next de-
cade, to traffic which will necessitate
roadways sufficiently wide to accom-
modate at least four lines of vehicles,
which would mean a width of thirty-
eight to forty-eight feet.
For the classes of trunk highways
under consideration, the roadway
wearing course should be composed of
a brick, cement-concrete (plain or re-
inforced"), bituminous-concret", sheet-
asphalt, wood-block, or a stone-block
pavement supported by a reinforced
concrete, plain cement-concrete, bitu-
minous-concrete or heavy-stone found-
ation. The selection of the particular
type will depend upon many local
economic factors and the results of
the transport survey.
If these recommendations relative
to the requirements of present-day
traffic on trunk highways are not con-
sidered conservative, contemplate the
following facts pertaining to the in-
crease in the use of motor vehicles
during a period of five years. In 1914,
the total registration of motor ve-
hicles in the United States was 1,711,-
339, while in 1919, it was 7,558,848.
This means one motor vehicle to
every fourteen persons throughout
the Union. In Michigan, the 1919
records show that there was one
motor vehicle to every ten persons.
During this same period of five years,
the number of motor trucks in use in-
creased from about 136,000 to 750,-
000. An conservative estimate indi-
cates that the registration of motor
trucks in 1920 will exceed 1,000,000.
The highways outside of our mun-
icipalities have had a changable status
during the past thirty years and the
reasons advanced for their improve-
ment has been many and varied, but
mostly sound. Fortunately, there has
been rapidly developing throughout
the land a conviction that highways
are merely a means to end and that
end is the economic and efficient
transportation of passengers and com-
modities. It has also become self-
evident that unimproved and improp-
erly built highways constitute a posi-
tive barrier to the development of
economic highway transport. In or-
der that highway transport should
take its proper place in our trans-
portation system, the following fund-
amental guiding principle must be ac-
cepted generally: Highways should be
designed, constructed, and maintianed
so as to enable them to carry efficiently
the motor vehicles required for the
rapid development and economic util-
ization of highway transport.


DAVIS
PROF. C. T. JOHNSTON, C.E.
When Dean Cooley and the late Professor Davis inspected the grounds
on which Camp Davis is now located, they found it covered with a dense
growth of vines, brush and trees. Many trees had fallen and some of them
were partially decayed. The jungle was so dense in 1908, when this inspec-
tion took place, that an axe was used to clear a trail from the water's edge
to the top of the hill immediately south of the camp site.
After the close of the summer session for that year, the camp equip-
ment was brought from Glen Lake to Douglas Lake and during the latter
part of August and the month of September a force of men labored, under
the immediate supervision of Professors Merrick and Brodie, to clear the
camp grounds and lay tent floors in readiness for occupation during the
summer of 1909. The camp was obliged to do a great deal of pioneer
work that year. It was necessary to lay out and clear a base line, to erect
triangulation stations, and to do many things that had been repeated many
times during the earlier years of camp history.
The summer camp was first known as the Bogardus Engineering Camp.
The more appropriate name of Camp Davis was not applied to it until 1914
or 1915. Because of the kindness of Colonel Bogardus in donating some
land to the University, the tract, now embracing 3200 acres, retains his
name.
Students, and others, who are only familiar with Camp Davis as it
appears today, would be somewhat surprised if they could have a clear view
of the camps of 1909, 1910, and 1911, and possibly 1912 and 1913. In those
days the camp grounds contained numerous stumps and the hillside was
covered with remains of the original jungle. During the early years of
camp on Douglas Lake a customary evening stunt consisted of carry-
ing fallen trees from the hillside to the lake front, where they were burned
while the camp celebrated by song and other kinds of entertainment. The
mess was on top of the hill until 1916 and there were no modern sanitary
conveniences at camp until 1915. The first permanent improvements were
made in 1912.
In order that it may be understood how fully the students and teach-
ing staff have cooperated in every moment designed to improve and beautify
the camp, the following brief outline is submitted:

Totals $698 $7244
This shows that th° University has gained in labor and supervision
something like $7244 with an actual outlay of $698 in cash in the past nine
summers, or that the teaching staff and students have contributed about
$800 per year in permanent improvements. Each student paid a camp fee
of $10 per summer, or a total of $6710 since and including 1912. This


money, under a resolution of the Board of Regents, goes into the upkeep
of the camp. It has been spent largely for the following equipment:
Centrifugal Pump $ 30.60
4 H. P. Kerosene Engine 128.00
Dynamo, 2^ K. W 85.00
iy2" Reciprocating Pump 45-00
2" Reciprocating Pump 108.55
4 Rowboats 272.00

Lumber Wagon 111.50
Ton Truck 718.80
Small Tools and Miscellaneous 2500.00
Balance on Hand, Approximately 500.00
Total $6718.78
The University has also spent the following sums in direct construction
during the same period:
Residence Buildings $5824.00
Kitchen 490.00
Sanitary System 1984.00
Instrument Room 230.00
Improvement of Roads 200.00
Mess Tents (2) 190.00
Total $8918.00
These figures are fairly complete but it has been impossible to include
all minor items and to analyze costs to the cent. It will be seen that the stu-
students and teaching staff have performed almost as much in the way of
improvement as has been accomplished by the University by direct expendi-
ture. Adding the Camp Fee Fund, provided by a special tax on students, to
the amount donated by the students and teaching staff in the way of labor
and supervision, gives $13,062.78 as compared with $8918 which the Uni-
versity expended directly in permanent construction. The total investment
for the past nine years approximates $22,880.78. The actual outlay in
money, including the camp fees as a University fund, amounts to $15,636.78,
yet it is manifest that the University has a much more valuable property.
The inventory taken at Camp Davis last summer will be analyzed as time
permits and these approximate estimates will be checked fully before the
end of the winter.
Camp Davis enjoys a citizenship which is uniform and democratic. It
is thus able to support the five essentials of a real camp: Order, punctuality,
accuracy, cooperation, and industry. From the mess department, through-


221
out all the administrative features of the camp and embracing all student
activties, these essentials are commonly upheld and supported. The camp
not only provides a place where every citizen may leave a monument in the
way of some camp improvement, but an effort is also made to record each
year a few contributions which are felt rather than seen. Camp Davis is
accumulating a history. This takes the form of comprehensive camp re-
ports, covering the activities of each summer. When Surveying has a home
on the campus, its walls will be decorated with photographs, charts and
maps, which will record many other features of each camp in a graphical
way. This work has been started and the entire record can be brought
up to date with but litth labor and expense.
The camp report of 1920 says that "Camp Davis is more than an in-
stitution or a place,—it is also a state of mind. The grand old man who
founded it and who saw it through its most trying years built wisely and
well. His spirit pervades the camp which now bears his name and his
precepts guide its course through every storm. He will be remembered
with mixed feelings of love and veneration as long as the University of
Michigan exists as an institution of learning."

EDITORIAL
An impression prevails in many universities,—Michigan is
'. e of course not among them,—that one should not permit his
Roth? university course of study to interfere with his education.
To acquire the reputation of being a good mixer; to make
friends, whose influence will help in the profession after graduation; to
catch some of those tempting plums of class honor; to star in athletics or
dramatics; is often looked upon as the more important part of a university
education. At least the major part of one's time is often devoted to these
pursuits.
The man who does not include in his university course some of these
helpful activities misses much of the polish and the real benefit of his stay


at Michigan. The grind usually acquires training and facts, but not the
ability to meet and handle men. The man who includes too much and too
many of these activities to the neglect of the chief business of university
life; i.e., becoming an expert in his chosen field, is choosing the lesser good
for the greater one.
Few men, who think the matter through, will deny that the chief pur-
pose of the four or six years' university course is the equipping of the stu-
dent for the most efficient work in engineering, law, medicine, or what not.
This is because his chief business in life is not to become a good mixer or
an accomplished dramatist or a prominent athlete, but rather a brilliant
engineer or an able doctor. These other accomplishments are excellent
side-lines in the business of living; but one who spent all his time of pre-
paration on his side-line rather than on his chief-line might well be accused
of very poor judgment.
The university course is planned to equip every student at graduation
so that he may take the most effective part possible in the difficult and ex-
acting life of America. Being a good mixer undoubtedly helps in landing
contracts; but merely being a good mixer never could have constructed the
Roosevelt Dam or built the Panama Canal.
The man who fails to acquire the training and exact knowledge his
university course affords, will probably be found not quite half way up the
ladder of success. Beside him will be found the grind who got only the
training and the exact knowledge. Only the few who get both from their
university course will be found at the top.
Industrial Engineering, as a definite college course, has not
Industrial developed very far at Michigan. We have, included under
Engineering mechanical engineering, a group of studies known as the
industrial engineering group. The purpose of these courses
is to train men in the business side of the manufacturing plant and to follow
the profession of production engineers. The true value of men scientifically
trained in present day manufacturing and production methods cannot be
over-estimated. The paucity of production engineers during the war was
keenly felt. A trained director of manufacturing systems and methods is
just as indispensable to the large plant as the commanding general is to the
army. As long as great industrial plants rise and flourish, there must be,
of necessity, men doing the work of production engineers. It is up to our
colleges to supply men capable of filling such positions and filling them well.
The production engineer is the brains of a vast producing system. He is
an executive of high order and holds a very responsible position. For this
reason, he receives a salary far greater than the average technical engineer
can expect to get. If our colleges are to meet the demands of modern in-
dustry, they must recognize the call for men trained along production lines
and make industrial engineering an important branch of scholastic work.


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
The University of Michigan has one of the most powerful
Radio Possibil- and best equipped radio stations of the universities. The
Ities at Michigan station was installed some years ago and, from the time of
its establishment until it was closed by the war, Michigan
was heard all over the country. Last year the station was reopened. An
experimental license was again obtained and the same call "8XA" was re-
assigned. Work done at the station last year was not in any way experi-
mental and, because the station was not really doing anything worth while,
it lias not been reopened this year. In some ways this is to be very much re-
greted. Could not the station be made to serve the university? Last year
the work done was almost entirely amateur relaying and certainly it, in no
way, helped the college. Xo effort was made to get in touch with other
schools, although practically all of the conference universities and a large
number of eastern colleges have radio equipment. Why shouldn't it be
possible to establish communication between all the different schools? All
of these college stations have, or are able to obtain, a license which would
permit them to work on a wave length free from amateur interference.
The advantages of a system of inter-communication are obvious. Each sta-
tion could have scheduled times for being open and it would be possible to
get news items from the different schools. The college papers could run a
column of radio briefs. Scores from athletic contests could be both re-
ceived and sent out. Regular press could be copied from government or
transatlantic stations if desired.
Cooperation between the universities would be necessary to make the
communication system practical but there is no question as to the pos-
sibilities.


ARTHUR J. STOCK, Jr., '22, Editor
LEGISLATION HARMFUL TO AMA-
TEUR RADIO WORK CON-
TEMPLATED
If the- Poindexter Bill No. 4038, now
awaiting action in Senate committee,
should be favorably reported out of the
committee and pass both Houses, becom-
ing a law, the radio experimenter would
be in grave danger of losing his rights
as an amateur. The bill provides for a
committee to take charge of the status and
operation of different classes of stations.
The amateur is not definitely provided for.
In a twinkling, this committee might lay
down conditions of operation which would
make amateur communication an utter im-
possibility and, the worst of the matter is,
that the thousands of amateurs would have
no come-back. They would not be able, in
any way, to plead their cause or to secure
a hearing in the nutter. To prevent any-
such catastrophe, it is up to all amateurs
and American citizens, interested in the
welfare of amateur radio, to write their
representatives and senators telling them to
vote against this bill and to use their influ-
ence in every possible way to defeat legis-
lation detrimental to amateur work. The
radio amateur certainly proved his worth
during the recent war and it is difficult to
see why legislation is coming up which
would curb his activities. Legislation has
come up numerous times in the past and
now it appears again in rather disguised
form. Let's start things moving and show
our representatives at Washington how we
feel toward these vicious and un-American
bills which have a habit of appearing from
time to time. The great system of ama-
teur stations, in which millions of dollars
have been invested and in which research
and experimental work of the highest type
is being continually carried on, should not
be continually menaced by legislation. The
government should be brought to realize
the true value of the radio amateur and,
instead of continually threatening his ex-
istence, steps should be taken to encourage
him and allow him all possible freedom for
future development.
MORE COURSES OFFERED IN
MODERN LANGUAGES
Of the twelve hundred engineering and
architectural students taking modern lan-
guages five hundred are taking French,
four hundred and fifty Spanish, and two
hundred and fifty German. This shows an
increase in the Spanish and German De-
partments over last year.
There has also been a few changes in
the teaching staff. Instructors Molt and
Osburn are now instructing at the U. S.
Naval Academy at Annapolis. Mr. Albala-
dajo, a native Spaniard, who has taught at
the State University of Kansas and Indi-
ana, and Mr. Luzunaris, a native of Porto
Rico, are now on the staff. Instructors


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
Driscoll, and McGuire, both graduates of
Brown, and men who have spent consider-
able time in France with the A. E. F., are
here this year. Mr. McGuire was inter-
preter with the American Commission to
negotiate peace.
In order to give students, who have com-
pleted the regular language requirement,
an opportunity to continue language work,
as elective cultural courses, several new
courses are being offered. Advanced
courses in composition and conversation,
and in literature are now available in both
French and Spanish. These literature
courses are given in English, so that a stu-
dent who has taken courses in languages
but desires to learn something of the liter-
ature of another language may do so with-
out learning the language as was hereto-
fore necessary.
A. I. Ch. E. TO HOLD MEETING
HERE
Prof. W. L. Badger of the Department
of Chemical Engineering presented a pa-
per before the American Institute of Chem-
ical Engineers at the meeting in New Or-
leans during the middle part of Decem-
ber. The paper was the fifth research pa-
per to come from the evaporator labora-
tory at the University of Michigan. The
problems that are being studied are those
dealing with the transfer of heat from
steam to liquid under the conditions met
in commercial evaporators.
The American Institute of Chemical En-
gineers will hold its next meeting in De-
troit in June, 1921. It is probable that
they may hold their session for one day in
Ann Arbor.
PROF WHITE SPEAKS AT MEETING
OF A. S. M. E. IN NEW YORK ..
Professor White read a paper at the
meeting of the American Society of Me-
chanical Engineers in New York the 10th
of December. The November number of
Mechanical Engineering, which is the offi-
cial organ of the Society, carries as its
first article an illustrated abstract of five
pages giving the important portions of the
article. The subject is the constitution
and properties of boiler tubes. This work
was undertaken because of serious fail-
ures in boiler tubes experienced at the
plants of the Detroit Edison Co., which
operates under a serious overload. The rea-
sons for the defects are given to be due
to an increase in size of the crystals of the
metal in particular portions where it
had be?n strained, the resulting brittleness
causing the tubes to give way in time.
This problem was presented in 1916; and
as a result of the studies made at that
time, a changed specification was suggest-
ed, whose value is shown after four years'
experience. The new type of tubes has
twice the life of the old. The paper is of
unusual interest to all engineers in the
power plant field.
R. O. T. C. TO HAVE OFFICIAL
UNIFORMS
During the year of 1919-1920 Michigan
was practically the only University without
organized, uniformed R. O. T. C. Unit.
Many institutions starting these units al-
ready had distinctive uniforms which had
been used for military training prior to
the organization of these units.These insti-
tutions continued the use of the uniforms
and most of the schools which had not re-
quired military training adopted a distinc-
tive uniform when the units were organ-
ized.
Some desire for a distinctive uniform
was expressed here last year and while the
sentiment generally favored a uniform,
opinion was not fully crystalized until
Michigan students attending summer camp
had an opportunity to see the uniforms
worn at other institutions. Consequently,
when the University reopened this fall a
sample uniform based on the general ideas
of the students in the R. O. T. C. was
made for display. It met with unanimous
approval and authority was obtained for its
adoption for the next school year.
As designed, the uniform will consist of
a dark blue, straight front, single breasted
sack coat with four black composition hut-


227
tons. The two breast pockets and two side
pockets will be provided with flaps with
black composition buttons, and the lapels
will both have button holes, in which may
be worn R. O. T. C. and M. buttons. On
the left sleeve a shield carrying the let-
ters "U. S. R. O. T. C." will be embroid-
ered with silk thread of the color of the
proper branch of service. The trousers, al-
so in dark blue, will be without stripes or
other distinctive marks. The cap will be
based on the overseas or trench cap and
will have piping either in maize or in the
proper service color.
The uniform will cost less than the
amount allowed by the Government for its
purchase and a small sum will be available
for repairs and cleaning. Wearing of these
uniforms will be required only when un-
der military instruction.
PRODUCTION METHODS IN SHOPS
ARE IN SWING
Every production man appreciates that
team play is one of the main essentials in
getting results. Without this, some of the
operations will have to stop for lack of ma-
terial in the proper stage of development.
In the Engineering Shops not only must
the usual difficulty of routing the stock be
handled but the student also must be rout-
ed. At first only a few students, at the
same time, could be put on production.
The early operations had to run first to
build up stock all along the line. At pres-
ent fourteen operations have been stand-
ardized and by February workable reser-
voirs of stock will have been built up in
all stages of development and all opera-
tions established. This will enable a sys-
tematic schedule to be arranged for all stu-
dents.
There will be thirty different jobs run-
ning simultaneously during each period and
each with a new operator.
In order to give instruction more effi-
ciently in Shop 4, all sections will meet for
class room instruction at the same hour
each week.
Two designs of spring spreaders are be-
ing made. Over one thousand of the sim-
pler design have been completed and de-
livered. Of these, only the forgings were
machined as the purchaser has 12,000
screws on hand. This has been an ad-
vantage as it enabled us to get into pro-
duction by easy steps. The complete arti-
cle will be produced in the second semes-
ter.
To give training in production problems
from an administrative standpoint, stu-
dents electing Shop 4a will be put in
charge of six operations. Each student
will be required to keep these running,
clearing away petty obstacles that arise all
the time in the best regulated shops. These
obstacles might be tool trouble, stock trou-
ble, gauge trouble, machine trouble or op-
erator clumsiness. The student will be ro-
tated, taking a different set of operations,
until he has covered the whole.
Interesting comparative statistical stud-
ies will be made of these different squads.
The same will be done of the different sec-
tions.
SHOPS CO-OPERATE WITH
INDUSTRY
Under the supervision of Prof. John
Airey, a series of experiments are being
conducted in the Engineering Shops for
the purpose of studying the underlying
principles in the action of milling cut-
ters.
This research is being carried out by
means of a special machine, which gives a
graphical record of each cut taken. The
apparatus employs a tuning fork which
traces a series of waves on a strip of
smoked paper, during the time that a chip
is being cut. By means of this arrange-
ment, an accurate record of the process is
obtained, although the entire period of cut-
ting is only a fraction of a second. The
smoked record papers are analyzed to de-
termine the forces which act and the pow-
er consumed in taking a cut.
In the initial tests, a single-toothed tool
has been used, the shape of the tooth, the
feed and the other factors being varied so
that the fundamental principles involved
in milling action could be studied. In a


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
later series of experiments, it is expected
that standard types of milling cutters will
be used, having teeth around their entire
peripherics. The results will form a check
on the theoretical observations made in
the first series of experiments, and, in ad-
dition, will throw light on the practical
problems of milling.
This research is in accord with the pol-
icy of the Engineering College to bring
ADDITION IS MADE TO FOUNDRY
EQUIPMENT
A machine of very practical value has
just been added to the foundry of the En-
gineering Shops.
In the power plant Wickes' boilers are
used, in which 600 pairs of grates are em-
ployed. These bars are continually in mo-
tion, reciprocating through a distance of
from one to one and one-half inches in
Moulding Machine Used in the Engineering Shops to Moid the Grate Bars Used

about a closer co-operation of the Univer-
sity with industry. The milling cutter ex-
periments are being conducted at the re-
quest of, and in conjunction with, the Na-
tional Twist Drill Company of Detroit,
which has established the National Small
Tools Fellowships for the purpose of
bringing the design and testing of small
tools within the realm of scientific re-
search. There are two of these fellow-
ships. One of them is held by Ingle B.
Whinery, '21E, for the year 1920-21, while
the other is still vacant.
order to clear the ashes from the fire. If
these bars are not straight, they will not
function properly. Since they are ex-
tremely thin in proportion to their height,
it is impossible to mold them in the usual
manner on the floor. This would result in
too many being rejected for crookedness.
The power plant uses from three hundred
to six hundred pairs per year, depending on
the quality of coal burned, the bars of
course burning out with time. This has
involved an expenditure of $1,500 to
$3,000 a year.


229
To reduce this expense, Mr. J. R. Hast-
ings, the instructor in foundry work, de-
signed a molding machine, which was con-
structed in the Engineering Shops.
The machine works quite satisfactorily
and will be used as a part of the regular
foundry course, each student being re-
quired to make at least one pair of grate
bars. He thereby gets a little experience
in operating a molding machine.
The above addition to the foundry
equipment will not only give more varied
instruction to the student, but also will
give him the satisfaction of knowing that
he is making something that the Univer-
sity needs.
PHYSICS DEPARTMENT DOES HIGH
TEMPERATURE WORK
. A very interesting piece of research
work, one which may lead to great discov-
eries, is being carried on now by Mr.
Paton and Mr. Becker of the Physics De-
partment. Mr. Paton describes their work
as follows:
"To the beginner the subject of Physics
seems all too often but a stumbling block,
hindering his progress toward a chosen
profession. But to those interested, it
presents many interesting possibilities. So
many are the questions presenting them-
selves for solution to the physicist, that
he must always pick and choose the ones
promising to be of the greatest signifi-
cance and interest. One will usually find
him striving, therefore, to study the uni-
verse about him under extreme condi-
tions.
"One of the most interesting problems
recently undertaken, in the Physics De-
partment of this University, is what
amounts to the study of the spectra of
some of the elements at very high tem-
peratures. By using the electric furnace,
temperatures approximating 50000 C. have
been previously attained. Astronomers
tell us that the temperature of the sun
is about 2000° C. higher than this. A
means of producing temperatures of over
20,000° C. has been discovered by Ander-
son, working at Mt. Wilson observatory.
Conditions which could never before be
even vaguely approached are now made
possible.
"Briefly, the process is this: A large
condenser is charged to a very high volt-
age, say 50000 volts. In this condition
it may readily be shown to contain an
equivalent of some forty calories of elec-
trical energy, not a very large amount.
Nevertheless, by discharging the condens-
er through a short piece of very fine wire,
all this energy is dissipated in that wire
in less than a hundred thousandth of a
second, resulting in an extremely violent
explosion of the wire. A flash of much
greater brilliancy than the light of the
sun is obtained and may be photographed.
If the available energy all went to heat
the wire, temperatures of the order of
magnitude of 100,000° C. might be expect-
ed. But a great deal of the energy is used
up in blowing apart the molecules of the
wire. The very brilliancy of the flash,
however, leaves no doubt that the result-
ing temperatures are well over 20,000° C.
It is extremely difficult to picture such
temperatures. We may note that simply
we have here conditions similar to those
in the brightest stars. An attempt is be-
ing made to photograph the spectra of sev-
eral elements under these conditions in or-
der to compare them with those obtained
from the stars.
"A similar investigation, being carried
on in connection with that of the exploded
wire, is the study of the spectrum of an
electric spark discharge between electrodes
very close together, when placed in the
highest vacuum obtainable by modern
methods. Here again large quantities of
energy are dissipated in a restricted re-
gion in a very minute interval of time.
"Under such extreme conditions, it is
hoped that much new and valuable infor-
mation will be obtained, both with regard
to conditions on the stars and also con-
cerning the ultimate construction of the
elements themselves."


THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
ELECTRICAL DEPARTMENT
OFFERS NEW COURSES
A new course, known as Course E. E.
9, is being given in the Electrical Engi-
neering Department. The work given is in
the nature of research work, but the stu-
dents taking the work are not thrown
entirely upon theif own initiative, but the
work, to a certain extent, is under the di-
rection of the members of the electrical
staff. It is felt that in the case of the
under-graduates at least, more effective
work can be accomplished in this way
than would be the case if the students were
thrown entirely upon their own resources.
In some respects, this course is an intro-
duction to Course 18, in which the stu-
dent is expected very largely to plan his
own research.
At present, two investigations are under
way. First, to determine the iron loss in
induction motors as affected by the pressure
upon the laminations, and second, an in-
vestigation of watt hour meters.
Two years ago the Lalley Light Corpo-
ration of Detroit installed a model "F"
Lalley Light plant in the Electrical Engi-
neering Laboratory. They have developed
a new outfit known as the model "H"
plant and have replaced the old model
"F" plant with one of these new models.

LARGE TRANSFORMERS ARE INSTALLED
Four of the largest transformers in the world were recently installed in the new
plant of the Duquesne Light Company at Colfax, Pa.
Each of the transformer tanks has a diameter of nearly 10 feet and is approxi-
mately 16 feet high. Each transformer weighs 63 tons when filled with oil. Over
18 tons of oil is required to fill it.
The four transformers required some 14 miles of copper wire for the windings
and 82 tons of the sheet steel for the magnetic circuit. Almost two miles of seamless
copper tubing are required in the cooling systems of the four units.
The transformers will step up the output of 70,000 kva. from 11,500 volts to
66,000 volts.
The transformers were designed and built by the Westinghouse Electric Company
at their East Pittsburg works.

QUESTIONABLE FRIENDS-
One who gives you the last dance on a
twenty dance program.
One who drops in your room about twelve
bells and tells you in minute detail
everything he knows and a good deal
he doesn't know.
One who lends you a ten spot and actually
expects it back the next week.
One who asks you over for a socfal game
and takes away every cent you have.
One who asks you over to have a drink

Excerpt from a frosh's theme in Rhetor-
ic i, entitled "The Function of the Uni-
versity Student: A student should above
all be friendly with his instructors and all
others of questionable character."
Senior Advisor: Your father will be
greatly shocked when the Dean sends him
the results of your examinations.
Frosh: Oh, no, he won't, because I
wired him my grades last night.
Sweet young thing: What did you say
your occupation was?
Stalwart young man (proudly): I pur-
sue the engineering profession.
S. Y. T: Well, you'll have to show
more speed than you have lately around
here if you ever expect to keep up with it.
Doctor May (examining frosh): You
have a very irregular heart. Do you drink
much coffee?
Frosh: About four saucerfuls a day.
Doc May: But why don't you drink it
out of the cup?
Frosh: The spoon gets in my eyes.
The following reason was given in a
thtme for the cause of the large influx of
students to the universities in recent years:
A man used to be able to travel to obtain
a liberal education, but with the present
high railroad rates, he is obliged to attend
the university.
A student at Camp Davis was shooting
Polaris one evening, when a visitor hap-
pened to be nearby. Just then a star fell,
when the visitor remarked surprisedly,
"Those boys are surely getting to be good
shots."
Did you ever notice that the diagonal
walk is still as straight from the Arch to
the Law Building as ever, but as crooked
as ever when it hits the Law Building.
The following is told on one of the shin-
ing lights of '24. The frosh turned in a
theme, and in three days it was returned
to him with the grade "E". The freshman
immediately went to his instructor, and the
following ensued:
Student: Professor , you re-
turned my theme to me with the grade
"E", but you had never read it all, as I
had pasted pages five, six, and seven to-
gether, and they were not touched. I
should like to ask that" you reread it and
give me a different grade.
Professor (sadly): My boy, do you
have to eat a whole egg to know when it
is bad

Cross Section Showing Murphy Furnace Construction
The Murphy Furnace is the pioneer among stokers. It is one o£ the
oldest—and one of the best; 44 years of successful operation—and still going
strong. Remember that during that time a great many manufacturers have
sprung up and died. Time tells—the principle must be sound—the operation
successful.

What Is Vacuum?
IF THE traffic policeman did not hold up his hand and control the
automobiles and wagons and people there would be collisions,
confusion, and but little progress in any direction. His business
is to direct.
The physicist who tries to obtain a vacuum that is nearly perfect
has a problem somewhat like that of the traffic policeman. Air is
composed of molecules—billions and billions of them flying about in
all directions and often colliding. The physicist's pump is designed
to make the molecules travel in one direction—out through the
exhaust. The molecules are much too small to be seen even with a
microscope, but the pump jogs them along and at least starts them in
the right direction.
A perfect vacuum would be one in which there is not a single free
molecule.
For over forty years scientists have been trying to pump and jog
and herd more molecules out of vessels. There are still in the best
vacuum obtainable more molecules per cubic centimeter than there
are people in the world, in other words, about two billion. Whenever
a new jogging device is invented, it becomes possible to eject a few
million more molecules.
The Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company have
spent years in trying to drive more and more molecules of air from
containers. The chief purpose has been to study the effects obtained,
as, for example, the boiling away of metals in a vacuum.
This investigation of high vacua had unexpected results. It became
possible to make better X-ray tubes — better because the X-rays
could be. con trolled; to make the electron tubes now so essential in
long-range wireless communication more efficient and trustworthy;
and to develop an entirely new type of incandescent lamp, one which
is tilled with a gas and which gives more light than any of the
older lamps.
No one can foretell what will be the outcome of research in pure
science. New knowledge, new ideas inevitably are gained. And
sooner or later this new knowledge, these new ideas find a practical
application. For this reason the primary purpose of the Research
Laboratories of the General Electric Company is the broadening of
human knowledge.
