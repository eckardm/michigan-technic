Before Nature's disguise of artless
simplicity can be stripped away and
the true beauty of her form revealed
two things are necessary. The first is
rigorous scientific and mathematical
accuracy. The second is an adequate
simile in which to clothe it. Granted
these—the exact and the inspired—
and very often even the commonest
scientific facts take on an awesomeness
such as one feels while gazing over
the rim of the Grand Canyon. Such
vistas we never forget.
Emphatically within this category of
breathless marvels comes the simple
fact of the number of atoms in a sin-
gle cubic inch of dry air at stand-
ard temperature and pressure. Even
learned scientists, after calculating it,
have seldom the vaguest notion of
what really it means. Often are they
simply incredulous when the true pic-
ture is revealed to them. That true
picture we shall develop here.
By scientific convention gases are
commonly reduced to a standard set of
conditions. These are: (1) dry; (2)
temperature of 0° Centigrade; (3)
pressure of 760 millimeters of pure
Mercury (Hg) in a barometric column
at 0°C. and normal gravity. Zero de-
grees Centigrade is of course the same
as 32° Fahrenheit, the melting-point
of ice at normal atmospheric pressure.
A pressure of 760 mm. of Hg is the
same as the 14.696 lbs. per square inch
which the engineer takes as his stand-
ard atmospheric pressure. Because sci-
entists understand what these standard
conditions are, instead of specifying

Czar J. Dyer
them each time mention is made of
them, they are curtly abbreviated to
"S.T.P.", which we adopt here.
Gases are ordinarily compared dry
because bone-dryness is both easily cal-
culated for and easily achieved physi-
cally; because physical properties are
then constant and readily reproduci-
ble; and because water vapor would be
a widely varying constituent if allowed
to be. However, at S.T.P. for air,
water has a vapor pressure of only
4.57 mm. of Hg when in contact with
ice at 0°C, so that whether water va-
por is present or whether its partial
pressure is replaced by an equal par-
tial pressure of air molecules makes
practically no difference to the substan-
tial truth of our picture. Thus, our
picture will be substantially correct if
we keep in mind just ordinary sea-

level air on a day when ice is just be-
ginning to melt.
The gases of which dry air is com-
posed have the following properties
which are of interest to us: (see
table I).
When the total of the last column,
which is the sum of the volume of the
several gases each weighted for the
number of atoms in each one of its
molecules, is divided by the total of the
column next to it, it is found that the
average air molecule contains 1.99088
atoms.
Be it clearly understood that this
figure of 1.99088 atoms per molecule
is a purely fictitious one, a mere math-
ematical average. As a matter of actual
chemistry, every air molecule must
necessarily contain some small exact
number of atoms, such as the one atom
in each molecule of the inert gases Ar-
gon, Neon, and Helium; or the two
atoms in each molecule of Nitrogen,
Oxygen, and Hydrogen; or the three
atoms (one of Carbon and two of
Oxygen) in each molecule of Carbon
Dioxide, CO„
The Mean Physical Molecular
Weight given for each gas is quite ac-
curate. Each was calculated by using
the latest Physical Atomic Weight of
each isotope of each element present,
weighting for relative isotopic abun-
dance in Nature, and finally for the
number of atoms in each molecule.
The final weighted mean (28.97419
Physical) was then obtained by weigh-
ing for percentage by volume of each
kind of gas.

Prior to a decade or so ago, the
daylighting of building interiors was
accomplished almost entirely through
the use of non-functional light-trans-
mitting materials. The materials were
non-functional in that they did not
specifically control the direction or the
amount of the incoming light. The dis-
advantages of such natural illumina-
tion arrangements for interiors are
well known. The amount of light inci-
dent on an exterior vertical surface
from sun and sky varies considerably
over a period of one clay or one year.
Without fenestration control of the
transmitted light, this same undesir-
able variation occurs in the interior
illumination. Also, most of the light
entering a room is first incident on the
floor where a very large percentage of
it is likely to be absorbed, and since
the light passes through the fenestra-
tion in downward directions, the room
occupant is frequently subjected to
glare of the fenestration, of the light
source beyond, or of some surface
within the room.
Before 1937, the Owens-Ilinois
Glass Company had become interested
in the development of a fenestration
material that would redirect the light
during transmission in such a way that
the interior illumination would be im-
proved. The use of a glass block for
this purpose was promising in that
by

four faces were available for the in-
corporation of designs for redirecting
the transmitted light instead of two
faces as is the case with a single sheet
of glass. During 1937, Owens-Illinois
started to manufacture a prismatic
glass block. The prisms were pressed
into the two inside faces where, since
they were in a sealed cavity, they could
not collect dust and dirt. The purpose
of the block was to transmit a major
portion of the light into a room in up-
ward directions, thereby providing il-
lumination with light scattered from
the ceiling and walls. At the same time,
since far less light entered the room
in downward directions, the probability
of glare would be greatly lessened.
Many installations of these blocks
were made and their functioning ob-
served over periods of time involving a
large variety of exterior illumination
conditions. The general conclusion was
that the use of a light-directional glass
block for the natural illumination of
interiors had considerable merit.
In 1940, Owens-Illinois sponsored a
program at the University of Michi-
gan, through the Department of Engi-
neering Research, for the purpose of
establishing a special illumination lab-
oratory and the conduction of a series
of light studies. This program was to
include a complete investigation of the
natural illumination of interiors and a
consideration of the glass block then
being manufactured with a view to
their improvement. The work was
started with a study of the literature
on natural illumination, the amount
available in accordance with meteor-
ological data, the methods of transmis-
sion and control then being employed,
and the measuring instruments then
in use.
One of the first practices noted was
the almost universal acceptance of in-
tensity as a measure of adequacy when
considering daylight illumination. The
establishment of a certain minimum
number of foot-candles of illumination
was the only requirement set forth in
most lighting codes. In an attempt to
assure this minimum, the fenestration
areas were specified as a more or less

Harvard B. Vincent
fixed percentage of the floor area. The
lighting codes had little or nothing to
say about the distribution of illumina-
tion in a room or the elimination of
high brightness ratios for the occu-
pants.
The prevalent use of various shad-
ing devices for the reduction of high
brightness or direct sunlight was also
noted. Most of the devices that lower
source brightness also lower the light
on the task, frequently to the extent
that supplementary artificial lighting is
required. The manipulation of shades
is generally a manual process and
therefore uncertain to the extent that
they are often left in a permanent
shading position, or are inadequately
operated when in use. Also, in shading
the upper portion of a fenestration,
light from the region that is most ef-
fective in illuminating the more remote
portion of a room is eliminated.
These facts and observations, cou-
pled with the experience that Owens-
Illinois had acquired through the in-
stallations of their prismatic block, in-
dicated that there was definite merit
in the use of a light-directional glass
block in fenestration, and that an im-
proved prismatic block should be de-
veloped that would function properly
for all exterior illumination conditions.
The laboratory was equipped with
an artificial sun and artificial sky in

tensities could be adequately controlled.
These distributions and intensities
correlated with meteorological data for
different latitudes and different
weather conditions as published by the
United States Weather Bureau. Meth-
ods of measurement of transmitted
light and block brightness were devel-
oped and the necessary equipment de-
signed and constructed. Several years'
work was involved in the assembly and
correlation of data, and in the prac-
tical application of these data to block-
design and to the proper use of block
in buildings.
The prismatic design that resulted
from this initial work is now incor-
porated in the Owens-Illinois Insulux
glass block No. 351. The block was
designed for use above eye level, arbi-
trarily established at about six feet.
One outstanding feature of the block-
is that under direct sunlight it always
transmits an intense beam of light in
an upward direction, the direction of
this up-beam being between 5° and
30° altitude for all possible sun posi-
tions. This feature makes the block
very effective in projecting light into
the more remote portions of a room.
For every possible exterior illumina-
tion condition, a large percentage of
the light transmitted by the block is
projected into the upper quarter
sphere, that is, the region above a
horizontal plane passing through the
center of the block. For example, this
percentage is 61 when the block is
lighted by an overcast sky, and 67
when it is exposed to the sun, having
a position of 30° altitude and 0° azi-
muth with respect to the block. Such
figures are to be contrasted with ap-
proximately 10 per cent for many non-
functional fenestration materials.
The light that the block transmits in
downward directions is well diffused
and the block brightness for these di-
rections is not excessive even for the
most adverse sun positions. Along the
periphery of a glass block for a width
corresponding to the thickness of the
sidewall, there is a region that has only
two air-glass surfaces. This region, on
some block, under sun exposure, pro-
vides a direct channel for light trans-
mission and therefore a source of high
brightness. This difficulty does not
exist in the No. 351 block due to the
incorporation of a prismatic design on
the border that reflects and scatters
the light that enters the channel.
The percentage transmission of light
for a No. 351 block panel is relatively
low when the sun is nearly directly in
front of it giving a high exterior illu-
mination. As the sun increases in alti-
tude and the exterior illumination de-
creases, the panel transmits a larger
percentage of the light, thus keeping
the amount of transmitted light fairly
constant. This being true for a rather
wide range of sun positions tends to
equalize the interior illumination.
As was previously indicated, this
block was designed for use above eye
level. The region below a No. 351 glass
block panel, the lower portion of a
fenestration, can be either a vision
panel of flat glass or another type of
light-directional block (Owens-Illinois
Insulux glass block No. 350), a block-
having low surface brightness designed
for use on sun exposure above or be-
low eye level. The choice here depends
on the dictates of the possible occu-
pancy or on the need of a means of
ventilation. If the vision panel is se-
lected, then on sun exposure, shades
usually are needed to keep direct sun-
light from desks or working surfaces
near the fenestration. This may appear
to be retrogression, but it is not an
important one since the lower portion
of the fenestration is not very effective
anyway in lighting the remote parts of
a room, and the block panel is left un-
shaded to transmit light with full ef-
ficiency.
The Owens-Illinois Glass Company,
as well as many others, have been very
much interested in recent years in the
improvement of the natural illumina-
tion of school classrooms. This interest
on the part of Owens-Illinois, and the
collection of data for the light-direc-
tional glass block, has resulted in the
publication of a booklet, "Daylight in
School Classrooms," by Hugh Paul,
Manager, Insulux Products Division,
Owens-Illinois Glass Company, in
which certain recommendations are
made for the improvement of the
natural illumination of schoolrooms
through the use of No. 351 block.
The material that is to be presented
from this booklet pertains to a typical
classroom. This classroom is 32 feet
long, 24 feet wide, and has a 12-foot
ceiling. The fenestration extends the
full length of a 32-foot side and con-
sists of 30 inches of vision strip above
a 42-inch sill, and then six feet of
No. 351 glass block.
The distributions of daylight in this
room for two exterior illumination
conditions are given by Figures 1 and
2. For Figure 1, the exterior vertical
surface illumination is 1,000 foot-can-
dles due to an overcast sky, and for
Figure 2, it is 7,640 foot-candles due
to a clear sky and sun, the sun having
a position of 50° altitude and 0° azi-
muth with respect to the fenestration
and a normal sun intensity of 9,600

Since 1929, Camp Davis has been
located near the Teton mountains of
Wyoming, 75 miles south of Yellow-
stone National Park. The pioneering
spirit of the Engineering College's first
surveying camp still prevails, making
the 1700-mile summer jaunt invaluable
from both an academic and practical
viewpoint.
In 1873 the first surveying class was
held in Ann Arbor by Professors Da-
vis and Greene. The need for more
space in which to conduct this type of
work was immediately apparent and
the following summer a camp was
opened at nearby Whitmore Lake. Va-
rious sites were occupied by the camp
in the ensuing years.
Whitmore Lake was abandoned in
favor of land near the Old Mission,
northeast of Traverse City. Subse-
quently, the site was moved to Doug-
las Lake and Camp Davis was located
there until 1929.
In the continual search for a better
location, a list of specifications for the
ideal camp was accumulated. As trans-
portation facilities developed the loca-

Leroy R. Weinstein
tion of the camp was no longer limited
to the midwest; and in 1928 the de-
cision of an investigating party, con-
sisting of four faculty members from
the University, to locate Cam]) Davis
in the Hoback Valley of Wyoming
was made. This location complied with
the specifications desired to the last
detail and in the following year, 1929,

the camp was in operation.
Each summer plans for the trip west
are made and a special registration is
held for those students desirous of at-
tending the camp. An informal get-
together of surveying faculty and stu-
dents is held for discussing the details
of transportation and for drawing up
the necessary itinerary for the camp.
On approaching Camp Davis from the
main highway the first sight that comes
to the eye is a group of carefully-
placed huts shining brightly in the sun
and located across the Hoback River.
A winding road soon takes you past
the attractive sign, announcing Camp
Davis as the Rocky Mountain Field
Station of the University of Michi-
gan, and leads into the camp itself.
Arrival at camp is planned on Sun-
day so a day can be spent getting ac-
quainted with the new surroundings
and the real western cooking of Grant
Thompson, an expert with flapjacks.
During the first week of activity
much preliminary work is done. Par-
ties of four students each are chosen
and bench mark elevations for future
reference are established by differen-
tial leveling.
With bench mark elevations ascer-
tained, topographical work can begin.
Two or three of the 40-acre sections
are mapped by each party so at the end
of the summer a map of the entire
camp can be assembled.
During the first five weeks several
evenings are set aside to the study of
astronomy in order to lay a sound
foundation for computation of solar
and stellar observations. The theoreti-
cal work is concluded with the "shoot-
ing" of the sun by sextant. These ob-
servations are used in computing time,
latitude, and longitude.
One of the larger projects for the
summer is the highway location prob-
lem. Specifications as to vertical and
horizontal curves, as well as maximum
allowable grades, are decided upon by
the faculty. The value of the early
work at the camp becomes apparent
during this project because a topo-
graphical map is required in the loca-
tion work. The map is made of the
area around a tentative location. In the
12

is the willing victim
office, cut and fill are computed and
the location worked out among the
students of each party. The office work
is then translated to the terrain as a
final location is staked out. The Ho-
hack river affords one of the main
problems in the location of the high-
way and the method of triangulation is
used to compute the distance across the
river.
The methods of the United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey serve as
models for the triangulation network
problems done at Camp Davis. The
camp network has been tied into the
USGS's triangulation system and this
serves as a check on the precision of
the work done each summer. Direc-
tion theodolites and transits are used
for the angular measurements in-
volved. The base line of the network
is made with an invar tape, corrections
being made to compensate for the ef-
fects of slope, tension, temperature,
and alignment. While this particular
phase of the work is not of great value
to the land or industrial surveyors, it
serves as an introduction to the prob-
lems confronted by the United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey and as an
invitation to those students interested
in going further into the study of
geodesy.
Precision work is demanded in the
accurate determination of bench mark
elevations. For this work a precise
level is used. The precise level has a
much higher magnification than an or-
dinary level. This, together with its
highly sensitive leveling bubbles,
makes precision work possible.
Land survey problems are brought
up during camp. Existing section lines
and land boundaries are relocated by
each party. A chance to become ac-
quainted with subdivision work is af-
forded in the last week as each party
is given the problem of staking out a
street and a few buildings
A day is always set aside for the
painstaking but interesting job of ad-
justing the instruments.
Before returning to Ann Arbor, the
students hold another informal gath-
ering for purposes of planning a re-
turn route that will include all the
scenic highlights missed on the way
out. Yellowstone Park. Mt. Rushmore.
Buffalo Bill Dam. and Devil's Tower
are but a few of the many interesting
sights visited.
Camp Davis will have to accommo-
date many more students next sum-
mer than it has done in the past, and
an enlargement of its facilities will be
necessary. This expansion is needed
because of a very recent change in the
engineering curriculum, which now re-
quires that all civil engineering stu-
dents spend one summer at Camp
Davis.
The customary eight weeks' study
of practical surveying and allied sub-
jects, which carry altogether eight
credit-hours, will be divided into two
periods of four weeks each. One of
these periods will be devoted to sur-
veying; the other, to geology. The lat-
ter period of training would take the
place of the regular four-hour course
in geology offered at the University
of Michigan.

In the past, students from schools
other than Michigan have attended
Camp Davis. Engineers from LaFay-
ette College in Pennsylvania left their
mark with the creation of Bench Mark
LaFayette near the center of camp.
With the expansion program under-
way the camp is still expected to be
able to accommodate a few students
from other schools. Provision is also
being made at the camp for those
electing more advanced work in ge-
ology and surveying.
The camp is ideally situated for
studying geology. The Snake River
Valley and the Gros Ventre Slide are
two of the more important geological
phenomena within one-half day's ride
from the camp. Jenny Lake and the
famous Grand Teton Mountain are
also of special interest to the students.
For many years advanced students
of geology have used Camp Davis as a
base of operations. The integration of
practical field work in geology with
that of surveying should make future
sessions at camp very interesting and
worthwhile.
Once the summer is completed the
students realize that they "should be
capable of serving as an instrument
man on almost any class of work, with
credit to themselves and their instruc-
tors."1

At its first meeting of the fall semes-
ter of the 1947-48 school year, the stu-
dent chapter of the American Insti-
tute of Chemical Engineers heard Pro-
fessor G. G. Brown, chairman of the
Department of Chemical and Metallur-
gical Engineering, speak on the more
practical phases of engineering educa-
tion. Preceding Professor Brown's
speech, officers were elected, including
Samuel Eubank as president, David
Cornell as first vice-president, David
Inglis as second vice-president, Joan
Crishal as secretary, and William Shel-
ley as treasurer.
In addition to the election of offi-
cers, other business transacted included
announcement of plans for the na-
tional AIChE convention to be held in
Detroit in November, and the enroll-
ing of new members of the organiza-
tion.
Eta Kappa Nu
The Beta Epsilon Chapter of Eta
Kappa Nu, National Electrical Honor
Society, was reactivated on the Uni-
versity campus last spring by George
Osipoff, George Adomian, Frank
Arams, Bob Miller, Tom Stout, Ber-
nard Arfin, John Jans, John Artley,
and Bill McBee.
New initiates last spring were: Rob-
ert P. Alley, William Aylward, Wal-
ter Bergner, William Campbell, Or-
ville Greunke, Ralph Hamilton, Ernest
Harper, Roger Hotte, Fredrick Kal-
mus, Robert C. Lee, Lawrence Lutz-
ker, Robert McVean, Leland Pickett,
Donald Sagaser, Charles Schoendube,
Charles Sharpe, William Sherwood,
Russell Shields, Eugene Sikorovsky,
William Wheatley, Bernard Wilter-
dink, and Jack Zuiderveld.
At the last meeting of the 1946-47
year, elections were held. The new
officers are: Ernest Harper, President;
Bernard Wilterdink, Vice-President;
Walter Bergner, Secretary-Treasurer;
Leland Pickett, Engineering Council
Representative.

The organization is well under way
this term and is planning many activi-
ties, the most important of which will
be an extensive field trip planned for
the spring vacation. Plans call for a
visit to several electrical industries in
some of the large Eastern cities. The
trip will be sponsored in conjunction
with the student branch of the AIEE.
AIEE
An interesting, informative, and en-
tertaining program is planned for elec-
tricals this year by the University of
Michigan Branch of the American In-
stitute of Electrical Engineers — Insti-
tute of Radio Engineers. Monthly
meetings will feature talks by noted en-
gineers along with movies and discus-
sions on various phases of electronics
and power engineering. Refreshments
will be served.
A field trip to a television station
and one to a power generating station
are scheduled. Local membership (one
dollar per year) permits participation
in all such events. Members will be in-
vited to present technical papers and
to try for the substantial cash prize
which will be awarded for the best
work.
Membership in either or both of the
two national organizations, AIEE and
IRE, may be secured through the Uni-
versity of Michigan student branch.
Sigma Rho Tau
Sigma Rho Tau, engineering stu-
dents' speech society, opened its ac-
tivities for the year with an all-
engineering smoker, held October 7 at
the Michigan Union. A large turnout
hailed the event as a big success. Dean
Crawford was the distinguished in-
terlocutor, pointing his questions to
the main speaker of the evening, Pro-
fessor James K. Pollock, Chairman of
the Department of Political Science.
Professor Pollock's address was en-
titled "The Big Power Stalemate in
Germany." Dr. Pollock has had wide
experience in the economic readjust-
ment of the United States Occupation
Zone in Germany. Since the close of
the War, Dr. Pollock has contributed
much to the solution of the myriad of
problems arising out of the occupa-
tion. All who attended the smoker
were enlightened as to the scope of
these problems. It is hoped that future
meetings of this sort can be organized.
President of Sigma Rho Tau, Ken
Allison, addressed the engineers and
announced plans for the coming year.
Extensive intercollegiate debating is
planned and many opportunities for
excellent speech training are open to
all interested engineering students,
architects, and technologists.
Officers for the year are: Ken Alli-
son, President; Jack Holt and Karl
Henion, Vice-Presidents; Clinton
Booth, Treasurer; Quentin VanderT
voort and June Pask, Secretaries.
Pi Tau Pi Sigma
The local Chapter of Pi Tau Pi
Sigma, National Honorary Signal
Corps Fraternity, was elected National
Headquarters for the organization for
the coming year at a meeting held at
Ft. Riley, Kansas, during ROTC sum-
mer camp this year. The organization
appears on any campus where Signal
Corps ROTC is given and each year a
different chapter is designated Na-
tional Headquarters. Since the Uni-
versity of Michigan Chapter has been
the most active in getting the national
organization reactivated, they were
given the honor of being the first post-
war National Headquarters.
The purpose of the organization is
to foster the spirit and interest of
national preparedness, to improve
the esprit-de-corps of the University
ROTC unit, and to establish a means
whereby university students may be-
come familiar with the various aspects
of signal communication. This work
thus far, has included the setting up
of a code practice room and a photo-
graphic darkroom in West Engineer-
ing Annex.
The local officers act as the National
Council and are responsible for the
efficient functioning of the local as well
as the National Headquarters. The
present officers are: Gerard H. Gicz-
ewski, 49E. National Commander;
Leo H. Laakso, 49E, Executive Offi-
cer; Ralph Schroeder. 48E, Adjutant;
and Edward Crovella, 49E, Finance
Officer. Major Howard E. Porter, Sig-
nal Corps Assistant Professor of Mili-
tary Science and Tactics, is the
faculty adviser.

WS
Frank E. Carlson, '25E
As illuminating engineer for the
lamp department of the General Elec-
tric Company, Frank E. Carlson is in
charge of application engineering in-
volving use of light and related radi-
ation to all forms of photographic
processes, television, and picture pro-
jection.
Upon graduation from the Univer-
sity of Michigan in 1925, Mr. Carlson
was employed as a junior engineer in
the lamp department of the Michigan
District of the General Electric Com-
pany. Most of his professional expe-
rience has been with that firm, except
for a year spent in Detroit as engineer
at the Willey Sign Company.
During the war, he acted as a con-
sultant to various government agen-
cies and manufacturers of military
equipment. As a consultant Mr. Carl-
son spent considerable time working
on optical control of radiant energy,
flash tube development for aerial re-
connaissance, and ballistics.
Mr. Carlson has written many tech-
nical papers on optics. Among his
more prominent ones are "The Light
Source Requirements for Picture Pro-
jection," "Properties of Lamps and
Optical Systems for Sound Repro-
duction," and "Characteristics and Ap-
plications of Flash Tubes." Most of
these papers have been published in
the journals of the Society of Motion

Jerry M. Gruitch, '33E
Jerry M. Gruitch began his career
in the days when engineers were not
too well off. Since then he has risen,
through the ups and downs of world
economic conditions, to assistant chief
engineer at the Dodge Division of
Chrysler Corporation.
Mr. Gruitch began his work as an
apprentice tool maker at the Ford Mo-
tor Company in 1921. After four years
he turned his thoughts to furthering
his education and enrolled at the Uni-
versity of Michigan. In 1933 he re-
ceived a B.S. degree in the college of
engineering. Upon graduation he was
accepted by the Chrysler Corporation
as an experimental engineer. He
worked in the automotive labs, and
spent considerable time and effort in
the development and design of rear
axle drives and commercial air condi-
tioning units.
In 1937 Mr. Gruitch became chief
engineer at Airtemp division of Chrys-
ler Corporation, where he was respon-
sible for research and development of
heating and refrigeration units. Test-
ing of gas and oil burners, and large
commercial refrigeration units became
a daily routine.
During World War II, Mr. Gruitch
served in the capacity of Air Ordnance
Officer, in the office of the Chief
of Technical Development. Here he
worked on the development and per-
fection of ordnance material used by
the AAF. He later was named Air
Ordnance and Armament Officer to
General Doolittle's staff on Okinawa.
At present Mr. Gruitch is assistant
chief engineer at the Dodge Division
of Chrysler Corporation and is respon-
sible for the design and development
of power plants for Dodge cars.
Sobin Crocker, '15E
In 1915 Sabin Crocker was granted
the degree of Bachelor of Mechanical
Engineering by the University of
Michigan. Recognition of his excep-
tional abilities by the Detroit Edison
Company has placed him in his present
position of Senior Mechanical Engi-
neer in charge of the Mechanical sec-
tion of the Engineering Department.
Upon graduation from the Univer-
sity of Michigan, Mr. Crocker entered
the employ of the Detroit Edison
Company where he worked as a pip-
ing draftsman on power plant and cen-
tral-heating layouts. A year later he
was made assistant to the engineer in
charge of laboratory and field work
for the research department. The years
1917-1918 were spent with the U. S.
Naval Reserve Force and the Emer-
gency Fleet Corporation. In 1919 he
returned to the Detroit Edison Com-
pany and worked on special assign-
ments for the engineering research de-
partment, investigating the flexibility
of pipe bends. A year later he was
placed in charge of the piping division
where he designed, with the aid of an
engineering staff, power piping for the
Edison Company, substations, ware-
houses, and office buildings.
Since 1925 Mr. Crocker has been in
charge of the Mechanical Section of
the engineering division where he su-
pervises the economic studies and fun-
damental engineering planning for
steam projects of the Detroit Edison
Company. This work includes: esti-
mating value of fuel saving devices;
comparing types of auxiliary drives
and estimating auxiliary power re-
quirements; making heat balance and
combustion computations: developing
new methods such as the fusion weld-
ing of pipe joints; and interpreting
safety codes and regulations. In addi-
tion to the foregoing he acts as a con-
sultant for various company depart-
ments requiring engineering advice.
Mr. Crocker is a member of Tau
Beta Pi, American Society of Mechan-
ical Engineers, American Society of
Testing Materials, and Engineering
Society of Detroit. In these organi-
zations he has served on many occa-
sions as committee chairman.
Stewart Hulse, '25E
The Esso Laboratories, research di-
vision for the Standard Oil Company
has received its share of capable grad-
uates from the University of Michigan
College of Engineering. Among the
most prominent is Mr. Stewart Hulse
who received the degree of bachelor of
science in mechanical engineering in
1925. Upon graduation he joined the
Standard Oil Company of New Jer-
sey as a student engineer.
In 1934 with a varied background of
engineering practice he was trans-
ferred to the Standard Oil Develop-
ment Company as a fuels technologist.
One of his principal fields has been the
manufacture and the performance of
distillate residual fuels and the appli-
cation of these fuels to the equipment
such as home and industrial heating
units, stationary and marine power
plants, and automotive and marine
Diesel engines.
During the war Mr. Hulse worked
on research projects for the govern-
ment. Among these were the devel-
opment of the mechanical smoke gen-
erator and the flame thrower.

The Michigan Technic has con-
ducted a survey of the lighting condi-
tions of all important locations, other
than classrooms, where large numbers
of engineering students assemble every
day during the course of a school week.
Practically all the engineering libraries
and laboratories were visited during
the survey and comparative evaluations
of each of these places have been made
for light-meter readings. A comparison
of these readings enables one to draw
some conclusions about the overall
lighting situation in our engineering
college.
All readings were taken on October
4, 1947, which was a very bright and
clear day ; the time of day was between
10 a.m. and 12 a.m. A General Elec-
tric light meter which measures over-
bead light intensities in foot-candles was
used in recording data. Two sets of
three readings each were taken in each
laboratory. One set was taken with
the artificial lighting on and the sec-
ond set with artificial lighting off. The
first reading of each set was taken
nearest the windows, where sunlight
was brightest; the second reading was
recorded between the brightest and
darkest places of the room (according
to the intensity of the natural lighting
from outside) ; the third reading meas-
ured the intensity of the darkest part
of the room. Each set of readings was
taken in identically the same places as
were the first. Let it be emphasized
that wherever a reading was taken,
that spot was constantly being used by
the student. I f it were in a library,
then, the reading was taken at a study
table rather than between bookcases:
and in a laboratory the data was re-
corded in that spot where the student
spends a great deal of time working.
Many of the laboratories and li-
braries with poor lighting are looking
forward to the installation of fluores-
scent lighting. The people working in

this type of lighting are very well sat-
isfied. Examples of outstandingly ex-
cellent lighting is that of the West
Engineering Library. There, the fluor-
escent lights with diffusion gratings
light all parts of the room with a high
intensity of illumination, providing
the student with ideal conditions for
study during the day or night. The
East Engineering Library, on the other
hand, uses bulb lighting. While the
conditions there are not as bad as in
some of the other places visited, the
lighting is not anywhere near sufficient
for the many students using this im-
portant library.
One of the first laboratories visited
was the Physical Testing Laboratory
of the Engineering Mechanics De-
partment. This laboratory is probably
used by more departments than any
other engineering laboratory ; it is used
constantly by E. M. 2a classes. Yet.
here is a good example of very poor
lighting. The dozens of testing ma-
chines in this laboratory cover every
section of the room and the overhead
bulb lighting, each bulb operating on
200 watts, is very inadequate. Imme-
diately adjacent to this laboratory is a
machine shop. The laboratory machin-
ist. Milo Kaufman, uses fluorescent
lighting in his shop and the average
meter reading there is 100 foot-can-
dles; whereas, in the physical testing
laboratory the meter reads a very low
10 foot-candles in the brightest spot.
Yet, the fluorescent light operates on a
power of only 80 watts. Therefore,
for less than one-half the power of the
bulb lighting a fluorescent light pro-
vides ten times as much light as does
the bulb. It would seem that in this
case the University is even losing
money by using this poor method of
lighting.
Dr. Rote, Professor of Metal Proc-
cessing, was asked why his depart-
ment did not have night laboratory
work in Metal Processing 3. Owing to
the large numbers of students taking
this course, night work would take
care of those who were unable to
register for the day-time classes. Pro-

"moe"
"The winning of honor is but the
revealing of a man's virtue and worth!"
Thus, Francis Bacon puts into so few
words a thought worthy of everyone's
attention. Regardless of whatever is a
person's endeavor, if accomplishment
and industry and goodwill identify
him, his colleagues do inwardly ad-
mire him and they do exhibit this
admiration in various ostensible forms
of recognition.
Thus, has the University of Michi-
gan recognized in John H. Morrison
a perfect example of this type of man.
Anyone who knows Moe cannot help
but share this sentiment.
John was born some twenty-three
years ago in Denver, Colorado, where
he spent the earlier part of his life.
In 1936 he moved to Trenton, New
Jersey, which has been his permanent
residence, save for several sojourns,
including one with Uncle Sam.

John H. Morrison
At Trenton Central High School,
Moe began to mold his personality and
abilities, which, when he came to col-
lege, were to establish for him an en-
viable reputation. While in high school
John was very active in athletics, earn-
ing two letter awards in tennis and one
in track. To attest to his popularity
and his well-rounded high school ca-
reer he won the American Legion
award for the most outstanding man of
the year at Central.
In June, 1942, he enrolled in the
Engineering College, entering the 16-
week summer session. His outstanding
scholarship earned him a place in Phi
Eta Sigma, freshman honorary society.
However, in June, 1943, John went
into the Infantry, and served with the
84th Infantry Division, which in the
European Theater of Operations was
part of General Simpson's Army.
March, 1946. found Moe back at
the ole red-brick schoolhouse (West
Engineering), starting in again where
he had left off. The lapse of several
years had little effect on his school-
work. For the last two semesters he
has maintained a gradepoint of 4.0 in
his mechanical engineering studies.
With an overall gradepoint of 3.8 and
a keen interest in extracurricular activ-
ities, Moe was promptly initiated into
the all-campus senior honorary so-
ciety, Phi Kappa Phi. A member of
the Engineering Council and ASME,
Moe has participated in numerous ath-
letics, track, in particular. As an as-
sistant chairman of the Engineering
Open House last semester he was re-
sponsible, among other things, for the
publicity of this function. The great
success of the Open House was in no
small part due to John's splendid work.
As ample evidence of his adminis-
trative abilities and of his fine traits
of character, Moe was elected presi-
dent of the Kappa Sigma fraternity
last May.
When Moe graduates at the end of
this semester, he plans to enter the
engineering profession. After several
year's experience in his field of me-
chanical engineering, John hopes,
to operate a firm with his brother Rob-
ert Morrison, who graduated from the
Engineering College in 1941.
Thus in brief, and surely not in full
justice to his excellent record, is a
resume of John Morrison's college ca-
reer. Seldom has a finer lad brought a
better feeling of goodwill and of ac-
complishment to his associates.

Associate Professor Charles T.
Olmsted of the Engineering Mechanics
department has taught at the Univer-
sity of Michigan for twenty-seven
years. During this time, he was Assist-
ant Dean of Students for eight years,
resigning that position in the summer
of 1946. But we are getting ahead of
our story.
Professor Olmsted was born and
raised in what he recalls as the village
of Cleveland, Ohio. At that time,
Cleveland's streets were populated by
horse drawn carriages and street cars.

Charles T. Olmsted
Like a great many boys of his age,
having ambitions to become an engi-
neer, he enrolled at the Case School of
Applied Science in Cleveland. At Case,
the professor did well in his studies,
but along about his junior year he be-
came, to quote, "fed up with the
school," and he decided he needed a
change.
The year was 1907, just a few years
after the great gold strike in the Klon-
dike region. Uncle Sam's forgotten
possession, Alaska, was becoming in-
creasingly important. Young Olmsted
became interested in Alaska, dropped
his studies, accepted a government job,
and set off with a crew of surveyors.
The main part of the Klondike strike
was not in Alaska, but rather on the
Canadian side of the Yukon border.
The actual boundary had never been
determined and it was up to Olm-
sted's party to survey the 131st merid-
ian, which constitutes the eastern bor-
der of Alaska for several hundred
miles. At this point of his story, Pro-
fessor Olmsted reminds us that even

precast Concrete
In view of the present housing sit-
uation, any technique that promises to
shorten building time and effect econ-
omies without sacrificing structural
soundness is a step of interest not only
to the man who wants a new house,
hut also to the contractor. Such a step
has been taken by Vacuum Concrete,
Inc., in the development of means and
methods of precasting and erecting
concrete members that, compared with
general practices, would seem to fore-
cast speedier construction as well as
savings in materials through reductions
in weight.
To determine the practicability of
the company's concrete precasting sys-
tem, two single-story warehouses were
laid out with framing made entirely of
elements produced by the new method.
Each has floor dimensions of 600x200
feet and a loading platform with a 16-
foot wide canopy on one side. Despite
the experimental nature of the work,
the first building was completed in 40
days and the second, when the men
had become familiar with the tech-
nique, in eighteen days.
Foundations, floors and walls of
concrete blocks are of the customary
type; but the roof panels, columns,
girders, and struts were precast by the
vacuum system and assembled by weld-
ing and cementing. The roof slabs,
like the inside columns and struts, were
made in one piece. Exterior columns,
T-caps for the interior columns, and
girders were cast in two pieces which
were bolted together before erection
to form hollow, lightweight box mem-
bers stiffened by interior diaphragms.
Some 4000 structural units were re-
quired for the framing of the ware-
houses, and these were produced on
the site by the use of about 100 spe-
cial molds. With the exceptions of
those for the one-piece columns and
struts, which were poured around
treated cardboard tubing, the forms
consisted of a core of hard, smoothly
troweled, oiled concrete and of ply-
wood sidewalls that were hinged at
the bottom so they could be laid flat
to facilitate stripping and reassembly.
Reinforcing for the members was of
2-inch wire mesh pressed into trough
shapes. These reinforcements were
wired to steel rods by which abutting
sections were tied together.
Concrete for precasting was com-
posed of high early-strength cement
(8 to 9 bags per cubic yard of con-
crete), with pea gravel and stone
screening as aggregates. This mix, to-
gether with the use of vacuum mats
laid on top of the forms to extract
excess water, made it possible, it is
claimed, to turn out concrete members
with a compressive strength of more
than 2500 psi in less than 20 hours
each.
Perhaps the most ingenious feature
of the new method is the suction pad
or vacuum lifter by which the long,
heavy pieces of green concrete are
stripped from the molds without dan-
ger of distortion. This pad is made of

plywood set in a structural-steel frame
and is provided on the underside with
strips of soft rubber, two in the center
running lengthwise and one around the
edges.
It was found that vacuum of ap-
proximately 12!/2 inches of mercury
was sufficient to cause the pad to grip
a casting firmly and to hold it while
the crane deposited it nearby for cur-

Chemists, who are accustomed to see-
ing their standard, Oxygen, taken as
having a molecular weight of exactly
32.00000, may he puzzled at seeing its
molecular weight here show up as 32.-
00882 (Physical). The explanation is
that physicists take the most abundant
isotope, constituting 99.76% of all
Oxygen in Nature, as 16.00000 for
their standard; but then also take ac-
count of the fact, which is ignored by
chemists, that there are present in tiny
amounts in all natural Oxygen two
heavier isotopes, O17 (0.04%) and O18
(0.20%). When correctly weighted
for the percentage of each isotope
present, as well as for their respective
Physical Atomic Weights, the" mean
atomic (and hence molecular) weight
of Oxygen is found to be larger than
the Chemical by a factor of 1.000275.
Other differences also arise, however,
from the fact that Physical methods of
measuring atomic weights are far more
refined than even the most exact
methods which are available to the
chemist.
The volume 22,414 milliliters (which
are practically the same as cubic cent-
imeters) used in the fourth column of
Table I, is the standard volume of any
perfect gas at S.T.P. A gram-mol is
simply the same number of grams as
there are atomic mass units (properly
called daltons) in one molecule of any
chemical substance. For example, the
molecular weight of Oxygen is 32.00
daltons, or atomic mass units. Then
the gram-mol of Oxygen is taken as
having a mass of 32.00 grams. Ex-
perimentally it has been determined
that 32.00 grams of Oxygen, which is
the standard, and which under these
conditions closely approximates an
ideal gas, occupy a volume of 22,414
milliliters at S.T.P.
The significance of the gram-mol
concept rests on a remarkable funda-
mental law of Chemistry. This law is
Avogadro's Law. It states: When com-
pared under the same conditions of
volume, temperature, and pressure
(22,414 ml. at S.T.P., for instance),
different gases contain the same num-
ber of molecules.
What Avogadro's Law means is
simply this. If we take, say, a cubic
foot or a cubic centimeter or a cubic
inch each, of Nitrogen, Oxygen, Ar-
gon, Helium, and Carbon Dioxide, all
under identical conditions of temper-
ature and pressure (at S.T.P., for ex-
ample), were we able actually to count
the number of molecules present in
each volume of gas, we should find
that all five gases contain the same
number of molccuks!
This being the case, if we take dif-
ferent gases and cause them to occupy
the standard volume of 22,414 millilit-
ers at S.T.P., the masses in grams of
the several gases will be found to cor-
respond almost exactly to their molec-
ular weights expressed in atomic mass
units, or daltons.
That is to say, just as 32.00 grams
of Oxygen, the standard, with a molec-
ular weight of 32.00 daltons, occupied
just 22,414 milliliters at S.T.P., so too
(very nearly) will 28.02 grams of Ni-
trogen having a molecular weight of
28.02 daltons: or 2.016 grams of Hy-
drogen having a molecular weight of
2.016 daltons; or 39.96 grams of Ar-
gon having a molecular weight of 39.96
daltons—also occupy just 22,414 mil-
liliters at S.T.P. And the same is true
of any other substantially perfect gas,
whether it is chemically pure or, like
air, a physical mixture of gases.
There is always an implied condi-
tion behind Avogadro's Law, but it
does not concern us here. The condi-
tion is, that at the temperature and
pressure chosen as basis for compar-
ison, all the gases which are compared
must substantially obey the Ideal Gas
Law, PV=nRT, in which P is pres-
sure, V is volume, n is number of
mols, R is a certain "universal con-
stant," and T is the temperature in
degrees Kelvin, (or Absolute Centi-
grade.) Temperatures and pressures
can always be found at which any sub-
stance that can be gasified will sub-
stantially obey the Ideal Gas Law, or
be what is called a "perfect" gas. Con-
versely, conditions can also be found
wrhere not even Hydrogen or Helium
will closely ol&gt;ey the Ideal Gas Law.
All that matters to us here, however,
is the fact that at S.T.P. for dry air,
at the partial pressure then found for
each of the constituent gases, all of
them substantially obey the Ideal Gas
Law, and hence Avogadro's Law,
whether alone or mixed.
Although now thoroughly validated,
historically Avogadro's Law was
strongly doubted for nearly a century
after its proposal by Count Amadeo
Avogadro in 1811. In fact, until quite
recently it was always called Avogad-
dro's Hypothesis. Ably seconded by
the famous Ampere, Avogadro had
proposed this principle as a necessary
consequence of another simple chemi-
cal law, the Law of Combination by
Volume, which had been discovered
and announced by the French chemist
Gay-Lussac in 1808. The connection is
now immaterial, for Avogadro's Law
can be reduced from the well-proved
Kinetic Theory of Gases, without any
reference to Chemistry whatever.
The ratio of a mass of one gram to
a mass of one dalton, or atomic mass
unit, is called Avogadro's Number.
Equally valid is the definition that Av-
ogadro's Number is the number of
molecules in one gram-mol (or atoms
in one gram-aton) of any substance,
such as in 22,414 milliliters of any per-
fect gas at S.T.P. Because it connects
a definite number of molecules with a
definite volume of gas, we choose the
second definition for our present pur-
pose. The latest (Birge's 1945) value
of Avogadro's Number is (6.02338±
0.00043) x 1023, and this is consid-
ered so very accurate that it will prob-
ably stand now, unchanged for many
years.
The method of expressing numbers
which has just been used is a great fa-
vorite among scientists, and mathemat-
ically it is warranted by the simple al-
gebraic laws of exponents, which make
logarithms so simple and useful in
many otherwise difficult calculations.
The exponent 23 means simply the
number of times that 10 is multiplied
by itself before it is finally multiplied
by 6.02338. Just as 102 would be 10 x
10, or 100 (a "1" followed by two ze-
ros), in like fashion 1023 would be 10
multiplied by itself 23 times, or a "1"
followed by 23 zeros, like this: 100,-
000,000,000,000,000,000,000. If now
you multiply this number by 6.02338.
you get Avogadro's Number, which is:
602,338,000,000,000,000,000,000. To
write it, simply write down 0, and then
follow it by 23 other digits, the first
five of which are 02338 and the re-
maining eighteen all zeros. The same
principles apply to writing any other
number similarly expressed. If you
want to, you can write Avogadro's
Number as 60.2338 x 1022, or 602.338
x 102i, or 6,023.38 x 102o, and so on,
just as properly as by writing it 6.-

02338 x 1023, for all these numbers
will come out to Avogadro's Number
as written out completely above.
This whale of a number is the num-
ber of molecules actually present in
22,414 milliliters of any perfect gas
(such as air) at S.T.P. As there are
16.3868 milliliters in one cubic inch, if
we divide 22,414 by 16.3868, we find
that 22,414 milliliters are the same vol-
ume as 1367.81 cubic inches. Since
602,338,000,000,000,000,000,000 mole-
cules are contained in 1367.81 cubic
inches, by simple division we find that
one cubic inch, at S.T.P., contains
4.403674 x 1020 molecules of air. And
since previously, we found that the
average air molecule contains 1.99088
atoms, by simple multiplication we find
that one cubic inch of dry air at S.T.P.
contains 8.77158 x 1020 atoms.
Now Providence has decreed that
every group shall contain at least one
Doubting Thomas whose duty it is to
challenge every statement that seems in
any way open to argument. Ours re-
monstrates: "But how can anybody
know a thing like that? Who in the
world ever had insomnia so bad that
he lay awake until he had counted all
the molecules in a cubic inch of air?"
Well—do you recall the story behind
the atomic bomb? Do you recall how
our chemists and physicists investi-
gated the properties of Uranium-235
and Plutonium-239 in amounts meas-
ured in micrograms, and then, on a ba-
sis of what they found, projected the
huge plants at Oak Ridge, Tennessee,
and at Han ford, Washington—besides
much of the bomb itself—and had all
of them click exactly right, right from
the start? Before the explosion at
Hiroshima, self-styled "practical" men
used to smile with polite disdain at
what physical scientists thought they
knew. To them it was like the ancient
trick of a sharp-eyed few gazing in-
tently upward at something they
claimed they saw, but that nobody else
could see at all. Hiroshima sent flying
the notion that our physical scientists
are naive daisy-pickers whose activi-
ties have no important incidence on the
lives of "practical" men. The apocalyp-
tic flash at Hiroshima revealed them

as brassknuckled realists whose prow-
ess in the practical world was not a
whit inferior to a pirate's. Hiroshima
proved that scientific facts, for all
their gauzy delicacy, are things as hard
and real and weighty, and above all
brutally practical, as gold bullion, steel
bullets, battle-ships and bulldozers. By
the deadliest test of all, results, our
physical scientists were revealed as
realists of the highest stature and qual-
ity.
For nearly forty years now, Avo-
gadro's Number has been under the
closest scrutiny by this Murderer's
Row of intense realists. Right from the
beginning of the modern work, there
has been remarkable agreement among
them as to its magnitude. Except for
some ancient, ill-founded work by the
German, Loschmidt, back in 1865, Per-
rin, a Frenchman, was the first, in
1908. Following one of those simple
yet wonderful pieces,of deep insight
so characteristic of Albert Einstein,
Perrin investigated Avogadro's Num-
ber by studying Brownian displace-
ments of collodial particles suspended
in a liquid. Using two distinctly differ-
ent methods, Perrin arrived at a final
estimate of Avogadro's Number as be-
ing about 6.82 x 1023.
Approaching its evaluation through
studies of the mean free paths of mole-
cules, various early observers found
values between about 5.0 and 6.0 x
1023. In 1915 Westgren of Uppsala,
Sweden, working with Brownian dis-
placements of collodial gold, silver,
and selenium particles, found 6.05 x
1023, with an uncertainty estimated to
be no larger than l/o of one per cent,
or 0.03 x 1023. Likewise studying
Brownian movements, Svedberg found
6.2, and Brillouin 6.9 x 1023. Measur-
ing the scattering of solar radiation, in
a method devised by Lord Rayheigh,
King found 6.2 (1914), and Pacini of
Italy (1915) found 5.7 x 1023. Planck,
the immortal German who made (h),
the natural constant of Action (which
equals Energy x Time), famous in
Atomic Physics, studying the laws of
radiation deduced about 6.06 x 1023".

Why some homes get better all the time
HOMES, like human beings, need stout "constitutions". ..
which depend, in turn, on building products used. And
these are getting better all the time.
In building or remodeling today, you can choose weather-
defiant paint . . . warm-hued and lasting plastic tiles for
kitchens and bathrooms . . . hardware and window screens
of stainless steel or any-purpose plastics.
Yours, too, are heating installations with leakproof
welded piping and streamlined plumbing. To say nothing
of resin-glued plywood, good for decades as sheathing, sub-
flooring, doors and complete interior and exterior walls.
These are a few of today's countless building products
that give better service because into them go better basic
materials.
Producing better materials for the use of science and
industry and the benefit of mankind is the work of the
people of Union Carbide.
It takes basic knowledge and relentless research. Tremen-
dous pressures and extreme vacuums. Heat up to 6000°
and cold down to 300° below zero, Fahrenheit. Working
with these—and working together—the various Units of
UCC now separate or combine nearly one-half of the many
elements of the earth.

remarkably ingenious surface-tension
method of great novelty, P. LeComte
Du Nouy arrived at a figure of 6.005
x 1023. In 1924, Dr. Fletcher, a co-
worker of Dr. Robert A. Millikan, ob-
served Brownian displacements of
minute oil drops settling through air

1932, Kappler of Miinchen, studying
the angular displacements of a tiny
mirror suspended from an exceedingly
tiny quartz suspension, in a high vacu-
um where the molecular blows could be
separately observed, arrived at (6.059
±0.036) x 1023.
In plain truth, the names of really
great scientists who have worked on
problems immediately related to the
evaluation of Avogadro's Number read
like a roster of Nobel Prize Winners!
(Continued from page 26)
Especially reliable was the work of
Dr. Millikan in evaluating Avogadro's
Number through measuring the charge
on the electron. By exquisitely refined
experimental methods ("This device is
simply an electrical balance in place of
a mechanical one, and it ztnll weigh ac-
curately and easily to one ten-billionth
of a milligram"—Dr. Millikan) and in
thousands of careful, patient experi-
ments stretching over years of deep la-
bors, Dr. Millikan measured the charge
carried by the electron, and proved it
to have a single unique, indivisible val-
ue, which he determined with the high-
est possible precision. The value he
found has since been amended very
slightly, in light of much later work
connected with the reflection of x-rays
from crystal lattices. A full account of
his great work is given in his classic
book, "Electrons f-\- and —), Protons,
Photons, Neutrons, Mesotrons, and
Cosmic Rays," very recently revised.
Long before, the value of the Fara-
day electrolytic constant the amount of
electricity needed to deposit one gram-
atom of any monovalent chemical ele-
ment—had been determined with high
precision. When the Faraday constant,
expressed in electrostatic units, was di-
vided by Dr. Millikan's value for the
charge on one electron, out came Avo-
gadro's Number with a precision nev-
er previously attained. The modern
value of Avogadro's Number (6.02338
±0.00043) x 1023, is considered un-
certain by only 71 parts per million, or
1 in 14,085. But the uncertainty is that
amount in both -f- and — directions,
and so, in absolute magnitude, is about
1 in 7,042. This is comparable to an
absolute uncertainty of nine inches in
measuring a distance of one mile—
about 1/70 of one per cent—which is
really wonderful accuracy considering
the difficulty of the necessary meas-
urements.
The figure which we found for the
number of atoms in a cubic inch of
dry air at S.T.P.—namely, 8.77158 x
1020—is highly indigestible in its raw-
state. Let us cook and season it a bit,
in order to make it delectable to every-
body. Let us take this ungraspable

number and look at it from the stand-
point of each atom being a baseball.
By regulation, an Official League
Baseball has a circumference which
must be between 9.00 and 9.25 inches.
Let us assume the average, 9.125
inches, to be the circumference of the
average baseball. Dividing this figure
by tt(=3.141593), the correspond-
ing diameter is found to be 2.90458
inches. As the volume of a sphere is
7rd3/6, by six-place logarithms wre
easily find the volume to be 12.83062
cubic inches. How many can be packed
into a cubic mile?
If three baseballs are pressed tightly
together on top of a table, and then a
fourth is socketed into the indentation
above them, this is the tightest possible
packing of which the baseballs are ca-
pable. By continuing to add a baseball
at each indentation found, a volume of
any size or shape can be packed solidly
with baseballs. If we thus pack a very
large triangular pyramid with spher-
ical shot whose diameters (all equal,
of course) are very small compared
with the sides of the pyramid, by com-
bining the well-known pile-of-shot
formulas with the geometrical formula
for the volume of a pyramid, we find
the equal-spheres packing-factor to be
tt3V2, or 0.7404814. This packing-
factor, multiplied into the total volume
of a large bin of any shape, will tell
how many of the bin's total cubic
inches can be solidly occupied by equal
spheres of any size whatever, whether
grains of sand, peas, marbles, golf-
balls, baseballs, or basket-balls, pro-
vided the spheres are all of equal size
and the total volume of the containing
bin is very large compared with the
volume of one sphere. If this value of
the condensed, or dead-solid volume is
now divided by the volume of one of
the equal spheres, the quotient will be
the number of the equal spheres which
can go into the bin.
As there are 63,360 inches in one
statute mile, or (63,360)3 cubic inches
in one cubic mile, a cubic mile contains
2.543579 x 1014 cubic inches. This fig-
ure, multiplied by our equal-spheres
packing-factor (0.7404814) yields 1.-
883472 x 1014 cubic inches as the num-
ber, in a bin of one cubic mile capac-
ity, which can be solidly occupied by
equal spheres of any size whatever,
such as our baseballs. When divided
by the volume of one baseball (12.-
83062 in3), we find that 1.467949 x
1013 baseballs can be packed solidly
into one cubic mile. In plain King's
Arabic this means that some 14,679,-
490,000,000 baseballs—nearly fifteen
million-million (American trillion)
baseballs can be packed into a cubic
mile.
Now, assuming that each one of our
atoms in a cubic inch of air has been
enlarged into a baseball, how many cu-
bic miles will they occupy? Answer:
their total number, which we found to
be 8.77158 x 102°, divided by 1.467949
x 1013, the number which can be tight-
packed into a cubic mile. When divided
out, the quotient is found to be 5.-
975397 x 107 cubic miles. That is, to a
scale where 1 atom equals 1 baseball,

Sodium for organic reactions is shipped in 80,OOO-lb quantities. It is pumped into the car, solidi-
fied by cooling and melted by hot oil for removal.
There would seem to be a consider-
able gap between the electrolysis of
salt to make sodium, and research in
the field of organic chemistry. How-
ever, at Du Pont as much emphasis
is placed on organic research to de-
velop outlets for sodium as on its in-
organic uses.
For more than 15 years, intensive
work on industrial uses for sodium
has been carried on in Du Pont lab-
oratories and plants by chemists,
physicists, chemical, mechanical and
electrical engineers.
In the organic field, this research
has contributed a number of impor-
tant uses for sodium such as the re-
duction of fatty esters, particularly
of natural glycerides, to alcohols.

Du Pont organic chemists have
found that sodium with selected sec-
ondary alcohols, such as methyl amyl
alcohol, in the presence of toluene or
xylene, eliminates shortcomings of
the classical method involving ethyl
alcohol and sodium. Practically quan-
titative yields of the higher molec-
ular weight alcohols are obtained.
This new method is especially use-
ful in preparing unsaturated alcohols
not easily made by catalytic hydro-
genation. The process can be carried
out at atmospheric pressure and
compares favorably with catalytic
hydrogenation of saturated, higher
fatty esters because of the simplicity
of operation and equipment.
The discovery of the new reaction
conditions has led to the use of mil-
lions of pounds of sodium annually
for manufacture of long-chain alco-
hols for wetting and emulsifying
agents and synthetic detergents.
Other important processes devel-
oped by Du Pont organic research
include the use of sodium for reduc-
tion of fatty esters to corresponding
long-chain acyloins, and reduction
of nitriles to primary amines.
Du Pont has also contributed to
the development of many other uses
for sodium and its simple derivatives,
such as in the manufacture of tetra-
ethyllead, used in high-grade motor
fuels, dyestuffs synthesis, and de-
scaling of alloy steels. In the form, of
sodium hydride or sodium alkoxides,
sodium is a catalyst for many Claisen
condensations, useful in the manu-
facture of barbiturates, sulfa drugs,
vitamins, keto-acids and diketones.

the number of atoms in one cubic inch
of dry air at S.T.P. will occupy a total
bin volume of 59.753,970 cubic miles!
Let us carry the picture further.
Suppose that we have a bin with floor
area equal to the total area of North
America. How high would its parallel-
element walls have to be in order to
hold that many cubic miles of base-
balls?
According to Dr. J. Paul Goode,
Professor Emeritus of Geography at
the University of Chicago, the area of
North America is 8,634,967 square
miles. When this figure is divided into
59,753,970 cubic miles, the necessary
height is found to be 6.920016 miles.
Converted to feet, the height of the bin
is found to be 36,538 feet!
For comparison, consider Mt. Ever-
est, the tallest mountain in the world.
Its height is recorded as 29,003 feet.
Our bin walls would tower 7535 feet
(1.43 miles) above even the tallest
mountain!
Over the mean latitude of North
America, the troposphere, or weather
air, will average just about our figure
(Continued from page 30)
of 36,538 feet, and this is just about
the highest summer altitude of the
highest clouds of all, the cirrus clouds.
Another interesting view of this im-
mense number is this. Suppose the en-
tire 69 square miles of the District
of Columbia were made the floor of a
bin with walls 5694.5 feet high. This
is 414.5 feet higher than a mile. It is
also the height of 4-5 9 Empire State
Buildings, each 1250 feet high. Sup-
pose this bin were filled with a medium
sand, each of the grains of which was
a perfect little sphere just 1/32 of an
inch in diameter—just right for pass-

This too would be the number of atoms
in one cubic inch of dry air at S.T.P.!
Clearly to appreciate how immense
our North American bin is, let us do
some helpful supposing. Suppose that
the whole vault of heaven is lined with
high cirrus clouds whose base is a per-
fect spherical surface everywhere just
36,538 feet above an equally perfect
spherical surface of the earth. Sup-
pose that all the air between the cloud-
base and the earth is as clear and
cloudless as a vacuum, so that a six-
foot man, height of eye 5'8", is doing
the viewing.
Our six-footer's personal horizon
will be 2.915 miles away from him.
But he will lie able to see more than
234 miles beyond that—out to a total
distance of 237,092 miles, which is
about the crow-flight distance from
Detroit to Buffalo, Cincinnati, Indian-
apolis, or Chicago. The area under this
vast circle will be 1/48.9 of the entire
area of North America. But owing to
the wedging-out of volume toward the
limit of vision, the volume of clear air
visible to him underneath the clouds
will be only 1/79.25 of the total vol-
ume of the whole North American bin.
or 753,950 dibic miles in all. This,
however, is under conditions of ideal
visibility. In the vast air volume out-
lined by the highest clouds ordinarily
seen, at the longest distance at which
they are ordinarily visible, one could
probably see not more than about one-
fifth as much as our six-footer. This
would be about 150,000 cubic miles of
volume underneath high clouds, or

gigantic North American baseball bin.
But frozen into solid air the im-
mense number of atoms in a cubic
inch of dry air at S.T.P. will need no
vasty bin of 59^4 million cubic miles.
They will occupy only 1/858.5 of a
cubic inch—a little cube the edge of
which is about 5/6 of one-eighth of
an inch long!
And even to this scale of 1 atom
equals 1 baseball the nucleus of the
average air atom will still be only
about 1/15,000 of an inch in diameter!
Assuming tetrahedral packing, by pro-
portion one finds the diameter of the
average air atom to be 3.134xl0"8 cen-
timeters. But calculating the mean nu-
clear diameter from 2(1.48xlCrls)
A1/3, where A is the Mass Number
(which averages 14.48314 for the av-
erage air atom), one finds the mean
nuclear diameter to be 7.125xlO"13 cen-
timeters. Thus the average air atom
has a diameter that is 43,400 times as
great as the diameter of its nucleus.
When the diameter of our average
baseball, 2.90458 inches, is divided by
43,400, it is found that the nucleus, to
the same scale, would be 1/14,950 of
an inch in diameter. Magnified 1879
times it would look like Vs inch.
Next time you go out of doors on
one of those hushed, langurous sum-
mer afternoons when far high tumbles
of fleecy cumulo-cirrus paint fancies
of Nelson's "far-distant storm-beaten
ships on which the Grand Army never
looked," or "Charm'd magic casements,
opening on the foam of perilous seas,
in faery lands forlorn," stand dead
still a moment and drink that im-
mensity to the lees.
Imagine all cloud space in sight—
aye, and on out to Asia; to Ellsmere
Island; to Labrador and Newfound-
land; to Cuba, Panama, and the tip of
Southern California: into the cool
primeval forests of Washington and
British Columbia: and thence back to
Alaska once more—packed high as that
highest cloud with a deep ocean of
baseball that drowns even the Rockies
fully thrice over, save for a very few
peaks.
Verily is this a wonderful world!
With more truth than poetry might we
paraphrase the beautiful words of the
107th Psalm into reading: "They that
go forth on the Unknown with scien-
tific instruments, that do business in
great laboratories ; These see the works
of the Lord, and his wonders even in
die commonplace."

PROBLEM — You are designing a circular saw. The blade must
have horizontal, vertical, and angular adjustments. Your prob-
lem is to work out a drive for the blade that permits this three-
way adjustment. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER —Use an S.S.White flexible shaft
to bring power from the counter-shaft or motor to the blade.
There is no simpler me-
chanical means than a
flexible shaft for driving
parts which must be ad-
justable. And simplicity in
design means economy in
production.
This is just one of hundreds
of remote control and
power drive problems to
which S. S. White flexible
shafts provide a simple
answer. That's why every
engineer should be famil-
iar with the range and
scope of these tireless
"Metal Muscles" for me-
chanical bodies.

foot-candles. These figures show the
hrightness, in foot-lamberts, of the va-
rious portions of the room. The re-
flectivities, on which these brightnesses
are dependent, are 70 per cent for the
ceiling, 60 per cent for the inside walls,
30 per cent for the floor, 35 per cent
for the desks, and 70 per cent for the
task. The horizontal working planes in-
dicated are each 24 inches above the
floor, and the three rows are 5, 12.5.
and 20 feet from the fenestration wall.
It is quite obvious that if a fenestra-
tion material has the capacity to light
the surfaces in the upper half of a
room, that these surfaces should be
considered as a part of the lighting
system. They should have high reflec-
tivities, consistent with reasonable
maintenance and the incorporation of
acoustical materials, and a matte finish
in order that the initially incident
light will lie reflected and scattered
over the working plane.
Observations of many interiors and
the measurement of reflectivities indi-
cate that it is not uncommon for a
room to have a light ceiling, but the
adoption of relatively high reflecting
surfaces does not extend much far-
ther. There has been a general accept-
ance of dark surfaces, in fact, very
dark surfaces, for the lower half of a
room, for woodwork, furniture, desks,
and floor.
It should be quite apparent that the
distribution of light in a room is not
a question of one reflection, but of
multiple reflections, the number de-
pending on the reflectivities of all the
surfaces in the room and the areas of
these surfaces relative to the total sur-
face area of the room. The selection

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



NO, this picture isn't faked. It shows
white-hot molten metal being pour-
ed into a little glass dish resting on ice.
This is Coming's "Vycor" brand 96%
silica glass, a result of the first really new
glassmaking process in over 2000 years.
It can withstand sudden extremes of
hot and cold without breaking, and tem-
peratures up to 2000° F. without melt-
ing. It is one of the hardest, most acid-
resistant, and electrically-resistant
glasses known. And it has already open-
ed up new fields in many industries.
Now it is ready to go to work to make
cooking easier, cleaner, and safer for
millions of women as a burner plate
on a modern gas range, soon to be
announced. The smooth glass plates will
distribute heat more evenly and give
firm support to even smallest utensils.
And they will keep spilled food from
clogging burners.
Corning began its search for heat-resis-
tant glasses years ago when it was asked
by railroads to supply a glass for brake-
men's lanterns that wouldn't shatter
when a gust of cold rain hit it. This was
the forerunner of the famous Pyrex brand
glasses which have since found their way
into thousands of industries in such di-
verse form as glass piping, laboratory
ware, and ex-ray tubes, and into millions
of homes as Pyrex Oven ware and
Flameware cooking utensils.
Corning not only knows glass, but
knows how to make it work. It has
the finest glass research organization and
the finest group of skilled workers in the
world ...a hard-to-heat combination that
will be at your service whatever career
you choose. In the meantime, learn all
you can about glass and if we can help
answer any questions, call on us.Corning

of relatively high reflectivities for all
surfaces in a room not only establishes
a higher illumination level with the
same available light, but it also mini-
mizes contrasts. A room environment
that is free of high contrasts will also
provide diffuse illumination of the
task; that is, illumination that is free
of disturbing shadows.
The distribution of light in the typi-
cal classroom, indicated by Figures 1
and 2, is good. The arrangement of
fenestration and associated reflectivi-
ties greatly reduces the extremes of
brightness in the room as compared to
those existing in the usual classroom.
This is not only true for the two ex-
terior illumination conditions pictured,
but for all exterior conditions. The
diversity in brightness between the
first and last rows of desks is approxi-
mately 3 for all sun altitudes, varying
between 2.5 for a sun altitude of 30°
to 3.5 for a sun altitude of 70°. For an
overcast sky the diversity is 5. These
figures for diversity are to be com-
pared or contrasted with a diversity of
as much as 10, 15, or more for con-
ventional lighting when the sky only is
the source of light. When the sun is
on the conventional fenestration it is
difficult to make a comparison because
of the necessity of pulling the shades.
The need of quality lighting and
good seeing conditions is of the ut-
most importance in schools, offices, and
any place where critical visual tasks
are undertaken. Many researches by
medical men and other scientifically
trained specialists indicate that the
preserving of good eyes, the aiding of
impaired eyesight, the reduction of eye
strain and fatigue, the maintenance of
good health, and the increasing of gen-
eral work efficiency are dependent to
a very large extent on quality lighting.
This need, while general, is even
greater for schools because of the
physiological changes that are taking
place in the growing child and their
dependence on the child's environment.
Present educational techniques involve
critical visual tasks to a greater extent
than previous teaching methods and
thus the need for the best in seeing
conditions is. greater than ever before.
The consequences resulting from the
failure to provide quality lighting will
also be greater than ever.
Illumination engineers and archi-
tects are rapidly realizing the impor-
tance of quality lighting and are gen-
erally anxious to provide it. The con-
struction of schools in which serious
consideration is given to the lighting
environment is rapidly becoming quite
common. The picture above is of a
classroom in such a school, the Sacred
Heart School in Grosse Isle, Michi-
gan, for which Mr. Walter Rozycki
was the architect.
The significance and meaning of
proper illumination, as it relates to
both natural and artificial light, are con-
tinually being investigated and the re-
sults published and utilized. The nat-
ural illumination program at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, sponsored by the
Owens-Illinois Glass Company, is be-
ing continued with a view to the de-
velopment of even better fenestration
materials and the more efficient use of
natural light. It is hoped that all such
development work will continue until
the ultimate in quality lighting can be
provided for everyone.

Nine-cent miracle
YOU ARE looking at a 9-cent piece
of the hardest metal made by man.
It is Carboloy Cemented Carbide.
And this particular piece . . . one of
a large number of standard blanks
which sell for less than $1.00 . . . when
used as the cutting edge of a metal-
working tool, performs miracles in
helping to speed up production,
increase quality and cut costs of
machined parts.
Carboloy costs steadily down
While this is only one of hundreds of
Carboloy forms that range in use from
tools and dies to masonry drills and
wear-resistant parts, it dramatizes the
long downward trend in the price of
this miraculous metal.
For today, its low cost and remark-
able hardness are taking Carboloy into
many broad new fields. Housewives,
hobbyists, home-owners and craftsmen
are all experiencing the qualities of
Carboloy at low cost.
That's great news for industrialists,
too.
It means that all the extra benefits
of Carboloy tools, dies and wear-resist-
ant parts can be had at costs compar-
able to ordinary materials. And, consid-
ered by authorities to be "one of the
ten most significant industrial develop-
ments of the past decade," Carboloy is
rapidly becoming the standard where-
ever a versatile, hard metal is required.
An odds-on chance
The odds are 10 to 1 that Carboloy—
the amazing metal of many uses—can
be put to work by our engineers to
give your products higher quality at
lower cost. Why not call us in for
consultation?

fessor Rote said that this could not be
done in the foundry lab owing to the
very inadequate artificial lighting.
The foundry lab has a high ceiling
with a central row of skylights, in
addition to the windows located along
two sides of the room. Hanging from
this high ceiling, by means of long
cord are lights with tin shades of a
conical shape. These lights are spaced
at equal intervals throughout the lab
and during the daytime afford an al-
most negligible amount of light. At
night, the faintest glow is given off
and just allows a person to walk-
around the lab without bumping into
equipment. It simply would be impos-
sible to carry on work under these con-
ditions. Work in this lab doesn't re-
quire the same quality of lighting ex-
pected in a library; however, the light-
ing should be such that a student
needn't strain his eyes.
Of all the laboratories visited, the
one that had, by far, the worst lighting
was the Mechanical Engineering Lab-
oratory located in the West Engineer-
ing Building. This laboratory consists
of two immense rooms, one being lo-
cated in the basement and the second
room located directly above the first.
Both rooms are crowded with water
turbines, steam turbines and other me-
chanical equipment. Bulb lighting
which supplies light to the upstairs
and downstairs rooms is very inade-
quate. The upstairs room has some ad-
vantage over the basement room owing
to its greater exposure to natural
lighting from the outside. The down-
stairs lighting, however, gives nothing
but a dull glow. It is important to note
here that the aforementioned observa-
tions were made on a very bright and
clear day; the situation on a rainy day
or in the early part of a winter morn-
ing would be far worse.
Undoubtedly, the departments in
charge of these laboratories have con-
sidered seriously their own lighting
problems and are trying to ameliorate
the situation. However, the object of
this survey was to make an objective
evaluation of lighting conditions as
they exist in the College of Engineer-
ing today. These conditions vary over
a wide range, from the very best, as in
the case of the West Engineering
Library, to the very worst, as in the
case of the Mechanical Engineering
Laboratory.

though the 131st meridian runs due
north and south it was no cinch to
survey it. It was necessary to trans-
port equipment hundreds of miles over
unknown, uneven, and unpleasant ter-
rain. And, unlike our campus engineers
who survey such distances as that be-
tween Stockwell and Mosher Jordan,
the Alaskan engineers surveyed dis-
tances as great as 53 miles in one
jump. Professor Olmsted worked as a
"front heliographer," communicating
with his transit party by means of
morse code, flashed with mirrors in the
sun.
After nearly a year of absence, Pro-
fessor Olmsted returned to Case where
he received his B.S. degree in Civil
Engineering in the fall of 1908. Upon
graduation, he went to work as a
bridge designer for the Nickel Plate
Railroad. Resigning his position with
the railroad after two year's work, the
professor again returned to Case, this
time to teach civil engineering. He
stayed there up until the time of the
first world war when he again accepted
a job with the government—a First
Lieutenancy in the U.S. Army. He
served overseas with the Sixth Divi-
sion and then with the Army of
Occupation.
Again a civilian, Professor Olmsted
took a job with the Oregon State
Highway Department. He worked in
the west for a year and then came to
Michigan in order to help establish
the State Board of Registration of
Architects and Engineers. In the fall
of 1920, Professor Olmsted came to
Ann Arbor to teach engineering me-
chanics. He continued in his position
as office manager for the State Board,
and he is still active as an examina-
tion consultant on that board.
Professor Olmsted is a member of
Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, Society of
Automotive Engineers, and the Amer-
ican Society of Engineering Educa-
tion. He claims no spare time hobby,
although he has just finished building
his fourth house in Ann Arbor!
Much of his spare time is taken up
with his work on State Board Exami-
nations; and it is interesting to note,
he says, that graduate engineers are
still making some of the same mis-
takes on State Board exams that they
made in college.

NORBIDE*. . .
A Norton development that's
mighty useful to industry
A product of Norton research, its unique characteristics
make it very helpful in three entirely different ways
— as an abrasive for lapping super hard materials —in
molded form where extreme resistance to wear is de-
sired—or for metallurgical use as an alloying agent.
Norbide is the trade-mark for Norton Boron Carbide, a
material produced by fusing two commonplace materials,
boric acid and petroleum coke, in the electric furnace at
terrific temperatures. It is harder than any material ex-
cept the diamond.
Not only is Norbide* extremely useful as an abrasive but
because it is self-bonding under high pressure at high
temperatures, it can be molded into a variety of products
that are finding wide application for their exceptional
resistance to wear and other unique properties.
The fascinating story of Norbide products and their many
interesting applications is described in catalog 378-CP.

be effected, it was necessary to break
the "normal suction" between the
concrete mold and the structural mem-
ber by admitting compressed air
through openings left in the core for
that purpose.
Actual construction proceeded some-
what along the lines followed in put-
ting up a steel building. The work was
done in ordered sequence, roofing fol-
lowing closely upon assembly of the
framing. The roof slabs are 20 feet
long, 5 feet wide, and V4 mcn thick,
and have integral longitudinal beams
and transverse ribs. Preparatory to
casting, steel inserts were welded to
the main reinforcing of the panels, and
these inserts were in turn welded to
steel straps bolted to the faces of the
girders. Roof slabs were thus quickly
put in place and the entire surface
covered, with a built-up felt-and-as-
phalt membrane.

torquemeter
Instruments for measuring electri-
cal quantities are simple and exist in
great variety. Just as amperes are
measured in the transmission and
absorption of electrical power, torque
must be measured and known for all
phases of mechanical power transmis-
sion and absorption. An instrument to
do this efficiently and economically
over the entire range of power-trans-
mission machinery is known as the
magnetic-coupled torquemeter.
The new instrument is a compact,
adaptable device for measuring torque
transmitted by a rotating shaft. In ap-
pearance it resembles a motor 10 to
25 inches long and 5 to 14 inches in
diameter with a double-extended shaft,
which may be coupled like a jackshaft
between prime mover and power ab-
sorber. It is fed by an external power
supply, a simple metering circuit giv-
ing the torque reading. The unit
weighs between 30 and 725 pounds,
depending on the rating and type of
metering circuit the application re-
quires.
The magnetic-coupled torquemeter
utilizes the principle employed in the
magnetic-strain gage. Two stacks of
E-shaped punchings are mounted on
either side of a rectangular armature.
When the coils on the center legs of
the punchings are excited with alter-
nating current, their impedances de-
pend upon the reluctance. Moving the
armature toward one of the stacks
varies the impedance of the coils in an
opposite sense. When the two coils
form two legs of an a-c bridge, a small
motion of the armature causes a meas-
urable change in the current through
the metering circuit, giving an indica-
tion of the amount of movement. Be-
cause the torque signal from rotor to
stator is transferred by magnetic flux,
errors due to speed, atmospheric con-

As distinct from the strain gage, a
constant air gap has heen added be-
tween the ends of the punchings and
the coils of the torquemeter. This is a
radial gap between rotor and stator.
The coils are mounted on the stator,
which has replaced the outside portion
of the iron cores, and a gap is left in
the shells of magnetic material sur-
sounding the coils just above the ac-
tive air gaps.
The shaft has three equidistant
flanges with rings of non-magnetic
metal shrunk over them. Pinned to
these non-magnetic rings are magnetic
rings with projections of teeth on
their adjacent edges that interlock to
form the active or motion-sensitive
air gaps, opening or closing and chang-
ing in length as torque is applied to
the shaft. The two outer rings take the
place of that part of the iron core
within the constant air gap. The inner
ring replaces the rectangular armature.
When the coils are excited with al-
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued from page 40)
lernating current, flux passes around
the shells, off the stator and into the
rotor, through the active gaps, and
back into the stator. The active gaps
are the major reluctance in the mag-
netic circuit, and therefore any amount
of torque developed causes the im-
pedance of one coil to increase and
that of the other to decrease. If the
coils form two legs of an a-c bridge,
the unbalanced voltage is a measure of
this torque.
The control circuit consists of an
a-c bridge and a metering circuit. A
signal pickup transformer takes the
signal from the a-c bridge and passes
it through a rectifier to the metering
circuit. Inasmuch as the voltage from
the torquemeter bridge cannot be con-
veniently balanced to zero, a constant
bias is supplied to the metering circuit
by another rectifier. The signal is meas-
ured by a milliammeter. or, if larger
indicators or recorders are required,
the potential drop across a resistor
carrying an unbalanced current is used.
To measure this potential drop a mil-
livoltmeter, preferably of the self-bal-
ancing potentiometer type, is used.
Varying sensitivities are obtained by
shunting the meters.
The rectifier circuits have stable tem-
peratures characteristics and swamping
resistors minimize the effect of changes
in the forward resistance of the recti-
fier. These swamping resistors are sta-
ble and large enough in comparison to
the rectifier resistance to make varia-
tions in it negligible.
The output of the torquemeter is
directly proportional to the input volt-
age. If the voltage varies enough to
produce objectionable errors in the
readings, a voltage regulator can be
used. The impedance of bridge and
metering circuits is matched with the
signal pickup transformer for greater
power output efficiency.
The magnetic-coupled torquemeter
is used to test high-speed motors (up
to 10,000 rpm) and to measure the ef-
fect of design changes upon stray load
loss. The torquemeter can also be used

electrons
The first observation of an electron
beam made visible by its own light has
been made in the 70,000,000-volt sync-
rotron built in General Electric's Re-
search Laboratory. It has been shown
that visible light is literally given off
from the moving electrons. Because of
the dangerous X-rays emitted by the
syncrotron, it is not possible to ap-
proach closely while in operation, but
by means of a mirror, scientists can
watch from behind a thick concrete
wall. Inside the doughnut-shaped vacu-
um tube in which the electrons circle,

a brilliant bluish-white spot of light
appears, beamed forward from the
electrons, tangent to their circular or-
bit.
Though the effect is mainly of theo-
retical interest, the visibility of the

Visible electron beam
electrons will be of use to scientists
developing larger machines in which
they can locate accurately, within the
vacuum enclosure, the tiny beam as it
reaches higher energies.
Previously, electrons have detected
visibly only by indirect means. When
they strike a material such as zinc sul-
fide or pass through certain gases, a
glow results, but such light does not
come from the bombarding electrons
themselves. Also, with a laboratory de-
vice known as the Wilson cloud cham-
ber, the path of an electron appears as
a threadlike trail of fog, but this again
is indirect. Scientists say this method
is- much like telling where a boat has
travelled by aerial observation of the
wake it leaves behind.
Emission of light from the electron
stream is similar to radiation of radio
waves from a transmitting station. In
the antenna, electrons oscillate rap-
idly to and fro between the metal
atoms. As they are speeded up and
slowed down, their energy is converted
into electromagnetic waves.
In 1944, two Russian physicists, D.
Iwanenko and I. Pomeranchuk, point-
ed out that radiation should come from
the electrons moving in circular orbits
in a betatron. Over about a hundred-

YES. Certain manufacturing processes which
effect a change in the state of matter from
raw to finished product, frequently produce
yields such as this.
However, Standard Oil does it daily . . . with-
out changing the state of matter!
It happens in the huge Whiting, Indiana,
refinery shown above. Certain crackers in this
vast 1,100 acre "apparatus" yield 102 volume
units of liquid petroleum products for each 100
volume units of crude oil processed. It is the
result of cracking heavy, dense hydrocarbons
into lighter more valuable ones whose volume
is greater than the original charge.
This surprising yield is not considered par-
ticularly significant in itself. It is indicative,
however, of our constant effort to develop new
products and processes and to improve old
ones. This is the collective accomplishment of
chemists and engineers . . . men who, like you,
studied at America's leading colleges of science

million volts, the electrons would radi-
ate energy away as fast as they could
receive it unless proper compensations
were made.
Calculations indicated that such an
effect should he ohserved from the
electrons in the 100,000,000-volt beta-
tron in the G-E Research Laboratory
and that some of the radiation should
be of visible light. However, construc-
tion of the doughnut, which is lined
with silver, makes it opaque, thus pre-
venting any observation. Then it was
thought that perhaps some radiation of
very-short radio waves might be de-
tected, using methods developed for
war time radar. But again the search
was unsuccessful. Dr. J. S. Schwinger.
of Harvard University, calculated that
while there might be some slight emis-
sion in the microwave region, the max-
imum amount of energy would come
in the shortest wave lengths, either
visible light or the longer invisible
waves of infrared.
The synchrotron doughnut, how-
ever, is lined with a transparent layer
which is electrically conducting like the
silver layer and carries away unwanted
electrical charges as they accumulate.
Recently a G-E laboratory assistant,
Floyd Haber, happened to notice a cu-
rious spot of light inside the doughnut
while the synchrotron was operating.
After checking to assure that every-
thing was working properly, the physi-
cists in charge of the project deter-
mined that this was actually radiation
from the electrons themselves as they
moved around in their circular path.
An intense magnetic field, from the
large electromagnet which surround
the doughnut, keeps them to this orbit.
Electron light travels out in a beam
half a degree in diameter, tangent to
the orbit and ahead of the electrons.
Thus, an observer looking at the
doughnut from a point in the plane of
the orbit, sees light from the electrons
approaching him, but cannot see the
light in any other part of the tube.
Because of the curvature of the dough-
nut, the spot is distorted. General Elec-
tric is now preparing a modified
doughnut with a flat quartz window
through which the effect may be bet-
ter seen. This will permit any part of
the radiation that may fall in the in-
visible ultra-violet part of the spectrum
to be photographed as quartz, unlike
glass, is transparent to these rays.
landing light system
Fog and other conditions of poor
visibility, which have been severe han-
dicaps to commercial flying, may be
overcome by a radically new system of
runway approach lighting that has suc-
cessfully passed its preliminary trials.
The system, known as Ail-Weather
Approach Lighting, is based on a fun-
damentally new concept of the problem
of providing to the aircraft pilot vis-
ual indication of the runway location
regardless of visibility conditions. It
employs, in addition to the conven-
tional units, two new light sources con-
trollable in intensity over a great
range, which at maximum brightness
can penetrate a thousand feet of the
densest fog.

itself under all conditions, without
glare, requires a range of light inten-
sities of many millions to one. Visi-
bility conditions vary from bright sun-
light with heavy ground obscuring fog
to clear moonlight with all the inter-
vening situations of different amounts
of fog mixed with different amounts
of light. The new system does this and,
furthermore, for the worst fog condi-
tions, it provides flashes of light of
such great intensity that they might be
likened to lightning strokes pointing
out unmistakably the runway ap-
proach.
The complete all-weather approach
lighting system consists of three parts:
the approach line, the runway desig-
nators, and the high-intensity runway
lights.
A single row of two entirely new
types of lights, called flash and blaze
units, extends out from the runway
for a distance of 3225 feet. This is the
approach line and points the way to
the runway available for use. This row
of lights consists of 36 each of the
flash and blaze units, making 72 in all.
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued from page 46)
Alternate flash and blaze units are
spaced close together at the outermost
end (where they are most needed) and
farther apart near the runway.
The flash unit employs a krypton-
filled quartz tube about the size of a
cigarette. It is equipped with tungsten
electrodes, which have high heat-re-
sisting properties, fused into enlarged
end chambers. When about 2000 volts
are impressed on the tube and the gas
ionized, a discharge of capacitor-stored
energy occurs through the quartz tube.
The discharge produces a white light
of astounding brightness. By control
of the stored energy discharged
through the tube the brightness can be
controlled from a relatively low value
to as high as nine million candlepower
per square inch. At the high value the
lamp is nine times brighter than the
sun, which has at the earth's surface a
brightness of one million candlepower
per square inch. A polished-parabolic
reflector concentrates the output of the
krypton lamp, when at maximum
brightness, into a beam of 3.3 billion
candlepower.
The second member of the pair of
new lights is the so-called blaze unit.
This is made up of six tubular lamps,
each about two feet long and a half
inch in diameter, fitted with a special
electrode and filled with neon. Neon
lamps have not heretofore been con-
sidered as susceptible to intensity vari-
ation. However, by variable electronic
control of the power supply, these
blaze units can be operated at different
brightness levels. These lamps resem-
ble the familiar neon tubes and give
off, at the lower intensities, the charac-
teristic red light. At higher intensities
the color shifts towards white, al-
though red is still dominant.
The 72 krypton and blaze units, al-
ternately spaced in a line extending
two-thirds of a mile from the runway,
provide an approach-line lighting with
the flexibility required to suit any visi-
bility condition. At times of worst vis-
ibility, such as a ground fog in the
daytime, the approach line is operated
with the krypton and blaze units flash-
ing at their maximum intensity. At the
other extreme of the visibility scale,
i.e., on clear nights when only a rela-
tively faint approach line is desired so
as not to produce glare, only the blaze

Should Know About Bearing Functions

TRACTOR FRONT WHEEL in which both thrust
and radial loads are carried on single row Timken
Bearings. From whichever way the load may come,
it will be handled with minimum friction and wear.

APPLICATION of Timken Bearings on the worm
shaft of a worm gear drive. The load on the worm
shaft bearings, due to the operation of the worm, is
primarily thrust. There is considerable radial load
however, arising from the separating force of the
gears and also possibly from overhung driving loads.
This is another application for which the tapered
toller bearing is ideal.
1.
HOW TO CARRY
COMBINATIONS OF
RADIAL AND THRUST LOADS
Practically every bearing application in equip-
ment of all kinds involves the carrying of radial
and thrust loads in varying degrees. These draw-
ings show how Timken Tapered Roller Bearings
effectively perform both functions.
Because it is a roller 'bearing, the Timken
Bearing can carry the heaviest loads. Because
it is a tapered roller bearing it can carry both
radial and thrust loads — separately or in any
combination.
From whichever direction loads may come, its
tapered design enables the Timken Bearing to
carry them all with full efficiency and safety.
The cost and complication of a separate type
of bearing for each kind of load are eliminated.
Bearing housings and mountings are simplified
— with savings in cost, weight and space.
The more you learn about Timken Bearings
now, the better prepared you will be to solve
any bearing problems you may encounter in
the future.

units are turned on. They are burned
continuously at their minimum bright-
ness level of 100 candlepower. The de-
gree of reflective density, i.e., fog, con-
trols the intensity used.
Between these two conditions the
krypton and blaze units can be used
in such combinations of intensities as
to suit the occasion. At all times the
object is to provide sufficient light to
assure positive visual identification
but not enough to blind the pilot when
landing.
The second part of the system, the
runway designator, consists of an as-
sembly of neon (red) and zeon
(green) luminous tube elements form-
ing either a green arrow or a flashing
red cross. The green arrow indicates
that the runway is clear for landing,
while the red cross shows that it is
closed. During instrument weather the
designator is a last-moment safety sig-
nal to the approaching aircraft.

intervals. 10 feet out from both sides
of the runway borders and producing
candlepowers up to 100,000. This is
one hundred times the candlepower of
the semi-flush runway lights in com-
mon use, and nearly three times that of
the high-intensity runway light used by
the Air Force.
In good weather requiring only the
top element, the emitted light is in two
directions, along the runway, but with
some scattered light. In thick weather,
when higher candlepowers are used, all
emitted light is severely restricted to
the direction of approach. This pro-
hibits background lighting and prevents
lighted haze or fog curtains behind
each light that would reduce perception
of the next light in the line.
The color of the lens for the runway
lights is chosen by the position of the
unit along the runway. Clear light is
used along the outermost section of the
runway, and yellow indicates to the
pilot the last 1500 feet. When used
as range lights at the very end of the
runway, the lenses are colored green.
It is expected that air crashes result-
ing from poor landing visibility will
be cut by as much as 90 per cent upon
the adoption of the all-weather ap-
proach lighting system.

STARTING THE YEAR OFF RIGHT
e+t*fi*te council
With the advent of a new school
year, the student societies in the
Engineering School are shaking off
the summer's accumulation of dust
and getting plans under way for the
year. One organization that is
worthy of note in this respect is the
Engineering Council, which is made
up of representatives elected from
the student body as a. whole, and of
delegates from each of the student
societies. If the schedule of events
that they are planning comes off
with the success they hope it will,
this should prove to be an interest-
ing year in so far as the little ex-
tras, which help to make up college
life, are concerned. Their first proj-
ect was a dance—King Cole's Court
—which they jointly sponsored with
Tau Beta Pi, national engineering
honor society. The success of this
first undertaking leads us to believe
that the Council will have a year of
worthwhile accomplishments.'
The matter of collecting class
dues has always been a problem
since a class treasurer is not elected
until the senior year. This year the
Council has inaugurated the system
for collecting class, fees for caps
and gowns at graduation, and funds
for other events by selling an Ac-
tivities Card at the beginning of the
school year. This card is then used
as a pass to the various events
throughout the year. The system
seems to be a good way of taking
care of several difficult problems at
one time.
There are other problems, how-
ever, that the Engineering Council
should investigate. Foremost among
these is the parking of bicycles
in the Engineering Arch and in
front of East Engineering Building.
These bicycles create a serious prob-
lem in keeping the sidewalks clear
for pedestrian traffic. Some days the
East Engineering area is so clut-
tered that you have to move bicycles
to one side to be able to get into the
building. The Engineering Council
should take up this problem with
the University and get adequate fa-
cilities provided.

The object of going to college,
we are told, is to obtain an educa-
tion that cannot be obtained else-
where. In the pursuit of an educa-
tion, however, many students so
diligently concentrate on "book-
learning" that they entirely overlook
another aspect of education: that of
associating with and learning to
know and appreciate their fellow
students.
The Engineering School offers an
excellent opportunity for this "other
side of education" in the student so-
cieties. These societies offer pro-
grams that are so varied that it
seems likely that at least one should
offer activities that appeal to the
many-sided interests of the engi-
neering student.
The student chapters of the na-
tional engineering societies offer an
opportunity for the student engi-
neer to meet and hear leading men
in his field. What these men have
to say concerning engineering in the
field should certainly benefit any-
one who goes to listen. Besides the
actual academic aspect of these so-
cieties, the friends and acquaint-
ances that one makes are likely to
be of value later on.
For those who are not content
with the more or less passive mem-
bership in the student professional
societies, there are such activities as
Sigma Rho Tau, the engineering
speech and debating society, and
of course The Michigan Technic,
the student engineering publication.
The few hours a week that would
be utilized by most students in these
activities would never be missed
from their studies, and would be
beneficial to the student not only as
an individual but also as a citizen.
On behalf of the students of the
College of Engineering, we should
like to take this opportunity to thank
the taxpayers and the Legislature of
Michigan for the new additions to
our campus that are now in the
process of completion. Their erec-
tion was greatly needed to accom-
modate the vastly increased enroll-
ment at the University.
The new wing that was added to
the East Engineering building was
a virtual necessity since the Engi-
neering enrollment, like that of the
other colleges in the country, has
grown from 2070 in the fall of 1941
to 3844 for the fall semester of
1947. With this great increase in
students, the Engineering classes
were crowded beyond capacity.
Now, with the addition of this new
wing, classes have been reduced in
size to a point where they can be
handled more efficiently by the in-
structor.
The new wing now accommodates
the entire Electrical Engineering de-
partment with a few rooms allot-
ted to the Aeronautical Engineer-
ing department. Prior to this, the
Electricals occupied less space in
the West Engineering Building,
than they did when the department
was first organized.
The space vacated in West Engi-
neering by the Electricals has been
taken over by the Mathematics and
Mechanical Engineering depart-
ments. When the Electrical labora-
tories in the Wrest Engineering
Building and in the Electronics
Building are moved into the new
wing, that space will be used for
Mechanical and Marine Engineer-
ing laboratories.

SILICONE PROGRESS
Increasing Uses Found
for Amazing
Organosilicon Products
A surface finish that sets new standards
in durability? Stove and heater finishes
that withstand high temperatures with-
out cracking or discoloration? An oil
that flows at 120 below zero and does
not ignite at 575 F? These are just a
few of the possibilities—and realities—
of silicone chemistry.
dominant, while the undesirable char-
acteristics are recessive or completely
eliminated.

Organosilicon chemistry dates back
almost a century. But only in recent
years did General Electric begin investi-
gating silicones for industrial uses. With
the war, the amazing heat- and cold-
resistant properties of silicone products
found several important applications
(like silicone rubber gaskets for super-
chargers). And now, with a new plant
completed at Waterford, N. Y., General
Electric silicones can begin to flow in
quantity to many types of industries.
WHAT THEY ARE
Just what are silicones? General Electric
silicones are products of research-
highly versatile synthetics derived by
"crossing" organic and inorganic sub-
stances. The combination results in an
entirely new and prolific family, in
which the virtues of each parent are

A silicone's basic chemical structure
is a silicon-oxygen molecule derived
from satid. The insertion of organic
groups into this purely inorganic sili-
con-oxygen combination endows it with
plasticity, flexibility, and workability,
without appreciably lessening its in-
herent virtues of heat, chemical and
weather stability.
WHERE THEY GO
Where can these products of G-E sili-
cone research be applied? Here is a list-
ing which indicates some uses, by
categories:
1. SILICONE GREASES: Filling com-
pounds, dielectrics, ball-bearing and
stopcock lubricants, and vacuum-sealing
compounds.
2. SILICONE OILS: Aircraft hydraulic
systems, brakes, fluid couplings, manom-
eters; damping liquids; dielectric heat
transfer mediums; diffusion pump liq-
uids; and mold release agents.
3. SILICONE RESINS: Electrical insula-
tion; paints, enamels and similar pro-
tective and decorative finishes; plastics,
and adhesives.
4. SILICONE RUBBER: Gaskets for oven
doors, searchlights, vacuum chambers,
refrigerators, capacitor bushings; coated
cloth for diaphragms and insulating
tapes, and de-icing applications.

5. DRI-FILM* WATER REPELLENTS:
Liquid compositions for treating paper,
cloth, plastics, asbestos, glass, ceramics,
powders, and leather.
• At General Electric the doors to
silicone research have been swung wide.
Possibilities for further development are
virtually unlimited—awaiting only the
imagination, knowledge, and skill of
today's and tomorrow's chemists. For

partment, General Electric Company,

The progress made in the field of organosilicon chemistry is only
a prelude to that which can be expected in the near future.
Young technical men of today—and those seeking a fascinating
branch of chemistry toward which to direct their studies for

opportunities for endeavor offered by organosilicon chemistry.

When the Roman fleet tried an amphibious oper-
ation at Syracuse, they ran into a problem of
high temperature condition that completely non-
plussed them. Archimedes, according to legend,
burned them up by focusing the sun's rays on them
with mirrors.
Modern problems of operation at high tempera-
tures are solved quite simply by using molybdenum
steels. Their creep strength and excellent prop-
erties at elevated temperatures assure good per-
formance when the heat is on.
We will be glad to send detailed information
concerning the types of molybdenum steel suitable
for operation at elevated temperatures.

It is anticipated that the present de-
pendency of the United States on for-
eign sources of quartz crystals used
for optical and electronic devices will
be eliminated as soon as the Naval Re-
search Laboratories, Washington, D.C.,
complete installation of equipment for
synthetic production of the material.
Developed in Germany, the process
consists of the growth of crystals from
quartz seeds placed in a steel pressure
bomb containing a solution of silica,
sodium hydroxide or carbonate, and
water. Heated to 350 to 400 degrees
Centigrade, pressures generated inside
the bomb are believed to reach 2,000 to
3,000 psi.

ALUMINUM BRAINS FOR THE ASKING
Some day you are going to want to know something that
you won't have learned in college. And won't find in books.
You are going to consider using aluminum for some
purpose where the engineering isn't all spelled out for
you. You'll want facts about aluminum that you can
apply to your problem; and guidance in using them.
When that happens, remember to call on the brains
that have stored up more knowledge of aluminum than
you can find anywhere else. For 59 years this brain has
been gathering facts and experience in making aluminum
useful in thousands of ways.
We are talking about the cumulative corporate brain
of ALCOA . . . Aluminum Company of America. When
it goes to work on your problem, the particular kind of
knowledge needed is sure to be found in one or more of
this brain's many parts ... in the minds of the scien-
tists, engineers, plant men and salesmen who make up
this corporate brain of ours.
Their metallurgical experience, their counsel on
design, their intimate knowledge of aluminum fabrica-
tion and finishes ... all yours for the asking. Aluminum

Let's start at the ashes ... The plant is gone, the
records are gone, all orders are canceled. That
much you can see with your own eyes. But losses
are actually far greater — losses you must "see"
with your mind.
There is the loss in replacement — for, regard-
less of insurance it is impossible to replace de-
stroyed buildings and equipment today at original
cost. There is the loss of an industry to the com-
munity; loss of jobs to employees; frequently loss
of life. And remember lost customers whom no
amount of indemnity will ever bring back. Most
of all, remember this — regardless of insurance,
2 out of every 5 burned-out businesses never
resume operations.
All of this can happen — but it need not ever
happen. For there is a system of Grinnell Pro-
tection for every kind of fire hazard, ready to
control fires quickly, effectively, at the source, no
matter where fire strikes. If property is unpro-
tected against fire, owners are paying through
insurance for Grinnell Protection — why not
have it?

german secrets
American corporations have been
reaping the benefits of German tech-
nological processes and scientific in-
ventions for more than two years. The
Office of Technical Services has been
gathering, classifying, and microfilm-
ing German documents and patents
since the end of the war. These invalu-
able papers, taken intact from German
research laboratories, are available to
any company in the United States for
a fee of from three to four dollars.
To date nearly half a million copies of
75,000 original technological reports
have been sold by the Office of Tech-
nical Services.
Some of the reports are considered
so valuable that several large Ameri-
can concerns have offered as high as

(Continued from page 8)
$20,000,000 for exclusive rights to the
documents. To prevent destructive mo-
nopolies, however, the Federal govern-
ment has decreed that all of the cap-
tured data be made available to anyone,
regardless of who or what he repre-
sents.
The immense job of classifying and
photographing these secrets is far from
completed and it is estimated that
about 400,000 more documents have
yet to be processed. So far, the sales
have added approximately $1,500,000
to the Federal Treasury.
chemical torch
Blowing a flame in excess of 2,000
degrees Fahrenheit with the human
breath is an accomplishment made pos-
sible by the Super Jet Blow-Torch.
Utilizing an inexpensive fuel pill, the
light weight torch furnishes an in-
tensely hot flame which will burn for
about ten minutes per loading, leaving
work clean and without residues.
The completely portable torch weighs
only a few ounces and is ready for use
without pre-heating. A small brass tube
supports the brass cup which receives
the pill fuel. The handle, made of
nickle-plated steel, is air-cooled and the
mouth tube is made of clear, flexible
plastic.

COUNTERBORING OF BEARING HOUSINGS
lositive and permanent shaft
alignment is a vital factor in many
machines. Whether you get it or not
depends on the bearings on which
the shafts are mounted.
You can be sure of getting it by
using Timken Tapered Roller Bearings
at shown in the drawings, because of
their tapered design; line contact of
rolls and races; and precision adjust-
ability to compensate for wear.
Furthermore, by the use of Timlcen
Flanged Type Bearings, counterbor-
ing of bearing housings is unneces-
sary, because no internal backing for
the bearings is required. The hous-
ings are bored straight through and
the ends faced to receive the flanged
bearing cups. Since it is much easier
to face this external surface accu-
rately than to keep the faces of
counterbored shoulders absolutely
square with the center line of the

MORTIMER E. COOLEY
DEAN EMERITUS
1855-1944


Editor's Note: This article, composed
of excerpts from the recently published
memoirs of the late Dean Mortimer
Elwyn Cooley entitled The Scientific
Blacksmith, is the first in a series of ar-
ticles which are to deal with the early
history of the College of Engineering.
Dean Cooley came to the University of
Michigan in 1881 and zvas appointed
Dean of Engineering in 1904. He was
actively engaged in shaping the admin-
istrative policies of the Engineering
College until his retirement in 1928, as
Dean Emeritus.
When I was added to the faculty
of the University of Michigan instruc-
tion in engineering was being given
within the Department of Literature,
Science, and the Arts by the great
"triumvirate" whose names will never
he forgotten by Michigan engineers:
Charles Ezra Greene, J. B. Davis, and
Charles S. Denison. Professor Pettee
was also teaching mining engineering,
although there were not many students
in the course and no degrees were
given in it at that time. Civil engineer-
ing had been taught for twenty-eight
years. In 1881 there were twenty-five
students; there had been more in pre-
vious years, and the following year
more than sixty students were en-
rolled. Instruction was given in the
old south wing of University Hall.
There was no engineering building and
no engineering laboratory. Surveying
was taught in the field, and there was
laboratory instruction in chemistry.
Meager as this faculty, student body,
and course of instruction appear today,
they were far in advance of what was
being done in many schools at that
time.
Scientific instruction was in its in-
fancy at the beginning of the nine-
teenth century and was available in
only a few American colleges. Engi-
neering instructions were unknown.
The usual method of instruction was
by lectures, supplemented only rarely
by experiments, and these were per-
formed entirely by the teachers, not
by the students. The University of
Michigan was the first university in
the United States to offer real labora-
tory facilities and to require laboratory
by
MORTIMER E. COOLEY
courses of its students. When the
Chemical Laboratory at Michigan was
opened in 1856, it was the only labora-
tory built and equipped for the pur-
pose in America.
From the very beginning, engineer-
ing schools of this country were based
upon a definite and consistent plan. The
first two years of the four-year are
spent mainly in the fundamental
sciences of chemistry, physics, mathe-
matics, and mechanics. In the earlier
years, general training in the humani-
ties such as history, foreign languages.
English and English literature, and
rhetoric, was given. The last two years
were spent in the applications of the
fundamental sciences to theoretical
and practical problems. This course of
stud}' has been overlaid with so many
specialized courses that the load upon
the engineering student has not only
been made continually heavier, but
courses in the humanities have neces-
sarily become more and more re-
stricted in order to make room for
specialized courses. This, to me, is re-
grettable.
By date of first graduates, the Col-
lege of Engineering of the University
of Michigan stands sixth. Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute was founded in
1824; Union College started a course
in civil engineering in 1845, thereby
becoming the first academic institution
of the general type to "graft" an engi-
neering course upon an already estab-
lished school. Harvard opened Law-
rence Scientific School in 1846; Yale
started its scientific school in 1847;
in 1861 it became the Sheffield Scien-
tific School. Dartmouth's Chandler
School of Science opened in 1851.
Michigan established an engineering
professorship in 1853 and had two
graduates in 1860. Columbia School of
Mines was opened in 1864; Dart-
mouth's Thayer School of Civil En-
gineering was begun in 1867; Cornell
introduced civil engineering in 1868
and mechanical in 1870; the Princeton
School of Science was opened in 1873.
From the very beginning, as has
been said, the degree in engineering at
Michigan, first conferred in 1860 on
Frank L. Krause and William Minto,
has been based upon four years of uni-
versity work. That the requirements
have not increased in nearly ninety
years does not seem to me to indicate
great progress, certainly not compar-
able to that of the Law School and the
Medical School, which sixty years ago

Prior to the war, television was a
subject discussed primarily among en-
gineers and physicists. Several televi-
sion transmitters had been built in the
East, but these served primarily to help
increase the store of knowledge con-
cerning the peculiarities and character
istics of image transmission. The rapid
development of electronic equipment
during the war years helped to increase
the store of knowledge concerning the
use of high frequencies to such an
extent that the present-day receivers
are far superior to pre-war models.
These receivers embody the latest de-
sign features, provide excellent per-
formance when properly installed, and
in general place in the hands of the
public a superior product.
During the war years, the American
public was subjected to considerable
sales propaganda and high pressure
salesmanship regarding the future of
television. Some of this propaganda
was good. Some of it was bad and left
the public dismayed. At any rate tele-
vision became one of the most dis-
cussed topics of the day. The public
was led to believe that this new marvel
of the century would replace many
forms of entertainment. It may, some-
day, but at the present time is still
relatively unexploited as such. The
public was given the impression that
large movie-size screens would adorn
the family parlor. The terrific build-up
resulted in the marketing of costly re-
ceivers which the average American
could not afford to purchase.
The present situation facing the
television industry may be likened to
the position that radio found itself in
some twenty years ago. When radio
was in its infancy, crystal sets were
popular in spite of the fact that Junior
couldn't so much as let out a squeal on
Sunday afternoon lest he disturb dad,
who for the past hour had been fever-
ishly maneuvering the cat's whisker at-
tempting to tune in his favorite sym-
phony. So today, the public must be
satisfied with small screens just as the
citizenry of the late twenties was satis-
fied with crystal sets. We cannot ex-
pect large-size television screens in the
home today, no more than twenty years

ago we could have expected high-
fidelity reproduction. The public in
general loses sight of the fact that
television is an expensive industry. Re-
search is being carried on continually
in an attempt to further perfect the
present-day receiver. Production costs
are high since receivers are not actually
produced on a mass production basis.
Until television becomes as popular as
radio, we cannot expect to see high-
class television broadcasts. Television
broadcasts are expensive ; to meet these
expenses program sponsors are a ne-
cessity, and sponsors are not willing to
risk the required financing until a
large viewing public is assured.
Receiver Types
The majority of post-war television
receivers can be divided into two
groups: direct-viewing and projection
type. In the direct-viewing receiver the
image is seen directly from the face of
the picture tube. This receiver is lim-
ited in application since the size of the
picture can be no larger than the face
of the picture tube. Small picture tubes
are inexpensive, but the eyestrain from
viewing a small picture for any period
of time is detrimental. Unless a nine-,
ten-, or twelve-inch picture tube is em-
ployed, considerable eyestrain will be
felt on the part of the viewer. At the
present time receivers are available
with fourteen-inch and twenty-inch
picture tubes; however, the twenty-
inch tube probably represents a prac-
tical limit. A further increase in the
size of the tube is accompanied by con-
siderable manufacturing difficulties,
plus a greater danger to life should
anything happen to the structure of
the tube. It has previously been com-
puted that a twelve-inch tube has a
pressure of seven-eighths of a ton act-
ing on the screen. If by some chance
the tube should break in the vicinity
of the viewer serious injury might be
caused to that individual.
In the projection-type receiver a
small picture tube is employed; the
image is magnified optically and is then
projected onto a direct-viewing screen.
The projection-type receiver has been
a step forward since it consists of a
relatively inexpensive optical system
and at the same time provides suffi-
cient enlargement of the picture to be
viewed from greater distances and by
a greater number of people. Fig. 1
shows an optical projection system for
obtaining large images. This system
is rather simple since it employs the
use of several lenses in front of the
picture tube and permits the image to
be projected onto a large screen. This

factory because of the low transmis-
sion efficiency of the intervening
lenses. To increase the illumination
available at the screen, voltage as high
as 30,000 volts are used on the acceler-
ating anodes of the picture tube. The
electron gun is also made smaller and
narrower in order to obtain a sharper
picture on the face of the picture tube.
With the above-mentioned modifica-
tions a projection tube having a diam-
eter of seven-and-one-half inches is
capable of producing a picture of fair
quality on a screen twenty feet by fif-
teen feet.
leaving from any point on the picture
tube will, after reflection, converge to
a single point on the viewing screen.
This action is shown in Fig. 2, where
rays 1, 2, 3, all of which originate at
the same point, finally converge at a
point on the screen. These correcting
lenses are usually made of molded
plastic. The plastic lenses are not only
cheaper to manufacture but have
proved to be far superior to glass
lenses since the light-scattering effects
are lower and the transmission of light
is greater.
With the use of the Schmitt system

Fig. 2. Schmidt principle as employed in television receivers
Another system of image projection
is based on the Schmitt principle of
light reflection which was originally
developed for the astronomical tele-
scope. This system has an increased
efficiency of light transmission which
is due to the use of fewer reflecting
surfaces. The original system as first
developed for the astronomical tele-
scope consisted of a photographic
plate, a spherical reflector, and correct-
ing lens. As the light ray from a dis-
tant star entered the telescope it was
reflected onto a photographic plate and
resulted in bright clear images. The ap-
plication of the Schmitt principle, as
used in television, is shown in Fig. 2.
Due to spherical aberration (a type
of optical distortion) it becomes nec-
essary to use a correcting lens between
the reflected image and the screen. The
lens is so shaped that all light rays
can be obtained on a screen eighteen
inches by twenty-four inches. Large
screen theater television equipment has
been produced and used successfully.
The optical part consists of a brilliant
picture tube operating at 70,000 volts,
a thirty-inch reflecting mirror, a twen-
ty-two-and-a-half-inch glass for cor-
rection of spherical aberration and a
screen fifteen by twenty feet.
Power Supplies
In the majority of pre-war televi-
sion receivers it was customary to use
a 60-cycle supply line, in conjunction
with the necessary high-voltage trans-
formers and conventional rectifier cir-
cuits, to obtain the high direct-current
voltages required to obtain good defi-
nition on the screen. This voltage is
seldom less than 2500 volts and usu-
ally ranges between 6000 volts and 12,-
000 volts on direct-viewing receivers,
and up to 30,000 volts on projection-
type receivers. If a conventional trans-
former type power supply were used
to produce 30,000 volts, the equipment
would become bulky and would require
the utmost care in handling. Charged
condensers in such a circuit would be
dangerous and some type of automatic
discharge circuit would be necessary.
A high-voltage interlocking system
would be necessary to prevent working
on the set while the high voltage was
on. These power supply dangers can
be eliminated by using a system which
cannot deliver an appreciable amount
of current before the voltage drops to
a more or less harmless value.
In this type of circuit the voltage is
generated by an oscillator operating at
a frequency between 30 kilocycles and
500 kilocycles. The oscillator has a
tank circuit in its plate and an exten-
sion on the plate circuit to raise the
voltage to the required value. The a-c
voltage produced in the tank circuit is
then rectified, filtered and supplied to
the anode of the picture tube. By us-
ing frequencies between 30kc and 500
kc for the oscillator, the filter net-
work is simplified since filter condens-
ers may be smaller and chokes elim-
inated. With the use of a single tube it
is possible to obtain from 8000 volts to
10,000 volts in this manner.
Frequency Range
At the last reallocation by the FCC
the commercial television band was
placed in the spectrum from 44 mega-
cycles to 216 megacycles. These fre-
quencies have been so allocated as to
afford thirteen television channels.
There will be a maximum of light
channels assigned to any metropolitan
area. The majority of well-designed
television receivers will provide thir-
teen tunable channels in order to elim-
inate the necessity of retuning the re-
ceiver when it is moved to a new loca-
tion. These thirteen channels may be
obtained by use of a multi-position ro-
tary switch with the individual tuned
circuits. The primary advantage of us-
ing thirteen tunable channels is that
each channel may be tuned to obtain
the best results with the particular
channel characteristics, and may be
permanently aligned and peaked for
optimum performance.
Some receivers will provide eight
tunable channels and each channel will
be tunable to two or more different

BROOKLYN

R. G. SKERRETT
Editor's Note: The following article
was condensed for THE MICHIGAN
TECHNIC by Le Roy IVeinstein from
a series by R. G. Skerrett which ap-
peared in the September and October,
1947, issue of Compressed Air Maga-
zine. All illustrations are courtesy of
Compressed Air Magazine.
Today, a few months short of the
semi-centennial celebration of the con-
solidation of the five boroughs that
comprise Greater New York, the citi-
zens of two boroughs, Brooklyn and
Manhattan, are witnessing the comple-
tion of the largest twin-tube, under-
water vehicle highway in the country.
The amalgamation of the boroughs
was one of the main factors that led to
the building of this underwater high-
way, the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel.
Manhattan, while small in size and
population, has retained its historic
financial and business domination. As
a result every working day the island's
population is greatly increased by the
tremendous influx of people from the
neighboring boroughs and the outlying
counties. The concentration of traffic in
rush hours has put a severe strain
on the existing traffic facilities. The
Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, planned to
accommodate 16,000,000 vehicles an-
nually, will prove a great aid in allevi-
ating the rush hour congestion.
The preliminary plans for the tun-
nel were drawn in 1929, but it was not
until 1936 that funds were made avail-
able through the New York City Tun-
nel Authority to begin advanced inves-
tigations. In 1940, eleven years after
the first plans were drafted, funds for
construction were made available by a
Reconstruction Finance Corporation
loan to the city. On October 28, 1940,
ceremonial groundbreaking took place.
Many of the construction features
of the three older subaqueous vehicu-
lar tunnels in New York City, the
Holland, the Lincoln, and the Queens
Mid town tunnels, are included in the
plans for the Brooklyn-Battery Tun-
nel. The new tunnel will consist of two
tubes, one for northbound traffic and
the other for southbound traffic, allow-

with a minimum of interference.
The 9117-foot stretch of underwater
roadway presents a difficult problem of
ventilation. In principle, the ventilating
system will be similar to that devel-
oped for the Holland Tunnel with
such modifications as experience has
shown to be desirable. Fresh air will be
distributed to the driveway area of
each tube just above curb level from
flues spaced at suitable intervals on
each side. The flues, in turn, will con-
nect with a fresh-air duct that runs un-
der the roadway. Foul air will be
drawn up through ports in the ceiling
and transmitted to the exhaust stacks
of the ventilation buildings. Twenty-
seven blower fans and twenty-six ex-
haust fans will change completely the
air in the tunnel forty-two times an
hour.
Probably the most difficult task in
tunnel construction is the initial "hol-
ing-through." Different types of rock
and clay formations were tunneled by
various methods, most of which were
operated under pressure. The sand-

much as thirty-two pounds-per-square-

The method of cutting through

process is the shield. It weighs 400

A steady stream of midshipmen in
"suntans" poured into the Naval
Academy on June 19, to report for
the sophomore cruise. They were as-
signed rooms in Bancroft Hall and for
two days were given a taste of Acad-
emy life and discipline. After a day
and a half of instruction, the morning
arrived when midshipmen would board
the ships they had seen off in the dis-
tance. For many, it was their first trip
to sea; for some, it was a first look at
the ocean. By noon of the 21st, the
Oregon City and the Albany, both
heavy cruisers, had weighed anchor
and started on the long run down the
Chesapeake.
Shortly after 2400 hours, the two
cruisers hit the swells off Cape Hat-
teras, but it was not until 0600 Sunday
morning that midshipmen noticed
tions. Generally, three instruction peri-
ods were held, each one hour long.
Instructors were officers, chief petty
officers, or, occasionally, seamen; the
period was often conducted in that
part of the ship that the subject con-
cerned. Seventy-two periods covered
gunnery and ordinance, navigation,
communication, engineering and dam-
age control. A gunnery exercise con-
sisting mainly of tracking was held
once a day. This was an intensified
method of instruction since, for the
greater part of the cruise, the midship-
men manned the same battle stations as
assigned at the outset of the cruise.
Another important means of instruc-
tion was the system of watches which
took the midshipman from the breezy
lookouts atop the bridge to the hot en-
gine and fire rooms below. Rotation of

U.S.S. Albany viewed from El Morro Castle in San Juan, P.R.
their ship's peculiar rolling tendency.
Many realized they should not have
made the boasts they did ashore.
At sea, the typical day began at
0530; by 0830, midshipmen had been
to cleaning stations, morning chow,
muster, and were readv for instruc-
watch groups occurred every four days.
During the nine-day journey to Pan-
ama, there was a great deal to see. The
two cruisers passed almost within
hailing distance of Miami and Palm
Beach. One-and-a-half days were
spent off the Florida Keys and a short
time later the northern coast of Cuba
appeared to the south. While off the
Cuban coast, both ships took part in a
coordinated submarine attack for the
benefit of the midshipmen. Near the
Dry Tortugas, the ships' course was
changed to south-south-east and the
ships passed within sight of Cayman
and Jamaica Islands. Finally, on the
morning of July 1st, our ships stood
off the coast of Panama and by 0900
were secured to the piers at Cristobal
in the American Zone.
The men aboard were anxious to go
ashore. Many headed toward small
shops and found prices rather high,
but the native clerks were quick to cut
prices. In a short time, many of the
men had grasped the art of bargaining
and found that prices could be halved
once and perhaps twice. Others went
on to the USO, which, as in the re-
maining ports, became the center of
activity. Tours were arranged cover-
ing the naval bases and canal installa-
tions on both the Atlantic and Pacific
sides of the Isthmus, the Pacific tour
allowing a 5-hour liberty in Panama
City. Though it rained almost the en-
tire time, it did not dampen anyone's
spirits. However, the five days were
short and on the seventh of July the
ships set out for Trinidad.
Three days later the Island of Trini-
dad rose out of the water to the east
like the humps of a great half-sub-
merged mountain range. Passing by-
several small islands, the ships entered
a partially enclosed bay, where the
docks of the U.S. Naval base were
located. From the base, it was seven
miles to the Port of Spain, the only
town of major size on the island.
Transportation consisted of old buses
driven by natives who raced them
along the left side of narrow, winding
roads. In town, the USO held the
spotlight. Two dances were held there
and a consensus of opinion was that
they were far better than those in
Panama. Tours were arranged to take
midshipmen to Murocais and Manza-
nilla Beaches and the Great Pitch
Lake. On the 15th of July the ships

William Paynter, '22E
Upon graduation from the Univer-
sity of Michigan in 1922, William
Paynter took a job as a statistical and
field engineer on electrical maintenance
and construction in industrial plants.
In 1925, he was employed by the Ford
Motor Company where he worked on
the design and manufacture of a 30,-
ws
000 kva turbo-generator. Upon com-
pletion of this project in 1926, he
worked as engineer on electrical plans
and specifications for various manu-
facturers. In 1933, Mr. Paynter acted
as a consulting engineer with a con-
sulting firm and was responsible for
all electrical engineering details. From
1934 to 1940, he served as associate
electrical engineer in charge of all elec-
trical engineering for the Department
of Regional Planning of the Tennessee
Valley Authority. At the present time
he is serving as production engineer
for the large electrical design division
of the TVA, which is engaged in the
design of facilities for the generation,
transmission, distribution and utiliza-
tion of electric power.
Mr. Paynter is a member of the
AIEE and an associate member of the
Illuminating Engineering Society. He
has served as chairman on various
committees of the AIEE and was sub-
committee member of the American
Public Health Association. He is a
registered electrical engineer in the
state of Ohio.
Thomas C. Hanson, MSE '34
Thomas C. Hanson graduated from
the University of Michigan in 1934.
After graduation he worked as a
draftsman for several engineering con-
cerns in Detroit and there became an
instructor in the Department of Civil
Engineering at the University of De-
troit. In 1937, Mr. Hanson left Detroit
to teach in the Civil Engineering De-
partment at Purdue University. In

Although Mr. Hanson has held vari-
ous positions in engineering societies it
appears that he has a facility for
acquiring the position of secretary-
treasurer for any engineering society.
In 1944, he was secretary-treasurer of
the American Society for Engineering
Education and the Michigan section of
the American Society of Civil Engi-
neers. Mr. Hanson also served as sec-

Franz P. Zimmerli, Detroit metal-
lurgical engineer and chief engineer of
the Barnes-Gibson-Raymond division
of the Associated Spring Corporation,
has been awarded the Albert Sauveur
Award. The award is conferred by the
American Society for Metals and was
first awarded in 1934 to perpetuate the
memory of Dr. Albert Sauveur, world
renowned professor of Harvard Uni-
versity. The American Society of Met-
als made the presentation of the scroll

The award has been given to Mr. Zim-
merli for "his basic research in the
field of shot peening to increase favor-
able stresses in the surfaces of metallic
parts." Mr. Zimmerli's process consists
of a system whereby metallic surfaces
are dynamited with small steel balls
with velocities approaching those of
rifle bullets. Hy this process the sur-
face is hardened and its fatigue life
and durability are increased. Mr. Zim-
merli is a graduate of the University

Since the year 1927, the University
of Michigan swimming teams have
compiled a record second to none in
both Big Nine and national competi-
tion. Over the span of years from
1927 to 1947, Coach Matt Mann has
produced teams which have won the
Big Nine title fifteen times.
The names of the engineering stu-
dents who help to make the present
tank squad a threat for championship
honors are familiar to all who follow
college swimming. Harry Holiday,
Dick Weinberg, Charlie Moss, and Bill
Upthegrove are the men who form the
backbone of the Michigan team.

Holiday is one of the outstanding
backstrokers in college circles today.
He may be destined to participate in
the 1948 Olympic Games. Harry hails
from Tucson, Arizona. He attended
the Mercersburg Academy in Pennsyl-
vania and then turned to Matt Mann
at the University of Michigan. Before
entering the service Harry established
two Michigan pool records which are
still maintained on the record charts in
the University of Michigan Natator-
ium. In 1943 he was clocked at times
of 0:57: :0 and 1:31: :5 in the 100 and
150 yard backstrokes.
Returning to school in 1946, he
helped Bob Sohl and Dick Weinberg
turn in a sizzling 2:50: :5 record in the
300 yard medley. Since he is a senior
in the Chemical Engineering Depart-
ment, this will be his last year in
college competition.

Team to be chosen next spring, is Dick
Weinberg. Dick collaborates with
Harry Holiday and Bob Sohl as a
member of the medley relay team
which holds three of the four possible
world's records in the 300 yard event.
Dick came to the University of
Michigan from Arthur Hill High
School of Saginaw. While still in high
school he won many swimming events
and honors. In 1945 he set a state rec-
ord for the 50 and 100 yard free style.
Dick has won many swimming
events since he has come to Michigan,
but he considers his most exciting ex-
perience to have taken place last sum-
mer when he traveled with the team
to Texas and Los Angeles for the
N.A.A.U. outdoor meet and to Hawaii
for the Keo Nakama Invitational Meet.
In Texas the medley relay team set a
world's record, only to better it at Los
Angeles and further advance the rec-
ord at Hawaii. The Keo Nakama Invi-
tational Meet is an event held every
summer in honor of Keo Nakama, a
famous Hawaiian swimmer. Dick, a
sophomore mechanical engineer, is 19
years old, stands 5'11" tall and weighs
175 pounds.
charlie moss
The Academy at Mercersburg not
only produced a great backstroker in
Harry Holiday, but also sent breast-
stroker Bob Sohl, diver Gil Evans, and
freestyler Charlie Moss to the Univer-
sity of Michigan. Moss resides in
Wheeling, West Virginia, and is a
junior in the Mechanical Engineering
department. As a student at the
Mercersburg Academy Charlie was
crowned National Prep-School Cham-
pion in the 200 yard Free Style event.
Last summer, he also participated
with the Michigan team in the N.A.-
A.U. outdoor meet and the Keo Na-
kama Invitational Meet. He returned
to school this fall and alternates in
both the free style and breast stroke
events.
bill upthegrove
Bill Upthegrove is 19 years old,
stands 6'1" and weighs 175 pounds.
He is also a sophomore and is enrolled
in Metallurgical Engineering.
While Bill was in high school he
held the state record for the 100 yard
breaststroke. In 1946 he was elected to
the first All-American High School
Swimming Team. Here at the Univer-
sity of Michigan Bill has pledged the
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity.
torn smith
One of the more promising new-
comers to the University of Michigan's
swimming team is Tom Smith, a fresh-
man in civil engineering. Tom comes
from Coraopolis, Pennsylvania, where
he captured many honors in sports.
As a member of the U.S. Navy,
Tom saw overseas service in China and
Japan. He was discharged in 1946 and
entered the University in 1947. It will
be about a year before the team will
be able to utilize the strength of Tom
Smith, because of the conference rule
that he has to have one year of resi-
dence at the University before being
eligible to compete in varsity athletics.
ralph Johnson
Another newcomer of great promise
is Ralph Johnson, a chemical engineer.
He is 18 years old, stands 5'10" tall,
and weighs 160 pounds. A graduate of
Lane Tech High School in Chicago,
Ralph came to the University in the
Spring of 1947, bringing many swim-
ming laurels with him. He captured
the Illinois State Championship for the
100 yard backstroke in 1945. He was
also the Chicago City Champion for
the 40- and 50-yard backstroke events
from 1943 and 1945.

PRESENTS
frank
Frank D. Amon first saw the light
of day on December 21, 1924, beating
Saint Nick to Akron, Ohio by four
days. After spending the first four
years of his life in the tire capital of
America, Frank moved to Weston,
Massachusetts, where he has resided
since. He had the unique experience
of attending one school from his kin-
dergarten days to his high school grad-
uation, the Weston Public School sys-
tem being so arranged. Five years of
math in high school attested to his in-
terest in engineering and when Weston
graduated its thirty-five seniors in June
of 1943, Frank's name was fourth
from the top.

Frank D. Amon
An interest in automotive engineer-
ing led Frank to the U. of M. all the
way from Massachusetts in June of
1943, and he is not sorry he made the
trip. He is an example of that rare
species of student whose grades do
not suffer in the transition from high
school to college; his, in fact, increased.
His principal campus activity is the
presidency of the student chapter of
ASME. Frank modestly claims that
he was forced to accept the office
against his better judgment, but his
ability and interest in the organization
are evidenced by the fact that he was
elected president less than two years
after he attended his first meeting in
1945. He was a member of the TECH-
NIC in 1945, aiding the circulation
staff, and somehow also found time to
be a student assistant in the Engineer-
ing Mechanics department during the
same year.
In the spring of 1945 he was se-
lected by the Chrysler Corporation for
participation in their cooperative job
training program. The program in-
volved working in the Chrysler labora-
tories for three month periods and con-
tinuing school in the interim. Frank
divided his time between the machine
shop, the physical testing labs, and the
carburetor lab in three three-month pe-
riods, during the spring and fall of
1945 and the summer of 1947. Al-
though he claims he liked the work im-
mensely, he evidently had a bit too
much automotive engineering thrown
at him. Upon completion of his last
"hitch" at Chrysler, he decided to de-
vote all his engineering efforts to ma-
chine tool design.
After much prompting, Frank con-
fessed that he became engaged last
New Year's Eve, while in full posses-
sion of all his faculties, he assured the
interviewer. The lucky lady is from
Rochester, N. Y., and the wedding will
take place there next February. Frank-
is understandably anxious to finish
school as quickly as possible and set-
tle down, but would like to work for
a small or medium-sized company, spe-
cializing in machine tool design. He
expressed a desire to obtain a Master's
degree in M. E. after he has been
working a few years. Frank is a great
believer in practical experience to sup-
plement text-book-acquired knowledge.
His many hobbies include such va-
ried fare as hitch-hiking, politics, read-
ing (everything from the classics to
comic books) and just meeting and be-
ing with people. His 1936 'Terrable'
owned jointly with a friend was, he
confessed, the cheapest six-cylinder
car they could find in Detroit. It stands
as evidence of his continued interest in
automotive mechanics, since he and his
co-owner take it apart regularly. His
pet peeve is shared by many on campus
—the driving laws. If you would stay
on the good side of Frank, be you pro-
fessor or be you student, remember his
name after having been introduced.
Oh, yes, he's a bridge fiend, too.
prof lay
While thumbing through the scrap-
books of Professor Lay, we were
amazed to discover the vast number
of engineering accomplishments for
which he is responsible. Two of his
most important are his research on the
streamlining of the automobile to re-
duce wind resistance and his research
on the comfort of automobile cushions.

Walter E. Lay
Professor Walter E. Lay of the
Mechanical Engineering Department
was born in Fulton, Michigan, in 1889.
He entered the University of Michi-
gan in 1910 and received his Bachelor
of Science degree in 1915 from the
Mechanical Engineering Department.
After graduation he became an instruc-
tor at this university. During the pe-
riod of the first world war, he had
charge of the auto mechanics training
school and trained some 1250 men.
Following the path of Assistant Pro-
fessor and Associate Professor, he re-
ceived his full professorship in 1930.
From 1923 to 1938, Professor Lay
conducted many experimental and re-
search projects and acted as a consult-
ing engineer for many well-known con-
cerns. These projects have sometimes
lasted over two or three years, and the
largest one cost nearly $35,000. He has
contributed numerous papers to the
SAE and other engineering societies
as well as to the technical journals.

ISpeedway for new telephones
Here you see the "wind-up" of nearly two miles of
overhead conveyor lines designed by Western Electric
engineers for their vast new telephone-making shop
in Chicago. As finished telephone sets near the end of
the assembly and inspection line, an electronic
selector unerringly sorts out six different types,
directs each type down the right one of the six differ-
ent chutes for packing and shipping. Not one second
is wasted. This conveyor system is capable of han-
dling 20,000 telephones per day.

Faster way to dry cable ^
Before getting its protective lead sheath, telephone
cable must have every bit of moisture removed from
pulp insulation and paper covering. To gain greater
efficiency than the horizontal steam drying method,
which used to take 24 hours, Western Electric en-
gineers designed a battery of cylindrical vacuum
ovens which are lowered over reels of cable. Electric
current is then passed directly through the wires of
the cable, heating it to 270°E. As much as 6 gallons
of water is driven out of the insulation in just an
hour and a half!
Engineering problems are many and varied at Western Electric, where
manufacturing telephone and radio apparatus for the Bell System is the primary
job. Engineers of many kinds—electrical, mechanical, industrial, chemical,
metallurgical—are constantly working to devise and improve machines and proc-
esses for mass production of highest quality communications equipment.

radar on
merchant ships
Radar, the electronic marvel which
played such an important role in the
recent war. is being successfully ap-
plied to peace-time maritime naviga-
tion. The Radiomarine Corporation of
America reports that its 3.2-centimeter
postwar shipboard radar has been in-
stalled on eighty-one vessels since the
first of the year.
Due to its high resolution and defi-
nition, this set is extremely useful in
narrow waters and is thus well adapted
to service in our inland waterways. A
special model for river use features a
one-mile scale which makes it possible
to spot buoys, land contours, light-
houses, towboats, and other objects on
a twelve-inch diameter circular scope.
Commercial shipboard radar em-
ploys the PPI (Plan Position Indica-
tor) type of scope which presents to
the operator a maplike representation
of a circular area with the ship at the
center. This is accomplished roughly as
follows. The sort of light caused by an
electron beam impinging upon the
screen of the cathode ray tube moves
at a constant rate in a matter of a few
millionths of a second radially out to
the edge of the scope. It then snaps
back almost instantaneously to the
center.
Coincident with the start of the
sweep is the transmission of a very
short pulse of high frequency energy
from the highly directional antenna.
As this pulse hits a target along its
path, an "echo" pulse is reflected back
to the antenna, producing a bright spot
on the trace. Since the distance from
the center of the scope to the bright
spot is proportional to the time the
energy takes to travel out to the target
and back, it can be read off as distance
between the ship and the target. Elec-
tro-magnetic energy travels at the
speed of light, so that the operation
consumes only a few microseconds
(millionths of a second). This testifies
to the intricacy and precision of the
apparatus.
The antenna and the trace revolve
slowly at about ten rpm so that tar-
gets in any direction can be picked up.
The position of the bright spot on the
scope will then indicate both direction
and range. Due to the "persistence" of
the screen the target indications fade
only slightly between sweeps of the
trace. By flipping the range-selector
switch to various positions, the length
of the trace can be made to represent
one-and-one-half, five, fifteen, or fifty
miles.
Rings appear on the screen at cer-
tain distances to make it easier to esti-
mate the range of a target. The azimuth
scales are used to determine the exact
bearing of a target. If desired, the
radar can be used with a gyroscopic
compass so that North is always at the
top of the scope. A suppressor control
minimizes the obscuring of targets
during a heavy sea and the "FTC,"
or fast time constant, increases target
contrast in heavy rain or snow. These
sets can see targets at much shorter
ranges than their wartime predecessors"
Even the stern of the ship is indicated
on the scope.
Radar used on Great Lakes vessels
serves four main purposes:
(1) as a collision preventer.
(2) as an aid to piloting, particu-
larly in entering harbors or narrow
river passages.
(3) as a position finder.
(4) as a storm warning in cases
where heavy rain squalls and snow
storms may be noted on the scope and
the distance and movement plotted.
The U.S. Engineer Corps' survey
boat Cherokee of the Ohio River
Division, is using Radiomarine radar
to chart this river. A radar navigation
chart is being prepared from radar
photographs assembled in Mosaic form.
An automatic camera is attached to the
radar instrument and adjusted to pho-
tograph images on the scope at regu-
lar intervals.
The prints are then matched to pro-
duce a continuous strip-map reduced
to the scale of standard navigation
charts. On the assembled charts, engi-
neers add dotted lines indicating the
channel to be followed, together with
figures showing the depth of the water,
and brief identifying descriptions of
important landmarks. Correlation of
the information from the radar scope
with that from these radar charts will
be easier than with the conventional
navigational charts.

AS these youngsters can tell you ... as you yourself
_TjL know... it doesn't cost much to take pictures for
pleasure. Only a few cents for a snapshot...
It costs even less—much less—to take many of the
"pictures" business and industry want, because in
these functional applications photography is often-
times almost entirely automatic.
Good example of this inexpensiveness is Recordak.
Reproducing automatically ... on economically mi-
nute areas of microfilm ... it copies checks, waybills,
and other similar documents for a fraction of a cent
apiece.
Second example ... photographic recordings. Auto-
matically made, they reduce to a minimum the cost
of "reading" the fluctuations of gauges, instruments,
production control equipment.
Third example ... Transfax Process ... inexpensive
in another way, since, unlike any other process, it
reproduces complex drawings, charts, layouts with
photographic accuracy and completeness directly on
metal in a matter of minutes.
These are only three of the ways in which photog-
raphy can save time and money. In our new booklet—

granted degrees to those who took two
half years of lectures. But that is an-
other story.
In educational circles the accusation
is made that engineering students have
no "cultural" background. While I
agree with this, I also agree with
Hotchkiss of Rensselaer, who once
said: "Culture comes from many
sources. It comes vastly more from
the teacher than it does from what he
teaches. I believe it is perfectly possi-
ble to take a course in Latin from a
teacher who is possessed of little or no
culture and go out of that course with
no culture. I believe it is possible for a
man lo take a course in calculus under
an inspiring, cultured teacher, and to
go out of that course in calculus with
a rare wealth of culture." In the early
days of engineering at Michigan, be-
fore complete specialization took place,
the engineering teachers were remark-
able for the breadth of education and
vision which was theirs. Wood was
such a man; so was Charles Ezra
Greene who succeeded him.
I was convinced that mathematics
for engineers should be taught in rela-
tion to the subject of engineering, and
I made up about one hundred problems
dealing with the coefficient of friction
and similar matters, all of them prac-
tical problems. I called in the mathe-
matics teachers and questioned them
concerning their types of problems,
all of which were theoretical. I asked
the professors to look over my practi-
cal problems; many of the professors
could not work them. This wrought a
change in the type of advanced mathe-
matics instruction given engineering
students, and the character of the
illustrative problems was altered.
One day not long after this I was in
Professor Greene's office and he
seemed depressed.
"What's the matter, Professor
Greene?"
"I have been subpoenaed by the
court," he said. "I have to be there at
ten o'clock and that means I will have
to miss my class at eleven." In those
days a good teacher would do almost
anything to avoid missing a class.
"I'll take it over," I said. "I'm free
at eleven."
"You'll take my class." He smiled at
me, disbelieving, for it was one of his
advanced courses.
"Certainly."
He could not very well decline. I
took to his class some of my mathe-
matical problems, selecting those which
dealt largely with civil engineering
matters. I sent the whole class to the
blackboard and assigned each student
a different problem, explaining as I
did so the principles involved. The
students went to work. About half an
hour later they had the problems
solved and were ready to demonstrate
them; just then Professor Greene re-
turned, doubtlessly having rushed to
get back. He took over the class. He
had to hear the demonstrations of the
problems, and he did not have the
slightest idea of what some of them
were about. The class realized this
and enjoyed the session very much. I
always have thought I put one over on
Greene very properly.
When the engineering course was
set off as a separate department in
1895 Professor Greene was made dean.
He served in this capacity until his
sudden death in the fall of 1903. All
of us were desolate at his going. He
was the keystone of our faculty, the
man to whom we went with our prob-
lems and from whom we received in-
spiration and guidance. When I wras
asked to take his place I refused point-
blank. I did not feel equal to filling his
shoes; besides, I loved teaching and
research and had no desire whatever to
assume the administrative duties of
the deanship. The greatest satisfaction
of my life was direct contact with stu-
dents. I loved those boys. I loved them
when they entered as freshmen with
only the haziest idea of what engi-
neering meant or why they were taking
it, and I loved them when the)' were
seniors and had learned all that we
could teach them and were ready to
try their wings as engineers. I did not
want to give this up. I refused the offer
three times: late in January, 1904, the
Regents sent for me and informed me
I had been appointed dean. It was
stated that it was my duty to the
Department of Engineering. With re-
luctance I accepted the appointment.
Professor J. B. Davis had been ap-
pointed associate dean at the same
time. He shared the responsibilities,
and I had the benefit of his wisdom
and experience.

Why communications get better all the time
Youk VOICK girdles the globe in one-seventh of a second.
It travels at 186,000 miles per second—the speed of light
— thanks to the telephone and radio. And by television, so
do the pictures of any event as it occurs.
What has made this blinding speed possible? What has
given us these "ringside seats"... to see, to hear, to share
in the headline news of the day?
The answer: Greater knowledge of electronic waves and
better materials to harness them. For example, the vac-
uum tube-heart of radio or television—depends upon the
greatest possible absence of air or other gases—a high vac-
uum. Most of the air is pumped out before the tube is sealed.
Then a tiny bit of barium, called a "barium getter" is
flashed inside of it by electricity. This captures the remain-
ing air and gives a nearly perfect vacuum.
Unending research and engineering have also provided
finer plastics for insulation, purer graphite and carbon for
electronic devices . . . and a host of other basic materiab
that help shave the speed of communications to the tiniest
splinter of a second.
Producing these better materials am! many others—for
the use of science and industry end the benefit of man-
kind—is the work of the people of UNION Carbide.

surveying. He was beloved by students
and colleagues. At times he was gruff
in his actions, but he always had a
tender heart. For instance, he some-
times greeted a student in a rough
voice asking, "Well, what do you
want?" The boy, all atremble, could
not tell what he wanted without stutter-
ing from fright, and Davis would say,
"Come here, my boy," in a different
tone of voice. He would put an arm
around the boy's shoulder, lead him to
a chair, and say, "Lad, now what is
it that you want?" I am almost every-
day reminded of Davis by Pat. our big
German police dog. Pat barks vocifer-
ously when the doorbell rings; one
might think he was ready to chew the
visitor up. All the time he is barking,
however, his tail is wagging.
When J. B. Davis was ready for col-
lege he looked about and found that
the University of Michigan was one of
the least expensive schools to attend.
He started for Ann Arbor from New
Bedford, where his father was cap-
tain of a whaler. He walked most of
the way. As a student he roomed with

Professor Joseph Beal Steere. Dear
old Professor Steere died only recently,
having reached nearly one hundred
years of age. I called on him not long
before his death and found him sitting
in his library, feeble but as bright as
ever.
The father of Junius Beal, long-
time Regent of the University and an
Ann Arbor resident, owned a farm
out South State Street, and he per-
mitted Davis and Steere to raise pota-
toes on part of it. Tbey lived on the
farm, and Davis said that they fre-
quently lived for weeks at a time on
potatoes. Once I was walking witli
him down the east side of State Street;
we passed Willett's restaurant, long
since gone, and saw a sign over the
door, "Meals, 35c." Davis turned to
me and said, "When I first came to
Michigan I lived a whole week on
thirty-five cents."
No wonder the College of Engineer-
ing has grown into the outstanding
college it has become, enrolling nearlv
one-fourth of the students of the Uni-
versity of Michigan. The University
provided an unexcelled environment,
and the heredity of the College of En-
gineering was great, for this included
the traditions of four wonderful edu-
cators whose memory is honored in
plaques in an arch named for one of
them. These men have places in the
hearts of all engineers who knew
them: DeVolson Wood, Charles Ezra
Greene, Joseph Baker Davis, and
diaries Simeon Denison. Wood, who
devoted fifteen years to the establish-
ment of an engineering course and
who urged not only a five-year course
but a College of Engineering twenty-
five years before the Department was
separated from the Department of
Literature, Science, and the Arts, con-
tributed soundness and vision. The
three who came in 1872, Green, Davis,
and Denison, contributed, in turn, ex-
ample through leadership, affection,
and colorful personality. All of them
contributed devotion, scholarship, and
great personal and professional integ-
rity. In such a beginning only a num-
skull could fail to take pride. And en-
gineers are not numskulls.

ON January 26, 1946, newspapers
carried front page stories about the
new and amazing 100 million volt
"betatron". The heart of this instrument
that enables scientists to peer more
deeply into steel castings to discover
flaws, is a giant hollow glass "doughnut."
With the betatron, men in the field of
nuclear research have already made start-
ling discoveries in the investigation of
atomic energy.
The making of this giant glass tube called
for glass research knowledge and glass-
making skill of the highest degree. And
Corning was ready with the right com-
bination of both. Each of those "dough-
nut" sections you see in the picture had
to be built to the most exacting dimen-
sional tolerances.
Science and industry have learned to
expect Corning to come through with
the answer to any glass problem. For
instance, Corning produced the world's
largest piece of cast glass ... the 200"
telescope mirror for famed Mt. Palomar.
And when all other materials failed to do
the job of handling hot corrosive acids,
Corning made glass pipe and glass pumps
that work without a hitch or replace-
ment for years. Thermometer tubing
... miles and miles of it. . . with a bore
only 1/8 the diameter of a human hair is
just an everyday job at Corning.
With more than 50,000 different glass
formulae to draw on, Corning scien-
tists and glass workers have adapted
glass to thousands of different jobs
...some simple-,some as complicated
as the betatron. But in every instance
glass is used because it does the job best.
And you'll find after graduation that a
knowledge of glass may help you do a
better job. So why not keep Corning in
mind. We'll be ready to help you all we
can. Corning Glass Works, Corning, N.Y.

PROBLEM— You're designing a radio broadcast transmitter. The circuit
includes condensers and other variable elements which must be ad-
justed by the operator. You want to place these elements for optimum
circuit efficiency and where they will be easy to assemble, wire, and
service. At the same time, you want to centralize the control knobs at a
point convenient to the operator. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER
Use S.S.White remote control type
flexible shafts to couple the variable
elements to their control knobs. This
leaves you free to place both the
elements and the knobs anywhere you
want them. And you get control that is
as smooth and sensitive as a direct
connection because S.S.White remote
control flexible shafts are engineered
expressly for this kind of service.
• * •
This is just one of hundreds of remote
control and power drive problems to
which S.S.White flexible shafts pro-
vide a simple answer. That's why every
engineer should be familiar with the
range and scope of these "Metal
Muscles" for mechanical bodies.

channels. With this type of arrange-
ment realignment of the receiver will
he necessary whenever a set is moved
from one location to another.
Few receivers make use of a contin-
uous tuning device by which the whole
spectrum 44 mc to 216 mc is covered
by use of a variable condenser. The
continuous tuning device does not re-
quire a switching arrangement or an
elahorate coil system but has the dis-
advantage of tuning over a large por-
tion of the spectrum where there are
no stations. This system results in re-
stricted use of the usable portion of
the scale.
Service
One of the greatest problems of the
television receiver manufacturers has
been that of giving the public reliable
and honest service once the receivers
are in the hands of the owner. Some
manufacturers at present are giving
the customers the benefit of factory
service. On this basis the customer is
charged a flat rate for the installation
and for one year's service on the re-
ceiver. However, the majority of man-
ufacturers are convinced that factory-
controlled servicing will not be practi-
cal once a sufficient number of receiv-
ers are on the market to warrant com-
plete television service in a major area.
If the television industry places the re-
sponsibility of service on the radio-
serviceman, then it will become the re-
sponsibility of the manufacturers to
insist that servicemen obtain the neces-
sary know-how to perform efficient
service. Television receiver repair will
present many problems unlike any-
thing previously encountered by the
radio-serviceman and will require the
skillful and expedient use of high class
test equipment.
Improper installation of television
receivers has accounted for roughly
ninety per cent of all operational diffi-
culties encountered. A television re-
ceiver is not a radio set; it cannot be
plunked down in the corner of a room,
a piece of old wire attached for an
aerial, and be expected to perform at
its optimum. The focal point of the
service function is that a television re-
ceiver is sensitive precision instrument.
It might be likened to an expensive
camera where considerable care must
be taken in focusing to obtain the best
results.

tons and in the case of the Brooklyn -
Battery Tunnel has an outside diame-
ter of thirty-one feet, eight inches, and
an overall length of fifteen feet, ten
inches. In the tail of the shield a lining
ring is assembled and bolted to the pre-
vious one. When the leading ring is
bolted together and secured to one be-
hind it, the shield is shoved forward by
the action of twenty-eight hydraulic
jacks arranged vertically in a circle
just inside the shell of the shield.
The jacks, which are commonly op-
erated at a pressure of 5000 psi, exert
their thrust against the leading ring
and with that footing, push the shield
into the ground ahead. When the jacks
are extracted just enough space is left
between them and the leading ring for
the erection of tht next liner ring.
At each shove, the shield is advanced
the width of a liner ring, and one com-
pleted ring remains within the tail and
attached to the lining while the suceed-
ing ring is being assembled and added
to the tunnel lining. All or any number
of the hydraulic jacks can be brought
into action at each thrust, permitting
the shield to be steered upward, down-
ward, or to left or right. If there is any
deviation from the prescribed course, it
is checked by a surveyor before each
advance and corrected at the next
shove. By this system of control, the
shield can be guided on a curved path
if so desired; and by suitable means,
established as excavating proceeds, its
course is continually checked backward
to the surface where the line to be fol-
lowed is fixed by visible survey marks.
The preciseness of the work was
checked when a single hole was driven
on the tunnel axis to verify its close-
ness to the prescribed line. This explor-
atory drilling revealed that the axis of
the tube in question was within a quar-
ter of an inch true to grade and departs
only one-eighth of an inch from the
prescribed line for the axis.
Brooklyn and Manhattan will be the
immediate gainers when the Brooklyn-
Battery Tunnel is completed. Tributary
regions will benefit by means of motor
traffic relief. Furthermore, sections of
both boroughs situated close to the tun-
nel will find themselves profiting in one
way or another, as have property own-
ers, business enterprises and workers
located in the vicinity of the approaches
to the three older vehicular tunnels.

Immediately behind the rear face of the 400 ton shield an erector arm places a
liner segment in position for bolting to its neighbors. With the liner ring assembled,
hydraulic jacks force the shield another 32 inches toward Manhattan.

DUPONT^jL
ktiedt
For Students of Science and ^
/ Engineering
Development of dyes requires
both physical and organic chemistry
ducibility and storage stability. A sig-
nificant Du Pont contribution to the
production of vat dyes in optimum
physical form is called "turbulent flow
drowning." In this procedure, the color
is dissolved in strong H^SO, and then
diluted by a large volume of water in a
constricted tube. High turbulence is
maintained during dilution and pro-
duces uniform dye particles.
In this development the work of
physical chemists and physicists, aided
by electron microscopy, ultra-centri-
fuging, infrared and ultra-violet spec-
trometry and other modern techniques,
was of major importance.
The synthesis of a new dye in the labo-
ratory or even the development of a
manufacturing process from that syn-
thesis may still be a long way from the
realization of the full potentialities of
the new compound as a coloring mate-
rial. This is illustrated by the commer-
cial history of the exceedingly fast
bright blue dye indanthrone and its
halogen derivatives.
Indanthrone was the first known an-
thraquinone vat dye and has led ton-
nage sales of vat dyes in the U.S. since
its introduction, despite the commer-
cial use of well over 200 types. In 1901,
Bohn first synthesized indanthrone by
KOH fusion of 2-aminoanthraquinone,
but the yields obtained were in the
range of only 25-30 per cent. Because
of the industrial importance of indan-
throne, and the low commercial yields
obtained by the original fusion pro-
cedure, a great deal of research time
has been spent in its study.
Several U.S. patents record the fact
that Du Pont organic chemists have
made outstanding contributions in this

field, particularly by developing the
intercondensation of 2 moles of 1,3-di-
bromo-2-aminoanthraquinone and re-
placing the bromine by chlorination to
give 3:3'-dichloroindanthrone ("Pon-
sol"Blue).

* indanthrone

1,3-dibromo
2-aminaonthraqjmanC
This fixes the chlorine in the desired
positions to give a product with greater
bleach-fastness than indanthrone and
minimizes extraneous substitution that
always accompanies direct chlorination
of indanthrone. The commercial yields
of 3:3'-dichloroindanthrone now being
obtained by Du Pont are markedly
greater than those obtained by Bohn
and his workers.
It is just as important, however, that
a water-soluble dye be made in a phys-
ical form that gives optimum shade and
working qualities, such as perfect dis-
persion, freedom from specks, rapid re-

The conversion of laboratory findings
to a plant operation often presents

outstanding commercial success of

achieved through cooperation of Du

be-;r ran freely. One dance was held
at the officer's mess for a limited num-
ber of midshipmen and officers. Sev-
eral representatives from the schools
were present, including Dean Rea of
the University of Michigan, who was
traveling on the Oregon City. The
dance was the last event, and there
were few who were not happy to be
leaving the dust and sun of that south-
ern Cuban port.
On the 29th of July, the ships
headed out to sea, expecting to arrive
in Bermuda on the second of August.
Before the sun arose on that date the
cruisers were steaming up to anchor-
age across the bay from the town of
Hamilton. Because the island is so
small only a limited number of crew
and midshipmen were allowed to go
ashore, and, as a result, most of them
had but one day's liberty. The island
had quite a different atmosphere from
previous ports. Many of the people
were well-to-do and, consequently,
most of the island was well cared for.
There was a general feeling of "easy-
(Continued from page 36)
going." It must have affected the mid-
shipmen because a good many spent
their day at the beach, perhaps Coral
or Elba, where millionaires play. Those
buying souvenirs found prices set and
bargaining out of the question. All the
skill acquired in dealing with shop-
keepers before was useless. However,
if anyone had sufficient capital left
from previous buying sprees, the goods
were of far greater quality than the
watches with no works, false jewelry,
and other pseudo-goods that the men
acquired in Panama or Trinidad.
On Monday, August 5th, the cruis-
ers left the lazy island of Bermuda and
zig-zagged to New York City where
the midshipmen were to have their last
fling. On the 8th the lightship was
sighted, and the cruisers steamed into
the lower basin of the Hudson and
proceeded upstream at 15 knots
through a maze of tug boats, ferries,
and small craft. The Albany was finally
moored to a buoy off 92nd Street, and
the Oregon City to a berth further
down stream.
One tour of the Brooklyn Navy
Yard was conducted, the remaining
liberty days being free. Each section
was granted a forty-eight hour liberty
and a few managed to talk their way
into a second. Tickets for various plays
and radio shows were handed out.
Three midshipmen from the Albanv.
Jim Johnston from Michigan, Bill
Harkness from Northwestern, and
myself were selected as contestants on
the quiz show, "Give and Take." It
required all three to carry off the
prizes. Some spent their evenings on
52nd Street or downtown in Green-
wich Village. Some stayed at the big
hotels, others visited friends and rela-
tives. By the end of the five days the
average midshipman had almost enough
cash to take him home from Norfolk,
the port of disembarkation. But where
his wallet was light, his memory was
taxed with tall tales of the hot lati-
tudes, and his sea bag was loaded with
gifts and souvenirs to remind him of
the strange places he had been the
summer of his sophomore cruise.

There are no limitations on either
length of topic. The paper should,
however, contribute something new, in
fact or in treatment, toward theoreti-
cal or practical knowledge of some
phase of electrical engineering or
closely allied subjects. It is not ex-
pected, however, that a student paper
will contribute materially to engineer-
ing knowledge, but rather to the train-
ing and inspiration of future contrib-
utors. The papers should be as short
as the nature of the subject will per-
mit without detracting from their in-
terest or omitting vital information.
Those interested should examine the
E. E. bulletin board for further de-
tails and several sample papers. Com-
pleted papers should be turned in to
Professor Gault before February 20,
1948.
AIME
The Michigan chapter of the Ameri-
can Institute of Metallurgical Engi-
neers held their first meeting recently,
at which time Mr. George Timmons of
Climax Molybdenum Company dis-
cussed temper embrittlement. Plans
have been made for other speakers at
least once a month who will discuss
topics of interest to both chemical and
metallurgical engineers.
The first trip of the semester was to
Hoskins Manufacturing Company,
principal producers of resistance and
thermocouple wire. Great Lakes Steel
and Buick Motor Company are also on
the field trip schedule.
ASME
The ASME got off to a fast start at
a smoker held in the Union at the be-
ginning of the semester. Even with a
donut in one hand and a cup of coffee
in die other, it was possible for ASME
members to meet informally several
members of the Mechanical Engineer-
ing teaching staff. New members also
had an opportunity to learn of the past
work of the group and to become bet-
ter acquainted with some of the "ole"
boys.
On Wednesday, October 22, an or-
ganized meeting was held and the fol-
lowing officers were elected: Frank D.
Anion, president; Glen M. Majors.
vice-president; Donald Steibel, treas-
urer; Donald DeFrain, secretary ; John

65 screen tests

5S?e it made of gold, silver or
%^ "brass", a compact has to pass
a lot of "screen tests" on its way
from the earth to its user.
Ore is screened a score of times
before it becomes metal. Silica goes
through a battery of screens to be-
come a mirror. And talcum is
forced through a long series of fine-
mesh screens before it acquires that
caressing smoothness that is de-
manded by our exacting fair sex.
Yet, because this is America,
compacts, which are beyond the
means of women living in countries
that decry our free enterprise sys-
tem, are sold in dime stores, avail-
able to millions.
Roebling products play a leading
part in this mass production.
Roebling wire screens meet all ma-
terials under all conditions. In one
case they pass rocks as big as
melons. In another they reject dust
as fine as pollen.
Made of steel rods as thick as
your thumb, or woven of stainless
as fine as hair, Roebling screens
serve industry in a hundred ways —
on a thousand jobs.

given to Professor Lay's experiments
in the streamlining of automobiles.
With better roads came the demand
for more speed, and the manufacturers
responded in the only way they knew,
increasing the number of cylinders and
so increasing the rated horsepower.
Engineers began to consider seriously
what they had suspected for a long
time; that entirely too much power
was being expended in overcoming
wind resistance.
At first it seemed that wind-tunnel
tests would yield the information
needed. Here, at the University of
Michigan, under the leadership of Pro-
fessor Lay, advanced students plunged
eagerly into the task of making wood-
en models and setting them up for
tests in the University's big wind-
tunnel. After testing twenty-seven dif-
ferent car-body models, Professor Lay
was not satisfied with the results be-
cause the wind-tunnel models were
suspended in tbe air and did not take
into consideration the "ground effects."
THE TECHNIC PRESENTS
(Continued from page 22)
From the various data obtained a prac-
tical model of a streamlined car was
built and tested. It proved to have half
the wind resistance at the same speeds
and would consume 20 to 30 per cent
less fuel at sixty miles-per-hour.
Today Professor Lay belongs to
the National Society of Automotive
Engineers, National Research Council,
and the Highway Research Roard,
Academy of Science. He is also a
member of Tau Reta Pi and Sigma
Xi. a national research fraternity.
Even now Professor Lay, at the
age of 58, is contemplating new re-
search into the study of the alleviation
of muscular fatigue, a subject in which
he has great interest. We take pleasure
in recognizing one of the University's
truly notable men, Professor Walter
E. Lay.
pierre
One of our most interesting and
likeable senior engineering students on
the campus is Pierre Raynaud. Pierre
came to our university in June, 1945,
from Casablanca, Morroco, and has es-
tablished for himself an enviable rec-
ord here. By hard work and dili-
gent study and also by overcoming
many language difficulties, Pierre has
achieved the goal of all engineering
students, Tau Beta Pi membership.
Pierre Raynaud was born in south-
ern France in 1926, and at the age of
four he moved with his family to Cas-
ablanca. He attended the Lycee Ly-
autey grade school, and later the ex-
tension of the University of Algiers, at
Casablanca. Following in the footsteps
of his father, Pierre elected an engi-
neering education. At the University,
Pierre was educated in a highly theo-
retical manner because of the lack of
laboratories and technical equipment.
With the invasion of North Africa
Pierre found his studies interrupted.
He then discovered that his study of
English for the last seven years was
going to prove very useful. He ob-
tained a position as an interpreter in
a 302nd U.S. ordinance plant in North
Africa.

neering project has been completed with the help of K &amp; E.

Plasties where plasties belong—
using insulating and printing qualities


Our type of plastics, Synthane, has a combination of mechanical,
chemical, and electrical properties that fit it for a host of useful
applications. It is corrosion and moisture resistant, dense, structurally
strong, and may be easily worked. An excellent electrical insulator,
Synthane is extremely light (about )i the weight of aluminum).
A good example of the use of laminated plastics is this timing device
which uses Synthane for the cams in the timer. Heart of an automatic
system, the Cam Timer is designed to control the flow of exhaust
gases to a stack.
Aside from its outstanding insulating qualities, letters, numerals,
and symbols may be easily and clearly printed on Synthane by our
Synthographic process. Synthane Corporation, Oaks, Pennsylvania.

In 1943 the French government
awarded Pierre Raynaud a scholarship
to study engineering in the United
States. It was not until the end of the
war, however, that Pierre was ahle to
take advantage of his scholarship. Can-
didates for the scholarship were chos-
en by a competitive examination. The
contract with the French government
provided for a four-year education in
return for five years of service to the
government.
On April 9. 1945, Pierre arrived
in this country and reported to the
French cultural attache in New York.
He was given his choice as to what
field of engineering he would take and
what university he would attend. His
first choice was Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology, but at that time
that university had no room for for-
eign students. Pierre then chose the
University of Michigan because he
thought it to be the most representa-
tive of mid-western colleges. In June
of 1945, he began his study in the Me-
chanical Engineering curriculum.

Pierre Raynaud
In 1946, due to the lack of funds, the
French government cancelled his schol-
arship. Determined to continue his
studies here. Pierre found it necessary
to work 40 hours a week besides
carrying 16 credit hours. He later ob-
tained, through the International Cen-
ter, three small scholarships to offset
the loss of his former one. At the pres-
ent time he works as a waiter at the
Lawyers Club, and is carrying three
graduate and three undergraduate sub-
jects. He will receive his Bachelor of
Science in February and hopes to ob-
tain his Master of Science degree in
August. Upon his return to Casa-
blanca, Pierre is obligated to serve one
year in the French Army because of
compulsory military training which
now exists there.
Pierre's father served as a Mechan-
ical Engineer in the French Navy and
later, in the second World War, he
was employed by the French Air
Corps. He is now a consultant engi-
neer working for the French govern-
ment checking equipment given to
France by the United States. When
Pierre is released from the Army he
intends to enter the engineering pro-
fession with the aid of his father. Be-
cause of his talent for engineering and
his genial personality, we are certain
that the future holds wonderful things
in store for Pierre Ravnaud.

The series of pictures illustrates the
change in flow patterns produced by
the rotation of a cylinder in a moving
stream. The speed of rotation increases
from upper left to lower right. It is this
change that is responsible for the trav-
erse force known as "lift."
When the pattern is produced by a cyl-
inder, it is known as a Fletcher Rotor,
once used on sailing ships. A similar
change in pattern is produced, without
actual rotation, by air foils. A like flow
pattern caused by a rotating schere is
responsible for the curve of a baseball.
The Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of the

to undergraduate students as well as provide space and facilities for research

USE G-E PERMANENT
MAGNET PGWER
Nursery toys and Super-Fortresses have
something in common. It's their use of
General Electric permanent magnets.
And there are thousands of other prod-
ucts in many and varied industries
which employ these remarkable magnets
to exceptional advantage.
What is it that makes G-E permanent
magnets so readily adaptable to the
needs of motors and generators, control
devices, games and novelties, radio and
communication equipment, meters and
instruments, and mechanical appli-
ances? The answer is G-E Alnico, one of
the most powerful magnet materials in
the world. Special Alnico assemblies
have been designed to lift as much as

4,450 times the weight of the Alnico
permanent magnet.
G-E Alnico as originally discovered
was a modification of an alloy designed
to resist scaling at high temperatures.
It consisted of aluminum, nickel, and
iron. The magnetic properties of this
alloy proved more interesting than
its chemical properties, however. Rec-
ognizing these properties as probably
originating from the solution and pre-
cipitation of AINi compound in iron,
the alloy was modified and heat-treated
accordingly. The result was the series of
permanent magnet alloys which are now
called the Alnicos.
G-E Alnico permanent magnets are
manufactured by sand-casting, precision-
casting, and sintering. Sand-cast Alnico
is most economical and is generally used
for magnets weighing over 15 grams,
unless the magnetic or physical proper-
ties of sintered Alnico are required.

Heat Ireotina cost G-E Alnico
1. J^%7 MfciUI , IIL»
Sintered Alnico is best adapted for mass
production of smaller magnets, or for
special applications needing more uni-
form flux distribution and higher phy-
sical strength. For shapes that are im-
practical or impossible to sand-cast or
sinter, the precision-casting method may
be used to advantage.
But regardless of the method of pro-
duction, the end is the same . . . shaped
pieces of ferromagnetic material which
once having been magnetized, show defi-

nite resistance to external demagnetiz-
ing forces. Unlike quenched steel mag-
nets, G-E Alnico permanent magnets
will retain their magnetizing force for
very long periods of time ... actually for
centuries with normal use! Truly G-E
Alnico magnets are permanent magnets.
In the comparatively short time that
these powerful G-E magnets have been
available, an ever-increasing field for
their use has opened up. Today the
total production of Alnico in this coun-
try surpasses 6,000.000 pounds annually.
Tomorrow this figure may be greatly in-
creased as young engineers of vision pro-
ceed in research and development of
this family of alloys.
G-E Alnico magnets are
produced in many shapes

A message to students of metallurgy and metallurgical
engineering, from
DR. ZAY JEFFRIES
Vice President of the General Electric Company and
General Manager of the Chemical Department
There are many opportunities for further metallurgical research
in the highly important field of permanent magnets. We are en-
gaped in the development of better and less costly permanent
magnet materials. You who plan a career in metallurgy or chem-
istry will find the possibilities at General Electric unusual and
enticing.

Why transportation gets better all the time
Over six hundred miles an hour in the air, four hun-
dred on land, one hundred on water—these are the speeds
that are telescoping time and space today.
The world shrinks and shrinks . . . Distances that were
once days, weeks, months away are now a matter of hours.
What things behind the scenes have brought these whirl-
wind developments in transportation?
There's chromium, for one. Basis of stainless steel, it
toughens planes, cars, trains . . . insures added safety . . .
yet makes them lighter throughout.
There are special carbon brushes necessary to the opera-
tion of some thirty motors and generators used in the con-
trol apparatus of modern transport planes. These brushes
must be built to stand up under the pressures of high alti-
tude flying.
Colorful plastics, too, lend their lightness, give their
strength, safety and serviceability.
And gasoline now gives more power—has more get-up-
and-go—takes you farther at less cost . . . thanks to new
vitalizing chemicals.
Producing these better materials and many others—for
the use of science and industry and the benefit of mankind
—is the work of the people of Union Carbide.

Research
at Westinghouse
Today, research is one of the most «""
important of engineering functions.
The field is broad and of absorbing interest. In
the Westinghouse Research Laboratories, entire
departments are devoted, to research in the follow-
ing fields: Chemistry, Metallurgy, Mechanics,
Electrophysics, Electromechanics, Electronics,
Magnetics, Insulation.
The opportunities offered to engineering gradu-
ates lie in two spheres of activity:
Pure Research—investigation of physical laws
with the aim of extending purely scientific knowl-
edge, without the specific practical application
of that knowledge in mind.
Applied Research—solution of specific manu-
facturing problems, development of new appa-
ratus, discovery of new and better materials for
which there is a need. G-ioois
Here are opportunities limited m^
only by your own imagination ^r
and ability. To learn more

Two atmospheric sample bottles are shown installed on one of the German V-2
rockets being fired by Army Ordnance at White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico.
The Department of Engineering Research, under sponsorship of the Meteorological
Branch of the Signal Corps, is conducting meteorological experiments in the upper
atmosphere through the use of high altitude rockets. Part of this work is the sampling
of the upper atmosphere to determine its constituency. The sample bottles, having
previously been evacuated, are opened at the desired altitude and subsequently
sealed. After the flight, the bottles are recovered and the contents analyzed. A
knowledge of the constituency of the higher atmosphere is of importance because
of its connection with the gas constants, molecular diffusion, mixing and chemical
properties.

f-m telephone
A multiplex radio link has replaced
telephone cables between Paris and
Montmorency, France. One of the main
features of the system, which has been
in use since January, 1946, is a fre-
quency-modulation inverse feedback
link in the transmitter. The link has
given results comparable to ordinary
telephone cable.
lightning studies renewed
The continually harassed Empire
State Building has long since proved
that lightning can strike in one place
many times. General Electric scientists
are renewing their study of lightning
striking this structure. Photographic
studies simultaneously timed with oscil-
lographic recordings, will be resumed
and new sensitive recording devices
will be used to secure data heretofore
unobtainable.
Of those strokes observed, about
80% originated at the top of the build-
ing and progressed to the clouds, some-
times taking as long as 1/lOOth of a
second to complete the trip. This is the
reverse of the more familiar cloud-to-
ground stroke and results when the
building builds up an excess of positive
charge from the earth.

lightning arrestor
It was noticed that some of these
building-to-cloud strokes did not pro-
duce thunder. Of considerable scien-
tific interest was the discovery that
lightning strokes usually consist of a
more or less steady flow of current,
and that in one particular case the cur-
rents persisted for as long as one and
one-half seconds. Superimposed on
this current may be several current
pulses which reach values as high as
150,000 amperes but which last only a
few millionths of a second.
vhf aircraft
transmitter
Private plane owners are hailing the
development of a compact, inexpensive
radio transmitter for use in small air-
craft, recently developed by General
Electric engineers. To be used for
transmission to airport towers and ra-
dio range stations, the set weighs only
two pounds, nine ounces, and consumes
but one-tenth the wattage required for
conventional private plane transmitters.
The tiny radio is the first transmitter
designed to operate on one of the six
new frequencies allotted by the Fed-
eral Communications Commission for
exclusive use of private aircraft radios.

Rubber accelerators lead the way
to new agricultural fungicides
Vulcanization accelerators for rubber
and agricultural fungicides would seem
to have little in common. But the wide
variety of interests of men in the Du
Pont organization sometimes result in
outstanding developments from such
apparently unrelated products.
A rubber chemist suggested to a plant
pathologist that derivatives of dithio-
carbamic acid, NH2-C(S)SH, parent
substance of a well-known group of rub-
beraccelerators, be tested asinsecticides.
His suggestion was based on the possi-
bility that sulfur combined in this form
might be more effective than free sulfur,
a recognized insecticide.
Entomologists and plant pathologists
investigated the fungicidal as well as
the insecticidal properties of this
group. One of the first compounds test-
ed, sodium dimethyldithiocarbamate,
(CH3)2N-C(S)SNa, even in dilutions
of 1:30,000, was found to be a powerful
fungicide, but somewhat injurious to
plant life.
This led to a systematic program of
research including other metallic salts,
the ethyl, propyl, butyl, phenyl, and
other aryl derivatives of the dithiocar-
bamates and thiuram mono- and di-
sulfides, and the related compounds
made from ethylenediamine and mor-
pholine. In this phase of the work, or-
ganic chemists played an important
role by suggesting various derivatives
and preparing them for tests. Later, in
cases where proper dispersion and ad-
herence of the compounds to plants were
important, the skill of physical chemists
was called upon.
In general, the compounds of greater
chemical stability were found to be less
effective. Fungicidal efficiency dimin-
ished with increase in size of alkyl radi-
cal, and as aryl radicals were substituted
for alkyl. Thus the unusual situation
developed that with the exception of

Transmission that is virtually static-

because the extremely high frequencies
at which it operates (121,500 to 127,-
900 kilocycles) are practically unaf-
fected by thunderstorms and other ad-
verse weather conditions. A range of
approximately 50 miles over level ter-
rain from a height of 5,000 feet is
claimed for the new device. Other ad-
vantages include ease of installation, a
minimum of controls, and quick acces-
sibility for repair work.
cleaning glass by
electron bombardment
Electronic bombardment has solved
a problem in the production of preci-
sion mirrors. Used for television and
certain other purposes, the mirrors are
coated on the front instead of the back
in order to prevent double reflection.
They are surface coated with alumi-
num by evaporation in a vacuum cham-
ber.
Before aluminizing it is first neces-
sary to remove all dust and moisture
from the surface. If the surface is
heated to dry it, the aluminum will not
adhere, so the glass is placed in a metal
holder which is at a high positive po-
tential with respect to a nearby tung-
sten filament. After dusting the sur-
ace, the chamber is closed and the fila-
ment is turned on. Electrons emitted
by the filament bombard the glass at
speeds of several thousand miles a sec-
ond removing all moisture. This action
heats only the surface, which quickly
cools, allowing the metal film to be ap-
plied successfully.
"photo-silver" now
mass-produced
Engineers of the Eastman Kodak
Company have announced the develop-
ment of a new system of making sil-
ver-nitrate crystals. The new system,
which is the first development of its
kind in fifty years, uses machinery
which produces the crystals continu-
ously, and dries them in a few minutes.
Previously it took several days to dry
the crystals.
Several 75-pound ingots of pure sil-
ver are dissolved in nitric acid, and the
resulting liquid is stored in tanks. The
solution is pumped from the storage
tanks to crystallizers which keep the
solution constantly stirring. Silver ni-
trate crystals form and grow in the
bottom of the tank, and are drawn off
and placed in drying baskets. The per-
forated drying baskets are whirled,
driving off most of the moisture.
The crystals are redissolved in dis-
tilled water and recrystallized. Upon
removal from the whirling baskets a
second time, the crystals are placed in
a rotary drying drum, from which they
emerge completely dry. The dry crys-
tals are shipped in stainless steel barrels
to the photographic emulsion manufac-
turers who transform them into light-
sensitive film.
titanium fatigue
Research which will aid in design-
ing constructional steels of high fa-
tigue strength has shown titanium to
be the most effective alloying metal in
increasing the fatigue strength of iron.
Following titanium are molybdenum,
silicon, manganese, nickel, cobalt, and
chromium. Supersonic waves sent into
the specimen were found to give most
accurate indications of the first minute
crack which marks the true fatigue
failure. Results of the experiments al-
so suggest methods of increasing fa-
tigue life of metals by treatment other
than changing the composition of the
metal.

Iast year a Michigan truck-
J gardener planted part of his
acreage in carrots. The carrots
came up but so did the weeds—
so thick and fast that it looked as
if he would have to re-plow and
re-seed.
Then he discovered one of
Standard's new selective petro-
leum weed-killers. He sprayed it
on. The weeds died and the car-
rots thrived. He sold the carrots
for $5,000, more than 50 times
the cost of the weed-killer.
Right now, in Standard's labo-
ratories, research is increasing the
murderous efficiency of these
herbicides. Eventually there may
be a Standard petroleum product
that will mean sure death for all
harmful weeds.
Hundreds of other products are
also under development by Stand-

more than 2,000 petroleum prod-

Post war automobile production al-
though hampered by shortages, strikes,
and time consuming changeovers, is
slowly coming into its own. This does-
n't mean that you can ru^h to your fa-
vorite dealer and drive a new car away
—yet. A major factor in this equaliza-
tion of supply to demand is the en-
trance of new manufacturers in the
field. One of the most recent entrants
is Preston Tucker who is presenting
his creation, the Tucker '48.
The Tucker '48 has been described
by many as a daring risk. It is argued
that too many changes are being of-
fered at once. Preston Tucker is, how-
ever, presenting an automobile that has
some eight hundred parts less than the
conventional automobile and claims su-
perior performance.
Tucker is not new to the automobile
field. He is known as one of the top
creative men in the designing and build-
ing of special automobiles. He holds
patents, either issued or pending, on
nineteen prime improvements in auto-
motive designs. Mr. Tucker became as-
sociated with the late Harry Miller in
building the famous Miller Special rac-
ing cars. These racing cars won first
place in eleven out of fifteen Indianap-
olis speedway classics.
Many features of these tough little
speed wagons, designed and tested in
the pits at Indianapolis, are now incor-
porated in the Tucker. This is nothing
new, however, as most of the major
advances in automotive progress can be
traced to racing. The Tucker has been
designed from the drawing board up
to embody features which have been
tested and proved on the track but then
"filed for future use" without benefit-
ing the motoring public.
The first of several departures from
the conventional car is the location of
the engine in the rear. Although this is
not a new idea, the Tucker is the first
American automobile to present this
feature in a mass-produced car. With
the engine in the rear, heat, fumes and
noise do not reach the passenger com-
partment.
The power plant of the Tucker is an

.exie
E. H
errin
airplane-type engine of 150 horse-
power. It is a flat-opposed, 6 cylinder
engine timed to give overlapping im-
pulses that match the smoothness of a
12 cylinder engine. This engine weighs
approximately 500 pounds less than the
conventional engine. This reduction in
weight is accomplished by making the
engine block and head out of a single
aluminum casting. Because the pistons
are made of the same type of metal as
the block, the coefficients of expansion
of pistons and head are the same. In
the ordinary engine with either a cast
iron or steel-sleeved block, the co-effi-
cient of expansion of the pistons is
about 8 times greater than the walls of
the block, causing wear and eventual
oil pumping. Because of this, the manu-
facturer expects the Tucker engine to
give trouble-free service about three
times as long as is generally expected
from the ordinary automobile engine.
To prevent tiny surface imperfections,
the starting points for excessive wear,
the engine block will be rough bored and
then diamond bored to give a mirror
finish to the walls. This precision in
manufacture plus the higher ratio of
power to weight than found in any oth-
er mass-produced engine, make the
Tucker engine a slow-speed engine, ca-
pable of loafing while operating at high
speeds.

DAVID STEIN '49E
In the extensive literature on the
subject of Mechanics, there seems to
be wanting a discussion of the free-
body diagram which recognizes and
treats it as a unit complete in itself.
This paper was written with the pur-
pose of serving as the "missing chap-
ter" in the standard texts on Mechan-
ics used in engineering colleges. No
originality of material is claimed other
than the advancement of the idea that
the free-body diagram deserves (in-
deed, needs) a more deliberate and uni-
fied treatment than has been given in
the majority of texts1 used today.
The usefulness and importance of
the free-body diagram is universally
recognized: its use in the solution of
problems (particularly in Statics) is
virtually a necessity. Most authors ad-
vocate the use of the free-body as a
necessary step in the solution of a prob-
lem. This procedure cannot be over-
emphasized. The accomplishment of a
correct free-body diagram is an indica-
tion of the correct analysis of a prob-
lem; from it, the solution by mathe-
matical techniques is greatly facilitated.
Definition of the Free-body
Diagram
A free-body diagram is a diagram of
a body in which all the material objects
acting directly upon the body are re-
moved, and vectors representing the
forces transmitted by those external

David Stein
objects upon the body are substituted
in their places. These vectors need not
lie drawn to scale, since they are in-
tended solely for the purpose of visual-
ization.
It is this visualization which allows
for a more convenient means of trans-
lating the physical relationships into
terms of geometry.
Features of the Free-body
Diagram
1. Only reactions on the body in
question are represented. Do not rep-
resent the forces applied by the body
itself.

(a)

(b)

(c)

Figure 1

If the weight of a body is to be con-
sidered, it is represented by a vector
acting through the center of gravity of
the body and in the direction chosen as
the center of the earth. (It is to be
noted that although a body attracts the
earth with a force equal to the attrac-
tive force of the earth for the body, it
is only the latter force which is repre-
sented, because it is a force acting on
the body).
2. The convention of direction and
sense of the vectors representing the
unknown forces is arbitrary. However,
after the convention of direction and
sense has been assumed on the outside
of the body (by an imaginary set of
rectangular co-ordinate axes) the defi-
nition of convention is retained on the
other bodies. An analysis of the deter-
mination of the direction and sense of
reactions will be discussed below.
3. As a further aid to establishing
geometrical relationships, all angles,
lengths, and planes of motion should
be included in the free-body diagram.
These three features are nothing
more than a detailed amplification of
the definition. They are features com-
mon to any and all free-bodies. They
constitute, as a group, the concept of
the tool known as the free-body dia-
gram ; and they are the means whereby
the analysis of a problem leaves the
realm of guesswork and takes on the
garb of an engineering problem, ap-
proached and handled with sound en-
gineering principles.
The construction of a free-body di-
agram requires, in a sense, a definite
technique, based on a knowledge of the
basic principles of statics.2 The appli-
cation of these principles to the free-
body will now be formulated as a list
of "techniques."
Techniques of the Free-body

Since we are concerned solely with
the forces acting on a body, let us ex-
amine some of the more common
means whereby a body may be sup-
ported, and also how the physical char-

fect the reaction at that place. (Al-
though, in actual experience, we are al-
ways dealing with three dimensional
objects, our representations of them
are so chosen that they are most con-
veniently represented by one and two
dimensional configurations. In short,
we view a body in such a manner that
its projection on our paper allows us to
treat that body in terms of plane geom-
etry. Thus, a plane may be viewed
edgewise and drawn as a straight line;
a block, as a rectangle; and a sphere,
as a circle. This is applicable particu-
larly to coplanar force systems; the
treatment of a three dimensional, or
non-coplanar, force system is, gener-
ally, best visualized by a well-executed
isometric sketch together with a con-
ventional set of rectangular-space co-
ordinate axes).
friction

Figure 2
1- If two bodies contact each other
with no friction, the direction of the
total reactive force is along the normal
to the tangent plane common to the
two surfaces, at the point of contact.
Therefore, if one of the surfaces is
curved (usually a circle, or an arc of
a circle in the free-body) then the
reaction will act along the line joining
the point of contact and the center of
the circle. Fig. 1 illustrates various
combinations of surface contacts and
the reactions at the places of contact.
2- If two bodies contact each other
with friction, then the reactive force is
not along the normal, as above, but at
some angle to the normal. For now, in
addition to the normal force, there is a
f rictional force which acts in the direc-
tion to oppose motion, or impending
motion. The total reactive force is the
resultant of a normal force and a fric-
tional force, causing the reaction to
make an angle with the normal. (See
fig. 2).
3- Structures, or members of a struc-
ture, may also be supported by hinges,
rollers, and pins.
a- The Hinge: the purpose of a hinge
is to prevent translation of a body but
to allow rotation about the hinge. In
general, the total reactive force at a
hinge has an unknown direction, but
its line of action passes through the
hinge.
b- The Roller: the roller is designed to
allow translation along the plane of
support. It is usually assumed that a
roller acts with no friction; thus the
direction of the reaction at a roller is
normal to the plane of support,
c- The Pin: the pin is designed to fas-
ten together or connect, two or more
members. It is through the pin connec-
tion that the forces of a member are
transmitted to the connecting members.
Here too, the pin is usually assumed to
act without friction, and in most cases,
is treated as a mathematical point to
avoid complexities of computation. In
general, the total reactive force at a
pin has an unknown direction, but its
line of action passes through the pin.
4- Many problems deal with a rope and
pulley arrangement. The pulley is usu-
ally assumed to rotate on its support
without friction. The rope is usually
assumed to be weightless, perfectly
flexibile, and to operate on the pulley
also without friction. With these as-
sumptions, the free-body diagram of
the pulley becomes, in effect, the free-
body of the pin (i.e., the axle) on
which the pulley rotates. Now it may be
treated as just another connection be-
tween members (i.e., a connection be-
tween the plley and the members sup-
porting it) as described in 3-c above.
The force acting along the rope, or
cable, is usually the load it supports,
and, because of the assumptions made,
this force is the same everywhere along
the rope. Fig. 4-a illustrates a pulley
Thus far, we have discussed the var-
ious ways one body may contact an-
other and also how a body may be sup-
ported. There remains, now, the ques-
tion of how to represent a force, the
direction of which is unknown, in a
free-body. (Note the hinge in fig. 3).

5- In every case, at a particular point
of application, a force of unknown
magnitude and unknown direction may
be represented by its components act-
ing through that same point. This de-
vice is one of the most convenient aids
available in drawing and solving for an
unknown force. The vertical and hori-
zontal components are the most con-
venient components to choose. Now, a
force of unknown magnitude and un-
known direction is replaced by two
forces of unknown magnitude but of
known direction. There are two un-
known quantities as before, but the
added knowledge of direction allows
for a more convenient solution. For
example, in fig. 3, if the components
of the reaction at the hinge were to be
used instead of the total reactive force
as shown, the vertical component could
be readily obtained by taking moments
about the roller support. The moment
equation would contain the magnitude
of that vertical component as the only
unknown quantity.

blasting river ice
The accumulation of ice on the Seb-
ewaing River has for many years con-
stituted a major problem to the citi-
zens of Sebewaing, Michigan. During
the winter months, a coating of ice two
to three inches thick forms on the
river, creating a hazard both to naviga-
tion and to the town itself. When the
ice thawed, property owners in the vil-
lage suffered severe damage due to the
piling up of large pieces of ice along
the banks of the stream and upon ad-
jacent land. When the ice melted com-
pletely, many sections of the town be-
came completely inundated, so great
was the volume of overflowed ice.
Manufacturing concerns and dwellings
located along the edges of the 80-foot
wide river were in special danger of
flooding.
The fact that the river makes several
turns during its course through Seb-
ewaing further restricted the natural
flow of ice downstream and called for
extreme methods in dealing with the
problem of ice removal.
After conventional ice-removal tech-
nique proved ineffective, village au-
thorities finally devised an ingenious
scheme of blasting the ice free from
the river before thawing took place.
The explosive material utilized is
Hercules 50% nitroglycerine dynamite
in 1 ]4-inch by 3 inch cartridges. Eight
cartridges are tied together with binder
twine, with approximately 20 inches of
twine between each cartridge. While
the blasting charges are being prepared,
the remainder of the men engaged in
the work are chopping holes in the ice
preparatory to blasting. The first open-
ing in the ice is chopped at an angle to
facilitate the entry under the ice of a
40-foot pole, known as a "running
pole." All subsequent holes are triangu-
lar in shape, with vertical sides and
spaced 35 feet apart, center to center.
All the holes are chopped approxi-
mately 20 feet from the river edge.
The men chopping the holes continu-
ally keep ahead of those preparing the
cartridges, thereby assuring no delay in
the firing of the blasts. In addition to
the so-called running pole, two more
wooden poles are needed, one with a
large hook to locate the position of the
running pole under the ice, and the
other with a smaller hook on the end to
facilitate the movement of the running
pole.
In preparing a blast, 150 feet of yi-
inch rope is attached to the 40-foot
pole, which is then inserted into the
first hole and guided toward the initial
triangular opening by the short hooked
pole. As the running pole approaches
the second triangular hole, it is pulled
into place by the large hooked pole. By-
alert use of the poles, the rope on the
end of the running pole may be kept
directly under the holes and free from
sag. When the 40-foot pole has passed
the second triangular hole, the previ-
ously prepared string of cartridges is
connected to the end of the running
rope. The small hooked pole is-utilized
to pull up the running rope lying be-
neath the ice at the third hole. The
cartridges are fed into the first opening
at the same time the rope is being
pulled taut at the third station. When
the first cartridge appears through the
ice at the advanced point, the crew
member at the first hole cuts the twine
connecting the blast charges and se-
cures the end of it.
The final operation before the actual
blasting is the insertion of an electric
blasting cap into the cartridge first to
appear at the third hole and the con-
necting of four-foot leg wires and 250-
foot lead wires to the blasting cap. The
blast is fired by a standard 10-cap
blasting machine.

rust
Rust and corrosion, two of the great-
est enemies of the metal industry, may
soon be things of the past thanks to a
new electron diffraction device recently
developed by the General Electric Cor-
poration. The instrument is especially
examined, they reflect, or "bounce,"
and form a diffraction pattern on a
photographic plate. By comparing this
pattern to a standard diffraction pat-
tern for the metal under test, the pres-
ence of rust or other imperfections on
the surface may easily be detected.
The earliest use of the instrument was
in determining corrosion resistance in
varied atmospheres.
In addition to its application in the
field of rust prevention, the device has

into small enough chunks to permit
jam-free travel downstream and yet
making certain that no pieces set free
by the blast will endanger adjacent
property or buildings.
In freeing the ice under the three
bridges which span the river within the
town limits, additional charges are
placed near the bridge pilings to break
loose the ice adhering to the structures,
which possibly would not have been
sufficiently loosened by the blasts tak-
ing place some distance away. Similar
blasting operations to those already de-
scribed are sometimes carried on in the
early spring to free partially thawed
ice, which may cause jams, even
though it has previously been blasted.
As a general rule, however, once the
valuable in that it can detect corrosion
and rust on metal surfaces long before
such defects are visible to the x-ray or
microscope. Besides detecting charac-
teristics invisible to x-ray diffraction
and microscope methods, the electron-
type diffraction instrument requires
an exposure time of only five seconds
and is non-destructive to the material
being tested.
The instrument makes use of the
principle that electrons are diffracted
when they are reflected from ruled sur-
faces, much as is light. Electrons emit-
ted by a cathode in a high-vacuum
chamber are accelerated by an elec-
trostatic field of 40,000 volts and "fo-
cused" by a magnetic field. When they
hit their target, the specimen being
proven of extreme value in determin-
ing the effectiveness of various types
of lubricants. Since the instrument can
analyze surface conditions and irregu-
larities and since lubrication is a func-
tion of the surface film, the electron
diffraction method is useful in deter-
mining the nature and wearing ability
of various lubricants. Continued re-
search with the instrument is expected
to result in better lubricants and
longer wearing machinery.
The potential abilities of General
Electric's new development are far
from exhausted. Engineers expect it to
be utilized in such diverse fields as the
dye industry, metallurgical processes,
the ferrous and non-ferrous metal in-

James F. Fairman, '18E,
As vice-president in charge of pro-
duction and operation of the Consoli-
dated Edison Company of New York
(N. Y.) Inc., James F. Fairman has
been closely associated with the vari-
ous technical aspects concerning power
generation. Mr. Fairman was gradu-
ated from the University of Michigan
in 1918 with a bachelor of science de-
gree in electrical engineering. He re-
ceived his master of science degree in
electrical engineering in 1921. Upon
graduation he joined the Westinghouse
Electric and Manufacturing Company
(now the Westinghouse Electric Cor-
poration) as a student in the company's
graduate course. Mr. Fairman later
held a position as instructor in electri-
cal engineering at the University of
Michigan and in 1922 was made assist-
ant professor in electrical engineering.
In 1924 James Fairman became an
employee of the Brooklyn, N. Y.. Edi-
son Company, Inc. and served as an
assistant outside plant engineer. In
1926 he became outside plant engineer
and in 1932 was made electrical engi-
neer of the Brooklyn Edison Company.
Following the merger of various power
companies in New York in 1932, Mr.
Fairman was given the position of
chief engineer for the Consolidated
Edison Company of New York (N.Y.)
Inc. In 1940 he was elected assistant
vice-president for design, inventory,
purchasing and stores, and in 1946 was
elected vice-president in charge of pro-
duction and operation.
Mr. Fairman is a fellow of the
AIEE and at present is chairman of
the AIEE administration coordination
committee. He was vice-president of
the New York City District of the
AIEE and has served on many com-
mittees throughout his career. Since
1938 he has been an AIEE representa-
tive of the Engineers' Council for Pro-
fessional Developmnt. He has held of-
fice of president of the New York
State Society of Professional Engi-
neers and is also a member of Tau
Beta Pi and Sigma Xi.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


by
MORTIMER E. COOLEY
Editor's Note: This article is the last
in a scries of fovo articles dealing with
the early history of the College of Engi-
neering. It is composed of excerpts from
the recently published memoirs of the
late Dean Emeritus Mortimer E. Cooley,
entitled The Scientific Rlacksmith.
Perhaps I should make known the
various "homes" of engineering educa-
tion at Michigan. Instruction was orig-
inally given in rooms in old University
Hall. In 1881 the first little engineer-
ing shop building was constructed.
This was immediately over-crowded; a
year or two later we moved alongside
it an old wooden building which had
been used as a shop for making mu-
seum cases when the old museum was
built. This had originally been placed
where the old Physics Building now
stands. It was to be moved off the
campus, and I begged it of the Regents,
together with the machinery used for
making the museum cases.
In 1891 the engineers were given the
use of the building vacated by the Den-
tal College when it moved into the for-
mer quarters of the hospital. Our "new
building" was one of the original pro-
fessors' houses on the campus; it was
enlarged to hold fifteen classrooms and
several offices. The building was torn
down in 1923, and an old public school
building, for which I designed my
first heating and ventilating system,
was made available for engineering
classes in mathematics, English, and
languages. Condemned as a public
school building, it is now known as
East Hall and is still being used by the
engineers. The building from which the
Dental College moved in 1891 was
torn down in order to make room for
Clements Library. Meantime, in 1902
construction was begun on the four-
storied structure known for years as
the New Engineering Building, later
named West Engineering Building.
The enrollment of engineering stu-
dents has always kept well ahead of
the space provided for them in class-
rooms and laboratories. Quarters for
instruction in engineering at Michigan
have always been badly overcrowded;
this is true today. This is in no way a
reflection upon the willingness of the
Board of Regents or the state legisla-
ture to provide facilities for the Col-
lege of Engineering. They have been
as generous as possible within the
means they command. The University
of Michigan, while a state university,
can scarcely be considered simply a
state school, since its student body rep-
resents every state in the union as well
as dozens of foreign countries. It re-
ceives far more generous state support
than many similarly financed schools,
but if it were not for the generosity of
friends and alumni, Michigan would
not have the physical equipment it now
possesses. It is to be assumed that at
some time public-spirited friends and
alumni will provide the College of En-
gineering with facilities more in keep-
ing with its needs, as in the cases of
the Law School, the School of Dentis-
try, and the Graduate School through
the gifts of Mr. Cook, Mr. Kellogg,
and Mr. Rackham. Surely, with its
large percentage of the total Univer-
sity enrollment, the College of Engi-
neering warrants more adequate provi-
sion for its needs than can be expected
in a state-supported institution, espe-
cially when its graduates practice the
profession throughout the nation; in-
deed, throughout the world. Michigan
engineers are using the knowledge ac-
quired in Ann Arbor. In comparison
with the "per student" cost of other
undergraduate courses today, training
in engineering is one of the most ex-
pensive.
But to return to our first little "sci-
entific blacksmith" shop building. It
was twenty-four by thirty-six feet; it
was sheeted up outside and in with
brick on edge nailed to the studding.
At the west end of this little building
was the forge shop, at the east end was
the foundry. On the second floor was
the pattern shop and machine shop.
Stairs to the second floor were in the
northwest corner, with a landing part
way up. The little vertical four horse-
power engine, a gift from a concern in
Wisconsin (Allis-Chalmers, I think it
was), was in the angle of the stairway.
The belt was vertical and passed
through the floor to the more than
thirty feet of shafting and pulleys at
the ceiling of the second floor. The
shafting and pulleys were the gift of
William Sellers of Philadelphia. The
iron lathe was found in the basement
of old University Hall and tinkered up
for use. I made the wood lathe myself;
it had a bed and cone pulleys of wood.
A forge was built, and a small cu-
pola erected. The cupola, twenty inches
in diameter and five or six feet high,
was on the east side of the chimney in
the center of the building. Notwith-
standing its size it worked well, and we
made many castings in molds fashioned
from patterns made on the floor above.
I had learned a little about black-
smithing as a boy on the farm, and I
used to wield the sledge hammer for
the blacksmith at his shop a mile away.
I knew a little about woodworking and
something about carpentry, and I had
learned machine shop and pattern-
making rather thoroughly at the Naval
Academy. But I did not know enough
foundry work to teach it. I found dear
old Bob Winslow at the foundry on
Huron Street just west of the Ann Ar-
bor Railroad tracks, and I hired him to
teach foundry practice. Foundry men
in those days could mold from almost
anything as a pattern. If a part from a
machine was brought in, Bob used it as
a pattern, trimmed up the molds a bit,
and reproduced the part in practically
its original form.
In one of my early classes was the
son of a very wealthy man who pro-
vided the boy with the finest of wear-
ing apparel. One day I said to the class,
"Tomorrow we will have a practical
demonstration with the boiler. It will
be explained to you, and you will be
required to operate it just the same as
if you were a fireman in a power plant.
Come in your oldest clothes, and if
they are already dirty, so much the bet-
ter."
All but one of the class came in old
clothes. This student, the wealthy man's
son, sauntered down the diagonal walk
dressed as if he were going to a Choral
Union concert. I hailed him. When he

Triangles
This fall term of 1947 marked the
return to campus of Triangle, a social
fraternity composed entirely of engi-
neers.
Founded on the Michigan campus in
1925, the fraternity afforded qualified
engineers an opportunity to make valu-
able social and academic contacts with
other engineers. World War II caused
temporary suspension of activities in
1942, but late in April of 1947, the
fraternity was reactivated under the
leadership of President Robert Ford
and several interested alumni.
On June 6, eleven men were pledged
and formal initiation took place on No-
vember 2 of this year. Those initiated
included Donald Hull, Edward Cro-
vella, Robert Forgacs, Robert Glauz,
George Frunthaner, David Hawkes,
Kenneth Haynes, Roger Kuehl, Harry
Smith, LeRoy Weinstein, and Robert
Woodman. The new initiates, plus the
following old members, Robert Ford,
Edward Rich, James Hull, and Wil-
liam Weatherwax, brought the frater-
nity to its present strength of fifteen.
Immediately following the initiation,
election of officers was held. Those
elected were Robert Ford, President;
Donald Hull, Vice-President; William
Weatherwax, Secretary ; Edward Rich,
Treasurer.
Triangle placed five candidates in the
November engineering elections and
has continued to take an active inter-
est in the activities of the Engineer-
ing College.
The fraternity expects further to in-
crease its membership during the com-
ing semester, and a number of dances
and picnics are also being included in
future plans.
AIEE-IRE
AIEE-IRE activities this year have
been varied and interesting. Future
highlights include a lively debate on
"Unionization of Engineers" at the
Feb. 11th meeting and a meeting de-
voted to power generating stations

along with a field trip to a station in
the Detroit area in March. This meet-
ing-field trip combination proved very
poular in November when it was ap-
plied to the WWJ-TV television sta-
tion.
The deadline for entries in the
Branch student paper contest is Feb-
ruary 20th. Winning papers will be
presented orally at the March 20th
meeting.
Alpha Chi Sigma
At the fall semester initiation of
Alpha Beta chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma,
national professional chemistry frater-
nity, twenty-one new members were
taken into the group. Among the ini-
tiates were Drs. Leo L. Carrick, Fred-
erick C. Moesel, and Maurice J. Sinnott,
of the chemical engineering faculty, and
Gus L. Constan, Ronald G. Clark, Rob-
ert J. Gustafson, Clark J. Hall, Jr., Rob-
ert L. Hall, Thomas K. Holland, Robert
M. Murch, and Charles F. Perry, chem-
ical engineering undergraduates.
Included in the weekend-long pro-
gram were the informal initiation,
pledge dance, and the formal initiation
and banquet, at which Professor G. G.
Brown of the Chemical Engineering De-
partment was speaker. Dr. Burton Tif-
fany, of the Detroit professional group,
spoke briefly, and John Controulis and
Dr. Carrick responded for the initiates
to the welcome tendered by the Master
Alchemist, Robert W. Hockenbury.
ASME
On November 5 the student chapter
of ASME was privileged to have Mr.
W. L. Cisler, Chief Engineer of Power
Plants, Detroit Edison Company, as
its speaker. His topic was "Looking
Ahead" and he discussed the value of
an engineering education, emphasizing
particularly its importance in the field
of power transmission and also the
part engineers will play in rebuilding
Europe.
A former student and past president
of the ASME chapter at Michigan,
Mr. John F. Schmidt, member of the
Patent Law firm of Hauke, Hardesty,
&amp; Schmidt, was the speaker at the No-
vember 19 meeting. He briefly dis-
cussed the importance of patents as an
incentive to invention, pointing out
that an invention, to be patented, must
be useful and must be original.
The first field trip of the fall semes-
ter was made on December 3 to the
Yellow Coach Division of GMC at
Pontiac. About 40 students left Ann
Arbor by bus and automobile at noon.
Guided tours were made through the
Greyhound coach assembly plant and
the newly-constructed engine plant.
Questions on assembly line technique
and plant layout design were answered
by key men in those fields.
Spoofuncup
On the evening of December 17, the
American Society of Mechanical Engi-
neers served "Roast Professor with
Dumpling" to its members and guests at
the annual Spoofuncup Banquet. The
pre-Christmas event, held this year at
the Union, gave the students a long-
awaited chance to see what a Prof, looks
like when he is caught unprepared and
off-guard. After priming themselves on
Union chow and listening to the usual
fire-lighting services of Professors Em-
mons, Hawley and Spooner, the mem-
bers really got a flame going as Roast-
Master Porter asked for and promptly
received four carefully prepared, 'spon-
taneous' nominations from the floor.
Professors Edmonson, Erickson,
Rote and Vincent were put on the spot
and the question of the moment that
hung from every visage was: "Would
they be foolish enough to accept?" They
did and roasting quickly attained bonfire
proportions with questions such as
"How do you make a hydraulic jump?"
and "Why must there be an exhaust
opening in a gas turbine ? Give brief and
detailed answers."
Heckling and loud "nahs" from the
student spectators heightened competi-
tion for the coveted cup, which has
haunted many an Ann Arbor closet dur-
ing its ten-year existence. Students, ever
mindful of the red-pencil remarks found
on their near perfect reports, seldom let
an answer go unchallenged.
Roast-Master Porter brought the
noisy proceedings to a halt to save court
fees and the student jury announced
that 'the winnah' was Prof. Vincent.
Prof. Porter reluctantly turned over to
him the famous Spoofuncup which he
has cherished since he won it one year
ago.

Betty J. Hansen, engineering senior
from Iron Mountain, Michigan, tells
us that she has become accustomed to
being a "lipstick with a slipstick" and
really is not upset by the fact that she
is the only woman in most of her
classes,
Betty started her engineering career
by enrolling in the Aeronautics curri-
culum at Michigan in the fall of 1944,
after her graduation from the Iron
Mountain High School. Since that time
she has been very active in extra-cur-
ricular activities. Betty was president
of her freshman dormitory, Ridgeway
House, which was the war-time name
of the Acacia fraternity house. She was
sophomore aide to the Juciciary Coun-
cil.

Betty J. Hansen
She served as Associate Editor of
the TECHNIC last year and held the
position of National Advertising Man-
ager the preceding year. She has
worked on the Slide Rule Ball commit-
tee for the last two years, and she is a
member of the Senior Society for in-
dependent women. She holds a four
year Regents Alumni Scholarship, and
is a member of Alpha Lambda Delta,
honorary society for women.
Betty's academic prowess and out-
standing character was recently ac-
knowledged by the Michigan Chapter
of Tau Beta Pi when they awarded her
their woman's badge. Only fifty-four
women throughout the United States
have attained such recognition since the
founding of Tau Beta Pi in 1885.
Currently employed by the Depart-
ment of Engineering Research, Betty
has worked with the wind tunnel group
at Willow Run for over a year. Betty
was interested in aeronautics and science
while in high school, and upon receiving
an honorable mention in the Westing-
house Science Talent Search Contest
she decided to study engineering.
Aerodynamics is her favorite sub-
ject, but she recalls that M. P. 2 was
also ''lots of fun." Although Betty
graduates in June, she has as yet made
no plans for the immediate future. She
feels that she should get more practi-
cal experience before doing any grad-
uate study. She enjoys super-sonic
work, and says that she would like re-
search engineering along that line.
Betty's main hobby is skiing, al-
though she hasn't been able to do much
of it for the last two years. Her work
at Willow Run and the homework for
seven courses keeps her "free" time
pretty well occupied.
prof foust
Associate Professor Alan S. Foust
of the Chemical Engineering Depart-
ment was born in Dublin, Texas, and
completed his preparatory education at
Dublin High School in 1924. He im-
mediately entered the University of
Texas in Austin and completed the re-
quirements for a B.S. in Chemical En-
gineering in 1928. He took his Mas-
ter's Degree in 1930, assisting in a lab-
oratory while working on his thesis on
water softening problems. He accepted
a position with the Magnolia Petro-
leum Company of Beaumont, Texas,
where has was engaged in corrosion
control work until the spring of 1932.
Following this he was employed by the
Texas Pacific Coal and Oil Company,
where he was in charge of their plant
for the vapor-phase cracking of petro-
leum. He stayed in this position for
only six months: then he returned to
the University of Texas to take fur-
ther work in organic chemistry and to
instruct part time. In 1935, after com-
pleting his work at the University of
Texas, Professor Foust became an as-
sociate professor of chemistry at the
Texas College of Mines, El Paso. He
began teaching chemical engineering at
Michigan in 1937 and took his Ph.D.
in Chemical Engineering a year later,
his thesis being concerned with Liquid
Circulation in Evaporators, a field in
which he still maintains an intense in-
terest. His rise to an assistant profes-
sorship followed in 1939.
Three months after World War II
broke out, he was placed on active duty
with the Chemical Warfare Officers
Reserve Corps and sent to Pine-
bluff Arsenal in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.
There he supervised the development
of the procedure for loading magne-
sium bombs and was chief of inspec-
tion for the first year the arsenal was
in operation. In May of 1943, he was
re-assigned as head of the engineering
and service division of the arsenal,
which performed all engineering du-
ties at the base.

Alan S. Foust
He was promoted to the rank of
Lieutenant Colonel in October, 1944,
and in 1945 received the Legion of
Merit for services performed while at
Pine Bluff. He was relieved from ac-
tive duty in 1946 and at present holds
the rank of Lieutenant Colonel in the
Chemical Corps Reserve. Returning to
the University, he became an associate
professor of chemical engineering.

ENGINEER'S PSALM
The Dean is my shepherd, I shall not
sleep
He maketh me to stand up in full class-
rooms
He leadeth me away from the P-Bell
My efforts are naught
He prepareth an examination in the
presence of my classmates
He poundeth my head with facts, my
slide-rule runneth overtime
Surely fatigue and worry shall follow
me all of my college days
And I shall dwell in the East Quad un-
til my G. I. subsistence expires.
John A. Fisher, '49 E
Bill Shelley, one of banChEro's more
brilliant Chem Engineers, studying the
problem of heat transfer to cigarettes
discovered in the all-inclusive Perry's
handbook the following correlation of
data: "If you have no matches, follow
these instructions. Take a pack of cig-
arettes, remove one cigarette. The pack-
is now a cigarette lighter."
Have you heard of the electrical engi-
neer who couldn't sit still because he got
amps in his pants.
Humor? is obtained in like manner
(the delayed, contrasting punch line):
The little old grey woman bent over
the cherub in the cradle, murmuring
sweet nothings.
"O-o-o. You look sweet; I could eat
you."
Baby : "The hell you could ; you ain't
got no teeth."
The recent fire at Wild's campus store
provoked an intense moral deliberation
when one of the excited firemen at-
tempted to save one of our coed sales
clerks trapped in the burning building.
Said the gal. choking in the thick
smoke, "I don't care if you are a volun-
teer fireman! Keep your hands off my
hose!!!"
Hence the conclusion that Michigan's
"fifth ones" are, in addition, icebergs
unthawable in even the most exothermic
conflagrations.
John Howell (no intended disrespect
to a senior class officer) dreads the
tongue-lashing from his wife, Barbara,
that invariably accompanies his return
home in the early hours of the morning.
So, after a night of tippling, he returned
to the house, went to the kitchen, tied a
rope around his waist, and fastened
skillets, pots and pans to the rope in such
a manner that they dragged behind him
as he walked. Then he took off his shoes
and crept toward his bedroom, mutter-
ing, "She'll never hear me in this in-
fernal din."
Student Nurse: "Every time I bend
over to listen to his heart his pulse rate
goes up alarmingly. What should I do?"
Intern: "Button your collar."

At the fall initiation of Tau Beta Pi
(pictured in the December TECHNIC)
an analysis was performed by three
chemical engineering pledges on Pretzel
Bell beer. Dave Oberlin, just to settle
the matter once and for all, sent a sample
of the beer to a lab to be analyzed. A few
days later he received a report from the
chemist —
"Dear Sir: Your horse has diabetes."

While over at Lane Hall the other
day I heard the tale of a former SRA
coed member who, springing from one
of the best families, accomplished the
usual feminine goal of hooking her man.
Came the day of the wedding.
The demure young bride, a trifle pale,
her lips set in a tremulous line, slowly
stepped down the long church aisle
clinging to the arm of her father. As she
reached the low platform before the
altar, her slippered foot brushed a potted
flower, upsetting it. She looked at the
spilled dirt, gravely, as if seeking an
omen, and then raised her childlike eyes
to the sedate face of the old minister.
"That's a hell of a place to put a lily,"
she remarked.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


What kind of engineer does
the Telephone Business need?
Many kinds, for many kinds of work ...
research and development, technical
and economic planning, operations,
which involve manufacturing, con-
struction and maintenance of tele-
phone facilities.
Telephone engineering is broad in
scope but includes intensive study of a
wide variety of specific problems.
Much of it requires the special knowl-
edge of electrical, mechanical, indus-
trial or other engineers. All of it re-
quires the engineer's background, his
understanding of scientific principles,
his trait of weighing facts and deriv-
ing logical and workable conclusions.
With our greatest expansion pro-
gram in history under way the work of
the telephone engineer is more im-
portant than ever. During the next few
years expenditures for new buildings,
new equipment and plant facilities
may well total over $4,000,000,000.
The engineering task involved in
this program, as well as in the normal
operation of the industry, means just
one thing: qualified engineers who
choose telephony as a career will find
their lives packed with interesting and
satisfying work.
BELL TELEPHONE SYSTEM

Valves arc operated by a hydraulic
actuating mechanism that insures posi-
tive performance. This means a safety
factor is introduced, preventing damage
to the engine in case the oil supply
reaches the danger point for any rea-
son. The valves simply stop operating,
shutting off the engine until the trou-
ble is found and remedied.
Cooling of the Tucker engine is ac-
complished by a sealed liquid system.
The coolant, Prestone, is sealed in the
cooling system and has a temperature
range of from 250°F. to 50°F. below
zero, giving ample cooling qualities for
all parts of the world. Thermostats
will regulate the temperature, holding
it near 210° F.; this is considered to be
the ideal temperature for good engine
performance. This type of system
should eliminate many of the headaches
of replacing anti-freeze and worry
about the engine's freezing on a cold
night.
Mounted with only four bolts, the
engine is designed as a "package"
power plant. It is so designed that en-
gines may be exchanged in less than

during the war. has been found to
withstand many times the strain put
upon it during normal or even exces-
sive peace-time applications.
A long overdue development in au-
tomotive progress is the incorporation
of a higher voltage electrical system.
The Tucker has a 24-volt system which
provides greater power to start and to
operate the increasing number of elec-
trical accessories used on present-day
and future automobiles. The starter
and generator are a one-piece light-
weight unit. Incorporating another
safety factor, the starter-generator is
connected to the oil pump, thus prelu-
bricating the engine during starting;
this prevents piston scuffing and cyl-
inder-wall scarring. Piston scuffing is
responsible for much of the excessive
oil consumption in conventional cars.
Location of the engine in the rear
eliminates the conventional power
transmission assembly. The transmis-
sion of power to the rear wheels is ac-

PROBLEM — Your company manufactures gas
burners of varying number and spacing of gas
ports. You want to develop a drilling machine
which can be changed over with a minimum of
time and effort to drill the holes in the different
burner castings. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—The illustration shows
how one manufacturer solved this problem by
using S.S.White flexible shafts as spindles.
This arrangement makes possible quick changes
of spindle groupings to meet different require-
ments. As here, S.S.White flexible shafts make
ideal power drives for almost any machine part
which must be adjustable.
This is just one of the
hundreds of remote
control and power drive
problems to which S. S.
White flexible shafts
provide a simple ans-
wer. Engineers will find
it worthwhile to be famil-
iar with the range and
scope of these "Metal
Muscles"* for mechan-
ical bodies.

complished through hydraulic torque converters which transmit
power from both ends of the crankshaft (mounted transversely
in the chassis) to the rear wheels. Also eliminated are the
clutch, drive shaft, torque tube, full-width rear axle, and the
conventional differential. Because of the elimination of much
of the "power train" and location of the engine in the rear, the
tunnel in the floor is removed. Thus, only connections for the
foot brake and accelerator remain beneath the floor.
Fuel injection makes its bow into service in the passenger
car field with the advent of the Tucker. Measured fuel injec-
tion, high frequency ignition, lighter weight, and the elimina-
tion of some 800 parts should give a gasoline mileage ranging
up to 35 miles per gallon at moderate driving speeds.
The Tucker is expected to have a top speed well in excess of
100 m.p.h. It is designed to withstand constant high speed
driving.
The rear engine has made possible many changes in design
which the manufacturer claims will give superior economy and
performance. For the first time is it possible to develop power
which moves directly from the engine to the wheels. From an
engineering standpoint, the rear engine makes possible precision
balance, for years the goal of automotive engineers. The reason
is that with the engine in the rear its weight can be distributed
more efficiently, the frame can be lowered, and the steering king
pin can be placed in the center front rather than at the side of
the engine as in conventional cars. To explain the latter point
more specifically, the front wheels are mounted with the line
of lateral rotation in a direct vertical line with the centers of
the tires. This eliminates the precise and delicate adjustments
necessary when the king pins are set outside the vertical wheel
centers. With this design, should a front tire blow out at 60
MPH or more, no swerving tendency would develop to pull
the steering wheel out of the driver's hands. Blowouts, espe-
cially in the front wheels, are recognized as one of the greatest
hazards to high-speed driving. This arrangement of the steering
mechanism permits ease of steering and precision control. To
increase the ease of driving and safety factor still further, the
13-inch wheels carrying 13 by 700 inch tires have a 1/32 inch
toe in front and a 1/16 inch toe in the rear.
The wheels are individually suspended by an action-arm
that purposes to eliminate shock at its sources. The individual
suspension feature in the Tucker was born on the Indianapolis
Speedway and was tested in military vehicles. These suspension
arms also tend to prevent gyroscopic forces that cause cars to
veer and sway with the wind. Fach is of equal length, unlike
the usual spring arrangement which uses a short upper arm and
a longer lower arm. A mushroom nose of an extension arm
from the wheel assembly is suspended in a rubber disc which
in turn is bonded to the frame. This gives a "torsilastic action"
when the wheel hits a bump or hole. Brakes are the next con-
sideration. Aluminum, air-cooled, single-disc brakes are used.
They are of the same type used on carrier-based aircraft during
the war. One claim made for these brakes is that they are 63%
more effective than ordinary brakes and are good for the life
of the car. Not only are the brakes more effective, but the re-
distribution of the engine's weight helps the brakes carry out
their job. When brakes are applied in a conventional car, the

front wheels bear the brunt of the load.
The front wheels do approximately 90%
of the work because of the forward load
shift. The weight of the Tucker will be
under 3000 pounds. About 60% of this
weight is carried by the rear wheels
because of the location of the engine in
the rear. With this distribution of
weight, the braking action of this auto-
mobile shifts a portion of the load for-
ward, insuring a more positive action.
The advantage of the rear engine loca-
tion, aside from braking and elimina-
tion of the "power-train,"' is that it
aids materially in increasing the fric-
tion between the rear wheels and the
road. This feature gives good control
on all types of surfaces, especially icy
roads.
Power transmission from the engine
directly to the rear wheels, by means
of twin torque converters, applies con-
stant and equalized power to the driv-
ing wheels both during deceleration
and acceleration. Under no conditions
can this type of power transmission,
so-called "flowing power," cause one
wheel to spin while the other stands
still. Its differential action, however,
permits one wheel to run ahead of the
other; for example, in going around a
curve or turning around.
The lighting system for the Tucker
is unique in that it has three headlights.
Two of the lights are of the conven-
tional type, but the third is mounted in
the center of the hood and is movable.
The light in the hood is connected with
the steering linkage so that the light
follows the path of the wheels. This is
a very definite safety factor at night,
particularly in going around curves.
There is no longer the lapse of dark-
ness before the headlights are once
again on the road; with this "Cyclop's
Eye" vision is improved tremendously.
All three lights have specially focused
beams designed to penetrate smoke and
fog effectively. Each of the three lights
operates from a separate fuse so that it
is highly unlikely that a complete black-
out will ever take place. The 24-volt
battery should provide an ample supply
of power and carry a substantial re-
serve.

Instruments, gauges, and electrical
controls are in full view and are liter-
ally in the driver's hands since they are
mounted in the steering wheel rather
than on the panel behind it. One design
places the speedometer on the hood in
a direct line of vision between the driver
and the road. The instruments will be
glareless to reduce eye fatigue in night
driving. The numerals are sensitized
and actuated by lights with ultra violet
filters. Driving conditions are further
improved by lights that change color as
operating conditions change. The con-
nectors for the electrically actuated in-
struments will have multiple contacts
with a single clamp for fast and simple
connection or for replacement of an
instrument and electrical equipment.
Again, these connectors are the same
type used in combat aircraft and have
been tested under the most stringent
conditions. By using this simple, en-
closed-type of connector, all of the
present type of automotive wiring is by
comparison intricate and complicated.
The conventional instrument panel
has been replaced by a dressed-up ver-
sion of the crash pad used in racing

Modern design—based on
curved surfaces
cars and military aircraft. This will
cut down to an appreciable extent in-
juries to passengers in case of a head-
on accident. Below this padded section
is a so-called "safety chamber." The
rear engine and lower frame both al-
low room below the cowl. In a collision
the front seat passengers instinctively
bend down and shield their faces. This
very action puts them in the safety
chamber, purported to be the safest
place in the car. For protection of the
rest of the passengers, a steel frame
surrounds the passenger compartment.
In automobile accidents, one of the
causes for cuts and scratches to the
passengers is the presence of slivered
and shattered glass. The Tucker fea-
tures a tempered glass in the windows
which disintegrates upon hard impact
to gravel-like particles with no sharp
cutting edges. The front windshield is
rubber-fastened to its frame so that
while impossible to be pushed in with-
out its being disintegrated, it can be
pushed out by a fairly high pressure: a
pressure as might be applied by a per-
son being thrown through the wind-
shield would be sufficient. Eliminating
the chance of being cut by slivered
glass, the whole window comes out,
thereby lessening the danger of serious
cuts and lacerations.
The Tucker has incorporated some
very ambitious features, to be sure,
and not until many thousands of these
automobiles are on the road, have been
torn up by collisions, driven many
miles, can their true worth be evalu-
ated. Preston Tucker is forcing the hand
of present automotive manufacturers to
bring out some of the features in ad-
vanced automotive design and give the
motoring public the benefit of them
rather than to dole them out slowly over
a period of years.

O must be such that the reaction at the
hinge will pass through the point of in-
tersection, O, of the lines of action of
the other two forces, W and N.
7- The recognition of a hi'o-force piece
immediately establishes the direction
of the two forces holding that member
in equilibrium. A body cannot be in
equilibrium under the action of a single
force. If two forces balance, they must
be equal in magnitude, opposite in
sense, and possess the same line of ac-
tion. When a body is in equilibrium
under the action of two or more forces,
such that the equivalent force system is
composed of two forces, acting at two,
and only two, distinct points on this
body, then the body is a two-force
piece—and the two forces will act along
the line connecting the two points
where the forces are applied. Thus,
their direction is established. In fig.
4-a, the bar AD is a two-force piece
(the weight of bar AD is assumed
negligible) and the reactions upon it
would not be affected in the least even
if the bar were bent in some fashion
instead of being straight as shown.
8- A force is completely denned by
magnitude, direction, and sense. It has
Ijeen mentioned above that a force vec-
tor need not be drawn to scale for a
free-body; and the determination of
the direction of a force has already
been discussed. The sense of a force
vector, for the purpose of a free-body,
poses no special problem.
In every case, the sense of the rec-
tangular components of a force at first
may be assumed. If, in the results of
the calculations, the sign is consistent
with the assumption based on the es-
tablished convention of sense, then the
original assumption is correct; if the
sign is opposite, then it is an indication
that the original assumption is false,
and that the sense of the vector is op-
posite to that assumed. (See above—
Features, note 2). The sense of the
original force is then easily established
after the true sense of the components
has been determined by vector addi-
tion. Often, the sense of a force will
be obvious from the diagram, or will
be felt intuitively. It is good practice
to make any necessary changes of di-
rection and sense of vectors on a new
free-body diagram. In this way the

original free-body may be used to
check the equations derived from it,
and the new free-body may be used as
a quick and accurate check on the final
results by successively summing to
zero algebraically the forces in any
given direction.
After the free-body has been drawn,
it should be checked to make sure that,
in addition to any given forces and the
force of gravity, a force has been indi-
cated at each point where there is a
contact and where a connection has
been broken.
B—Techniques of Use
The accomplishment of a correct
free-body diagram is but one step in
the solution of a problem. It is the
picture represented by the words of the
problem. It now must be combined
with the necessary mathematical rela-
tionships and principles of equilibrium
to fulfill its existence. As was the case
in its construction, the use of a free-
body diagram may be most effectively
accomplished by definite procedures.
1- In general, start from the outside
(Continued from page 27)
of the structure and proceed inward to
the desired member. That is, from a
free-body of the entire frame, deter-
mine the reactions at the supports of
the structure.
2- Sketch a free-body of the required
member and note the number of un-
known quantities. If these are equal to,
or less than, the number of conditions
of equilibrium for the system, these
unknowns may be fully determined.
It frequently occurs that a free-body
of a member will yield an indeter-
minate solution. In this case, look for a
two-force piece connecting this body to
another body, and, by means of a sec-
ond free-body, determine the force in
the two-force piece. If this method
fails because of the same reason as be-
fore, make use of the fact that the
two-force piece is common to the free-
bodies of both systems. Since the two
resultant forces acting on a two-force
piece, although opposite in sense, act
in the same direction and are equal in
magnitude, the unknown of both sys-
tems may be expressed in a new equa-
tion by equating the forces on the two-
force piece as derived from both sys-
tems. Usually, this additional equation
will allow for the solution of. the prob-
lem.
3- Choosing the proper moment center
saves valuable time and effort. The
free-body is of invaluable aid in this
respect. From the principle of the
transmissibility of forces, the lines of
action of forces may be extended by
dotted lines and moment centers may
be chosen from the points of intersec-
tion of these lines. The forces used in
determining the moment center will
disappear in the moment equation. In
paragraph 5 of Techniques of Con-
struction above, the vertical component
of the reaction at the hinge was ob-
tained. The horizontal component could
then be obtained in accordance with the
principle of this paragraph by taking
moments about the point O, in figure 3.
4- The decision as to whether to use a
total reactive force as is, or whether to
use it in terms of its components de-
pends upon the geometry of the figure.
The extent of the calculations neces-

Up in a stratosphere plane you'd breathe oxygen
from a tank... oxygen extracted from liquefied air.
Processing equipment in which the extraction
takes place calls for something extraordinary in
the way of tubing.
Ordinary steel tubes get hazardously brittle in
the 315-below-zero temperature the extraction
process demands—crack like a crisp carrot. Better,
safer, tubes were needed. Industry got them—
from B&amp;W — tubes made of new nickel-alloy steels.
B&amp;W calls these new tubes Nicloys. In refriger-
ation, in making synthetic rubber, in handling
natural gas and strongly corrosive crude oils, in

paper mills, industry is finding that Nicloy tubes
answer many tough problems.
Development of Nicloy tubing is another
manifestation that, for all its years, B&amp;W has
never lost the habit of having new ideas for all
industries.
To technical graduates, B&amp;W offers excellent

MULTIPLE HEAT-TREATING FUNCTIONS
VARIED
In modern heat-treating, adaptability of equipment and
flexibility of fuel are primary influences in any cost-per-
piece analysis. As a typical example of the flexibility of
the productive flames of GAS, this Conjecto-Fired GAS
Furnace is used for a variety of operations without any
change other than regulation of the fuel-mix and tem-
perature controls.
Atwood Vacuum Machine Company, Rockford, Illi-
nois, is equipped to heat-treat pieces ranging from 1
ounce to 1000 pounds, in volume up to 15,000 pounds
daily. Their modern Gas-fired Equipment is adapted for
annealing, carburizing, drawing, hardening, normaliz-
ing, malleableizing, stress relieving, under rigid metal-
lurgical specifications.
Experienced heat-treating specialists like Atwood
Vacuum Machine Company use GAS because this
flexible, controllable, rapid-heating fuel is so readily
adaptable to all types of processing at any required
temperature. The productive flames of GAS are so
flexible that they can be used for any production-line
heating operation, under the most exacting conditions.

sary to determine the length of a mo-
ment-arm is an important considera-
tion in making the decision.
5- The hahit of employing, hoth men-
tally and on the free-body, a cutting
section to isolate a member is a useful
technique. When used in connection
with trusses, it is known as the Method
of Sections, but the principles are em-
ployed on free-bodies in general. (See
Figure 4).
6- In the case where three concurrent
forces are involved in the equilibrium
of a body, a convenient solution may
be affected by making use of the geom-
etry of the free-body. Since the three
forces are in equilibrium, they must
necessarily be coplanar, and the three
forces may be made to act along the
sides of a triangle, the directions of
which are parallel, respectively, to the
forces. The sides of the triangle are
then in proportion, respectively, to the
magnitudes of the forces. By use of
proper geometrical relationships, the
unknown parts of the triangle may be
solved for, and thus the unknown
force(s) may be determined. This
(Continued from page 28)
method is more familiarly known as
Lami's Theorem, which states that if
three concurrent forces are in equilib-
rium, each is proportional to the sine
of the angle between the other forces.
7- Extreme care should be employed
in retaining the original assumption of
the sense of a force. Thus, if several
members of a structure are to be con-
sidered individually, begin with any
particular member and assume the
forces acting upon it. After the arbi-
trary selection of the sense of the vec-
tors acting on this first member is
made, the selection of sense thereafter,
in proceeding to the other memb-ers,
must conform to the selections already
made. To illustrate, if a body A acts
on a body B with a force of 100 lbs.
to the right, then obviously the body B
reacts on the body A with a force of
100 lbs. to the left.
8- If a load is applied at the intersec-
tion of two or more members, there is
sometimes confusion in drawing the
free-body diagram. It is incorrect to
apply the full load in the free-body to
each of the members at this joint. In-
stead, first draw a free-body diagram
of the pin with the load suspended
from the pin, and then pass on to the
free-body of the other members.
Conclusion
It is believed by the author that the
material presented above is inclusive
enough to fulfill the needs required by
a beginning student of Statics in mas-
tering the techniques of the free-body
diagram. Conscientious effort and con-
stant practice are required before these
techniques may become permanent
working possessions. As was mentioned
before, the practice of utilizing, wher-
ever possible, a free-body diagram is
strongly recommended. With a mastery
of the free-body diagram technique at
his command, the student can truly be
said to have "picked a tick from
Statics."
1 One of the better discussions of the free-body diagram
may be found in "Analytical Mechanics for Engineers" by
Seely and Ensign, 3rd ed. rewritten, pp. 66-69, An excel-
lent paragraph, titled "Procedure in the Solution of Prob-
lems in Equilibrium,' contains a six-point description of
the procedure and an illustrative problem, pp. 90-92.

Typical classroom in Nathan Hale School
shows extreme sky brightness; note
dark interior and lack of light on
ceiling.
Nathan Hale School, Toledo, Ohio uses
almost identical classrooms for day-
lighting demonstration.
The old fenestration was replaced with
Insulux Glass Block and a narrow
vision strip. Light-colored desks, ceiling
and walls help reduce brightness con-
trasts.


Advanced lesson in
classroom daylighting
Two rooms in the Nathan Hale School in Toledo,
on the same floor, facing the same direction, were
chosen for this demonstration in classroom day-
lighting. Photographs of both were taken on an
overcast day providing approximately 750 foot-
candles of vertical surface illumination.
Room on upper left shows the method of daylight-
ing typical in a vast majority of school classrooms.
(Decoration obviously is not up to standard.) All
pupils in the room are subjected to a large area of
high brightness. (The average sky brightness
through windows here is 1,500 foot-lamberts.) This
area occupies a large part of the visual field for
children nearest the fenestration. For those farther
away it occupies a smaller portion of the visual
field, but the contrasts with task brightness are
much higher. Contrasts between the sky and tasks
on desks farthest from the light are about 100 to 1.
This is much beyond the limit of what may be
tolerated.
Room on lower left has been redecorated and
refinished in light colors. Insulux Prismatic Glass
Block, No. 351, has been installed above a 30-inch-
high vision strip.
This prismatic block redirects the greater pro-
portion of its transmitted light upward toward the
ceiling. It distributes it broadly over the ceiling.
At the same time it helps to shade the child's eyes
from direct sky brightness. It reduces this bright-

dustries, and the rubber industry.
Still another advance in the field of
rust prevention is the use of a glycerine
bath which has been patented by two
Dutch scientists and which only re-
cently has come to the attention of
American engineers. Clean iron and
steel are dipped into a solution of 300
grams of zinc, 833 grams of phos-
phoric acid, and 193 grams of glycerine
in 110 liters of water for 12 minutes
at 95 °C. The process, it is claimed, will
prevent the iron or steel from rusting
even under the most adverse condi-
tions.
hunting in
automatic controls
The principles of automatic controls
can be demonstrated by considering
their use in the regulation of the out-
put voltage of a d-c generator. With-
out automatic control it is necessary
for an operator to observe constantly
the output voltage by means of a volt-
meter and to adjust the field rheostat
of the generator when necessary to
keep the voltage at the proper value.
One thing should be noticed; there
is no particular relationship between
rheostat setting and voltmeter reading.
That is, for every degree of loading
of the generator there will be a differ-
ent rheostat setting necessary to cause
the voltmeter to read 100 volts, if that
is the desired output voltage.
Notice also that, although the volt-
meter needle must move before the op-
erator will adjust the rheostat, he can
bring the voltage back to exactly 100
volts. This sort of control is called an
astatic control. A static control, on the
other hand, requires a permanent devi-
ation from the desired value in order to
work.
Fig. la shows the circuit diagram of
an astatic voltage regulator. Use is
made of the fact that the force tending
to pull the plunger into the solenoid is
zero when the plunger is at the center
and increases as the plunger is moved
out. After a certain point, the force de-
creases as the plunger is moved still
further out. For this regulator the sole-
noid will be designed so that this force
is constant over a range of plunger po-
sitions, and the regulator will be de-
signed so that this range covers the
range of the rheostat arm. Thus the
force on the plunger depends only on
the voltage applied to the solenoid and
(Continued from page 13)
not on its position. The weight of the
plunger will be equal to the upward
force due to voltage E (the desired
value).
Suppose the load increases and the
output voltage drops. Then the upward
force is less than the weight and the
plunger drops. This decreases R to in-
crease the excitation and bring the volt-
age back up to E. The forces are again
balanced and the plunger stops at this
new position. The adverse effects of
hunting will be considered later.
This astatic regulator can be con-
verted to a static regulator merely by
attaching a spring to the plunger as
shown in fig 1(b). Suppose that the
spring is at its position of rest when
the plunger (and also the rheostat) is
in the center of its range. If the volt-
age drops as before, the plunger drops
and the spring is stretched. For equi-
librium now the upward force has only
to be increased until it equals the
weight minus the upward force of
the spring. Thus the voltage will be
brought back up to a value less than E.
It is evident that the amount of devi-
ation depends upon how stiff the spring
is.

Figure 1
The main difficulty which besets the
regulator designer is hunting, which is
characteristic of such systems unless
special corrective measures are taken.
When a control "hunts," it oscillates
about a new setting before finally com-
ing to rest. Hunting is due to the effect
of inertia and inductive time lags in
the apparatus. The inertia results from
the fact that the plunger has mass and
the time lags are due to inductance in
the various windings. Suppose that ini-
tially equilibrium occurs when the rhe-
ostat is at mid-setting. Suppose the
voltage drops and that the correct po-
sition to compensate for this drop is
that position at which 75% of the re-
sistance is cut out. This voltage drop
causes the upward force on the plunger
to decrease with an inductive time lag
which, in this case, is negligible. The
net downward force accelerates the
plunger downward, moving the rheo-
stat arm. The rise in the excitation cur-
rent lags behind the movement of the
rheostat arm due to the inductance of
the field winding. Thus, when the rheo-
stat reaches the 75% point, the excita-
tion current (and therefore the output
voltage) is not large enough and the
plunger continues to move. When the
excitation current reaches the proper
value the net force on the plunger he-

Figure 2
comes zero, but its inertia carries it
still further. This causes the generator
output voltage to rise above E and a
net upward force begins to act on the
plunger. This finally brings the plunger
to rest and accelerates it upward. The
plunger will then shoot up past the
75% position in the other direction. In
this way the moving parts of the regu-
lator oscillate about and finally come to
rest at their new correct position. It is
clear that whenever the load changes,
the output voltage oscillates about E
and finally comes to rest at E volts.
This action is, in general, quite unde-
sirable.
An analysis of hunting in regulators
can be made by considering the regu-
lator as an amplifier and applying some
well-known principles regarding elec-
tronic amplifiers. Oscillations in these
amplifiers are due to uneven frequency
response and to phase shifts which for
a certain frequency may cause a signal
which is in phase with the input and of
a greater amplitude to be fed back to
the input terminals. "Negative feed-
back" is a means of correcting this sit-
uation.
Suppose that the circuit of a static
(fig lb) regulator is changed as shown
in fig. 2. The a-c generator is able to

Answers the question —
nHow rough is smooth?"
ONE of the reasons Tlmken
Tapered Roller Bearings per-
form with such frictionless, wear-
free ease is the amazingly smooth
surface finish on the rolls and races
—the finest known to modern bear-
ing science.
Now, when you talk about fin-
ishes like this, you're talking about
surface irregularities of only a few
millionths of an inch — irregulari-
ties which are impossible to detect
by any ordinary means. So, when
Timken first began to develop this
finish, one of the biggest obstacles
was the absence of an accurate
method of measuring the roughness
of an apparently smooth surface.
The profilograph pictured above
was the answer. Developed by
Timken in 1928 and steadily im-
proved since then, the profilograph
determines surface irregularities to
within one-millionth of an inch.
Equipped with this measuring stick,
Timken engineers were able to de-
velop new finishing methods and
machines, which have resulted in
the microscopic surface accuracy of
the Timken Bearings you use today.
Every factor in the efficiency of a
bearing is approached at Timken
in this same scientific manner. For
example, Timken makes its own
steel to assure constant quality. And
Timken is the acknowledged lead-
er in: 1. advanced design; 2. preci-
sion manufacture; 3. rigid quality
control; 4. special analysis steels.
No wonder you can always be sure
of uniformly top quality and per-
formance in the Timken Bear-
ings you use. The Timken Roller

put out a small sine wave voltage at
any one of a wide range of frequen-
cies. If the a-c generator puts out a
very low frequency, the rheostat arm,
the excitation current and the output
d-c voltage will be able to follow the
same sinusoidal variation. When the
a-c voltage adds to the battery voltage
E. the output voltage between C and B
will be lower. Due to the sensitivity of
the regulator, the variation of Ecb will
be of greater amplitude than Eab. Thus
A and B are the input terminals and C
and B the output terminals of an am-
plifier.
If the a-c generator frequency in-
creases sufficiently, inertia and induc-
tive time lag will cause a decrease in
the amplitude of the variations of Ecb
and will cause these variations to lag
behind those of Eab. If at some fre-
quency Ecb and Eab are in phase and
the amplitude of variations in Ecb is
still greater than that of Eab. the regu-
lator would hunt if the a-c Eab gener-
ator and battery were removed and A
and C connected. By this means regu-
lators can be analyzed with equations
(Continued from page 32)
describing steady state response to si-
nusoidal excitation, which are more fa-
miliar to most engineers than the dif-
ferential equations describing transient
response. The preceding analysis also
applies to astatic controls, as long as
the a-c frequency does not become low
enough to cause the regulator to hit
the end stops.

Figure 3
Usually hunting can be eliminated
by the addition of a dashpot to the
plunger. If at the frequency where in-
put and output variations are in phase
the dashpot has made the amplitude of
the output oscillations lower than the
input amplitude, hunting will not occur.
For one type of control, the "on-off"
control, oscillations are necessary. This
is the sort of control usually used for
home temperature control where first
full heat and then no heat is applied in
order to produce the desired average
temperature. Thus, in this method of
control, oscillations about the desired
value are essential. Of course, these os-
cillations should be as small as possible.
Fig. 3 shows an on-off control applied
to a d-c generator. A portion of the
field resistance is continually being in-
serted and short circuited. In order to
minimize the load on the vibrating con-
tacts, the resistance involved is usually
made just sufficient to cover the range
from no-load to full-load. Here too,
time lags must be studied by the de-
signer if these oscillations are not to lie
coo large.
It is apparent, then, that by careful
attention to time lags between cause
and effect in various parts of the regu-
lator, the designer can avoid many
costly errors.

ing at this special meeting of the class,
he said, "I forgot."
"That's all right," I said. "You
haven't missed much. What I want you
to do is climb in the back end of the
boiler, make a thorough examination,
and then come out and sketch what you
find."
He did not hesitate. In he dived, and
when he came out he was a sight. He
was soot besmeared over his hands and
face, and his clothes were black. He
never said a word; the whole class
howled. One of the things I loved about
my students was that if they got caught
at anything and were put through the
mill, they took it like men. There was
no "grousing." The boys were very
democratic; the banker's son and the
boy working his way through school
got on together well. There has always
been a fine democratic spirit on the
campus, and I have had much pleasure
in observing it at work.
I feel myself responsible for only
three departments at Michigan in ad-
dition to the mechanical engineering
course. The first department, as I have
mentioned, was that of Marine Engi-
neering and Naval Architecture, which,
with my Navy background, is under-
standable. The other departments were
those of aeronautical engineering and
engineering research.
The first aeronautical engineering
course offered in the United States was
started in our College of Engineering
in 1916. Sadler had formed an Aero
Club in 1910, and for the use of its
members he designed a small wind
tunnel in 1911. This was in the loft of
West Engineering Building. Felix W.
Pawlowski, who had taken the first
course in aeronautical engineering ever
given, that of Marchis in Paris, came
to the United States and wrote a num-
ber of American universities about in-
stituting a course in aeronautical en-
gineering. He received almost no re-
plies to his letters. I was interested. He
came to Michigan in 1914 as an in-
structor in mechanical engineering, lec-
turing informally on aeronautical sub-
jects until 1916, when a curriculum
leading to a degree was established. I
hid this course in the Department of
Marine Engineering and Naval Archi-
tecture for a time, for aeronautical

Remedy for red ink rash'
Say "Ah-h-h," Mr. Executive.
A rash of red ink, hm? Production
costs steadily climbing, you say?
Well, there's an effective medication
for your troubles—one that will help
you cut down those excessive expenses
in a hurry.
The prescription? It's called Carboloy
Cemented Carbide—the hardest metal
made by man. Formed from the powder
you see pictured into blanks for tools,
dies and wear-resisting parts, Carboloy *
is the greatest single factor for reducing
manufacturing costs that modern
industry has ever known, BECAUSE:
(*for executive use only)
1. Carboloy commonly triplut the output
of both men and machines,
2. Regularly increases the quality of
products, and
3. Cuts, forms or draws the toughest,
most abrasive modern alloys with ac-
curacy and speed previously unknown.
That is why Carboloy is held by
authorities to be one of the ten most
important industrial developments of
the past decade.
We Make This Challenge
The odds are 10 to 1 that Carboloy—
the amazing metal of many uses—can
be put to work by our engineers to give
your products higher quality at lower
cost. Call us in for consultation.

engineering was not considered im-
portant enough to make it conspicu-
ous by giving it a prominent place. Un-
der Sadler's care it developed into a
separate department. The first degree
was conferred in 1917. When the East
Engineering Building was built the first
experimental wind tunnel in an Ameri-
can university was constructed. This
was made possible through the assist-
ance of the Daniel Guggenheim fund.
It has been outdistanced by wind tun-
nels built subsequently, but that is one
of the penalties of being a pioneer.
The Department of Engineering Re-
search was established in the fall of
1920. It was inaugurated to meet a
very definite need. It makes available
to industry, particularly Michigan and
midwestern industry, considerable re-
search equipment and a faculty of ex-
pert engineers. This department is the
official channel through which these fa-
cilities are made available to civic and
industrial interests. Students work as
assistants to men engaged in research
problems; sometimes these research
men are employed for special projects,
more often they are members of the
faculty to whom problems in their own
specialized fields are assigned, the
work being done in the laboratories
of the instructional departments with
which these members of the faculty are
associated. No degrees are conferred
by the Department of Engineering Re-
search, its function being largely ad-
ministrative. It has acted as a clearing-
house for industrial problems, both
practical and theoretical. Professor Al-

bert E. White, its director, has played
a large part in making this department
assume its place of leadership. The
only limitations placed upon its use-
fulness are those of laboratory equip-
ment and the time of the faculty mem-
bers. Should the postwar dreams all of
us have for the College of Engineering
materialize, these limitations will dis-
appear, and there will be at the Uni-
versity of Michigan a research pro-
gram which will contribute so greatly
to the welfare of industry and of civil-
ization that we shall wonder why the
program was ever delayed so long.
Here is a task to challenge the imagi-
nation even of engineers. They will not
fail, I am sure.
While we were still in the old Den-
tal Building, the last class of the grad-
uating mechanical engineers was al-
ways held beneath the big tree adjacent
to this building. We sat on the ground,
and I spoke informally. My subject
was nearly always the same. I told
these boys who were going out to take
their first jobs as engineers that the
question of salary was unimportant at
the outset: "Let your employer set his
own figure on what you are worth to
him before he knows you, with the un-
derstanding that as soon as you de-
velop your capacities and abilities for
the job you will be paid what you are
worth." In those days engineering
graduates started at $50 to $75 a
month somewhat as a medical intern
does today, until they learned the prac-
tical phase of their profession. I went
on to tell them that if there turned out
to be something about the job or the
place which did not suit them, they
should talk it over with the man who
employed them and not with their co-
workers. And I added, "When you find
an opportunity which provides more
money or a better job, go to your em-
ployer and tell him so frankly. Then if
you leave you take with you his rec-
ommendation as well as his good
wishes."
This formed a part of my message
to all graduating engineers. It has
seemed to me that loyalty, like polite-
ness, begins at home: and that loyalty
to the engineering profession begins by
loyalty to one's first employer. After
I became dean I made a brief address
to the entire graduating class. Attend-
ance on these occasions was never com-
pulsory; one of my real satisfactions
was the fact that almost invariably
every last man attended. They became
known as the dean's "pep talks"; the
boys said these "send-offs" meant as
much to them as did any part of the
commencement program. Sometimes
for these occasions, I prepared
speeches, and I have recently been
looking over some of these. I find they
bear such high sounding titles as "Suc-
cess," "Object in Life," "Self-Disci-
pline," "Self-Analysis," "Self-Re-
spect," "Integrity," "Loyalty," "Truth,"
"The Textbook of Life"—all platitu-
dinous titles. Yet in rereading these
addresses I find that my words were
always simple and direct from the
heart; that is, I was neither moralizing
nor talking down to my boys. I was
sharing with them the things which
were important to me. They know this.
I was talking over with them the prob-
lems of a man and of an engineer; in
those days problems of character were
not judged to be too unimportant to
discuss frankly.
There was nothing I ever hesitated to
talk about to my engineers. Because
they knew I loved them and thought
well of them, they did not seem to re-
gard my simple, homely subjects as so
much "corn," as I believe the term is
today. Though times have changed, I
believe that if I were able to do so I
could stand before a group of modern
young men who are putting college life
behind them and starting out into the
world and give one of my simple little
talks on honesty, and I believe the boys
would listen, hungry for talk about
things close to the hearts of all of us. I
have found that if you yourself believe
in the things of which you speak, boys
will believe you. No one is quicker to
detect hypocrisy than a college student.
It was my good fortune, because of the
training I received as a boy and later at
the Naval Academy, to believe in the
"homely" virtues. I never spoke to my
boys of theoretical behavior nor of
philosophic concepts of such grandeur
that it required mental agility to follow
me. I spoke to them from my heart.
God pity the educator who develops a
reputation as a wit at the expense of
his students; and God pity the one who
does not know that in the heart of
every young man there is plenty of
room for real sentiment.

WHY THE TREND IS TO Mo HIGH SPEED STEELS
Why do makers—and users—of metal-working
tools go strong for molybdenum high speed steels?
Performance is one answer. In actual opera-
tion, in the form of twist drills, hacksaw blades,
milling cutters, lathe bits and many other tools,
molybdenum steels have proved that they outper-
form 18-4-1. They work longer between grinds,
and they have longer over-all life.*
Cost is another answer. Molybdenum steels cost
from 10^ to 20^ a pound less than 18-4-1, and
they provide more tools per pound of steel be-
cause their density is 6% to 9% lower.
Many of the country's largest users of high
speed steels have standardized on molybdenum
steels. They have done it because they know that
the use of these modern steels lowers production
costs.
*Our booklet on molybdenum high speed steels will give
you proof of these statements. Write for it.

A senior in the Industrial-Mechani-
cal Engineering curriculum, John M.
Cox is a conscientious and determined
young man who shows great promise
in the engineering field. He is a good
organizer and likes to get things done
in an official manner.
John, who is 24 years old, was born
in Detroit and spent his high school
days at Mackenzie High. Upon gradu-
ation from high school in 1942, he en-
rolled at the Engineering School here
at the University. During his first year

he was elected to the Engineering
Council of which he is still a member

John M. Cox
Soon afterwards, John entered the
Army Air Corps as cadet pilot. He re-
ceived additional training and school-
ing and was then sent overseas as a
fighter pilot. He saw service in Italy as
pilot of a P-38, and later as pilot of a
C-46 in the China-Burma-India The-
ater. While in Italy, John was forced
to bail out of his burning plane when
returning from a raid, thereby becom-
ing a member of the famed "Caterpil-
lar Club."
As soon as he was discharged in
January, 1946, John returned to the
University, and resumed his activities
on the Engineering Council. In the
spring of 1947, because of his great
ability for organization, he was chosen
chairman of a committee to revive the
University of Michigan Engineering
Open-House. The Open-House, which
is a biennial exhibit of engineering ad-
vances, was inaugurated in 1913, and
was presented until 1941, when it was
interrupted by the war. Through the
diligent efforts of John Cox and his
committee, the Open-House was a
great success.
Rounding out his extra-curricular
activities, John is a member of the
ASME and is also a staff assistant of
Prescott House of the East Quad-
rangle. After graduation John intends
to take a job with the Pneumatic Engi-
neering Corporation of Denver, Colo-
rado.

The Department of Mechanism and Engineering Drawing occupies the entire long hallway of
the fourth floor of West Engineering Building. It has eleven combined recitation and drawing
rooms, nine office rooms, a library, model room, storage, filing, and shipping room for drawing
exercise sheets, a wood working shop, research laboratory, hallway museum, and the Univer-
sity's Blue Printing facilities. The Department staff of twenty-three teach the three subjects of the
total course in the graphical language of the engineer, Engineering Drawing, together with
special courses for Business Administration, Forestry, and Engineering Law. The Department
assists all of the ten Junior Colleges of the State with course outlines, charts, and exercise sheets:
It provides such service also for all the Junior Colleges of Chicago, and numerous colleges in
other States: California, New Mexico, Montana, North Dakota, Missouri, and New York.
The enrollment in the various subjects of Engineering Drawing reached an all time peak of
1790 in the first term of 1946-1947. It is now approximately 1400. Classes are limited insofar as
possible to twenty students and the methods of visual education are applied to the limit of their
ability. Of necessity the major portion of the students' time is devoted to the acquisition of a
thorough working mastery of the language of Engineering Drawing. Modern engineering
methods have rendered the one-time Art of Engineering Drawing relatively obsolete.
The Department is very proud of its recently completed hallway museum of Things of
Engineering, a silent but most effective lecture hall.

THE EDITOR SPEAKS...
wiuf,?
At regular intervals during his
life, everyone should ask himself
this question : "Is what I am now do-
ing beneficial to me?" If he has any
trouble answering this question, he
had better ask himself: "What can
I do that will be of more benefit to
me than my present pursuits?"
Many people plod through life with-
out giving any thought to this prob-
lem until they find themselves so
deep in a rut that it is too late to get
out.
We doubt if there are many stu-
dents who, more than once during
their college career, have not won-
dered exactly why they are spend-
ing four of the best years of their
life in college; and why they were
spending money for an education
while they could have been working
and earning an income.
Now then, exactly why are we in
an Engineering School? If we were
to ask most graduate engineers about
the profession, they would tell us
that they are never called upon to
use a large part of the knowledge
that they received in college. If not
to equip ourselves with a formidable
collection of knowledge and infor-
mation, exactly what are we doing
here?
The basic reasons for spending
four years in college slaving over
mathematics, physics and engineering
courses is to train ourselves in or-
derly and scientific habits of thought,
to acquire an interest in our field,
and to learn where to find informa-
tion and how to apply it.
A scientific attitude is a necessary
tool of an engineer to aid in the log-
ical attack of the complex problems
facing him. He must be able to ana-
lyze the information at his disposal
and from it work out a satisfactory
solution. He must be able to organ-
ize his work into an efficient and
rapid process. In this manner alone,
the engineer of today may face and
meet the competition of our rapidly
progressing civilization.
Too often the interest that an en-
gineering student has in his field is
a superficial one based mainly upon
its more glamorous aspects. He
should acquaint himself with the du-
ties and responsibilities of the prac-
ticing engineer in his chosen field
and should learn exactly what will
be expected of him in practice. To
be successful he must know what
his field has to offer and cultivate a
genuine interest in it.
Perhaps most important of all our
engineering training is the learning
of where to look for needed infor-
mation. After being surrounded
with texts, phamphlets, charts, and
tables for four years, an engineer-
ing graduate should have a pretty
good idea of where to look for the
facts and figures that he needs.
When he is assigned a problem, he
isn't expected to know the answer
immediately. He will be expected,
however, to know how to go about
working out a solution. He will be
expected to know where to get
needed information, what informa-
tion is relevant and what conclu-
sions can be drawn.
From this we can see that the prime
purpose of an Engineering education
is not the assimilation of facts and
figures, but rather a training in the
basic engineering theorems, the at-
tainment of an understanding of the
engineering field and the acquisition
of the ability to find necessary infor-
mation.
cUipeHdJufi
In surveying the results of this
semester's election of class officers
for the College of Engineering, we
wonder exactly why fraternity men.
who constitute approximately 15 per
cent of the engineering enrollment,
were elected to seven of the nine
offices. Are we to blame the frater-
nity group, which bonds together
and sees to it that its members are
carefully instructed whom to vote
for? No, we can hardly do that, for
any group on campus has a perfect
right to campaign for its own mem-
bers. Rather, we blame the inde-
pendent engineers for their total
lack of interest in campus affairs.
A college education should be
complete. It should contain not only
the principles of engineering but
should deal with subjects so as to
make the life of a graduate as broad
and complete as possible. One of the
included subjects should be citizen-
ship. It is evident from the apathy
with which campus citizenship is re-
ceived that a very real need exists.
If campus citizenship is ignored,
might not also the graduate engineer
ignore national citizenship? If he
does ignore national citizenship, and
some small but well-organized mi-
nority takes the same advantage of
his apathy as was taken here on
campus, the result may not be very
pleasant. It is a well-known fact
that a small but tightly organized
minority group can control the rep-
resentation of a vast number of
people. If we as graduates are to act
as good citizens of our country, we
are going to have to begin here, as
good citizens of the College of En-
gineering.

. . . photographic stress analysis is one of
many industrial uses for light-sensitive Kodak
recording materials.
By cementing strain gauges smaller than postage
stamps to external surfaces, test engineers can
find out about structural behavior deep inside the
material under stress ... so sensitive is the re-
sponse of these little devices to vibration and
strain.
An important contribution to such sensitivity
in instruments of this type is the wide latitude of
Kodak photographic recording materials that are
available. These may be had in all sizes and
speeds for nearly every type of instrument.
Instrument Recording
... another important function of photography

After keeping up with Patron, John Engstrom
enjoys his G-E job of tracking "met" balloons
In February, 1946, after he had happily allowed himself
to become "inactive" in the files or the Reserve Army
Signal Corps, John Engstrom—a family man with two
kids—went looking for his first career-size job.
He was able to rely on the help of an old friend—his
knowledge of electronics.
Ever since he started tinkering with radio sets in his
teens, John had been doing things in electronics—and
electronics had been doing things for him.
At the University of Minnesota he had earned part of
his expenses by servicing radios between hours of studying
for a degree in electrical engineering.
Going directly into the Army after his graduation in
1942, John had received further training in electronics at
Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, and had been sent on a
seven-month electronics assignment to South America.
Later he had been assigned to a Signal Corps communica-
tion team and had helped provide General George Patton's
headquarters with communication during the final vic-
torious drive into Germany. And after V-E Day he had
been flown back to the States to head up an investigation
team to study the propagation of microwaves in low level
ducts over tropical waters.
John Engstrom found his career-size job at General
Electric. Reporting to Electronics Park in Syracuse, N. Y.,
he spent a year in developmental engineering. Today, as
project engineer for the Army-Navy Meteorological Pro-
gram, he is in charge of developing meteorological track-
ing and measuring equipment—a solid foothold in an
electronics future.
For your copy of "Careers in the Electrical Industry,"
write to Dept. 237-6, General Electric Company,
Schenectady, N. Y

John Engstrom admits that his attention perks up when he begins
to think about electronics. He paid part of his college expenses at
Minnesota servicing radios.

In the Army Signal Corps, he continued his work in electronics.
His radio communications team helped keep channels open to
Patton during the drive into Germany.

Why housekeeping gets "lighter" all the time
". . . Woman's work is never done."
True enough. But todays homemakcr — aided by her
modern refrigerator, range, water heater, vacuum cleaner
and other appliances finds more time for family and for
leisure.
And what helps these "automatic servants" operate so
dependably? Better materials for one thing.
Materials on the inside—the unseen working parts of
household standbys. Such as alloy steels, new plasties, car-
bon brushes in motors ... lighter, more compact materials
that make appliances stand up longer and handle with ease.
Materials, too, that you can see... as those stainless steel
surfaces so easy to clean. Or the chemicals in more enduring
waxes and polishes, varnishes and plastic finishes.
Yes, today's housewife enjoys new leisure, new freedom
from drudgery ... thanks to better materials.
Producing these better materials and many others—for
the use oj science and industry and the benefit of mankind
—is the ivork of the people of Lxion Carbide.

Yesterday it was sufficient to call yourself simply
an Electrical, Mechanical or Chemical Engineer.
But today we think in terms of specific functions
performed . . . such as research, design, develop-
ment or application engineering. For example,
Westinghouse employs: - •
RESEARCH ENGINEERS . ..
to investigate physical laws to extend scientific
knowledge—or applied research to solve specific
manufacturing problems, develop new apparatus.
DESIGN ENGINEERS . ..
to design all types of electrical apparatus to meet
new or specialized requirements. Such work involves
not only the writing of mechanical and electrical
specifications but the selection of materials, manu-
facturing processes and many other functions.
DEVELOPMENT ENGINEERS ...
to evolve the desired product in physical form; to
steer the product through infancy until it is a
success.
APPLICATION ENGINEERS . . .
to analyze new projects, recommend needed equip-
ment; and to decide what type of apparatus will do
the best job for the customer.
SERVICE ENGINEERS ...
to direct installation and repair at the customer's
plants; to handle emergency breakdowns. c;.1000:1
These are but a few of the many oppor-
tunities for engineers in the electrical held.
There are many others—in sales or manu-
facturing at Westinghouse. Begin plans for

angle trisection
From the time of Euclid to the pres-
ent the problem of trisecting an angle
geometrically has been attempted
countless numbers of times, and by
countless numbers of people. Even
after mathematicians had proved, alge-
braically, that the solution was impos-
sible, the zeal, vigor, and, above all, the
patience of seekers of immortality have
remained undiminished. Unfortunately,
the geometric trisection of an angle
is as hopeless as expanding 1/3 as
.0.33333333 . . . indefinitely, in the hope
that somewhere along the line some in-
teger other than 3 will appear.
The rules of the game of geometric
construction were handed down to us
from the ancient Greek mathematici-
ans. Simply stated, a geometric con-
struction is one which is effected solely
with a compass and straight-edge—or
with either one. The straight edge per-
mits only the drawing of straight lines;
the compass permits only the drawing
of circles and transferring of distances.
Subject only to these rules, the tri-
section problem has attained its fame.
Yet all that the mathematicians ask is
that only those operations which are
performed in the bisection of an angle
be done in trisecting an angle. And it is
this problem which has proved to be
impossible. Any "solution" which re-
quires more than a compass and
straight-edge, or which requires a trial
and error procedure, or any other de-
vice is not, therefore, a solution to the
problem as stated.
Recently, a "solution" to the trisec-
tion problem by a Chicago engineer
was given much publicity in the newspa-
pers. True, he succeeded in trisecting
the angle, but in doing so he went be-
yond the "rules of the game." Refer-
ring to the diagram, the construction
amounts to the following:
Given: ^ AOB
To construct: 1/3 ^ AOB
1. Construct OC, the ^ bisector of
^AOB.
2. With O as center, and using any
convenient radius (=r), draw cir-
cle O.
3. Construct diameter MN A OC.
4. Construct ME -»■ MN and ND ■*-
MN.
5. (It is here that the conditions of
the problem are violated.) Using
a ruler of width=2r (the dia-
meter of circle O), or a drafting
triangle upon which has been
scribed a line PR parallel to either
of the two shorter sides and at a
distance=2r from that side, place
the ruler so that it always covers
circle O (i.e., so that PR and QS
are always tangent to circle O) and
point P always slides along side
OA. When point Q falls on ME,
draw line OQ. Similarly, using side
OB and line ND. draw OQ'. Then
OQ and OQ' trisect angle AOB.
To prove: Z AOQ = Z QOQ' = Z Q'OB

similarly, Z Q'OB = 4(8= a (Q.E.D.)
And finally, ZQOQ' = /3-2ct = 0-2/3/3
=0/3 = a (Q.E.D.)
The infraction of the rules lies in:
1) the use of two parallel straight-
edges to maintain and transfer a dis-
tance (=2r). 2) The procedure of
maintaining PR and OS always tan-
gent to circle O is inexact (i.e., points
U and V are obtained by a trial-and-
error method, which method denies a
fundamental geometric axiom; viz.,
two points determine a straight line.
The artifice succeeded in locating that
elusive point O on line ME. Probably
the reader now will attempt to locate Q
"legitimately." Good luck—But don't
expect to find it.

Working in a Don- physical research laboratory, this young
man is operating a machine to test plastic materials.
Plastics—a growing field for the young technician
Interest in the use of plastics prows apace. Products in great
variety for the revived consumer's market show their influence
—their special utilitarian value—their ready adaptability
to ideas in design—their distinctive beauty.
Plastic materials are custom made in the laboratory for modern
living. Dow chemists have developed many new plastics
among which is Styron, a material that rose to a leading place
during the war years. It is a remarkable combination of
brilliant beauty and properties of a strictly utilitarian nature.
Today, Styron is in demand for products that range from
toys and costume jewelry to batteries and automobile parts.
Many top-rate refrigerator makers use it in ice compartment
doors, shelves and other parts.
Other Dow plastics arc: Saran for colorful fabrics that can
be cleaned with a damp cloth, non-rusting window screen or
corrosion-resistant pipe and tubing; Saran Film and Ethocel
Sheeting for better packaging; and Ethocel for durable molded
products.
Development, testing and production of these plastic materials
are carried on by technical men with special training. It is
a great and growing Held for young men who can turn their
college training in this direction.

tranformer gage
The Boston Auto Gage Company
has produced an improved leakproof
liquid-level gage for indicating the level
of transformer insulating fluid. This
new gauge utilized two General Elec-
tric sintered alnico permanent magnets,
one inside and the other outside the
case.
-

Courtesy General Electric
Liquid-level sage
A float inside the transformer case
causes the first magnet to move accord-
ing to changes in liquid level. An alu-
minum diaphragm inserted in the case
wall separates this magnet from the
second magnet. The two magnets are
locked together by a powerful mag-
netic flux so that the second will move
a dial indicator in accordance with
liquid level changes.
Since the aluminum diaphragm is
pressure-tight to a minimum of thirty
pounds per square inch, a permanent
seal is effected between the liquid and
the gage proper.
vacuum rectifier tube
The USAAF has sponsored devel-
opment work on a high vacuum, half-
wave rectifier tube that will be used at
altitudes up to 60,000 feet.
Interesting feature of the tube is its
exact fitting base and socket. The glass
base is tapered and ground to fit the
socket like a bottle stopper. This de-
sign keeps any air from being trapped
in the socket, thus preventing flash-
over at high altitudes.
The design of this type can be ap-
plied to all such high altitude tubes.
When being used in areas of high
radio-activity this type of tube will
prevent any external breakdown due to
ionizing action.
midget signal generator
A midget signal generator producing
radio, intermediate and audio frequen-
cies from 2500 cycles through 20 mega-
cycles simultaneously has been devel-
oped by the Clippart Instrument Lab-
oratory. Known as the Signalette, the
device employs a fundamental fre-
quency of approximately 2500 cycles,
with a separation of 2.5 kilocycles per
second between successive harmonics,
to perform the duties of large, high-
priced generators and to speed up radio
servicing routines.
Operating on either 110 volts a.c. or
d.c, the generator output is used for
checking receiver sensitivity; localizing
trouble in receivers; alining intermedi-
ate and radio frequency stages; peak-
ing auto radio antenna and check-
ing shielding, checking audio amplifier
gain; and locating breaks in concealed

Lots of people like to play jack rabbit. Still, as a way of
going to work every morning, we don't see much of a
future for Pogo Sticks. Not even aluminum Pogo Sticks.
But mention any other means of locomotion or trans-
portation and our aluminum "Imagineers" get a gleam
in their eyes. After all, what is more logical than
vehicles made of aluminum? Less weight to move.
More payload.
We turned our imagination loose on that idea years
ago... then engineered our thinking into trains, trucks,
planes, ships. Alcoa's Development Division has a staff
of "Imagineers" who think of nothing else but better
ways to transport people, products, and materials by
using aluminum. Actually, we have four separate staffs
of transportation engineers, one each on railroads, high-
way vehicles, ships and aircraft.
Whatever you do after college, you'll benefit from
that. If you go into transportation, these Alcoa engi-
neers will be working with you to cut costs, speed
schedules, improve facilities. Or if you choose some
field of production, they'll be helping to transport
your materials and finished goods cheaper and faster.

What is a cadet engineer? The an-
swer is found in an idea born more
than forty years ago. Company execu-
tives at that time had visions of a great
organization which would pool some of
the best engineering and administrative
minds of the nation. Of course, if their
visions were to become a reality it was
necessary that men skilled in engineer-
ing be assembled and replacements for
them assured as time went on. The
greatest problem was that of replace-
ments, for eventually it would be nec-
essary to turn the work over to a
younger group, and they would have
to carry on. The engineering colleges
of that day were doing the best they
could with the facilities available to
them, but companies did not feel that
college graduates were as yet ready for
posts of responsibility. Just as the med-
ical graduate must serve an internship
to translate his theory into actual prac-
tice the companies felt that the engi-
neer should have the same sort of in-
ternship.
The technical school operates under
a handicap of not being able to give the
student a fully practical education in
addition to his theory. There is no way
of transporting a bridge or tunnel, a
refinery, a steel plant, or a chemical
plant into the classroom. Only by la-
boring in these centers of engineering
activity can the student truly co-ordi-
nate his theory with practical work.
The solution offered to this problem
by the major industrial concerns was
the founding of the cadet training
schools. Young men whose college rec-
ords showed them to be good prospects
were offered an opportunity to become
cadets, which consisted of taking a reg-
ular course extending over a period of
from 12 to 15 months, during which
they were paid enough to meet their
expenses. At the close of the course
they became eligible for permanent jobs
with the organization, and their ad-
vancement thereafter, depended en-
tirely upon themselves.
Today, many of the large industrial
firms conduct training programs in
much the same manner. Their pro-
grams are carefully planned so as to
assimilate qualified engineers with the

Herman Kaplan
and
Roger L. Daniels
minimum loss of time. Besides provid-
ing the company with replacements this
program offers the average engineer an
opportunity to find a branch of engi-
neering in which he is most likely to
succeed. During the period of training
the student not only learns the com-
pany's policies and products, but he re-
ceives and gains experience for future
assignments that may be open to him.
The actual training work varies with
the company. For example we can use
the Westinghouse training program.
The Westinghouse graduate student
course was set up many years ago. In
college the student learns the funda-
mentals of engineering but he has no
real certainty for which branch he is
best fitted—sales, design, or manufac-
turing. At a cost of several thousand
dollars Westinghouse helps him find
out. Every graduate student at West-
inghouse gets a basic course consisting
of orientation, production, test and
product conference assignments. After
completing this basic work the men are
assigned to sales, engineering or manu-
facturing work, where they receive spe-
cialized training.
For eight weeks or more the student
in the graduate course studies manu-
facturing problems in connection with
some of the most important Westing-
house products, such as motors and
generators, turbines and transformers.
After the shop and classroom work,
the student engineers get office assign-
ments which give them an opportunity
to learn the necessary "paper work"
involved in the production of the
aforementioned products. Meanwhile,
through periodic conferences with
officials of the graduate student train-
ing department, the students have been
classified for particular engineering ac-
tivities, and are then transferred to
regular jobs.
The companies also have training
programs for foreign students. These
men provide the company with capable
foreign representatives. Prior to the
war the majority of the students came
from Europe and the Far East, but
during the last few years the emphasis
has been shifted from Europe to stu-
dents from Latin and South America.
Just recently it was announced five
hundred students from sixty-one for-
eign countries had passed through one
company's industrial training program.
Ideal classrooms for graduate engi-
neers are the testing and laboratory fa-
cilities of the large industrial manufac-
turing corporations. Below, two young
engineers are putting a new oil pipeline
pump through its paces on the hydrau-
lic turbine and centrifugal pump test

A communications radio station is
designed for the purpose of transmit-
ting messages or weather information
from one point to another. It is re-
quired to transmit information in the
most reliable, fastest, and cheapest
manner possible. These stations usually
exist only where it is impossible to use
landline or submarine-cable wire com-
munications, or where such wire com-
munications systems are prohibitively
expensive. Such conditions exist, for
example, in the scattered islands of the
Pacific Ocean and in Alaska. Radio
stations operating in these locations for-
merly used manual "brass-pounding"
operators, except in cases where the
traffic was very heavy. In these cases
high speed automatic radio-telegraph
equipment, capable of handling four
hundred words per minute under opti-
mum conditions, was used. During
World War II, the armed forces' need
for a rapid system of communication,
capable of handling heavy traffic over
long distances with inexperienced op-
erators, caused them to push the devel-
opment of radio teletype, which is now
being used extensively in commercial
systems. This article presents a general
idea of the arrangement and equipment
of a communications station which uses
radio teletype and which operates un-
der normal conditions. The station is
similar to the type used by the Air-
ways and Air Communications Serv-
ice, the Army Communications Service,
the Alaska Communications System,
and some of the modernized commer-
cial message-handling agencies.
Before describing a typical commu-
nications radio station it would be well
to explain the advantages of radio tele-
type and show why it is displacing
older methods. There is a substantial
saving of labor, particularly skilled la-
bor, when teletype is used. Also fewer
occasions for error exist because the
message is transmitted, after it leaves
the first operator, by electrical or me-
chanical methods. The first operator
types the message on a keyboard de-
vice resembling a typewriter, which
converts the message into a series of
electrical mark and space pulses. After

that the message is put on tapes and
may then be transformed back to its
electrical form at will, finally being
typed on a page at the addressee's sta-
tion by a page teleprinter. The use of
radio-teletype radio communications is
destined to replace the old-time manual
operator in the same way that teleg-
raphers were replaced on land lines by
teletypewriters. It takes almost a year
to train a manual, radio operator, but
a radio teletypist can be trained easily
in one month, assuming that both train-
ees are fairly proficient in ordinary
typing. The manual operator will still
be used where traffic is very light or in
situations where size, weight, or ex-
pense of radio teletype equipment is
prohibitive. High-speed automatic ra-
dio telegraph can handle more words
per minute than radio teletype, but to
do so it must have more operators, and
both operators and maintenance per-
sonnel must be highly skilled. Radio
teletype requires only skilled mainte-
nance personnel; it can be used success-
fully over ranges as great as four thou-
sand miles, and is exceptionally well
adapted to relay work.
A communications radio station con-
sists of several sections, usually located
in different places. It is necessary, first
of all, to have a place for accepting and
delivering the messages. The accept-
ance and delivery section should be lo-
cated at a point most convenient for
those who will be sending and receiv-
ing messages. Since for convenience
and efficiency it is advisable to do all
message handling at, or very close to,
this one point, it becomes necessary to
have the teletype machines and controls
for transmitters and receivers located
nearby. (The room containing the tele-
types and controls is known as the con-
trol center.) It is often both impos-
sible and undesirable to locate the ac-
tual transmitters and receivers, with
their space-consuming antennas, in the
crowded area which usually surrounds
the acceptance and delivery section.
Also it is required that the receivers
be located where slight electrical inter-
ference exists. Furthermore, operation
of receivers is best when they are at
some distance from the transmitters.
Therefore, it becomes necessary to have
remotely located transmitters and re-
ceivers controlled by telephone lines,
with signals transmitted and received
over these lines. Remote operation has
been entirely successful over distances
not greater than ten miles, provided the
lines are reasonably well maintained.
The transmitter site must be reason-
ably flat and free of obstructions for
about two hundred feet in all direc-
tions from the antennas. The location
of the receivers should be at least one-

interference; it should be at least one
mile from the transmitter station and
must have room enough for whatever
types of antennas are to be used.
Message Tracing
A description of the arrangement of
a station's components can best be
made by tracing the path of a message
through the station. The particular
method of handling messages described
here is known as the tape relay system,
because the messages are put on tape
perforated in a five-hole code, the tapes
being handled instead of the original
copy of the message.
As each component is mentioned, its
relation to the other components in the
system may be best understood by re-
ferring to the diagram. When using
the diagram it is well to remember that
in most cases there would be more than
one transmitting and one receiving
channel, although for simplicity the
diagram only shows one of each. For
example, say that General Able who is
at the station being described wishes to
send a message to Baker Island. After
a record has been made of his message
in the acceptance and delivery section,
it is transcribed onto teletype tape by
means of a teletype perforator or a
send-receive reperforator, as shown in
the diagram. Any errors made by the
operator may be corrected immediately
on the tape. The tape is then run
through the channel transmitter-distrib-
utor which converts the meaning of the
perforations on the tape into standard
direct current mark and space pulses.
The direct current pulses control an
audio-tone oscillator whose output is
sent over a telephone cable to the trans-
mitter station.
The transmitter station may put the
signal on the air in two different forms,
either by the carrier shift or inter-
rupted carrier methods. The carrier
shift system is analogous to frequency
modulation in that the radio frequency
carrier is shifted about a mean fre-
quency, making the system relatively
free from the effects of fading and
static. The interrupted carrier system
is analogous to amplitude modulation
and is easily affected by fading and
static. The purpose of the transmitter
station is to put the signal on the air in
one of the above two forms.
Now that General Abie's message is
on the air, consider next what happens
when Baker Island's reply to his mes-
sage is received. The receiver station
must convert the signal from radio
frequency to audio frequency and send
it over the telephone lines to the con-
trol center. At the control center the
signal is made to operate a polar relay
which controls the teletype line cur-
rent; the latter will in turn operate a
tape reperforator. Most modern reper-
forators type the message on the tape
at the same time that it is perforated
so that the operator can tell by glanc-
ing at the first few groups whether the
message is for his station or whether
it should be relayed to another station.
Baker Island's reply is addressed only
to the station from which General Able
sent his message so the operator will
put the tape into a transmitter distrib-
utor connected to the room circuit. The
relay system is shown by the fact that
a message sent from Washington to
Tokyo and relayed on its way from
two or three points may be sent almost
as fast as if it were sent directly. Radio
broadcasting weather information by
radio teletype to large numbers of re-
ceiving stations has proved highly suc-
cessful. Special types of radio teletype
equipment have even been used in air-
craft.
Personnel and Maintenance
Personnel for a communications ra-
dio station can be divided into two cat-
agories, operating personnel and main-
tenance personnel. Operating person-
nel are engaged in the actual handling
of messages and tapes. Maintenance

Building, Washington, D.C.
transmitter-distributor controls a page
teleprinter which will print the mes-
sage on a page ready for delivery to
General Able.
One of the chief advantages of the
tape relay system becomes apparent
only when a message is to be relayed
to another station. When the operator
sees that the message is addressed to
another station he needs only to put
the end of the tape in a transmitter-
distributor controlling a channel to the
addressee's station. The tape may be
run through as many transmitter-dis-
tributors as necessary; hence, the mes-
sage can be handled many times with
no chance for human error. The ease
of handling relay messages by the tape
personnel take care of the equipment,
keeping it in proper condition and re-
pairing it when necessary.
Radio teletype makes small demands
on the operators. They need only learn
the routing systems and have practice
in typing on a teletypewriter. When
considering operating personnel, it is
well to remember that one transmitter-
distributor can handle the tapes pro-
duced by two teletypists working at the
same time at a reasonable speed. Main-
tenance personnel must be well trained
and capable. There should be one to
three men, depending upon the size of
the station, who have had considerable
experience. It is desirable to have each

PRESENTS
SENIOR CLASS OFFICERS
bill
Election to the office of class presi-
dent climaxes a varied and successful
college career for Bill Pritula and
brings to the engineering senior class a
leader with outstanding ability and ex-
perience.
Bill hails from Detroit's west side
where he compiled an impressive rec-
ord of activities and athletics at Chad-
sey High School. He received one of
the twenty-five Michigan Alumni Un-
dergraduate Scholarships which are
given each year in the Detroit area on
the basis of competitive examinations
and entered the Chemical Engineering
Department in the fall of 1940. Bill
went out for football and soon became
known as one of the "iron men" in the
famed "seven oak posts" line in 1942.
Upon his return from service with
the Army Engineers'in the Philippines
in the fall of 1946, Bill started where
he left off in the spring of 1943 and
has since been outstanding in scholar-
ship, activities and athletics.
Bill is a member of Tau Beta Pi,
Vulcans, M Club, Engineering Council
and Kappa Sigma fraternity and played
his last football game for the Wolver-
ines in the 1948 Rose Bowl.
Bill was married before entering the
Army and now lives with his wife,
Irene, at the University Terrace Apart-
ments. Since December, 1946 the cen-
ter of attraction in the Pritula's home
life has been their daughter, Joyce
Ann.
As class president, Bill wants to see
an efficient class organization set up.
Upon being interviewed after his elec-
tion, Bill made the following statement
to the TECHNIC: "I have discovered
that there exists a very friendly feeling
and a high spirit among the seniors of
the engineering school who will be
graduating soon, and I will do every-
thing to make this last year preserve
this friendliness and spirit."
dick
On the Sunday following the class
election Dick Dugan returned from an
upper peninsula deer hunting trip
(bagged: one six point 190 pound
buck) to find himself the new vice-
president of the senior class of the
engine school. This was by no means
his first major accomplishment, for
many laurels have been his ever since
high school days. At Peekskill High
School, in Peekskill, N. Y., Dick was
president of the senior honor society
and president of the "Fourth Estate"
press club. He distinguished himself in
athletics by holding the Westchester
diving championship for two years and
winning the Hudson River League
pole vaulting championship. Besides
all this, he was chosen to represent his
alma mater at the Empire Boys State.
Dick's college days began in Septem-
ber 1942, here at the University. After
two semesters as a civilian, during
chosen a man who possesses a rare
combination of ability, judgment and
personality. He is sincerely interested
in bringing to the seniors the benefits
to be derived from a smoothly func-
tioning class organization.
John was raised in Rochester, Mich-
igan, and started his college career at
the University of Arizona, which he
describes as being "really a nice place."
His education was interrupted when he
joined the Army Air Corps to serve
with the 484th Bomber Wing of the
15th Air Force in Italy.
John transferred to the University
of Michigan in 1945 and took up his
studies in the department of Mechani-
cal Engineering. While on campus,
John was engaged in many activities
and at the present time holds member-
ship in Tau Beta Pi, ASME, Engi-
neering Council and Phi Gamma Delta
fraternity. Today, 1364 Geddes is the
scene of John's home life, where he
lives with his wife, Barbara, and their
daughter, Marion.
While in office, John intends to work
toward coordinating the engineering
school into a strongly organized group,
to help in starting an engineering

tour of duty in the Pacific theater and
a total of thirty four months in service,
Dick returned to Ann Arbor. Since
then, while working for a degree in
Industrial - Mechanical Engineering
he has been active in the affairs of

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Dave entered the University in the
fall of 1941 and enrolled in the Marine
Engineering Department and the
NROTC. He joined Sigma Rho Tau,
became a charter member of the old
Wolverine Club and in 1942 was initi-
ated into Alpha Tau Omega Fra-
ternity.
In April, 1943, Dave transferred to
Naval Aviation and went East that
stimulated by early experience in home-
made chemistry sets (of the explosive
variety), Hugh entered the University
of Michigan with a degree in Chemical
Engineering as his goal.
After a year here, he entered the
Naval Air Training Program in which
he received training as a radio tech-
nican. Discharged in 1946, as an elec-
tronics instructor, he returned to
Michigan with a stimulated interest in

summer to work for Gibbs and Cox,
Naval Architects, until his active duty
orders came through in August. He
won his wings in April 1945 and was
assigned to night fighter training duty
in Texas. His discharge came in time
to permit his return to Michigan for
the spring semester of 1946. At that
time he transferred to the new Mechan-
ical-Industrial Department.
Dave's postwar activities include
election to the job of house manager
of ATO. He found this not only his
most interesting and practical job, but
also the most worrisome, considering
crowded conditions and inflation. Other
recent activities include membership
in the Student Legislature, Engineer-
ing Honor Council, and Engineering
Executive Council.
JUNIOR CLASS OFFICERS

His election to the co-presidency of
the Junior class in the Engineering
College was the most recent step in the
varied career of Hugh Kennedy,
whose many and diversified interests
denote a person who is able to do many
things and do them well.
Born in Detroit on May 27, 1926,
he entered Highland Park High School

later to combine with a law degree.
Among his campus activities ex-
clusive of his executive position in
the Junior class are: member of Phi
Psi Fraternity, member of the Honor
Committee of the Engineering Council,
and treasurer of AIEE.
bruce
Bruce hails from Poland. Ohio, which
is near Youngstown. After graduating
from high school in Poland in 1940.
Bruce started his engineering studies at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Two
semesters at R.P.I, were enough, so in
September 1941. he came west to Ann
Arbor.
Lockwood has always been interested
in sailing. At the present time he is
Fleet Captain of the University of
Michigan Sailing Club. Back in '41 he
joined the NROTC, and with the com-
ing of the war he was placed on active
duty. He spent about three-and-a-half
years on active duty with the Navy.
After attending Midshipmen's school at
Notre Dame, he was placed in charge of
a mine sweeper.
Bruce is enrolled in the Naval Archi-
tecture branch of the engineering school.
He expects to graduate in 1949, but at
the present time he has ho plans for
after graduation.
Although he is interested in all sports
his favorite is sailing. Besides his active
work with the sailing club, he is a mem-
ber of Quarterdeck. Theta Ni frater-
nity of which he was a president last
year, and the IFC, of which he is
secretary-treasurer. In his spare time,
Bruce has taken on the duties of ticket
chairman of this year's J-Hop.
don
After the ballots were counted last
fall, Don Barnett emerged victorious in
the race for secretary of the Junior
Class. Don, who comes from Bethalto,
Illinois, has been in engine school since
the fall of 1945. The six years' interim
in Don's life from June 1939 when he
graduated from Wood River, Illinois,
high school, until the time he entered
Michigan includes a story of his life in
the naval service.
Barnett was in the Naval Air Corps
for about three-and-a-half years. He
was a pilot, and also qualified as a navi-
gator. Don's overseas duty was centered
around England. He flew anti-submarine
patrol, and convoy coverage patrol in
B-24 bombers.
Don's main hobby is flying. He is in-
terested in photography too, and takes
part in as many sports as he can. Don
calls the Theta Xi house his home in
Ann Arbor.
After he graduates in 1949 Don wants
to work for a master's degree in Busi-
ness Administration, and enter business
in industrial management, rather than
in a highly technical capacity. He is
preparing now by taking a Mechanical-
Industrial course.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


'by
GERARD H. GICZEWSKI, '49E
The subject of "Engineering Educa-
tion" is of interest and of utmost im-
portance in our present and ever
increasing complex world. Since the
power of a nation lies in its youth and
even to a greater degree in the abilities
of its future engineers and other tech-
nical personnel, the subject becomes
doubly important.
For several decades the educational
institutions of our nation have em-
ployed the same teaching methods. Not
only have the methods remained the
same but in many instances the same
personnel is enforcing them. Some of
the teaching methods, although satis-
factory in 1915, are insufficient in
themselves for our present educational
system. For some unknown reason
present-day educators are reluctant to
make any changes in the engineering
curricula or in the method of teaching.
The reasons for the opposition have
never been determined; at least, they
have never been made public.
The majority of revisions in engi-
neering education could be listed un-
der: 1) professorial requirements, 2)
curricula revision, 3) visual aids, 4)
laboratory work, 5) grading system.
Professional Requirements
With the conclusion of World War
II the university campuses of the Unit-
ed States were greeted with an influx
of returning servicemen. Some came to
realize a childhood dream—a college
education. The universities were faced
with the problem of obtaining a suffi-
cient number of qualified professors to
care for the additional enrollment. The
basis which the universities through-
out the country used to select qualified
professors and instructors is not de-
terminable. At any rate, the professors
and instructors were not of the caliber
of the late Dean Cooley who once said,
"The greatest satisfaction of my life
was direct contact with students. I
loved those boys. I loved them when
they entered as freshmen with only the
haziest idea of what engineering meant
or when they were seniors and had
learned all that we could teach them
and were ready to try their wings as
young engineers." It is impossible to

Gerard H. Giczewski
expect every professor to be of the cal-
iber of Dean Cooley; however, if every
professor measured up to one quarter
per cent of this standard our univer-
sities would be staffed with excellent
men.
The present problem with the pro-
fessorial staffs of the nation's univer-
sities is that the average professor's
primary interest is not teaching. This to
a great extent is due to economic pres-
sure. In most instances, the teaching
profession is underpaid and professors
have turned to research and text-book
writing for an additional source of in-
come. Once a professor begins to di-
vide his time between the classroom
and the research center, one or the
other will be neglected. The final analy-
sis has shown that in the majority of
cases the student was the one who re-
ceived less attention. This condition has
led to an indifferent attitude on the
part of certain professors. The profes-
sor who enters a classroom and begins
to read the day's assignment from his
textbook might just as well dismiss the
class immediately. The professor who
gives a problem on an examination and
returns to the class the following period
unable to solve the same problem after
fifty minutes of concentrated effort
leaves the class slightly bewildered. The
professor, acting in the capacity of stu-
dent adviser, who is continually too
busy to discuss the student's problems
does not offer the slightest means for
building a bond of friendship between
himself and the student. All of these
neglects, on the part of university pro-
fessorial staffs, have led to broadening
the gap between professors and stu-
dents.
In this nation's large universities lit-
tle or nothing is done concerning hu-
man-relations ; as a matter of fact, they
are almost totally non-existent. The
professor-student relationship has de-
teriorated to the point where the stu-
dent's name only exists in the profes-
sor's grading book. This situation is all
too evident from the fact that many
professors do not even know the stu-
dents they are teaching. The blame for
this complete lack of human relations,
supposedly is due to the large classes
and additional work required of pro-
fessors. This, however, is not the case
which is proved quite conclusively by
the fact that some professors, whose
profession is teaching, realize their re-
sponsibility to the student and do their
utmost to aid the student in all possible
ways.
Though the foregoing situation is
regretful, it is nevertheless quite grat-
ifying to see that some professors still
remember that their primary duty is to
teach the student all they know and at
the same time maintain a friendly
professor-student relation. It is to these
professors, who require a high stand-
ard of work from their students and
maintain a higher standard themselves;
who have time to discuss the many
problems which the engineering stu-
dent will encounter over a period of
years in college; who have an encour-
aging word to say to former students
when meeting them; who are inter-
ested in the outside activities of the en-
gineering student; and who realize
their moral responsibility as well as
their legal responsibility to the student,
that the young engineering student and
the world in general are looking for
guidance.
The teaching graduate students and
the teaching-fellows have in many in-
stances done an excellent job. At times,
however, these inexperienced and book-
iearned young men are teaching courses
that require men with experience.

xb-48
The XB-48, largest conventional de-
sign, jet powered plane built thus far,
is now undergoing advanced flight test-
ing. The plane is powered by six Gen-
eral Electric gas turbine engines, which
are housed in a nest of three in each
wing. These engines provide a total
thrust of 24,000 pounds and will enable
the big bomber to outrun all but the
fastest pursuit planes.
The plane was built in the Baltimore
plant of the Martin Company and
was completed in June of this year. It
was first flight-tested on June 22, 1947
on a 73-mile hop to the Patuxent Naval
Air Station, and has since undergone
all types of tests to obtain data to be
used in the future construction of large
jet type planes.
One interesting feature of this plane
is its "bicycle type" landing gear. Two
main sets of wheels are placed in tan-
dem under the fuselage and retract up
into the fuselage when the plane is in
flight. A small "outrigger" wheel near
each wingtip provides stability when
the plane is landing or taxiing. When
the big plane comes in for a landing at
the proper angle a four-point landing
will result.
This unique landing gear arrange-
ment was necessitated by the thin, high
speed wing of the XB-48. There was
not enough room in the wing for con-
ventional type wheels, so the bicycle
type gear was designed especially for
this plane.
Another notable feature of this plane
is its full width landing flaps which ex-
tend on either side of the jet housings
to the wing tip and the fuselage.
A very tight production schedule was
maintained during the construction of
the XB-48. As a result the plane was
completed in just thirteen months from
the time the project was started in
February, 1946.
According to performance figures re-
leased to date, the XB-48 has a top
speed in excess of 480 miles-per-hour.
The craft is 85 feet long, 27 feet high
and has a wing span of 108 feet, 4
inches. The six gas turbine engines
each have a rated thrust of 4,000
pounds and enable the plane to take off
carrying a bomb load in excess of ten
tons. The total empty weight of the
plane is 58,500 pounds and the tactical
radius of the craft exceeds 800 miles.
There are three members in the crew.
The XB-48 represents the latest step
in the Army Air Force's program of
improvement of both its fighter and
bomber types of all-jet aircraft.

With the system of television broad-
casting now in use, television programs
are available to only a very small per-
centage of the American public. It is
to offset this handicap and provide

Derrick being used to install the
grams in every living room that strat-
ovision is being developed.
The range of the present type ground
television station is limited due to the
fact that at the required ultra-high fre-
quencies the waves are not reflected to
earth by the ionsphere but continue on
a straight line out into space. Strato-
vision overcomes this difficulty by lo-
cating the transmitting and network re-
lay stations in airplanes flying at an al-
titude of approximately 30,000 feet.
At the 30,000-foot altitude the planes
ride above the usual storm belts and
programs broadcast by the planes cov-
er an area of approximately 400 miles
in diameter.
The stratovision process is now in
the advanced testing stage. A B-29
plane has been rebuilt to accommodate
the receivers and transmitters neces-
sary. In addition it has been equipped
with a 25-foot streamlined transmit-
ting antenna. This antenna will project
vertically downward from the fuselage
of the plane and when not in use will
be folded hydraulically into the mod-
ified former bomb bay of the plane.
After the present tests are com-
pleted, engineers will use the data
gathered to design a plane especially
suited for stratovision service.
The plane will have to be large
enough to accommodate the heavy load
of transmitting and receiving equip-
ment, yet have a cruising speed of only
about 175 miles per hour to enable the
plane to stay easily on its assigned sta-
tion. Ability to remain aloft for long
big receiving antenna on the tail of a B-29
periods and stability are two other fac-
tors required in a plane for this type of
service.
By 1950 a coast-to-coast network of
stratovision stations covering virtually
all of the populated areas of the Unit-
ed States with but twelve planes is en-
visioned. The programs would origi-
nate, for instance, in Hollywood. A
small transmitter located near the stu-
dio would broadcast the program to the
nearest stratovision plane which would,
in turn, rebroadcast the signals in
its own area and relay the program

through other stratovision planes to all
parts of the country.
The investment inherent in this type
of enterprise is relatively small when
compared with the present system of
relaying programs from one ground
station to another. In fact, the cost of
a cross country coaxial transmission
line with its necessary booster stations
will virtually prohibit this type of net-
work for many years to come.
Another advantage of the aerial sys-
tem is that frequency modulation radio

on Tuesday, November 25. The initia-
tion was followed by a banquet at the
Michigan Union. Mr. George Chute,
application engineer in Detroit for the
General Electric Company and a Mich-
igan alumnus, talked on the attributes
of a successful engineer outside the en-
gineering field itself.
The new members initiated were:
Donald Allen, Mel Bondy, Thomas
Corn, Richard Daniel, Ralph DeGrand,
Harlan Frerking, Robert Ginn, Ray
Holt, Donald Jones, Byron Mays, Da-
vid Plevin, Richard Stroebe, Jack Un-
derwood, Robert Vehn and Donald
Yost.
Election of officers for the spring
term were held on December 9, and
the following men were elected: Don-
ald Sagaser, president; Thomas Corn,
vice-president; David Plevin, secre-
tary; Robert Vehn, treasurer; and Jack
Underwood, Engineering Council rep-
resentative.
Eastern Field Trip
The student branches of the AIEE-
IRE and Eta Kappa Nu are sponsor-
ing an extended field trip for electri-
cal engineering students to plants and
laboratories in the east. The tour will
include such cities as Pittsburgh, Wash-
ington, D. C, New York, Schnectady,
Rochester, and Niagara Falls, and will
take about nine days to complete. The
time set for the inspection tour is
Easter vacation, April 2 to April 11. A
special bus has been chartered for the
group and sleeping accommodations
will be arranged for in advance.
Plants and laboratories on the itin-
erary now include the following: West-
inghouse, at East Pittsburgh; R.C.A.
Laboratories, at Princeton, N.J.; West-
inghouse, at Bloomfield, N.J.; Bell
Laboratories, at New York City; Gen-
eral Electric, at Schnectady, N.Y.;
Eastman Kodak, at Rochester, N.Y.;

and the power plant at Niagara Falls,
N.Y. These plants have been contacted
and have indicated that they will pro-
vide a complete and informative tour
of their operations.
In addition to the inspection tours,
the student making the trip will have
ample time to do any sight-seeing he
desires on his own. Every possible ef-
fort has been made to leave evenings
free in each city visited.
Reservations for the trip may be
made at the AIREE-IRE office in the
East Engineering Building. Reserva-
tions should be made as soon as pos-
sible as space on the bus is limited.
AICHE
Delivering a talk, "Industrial Oppor-
tunities for the Chemical Engineer,"
Mr. J. J. Schaefer from Wyandotte
Chemicals Corporation on January 6
began a series of informative lectures
to be sponsored by the AIChE during
the spring semester.
According to Burton Eubank, presi-
dent of AIChE, "Student Chem Engi-
neers have expressed the feeling that
they are insufficiently informed to an-
swer interviewer's questions concern-
ing the type of job they would prefer
with a particular industrial organiza-
tion. It is hoped that speakers promi-
nent in the field of Chemical Engineer-
ing will be able to present a clearer ex-
planation of the classes of work avail-
able."
Sigma Rho Tau
Sigma Rho Tau, engineering speech
society, completed its fall semester
program with the selection of a cham-
pionship debating team, one ot six
arguing the relative merits of cen-
tralized airports. Coached by Charles
Chadwick, Speech Chairman of the
organization, the team composed of
Russel Parkinson and Louis Klein,
team co-chairman, Raymond Fleischer
and Dick Zylowski successfully op-
posed the question in all of their de-
bates with other teams.
Finalists in the story-telling contest
held around Union coffee tables on
January 6, were Russel Parkinson,
H. Clinton Boothe, Edward Eaton and
Ellsworth Renier. By membership
vote, Russ Parkinson and Ed Eaton
tied for top honors in the event.
Triangles
The Junior engineering honorary,
Triangles, has announced its list of
elections for the fall semester, 1947.
New initiates include Mr. Wilfred
Senseman of the Department of En-
gineering English; Edwin T. Grimes,
Stanley J. Ryckman, treasurer and
James M. Chandler.
David W. Lake, Lloyd A. Heneveld,
Roger H. Kessler, John A. McDonald,
William S. Hickey, and Lexie E. Her-
rin, II, secretary, complete the list.
AIME
Mr. George Timmons of the Climax
Molybdenum Corporation opened the
fall program of the American Institute
of Metallurgical Engineers, student
chapter, with a lecutre on "Temper
Embrittlement." The causes, effects
and methods for the prevention were
presented.
In order to increase their interest
and knowledge of the field of metal-
lurgy, the members of the AIME are
planning a program of speakers from
the field as well as trips to some of the
major industries. In line with this pro-
gram, they have visited Haskins, Great
Lakes Steel and Buick, and are ar-
ranging similar trips for the spring
semester.
ASME
At a January 8 open meeting of the
American Society of Mechanical En-
gineers, three moving pictures were
shown which outlined the methods and
processes of manufacture in several
leading industries. The pictures were
"Die Castings," a color film recently
released by the New Jersey Zinc which
showed the various uses and applica-
tions of die castings and outlined the
processes of manufacture; "Powder
Metallurgy", a picture which por-
trayed the various manufacturing pro-
cedures used in making bronze bear-
ings from powder; and "Looking
Through Glass," a picture snowing
the modern methods used in the pro-
duction of glass articles of all sizes
and shapes. About 125 persons were
present at the meeting.

This "Cross Roads" guide plate through which
pulp-insulated wires are rushing, keeps the wires
in their proper relative position while being
twisted into units of 101 pairs before being fash-
ioned into a telephone cable. The wires passing
through the guide plate to the flyer strander are
kept at a uniform tension by means of a torque
motor and a very sensitive control device at each
of the 101 supply reels. Designed by Western
Electric engineers, this mechanism prevents de-

Our American concept of radio is tluit it is of the people and for the people.'
Freedom to LISTEN - Freedom to LOOK
As the world grows smaller, tlie ques-
tion of international communications
and world understanding grows larger.
The most important phase of this prob-
lem is Freedom to Listen and Freedom
to Look—for all peoples of the world.
Radio, by its very nature, is a medium
of mass communication; it is a carrier of
intelligence. It delivers ideas with an
impact that is powerful ... Its essence
is freedom—liberty of thought and of
speech.
Radio should make a prisoner of no
man and it should make no man its
slave. No one should be forced to listen
and no one compelled to refrain from
listening. Always and everywhere, it
should be the prerogative of every lis-
tener to turn his receiver on or off, of his
own free will.
The principle of Freedom to Listen
should be established for all peoples
without restriction or fear. This is as
important as Freedom of Speech and
Freedom of the Press.
Television is on the way and moving
steadily forward. Television fires the
imagination, and the day is foreseen
when we shall look around the earth
from city to city, and nation to nation,
as easily as we now listen to global
broadcasts. Therefore, Freedom to Look
is as important as Freedom to Listen, for
the combination of these will be the
radio of the future.
The "Voice of Peace" must speak
around this planet and be heard by all
people everywhere, no matter what their
race, or creed, or political philosophies."

originally set up to provide men to per-
form testing operations on apparatus
being built by the company. It was
soon discovered, however, that the pro-
gram afforded an excellent means for
testing and developing the students
themselves, as they performed their
testing duties. The Test Course has
since become the source of recruitment
of almost the entire engineering per-
sonnel of the company. Men enrolled
in the program are graduates of engi-
neering colleges or are men with a
comparable technical or practical back-
ground. They are trained to become in-
timately familiar with the construction
and operation of all kinds of electrical
apparatus, but the actual emphasis is
on training for responsibility, and to
that end the young men are completely
in charge of the work.
Just recently, Harry A. Winner,
General Electric vice president in
charge of engineering policy, an-
nounced that an increasing need for
"exceptionally trained engineers," has
caused the General Electric Company
to expand its Advanced Engineering
Program. The Advanced Engineering
Program, part of the company's one-
million - dollar - a - year - employee-
education plan, instructs young engi-
neers in highly-specialized fields in-
cluding fluid mechanics, electronics,
and electro-mechanical engineering.
Although the demand for highly spe-
cialized engineers is small compared to
the over-all requirements of the com-
pany, there is an increasing need for
men with better and more highly tech-
nical training. The quality of young
engineers with the company last year
has permitted expansion of the train-
ing course. The need at the present
time is accentuated by the curtailment
of the advanced training program dur-
ing the war, and also by the expansion
of the company into new fields and in-
to production of more highly technical
equipment.
Thus we can see fhat this program
will continue to aid the graduate engi-
neer by bolstering his college degree
with a wealth of varied experience.
The young engineer is now in a posi-
tion to choose the line of work for
which he is best fitted.

Radio teletype equipment is compli-
cated and requires careful maintenance.
A system, of inspections and testing of
the equipment called preventative main-
tenance must be used, if interruptions
of service are to be avoided. Preventa-
tive maintenance usually follows this
procedure: every day all meter read-
ings are recorded and compared with
previous readings. A change in the me-
ter reading indicates that trouble is de-
veloping. Once a month the interior of
the equipment is vacuum cleaned, tubes
checked, relays inspected, and the
equipment looked over in general for
possible disturbances. Sometimes it will
be necessary to retime transmitters and
receivers slightly when their output be-
comes too low; temperature changes
will also make retiming necessary.

teletype system works. Consider first
the operation of a carrier shift trans-
mitter. The carrier shift system is the
most widely used and has a longer
range, so it is the more important. As
the name might imply, the frequency
of the transmitter is shifted about a
mean point. When operating in the high
frequency range, the shift is commonly
425 cycles-per-second about the mean
frequency, or a total shift of 850 cycles.

played a part in virtually every great engineering

For example, when teletype line cur-
rent is flowing the output frequency of
the transmitter might be 3,000,850
cycles and when the line current is not
flowing the frequency of the transmit-
ter would be 3,000,000 cycles. The fre-
quency shift in the transmitter may be
accomplished by switching the trans-
mitter from one crystal to another
whose frequency differs by 850 cycles.
The switching is accomplished by a po-
lar relay operated by an audio tone
coming from the control center. Diffi-
culty has been experienced in obtaining
crystals with frequency characteristics
sufficiently accurate for use in this
manner; instead, a reactance tube os-
cillator is being used. The reactance
tube oscillator has been highly suc-
cessful because its frequency can be
changed conveniently by altering the
reactance in its circuit. The reactance
is changed by a polar relay operated by
the tone from the control center.
The interrupted carrier system is
much less complicated than the carrier
shift system, but it is limited to shorter
distances and is most reliable when low
frequencies are used. A standard, con-
tinuous-wave radio transmitter is used
and is keyed in the normal manner
with a tone keyer controlled by the
tone from the control center. The con-
tinuous wave output of the transmitter
is made to correspond exactly to the
mark and space pulses of the teletype
line current.
Diversity reception is necessary at
the receiver station if radio teletype is
to be used over distances great enough
to make fading possible. The diversity
principle involves the use of several re-

ceivers operating under different con-
ditions and the selection automatically
of the signal that is being received best.
There are two types of diversity recep-
tion, frequency diversity and space di-
versity. The frequency diversity prin-
ciple makes use of the fact that if two
signals of different frequency are sent
between the same two points, when one
has faded to minimum strength the
other will probably be at maximum
strength. Space diversity is such that if
a signal of single frequency is received
by two antennas spaced three-quarters
of a wave length apart, when one sig-
nal fades to minimum strength the
other will be at maximum strength. A
diversity control is used to take, auto-
matically, the output from that re-
ceiver which is receiving the best sig-
nal. Combinations of space and fre-
quency diversity, employing as many as
five receivers, are often used.
Frequency diversity is used if fre-
quencies for it are available and space
is limited. Space diversity is used when
frequencies are not available and when
plenty of space exists at the receiver
station. Usually the message is trans-
(Continued jrom page 24)
mitted simultaneously on two or more
widely separated communications fre-
quencies. The receiving station may
then choose the frequencies or fre-
quency that is "coming in" best. If the
receiver station is using frequency di-
versity its operators will tune their re-
ceivers to each of the frequencies be-
ing used. If, on the other hand, the sta-
tion is using space diversity the re-
ceivers will be tuned to one frequency
but connected to antennas spaced three-
quarters of a wavelength apart. The
size of an antenna field for this type of
receiving becomes quite impressive
when one computes that three-quarters
of a wave length at high communica-
tions frequencies may be as much as
three hundred and seventy feet long.
Good directional antennas require con-
siderable space also. A standard vee
type may he five hundred feet long and
a rhombic antenna may be from one
thousand to fifteen hundred feet long.
The foregoing antennas derive their
names from their shape and are used
because they have directional proper-
ties, i.e., they receive only along one
line. The directional effect makes the
desired signal stronger and interfer-
ence weaker.
The receivers station contains equip-
ment which combined with the diver-
sity control converts the signal to audio
tones of 2,975 and 2,125 cycles-per-sec-
ond. The tones are run through limiter
circuits to insure a constant amplitude
before leaving the usual remotely lo-
cated receivers station. When the sig-
nal is received at the control center
over the telephone lines, It is run
through a combination of amplifiers,
audio filters, rectifiers, limiters, and
finally a polar relay. The polar relay
controls the local teletype line current,
breaking it up into the interrupted di-
rect current customarily used for oper-
ating teletype equipment. If the inter-
rupted carrier system is used, the out-
put of the receiver or the diversity con-
trol is used to operate an audio tone
keyer which sends an interrupted one
thousand cycle tone over the line from
the receiver station to the control cen-
ter. At the control center the 1000
cycles-per-second tone operates a relay
controlling the standard teletype line
current.

There's Truth in this "Tall Story
it
IF you think of all valves in this
plant as one valve, you'll see the
truth in this trick photo. Valves,
collectively, represent one of the
biggest investments in equipment
in any plant.
With wages and material costs
highest ever, it is just as important
for management to keep a sharp eye
on valve maintenance as it is on
opera ting costs of larger plant units.
Excessive maintenance of one
inferior valve is insignificant, but,
multiplied by thousand*, it is a
serious drain on operating budgets.
Jenkins Bros, helps manage-
ment meet this problem two ways.
First, by building extra endurance
into Jenkins Valves, making them
the longest-lasting, lowest - upkeep
valves that money can buy. Second,
with advice from Jenkins Engineers
on any question of proper selection,
installation, or main-
tenance.
That's why, for all
new installations, for
all replacements, alert
management relies on Jenkins qual-
ity and engineering service for low-
est valve costs in the long run. Sold

For Students of Science and
Engineering
Weaving of nylon yarn required the
development of special sizing material
Problem solved by Du Pont men
with many types of training
Each new product that is created in the
laboratory seems to bring with it a
new set of problems to challenge the
ingenuity of the scientist. An outstand-
ing instance of this is nylon. To make
practicable the weaving of nylon into
textiles, it was necessary to develop
an entirely new slasher sizing material
—a coating to make the filaments ad-
here to one another, protect the yarn
from abrasion and keep it clean. Sizes
used on other fibers proved unsatisfac-
tory on nylon, because of its unique
chemical composition.
Five candidates were exhaustively
tested by Du Pont men. Best by far
proved to be polymethacrylic acid
(PMA), [CHs=C(CH3)COOH]», possi-
bly because its acidic nature is favorable
to hydrogen bonding with the polya-
mide structure of nylon.
Many technical problems involved
(1) After weaving, sizing has to be re-
moved by water. PMA dissolves in
water readily up to 10% at room tem-
peratures, but precipitates between 70-
80° C. A way had to be found to prevent
precipitation at the normal scouring
temperature of 100° C.
(2) PMA sets to a brittle, glassy
material on fibers, giving a harsh wrap.
Suitable plasticizers such as sulfonated
vegetable and mineral oils, glycols and
other polyhydric alcohols had to be
found to correct this condition and permit
stretching and flexing of the yarn with-
out film impairment.
(3) Good dispersing agents were nec-
essary so that the powdered PMA would
not agglomerate as it dissolved in the
sizing bath.

G. W. Fassett, B.S. in Chemistry, Augustana '36,
and W. A. Franla, M.S. in Chemical Engineering,
North Dakota '34, inspect woven fabric made
from PMA sized nylon warp in Du Pont Ex-
perimental Weaving Laboratory.
(4) Optimum concentrations of PMA
and the various plasticizers had to be
determined, and application tempera-
tures worked out for the different types
of fabrics (satins, twills, taffetas, etc.)
to be sized.
The basic reactions involved in mak-
ing methacrylic acid monomer are
straightforward:
(CHjJjCO + HCN &gt; (CH,).C(OH)CN
(acetone) (acetone cyanohydrin)
(CH.),C(OH)CN +
HrO, HiSCh
■&gt; HiC-C(CHi)COOH
(methacrylic acid monomer)
But several technical difficulties in the
manufacture of the polymer had to be
overcome:
(1) The distillation of the monomer
has to be controlled carefully to keep
it from polymerizing in the still head.
(2) The monomer must be obtained
free of any color-forming impurities that
might cause permanent discoloration of
the fabric by the final polymer solution.
(3) Polymerization of the monomer
must be carefully regulated to get re-
producible results and constant molec-
ular weight. This is important because
the molecular weight of the PMA de-
termines the viscosity of the size.
(4) Drying the polymer presented
unusual difficulties. A special study was
made to find an economical drying proc-
ess that would give a uniform, finely
divided product adapted to rapid solu-
tion.
Credit for the development of PMA
textile sizing, is shared by Du Pont
men with many types of training—
chemists, physicists, chemical engineers
and textile experts, as well as the tech-
nical service men who worked in close
cooperation with leading textile manu-
facturers during commercial trials.
Questions College Men ask
about working with Du Pont

J. M. Griffing, Ph.D. (Organic), Columbia '45, and A. Descheemaeker, B.S. in Chemical Engineering,
Lehigh '41, inspect PMA size solution and check nylon warp at head end of a slasher. In slasher sizing,
entire warp is coated rather than a single thread.

PROBLEM—You are designing an electric clock for auto-
mobiles. The clock itself is completed. To set the clock,
the spindle which turns the hands must be pushed in against
a spring pressure and then turned—and, of course, when
the clock is installed, this spindle is back under the dash-
board. You want to provide a means for pushing and
turning the spindle from a point that is easy to get at.
How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—Use an S.S.White flexible shaft.
The illustrations show how one manufacturer does It. Re-
gardless of where the clock is mounted, the flexible shaft,
available in any length, makes it possible to put the hand-
set knob in the most convenient spots.

ENGINEERING EDUCATION
(Continued from page 15)
Courses in personnel management and factory manage-
ment require a professor who has worked with men (in the
factory) for years, knows their problems and has the ability
to cope with them. Problems in management are complex in
our present world and many times have led to national chaos.
Therefore, it is quite impractical to cast such a responsibility
on the shoulders of a student who, perhaps, received an "A"
in the course the previous semester and assert that he is ade-
quately schooled in the subject to teach it well. We might
compare this situation to one in which a young interne is lec-
turing to a group of students on the art of plastic surgery.
Certainly this would be considered highly detrimental to the
medical profession. Since the engineer must have direct con-
tact with the men in the factory, it is also detrimental to the
engineering profession.
The revision of the engineering curricula is an important
phase in all future attempts to improve our educational sys-
tem. Since the revision of the college and high school cur-
ricula are interdependent, any proposed drastic changes have
received considerable opposition. Since the subject of "Cur-
ricula Revision" covers more than the field of engineering ed-
ucation, it might be best to dismiss the subject by saying that
it is highly regrettable to see the majority of books written on
curricula revision, which have required years of research,
adorning our public libraries.
During the war the armed forces managed to train mil-
lions of men in certain skilled trades and in some highly theo-
retical subjects. Some of the courses required only a brief
period of training while others involved months of concen-
trated theoretical study with certain practical applications.
The individuals in charge of military education discovered
that training programs were speeded up considerably through
the use of visual aids. Not only were the training periods ac-
celerated, but the students completing the courses left with a
better and more complete knowledge of the subjects studied.
Since the nation's universities are now interested in the
education of the masses, it is only fitting and proper that some
of the more efficient methods be employed. Visual aids are
many times considered as expensive gadgetry which never
pays off. However, many times our visual aids only include
the use of colored chalk or a yard-stick and a piece of string
with which to draw a circle. By the use of these simple ob-
jects, blackboard diagrams may be made distinct, as well as
sufficiently large to be viewed by all the members of a class
without any appreciable eyestrain. Why these items have
never been supplied by many of our universities is a sixty-
four dollar question.
Large scale models also aid the professor in describing a
piece of machinery or a particular engineering phenomena. It
is practically impossible to expect anyone to draw extremely
complicated diagrams on a blackboard. However, it is a rela-
tively simple task for the professor to bring a large scale
model to class and carry on the discussion with the aid of the
model. The professor who enters a lecture hall, in which are
seated two-hundred or three-hundred enthusiastic engineering
students, and begins to lecture on basic meter movements with
the aid of an actual meter is bound to meet with a certain
amount of opposition from his audience. However, if the

meter movements were sufficiently large
so that it could be seen by all the stud-
dents, the class would be much more at-
tentive. The use of models, coupled with
the issuance of supplementary diagrams
and data to the student body, has
proved successful and has paid divi-
dends to the students. These dividends,
although intangible to the professors,
are tangible to the young graduate en-
gineer in the way of additional mone-
tary compensation.
Considerable amount of descriptive
textbook material could be supple-
mented by slides and motion pictures.
This system has proved most success-
ful where assembly, productive or
manufacturing techniques and methods
are to be studied. Most present-day
textbooks cover many pages and in
some instances volumes in describing
presses, rolling mills, and production
methods; however, an actual movie of
the process concerned would certainly
be more impressive.
Laboratory Work
Laboratory periods were originally
intended to give the students an oppor-
tunity to come in contact with the
(Continued from page 30)
equipment that he is studying in theory
classes. This laboratory training is very
important since it gives the student an
opportunity to become familiar with
equipment similar to what he may some
day use. It would then seem logical to
believe that men with practical experi-
ence would act as laboratory instruc-
tors. This, however, is not the case.
Most laboratories are staffed with
young inexperienced instructors. Their
knowledge consists purely of textbook
knowledge or some bits of information
received from a professor of wide ex-
perience. Once the instructor is asked
a question that is not in the textbook,
he is at a loss for words. This situation
leaves the student debating the actual
value of laboratory work.
Within recent years most laboratory
courses have degenerated to the point
where the ability to pass the course is
directly proportional to the number of
old laboratory reports the student pos-
sesses. For years, laboratory work has
remained the same in many courses
and in some instances the textbook
references given are no longer used.
Since most laboratory reports require
hours of work it would seem logical to
believe that at least some benefit would
be derived from them. However, in
many instances, the data taken is not
only in error but is so faulty that even
the well-known fudge factor fails. Lab-
oratory reports are often called for and
seldom are given any great attention.
When two students turn in laboratory
reports which are definitely known to
be incorrect and these same reports are
returned with a mark of acceptance,
something is wrong. At times it seems
that the grade is proportional to the
number of sheets of paper in the re-
port. In some universities, lengthy ex-
planations are required giving a step
by step procedure. This type of report
even loses its value as an aid to better
penmanship. The aforementioned lab-
oratory characteristics have grown to
the point where the average labora-
tory period is a farce.
Grading Systems
It has often been said that a profes-
sor's teaching ability is reflected in the
grades which his students achieve. If
this is actually true then it becomes im-

perative that some professors change
their teaching methods or examina-
tions. Since our present educational
system places so much importance on
better grades it might be well to con-
sider the actual meaning of the grading
system. To all intents and purposes the
letter grade received on an examina-
tion is merely an indication of an indi-
vidual's knowledge of a specific subject
at a certain time and under a set of ex-
tremely artificial circumstances. This
fact is quite evident when considering
the personal records of many students
who are forced to leave the university
because of their failure to maintain
supposedly respectable grades. Many
of these students, it has been found,
are capable of working the most diffi-
cult problems if not under tension.
Thus it becomes a rather ridiculous
predicament when a student is denied a
college education because of his inabil-
ity to write a decent examination.
Many of the examinations given by
the engineering colleges of the nation's
universities have completely lost their
significance. The purpose of an exam-
ination or quiz is to give the professor
r&gt;\&lt;
(Continued from page 32)
an opportunity to determine the amount
of information his students are absorb-
ing. In our present educational system
examinations merely serve as a tool for
the professor to determine how he shall
distribute the grades. At times, the
same examinations are given for sev-
eral semesters. The individual who has
a copy of the examination from the
previous semester has little difficulty
in solving the problems. Some profes-
sors maintain an exam file from which
they choose questions for the semes-
ter's examination. This system al-
though appearing sound has its falla-
cies. Many fraternities maintain exam
files and these files contain practically
the same-questions that appear in the
professor's file. Since most fraternities
have maintained these files for many
years, they are complete. When all the
students are working under the same
conditions, examinations, if adminis-
tered properly, have some value. How-
ever, once certain members of the class
have advance knowledge of the exam,
their value decreases. Our present ex-
amination system has extended to the
point where many students work for
grades and not an education. This con-
dition although refuted by some edu-
cators, nevertheless, does exist. A day
spent conversing with a group of stu-
dents will very easily substantiate any
doubt.
It is almost impossible for a profes-
sor to grade a group of examination
papers with any amount of fairness.
Some professors maintain that after a
semester's grading the students' injus-
tices are averaged. Even if this were
true it is not sufficient reason for con-
doning the marking system. The ma-
jority of these injustices are for mak-
ing minor mistakes. It is true that a
misplaced decimal point on a construc-
tion bid may ruin an organization finan-
cially, or that a simple miscalculation
may cause the failure of a bridge; but
when men are working on such proj-
ects they are not limited to a fifty min-
ute examination period. The whole
question of minor errors may be
summed up by saying that many a pro-
fessor has added 2-f2 to equal 5 and if
he requires a high degree of accuracy
from his students he himself should
be able to maintain that high standard.

black diamonds
One of the most important com-

today is in diamond core drilling. In
this operation diamond drill bits are
used to obtain samples of sub-surface
formations preparatory to starting con-
struction of bridges, dams, tunnels,
and other similar engineering struc-
tures.
Before construction is started on any
project which will have its foundations
deep in the earth's crust, preliminary
investigations must be made to select

the preliminary surveys have been
made, geologists are called in to make
a more thorough reconnaissance ot the
site and determine the exact conforma-
tion of the sub-surface formations in
the vicinity.

Carbonado diamonds in the rough
It is here that diamond drilling plays
such an important role. One of the
main methods used by the geologists
in evaluating the site selected in the
preliminary survey is observation of
rock cores obtained in diamond drilling
operations.
The core-type bit used in this pro-
cess is made by setting the diamonds in
one end of a hollow steel cylinder. The
diamonds are set so that only one-
fourth to one-tenth of the stone pro-
jects beyond the steel surface of the
bit. In some types of drills a row of
diamonds is also set around the out-
side of the bit near the bottom edge
of the cylinder. These side-cutting
edges insure a uniform diameter drill
hole and provide space for the bit cut-
tings to escape.
In the drilling procedure the dia-
mond bit is coupled to the drilling ma-
chine through a hollow drill rod. As
the drilling operation proceeds, water
is pumped through the drill rods to re-
move the cuttings from the hole. The

Two types of diamonds are being
used in commercial drilling service at
the present time. Borts are chips ob-
tained in cutting gem diamonds and
gem-type diamonds which are unsal-
able due to poor color characteristics.
The other type is the carbonado or
black diamond. The carbonado is com-
posed entirely of small interlocking
diamond crystals and has no straight
cleavage planes. This gives the carbon-
ado a much greater toughness than the
clear gem and makes the stone par-
ticularly valuable for use in rock drill-
ing bits.
One disadvantage of diamond drill-
ing is the cost of the bits. The prices
of the stones vary with the size and,
currently, good quality industrial dia-
monds are valued at approximately
$50 per carat, or $7700 per ounce. A
complete bit is thus worth approxi-
mately $10,000. However, the life of
the diamond bit greatly exceeds that
of any other type of rock drilling bit.
This makes the diamond bit commer-
cially practicable in engineering work.
The utilization of diamond drill bits
has increased rapidly in the past two
decades, and as new techniques are de-
veloped diamond core samples will play
an increasing role in determining the
location and construction of all types
of engineering structures requiring a
firm foundation.

NEW NON-STOP PROCESS
PRODOCES G-E PHENOL
If you were to visit the Chemical Depart-
ment of the General Electric Company
at Piitsfield, Mass., you could watch
something new in the production of
phenol. It's a continuous operation
process developed by G-E chemists and
engineers. With the completion of this

company in the United States to start
with the production of chemicals... con-
vert them into resin . . . then molding
powder or varnish . . . and finally fabri-
cate them into a long list of finished

Phenolic compounds are among the
most useful molding powders. Since
phenol is so important in the fast-grow-
ing plastics industry, its processing
should be of interest to every voting
chemist and student of chemistry.
How is phenol made? The basic in-
gredients used at Piitsfield are benzol,
chlorine, and caustic soda.

Distillation building with fractionating towers.
Caustic effluent from electrolytic cells is
evaporated to 20 per cent and (lie salt
crystals separated. Caustic is diluted to
10 per cent tor hydrolyzing the mono-
(hlorbenzol. Chlorine leaving the cells
at 180 F. is cooled to 55. The gas is



compressed to 20 lb. and goes to
the chlorinator. Here it meets
with benzol and monochlorbenzol
is formed. Gases leave from the
top of the chlorinator. The hydro-
chloric acid is recovered to be used
later in neutralizing sodium
phenolate to release phenol. The liquid
leaving the chlorinator is composed
of unreacted benzol, monochlorbenzol,
and dichlorbenzols. It is neutralized and
the components are separated.
The monochlorbenzol, caustic, and
diphenyl ether are then mixed and the
mixture is compressed to 4,000 lb. per
sq. in. The temperature is raised to

late. diphenyl ether, or high boiling
residues. The mixture is cooled and the
pressure reduced. In a decanter the

infra-red spectrometer
One of the latest scientific aids in ex-
ploring the molecular structures of
chemical compounds is the infra-red ab-
sorption spectrometer. In principle, the
operation of an infra-red spectrometer
is similar to that of a standard optical
spectrometer. Infra-red radiations, em-
anating from a red hot rod, are passed
through a thin layer of the material
under observation. Any given material
will pass certain wavelengths of the
infra-red spectrum and ahsorb others,
depending on its own peculiar molecular
structure.
any body is determined by its size, shape
and structure. With particles of molecu-
lar size the range of frequencies of
vibration fall within the infra-red range
of the electro-magnetic spectrum—that
is the wave lengths range from two to
twenty-five microns. As a result every
type of molecule absorbs infra-red
"light" in a characteristic way. As the
varying wavelengths affect the sensitive
thermocouple, the recorder traces a
unique "profile" graph for each type of
molecule. This instrument is even sensi-
tive enough to detect individual radicals
and to distinguish between isomers

The wavelengths which are not ab-
sorbed are then passed through a prism
of rock salt, lithium fluoride or potas-
sium bromide, depending on the partic-
ular wavelength being studied. These
optically perfect prisms are cut from
single salt crystals and serve to spread
the wavelengths of the infra-red beam.
To analyze these spectra, a very sensi-
tive thermocouple is used. Impulses
from this thermocouple are transmitted
to a very sensitive galvanometer re-
corder which has a full scale sensitivity
of one micro volt. The w-hole apparatus
is mounted in a vibration-proof suspen-
sion which insures that the recording
pen will not be affected by any ordinary
shocks or vibrations.
Physicists have long known that the
characteristic frequency of vibration of
which are molecules with different ar-
rangements of the same atoms.
One of the most important applica-
tions of the infra-red spectrometer at
present is the quick identification of
unknown compounds. In plastics, for
instance, the identity of the plasticizer
and the quantity present can be deter-
mined in about forty minutes by com-
paring the unknown profile with those
of known substances determined pre-
viously. A chemical analysis of the ma-
terial for identification alone would be
next to impossible.
Future applications of the instrument
may include installation of infra-red de-
vices on production lines to assist in
inspection of materials and maintain
quality control. „ R ,,
recording mass
spectrometer
Under the impetus of the war, re-
search into the existence and importance
of isotopes was greatly accelerated. As
a result, the development of new or im-
proved recording machinery became an
item of prime importance. The General
Electric Company recently announced
the development of a new- recording
mass spectrometer. The instrument is
used in the determination of the compo-
sition of material in the gaseous form.
This spectrometer is adaptable to a wide
range of chemical work and is especially
useful in measuring the abundance of
isotopes.
The use of this instrument cuts the
time required for hydrocarbon analysis
of synthetic rubber, gasoline, and other
petroleum products to one-tenth the
time required in the older methods of
analysis.
The instrument is capable of analyz-
ing any compound that can be intro-
duced into an ionization chamber as a
gas or vapor.
Ease of maintenance and inspection
are the main items featured in the pres-
ent models of the mass spectrometer.

packaged die caster
Completely self-contained, an air-
operated die casting machine fills the
need of many firms who require inter-
mittent production die-casting work but
who do not have the facilities or need
for establishing a regular die-casting
division. This machine, requiring only
the simplest possible installation, meas-
ures 22 inches by 72 inches, and is 40
inches high.
No special maintenance crew is re-
quired to adjust and maintain the die
caster. Likewise, no specially trained
die-casting technician need be hired to
operate it. The average shop employee
can handle production runs on this
"goose-neck" type machine, the maxi-
mum casting capacity of which is one
and one-half pounds, with a possible
maximum casting rate of 720 shots per
hour.
Simple operation throughout is an
outstanding characteristic of the ma-
chine. It is equipped with a loose-type
nozzle, instantly removable. A remov-
able bar facilitates die loading. All work-
ing parts are readily accessible for in-
spection, adjustment, or maintenance.
Zerk fittings are conveniently located so

spect to corrosion and lubrication. A
new research tool, the electron diffrac-
tion instrument, aids in the analysis of
surfaces and thin films. Specimens
ranging from .1 to 4 inches in diameter
are photographed by the instrument
after a beam of electrons has been di-
rected on the specimen. The picture of
the resulting diffraction pattern indi-
cates the composition, orientation, and
size of crystals present. With this data
conclusions can be drawn about many
physical properties, such as corrosion
resistance, of the specimens. L.W.

hot air generator
A heated air generator, producing
homogeneous hot air of controllable vel-
ocity, temperature, quantity, and pres-
sure found its first application in speed-
ing up the common shipyard operation
of drying ships' motors and engine-
room machinery which has either been
flooded or covered with moisture
through condensation.
However, additional applications for
the new generator will be found where-
ever the problem of cleaning and drying
machinery exists. Some uses for the hot
air generator include various manufac-
turing processes, such as pre-heating,
melting, annealing, dehydrating, aerat-
ing, sterilizing, hardening, enameling,
cooling (by shutting off the heat and
using it as a blower), tempering, curing,
refining, and plating.
A further use around motors is in
connection with cleaning and painting.
Through usage, main propulsion ma-
chinery and auxiliary motors acquire a
coating of grease mixed with carbon
dust. After a time this coating becomes
quite thick and is difficult to remove. By
applying hot air at about 200 degrees
Fahrenheit to the part, the grease melts
readily and the area can be washed rap-
idly with carbon tetrachloride which
evaporates quickly. This operation is
now accomplished much faster and
cheaper with the controlled hot air
generator. H.K.
soldering tool
Operating on the resistance heating
principle, a redesigned soldering tool
heats 20 per cent faster than ordinary
tools, has a thumb switch for close heat
control, is light-weight, compact, port-
able, and can be used for long periods of
time without overheating.
Built to industrial standards, the com-
plete unit includes a transformer or
power unit and a soldering tool that
operates like a pair of pliers. Holding
the work with the plier tool completes
the transformer secondary circuit and
causes the work to heat instantly. Heat
is produced between the electrodes of
the soldering tool only, thus concentrat-
ing it on the exact spot needed. There is
no danger of melting nearby joints or
burning other parts. R.D.

To be patentable, a technical contribu-
tion must be both new and useful. At
Standard Oil (Indiana) there exists a
stimulating atmosphere in which our tech-
nical men continuously contribute to
progress with new, useful inventions.
The work of all our research men is re-
viewed by trained patent advisors. When
a researcher conceives a new solution to a
problem, he is encouraged to submit it in
the form of a disclosure. A careful search
is made on his behalf by Standard Oil
library research experts and patent attor-
neys. Their findings and the results of
laboratory tests go with the disclosure to
an application committee. On the aver-
age, one patent application is filed for
every seven disclosures submitted.
This procedure gets results for Stand-
ard Oil and Standard men. We believe it
compares most favorably with the patent
practices of other industries—and few in-
deed can match Standard's record for
technological progress.

The majority of our Nation's univer-
sities do not offer a formal course in-
doctrinating the young engineer in the
requirements and expectations of his
profession. Many students reach their
senior year without any concrete ideas
as to what industry expects of them. The
types of positions available, methods
employed in the selection of qualified
engineers, qualifications and require-
ments for various positions, and the
proper methods of seeking employment
are topics seldom considered by many
engineering students. In an effort to
determine what manufacturers and
service industries require of young en-
gineers, the author has interviewed su-
pervisors of technical personnel at Bry-
ant Detwiler and Co., The Detroit
Edison Co., Ford Motor Co.. and Gen-
eral Motors Corporation. The informa-
tion is presented as received and has not
been editorialized in any manner.
Bryant Detwiler &amp; Co.
Bryant Detwiler &amp; Company is an or-
ganization of general contractors.
Among their accomplishments are the
erection of the Water Board Building
in Detroit; the Detroit Institute of Arts;
the Naval Ordnance Plant; and the
Defense Plant at Willow Run.
Herbert E. Schlesinger, registered
professional engineer and project man-
ager for Bryant Detwiler &amp; Co. has ex-
pressed the following opinions concern-
ing the civil engineer in the field of gen-
eral construction. Mr. Schlesinger grad-
uated from the University of Michigan
in 1924 and began his career as a layout
engineer on the Angell Hall project.
Students interested in working in the
field of general contracting should at-
tempt to broaden their knowledge of all
engineering fields. The construction en-
gineer is not a specialist, but is con-
cerned with producing structures which
involve diversified engineering prin-
ciple. The design of a modern produc-
tion plant hospital or mercantile estab-
lishment requires the service of special-
ists in many fields. Frequently these
fields include soil mechanics, indeter-
minant structures, illumination, sanita-
tion, air-conditioning, material han-
■&lt;
Taking the guesswork out of manufac-
turing is one of the Engineer's jobs

Gerard H. Giczewski
dling, sound control and isolation, com-
munication, and others. The construc-
tion engineer should have sufficient en-
gineering knowledge to enable him to
consult with such specialists intelligent-
ly and to carry out properly their recom-
mendations and instructions on the job.
It is essential that the construction en-
gineer know something about the ma-
terials with which he works. A general
knowledge of the limits, capabilities,
characteristics, and methods employed
in the manufacture of the materials of
construction is essential. In addition the
young graduate should have some idea
about the operation of a steel mill, lum-
ber yard and mill, brick and tile plant,
and cement plant. Some emphasis
should be placed on the processes in-
volved, and the cycle through which raw
materials progress before the finished
product is in the hands of construction
personnel. On the surface it appears
that this information is more or less
immaterial and unconsequential. How-
ever, since the construction engineer in
many instances deals directly with the
supplier or producer it becomes neces-
sary for him to speak the language of
the producer. If the construction engi-
neer knows and realizes the problems
encountered in the manufacture or pro-
duction of the materials and assemblies
of construction he will know what per-
formance can be expected and insisted
upon, but will not make unreasonable
demands and the result is a harmonious
operation.
The majority of graduates entering
the field of construction engineering
begin as layout men in the field. Men
having ability and demonstrating the
required aptitude and ambition, are
given more responsible positions as their
work progresses. The next step is that
of crew chief, followed by foreman or
assistant superintendent and then super-
intendent. After some field experience
the graduate may continue in the estima-
ting department. The estimating depart-
ment is very important part of a build-
ing organization. Since much construc-
tion business is obtained through com-
petitive bids, which entail financial risk,
considerable responsibility rests on the
estimating engineer.
The young engineer should have a
general knowledge of law as it affects
the contractor. This phase is primarily
important since ninety per cent of all
legal difficulties encountered are over
improperly worded, and misinterpreted
specifications and contracts. Since the
engineer is responsible for enforcing
the specifications set down in the con-
tract it is to his own advantage to under-
stand them. A clear understanding of
building codes, lien laws, and labor reg-
ulations is also necessary. A general
knowledge of cost keeping, time study,
and general accounting practice is desir-
able.
The young engineer should familiar-
ize himself with construction equip-
ment such as earth movers, cranes,
tractors, conveyors, power saws, and
hoists. Knowing the characteristics and
capacities of construction equipment
and the methods employed for most
efficient operation will help the young
engineer progress to greater responsi-
bly.
Some of the aforementioned informa-
tion will not be presented in formal
courses. However, if the young engineer
is well-grounded in the basic engineer-
ing subjects, the other information is
available to him if he takes the respon-
sibility to keep up with the publications,
periodicals, and journals relating to
engineering and the construction indus-
try. It is only when an engineer can
coordinate all of the phases of a con-
struction job that he becomes a credit to

Would you design a mechanism that
is subject to accelerations of 2100 G?
Would you still consider it if this ac-
celeration occurred 1000 times per min-
ute? If so, what type of construction
would you use? According to the results
of a ROTC students' Ordnance Ma-
teriel Specialty Project, the bolt of a
caliber .50 aircraft machine gun is such
a mechanism. This course is a part of
the new Ordnance ROTC program
where the student's technical field is co-
ordinated with military and industrial
problems. The project is a recognition
of the importance of the Ordnance-
industry-research team concept to our
future reserve officers.
fn the last war our armies successfully
fought a global war with strategical in-
feriority in numbers of troops. It in no
way detracts from the courage, organi-
zation, or training of our combat forces
to state that this was possible because
of the superior quality, quantity, mobil-
ity, and reliability of our armament.

over any terrain. The bazooka and its
shaped-charge ammunition gave the in-
fantryman the ability to punch through
armor. The V. T. proximity fuse al-
lowed our artillery to detonate ammuni-
tion at its most effective distance from
the target. The self-propelled 155 mm.
gun motor carriage contributed more
than any other one weapon to the smash-
ing of the German West Wall defense.
The 120 mm. anti-aircraft followed its
target across the sky with an electronic
brain and threw flak to new high alti-
tudes. The tank gunner could fire ac-
curately while his tank bounced over
rough terrain because of the gyroscopic
control of his weapon.
These and 1,400 other new items
placed in the hand of our fighting men
brought an easier, quicker, cheaper vic-
tory. The rapidity of this development
is indicated by the fact that during
World War II more than 75% of the
basic equipment of our fighting troops
was either replaced completely or rad-
ically improved.
In this same period industry pro-
duced a quantity of ordnance materiel
whose sheer weight was 25 times that
produced in World War I. The produc-
tion of approximately 38,000,000 tons
is roughly equivalent to 15 years of pro-
duction of the automotive industry at its
peak rate. This tonnage was spread over
the 1830 major items and 600,000 com-
ponents which constitute ordnance ma-
teriel. Many of these items and com-
ponents were non-commercial in nature.
Despite the increased production, the
greater complexity of the items, and the
continuing development to meet chang-
ing tactical situations, the cost was only
ten times the cost of ordnance produc-
tion in World War I.
Neither the development nor the pro-
duction was the consequence of wishful
thinking. It was the result of advanced
planning and full coordination between
science, industry, and the military per-
sonnel charged with the supply and
maintenance of our armament. This is
the concept of the ordnance-industry
research team.

requirements and general characteristics
of the weapon were determined. The
several interested services and combat
arms functioning with the other mem-
bers of the Ordnance Technical Com-
mittee determined characteristics and
requirements. But, because of the lack
of funds the project was shelved shortly
afterward.
Further development was reinitiated
in 1940. A development contract was
placed with a manufacturer who nor-
mally produces earth-moving equip-
ment. Ordnance engineers, experienced
in gun carriage design and military re-
quirements, brought the tentative lay-
outs to the contractor and were assigned
to work with his engineers. A wooden
mockup of the completed design was
approved by Ordnance and the Artillery.
The pilot carriage was then manufac-
tured by the contractor and sent to Aber-
deen Proving Ground where technical
tests were conducted. The Field Artil-
lery Board then conducted the service
tests. After minor modification, produc-
tion was initiated and the weapon was
utilized in both the European and Pa-
cific theaters.
The overall problem cannot be esti-
mated merely by multiplying this 240
mm. Howitzer development by the num-
ber of new items introduced. Many of
them required basic research. Produc-
tion not only involved the determination
of a competent contractor for the com-
plete unit but also the location of the
raw materials, power, labor, plants,
tooling, and transportation.
Since its establishment 132 years ago

of fighting equipment for the American
Armies, the Ordnance Department has
been vitally interested in research, engi-
neering, production, and industrial man-
agement. Priod to World War I, the
ordnance manufacturing arsenals were
the chief contact with industry. As cen-
ters of development and of limited man-
ufacture of munitions, these installa-
tions kept in close touch with industrial
development and were responsible for
retaining the manufacturing "know-
how" of non-commercial items.
Compared to World War II, produc-
tion in World War I was insignificant,
yet the problems of World War I re-
sulted in revisions in organization. Ord-
nance District Offices were established
in the key centers of production. These
offices had three main functions pertin-
ent to this discussion. During the peace
years they surveyed plant capacities and
capabilities in their areas, supervised
gage laboratories located in several of
the large universities, and served as a
nucleus for decentralization of procure-
ment.
But basic research, the hat out of
which applied science draws the rabbits
to produce more effective equipment,
must continue to be coordinated with
our future military needs. Applied sci-
ence and industry must be prepared to
design and produce future weapons as
required by changing tactics. Forward
progress necessitates that America's
ordnance leaders of tomorrow under-
stand the full significance of the ord-
nance-industry-research team.
The ROTC corollary to this con-
cept is the Ordnance Material Specialty
Project given during the student's
fourth year. By this time he has been
given a general survey of the field of
ordnance. Third year courses have cov-
ered the construction, functioning, and
utilization of representative items as
well as the organization necessary to
effect their supply and maintenance. He
has attended the summer camp at Aber-
deen Proving Ground where he has
had additional practical work with rep-
resentative items of the different fields
of ordnance. He has also covered the
majority of subjects common to the sev-
eral branches of the Army which train
him for command of an organization in
the field. Also, his university scholastic
achievement has given him tools with
which to work.
The Ordnance Materiel Specialty
Project is a special study of a problem
within one of the several general fields
of ordnance in which the student is es-
pecially interested. Completion of the
project is accomplished under the joint
direction of a university faculty mem-
ber who is a specialist in the general field
of the project and of the Ordnance As-
sistant Professor of Military Science
and Tactics. Ordnance and commercial

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
by
KARL E. HENION II, '49E
Author's note:
The material in this and succeeding
articles like it claims no originality; on
the contrary, the literature of physics
offers an unlimited source for such in-
formation. To the student of physics it
is, perhaps, an unnecessary review of
his A B C's. The real function of
these articles, however, is to present
to the engineering student several im-
portant concepts and outstanding ex-
periments in modern physics developed
by the great minds in that field to whom
the engineering profession, having ex-
alted these concepts into marvelous feats
of engineering, are so much indebted.
Experimental Method
(1550-1800)
A logical breakdown of the evolution
of scientific thought in the field of
physics is one in which the history of the
science is divided into essentially three
periods, the first period beginning with
the middle of the 16th century.
Prior to this time experimental
science was practically non-existent.
Concepts as to what held the world to-
gether were greatly influenced by reli-
gious speculation and the interpretation
of the laws of the universe was left to
the fancy of the theologians of the day.
However, with the dawn of the Renais-
sance in England and on the continent
of Europe, in the minds of some men
was planted the scientific spirit of ex-
perimentation as we know it today. This
marked the real beginning of modern
science and ushered in a new era of
technical and scientific achievement
which ever since has dominated and in-
fluenced the course of human events.
The interval between the 15th century
and the start of the 19th century, known
as the first period, saw the firm estab-
lishment of the experimental method as
manifested by the achievements of the
giants in physical science during this
time. We are indebted to Galileo (1564-
1642), the grandsire of physics, for
fathering the first notable experiments
of this important era of the birth of
experimental science which was to give
rise to the achievements of Huygens.
Bovle, Gilbert, and the monumental

Karl E. Henion II
work of Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727).
By 1860 the seeds of experimental
science, nurtured in the minds of a few
men several centuries previously, had
been thoroughly and widely cultivated
in others and were bearing fruit. For
the turn of the century found rival the-
ories as to the nature of light, electricity,
and heat. The fact that men were con-
sidering whether light was corpuscular
or wave-like, and whether heat could be
explained by the kinetic theory or the
caloric theory was ample evidence that
experiment and observation had at long
last replaced the fallacy of religious
speculation centuries ago. This brings
us to the 19th century and the second
period, which extends from 1800 to
1888.
Age of Classical Physics
(1800-1888)
The latter part of the 19th century
was to find many leaders of physical
science quite smug and content that all
the great discoveries in physics had been
made and that future work in physics
would deal with cleaning up minor de-
tails. This attitude is understandable
by us and was, indeed, quite justified in
those days in light of the spectacular
advances and discoveries made in phys-
ics during this period.
The 1800's saw: the firm establish-
ment of the kinetic theory of heat and
the evolution of the kinetic theory of
gases, whose experimental validification
began with the experiments of Rum-
ford and Joule: the declaration of the
second law of thermodynamics ; the gen-
eral law of the conservation of energy,
due to the combined work of Mayer,
Joule, and Helmholtz : the apparent "tri-
umph" of the wave theory of light over
the corpuscular theory; and the discov-
ery, and resulting theories, of the whole
sphere of electromagnetic phenomena.
This period of physics has been called
the age of classical physics.
The principal theme of the 19th cen-
tury of physics was the utter belief that
science could be interpreted solely in
mechanical terms. The prevalence of
this mechanical philosophy in scientific
circles was due to many influences. The
mechanics of Newton had been applied
successfully to fluids and elastic solids
during the first part of the 19th century,
and in the second half there appeared
the substantiated notion that sound
could be explained in terms of elastic
vibrations—a mechanical process. It is
important to note at this point that along
with their belief in the mechanical phil-
osophy, the physicists of the day held
tenaciously to the conviction that a qual-
itative theory was not worth its weight
in words unless the theory was backed
up by quantitative agreement in the
laboratory.
It is no small wonder then that even
more emphasis was placed on the me-
chanical interpretation of physical phe-
nomena when the proposed mechanical
theories of the conservation of energy
and the kinetic theory of gases were
validated by conclusive experiments in
the laboratory. Experimenters actually
measured specific heats, gas pressures,
and molecular speeds; they showed the
connection between heat and mechanical
energy. These results agreed with the
predictions of the theories. With this
and other evidence before them it be-
came practically impossible for many
scientists of the day to believe that all
physical phenomena could not be ulti-
mately interpreted by the laws of
mechanics.

aicTfor county structures
It is of no particular interest to the
average automobile owner whether he
is driving over a county or state high-
way. As long as the roadway is reason-
ably comfortable and safe the ordinary-
driver is content. But even though a
large bulk of traffic travels over the
main state highways, the intricate net-
work of county roads that feed the
main highways has by far a larger
number of miles.
The federal government has realized
the increasing importance of county
roads in the overall motor transporta-
tion picture and has set aside $150,000,-
000 for a three year period for a system
of federal aid for secondary roads. Cal-
ifornia, for example, received $15,000.-
000 which required matching.
At first it seemed that the matching
stipulation would make it virtually im-
possible for many of the poorer counties
to derive benefits from the federal pro-
gram. In the case of California, the state
stepped in with a bill appropriating
$12,000,000 for the purpose of aiding
the counties in meeting the matching
• requirements of the federal aid pro-
gram. This state recognition of federal
aid seemed to emphasize the importance
of the secondary road svstems.

Original single-track span
The outstanding weakness of the
county road system in California is the
inadequacy of present bridges. Because
of this many of the counties have chosen
to use the federal aid on improvement
and on new construction of bridge fa-
cilities. The first step in the bridge build-
ing program is a preliminary field
review of the proposed site. At these
reviews the county and state engineers
discuss important details such as road-
way width, sidewalks, waterway re-
quirements, span lengths, foundations
and types of design.

Courtety Better tioads
Span widened for 24-ft roadway
The county then submits a general
plan to the Public Roads Administration
through the state. Following approval
of the general plan the county prepares
detailed plans of the structure. Though
uniform standards are not required by
the state, most counties prefer to follow
those standards set up by the state. The
counties have been encouraged to carry
on as much of the construction as pos-
sible in order to acquaint themselves
with the federal projects.
With federal, state, and local recog-
nition of the importance of improving
secondary highway systems, the present
day motorist can happily look forward
to smoother future. L.W.
calculating machines
During World War II. the Army and
Navy—particularly the Army Ordnance
Research and Development Service—
encouraged development of super-
machines for calculating ballistics tables
and solving engineering problems in the
design of ships, radar equipment, and
atomic energy facilities. To date, the
development of calculating machines has
depended almost entirely upon the mil-
itary services and certain civilian
government agencies.
The automatic electronic computer is
the result of years of evolution in the
field of calculating machines. At present
the field is developing so rapidly that a
machine may become obsolete between
the time it is designed and the date of
its completion.
In the fall of 1945 the first electronic
computing machine began operation. At
that moment electromechanical and
relay calculators became outmoded.
Henceforth, high-speed calculating ma-
chines will be designed to operate elec-
tronically.
The original electronic machine, the
electronic numerical integrator and cal-
culator (EN I AC), was built for the
Ballistic Research Laboratory by the
Moore School of Electrical Engineering
of the University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia, Pa.
The internal mechanism of the
ENIAC is entirely electronic, which ac-
counts for its enormous operating speed.
The relay-type counter represented a
marked advance in speed over the re-
volving wheel counters used in standard
desk calculators and punch-card equip-
ment. The ENIAC can calculate the
trajectory of a shell in considerably less
time than the shell takes to reach its
target.
As the ENIAC deals with 10-digit
numbers, each unit must contain ten
electronic rings or counters plus a posi-
tive or negative sign indicator. The digit
pulses for a multidigit number are trans-
mitted at the same time, so that each
counter has its own inlet and outlet wire.
All accumulator units are equipped with
five inlet and two outlet trunk lines, each
containing 11 wires for the 10 digits and
sign. The multiple outlets provide com-
plete flexibility in connecting the various
units with each other.
The ENIAC occupies a room 30 x 50
feet and weighs 30 tons. It contains
nearly 18,000 vacuum tubes. Several
times a day check problems are run
through the machine to determine that
all tubes are functioning properly.
Burned-out tubes usually can be located
and replaced in 15 minutes. Under nor-
mal operating conditions, one tube must
be replaced about every second day.
Perhaps the most ambitious program
planned for new calculating machines
is that under way at the Bureau of
Standards. The Bureau has been asked
to design and construct two electronic
digital machines (universal automatic

one for the Bureau of the Census and
one for the Office of Naval Research.
In addition the Bureau is engaged in an
extensive research project financed by
the Army Ordnance Department for
fundamental studies of electronic com-
ponents to he used in fire control and
flight simulation devices.
Performance specifications drawn up
for the Bureau's machines call for
speeds of computation substantially
greater than that of ENIAC. Addition
of two 10-digit numbers should take
only 1/10.000 second; multiplication,
1/500 second ; transfer from memory to
computing unit, 1/10,000 second. The
internal memory capacity must store at
least 5,000 10-digit numbers, of a total
of 50,000,000 digits. The input-output
mechanism will be high speed, the input
of a 10-digit number requiring 1/1500
second and printing of results done at
the rate of 12 characters per second. In
addition the machines must be capable
of random sorting of coded data, great
flexibility in programing, and self-
detection of errors.
Tn the automatic electronic computer
scientists and engineers have a new in-
strument for research which may prove
as upsetting to current scientific theory
as any. Up to now, when physicists,
mathematicians, engineers, economists,
biochemists, and their colleagues in
other sciences got ideas (or hypotheses)
they often found it impossible to test
their validity. Handling of raw data by
old-fashioned methods frequently took
months or years. Take the case of one
English physicist, who spent 15 years in
calculations on atomic structure. With
electronic computers his work could
have been telescoped into hours, or days
at most. R.K.
saudi arabian oil fields
The first petroleum discovery in
America by a white man was near
what is now Cuba Lake, New York.
An oil that floated on the surface of a
pool was discovered by a missionary
priest. Following the discovery of this
"greasy wrater that is like oil and is
used in many cases instead of oil," ex-
plorers and missionaries found many
other oily springs.
One man could collect several gal-
lons of oil per day and, during the
American Revolution, Indian oil men
were selling much oil to white men for
20 dollars a gallon. The meager indus-
try founded by the Indians developed
into a trade that was too good to be
left to mere savages; therefore, enter-
prising oil peddlers soon gained con-
trol of the new-born industry.
The world was eagerly waiting for
the petroleum industry when George
H. Bissell found the key to the world's
treasure of "Black Gold." The Penn-
sylvania lawyer happened to own 100
acres of land in the State's oil area.
He formed the first oil company, the
Pennsylvania Rock Oil Co. Business
boomed and the demand for oil was
much greater than the supply, no mat-
ter how many salt wells and creeks
were skimmed.
grew to meet the waiting demand. It
continued to develop and now ranks as
one of the leaders in the international
economy. Today this industry contrib-
utes a cash income of $4,500,000,000
annually to the national economy. Of
this, 1,500,000,000 constitutes the an-
nual payroll to the industry's workers.
Since research made all this possible,
the industry generously contributes
more than $20,000,000 a year toward
petroleum research. The search for im-
proved products and more efficient op-
erating methods and equipment is nev-
er-ending.

One day, while worrying about the
scanty oil supply, Bissell noticed a
bottle of Samuel Kier's medicinal oil
in a drug store in New York. The bot-
tle's label bore a picture of a salt well
and a wooden derrick from which the
drilling tools were suspended. That
gave Bissell his great idea. If salt wells
could be drilled, why not oil wells?
Why wait for it to bubble up slowly?
Why not drill for it?
Bissell sent "Colonel" Laurentine
Drake to Titusville, Pa. The self-styled
Colonel insisted that he was going to
drill an artesian well, in order to avoid
the laughter of the residents of Titus-
ville. His secret was discovered and it
was dubbed "Drake's Folly." Weeks
passed and nothing happened but on
August 27, 1859, the "Folly" proved
to be a success and the oil industry was
born in America. In 1860 oil sold for
$20 a barrel, but by 1861 the price had
fallen to 19 cents a barrel.
From its beginnings in Pennsylvania
the peroleum industry immediately
An excellent example of general pol-
icy in the petroleum industry is
the Arabian American Oil Company
(Aramco). a rapidly developing enter-
prise which offers an outlet for Amer-
ican capital and ingenuity within Saudi
Arabia. To serve this enterprise, an in-

On the 14th of January, the Amer-
ican Society of Mechanical Engineers
held a business meeting at which the
election of officers took place. The fol-
lowing new officers were elected: Glen
Majors, president: Xavier Okon, vice-
president; Kurt Soehngen, secretary:
and Blaine Rabbers, treasurer.
The meeting also featured the pres-
entation of student talks on various
subjects. Russel Brown talked on "Steel
Mill Maintenance" and Herbert Boothe
talked on the "Functioning of Spark
Plugs." Talks by Russel Parkinson,
Jr., William Woelk, and Donald De-
frain were postponed due to insufficient
time. Applications for transfer from
Student Member to Junior Member
were accepted from graduating stu-
dents.
On February 4, 5, 6. and 7, a mem-
bership booth was operated at which
new members were accepted into the
organization. A record number of 75
new men signed up. It is good indica-
tion of student interest in the field
trips, lectures, educational movies, and
other benefits which the society offers.
Quarterdeck Society
The Quarterdeck society on January
13, 1948 held an initiation banquet at
the Red Coach Inn. A swell meal con-
sisting of ham, beans, potatoes and all
the trimmin's went with it and a good
time was had by all. Eighteen proba-
tionary members were taken into the
Society as regular members. Among the
guests present were Prof. Bragg, for-
mer head of the N.A. department, and
Prof. Vincent of Spoofuncup fame.
The guest speaker for the evening was
Mr. Hugh C. Downer, '39 E., of the
Picklands-Mather Company.

THIS tower reflects great strides in
communications. It's one of the seven
new radio relay towers that link New
York City and Boston.
This new path for Long Distance com-
munication uses microwaves . . . free
from static and most man-made inter-
ference. But, because microwaves shoot
off into space instead of hugging the
earth's curve, we've had to build relay
stations within line of sight to guide
the waves between the two cities. Atop
each tower, metal lenses gather these
waves and, after amplification, relay
them to the next tower. The lenses focus
and direct the radio waves like a search-
light beam.
This new system for transmitting Long
Distance telephone calls, radio and tele-
vision programs is but one phase in the
Bell System's program for improving
this country's communication service;
a never ending program of growth and
development in which many telephone
engineers will participate, and whose
careers will develop with it. There's a
future in telephony.

CHKIC
PRESENTS
prof porter
Two stock questions in any student's
repertoire are "who's your prof?" and
"how is he?" Of Professor R. Clay
Porter it may he said that 100% of his
students invariably answer "Porter to
the first question, and 99.9% reply
"swell!" to the second. The results of
the evaluation of the statistics pertain-
ing to the latter query are remarkable,
indeed, in view of the fact that the
student-teacher relationship is, of cir-
cumstance, practically impersonal. And
yet. it is not too remarkable when we
consider Prof. Porter's approach to
his responsibilities as an educator.
Although he never makes it obvious,
his sincere interest in the student as an
individual imparts that extra 'some-
thing' to his teaching chores which ex-
plains, in part, the "swell!" In his 21
years of teaching (10 years at the Uni-
versity of Kentucky and 11 years here
at Michigan) he has enjoyed not only
his classroom stints, but he has derived
a great deal of pleasure in observing the
advancement of his former students in
industry. This interest is further evi-
denced by his willingness and cheerful-
ness in helping students with their
credit-adjustment problems.
Prof. Porter's slight, wiry build and
soft, southern drawl manage to convey
an erroneous conception of over-all
mildness. But there is little of the 'softy'
in his experience and in some of his
ideas.
At the age of 17, young Porter found
himself in St. Louis armed with nothing
but his diploma from Clinton High
School (Clinton, Kentucky—population
1500—scene of Prof. Porter's birth and
boyhood) and nothing definite in mind.
He secured a job in a wholesale hard-
ware house and worked there for a year
- until business conditions forced his
lay-off.
This predicament proved to be an im-
portant milestone in his career, for, at
the early age of 18, Porter discovered
his need for a set of definite objectives
and further education. When he had left
high school, he firmly believed that he
did not need any more formal education.
That year in St. Louis plus the depres-
sion of 1921 (which caused his lay-off)
made him realize that he needed addi-
tional training to enable him to compete
for a living.
So it was that young Porter evaluated
his interests, abilities, and opportunities
and decided upon mechanical engineer-
ing. He attended the University of Ken-
tucky as an undergraduate and. after be-
ing graduated, he worked for the Gen-
eral Electric Company in Schenectady.
Hut the teaching profession beckoned
him, and so, a year and a half later, he

R. Clay Porter
returned to the University of Kentucky
for graduate studies and the beginning
of his teaching career.
Recalling his own experience Prof.
Porter believes there is a need for a
"sharp" experience in the lives of most
young high-school graduates before
they are admitted to a college, so that
they may better define their objectives
and become more settled and grown-up.
In line with this view point, he is in
favor of a year of compulsory military
training for young men before they are
admitted to a college. Yes, Professor
Porter even suggests that the best thing
that can happen to a young man who has
the stuff is for him to go out on his own
after high school and be fired from a
job! Anything, he says, as long as the
student matures by the time he enrolls
in college.
Speaking about the engineering stu-
dents of today, he has this to say:
"There is something lacking in a stu-
dent's attitude in general; he seems to
be training for a job rather than a
profession. He is job-minded. This is
objectionable because if engineering is
to assume its proper position in relation
to other professions, the student must
imbue himself with the professional
viewpoint while he is in college. Thus,
when he gets out he will regard himself
as a professional man because he never
thought of it in any other way. And as
a result, he will see to it that he main-
tains the dignity and poise that properly
should be part of the professional
individual."
Professor Porter further urges that
each student become acutely aware of
his own shortcomings in oral and
written expression. "Your college days
are probably your last chance to improve
your ability to express yourself before
you find yourself doing just that after
disappointing experiences on the out-
side. Each individual should be his own
sharpest critic of his speech and
writing."
Professor Porter likes people; he
enjoys meeting them. He still recalls,
with a grin, a certain summer he spent
while he was an undergraduate at the
University of Kentucky. It was the
summer following his freshman year,
and he thought it would be "a good
lesson in human relations" to get
summer work. So he hied himself to the
East and became what he likes to think
of as a traveling salesman. There was
no repressing the merriment in his eyes
as he recalled that he "had every type of
experience a book salesman could have,
from an open arms reception to a bull-
dog in the pants." D.S.

John B. Campbell is a true example of
"the chap off the old block." In the past
20 years the varied pursuits and inter-
ests of his family have fused and finally
emerged in the personage of the tall,
lanky, Chemical Engineer major who is
also managing editor of the campus
newspaper, The Michigan Daily.
In addition to his engineering and
editorial responsibilities, John maintains
a highly active schedule, thus giving the
lie to the misconception that an engineer
can't see beyond the end of his slide rule.
His activities range from writing for the

Not long ago, a radio beam flashed
across the New York sky—and "car-
ried" more than 7000 surgeons into
a small operating room . . .
Impossible? It was done by television,
when RCA demonstrated—to a congress
of surgeons—how effective this medium
can be in teaching surgery.
In a New York hospital, above an op-
erating table, a supersensitive RCA Image
Orthicon television camera televised a series
of operations. Lighting was normal. Images
were transmitted on a narrow, line-of-sight
beam ... As the pictures were seen the
operating surgeons were heard explaining
their techniques . . .
Said a prominent surgeon: "Television
as a way of teaching surgery surpasses
anything we have ever had ... I never
imagined it could be so effective until I
actually saw it..."

Do you know that over 90% of all modern bearing requirements can be
met adequately with the Timken Tapered Roller Bearing? That in this one pre-
cision mechanism is contained a multiplicity of abilities which when fully ap-
preciated and properly applied can overcome any bearing condition you ever
may encounter?
I/O you know that the Timken Roller Bearing is more than an anti-friction
bearing; more than a radial load bearing? That it is an all-load bearing — can
carry, all at once, radial loads, thrust loads, and any combination of them with
full efficiency and certainty?
Do you know that the Timken Bearing was introduced nearly 50 years
ago and has undergone constant engineering development and refinement ever
since? That the Timken-developed process of Generated Unit Assembly produces
true spherical (convex-concave) contact between the large ends of the rolls and
the rib or flange of the cone thereby reducing friction and initial wear to a
minimum; assuring correct alignment of
the rolls with respect to the races; help-
ing to distribute the loads evenly through-
out the bearing; decreasing operating
temperatures; producing quieter running;
and last, but not least, assuring that
when the bearing is properly mounted
no further adjustment is required?
JDO you know that the special alloy
steel from which Timken Bearings are
made was developed in our own metal-
lurgical laboratories and is produced in
our own steel plant? That the Timken
Bearing is the only bearing manufactured
under one roof from raw material to
finished product?

it can help you in your engineering
career? Write us. The Timken Roller

lie represents.
The Detroit Edison Co.
The following information was com-
piled from an interview with Mr. A. R.
Hellwarth, who is in charge of the co-
ordination of employment of college
graduates at the Detroit Edison Co. Mr.
Hellwarth received his B.S. in EE from
the University of Michigan in 1925.
From 1930 to 1933 he taught electrical
engineering at the University of Michi-
gan and was an assistant professor when
he joined the Detroit Edison Co. in
1933. Mr. Hellwarth is also a registered
professional engineer in the State of
Michigan.
The Detroit Edison Company is the
supplier of electric power to Detroit and
the outlying areas. The company is pri-
marily interested in power plant opera-
tion, equipment maintenance, planning
engineering which ultimately leads to
construction, and the integration of the
various components of an electric power
system. Even though research personnel
are on the staff. The Detroit Edison Co.
is not a large employer of men whose
primary interests lie in the field of
research.
The reputation and merit of a large
university as compared to a small uni-
versity have little or no effect upon the
selection of young engineers. What is
gained in a large institution through ad-
ditional lahoratory facilities, more capa-
ble professors, and a greater variety of
courses is counterbalanced by the close
contact of student and professor in a
small university. The professor in a
small university knows his students'
capabilities, qualifications and short-
comings while in a large university the
professor has fewer contacts with each
student to learn his possibilities, inter-
ests and ambitions. When candidates are
considered for employment the choice
depends more upon the man applying
for the position and less on the institu-
tion from which he received his training.
The Detroit Edison Co. is primarily
interested in graduates with B.S. de-
grees in engineering. Even though an
engineer has received a M.S. degree he
cannot be given much more responsi-
bility than the engineer holding a B.S.
degree. This is primarily due to the fact
that the additional year required for a
M.S. degree is generally spent on some
type of specialized training. A good four
years of engineering fundamentals is
ENGINEER IN INDUSTRY
(Continued from page 9)
the primary requirement. During this
period the student should cover a broad
scope of engineering subjects and
should become a well-rounded engineer
rather than a narrow specialist.
To round off the sharp corners of the
engineering student a sufficient number
of credit hours should be allocated to
the study of economics, political science,
business relations and the English lan-
guage, with an added emphasis on the
English. Sufficient facility in the use of
the English language, both written and
spoken, is of the utmost importance to
the engineer not only as an essential of
a broad education but as an aid to his
success in the engineering profession.
Too much emphasis cannot be placed on
acquiring the ability to speak and write
the English language correctly.
As an employer of electrical, mechan-
ical, and civil engineers the Detroit Ed-
ison Co. has the following classifications
of positions in which a student may
make use of his engineering education.
Design of electric power plants and
substations
Plant operation and maintenance
Testing, inspecting, use of instru-
ments
Mathematical calculations
Planning and economic studies
Writing technical reports and speci-
fications
Development and research
I laboratory work
Work using engineering knowledge
as background in fields such as
purchasing or power sales
This list is included primarily to give
engineering students an idea of the
breakdown of positions in an electric
light and power company.
Methods employed in the evaluation
of engineering graduates have proved
of considerable interest to most gradu-
ates and of utmost importance to their
future. Many factors enter into the se-
lection of engineering personnel. Some
considerations are given more weight
than others. In the final analysis the
following items are considered.
1. Elective courses taken — show
special interests of student.
2. Subjects of greatest and least in-
terest — indication of student's
primary interests.
3. Scholastic rating—relative indi-
cation of student's aptitude.
4. Affiliation with technical, profes-
sional, and honorary societies,
student publications and other
campus activities — reveals the
ability of an individual to work
with others, and is a method of
determining how the student used
his free time.
5. Work, during school years—also
indicate the manner in which stu-
dent utilized his free hours.
In addition to the previously mentioned
considerations the graduate will be con-
sidered on the requirements for the
position to be filled, taking into account
such factors as past industrial experi-
ence, military service, personality, ap-
pearance, and maturity.

The Ford Motor Co., manufacturer
of automobiles, trucks, buses, and trac-
tors has contributed much to the devel-
opment and successful operation of this

lines. In addition to the products man-
ufactured, the company processes its
own raw materials. This includes steel-
making, manufacture of coke and gas.
generation of electric power, and the
manufacture of glass, paper, and plas-
tics. The following information is based
upon the experience of the Salaried Per-
sonnel Department in placing college
graduates throughout the company.
Statements made by men on supervisory
and managerial levels have also been
taken into consideration.
There is a general agreement that the
curriculum offered to engineers at the
University of Michigan is adequate
preparation for any beginning position
in the field in which the graduate ma-
jored. The present curriculum also
offers a broad coverage of other fields
of engineering so that the graduate is
capable of meeting and dealing with
problems in related engineering fields.
Graduates seeking employment should
take full advantage of interviews with
company representatives since these in-
terviewers are concerned with the young

an effort to acquaint the young engineer
with the various phases encountered in
the mass production of automobiles.

Because of a unique combination of chemical, electrical,
and mechanical qualities, Synthane laminated plastics can
be applied to an endless number of practical purposes.
Moisture and corrosion resistant, light-weight and struc-
turally strong, Synthane has many collective advantages
not readily found in any other material. One of the best
electrical insulators known, Synthane is hard, dense, dur-
able . . . quickly and easily machined.
Among the interesting occupations of our type of tech-
nical plastics are the redraw bobbin and chuck (below)
used in winding fine denier nylon for women's hosiery.

Fine nylon filaments can be wound without pulling and
sticking because of the smoothness of the bobbin. Light
weight of bobbin and chuck allows the spindle to be started
and stopped faster and with less effort. Greater crushing
strength of tube permits larger amounts of nylon to be
wound. This is an appropriate job for Synthane, an inter-^~~
esting example of using plastics where plastics belong.

an effort to read whatever material the
company has sent to the college place-
ment office. In this way the graduate will
have some idea about the company which
the interviewer represents.
The greatest demand is for mechani-
cal and industrial engineers. Various
specialists are employed in all fields of
engineering. The Ford Motor Company
also employs a number of electrical,
metallurgical, chemical and civil engi-
neers.
The Ford Field Training Program is
a two-year sequence of work designed
to acquaint a highly selected group of
young college graduates with the diverse
activities of modern industrial plants.
This is not a specialized program for
any one specific line of work but is based
on the belief that future personnel act-
ing in a responsible capacity should be
familiar with the various phases of the
industry. Experience has proved that
the maximum efficiency can be obtained
in an organization where supervisory
personnel are acquainted with the oper-
ation, maintenance, and daily problems
encountered in a day's work in a manu-
facturing plant.
ENGINEER IN INDUSTRY
(Continued from page 22)
The selection of candidates for the
Ford Field Training Program is based
upon the following considerations.
Scholarship in the top fourth of the
class is considered as a minimum re-
quirement. Potential leadership ability
will be judged on a basis of past experi-
ence and accomplishment in campus ac-
tivities requiring organizational ability.
Active participation in extra-curricular
activities will be considered as evidence
of that quality of enterprise which is
necessary to advancement in industry.
Final considerations are made on a basis
of "good personality" which includes
poise, enthusiasm, confidence, tact, ap-
pearance and the ability to write and
speak the English language clearly, ef-
fectively and concisely.
A graduate engineer enrolled in the
Ford Field Training Program will work
for periods of variable duration in the
following departments. The trainee usu-
ally starts in the Pattern Shop where he
will assist an experienced patternmaker
and become familiar with this basic
process. He will assist in the Tool &amp; Die
Department where he will work on
lathes, mills, shapers, and the various
types of equipment encountered in the
manufacture and repair of tools and
dies necessary to the maintenance of
steady production. As an assistant in
the Jobbing Foundry the student be-
comes acquainted with the processes in-
volved in molding, melting, and core-
making encountered in producing cast-
ings from molten metal. The trainee
will work in the Gear and Axle Plant
where he will become familiar with gear
and axle assembly and will then work in
the operation of presses connected with
the manufacture of automobile bodies.
Actual experience with steam hammers,
forging presses, and upset machines will
give the student an insight on the oper-
ations involved in spring and frame con-
struction.
In the Motor Plant the trainee will
work on machines producing crank-
shafts, pistons and transmission gears.
This is followed by working on the as-
sembly of Ford engines and considering
the problems of keeping production lines
moving. The final period of the first year
is spent in the Final Assembly Plant

Engineering
Research simplifies print making
with development of "Varigam" Paper
Chemists and physicists make
important contributions
Photographic film that has been over-
exposed or overdeveloped usually means
a "hard" or "contrasty" negative—too
much silver is deposited on the high-
lights in comparison with that in the
shadows. The opposite effect, a "soft"
or "thin" negative, results from under-
exposure or underdevelopment. At one
time photographers had to stock four or
five grades of enlarging paper to correct
for these conditions and get the right
degree of contrast.
To eliminate this expensive, unwieldy
situation, scientists developed "Vari-
gam" variable contrast photographic
paper. With "Varigam," the whole
procedure of getting different degrees
of contrast is reversed. Instead of using
several grades of paper, the photog-
rapher uses only one. He gets variation
in contrast by use of filters that control
the wave lengths of light reaching the
paper, thereby getting finer degrees of
contrast than are otherwise possible.
The action of "Varigam" depends
on the ability of certain dyes to extend
the sensitivity of silver halide emulsions
beyond the blue and blue-green regions.
This effect was well known to scientists.
But "Varigam" has an added feature
—it gives high contrast in the blue por-
tion of the spectrum and is also sensi-
tive to light in the green region, with
low contrast.
"Varigam" the work of many men
The first job was one for the physical
chemists. Silver halide emulsions, nor-
mally sensitive to blue light, had to be
made to give maximum contrast when
exposed to light in this region.
It was known that certain dyes would
extend the sensitivity of the emulsion
over as far as the infra-red. But they
were not practical for photographic pa-
per, being affected by the red safety
light used in the darkroom. Research by
chemists showed that certain dyes such
as l:l'-diethylthiopseudocyanine iodide
extended the light sensitivity only to
the green region. And, most important,
they produced low contrast when used
in lower-than-normal concentrations.
When such a dye was combined with
high-contrast silver halide emulsion,
the result was an emulsion that gave
high-contrast prints when exposed to
blue light, and low-contrast prints when
exposed to green light.
Physicists Develop Filters
Physicists made this contrast control a
reality by preparing sharp-cutting fil-
ters that allow the user to control his
printing light selectively. These filters,
which are attached to the lens of the en-
larger, range from blue for high con-
trast to yellow, which cuts out the blue
almost entirely and gives low contrast.
In between are eight grades of filters
with intermediate degrees of blue and
yellow light transmission. All of the fil-
ters are made in such a way that neither
light nor printing time needs to be
varied as filters are changed, except the
last two on the blue end. These require
approximately twice the time of the
others.
In "Varigam," made by Du Pont,
chemical science has given the photog-
rapher new economy and convenience
in printing, and a degree of contrast
control more precise than is possible
with any combination of commercial
papers.
Questions College Men ask
about working with Du Pont
What types of training are needed?
The majority of openings for college graduates at
Du Pont are in technical work and are usually in
chemical, physical, or biological research; chemi-
cal, mechanical, civil, electrical, or industrial
engineering. Openings are available from time to
time in other fields, including architecture, ceram-
ics, metallurgy, mining, petroleum and textile
engineering, geology, mathematics, accounting,
law, economics, and journalism. Write for booklet,

labor relations, job analysis, administra-
tion, testing, public relations, purchas-
ing, finance, law, sales, and advertising.
The General Motors Corp.
Mr. H. C. Bigler, manager of the
Personnel Clearing Center at General
Motors Corporations, discussed the po-
sition of the young engineer in industry
and has expressed the following views.
The General Motors Corporation is
engaged in the manufacture of automo-
biles, busses, trucks, diesel engines, clie-
sel electric locomotives, electric refriger-
ators and household appliances, aircraft
engines and propellers, commercial elec-
tric motors, and roller and ball bearings.
In addition to the manufacture of these
items G.M.C. is also engaged in the
manufacture of accessories used in these
products. As can be seen, many opportu-
nities exist for college graduates with an
engineering background.
Some graduates are under the impres-
sion that their immediate value to in-
dustry is unlimited. Some expect re-
sponsible positions before they have re-
ceived sufficient experience. Some feel
that their diploma is a one-way ticket to
(Continued from page 24)
a soft job. This is true primarily of men
who have not had any previous indus-
trial experience and know little about
the functioning of an industrial world.
In General Motors, college men are pro-
moted on a basis of progress, quality of
their work, and lYieir attitude toward
their job and their fellow employees.
Young men who are willing to learn
from past experience of qualified engi-
neers, and who realize that their college
education is only a stepping stone and
serves as a foundation on which to build
success are apt to advance in responsi-
bility and knowledge. However, a young
engineer who expects special favors and
considerations without showing his abil-
ity is bound to meet with disappoint-
ment.
Generally, men are sought who have
an average or better scholastic record.
At times men with lower grades, who
have proved to be outstanding in other
phases of college life are employed. Stu-
dents who just managed to get by are
not good prospects. On the other hand
experience indicates that men who
through high scholastic achievement
feel they have learned all there is to
know and consider themselves as spe-
cialists do not generally succeed. In con-
sidering a graduate the following points
are carefully evaluated.
1. Scholastic record—showing the
ability to learn.
2. Extra-curricular activities (stu-
dent publications, technical and
honorary societies) — indicates
that the person likes to associate
with other people and at times is
indicative of potential leadership
ability.
3. Work, during college years —
teaches individual the value of
work.
In addition, men are screened on a
basis of personality, general intelligence,
leadership, dependability, character, ap-
pearance, maturity and conversation.
Mechanical, electrical, metallurgical,
and chemical engineers hired by G.M.C.
are usually placed in one of the follow-
ing fields of work.

search conducted for new informa-

Thousands of families say
^^^^_v their next coffee-maker will
'^SMlE he glass. Why? Because they
^^S^ like their coffee just right!
Glass lets you see and control the strength
of the brew. Glass never alters flavor, even
when coffee stands and is reheated through-
out the day in your home or in a restaurant.
And you can see at a glance when a glass
coffee-maker is clean...so your next brew
will he as rich and amber-clear as the first.
There are five excellent glass coffee-
makers on the market today. And everyone
of them uses Pyrex hrand glass parts made
by Corning. The reason? Because Corning
makes these glass parts to close tolerances,
with proper sidewall thickness, of uniform
high quality. And Corning makes glass that
can stand heat and cold without breaking.
Everybody benefits today from Coining's
knowledge of glass. You get a better cup of
coffee. Better food cooked in Pyrex ware.
Better soup processed in Corning glass pip-
ing. Better vitamins extracted with Corning
laboratory ware. Better light from bulbs and
luminous tubes made from Coming's glass.
In all, Corning makes about 37,000 items
in glass. Many of them have been applied in
fields once held by other materials. Glass
gets into new jobs because Corning uses it
as a material of unbounded possibilities.
Perhaps some day, in the business you select,
glass will be able to cut costs, improve pro-
cesses, or add to the saleability of your
product. That's the time to remember us.

factured by General Motors Corpora-
tion. New scientific and engineering
principles are exploited in an effort to
develop and simplify manufacturing
techniques and processes.
Product Design—Use of new and old
information in an effort to improve
existing products or create new-
products.
Experimental Product Design —
Building and testing of new and im-
proved models. Most of this work is
carried on in the laboratory, experi-
mental shop, or proving ground.
Many times the product is followed
through the early stages of produc-
tion to overcome the difficulties that
are encountered.
Production and Plant Engineering—
Preparation and maintenance of the
plant and equipment used to manufac-
ture the developed product. This work
entails the design of special tools, jigs
and fixtures; development of proc-
esses and manufacturing methods to
he used: layout of equipment in the
plant; and maintenance of plant and
associated equipment.
(Continued from page 26)
Training for Supervision—Working
in various departments of a plant to
learn the product and the processes
and methods used in manufacture.
Qualified trainees are given training
in foremanship and later placed in a
supervisory capacity.
Accounting—The men in this cate-
gory assist in the handling of general
and cost accounting problems in-
volved in plant operation. Men em-
ployed in this field are first given a
general manufacturing background
by working timekeepers and at vari-
ous clerical positions throughout the
plant.
Service — Here the young graduate
contacts the users of manufactured
equipment to determine any opera-
tional difficulties, and renders any
service necessary for satisfactory
operation.
The present curriculum is quite satis-
factory. Engineering subjects should be
of a general nature and specialization
should be limited. One of the most im-
portant deficiencies of the present edu-
cational system is a course in "Job Ap-
plication." A course of this type cannot
be given in one semester but should be
part of a student's training throughout
his college career. Too many engineers
do not know how to apply for a job—a
situation which leads to much dis-
appointment. Many employers when
consulted expressed a desire to see
some sort of job awareness while the
student pursues his studies. Not for the
student to concentrate on trying to get
an "A" average, but rather to round
out his education with courses in law.
business relationships, and the like.
The majority of young engineers
hired by General Motors Corporation
hold B.S. degrees in engineering. There
is little use for men with M.S. degrees,
however, some men with M.S. degrees
are required for General Motors Tech
and the research department.
On the subject of university reputa-
tion it is quite adequate to state that a
man becomes a good engineer because
of his own initiative, desire, and ability,
and not because of the school he
attended.

Just plain Salt! But what wonders
it performs in the hands of expert
chemists and engineers. Its two
components play a big part in the
production of paper, soap, glue,
metals, metal products, textiles,
insecticides. They help to sanitize
water, launder clothing, kill
bacteria in dairies, restaurants,
food plants.
"Miracle-working" with Salt—as
well as other basic chemicals—
has been Pennsalt's business for
98 years. Starting with a modest
plant at Natrona, Pa., Pennsalt
has steadily grown, until today it
stands as o.ie of America's impor-
tant chemical companies.
Big ? Yes . . . but not so big as to
swallow up its promising young
men. Old? Yes . . . but not too
old to adopt young ideas that are
sound. Pennsalt was founded by a
young man; and grew large through
the efforts of young men.
The future, too, looks bright for
Pennsalt . . . and for the young
men who are going to build it.

establishments are cooperating in order
that the student may realize the indus-
trial implications of his work. Thus the
project incorporates a practical working
knowledge of the ordnance-industry-
research concept at the undergraduate
level. It is believed that the case study
method is more meaningful and prac-
tical than general historical studies sim-
ilar to the background material pre-
sented earlier in this discussion.
Limitations as to selection of prob-
lems are few. Essentially they are:
1. Coordination with the student's
scholastic major.
2. Coordination, insofar as is prac-
tical, with local industrial concerns
and ordnance establishments.
3. Coordination with the field of ord-
nance in which the student desires
to specialize.
4. Coordination with the student's
academic level.
5. Selection of a topic which will
allow concrete, quantitative solu-
tions.
6. Selection of a university faculty
member who will assist in the
problem.
(Continued from page 11)
7. Existence of facilities to complete
the project.
Actually these requirements present
practically no limitations upon the ord-
nance student. The scope of ordnance
materiel is broad enough to make avail-
able a wealth of topics to any student in
a technical college. This can best be ex-
emplified by noting that each major field
of ordnance involves several technical
fields: mathematics, mechanics, metal-
lurgy, chemistry, electricity, electronics,
and automotive engineering, etc. It is
revealing that the majority of these
fields are involved in each ordnance
item listed below:
1. The electronic director and remote
control mechanisms for tracking and ad-
justing the fire of heavy anti-aircraft
weapons.
2. A self-propelled 240 mm. How-
itzer.
3. An electrically fired high-
explosive, barrage rocket equipped with
a V. T. (proximity) fuse.
4. A tank and its hyper-velocity anti-
tank gun equipped with a gyroscopic
stabilizer.
The raw materials involved, as well
as the design, production engineering,
inspection, warehousing, and supply of
these items, broaden the scope as indi-
cated above. Every university profes-
sor, commercial firm or ordnance
installation contacted has given full
cooperation.
A short review of some of the proj-
ects will indicate the work now being
done:
Supply Project. This involves a com-
parison of the stock control, accounting,
warehousing, and handling methods of
a large commercial concern and those of
the ordnance supply system. Six after-
noons have been spent under the guid-
ance of Sears Roebuck officials in one of
their Detroit warehouses. A smiliar in-
vestigation has been made of Rossford
Ordnance Depot in Toledo. The faculty
adviser for the project is Professor
Charles L. Jamison of the School of
Business Administration.

and Gaging Project. This project is es-
sentially a study of the instrumentation

were bombed out in Antwerp, Manila, Ghent, the power
plant eame to them...the mountain to Mohammed.

before stationary power plants could be rebuilt. At home,
in other emergencies, they brought succor to Jacksonville

There are lots of problems in building boilers for central
stations that hop about. The ships must be designed for
passage through narrow locks and channels. Boiler weight
and size must he pared down to make room for plenty of
f uel... boiler efficiency kept high to make fuel last.
ItiKW built the boilers for the first floating power plant,
has built others like them since. In this, as in its pioneering
work in many fields, B&amp;W illustrates its two major re-
sources: the long experience of the past...its engineering
vision, the courage to have new ideas.
B&amp;W offers technical graduates excellent career op-
portunities in diversified fields of manufacturing, sales,
engineering and research.

Small Arms Materiel — Caliber .50
Aircraft Machine Gun. This project in-
volves a quantitative mechanical study
of the aircraft machine gun. Starting
with a time displacement curve obtained
from Aberdeen Proving Ground the
study involves acceleration and velocity
determinations for selected linkages and
their effects on gun functioning. Faculty
adviser is Mr. Paul F. Chenea.
Fire Control Materiel—Optical. A
quantitative check of the location of the
tolerances involved in the panoramic
telescope. Starting with a study of the
geometrical optics of lenses and prisms,
the project is expected to give the stu-
dent a working knowledge of optical
instruments of reasonable complexity.
The faculty adviser is Professor Robley
C. Williams. The commercial concern is
Argus Incorporated.
(Continued from page 30)
Automotive Materiel. The study of
automotive test and maintenance pro-
cedures. These include driver, organiza-
tional and field maintenance of the
ROTC vehicles as well as preparation
necessary for overseas shipment. The
project also includes proof tests which
are practical in the vicinity and partici-
pation in selected experiments in the
University automotive laboratories. The
faculty adviser is Professor Walter E.
Lay. The ordnance installations cooper-
ating are the Detroit Tank Arsenal and
Ross ford Ordnance Depot.
Ammunition Materiel — Ballistics.
Starting with the calculation of an ar-
tillery trajectory, the project includes a
study of interior ballistics, exterior bal-
listics, and firing tables. The solution
gives the student a practical knowledge
of an application of finite differences
and numerical integration as well as an
appreciation of the ballistic phase of the
ammunition problem. The faculty ad-
viser is Professor George E. Hay.
The student is expected to spend a
total of approximately 90 hours during
his fourth year of the project. Short
weekly progress meetings are arranged
with the faculty adviser. The project is
considered the equivalent of 39 lecture
hours. If the student has carefully
planned his academic course, there are
excellent possibilities of combining his
project with some other phase of his
academic work.
The Ordnance Materiel Specialty
Project is a challenge to every eligible
technical student in the University. The
Detroit Ordnance District was the larg-
est source of procurement for ordnance
materiel in World War II. The Ross-
ford Ordnance Depot and the Detroit
Tank Arsenal as well as the local indus-
trial concerns have assigned key person-
nel to work with the students. The pro-
fessors involved have given freely of
their time and specialized knowledge.
Through the Ordnance Materiel Spe-
cialty Project the student can advance
himself in his civilian profession and in
an allied military field. With the active
support which is being given by the fac-
ulty, industry, and Ordnance, the stu-
dent has an unique opportunity which is
limited only by his own initiative,
energy, ability and technical back-
ground.

Maryland school designed for best use of daylight
Study and play rooms of the L.och Raven School. Baltimore,
Maryland, follow the progressive trend in school design—
they are daylighted to achieve the most uniform light distribution
and the lowest possible brightness contrasts. This is accomplished
with Insulux Prismatic Glass Block—hollow block faced inside
with two banks of horizontal prisms.
Panels of this functional block bend light upward. The brightest
beam emerges between 7 and 27 degrees above the horizontal
even though the sun may be at any altitude from zero to 70
degrees—even on cloudy days when there is no sun.
Why prismatic block? To shield the eyes of the child from
large areas of bright sky and still save the light from the sky for
use on his task. The task 20 feet from the window is kept just
as bright as if the same area were window, one third shaded,

Even what was to be one of the great-
est theories of all physics and whose
influence was untimately to yield a
drastic blow to the mechanical philos-
ophy. Maxwell's highly mathematical
electromagnetic theory, was explained
by its author on the basis of mechanical
analogy. Maxwell reduced his theory to
the principles of dynamical science "by
showing that no electromagnetic phe-
nomenon is contradictory to the suppo-
sition that it depends on purely dynam-
ical action." Thus, Maxwell said in his
famous Treatise on Electricity and
Magnetism. However, he was not the
only scientist who believed that there
was some way of forming a mechanical
conception of the electronic state. In
1897, barely three years before he pro-
posed the quantum theory which marked
the first outstanding departure from the
mechanical philosophy. Max Planck
said :*
'"Although it may be of advantage for
a time to consider the activities of na-
ture, Heat, Motion, Electricity, etc.. as
different as to their common nature, still
our aspirations after a uniform theory
(Continued from page 13)
of nature, on a mechanical basis or
otherwise, which has derived such
powerful encouragement from the dis-
covery of the principle of conservation
of energy, can never be permanently
repressed."
One reason existed for failure of the
classical scientists to recognize that the
mechanical interpretation of physical
phenomena was not the overall and uni-
fying principle of nature. The majority
of leaders in scientific thought over-
looked the significance of several minor
experiments and unusual observations
wherein lay the evidence of the connec-
tion between light and electricity. One
of these observations was that the ratio
of electrical quantities measured in the
electromagnetic system of units to those
measured in the electrostatic system of
units was equal to the speed of light.
Still another latent observation link-
ing the phenomenon of light with elec-
tricity was the fact that the vibration
plane of polarized light was rotated
when reflected from the finely polished
surface of a magnet. These and other
observations pointed toward a relation
between light and electricity, but they
were too feeble to bear the fruit of
correct interpretation, for a good time
anyway, in the prevailing atmosphere of
the mechanical philosophy.
The crowning achievement of the age,
James Clerk Maxwell's (1831-1879)
electromagnetic theory, even though it
contained the revolutionary quantum
theory was not accepted in his native
England for years—not until 1883. Yet.
he had propounded his theory in a paper
as early as 1856 and followed this up
with his famous "Treatise" in 1873. He
proposed that if electromagnetic waves
could be generated they would travel
through space with the speed of light
and that light, essentially, was an elec-
tromagnetic phenomenon ; that light and
electrical waves should differ only in
wave length and in frequency of vibra-
tion—any difference in behavior would
be due to their dissimilarity in wave
lengths.

PROBLEM — You are designing a machine which
includes a number of electrical accessories any one
of which can be turned on by means of a rotary
switch. For reasons of assembly and wiring this
switch has to be centrally located inside the machine.
Your problem is to provide a means of operating the
switch from a convenient outside point. How would
you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER — Use an S.S.White re-
mote control type flexible shaft to connect the switch
to its control knob. This arrangement gives you com-
plete freedom in placing both the switch and the
control knob anywhere you want them. That's the
way one manufacturer does it in the view below of
part of the equipment with cover removed.

This is just one of hundreds of remote control and power
drive problems to which S.S.White flexible shafts provide
a simple answer. That's why every engineer should be
familiar with these "Metal Muscles"* for mechanical bodies.

THE ROMANCE OF MODERN
PHYSICS
(Continued from page 34)
Modern Physics (1888- )
Helmholtz seemed to be one of the few to appreciate the
tenability of Maxwell's theory when he suggested to a young
German physicist, Heinrich Hertz (1857-99), that the latter
show experimentally that these electromagnetic waves could
he produced in the manner Maxwell described. The interval
between 1883 and 1887 marked the calm before the storm,
the eve of a series of epoch-making discoveries, the prelude
to the transition between the classical physics and the quan-
tum physics. During these four years the electromagnetic
theory was gaining more and more prestige.
Helmholtz realized, however, the need of experimental
work for confirming Maxwell's theory. This was success-
fully carried out in 1887. In that year Hertz discovered the
photoelectric effect; he produced electromagnetic waves and
showed that they had the properties of light. They were
subject to the laws of reflection, refraction, and interfer-
ence. Later it was shown that their speed was identical with
that of light.
The significant effect of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory
on "pure physics" was that it marked the transition from
the mechanical philosophy to the abstract one. This transi-
tion started with the interpretation by Hertz and Lorentz of
Maxwell's equations. Although Maxwell formulated his
equations with the aid of a mechanical background, as has
already been mentioned, Hertz realized in 1888 the fact that
the mechanical background was irrelevant. The mechanical
tide was ebbing.
With the discovery of the photoelectric effect the third
period, known as modern physics, began. In rapid succession
came the discovery of x-rays (1895), radioactivity (1896),
and the electron (1897). Then, in 1900. Max Planck pro-
posed the quantum theory. A few years later Einstein
carried Planck's quantum theory a great deal further and
showed that light itself was quantized and behaved like
showers of particles (photons). Many call the age of mod-
ern physics the era of quantum physics. (This is also a very
logical name for this period of physics since with the advent
of the new form of quantum theory known as wave mechan-
ics, beginning in 1925, there has been brought about a syn-
thesis of the classical physics and the old quantum theory
which has had as profound influence on physics as did New-
ton's discoveries centuries ago.)
At present, an entirely new atmosphere prevails in the
world of physics. Today, the prime requisite of any theory
in physical science is that it shall consist of a body of math-
ematical relations. It is not necessary that the concepts be
picturable. If they are, well and good; if not, it is of no con-
sequence. The mathematical approach has borne fruit, no
doubt. Maxwell's highly mathematical electromagnetic
theory has served as an excellent guide for the development
of atomic physics. Today, the scientific search concerns itself
with the mathematical specification of the atom. A contem-
porary physicist remarks:
"All the pictures which science draws of nature and which
alone seem capable of according with abservational fact, are
mathematical pictures . . . From the intrinsic evidence of His
creation, the great Architect of the Universe now begins to
appear as a pure mathematician."

BRIGHT FINISHING was the problem—and engineers
of Crown Cork and Seal Company, Inc., Baltimore,
adopted a high-temperature method for fusing
tin to low-carbon strip, with resultant high-polish
surface, in a continuous production mill.
Then, to obtain the high temperatures necessary
for heat-processing, these engineers selected GAS
and modern Gas Equipment. By directing the heat
of radiant GAS burners over a concentrated area of
the freshly-plated strip it was readily possible to
coordinate the fusing action with the plating
process to accomplish continuous high-speed pro-
duction of bright finished strip.
This typical installation demonstrates the flexi-
bility of GAS and the applicability of modern Gas
Equipment for continuous, production-line heat
processing. Compared with available fuels GAS
is most readily controlled by simple automatic
devices; Gas Equipment can be adapted for use
with existing machinery or incorporated in new
machinery without radical design changes, or ex-
pensive supplemental apparatus.
Manufacturers of Gas Equipment and the American
Gas Association support continuing programs of
research designed to assure the most efficient use
of GAS for every heat-processing requirement.

responsibility for design, financial
phases, selection, and allocation of re-

As part of the refinery project a steam
electric generating station was built
consisting of three 225.000 pound per
hour, 650 pound pressure boilers and
three 6,000 KW turbine generators. A
66KV transmission line was built in
1946 between the refinery and Dhahran.
A 10,000 KW turbine will be added to
the refinery power station.
Communication
Communication within Arabia is pri-
marily by radio telephone. Both station-
ary and portable sets are used. Road
construction has lagged, but for the most
part this difficulty has been overcome by
using low pressure tired equipment. A

Housing
Some start has been made toward de-
veloping the few materials of construc-
tion found in Saudi Arabia. Clay brick
and native stone are used extensively.
Plants to calcine gypsum and process
Portland cement may be added.
The program includes provision for
housing American employees in about
the same type of facilities as they are
accustomed to in this country. Because
of three or four months of high temper-
ature weather, all living quarters and
principal offices are air cooled. The same
equipment is used for heating in winter.
Aramco has established an ultra-
modern enterprise which offers excep-
tional opportunities for young engineers
in Saudi Arabia. Their experience has
shown that many young men have de-
veloped their talents exceptionally rap-
idly and have proved their ability to
assume responsibility very early in their
careers. A second glance in the direction
of Saudi Arabia may be worthwhile, for
there the latest chapter in the history of
man's search for Black Gold is being

Chemists and Engineers Team Up
for Progress at Pand G
From basic chemical research, science
moves forward into many different fields
at Procter &amp; Gamble. Here's an example:
A major synthetic detergent is made by
the sulfation and neutralization of fatty
alcohols. These alcohols are prepared by
the sodium reduction of long-chain esters.
The picture left shows a reduction of a
triglyceride to an alcohol by the classic
Bouveault-Blanc process, in one of the re-
search laboratories. For years this was a
laboratory curiosity. Recent research,
however, increased yields and brought
the possibility of commercial use.
The picture right shows the colossus
that has grown out of this research. It's a
new P and G plant, now using sodium in
tank car lots to produce fatty alcohols.
Between the two lies the whole story
of science at P and G—of chemists and
engineers working together to create new
products and new processes and to de-
sign, build, and operate new equipment
and new factories.
This is scientific teamwork at its best
—teamwork* that leads to progress.

John's hyperactivity on the Michigan
campus is equally matched by that of
his high school days in Swarthmore,
Pennsylvania. There he not only edited
the school newspaper, hut also partici-
pated in dramatics, the glee club, student
government, and the orchestra. When
family tradition decided John's choice
of university (as it did for his brother
who is a freshman in Engineering) he
merely transferred the scene of his
activities to Ann Arbor.
It is interesting to note how faithfully
John Campbell mirrors his family.
John's father, a Michigan engineering
alumnus, is a manager of engineering
for Westinghouse ; his mother is a grad-
uate from a music conservatory and the
whole family has been stained by print-
ers' ink from way back. Two uncles in
Owosso, Michigan, are running a press
which was bought by John's grandfather
from Thomas E. Dewey's father. Thus
it is easy to trace John's connection with
engineering, newspapers, and music.

(Continued from page 18)
John admits, rather reluctantly, that he
used to play the violin during his high
school days, but dropped it because of
lack of time. At present his only musical

activity consists in listening to it; his
classical favorites are Wagner and
Brahms.
As editor of the Daily, John believes
that a college newspaper should express
political beliefs, not of those who run
the paper, but indiscriminately of all
staff members, so as to represent a cross-
section of the student body. This policy
makes any staff member eligible to write
an editorial, which is printed solely on
its merits of good newspaper writing.
subject, of course, to the further limita-
tions of good taste.
Although a senior, John still has a
year and a half of schooling before he
will be graduated in June. 1949. His
plans for the future are still nebulous,
though he hopes some day to be able to
combine his engineering training with
his newspaper work. D.S.
ev
Ev was born in Chicago in the fall of
1928 and has resided in the Windy City
ever since. He entered Hyde Park High
School in February of 1941 and imme-
diately plunged into many activities in-
cluding sports writing for the school
paper and playing varsity tennis. In his
senior year he was honored by being
elected to the presidency of the Senior
Class and in addition was named chair-
man of the Student Council.

Plenty—if it's made of molybdenum high-speed
steel. Most of the major hacksaw blade manufac-
turers have standardized on molybdenum steels.
Why? Because molybdenum steels for saw blades
are not only cheaper than 18-4-1, but they last much
longer. Records made in the customer's plants have
proved the wisdom of their choice.*
The same reasons—10^ to 20^ a pound saving
over 18-4-1; more tools for the same gross weight of
steel; better cutting performance; longer operation
between regrinds—are back of the widespread
adoption of molybdenum steels for all sorts of
metal-working tools.
If you'll compare actual tool costs on any par-
ticular job, we think you'll discover why it pays to
specify molybdenum high speed steels.
*Our booklet on molybdenum high speed steels will give you
proof of these statements. Write for it.

ered both the accounting and engineer-
ing professions; hut. by the time he
entered the University of Michigan in
1945, he had decided on industrial en-
gineering as his course of study. Evi-
dently the reputation of Michigan as an
engineering school has penetrated even
to Chicago, for Ev decided to enter the
University on the basis of that reputa-
tion.
Upon entering Michigan, Ev wasted
no time in lending his many talents to
the school. He became the freshman rep-
resentative on the Engineering Council
and in his second semester as a fresh-
man was elected to the Union staff. He
also found time to write sports articles
for the Daily. He pledged Zeta Zeta Tail
in his freshman year and was initiated
when a sophomore.
As a sophomore, Ev continued his
work on the Daily and was elected treas-
urer of the Engineering Council. As a
junior, he added further to his outside
activities, becoming the night editor of
the Daily and being named to Triangles.
His third year at Michigan marked his
election to the presidency of the Engi-

neering Council. This, his senior year,
finds Ev holding the following posi-
tions : sports editor of the 'Ensian, pres-

Everett Ellin
ident of the Engineering Council, mem-
ber of the Men's Judiciary Council, and
chairman of the Honor Council. Despite
these extra-curricular activities he man-
aged to maintain a high enough average
to be elected to Tau Reta Hi in the spring
of 1947.
Although he is in the engineering
school, Ev plans to enter the industrial
advertising field. To this end, he plans
on taking a year post-grad course in ad-
vertising. He feels that an engineering
background is invaluable in any field of
work chosen, especially in the field he
has selected. He has also gained some
practical experience in accounting
through working for an accounting firm
the past two summers. Ev is quite plain-
ly preparing himself for any eventuality.
Ev also is an active participant in sev-
eral sports, notably tennis, skiing, and
basketball. Other hobbies include play-
ing a mean guitar and participating in
barbershop harmony whenever he can
find three other "converts." He con-
fesses an urge to travel and has already
succumbed to the urge to the extent of
visiting the West Coast and Sun Valley,
Idaho, last summer. His future plans
along the line of travelling include a
possible trip to Europe in the summer
of 1949. When asked if he was romanti-
cally entangled in any definite way, Ev
replied, "No, I'm just a young boy, yet."

Is a cable covering flameproof? Will it resist high tem-

Long before a cable is manufactured, questions like
these are answered in the Okonite laboratories, proving
ground and in various testing departments of the

Reproduce a blueprint, a specification sheet, a production chart on
Kodagraph Paper—its definition stays crisp, its usefulness is prolonged.
Photograph an accident scene, an operation, a construction project—
every detail remains accurately, lastingly fixed.
File contracts, correspondence, cancelled checks on Reeordak microfilm—
they "stay put" in fixed order, and cannot be altered without detection.
All this you can bring about because photography lasts. Because it
does ... because of its other useful characteristics ... you can do even
more. For examples, write for "Functional Photography." It's free.

GENERAL ELECTRIC
PHYSICIST . .. CHEMIST .. . ENGINEER
for each, General Electric has assignments to his liking
General Electric is not one business, but an organization in 93 plants in 16 states. Graduates of American colleges
of many businesses, ranging from the building of giant and universities are finding that General Electric offers
turbines at Schenectady to the molding of plastics in opportunities to all degrees of specialists, all sorts of
Pittsfield. The 165,000 people of General Electric ivork enthusiasms, all kinds of careers.

ATOMIC PHYSICIST
As the result of its research in nucleonics. General Electric
was asked by the Government in 1946 to take over operation
of the giant Hanford Works, one of the major units of the Man-
hattan Project. With this development, and with the construction
of both a new Atomic Power Laboratory and a new Research
Laboratory at Schenectady, opportunities in all phases of nuclear
research have increased enormously. Herbert C. Pollock (left),
one of the first scientists to isolate U-235, works now with
such electron accelerators as the Betatron and Svnchrotron.
CHEMIST
General Electric is the largest molder of finished plastics
parts in the world. It has also played a large part in the
development of silicones, new chemical compounds from which
a whole new industry is springing. Developments like these
have meant unprecedented opportunities for chemists and
chemical engineers at General Electric. Dr. J. J. Pyle, graduate
in chemistry at British Columbia and McGill, became director
of the G-E Plastics Laboratories at the age of 29.
ELECTRONICS SPECIALIST


For good reason, General Electric Electronics Park has been
called the "Greatest Electronics Center in the World." Its 155
acres look like a campus. Its laboratories, shops and production
lines are the most modern of their kind. It's a Mecca for men
whose attentions perk up at the sight of a circuit diagram—
men like Dick Longfellow, who has worked his way up through
television and high-frequency assignments and is today section
engineer in charge of ground radar equipment.

MULTIPLE HEAT-TREATING FUNCTIONS
UNDER VARIED CONDITIONS
In modern heat-treating, adaptability of equipment and
flexibility of fuel are primary influences in any cost-per-
piece analysis. As a typical example of the flexibility of
the productive flames of GAS, this Conjecto-Fired GAS
Furnace is used for a variety of operations without any
change other than regulation of the fuel-mix and tem-
perature controls.
Atwood Vacuum Machine Company, Rockford, Illi-
nois, is equipped to heat-treat pieces ranging from 1
ounce to 1000 pounds, in volume up to 15,000 pounds
daily. Their modern Gas-fired Equipment is adapted for
annealing, carburizing, drawing, hardening, normaliz-
ing, malleableizing, stress relieving, under rigid metal-
lurgical specifications.
Experienced heat-treating specialists like Atwood
Vacuum Machine Company use GAS because this
flexible, controllable, rapid-heating fuel is so readily
adaptable to all types of processing at any required
temperature. The productive flames of GAS are so
flexible that they can be used for any production-line
heating operation, under the most exacting conditions.

The PianO BusineSS GetS a LI FT... when Alcoa Aluminum Castings Replace Heavy Metal
Even a well-trained husband who'll rearrange the
living room every Spring balks at piano-moving.
You can see the main reason above. It's the big
metal plate that holds the strings—and it has
always tipped the scales at around 125 pounds.
No wonder it gave the piano business a lift when
a progressive piano builder replaced the heavy iron
plate with one weighing 45 pounds—made of
Alcoa Aluminum. As perfected, this big casting
from our foundries is strong to resist the 18-ton
pull of the taut strings. It is stabilized to provide
tonal quality and stay in tune. And its cost today is
competitive with the old-fashioned cast-iron plate.
With other advantages, in other industries Alcoa
Castings are effecting similar changes. In one
plant, their corrosion resistance means no painting,
simple finishing. In another, they are liked for
their superior machinability. In still another, they
are preferred for the ease with which they swing
through production, where iron castings had to be
hauled by truck or hoisted on heavy cranes.
The change from heavy metal castings to Alcoa
Aluminum Castings is a revolutionary switch in
product engineering. Old, old habits are being
questioned as engineers re-evaluate metals—with
a sharper eye than ever before focused on Alcoa
Aluminum. Aluminum Company of America,
Gulf Building, Pittsburgh 19, Pennsylvania.

first in ALUMINUM

Just 60 years ago six young men started a tiny
business in a little shed in Pittsburgh. They began
to make aluminum by a new process. That was
the beginning of what is now Alcoa. Alcoa's aim,
then and now, was to make aluminum cheaper
and more useful. How successfully that has
been done is shown by the fact that America
today has the greatest aluminum industry in
the world, employing around 1,000,000 people
in the manufacture of aluminum in its many
shapes and forms or in making many useful prod-
ucts in which aluminum plays an essential part.

compressor clutch
This new clutch permits the auto-
matic starting of air compressors. Cen-
trifugal force acts on a small quantity
of mercury to produce a hydraulic pres-
sure. This pressure depends upon the
"head" and not the quantity of mercury
and it is this pressure, without using any
mechanical means, which causes the en-
gagement of the friction elements of
the clutch.
The time delay between motor start
and the engagement of the clutch — a
second or more — allows time for the
motor to reach full speed before any
load is applied. In this way the motor
brings to bear its greatest torque plus
the inertia of its rotor to start the load.
Pressure release valves are obviated,
motor current is considerably less, and
the starting windings are protected.
This device is manufactured by the
Mercury Clutch Corporation. R.E.H.
audio coupler
A new interstage coupling unit, called
a Couplate unit, is being produced by
Centralab. It consists of two resistors
and two capacitors bonded closely to a
stealite ceramic plate. Necessary con-
nections between these components are
made through silver paths which are
printed on the base plate. This means
that, to couple two audio stages together,
it is necessary to use only four soldered
connections in place of the usual eight
or nine. The whole unit is no larger than
the conventional mica condenser. Thus
this device results in a more dependable
finished product by saving space, in-
creasing employee productivity and
decreasing wiring errors. R.E.H.
air flow meter
The Hastings Instrument Company
manufactures a very sensitive air flow
meter which can measure accurately
'velocities as low as five feet per minute.
It operates on 110 volts A.C. and can
be adapted for remote indication if de-
sired. Standard strip or circular-chart
electrical recording instruments can be
operated with the output of this device.
A combination of the thermopile and
hot wire principles is the basis of opera-
tion, thus minimizing air temperature
variation errors and increasing the ac-
curacy of the meter. A noblemetal ther-
mopile situated in the air stream serves
as the pick-up element. The instrument
is designed so that alternate junctions
have considerably more cooling than ad-
jacent junctions which are heated by
passing alternating current through the
wire. The D.C. thermo-electric voltage
which is generated then measures the
temperature rise of the warmer junc-
tions.
The instrument has a standard range
of 0 to 2000 feet per minute and is useful
for measuring wind velocities, velocities
in ducts, velocities of flow in air and gas
lines, and for surveying air conditioning
and heating systems. R.E.H.
work holder
A new work holder, a product of the
Universal Vice and Tool Company, pro-
motes safety and accuracy, embodies
versatility in its application, and is a gen-
eral time saver in drill press operations.
It is easily clamped on the column of
the press, and it secures the work piece
with a quarter turn of a single lever. It
may be substituted for simple drill jigs
in many instances, and it may also re-
place such makeshift devices as bolts and
C-clamps. If necessary, the holder may
be swung back to clear a drill jig or
machine vise without removing it from
the press. D.S.
new geiger counter
The TX-5 (ieiger counter is a product
of wartime research which had as its
purpose the design of a device for in-
vestigating areas believed to be contam-
inated with radioactivity. It has since
been found that because of its sensitiv-
ity, portability, and rugged construction
the TX-5 is ideal for use in locating
radioactive ores. For this application,
the operator merely turns the switch on
and listens to the frequency of the sharp
clicks. When the TX-5 probe approaches
radioactive minerals such as pitchblende,
carnotite, or curite the frequency of the
clicks increases. When very close, the
sound is more like a buzz. The sounds
made by low grade or high grade ores
can be differentiated.
This device is the simplest of its kind
ever manufactured for field use. yet it
is very durable and sensitive. It consists
of a probe, a pair of headphones, and an
amplifier unit which contains the bat-
teries by which it is powered. All these
components together weigh less than 12
pounds. R.E.H.
small induction heater
The Induction Heating Corporation
is now manufacturing an efficient source
of radio-frequency energy called the
TherMonic Model 43. This versatile
heat generator is designed for continu-
ous, full-load use in production work
or for intermittent use. Hardening,
brazing, soft-soldering, annealing, and
mejting operations can be carried on
with this unit which operates on 120-
volt, 60-cycle power and puts out at full-
load 43 Htu's |&gt;er minute at a normal
operating frequency of 450 kilocycles.
Water-cooling of the working coils
is not necessary in this device, nor is it
necessary, when switching from one coil
to another, to make any adjustments on
the generator. To get single or multi-
turn coils it is necessary merely to sha]&gt;e
copper wire or tubing to the work piece.
This device is fully protected against
improper voltage or load conditions by
a plate overload circuit breaker and an
instantaneous line circuit breaker.
R.E.H.
cool grinder
A revolutionary method of intro-
ducing coolant directly at the point of
contact between a grinding wheel and
the work has been develop by the
DoAlI Company. A controlled amount
of coolant is admitted to the arbor hole
of the grinding wheel by a simple grav-
ity system, and is whirled to the periph-
ery of the wheel by centrifugal force.
Tests have shown that grinding tem-
peratures are reduced several hundred
degrees below that of the best conven-
tional wet grinding systems, and that
surface cracks resulting in conventional
wet grinding are eliminated. The wheel
itself is kept clean and the grinding sur-
face is slushed because of the coolant
flowing through the wheel. Longer
wheel life, better finishes, savings in
equipment cost and in coolant oils, and
cleaner grinding are further advantages.
prospecting apparatus
After 13 years of research an Earth
Resistivity Apparatus has been devel-
oped for conducting electrical prospect-
ing. The apparatus can be used to study
sub-surface conditions before starting
engineering operations; to study sub-
surface geology in connection with the
search for ground water, ores and oil:
and to solve geological problems re-
quiring a knowledge of sub-surface
conditions. D.S.

Horizons of Chemistry
constantly beckon • • •
Dow is deeply interested in colleges and technical schools and maintains
close ties with them. The very nature of our business makes this a logical
course for us to pursue.
We are producers of chemicals essential to industry and agriculture. We
are developers of plastic materials. Wc are the pioneer producers of mag-
nesium, recovering this lightest of all structural metals from ocean water.
We are developers of magnesium alloys and methods for their fabrication.
To carry on this work, research is a necessity and a considerable portion
of our efforts and resources are devoted to it as an undeviating policy.
All these activities require trained men—scientists and technicians—
chemists and chemical engineers—metallurgists, biologists, physicists,
entomologists. Dow employs such men in large numbers—keeps an eye on
them as they emerge from their academic training—gives many of them
special schooling at the Dow plants, according to the jobs they are slated
to do.
In peace as well as in war, chemistry is an essential occupation liccausc it
deals with materials essential to industry and to the health of the nation.
It is a developing business with horizons that constantly beckon—a
profession to intrigue any ambitious young man with an eye to the future.

Rapid quantitative metal analysis is
made possible by a new Geiger-counter
fluorescence analysis unit, which utilizes
a new X-Ray diffraction technique. The
unit determines quantitatively the purity
of metals or the percentages of alloying
components, and the quantities of metal-
lic elements dispersed in non-metallic
carriers. The following description best
explains the use of the unit.
Suppose the cobalt content of an un-
known alloy is required. A specimen of
the unknown alloy is placed in a holder
along with standardizing specimens con-
taining known percentages of the alloy-
ing elements. The Geiger counter is set
at the 36.8-degree mark on a goniometer
scale (from tables of reflection angles
for metals). A sodium chloride crystal
is positioned to halve the Geiger counter
angle. By rotating the specimen holder,
readings are taken first on one or more
of the cobalt standardizing samples and
then on the unknown. By comparing
readings and referring to a calibration
chart, the percentage of cobalt may be
determined. The sodium chloride crystal
is employed for determinations on ele-

comparator gage
A new comparator developed by the
Standard Gage Company is suited to a
wide range of production and inspection
measuring jobs and affords a simple
and effective means of checking plug
gages. It features five interchangeable
tables and the use of standard indi-
cators. The indicator is mounted on the
comparator and the column is positioned
approximately by means of a rack at the
rear. Fine adjustments for setting the
comparator to a standard is effected by
a wing handle D.S.
new air-cooled diesel
The new Model 14 Sheppard Diesel is
ideal for applications requiring a de-
pendable and steady source of power.
These would include pumps, conveyors,
auxiliary lighting plants, or communica-
tion installations. The engine may be
purchased direct-connected to a 2 KW
generator.
The Model 14 is distinctive in two re-
spects: it is the smallest Diesel in size
and horsepower rating to be built thus
far for commercial use; and it is the
only stationary Diesel that is air-cooled.
By not using a liquid cooling system the
motor can be built smaller and lighter,
and servicing and maintenance time are
reduced.
This single cylinder. 4-cycle engine
develops 3}^ continuous H.P. at a speed
of 1800 R.P.M. It can be started either
by hand or with a 12 volt electric starter.
An idea of its economy of operation can
be obtained by noting that the capacity
of its fuel tank is onlv 9/10 of a gallon.

rubber hardness tester
Developed by the United States
Rubber Company, the Rex Hardness
Gage measures the hardness of rubber
and similar materials. By merely press-
ing one end of the gage against the sur-
face to be tested, the hardness is read
from the indicator in the same units as
the Shore durometer. The device con-
tains no gears, cams, levers, or pivots,
and with normal use, need never be
calibrated. D.S.

Nationwide television service requires
the distribution to remote areas of pro-
pram material originating in any one
locality, as is now clone by means of wire
networks in sound broadcasting. Facil-
ities for this service usually employ di-
rective radio or wire networks which
are capable of transmitting a modulation
band ranging from 30 cycles to several
million cycles per second.
Perhaps the foremost problem in the
development of commercial television
for domestic use is the one concerning
network programs. The cost of staging
a television program is considerably
greater than that of a corresponding
sound program, and it becomes neces-
sarv and desirable therefore to chain
together many cities for the same pro-
gram. This chain operation will result in
reduced costs and greater variety of pro-
grams and will, therefore, promote the
expansion of the television broadcast-
ing industry. The availability of vido
programs throughout large areas will,
of course, speed the purchase of televi-
sion receivers by the public and in turn
advance the growth of this new art.
Radio relays and coaxial cable sys-
tems for chaining television programs
have been in operation for a number of
years in this country. The pioneer in the
radio link or relay system has been the
Radio Corporation of America and its
broadcasting company, the National
Broadcasting Company. Other major
contributors to the art of linking tele-
vision stations by radio relays include
I'hilco. General Electric, and the Bell
System (American Telephone and Tele-
graph. Inc.). The pioneer, and virtually
the only important contender in the
cable network system for television is
the Bell System.
There has been, and still is, very keen
competition between the companies
which are perfecting radio links and the
Bell System which sponsors the cable
method. Bell, however, has the advan-
tage of experience gained in having es-
tablished sound networks. But, as there
have been definite indications that radio
relays are in many cases equal and su-
perior to cable networks, both from the
&lt;
Shielded lens antenna on one of the seven low-
ers of the New-York-Boston microwave relay
station.

standpoint of cost and performance, Bell
is now working on a radio relay of its
own so as not to be left out of the field
if the radio relay system finally proves
to be superior.
Applications of radio and cable links
are not limited to inter-city networks
where these links may be supplied by
'common carriers.' but include use as
studio to transmitter and field pick-up
links which would probably be owned
by the individual stations.
Most of the network systems used up
to the present time have, in part at least,
been of an experimental nature. How-
ever, at present RCA has put a micro-
wave link unit into mass production.
This unit, although primarily designed
for field pick-up, is also to be used for
inter-city networks. The Bell System, in
turn, is producing coaxial cable for tele-
vision in large quantities and has already
submitted a list of prices for "common
carrier" service.
The advanced state of television net-
works can be further illustrated by the
fact that in June of 1947 the Federal
Communications Commission called
what it termed a "most important en-
gineering conference" between televi-
sion broadcasting companies, the Bell
System, and leading video and micro-
wave equipment manufacturers to de-
termine a schedule for the expected in-
stallation of "common carrier" coaxial
cable and radio relay facilities for tele-
vision broadcast relaying.
In view of the advanced state of the
solution of the network problem for
television, it is interesting to examine the
history and performance of the radio re-
lay and cable systems for television net-
works.
Television Radio Relay Networks
RCA was the first to experiment with
the idea of relaying television programs
by radio. In 1933 they set up an experi-
mental system between New York City
and Camden, N. J. In 1936, another ex-
perimental link was set up between Long
Island and New York. By 1939, the
video art had advanced to 441-line pic-
tures and the video modulation band
bad increased to four megacycles. It was
at this time that RCA built and operated
a 500-megacycle television radio relay
which proved to be the forerunner of
the present radio relay link for televi-
sion. This relay system consisted of a
terminal station at Hauppage. a repeater
station at Rocky Point, 15 miles away,
and a terminal at Riverhead. 15 miles
still further on. All these towns are on
Long Island.

The reason for using 500 megacycles
as the frequency for this system and the
one which was responsible for going up
still further in frequency later on is that
for a properly designed antenna the re-
quired power gain is inversely propor-
tional to the square of the frequency

L. R. Buckendale, 16E
A highly successful and respected
member of the engineering profession
is Mr. L. R. Buckendale of Detroit who
received his bachelor's degree from the
College of Engineering in 1916.
Mr. Buckendale received his first ex-
perience in the engineering field work-
ing as a draftsman while attending the
University. Upon graduation he ac-
cepted a position as an assistant engineer
with the Timken-Detroit Axle Company
of Detroit.
Between 1917 and 1919 Mr. Bucken-
dale served as a Captain in the Ordnance
Department of the U. S. Army and was
in charge of engineering of the MK-
VIII heavy tank being developed at that
time.
Upon being discharged from the
Army, Mr. Buckendale resumed his
position with the Timken-Detroit Axle
Company and since then has risen to
the position of Vice-President in charge
of Engineering which he now holds.
Mr. Buckendale has been active for
many years in the Society of Automo-
tive Engineers, and he has held many
offices in the organization including
President, Vice-President. Councillor,

As Vice-President and director of the
Austin Company of Cleveland, Joseph
K. Gannett can look back on a varied and
successful career in the field of civil en-
gineering.
After earning the degree of Bachelor
of Science in Civil Engineering in 1910,
Mr. Gannett accepted a position with
Anton Burchard, a construction engi-
neer of Cleveland. Later, he moved to a
similar position with J. W. Frazier, head
of another Cleveland construction en-
gineering firm.
In 1914 Mr. Gannett was named chief
draftsman of the valve department of
the New York City and St. Louis Rail-
road. He joined the Austin Company in
1915 and held positions as District En-
gineer in Philadelphia. District Sales

Fred F. Hediger, '24E
Fred F. Hediger is a practical man
who has put practical engineering to
work in a big way since receiving his
B. S. in Electrical Engineering from the
University of Michigan in 1924.
Mr. Hediger is a native of Switzer-
land and received his early training in
Europe. While on campus, Mr. Hediger
served as president of the Cosmopolitan
Club and was a member of the student
branch of the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers. After graduation
from the College of Engineering, he was
employed by a large utility company as
inspector of electrical construction and
later he became interested in property
management. It was while engaged in
this field of endeavor that he first dis-
covered the urgent need for education
on certain subjects, and he set out to
make a close study of all factors which
affect the safety and the economical
operation of buildings, large and small,
a study which he completed in 1939.
At the beginning of World War II
Mr. Hediger was called to an over-seas
naval air station where, in the capacity
of civilian engineer for the navy, he de-
voted his spare time teaching mathe-
matics and engineering subjects to offi-
cers and enlisted men. While engaged
in these duties, Mr. Hediger received
three letters of commendation from the
navy.
Since the cessation of hostilities, Mr.
Hediger has assumed duties as Principal
of the American Technical Institute in

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


by
EVERETT ELLIN, '48E
The big opportunities in industry to-
day are waiting for the ''personality
boys" with a well-grounded technical
background. Personnel directors and
employment squads are on the lookout
for the engineering graduate who has
shown that he knows how to work with
his fellowmen. Most of the students in
the technical schools today are laboring
under the false illusion that grades are
all that counts when it comes to making
that first big step in their industrial
career.
Your future boss wants to stock his
training program with graduates who
have evidenced an understanding of
men, and possess executive qualities ob-
tained through a good collegiate record
in extra-curricular activities. How long
is it going to take us before we realize
that our personality demands as much
attention in a college education as the
development of our mental faculties?
Just take a look around and see how
many of your fellow classmates set aside
their steam tables for a few hours dur-
ing the week and delve into campus af-
fairs. Pick up the Daily in the morning
and see if you can count more than two
or three engineers who are showing
some interest in what is going on outside
of the laboratory and the classroom.
We are dubbed by the rest of the

Everett Ellin
campus as a bunch of slide-rule-toting
introverts who spend their weekends
memorizing formulas. Well what are we
going to do about it?
The Engineering Council has grabbed
the bull by the horns and has introduced
a program designed to stimulate engi-
neering student interest in extra-cur-
ricular activities. It's a big job, but here's
how we plan to do it.
By offering a wide variety of projects,
affairs, and other activities designed to
appeal to every level of student interest

Helen Striho
John Cox
Everett Ellin Stanley Saulson
we hope to encourage the latent engi-
neer to give it a try. These activities,
which begin this month, will be scattered
at frequent intervals throughout the
year and will be scheduled for the engi-
neer during the after-class and early
evening hours. Once he gets the feel of
it perhaps he will be induced to continue
on his own inertia.
No doubt you are wondering what the
connection is between this Activities
Program and those yellow Class Mem-
bership and Activities Cards that set you
back one dollar during registration this
fall. The money collected from the dis-
tribution of those cards will be used to
finance this Activities Program, every
phase of which will be offered free of
charge to the 2600 engineers who hold
their Activities Cards. Every engineer,
however, will be encouraged to partici-
pate in the program.
Several projects are already under
way. An engineers' basketball team,
open to any engineer who is interested,
is now competing in the IM basketball
league. The "Councileers," who have
been supplied with jerseys through pro-
gram funds, are going great guns and
anyone interested in joining the team is
requested to contact T.eo Hollander,
manager, at 9443.
The officers of the freshman and
sophomore classes have sponsored
smokers for their classmates at the
Union. The members of Triangles, jun-
ior engineering honor society, are now
at work compiling a freshman informa-
tion booklet which will be distributed
free of charge every semester to the in-
coming class. Council funds and solici-
ted advertising will pay for its publica-
tion.
Part of the funds collected through
the sale of the Class Membership and
Activities Cards have been used to es-
tablish a working treasury for every
class in our college. The class of '48. for
example, will not be forced to collect
Senior Class dues from those seniors
who have purchased their Class Mem-
bership Cards, for the funds that they
contributed at that time have been used
to establish an adequate working treas-
ury for the class.
Approximately 90% of the seniors

Engineering Council
The Engineering Council made its
first post-war appearance by sponsoring
the Engineering Open House last
spring. A council committee, headed by
John Cox and John Morrison, coordi-
nated the efforts of the various engineer-
ing departments, societies, and clubs in
staging one of the most spectacular
events ever held on the Michigan cam-
pus. People from Ann Arbor and other
nearby cities toured the Engineering
College, West Physics, and Willow Run
airport in the largest Open House in
.Michigan history.
Council efforts were responsible for
"Jammin' in de Sun." the open air jam
session held at the Island last spring.
The session, under the direction of Ev
Ellin, featured musicians from Ann
Arbor and Detroit and proved to be one
of the most novel affairs of the 1947
term.
Early this fall, the Council teamed
with Tan Beta I'i to present King Cole's
Court, the first dance of the fall term.
The alTair marked the first appearance
of the King Cole Trio on the Michigan
campus and rang up the curtain on the
year's social season. Michigan's engi-
neers were well represented in the
throng of students and King Cole fans
who attended.
An Engineering Council election com-
mittee, headed by Hill Shelley, staged
the first all-Engineering College elec-
tion since 1943. The officers, who were
elected for each of the four classes, have
assumed control of their class duties and
are also serving as Council represent-
atives. R.E.H.
Sigma Rho Tau
Sigma Rho Tau, the Stump Speakers'
Society, began its activities for the
spring semester with a Smoker at which
Dean Ralph A. Sawyer spoke on "Ap-
plications of Atomic Energy." Although
somewhat restricted in his talk by se-
curity considerations. Dean Sawyer did
point out some of the comparisons be-
tween atomic energy plants and tradi-

tional steam power plants: known
supply of coal is ten times the known
supply of fissionable material; the cost
of a ten thousand kilowatt capacity
atom-powered plant would be about 30
per cent greater than a coal-powered
plant of equal capacity. According to
Dean Sawyer atom-powered plants are
not feasible at this time because of the
difficulties encountered in transferring
heat from the atomic pile to the heat
engine. Such plants are in existence, he
said, but are not efficient enough to com-
pete with traditional power plants. How-
ever, atom power might find use in
military aircraft or ships where effi-
ciency would not be a prime consid-
eration.
At the Smoker, the need for speaking
ability and the advantages of developing
more effective speech liefore leaving
college were emphasized. Also pointed
out was the opportunity Sigma Rho Tau
offers the engineer for practice and
improvement in the art and skill of
speaking. . .
At the second meeting of the semes-
ter, two members of Sigma Rho Tau
from the University of Toledo spoke
on the topics "AM versus FM" and
"Engineering Education."
AIEE-IRE
Two important questions were put
before EEs at the February 25th meet-
ing of AIEE-IRE. The first was,
"Should Engineers Unionize?" This
was the subject of a lively debate be-
tween a team from AIEE-IRE and one
from Sigma Rho Tau, Engineering
Stump Speaker's Society (several mem-
bers of the audience also had something
to say). A close decision went to the
affirmative.
The second momentous question con-
erned whether or not TAKE ONE is
the best EE department newspaper on
campus. The first issue of this paper,
put out by AIEE-IRE under the able
editorship of Jack Underwood, made its
initial appearance at this meeting. The
next morning the remaining copies were
made available to the second floor of
East Engine, with ice cream going to
the first sixty customers.
Within a day and a half, all issues
were gone. The editor attributes the tre-
mendous success of this venture to the
power of the editorial section, the excit-
ing list of job opportunities, the timely
and valuable EE news, the hilarious
gossip and humor section, and to the
fact that the paper was free. TAKE
ONE appears monthly or semi-monthly,
depending upon the whims of the staff,
and any EE who spies a pile of these in
the hall or at an AIEE-IRE meeting is
invited to TAKE ONE.
AICHE
The current series of talks on the
types of positions available to the chem-
ical engineer was continued at the March
4th meeting when Mr. Anthony An-
nable of the Dorr Co. spoke on "The
History of a Unique American Engineer-
ing Enterprise—The Dorr Company."
Several plant trips are scheduled for
March including a sulfuric acid plant
and the inevitable Good's brewery.
ASME
The American Society of Mechanical
Engineers launched the new semester
with the membership expanded to 292
engineers.
The first meeting found a large num-
ber of the members listening to Mr.
Thomas Kinkead speak on the topic of
Labor Relations. Mr. Kinkead, form-
erly of Ford Motor Company and
presently head of Industrial Relations
for the Central Specialty, division of
King Seely Corporation, built his dis-
cussion around questions gathered from
students several weeks before. The talk
was supplemented with a picture point-
ing out the basic problems of labor
relations.
The following Wednesday, approxi-
mately 200 engineers saw two very im-
pressive movies: "The Making and
Shaping of Steel" and "Steam Pro-
gress." The former movie gave an ex-
cellent background for those who took
the field trip to Great Lakes Steel
Company held by the ASME on the
3rd and 4th of March. Aside from
being very instructive, the field trips
afford the members the opportunity to
make valuable contacts with men in top
positions in industry.
This group is looking forward to the
most active semester in its postwar
history. Program, Field Trip, Publicity,
and Social Committees are hard at
work trying to give the members of
the ASME an interesting program.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


by
EDWARD A. CROVELLA, "49E
"Someday, soon, all of us will prob-
ably buy our beating and cooling outfits
as a single unit. We will install them and
forget them as we do our refrigerators,
our stoves, or our other common house-
hold appliances." These radically new-
devices—we may call them "heat
pumps"—will extract heat from the
earth or the air about us, concentrate it,
and then deliver it to the rooms of our
homes, factories or business places. In
addition, these same mechanical devices
that will be used to perform this minor
miracle will also cool and condition our
homes for summertime comfort.
The idea behind the method is still in
the discussion and experimental stage
(new information on the subject is be-
ing published in scientific and trade
magazines as it becomes available), but
the very newness of the heat pump is no
great handicap as might be seen after
the advantages are shown to outbalance
possible disadvantages.
Although the idea is new and the re-
sults quite startling, the principle on
which the heat pump operates is not
new. Carnot, Kelvin, Rankine and a host
of other scientists developed it over the
period of the last one hundred years and
the principle is in practical use today in
modern refrigeration; in fact, the heat
pump may be said to operate on a reverse
refrigeration cycle.
The well-known refrigeration cycle
depends upon, or rather, makes use of
two basic laws of thermodynamics—the
first that the evaporation of a liquid is
accompanied by a drop in temperature,
and the second that heat will flow of its
own accord only from a point of high to
one of low temperature, figuratively
downhill. Practically, a modern refrig-
erator is a device for circulating a vola-
tile liquid through a continuous cycle of
coils in which that liquid is constantly
changing state. By means of a pump,
pressure in the cooling coils is kept be-
low normal, and that in the condenser
coils above normal.
Under the influence of this lowered
pressure in the cooling coils, the refrig-
erant liquid (generally sulfur dioxide or
ethyl chloride) evaporates and the proc-
ess is accompanied by a substantial drop

Edward A. Crovella
in temperature. Then, in accord with the
second law, heat from the food storage
box flows "downhill" to this point of low
temperature. The liquid, now actually
in a gaseous state, next flows to the ra-
diator section outside the food storage
box where, almost literally, the heat is
pressed out of it by the compressor. It
is then ready to complete the cycle back
to the evaporator where it will receive
more heat for delivery to the radiator.
The heat pump will operate in the
same way. As its source or "bank" for
heat, comparable to the food storage box
of the refrigerator, it might take advan-
tage of the atmosphere, of the soil, or of
bodies of water such as wells, lakes, or
rivers. In the summer season such a
source will become, by reversing the
mechanism, the recipient of heat, and the
living room of the modern home will in
turn become the heat bank upon which
the pump may draw.
Let us consider these possible sources.
Soil, because of its high resistance to the
rapid flow of heat probably will not pro-
vide a convenient "bank" for the heat
pump. On the other hand, winter air
contains plenty of heat, the supply is in-
exhaustible, and at the same time it is
relatively low in resistance to heat flow,
but the engineer who plans to use it finds
that, as the temperature drops, he must
use larger machinery to make the trans-
formation ; so the more the house needs
the heat, the more it costs to deliver it.
In addition the need for handling huge
volumes of air introduces problems of
noise and vibration. The answer to this
is the use of ground water which has
four times as many thermal units per
pound as does air and takes up 800 times
less space.
So, the most ideal "bank" for the heat
pump, it may be concluded, is a small-
diameter well of 60 to 75 feet, at which
depth temperature remains fairly con-
stant throughout the year. Emory N.
Kemler shows that in Michigan, water
from wells at 30 to 60 feet of depth does
not vary much in temperature from a
normal 49°F. throughout the year.
The heat pump. then, might be de-
scribed as consisting of three relatively
inexpensive units in addition to the re-
frigeration device itself. Those units are
the well, a system to carry water from
the well to the heat pump and back again,
and the air-circulation system carrying
heat from the compressor of the heat
pump to the individual rooms.
Initial cost of such a system today
would be relatively high. Woodbury
says that a unit can be produced today
for $2,000 which will heat a ten-room
home efficiently. But that is only today's
figure. With the introduction of stand-
ardized design and skilled application of
quantity construction methods, the cost
might readily drop to the level of that of
a similar-capacity convection or steam-
heating system. Moreover, experimen-
tal models already produced have not
greatly exceeded the combined cost of
separate heating and air-conditioning
systems, both of which the heat pump
will displace.
One of the great advantages of the
heat pump over conventional systems
lies not in initial cost but in reduction of
operating expense. By eliminating all
need for purchase of coal, oil, gas, or
any type of fuel, a substantial economy
is effected. This saving in energy cost,
however, is inversely porportional to the
cost of electrical energy in any specific-
locality, for it must be admitted that the
system uses a sizeable amount of energy

new car production
Tlie "1948" model cars one sees on
the streets today were in the minds of
designers and engineers, perhaps, as
long as ten years ago. But hef ore an idea
can he transformed into an actual prod-
uct of metal or glass and rubber, an
enormous number of activities go on,
"behind the scenes," so to speak, in the
automotive companies. An "idea" car
devised before the war, for example,
may take eight years of planning before
it finally appears on the highway.
After the hasic engineering and de-
sign features of a new car have been
tentatively agreed upon, dies and new
production machines are ordered. Be-
fore final-part specifications are drawn
up and blueprinted, the designers and
engineers must have agreed definitely
on every last detail of the new product.
To the company executives goes the job
of setting a goal on yearly output of each
body style, a decision which requires the
anticipation of the amount of steel and
other vital materials the firm can expect
to receive for the next few years, and an
accurate evaluation of public taste for
various body models.
This long range estimate is then
broken down into expected daily pro-
duction schedules so the company can
ascertain approximately how many parts
per hour would be required to meet the
yearly goal. The tooling engineers must
then decide the most economical way to
obtain each individual part, whether to
make it within the company or to pur-
chase it finished or semi-finished. The
tooling engineers also decide what new
equipment is to be bought or is economi-
cally justifiable.
The planning department then begins
to set up a schedule of all items needed
and their time of delivery. When all
parts have been itemized, the purchasing
department begins the enormous task of
contacting some 5,000 parts suppliers all
over the country to obtain the correct
parts in the correct numbers. While this
activity is proceeding, the engine and
other parts of the new model are being
tested continually. Any defects or Haws
in the proposed model are corrected,
which entails more time and preparation
for the eventual full scale production.
It should be understood that while all
this planning activity is in progress, the
company is continuing to produce its old
model car. Usually late in the year, the
company shuts down temporarily to al-
low installation of the new dies, fixtures,
tools, and production machines. Old ma-
chines must be relocated, conveyor belts
lengthened or re-routed, workers indoc-
trinated with new assembly procedures,
and throughout the country authorized
dealers must prepare for the receipt of
the newer models.
Today, however, the companies face
an even graver problem than preparing
for model changes; namely, the rising
costs of production and the eventual re-
sults of high consumer costs. All large
concerns are constantly searching for
new manufacturing and material han-
dling practices which result in lower
production costs and consequently will
help prevent new car prices from rising
out of reach of the average car buyer.
Most firms are not so much concerned
with altering the large basic production
procedures, but rather with improving
already tried and proven practices.
Most automotive firms have technical
men constantly on the alert, looking for
means to cut costs on certain parts by
fractions of a cent. A saving of even a
few cents on a large-volume production
part will result in a very sizeable total
saving to the company which makes
hundreds of thousands of cars annually.
An example is the use of a new type
tungsten carbide tip turning tool which
has already revolutionized metal turning
procedure. A further example is the use
of a hammering machine to form a spe-
cial bolt which formerly required the use
of 14 screw-turning machines.
But more than improved production
techniques, engineers expect to find
most new cost-saving practices to arise
out of the material handling field. This
usually involves the use of more and
better conveying systems. The goal of
the men who study material handling
techniques is to reduce the walking and
lifting of materials by human labor to a
minimum, allowing for both increased
speed in production and the releasing of
workers for jobs which machines can-
not perform. In one large company, a
conveyor belt carrying hoods and fen-
ders flows past the assembly line, mak-
ing it possible for workmen to select the
proper color fender or hood from the
belt, rather than waiting for it or walk-
ing over to the paint booths to select it.
New uses are constantly being found
for scrap and discarded parts, in an ef-
fort to further reduce costs. For exam-
ple, small parts are often rotated in a
barrel together with specially built metal
slugs to remove burrs and burnish the

from the making of metal washers
would work as well and the special slugs
need no longer he produced or bought.
Although it would appear that im-
proved production techniques have not
resulted in any appreciable decline in
prices of new cars, that these prices have
not gone completely out of reach of the
average consumer is in part due to the
never-ending search for cost reducing
practices.
auto stabilizer
A war-born device now being tested
at the Westinghouse Laboratories is be-
ing hailed as the first major improve-
ment in vehicle suspension and shock-
absorber design in many years.
This device is a gyroscopically con-
trolled hydraulic stabilizer which was
originally developed to keep the guns of
Allied tanks trained on the enemy even
while the tanks were riding over rough
terrain. The stabilizer made its combat
debut on the battlefields of North Africa
and later saw action in many theatres of
operation.
At the conclusion of the war it was
suggested that the device could be ap-
plied to the suspension of automobiles,
buses, and railroad cars to improve the
riding qualities of these vehicles. This is
now being developed and has been im-
proved by the addition of a tilt regulator
which acts to bank the vehicle at the
proper angle regardless of speed.
Six power-driven hydraulic shock ab-
sorbers are used to stabilize the car body.
Four of these handle the vertical bumps
and two are used to correct for the side-
way thrust. A set of sensitive valves with
floating weights attached instantly de-
tect the slightest motion of the car body
and signal the absorbers to provide just
the right force to oppose the motion.
The tilt regulator consists of a pair of
electrically-driven screw jacks mounted
at diagonal ends of the vehicle which act
to tilt the whole body of the car when the
vehicle rounds a curve that is not cor-
rectly banked for the particular speed at
which the car is traveling. The mechan-
ism is controlled by a small pendulum
which "feels" gravity and centrifugal
force and moves inward or outward to
close electrical contacts. This sends a
signal to a motor-generator set that pro-
vides the power for a variable voltage
system, and the jacks are actuated to
tilt the car body to the correct back
angle.
In addition to improving passenger
comfort, it is claimed that the new stabi-
lizer will provide a solution to the prob-
lem of controlling the resonant frequen-
cies of car bodies in motion. The best
shock absorbers of conventional design
are capable of reducing the amplitude of
oscillation of a car body to three or four
times the size of the road bumps. The
new stabilizer brings this bounce down
to less than the road irregularities, an
improvement in ride-ability by a factor
of four to one.
Another advantage of the new sta-
bilizer is that it will permit higher speeds
with safety and comfort greatly exceed-
ing present standards on the nation's
railroads. This will be possible on pres-
ent roadbeds and will not necessitate any
both to the professional physicist and to
the layman.
The fundamental principle of the
method is simplicity itself: the disinte-
gration of an atom within a special pho-
tographic plate produces electrically
charged fragments which scatter from
the source of disintegration. Each frag-
ment affects the sensitive layer of the
plate in a manner analagous to an ex-
posure to light; the tracks of all charged
particles originating within the plate be-
come permanently preserved and, after
development, are observed as trails of
metallic silver.
Chief credit for the successful devel-
opment of the photographic method be-

Courtpsy W'esUnfhame
Centrifugal force of a car rounding a curve simulated in the laboratory
relaying of trackage, a cost which would
be prohibitive under present economic
conditions.
The hydraulic stabilizer will repre-
sent an economic advantage to rairoads
and truck and bus operators by enabling
them to meet faster schedules with pres-
ent type equipment. R. M.
nuclear photography
The common conception of the stage
of atomic investigation is that of a huge,
buzzing laboratory equipped with ma-
chines weighing hundreds of tons. That
a new method of nuclear research has
been developed which reduces this stage
of endeavor to the magnitude of a pho-
tographic plate should be of interest
longs to three sources: Dr. C. F. Powell
of the University of Bristol in England,
Dr. G. P. S. Occhialini, and the Ilford
Company which produced the special
plates required.
Drs. Powell and Occhialini have al-
ready performed a most important ex-
periment with this method. They ob-
tained records of about 3,000 individual
disintegrations by exposing their plates
to cosmic radiation. Although all have
not been fully interpreted, a number of
spectacular observations have already
been made, notable among these being
the most drastic case of disintegration
which has yet been seen. This was the
shattering of a silver atom into at least

thing from how his new Buick is holding
up to how the navy (i.e., part of the
navy) won the war—all directly related
to the subject material, of course.
His first noise in the world was made
on July 3, 1916. Although several cities
are competing for the honor. Centerville,
Michigan, where he attended grade
school and high school, is in first place
in claiming him as a native son. While
in high school he played basketball and
tennis. His main achievement, however,
was playing hot licks on the trumpet as
a member of the high school band. Cen-
terville High lost its driving force when
he bade farewell to the ivy-covered
portals in 1933.
After working for a year, young
Truckenmiller decided to enter the Uni-
versity of Michigan to study engineer-
ing. Immediately upon his entrance to
the University he tried out for the var-
sity team at the P-Bell with great suc-

W. C. Truckenmiller
cess. Applying himself diligently, he
was graduated in February, 1939 with
degrees in Chemical Engineering, Met-
allurgical Engineering, and the order of
P-Bell Tipplers.
Equipped with these qualifications,
he worked here as a student assistant in
the Engineering Research Dept.. and
found an outlet for his excess energies
by taking on a concommitant duty as
Bugle Instructor for the American Le-
gion. "Truck" finally accepted a posi-
tion as assistant plant metallurgist with
the A. C. Division of General Motors.
In two and a half years he rose to night
division superintendent of production.
While still employed at General Motors
he collaborated on a technical paper with
Dr. F. B. Rote and Professor W. P.
Wood, and after the paper was finished
he came to the University as an instruc-
tor in the Metal Processing Dept.
Not long after he received his Mas-
ter's Degree in 1944, he was plagued
with "itching feet," and being a man of
action, he joined the navy with the com-
mission of Ensign. After attending sev-
eral technical schools, his orders directed
him to Pearl Harbor to "Mine War-
fare Duty." Professor Truckenmiller
says he doesn't know yet what that
means. He was assigned to a tug, and
after chasing it to Okinawa and Tokio
Bay, he finally caught it at Wakahama.
But during his 'trucking' across the Pa-
cific in an LST, the war had ended.
Ensign Truckenmiller's men maintained
that the enemy navy must have sighted
him in the LST, searching furiously for
something and mistakenly concluded
that it was the object of his search. Pro-
fessor Truckenmiller implies nothing,
of course, but he points out that the war
ended soon after. The navy presented
him with his Certificate of Service in
July, 1946 which marked the termina-
tion of his active duty.
In the fall of 1946 he was promoted
to the rank of Assistant Professor.
Aside from full-time duties here at
the University, he teaches Extension
Courses in the Rackham Memorial
Building in Detroit. He is currently
working on several projects with the De-
partment of Engineering Research and
is also an industrial consultant for
several plants.
Professor Truckenmiller exemplifies
that rare educator who is able to deliver
his subject without imparting any ves-
tige of oratory or stuffiness. His out-
ward appearance in the classroom is that
of being relaxed and in sure control of
his subject matter. Thus it is no*extrav-
agance to hear him referred to as "one
of the boys." "Truck" is one of the most
promising young professors on the
campus. L.E.H.

The present political turmoil of the
Far East convinced Jack to alter his
original plans to return to China as a
civil engineer. Jack was born in Muk-
den, China in 1927 and spent the first
ten years of his life in that country.
Jack's primary education was begun
in British schools in the Far East and
was completed in New York City,
where he moved in 1936.
In 1943 Jack graduated from Taft
High School and was awarded member-
ship in a National High School Honor
Society. Events of this nature became
common with Jack, and during his days
at Michigan the name of Underwood
has been annexed to the roll of three
honor societies including Tau Beta Pi.
Jack has taken quite an interest in
television since serving in the navy's
radio technician program. Arranging
his schedule to make openings for
courses in television, Jack hopes to break
into this relatively new field through
technical work.

RCA Laboratories' "Chamber of Silence"—proving ground of tonal quality in radio and television instruments.
Ever hear SILENCE f
You walk into an eerie room. The door
swings shut and you're wrapped in a
silence so complete that it's an effort to
listen. Sound in this vault-like cavern is
reduced to the minimum of hearing.
But even silence has a sound of its own.
Faindy you hear a subdued hiss; sometimes
a soft hum. Scientists have suggested this
may be the "noise" of molecules hitting the
eardrums. Others wonder if it is caused by
the coursing of the body's blood stream.
When acoustic scientists at RCA Labora-
tories want to study the actual voice of an
instrument, they take it to this room. What
they hear then is the instrument itself—and
only the instrument. They get a true meas-
ure of performance.
Information gained here is part of such ad-
vances as: The "Golden Throat" tone system
found only in RCA Victor radios and Victrola
radio-phonographs . . . superb sound sys-
tems for television . . . the true-to-life quality

put). The upper frequency limit was at
that time determined by the equipment
available, but is now largely governed
by the fact that as frequency increases
the absorption by rain, fog, and gases in
the atmosphere increases.
Frequency modulation was employed
in this work due to its advantages for
circuits where multipath phenomena are
absent as well as because tuhes were
available which greatly minimized the
equipment necessary for producing a
f requency modulated carrier. Moreover,
F-M simplifies the problem of maintain-
ing overall circuit linearity. These ar-
guments are still sufficiently valid so
that all the major television radio relays
now in existence employ F-M.
In the RCA system referred to above,
television signals as broadcast from the
Empire State Building on 45.25 mega-
cycles were received at Hauppage on a

which employed a kinescope chain. This
chain simultaneously signal-checked the
over-all circuit performance with re-
spect to stability of synchronization, am-
plitude linearity, signal transients, pic-
ture definition and noise effects. Provi-
sions were made to reverse the polarity
of the video signal to obtain either a
white or black background, thus simu-
lating the extreme obtained with the av-
erage movie. The pattern contained a
wedge of half-tone steps between black
and white for linearity checks. The hori-
zontal and vertical line wedges showed
the picture definition, the presence of
transients, and at what frequency these
transients occurred.
With the carrier set at midband and
employing A.C. transmission with a
peak deviation from the carrier of two
megacycles, a picture definition of 375
lines was obtained with negligible tran-
sients. Synchronization and linearity

receiver whose video output was fed to
the 474-megacycle F-M terminal trans-
mitter. These signals were relayed to
Riverhead with good quality, a total dis-
tance of 70 miles from New York. The
overall gain of the repeater amplifier
was measured to he 80 db under actual
operating conditions.
Numerous tests were run on this sys-
tem, the final and most conclusive of
were entirely satisfactory. The RMS
signal to noise ratio was 31 db. It was
concluded that radio relaying of televi-
sion signals in the UHF spectrum above
400 megacycles had been successfully
accomplished and that a system of radio
relays would be technically adequate and
feasible for television program distri-
bution.
At about that time several other com-
panies, primarily General Electric and
Philco, established experimental radio
relay links. General Electric established
a two-jump television radio relay net-
work between New York and Schnec-
tady which it has been constantly experi-
menting with and improving ever since.
The network consists of a main hop
from the Empire State Building to a
pick-up station on Heldburg Mountain
outside Schnectady, a distance of ap-
proximately 130 miles, and from there
to a nearby broadcast transmitter. Phil-
co established and operated a two stage,
television radio relay system between
New York and Philadelphia. This re-
layed New York programs through the
booster station at Mount Rose, New
Jersey, to the Philco station. WPTZ, in
Philadelphia.
Progress in the experimentation with
television networks was greatly cur-
tailed during the War, but. in 1945, with
the assignment of new frequency bands
for the new 525-line television, Philco
opened a considerably more elaborate
network than those previously operated.
It consisted of four jumps of approxi-
mately 40 miles each between Washing-
ton, D. C. and Philadelphia.
In this network, a total of six trans-
mitters handle the television program as
it originates in Washington. Five of
these are rated at 40 watts each and op-
erate in the frequency channels of 204
to 216. or 230 to 242 megacycles. In
other words, transmitters at alternate
relay points operate on different chan-
nels so that received signals at any re-
lay point are not obscured by the trans-
mitted signals from the same relay sta-
tion. These 40-watt transmitters use a
lighthouse type tube in a transmission
line type of frequency controlled circuit.
The transmitters are housed, along
with other equipment, in automobile
type trailers which are located at the
base of 100-foot towers supporting
separate sending and receiving antenna
arrays. The sites of the towers were
chosen with the idea of having each lo-
cation in direct view of the relay point
on each side and giving a minimum ter-
rain clearance of 100 feet at any point
along the path. This clearance was nec-
essary to enable the use of frequencies
above 1,000 megacycles for future ex-
perimental work, without being troubled
with power absorption by objects along
the transmission path.

Du Pont chemists and engineers car-
ried this forward by devising a success-
ful commercial process for making 7-de-
hydrocholesterol and irradiating it to
vitamin D3. Several forms of vitamin D
are now manufactured by Du Pont,
ranging from oil and dry powder con-
centrates—used by the poultry trade
under the trademark "Delsterol"—to
vitamin D3 crystals of the highest
purity.
Today's chickens are healthier, and
the average annual egg yield over the
last eight years has increased from 134
to 159 per bird. To a considerable de-
gree, this is a result of the fifteen years
of research devoted by Du Pont scien-
tists to the development of "Delsterol"
"Deactivated animal sterol.
Questions College Men ask
about working with Du Pont

In 1922, it was shown that vitamin D
controls the utilization of calcium and
phosphorus in the body, especially in
the bones of growing animals. This led
to the discovery that leg weakness in
chicks.poorproduction.lowhatchability
of eggs, and other disturbances were
caused by a deficiency of this vitamin.
that year, Du Pont research men—who
had been studying the chemistry and
biochemistry of vitamin D for almost
four years—announced that the pro-
vitamin in animal cholesterol was not
ergosterol. They showed that the acti-
vated provitamin in cholesterol gave a
vitamin D much more effective for
chicks than that of irradiated ergos-
terol. This fact was based on many
comparative assays of irradiated choles-
terol, irradiated ergosterol, and irradi-
ated mixtures of these substances on
rats and chicks.

Scientists subsequently discovered
that vitamin D could be made by irradi-
ating plant or animal tissues with ultra-
violet light. This reaction has since been
shown to consist of transforming cer-
tain provitamins from the group known
as sterols, into vitamin D. The final re-
sult of these discoveries was the present
large-scale commercial production of the
vitamin by a series of complex chemical
and photo-chemical reactions which re-
quire careful control by chemists, bio-
chemists, physicists, and engineers. In
this development, Du Pont scientists
played an important part.
Ergosterol once the only source
For years before 1934 it was assumed
that ergosterol, a sterol first isolated
from vegetable sources, was the only
provitamin that yielded vitamin D. In

line power generating equipment is avil-
able at each point. At present the relay
operates in one direction only, from
Washington to Philadelphia. However,
equipment is available to make the net-
work two-way operating and this devel-
opment is expected in the near future.
Each relay point in the network consists
of receiving, monitoring, and transmit-
ting equipment and is operated by engi-
neers. This is done in order to permit
study of the actual operating conditions
rather than for a necessity of having an
"attended" relay station.
In this Philco system the picked-up
signal is amplified and demodulated
down to video frequency. The video fre-
quencies are then used to modulate the
transmitter. This differs from the Gen-
eral Electric, Schnectady-to-New York
relay in which the amplified signal, as
picked up by the receiver, is kept at an
R-F level and is then amplified by linear
amplifiers and the modulation never rec-
tified down to video frequency except
for monitoring purposes. The Philco

fore making it easy to inject video mod-

At the first relay point at Arlington,
additional testing equipment is used in
the form of a monoscope. This can be
used to inject a signal into the relay sys-
tem for transmission along the circuits
to Philadelphia, where it can be analyzed
and studied. Complete signal generating
equipment in the form of scanning and
blanking generators are also housed
there. The antenna system consists of
24 dipoles in a reflector-radiator combi-
nation. When used with the 40-vvatt
transmitter, the over all reliability is
quite high. The whole system permits
comparison of engineering data at each
of the points along the route. The re-
sults of the relay system from an engi-
neering standpoint were considered
quite satisfactory. Signal strength was
adequate to give reliable pictures over
the entire circuit.
By the beginning of 1947, Philco an-
nounced that it had completed and tested
a new radio relay system suitable for the
transmission of black and white tele-
vision signals. The present equipment
in this relay operates in the 1350-mega-
cycle band. Wide band F-M equipment
handles the video signals. This equip-
ment is equally useful as an inter-city
multiple link or for studio to transmitter
work. Heterodyne modulation and re-
inodulation is employed in this system.

Here's an example of research that led to the engi-
neering development of a new factory process.
The properties of a finished bar of soap depend on the
polymorphic form or forms in which the soap molecules
have crystallized. For instance, the comparison of the
x-ray diffraction powder diagrams to the left illustrates
that one soap can be prepared in at least four different
polymorphic forms or phases. These different forms vary
in physical properties such as plasticity, rate of solution in
water, and ease of lathering.
Thus, to make a bar of soap with desirable properties,
it is necessary to control both the phase composition and
the chemical composition of the final product.
Research findings of this kind at Procter &amp; Gamble
are translated into designs for large-scale factory proc-
esses. The picture at the right shows a new type of factory
process in which conditions are controlled to produce bars
of soap of the desired crystalline form or phase.
Design, development and construction of this me-
chanical equipment called for close cooperation between
chemists and engineers—scientific teamwork that sets a
pattern for progress.

PROBLEM—You are designing a cabinet-type oil
heater. The oil and air metering valve has to be
placed at the bottom. You now want to provide a
manual control for the valve located on the cabinet
front where it is easy to see and to operate. How
would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—Use an S.S.White remote
control flexible shaft to connect the dial to the valve
or to a rod running to the valve. The latter method
was used in the heater illustrated below. The flexible
shaft will provide smooth, sensitive control and will
allow you to put the dial anywhere you want it.
This is just one of hun-
dreds of power drive and
remote control problems
to which S.S.White flex-
ible shafts are the simple
answer. That's why every

The signal to noise ratio is approximately 70 db.
This system, which is used for experimental purposes only,
has supplied valuable information to the field of microwave
television networks. It was found, for example, that in the
presence of multipath signals, with signal levels below normal,
unique patterns resembling grained wood patterns may be ob-
served. In these patterns, the change of picture shading due to
the echo will be related to the frequency shift of the carrier
during the time interval equal to the difference in the propaga-
tion time over the two signal paths. The change of shading is
most pronounced following a sharp signal change in the pic-
ture pattern. Under normal operating conditions, but in the
presence of an echo signal of approximately five percent of the
strength of the principal signal, essentially complete suppres-
sion of the echo is achieved and performance is superior to that
of an A-M system under equivalent conditions.
Also, in the beginning of 1947, the Bell System started con-
struction on a television radio relay between New York and
Boston. This system, now completed, operates in the 4,000
megacycle range and uses seven intermediate repeater stations.
Finally, RCA has recently announced that television radio
relay equipment designed for operation between 6800 and 7050
megacycles is now in quantity production. This equipment is
being produced in RCA's Camden plant and includes all the
units required for a complete point-to-point installation. The
first set of this equipment has been delivered to NBC in New
York and is now in operation. Additional equipment will be
completed in sufficient numbers to supply all the television
broadcasting stations now under construction.
This new RCA link differs from the previous television re-
lays in these important respects. First, it uses war-developed
reflex-klystron circuits in both the transmitter and receiver.
This makes possible equipment which is small in size and rela-
tively light, so that it is suitable for mobile as well as fixed use
Second, it operates on higher frequencies than have previously
been used for this service; thereby making possible higher gain
antennas with consequent improvement of the signal-to-noise
ratio. Third, it is not experimental one-of-a-kind equipment,
made for the manufacturer's own use, but rather a production
design of units run off from a factory assembly line set up to
turn out identical units in quantity.
This television radio relay link was designed about three
years ago, and has undergone exhaustive tests before being put
into mass production. These tests have shown that the use of
two of these links in series, so to speak, did not result in any de-
gradation of the picture, and that such multiple use is entirely
practical. It was also shown that these links are capable of trans-
mitting a satisfactory color television picture. It has already
been used with great success by NBC for field pick-ups. It was
this equipment that was used in relaying the University of
Michigan football games from the stadium in Ann Arbor to the
transmitter in Detroit. On the basis of tests, this equipment is
rated very satisfactory for line-of-sight distances up to 15 or
20 miles. During a test over a 25 mile hop from Freeport, Long

Island to Radio City in New York, some
noise was introduced by the relay link,
but it was considered to be less than that
introduced by the television cameras
themselves.
Television Cable Networks
In the cable networks system for tele-
vision, Hell has been the major and per-,
haps the sole competitor. In 1927, tele-
vision transmission was demonstrated
between Washington, D. C. and New
York City, a distance of 225 miles, using
a 20-kilocycle band over an open wire
line. In 1937, there was a similar dem-
onstration between New York and Phil-
adelphia, using a one-megacycle band
over an experimental coaxial cable
which was looped to provide a total cir-
cuit length of 180 miles.
Many other tests and demonstrations
were subsequently carried out. In 1945
and 1946. techniques for handling tele-
vision pick-ups, paralleling in many re-
spects the methods used in the sound
program transmission field, were suffi-
ciently advanced to be demonstrated on
numerous occasions. Experimental tele-
vision transmission over coaxial cables
by several broadcasters is now continu-
ing on a regular schedule. In 1946, color
(Continued from page 26)
television was sent over a coaxial cable
from New York to Washington and
back.
In its experimental work with coaxial
cables for television, the Bell System
made several important contributions to
the study of transmission of television
programs. It was determined that the
principal technical characteristics affect-
ing the transmission of video signals are
frequency band width, echoes and phase
deviation, noise modulation, and cross-
talk. The band width of a given televi-
sion transmission circuit influences the
definition attainable with a particular
rate and method of scanning. Reflections
from objects in a radio path and from
impedance irregularities in a wire plant,
which cause deviations in the phase-fre-
quency characteristics of the circuit,
produced ghosts in the television pic-
tures.
Phase deviations resulting from
causes other than reflections, such as im-
perfect equalization, give the same sort
of picture ghosts. Reflections may be
greater in one part of the band than in
another; thus a high frequency echo
might produce a complete ghost of a thin
vertical line, such as a flag pole, while
the ghost of a wider object would show
only at its edge. Very short delay echoes
produce picture ghosts so slightly dis-
placed that they merely blur the edges of
sharp discontinuities in the picture.
Long delay echoes, on the other hand,
cause discrete images displaced from the
principal image. These effects can l&gt;e
minimized by the introduction of delay
equalizers at amplifier points.
Systematic noise resulting from har-
monics of the power frequency produce
objectionable patterns on the picture.
Resistance noise produces a general f uz-
ziness and boiling effects. While raising
the level of the signals can reduce the
effects of the noise, this tends to increase
modulation of the amplifier. This modu-
lation usually produces spurious pat-
terns, appearing as sharp demarcations
in brightness over the televised scene.
Crosstalk from another television sys-
tem produces a type of interference
which shimmers, or it can result in the
superposition of a weak copy of the pic-
ture from the interfering system. Spe-
cial attention is required in design, oper-
ation and layout facilities to provide
adequate band width for good picture

No ... there never was a valve this
big. But if all valves in this
refinery were one valve, this picture
would be no great exaggeration.
Today, with wages and material
costs the highest ever, it pays
management to think about valves
collectively, and keep the same
sharp eye on valve maintenance
costs that they do on large unit
maintenance.
EXCESSIVE MAINTENANCE of One
valve is insignificant, but multiplied

by thousands, it is a serious drain
on operating budgets.
Jenkins bros. helps management
meet this problem. First, by build-
ing extra endurance into Jenkins
Valves, making them the longest-
lasting, lowest-upkeep valves that
money can buy. Second, with advice
from Jenkins Engineers
on any question of
proper selection, instal-
lation, or maintenance.
That's why, for new
installations or replacements, alert
management relies on Jenkins qual-
ity and engineering for lowest valve
costs in the long run. Sold through
leading Industrial Distributors.

minimize crosstalk. Transmission losses
can be minimized by the use of polyethy-
lene insulation in both shielded pair and
coaxial television cables.
But progress has not been limited to
experimentation. In 1947 the Bell Sys-
tem announced that video cable facili-
ties now available, or to be completed by
1950, include a 12,000-mile nationwide
system using coaxial cables and local
networks employing shielded pair cables.
Prices or "common carrier" television
network service were also announced.
Thus we see that, along with the other
elements of television broadcasting, the
idea of networks has advanced a long
way, particularly since the end of the
war. Television networks, although
still being extensively experimented
with, are becoming operating realities.
Whether the radio relay or cable type of
television network will finally be gener-
ally accepted is still not clear. Most en-
gineers tend to believe that a combina-
tion of both will be used for some years
to come.
The public has already been given a
taste of network television program-
ming at such events as the Louis-Conn

fight, the opening of the Lincoln papers
and the Theater Guild productions.
These broadcasts were seen simultane-
ously in New York, Philadelphia and
Washington. Both cable and radio re-
lay links were used. Several networks
between these three cities are now in
constant operation, providing for more
expensive and entertaining program-
ming in that area.
What is in the future for television
networks ? In general, it is expected that
the trend to wider frequency bands will
continue. These will be needed for
greater definition or color television.
These wider bandwidths are being ex-
perimented with at the present time. The
Bell System is working on a seven-
megacycle coaxial cable. RCA and Phil-
co are working on comparable facilities
in the radio relay field. Still further in
the future is the possibility of using long
wave guides which are merely hollow
tubes without central conductors and
which provide transmission paths for
enormously wider bands sealed away
from interference of all sorts.
It is quite clear that the future holds
promise for advances far beyond the
present status. The importance of this
work was emphasized recently when,
during the first public telecast over a
new network in the East, Federal Com-
munications Chairman Paul A. Porter
said, "The opening of this new multiple
relay is an example of the vigor with
which the problems of television are be-
ing attacked. The creation of networks
is the heart of the problem of how to ex-
pand television into a nationwide serv-
ice."

Just plain Salt! But what wonders
it performs in the hands of expert
chemists and engineers. Its two
components play a big part in the
production of paper, soap, glue,
metals, metal products, textiles,
insecticides. They help to sanitize
water, launder clothing, kill
bacteria in dairies, restaurants,
food plants.
"Miracle-working" with Salt—as
well as other basic chemicals—
has been Pennsalt's business for
98 years. Starting with a modest
plant at Natrona, Pa., Pennsalt
has steadily grown, until today it
stands as j.^.e of America's impor-
tant chemical companies.
Big ? Yes . . . but not so big as to
swallow up its promising young
men. Old? Yes . . . but not too
old to adopt young ideas that are
sound. Pennsalt was founded by a
young man; and grew large through
the efforts of young men.
The future, too, looks bright for
Pennsalt . . . and for the young
men who are going to build it.

through the purchase of their class mem-
bership cards—quite a record. These
seniors, in addition to having paid their
class dues in full, can also take advan-
tage of the Activities Program. In ad-
dition to an assured graduation treasury,
each class now has funds which may be
used to finance class smokers, to be spon-
sored by the class officers, similar to the
ones that were staged by the freshman
and sophomore classes last month. Such
mixers create unity and class spirit
which have been sadly lacking on our
campus for many years.
The responsibility for the planning
and presentation of the various phases
of the Activities Program will lie in the
hands of the 21 student organizations
and the four groups of class officers in
the Engineering College, each of which
will undertake the sponsorship of at
least one project during the year.
Forty delegates, representing every
one of the student groups, drew up plans
for coordinating the activities of the stu-
dent societies in the organization of the
program at a recent Student Congress
called by the Engineering Council. The
Congress, the first of its kind ever held
ENGINEERING COUNCIL
(Continued from page 13)
in the Engineering College, was the
scene of the finest spirit of cooperation
that has been voiced in our school since
the pre-war days.
It was decided by the Congress that
some form of student offices would be
necessary as a headquarters, not only for
the presentation of the Activities Pro-
gram, but for the general use of all the
engineering student societies. A com-
mittee is now at work locating space for
the headquarters.
The delegates to the Congress placed
their seal of approval on an official stu-
dent resolution which will be presented
to the faculty executive committee in the
form of a petition requesting the official
re-adoption of the Honor System for all
classes above the freshman level. A
schedule for society meeting dates was
drawn up, and plans were outlined for
securing better publicity for the engi-
neering student activities in the Michi-
gan Daily. Plans were also discussed for
a project that would result in a published
clarification of the elective system in our
College. Tan Beta Pi has since taken on
the responsibility for this project. Pre-
liminary ideas were also presented for
the organization of a complaint commit-
tee set up within the Council for the
purpose of hearing student gripes and
passing them on to the proper authori-
ties.
The assemblage was given a sneak
preview of a trophy which will be
awarded by the Engineering Council
every spring to the student society which
has done the most toward furthering
student interest in extra-curricular ac-
tivities during the academic year. At this
time, a number of societies were cited
for the work they have already done.
Included in the list were: Tau Beta Pi,
Triangles, ASME, AIEE &amp; IRE, and
Sigma Rho Tau. The meeting was con-
cluded with a resolution for a subse-
quent gathering to be held three weeks
hence for the purpose of carrying on the
work that was begun at the initial Con-
gress.
The feeling of cooperation that per-
meated the first Engineering Student
Congress shows great promise of devel-
oping an organization that will work-
effectively toward molding a well-
rounded engineering graduate, better
equipped to assume full responsibility of
his role of ever-increasing importance
in industry today.

in pumping water and in compressing
and expanding the refrigerant.
In a wartime experiment in subter-
ranean rooms used for storing art treas-
ures in England a drop in heating cost
from $6,920 for 1944 to $3,720 for 1945
was reported. These figures could not
logically he used as a criterion for the
operating cost, for instance, of a small
unit somewhere in the United States.
However, they are illustrative of what
is possible when electric power rates are
low relative to the price of fuel.
Though you receive three to five units
of energy from nature to the one you
buy in electricity, the cost is high in
places where power rates are up. At
present the heat pump can compete with
the fuel burning furance for small
homes as soon as an electric rate of two
cents per kilowatt-hour becomes more
prevalent. Dropping the price to one cent
per kwhr, which is quite possible, would
leave no question as to comparative
costs.
With the disappearance of the cost of
fuel will be associated the disappearance
of the nuisance of handling that fuel.
Architectural form will change with the
elimination of chimneys from our
homes. The need for frequent interior
redecoration due to soot and smoke will
vanish. The unsightly coal-bin as well as
ash-collection drudgery will be a thing
of the past, and the heating plant may be
contained in a room almost as spotless
as any housewife's kitchen.
Not, by any means, the least of the ad-
vantages to be gained by widespread de-
velopment and acceptance of such a sys-
tem would be the general improvement
in health associated with the elimination
of soot and smoke.
Use of the system for air-condition-
ing would also favor better health while
making the summer months in humid
climates more liveable.
Of the many advantages of the heat
pump as compared with conventional
heating, then, we may list at least four
which make it imperative that research
and engineering knowledge be applied to
the problem today: reduction in energy
costs, elimination of the fuel nuisance,
automatic provision for air-condition-
ing, and resulting health benefits. Fi-
nally, application of mass production
and good design principles would re-
duce the cost of the system to a level
where it could be enjoyed by practically
everyone.

examples of disintegration have been
found attributable to the impact of
mesons, particles which are suspected of
playing a most essential part in holding
the nucleus of the atom together.
These observations by the photo-
graphic emulsion technique are in fact
a preview of startling disintegrations
which will be observed when new high-
energy particle accelerators are built. To
date, the natural intensity of cosmic ra-
diation exceeds anything of a similar na-
ture yet produced in the laboratory, and
it is in the exploitation of cosmic radi-
ation as a weapon in research that this
new technique is most clearly proving
its worth.
Although the possibility of the use of
photographic plates as a laboratory was
recognized at an early stage in nuclear
research (they were used to a limited ex-
tent for 15 years) the method was left
undeveloped mainly because the Wilson
cloud chamber method had already been
established. The new method reduces
considerably the expenditure in time and
control equipment.
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued from page 17)
One principle drawback first encoun-
tered was the fact that the emulsion of
a photographic plate shrinks very ap-
preciably in processing—as much as 43
per cent in the case of the special plates.
Dr. Powell's greatest achievement was
the development of a method of measur-
ing photographic particle tracks accu-
rately in spite of this shrinkage.
Another restriction to the application
of the plate method was also removed by
Dr. Powell. The emulsion of a photo-
graphic plate normally contains a num-
ber of chemical elements, notably silver
and bromine, and among others, carbon,
nitrogen, and oxygen. If nuclear disin-
tegrations were confined to this com-
paratively small list, the method would
be limited in its application. Dr. Powell
developed methods of introducing into
the emulsion almost any other chemical
element which he wanted for his disin-
tegration experiments.
The photographic record of a nuclear
disintegration is a star-shaped explosion
within the plate with the tracks of the
resulting particles scattering in a variety
of directions. Some leave the plate be-
fore their course is completed and others
come to rest within the emulsion so that
their ranges can be measured. Generally
speaking, the kind of particle can be de-
duced from the appearance of its track.
The energy of the particle is calculated
from its range.
The photographic method of record-
ing nuclear disintegrations provides
complete visual evidence for the study of
new types of disintegration: this is an
essential requirement if confusion in in-
terpreting entirely new atomic transmu-
tations is to be avoided.

QUIZ ON HIGH SPEED STEELS
Q. How long have molybdenum high speed steels
been used successfully?
A. For about 15 years.
Q. Why are molybdenum high speed steels pre-
ferred to 18-4-1 by many large consumers of
tool steels?
A. They're tougher. Do a better job for less money.
They're from lOtf to 20# a pound cheaper. In
addition, the molybdenum steels have from
6% to 9% lower density, so if you make your
own tools, you get more tools for a given gross
weight.*
Q. Where are users finding molybdenum high
speed tool steels superior?
A. In twist drills. In hacksaw blades. In milling,
slotting, and slitting saws. In taps, chasers,
broaches, reamers, hobs, milling cutters, lathe
and planer tools. Can be used for all classes of
high speed tools with good results.
Q. Is there any special trick needed in heat treat-
ing molybdenum high speed tool steels?
A. No. In modern furnaces, molybdenum high
speed tool steels are as easy to harden
properly as 18-4-1. And they cost much less—
and save money on the job.
*Our booklet on molybdenum high speed steels will give you
proof of these statements. Write for it.

the world's most widely used abrasive

IN these unique, arc-type furnaces at the Norton electric
furnace plant near Niagara Falls is produced ALUNDUM
abrasive—fused at 3700° F.from the mineral,bauxite.
Introduced to industry by Norton in 1901 this first electric-
furnace-made aluminum oxide abrasive revolutionized
the grinding of steels because of its combination of hard-
ness, sharpness and toughness.
Subsequent Norton developments were designated as
38 ALUNDUM and 57 ALUNDUM—and then in 1946
came the sensational 32 ALUNDUM abrasive.
Today ALUNDUM abrasive in its various forms
is the world's most widely used abrasive.

the substructure and the timber bents,
the original roadway was cut through in
three places and the new timber supports
were carried to the arch members of the
submerged bridge.
During the first week of operations
the work proceeded slowly because of
the necessity of trucking supplies in
from the nearby town of Wecker, but
soon the railroad to Mainz was reopened
and, following this development, work
continued rapidly.
The bridge was constructed so as to
make the maximum possible use of the
demolished German bridge. The bents
on either end of the new spans were
anchored at the ends of the submerged
arches and the timber bents supporting
the centers of the new spans were sup-
ported by the floor l)eams of the de-
stroyed bridge. The bridge was con-
structed with 18 spans: the 17 timber
piers placed atop the bents were sup-
ports for the 20-inch I-beams,the latter
used as the stringers. Twenty inch,
American Standard I's were used ex-
clusively except for the center span,
where 27-inch I-beams were utilized for
the stringers. The spans varied in length
from 35 to 55 feet.
The most complex system of bracing
and reinforcement ever devised for use
on a military structure was employed on
the Mainz Bridge. Cross-bracing was
used on the piers and between the bents.
Three-quarter inch cable was used as
bracing, both between the piers and in
the piers themselves. In addition, a con-
tinuous beam the length of the entire
bridge was constructed of 20-inch T-
beams and installed longitudinally at the
junction of the top and bottom of each
double-story bent on the outside edge.
In short, every possible strengthening
device was employed in an effort to off-
set the uncertainty caused by lack of
sufficient time for a complete analysis of
the structure.
The finished bridge, both in magni-
tude and in time of completion, was and
is a tribute to the men who constructed
it. It stands 52 feet above the water line,
and is 1100 feet long and 50 feet wide,
containing 18 spans. It was finished un-
der tactical conditions in the remarkable
time of 17 days. The fact that all the ad-
vanced equipment on hand was made
available to the men who worked on the
bridge does not detract in any way from
the monumental task they completed in
so short a time.

all will probably be young men like yourselves,
for here at Whiting you can see facilities so
modern in every respect that they are likely to
serve as a model for similar industrial develop-
ments for many years to come.
It may well be that you will spend part of your
professional career in surroundings patterned
after these well-planned new buildings at
Whiting. In any case, you cannot fail to find
the new Standard Oil laboratory a present ac-
complishment and a promise for the future.
Here is one of the places where the world of
tomorrow will be shaped by the skill of men
trained, as you are, to the exacting, rewarding
tasks of scientific research.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The Mathematics Department of the University of Michigan offers in the
College of Engineering an integrated program of study in applied mathe-
matics and specialized topics in engineering. The purpose of this program
is to satisfy the increasing demands of engineering industries and technical
schools for personnel with a training in mathematics and mechanics more
advanced than that normally obtained in the more specialized engineering
curriculums.
The list of courses in applied mathematics, which is offered to both un-
dergraduate and graduate students, is quite extensive. It includes courses
in Advanced Calculus, Statics and Dynamics, Modern Operational Mathe-
matics, Fourier Series and their Applications, Functions of a Complex Vari-
able and their Applications, Quality Control, Statistics, Heat Conduction and
Diffusion, Vector Analysis, Potential Theory, the Mathematical Theory of Elas-
ticity, Hydrodynamics, Topics in Mathematical Physics, Ordinary and Partial
Differential Equations, and Tensor Analysis.
Formal course work in the more advanced fields of applied mathematics
is supplemented by seminars. In these seminars both faculty and students
participate informally in a study of special problems.

FINAL EXAMINATIONS
As we see it, the principal reasons
for the existence of final examina-
tions today are:
1—precedent
2—a review of the term's work
3—a means of evaluating the suc-
cess of the student and the teacher.
PRECEDENT
From the fact that there has al-
ways been the final examination, it
could he fallaciously contended that
that is the valid reason for its con-
tinued existence—" . . . otherwise,
why would it have been continued
for so long . . . ?" To explain the
erroneous reasoning involved here
borders on the trite; it suffices
merely to remark that we appreciate
all that has been created and handed
down to us because precedent was
by-passed and investigation substi-
tuted in its place.
REVIEW
The final examination, in too
many cases, has come to be viewed
—both by educators and students—
as the ultimate objective of a course.
As such, it is an artificial stimulus
for the learning process. Thus, what
in theory should provide an incen-
tive for a thorough review, deter-
iorates to a situation of sleepless
nights of cramming. Furthermore,
experience teaches a student to
master not ony broad concepts, but
to memorize a mass of material
which, depending on the whims of
an instructor, the latter might deem
important enough to include on the
examination. A great portion of the
necessity for cramming is supplied
by
DAVID STEIN
to the student; and it is common
knowledge that that material which
is studied under conditions of
mental duress and physical fatigue
is not long retained.
THE FINAL EXAMINATION
The final examination is the club
which forces the student to attempt
a retention of textbook material plus
page after page of notes, upon whose
most important sections he has al-
ready been examined. As we see it,
the regular examinations during the
semester achieve all the purported
objectives of the final examination.
EVALUATION
A further cause for the cramming
process described above is to be
found in the ridiculously magnified
importance placed upon the results
of the final examination by the edu-
cators. When presumably the same
material handled in class and done
for homework is given during a
"very important" three hour exami-
nation, then the penalization (and
more important, the results of the
penalization) assumes in some man-
ner a very great importance. In the
evaluation of the final examination,
it is the student who bears the brunt
(entirely) of the consequences. We
wonder how much of a student's rec-
ord, which he must present to a pros-
pective employer, indicates an evalu-
ation of the student's work through-
out an entire term, and how much is
an evaluation of final examination
results.
The subject of evaluation is more
a subject of the marking system, a
topic which we wish to avoid in these
lines l&gt;ecause we have not set out
here to discuss this facet of the edu-
cational system. We believe that the
final examination (coupled with the
marking system) serves more as a
convenience for educators than as a
tool for the benefit of students.
CONCLUSION
On all three bases, the justification
for the existence of the present sys-
tem of final examinations seems to
reveal a basically unsound structure.
We suggest that a serious study be
made to produce a means of accom-
plishing all (or most) of the basic
aims of a final examination without
perpetuating the weaknesses of the
present system.
Until this could be done, we be-
lieve that the two weeks period set
aside for examinations could be used
to greater advantage by both stu-
dents and teachers as a period de-
voted solely to review in the class-
room. Ample time would be provided
to go over the term's work, for the
important items to be reviewed and
discussed, and for questions to be
answered. Surely this would serve
as a more adequate review! As for
evaluation—the teacher should have
sufficient evidence in the form of ex-
aminations given throughout the
term covering units of course mate-
rial to determine how much a stu-
dent understands, and how success-
fully the teacher has done his job.

... a great name in research with a big future in CHEMISTRY
PLASTICS-INFANT INDUSTRY
THAT GREW UP FAST
Ten years ago the infant plastics indus-
try was teething. It has since rushed
through a precocious childhood and
grown to a vigorous and impressive ma-
turity. Today the plastics industry is
a multimillion-dollar business. Two-
thirds of all American factories use
plastics materials in their manufactur-
ing operations.
Of course, plastics were not new ten
years ago. In fact, back in 1894 General
Electric was making lamp carbons out
of an early plastic—lampblack-impreg-
nated potter's clay.
New Materials Encourage Growth
But the rapid growth of the plastics
industry came in the late 1980's when
new materials and improved molding

California's new betatron atom-smasher.
techniques encouraged its expansion.
Then, with World War II, plastics manu-
facturing accelerated tremendously.
General Electric's position in the
plastics field is unique in that G. E. is
the world's largest manufacturer of
finished plastics products and also a
manufacturer of molding powders.
General Electric offers a complete
plastics service. It has facilities for de-
veloping special com-
pounds and for design-
ing, engineering, and
molding plastics prod-
ucts to meet individual
customers' requirements.
The variety of parts
and products turned out
by General Electric's Plastics Division
is startling—and it illustrates the diver-
sity of applications that are being found
for plastics in the postwar world.
For Rowboats and Radios
Take, for example, the plastics dinghy.
This is a four-passenger boat molded of
laminated plastics by General Electric
for a New England boat manufacturer.
Then there is the synchrotron ring for

the University of California's new
betatron atom-smasher. It's the largest
single part ever molded by G. E. Less
spectacular, perhaps, but still impor-
tant, are the hundreds of more familiar
plastics products like clock cases, com-
pacts, radio cabinets, camera cases, pack-
ages of all sorts, Textolite surfacing
material, plastics parts for automobiles,
refrigerators, and other appliances-
even plastics cups for milking machines.
Since 1920, General Electric has man-
ufactured molding powders for its own
use. Recently, a synthetic phenol plant
was completed in Pittsfield. As a result
of this increased production capacity.
G. E. can now provide high quality
phenolic compounds to other molders.

ing fractionating towers on distillation building.
General Electric's plastics activities are
just one phase of the operations of the
Chemical Department, where research
is opening new doors to progress. In the
fascinating new field of silicone chem-
istry, in resins, in insulating varnishes,
in permanent magnets, General Electric
is making contributions to chemical
knowledge. For more information on
any of these activities, write Chemical
Department, General Electric Company,

A message to students of chemistry from
DR. J. J. PYLE
Director, General Electric Plastics Laboratory
The field of plastics is surely a stimulating one—and one that
offers many opportunities and the utmost in challenge to
graduate chemists and chemical engineers. At General Elec-
tric, plastics research is presenting new possibilities in this
fascinating field that should prove exceptionally interesting
to young technical men.

gin to open. A door through
which astronomers will be able to see
6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 miles in-

the giant telescope atop Mt. Palomar, so
powerful that the canals of Mars, il there are
any, will for the first time be photographed.
It all began 12 years ago when Corning
cast the glass for the famous 200" telescope
mirror—the world's largest piece of glass—-
after most experts said it couldn't be done.
For this big disc Corning scientists de-
veloped a special glass — the only practical
material that would insure the permanence,
stability and accuracy demanded by the
telescope's designers. This glass is similar
to that used for Pyrex ware and Pyrex in-
dustrial glass piping. Making the disc was
a job Corning took in its stride, because it
is accustomed to finding practical solutions
to all kinds of glass problems. Its research
laboratory has contributed to the develop-
ment of more than 37,000 different items,
ranging from simple custard cups to tele-

and Steuben artware.

The photograph shows a Swenson cast-iron, rotary-drum filter. It has a
drum of 2' x 1' and will filter from one to two tons of salt per hour. This
filter is used in a study of the basic relationships of filtration and also for
testing slurries as a service to clients. In the past, it has been necessary
to design these filters empirically from previous experience and simple
experimental tests because of the lack of any fundamental theory for the
complex phenomena of "unsteady" state, two-phase flow occurring in
these filters. However, as a result of this research program, theoretical
relationships have been established that now permit analysis of the
problems in filtration.

truck loader
A one-man mechanism for loading
trucks has recently been developed in Port-
land, Maine. The trucks in backing up to
a stockpile roll on a set of treads which
operate a lever device to raise a ]/4 cu. yd.
bucket to the dumping position.

One man truck loader
All that has to be installed in the truck
is a hitch, that can be attached in approx-
imately 8 hours. Once this modification has
been made the truck driver backs his ve-
hicle onto the loader, pulls a lever in the
cab and drives away without ever leaving
the driving compartment of the truck.

stud-type jackbit
A new stud-type jackbit for rock drill-
ing has recently been developed. The
bit features wing curves that enable it to
retain new bit proportions through many
sharpenings. The resulting small gage-
loss permits using successive bits with
reductions in diameter of 1/16-inch or
less per change. It is claimed that this
makes it possible to start holes with small-
er bits than those previously used and
still-bottom them at the same size as
before.
heavy duty diesel
A new heavy duty diesel motor has been
developed by the International Harvester
Company. At 1375 r.p.m., 191 horsepower
are developed. Equipped with radiator,
fan, clutch and power takeoff, 180 horse-
power are developed at 1375 r.p.m.
The engine has a twin-plunger fuel in-
jection pump and combustion chamber.
Exhaust and intake manifolds provide free
flow of cool air into the engine and unre-
stricted flow of exhaust gases. The engine
operates on ordinary lubricating oil with-
out the need of oil coolers. This is achiev-
ed by use of the forced circulation type
of cooling system, by-pass thermostatic
control, full length water jackets and dual
water manifold.
A 12 volt generator and electric starting
motor are featured with an inbuilt gaso-
line-conversion starting system.

arbor press
The Hannifin Corporation is now pro-
ducing two new air-operated arbor presses
that are designed for light stamping, die
cutting, marking operations, and press-fit
assembly of electric motors, bearing parts,
etc. Known as Models M-l and M-2 both
are in the moderate price range. Each of
these presses has a pushbutton-controlled
electric valve that speeds up the working
cycle and is designed for bench mounting.
The larger of the two is the M-2 which
has a 121^-inch space between the table
and ram. This unit operates at pressures
up to 2650 pounds with a 6-inch stroke
and a 61/2-mch cylinder. The M-l has a
table to ram gap of 6 inches and delivers

carbon monoxide tester
The Mines Safety Appliance Company
recently announced a new safety product
for detecting the presence of carbon mon-
oxide in the air. Designated as the M.S.A.
Carbon Monoxide Tester this device in-
dicates the presence of carbon monoxide
from 0.001 to 0.10 percent by volume in
air. The tester is easily operated so no
special training is necessary for its use. In
operation air is aspirated through a tube-
containing a yellow silica gel and a com-
plex silico-molybdate which is catalyzed by
palladium sulfate. Because of its size this
instrument is adaptable for use in air-
craft, automobiles, and buses, as well as
industrial atmospheres, mine ventilation,
artificial gas plants, and wherever accurate
carbon monoxide detection is necessary.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


BRIGHT FINISHING was the problem—and engineers
of Crown Cork and Seal Company, Inc., Baltimore,
adopted a high - temperature method for fusing
tin to low-carbon strip, with resultant high-polish
surface, in a continuous production mill.
Then, to obtain the high temperatures necessary
for heat-processing, these engineers selected GAS
and modern Gas Equipment. By directing the heat
of radiant GAS burners over a concentrated area of
the freshly-plated strip it was readily possible to
coordinate the fusing action with the plating
process to accomplish continuous high-speed pro-
duction of bright finished strip.
This typical installation demonstrates the flexi-
bility of GAS and the applicability of modern Gas
Equipment for continuous, production-line heat
processing. Compared with available fuels GAS
is most readily controlled by simple automatic
devices; Gas Equipment can be adapted for use
with existing machinery or incorporated in new
machinery without radical design changes, or ex-
pensive supplemental apparatus.
Manufacturers of Gas Equipment and the American
Gas Association support continuing programs of
research designed to assure the most efficient use
of GAS for every heat-processing requirement.

KENNETH W. ALLISON, 48E
Entering the junior sized automotive
field with a product incorporating many
new designs, the Playboy Motor Car Corp-
oration of Buffalo, New York, expects to
market their product at $985, FOB, fac-
tory. Molding into one unit the ultra-
modern features of business coupe, club
coupe and convertible coupe, the engin-
eers of the Playboy believe they have cre-
ated a new answer to desires appearing in
an old field of the public market.
An experimental model, which incor-
porated most of the important features of
the present Playboy design, was com-
pleted eight years ago. Development
work on this car before and after the war
has resulted in the present 1948 design.
According to the designers, the Playboy
was created primarily to be a companion
or second car, not a substitute for a larger
automobile. The great bulk of operating
parts in the car are standard items pro-
duced by well-known suppliers, thereby
facilitating servicing and reducing main-
tainance costs.
One of the most important features of
the car is its all-steel convertible disap-
pearing top. This should prove to be a
boon to many drivers of northern climate-
states where summer months are pleasant
and winter months rather severe for "cold
canvas."
General descriptive measurements of
the car list the wheelbase as 90 inches—
tread 47 inches—overall length 155 inch-
es—overall width 59 inches—heighth 56
inches—ground clearance under center
sy2 inches; under differential 6 inches—
curb weight 2035 pounds—seat width 50
inches—space back of seat (top up) 25
cubic feet—space in luggage compartment
13 cubic feet.
Performance figures are based on the
present model which employs a 40 horse-
power, four cylinder Continental or Her-
cules L-Head engine. The top speed
attainable is 60 miles per hour or over.
The grade ability is rated at 35 percent.
Fuel economy is claimed to be 30 miles
per gallon for open road driving at speeds
of 45 miles per hour or less; 25 to 30
miles per gallon in city driving. A 48
horsepower engine is said to be under
consideration for use in the Playboy.
The present powerplant has four cylin-
ders and is water cooled. The cooling

Kenneth W. Allison
system features a cellular radiator and
rubber mounted fan connected directly to
the crankshaft, independent of belts. A
sealed water pump has a rated capacity of
40 gallons per minute.
A five quart oil capacity is adequate for
full pressure lubrication to all main bear-
ings, connecting rods, camshaft, tappets
and timing gears. Pistons are made of
aluminum; main and connecting rod bear-
ings are of steel-backed babbitt and are
replaceable. A ten gallon gasoline tank
is mounted at the rear of the car. An AC
Fuel Pump with filter furnishes positive
fuel supply to the engine.
Power is transmitted through an eight
inch dry disk clutch with flexible plate.
The Warner gear transmission has three
speeds and reverse with synchro-mesh.
Helical gears are used throughout.
An independent front wheel suspension
with few moving joints is one of the sim-
plist ever designed. According to the
manufacturer, even a sudden stop will not
disturb the level riding equilibrium of the
car. Coil springs and direct-acting air-
craft type hydraulic shock absorbers both
front and rear are used to assure smooth
riding conditions.
The rigid axle maintains fixed steering
pivots, providing true steering geometry
throughout the entire wheel movement.
The steering gear is a standard Ross twin
cam-and-lever type mounted on the front
frame of the body and is directly linked
to the left hand wheel pivot.
The rear axle is of the Spicer semi-
floating type, with quiet hypoid gears and
roller bearings. Standard ratio 4.1 to 1;
Timken bearings are used throughout.
Wishbone, trackbar, springs and shock
absorbers are all insulated in rubber bush-
ings and never require lubrication. The
drive shaft has full Spicer needle-bearing
universal joints and is balanced for high
speed cruising.
Four 12 inch diameter steel disk wheels
with drop center rims are set on a wheel-
base of 90 inches and a tread of 47 inches.
Five tires size 5.00 x 12 arc furnished
with the car, the spare being easily ac-
cessible in the rear compartment.
Wagner 9x2 hydraulic brakes are used
on all four wheels. They arc automatically
adjusted for wear. The parking brakes
are cable operated and are attached to the
rear wheels only.

The electrical system consists of an
Auto-Lite starter, generator and ignition
system. An 80 ampere hour battery .is
mounted under the hood. Sealed beam
headlamps and dual tail and parking
lights take care of night visibility.
Construction details of the car show
that body and frame are completely wel-
ded into a single unit. A deep, rigid
boxed rail at the extreme width of the car
provides passenger protection and a proper
safe jacking position. Asphaltic coated
sheet metal is used to reduce corrosion.
Previews of this automobile, which is
now under production in Buffalo, New
York, have indicated high popularity be-
cause of its modern style and low price.

(The author wishes to go on record as
stating that, in no way, will he be respon-
sible for the possible epidemics of insom-
nia, nervousness, and irritability of stu-
dents which may arise on any campus after
the date of publication of this article.
Furthermore, any revolt against Mathema-
tics Departments will be purely coinciden-
tal, notwithstanding the fact that this ar-
ticle may be well read).
The Universe is built of Truths,
Disguised before our eyes;
And 'ere we say that Nature errs,
Recall that WE create the lies'.
A traveller once stopped at a town and
went to a barber shop. As per usual, the
topics of conversation between barber and
customer ran strictly to form until the
stranger asked the barber if he had much
competition. "None at all," replied the
barber. "Of all the men in the village, I
naturally don't shave any of those who
shave themselves, but I do shave all those
who don't shave themselves." The strang-
er grunted and lapsed into silence as the
barber proceeded with his task. A week
later the traveller was taken to an institu-
tion for the mentally sick. He would speak
to no one but himself, and he said nothing
but the following:

"Does the barber shave himself or does-
n't he? Suppose he does. Then he belongs
to the group of men who shave them-
selves. But he said that he doesn't shave
those who shave themselves, and therefore
he does not shave himself. Then he be-
longs to the group of men who do not
shave themselves. But the barber said that
he shaves all those who do not shave them-
selves, and therefore he does shave him-
self. Well then, suppose he does ....
Aaaahhhh!!!!"
The plight of this poor fellow does not

David Stein
concern us here; nor does the situation of
the amazing barber who, if he shaves him-
self, doesn't, and if he doesn't, does. We
will be concerned with other trifles—prov-
ing that any number is greater than itself,
that there are two perpendiculars from a
point to a line, that a right angle is equal
to an obtuse angle—and more!
One of the most entertaining and in-
structive types of puzzle is the paradox.
The mathematical paradox probably owes
its appeal to the fact that a contradiction
in "the only exact science" comes to us as
a pleasurable surprise—pleasurable in that
we enjoy establishing a superiority over
that which is claimed to be infallible. And
the paradox, used properly, may be highly
instructive, for it requires a careful return
over the 'glib' road of fundamental prin-
ciples, relationships, reasoning. Everything
must be re-examined to detect the flaw
which led to the paradoxical conclusion.
The reader is cautioned to throw away
any tendency toward mental laziness, and
to prepare himself for a fascinating game
of playing detective. All the clues are
given, step by step, and it is up to the
reader to try to locate the flaw before the
author commits his mathematical crime.
Thus, in this article, Q.E.D. will mean
"Quickly, Easily Duped," instead of quod
era! demonstrandum.
PARADOX 1— To prove 1=2.
The reader has probably been exposed
to this proof at some time or other, but it
is offered as a warm-up to sharpen his wits
and (frankly) to encourage his further
travel along the road of these paradoxes.
Assume: a = b
Multiplying by a,
a2 = ab
Subtracting b- from both sides,
a2-ba = ab — b-
Factoring,
(a + b) (a-b)=b(a-b)
Dividing by a —b,
a + b=b
But since a=b
b + b=b
or 2b=b
and dividing by b,
2=1 Q.E.D
There, that wasn't too bad. But that was
only a warm-up; the reader is now on his
own!
PARADOX II—To Prove +1=
Consider the proportion

Subtracting

Which reduces to

or
a—b a—b
b-fl~b-T

Now, since the numerators are equal,
then the denominators must be equal. That
this is so can be demonstrated easily, for
in a proportion where

then ND1=ND2
or D,=D2
Therefore, b+l=b—1
and subtracting b from both sides,
+ 1 = -1 QE.D.
PARADOX III—To prove that any num-
ber is greater than itself.
Assume that a and b are positive, and
that a&gt;b.
Multiply by b,
ab&gt;b2
Subtracting a- from both sides,
ab—a2&gt;bJ—a"
Factoring,
a(b-a)&gt;(b + a) (b-a)
Dividing by b—a,
a (b-a) (b+a) (b-a)
b-a &gt; "b-a
or a&gt;b+a
But since b was assumed to be positive,
then a is not only greater than itself, but
greater than any number greater than it-
self! QE.D.
Well, in the light of the last Q.E.D.,
proving that y6 is greater than y4 should
not come as too great a shock. (By the
way, does the barber shave himself, or
doesn't he?)
PARADOX IV—To prove Y&amp;&gt;V4
It is safe (?) to start with

Multiplying by log (V2)

or log (!/2):,&gt;'og O/lY

That is, l/8 &gt; 14 Q.E.D.
So far, paradoxes of algebra have been
presented. Probably the most popular of
the paradoxes are those dealing with ge-

ometry, for here material is furnished not
to the mind alone, but to the eye as well.
PARADOX V— To prove that there ate
two perpendiculars from a point to a line.
Let any two circles intersect in A and
B, as in fig. 1. Draw diameters AC and
AD, and let CD cut the circles at X and
Y respectively. Since an angle inscribed in
a semi-circle is a right angle, then /_ AYC
and / AXD are right angles. Therefore
AX and AY are both perpendicular to
CD. QE.D.
PARADOX VI—To prove that a right
angle is equal to an obtuse angle.
Let ABCD be any rectangle, as in fig. 2.
Draw line BE outside the rectangle such
that BE = BC (=AD). Construct the per-
pendicular bisectors of DE and AB, which
must meet in some point P because per-
pendiculars to non-parallel lines must in-
tersect. Draw DP, EP, AP, BP. In triangles
APD and BPE, AD = BE by construction.
AP=BP and DP=EP since any point on

Figure 4(c)
the perpendicular bisector of a line seg-
ment is equidistant from the ends of the
line segment. Therefore AAPDssABPE
(s.s.s. = s.s.s.), and so zDAP=/EBP.
But l_ 1 = /_ 2 because in isosceles APAB,
PA = PB. Subtracting / 1 and /_! from
/ DAP and / EBP respectively, the re-
sult is / DAB= /_ EBA. That is to say, a
right angle equals an obtuse angle. Q.E.D.
PARADOX VII—To prove that two un-
equal lines are equal.
In fig. 3, let ABC be any triangle, and
draw PQ parallel to AB. Then AB AC
v Y PQ PC
or, AB.PC^ACPQ.
Multiplying by AB —PQ,
AB.PC(AB-PQ)=ACPQ(AB-PQ)
or
AB^.PC-AB.PC.PQ^AB.AC.PQ—
PQ^.AC
which may be written as
AB2 .PC-AB -AC PQ = AB .PC -PQ-
PQS -AC

by
PROF. A. D. MOORE
Editor's note:
The following article has been slightly
condensed from the original. For Prof.
Moore's complete work refer to the Journ-
al of Engineering Education, March,
1941.
Over 17 years ago, the writer devised a
new method for finding the mean ordinate
of a curve. The method is so simple, so
fast, so free (relatively) from possibility
of error, and so accurate, that in numer-
ous instances it should displace the use of
the planimeter, Simpson's Rule, counting
of squares, and other methods.
In order to explain the method, it is
necessary herein to show certain argu-
ments, procedures, and constructions. The
reader may thus get a first impression that
the method cannot be as speedy as is claim-
ed. However, it will be shown at the end
of this paper, that in a great many ordi-
nary cases the method may be applied
with extreme simplicity.
As in some other methods, this one in-
volves dividing the area under a curve into
vertical strips. By dealing with a sufficient-
ly narrow strip, it is always possible to seg-
regate an arc of a smooth curve, such that


Prof. A. D. Moore
the arc is essentially an arc of a parabola.
Therefore, we begin by dealing with the
properties of a parabolic curve.
Figure \a shows a symmetrical parabola.
It has long been known that the mean or-
dinate PO lies along the middle vertical,
the point O being one-third the distance
from the arc to the chord (or base) AB.
Next divide this area into an infinite
number of vertical strips. Next, slip these
strips vertically downward into Fig. lb,
until they rest on the chord CD. The form-
erly symmetrical parabola has now become
a skewed parabola. The area has remained
unchanged, and it is now equal to PO
times AB. Point O is still one-third of the
distance from arc to chord, taken along
the middle vertical. MP times AB is ob-
viously the area of the trapezoid. There-
fore, MO times AB is the area under the
curve, accurately; and MO is the curve's
mean ordinate.
In Fig. 2, the curve ABCD has the base
GE. The entire curve might be arbitrarily
called a skewed parabola, and its mean or-
dinate MO found by locating O on the
middle vertical at the one-third point
from arc to chord AD. In fact, with a
curve having a single smooth sweep such
as this, to handle it "in one bite" will
often bring in an answer with very small
error, with amazing frequency, in spite of
the apparent roughness of the assumption.
However, assume that we need the
greater accuracy obtainable by dividing
an area into two vertical strips of equal
width (refer to Fig. 2, arc ABC only).
On the middle verticals in each strip, lo-
cate the two mean ordinates by the one-
third rule. Join the tops of the mean or-
dinates, thereby finding point R at the in-
tersection. LR is obviously the mean or-
dinate of the area enclosed by ABCFGA,
since the strip widths are equal; and /./?
times GF is the area under arc ABC.
Suppose next, that in the case just treat-
ed, we had doubts about the accuracy ob-
tained by taking the curve "in two bites."
Instead, we could have taken four, and
such a treatment is shown in Fig. 3. The
area is divided into four strips of equal
width. The right-hand pair and the left-
hand pair are combined, as in Fig. 2. The
tops of the mean ordinates of the pairs
are joined, thus giving the intersection O.
MO is the mean ordinate for the whole
curve, and MO times AB is the area under
the whole curve.
Before taking the steps that will gener-
alize the method and free it from the ne-
cessity of taking strips of equal width, let
us pause to consider accuracy. Suppose the
one-third points are estimated by eye.
and that some error therefore is present.
Remember also that the arcs of curves are
only approximately parabolic. What then?
In such a case as that of Fig. 3, the little
areas between arcs and chords are the only
areas affected by error, and they amount,
on the average, only to perhaps 3 percent
of the total area involved. It follows that
with any reasonably good estimate of
point locations, and with smooth curves,
the new method will typically yield results
with less than 1 percent error. The expe-
rience of the writer and of hundreds of
his students leaves no room for doubt
about this statement.
When we seek still greater accuracy,
other factors must be mentioned. Among
the great mass of curves that are worked
with in numerous ways, only a small frac-
tion are ordinarily plotted to better than
one-half of 1 percent. The graph paper
that is accurate within the same limits is
equally rare. However, if plotting meth-
ods are highly accurate, if the paper is
highly accurate, if lines and points are lo-
cated with skill and care, and if the arcs
selected are properly chosen, errors of less
than one-half of 1 percent are easily ob-
tainable.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



Fig. 4
The generalized method in which strips
need not be equally wide, is portrayed in
Fig. 2. In a given case, it may appear that
if the curve AD is treated in terms of arcs
AB, BC and CD, each arc will in itself
be closely parabolic. Find the mean ordin-
ate of each strip by applying the one-third
rule along the middle verticals. Join the
tops of the mean ordinates of arcs AB and
BC as illustrated above, obtaining the
mean ordinate LR for the area under arc
ABC. Now that the two strips ABLG and
BCVL have been combined, the top of the
mean ordinate represented by point R may
be treated as the mean ordinate of a single
strip under arc ABC.
Strip CDEF may be "added in" as fol-
lows. Call line CF the "fence" between
the two strips. / is the distance SH from
the fence. Lay off this distance from R
such that RO equals SH. Drop a vertical
line through O. As can be proved, MO is
the mean ordinate for the entire curve.
Moreover, M automatically falls at the
center of GE.
Figure 4 can be used to bring out some
more of the general qualities of the meth-
od, some of which may prove confusing

or even be overlooked, especially by stu-
dents not overly familiar with graphics.
The curve in Fig. 4 has a point of inflex-
ion. By using such strips as will put a
"fence" at the point of inflexion, arcs on
either side of the fence will often be
closely parabolic. In the left-hand strip,
the curve arc is "inverted," compared with
arcs heretofore shown. The method still
applies: locate P on the middle vertical,
one-third of the way from arc to chord.
Proceed to get MO as in Fig. 2. The other
feature shown here is that the method is
independent of the position of the axis:
the axis may cut the curve, or be above or
below the curve.
In Fig. 5, assume that all that is needed
is to find the area of the closed curve CD*-
ED, and that originally, the axis AB was
not even present. Put in any such axis as
AB. and cut the total curve into the upper
arc CD'E and the lower arc CDE, by
means of tangent verticals AC and BE.
Use such strips as are necessary (not
shown in Fig. 5) to determine the two
mean ordinates, MO for the lower arc,
MO' for the upper arc. Obviously, the
enclosed area is
AB(MO') - AB(MO), or simply
AB(OO'). Obviously, AB can be located
anywhere.
The simplicity and speed of the method,
as applied to numerous ordinary situations,
is illustrated in Fig. 2. Here, the curve
ABCD is plotted on ordinary 10-to-the-
unit graph paper. In this figure, the chord
AB has been drawn. But in practice, it is
not drawn at all: simply place a straight-
edge to A and B, observe the middle ver-
tical at W (a graph paper line,) dot the
point P by estimation of the one-third dis-
tance. Get point Q likewise. Shift the

Charles A. Nagler '37E
In 1946 Charles Nagler assumed the
role of associate professor in the depart-
ment of Chemical Engineering at Wayne-
University. This move followed nine years
in the engineering field after graduation
from the University of Michigan in 1937.
This is not Mr. Nagler's first experience-
in teaching as he had previously served as
an instructor of metallography at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota. His varied engineer-
ing career included positions as Chief
Metallurgist at the Twin Cities Ordnance-
Plant and some consulting work in Min-
nesota.
Mr. Nagler has been active in technical
society work ever since graduation. He is
the author of many reviews and discus-
sions of technical papers. He served on
the executive committee of the program
committee of the Northwest Chapter of
the American Society of Metals and was a
member of the committee on microstruc-
tures. He also belonged to the American
Foundrymen's Association. Mr. Nagler is
also associated with the American Society
of Tool Engineers.
Harold E. Carlin '15E
Two years ago Mr. Carlin started the
Carlin Construction Company. Not an in-
experienced organization, the Carlin Com-
pany is headed by a man with more than
thirty years experience in the engineering
field. After graduation in 1915, Mr. Carlin
became associated with the Ford Motor
Company. From 1916-20 he served as a
field engineer. This was folowed by eight
years of service as superintendent of con-
struction for the Ford Motor Company in
the upper peninsula. In 1928 Mr. Carlin
left the Ford Company to spend a year
with the Michigan Highway Commission.
In 1929 Mr. Carlin journeyed to the far
east to become General superintendent of
construction for the Hong Kong Construc-
tion Company in Hong Kong. In 1931,
he returned to the United States as a
county engineer in Michigan. This position
was followed by a two year association in
Roanoake, Virginia as a project engineer.
In 1940 Mr. Carlin began a six-year ten-
ure as project manager in charge of con-
ws
struction for the Hercules Powder Com-
pany. In 1946 Mr. Carlin left the Her-
cules Company to form the Carlin Com-
pany.
Fred S. Norcross '06E
Mr. Norcross, better known to his team-
mates from his football playing days at
Michigan as "Norky", has been elected
Vice President of the Freeport Sulphur
Company. He has been in Cuba as Presi-
dent and General Manager of Freeport's
subsidary, the Cuban Mining Company,
since 1930. During that time he built the
ore concentration plant there and has been
in charge of its operation since its open-
ing.
In the early part of the war he was in
charge of the construction of the large Cu-
ban nickel plant built by the Nicaro Nickel
Company, another Freeport subsidary.
During the course of his career as a
mining engineer Mr. Norcross has work-
ed in Alaska, British Columbia, Ontario,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Mexico,
and most of the mining regions of the

Fred S. Norcross
United States. During the first world war,
he served with the 27th Engineers and
was engaged in several of the Hindenburg
line battles. At the time of his discharge
from the army, Mr. Norcross held the rank
of Major.
During his college days, "Norky" was
cparterback on the 190-4, 1905, and 1906
"point-a-minute" football teams of the
Fielding H. Yost era.
Robert S. Archer '16E
Mr. Archer's value to industry has been
emphasized by the fact that he has been
associated with only four companies in his
thirty year engineering career. Though he-
graduated in 1916 it was not until the

Robert S. Archer
close of World War I that Mr. Archer
joined the Aluminum Corporation of
America in Cleveland. He served with
Alcoa until 1930, then moved to the A.O.
Smith Corporation of Milwaukee. Four
years later Mr. Archer moved south to
Chicago and a position with the Republic
Steel Corporation. Still habitating big
cities, Mr. Archer made his latest move in
1944 when he became associated with Cli-
max Molybdenum Company of New York
With 'Climax' Mr. Archer serves as as-
sistant vice president. Among his manifold
duties are metallurgy, research, and sales
promotion.
Mr. Archer's entire engineering career
has been marked by a vivid interest in
technical societies. As a member of the
American Society of Metals, American In-
stitute of Mining and Metallurgical En-
gineers, and the Iron and Steel Institute
of Britain he has written well over a score
of technical papers on the science of met-
als. In 1924 Mr. Archer collaborated with
Dr. Zay Jeffries in the publication of a
book entitled "Science of Metals". In
1935 Mr. Archer served as president of the
American Society of Metals.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


by
LEONARD J. BLUMENTHAL, '48E
The purpose of this paper is to discuss
the problems confronting the automobile-
radio designer, and their solutions. Many
things influence the operation of an auto-
mobile radio, and it would be impossible
to detail all of them. I shall, therefore,
discuss only the most important considera-
tions.
The power supply
The choice of a suitable source of power
is by far the most important consideration.
Any method for converting a.c. to d.C. is
impractical due to the primary difficulty
of transmitting a.c. to a moving automo-
bile. A small, self-contained alternator
within the car is too expensive a proposi-
tion for sensible consideration. The ob-
vious selection is to use the d.c. already
present in the storage battery of the car.
The six to eight volts present at the term-
inals of a charged battery—while proper
for the filaments— are much too low for
the plates. A special step-up arrangement
called a vibrator pack is employed. The
vibrator pack first converts the low-poten-
tial d.c. to a.c, increases this voltage by
means of a transformer, and then rectifies
it to high-voltage d.c. This action is ac-
complished by allowing current from the
battery to flow through the primary of a
transformer, and interrupting it at regular
intervals to produce a fluctuating magnetic
field. This field, in turn, induces a voltage
in the secondary, which is then rectified
and filtered.

There are two types of vibrating reed
circuits employed: the non-synchronous
and the synchronous. In the former, as-
sume that the reed is equidistant from the

two contacts, touching neither, when the
magnetic coil K is energized. The reed R
is pulled into contact with point A. Im-
mediately current flows in one-half of the
primary of the transformer. This is
shown in Fig. 1 by a solid line. Simul-
taneous with this current flow, the coil
is shorted and the reed released. The
reed possesses enough spring force on
release to carry it into contact with point
B, causing current to flow in the other
half of the transformer. This is shown in
Fig. 1 by a dashed line. The magnetic coil
is again energized, and the cycle repeats.
The resulting current wave through the
primary is a square wave (see Fig. 2)
which is easily stepped up, rectified, and

filtered. The small peaks are due to the
making and breaking of the current.
The synchronous vibrator is similar to
the non-synchronous, except that it has a
second set of contacts that rectify the out-
put of the secondary, eliminating a recti-
fier tube. This action is accomplished by a
center tap on the secondary which furn-
ishes the output terminal with the correct.
polarity when the primary and secondary
are correct (See Fig. 3).
The buffer capacitor Cb adjusts the tim-
ing of the vibrator and transformer. It is
used to absorb surges that would occur on
breaking the circuit due to the instantan-
eous collapse of the magnetic field. The
value of the buffer can determine to a
large extent the life of the vibrator. The
large voltages produced in the secondary
by the collapse of the magnetic field neces-
sitate the use of high-voltage rating buffer
capacitors—in the range of 1500-2000
volts.

suits in an interference called a "hash".
This "hash" contains frequencies ranging
from 200 cycles to 10 megacycles. The
filter problem presented here for such a
wide range of frequencies is very difficult
to overcome. The interference is usually
minimized by an LC combination called a
"hash" filter. These are represented by
r-f choke and condenser in Figs. 1 and 3.
Mechanical noises and interferences
Mechanical hum resulting from the vi-
brator provides enough trouble to warrant
special consideration. The vibrator pack
is often rubber mounted to reduce this
noise. The vibrator itself is always sponge-
rubber mounted in its container can.

prof rote
Frank B. Rote is in a unique position
on the University of Michigan faculty. He
holds the title of Asst. Professor in two
departments; Metal Processing and Chem-
ical &amp; Metallurgical Engineering. In addi-
tion, his immediate job as head of the
foundry requires him to work for every-
one from the Hospital to the Building and
Grounds Department. This is made nec-
essary by the fact that the foundry makes
most castings that are needed in the oper-
ation of the University—"from 'M' man-
hole covers to book-rests for the Hospital."

Prof. Frank B. Rote
Mr. Rote was born in Rochester, Penn.,
which is a "steel town" about 30 miles
from Pittsburgh. In 1935 he came to the
University of Michgian to study Metallur-
gy, taking his Masters degree in Metallur-
gical Engineering in 1939.
After this feat, Mr. Rote joined The
International Nickel Company of Bay-
onne, New Jersey, working in the devel-
opment and research lab on the subject
of alloy iron.
In 19-12 Mr. Rote returned to the Uni-
versity of Michigan to work in the Engin-
eering Research Department on alloys for
use at elevated temperatures. While en-
gaged in this, he devoted his spare time
to taking his Ph.D. in Metallurgical En
gineering.
In 1944 Mr. Rote became associated
with the Wyman Gordon Company of
Worcester, Mass., doing research on light
alloy forging.
Mr. Rote assumed his present position
in 1946, as head of the University foun-
dry. In addition to the previously men-
tioned work done there, he also conducts
research projects for the American Foun-
drymen's Association, of which he is a
member. He teaches MP 3, MP 9 and as-
sists in the teaching of CM 127 and CM
129.
Besides this, Mr. Rote holds member-
ship in the American Society for Metals,
and Sigma Xi. He took up photography
as a hobby some time ago, but says that
he spends most of his spare time these
days in the-raising of "the two best chil-
dren in Ann Arbor," Frank and Judy, as-
sisted by Mrs. Rote.
Mr. Rote's only comment on his stu-
dents was: "Engineering students seem to
display a remarkable resistance to engin-
eering thinking."

Election by his teammates to captain
the 1948 edition of the Wolverine Ex-
press climaxes an ever-growing list of
achievements for Dominic Tomasi.
Born and raised in Flint, Michigan,
Dom is a versatile athlete and likes to
participate in all sports. During his high
school days at Flint Northern, Dom
starred in both football and baseball, and
since coming to Michigan he has com-
piled an enviable record in both athletics
and other campus activities.
Upon graduation from Flint Northern,
Dom matriculated in the College of En-
gineering in the spring of 1945. Under
the rules then in effect he was able to par-
ticipate in varsity athletics. He tried out
for both football and baseball and has
been a member of both teams since.
This spring will mark Dom's last year
in a Wolverine baseball uniform. On the
diamond, Dom holds down the second
base position. However, his greatest inter-
est in athletics centers around football.
This is immediately manifested by the
way in which any conversation with Dom
seems to keep turning to the gridiron
sport.
We asked Dom what experience stood
out most in his football career here at
Michigan. With a modest smile and with-
out any hesitation, he answered, "The
Rose Bowl trip." After a moment, he
continued, "It was a great thrill and
something I never dreamed would happen
to me when I came down here to school."

Dominic Tomasi
In addition to participation in athletics,
Dom has been active in many other cam-
pus organizations. At present, he is a
member of Triangles, Vulcans, Phi Delta
Theta fraternity and the M. Club.
Dom is directing his scholastic endeav-
ors toward a degree in Mechanical Engin-
eering at present and expects to graduate
in June, 1949. After graduation, Dom
hopes to enter the engineering profession
in an industry near his home.
On the gridiron, Dom packs his 180
pounds around from the guard position.
What he lacks in weight and height, he
makes up in hustle and team spirit. Last
fall, Dom was a key man in many of
Michigan's scoring drives. Regarding next
year, Dom is confident that the Wolver-
ines can look forward to another great
season. Dom's air of modesty and quiet
sincerity augur success in whatever he un-
dertakes. In addition to these qualities,
his ability as a leader is demonstrated not
only by his being named Captain of the
1948 football team but by his election
last year as president of the M Club.

Behind the scenes of engineering the
honorary fraternity Tau Beta Pi, with its
present 63 chapter members, has been
pushing a number of projects. Foremost
among these is the attempt to obtain spe-
cific and clear-cut information on the elec-
tive courses approved in each of the sever-
al departments, so that existing confusion
among seniors and unnecessary gradua-
tion postponements may be eliminated.
John Howell, chairman, and members
of the Tau Bate committee have been con-
ferring with various department heads pre-
paratory to drawing up recommendations
which will clarify the elective status of
every engineering student. Frank Nieden-
fuhr of the Engineering Council has also
been asked to serve on the committee.
Tau Bate men handling the individual

departments include James V. Halvorsen,
Aeronautical and Mechanical; John W,
MacMillan, Industrial-Mechanical; Spen-
cer H. Bush, Chemical and Metallurgical;
John J. Lamb, Physics; Thomas R. Corn,
Electrical; and Ernest L. Bailey, Civil.
Another committee headed by John
Wahr has undertaken the difficult task of
reorganizing and completing the records
of some 1500 Tau Beta Pi alumni of
Michigan Gamma. These records date as
far back as 1906 and are in many cases
difficult to resurrect.
Adopting the idea of a "Bent Session"
from Iowa Alpha at the suggestion of
chapter president Curtis Bottum, the Mich-
igan group has furthered the pioneering
effort to remove the old brain-cracking
examination from its informal initiation.
In its place has been inserted a coopera-
tive pledge class assignment dealing with
the solution of a dozen practical engineer-
ing problems.
Solution of the problems requires the
combined efforts of all Tau Bate initiates
from the various specialized departments,
resulting in a "work together" spirit of
organization. Answers to the problems
when plugged into two equations locate
the centroid of a cloth bent which pledges
stake out on the engine side of campus.
Robert J. Vlasic has been named chair-
man of the fraternity group who are to
rewrite the problems now in use so that
they may be distributed to other chapters
interested in furthering the Iowa-Michigan
experiment.

the biggest inch
In recent years the State of California
has experienced a growth in population
and a steady increase in business and in-
dustrial activity. With this expansion came
the problem of supplying fuel to the West
Coast. The supply of natural gas to meet
peak demands in California became a
topic of general discussion among officials
of gas companies; and therefore, steps
were soon taken to augment California
reserves. The solution to the problem was
the tapping of other sources.
A new pipeline, popularly called the
ed in two sections presented many prob-
lems in construction. The methods used
in solving these problems are both interest-
ing and informative. One section of the
pipe was installed from the California
state line near Blythe, to Santa Fe Springs
in the Los Angeles area. This 30-in. pipe
is 214 miles in length and was constructed
by the Southern California Gas Company
and the Southern Counties Gas Company
of California. The other section is a 26-in.
line installed by the El Paso Natural Gas
Company. The $70,000,000 project was
started in January, 1947, and gas was first
These fields cover part of Texas, Okla-
homa, Kansas, and New Mexico. The
Hugoton and Panhandle fields have esti-
mated recoverable gas of approximately
40 trillion cubic feet, and a proven area
exceeding 4,200,000 acres. The supply in
the Permian Basin is about 400 million
cubic feet per day of raw and residue oil-
well gas. This fuel has heretofore been
wasted at the wells and gasoline plants be-
cause a market was lacking.
"The ultimate capacity of the new line
will be 305 million cubic feet a day, or the
weight equivalent of 7,625 tons. The line
will not be operating at full capacity un-
til early next year, although delivery of
gas began last November. Gas rights have
been contracted for a period of 30 years."
The project, which included ten river
crossings, called for constant change of
pace; and therefore, provided strenuous
tests for equipment and methods. Five of
the river crossings were understream, cne

the additional 250 miles of piping to Du-

from the Atlantic to the Pacific Coasts,
and a fuel supply from coast to coast will
be available.

vices held in Los Angeles on November

Is that "HER" voice?
Yes, indeed. That figure 1 up there, with hundreds of
zeros trailing after it, represents the number of times
"her" voice is amplified when she telephones you from
across the country. Even on shorter calls, the total is
tremendous.
The reason is that circuit resistance reduces the
current which carries the voice. So every few miles
vacuum tube repeaters refresh it by boosting its
power as much as a million times.
The task of preparing new pathways for the voice
occupies many qualified engineers. Tubes and ampli-
fiers must be designed. Cable and intricate mechanisms
must be produced. The lines themselves must be ex-
tended—over mountains and prairies, under rivers and
through city streets—wherever the voice must travel.
Engineers who have a part in this job know there's
a future in telephony.

The approaching baseball season re-
minds me of a game last spring where the
crowd and the ump had a slight disagree-
ment over the relative merits of a pitch.
A few rows over a minister arose and
above the jeering din was heard, "Thou
hast eyes, but see not."
"I guess I've lost another pupil," said
the professor as his glass eye rolled down
the sink.
Mac: What arc you doing with all those
metal filings?
"T": I feed them to sheep.
Mac. Why?
"T": I'm raising steel wool.
Heard on the beach: "My goodness,
isn't that Fanny Brown over there?"
Some people may not believe it, but I
have noticed a definite streak of inventive
genius in some of the Lit students on this
campus. The other day I met one who had
just invented a ladder with no rungs for
cleaning cellar windows.
And here is a note for the Lit students:
A slide rule is not a regulation pertaining
to baseball.
She was only a Redcoat's daughter, but
she sure knew Howe.

Two weeks ago a new electronic calcu-
lator was set up in the experimental lab at
MIT, and three days hadn't gone by be-
fore some unknowing Lit student tried to
divide a number by zero and burned out
all the wiring.

One starry summer night.
She shook her head and sweetly said,
"No, not by a dam site."
There were two skeletons locked in tlic

of here."

PARADOX VIII—To prove that two
non-parallel lines will never meet.
Let a and b of fig. 4(a) be two non-
parallel lines. Draw a third line AB so
that it makes equal angles with a and b.
It is evident at once that since angles 1
and 2 are obtuse, a and b can have no
point in common to the left of the trans-
versal AB. Therefore only what happens
to the right of AB need be considered.

Mark off AC=BD= . Points C and
2
D cannot coincide—as in fig. 4(b)—for
if they did, the sum of the two sides of the
resulting triangle would be equal to the
third side. Even less can the segments AC
and BD have any other point in common
—say the point S of fig. 4(c)—for then
the sum of two sides of the triangle ABS
would be less than the third side.
Now draw CD and mark off CE=DF
CD

(Continued from page 11)
be shown that the segments CE and DF
have no point in common. Therefore EF
can be drawn, EG=FH = EF marked off,
and it can be shown that the segments EG
and FH have no point in common. And
so on. Since this same argument can be re-
peated indefinitely, it must be concluded
that the lines a and b will never meet.
Q.E.D.
The paradoxes presented here are only
a small sampling of those available in the
literature. These were chosen because of
their provocative Q.E.D.'s. It is hoped
that they have provided the reader with
entertainment, for that has been the auth-
or's primary motive in presenting them.
It is interesting to note that the result
of the last paradox (seriously, now) is
the basis for a geometry that is as valid,
in the mathematical sense, as the familiar
Euclidean geometry. That is to say, Euclid-
ean geometry is based on certain axioms
and postulates, and from these is built an
entire system of geometry that is consis-
tent within itself (unless you are fooled
by a glib Q.E.D.).
Euclid, when he came to treat parallel-
ism, stated that through any point in a
plane, there is one, and only one, line par-
allel to a given line in the plane. He recog-
nized intuitively that this postulate was
not self-evident. Mathematicians are still
seeking a proof to vindicate this postulate.
because all attempts to show that it fol-
lows from the axioms have failed. So
far, it still remains an assumption.
Of course, Euclidean geometry works
very well for us on our limited planet,
and so it was natural for man to adopt it
as a working tool. But it must be remem-
bered that Euclidean geometry, in essence.
is a game of the mind, treating of ideal
concepts (points that have no dimensions,
lines that have no thickness, etc) that ac
have never experienced! So long as it does
not contradict itself, the geometry is con-
sistent and mathematically true.
Well then, if the parallelism postulate
in question is only an assumption, then is
it not logical that is is just as correct to
assume one thing as another, so long as
the assumption does not lead to contradic-
tions? Assumptions other than the Euclid-
ean assumption have been made and the

No illustrations can do more than suggest the wealth of facilities
at Standard Oil's new research laboratory at Whiting, Indiana.
Here, in one of the largest projects of its kind in the world, there
are provided the many types of equipment needed and desired
for up-to-the minute petroleum research.
The caliber of the men who work here is high. For many years,
Standard Oil has looked for and has found researchers and en-
gineers of high professional competence. Further, the company
has created for these men an intellectual climate which stimulates
them to do their finest work.
And there is nothing new about the idea that motivates
Standard Oil research. It is simply that our responsibility to the
public and to ourselves makes it imperative to keep moving steadily
forward. Standard Oil has always been a leader in the field of in-
dustrial research; the new Whiting laboratory is proof of our
intention to remain in the front rank.

resulting geometries have proved to be
just as consistent as Euclidean geometry!
These geometries are termed "non-Euclid-
ean Geometry."
The assumption made by a Russian ma-
thematician, Lobachevsky, is: through any
point in the plane, there are two lines par-
allel to any given line! Riemann, another
mathematician, assumed something that
seemingly borders on the idiotic: through
a point in the plane, no line can be drawn
parallel to a given line!
It would be easy at this point to fall in-
to the natural tendency of treating these
fascinating subjects more fully. But they
have been mentioned to point up the fact
that the paradoxical, the "obviously not
true," should not be dismissed without
first formally discrediting them. If there
existed no method or means of revealing
the fallacy contained in the reasoning
whereby we arrived at our paradoxical re-
sults in this article, then would you not
have to accept these results as true? Of
course, the results we obtained are absurd,
but the fault lies in our reasoning, not in
the inconsistency of our mathematics.
In this spirit, then, it is hoped by the
author that the game of paradoxes has led
(Continued from page 22)
the reader to a more intense awareness of
the necessity for a more critical appraisal
of reasoning in dealing with a given set of
conditions (be they mathematical or not).
Furthermore, the appeal of "common
sense" alone is not always sufficient to pro-
vide a means for disproving what we
"know" is absolutely not true. The abso-
lutely not true is just as much absolutely
true to us until it is proved to be not true.
And so the paradoxical, the ridiculous,
takes a more serious position at the side of
the fund of knowledge we accept as true.
With the aid of the paradoxical, the truth
is given a more thorough searching; and
so, too, is our reasoning.
To those who have travelled this far:
it makes no difference whether the barber
has a beard or not.
(Author's note: Out discussion of the
different geometries brought out the im-
portant concept of consistency. The math-
ematician—and the engineer, for that
matter—is most vitally concerned with
consistency. If the assumptions, the
axioms, lead to no contradictions, then
they are valid. And so, in order to main-
tain the consistency of a system, certain
definitions must be made.
hi proving that 2 = 1 we created an
inconsistency in our number system. Re-
tracing our steps in that 'proof, we find
that dividing by a-b is the equivalent of
dividing by zero. Is this a valid pro-
cedure?
Let x=1. We see that r divided by s
s
defines some number x. That is, r di-
vided by s defines a number x such that
s.x=r. We are concerned with the case
that
The
two considerations:
1) r^ko. What number x multiplied by
zero equals a quantity different from
zero? Obviously there is no such number.
2) r=o. What number x multiplied by
zero equals zero? Obviously, any number
will satisfy this condition.
It was required that r divided by s
yield a definite, single solution, x. Di-
viding by zero yields either no solution or
an infinity of solutions. Therefore, in
order to preserve the consistency of the
division process, division by zero is for-
bidden. Fallacies are born with a zero
in the denominator).

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



In the OakdaU Chrinian School, Architect James K.
Havcman, Grand Rapids, Michigan, has created a
pleasing, unadorned exterior. See how well Insulux
complements his design.
Insulux Prismatic

trol. The pattern,
utilizing the jour faces
of the block, turns

ceiling acts as a huge
reflector to redirect
light downward.

GLASS BLOCK
This kind of school daylighting
doesn't "just happen"
LOWER brightness ratios, better daylight distribution, designed into
j new Oakdalc Christian School, Grand Rapids, Michigan, by
architect James K. Haveman.
This daylighting is the result of long research and careful plan-
ning. It didn't just happen!
The first factor in achieving these lighting benefits was the develop-
ment and light-performance measurement of a light-directional glass
block fenestration system which could meet the exacting requirements
of the school classroom.
Next step was proper interior room design, including reflectivities to
make the system work to best advantage.
As a result of studied planning, most brightness ratios are kept
within 10 to 1, within a 6o-dcgree cone of vision. Diversity in task
brightness from first desk to last desk across the room is kept within
a ratio of 5 to 1 under illumination of sky only, and about 3 to 1
under direct sun.

When FASTENING becomes
your responsibility, remember
this important fact - - -
It costs more to specify, purchase, stock, inspect, req-
uisition and use fasteners than it does to buy them. True
Fastener Economy means making sure that every func-
tion involved in the use of bolts, nuts, screws, rivets and
other fasteners contributes to the desired fastening re-
sult — maximum holding power at the lowest possible
total cost for fastening.
You Get True Fastener Economy When You Cut Corns These Ways
1.
Reduce assembly time with accu-
rate, uniform fasteners
2. Make satisfied workers by making
assembly work easier
3. Save receiving inspection through
supplier's quality control
4. Design assemblies for fewer,
stronger fasteners
5. Purchase maximum holding power
per dollar of initial cost
6. Lower inventory by standardizing
types and sizes of fasteners
7. Simplify purchasing by using one
supplier's complete line
8. Improve your product with a
quality fastener.

HANG THAT HAT
IN SOMEBODY'S
INDUSTRY...
Are you going to hang up B lot of useful habits along with
it . . . OR... are you going to use those habits to give you
a flying start on your career?
There's the habit, for example, of reaching for an author-
itative McGraw-Hill book to answer the toughest problems
they can throw at you in an engineering course. That's one
you can use to good advantage for the rest of your business
life. To it, add the habit of reaching for the latest McGraw-
Hill magazine, edited especially for your industry, to keep
abreast of up-to-the-minute trends and developments.
For years, the keenest technical minds in industry have
funneled their best thinking into McGraw-Hill books and
magazines, building up a reservoir of useful information
larger than any one business could ever acquire for itself.
That's why McGraw-Hill is known as "Headquarters for
Industrial Information."
It will pay you to keep the McGraw-Hill habit.

Fhe vibrations present in a moving au-
tomobile necessitate this use of a firmer
tube mounting than would otherwise be
required. Some of the methods in use to-
day are spring caps, clip mounts, and lock-
in bases.
The tuning system must be made stable,
or else it will detune. Slug tuning is as-
suming great prevalence in car radios.
Capacitive tuning is easier to detune, and
causes additional headaches due to an al-
ready capacitive antenna system.
Rubber mountings are employed wher-
ever possible and necessary. The speaker
can be shock mounted in a single unit to
eliminate speaker-to-tube microphonics.
Antenna design
The antenna design poses many prob-
lems to the engineer. Due to size and space
limitations, the antenna must be very
small. The vertical telescoping whip an-
tenna is the most common today. The
small physical length of the antenna means
that it is capacitive. A short cable for min-
imum attenuation necessitates the antenna
(Continued from page 15)
being close to the set. Here, a problem of
antenna versus car design enters.
The car designer wants the antenna to
be as inconspicuous as possible, so he
places it next to the body. This, naturally,
does not interfere with the streamlining
and general appearance of his design. The
antenna designer, however, knows that the
only part of the antenna that receives, is
that which protrudes above the all-metal
hood or body. The metal forms a shield
around the lower part of the antenna. As
a result, a compromise has been reached,
by placing the antenna on a fender or above
the body.
It is important to obtain as high a Q as
possible in the antenna circuit, in order to
get as high a gain as possible ahead of the
first r-f tube. This is done in order to min-
imize amplification of tube noise and get
a better overall signal-to-noise ratio.
The antenna circuit must be adjustable.
For this purpose, a readily accessible an-
tenna trimmer is placed at a convenient
point in the set.
Space limitation. Climate, and
Shielding
Other problems develop due to the con-
fined space of installation. The tempera-
ture is quite high inside the case, and this
necessitates air holes to assist in the dis-
sipation of the heat. The placement of the
set (usually under the air scoop) leads to
the problem in design to prevent water
from entering the set. Naturally, no holes
are placed on the upper surface of the
case. Internal temperature changes re-
quire the use of parts that are thermally
stable. Capacitors must be of the hard
wax, high-temperature variety. Wide hum-
idity and temperature changes necessitate
the covering of as many parts as required
by wax or a viscous tar-base liquid.

tion in their radios today. This holds for
their automobile receivers as well as their
living-room console. The small space al-
lotted behind the dash board, however,
limits the size—and thus the quality—of
the speaker. Both electromagnetic and
permanent-magnet speakers are used. The
electromagnetic speakers are cheaper, but
the energizing of their fields causes a
higher battery drain. The permanent-mag-
net speakers, of course, have no battery
drain. If the speaker and main chassis
were mounted in one piece, speaker-to-tube
microphonics would take place. To elimi-
nate these troublesome noises, the speaker
is usually mounted on a separate frame be-
hind the dash board, and the tubes used
are specifically chosen as to be very stable
in their operation.
The small size allowable for automobile
receiver necessitates very close spacing be-
tween component parts. This close spac-
ing introduces a problem of undesirable
coupling. Proper shielding can prevent
this coupling that results in regenertion in
the set. One ground to the chassis is de-
sirable for the elimination of ground cur-
rents through the power supply.

Other interferences may come from mo-

Bob comes from "a beautiful little city
on the scenic coast of Lake Michigan" (to
use his own words), by the name of Mus-
kegon, Michigan. It was at the high school
of the same name that he engaged in in-
tramural basketball and swimming and
turned out for baseball. Besides this, he
distinguished himself scholastically to the
extent of graduating third in his class, the
class of June 1943. For this he was pre-
sented the Harvard Scholarship Award by
the local Harvard Club.
Having signed up for Navy flying while
still in high school, Bob was assigned to
a V-12 unit upon graduation. As a result
he spent two semester "among the beet
fields" at Central Michigan College of Ed-
ucation in Mt. Pleasant. The next stage in
his training involved four months at Law-
rence College in Appleton, Wisconsin.
Next came pre-flight training at Iowa
University. After six months of this, Bob
was sent to Norman, Oklahoma for Pri-
mary training. This phase of his career
lasted until October of 1945 when he was
given a choice of finishing the course or

being discharged. Bob found this decision
not too difficult to make and after his dis-
charge proceeded to take a little vacation.

Robert Johnson
However, Bob found that inaction was
not for him so he got a job in a foundry
to "while away" the time until he came to
Ann Arbor in March 1946. Upon his ar-
rival in this fair city he enrolled in the
Mechanical Engineering course and settled
down to "enjoy" the local climate.
Bob quickly discovered two things: The
first and more obvious was that Ann Ar-
bor weather was not particularly enjoy-
able; the second was that there existed an
Industrial-Mechanical curriculum which
was just what he wanted. So he made the
switch and found that it was a big load off
his mind to be settled in his chosen field.
Bob has found his labs quite interest-
ing. He has especially enjoyed those in the
field of metallurgy, particularly foundry.
However, he feels that he would not have
seriously missed Economics. Like many
others, Bob would like to see a freer elec-
tive system for engineers to allow them to
take interesting and valuable Lit school
courses such as Psychology and the like.
Bob has no definite plans for the period
immediately after graduation in June 1949-
He likes to travel and might take a trip
to Alaska or South America before settling
down to work for a small mid western con-
cern. A spot in Wisconsin near Lake Mich-
igan would be ideal. This congenial and
enterprising young fellow should go far in
the engineering business.

Alpha Chi Sigma
Alpha Chi Sigma is one of the profes-
sional fraternities on the campus of the
University of Michigan. Its purpose is to
enable those students in chemistry and
chemical engineering who have a common
interest in chemistry to live together and
work together. The fraternity is a national
one, having 5 3 chapters in schools
throughout the country and many profes-
sional chapters composed of men no long-
er in school.
The activities of the Alpha Beta Chap-
ter center around the house on Cambridge
Road, which the chapter acquired last fall.
Thirty-one of the 48 active members
live at the house, and 50 men board
there. The membership is divided equally
into chemists and chemical engineers, the
greater proportion of the chemists being
graduate students and most of the engin-
eers, undergraduates.
Both professional and social functions
are carried out by the fraternity. Profes-
sional meetings, with speakers from indus-
try or the faculty, are held at the house
several times a semester. An Alpha Chi
Sigma Scholarship Award, consisting of
one-year membership in the American
Chemical Society, is granted each year by
this chapter to the senior in chemistry or
chemical engineering with the highest
overall scholastic average. A national prize
of $1000 is awarded annually by all the
chapters to an outstanding scientist in the
field of chemistry or allied subjects. Sever-
al record dances are held at the house each
semester and teams were entered in the
interprofessional fraternity league for bas-
ketball and football.
Alpha Chi Sigma carries as its underly-
ing theme the striving for the advance-
ment of chemistry, both as a science and
as a profession.

held a short meeting on April 20. Among
topics of discussion were: Consideration
of new members, plans for initiation of
new members, and plans for election of
officers. Triangles initiates ten men each
semester. Half of these men are to be
affiliated with a fraternity and half are to
be independent. Extra curricula activities
are considered highly in choosing new
members. L. H.

Behind Development of "Cordura" Rayon
Stronger, lighter tires made
possible by teamwork of
Du Pont chemists, engineers,
and physicists
On the surface, the viscose process for
rayon seems fairly simple. Cellulose
from cotton or wood is steeped in
NaOH to give alkali cellulose, which is
treated with CS? to form cellulose xan-
thate. Adding NaOH gives molasses-
like "viscose," which is squirted through
spinnerets into a coagulating bath of
acid and salt to form from 500 to 1,000
filaments simultaneously:

(cellulose)
Du Pont scientists were working to
improve on the properties of rayon
made by this process when, in 1928, a
rubber company asked for a rayon yarn
that would be stronger than cotton for
tire cords. The problem was given to a
team of organic, physical, and analyti-
cal chemists, chemical and mechanical
engineers, and physicists.
Theoretical and Applied Studies
In developing the new improved rayon,
a number of theoretical studies were
carried out: for example, (1) rates of
diffusion of the coagulating bath into
the viscose filaments, (2) the mechan-
ism of coagulation of viscose, (3) the
relationship between fiber structure and
properties by x-rays, and (4) a phase
study of spinning baths.
Concurrently, applied research was
necessary. This proceeded along many
lines, but the main problem was to per-
fect the spinning technique. It was
known that a short delay in the bath
between the spinneret and the stretch-
ing operation allowed greater tension
on the filaments. Du Pont engineers,
therefore, designed a series of rollers,
each revolving faster than the previous
one, to increase the tension gradually.
In addition, a textile finish was de-
veloped that combined just the right
amount of plasticizing action and lubri-
cating power, allowing the filaments to
twist evenly in forming the cord. A new
adhesive was prepared to join the yarn
with rubber. New twisting techniques
for cord manufacture were found, since
the usual methods caused loss in rayon
strength.
Engineering Problems Solved
Chemical and mechanical engineers
were faced with the design and opera-
tion of equipment for more than 15
different types of unit operations. Equip-
ment had to operate every minute of the
day, yet turn out perfectly uniform
yarn. It was necessary to filter the vis-
cose so carefully that it would pass
through spinning jet holes less than
4/1000th of an inch without plugging.
Some of the most exacting temperature
and humidity control applications in
the chemical industry were required.
Out of this cooperation among scien-
tists—ranging from studies of cellulose
as a high polymer to design of enormous
plants—came a new product, "Cor-
dura" high-tenacity rayon, as strong as
mild steel, yet able to stand up under
repeated flexing. Today, this yarn is al-
most 100 % stronger than 20 years ago.
Tires made with it are less bulky and
cooler running, yet give greater mileage
under the most punishing operating

BEHIND IT...A LITTELL FEED
Refrigerators mean little but ice cubes, vegetables
and cold cuts to the average user. Engineers, however,
know the intricate production problems each unit involves.
They know that "behind" the many sheet metal parts
that contribute to the whole mechanism is a Litlell
Feed that dependably feeds and straightens the
metal from which those parts are fashioned.

Just plain Salt! But what wonders
it performs in the hands of expert
chemists and engineers. Its two
components play a big part in the
production of paper, soap, glue,
metals, metal products, textiles,
insecticides. They help to sanitize
water, launder clothing, kill
bacteria in dairies, restaurants,
food plants.
"Miracle-working" with Salt—as
well as other basic chemicals —
has been Pennsalt's business for
98 years. Starting with a modest
plant at Natrona, Pa., Pennsalt
has steadily grown, until today it
stands as one of America's impor-
tant chemical companies.
Big ? Yes . . . but not so big as to
swallow up its promising young
men. Old? Yes . . . but not too
old to adopt young ideas that are
sound. Pennsalt was founded by a
young man; and grew large through
the efforts of young men.
The future, too, looks bright for
Pennsalt . . . and for the young
men who are going to build it.

A new method of checking field welds

Ideas
Your head electrical man is a good source
of workable, cost-reducing suggestions.
And right now is a particularly good
time to let him prove it.
During the tremendously increased
production of recent years, there has
been a sharp increase in the amount of
power used per employee. Most electrical
systems have been operating under ab-
normal stress. Many are overloaded, un-
reliable and poorly located or inflexible
with respect to present machine loca-
tions. Excessive "down time" and higher
production costs are certainties.
Check with your head electrical man
for possible cost-reducing opportunities
in your plant. A Square D Field Engi-
neer will be glad to work with him in
analyzing any electrical problem and
selecting corrective power distribution
and electric motor control equipment.

PROBLEM—You are designing a telescoping radio antenna
for automobiles. You want to provide a means for extend-
ing and retracting the antenna sections from a convenient
point inside the car. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—The illustrations show how one
manufacturer did it—with two S.S.WHITE
FLEXIBLE SHAFTS. One shaft, operated from the
control knob, turns a reel at the base of the
antenna. The other, on the reel, pushes up and
pulls down the antenna sections as the reel is
turned. As S.S.WHITE shafts can be supplied in
any length, this arrange-
ment makes the antenna
adaptable to all types of
cars and other motor
control shaft vehicles.

cept for the Santa Ana, crossings were of the cable suspension
type. Span lengths between supports ranged from 250 feet for
the Rio Grande, to 1200 feet for the Canadian."
At the Colorado River, the line crosses the channel on a
suspension bridge with a span between towers of 1040 feet and
at a height above the river of about 40 ft. The bridge-tower
foundation consists of 11 ft. diameter caissons sunk to 56 feet
with 14 steel beam pilings driven to firm footing below the
caissons. On the Arizona side of the river, rock was reached at
65 to 70 feet. But on the California side, a depth of 150 feet
below the ground was necessary before firm footing was reached.
The main cables and wind cables were anchored in concrete
blocks 40 ft. long by 20 ft. wide and 15 ft. deep. These blocks
were secured by 35 steel H beam pilings driven on 94 to 1
batter.
The completion of the new pipeline solves the immediate-
problem in California and gas company officials are confident
that in the future the West Coast will have an adequate supply
of the much needed fuel. M. S.
gas turbine
Recently the Westinghouse Electric Corporation developed .i
200 hp gas turbine which is expected to give evidence of the
gas turbine's usefulness in industry and in transportation. During
more than 1000 hours of test operation the performance of tho
turbine has been in accord with design predictions. Operation
under all types of load conditions and up to the design tempera-
ture has caused no objectional distortion and no serious creep-
age. As yet the tests are not complete but so far the experimental
evidence points to the soundness of the general design employed
in this type of open-cycle gas turbine.
The turbine tests began on August 1, 1946. The unit has
been operated approximately 1000 hours, of which more than
850 hours have been accumulated since July 9, 1947. Three-
hundred hours of operation have been spent in evaluating the
performance of the unit and it components. The remainder of
the time has been used in simulating the more severe operating
cycles expected in actual service.
The accurate overall performance of the turbine has been
established by reliable measurements of power output, fuel flow,
speed, air inlet temperature, and atmospheric pressure. To deter-
mine turbine efficiency in a complete plant without a dynamometer
between compressor and turbine requires the accurate measure-
ment of inlet and exhaust temperatures and pressures. Of these,
temperature of the combustion gasses as they enter the turbine is
particularly difficult to determine. Three methods are used: (1)
Direct measurement, using specially designed, shielded-type
probes. (2) Calculation, taking combustion efficiency as 95%,
measuring air and fuel flow, measuring combustor inlet temper-
ature, and neglecting all radiation losses. (2) Calculation, using
the measured turbine exhaust pressure and temperature, measured
inlet pressure, and turbine work by heat-balance calculation.
The gas turbine-component efficiency varied from 84^ to 96c/t ■
In testing, the unit has been started from a cold standstill con-
dition 350 times and has undergone several thousand rapid-load
cycle changes from no load to full load. Loading and unloading
cycle tests have been made to prove its load-response character-
istics. The unit has been operated without an air filter at th-_-
compressor inlet. In this respect we are less fortunate than our

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK

How to make a machine tool
cut out the chatter
Engineers who design machine tools know that if
they eliminate "chatter"—or vibration — they will be
paving the way for faster, more precise machining.
That's why you'll find the great majority of machine
tools equipped with Timken tapered roller bearings.
Timken bearings assure a smooth flow of power from
initial drive to spindle nose. Gears are kept in precise
mesh and alignment, the entire spindle assembly is
rigid and free from vibration. And with Timken bear-
ings, machine tools retain their precise, chatter-free
performance even after many years of hard service.
There's no secret to keeping
shafts in rigid alignment
Here's an engineer's rough sketch of a typical trans-
mission countershaft equipped with Timken bearings.
Due to the line contact between rolls and races, you get
maximum load carrying capacity with no chance for
shaft deflection or misalignment.
And because the tapered design takes thrust as well
as radial loads, end-movement of the shaft is eliminated.
Positive shaft alignment is another big reason why 9
out of 10 bearing applications can be handled more
efficiently with Timken bearings.

sor blade becomes excessively dirty after
approximately 100 hours of operation.
This fouling with oily, dirty soot causes a
drop in compressor efficiency of about
2%, and it is then necessary to wash the
compressor blading. The washing opera-
tion consists of turning the unit over slow-
ly with a starting motor, spraying a non-
corrosive commercial solvent into the com-
pressor inlet, allowing it to soak for a few
minutes, and then washing it off with a
steam spray. This can be done in a short
time without dismantling any part of the
compressor.

The unit is very easy to start, one gen-
erator being used as a motor. The time re-
quired is a function of the starting power
available. When this time is limited to a
maximum of 35 kw, the unit can be start-
ed in about 2'/2 minutes. With a maxi-
mum of 80 kw starting power the unit can
be started in 1 minute; with 20 kw the
time is 8 minutes.
Operation of the unit has not been en-
tirely devoid of trouble. Two serious cas-
ualties have occured, one on the turbine
and the other on the compressor. In anti-
cipation of such difficulties replacement
parts were available; nevertheless approx-
imately three months were required to re-
store the unit to operating condition in
each case.
The future experimental program con-
sists of continuing the cycle testing to gain
further operating experience and to de-
sign and test controls for particular in-
dustrial and transportation applications.
Further tests will be conducted using for
fuel the bunker C oils which have shown
an increase in plant fuel rate of approxi-
mately eight percent, partly due to their
lower heating value and partly to lower
combustion efficiency.
Life characteristics of this unit can
be determined only by actual field applica-
tion. Testing has progressed to the point
where actual life tests must be made. To
prove this type of power plant, considera-
tion is being given to some field applica-
tion where fuel costs are low and 100 per-
cent reliability from a prime-mover is not
immediately essential. There is no reason
to believe that the gas turbine, when per-
fected, will lack in reliability.
chemistry's secret agent
The outstanding feature of a catalyst
is its ability to aid a chemical reaction
and at the same time remain unchanged
in the process. Because of this individual
phenomen a catalyst can be used time
and time again in aiding a chemical re-
action.
The money-saving features of catalysts
has been instrumental in their wide ac-
ceptance and use in industry. For many
years catalytic agents were used in indus-
trial processes without a complete compre-
hension of the nature of their activity.
This lack of knowledge was a great bar-
rier to the development of new catalysts.
Recently, however, much has been learned
about the activity of these chemical aids
and they have assumed added importance
in chemical processes.
By far the petroleum industry is most
affected by the use of catalysts. At one
time petroleum was refined by thermal
cracking. This application of heat and
pressure did a good job of refining, hut
low efficiency and mediocre control of
products marked the process for further
research and modification. With the aid
of catalysts, composed mainly of silica
and alumina, new cracking processes yield
higher quality products with less waste.

fact that huge quantities of them are
necessary. In some cases the reacting oil
is outweighed 50 to 100 times over by
the catalyst. The huge amount of cat-
alyst necessary is not as much of a draw-
back as the layman might think because
of the fact that the catalyst, unchanged
by the cracking process, can be used
many times.
Theoretically many substances will re-
act with one another, but some of these
reactions occur so slowly as to be prac-
tically imperceptible. The object of the
addition of catalysts is to accelerate these
gradual reactions to commercially useful
speeds.
Some catalysts depend on adsorption
for their action. Adsorption is a ten-
dency of molecules to cling, in a thin
layer, to the surfaces. So in cases like this
the total surface area of the catalyst plays
a very important role in determining
the amount necessary to accelerate the
reaction.
Catalysts have occasionally been dis-
covered by pure accident. An oft re-

peatcl story is the case of the chemist
who, studying the reaction of naphtha-
lene with sulfuric acid, accidentally broke
the mercury thermometer with which he
was stirring the mixture. The addition
of mercury brought about a most un-
expected result, and analysis showed that
phthalic acid had been produced. In this
accidental manner the catalytic action of
mercuric sulfate was discovered.
Whether discovered through experi-
mental and theoretical chemistry or by
chance, catalysts are assuming an ever-
increasing importance in the commercial
production of petroleum derivatives,

factured by Neoline, Inc., Los Angeles,
California. The socket is sealed with
Neoprene; and therefore, the bulb and
receptacle are wholly sealed in rubber.
The Phosphor spring bronze contact of
the socket is embedded in Neoprene
threads, while a moisture-tight lip of
Neoprene seals the bulb, while the six-
inch pigtail outlets are molded into the
base. No parts are exposed. The sealing
with Neolite may be submerged in water
without damage from shock.
This product is well suited to outdoor
decorative and utility lighting and for use
wherever a lamp may be exposed to wea-
ther, oil or rough treatment. It is avail-
able in any standard color and in individ-
ual units or strung in sets of any length
and any number of sockets, each socket
being wired independently of the others.

For science, ultra-speed photography

palm-sized hose valve
The Paul Valve Corporation, 638 Third
Avenue, New York, N. Y. have designed
and produced a new palm-sized hose
valve. The new product operates with-
out springs and with only two moving
parts, the operating plunger and the con-
trolling ball.
The hose nozzle is discharged by push-
ing a button. This causes the plunger to
roll the ball off its seat, giving instant full
flow. At 50 psi hose pressure, less than
10 pounds finger pressure on the button

opens the valve. Only 4 pounds of finger
pressure are necessary to hold it open,
giving approximately 13 gallons per min-
ute through the nozzle.
When the push button is released, the
difference in pressure between the center
and the outside of the stream forces the
ball into the valve throat, closing the
valve and raising the push button plunger.
The ball is held firmly against the seat by
line pressure, making a line-contact seal.
The valve is available for standard
hose sizes from 1/4 inch to 1 inch, de-
livering up to 13 gallons per minute at
75 psi line pressure. It is made entirely
of monel, including the ball and the
plunger, for maximum resistance to cor-
rosion and wear. The body is rubber
coated so that there is no danger of
scratching interior surfaces of tanks or
other equipment being cleaned. One
model, fitted with a threaded replaceable
nozzle, makes the valve usable with long
extension nozzles.
The instrument has been developed
for use in industries from chemical plants
to breweries and food-and-drug product
manufacture. Experience with these
valves has shown that because of the
positive sealing action, automatic opera-
tion, and absence of leakage, water con-
sumption has been cut in half in many
cases.
low temperature thermometer
Exteremely low temperatures are being
measured with a special thermometer
which conforms to a basic design devel-
oped by Dr. H. J. Hoge of the National
Bureau of Standards. This thermometer
(designed for 10° Kelvin and higher)
has a platinum protecting tube 48 mm
long and 5.6 mm outside diameter, and it
can be easily mounted inside a calorimeter
by casting in low-melting alloy. It is
helium-filled and therefore can measure
temperatures down to the boiling point of
helium, approximately 5°K. Four wire
current and voltage leads are brought out
through a glass seal. Nominal resistance
at zero degrees C is 25.5 ohms.
The instrument was developed and pro-
duced by Leeds and Northrup of Phila-
delphia, Pennsylvania. It finds usage as
an excellent primary standard for resist-
ance thermometers between —190 and
-L-500 degrees C. When it is used with
the type G-Z Mueller Bridge, tempera-
ture measurements can be made with an
accuracy of ±0.01 degree C. in the
calibrated range.

KARL E. HENION, "48E
It is still amazing to most of us just
how man was ever able to determine the
existence, let alone the weight and elec-
tric charge, of a particle so tiny as the
electron. The story of its discovery is
fascinating and in this tale there lies a
romance which has aroused the crusading
spirit of many a young scientist. Not a
few, intrigued by the new trails of knowl-
edge that the discovery of the electron
blazed, have devoted their entire lives
to its further investigation and to the
study of its next of kin, the protons,
neutrons, positrons, etc.
The discovery of the electron in 1897
by the English physicist, Sir J. J. Thom-
son, was one of several experimental dis-
coveries which highlighted the transition
from the classical period in physics, with
its mechanical philosophy of matter, to
the present-day era of modern physics.
The transitional period extended from
1887-1897, beginning with Hertz' dis-
covery of the photoelectric effect (1887).
Then followed in rapid succession the
discoveries of X-rays (1896), radioactivity
(1897), and finally the electron.
To better understand how Thomson
discovered the electron, or rather how he
interpreted and identified certain physical
phenomena as being tiny particles of neg-
ative electricity, it is necessary to present
the evidence that was available to him up
to the time of the discovery. This evi-
dence, for the most part, consisted of
existing studies of electric discharge
through gases.
electrical discharge through gases
A closed glass tube fitted with sealed-
in electrodes and connected to a vacuum
pump, as shown in Figure 1, serves as a
simple type of experimental apparatus
for studying electric discharge through
gases. When an electric discharge passes
through a gas at low pressure, beautiful
and interesting effects can be observed.
Referring to the figure, an induction coil
may be used to supply the potential re-
quired to maintain the discharge. At
atmospheric pressure nothing happens, but
when the pressure is reduced to 8 cm. of
mercury a noisless discharge takes place
in the form of a violet-colored thread of
light between the electrodes. Next, this

Karl E. Henion II
discharge broadens and the tube becomes
filled with a soft glow, accompanied by a
noticeable glow at the cathode. As the
pressure is further lowered, the glow be-
comes dimmer until finally at .001 mm of
mercury the luminous column disappears
and the walls of the tube exhibit a bright-
green fluorescent glow. These observa-
tions are interpreted in the following
manner. At normal pressures the space
within the tube is crowded with air mole-
cules and ions. When the induction coil
is excited, positive ions of the air are
attracted by electrostatic force to the
cathode; they impinge on the cathode
with enough force to knock out some of
the electrons from the cathode's atoms.
These are then free to move and are at-
tracted to the anode. At atmospheric
pressures, however, they do not have a
chance to get started on their journey to
the anode due to the profundity of the
comparitively large air molecules, which
hem them in from all sides. As the
pressure is lowered, the electrons are able
to make their way to the anode and in
so doing ionize the air molecules still
further, which is evidenced by the thread
of light extending between the electrodes.
This is explained by the fact that when
the cathode rays (electrons) ionize the
air they raise certain numbers of electrons
that comprise the molecules of the air
from their normal orbits to higher ones;
when these electrons fall back to their
accustomed orbits they release energy
manifested in the form of light. This is
the light that is observed in the tube.
When the pressure is as low as 0.001
mm, there are no air molecules to speak
of for the cathode rays to ionize and the
rays now impinge on the glass container,
causing it to glow in the same manner
just described.
early study of discharge
phenomena
In 1785, Wm. Morgan observed the
green fluorescence described above. Some-
thing was causing all the mischief inside
these tubes but he didn't know quite what.
In 1858, Pluecker at Bonn made signifi-
cant studies of discharge phenomena us-
ing a highly evacuated tube. He, too,
observed the aforementioned green fluor-
escence, but he also observed that when
an electromagnet was placed near the
glass tube, the position of the glow
shifted. In 1869, W. Hittorf, a student

WILLIAM L. WOELK, '48E
The woodworking industry, which pro-
duces the second largest amount of con-
sumer durable goods in the country, has
adopted scientific methods of production
and management and is seeking men
qualified to administer them. This creates
an excellent opportunity for men inter-
ested in growing with a new profession.
This industry is one of the oldest known
to mankind, but it is one which has only
recently accepted modern methods. The
new methods, which stem from the sci-
ence of machining and finishing wood,
were born yesterday but are now used by
woodworking companies all over the
world. These companies manufacture
everything from toothpicks to furniture
and homes. All of them require men
educated in the science of working wood.
This report will discuss the wood-
working industry's background, its prob-
lems, and the opportunities that exist in
the field today. It will also explain the
latest principles of machining wood in
order to help engineers with practical
problems encountered in the design and

William L Woelk
use of woodworking machines.
Prior to the acceptance of scientific
methods, skilled craftsmen were the back-
bone and burden of the woodworking
industry. These men worked and man-

^


A far cry from hand tools
aged plants in the age-old manner which
they had learned. They relied largely on
"feel" and intuition for guidance. Most
of these guiding concepts, learned from
"old hands" and accepted without ques-
tion, were actually little more than super-
stition. The influence of these skilled
craftsmen resulted in heavy, inefficient
machines; slow hand methods of shaping,
fitting and finishing the wood; and
plants which "just grew" without benefit
of the principles of plant layout. These
inefficient conditions were so common in
woodworking plants that few companies
felt the spur of up-to-date competition
and little progress was made.
Finally the rising costs of labor and
wood forced owners to examine their
plants and methods in order to effect
economies. They found that a great deal
of improvement was possible. Plants in
similar industries operated efficiently
enough to demonstrate vividly the im-
provements possible. Some owners be-
came convinced of the need for improve-
ment and began looking for help.
The machine builders needed accurate
information on the machinability of
wood before they could begin designing
machines with top performance. Some of
this information was similar to that de-
termined for metal-cutting speeds, knife
materials and knife angles, feed, depths
of cut, the effect of different woods and
the power required per cubic inch re-
moved. However, there were other
properties uniquely concerned with wood
that had to be determined. These were:
the effects of moisture content, season-
ing, grain direction, natural resilience of
the wood, knots and knife sharpness
upon tool life, surface finish, and machin-
ability. More variables exist in machin-
ing wood than in steel because wood is
a natural product while the characteristics
of steel are selected and developed in
manufacture.
These questions interested engineers
at various schools and at the U. S.
Forest Products Laboratory. They out-
lined experiments to find the answers
and at their request, the A.S.M.E. Wood
Industries Division set up a special pro-
gram to assist and coordinate their efforts.
A 74 page Bibliography On the Machin-
ing of Wood was compiled under this
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


A.S.M.E. Most of the material was found
to be sketchy and incomplete.
There were a few noteworthy excep-
tions, though, for some of the papers
were complete and authoritative. The
works of German scientists were prom-
inent among these and The Machining
and Culling of Wood by Kollman is
particularly helpful. Important sections
of this book were translated from the
original German by a joint committee.
These sections of KoIIman's book are
now widely used for teaching and re-
search on the machinability of wood.
P. Harris, an Englishman, had conducted
some excellent experiments but the woods
tested are not commonly used in the
United States. These results, therefore,
were of little help to American manufac-
turers.
The woodworking companies were in-
terested and anxious to obtain the results
of the experiments undertaken in the Uni-
ted States, but because of business condi-
tions they did not advance money or
machines to aid in the work. This slowed
the program but did not stop it and the
engineers continued with their plans.
Probably the first in this American group
to make an important contribution was E.
M. Davis, a wood technologist at the
U. S. Forest Products Laboratory, Madi-
son, Wisconsin, which operates in con-
junction with the University of Wiscon-
sin. Davis ran a series of planing tests
on various woods, particularly southern
hardwoods. The results were published in
the A.S.M.E. Transactions, January, 1938.
Davis has since conducted many more
experiments, the results of which were
compiled and added to this early report
and are now available from the U. S.
Dept. of Agriculture in pamphlet form.
In 1936 experiments dealing with the
machining of woods commenced at the
University of Michigan and have con-
tinued ever since. The first important
papers to develop from the work done at
Michigan was the "Mechanical Properties
of Certain Tropical Woods" which was
published in the A.S.M.E. Transactions.
The equipment for these early experi-
ments was limited, but today the school
owns one of the best equipped labora-
tories in the world for testing the machin-
ing properties of wood. The lab, as can
be seen in the illustration, contains many
new machines, most of them equipped
with variable speed drives on both the
spindle and feed for exact control of
test conditions. The lab also includes
precision grinders for sharpening tools,

Prof. Louis A. Patronslcy illustrating use of band saw
recording wattmeters, microscopes, tacho-
meters and other accurate measuring de-
vices. Rooms are being installed in which
the relative humidity can be controlled
to an accuracy of plus or minus 1%.
These rooms are essential for adjusting
the moisture content of the wood prior
to strength and machining tests.
Wood is machined mainly by three
methods. Tests for machinability dupli-
cate these methods under controlled con-
ditions. The most common method em-
ploys a rotary cutter similar to that used
in milling metals and is variously called
shaping, planing or routing, depending
on the other characteristics of the ma-
chine. The other two methods are boring
and turning. Reciprocating tools such as
metal cutting planers and shapers are not
used because wood has definite fiber
direction and splits easily along the
grain.
Test blocks are cut to the desired size
and adjusted to the specified moisture
content. These are then pulled through
a planer or saw by a variable speed motor
winch, used to change the feed rate.
Wattmeter readings are taken on all the
motors during the test. One variable such
as cutter speed, feed, depth of cut, mois-
ture content, grain direction, or wood
species is varied on each pass. Readings
of power consumption, feed force, sur-
face finish, and cutter wear are made and
the results tabulated to aid in selecting

engineer.
Mr. Lawrence then entered the S. S.
Kresge Co. of Detroit in 1925, where his
duties consisted of purchasing public
utility services for the concern. At Kresge
he successfully combined both purchasing
and engineering work, and his additional
duties included design and the writing of
specifications. His tenure at Kresge's
lasted until 1942, when he left to work
for the F. C. Williams Co. of Dearborn
in the capacity of sales engineer.
He remained there less than a year and
late in 1942 entered civil service as a
project engineer with the Ordnance De-
partment Development Branch. He re-
mained in government work for three
years and then resigned to become a

Step right in folks and meet a modern
Purchasing Agent—Say! he's not such a
tough egg; in fact he looks almost human.
Let's see what he has to say for himself.
How do you like the purchasing game
Mr. Purchasing Agent?
Swell! I think it is one of the most
fascinating phases of our business and
there is never a dull moment as we watch
market changes, developments in machin-
ery, outbuy our competitors, and keep
abreast with all activities in our own or-
ganization.
Well, Mr. Purchasing Agent, they tell
me you're an engineer. Would you be
kind enough to tell me what an engineer
is doing as a buyer?
Let's look at it this way; as a buyer
I'm purchasing raw materials, supplies and
machinery for Production Engineers, De-
sign Engineers, and Maintenance Engin-
eers. And whom do I buy 'em from, Sales
Engineers. Seems to me that if the buyer
is going to understand all these people he
should have some technical knowledge


David B. Landsdale
too. That's why I've chosen this job.
For instance, here is a schematic sketch
one of our designers has drawn of a pro-
posed pulp bleaching process. The pulp
goes into some sort of a dry breaker at
this end. After it is chipped it drops into
a continuous mixing tank where it is
mixed with steam and chemicals. Now
my job is to find a suitable breaker and
mixer so this designer can make final
plans. I'll work right along with the
engineer on this project.
There are various means of finding
companies who would be interested in
supplying this sort of equipment. After
listing these companies, I will contact
them for a talk with their Sales Engineer.
In these talks, we'll go over plans for
every conceivable piece of machinery that
might do the job. Finally the field is nar-
rowed down to several ideas, and arrange-
ments are made to visit plants where simi-
lar equipment is being used. Next week
our designer and I will take some trips
and select his requirements.
And speaking of travel, I have my
share. At least enough to look for new
items and keep in touch with our key
suppliers. You see, our Production De-
partment must count on a steady supply

brazing
By changing from a casting to a brazed-
joint tubular assembly, a west coast man-
ufacturer has slashed production costs on
his furnace burner-assemblies over 50%.
Another company automatically brazes
carbide tool-tips on engine lathe tools
for 4 cents each. Under its old hand
system, the same task cost 58 cents.
Few, if any, improved fabricating
methods give product designers such
chances to lift productivity and reduce
costs as does brazing. One cost saving,
for instance, stems directly from auto-
matic heating equipment which permits
the greatest percentage of brazing work
to be done quickly by unskilled workers.
Yet, because many designers are unfa-
miliar with brazing's advantages, the
method is still not applied to hosts of
products that would benefit from its neat,
strong joints.
Excellent examples of brazed joints are
found on household silverware, as braz-
ing was once the exclusive tool of silver-
smiths and costume-jewelry makers. Re-
frigeration was one of the first of the
heavier industries to realize and to profit
from its possibilities. Needing a method
of joint forming that would not break
down in service, refrigeration engineers
experimented with and found their answer
in silver brazing.
It took the rapid advance in induction-
heating methods, plus the war, to push
this half-brother of soldering and weld-
ing into the spotlight and prove its tal-
ents for the entire industrial world. Be-
cause of inadequate metal-casting and
forging facilities and because production
of castings and forgings was relatively
slow, at best, many wartime manufac-
turers turned to stamped-metal product
components and brazed them into a strong
assembly that did the work of the heavier
casting or forging.
Today, the pioneering refrigeration in-
dustry has been joined by the electrical,
automotive, plumbing and heating, and a
score of other industries in incorporating
brazing into product designs.
Regardless of brazing's widening cir-
cle of friends, even the experts find it
hard to pin down precisely what it is and
how it differs from soldering and weld-
ing. Some brazing alloys are called
"solders," and the process is often re-
ferred to as "welding." Brazing, how-
ever, is different from either soldering or
welding.
In its true sense, brazing implies a
strength of joint far beyond that achieved
through soldering; it uses metallurgically
different metals as bases for its alloys
and functions within a temperature range
(800 deg. F. or more) above that of
either hard or soft soldering. In addition,
the alloy usually is composed of a non-
ferrous metal like silver, copper, or
aluminum. Most brazing alloys have
either a silver or copper base. Silver
alloys contain around 9 to 80% silver,
the remainder usually being composed of
copper and zinc. Cadmium and phos-
phorous are sometimes added.
A common copper-brazing alloy has
60% copper, 40% zinc. Here again,
cadmium and phosphorous are often ad-
ded for special bonding or melting quali-
ties, as are nickel, iron, and cobalt. Gen-
erally speaking, these alloys are used to
combine, or braze, any combination of
copper-, iron-, or nickel-based metals.
Aluminum and magnesium alloys us-
ually are used to bond only metal combi-
nations of the joined parts.
One big reason for brazing's growing
industrial acceptance is the strength de-
veloped in the brazed joint. A brazed
joint is stronger than the brazing alloy
itself. The reason for this is not defi-
nitely known, but theory points to mole-
cular diffusion of the molten alloy into
the wetter surfaces of the joined parts.
Joint design is important in brazing. If
the joint is not snug fitting, this all-
important molecular factor doesn't come
into play, and the strength of the joint
is about that of the brazing metal.
The additional cost required to make
close-tolerance mating surfaces for a
strongly brazed joint may at first appear
prohibitive in many cases. Yet, the
possibility of higher productivity, lower
assembly costs, fewer rejects, and joint
eye-appeal probably will outweigh this
objection.
A factor likely to be critical in any
decision to re-design products around
brazing is the question of heating. In
selecting proper heating equipment, the
type of brazing alloy used, metallurgical
qualities of the parts to be brazed, type
of in-plant heating on hand, and the de-
sired rate of production play vital parts.
Methods of heating most widely used
today are: induction furnaces (approxi-
mately 75% of all induction furnaces are
used for brazing); electric and gas fur-
naces; gas torch; electrical resistance
(similar to spot welding); salt bath
(immersion in molten salt); dip tank
(in which a molten bath of brazing alloy
is heated externally, parts dipped into it);
and radiation (quick-acting gas-air burn-
ers using radiant heat).
Metallic characteristics, such as re-
sistance to corrosion, magnetic qualities,
melting points, etc., should be taken into
consideration. Radiation losses, equip-
ment life, and maintenance are some of
the economical factors affected by temper-
ature range.
One goal of brazing-alloy research is
to force brazing temperatures downward,
thus eliminating any need for special
heating-equipment. Because of their rela-
tively low melting point (around 1,150
deg. F.), some silver-brazing alloys would
appear to march off with all honors in
this respect. But their high cost is a
factor that leads many manufacturers to
use higher-melting (1,750 deg. F.)
copper-base alloys.
Temperature also affects the quality of
aluminum brazing. The metal itself has
a low melting point (1,200 deg. F.) and
because most aluminum-base brazing al-
loys melt at only a slightly lower temper-
ature, there is a risk of overheating the
parts to be brazed. Such overheating
causes undesirable changes in the crystal-
line structure of the metal which, unless
corrected by heat treatment, produce a
weak joint.
Recently announced, but not as yet
widely used, is a new aluminum alloy
that melts around 950 deg. F., leaving a
healthy margin between working tempera-
ture and the melting point of the assem-
bled parts.
Magnesium brazing has similar hurdles
to overcome. Developments, however,
that promise to leap many of these hurdles
are expected to be announced before the
year is out. Currently, much of the "braz-
ing" of magnesium is done with a eutectic
alloy. Not thin flowing, and therefore
not usable in snugly fitted joints, this
weld-like alloy does, however, produce an

parts.
Other eutectic alloys are used for bond-
ing steel to cast iron. Because of the
presence of graphite in castings, ordin-
ary brazing alloys have had difficulty
wetting the surfaces to the extent nec-
essary to produce a strong joint. To
overcome this, a process now in use
electrolytical'y removes the graphite from
the surface to be brazed and at the same
time thoroughly cleans it of undesirable
oxides. Once the casting is given this
treatment, standard commercial alloys can
be used for brazing provided their melting
points are not too near that of the casting.
This process promises to revolutionize the
fabrication of many castings, as thin-
walled sections are now brazed on sim-
plified castings, eliminating intricate
foundry coring.
Where the brazing process is automatic,
the application of flux, alloy positioning,
and loading of parts are usually all that
is required of the unskilled operator. Very
often, the alloy is inserted in ring form
around the joint to be brazed. When the
alloy's flow point is reached, capillary
attraction sucks molten metal into the
joints.
When this method of preplacement of
the alloy cannot be used, the alloy may
be inserted as a slug, in foil form, in
specially machined grooves, or in rarer
cases electroplated to one of the parts
to be brazed.
But even where hand-feeding of the
alloy is necessary, design for brazing gives
many products a new competitive look
and provides a simple, easy way of
achieving the productive pace required
to offset painful charges for labor.

automatic troubleshooter
Aircraft engines may develop many
minor troubles that are not, in themselves,
serious enough to prevent their flying.
But commercial airlines have the lives of
their passengers at stake, as well as their
customers' goodwill and the necessity for
making profits. They must put the safe-
ty of the passenger first; but in so doing,
many instances of delayed or canceled
flights have occurred due to some small
but hard-to-find trouble developing in an
engine. This has lost much in goodwill
for the airlines, and much more in money
by keeping an airplane grounded for
long periods of time.
To remedy this to some degree, there
has now been developed by the Sperry
Gyroscope Company, Inc., of Great Neck,
N. Y., an electronic engine analyzer that
is designed to show small faults devel-
oping in the engines both while on the
ground and in the air. This is intended
to be a permanent part of the aircraft's
flight equipment. It will detect flaws in

the ignition performance, such as a
shorted secondary, fouled plugs, large or
small spark gap, no combustion, magneto
mistiming, etc. Also, things such as
"knock," "piston slap," "valve bounce,"
etc., in the engine performance are in-
stantly detected by an examination of the
pattern produced on a cathode ray tube.
The connections to the engine consist
of an engine-driven sine wave generator
that produces one cycle on the horizontal
sweep per two revolutions of the engine,
a magneto-striction vibration pickup at-
tached to the outside of each cylinder wall
to transfer cylinder vibrations to volt
measurement, and a circuit across the
breaker points to pick up the voltage
wave sent to the spark plugs.
Records show that 50 per cent of en-
gine faults can be traced to ignition
faults alone, and this makes the auto-
matic trouble-shooter especially valuable
in airline work. When the ground crew
chief or the flight engineer desires to
check the magneto, spark plugs, or any
of the complex ignition components, he
throws a condition selector switch on the
trouble-shooter. This transfers the spark
coil discharge oscillations (approximately
200 volts) directly into the vertical
sweep of the cathode ray tube and, when
the spark fires once in every two revolu-
tions of the engine, the engine-driven
horizontal sweep will provide a stationary
picture.
From a study of normal ignition pat-
terns and patterns of common faults, plus
a little practice, almost any ignition flaw
can be detected by its effect on the par-
tern. Thus, a certain number of the
periodic checks that used to be necessary-
can be eliminated, and any slight defect
that might spell trouble later on can be
spotted at its onset by the flight engineer.
For a check of any trouble that might
be present in the engine itself, the con-
dition selector switch is set to record the
cylinder vibrations, and another switch
is used to select the cylinders one at a
time. This vibration signal is amplified
and passed onto the vertical sweep of the
cathode ray tube, and again the engine-
driven horizontal sweep is used. Thus,
a complete vibration pattern of the en-
tire four-cycle operation of the engine is
shown as one picture. As illustrated, the
normal vibration pattern consists of a
fairly even oscillation with four high
spots: 1) the closing of the exhaust
valve; 2) the injection of fuel; 3) the
closing of the intake valve; 4) the com-
bustion vibration. If, for instance, the cy-
linder knocks, the combustion vibration
has been found to increase considerably
in amplitude above its normal range.
The electronic engine analyzer repre-
sents a large step along the road to com-
plete airline safety. If widely adopted in
the aircraft industry, fewer lives will be
lost and more flights will be on time. Con-
sequently, the airlines may come nearer
their goal of having passengers arrive at
their destination on time and in safety.

Sigma Rho Tau
Every spring interested members of
Sigma Rho Tau, the Stump Speakers'
Society, train for contests in impromptu,
raconteur, hall of fame, and project
speeches. The local contest winners then
compete with Stump Speakers from other
Sigma Rho Tau chapters at the annual
national convention. This year we had
the privilege of playing host to the na-
tional convention.
Each semester Sigma Rho Tau begins
its activities with a smoker, featuring an
address by a well known engineer or sci-
entist and designed to familiarize inter-
ested student engineers, architects, and
technologists with the advantage of Sigma
Rho Tau membership.
Sigma Rho Tau meeting follows a
unique pattern, one which enables all of
its members to hear contest finals, ex-
change speakers from other chapters,
demonstration speeches by other members,
and certain special speeches. It also gives
every member ample opportunity for
practice by breaking down the main
group into smaller groups or circles.
The circle topics for this semester have
been general speech practice, intercolleg-
iate debates, executive problems, archi-
tectural and engineering developments,
and parliamentary procedure.
Another planned activity of Sigma Rho
Tau is the continuation of the annual
banquets, the Tung Oil Banquet, and the
After Dinner Speakers' Banquet. The
Tung Oil Banquet features a speech by
some outstanding figure in the engineer-
ing field, humorous impromptus by sev-
eral members of the faculty accompanied
by unpredictable ribbings by the Stump
Speakers, and the presentation of awards
to various outstanding members of the
society.
The After Dinner Speakers' Banquet
is much less formal than the Tung Oil
Banquet and every member-guest has a
chance to speak. This year's banquet saw
a mock debate, talks on the use of re-
sources in United States, and a group of
satirizations of society, etiquette and fash-
ions.

AIME
Seeing theory applied in industrial
operations often clarifies many things
which are hazy or incorrectly interpreted.
With this in mind, the AIME has ar-
ranged field trips, set up symposiums,
and invited practicing metallurgists to
give lectures.
Trips to Central Foundry, American
Brass, and the Ford Motor Car Company
were arranged. Central Foundry was of
particular interest because its activities
cover, on an industrial scale, the practice
and theory taught in the foundry course.
The major portion of the malleable cast-
some topic of interest. The first meeting
covered the subjects "What is Tempera-
ture?" and "Corrosion in 18-8 Steels."
Due to the interest displayed, another
meeting is planned. One subject to be
discussed will be "The Sigma Phase in
Steel."
The AIME annual banquet was held
April 15. As guest of honor and speak-
er we were fortunate to have Mr. Walter
Jominy, research head of the Chrysler
Motor Car Corp., who discussed "Selec-
tion of Steels for Automotive Use." Mr.
Jominy clearly demonstrated the import-
ance of cost and the danger of selecting
too good a steel as well as too poor a
steel.
The annual metallurgical engineers'
picnic was held this spring, students and
faculty assembling for a general good
time. S. B.

prof vincenr
The University is indeed fortunate to
have on its faculty Professor Edward T.
Vincent of the mechanical engineering
department. Generally recognized as one
of the nation's foremost experts in the
Diesel engine field, Professor Vincent has
gained an enviable reputation as an
author, educator and a popular instructor
in the College of Engineering.
Professor Vincent has had a wide range
of experience in the engineering field
both in the United States and in Europe.
He was born and spent the early part of
his life in Rochester, Kent County, Eng-
land. After receiving his engineering de-
gree from the Imperial College of Science
and Technology in London, he served an
apprenticeship with the British Admir-
ality. While in this service he became
interested in Diesel engines, and he
worked on some of the first engines to
be installed in British submarines in
1909.
Continuing his interest in the Diesel
field, Professor Vincent used the Whit-
worth Scholarship, which he received in
1915, for further study and research in
basic improvements and refinements of
the Diesel engine. It was at this time
that he first became interested in the
use of Diesel-type engines for aircraft
propulsion. He was later appointed
chief experimental engineer to William
Beardmore and Company, manufacturers
of aircraft engines. This firm developed
the lightweight diesels used in the fa-
mous British dirigible, the R-101. This
company also developed the lightweight
Diesels used by the Canadian National
Railway to make the first Diesel-powered
transcontinental train run in 1925. This
led to the familiar modern Diesel loco-
motives seen on most railroads in this
country today.
Professor Vincent accepted a position
with a west coast engine manufacturer in
1928 and moved to the United States.
Shortly afterward, he moved to Conti-
nental Motors in Detroit where he became
chief engineer in charge of Diesel work.
While at Continental, Professor Vincent
designed Diesel engines for many appli-
cations, including tractors, marine propul-
sion for the U. S. Navy, and power gen-
eration for the Russian government. Pro-
fessor Vincent is still retained by Conti-
nental Motors as a consultant and he says
that this work helps him keep abreast of
modern developments in the field.

Edward T. Vincent
Since moving to Ann Arbor in 1937,
Professor Vincent has been very succes-
ful in applying his experience in the
internal combustion engine field to teach-
ing. He has introduced several new
courses to the University, including de-
sign courses in Diesel engines, aircraft
engines, turbines and jet propulsion.
Professor Vincent is the author of sev-
eral works in his field including "Super-
charging the Internal Combustion En-
gine," which has just been published, and
a forthcoming volume on jets and tur-
bines which he is working on now.
Since his arrival on campus, Professor
Vincent has won popularity through his
participation in various student activities.
He is a recipient of the coveted spoon-
fulcup, traditional symbol of oral finesse.
While reminiscing about his early days
in Ann Arbor, Professor Vincent recalled
that during his first year on the campus
he was a guest at a Sigma Rho Tau din-
ner. Part of the after-dinner festivities
consisted of a "fibber's contest" to see
who could tell the most improbable story.
Unfamiliar with American campus cus-
toms, Professor Vincent decided that
when his turn came the safest thing for
him to do would be to tell a few of his
true experiences in the London fogs. His
story was immediately acclaimed as the
biggest tale of the evening and his fame
soon spread throughout the campus.
Although the University of Michigan
is the first place at which Professor Vin-
cent has ever devoted full time to teach-
ing, he has always been interested in
education. He gained a considerable
amount of experience lecturing and teach-
ing while in England by teaching at the
London Evening Technical Institute and
lecturing to student engineers for the
English General Electric Company.
Professor Vincent holds memberships
in a large number of technical and honor
societies both in this country and in
England. These include Tau Beta Pi,
ASME, SAE, the American Society for
Engineering Education, the Institute of
Mechanical Engineers of Great Britain,
and the British Institute of Automotive
Engineers.
Today, Professor Vincent lives with his
Scottish-born wife in a pleasant house in
southeast Ann Arbor. Every shelf in his
study holds a stack of papers representing
a new engine design, a new course, or a
new book on which he is currently work-
ing. With an eye to the future, Prof.
Vincent predicts that the days of the
high-powered reciprocating engine are
numbered and that within a very few
years jet propulsion will be the common
type of power for transport planes, just
as it is rapidly replacing reciprocating en-
gines in military planes today.

Although the engineering profession is
generally restricted to men, an ever-in-
creasing number of women are entering
that field of study in the various colleges
and universities throughout the country.
The University of Michigan is no excep-
tion in this respect. One charming mem-
ber of the fairer sex who has entered the
ranks of engineers on campus is Helen
Striho.
Helen became interested in engineering
through a course in aeronautics in which
she was enrolled while at Western High
School in Detroit. Upon her instructor's
advice, and lured by two scholarships,
she decided to ignore the stigma against
women engineers; so, she entered the
University to study aeronautical engin-
eering. Helen has proven to be very

HERBERT SMITHUNE, '48E
"Stop the bus!" was probably the most
frequent expression we heard on the
Electrical Inspection Tour. A ringing
"Stop the bus!" could have meant that
one of the camera fans noticed a "terri-
fic view"; but more likely it meant that
someone spied a diner which was inviting
for highly personal reasons.
But these stops didn't last long. Soon
we were on our way and back to our
usual activities: playing bridge, dozing,
snapping pictures, and watching for a
diner. Occasionally we talked over the
places we had visited, and by the end of
the trip there were quite a few to talk
about.
Our first visit was to the Jones and
Laughlin Steel Corporation in Pittsburgh.
There, for the first time for many of us,
we saw in operation such things as a
Bessemer converter, an open-hearth fur-
nace, a rolling mill, and a blooming mill.
While most of the operations were of
interest because they represented stages
in the production of steel, the Bessemer
converter was spectacular enough to be
watched for the shear beauty displayed.
For minutes at a time we were entranced
as the flames shot many feet into the air
and slowly changed hue. Indeed, this
everyday operation was more spectacular
than a display of fireworks. Leaving, we
commonly agreed that a steel plant is not
a tranquil place to visit.
In direct contrast with the steel produc-
tion plant we visited at Pittsburgh was the
R. C. A. Research Laboratory in Prince-
ton, New Jersey. There the aim was to
keep a little aloof from the practical com-
mercial aspect of engineering and try to
push ahead in basic science. It was ex-
plained to us that little development work
was attempted here beyond getting out a
working model of some new idea or dis-
covery.
Among the things we saw at R. C. A.
was an analogue computer about the size
of a door and two feet thick which could
solve immediately ten linear simultaneous
equations. Think of how long it would
take a man to perform such an operation!
Of special interest to the communica-
tion men along on the trip was the full
color television exhibition. The point
was made, however, that the advent of

Herbert Smithline
color television would not render present
black-and-white screens useless. Color
television is composed of three images,
one green, one red, and one blue. By
using one of these images (the green) as
the input to a black-and-white screen,
we get an ordinary black-and-white pic-
ture. Simple, but comforting to black-
and-white screen owners.
Only about two hours away from the
R. C. A. Laboratory is the Lamp Division
of the Westinghouse Corporation. It is
in Bloomfield, New Jersey. Upon entering
the plant we were struck by the profusion
of signs urging the workers to maintain
highest quality work. Coupled with this
was the background music which played
continuously. One got the impression
that the workers did the most exacting
work. Indeed, the proportion of skilled
workers was a good deal greater than is
to be expected in such a large plant.
The reason for this was that most of
the tubes were made on an individual
basis; machines that automatically pro-
duce quantities of tubes were used only
for the smaller, more common types. This
is not to imply that machines were not
used for individual operations on the
large tubes, too. In fact, one of the ma-
chines was interesting enough to merit
further description.
The machine in question was used to
join together two sections of hollow glass
cylinders about four inches in diameter.
The aim was to get one continuous cylin-
der. First, the two sections were aligned
and set into rotation, the ends to be
joined being kept a fraction of an inch
apart. Then a narrow gas flame was
played on the two ends.
As the glass ends became hot, the elec-
trical resistance decreased. At the proper
moment the two soft ends were pressed
together and a high frequency electric
current passed through the glass. The
softer weld section of the glass, having
a lower resistance than the rest of the
glass, used most of the high frequency
power. In this way the electric energy
was directed to the particular area where
it would do the most good.
Of interest, too, were some of the
methods used to test the final products.
To check the degree of vacuum in a tube,
the discharge of a high voltage, Tesla-
type coil was played on the g'ass enve-
lope. If the tube glowed, the internal
presence of air was indicated. Effective
and simple! More familiar was the method
of checking dangerous stress concentra-
tion in the glass envelopes. The stress
was analyzed by means of polarized light.
In the case of opaque tubes, a special
problem was encountered—how could the
tube's internal alignment be checked?
The solution of this problem was found
in the use of X-rays to examine the tube's
interior.
At Westinghouse we learned that X-
rays were being put to an entirely differ-
ent use in industry, or rather, will be
shortly. What is being referred to is the
use of high-speed, X-ray motion pic-
tures to study the internal dynamic
operation of mechanical devices. The
Westinghouse people have made great
strides in perfecting the techniques
for this sort of work. While we were at
Westinghouse, we were permitted to wit-
ness the premier of such a film.
Thus far we have discussed a plant pro-
ducing a raw product, a research labora-
tory, and a plant producing finished
products. Because of the problems in in-
dustrial safety precautions encountered
there, the Eastman Kodak plant in
Rochester will be discussed.
Two aspects of the safety problem are

gested that something was coming from
the cathode which traveled along straight
lines. Hittorf concluded that the glow
was propagated along straight lines.
Little by little, results of the experi-
ments were pieced together. One out-
standing physicist in the field of dis-
charge phenomena, Sir William Crookes,
showed that the rays (which became
known as cathode rays) were capable of
transmitting energy. This is illustrated
in Figure 2. The cathode consists of a
thin spherical surface which focuses the
cathode rays at point b when a discharge
occurs between the two electrodes, a and
c. The platinum disk at b becomes white
hot; if the rays are deflected away, there
is no heating effect.
cathode rays
Crookes, a very able and vigorous ex-
perimenter, finally attracted the attention
of the scientific world. The importance
of the other mens' work in this field
had been badly neglected by influential
scientific circles, and it took a crusader
like Crookes to arouse their interest. In
1879, he was invited to give a lecture on
cathode rays before the British Associa-
tion. In his address, he gave spectacular
demonstrations of all the known proper-
ties of "radiant matter" (cathode rays).
He showed that cathode rays produced
fluorescence, traveled in straight lines,
were deflected by a magnetic field, had
momentum, and transmitted energy. These
demonstrations were taken to substantiate
his verdict that cathode rays were "mat-
ter" and corpuscular in nature. He con-
cluded his address with the following
statement: "In studying this state of
matter, we seem at length to have within
our grasp, and obedient to our control, the
little indivisible particles which, with
good warrant, are supposed to constitute
the physical basis of the universe."
His enthusiasm, however, was not
shared by the majority of English physi-
cists. Their attitude was either apathetic
or hostile. They maintained the study
of cathode rays had no future. When one
wealthy manufacturer, who had given
quite a large endowment to a physics lab-
oratory, was shown a long discharge tube
in operation he remarked: "How beauti-
ful and how useless."
The German physicists, save for Hem-
holtz, were opposed to the corpuscular
idea and adhered dogmatically to Gold-
(Continued from page 7)
stein's ether theory, which generally pre-
vailed in that country.
Rowland's experiment
Before going directly to J. J. Thom-
son's decisive experiment, which settled
the issue, we must consider a seemingly
insignificant but, nevertheless, an impor-
tant experiment by Rowland in 1876.
Rowland performed a very simple experi-
ment to answer a question concerning
which Maxwell was in doubt. In his
Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism,
Maxwell asked the following question:
"Is a piece of matter that is charged
electrostatically and moving with high
speed equivalent to an electric current
moving in a wire conductor?" If so, a
magnetic effect similar to that around the
wire should be produced. Rowland at-
tached strips of tin foil to the outer part
of a glass disk. He then charged the disk
electrostatically and set it into rotation.
When the speed of the disk was suffi-
ciently high a magnet near the disk
was deflected; reversing the direction of
rotation produced deflection in the oppo-
site direction. The answer was yes. This
principle proved to be very important.

The principle that Rowland established
suggested to Hertz, the young German
physicist, a means for testing the corpus-
cular theory. The presence of a magnetic
field should exert an influence on moving
corpuscles. He devised an experiment
where cathode rays were shot between
two parallel plates, one which carried a
positive charge, and the other a negative.
The principles of electricity required that
a charged particle must be deviated while
passing between the two plates. Hertz
was unable to detect any deviation.
Thomson discovers electron
Using improved techniques, J. J.
Thomson proved the existence of the
electrostatic deflection that Hertz had
looked for but had failed to find. Just
previous to Thomson's experiment a
French physicist, Perrin, demonstrated
conclusively that the cathode rays were
negative electricity. Thomson verified
these results and went still further by an-
swering these questions: What are these
particles? Are they atoms or molecules or
matter in a still finer state of subdivision?
He made a series of measurements on the
ratio of the mass of these particles to the
charge carried by it. His experiment was
as follows (see Fig. 3):
"The rays from the cathode C pass
through the slit in the anode A . . . .
After passing through another slit they
travel between aluminum plates about
5 cm long and 2 cm broad and at a dis-
tance of 1.5 cm apart; then they fall on
the end of the tube and produce a narrow,
well-defined phosphorescent patch
At high exhaustions the rays were deflec-
ted when the aluminum plates were con-
nected to a battery of storage cells."
When the plates D and E are at the same
potential the rays strike the fluorescent
screen at a. When a difference in poten-
tial exists, and D is negative, the fluores-
cent spot is deflected to the position b.
The amount of this deflection ab can be
easily calculated.
Assume a stream of identically charged
particles moving to the right between the
plates with a constant speed v. If the
electric field has an intensity F the force
on each particle is Fe (force = inten-
sity x charge). By Newtonian mechan-
ics each particle will then have an accel-
eration of a given by

The force deflecting a stream of electrons
is identical with the force on an equiva-
lent current. From Fig. 4 it can be seen
that f is always perpendicular to both
H and v. Now, since the velocity
is always changing direction so must the
direction of f in order to remain per-
pendicular to ;. The magnitude of f,
however, does not change. From funda-
mental physics, the acceleration of a par-
ticle in uniform circular motion is il-
ways at right angles to its direction of
motion. Consequently, since acceleration
is always proportional to force, the ac-
celeration of the particle in Fig. 4 will
be perpendicular to the path. In order
to fit this condition and at the same time
have f remain constant, the path must
be circular. The radius R of this circle
is expressed in the equation for centri-
petal force

Thomson found the velocity of the
cathode rays by adjusting the magnetic
field to such a value that the magnetic
force Bev was equal and opposite to the
electric force Fe (i.e., by employing both
the electric and magnetic fields and
allowing them to act in opposite directions
in such a manner that there was no net
deflection of the cathode rays or elec-
trons). This value for v was 3.6 x 10T
meters/sec.; substituting the value of v in
Eq (V) he found m/e to be approxi-
mately 10—n kgm/coulomb.
significance
At the time the hydrogen ion was
thought to be the lighest particle that
existed but the value of m/e for the
electron was 1/1000 of the corresponding
ratio for the hydrogen ion in electrolysis.
Of this, Thomson said: "The smallness of
— may be due to the smallness of m
e
or the largeness of e or to a combination
of the two. However, it must be that the
carriers of the charges in the cathode rays
are small compared with ordinary mole-
cules." [Millikan, a decade later, demon-
strated that m was, indeed, very small
when he measured the electron's mass in
his famous oil-drop experiment].
Thus, the year 1897 may be considered
as marking the end of the age-old con-
cept of the atom as an indivisible, un-
breakable entity.

ute. Cutting speed, the circumfential sur-
face speed of the moving element (the
cutter in planing and boring; wood when
turning) is measured in feet per minute
just as in metal cutting practice, and varies
from 3000 fpm for turning and boring to
15,000 fpm when sawing. Feed in feet
per minute ranges from 30 fpm for
finish planing to 120 fpm when rough-
ing. Most planer cuts are shallow to
prevent wasting wood. The depth is de-
termined by the size of stock and the
final thickness desired. Both climb plan-
ing and up planing (see sketch) have
been experimented with. It has been
found that up cutting results in fewer
surface marks and higher power consump-

The above figures concern planing prac-
tice. Some allowances have to be made
when these figures are used for boring
or turning. Boring is generally done at
lower speeds and feeds, and requires
more power per cubic inch removed.
Turning is normally done with a wood
lathe at approximately 3000 fpm.
The angle terminology used on wood
cutting tools follows that employed by
the metal cutting industry. It is illus-
trated in the accompanying sketch. Rake
angles usually vary with the hardness of
the wood worked and range from —5°
to 35°. Wood is resilient and springs
back after the cutting edge passes. Be-
cause of this large relief angles must be
used (15-25° is current practice). As a
result the cutting angle ranges from 80°
to 30°.
These generalizations would make it
appear that everything has been learned
about machining wood, but actually,
much more remains to be discovered and
tabulated. Even more work awaits those
interested in putting the new discoveries
into practice in the wood industry.
As mentioned before, the attitude of
the woodworking industry toward schools
and modern ideas has reversed—today is

How to make handset
4l handles twice as fast!
To meet the tremendous postwar demand for tele-
phones, Western Electric engineers were faced with
the problem of molding 50% more plastic handset
handles per day than ever before. Calling on their
wartime experience, the engineers turned to electronic
pre-heating, which raises the temperature of the phe-
nol plastic from room temperature to 275 degrees
Fahrenheit in just 30 seconds. In this way they cut
press time in half, doubled production, improved the
finish and increased the strength of the handset han-
dles through more uniform heating.

Laboratory precision
in mass production ^
This line amplifier looks like something made in a
laboratory—and destined to spend its life there. Actu-
ally, the amplifiers are mass-produced to lead rugged
lives up poles, down manholes, or in remote repeater
stations along coaxial telephone cable routes. Each
amplifier must boost the volume of as many as 600
voice channels, ranging from 64 kc to 3,096 kc, with
closely controlled characteristics over long periods
without attention. Working out manufacturing
methods and controls that assure uniform perform-
ance of laboratory precision in telephone equipment
is always an interesting project to Western Electric
engineers.
Engineering problems are many and varied at Western Electric, where
manufacturing telephone and radio apparatus for the Bell System is the primary
job. Engineers of many kinds—electrical, mechanical, industrial, chemical,
metallurgical—are constantly working to devise and improve machines and proc-
esses for mass production of highest quality communications equipment.

from the manufacturers, and their stu-
dents are eagerly sought out. The furni-

Michigan, and established scholarships
for training three wood technologists
each year. They have also volunteered
information from the studies of their
individual members and these members
extend their wholehearted assistance and
hospitality to students inspecting their
plants.
Louis A. Patronsky, assistant professor
of Wood Technology, is in charge of the
University's program of research and in-
struction in the machining and utilization
of wood. Professor Patronsky graduated
from the University in 1937 with a mas-
ter's degree in wood technology and
majored in woodworking machinery and
plywood manufacture. He is well trained
in engineering and has had practical ex-
perience in furniture manufacture and re-
pair, building construction, and com-
mercial aircraft design.

would prove valuable to anyone entering
a business even remotely connected with
woodworking. A great deal of knowledge
concerning woodworking practice is
assimilated through contact with wood
technologists and through observation
of their experiments. The research in
these laboratories ranges from work on
glues, stains, and creosoting to machin-
ability and physical properties. One very
interesting project is being carried out by
Philippe Roulier, a French student who
is developing a method for measuring
the sharpness of cutting knives by co-
ordinating the results of microscopic and
profilograph examinations.
Wood technologists are roughly the
equivalent of wood engineers. During
their first two years they study almost the
same technical courses as engineers—
math, chemistry, physics, drawing and
statics. Later they specialize in the test-
ing, properties, use, and processing, of
wood according to the newest discoveries.
They also take some courses in business
administration, accounting, and factory

The Dow-developed Spectrometer with simplified
schematic diagram showing its essential features.
n example of Dow research
This electronic and optical device, called the Direct-reading Spectrometer, is a Dow-developed
instrument which—using photoelectric tubes—measures the relative amounts of different metallic
constituents in a complex alloy.
A tribute to man's intelligence and industry, the Spectrometer was devised to obtain closer control
and more accurate analysis of the magnesium alloys used with such spectacular success in World
War II. For the past three years it has been used in the magnesium alloying plant to make many
thousands of measurements and recordings of the exact concentration of the several metals in an alloy.
An outstanding feature of the Spectrometer is its speed of operation. For instance, only thirty seconds
will have elapsed from the time two magnesium samples are locked into clamps and a spark passed
between them to start the operation, before an analysis can be determined from direct-reading,
rotating dials.
The entire operation is automatic and takes less than 10% of the time required by the Spectro-
graphic method of analysis, which in turn is many times faster than conventional chemical methods
of analysis. This enormous saving of time enables a much closer and more nearly constant control
over melting, alloying and casting of magnesium.
This method eliminates the necessity for photographic and
developing equipment used in Spectrographs analysis, as well
as the opportunity for photographic error possible in the latter
method.
Here is another example of Dow research applied to production
methods. Such research is typical of all divisions of The Dow
Chemical Company ... a company where intelligence and
industry are held in high regard.

No illustrations can do more than suggest the wealth of facilities
at Standard Oil's new research laboratory at Whiting, Indiana.
Here, in one of the largest projects of its kind in the world, there
are provided the many types of equipment needed and desired
for up-to-the minute petroleum research.
The caliber of the men who work here is high. For many years,
Standard Oil has looked for and has found researchers and en-
gineers of high professional competence. Further, the company
has created for these men an intellectual climate which stimulates
them to do their finest work.
And there is nothing new about the idea that motivates
Standard Oil research. It is simply that our responsibility to the
public and to ourselves makes it imperative to keep moving steadily
forward. Standard Oil has always been a leader in the field of in-
dustrial research; the new Whiting laboratory is proof of our
intention to remain in the front rank.

PROBLEM — You're working out the application of a
hydraulic speed selector system to a turret lathe. The
system's oil pump is to be driven by a belt take-off
from the main belt drive. Your problem now Is to
provide a means for transmitting power from the pump
drive pulley to the pump that will permit the adjustment
of the pulley to regulate belt tension. How would
you do It?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER — Use an S.S.White flexible shaft
between the pulley shaft and the pump shaft. As you
see below, that's how the Gisholt Machine Co., did it.
An S.S.White flexible shaft is the logical answer for a
wide range of drives where one or both of the con-
nected members must be adjustable in position.

This it juit one of hundreds of power drive and remote control problems
to which S.S.WHITE FLEXIBLE SHAFTS are the simple answer. That's why
engineers will find it helpful to be familiar with the range and scope of
these "METAL MUSCLES'" for mechanical bodies.

George J. Blanron '09E
Mr. Blanton's first contact with practical engineering, after
taking his degree from the University in 1909, was in the testing
department of General Electric in Schnectady, N. Y. After re-
maining in the testing division for a year, he was employed as
a mechanical engineer in the Power and Mining Department of
GE. After another year he was sent to the Wisconsin District
Office where he remained until the outbreak of World War 1.
This same year his service with General Electric ended and he
entered the Chain Belt Corp. of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as a sales
engineer. His rise in Chain Belt was rapid, and three years after
entering the corporation he was sent to New York as the district
manager of New York State. He was recalled in 1928 to Wis-
consin where he remained until 1945 as Wisconsin district man-
ager. He fulfilled this duty until he retired to devote all his
time to the position of district chief sales engineer for the state
of Wisconsin.
Carl V. Carlson '37E
The period from 1937 until the present was a busy and pro-
ductive one for Mr. Carlson, who graduated from the University
with a degree in Mechanical Engineering 11 years ago. He lost
no time in obtaining a position as assistant chief engineer of the
Howell Co. of St. Charles, Illinois. In 1940 he became chief
engineer of the Pines Engineering Company of Aurora, Illinois.
He remained in Aurora until 1943, when he accepted a po-
sition with the Howard Aircraft Company of St. Charles, also
in the capacity of chief engineer. After only a year, he terminated
his work at Howard and accepted an offer as head of the research
division of Bativia Metal Products of Batavia, Illinois. His pres-
ent position is that of chief engineer for the C. S. Company of
Batavia. His primary duties consist of designing products and
planning the machines needed to produce them.
Knowles K. Madison '25E
A civil engineering degree was to Mr. Madison a stepping
stone to a varied career in the engineering field. Graduating in
1925, he accepted a position with the Washtenaw County Road
Commission as an assistant office and field engineer. Two years
later he left the Washtenaw Commission to perform much the
same type of work in connection with the Wayne County Road
Commission.
Evidently outdoor work appealed to Mr. Madison, for after
eight years with the Wayne County Commission he took a po-
sition as project engineer with the National Park Service in
South Haven, Michigan. He remained in that capacity until 1937,
when he was appointed County Engineer in the Van Buren Road
Commission.
He was next employed as a draftsman with the Commonwealth
and Southern Corporation of Jackson, Michigan. He designed
power house piping and equipment layouts while working in the
employ of the U. S. Rubber Company's Detroit branch and was
soon elevated to supervising engineer of the vulcanizing divi-
sion. He has remained with U. S. Rubber ever since, and at
present he is in charge of the operation, maintenance, and installa-
tion of all vulcanizing equipment.

Research Program Produces Technique
for Tapering Molten Nylon Bristles
Difficult mechanical problems
solved by Du Pont chemists
and engineers to make nylon
paintbrushes practicable
Nylon bristles used in toothbrushes and
hairbrushes are uniform in diameter—
that is, they are "level." But paint-
brushes made from such bristles did
not paint well. Studies of the best natu-
ral bristles showed that they were ta-
pered, so a research program to produce
tapered nylon bristles was started.
Some difficult mechanical problems
were encountered. Level brush bristles
were being made by extruding molten
nylon through spinneret openings de-
signed to produce filaments of perfectly
uniform diameter. A new technique had
to be found to make tapered ones. Since
it was not practical to taper the fila-
ment after cooling and drawing, a pre-
cise taper had to be put in just as the
nylon emerged molten from the spin-
neret. And it had to survive the drawing
operation, in which nylon is stretched
to several times its original length!
Techniques originated In laboratory
The original idea for solving this prob-
lem came from Du Pont chemists, who

worked out the techniques in the lab-
oratory, in the somewhat crude form
represented in the accompanying dia-
gram. It being largely a mechanical
problem, chemical and mechanical en-
gineers were called in to cooperate soon
after the studies got under way. After
further laboratory development, the
engineers put the operation on a pro-
duction basis.
The final result was a highly efficient
process for tapering nylon bristles. As
the molten filament emerges from the
spinneret, pinch-rolls driven by a series
of gears pull it slowly, then quickly.
The size of the filament varies with the
speed of pulling—thick diameters re-
sulting at slow speeds and thin diam-
eters at fast. Next the nylon goes to
the drawing operation, where it is
stretched by rollers to give it strength
and resiliency.
Engineers designed special machines
Following spinning and drawing, in
which many filaments are handled si-
multaneously, the nylon is "set." Then
it goes to a special machine, designed
by Du Pont engineers, which "feels
out" the crests and troughs and cuts
the bristle at these points. This type of
design was necessary because of the un-
avoidable small variations in the length
of individual bristles. Sorting the bris-

ties and sandpapering their ends com-
pletes the process.
Many techniques contributed to the
development of the optimum properties
of nylon in tapered bristles. At the lab-
oratory stage, x-ray studies were made
to learn the effect of various degrees of
crystalization on bristle drawing and
setting. Numerous devices were designed
to test the bristles—for example, a ma-
chine that simulates the abrasive effect
on a brush swept back and forth over a
surface. Even after manufacture was
established, high-speed stroboscopic
photography and other stroboscopic
studies were employed to improve co-
ordination in the various operations
and make a more uniform product.
The development of these bristles
furnishes another striking example of
the great variety of problems, often
intricate, that may arise out of the dis-
covery of a new substance like nylon.

Du Pont. Men with training in mechanical,
electrical, metallurgical, and chemical engi-
neering are required to demonstrate the
practicality of the laboratory findings, in-
cluding small-scale operation of the new
process. Even after the full-scale plant is
operating, development work is continued
to improve efficiency. Write for booklet,

were held jointly with the Michigan sec-
tion of the AIEE.
In addition, AIEE-IRE sponsored i
student technical paper contest, devoting
a portion of one of the meetings to the
presentation of the winning papers for
which lucrative prizes were awarded. The
winners in the undergraduate and grad-
uate divisions were sent to the district
AIEE convention in Des Moines, Iowa,
where they received first honorable men-
tion.
The meetings covering television and
power-generating stations were coordin-
ated with interesting field trips to WWJ-
TV in Detroit and to the Delray Station
of the Detroit Edison Company.
The spring vacation field trip, jointly
sponsored by AIEE-IRE and Eta Kappa

the colorful annual spring banquet at the
Union May 19 which provided a fitting
close to a memorable year. R E H

The regular monthly meeting of the
AIChE was held in the Union March 30.
Plans for a banquet and plant trips
were announced. Dr. J. S. Long, head
of the development department of the
Reynolds DeVoe Paint Company, talked
on "Chemical Engineering Progress in
the Paint Industry." The talk, one
of the best the chapter has had this
year, was well sprinkled with Dr. Long's
humor. Dr. Long is listed in Who's Who
and is one of the top men in the paint
industry.
About 40 of the members went by Uni-
versity bus March 26 to visit the General
Chemical Division sulfuric acid plant. The
majority of these members were seniors
who had just designed a plant of this sort,
and the guides really received the third
degree. The afternoon found the White
Star Refinery in Trenton under the scrut-
iny of this group.
Those who were brave enough to get
up at eight the day after the Slide Rule
Ball went on a plant inspection of the
Pennsylvania Salt Company in Wyandotte.
The guides provided were excellent, and
all of the group enjoyed the trip. One
group enjoyed the plant so much that a
search party had to be organized to find
them. Almost two hours after the planned
end of the tour this group was found, un-
harmed by their experiences. The group
made a trip to Kalamazoo April 30 to
tour the Upjohn Company's plant.
The annual chapter banquet was held
in the Union April 16, preceding the
Slide Rule Ball. Mr. W. L. Badger
talked on his recent European tours,
illustrating the lecture with colored
slides. Mr. Badger was co-author of one
of the first texts on chemical engineering.
He was with the Chemical Engineering
Department here for many years, was
with the Dow Company, and is now one
of the foremost consultants in the field of
chemical engineering.

Synthane • • • where synthane belongs
USES for Synthane laminated plastics
are almost unlimited because of their
combination of chemical, electrical and me-
chanical properties. Synthane is corrosion
and moisture resistant, light in weight,
quickly and easily machined. It is also hard,
dense, strong, one of the best electrical
insulators known. The "set" plastic,
Synthane is stable over a wide range of
temperatures.
An interesting example of Synthane at
work is this jack panel which enables the
broadcast technician to plug in or transfer
amplifiers, microphones, telephone lines or
other equipment, giving the input system
greater operating flexibility. This is an ap-
propriate job for our type of plastics because
Synthane is an excellent electrical insulator,

active on campus, a trait which she ac-
quired as far back as grammar school.
Her extracurricular activities from gram-
mar school, through junior high and
senior high, and into college have varied
all the way from sports, to dramatics and
music.
It was while still in elementary school
that she was introduced to music. There
she picked up a trumpet and blew her
way into the school orchestra. When she
entered junior high, Helen felt that she
had outgrown her trumpet, so she traded
it for a French horn and played that in
the school orchestra.
Helen's interest in sports also got its
start in grade school, but, unlike her
music interest, it has carried right on up
to the present. In grammar school she
participated in the decathlon where she
played tennis, basketball, and softball. In
high school she was a member of the
tennis, basketball, and swimming teams,
and captain of the field hockey team, as
well as a member of the sports staff of the
school paper. A sports enthusiast in
college as well as high school, Helen
played on the Jordan Hall basketball

team in her freshman year, and she is
now a member of the basketball and
tennis clubs.
Dramatics at first took Helen's interest
when she was in junior high school. There
she directed the senior class play. Al-
though she has not done any acting while
in college, Helen has not forsaken dra-
matics completely. Instead she has inte-
grated music and dramatics. While study-
ing modern dancing, she originated a
dance which was later used in a campus
production. She is now a member of the
Modern Dance Club.
Helen has held various student offices
in every school she has attended. While
in junior high she was the secretary of
her senior class. In high school she was
a member of the student council as well
as a member of the aeronautics club. The
fact that she dropped out of school for a
semester in the spring of 1947 did not
slow her up in college activities. In the
fall of 1946 she was the secretary of the
Society of Women Engineers, and in the
fall of 1947 she was a representative of
that body on the Engineering Council.
At the spresent time she is the secretary
of the Engineering Council.
Helen has also taken her share of the
scholastic honors. The American Legion
Award was given to her when she gradu-
ated from junior high school and high
school. She was valedictorian of the class

When FASTENING becomes
your responsibility, remember
this important fact - - -
It costs more to specify, purchase, stock, inspect, req-
uisition and use fasteners than it does to buy them. True
Fastener Economy means making sure that every func-
tion involved in the use of bolts, nuts, screws, rivets and
other fasteners contributes to the desired fastening re-
sult — maximum holding power at the lowest possible
total cost for fastening.
You Get True Fastener Keonomy When You Cut Com The*e Way*
1. Reduce assembly time with accu-
rate, uniform fasteners
2. Make satisfied workers by making
assembly work easier
3. Save receiving inspection through
supplier's quality control
4. Design assemblies for fewer,
stronger fasteners
5. Purchase maximum holding power
per dollar of initial cost
6. Lower inventory by standardizing
types and sizes of fasteners
7. Simplify purchasing by using one
supplier's complete line
8. Improve your product with a
quality fastener.

Just plain Salt! But what wonders
it performs in the hands of expert
chemists and engineers. Its two
components play a big part in the
production of paper, soap, glue,
metals, metal products, textiles,
insecticides. They help to sanitize
water, launder clothing, kill
bacteria in dairies, restaurants,
food plants.
"Miracle-working" with Salt—as
well as other basic chemicals—
has been Pennsalt's business for
98 years. Starting with a modest
plant at Natrona, Pa., Pennsalt
has steadily grown, until today it
stands as one of America's impor-
tant chemical companies.
Big ? Yes . . . but not so big as to
swallow up its promising young
men. Old r Yes . . . but not too
old to adopt young ideas that are

At first, however, being of a somewhat

Purdue. Later yielding, in the fall of
1942 he transferred to Michigan and has
not regretted the change.
He had only a small taste of Michigan
life before being called into the National

duty in South Carolina and Massachusetts.
His next tour of service was overseas with
the Air Transport Command. Upon be-

entering the college atmosphere and in
the fall of 1946 he was back at his stud-
ies. At Michigan he was initiated into

A serious person, he seems to come by
his good grades with relatively little

adapted for basketball and golf, which
he enjoys particularly as extra-curricular
activities (his golf game is in the low
eighties). He enjoys sailing and has
spent many summer days in this sport
on the Upper Niagara River, a few miles
above the Falls.

valuable refractory properties as well
as abrasive qualities. And supplement-

studies and participating in his athletic
interests, Don keeps busy with a job
which fills in the rest of his time quite
completely. As commissary purchaser for
a fraternity house on campus, he has
found that, although it may be good ex-
perience, balancing the cost of food
against a good diet when fifty persons are
concerned can be quite a problem.
Don is not engaged, but confesses to
having been a regular visitor for the past
two years at the Kappa Delta sorority
house.
An overall view of the intricate and
elaborating planning necessary in a mod-
ern factory, gained from summer work
with the DuPont Company and with
Union Carbide in Niagara Falls, aroused
Don's interest in factory problems. A
favored subject with him is time-and-
motion study since he feels that it con-
cerns one of the less technical and more
personal phases of the manufacturing
field. Because of his interest in construc-
tion, he also rates heating and ventilation
as a vital course.
After graduation Don will spend a
very full summer together with his
father. He is going to try his hand it
the construction of a home, the plans for
which have been in the back of his mind
for a long time. He isn't sure where the
time will come from, for his plans also
include a lot of sailing and swimming in
the meantime.
In the fall, he hopes to go into factory
management work somewhere in the
Buffalo area but states that it wouldn't
take much persuasion to induce him to
transfer to California or Florida or some
area with a similar climate.

How to turn a churn
of butter better
Engineers who design creamery equipment have
found that a sure 'way to keep a churn turning smooth-
ly, quietly and steadily is to equip all journals and
countershafts with Timken tapered roller bearings.
Because Timken bearings have true rolling motion
and take both radial and thrust loads in any combina-
tion, the churn drive operates with less power, less
wear, less maintenance. And with Timken bearings,
more effective closures are possible, keeping lubri-
cant in and dirt out.
Why Timken bearings have
true rolling motion
The rollers in Timken bearings really roll. That's
because rollers and races are precisely tapered so that
all lines coincident with their tapered surfaces always
meet at a common point on the axis of the bearing.
This means friction-free operation, minimum wear,
greater precision. It's another reason why 9 out of 10
bearing applications can be handled more efficiently
with Timken bearings.

be taken to protect the plant and per-
sonnel. Early in the manufacturing pro-
cess the Kodak engineers ran into the
problem of controlling the film roller
speed with very great precision. The
bottleneck was to find a tachometer with
which to measure the roller speed to the
required degree of accuracy. The Kodak
Company finally had to design its own
tachometer. The accuracy of the instru-
ment they developed was so great as to
show up the speed variation due to the
gear tooth drive!
Later in the manufacturing process the
film is sensitive to light. For this reason
many of the later processes must be car-
ried out in darkness. (You camera fans
who develop your own film know how
inconvenient that can be). To overcome
the difficulty of working in darkness, the
Kodak engineers have adapted the infra-
red snooperscope to the darkroom.
Still another darkroom stumbling
block was the problem of sparks caused
by static electricity. A single spark

The mechanical Engineering Department emphasizes the fundamental theory, principles
of design, and laboratory experimental work in the field of steam-power, internal com-
bustion and aircraft power, hydromechanical equipment, heating and air conditioning,
refrigeration, automotive, machine design and industrial engineering.
An important phase of the course work is the laboratory instruction in which each stu-
dent has opportunity to study the construction of equipment, to operate it, and to learn
the technique of conducting efficiency and economy tests. The Automotive Laboratory
contains a large number of automotive, aircraft and Diesel type engines, together with
the necessary dynamometers and instruments for test purposes. The Mechanical Labora-
tory contains steam engines and turbines, boilers, air compressors and fans, hydraulic
equipment, a refrigeration plant, and stationary Diesel engines. A Motion and Time
Study Laboratory located adjacent to the West Engineering Building contains projectors,
films and other necessary equipment for detailed studies in the industrial field.

high static charge from being built up
by the moving film.
The developed voltage was dissipated
by means of carefully placed "static bars."
These "static bars" were actual.y wooden
bars from which very fine grounded wires
protruded in all directions. The thought
in mind was to allow the charge to leak
off the sharp pointed conductors before
the potential became high enough to
cause a visible discharge.
The problem of static sparks has a
more serious aspect. There are many in-
flammable chemicals in the air and the
film itself is very inflammable. To protect
the plant and personnel, Kodak has re-
sorted to other safety devices. Ultra-sensi-
tive thermostats are scientifically placed
and carefully checked. These thermostats
are so sensitive that they have, on test,
perceived the heat given off by a man a
mile away!
The atmosphere at critical points is
checked continuously by machine to in-
sure that the concentration of inflam-
mable gases does not reach the combust-
ible range. Should a dangerous concen-
tration develop, warnings are given; and,
AIEE TOUR
(Continued from page 38)
if the warnings are unheeded, the opera-
tion in question will automatically be
shut down.
Interestingly enough, the industrial
problems posed by static electricity was
the topic of a talk we had heard several
days before in New York. Our speaker
then was Dr. Robin Beach and the occa-
sion was our joint meeting with the New
York University branch of the A.I.E.E.
Dr. Beach explained that a spark whose
energy is only one-thousandth of a watt-
second is enough to set off an inflammable
mixture of gas. The spark caused by dis-
charge of a static potential built up in
walking across a heavy rug is about five
times this value. Any moving dielectric
may pick up enough of a static charge
to do the trick. The common offenders
in industry are moving belts and moving
fluids.
In addition to setting off explosive
mixtures, static electricity may cause
trouble by virtue of its attractive quality.
Limbs have been drawn into machinery,
and dielectrics such as paper have become
stuck together. This can be quite trouble-
some in a newspaper press room or in a
paper mill. Static electricity is a formid-
able problem in aeronautics, too, where
it has interfered with radio reception and
many kinds of direction finders. Many
rubber products, in themselves frequent
causes of static sparks, are injured by
static electricity. Rubber is strongly at-
tacked by the ozone and nitric acid
formed when an electric discharge occurs
in air.
Probably the most dangerous aspect of
static electricity is the fact that it is com-
monly overlooked or ignored. In the
opinion of Dr. Beach, many industrial
accidents of unknown source could prob-
ably be traced to static electricity if it
were more widely considered a cause of
trouble.
By now the reader must have obtained
a fairly good idea of what our trip was
like. The sponsors of the trip, A.I.E.E.-
I.R.E. and Eta Kappa Nu, were very hap-
py to offer the trip to those who were
able to go. In fact, the sponsors would
like to invite them and other electricals
to come along on next year's trip.
This is where we get off. "Stop the
bus!"

Because photography can condense...
Tiny as it is, that little rectangle "stage center" is
this ad... condensed by microfilming's magic. Con-
densed yet all there — ready to be brought back to
original size. Photography can reduce—tremendously—
without losing a detail.
As a business or professional man, you can utilize
photography's reducing ability in important ways.
You can utilize it to save space ... to speed reference.
With Recordak microfilming, you can "debulk" files
98% ... keep the film records at hand for quick viewing,
full-size, in a Recordak Reader.
Functional Photography ■«
You can utilize it to make sales presentations more com-
plete, more resultful. With motion pictures, you can
"pack" a plow, a plant, a whole process into a small can
of film . . . travel it where you will. . . show it of! "large
as life" and much more dramatically.
Only a suggestion . . . this ... of what photography
can do because it can condense. For a better picture of
the applicational possibilities that stem from this and
other unique characteristics of photography, write for
"Functional Photography."

GENERAL ELECTRIC
ENGINEER...PHYSICIST...CHEMIST
For each, General Electric has assignments to his liking
General Electric is not one business, but an organ- ates of American colleges and universities are
ization of many businesses, ranging from the finding that the 125 plants of General Electric
building of transformers at Pittsfield, Mass., to offer opportunities to all degrees of specialists, all
the molding of plastics at Anaheim, Cal. Gradu- sorts of enthusiasms, all kinds of careers.

ENGINEER
Quoting Harry Winnc (Syracuse '10), vice president in
charge of engineering policy: "The expansion of General
Electric into new fields and into production of more highly
complex equipment is building an unprecedented need for ex-
ceptionally trained engineers . . . To help meet this demand,
the Company is steadily expanding its Advanced Engineering
Program, under which young G-E engineers can study deeply
into such highly specialized fields as fluid mechanics, elec-
tronics, and electro-mechanical engineering."
PHYSICIST
"Industry is finding need for physicists in fields considered
to be foreign to them ten years ago"—that is the prospect out-
lined by Dr. C. G. Suits (Wisconsin '27), vice president and
director of the G-E Research Laboratory at Schenectady.
Optical studies, high-energy nuclear research, "superconduc-
tivity," magnetic properties, high-frequency currents, physical
metallurgy—these arc but a few phases of the work now being
done in physics by General Electric.


INSULATION CHEMIST
While much of General Electric's research in and
careers in—chemistry centers in the Chemical Department,
numerous chemical projects arc carried on by other of the
Company's divisions. At Bridgeport, Conn., Lyman H. Hitch-
cock (Connecticut, '26) heads up development of such special
insulations as Butyl rubber and Polyethylene. The Company
is a leader in the development and application of both of these
synthetics for insulation purposes.
