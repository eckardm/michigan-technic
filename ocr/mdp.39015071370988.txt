How Welding-
makes Better Furniture

Oxy-acotylene welding lias made this modern
metal chair joint less. The result is smoother
finish, increased durability, added beauty, lower
upkeep, greater strength and lighter weight.
Similarly, in other industries, oxy-acetylene
welding allows great freedom of design, im-
proves countless products and saves money for
thousands of manufacturers.
Tomorrow's engineers will be expected to
know how to apply this modern metalworking
process. Several valuable and interesting tech-
nical booklets describing the application of the
oxy-acetylene process of welding and cutting to
design, construction and fabrication are avail-
able from Linde offices in principal cities. Write

THIS MONTH AND NEXT
With this issue THE TECHNIC begins its 56th consecutive year on
the campus. As a starting feature we have an article, "Engineering as
a Career," by Mr. Fred P. Peters, Assistant Editor of METALS AND
ALLOYS. Not a new title, but the material is rich in interesting and
pertinent facts.
Michigan's State Highway Commissioner, Murray D. Van Wagoner,
has written an article on the future of highway engineering. This is the
first in the '37 '38 series of job-education features that THE TECHNIC
will run. Professor A. D. Moore's Commentaries, rated the best depart-
ment in last year's polls, arc off to a fine start with "Personality Traits."
Next month THE TECHNIC will feature some material on wage
incentive schemes. Inasmuch as some 65% of the engineering graduates
drift into personnel work of some kind sooner or later this material
should be of interest to all. November will also see the first of a new
series aimed at helping those who will soon be interviewed for jobs in
making their selections.

You are the pilot!
Choose worthy electives.
Spcrrystope
TPO those of us in the engineering col-
*• lege today is given the opportunity
to acquire an engineering education dur-
ing a period in which the engineering
profession is coming to be recognized as
a potent force in society. Previous to this
period, engineers worked their solutions
in a quiet little world of their own, leav-
ing the burden of the outer world to
economists and lawyers and politicians
and a whole gamut of reformers. But
slowly our profession outgrew its little
sphere. Twenty years ago a dam affected
a single watershed; a new machine a
single plant. Today engineers tackle a
complete drainage basin and a new ma-
chine alters an entire industry. Two
decades ago personnel relations were the
haphazard efforts of philanthropic em-
ployers: today 65% of the engineering
graduates are involved, after a time, in
some phase of personnel work. And a
Grand Coulee, a unit in a still larger
project, promises to effect 25,000 fami-
lies. There is no doubt: the engineer is
a major factor in our dynamic society.
Let this be taken, not as conceit, but
merely as a statement of fact.
So as students of engineering we
are fortunate. Because we are being
awakened to a realization of our new
position in society: because we can do
much to prepare ourselves for this posi-
tion. But being fortunate is a static
condition, while the task of fitting our-
selves for our jobs in a modern world is
a dynamic one.
Here, at the University, we can begin
to broaden ourselves; to complement an
engineering education with a look-in at
the social sciences. Let us take our non-
technical electives seriously, not to fill
in credit-hours, but to prepare ourselves
for a more useful life in society. Let us
listen to the economics lectures with
more than our usual 10% efficiency. We
who pride ourselves on the scientific
method; would we attempt to solve a
major technical problem if we were un-
prepared? Should we, then, go out to this
new place in society inadequately
equipped to do the work? Shall the
country's engineer-personnel men know
nothing of the social sciences while en-
gaged in work only a hair removed from
that of professional social workers? The
answers to these questions lie with us:
we who are in college.
All the machinery for a splendid edu-
cation is ours for the taking. Our pro-
grams are so arranged that much can be
absorbed beside a working knowledge of
the physical sciences. Two or three hours
per year in broadening electives would
supply a good foundation in literature
or political science or sociology. One
does not expect a graduate engineer to
run up and down a water-power project
quoting Milton, but some understand-
ing of literature will unquestionably be
convenient in a lifetime spent, not in an
undergraduate drafting room, but in a
world of men of many callings. It does
not take long to discover that many of
the men who hold key positions in in-
dustries directly concerned with the en-
gineering profW • fl were graduated
from literary sc^ S , Our contacts with
S%ols.
them, likely to be all-important to our
personal success, are not always the dis-
cussion of the number of B.T.U.'s
needed to run the light plant, but often
something of a social function. It would
be well not to be caught tongue-tied in
a group of non-engineering executives.
Better to have taken an "introduction
to English Literature" than the tradi-
tional "precious stones of Eastern
Montenegro."
Performance as a social animal is but
one reason for wider perspective. It must
be remembered that engineering is a pro-
fession and as professional men it fits us
ill to be narrowly confined in our edu-
cation. The medical and legal profes-
sions, both highly specialized, are now
almost universally preceded by general
literary work. Many of us have neither
the time nor the money for a lengthy
college career, nor is it certain that pre-
engineering work would be practical, yet
there is little doubt as to the value of
undergraduate work of a definite cul-
tural nature.
We are here in an effort to become
useful members of society. We can be
so only if we are understanding members
as well. Comprehension of the effects of
tariffs on trade does not come from
assiduous applications of a log-log trig
slide rule. Our understanding must come
from a serious consideration of the
courses offered us in engineering and
from an equally serious consideration
of electives that will start us toward a
genuine professional career.

ALL OF US cannot help but be inter-
■**&gt; ested in the present national cam-
paign to eliminate automobile accidents
caused by blinding headlights. Startling
facts put forth by traffic experts reveal
the fatalities from night driving. Sixty-
nine per cent of the automobile acci-
dents happen at night, despite the fact
that three-fourths of the cars in circu-
lation are in the garage by 6 p. m. Most
of these accidents have been directly or
indirectly attributed to blinding head-
lights. Every state in the Union is doing
its best to impress the driving public
to have consideration for their fellow
motorist by dimming their headlights
when another car approaches.
Some organizations are going to the
expense of building double lane high-
ways with enough shrubbery in the cen-
ter to shield the flare; almost every
week editorials appear in local news-
papers bearing the caption "Dim Your
Headlights" below which appears a
gruelling account of recent accidents in
the vicinity. It would be almost impos-
sible to rebuild the roads of the nation
to make them safe for night driving,
and there will always be those indi-
viduals who refuse to comply with dim-
ming control already available. So some
more practical remedy of regulating the
light source must be utilized by the
engineer in the very near future to stop
this plague on night driving.
Edison and other inventors have given
the world sources of light, but it is the
duty of scientists today to regulate this
light and direct its movements until it
possesses the most desirable charac-
teristics.
Light consists of two distinguishable
qualities: wave length and wave vibra-
tion. Different colors have long been
produced by controlling the wave
lengths, but it has not been until com-
paratively recent years that any practi-
cal solution has been developed for
controlling the wave vibrations. When
these vibrations, oscillating in planes
perpendicular to the longitudinal propa-
gation, are controlled, the light is said
to be polarized, and the medium per-
forming the polarization is called the
polarizer or polaroid.
This means that polarized light is
light which vibrates in one direction in
contrast to the helter-skelter vibrations
in the ordinary light ray. The best way
to think of this phenomenon is to regard
ordinary light vibrations as a mass of
straws tossed into the wind. They are
blown against a picket fence, and all
straws coming through are lined in
one direction. The picket fence is the
polaroid.
The Eskimos discovered that iceland
spar crystals eliminated glare from the
sea and would enable them to see the
fish below. Such light was polarized.
Laboratories employed this spar or
tourmaline in the form of Nichol
prisms to furnish polarized light; but
being natural crystals, they were small,
inconvenient, and expensive.
It was not until Edwin H. Land,
while an undergraduate studying phys-
ics, discovered a synthetic substance to
perform this operation, that any practi-
cal or commercial possibilities seemed
likely for polarized light. A flexible film
only a few thousandths of an inch in
thickness is formed by suspending
numerous minute artificial crystals in
a cellulosic matrix. Each of these tiny
crystals (1000 billion needles of herapa-
thite to a square inch of film) can

polarize light but not until their hap-
hazard arrangement has been straight-
ened out so that they will lie with axes
parallel. This is done by stretching the
film while still plastic. When all the
billions of crystals have been properly
orientated, the film is optically equiva-
lent to a single large polarizing crystal.
Its crystalline structure is so minute
that it remains invisible at a micro-
scopic magnification of 1100. The film
can be sandwiched into any glass or
other film formation for practical use.
It is this new synthetic development of
the natural phenomena that seems to
furnish the most practical solution to
the current headlight problem.
Automobile manufacturers are mak-
ing numerous tests with the polarizer.
In a paper presented before the Society
of Automotive Engineers, Mr. Land
stated, "The headlight as it is today is
one of the finest achievements in auto-
motive engineering. All the ingenuity
of its design, however, cannot overcome
the basic limitation that light, as we
ordinarily know it, cannot be directed
at an area without being visible to a
person in that area. Not only is the
light source visible, it must necessarily
be blinding because the direct beam is
tens of thousands of times brighter
than the soft diffused light returning
from those areas which the approaching
driver must see. What the problem
seems to call for is a source of light
which is actually bright and powerful,
yet appears weak or extinguished when
it is viewed directly.
In the proposed system, sheets of the
polarizer will be placed behind the
lenses of standard headlight models.
Windshield plates or viewing screens
about the size and shape of windshield
defrosters, will have the polarizer run-
ning in a plane at right angles to the
direction of the polarizer in the lamps.
Both polarizers are in planes 45 de-
grees to the horizontal. The polarizer in
the headlight lens combs out the helter-
skelter vibrations from the bulb so that
all vibrations occur at planes inclined
at 45 degrees to the horizontal. The
polarizer in the viewing screen performs
the same function, but being at right
angles to the polarizer in the lenses of
the headlamps, the polarized light from
the headlights cannot get through the
windshield and the glare is completely
blocked out. The polarizer lines are not
visible and the substance looks like ordi-
nary safety glass.
In comparing the proposed system
with the present beam control, we note
many advantages for the polarizer.
These are shown by the accompanying
table.
Not only can this development be
used by automobile manufacturers, but
it makes three dimensional movies in
full color possible, so that the movie
patrons receive a sensation similar to
that of actual presence in the studio lot.
Pictures seem real not only because of
their depth, but because of their texture
and luster as well, an accomplishment
noticeably lacking in color movies. To
view these movies, the customers wear
comfortable spectacles whose lenses con-
sist of the polarizing material. Such
movies are filmed with a camera having
the lenses as far apart as the eyes. When
the pictures are shown, both views are
projected on the same screen, one over
the other. Without the special glasses,
screen images appear blurred, but with
them, the left eye picks out the image
of one projection while the right eye
visualizes the other projection. The
camera has thus been trained to use two
eyes for seeing instead of one, and the
result of these independent images re-
produces actual vision.
The medical profession has found use
for this filtering glass in diagnosis, en-
gineers employ it in stress analysis; in
fact, more than eight hundred uses have
already been discovered whereby this
development is advantageous.

MURRAY D. VAN WAGONER '21E
MICHIGAN STATE HIGHWAY COMMISSIONER
HIGHWAY engineering is a part of
that great field of public service
which is called civil engineering. Like
it, highway engineering demands techni-
cal competency on the part of the engi-
neer. It requires a knowledge of the
economic and social structure the needs
of which it serves and of the financial
resources which are available to satisfy
them. Naturally, if it is to provide a
career for the engineer and not just a
job, it requires personal qualities of
initiative, intelligence and integrity.
For an engineer so equipped, the field
of highway engineering affords an
almost unlimited opportunity for the
employment of his abilities. Not only
are the services to be rendered and the
problems to be solved by the highway
engineer important in themselves, but
highway administration is developing
new methods and techniques which will
have use and application in other
departments of public service.
It would be hard to over-emphasize
the significance of the role that high-
ways play in modern life. In part, their
service is the same that streets and
roads have rendered since people began
to gather in towns and to move them-
selves and their goods from place to
place over established routes. In part,
it is a new or, at least, an expanded
service which has grown to its present
dimensions during the past generation.
There have always been roads and
streets meeting the needs of local com-
munities, both rural and urban. They
have been and still are the channels
through which the business and social
activities and contacts of community
life are maintained and through which
its services are distributed. In town and
country alike they make the schools,
churches, markets, shops, factories, and
the available public safety and utility
services, accessible to every citizen.
In the cities, the engineer has been
called on to meet a demand for
greatly expanded transportation facili-
ties resulting from the enormously
increased complexity and volume of
urban activities and from the use of the
automobile. Streets designed for a dif-
ferent time are in many places choked
with traffic, and this congestion imposes
delays, confusion and hazards which
cannot long be tolerated.
One does not have to go so far as to
accept Norman Bel Geddes' "City of
the Future" as the only remedy for
these conditions, to see that the high-
way engineer has work laid out for him
if he is to discharge his full responsi-
bility. Currently, remedial measures are
taking the form of increased street
widths and the elimination of grade
intersections of railroads and streets.
Such programs as the State Highway
Department has undertaken on Wood-
ward and Gratiot Avenues in Detroit
and on the business arteries of other
cities, illustrate the proportions and
progress of the job of fitting urban thor-
oughfares for their traffic burden.
Among the people
in rural areas there
is a strong demand
for an ambitious pro-
gram of improvement
on local country roads.
This demand is not
based on any great in-
crease in the service
of or the traffic on
these roads, but prob-
ably arises from an
understandable desire
that the standards on
these local rural roads
shall advance in step with improvements
in other phases of rural life.
The problem involved in the realiza-
tion of this demand is not, in the strict
sense of the term, an engineering ques-
tion. The research engineer has de-
veloped in the laboratory and tested on
the road, low-cost surfaces and treat-
ments which are suited for use on these
highways. The only question is of the
financial resources which will be made
available to do the work, and that fiscal
factor as I have intimated, is often one
with which the engineer will have to
deal and with which he must be familiar.
But the improvement of local-service
streets and roads in town and country
constitute only one part of the highway
engineering field. The highway engineer
is equally concerned with the develop-
ment of a trunk-line system which will
adequately meet the needs of a highway
traffic whose volume and continued
growth is one of the most important
phenomena of our time. From the view-
point of the state highway department
this phase of highway work is the one
which must be given primary considera-
tion.
Our state highway system grew up,

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


together existing systems of local roads
to form continuous routes between dif-
ferent cities and between different sec-
tions of the state. Each of these routes
was designated as a state or a federal
highway, but they retain to this day
many of the characteristics of their
origin.
The local roads were laid out on a
checker board pattern for local service
in the days of horse-and-buggy trans-
portation. They started as pioneer roads
and considerations of economy pre-
vented any very great improvements in
their grade and alignment.
Their inclusion in the state system
did not make any immediate change for
the better. As a matter of fact, the new
concrete bridges and hard surface pave-
ments which were constructed on many
of these roads, often tended to make
bad features of route and design more
permanent and more difficult of cor-
rection.
However, for several years the state
highway department's engineers have
been confronted with the necessity of
transforming what was in many ways a
conglomerate of improved and partially
improved horse-and-buggy roads into a
modern system of highways suitable for
modern automotive transportation.
The conditions which had to be reme-
died were obstacles to the efficiency and
safety of traffic. In the first place, the
sharp curves, which were inherent fea-
tures of the checker-board pattern, had
to be lengthened and eased. As the
speed of vehicles increased, this easing
process has had to be repeated in many
locations and has been supplemented by
the use of super-elevation.
Tn innumerable instances, horizontal
curves were too steep and not only
caused undue deceleration of heavy traf-
fic units, but shortened sight-distance
far below the limits for safe driving.
The correction of such conditions has
entailed a large amount of cutting and
filling and in some cases the relocation
of the line.
These relocations have often served
the added purpose of shortening travel
distance. Indeed, some entirely new
diagonal highways have been built for
the sole purpose of obviating the ineffi-
ciency of the rectangular road pattern
in providing point to point routes.
While all this was going on, opera-
tions were continuously in progress to

Future roads for speed and safety.
Civil EnxinerriiiR
provide for the constantly increasing
volume of highway traffic. The early
pavements were widened from 16 to 18,
and finally to 20 feet. The two-lane
highways were expanded, where the
need arose and as funds permitted, to
three or four lanes. In some locations,
conditions required separate four-lane
roadways for traffic moving in each
direction.
With the increase of traffic it became
necessary to build costly structures to
eliminate grade intersections both with
railroads and with other heavily trav-
eled highways. At the same time, many
new highway bridges were required to
meet the new conditions created by
changes in the grade, alignment and
width of roadways.
Improvement of the physical plant
of the system does not fully meet the
highway engineer's responsibilities. He
is in duty bound to devise means and
methods for protecting the lives of those
who use the highways, and during the
past few years much has been done
both in the study of methods and in the
installation of equipment for traffic
protection.
No matter how much has been
accomplished during past years, how-
ever, in construction, experimentation,
and safety investigation, still more re-
mains to be done. The State Highway
Department now has on file at Lansing
proposals for projects needed to meet
today's traffic requirements, the cost
of which is estimated at more than
$300,000,000. Waiting for fully satis-
factory answers, are questions regard-
ing the best types of design and
construction to meet certain traffic con-
ditions; questions as to the proper
expenditure of motor vehicle revenues;
questions as to the proper balance
between construction and maintenance
activities; and, most pressing of all,
problems of highway safety.
Clearly, the highway engineering job
is by no means finished in Michigan,
and what is true in this state, is true in
a greater or less degree in all parts of
the country.
The work of the highway engineer
has always been carried on in close con-
tact with the other activities of the com-
munity or the state. The value of high-
way service to these other activities has
put a heavy responsibility on those who
provided it. In the future, the responsi-
bility will be even greater, because the
place of the highways in the economic
and recreational life of the people is
growing year by year.
But the engineers who will build and
administer highway affairs will be bet-
ter equipped than in the past. Many
men of fine ability and judgment have
had a part in building the system as it
is today, but they would be the first to
admit that these qualities were not
aways satisfactory substitutes for exact
knowledge of the facts and conditions
of their job.
Today, through the studies being con-
ducted by the Highway Planning Sur-
vey, we are preparing to attack the
accumulated problems of highway
administration with an equipment of
sound factual information such as is

2-ngineetina $5 -&amp; latest
by
FRED P. PETERS
ASSISTANT EDITOR. METALS AND ALLOYS
We are pleased to present, irom Metals and Alloys, another view of
an always interesting subject.
~D ECENTLY a serious-minded, intel-
-*-^- ligent young friend, his studies at
a well known eastern engineering school
one-half complete, sought our advice on
a problem that is all too common today.
"Why," he asked, "should I continue to
study metallurgy when it is apparent
that business holds more promise of an
interesting and profitable career than
does engineering? Engineers as a group
are woefully underpaid. Very few of
them really occupy the high salaried
jobs in industry—the majority never get
beyond the routine unimportant work
thrust upon them in the first few years
after graduation. It seems to me that we
are producing too many engineers for
existing needs and opportunities."
A wholly satisfactory answer to his
question would have to cover a multi-
tude of points — the justice of his
indictment, the value of engineering
education, the demand for trained engi-
neers, salary scales and financial oppor-
tunities in technical fields, the general
future of engineering, etc. Here are
parts of the answer we found in a hur-
ried survey.
ADMINISTRATION
That the plums on industry's tree
have gone, in the past, more frequently
to the business-trained than to the tech-
nically trained, cannot be denied. This
may have been due to management's
underestimation of the value of engi-
neers, to the engineer's frequent will-
ingness to work for love rather than
money, to lack of professional organiza-
tion, etc., but most likely it results from
the engineer's characteristic inaptitude
for other than technical problems and a
rather naive concept of social, economic,
commercial and political conditions,
which has left him incapable of han-
dling large scale enterprises, particu-
larly those involving the general public.
In the last few years, however, owing
to greater general recognition of engi-
neering usefulness and a broadening of
the engineer's training, the engineer has
successfully invaded the field of man-
agement.
Recognition of the administrative
usefulness of engineers is becoming
increasingly widespread. "Business —
our national prosperity, depends more
and more on the efficiency, the smooth
operation of our production machinery.
For this reason more and more of the

engineering training. More and more
are the business owner, the investor and
the banker turning the management of
industry over to the engineer. Again
various studies made by various groups
concur in showing that two-thirds of
the engineering graduates are engaged,
by the time they have been out of col-
lege for 15 years, in work that is pri-
marily executive in character. Also, 70
per cent of all engineers apparently gain
executive responsibility sooner or later
or have it thrust on them. Engineers
have largely become leaders in industry.
And finally to an increasing extent
industries, utilities and public works
are dependent on engineering colleges
for the solution of their technological
problems, as well as those of an admin-
istrative and executive character.
ENGINEERING EDUCATION
The importance of the engineer's
schooling as preparation for an execu-
tive career is obvious, and engineering
education is in general being modified
to meet the new demands placed on its
graduates. The current trend is away
from the narrow, specialized, highly
technical training, toward broader cur-
ricula stressing fundamentals rather
than the finest details of specfic sci-
ences, and including a greater propor-
tion of humanistic subjects like soci-
ology, economics, psychology, history
and English. According to Gilbert E.
Doan, "Industry as a whole would pre-
fer engineering graduates of this well-
rounded type instead of the premature
and narrow specialist which it now
receives, and industry has said so in
no uncertain terms. Since both the schol-
ars and the industrial leaders are agreed
in this matter, the trend is likely to
develop rather rapidly." Elsewhere
Doan presents a forceful, lucid appeal
for liberalized technical education, con-
cluding "it (maximum technical train-
ing without broad mental growth) is
bad for the boys, for the profession, for
industry, and for the nation. The spe-
cialties should be studied later — when
the graduate knows which one of a
thousand specialties he wants, not be-
fore." Potter observes the disappearance
of the specialized technician and his
replacement by a graduate with broad
fundamental technical background and
with greater knowledge of people as
individuals and society as a whole.
"The providing of a background of
engineering knowledge is not being con-
sidered as important as development
of ability to reason logically and to
arrive at truth by observation and
analysis."
The value of an engineering educa-
tion under any circumstances is lauded
by President Compton of M. I. T. and
Dean Kimball of Cornell. According to
their views, a mid-course shift from
business to engineering might be rea-
sonable, but the reverse procedure
would be ill-advised; both believe that
a technical training is excellent prepara-
tion for any career in industry. Says
Compton, "Technological education will
be increasingly recognized as a most
valuable preparation for that large spe-
cial group who themselves develop,
build and operate the world's machin-
ery." And from Kimball, "The engi-
neer's superiority as an administrator,
other things being equal, lies in his
scientific training and his intimate
knowledge of industrial operations.
When to these is added a knowledge of
accounting and finance, the combina-
tion is the very best that can be had
for work in industrial administration of
any kind." Knowles believes it is easier
for the engineer to become proficient in
administrative skills than for one with-
out scientific training to acquire the
latter, while Johnson claims there is no
better foundation for a variety of non-
technical careers (including the minis-
try!) than a broad general engineering
education. It cannot be denied that a
technical training confers mental habits
and attitudes of distinct aid to success
in administrative fields.
SALARIES
We agree with our young friend that
salary scales in technical fields are gen-
erally too low, but we do not concur in
his belief that they are significantly
lower than those obtained by business
men with equivalent (in point of time)
education. In a survey of the engineer-
ing profession recently published by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics the average
annual salaries in 1934 of engineers
that had been out of college were (1)
$4100 for men doing engineering work
for private companies and (2) $3600
for technically educated men doing non-
engineering work; in 1929 these same
men had averaged (1) $5200 and (2)
$6400. For engineers out of college
between 5 and 10 years, average sala-
ries in 1934 were (1) $2400 if in engi-
neering work and (2) $1700 if in non-
engineering work. Although we have no
comparative data for non-technically
educated men, our personal observation
has been that the foregoing averages
are certainly no lower than the incomes
of men that obtained B.A.'s at about
the same time.
The Bureau's figures, of course,
reflect the influence of the depression on
engineering salaries, and they are there-
fore lower than such figures may be a
few years hence. It should be noted,
however, that the men in engineering
fared less badly than did those
employed in non-engineering work
between 1929 and 1934.
The class of 1925 at Worcester Poly-
technic Institute conducted an interest-
ing survey of the income of its members
in the 10 years after graduation. This
showed that the maximum salary (not

from $2500 in 1925 to $4400 in 1932
to $8200 in 1934; minimum from $900
in 1925 to $1500 in 1934 and the
median (20th man on the salary scale)
from $1500 in 1925 to $2200 in 1932 to
$3000 in 1934. These figures agree
roughly with the Bureau's, and show
that even through the depression this
group of young engineers maintained a
generally satisfactory salary level. In
both cases the sharp upturn in 1934
is noticeable. It is to be expected that
engineering salaries in the future will be
higher than for previously comparable
groups, owing to the definite trend
towards "professionalizing" of engi-
neers and the aforementioned increased
recognition of engineering usefulness.
Is there a strong current demand for
engineers, or are we possibly grinding
out technicians faster than industry can
absorb them, profitably to all con-
cerned? President Hotchkiss of Rens-
selaer in a recent article, answers with
an emphatic negative and claims that
industry is eager for all the well-trained
men it can get its hands on. In our own
field we observe today an acute short-
age of metallurgists, so much so that this
June found nearly all the well-known
schools that graduate mining and metal-
lurgical engineers able to achieve 100
per cent placement, with a greater
demand for men than they were able to
fill.
It is hard to see that there are less
opportunities in engineering today than
in recent years, or that the future, in
spite of hesitation in some quarters
induced by political trends, will not
offer an even greater field for service
and profit to the engineer with the
proper training. It would indeed be a
tragedy for any technically inclined
young man to abandon his real interest
because he deems it lacking in career
possibilities. His ultimate success in any
line, of course, will depend on his own
vision, ability and continued study, but
it is certain to be aided rather than hin-
dered by an engineering education.

PERSONALITY TRAITS
STUDENTS who may choose to read
these comments are likely to find a
repeated emphasis given to personality
traits. This is no accident. The writer is
responsible for personnel work with en-
gineering freshmen, and also for the
placement of seniors and graduates of
one of our engineering departments. As
such, he is everlastingly conscious of the
baffling difficulties faced by any gradu-
ate whose personality traits are not ac-
ceptable.
By the time these comments are
printed, the class of 1941 will have gone
through Orientation Period, and will
have been roundly welcomed by every-
one who has been allowed to rise and
"say a few words." Perhaps then, we
may consider that the honeymoon is
over, and that some plain talk to fresh-
men will not be premature. If some of
you are shocked by what you may read
below, count it fortunate that the shock
came early, and while there is time to
do some revising. After all, what young
man has the right to expect to get
through life completely escaping shock
of every kind?
Depending on which freshman you
happen to be, you may be profoundly
upset to learn that with your personality
as is, you are quite acceptable in indus-
try as a non-college man, and quite un-
acceptable as a college man. The business
and industrial world is prepared to ex-
pect and largely forgive, certain wide-
spread shortcomings in the non-college
man. But the man who professes—who
steps right out in public by going to
college—brands himself at graduation,
with a distinction he is expected to live
up to. And the world is rather cold and
unforgiving when it comes to finding
too-obvious shortcomings in the college
graduate. Specifically, one survey made
during the depression found that 60 per
cent or more of unemployed of profes-
sional and semi-professional types, were
unemployed due to personality defects
rather than lack of technical compe-
tence.
Industry does not want, and will not
knowingly employ except as a last resort
in brisk times, a student who would loaf
with his feet on a Union taproom table.
This does not apply to feet getting
hoisted onto a study desk in one's own
room. That desk is your own affair.
But someone else will need the taproom
table for eating purposes.
Industry does not want and will not
knowingly employ, a student who is too
obvious in his gum chewing; nor either
of the two students who go to a movie
and keep up a running conversation
loud enough to be heard by anyone else.
Very definitely, industry has no welcome
for those students who engage in hood-
lumism of the annoying kinds so fre-
quently observable at the movies.
Why not? Because the leaders in in-
dustry—your future employers—know
quite a bit about the decencies and the
good manners needed in those they work
with. They know when they employ a
young college man who displays obvious
breaches of good taste, that they are get-
ting a man who has no consideration for
the rights and feelings of his associates;
and from bitter past experience, they
avoid such people as they would the
plague.
You may wonder how industrial rep-
resentatives can find out such things
about a student. In general, they can-
not. The behaviorisms mentioned above
are observable within college life, in the
mass, but are seldom visible during an
employment interview. Thus it is that a
graduate may carry a concealed bundle
of pestiferous personality traits right
with him into his first job. Then he
slowly reveals himself. And if he has not
used a four-year opportunity in college
to eliminate undesirable traits, it is prac-
tically certain that the next four years
will see little change. At the employer's
first opportunity, such a graduate will
find himself at liberty.
In this column, there is only space to
mention the few gross breaches of good
taste cited above. It therefore directly
applies to but a few of the student body.

SELF-EXPRESSED ENCINEERS
F. A. Merrick, president of Westing-
house Electric, in an article from the
Review of Reviews for April, 1937,
states with sound foresight that the fu-
ture engineer will play a big part in the
administrative branch of industry and
commerce, as well as to continue being
vitally concerned with the four phases
now demanding him, namely, design,
research, construction, and maintenance.
This new role will require a broader
education on the whole for engineers
who will succeed, Mr. Merrick finds. He
further points out the growing necessity
for more public speaking and extended
extra-curricular writing in the training
which the undergraduate engineer re-
ceives in college. Self-expression, notice-
ably lacking in many capable engineers,
must be cultivated and recognized as
being just as important as features of a
technical nature, and the sooner techni-
cal institutions put personality where it
belongs in the engineer's college course,
the quicker will professional engineering
be generally better known for what it
really is, one of the great professions.
THE FACTS OF LIFE
Good marks and social popularity in
college are both apparently predisposing
factors to a high salary later in the busi-
ness world. An analysis of the careers
of some eight hundred graduates of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Department of Business and Engineer-
ing Administration between the years
1917 and 1930, shows the top group in
earning capacity as more likely than
their less successful classmates to have
been fraternity members and to have
had high grades, especially in business
and economic subjects. Moreover, de-
spite the great American tradition, those
who started lowest on the financial
ladder show the least tendency to work
up. The sought-after, scholastically su-
perior man secured the best jobs after
graduation and rose most rapidly, while
those who had the poorest offers at first
remained at a low salary level.

CENTRALIZED RAILROAD
RESEARCH
The Association of American Rail-
roads has recently announced the con-
solidation of Railroad Research. It is
expected that this consolidation will
speed up the conversion of laboratory
data to actual practice. The new divi-
sion will not attempt to take over or
duplicate the research of individual
roads, but will function as a coordi-
nating body. Under centralized supervi-
sion and supplemented by new research
that may seem desirable, current studies
such as those of track stresses and of
rail failures should show new records of
accomplishment in practical application.

AVIATION COMES BACK
The increasing tempo of business re-
covery is well illustrated by the aviation
industry. Aircraft production in the
United States last year was 78 per cent
greater than in 1935. The sales volume,
amounting to approximately 80 million
dollars, was the highest since 1929.
Over 3000 planes were built, and about
one third of these were two place mono-
planes for private owners.
The value of aeronautical exports for
1936 amounted to 23 million dollars, a
bO per cent increase over the preceding
year. Five hundred and eleven planes
were sold abroad.
Aircraft construction is still carried
out on a small scale, as there were 102
companies or individuals that built only
one airplane apiece last year. However,
90 per cent of the the production is car-
ried on by 14 companies.
LIGHT FROM THE SEA
Marine lighting is given a radically
new turn by a device that seemingly
makes electricity out of nothing. This
summer will see the modern yachtsman
dipping his running lights into the ocean,
which will serve as an inexhaustible fuel
supply. The salt in the water sets up
galvanic action between an especially
treated carbon electrode and a zinc
plate. Although it is not a perpetual mo-
tion mechanism, it will produce constant
light for three years without ever being
shut off, as there are no switches or re-
placements. It will be easily adaptable
to any and all lights on the boat—run-
ning, cabin, anchor and binnacle. Other
possibilities are a stationary beacon, a
wharf light, and even use on fresh water,
for a solution of common salt may run
it. There is little doubt that it will revo-
lutionize marine lighting.

DUKE, Reynolds, Green; little did
any of these men who built up the
tobacco industry, even in their wildest
dreams, imagine the importance that
was to come to the cigarette industry.
The backbone of the match industry;
an important factor in the corporations
engaged in advertising and publishing:
an important consumer of the printing,
metal foil, and mositure proof coating
industries: it is the means of support of
hundreds of thousands of men. All this
has been made possible by the develop-
ment of a machine—a machine which
today turns out cigarettes at the rate
of more than a thousand a minute.
Cigarettes were first introduced into
America in 1867. The first ones to be
manufactured in this country were made
by expert rollers imported from Russia.
An expert roller could make about two
thousand cigarettes a day and by 1869
the yearly production had reached nearly
two million. The cigarette machine, in-
vented in 1870, was the work of James
Bonsack. Although imperfect in many
respects it could still produce a hundred
thousand cigarettes daily, thus replac-
ing fifty expert rollers with a single
machine. Because of this unemployment
there was a distinct prejudice against
the machines and consequently against
machine made cigarettes.
Despite the opposition of public
opinion a few of the machines were put
into use, and a few men who were con-
fident of their future kept developing
improvements and correcting errors in
the machine. Although there was a
steady increase in cigarette production,
it was still being counted by millions
per year as late as 1912. It was then,

with the development of a standardized
package holding twenty cigarettes and
with the introduction of new methods of
advertising and selling, that the indus-

Prinring the brand
try came into its own.
Old brands of cigarettes with a local
appeal died out to be replaced with just
a few nationally advertised brands. The
cigarette production curve turned
sharply upward until the industry was
making millions of cigarettes a day in-
stead of millions a year. The rows of
cigarette machines now turn out up-
wards of four hundred millions a day;
pay federal taxes enough to boost North
Carolina into third place in point of
taxes paid to the national government.
Far different from its predecessor of
more than a half century ago, the mod-
ern cigarette rnachjne is bulky, noisy,
efficient. The m^ • e receives properly
cut and blende ^n c0 and spreads
it evenly on ^ to0 vinR belt. The
cigarette paper, which is an inch and a
quarter wide, enters the machine from
a large roll and has the brand name
printed on it at two and three quarter
inch intervals. As the paper moves along
the tobacco is dropped on it from a
conveyor belt and the edges are slowly
forced around to form a cigarette. Just
before the edges are pressed together
the paste is applied to one edge by a
high speed disc revolving in the oppo-
site direction from that in which the
paper is moving. This forces the paste
into the pores of the paper. Thus one
continuous cigarette emerges from this
operation with the brand name printed
on it at proper intervals.
For many years the speed at which
the machine could be operated was lim-

A continuous
cigarette is
formed

ited by the speed at which a cutter
would operate properly. It is necessary
to make a clean cut at right angles to
the longitudinal axis of the cigarette and
in such a position that the brand name
will appear in the proper location.
The earliest cutter was a complicated
device with three blades spaced the
length of a cigarette apart. These blades
were lowered to make three cuts simul-
taneously and at the same time they
moved along in the direction in which the
cigarette was moving and at the same
speed; then they lifted and moved
back to make three more cuts. This
method was complicated, inefficient, and
did not work well at high speeds. It was
replaced during the war by a much
simpler blade. A circular cutting wheel
was mounted on a larger wheel whose
axis was set at an angle such that as
the blade moved through the cigarette
it moved along with the cigarette. This
in turn has been replaced within the
past two years by a still simpler cutter
which solves the problem of preventing
the cigarette from crumpling up against
the cutting blade in the easiest way. It
is done by the simple expedient of re-
volving the wheel on which the blade is
mounted at a speed hitherto believed
impracticable; at the same time making
the blade smaller and the wheel larger
so that the blade requires only an in-
finitesimal time to go through the ciga-
rette. Therefore although the cigarette
is moving at a speed of about three hun-
dred feet a minute the knife makes a
clean cut.
The standard package, holding
twenty cigarettes, which came into use
a quarter century ago has had a great
deal to do with the tremendous growth
possible in the industry. The package is
easily made and filled on large scale
production, whereas a pasteboard box
as used in many foreign countries is
more expensive to make and to fill. Also,
the adoption of an identical package by
all the major companies has made
machinery cheaper.
The package is built up of metal foil
and a paper jacket, and a piston imme-
diately pushes twenty cigarettes into it.
Twenty tiny metal rods, each backed by
a delicate spring, are then forced against
the end of the package. If a rod come,
in contact with a cigarette the right
length, tightly packed, cleanly cut, and
in its proper location an electric contact
is made at the base of the rod. If one of
the rods fails to make this contact the
package is automatically discarded. The
flaps are folded over, sealed with a
revenue stamp, and the transparent
jacket fastened around the package. The
packages are then packed in cartons, the
cartons in cases, and the cases in freight
cars and trucks for immediate delivery.
Thus has one of America's greatest
industries grown up around a machine.
A machine that 65 years ago threatened
to create widespread unemployment but
now gives work to hundreds of thou-
sands. A machine that has grown in 65
years from a small, inefficient rattletrap
to a great smooth-running monument to
the engineer's skill. And with this ma-
chine came an industry producing
134,607,741,000* cigarettes a year and
never failing to progress in size and in
its use of engineering developments.

PATENTS AND TRADE MARKS
A Little Known Phase of Engineering
IN recent years the development of
such products as cellophane, aspirin
and electrical refrigerators has resulted
in a serious problem involving the use
of trade-marks and trade names. An ex-
ample of this is the case of a manufac-
turer who has developed a new product,
assigned to it a trade name and then has
had the name come into common use
for the article. His problem is one of
protecting his rights to the trade name.
Under present laws a new product may
lawfully be monopolized only by patent
and during the patent period. When it
appears that the monopoly of a name
will result in the monopoly of a product
or thing the monopoly of the name is
unlawful and unenforcible.
It would be well at this point to dis-
tinguish between a trade-mark and a
generic name. Some people have the im-
pression that every newly coined word
such as aspirin or cellophane is a valid
trade-mark. This is not true, however.
Such names are analogous to automo-
bile, telephone and telegraph—these
being generic names, not trade names.
Trade-marks are created by what is
known as a "trade-mark use" of a name
or mark and by being the first to do so
for the class of goods in question. A
"trade-mark use" of a name is made
by using it in commerce so that it indi-
cates to observers a particular brand or
make of goods and not the kind of
goods.
Histories of lost monopolies are in
general very much alike—cellophane
probably teaches the most helpful les-
son. Cellophane was the name given to
transparent cellulose sheets invented in
France in 1909 by Brandenburger. He
coined the word as suggesting a trans-
parent substance, made of cellulose and
had it registered as a trade-mark, with-
out giving this new product any other
name. In this manner the first shipments
of the product arrived in this country
labeled as Cellophane, conveying the
meaning that the packages contained
cellophane and not the Cellophane
brand of a new material. Subsequent ad-
vertising featured the word Cellophane,
not as a brand, but as the product itself,
"a superior wrapping material."
In 1923 an American firm took over
the United States business after the
name cellophane had been in use for
twelve years. This company had patent
rights for the manufacture of cellophane
until 1928, thus insuring them a mon-
opoly on the manufacture of the product
but only incidentally giving them a
monopoly on the trade name Cellophane.
This was not because Cellophane was a
valid trade-mark but because the patent
rights cut off competition. As soon as
these patent rights expired other firms
proceeded to manufacture cellophane
and sold it as such. The original manu-
facturers brought suit for infraction of
what they thought was their lawful right
to exclusive use of the word cellophane.
The court handed down a decision which
was, in effect, that since cellophane had
come into popular use as the generic
name of a new substance, it was not a
trade-mark. It did not define a particu-
lar brand of merchandise, which is the
true and lawful function of a trade-mark
or trade name.
Many other examples could be cited
such as the case of the Bayer Aspirin
Company vs. United Drug Company
(272 Fed. 505, 509). A statement from
this decision is as follows: "The single
question, as I view it, in all these cases,
is merely one of fact: What do the
buyers understand by the word for
whose use the parties are contending?
If they understand by it only the kind
of goods sold, then, I take it, it makes
no difference whatever what efforts the
plaintiff has made to get them to un-
derstand more. He has failed, and he
cannot say that, when the defendant
uses the word, he is taking away cus-
tomers who wanted to deal with him,
however closely disguised he may be
allowed to keep his identity."
The steps to be taken in securing ade-
quate trade-mark protection do not
agree with the methods of the sales or
advertising manager. The necessary
popularization of two names, the new
product and the new trade names, takes
much longer than if a single name were
used. The "long-run" point of view is
lost in the desire for present sales and
the opportunity to enjoy a monopoly in
the future is sacrificed for quick results.
The lessons taught by the case of Cel-
lophane and other relatively recent in-
ventions should serve to temper sales
efficiency and advertising with the more
cautious use of trade-marks and trade
names.

the result will be a long period of the

The young man who is entering upon
a career as a highway engineer at the

opment is fortunate. Not only will he

— through his

control trouble-

and tempera-

Years passed—years devoted to ex-

installation. Then, in 1911 Mr. Carrier
disclosed his now-famous Ra-
tional Psychrometric Formulae
to the American Society of Me-

air conditioning was bom.
Overnight, a new industry
came into being — an industry
spreading health and prosperity through-
out the world — and opening new and
unlimited opportunities for engineers.
And these opportunities have steadily
increased—just as the demand for air
conditioning it-
self has stead-

NEW EXHIBIT EXTRAORDINARY
To supplement their old exhibit the
Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation
this summer installed their new exhibit
case in the lobby of the East Engineer-
ing Building. This exhibit is the only
one of its kind in existence. If its op-
eration proves successful, more of them
will be constructed for other colleges.
The Exhibit is divided into commer-
cial gases, synthetic chemicals, carbon
products, and metals and alloys. A but-
ton below each section may be pressed
to give the exhibit additional light and
motion. In the center of the case a
series of pictures showing the uses of
the various products can be started by
pressing a button. Added exhibits for
classroom use may be found behind the
doors in the bottom of the exhibit case.
A. E. WHITE NEW PRESIDENT
OF A.S.T.M.
After serving on the executive com-
mittee for two years and as vice-presi-
dent for two more years, Professor A. E.
White was this June elected President
of the American Society for Testing
Materials. His term of office began July
first and will last one year after which
he will again serve on the executive com-
mittee as is the custom of past-presi-
dents of the A.S.T.M. Professor White
well deserves this high office in view
of his twenty-three years as an out-
standing member of this National So-
ciety. As President of the A.S.T.M.
Professor White does not officially repre-
sent the University of Michigan, but
represents the Edison Electric Institute.
The American Society for Testing Ma-
terials is a national organization com-
posed of between 4000 and 4500 mem-
bers who are representatives of various
consumer and producer groups. This
organization was established in 1902
for the purpose of setting national
standards for the materials of construc-
tion and a large variety of widely used
products.
CAMPUS RESEARCH
Under the supervision of Professor
Benjamin F. Bailey, head of the De-
partment of Electrical Engineering,
some tests are being run to ascertain
the relative worth of various electric
heating elements and to develop better
ones having longer life. These tests are
being made in the shack recently erected
next to the West Engineering building;
they will last six or seven months. The
heating elements used will be automati-
cally turned on and off at specified in-
tervals during the tests by means of a
clock regulator system. Other results
expected from the investigations are the
development of better insulating ma-
terials and more efficient methods of
heat utilization.
NEW FACES OF 1937
Ernest Brater and Avon L. Davis
have joined the faculty of the Depart-
ment of Civil Engineering to fill the
vacancies caused by the resignation of
Professor A. A. Jakkula, who has taken
an Associate Professorship in Struc-
tural Engineering at Texas A. &amp; M., and
by the leave of absence of H. W. King,
who is now making a round the world
tour with his wife.
Mr. Brater, who received his B.S. de-
gree in 1934 and his M.S. degree in 1936
will be instructor in Civil Engineering.
Mr. Davis, who received his B.S. degree
in 1936, is a teaching fellow. He too will
be an instructor in Civil Engineering.
In the Aeronautical Engineering De-
partment E. W. Conlon will replace Mr.
Springer who is on leave to work for
the Department of Air Commerce in
A/,
eu/5
Washington. Mr. Conlon is a graduate
of Massachusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy receiving his B.S.E. degree in 1929.
After four years absence from the
University of Michigan, E. S. Petty-
john returns this year to become an
Assistant Professor. He took his A.B.
degree from the Literary College in 1918
and four years later received his B.S.
and M.S. degrees from the College of
Engineering. From 1927 to 1933, as a
member of the faculty, he worked with
the Michigan Gas Association as assist-
ant and later as Associate Professor of
Chemical Engineering in the Depart-
ment of Engineering Research. Since
then he has been doing sales and devel-
opment work with Leader Industries
and later was connected with the Merr-
vin Building Corporation as Chief En-
gineer. Professor Pettyjohn's work here,
for the most part, will be with unit
processes. Besides being a lieutenant in
the Naval Reserve, his hobbies are
squash and water polo, but most of his
spare time, he admits, is now occupied
by his fifteen month old daughter.

A. D. MOORE'S
COMMENTARIES
(Continued jrom Pas;e 10)
However, no freshman would claim that
he brings here a personality so free from
defect, and so perfectly developed, that
he need give it no further thought. For
everyone, a negative suggestion: observe
your associates to see what they do
that you do not like—then don't do it.
And a positive suggestion: observe those
traits and habits of associates that are
especially liked—and develop them in
yourself.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



More than one industry will
welcome the news of Ameri-
can made monomeric Styrene.
This remarkable material
possesses such a wide range
of applications that its pres-
ent uses represent only a
meager measure of its poten-
tialities.
Technically speaking, mono-
meric Styrene is a water-white liquid that readily
polymerizes (solidifies) into a thermo-plastic
resin of crystal-like clarity.
Due to its high dielectric characteristics it is of
special interest to the great electrical industry —
particularly for insulation in high frequency
equipment.
A similar application is the opportunity to
incorporate monomeric Styrene into varnishes,
thereby giving them the added value of insulation.
There is every reason to believe that Styrene will
mark a new era in the production of optical
equipment. This material is actually more
brilliant than glass—possessing a refractive
index of 1.59 against 1.51 for ordinary glass
and is more transparent than glass.
This marked brilliancy coupled with speedy and
accurate moulding suggests a new, low-cost
method of producing optical lens systems and
similar applications.
The sheer beauty of Styrene in the solid state will,
of course, find it eagerly used for a host of
decorative products and purposes.
Thus progress, as exemplified by synthetically-
made materials, is emphatically emphasized in
Dow's perfection of the process which now
makes monomeric Styrene finally available, on a
low-cost basis, to American industry.

Parker has taken the rust out of
the path of progress for many
manufacturers and, in some cases,
has relieved practically entire in-
dustries of serious rust and finish-
failure problems.
Concentrating on this one subject,
Parker has spent millions of dol-
lars on research, product improve-
ment and customer service. This
investment has been justified many
times over by the many millions
of dollars saved for manufacturers
and their customers.
Manufacturers of automobiles, elec-
tric refrigerators, office appliances,
electrical devices, household appli-
ances, and countless other products
have found Parker processes to
be the most effective method of
rust control and finish protection.
Certainly it is a fact that Parker
Processes stand approved by Amer-
ican industry.
Descriptive literature will be sent
to interested manufacturers, on
request.

MIGHTY MITE

Bill Barclay
When we see Bill Barclay out on the
football field these Saturday afternoons,
leading the Michigan team with all of
his hundred and sixty pounds, we won-
der how a man of his stature can ac-
complish the athletic things he does
around this campus. We also ponder just
how Bill can be such a regular attendant
at practice sessions while being enrolled
in the Engineering College; the Little
Great can't quite explain it himself, but
his record shows he has managed it
somehow.
Perhaps we might say that Bill's
heart just pounded away down there
on Ferry Field to uphold the honor of
the Barclay family because he's actually
a proverbial chip off the old block. His
brother coaches at Flint Northern, and
his sister won the women's state golf
championship this past summer. Bill has
already joined the "M" Club five times
with two emblems in football, one in
basketball, and two in golf. Bill's apti-
tude at taking less strokes around a
golf course than most fellows placed him
in the quarter-finals of the National
Collegiates during his sophomore year,
and he went out this last spring to
reach the semi-finals.
You know Bill was tickled by a pic-
ture taken of himself and his sister
standing beside the golf trophies they
had won. Friends of his from the Ha-
waian Islands to New York, Michigan
to Pennsylvania and West Virginia told
him of seeing his picture in their local
papers but with a "1 didn't know your
sister played golf." She had won prac-
tically all of the trophies in the picture.
The engineers recognized him by
electing him to Triangles. Let us con-
gratulate you further, Bill, and say as
we did to those persistent bugs who
banged against our windshield this sum-
mer, "It has taken a lot of guts to
stick to it, fella."
NEIL
On the long list of contributions of
the engineering college to organized
sports at the University of Michigan is
the name of Neil Levenson. Neil stands
6 feet 2 inches tall, weighs 172 pounds
and captains the varsity tennis team—
to a Western Conference championship
if present plans don't go astray.
Our first recollection of Neil in the
role of an athlete was during the fresh-
man-sophomore games. In that melee he
participated in a game—a form of slow
death—in which two men grasp a
wooden stake and attempt to dislodge
each other. Although considerably out-
weighed, he came out on top with a fine
display of perseverance and intestinal

fortitude—both prerequisites to success
in athletics.
As a freshman Xeil went out for foot-
hall and tennis, gradually switched com-
pletely to tennis
and has been go-
ing strong ever
since. As a sec-
ond love Xeil
prefers the art of
self-expression—
in prep school he
did considerable
work on the
school paper.
Neil Lcvenson Xeil Levenson
departs some-
what from the traditional idiosyncrasies
of the engineering student. He advocates
a closer contact with the students "across
the fence" in the literary college, as a
broadening factor in engineering educa-
tion. He has been active in campus
politics but not as an office-seeker. In-
stead Xeil has consistently taken the
part of the "under-dogv and has stuck
to a platform in which the largest plank
was the choosing of candidates for of-
fice on the basis of character, an admir-
able ideal. To round out his list of cam-
pus activities we find Xeil in Vulcans,
Triangles and on the Honor Council.
Xeil is studying chemical engineering
and will receive his degree in June.

EMPIRE BUILDERS
Man's age-old dream of harnessing the thunder bolts was realized
when in 1882 the first central station went into service. In the period of
swift application of electrical energy which followed, R B&amp;W—then
in business for 37 years—aided materially in developing and furnishing
EMPIRE Brand Bolts, Nuts and Rivets for this now casual necessity
—electrical power.
Since 1845 R B&amp; Whas aided the development of every major in-
dustry—constantly improving materials, machines, processes and prod-
ucts to make EMPIRE Brand Bolts, Nuts and Rivets the standard
of quality, uniformity and precision the world over.
R B &amp; W manufacture a complete line of threaded, upset and punched
products including various types and finishes of Bolts, Nuts, Rivets,

OKONITE insulation with an unsurpassed record
since 1878 is still generally recognized as the
acme of perfection for rubber insulations and as
"the best product possible" of its type.
The Okonite Company and its affiliates, how-
ever, have constantly kept step with the ad-
vances of the electric art.
Whether the wire or cable is large or small,
single or multiple conductor, high or low volt-
age, whether finished with a rubber or a syn-
thetic compound jacket, braid, lead sheath or
armor of any type, Okonite can make it.
In all cases, whether the correct solution calls
for rubber, impregnated paper, varnished cam-
bric, asbestos, glass or the newer synthetic
compounds, the policy still is and will continue
to be the best product possible.

The Photometric Laboratory in the Department of Electrical Engineering has
not only the usual equipment for measuring the performance of light sources,
but also has developed unique facilities for investigating lighting systems using
extended sources—tubes, ribbons, and areas of light such as are employed in
modern "architectural" or "built-in" lighting. Researches made in this labora-
tory have enriched the literature and improved the practice of such lighting,
and much of this special work has been done by students.

IT'S THE "TOPS"
A turbine-generator set now being built at the
Schenectady Works of the General Electric Company
will operate at a pressure of 2500 pounds and at a
temperature of 940 F. This pressure is nearly
1000 pounds more than that used for any other
commercial unit now in service, and the tempera-
ture is higher.
It represents the work of many men. Experts in
mechanical design have solved unique problems —
for the shell of the turbine will have to withstand
pressures equal to those more than half a mile be-
low the surface of the sea. When the unit is com-
pleted, electrical and chemical engineers, metallur-
gists, and research workers will have contributed
knowledge and experience to it.
The design and construction of turbine-generators
such as this is largely the work of college graduates
—many of whom entered G-E Test only a few years
ago. Thousands of other Test men are engaged in
the design, manufacture, and sale of these and hun-
dreds of other electric products that are used in
industry today.

TWO PERMANENT WAVES AT ONCE
Co-eds preparing for a dance are not the only sub-
jects for permanent waving—there is the tungsten
wire used in General Electric lamps.
This wire, 19/10,000 inch in diameter, is first
tightly wound, 335 turns to the inch, with the coils
1/1000 inch apart. After the wire receives this first
'•permanent wave," it is coiled once more, 70 turns
to the inch, with 7/1000 inch between the turns.
This reduces the original 20 inches of wire to a coil
5/8 inch long and having an outside diameter of
310/10,000 inch.
These permanent waves pay real dividends in in-
creased efficiency because tungsten wire becomes
more brilliant as it is more closely compacted. This
new process is only one of many developments made
by G-E engineers in the field of illumination—a
field which offers many opportunities for technically
trained men.

WELDING IN THE ARCTIC
A broken gear wheel recently threatened to shorten
the 100-day working season of a gr°uP of miners on
the Alaskan tundra, above the Arctic Circle. No
time could be lost, for in early September the
ground would be frozen solid.
There was but one chance to save the season's
work. The gear wheel was loaded in an umiak—a
native boat made of skins—and for five days an
Eskimo crew paddled to the settlement of Candle,
where the Arctic Circle Exploration Company had
a General Electric gasoline-driven arc-welding set.
Three hours after their arrival, the Eskimos were
ready to return with the repaired wheel. Instead of
the ruinous loss of a season's work, the interruption
lasted only two weeks.
Opportunities for G-E products to be of service to
industry occur in all parts of the world, and General
Electric has built up an extensive international
organization to meet those needs.

makes Better Piping Systems
Oxy-acetylene welding contributed to the bet-
ter design and trouble-free const ruction of this
intricate piping system. The pipe, bends, re-
ducers, headers and flanges were all made into an
integral welded unit. Every weld will remain
leakproof for the life of the pipe. Welding
stripped the entire system of every pound of ex-
cess dead weight alul made it stronger, sturdier,
more rigid—yet added not one cent of extra cost.
Tomorrow's engineers will be expected to know
how to apply this modern metalworking process
to a wide range of metals—steel and iron, alumi-
num, copper, brass and many other alloys and
metals, including platinum.
Technical booklets describing the application
of the oxy-acetylene process of welding and
cutting are available from any I.hide office.

THIS MONTH, LAST MONTH, AND THE NEXT
Because the printing order was based on last year's sales, last
month's TECHNIC sold out the first day. From now on, we will attempt
to print enough copies to meet the demand.
"Training for Automotive Engineering," by Kenneth A. Meade is
featured this month in our current job series. Professor Worley's
article, "Streamlined Trains." gives you the authentic facts about modern
railroad progress. For the third time in history, our college has changed
deans. See "Professors and Deans." In addition, you will find articles
dealing with iron ore, wage incentives, and television.
Next month, find out what you'll do after graduation—look for
Gus Collatz's impressions of the first few months as an engineering
trainee. Many important engineering personnel men are now writing
articles for our job-education series. Through these men, THE TECHNIC
hopes to help Michigan student-engineers with job problems.

Dean Sadler
Engraved in the lives of two men—
Herbert Charles Sadler, and Henry
Clay Anderson—can be found much of
the history of the College of Engineer-
ing of the University of Michigan. Both,
by a singular coincidence, were born in
the same year, 1872; both came to the
University at the turn of the century,
in 1900.
DEAN SADLER
Herbert C. Sadler received his degree
of Doctor of Science from the Univer-
sity of Glasgow, Scotland. For several
years, he was engaged in practical ship-
building on the Clyde. Later, he was
appointed assistant to Sir John H.
Biles, then Professor of Naval Archi-
tecture at Glasgow University.
In the fall of 1900, the University
of Michigan inaugurated courses in
Naval Architecture and Marine Engi-
neering. Sadler, then 28, took charge.
A few years later, the world-famous na-
val tank was built under his design and
direction. This tank was then, and still
is after 31 years, the only one in opera-
tion by an American university. Dean
Sadler's research work has been widely
published. The international reputation
he won here was recognized, in 1927,
when Glasgow University awarded him
another degree—LL.D. Here also, he
designed the largest passenger ships in
use for inland navigation, and developed
the famous Great Lakes freighter design.
In the field of public service, he was
consultant to the board of U. S. Army
Kngineers for the Mississippi River de-
velopment. During the War, as a result
of his research at the naval tank, he
was responsible for the design of sub-
marines. At the same time, he was
responsible for the design of all mer-
chant vessels then built, as he was con-
sulting Engineer and Architect to the
U. S. Shipping Board. One of his pres-
ent ambitions is a four-day Atlantic
service under the American flag. He is
a member of many well-known societies,
including Sigma Xi and Tau Beta Pi.
Twenty years ago, in 1917, due to his
efforts, the College of Engineering pi-
oneered in the inauguration of courses
in Aeronautical Engineering. From 1904
on, he has been professor of Marine
Engineering and head of that depart-
ment. On April 24, 1928, he was named
Dean of the College of Engineering, an
office which he held until this spring,
when he retired from administrative
duties. However, Dean Sadler's long ca-
reer of distinguished service will not
end, for he has just been appointed
Alexander Ziwet Professor of Engineer-
ing. In this capacity, we know that the
entire student and alumni body will join
the Technic in wishing for him,
through the coming years, the greatest
possible enjoyment of his well-earned
leisure time.
DEAN ANDERSON
A loyal son of Kentucky is Henry-
Clay Anderson, for there he was born,
and there he received his degree of
B.M.E. from the University of Ken-
lucky. No one can deny, however, that
he is also a son of Michigan, for he has
been on the Engineering College faculty
for 37 years.
Ever since 1917, ProfeSsor Anderson
has been the head of ^ Department
of Mechanical Engineer^ i many
years he has had a guiding hand in the
direction of the Michigan Union, and a
half-dozen other campus institutions.
His office has long been a Mecca for
returning alumni, for there they have
always found a cordial welcome. Now
(and since 1933) he is Director of Stu-
dent-Alumni Relations.
Before coming to the University, and
ever since, Dean Anderson has been in-
timately associated with industry. As a
consulting engineer, he has worked on
important investigations, designs, and
appraisals. Dean-Emeritus Cooley was
his associate in this work for many
years. Together they cooperated in con-
sulting practice, and innumerable spe-
cial engineering investigations. In ad-
dition, Professor Anderson has been ap-
praiser or consultant for several dozen
railways, power companies, and other
public utilities. Among these may be
mentioned the Packard Motor Car Com-

"E'OR ages iron has been known and
-*- used by man as a material of con-
struction. Today, its uses in his mech-
anized age are countless, and it is the
basic material for one of the world's
largest industries—the manufacture of
steel. Back of these facts is a very
interesting story of the mining of iron
ore and of the long involved process
this ore must undergo before it can be
used by man. But this leads us to yet
another very interesting story—the
story of the formation and origin of the
iron ore deposits.
Iron is the second most abundant
metal found in nature (aluminum is
first) and forms about five per cent
of the earth's crust. It occurs in hun-
dreds of different forms—in rocks, soil,
plants, and the blood streams of animals
and humans. However, it is called ore
only when it occurs in rock formations
with a high enough iron concentration
to make extraction profitable.
There is no universally accepted
theory of the origin of iron ore deposits,
but it is possible, through a study of
rock formations and configurations of
the earth's surface, to trace the probable
events and the processes which con-
tributed to their formation. This study
reveals that, very early in the history
of the earth, some of the original ele-
ments began to combine to form min-
erals. These minerals existed in a hot
plastic state and, upon cooling, solidified
to form the rocks that form the earth's
crust. These rocks are called igneous
rocks.
There are three different types of iron
ore deposits. One type includes those
deposits that were formed when the
igneous rocks were formed. Another
type of deposit is that in which iron-
bearing materials collected as sediment.
The third type consists of what are
known as secondary deposits, which
were formed by the action of under-
ground water. The last two types are
of the most importance in size in the
United States, and include the ranges of
the Lake Superior region.
When the rains first began to fall on
the newly formed lands, many soluble
compounds of the elements were grad-
ually dissolved. This process was
brought about by upheavals of the land
which broke up the igneous rock, ex-
posing it to the weather. The action of
sun, wind, and water on these rocks for
millions of years slowly decomposed
them, and the iron was dissolved. De-
composition was assisted by the action
of weak acids such as carbonic acid,
formed when carbon dioxide of the
atmosphere dissolved in rain water. The
compounds of iron thus formed were
taken up by the waters and carried over
rocks, down streams, into rivers, and
eventually to the ocean. In the course
of ages, countless tons of this mineral
matter were deposited layer upon layer
to form stratified rocks.
Geological studies have revealed that
at one time the Lake Superior region
was covered by an arm of the ocean.
When the mineral bearing waters
reached this sea that covered the Lake
Superior region, the previously formed
iron compounds floated on or near the
surface for a while and were gradually

the atmosphere. Carbon passed off as
carbon dioxide and ferrous hydroxide
was precipitated in the form of wet
granules. This precipitate mingled with
the vegetable matter at the bottom of
the sea and was buried with it. Some
of it combined with the carbon dioxide
given off by rotting vegetation and be-
came iron carbonate again. Other ma-
terials were also precipitated, and these
mixed with the iron compounds to form
huge iron formations consisting of iron
oxide, silica, quartz, limestone, and
slate. The presence of silica, phosphor-
ous, sulphur, and manganese in iron
ores may be accounted for by this min-
gling of various materials. Large quan-
tities of mud from non-iron bearing
lands were also carried to the sea by
the various contributaries, and some of
the early deposits of ore were buried to
a great depth.
The deposits that were formed in this
manner were the sedimentary deposits.
Ores from these deposits contain about
twenty-five per cent to thirty per cent
iron. They are not mined in the Lake
Superior district, however, because of
the large supply of enriched ore that is
available, containing an average of
fifty-two per cent iron. These enriched
ores were formed through a process
known as secondary concentration. Up-
heavals of the earth's surface raised
much of the mud, slate, and iron forma-
tion above the surface of the water,
exposing the rocks to the weather.
Through the action of the atmosphere,
the iron carbonates were changed to
oxides. Subsequent upheavals again
violently disturbed the Lake Superior
region, and also raised the northern
areas higher than the southern, causing
a slope to the south. After the rocks
had been exposed to the action of the
weather for a long period, further up-
heavals occurred, and the rocks were
again broken up.
The secondary concentration of the
deposits was carried on mainly by the
circulation of underground waters.
Water seeped through the fractured iron
formations until it reached the solid
rock at a depth of anywhere from a few
feet to several hundred feet below the
surface. The waters then began to flow
southward down the slope, picking up
and carrying along much iron from the
iron-bearing rocks along the way.
The iron-bearing waters mingled with
waters containing no iron, but carrying
free oxygen in the form of bubbles. This
oxygen acted on the iron compounds
to form iron oxide, which was precipi-
tated in sufficient quantities to form a
concentrated ore deposit. In other
places, water flowed through sedimen-
tary iron deposits and washed away the
silica and other extraneous materials,
leaving the iron oxide in sufficient con-
centration to constitute an ore deposit.
The Lake Superior deposits were formed
by the combined action of both of the
above processes.
After the secondary concentration
was well under way, the Lake Superior
regions were over-ridden by glaciers
which leveled off the surface and cov-
ered the deposits with a layer called
"glacial drift.'7 The ore deposits in the
Mesaba Range are covered only by this
glacial drift of a depth of from ten to
one hundred and fifty feet. This ore is
mined by the open-pit method. The ore
in the Gogebic Range is covered by a
thick layer of iron formation, besides
the glacial drift. This is due to the
concentration of iron by circulating
underground waters, and necessitates
mining by the underground method.
The ores of the Southeastern part of the
United States consist of only sedimen-
tary deposits, since no secondary con-
centration has occurred. They aver-
age about thirty-eight per cent iron,
and mining is done by means of inclined
shafts, some of which are over a mile
long.
The average iron content of all lake
ores dropped from fifty-five and one-
half per cent in 1902 to thirty-one and
three-quarters per cent in 1910, and has
been maintained since only by mining
increasing amounts of high grade ore
and by washing or screening the re-
mainder. In Minnesota alone there are
forty million tons of ore mined per
year. The state geologist estimates that,
at this rate, the Mesaba Range, largest
of all iron ranges, will be worked out by
1960. It has been estimated that there
are thirty billion tons of ore yet to be
mined in the world. At the present con-
sumption rate of one hundred to one
hundred twenty-five million tons per
year, this reserve will last for two hun-
dred years.
However, it must be considered that
the metallurgical art is constantly ad-
vancing, and what is considered as lean
ore today may be workable ore tomor-
row. Since a large part of the earth's
crust is iron, it is safe to say that man
will always find means to supply him-
self with sufficient iron for his needs.

Metal Industry
"A job is broken down to minute operations."
CAN you watch a man working at a
strange job and tell whether he is
working reasonably hard or merely
loafing? What equipment arrangements
would decrease the fatigue rate for a
given operation? What rest periods are
necessary for men and women perform-
ing various operations? How could you
shift the men to better advantage?
These and similar questions might
sound rather unimportant to the engi-
neer in school. But once that engineer
has been graduated and finds himself,
as so many recent graduates do, becom-
ing acquainted with plant procedure as
an operating foreman the questions be-
come of great importance in his ini-
tial success as an engineer. There is
little question but that a knowledge of
wage incentive systems is of great value
to the engineer. An understanding of it
becomes an asset should he obtain a
supervisory position. As an engineer,
he is admirably suited for wage incen-
tive analysis since he is already well
grounded in the analytical and mathe-
matical method of approach.
Although most companies would prob-
ably give its rooky engineering-foreman-
to be a light breaking-in on some of the
manual labor in his department, it is
rather improbable that he would have
the time to gain enough experience to
answer the above questions and hun-
dreds of others which might and do
arise. Fortunately for these incoming
engineer-foremen, many companies em-
ploy intelligent, systemized wage incen-
tive departments which study and an-
swer questions involving labor efficiency.

of both sexes; and determining a fair
time rate which will adequately com-
pensate the faster worker for his extra
effort.
Time studies are used as the basis for
determining these factors. Time studies
are made by dividing up, or rather
breaking down, a job into a number of
minute operations and timing each
small operation with a stop watch often
conveniently graduated into decimal
units of an hour. The use of decimal
units of an hour greatly facilitates fig-
uring the employees' bonus as the basic
rack where a charged battery will be
put in while he is at lunch. After
lunch he will repeat the process1 in
going to work and he will repeat it
again in reverse when he goes home in
the evening.
In the framing department the melted
fluid soap is mixed with water softeners,
perfume, naphtha oil, et cetera, in the
crutcher and is poured at the draw-off
into frames about 4'x4'xl' which
consist of removable sides and ends
mounted on wheeled bottoms. The
frames containing fluid soap are hauled

after cooling over night, the soap solid-
ifies sufficiently to set and the sides and
ends are removed (stripped) and set up
on clean bottoms. These empty frames
are then hauled back to the draw-off to
be refilled. Thus Jones hauls empties
from the stripping field to the draw-off
and hauls filled frames from the draw-
off back to the cooling field. The two
fields are identical because, as the strip-
ping crews empty a field, Jones puts the
new soap back in the same place. Also
Jones has to furnish the stripping crews
with empty bottoms which he haul;
from the cutting department in build-
ing A.
Assuming that Jones starts by hauling
empty frames—which he hauls in strings
of seven—from the stripping field to
the draw-off, his movements would be
as shown in Table 2.
Jones' rate for filled frames may be
evaluated similarly to give approxi-
mately .04060 hours per frame. At the

Total hours produced 11,5090 hours

One reason is that clean-up produces
nothing salable or profitable yet it is a
constant money-consuming cost, neces-
sary to maintain production schedules
and to promote the safety of the em-
ployees. A second reason is that very
often the clean-up is left to either the
oldest or most ignorant employees work-
ing without adequate supervision.
It is not difficult to clock a janitor
and determine his time for scraping,
sweeping, scrubbing, and mopping va-
rious sized bays and stair-wells. Dif-
ferent standards would naturally have
to be set up for different types of floors
and sizes of bays. The time required
to change scrub water should also be

end of the day Jones' report with his
foreman's OK would be taken by the
wage incentive clerk and would be com-
puted as shown in Table 3.
Jones may be paid his basic wage for
11.509 hours of work or he may be paid
his basic wage for 8.00 hours and an
overtime rate for the 3.5090 premium
hours.
Strange as it may seem, the wage in-
centive system may very profitably be
applied to janitor and clean-up work.
obtained. It would be wise to deter-
mine the time required for a trip to the
store-room as one could check up on a
night janitor who makes a long trip to
the store-room for a mop and steals a
clandestine smoke out on the fire escape.
Incidentally, mere walking is not clas-
sified as very productive labor. Time
studies involving walking require a
fairly rapid pace so that a man cannot
get rich quick by just walking but must
do actual productive labor.
When wage incentive systems are
fairly applied, they will be preferred by
a majority of the employees. The sys-
tem guarantees the largest wage to the
man turning out the most work; it par-
tially eliminates the effect of a fore-
man's prejudice toward an employee; it
places men on jobs most suited to them;
and it produces cooperation between
men working in groups. When a wage
incentive system is unfairly applied it
gives rise to evils too numerous to
mention.
Points in a Good Wage Incentive
System
1. A basic wage rate is guaranteed the
worker regardless of the total hours
produced.
2. Liberal break-in periods are al-
lowed on new jobs.
3. Time studies are made on average
men or on a large percentage of men.
4. Employees are placed on the job
best suited to them.
5. The worker is assured that hn may
earn a bonus of 25-40% regularly with-
out having his standards cut.
6. The time standards set up allow
ample time for good workmanship.
7. The time studies consider all vari-
ables such as times of day, fatigue rates,
climatic conditions, and conditions of
materials.
8. "Machine Efficiency'' rates are
used to figure bonus when mechanical
difficulties arise which are not under the
operator's control.

ENGINEERS AND THEIR EDUCATION

Machine Design
IN 1895 a certain committee of na-
tional scope met, and adopted an In-
tercollegiate Code for academic cos-
tumes. When you next go to Com-
mencement exercises, you will see caps,
hoods and gowns that are still made by
the 1895 patterns. Outward symbols of
the academic life change but slowly, if
ever.
Of profoundly greater importance
was the work of a still earlier committee
—the Committee of Ten, of 1892.
Headed by President Eliot and com-
posed of distinguished men, this com-
mittee of the National Education As-
sociation made and reported upon the
first American study of the curriculum.
"The Committee recommended against
differentiated curricula and considered
the value of studies largely in terms of
their supposed effect in training the
powers of the mind.'' (Quoted from
Dean W. W. Holmes, October 1937,
Journal of Engineering Education.)
By the one act, our academic bodies
were clothed in loose-fitting but rigidly
prescribed academic costumes—doing no
harm thereby. But by the other act,
our academic minds were straitjacketed
for entirely too many years. Certain
studies were required because they
were supposed to discipline the mind—
whether or not the students had any
interest in them; and the introduction
of varied curricula met with opposition.
In 1892 most educators apparently
did not suspect that there are wide dif-
ferences in the interests and aptitudes
of individuals. Today, we know that a
student inclined to the classics is not
usually interested in technical matters.
It is only the exceptional student of en-
gineering who has high aptitudes for the
classics.
People who continue to insist that en-
gineering students should be made to
take a two-year liberal arts course be-
fore they "take engineering," blithely
ignore the fact that these students—
mostly—have no great aptitude for cul-
tural pursuits. It is just as sensible to
propose that, since it is an age of science
in which we live, all liberal arts students
should be immersed in two years of en-
gineering before taking the B.A. degree.
The typical engineering student has
but about four years to give to college.
In no sense does he have an unlimited
time for education. He has to get out
of here, go to work, get married, raise
children, pay taxes, and keep the world
—in a complete sense—moving along.
The simple idea that if some education
is good, a lot more would be better, is
much too simple.
According to wishful thinking, it
would be very nice if the typical engi-
neer were not only much better than he
now is in engineering, but could also be
master of English, one or two foreign
languages, history, and two or three
other assorted fields of liberal character.
As a matter of cold fact, the typical en-
gineer—having much to do—will sel-
dom be master of any of these except
English. His English must be exact, and
such of it as he commands must be suf-
ficient for whatever his purposes may
be. He must master it in both spoken
and written forms. If his aptitude for
English is low, then must he work all
the more diligently to correct the defi-
ciency.
The typical engineering curriculum is
a compromise, like any well-balanced
curriculum. It has a goodly share of
cultural work, a large element of basic
sciences, and a capstone of work of pro-
fessional character. No one item can
properly expand without seriously
shrinking one of the others; and the
burden of proof rests heavily on anyone
who would considerably increase the
total content and length of the cur-
riculum.
The typical engineering student's love
of exactness should cultivate in him a
wish for exact expression. If he is wise,
he will welcome every English course he
is required to take, and will elect some
more in addition. He will not only
learn expression by writing and speak-
ing, but will welcome courses with as-
signed reading; and he will constantly
broaden the scope of his reading, to the
end of his college career, and the end
of his life.
An engineering curriculum is largely
prescribed, but does contain some elec-
tives. The prescribed portion, and the
elective part, should both be considered
for what they really are — minima.
Too many students are willing to be
satisfied with minimum requirements.
The doors are wide open around here.
While you are at it, now is your chance
to go through a few extra doors, at the
least expense, with the least expenditure
of extra time. Have you an aptitude
that is not given full play by anything
in your curriculum? If so, take some
extra work and develop it. An aptitude
might be defined as an urge that wants
to be recognized.
After all, the common factor among
"typical engineering students," is a
group of aptitudes for dealing with the-
ories, facts, materials, forces, and with
combinations of these that are effective.
Beyond such aptitudes, every student
is different from all others. Find your
additional interests, and let them grow.

Front and Rear of Modern Television Set.
AMID the conflicting reports issued
**■ by people who should know some-
thing about television stands the lay-
man, quite bewildered. For many years
now he has heard people say "Tele-
vision is just around the corner." Still,
we have no television. Certainly there
has been much research done. Why so
little progress? The answer lies, pos-
sibly, in the sometimes condemned re-
luctance of the television engineer to
push television on the public, and in
economic problems yet to be hurdled.
The first reason is easily explained
with a bit of history. Some ten years
ago a group of crack-pot, pseudo engi-
neers, who either did not know, or did
not care about the enormous problems
still to be solved, decided that the time
was ripe to place television before the
public. Backed by the circulation seek-
ing "TELEVISION" (American) mag-
azine they carried on a campaign to
popularize television, and incidentally
sell their crude mechanical scanning
disk receivers. The status of television
at that time is best illustrated by the
fact that many radio amateurs (just as
your author) built receivers. For a few
weeks they got a definite thrill out of
watching, several minutes each week,
what the printed program said was a
girl bouncing a ball. After a few months,
however, everybody threw up their
hands and gave television back to the
commercial laboratories. The few sta-
tions that had been broadcasting quit or
went on an erratic schedule; one of the
more prominent inventor-producers shot
himself, and all the receivers went into
attics and junk piles. In England, at
the time, television fared a little better
for a British Broadcasting Company
subsidy allowed broadcasting on a reg-
ular schedule to continue. People not
familiar with this bit of history remem-
ber the television ballyhoo of ten years
back and wonder what is holding up
the show. Engineers, however, remem-
ber the sad fate of television's first
debut and are not willing to allow
"video transmission" (as television is
now called by moderns) to leave the
laboratory until they are sure it will be
accepted.
Because of the wide frequency band
that has been found necessary for the
transmission of even fairly defined pic-
tures (one television station requires a
band width greater than do all the sta-
tions on the dial of a broadcast re-
ceiver) engineers have found it neces-
sary to transmit on ultra-short waves.
Unfortunately, the signals from an
ultra-short wave transmitter can be re-
ceived satisfactorily over an area of
only about twenty-five square miles.
Sad to relate also, it is the fact that at
the present time television cannot be
sent over a land wire to form a chain
of stations like those broadcasters have.
So television now, at least, is a local
affair.
Furthermore, one need only to think
of the small amount of time he spends
with his attention fixed completely on
his radio set to realize that video broad-
casts will never entirely replace oral
presentations. Radio music, news, and
even speeches provides a background
entertainment, so to speak for many
of the things that one does in the home
or in the office, and yet d0es nol require
full attention. Added t0 .,. . the tact
that many people cannot look intensely
for very long without completely fa-
tiguing their eyes.
In this country several laboratories
(Radio Corporation of America, Philo
T. Farnsworth Inc., Philco Radio and
Television, etc.) have developed video
transmission along electronic lines to a
degree that compares favorably with
the definition obtainable in home
movies. The apparatus developed in
this country by Zworykin (R.C.A.) and
Farnsworth (independent) is free of
moving parts. In the second group of
pictures is shown a back view and a
front view of the Philco experimental
receiver. The receivers are as yet quite
complicated and really require the
attention of a technician. The picture
screen, which can be seen on the front
view, is typical. They range in size
from about a five inch diameter to some
twelve or fourteen inches in diameter.
Experts estimate that a receiver of the
type illustrated would cost about two
hundred dollars if manufactured on a
production basis.
So, even arguing without reference
to the admitted technical difficulties,
but purely from an economic point of
view, television is not ready. When will
we have television? When the public is
willing to pay the bill, and at the
present time the bill is too large for
what one could get in return. It is
interesting to note, however, that within
the past three months amateur tele-
vision equipment has again appeared on
the market, and at least three experi-
mental stations are broadcasting regular
video programs.

Chilian Co.
THE engineering college student,
who is trying to make up his mind
about the kind of industry in which he
thinks he is most apt to be successful
and happy, would like to have a set
of very specific rules to follow in com-
paring one field of endeavor with an-
other. However, such measuring sticks
do not exist nor can definite rules be
written. Each employer has his own set
of specifications for new employees
and these are as individual as his choice
of a suit of clothes and change with
changing conditions. One may empha-
size scholastic attainment, another par-
ticipation in all kinds of athletics, while
a third is only interested in the graduate
who, while a student, held the political
destinies of the campus in the palm of
his hand. Most employers are looking
for well balanced combinations of these
achievements.
But the situation that confronts us is
not as hopeless as it appears on the sur-
face. Certain broad sets of qualifica-
tions can be given that fit industry as a
whole. The engineering student who
fulfills these general requirements will
be able to find his place in the automo-
tive industry and set out to achieve
the goal he has set for himself. This is
assuming, of course, that he is physi-
cally and mentally qualified to compete
with others trained in a like manner.
Let us review some of these qualifica-
tions to see what management looks for
when it examines each new crop of
engineering college graduates.
The automotive industry employs
young engineers chiefly in three types
of work—production, engineering de-
velopment, and engineering research.
The engineer in production work must
solve technical as well as human rela-
tions problems. The work of the de-
velopment engineer, while more tech-
nical than that of the production engi-
neer, does require a thorough under-
standing of economic laws and their
application. Research engineers are
looking for and applying technical in-
formation in order to develop new
products and, hence, new industries.
The research engineer's work, therefore
while more highly technical, still in-
volves the solution of economic and
human relations problems to a very
marked degree. The automotive indus-
try is relatively young and, conse-
quently, it gives opportunity to the
engineering college graduate as well as
to the so-called practical man who has
gained all his training through experi-
ence. But whatever the road he has
traveled, he must learn how to handle
problems of human relationships and
understand the forces and materials in-
volved in the design of the automobile.
Since certain phases of the automo-
tive industry are highly technical, the
engineering graduates it absorbs must
have a thorough technical training.
Kach employer will have his own set of
standards by which he judges the extent
and thoroughness of each graduate's
technical background. The specific
branch of engineering in which he has
been trained is usually not so important,
but it is essential that the student ob-
tain a good foundation in the basic
science courses—physics, mathematics,
chemistry, mechanics, etc. This founda-
tion training should be broad in its na-
ture and the undergraduate student
should keep away from too much spe-
cialization. The choice of jobs for the
highly specialized graduate is very
limited while the student who has gen-
eralized has an opportunity to consider
several openings before he makes a final
choice. His chances of future success
are considerably greater.
When the engineering student has ob-
tained the necessary foundation in the
basic sciences and has proven his ability
to think through a problem clearly, he
is ready to start in industry. Upon
graduation he is not a finished engineer,
years of experience in the industry are
required to round out his education. It
is absolutely essential that the engineer-
ing student constantly keep before him
this one point—his formal school train-
ing only fits him to learn to become an
engineer through further training and
experience which must be furnished by
industry. He must be willing to work
hard at any kind of job in which he is
placed and he must always be open-
minded in his attitude toward new ideas
in order to have a chance to succeed.
The most important characteristic of
the successful man, regardless of his
occupation, is his ability to get along

been made of the importance of this
characteristic as compared with techni-
cal training. These estimates vary, but
the average states that the success of
an individual depends about 25 per cent
on technical training and 75 per cent
on ability to get along with the people
with whom he works. When we recog-
nize the fact that more than half of the
men now in important management
positions in the automotive industry
started as engineers of one kind or an-
other, we begin to understand how
important it is for the engineering stu-
dent to develop this characteristic.
What are some indications of the stu-
dent's ability to get along with other
people? How can he evaluate himself
before graduation? If he has been
elected to an honorary society, has been
acti%re in student social activities, espe-
cially if he has held offices of various
kinds, there is a strong indication that
he is a leader and has been popular
among his fellow students. If he gets
along well with people while in school
he is quite apt to continue to do so when
he takes a place in industry. This does
not mean that he should be the "back
slapping" or "yes man"' type to be
popular, but he should be tactful and
friendly in upholding ideas and princi-
ples that he knows are right. So the
engineering student should welcome
every opportunity offered in school to
develop himself along these lines. He
should contact men in industry when-
ever possible to find out what charac-
teristics they have had to develop in
order to succeed.
Most engineers are woefully weak in
their ability to express themselves. Any
engineer should be able to write reports
easily understood by others not neces-
sarily technically trained. He is often
called upon to express himself orally at
professionally meetings. The graduate
will never become a successful engineer
unless he can do both of these things
well.
The average student engineer takes
only those English courses required in
his curriculum. He can seldom see any
need of learning to write or speak while
in school because he believes that by
some queer twist of fate these abilities
will come to him automatically when he
goes out on a job. But ability to ex-
press one's ideas, either formally or
informally, like ability to play a musi-
cal instrument, is only developed
through continued practice and the
undergraduate is indeed wise who makes
the greatest possible use of every op-
portunity offered in school for obtaining
practice in speaking before all kinds of
groups and in writing any kind of article
or report. He should look for chances
to do this sort of thing and not wait to
get this practice after he graduates.
Character development in the engi-
neering student is essential to his future
success. Webster defines character as
the sum of qualities, the stamp of in-
dividuality impressed by nature, educa-
tion or habits. The student who is
completely honest with himself and his
instructors will be honest in his dealings
with his employer and with society as a
whole after he graduates. All any em-
ployer will ask is that his employes use
the "Golden Rule" as their guide in
their dealings with him. Graduates who
follow this rule have developed charac-
ter. Calvin Coolidge once said, "All
our learning and science will be of little
avail unless they are supported by high
character.'' Without such character,
developed through individual decisions
while a student, one cannot have per-
sonality so essential to success. The in-
dividual who has developed character
will not only be a good engineer and
a good employee, but also a good citizen.
We could go on and list other attri-
butes that one finds in the successful
engineer employed in the automotive
industry. A few of these are creative
ability, perserverance, faculty of ob-
servation, enthusiasm and aggressive-
ness, ability to cooperate, health and
personality. But if the student is sure
that he has made the most use of his
opportunities to receive adequate tech-
nical training, has learned how to get
along with other people without being
dominated by them, and has developed
his character to its fullest extent, he
will have the nucleus of most of the
characteristics listed above.
The young engineer should remember
that in whatever field he is given a
chance to prove his worth, the require-
ments are about the same. If he is
willing to cooperate, management of
industry will do all in its power to see
that he has an opportunity to develop
those abilities which have been uncov-
ered in his college work. The ability to
cooperate, a pleasing personality and
hard work are better insurance for fu-
ture success than any list of specific
rules could possibly be.

JOHN S. WORLEY
PROFESSOR OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING
STREAMLINED TRAINS and
"Streamliners," although they came
into being less than five years ago, are
words which have become thoroughly
established in our transportation vocab-
ulary. These trains had their origin in
the thought of furnishing a railway pas-
senger service whereby the railways
could capture the transcontinental pas-
senger business which had been devel-
oped by motor busses. It was quite
evident to the originators of the scheme
that in order to accomplish the purpose,
operating costs must be materially re-
duced and revenues increased. It was
therefore planned to build a train of
light weight to reduce the costs of op-
eration, and one which could be oper-
ated at high speeds with more comfort,
as an inducement to obtain a high load
factor for each trip.
As one of the direct means for re-
ducing train mile costs, the originators
of the scheme seemed to be of the opin-
ion that costs could be greatly reduced
by borrowing the theory of streamlin-
ing from the automotive industry. The
automotive engineers during the recent
preceding years had written extensively
upon the values of streamlining and
had redesigned the bodies of their cars
to enjoy these benefits. In addition to
the design to obtain the least wind re-
sistance the cars themselves were en-
tirely redesigned with reference to their
structural features. Articulated coaches,
the most modern air conditioning, and
a better system of lighting became a
part of the new train. In order to re-
duce the weight, make more effective
the streamlining, and to aid in obtaining
high speeds, the cross section of the first
cars was materially reduced both in
height and width. The original plans
contemplated the use of every possible
available space in providing seats for
the passengers. As one inspected the
first of these trains he was impressed
with the idea that the passengers were
to be packed into the trains and that
there would be very little of convenience
and comfort. No dining car was pro-
vided, all passengers being served in
their seats, from a miniature kitchen.
The trains did not contain any observa-
tion car, club car, or sleeping accommo-
dations as are found on the modern
Pullman car. Further reduction of
weight came from lighter metals and al-
loys which were used. The motive
power consisted of motor driven electric
generators which furnished current for
the propulsion of the train. To reduce
the elapsed time between the termini it
was planned that the Diesel electric lo-
comotives would not be changed at reg-
ular division points as is the practice
for steam locomotives, but would make
a continuous trip from terminus to ter-
minus. At that time no Diesel locomo-
tive had been developed of a size in
excess of 1500 horse power, therefore
the first trains did not consist of more
than the driving unit and three addi-
tional cars. Such a train, with the lack
of comfort, failed, as should be expected,
in capturing the transcontinental motor
bus traffic.
Although the first objective of those
who started to build streamlined trains
was not accomplished, railroad execu-
tives immediately saw a possibility of
recapturing a large amount of passen-
ger travel which had been lost, follow-
ing the advent of the private passenger
automobile and, with this in view, pro-
ceeded energetically with a further de-
velopment and use of the new type of
railway car and train.
One of the new outstanding features
has been a complete redesign of the
structural features of the passenger car.
The heavy I-beam floor sill as a prin-
cipal structural member has been aban-
doned and light weight trusses, as an
integral part of the side of the car, are
now employed. New light weight, alloy
steels have come into use which, with
the new design, have reduced the weight
of the car about 40 per cent. The fal-
lacy and undesirability of having a
passenger car of less than the standard
cross section has been recognized and
that practice abandoned. The new
coaches are now of standard dimensions.
12

they are five inches wider on the inside
than formerly. They are furnished with
the most modern air conditioning equip-
ment, are dust proof, and uniform tem-
peratures can be maintained regardless
of the degree of the outside atmospheric
heat or cold. The spring suspension
has been entirely redesigned which adds
much greater comfort to the riding of
the car. Xew designs of draft gear and
trucks are in the porcess of perfection
which will doubtless be introduced at an
early date. The benefit of trains made
up of articulated units has been thor-
oughly demonstrated but the objec-
tionable features have not been entirely
overcome.
Many standard light weight coaches
of the modern design are being built and
used in trains drawn both by steam and
Diesel electric locomotives. A very great
improvement has been made during the
last three years in the Diesel electric
locomotives in that their horsepower has
been increased from 1500 to 3600.
These locomotives are now powerful
enough to draw 12 to 14 of the modern
light weight coaches, which was the av-
erage length of the crack steam trains
of former days. It seems clear that
further refinement in the design and
equipment of passenger cars and of
Diesel electric locomotives and steam
locomotives is yet to be expected.
The perfection reached in the new-
Diesel electric locomotives is fully illus-
trated in the performance of the two
Denver Zephyrs on the Burlington rail-
road. Each of these locomotives makes
a trip of 1034 miles each night between
Denver and Chicago. There are no
duplicate locomotives to furnish an op-

portunity for them to be removed from
service either for inspection or minor
repairs. They are now entering their
tenth month of operation during which
time only two minor locomotive failures
have occurred. Such a record of per-
formance is far in excess of anything we
have experienced in the operation of
steam locomotives.
The above improvements have per-
mitted the railroads to greatly reduce
their schedule between termini. Prior
to the development of the streamlin-
ers, the shortest time between Chicago
and Denver, a distance of 1034 miles,
was 25% hours. Today this has been
reduced by the use of Diesel electric
driven streamliners to the extent that a
passenger train which leaves Chicago at
5:15 in the evening arrives at Denver

next morning at 8:30. The best schedule
between Chicago and Los Angeles, 2228
miles, was 53% hours, which has now-
been reduced to 39% hours. The fare
in coach passengers is furnished at a
maximum rate of 2c a mile and on some
runs as low as l^c a mile.
In light of the above we should ex-
pect to see a decided change in the rid-
ing habits of the American public. The
new service which the railways are now
offering or will be able to offer in the
near future at low prices should be more
satisfactory than any other form of pas-
senger travel now available. If this is
true then we may expect travelers in
many instances to abandon the use of
their motor cars and use the railway
train.
The future prospects of railway pas-
senger travel from the viewpoint of the
railroad is indeed favorable. In 1920,
the year of largest railway travel in
America, it is estimated the American
public traveled 168 billion passenger
miles. Of this, the railways provided
46 billion passenger miles. By 1935,
it is estimated that the traveling habits
of the public had increased to 459 bil-
lion passenger miles, of which the rail-
ways provided 18 billion. If the rail-
ways are able to furnish a more satis-
factory method of travel, with this
enormous reserve of traveling habit
which has increased several fold since
1920, the railway executives have good
reason to expect that the immediate fu-
ture holds for them a considerable
amount of increased passenger business.

ECONOMIC KNOWLEDGE—A FACTOR IN
ENGINEERING ADVANCEMENT
IT HAS been alleged by many of the
officials of large industrial concerns
that the engineering curriculum in
American universities is "unbalanced."
They have in general found that engi-
neering graduates have an ample tech-
nical training but are lacking in a
knowledge of non-technical subjects.
This accusation undoubtedly seems
pointless to many engineering under-
graduates because constructive sugges-
tions have, as a whole, been rather
meager. A substantial background in
purely cultural subjects—history, re-
ligion, politics and the arts—can hardly
be included in a four year technical
program. Exactly what non-technical
subjects should the young engineer
study to supplement his technical train-
ing? When approached on this question,
several prominent industrial leaders
stated that a working knowledge of
engineering economic principles was of
inestimable value to a man entering the
engineering profession. This is true be-
cause once an industrial plant is set
into operation its success or failure gen-
erally becomes a function of economic
and business considerations rather than
technical knowledge. Of course, the
proposed process must first be devel-
oped; but given one that has been
developed to the state where production
is to be begun, the remainder of the
problem depends upon recognition of
economic and business principles as
they apply to that particular project.
It is the object of this discussion to
briefly outline some of the factors which
must be considered in the planning and
operation of a plant in the chemical in-
dustries in the hope that it will stimu-
late the reader to a more thorough study
of the subject than can be presented
here. The same considerations will hold
to a greater or less extent for industries
where mechanical technology is used.
Between the discoveries of the re-
search laboratory and the profitable
operation of a plant on a commercial
scale lies an extremely important field,
that of process development and promo-
tion. One of the most prolific causes
of business failure in the chemical in-
dustries is neglecting to recognize the
significance of economic factors in tech-
nical development work. Included in
such considerations are patent and
trademark protection. Early as possible
in the development stage a thorough
search of the technical periodical, book
and patent literature should be made.
For facts about trademarks attention is
called to an excellent book by Taulmin1
in which many business failures due to
inadequate trademark protection are
cited. Some material on this subject
was also published in the October issue
of this magazine.
Problems of marketability of the
product to be manufactured, and con-
sumer testing must next be worked out.
Obviously there is no object in plan-
ning an industry for production in a
narrow unstable field or for a declining
market. The wisdom of consumer test-
ing was emphasized by Van Deventer1'
when he said: "There is only one safe
way to determine reliability in service,
and that is to put the product idea into
service. It may, perhaps be safely
marketed in a few months, or even
weeks, after its conception. In the case
of a complicated mechanism, many
months or even years may elapse before
it is advisable to assume the marketing
risk. This is well illustrated in the way
that the General Electric Company, one
of the greatest idea producers, has han-
dled one of its comparatively recent new
ideas. This is the mercury turbine con-
ceived by William Le Roy Emmet of
the General Electric Company and an-
nonuced to the public several years ago.
after its inventor had spent more than
10 years in developing it. For the past
three years this idea has been under-
going its consumer test at the plant of
the Hartford Electric Light Company.
Continuous actual service over a long
period of time and under actual central-
station conditions can alone reveal the
changes that are necessary before this
idea can be marketed." This invention
illustrates the consumer testing that
should be applied to any new idea which
has a technological basis.
The costs entailed in slow and care-
ful development between the research
laboratory and the commercial installa-
tion are always well spent. Hasty plant
construction without intermediate pilot
plants has been another contributing
cause to plant failures. The steps in
this transformation have been clearly
expressed by Whiting! who divides proc-
ess evolution into five definite stages as
follows:
1. Beaker or laboratory stage.
2. Small-sized model.
3. Large-sized unit.
4. Semi-commercial plant.
5. Commercial plant.
The number of these stages is not nec-
essarily fixed, the idea underlying this
conception being that process develop-
ment should progress by easy stages.
An approximate predetermination of
profits is an essential part of process
development. The question "Will it
pay?'' must be answered. Any sound
scheme of estimating production costs,
selling prices and net profits should be
of wide interest. An example of how
inadequate consideration of production
costs resulted in a process failure was
outlined by Becket in his presidential
address before the American Electro-
chemical Society. The following para-
graph is quoted from this article:
"Within the past decade a process for
the extraction of potash from an abun-
dant domestic mineral was devised, con-
siderable preliminary work was per-
formed, the technology of the novel
steps was developed in semi-commercial

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


to one of the companies with which I
am connected. In common with other
processes of the kind, the transition
from potash-bearing rock to a soluble
potash salt offered the major problem,
the solution of which presented the chief
novelty. Hence, most of the money and
effort were expended on the design, de-
velopment and operation of the furnace
in which the rock was decomposed at a
moderate temperature through ingenious
reactions. Good thermal economy and
a high recovery of soluble potash were
attained and were accepted as criteria
of commercial success. The steps sub-
sequent to leaching of the furnaced
product, which were principally washing
and evaporating operation, fretted the
chief technologist and his associates not
at all and had never been carried out
quantitively, on the ground that they
represent "perfectly simple chemical
engineering." Early in our investigation
an estimate was made of the cost of
operating this complete process, based
on the assumption that substantially
theoretically yields would result from
the furnace reactions, and it brought to
light that the cost of evaporating the
necessarily dilute solutions, even by the
most efficient means precluded the com-
mercial success of the promect, if the
average selling prices of the potassium
salt and the by-products were duly con-
sidered. Neglect to estimate the cost
of "perfectly simple chemical engineer-
ing" processes explains the failure of
this enterprise.
After development work has been
completed the question of plant loca-
tion must be answered. For every plant
there is an optimum location—one
which will yield the greatest difference
between total cost and total income.
Therefore a plant should not neces-
sarily be placed where operating costs
are the least but where the total cost
of raw materials, transportation of
materials to the plant, manufacturing,
selling and transportation of finished
products to the market will be a mini-
mum. The principle factors in plant
location have been listed by Mr. Chap-
lin Tyler in his book "Chemical Kngi-
neering Economics":'
1. Source of raw materials.
2. Market for finished products.
3. Source of fuels and power.
4. Source of labor.
5. Transportation facilities.
6. Relation to other industries.
7. Capital requirements.
NOVEMBER, 1937

The electric furnace provides more accurate, and hence more economic control of alloy composition
When the location of a plant has been
decided upon the problem of layout and
design must be attacked. In the chem-
ical industries ample provision for stor-
age and cheap internal transportation
must be provided for because of the
bulkiness of the materials handled.
Plant design has been defined4 as the
arrangement of (1) storage facilities
(2) material-handling equipment and
(3) process equipment, in efficient co-
ordination and with regard for other
factors such as the future expansion of
production, economical distribution of
process steam and power, possible haz-
ards of fire, explosion, fumes and burst-
ing pipes, and the health and welfare
of workers. Here again economic and

economic principles hardly admits of a
complete treatment in the space of a
few paragraphs, but it is hoped that
some idea of the many purely economic
problems, which face the engineer in an
executive position, has been conveyed.

WHAT IS A LIFE-TIME INCOME?
Harold F. Clark in charge of Educa-
tional Economics, Teachers College, Co-
lumbia University, caused some engi-
neers to raise their eyebrows when he
presented, in July, a table of working-
life span and present value of the aver-
age earnings of that life span in selected
occupations in the United States. En-
gineering comes fourth in the list with a
working life span of 43 years and a
present value of average earnings for
that span of $95,300. Medicine tops the
list at 42 years and $108,000 followed
by law and dentistry. College teaching
figures are 44 years, $69,300; skilled
trades 44 years, $28,600; and farm la-
bor (last) 51 years, $10,400.
PROGRESS IN FABRICATION
A new huge low pressure exaporator
has just been constructed and delivered
to the Standard Oil Company of Indi-
ana for the distillation of crude oil. It
is the biggest oil evaporator tower in
existence and was constructed with a
great shattering of records. The best
man to build it, Stanolind found, was
Morris W. Kellogg of Jersey City. From
Lukens Steel Company came the longest
slaps of special steel ever fabricated.
They measured 50 feet long, 10 feet
wide, 2pj- inches thick and were curved
to make a cylinder 15 feet in diameter
and 80 feet high. These slabs were then
welded together and X-rayed to make
sure that every inch of the seams was
perfect.
The big tank was then rolled into a
vast annealing furnace where it was
heated red hot and allowed to cool
slowly in order to remove all the
stresses set up by the welding process.
Since curves, bridges, and tunnels pre-
vented it from being shipped overland,
the big tank was hauled two miles to the
Hudson River where the biggest (250
tons) floating derrick lifted it into the
river. It was towed half submerged
through the Erie Canal and the Great
Lakes to Whiting.
APPRENTICE ENCINEERS FOR
NEW YORK
A system of apprentice engineers in
New York City departments is begun in
a plan prepared for the Municipal City
Service Commission by Paul J. Kern,
member of the commission. The pro-
gram calls for employment of recent
graduates from the engineering colleges
of Columbia, City College, New York
University and Cornell as "cadet'' engi-
neers for the board of transportation.
The plan is initiated to attract young
men of high scholastic ability and to
give them a year of intensive practice
in city work. At the end of sixteen
months apprenticeship the cadet engi-
neer would participate in an open com-
petitive examination on the same terms
as other applicants.
Under the plan the deans of the en-
gineering schools of the metropolitan
universities would be asked to nominate
three candidates and the dean of Cor-
nell one, on the basis of scholastic
standing and preparation for railroad
engineering. The candidates would be
subjected to a qualifying examination
and those passing would be appointed
on a provisional basis at salaries ranging
from $1200 to $1800 a year.
If the plan is successful it is expected
to extend to the other engineering sec-
tions of the city departments.—News
Record, September, 1937.
WHY ENGINEERS GET FIRED
When recently asked wherein it was
found that recent engineering graduates
were lacking in their work, Charles S.
Venable, Director of Research of Ameri-
can Viscose Company answered with
these words: "My chief criticism of re-
cently graduated chemists and chemical
engineers is the inability of the average
man to discard the cap and gown and,
meantime, one has to appoint a com-
mittee to keep some hard headed fore-
man from slugging the educated marvel.
To work effectively with men one must
speak their language—not down at them
but on a level with them. The best ideas
or the keenest calculations are of no
avail unless put into operation. That
requires cooperation with those working
around you.
"The writer doubts as to whether the
defect described above can really be
overcome in a college course. It is
largely a question of experience and
common sense adaptation of the indi-
vidual to his surroundings. However, it
would do no harm for some respected
executives to be called in two or three
times a year to tell the boys that the
ability to get along with one's fellow
men is apt to be responsible for 70 per
cent of one's future success.''—Chemi-
cal Industries, September, 1937.
PROSPERITY PROSPECTUS
The Hamilton Coke and Iron Com-
pany, a wholly owned subsidiary of The
American Rolling Mill Company, last
week put into operation at Hamilton,
Ohio, the first blast furnace built in the
United Stales in nine years. The new
million-dollar furnace adds 500 tons a
day to the company's capacity and its
output will be marketed in the region as
merchant pig iron.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Western Electric

The urge to "make it better" is always there
WHLN you approach old problems with
u fresh viewpoint, you often get out-
standing improvements.
For example: wires for telephone cable
had long been insulated by a spiral wrap-
ping of paper ribbon.
Refusing to accept this as the "last word."'
a Western Electric engineer mixed a wood
pulp solution in a milk bottle—poured it
on a wire—the pulp stuck. The systematic
development of this idea resulted in a new
and more economical insulating process—
making an insulating covering of paper
right on the wire! And the search for ''a
better way" still goes on.
Such originality leads to improved man-
ufacturing processes and better telephone
apparatus for the Bell System.

ATTENTION CIVILS
The civil engineering department is
contemplating a change in curriculum
to be effective next year. Professor Cis-
sel says that this change will give the
civils a freer selection of elective work
in the senior year, and relieve difficul-
ties encountered because of prerequi-
sites. The stumbling block has been
EM-1 so the change will consist of ad-
vancing engineering mechanics to the
first semester of the sophomore year in-
stead of relying upon the summer ses-
sion. Other courses are to be arranged
to allow a greater flexibility of the sum-
mer session. In addition, the new sys-
tem will allow the civils to go to their
summer camp any summer they desire.
At the present time, the system is
merely proposed. The staff, however,
is in favor of the idea.
PROFESSOR BOSTON PRESIDES
Last month Professor Boston jour-
neyed to Grand Rapids to preside at
the meeting of the Wood Industries Di-
vision of the A.S.M.E. at which he pre-
sented two papers on the machine-
ability of wood. The research of one
paper was done in the Metal Processing
Laboratory of the college. This meet-
ing was the first devoted to machining
properties of wood. A great deal of in-
terest was aroused which, it is hoped,
will sponsor further work of this nature.
MICHIGAN GETS FULL APPROVAL

The purpose of accrediting colleges
as stated in the Council's report, " . . .
shall be to identify those institutions
which offer professional curricula in en-
gineering worthy of recognition as
such."
The basis on which the curricula of a
college is accredited is both qualitative
and quantitative. The qualitative con-
siderations take into account:
Faculty fitness.
Standards of instruction.
Scholastic work of students.
Record of graduates.
Attitude of administration.
The quantitative accrediting is based on:
Curricula and degrees offered.
Age of college.
Requirements for admission.
Graduation requirements.
Teaching staff and load.
Enrollment.
Buildings and equipment.
Financial status.
The Council accredits colleges only
upon their request. The lists of accred-
ited curricula are to be revised yearly
to take care of any improvements made
by colleges seeking to be approved bv
the E.C.P.D.
GIFTS FOR METAL PROCESSORS
An electric melting furnace, two
Johanssen gauge blocks, a Detiert sand
testing machine and a spiral bevel gear
generator are recent gifts to the Metal
Processing Department.
Through the courtesy of Charles
Baird, a former student now associated
with the Detroit Electric Company, the
Department has received an electric
melting furnace valued at approximately
$800.00. This furnace, having three
shells, is being used for melting ferrous
and non-ferrous metals. It is now in
the process of operation and favorable
tests involving melting practice of high
speed steel have been obtained.
The Ford Motor Company has re-
cently checked the set of Johanssen
gauge blocks and has installed them in
a mahogany case so that they may be
kept on exhibit.
Each of the 81 blocks has an accu-
racy of .000002 of an inch. With the
proper combination of the 81 blocks it
is possible to build up 120,000 dimen-
sions ranging from .1 to 12 inches.
Another set of Johanssen gauge blocks
came as a gift of Mr. O. R. Brainey,
vice-president of the Gig Bushing Com-
pany of Pontiac, Michigan.
Mr. A. W. Detiert of the Detiert
Company presented the foundry with a
Detiert sand testing machine which will
be used in instruction and research.
The Buick Motor Car Company con-
tributed a spiral bevel gear generator.
It is a machine which makes the ring
gears in the Buick transmission and it
will be placed with the other gear cut-
ters in the machine tool laboratory to be
used in instruction.

in defense of a ma£u?nec/
WORD
CERTAIN WORDS, like certain
people, are faced with living
down an unfortunate past.
In the realm of chemistry there is a
word that suffers unwarranted public
ill repute. That word is "synthetic."
To the average lay mind "synthetic"
immediately suggests a substitute of
lew quality—a product to be carefully
avoided.
It is high time this erroneous impres-
sion be removed. The art of synthesis,
or rebuilding of materials from their
basic elements, is one of the most
forward developments in modern
chemistry.
The Dow Chemical Company is espe-
cially proud of a number of products
that are notable examples of synthesis.
Foremost among these is Dow's pro-
duction of synthetic phenol. Only
through the large production of high
quality phenol have the huge strides
in plastic development been possible.
Incidentally, the Dow synthetic phenol
plant is the largest in the world.
The great dry-cleaning industry has
gained, through Dow Synthetic Sol-
vents, not only the much needed pro-
tection and safety of non-flammable
and non-combustible solvents, but a
series of products possessing superior
cleansing capacity.
Through synthesis, the paint and var-
nish industry has been given man-made
resins that are far superior to the
natural product. My chemically achieved
characteristics these resins provide
greater color permanence against solar
action and other technical advances.
Production of these resins has been
made possible through Dow Para
Tertiary Butyl Phenol.

One need hardly comment on what
synthesis has done for the dye in-
dustry. Colors of lasting beauty and
utter uniformity have been made pos-
sible through chemistry. Incidentally,
The Dow Chemical Company enjoys
the distinction of producing the first
synthetic Indigo made in this country.
The same desirable qualities of greater
purity, uniformity and constant quality
through synthetic manufacture apply
also to many flavors and odors. Dow
is, similarly, proud of its accomplish-
ments in this particular field.
Let us, therefore, banish the unfair
connotation that has woven itself
around the honest word "synthetic."
In truth, this word is more than honor-
able. It is part and parcel of our great
progress toward better materials from
which to make the world's goods.

GEORGE

ROG
Every summer the Civil Engineering
undergraduates of the University of
Michigan come swarming into Camp
Davis armed with transits, old clothes
and an eye for beautiful girls. If you
had been there last summer you would
have seen "Rog" Frazier. dynamic
leader of party number eight, and re-
putedly the best dancer in the Jackson
Hole country, swing into action. His
associates in astronomical blundering
have since named him "the pressing
fool" in recognition of his hard work as
spark plug of party eight. Seriously
speaking though, Roger is a swell fellow
and a hard worker. A graduate of
Haverling High School in Bath, New
York, Rog came to the University with
a lot of ambition.
He has worked for expenses every
year and at present holds down three
jobs: one as assistant to Professor
Dodge, another as proctor in Allen-
Rumsey, and the third as draftsman in
the Business Administration school. In
the recent frosh-soph battle behind the
Union Dorm, Roger made very good
use of his military training—it is fun-
damental to retreat when out-numbered
—so proctor Frazier stood on the side-
lines and watched the two opposing fac-
tions fight it out with fire hoses. We
really don't blame him and, as he said:
"There was no use in trying to stop
them, and besides it was some fun."
In High School Frazier played var-
sity football and basketball as well as
entering into a host of other activities.
Although his numerous jobs have han-
dicapped him somewhat here at the Uni-
versity, we find Roger in Tau Beta Pi
Vulcan, and Scabbard and Blade. He is
also president of his professional society,
the A.S.C.E., and is a First Lieutenant
in the R.O.T.C.
FIRE PLUG
Last year the Michigan team almost
beat Northwestern, the team who went
on to win the Western Conference
championship. No one can forget how
the team, down in scoring position, tried
in vain for three downs to punch over a
touchdown, and how on the fourth down
they decided to rest their fate in a try
for a field goal, to settle their bid on
the toe of George Marzonie. When the
old fireplug took off his helmet and
stood back in kicking position, lining
the ball up with the center of the goal
posts, a short prayer traced itself on
every Michigan rooter's lips. The cen-
ter snap—the quarterback holds it—
the kick; a cheer arose from the Maize
and Blue stands only to be suddenly
stifled by the referee madly waving his
arms horizontally. The referee was the
only man who could tell that kick was
short, it was that close, but those are
football breaks. George was forgotten
in the disappointment, but he didn't
forget his disappointment. Almost a
year later, the Northwestern coach,
Lynn Waldorf met him in the Union
Lobby and remembered him as the boy
who almost beat his team.
George has been around here long
enough to have all of us know that the
campus hasn't a better fighter on it.
He comes from a family of nine chil-
dren, his father running a grocery store
in Flint, Michigan. As a result, George
has worked for his keep all the way so
that he can study mechanical engineer-
ing, specializing in power units. Trian-
gles tapped him as did Vulcans The
football team would like to literally tap
him sometimes for some of his wise-
cracks 'cause he has to some extent
thrown himself into the Michigan sys-
tem with his "puns, passes, and
prayers."
We like your "spunk," George, and
we wish you every success.
B.M.U.A. — B.M.O.C.
Someone once said that when a man
was a B.M.O.C. in the Engine School,
he didn't fool about it. Let's consider
the case of Bob Rowland, class of '38.
Bob is of medium height, dark
haired, well-built, quiet, capable. He
hails from Bartlesville, Oklahoma's
great oil city. For recreation Bob builds
kayaks, plays handball, is a master of
the bull session, and does his bit in the
social whirl.

BOB
Although Bob spent a summer in
the Phillips Petroleum Laboratory in
Bartlesville, he would rather pattern his
life along other lines. His preference
is towards the line of organic solvents
and synthesis. To further this desire.
Bob entered the University of Michi-
gan's College of Engineering direct from
high school. Once here he applied him-
self seriously towards getting his B.S. in
Chemical Engineering. Along the way,
Bob has managed to gather the fruits of
labor freely.
In his junior year, Bob was elected
to Tau Beta Pi, Engineer's Honorary
Society. So efficiently did Bob accept
the bid that he is now Corresponding
Secretary. In his chosen field, Bob
stands out as a leader. Always an ac-
tive member of the A. I. Ch. E., he
became their local president this year.
To round things off nicely, Vulcans,
Senior Engineering Honorary Socitey,
bid Bob in recognition of his worth and
ability. So there's your B.M.U.A., and
who dares deny that Bob Rowland well
deserves the title of B.M.O.C.,—and
then some!

CHEMICAL SAFETY
In a recent report made by W. S.
Topping, chief inspector of the Bureau
of the Safe Transportation of Explosives
and Other Dangerous Articles, it was
shown that no serious accident has oc-
curred involving chemicals in transit in
the last ten years. The Bureau oper-
ates under the direction of the Associ-
ation of American Railroads. This re-
markable record stands in tVie face of
an enormous increase in the tYariSPorta"
tion of dangerous chemical^ .1 is the
result of close cooperation k ^ the

O U 5
By
ATTABOI IGOTCHA AND OKIDOKI HOTCHACHA
Reprinted from Nickel Steel Topics
OUTER EDGE
SPECIMENS of a range of these al-
loys were rejected by the W.P.A.
Project for the Provision of Pork for
Mohammedans, owing to excessive
wear when subjected to the pig's bristle
test developed by Sayzu3 and Oyeah.*
When the tests on new specimens were
complete,5 it was found that the figures
obtained were too difficult to work out,
and that multiplication was very com-
plicated, as none of the figures in the
top line cancelled out with the bottom
line. Pieces were therefore chiselled
off the pieces rejected by the W.P.A.
P.P.P.M., and further tests were made.
Close agreement was found between
the expansion of the crystal lattices and
that of specimens consisting of compo-
site masses of tripeum, such as were
used by Uralier" and Donbeleevya,7
who carried out similar experiments.
The addition of scattium to the nickel
lattice has two effects:
(a) We could not get any results;
(b) If we had any results, they could
not be wangled successfully to
agree with any other results.
No change in structure took place at the
temperature of the magnetic transform-
ation; the face-centered structure per-
sisted from room temperature up to
800° C.s Hotchacha states that this dis-
appoints him, as he had hoped that the
self-centered structure of his mother-in-
law would be altered by its ultimate ex-
posure to high temperatures.
An ageing test of IS months' duration
on an alloy containing 97% scattium
shawed that no consistent change
occurred in the lattice parameter
over the whole period, and that
no ageing effect occurs. Hotch-
acha here mentions that the same
effect has been observed with women
between the ages of 22-42 years.
About this time Hotchacha disap-
peared from the laboratory, but as his
comparisons were becoming odiously
personal, the investigations were con-
tinued without his aid.
Lattice parameters were measured at
different temperatures and, from the
parameter - temperature relationships,
curves were deduced, showing effect of
temperature on coefficient of thermal
expansion. Owing to the author burning
his hand by picking up a piece of the
hot metal, the atmosphere of the room
rose by 0.0000412° C. (or F. according
to whether the thermometer was upside
down or not), owing to the heated
words used. The curves are therefore
slightly imperfect, but they have been
instrumental in the winning of the base-
ball pool for the last three weeks.8 At
a particular temperature, the value sud-
denly increases to a point, which, on
further increase of temperature, re-
mained constant. This was when the
author broke the thermometer.
The thermal hysteresis effect is also
clearly shown, and has proved useful to
the Bronx Zoological Society in judging
when the hyenas will laugh.10 Values
are given for the lattice parameters of
the pure d- and y-phases at different
temperatures, but the author will re-
frain from dilating on this subject, as he
really knows nothing about it.
In the y-alloys, it was observed that
the maximum becomes rather more or
less pronounced as the temperature is
raised, and that with increase in temper-
ature it is displayed in the direction of
the wy. In the d-alloys, the form of the
curves is opposite in direction. From this
it was concluded that the crystal struc-
ture was of the order
x. dy
dx

_l 3 + m

To check this result, further X-ray ex-
amination was made, when it was found
that the hard lump in the middle was
a new Buffalo nickel which Hotchacha
had stolen from me. Further check
showed a high percentage of carbon, and
it was therefore concluded that he had
fallen into the melting furnace. It was
therefore decided to recommence the
investigations some time or other.

CHEMICAL ENGINEERING AWARD
Four years ago Chemical And Metal-
lurgical Engineering first announced its
plans for a unique award for chemical
engineering achievement. This award is
given to a company, as contrasted to
other awards of similar nature which
are usually given to individuals. As in
preceding years, the third Award for
Chemical Engineering Achievement is to
be made to that company which, in the
opinion of a representative committee
of recognized leaders in the industry and
profession, has contributed the most
meritorious advance "made possible by
the broader participation of the chemi-
cal engineer in the affairs of the process
industries." The award is a bronze
plaque suitably engraved to indicate the
nature of the achievement. Previous
winners have been Carbide and Carbon
Chemicals Corporation for its major
achievement in building a great syn-
thetic aliphatic chemicals industry, and
E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Com-
pany for the commercial production of
synthetic rubber and camphor. The
awarding committee includes Professor
A. H. White of the University of
Michigan.
BOSTON IN ENGLAND
Last May just prior to the coronation
of George VI an International Congress
was held in London. Professor Boston
represented this country in submitting
a paper on the cutting of metals.
At the International Symposium on
Lubrication which was held in London
a week ago Dr. Boston submitted the
only paper from this country dealing
with cutting fluids. Approximately two
hundred papers by leading authorities
were also presented.

OKONITE insulation with an unsurpassed record
since 1878 is still generally recognized as the
acme of perfection for rubber insulations and as
"the best product possible" of its type.
The Okonite Company and its affiliates, how-
ever, have constantly kept step with the ad-
vances of the electric art.
Whether the wire or cable is large or small,
single or multiple conductor, high or low volt-
age, whether finished with a rubber or a syn-
thetic compound jacket, braid, lead sheath or
armor of any type, Okonite can make it.
In all cases, whether the correct solution calls
for rubber, impregnated paper, varnished cam-
bric, asbestos, glass or the newer synthetic
compounds, the policy still is and will continue
to be the best product possible.

The simple design and jointless construction of
this brewing kettle were made possible by oxy-
acetylene welding. Vi elding eliminates all crevices,
cracks or other tiny openings generally present in
jointed construction and thus removes the possi-
bility of bacteria lodging in such places. This

welded kettle, being jointless, is permanently leak-
proof. It is easy to clean and keep clean. In addi-
tion, welding has trimmed off the dead weight of
the heavier connections required by other methods
of joining metals.
Tomorrow's engineers will be expected to know
how to take advantage of this modern metalwork-
ing process. Several valuable and interesting tech-
nical booklets, which describe the application
of the oxy-acetylenc process of welding and cut-
ting to design, construction and fabrication, are
available from Linde offices in principal cities.

President of Senior Class

"\T7"ITH the first semester rapidly
"* drawing to a close, thoughts of
the future are forging their way to the
front in the mind of every senior. Where
will I be a year from now? What will I
be doing? Will I find that my college
training has been worth while? These
questions and many more come up con-
tinually. The answers to them must
wait, but the experiences of those who
have left school within the last few
years can certainly furnish some light as
to their nature.
Assuming that you are content with a
bachelor's degree, the chances are that
next fall will find you in the training
course of one of the many companies
that now use them as a means of break-
ing in new men. In their organization
and method, training courses vary as
widely as Ann Arbor weather, so that
specific statements about them can
hardly be made. However, the ultimate
purposes of all such courses are much
the same, and can quickly be enumer-
ated:
First, to acquaint the student with
the company—its personnel, its manu-
facturing processes, its product or prod-
ucts—in short, everything about it that
can be crammed into his head during
the time of the course;
Secondly, to enable various men in
the company to meet the student engi-
neer and to watch him at work, that
they may determine his ability, charac-
ter, and special talents;
And finally, by combining the knowl-
edge thus gained on both sides, to place
the new man where he will be of most
value to the company, preferably in a
branch of his own choosing.
In the average case, the method of in-
struction consists of having the student
work in every department of the organ-
ization, for periods of time that may
vary from half a week to several months.
In a manufacturing concern, the student
will follow the product through from the
raw materials entering the plant to the
finished product leaving it. Routine
laboratory work, shop work, estimating
of costs, research, sales work—all are
commonly found in the courses. What
the student learns while working in this
way depends almost entirely upon him-
self. He must make himself well enough
liked by the men with whom he associ-
ates that they will want to give him all
the information they can in the time
available. If he fails to do so, he's miss-
ing the boat, and is not doing right by
himself or the company that has em-
ployed him. And remember—the lowest
man in the shops can be as helpful in
his way as can his foreman. He knows
his own job, and knows it better than
anyone else. The knowledge that can
be gained from him should not be un-
derestimated.
Work is not the only part of the cur-
riculum. Lectures by the heads of de-
partments are regularly given; reports
are often required on the work done;
and quizes are frequent. It will be seen
that the course makes two steps out of
the long jump from school to work.
You may ask if your college training
will prove beneficial. The only possible
answer is yes, it will, and for a number
of reasons, all of them important.
In the first place, you are informed to
a certain extent upon a number of sub-
jects such as mathematics, chemistry,
physics, and elements of engineering,
one type or another. In the highly
competitive world to which we belong,
the need for producing by exact and fast
processes, and always at a minimum
cost, is increasing every day, and with
it grows the importance of engineering
science. Slip-shod methods and rule of
thumb practice have had their day and
are rapidly passing.
Secondly, you have learned at college,
or should have learned, to be a good
mixer and to meet and to talk with peo-
ple of every type. This and the first
reason go hand in hand. The best ideas
in the world are of no value if they can't
be put across to others by the man who
has them.
Then too, you have developed in col-
lege the ability to organize rapidly in
your mind a given amount of material.
You "catch on" quicker than does the
man without training. That ability will
prove an invaluable aid in understand-
ing all the workings of a large industry.
Finally, if for no other reason than
that you have gone to college, you will
be given an opportunity that few men in
a concern ever have. It can safely be
said that ninety percent of all the men
who work for a company never work in
more than one department. Many of
them know little or nothing of the work-

firm. They would like to, but never
have the time to find out. So here it is
that the student gets a real break, for in
visiting every department he will learn
much that older men with the company
have not learned in a lifetime.
Naturally, the big question is, what
comes after the training course? Any
branch of the company will have room
for the student who has shown himself
especially apt in the workings of that
branch. Your author's impression is
that sales offers the most interesting and
the most widely open field. Because of
the keen competition mentioned before,
the sales picture in recent years has
changed completely. No longer does the
glad-handing, back-slapping, party boy
salesman typify the group. Customers
today want value and service. They must
have the former to stay in business
themselves, and they appreciate the lat-
ter. For both they look to the engineer,
who above all others should know the
product he sells, and its applications.
As a consequence, the percentage of en-
gineers engaged in sales is on the up-
grade. Not mere order takers, they are in
a position to consult, to recommend, to
advise, and so to help the customer ma-
terially. Their scope is much wider than
that of the average salesman.
In any case, you must make the final
choice as to the type of work you prefer.
The training course will be of immeas-
urable aid in making that choice. It's
up to you to make the course all that
your employers hope it will be.

THE University of Michigan desires
in every practicable manner to serve
the people of the State of Michigan.
One of the channels for this service is
the Department of Engineering Re-
search which was established in 1920.
The purpose of this Department is to
render assistance in the field of applied
and industrial research, with as much
emphasis as possible on fundamental re-
search. The work is supported very
largely by those who provide funds for
the sponsorship of specific research pro-
jects as the University has not been in
a position, due to its many demands, to
grant funds of any material amount for
the carrying out of research programs.
Much good has resulted from the work
which has been done, both to industry
and to the University itself. Approxi-
mately 1100 projects have been under-
taken since the work of the Department
was first started and at the present time
about 75 are active. Many valuable find-
ings have resulted. A few of these will
be mentioned for the purpose of showing
the variety and scope of the work.
As a result of an investigation spon-
sored by The Detroit Edison Company,
Professor Bailey brought about marked
improvements in single phase motors.
The work was of such a fundamental
nature that practically every single phase
motor produced for household refriger-
ators today incorporates the improve-
ments which Professor Bailey suggested.
When one recognizes that almost every
electric vacuum sweeper, fan, and other
type of electric appliances requiring the
use of a motor in the home, are powered
with the single phase type of motor, one
can appreciate the scope of the field
covered.
Some years ago, Professor Sherlock
made a comprehensive study of the
strength of aerial line structures so that
they could be designed in such a man-
ner that the hazards of sleet and wind
storms would be reduced to a minimum.
Professor Housel has been carrying
on a splendid fundamental study deal-
ing with the bearing power of soils so
that structures can be built on founda-
tions which will give the greatest assur-
ance of permanence.
Professor Emswiler has made a real
contribution in the field of natural ven-
tilation for factories and other types of
buildings and Professor Higbie has con-
tributed materially in the field of natu-
ral illumination.
Excellent work has been done by
Professor Boston in the determining of
the machinability characteristics of
metals and also the effect of various
types of lubricants in machining.
Two outstanding pieces of work have
been done through the Physics Depart-
ment; one in the field of sound, and the
other in the field of spectroscopic anal-
ysis. As a result of the work done, the
University stands in the foremost ranks
in the field of sound and is the present-
day leader in the field of quantitative
spectrographic analysis.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


through the Department of Engineering
Mechanics. One of the recent outstand-
ing investigations, under the direction
of Professor Eriksen, has been the de-
termination of stresses in welded pipe
in the annealed and unannealed condi-
tions. This work has shown that un-
annealed welded pipe has stresses rang-
ing from 35,000 to 50,000 pounds per
square inch whereas the annealed
welded pipe has had these stresses re-
duced to between 3,000 and 5,000
pounds per square inch.
A considerable number of research
problems have been carried out in the
field of Chemical and Metallurgical En-
gineering. Practically every member of
the staff of the Department has partici-
pated in the programs. The evaporator
laboratory has been a valuable unit for
experimetnal work. For studies to de-
termine the properties of metals at ele-
vated temperatures, the University is
especially well equipped. Valuable work
has been done for such companies as
The Detroit Edison Company, The
Timken Roller Bearing Company, the
National Tube Company, The Caloriz-
ing Company, Allis-Chalmers, and oth-
ers. Basic fundamental work has been
done in the field of malleable iron by
Professor Schneidewind as well as in the
determination of the effects of the
products of combustion on metal in
brass melting by Professor Upthegrove.
Professor Wood has done work on the
permeability of gases through various

metals and on the characteristics and
tolerance limits of spring wire. Other
outstanding studies have been in the
field of paper under Professor Mc-
Cready, petroleum products under Pro-
fessor Brown, extractions of oils and
development of plastics under Professor
Brier, boiler feedwater studies under
Professor A. H. White, and solid COa
development by Professors Baker and
Katz.
The problems which have been men-
tioned are typical of some of the more

important work which has been done.
They are presented merely for illustra-
tions.
Of particular interest in this research
program is the value which results to
the University. A very considerable
number of the faculty members have
participated in these research projects
and the results of the work have aided
them materially in keeping abreast of
industrial progress. This feature can
not help but assist them in their teach-
ing activities and result in their being a
greater inspiration to their students.
The work is of benefit to the student
body in that about 200 students assist
in the research work during a given
year. Not only do these students re-
ceive financial remuneration, but also
they get the benefits of participating in
actual research work, seeing how re-
search work is done, and receiving in
consequence, an added inspiration.
Because the University makes this
service available, benefits accrue not
only to the sponsoring concerns, but
also to the University as a whole.
Equipment which is used in projects
often remains on the campus, thus add-
ing to the material facilities of the En-
gineering College. Greater than this,
however, is the added inspiration of the
faculty by contact with outside indus-
trial concerns and the assistance and
stimulation given to our students by
their participation in research problems.

FOR several years the general public
has been acquainted with electronic
devices. Excluding the radio, which is
now taken for granted by so many per-
sons, the application of electronic de-
vices has been given the spotlight
recently and these devices have been
made to perform many marvelous and
novel functions. The automaton or
robot which accomplishes various tasks;
the drinking fountain which squirts au-
tomatically when one nears it; doors
which apparently open themselves at
one's apporach; elevators which stop for
one without even the pressing of a but-
ton; store window displays which are
lighted automatically and then are
darkened as one walks past the store
front; these and many other interesting
tricks are used to entertain John K.
Public. He, however, is becoming used
to these novelties and with a shrug
says, "I know they do that with photo-
electric cells;"—with which profound
explanation he goes on about his busi-
ness.
Most persons, including many engi-
neers, have been blinded by this public
exploitation and little realize the prac-
tical use which is being made of elec-
tronic devices in industry. All engineers
should realize that a knowledge of elec-
tronic devices is valuable because often
these devices will easily solve problems
which could only be impractically

solved any other way. Student electrical
engineers should understand electronic
devices because a goodly portion of
electrical engineers in industry have not
kept abreast of the times and they know
very little about electronics. An elec-
trical engineer who can handle power
factors, 500 h.p. motors, and high ten-
sion installations with ease, can easily
become a raving maniac when he at-
tempts to understand the whims and
vagaries of a recalcitrant two-inch vac-
uum tube in a delicate piece of appa-
ratus which must be serviced.
That electronic devices are here to
stay is indicated by the fact that sev-
eral companies have been formed which
specialize in the industrial application
of electronic devices and several of the
large electrical companies have insti-
tuted departments in this field. The
Electronics
following instances illustrate some ways
in which electronic apparatus has helped
industry.
A certain manufacturer made a prod-
uct whose moisture content had to be
carefully controlled. This ordinarily
involved taking a sample, weighing a
portion, heating in an oven, cooling, and
reweighing to determine the loss of
moisture. One hour and twenty min-
utes elapsed between the time the sam-
ple was taken and the time the results
were reported back to the operator.
Thus, when difficulties arose, an hour
and twenty minutes' bad production
would be run before correcting adjust-
ments could be made. The resulting
bad product had to be reworked or de-
graded, both uneconomic procedures. A
vacuum tube moisture meter was orig-
inated which consisted of one small
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


tube was connected as a self-excited os-
cillator with the plate and grid coils
loosely coupled on a hollow coil form
and the circuits were detuned just be-
yond the point of oscillation. A core
of the product whose moisture was to
be measured was thrust into the coil
form and the induction between the
coils varied as the percent of moisture
in the product. This induction varied
the feedback between the two coils and
varied the tube plate current, the value
of which was obtained from a milliam-
meter in the plate circuit of the tube.
The device was calibrated by obtaining
the meter readings for various samples
whose moisture content had been de-
termined by the oven method. A curve
representing percent moisture versus
plate current was prepared and mois-
ture determinations could be run in fif-
teen minutes with the new gadget.
Much bad production was thus elim-
inated.
In another plant it was desired to ob-
tain a continuous recording of the water
level in a medium pressure steam boiler.
One man attacked the problem in rather
an ingenious fashion. He fastened a
round piece of copper rod in the center
of the glass tubing which formed part
of the water level gauge. He then
wrapped a piece of thin copper foil
sheeting around the outside of the glass
cylinder and he thus formed a con-
denser, the capacity of which varied as
the height of the water in the glass tub-
ing. This condenser was used as the
main tuning condenser in the tuned
circuit of a radio frequency amplifier
which was coupled to a crystal-con-
trolled radio frequency oscillator. The
amount of energy accepted by the am-
plifier from the oscillator varied as the
water gauge condenser tuned the am-
plifier toward or away from perfect res-
onance. The output of the amplifier
was fed into a vacuum tube rectifying
circuit which contained a recording d.c.
meter which recorded the fluctuations of
rectifier plate current. The recording
of the meter was calibrated in terms of
water level and the device worked
rather nicely.
Incidentally, the dielectric constant
of water is about 81 while that of most
solids and liquids (with the exception
of some of the alcohols, ammonia, hy-
drogen peroxide, et cetera), is from
three to seven. Thus a capacity meas-
uring device should indicate the pres-
ence of water in various substances
when the proper procedures are fol-
lowed.
A British cocoa plant used a photo-
electric cell to advantage. In one of
the crushing operations a conveyor car-
ried cocoa nibs to a hopper which fed
the nibs at the proper rate to the crush-
ing rolls below. Automatic operation of
the conveyor belt was desired. Electron-
ics again solved the problem. A photo-
tube and a light source were placed on
opposite sides of the hopper. When the
hopper became filled, the light beam
was interrupted and a relay was actu-
ated which shut off the power to the
conveyor drive. The relay was of the
delayed action type and stayed open
for two and one-half minutes after the
light beam was restored before closing
automatically and restarting the con-
veyor. This allowed the hopper to
empty almost completely without rapid
switching in and out of the contactors.
A clever device for controlling weigh-
ing operations has appeared on the mar-
ket recently. It consists of a light source
(automobile light bulb) with a photo-
tube housed in a unit equipped with
suction cups which fasten easily to the
glass on the front of a scale dial. The
light is focused on the dial and is re-
flected back to the photoelectric tube.
When the scale pointer moves around
the dial and interrupts this light beam,
the photo cell current is interrupted.
This effect is amplified by a vacuum
tube amplifier which operates a 300
watt relay which shuts off the feed
mechanism to the scales. The device is
said to be accurate to one scale division.
Mechanical engineers might be inter-
ested to know how a photoelectric de-
vice helped a certain machine to oper-
ate. A candy manufacturer wanted an
automatic candy wrapper which would
operate at high speed and would wrap
all of the candy bars so that the trade-
mark and label appeared in the proper
place on the wrapped bar. A machine
was on the market which took the pa-
per in long strips on large rolls, cut it
into small lengths, and wrapped it
around the candy bars fed to the ma-
chine. It was very difficult to get the
trademark always in the right place
however. This was accomplished by
printing small dense dark lines on the
transparent wrapping at intervals in
correct relation to the printed trade-
mark. The strip was then fed to the
machine between a light source and a
photocell. Whenever the dark line in-
tercepted the light beam, a grid-glow
tube functioned and its plate current op-
erated a solenoid which tripped the cut-
ting knife. The knife cut the paper at
the correct place. The tube circuit was
opened by an automatic mechanical
switch mounted on the knife blade shaft
so that the tube would be ready to func-
tion when the next dark line appeared.
The improved machine turned out 120
perfectly-wrapped candy bars per min-
ute.
These few cited instances and those
which are appearing in the press and in
the technical journals should convince
the conscientious engineer that at least
a rudimentary knowledge of the func-
tioning and application of electronic
devices is most desirable.
A photo - electric
cell in this ma-
chine makes pre-
cision wrapping
possible.

Michigan's Cultural Program
STUDENTS in engineering colleges
proverbially lack leisure. No doubt,
there is some concern in their minds as
to whether they will ever have any sub-
stantial amount of leisure time which
they may devote to the gratification of
their interests. If, however, one exam-
ines the length of the working week and
the history of its changes during the last
thirty years, it is apparent that there
has been a substantial reduction in the
length of that week. Perhaps a fair av-
erage figure for the working week of
today is about 44 hours. Obviously,
then the utilization of leisure will be-
come an increasingly significant prob-
lem of today's engineers.
During the undergraduate careers of
most engineers there is much said about
the engineer's concern with the broad
fields of knowledge which are known as
the social sciences and the humanities.
Necessarily, little is done during those
four years to give the engineering stu-
dent a speaking knowledge of these
broad fields. If the definition of engi-
neering which is found in one of the bul-
letins of this institution is recalled, the
importance of these broad fields will be
apparent: "Engineering is the science of
controlling the forces and of utilizing
the materials of nature for the benefits
of man, and the art of organizing and
directing human activities in connection
therewith." An examination of the cur-
riculum for engineering courses will
show that studies which are applicable
to the last part of the definition are
given very little attention. Certainly if
an engineer is to fulfill these require-
ments, a knowledge of these fields will
be important and necessary. After grad-
uation there will be time, however, to
acquire a knowledge of the social sci-
ences and the humanities. Several of
the technical societies, recognizing this
deficiency in technical education and the
opportunity for remedying it by inde-
pendent work after graduation, have
prepared guidance lists for engineers
who wish to become acquainted with
these large branches of knowledge. A
conscientious use of these lists will give
a knowledge of the fields equivalent or
superior to the knowledge which would
be gained by taking formal course work
in them.
In his social contacts the engineer is
at a disadvantage because a discussion
of his main interest is unintelligible to
the majority of his non-engineering ac-
quaintances. Since man is a social be-
ing, it is necessary that there be fields
of common interest for him to explore in
companionship with his fellows. The
best way to develop interests is to ac-
quire knowledge which will be signifi-
cant to those interests. There are many
individuals who acquire enough knowl-
edge in a field, not their vocation, to
speak with authority in that field. There
is no better way to give time significance
than to choose an avocation and acquire
as much knowledge about it as possible.
In choosing an avocation, its intellectual
demands should be considered. Will it
continue to excite interest and intellec-
tual activity as the knowledge of it in-
creases? The choice of some avocation,
non-technical in nature, will give the en-
gineer a common interest with many of
his companions.
There is a tendency, based on a well
founded popular prejudice, to exclude
engineers from an appreciation of cer-
tain fields, literature, music, and the
like, because of the supposed pragmatic
8
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


uals. It is also popular belief that in
order to gain an appreciative enjoyment
from these divisions of human endeavor
a certain mystic, non-critical approach
is necessary. The ability to approach
a body of human experience in this
fashion is denied the engineer. It would
be beside the point to investigate the
validity of such a prejudice. It is to the
point, however, to recognize that it is
possible to gain knowledge and a critical
enjoyment of these fields of human ex-
perience by another approach. The en-
gineering curricula attempts to train the
student to approach all problems with
an analytical mind. The problem of
criticism is largely one of sensitive anal-
ysis. The critical approach to the arts
is the approach which should give max-
imum enjoyment because by its nature
it attempts to separate the trivial from
the significant. By such a separation the
significant, the best, should stand larger
in comparison. Technical criticism in the
arts is a difficult field. However, to the
intelligent amateur, the critical ap-
proach should give him a real apprecia-
tion and enjoyment of his interest.
It is the problem of every individual
to keep intellectually active throughout
his life. There is no better way to keep
this activity than to find an avocation,
or a number of interests and to devote
a large amount of leisure to their de-
velopment.
Where They Come From
It has been a truism that we never
know what kind of engineering we will
be engaged in after we are graduated.
This is strikingly exemplified by the
assortment of men now taking the
graduate curriculum in Public Health
Engineering. There are two who were
graduated in mechanical engineering,
one in chemical (petroleum), one in
aero and the remainder in civil. To
quote Professor Miller ". . .it may be
said that a fundamental engineering ed-
ucation, sincerely taken, and regardless
of special divisions is the most import-
ant step towards a career in Public
Health Engineering."—Editor's Note.

The first great problems thus encoun-
tered were concerned with supplying
adequate quantities of safer potable
water, the collection and removal of
sewage and other wastes in such manner
as to protect each individual against the
devastating effects of disease organisms
contained in the body wastes accumu-
lating on his own and his neighbor's
premises.
Engineers that have designed and
supervised the construction of water sup-
ply systems, water purification plants,
sewerage systems and sewage treatment
C OCIETY has made numerous and pe-
*-' culiar demands upon the engineer to
aid in the protection of the race against
self extermination by conditions of en-
vironment arising out of the growth and
development of a more complex civili-
zation. The development of large indus-
trial enterprises grouped in strategic lo-
cations with respect to sources of raw
materials, fuel supplies, and favorable
transportation facilities, has stimulated
the crowding of vast numbers of people
into conjested areas.

tary engineers. It is believed that it can
be truly said that no greater service has
been rendered to mankind by any pro-
fessional group than that rendered by
the sanitary engineer in the spectacular
prevention of epidemics of cholera,
typhoid fever, and the dysenteries,
through the protection of the source and
the purification of public drinking water
supplies. The engineer's accomplishment
in this field has been so spectacular that
the impression is widespread, even
among engineers, that sanitary engineer-
ing is concerned only with water supply
and possibly sewage disposal.
However, the application of engineer-
ing knowledge and methods in the solu-
tion of problems of water supply, and
the disposal of sewage and other wastes,
has met with such success that the serv-
ices of the engineers have become indis-
pensable in the solution of a vast num-
ber of other public health problems.
This extended field of service, and the
broader preparation and outlook with
respect to public health required of the
engineers engaged in this field, has
brought about the use of the term, Pub-
lic Health Engineer. In defining the train-
ing for Public Health Engineering, the
American Public Health Association rec-
ommends subjects in addition to those or-
dinarily required for engineers electing
the sanitary option of civil engineering,
such as biostatistics, bacteriology, pub-
lic health administration, sanitary
biology, food technology with particu-
lar reference to the production and
pasteurization of milk, entomology as it
applies to those insects which may be
vectors of disease, housing lighting, ven-
tilation and plumbing with respect to
health, industrial sanitation, and envi-
ronmental sanitation as it applies to
rural areas and recreational facilities.
The work of the Public Health En-
gineer is concerned with measures for
the safety of the water, air, milk and
food supplies, the disposal of sewage,
garbage and industrial wastes, the con-
trol of animal, rodent, and insect vec-
tors of disease, the provision of sanitary
conditions in factories, schools, recrea-
tional centers, and the rural areas, and
the improvement of environmental clean-
liness in other respects.
The principal opportunities for serv-
ice in this field are offered by official
health agencies such as the United States
200

1885
1690
1695
1900
The decrease in disease death rates is directly attributable to the
efforts of Public Health Engineers.
Public Health Service, State, City, and
County health departments. Each of the
forty-eight State Health Departments
now has a bureau or division under the
direction of an engineer, employing al-
together about 400 engineers. A survey
in 1935 revealed about 60 engineers em-
ployed by City and County health de-
partments. It is estimated that the
number of engineers employed by local
health agencies has been more than
doubled since this survey. The Univer-
sity of Michigan had ten graduate stu-
dents in engineering and public health
last year and has fifteen additional stu-
dents pursuing such study now.
The availability of Federal funds
appropriated by the Congress under
authority of Title VI of the Social Secu-
rity Act for aiding states in the expan-
sion of health services and allotted to
the several states by the Public Health
Service, has made possible the employ-
ment of large numbers of additional per-
sonnel by public health agencies. This
expansion of health series has greatly
increased the demand for engineers
trained along the lines indicated.
In fact, the demand for trained per-
sonnel has so far exceeded the supply
that a portion of the funds is being de-
voted to aiding in the maintenance of
five training centers, including the Uni-
versity of Michigan, selected by the
State Departments of Health and the
United States Public Health Service. In
addition, each state has a fund for pay-
ing the expense of training selected per-
sonnel. The fund provides for the pay-
ment of tuition of persons in training and
a salary or stipend for each individual
selected, during the training period to
which he is assigned. Eight of the fifteen
engineer trainees on the campus this se-
mester will continue through the school
year while the other seven are directed
to report for duty in their respective
states at the close of this semester, and
are expected to return later for a second
semester of graduate work.
The salaries of engineers in public
health work vary in different locations
but in general conform fairly closely to
salaries prevailing for other engineers of
comparable training and experience. In
view of the newness of the field how-
ever, and the comparatively small num-
ber of men engaged in it, opportunities
offered for advancement as a recognition
of individual accomplishment, are be-
lieved to be considerably above the av-
erage for engineers in general.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


PUTTING THINGS DOWN ON PAPER

THESE comments are being written
after spending half a day looking
through three batches of home work
from 28 students. If that were not suf-
ficient inspiration for these remarks,
more than enough came from going
through the notes on a lecture, as turned
in last week by several hundred fresh-
men.
Legibility is not confined to writing,
fined as that human capacity which
steadily grows worse. It usually does.
So, when a freshman brings with him a
species of handwriting already sadly de-
generated, and then spends four years
in actively perfecting its unreadability,
the result is really remarkable. It may
be true (no one has proved it either
way) that our engineering students have
so much note-taking and writing to do,
that speed must be permitted to sub-
merge legibility to some extent—in the
student's own notes. But when this ten-
dency slops over into the papers, reports,
and other documents that are to be
looked at by others, the student does
himself no good here, and he may be
working up a good deal of potential
trouble for himself as a graduate.
Legibility is not confined to writing.
The term properly covers any factor
that makes anything easy to read. Con-
sider the "hard-pencil" student. After
drawing a curve on a semi-transparent
piece of graph paper with a fine-pointed
hard pencil, he puts on the legend and
the scales with the same dim device,
hides his name in some odd place on
the sheet, and turns it in content with
knowing he has created a permanent,
smudge-proof record. And so he has.
But the other man who has to look at
it is less impressed with permanency
than with certain unprintable thoughts
that always come when he is faced with
illegibility.
Of course, that student may have a
"soft-pencil" roommate who uses up
several hours in computing data for a
curve, then boldly sketches the curve
with a width of line that will introduce
its own unnecessary three percent error.
Extremes are bad, wherever found.
Speaking of curves, most curves are
drawn after points are plotted. Here we
come to the secretive student. He dots
in his points with a sharp pencil, then
carefully obliterates them with a nice,
legible curve that accurately spears most
of the points. We have to tread care-
fully here, for sometimes he is doing
exactly the right thing. Just which cir-
cumstances demand the obliteration
treatment, we cannot go into here. But
when the points came hard, and they
represent real investment (of student
time now, of employer's money later)
no one will thank the obliteration ex-
pert. The sentiment will be quite other-
wise. Now, if points should be left show-
ing, then show them. Unfortunately,
there are only a few kinds of point des-
ignations that are good to look upon,
and others that are too often used.
Every student should spend an hour or
two sometime, leafing through a large
miscellaneous batch of curves in tech-
nical literature. Plenty of good and
bad examples will be found.
The secretive student has another ef-
fective trick. The graph paper is di-
vided, let us say, in inches and tenths.
He might scale the ordinate by writing
0, 500, 1000, etc., on the successive inch
lines; but no, he puts down. such values
as 0, 300, 600, etc., and. t.v„teby chal-
lenges everyone—including himself—to
read his curves with accuracy and speed.
There are rare occasions when some one
factor is of greater importance than all
others, and a readable scale must be
most unwillingly sacrificed; but legible
scales are of paramount importance. A
bad scale should be conceived in mental
anguish, born with apologies, and per-
mitted to live in good company only by
the tolerance of sheer necessity.
In putting things down on paper, the
engineer constantly faces the problem of
presenting data in tabular form. Com-
mencement time works no permanent
magic. The act of taking a degree does
not transform a senior's bad habits into
an engineer's good habits. The senior
who draws (free-hand) some vertical
and horizontal lines on a plain piece of
paper, then scrawls the data into the
wavering rectangles of the home-made
form, will do the same thing "on the
job" next year. That is, he will do it
until the boss turns purple once too
often.
Only a small fraction of us are born
with an exceptional capacity for invent-
ing numerous good ways of putting
things down on paper, and with the ad-
ditional capacity for assembling the va-
rious materials into a whole that will be
pleasing to the eye. All the remainder of
us must learn the tricks of the trade,
and most of us must resign ourselves to
the prospect of using those tricks in
only acceptable style. Yet it is imper-
ative that engineering students should
train themselves up to a minimum stand-
ard of facility and performance in writ-
ing, lettering, tabulating, and graphing
their "on paper" materials.

"DIVE years ago, 22 separate opera-
*- tions shaped a phonograph tone
arm; today, one suffices. Those 22
operations included eight drawings, one
bending, two bulgings, one cutting-off,
and ten annealings. The die casting
process now makes this same part in
a single operation. Moreover, no signs
of wear could be found on the ingenious
helical die this operation employs after
40,000 parts had been cast. Die cast-
ing can accomplish this and more when
the alert engineer recognizes its possi-
bilities.
The process of die casting consists of
forcing molten or plastic metal into a
permanent mold, from which the solid-
ified castings can quickly be ejected and
the process repeated. Recent progress in
die casting machinery has made it pos-
sible to cast parts at from 400 to 1000
"shots" per hour. Naturally enough,
the mass production of die cast parts is
an easy matter. Then too, the dies are

frequently arranged so that all the parts
of a particular assembly are "shot" si-
multaneously in one operation.
Die castings are produced in a wide
range of shapes and sizes. Any combi-
nation of internal and external screw
threads, gear teeth, cams, lugs, ribs, or
holes can be combined into one intricate
design and die cast uniformly to an ac-
curacy of a thousandth of an inch. A
Cadillac radiator grille, for example,
contains 1200 holes, each % inch
square. Furthermore, since the casting
temperature is usually under 8S0°F.,
and the cooling of the metal in the dies
is rapid, hardened steel parts, bronze
bushings, wood, plastics, or even com-
pressed paper can be used as inserts
and become an integral part of the cast-
ing. In addition, most die casting al-
loys are both corrosion-proof and easily
machinable. Their impact strength va-
ries from three to ten times as much as
grey cast iron. Stiffer than stampings;
lighter than common castings; yet
cheaper than either, the die casting is
constantly finding new uses.
"Streamline" design is more easily
obtainable by die casting than by any
other method of working metal. Modern
design, smooth surfaces, and the ability
to take a high polish, yield high "eye-
appeal" in the finished product. This is
one reason for the rapid growth of the
die casting industry. The principal reason

Modern die-casting makes many intricate parts possible.
for the ever-increasing use of die cast-
ings, however, is the savings which re-
sult when die casting is used in place of
the traditional methods of fabrication.
In many cases, costs can be consider-
ably reduced. The die casting process is
simple—so simple that die castings can
usually be produced at a lower cost
than forgings, sand castings, or stamp-
ings, provided enough identical parts
are made to pay the initial cost of the
die. Sheet metal stampings are often
replaced with die castings to reduce
tooling costs. For example, the presses,
dies, and annealing equipment for man-
ufacturing a typical stamped automo-
bile radiator grille cost about $300,000.
A one piece die cast grille of the same
pattern can be made with dies and
cleaning tools whose total cost is under
S25.000. Then again, die casting allows
thin sections of metal to be cast. The
weight of a certain coal-stoker was cut
exactly in half by replacing cast iron
parts with thinner, yet sufficiently rigid
sections of zinc alloy. A whole assem-
bly of simpler parts has many times
been combined into a single intricate die
casting, thus saving a large part of the
cost of manufacture. Then too, as in
the cast phonograph arm, one die cast-
ing operation can reduce the amount of
capital tied up in shop machinery by
supplanting successive drawing, bend-
ing, and machining operations. In
many plants, a huge quantity of brass
and bronze "hay"—turnings and bor-
ings—is annually sent to the scrap
heap. The advent of brass die casting
lets us starve the junk pile by feeding
the melting pot. Still greater savings are
possible as a result of the smoothness
and precision of die castings as little or
no machining is needed. Moreover, since
die castings are invariably produced by
one-man machines, labor costs are low.
"Just a minute," you say, "aren't dies
expensive?" They are of course. But
bear in mind a statement from a leading
manufacturer: "We have never yet

stock typewriter frames. Is it any
wonder that the engineer who uses die
castings intelligently can better his
product and lower his costs?
Unfortunately, iron and steel cannot
be die cast. On the other hand, excel-
lent alloys have been developed for
this use. They are, in order of im-
portance: alloys of zinc, aluminum,
magnesium, tin, and lead; and brass
and bronze. Zinc alloys, as a result of
their low cost and superior casting prop-
erties dominate the field. In fact, three-
quarters of all die castings, and 95 per-
cent of those used in automobiles are
made from zinc. If however, lightness,
corrosion resistance, or permanence of
dimensions is essential, aluminum alloys
find ready uses. The copper alloys have
the best mechanical properties. On the
other hand, no structural metal weighs
less than magnesium, whose density,
1.7, is only one-fifth the density of
brass. But what about strength? In
pounds per square inch, we find the
maximum tensile strengths of the prin-
cipal alloys to be: magnesium, 30,000;
DECEMBER, 1937

aluminum, 44,000; zinc, 50,000; and
copper, 75,000.
A contrast between die cast Ingersoll
watch parts, and a 33 pound Cadillac
windshield frame, also die cast, provides
vivid evidence of the enormous size
range of die cast parts. Suppose we
examine the casting limits of typical
alloys. Maximum weights in pounds of
die castings are: zinc, 35; lead, 15;
aluminum or tin, 10; copper or magne-
sium, 3. Wall thickness can be as low
as 3V to ^j inch in all of the above
alloys. Holes as small as g^ inch can
be cast in zinc, lead, or tin; fa inch in
magnesium; ^ 'ncn "i aluminum; and
yg inch in brass and bronze. Similarly,
it is possible to cast screw threads rang-
ing from 32 threads per inch for tin and
lead, and 24 for zinc, down to 10
threads per inch for the copper alloys.
Die casting machines range in size
from small manually operated units
weighing less than a ton to huge semi-
automatic giants 19 feet long, 10 feet
high, and weighing 25 tons. Fully au-
tomatic machines, now used only for
compartively simple castings, but con-
stantly being improved, will operate at
500 "shots" per hour. Their water-
cooled dies, usually made of steel or
cast iron, are equipped with complicated
core-pulling and ejecting mechanisms.
Dies now in use range from 6 inches
square to 4 feet square. On most cast-
ing machines, a built in melting furnace
is fired with gas, oil, or electricity. The
Metal Industry
standard machines depend on the ap-
plication of pneumatic or hydraulic
pressure to a plunger, which in turn
forces the molten metal through a
"gooseneck" into the die cavity. On
some machines, the air pressure is ap-
plied directly to the surface of the
metal in the "gooseneck." Neither of
these well-known types of machines,
however, can be used for casting mag-
nesium, brass, or bronze. Instead, the
well and plunger construction is used.
The metal is not liquified, but instead
is cast in the plastic state at unusual
pressure. Zinc is generally cast at pres-
sures of 800 to 1000 pounds per square
inch, aluminum at 500, and magnesium
at 5000, but brass is cast at pressures of
12,000 to 50,000 pounds per square
inch.
After the castings come from the ma-
chine, their flanges and sprues are
trimmed off on a punch press at the
rate of 1500 pieces an hour. If the
parts are to be used where appearance is
essential, they may be buffed and plated
with nickel or chromium. A wide range
of organic finishes, enamels, and lac-
quers is also available. Nevertheless,
most of the die castings used for utili-
tarian purposes are used as cast, with
or without some form of chemical dip
treatment. Fortunately, expensive plat-
ing or enameling is unnecessary for
most conditions of use.
Every automobile is a traveling sales-
man for the die casting industry. From
fancy radiator grille and shining horns
to flashing tail light, it advertises die
casting as the low cost way of making
high quality parts. Under its hood are
other die castings which show the me-
chanical ingenuity of the engineer—
carburetors, shock absorbers, automatic
gear shifts, and others. Locks, window
regulators, radio and heater cases, and
ornamental moldings up to six feet long
are among the 50 die castings which
are used in the average car of today.
The breadth of uses for die castings is
almost unlimited. Ten representative
business machines together use a total
of 713 die cast parts. We find, for
example, that a cash register uses 53
die castings; an automatic phonograph,
71; and a gasoline pump, 77. To an
increasing extent, valves, gears, cams,
pulleys, and other machine parts are
being die cast. One low-cost lathe con-
tains 43 such castings. Large parts
also are cast by this method. One in-
strument manufacturer is now produc-
ing die cast potentiometer cases 20 by
19 by 12 inches in size, and 19 pounds
in weight. Other typical applications
of die casting include: clocks, refriger-
ators, tools, novelties, cameras, wash-
ing machines, telephones, and oil burn-
ers. The modern vacuum cleaner would
hardly be possible were it not for die
casting. Every day 25,000 magnesium
castings are made for one make alone.
On another make, the suction fan is a
balanced zinc die casting, turning over
at 12,000 revolutions a minute. Neither
the automatic radio tuner (using 45 die
castings), nor the familiar flexible fast-
ener would be possible without die cast-
ing. Each tiny unit of a "zipper" is
die cast directly on the flexible tape.
Perhaps we can better visualize the
significance of die casting to industry
if we take into account the dollars-and-
cents value of die cast products. In
1936, the sale of high-purity zinc for
use in die casting alloys increased 30
percent over the 1935 figure. Moreover,
aluminum die castings worth $7,500,000
were made last year. Furthermore, a
200 percent increase over 1935 occurred
in the use of both brass and magnesium
die castings. For example, 791,856
pounds of magnesium were made into
die castings in 1936. Thus we see that
engineers in almost every industry are
taking advantage of engineering prog-
ress. They are redesigning their prod-
ucts to use die castings.

NEW DIESEL DRIVE
Reports of successful trial runs by a
new type of diesel-engine powered loco-
motive come from the Humboldt-Deutz-
Motoren A.G., the largest German mak-
ers of diesel engines. It is claimed that
the method of operation of the locomo-
tive is entirely new in having direct
drive wheels without gears. The ma-
chine is reputed to have developed 110
km. per hour.
Compressed air from a compressor,
operated by auxiliary diesel machinery,
is admitted into the cylinders of the
locomotive to start the engine. This
initial impulse starts pistons, connect-
ing rods, wheels, and fuel pumps. The
pumps throw a fine spray of fuel oil into
the cylinders and the oil is ignited by
electrically heated springs. As soon as
the locomotive has gained medium
speed, the compressed air is shut off.
The locomotive is reported to generate
a maximum of 1000 h.p.

CALLING ALL SANITARY
ENGINEERS
Add to the confused usage of engi-
neering titles the following statement
made by Samuel Fassler, Commissioner
of Buildings in Manhattan to the N. Y.
State Association of Master Plumbers:
"The master plumbers ... is an indus-
trious, hard-working individual, who fits
into the same category as any other
specialized engineer. His work is tech-
nical. It requires long years of appren-
ticeship and the successful fulfillment of
examination and licensing specifications.
Hereafter, instead of using the term
'master plumber' I am going to substi-
tute the term 'sanitary engineer'."
We suggest that Mr. Fassler consider
the many years in college that go to
make up the education of the modern
sanitary engineer before lightly giving
professional attributes to a skilled trade,
regardless of its importance in our so-
ciety.
SAFETY FROM AIR CONDITIONING
Air conditioning has done much to
promote the health and comfort of
workers, not only in maintaining com-
fortable temperatures, but also in elim-
inating accidents and disease hazards,
delegates to the refrigerating section of
the National Safety Congress were told
by A. G. Hillin. This was brought out
in Mr. Hillin's address to the delegates
on "Safety Control in Air Condition-
ing."
Mr. Hillin informed the delegates that
a large number of applications in air
conditioning has proved itself to have
a definite safety value. In operating
rooms of hospitals where air condition-
ing is installed, the doctors and nurses
are more comfortable, which tends to
increase steadiness of nerves. Freedom
from perspiration avoids possibility of
a wound infection from that source.
Since many anaesthetics have explosive
characteristics, maintenance of a rela-
tive humidity of 50 percent eliminates
possibility of a disastrous static con-
dition.
Many air conditioning installations in
industrial plants where excessive heat is
generated have reduced the number of
prostrations, benefited the health of
workers, and increased production. An
important safety application is for the
removal of dust and small particles of
irritant chemicals such as are found in
match factories and in some depart-
ments of chemical, paint, and pharma-
ceutical plants.
Fuse loading departments in ammu-
nition factories is another place in which
air conditioning promotes safety for em-
ployes. The humidity is kept high
enough to prevent a static spark that
might cause disastrous results and the
elimination of perspiration prevents the
powder from adhering to the steel dies.
POOR ENGLISH OF ENGINEERS
SCORED BY EMPLOYERS
When asked what was lacking in the
makeup of recent engineering graduates
in their employ, employers' answers
agreed on one point, lack of command
of the mother tongue.
V. L. King, technical director of the
Calco Chemical Company, had this to
say: "One of the most outstanding
faults, if one is looking for faults, is
their inability to use the English lan-
guage. The writing of simple reports and
the expressing of ideas verbally seem to
be two things in which they are notably
deficient." E. Robert Wilson. President
of Pan-American Petroleum Transport
Company, is of the same opinion when
he writes: "In my experience the great-
est weakness of the average engineer
today is the lack of ability to assemble
a good report which is at once well or-
ganized, clear and persuasive."
Lack of wide vocabulary and inability
to speak effectively were mentioned as
outstanding faults of engineers by M. F.
Taggart, Director of Research of the
O'Brien Varnish Company. John
Dorr, President nf the Dorr Company,
also scored the poor writing and speak-
ing ability as primary faults of young
graduate engineers.

DOWMETAL
THE WORLDS LIGHTEST STRUCTURAL ALLOY
Almost a score of years ago Dow under-
took to produce American made mag-
nesium alloys—the metal that is a full
third lighter than aluminum.
Then, and through the years, Dow
looked forward to when the startling
lightness of this metal would make a
myriad of tasks easier for mankind.
First to take advantage of Dowmetal*
■was the aviation industry where its
uniquelightness combined with strength
is of untold value.
Gradually it found acceptance in in-
dustry—adding speed to machine parts,
cutting power costs, aiding transporta-
tion and speeding manual operations.
Finally, a year ago, Dowmetal entered
the household appliance field through
its adoption by The Hoover Company
for the famous Hoover One Fifty Clean-
ing Ensemble. So audible has been
customer enthusiasm for the amazing
lightness of that product that Hoover
designers determined to incorporate
this feature in the just-announced lower
priced Hoover Model 2 5.
Thus, the ambition for Dowmetal is
now realized. It is serving industry in
an ever broadening capacity and find-
ing its way into the homes of people
to gladden their hearts and lighten
their labors.

NEW LICHTS FOR DRAWING
DEPARTMENT
The Engineering Drawing Depart-
ment of the college has recently sub-
mitted a plan whereby the present light-
ing facilities for the drawing rooms
would be changed. Colonel Miller has
given his approval to these plans which
were made by members of an investi-
gating committee, and action on the
matter now rests with University offi-
cials. At present the lighting is very
inadequate for the type of work done.
In different locations in several rooms,
the illumination varies from six to eight-
een foot-candles. The proposed system
would provide new fixtures with the in-
direct type of inverted globe and an in-
crease of 100 percent in wattage. This
would result in a better distribution of
light and would give twenty-five foot
candles illumination throughout. For
the changeover, it would be necessary to
install heavier cables from the power
supply. It is estimated that the cost
for American Rolling Mill Company,
rooms, would be somewhat under $2,000
per room.
A MICHIGAN ENGINEER

Dr. John Chipman, a former research
engineer at the University of Michigan
has been appointed professor of metal-
lurgy at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Cambridge, Mass. He left
the research department in 1934 when
he became associate director of research
for American Rolling Mill Company,
Middletown, Ohio, and has been con-
nected with this concern until recently.
In 1934 Dr. Chipman was awarded the
Howe medal by the American Society
for Metals for his paper "Applications
of Themodynamics to the Deoxidation
of Liquid Steel."
NAVAL TANK ACTIVITIES
The Naval Tank has been busy with
research work and some power tests for
commercial ship design. Recent tests
included determination of the required
power for a 100 ft. Diesel yacht of wood
construction for the Pacific Coast and
for a 460 ft. 18 knot cargo vessel de-
signed by a New York naval architect.
A research program covering the ef-
fect of shallow water on the resistance
of various types of models has been
completed and the results are now being
prepared for publication. This tank
has also collaborated with The Newport
News Shipbuilding and Drydock Com-
pany and with the Canadian National
Research Council of Ottawa in a series
of tank tests to determine the effect on
the resistance of towed models of width
of tank. This influence on measured
resistance is known as "wall effect'' and
must be allowed for when models are
tested in narrow tanks.
NEW CYCLOTRON
The University of Michigan's famed
cyclotron is about to be reborn. The
present set-up, the largest in world at
time of its construction, has been in op-
eration for the last year and a half in
the first basement of the East Physics
Building. Under Professor Cork's
guiding hand it has created better than
one hundred new radioactive isotopes.
Although the cyclotron directly pro-
duces particles of only six and one-half
million electron volts energy, secondary
particles (neutrons) from bombarded
targets have energies as high as twenty
million electron volts. Since the con-
struction of the Michigan cyclotron, the
University of California has upped its
machine to a seven and one-half mil-
lion electron volt capacity. With the
addition of larger tanks and alterations
on the Michigan apparatus, a beam of
particles whose energy is close to twelve
million electron volts is expected. This
addition will again place Michigan on
the top of the pile, and will open new
fields for Professor Cork and his associ-
ates. It is hoped that the new set-up
will become effective in January.
SELENIUM FOR ALMA MATER
A mineral expert was recently solic-
ited by the Harvard Fund. He replied

with my bismuth in its present state,
pay antimony to all three, I hope you
will not think me a cadmuim if I do not

them down the zinc. Much better to

ise to selenium for dear old Alma Mater.

DICK WANCELIN
One of the most cheerful engineers on
the University of Michigan campus is
Dick Wangelin of Alpha Tau Omega.
That priceless asset—a pleasant smile—
seems to be a part of Richard and is
undoubtedly one of the reasons he has
won so many friends here at Michigan.
To begin way back when—Dick was
an outstanding student in his high
school days. While attending Belleville
Township High School in Belleville, Il-
linois, Dick was honored by receiving
both the Harvard and Washington Uni-
versity Alumni awards for general all-
around ability. His diversified abilities
were evidenced by his outstanding schol-
arship, a position on the varsity foot-
ball team and the leading role in several
plays, along with many other activities.
Upon graduation from high school
Dick chose the University of Michigan
for the further pursuance of his educa-
tion. Honor societies soon claimed him
and in this, his senior year, we find Dick
a member of Tau Beta Pi, Phi Eta
Sigma and Vulcans. Dick seems to have
the ability to "get into things" and, as
further evidence, we offer the fact that
Dick is secretary of the A.S.M.E., treas-
urer of Vulcans and the Engineering
Council, and former Sophomore Class
secretary.
Among Dick's non-engineering pur-
suits are fishing, golf, tennis, swimming
and intrafraternity athletics. And then,
of course, there is the feminine interest
and Herr Wangelin is reputedly a
"smoothie" with the campus Frauleins.
For soothing the soul Dick prefers
music—his secret passion is to be a good
singer—and he has been a consistent
listener at the Choral Union Concerts.
Upon graduation in June Dick hopes
to secure a job in his chosen profession
—mechanical engineering. He is par-
ticularly interested in Diesel Engines
and with the ability he has shown while
in school he should go a long way on
the road to real engineering achieve-
ment.
RECORD BUSTER
Newton's Third Law of Motion takes
an awful beating when big Ed Kirar
launches himself at a swimming pool,
and he doesn't worry a great deal about
all the retarding forces his professors
have told him about when he starts
churning those oversized flywheels of
his. The record books will tell you that.
He's come in first so often that if you
look close enough, you can find a "fin-
ishing bump" under the scalp that
Michigamua took last spring.
The Old Water Buffalo started out
while attending Kenosha High School
in Kenosha, Wisconsin by breaking the
state high school records in the hundred
and the fifty yard sprints. They were his
brother's records—he had to leave home.
After finishing second in the fifty
yard free style in the Big Ten meet dur-
ing his sophomore year at Wisconsin,
the coach wouldn't send him to the Na-
tional Collegiates because he wasn't
good enough. That hurt the Kirar fam-
ily swimming pride so much, he came to
Michigan the following year, grabbed
first place at the Nationals, and also
earned a place on the All-American
swimming team.
This year he captains Matt Mann's
club and has his goal pointed at offi-
cially breaking the world's record of .51
in the hundred. If it wasn't for the
fight he had last summer with an ex-
ploding Chris Craft engine that took a
one round decision over him, we'd pub-
lish the record breaking time in this
issue.
Ed is a Triangle and a Michigamua.
He is going to specialize in sanita-
tion and will undoubtedly clean up in
his profession. He is sure Wisconsin is
the best place in the world and espe-
cially Milwaukee. He certainly isn't
far wrong; at least he'll be able to keep
his figure. Best of luck, Ed, and we'll be
watching the newspapers.
ERNIE
Back in the dim, dark, days when '38
still meant freshman, there figured
among the Lit neophyte horde, a lad
from Perry, N. Y., named Ernie Tanzer.
Ernie had graduated from Perry High
a varsity man in football, basketball,
and baseball. During his first year at
Michigan, he continued to play base-
ball, and studied 'neath Angell Hall's
marble pillars. He became infinitely

wiser, and in his sophomore year trans-
ferred to the Engine School, pointing to-
wards a B.S. in Chem Engineering.
Once in his own element Ernie went
to town. Has since, besides continuing
his baseball, become a member of the
American Institute of Chemical Engi-
neering, and the American Society for
Metals. Honoraries Tau Beta Pi and
Vulcans claimed him in his junior and
senior years respectively. Recently
elected to the Engineering Council, he
also manages to hold down an N.Y.A.
job with the Department of Engineering
Research.
Ernie readily becomes romantic about
his work—is enthusiastic about the En-
gine School and the fellows in it. Tells
sheepishly about his first job, where, as
the only person, besides the layout man,
who professed to know anything about
engineering—his nascent reputation as
an engineer was at stake. Ernie got the
manhole in the wrong place on a large
storage tank—the customer inconsider-
ately refused it, and Ernie's struggling
rep was somewhat set back.
Ernie represents what we would like
to call a typical Michigan engineer. He
graduates this June, and we expect to
hear more of him. Best of Luck, Ernie.

OKONITE insulation with an unsurpassed record
since 1878 is still generally recognixed as the
acme of perfection for rubber insulations and as
"the best product possible" of its type.
The Okonite Company and its affiliates, how-
ever, have constantly kept step with the ad-
vances of the electric art.
Whether the wire or cable is large or small,
single or multiple conductor, high or low volt-
age, whether finished with a rubber or a syn-
thetic compound jacket, braid, lead sheath or
armor of any type, Okonite can make it.
In all cases, whether the correct solution calls
for rubber, impregnated paper, varnished cam-
bric, asbestos, glass or the newer synthetic
compounds, the policy still is and will continue
to be the best product possible.

SHARPSHOOTING TWO MILES
UNDERGROUND
CHOOTING HOLES through an oil-well casing at
^ a depth of two miles underground is another
problem successfully solved by electricity. The Lane-
Wells Company Gun Perforator is an ingenious
device used to pierce casings with steel bullets. When
an oil pocket has been exhausted, the operators
pierce the well casing at a different stratum, thus
opening another pocket.

In order lo know where to pierce the casing and how
deep the gun is, G-E electric locating, weight, and
depth instruments are mounted on a panel in a
truck from which the shots arc fired and the results
recorded. Over two and one half miles of steel-
sheathed cable is used to lower and fire the gun,
the current for the charge being carried in the core
of the cable. Accurate measurement of the depth at
which the gun strikes or leaves the fluid level in the
well is indicated to the operator by a weight in-
dicator which utilizes two General Electric Selsyn
motors.
In General Electric Company, numerous groups of
engineers devote their entire time to the most
efficient use of electricity in all types of industries.
These men, former members of the Test Course,
have solved many problems such as Sharpshooting
Two Miles Underground.

F. Perkinson, R. P. I., '24, a former Test man now
in the Erie Works of General Electric Company, in-
vented a machine which performs these operations
mechanically.
Computation by the step-by-step method of these
calculations necessitates many hours of tedious slide-
rule work; repeated adding and subtracting of
time, speed, and distance increments; and reading
of charts. The Transportation Calculator eliminates
this work and solves the mathematics at least five
times as quickly, depending upon the skill of the
operator.
The Transportation Department of General Elec-
tric Company offers many opportunities to
mechanical and electrical engineers in the design,
construction, and production of electric locomotives,
trolley cars, and trolley buses. The solutions of
many interesting problems are found in this depart-
ment, the Transportation Calculator being but one
of them.

power dives—all are found within the confines of
two steel rooms in the radio-transmitter test depart-
ment in the Schenectady Works of General Elec-
tric Company.
To assure perfect performance of aircraft trans-
mitters, the equipment is placed in these two rooms
where extremely severe weather conditions are
simulated. Portholes of one-inch glass in the rooms
permit the test men to observe the effects on the
instruments without being subjected to the same
strains placed upon the transmitters.
These complicated tests are made by college-trained
men now on Test. The field of radio transmission
from airplanes is, of course, new and progressive.
The "flight rooms" provide radio engineers with a
new and clearer conception of designs for radio
equipment.

makes Frames Better
This steel frame for a modern warehouse is hetter because all
of its parts have been oxy-acelylene welded into a single jointless
unit. It is light in weight, yet is strong, sturdy and rigid and can
support heavier loads than could a frame of similar materials
joined by any other method.
Frames for many things- from filing cabinets to railroad cars-
can be joined by welding. When welded, their maintenance-free
life is limited only by the design and materials used. These advan-
tages of oxv-acetylene welding are obtainable at no additional
cost or time for fabrication.
Several useful technical booklets descrihing the application of
this modern metalworking process to a wide range of metals-
steel and iron, aluminum, copper, brass and many other alloys
and metals—are available, without obligation, from Linde offices
in principal cities. Write to The Linde Air Products Company.

THIS MONTH, LAST MONTH, AND THE NEXT
Results of last month's questionnaire, all four replies, indicate,
chiefly, that the Christmas Holidays were more of a lure than our
little green mail-box. We are still counting on a more representative
poll and will try again in the near future.
This month, George R. Beach, Jr., Personnel Division, Du Pont, head-
lines the offerings with his, "Industry is Looking For . . . ." Mr. Beach
is a recruitor—you will be very much interested in what he looks for in
job-applicants. Chuck Probst, 39E, tells where the safe-plane is going
in his article, "Past, Present, and Future of the Safe-plane." Designed
for banquets and bull sessions is the TECHNICS scoop of the chemical
department: "The Thermodynamics Final."
The TECHNICS salary survey has brought in some really potent in-
formation. On the advice of several contributors, we are expanding the
scope of the survey and will contact 3000 more graduates, presenting
all of our more important findings in the March issue.

Technology Review
THERE seems to be quite a bit of
smoke in Washington concerning
the current recession. As students we
are primarily interested, selfishly enough,
in the effect the recession will have on
our job-possibilities. As members of
society, we may be considered narrow
in our concern over our chances at en-
gineering employment because any bus-
iness decline manifests itself throughout
the nation and we are but a small frac-
tion of those concerned. However, it
must be remembered that our educa-
tions were not picked out of the air;
that they represent considerable invest-
ment on the part of the state, the federal
government, ourselves, and our parents.
The only way that society at large can
realize on its investment is through our
contributions to the nation as engineers.
ff we are graduated into filling stations,
society would have been better served
by educating us to perform that par-
ticular function.
While the above may sound a bit
pessimistic, pessimism is certainly not
the impression one gets from the indus-
trial interviewers that have already vis-
ited the campus. The production of
steel may have dropped off, but as to
how long that condition will continue is
indicated by a letter (on the C. E. bul-
letin board) dated December 10, 1937.
It asks for recommendations of men for
employment with one of the large steel
companies. Recruitors, representing
nearly every type of industrial endeavor,
are as plentiful as they were last year
Jobs for Seniors?
or
Whistling in the Dark
at this time. Moreover, concrete job-
offers are equal to those of last year.
Several of the rubber companies have
either offered contracts or have asked
seniors to come down to Akron for a
supplementary interview. Last year's
usual initial salary offer of $125 per
month has been exceeded in nearly
every case, the average being around
$135, with a few at $155. As one
interviewer told a group of seniors:
"... industry goes ahead largely on
its engineering personnel; any particular
company's ability to pass a competitor
goes back to the quality of the engi-
neering service it is receiving." Reces-
sion or no, "... industry must have
trained engineers in its ranks when the
need for their services arises." To mal-
form an old saying: "A trained engi-
neer in the plant, aware of the com-
pany's needs and methods, is worth two
in a filling station."
So much for the interviewer during
these first few recession months. It
appears that, to date, industry has not
departed from its pre-recession demands
for young engineers.
The Technic has on hand a consider-
able number of replies to letters sent out
in a job-survey of Michigan engineering
graduates. All of these were written in
the past month or six weeks. None of
them mention the recession. That sounds
encouraging—but perhaps the curtail-
ment of production has not yet reached
the engineering departments. We are not
trying to say that the recession is not
a fact; instead, we would like to show
that, while prospects may be dark, we
have yet to be effected by the slump, be
it temporary or permanent.
One excerpt from these many interest-
ing letters might serve to explain the
fact that recruitors are still recruiting
and that engineers in industry learn
about the recession from the newspapers.
This writer, a mechanical engineer, class
of 1928, now plant engineer for his
company, says: "Industry as a whole is
now accepting engineers as being as
necessary as accountants or the usual
operating personnel found in any com-
pany." This is a decided departure
from pre-depression tactics of letting
out engineers as the first move toward
retrenchment. He goes on to say: "One
executive told me that his company (a
large one) realizes now that they made
a serious mistake by letting out their
engineers during the last depression."
All this is very encouraging. Per-
haps returns from the 3000 letters that
the Technic will mail to Michigan
engineering graduates in the near future
will tell more about the effects of the
recession on those already in industry.
At any rate, seniors are being inter-
viewed. We think it a good guess that
they are being interviewed, not to garner
fashion notes nor to feel out political
trends, but for engineering jobs.

LAURENCE G. LENHARDT
COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC WORKS
CITY OF DETROIT
WHEN a young engineering gradu-
ate leaves school to seek employ-
ment, he will find that first impressions
carry considerable weight with a pros-
pective employer. The employer may be
impressed by high scholastic standings,
but he is even more impressed if these
are accompanied by desirable person-
ality traits. Advancement in the engi-
neering profession demands something
beyond strictly technical ability.
Engineering deals much with the hu-
man equation. Usually half of the cost
of a construction job, and a very appre-
ciable proportion of the cost of machine
products, goes to pay the wages of labor.
In actual practice, the largest prob-
lems that confront the engineer are
often those dealing with human rela-
tionships. An argument over a line fence
may present to a surveyor a problem in
diplomacy equaling anything Europe
has to offer. Likewise, getting a willing
most out of a gang of men, be it in a
shop or on a construction job, is a prob-
lem not taught in the technical schools.
Yet the successful engineer must get the
cooperation of those who work for him.
Brilliant engineers are those who can in-
spire others to do their best. An out-
standing example of such brilliance may
be found in the career of Charles Ket-
tering, Director of the General Motors
Research Laboratory. With all due re-
gards to Mr. Kettering's proven ability
as an engineer, there is no question but
that he owes a large part of his success
to his ability to inspire an organization
and to instill confidence in his em-
ployers and the public. It is seldom one
finds such a keen, enthusiastic organi-
zation as Mr. Kettering's, and it is due
solely to the spirit of the man at the top.
Furthermore, Mr. Kettering is an un-
usually good speaker and can present a
technical subject in such an enthusiastic
manner as to carry any audience.
Those engineers who go into munici-
pal work will have contact not only
with the public, but also with politi-
cians, who are dependent upon the votes
of the public for their continuation in
office. It should be borne in mind that
the continuation of tenure of certain
politicians may also make it possible for
the engineer to continue in his position.
Hence, we see that the engineer is sell-
ing not only technical services, but also
his personality.
It may seem like a trifle, but the in-
jury to shade trees by new sidewalks is
a major problem in the life of the home
owner, and the engineer would do well
to realize this. Mrs. A., who has the per-
secution complex and complains about
virtually everything under the sun, will
have to be soothed. Likewise, Mrs. B.,
who is a crank on civic cleanliness, will
have to be dealt with gently when the
garbage or rubbish collector is not there
exactly on schedule. Neighborhood as-
sociations, each with its own peculiar
problems, must also be dealt with. An

irate housewife who is demanding that
the street be oiled — when there are no
appropriations — must be pacified. All
these are small things in themselves, yet
intensely real to the complainant.
One of the best examples demonstrat-
infj: the human element in engineering
occurred almost forty years ago, when
a certain city in the state was building
its first sewer system. Professor H. E.
Riggs was consulting engineer on the
work and let the contract to the lowest
bidder. The contractor moved down
from the lumber woods with a gang of
husky lumberjacks but soon was into
difficulties because of poor soil condi-
tions. In order to get the job clone with
profit to himself, he tried to "bull" the
job through. When an inspector got in
the way or objected, he was promptly
taken care of by the lumberjacks. Pro-
fessor Riggs countered by hiring the
larger elements of the University of
Michigan football team, who, from all
accounts, were plenty large, and made
them inspectors. After a few prelimi-
nary skirmishes the trouble on the job
stopped, and the work was completed
according to specifications. The point to
be made from this story is that, regard-
less of plans and specifications and good
intent, there would have been a poor job
handed over to the city had not some
human engineering been done.
Contrast the handling of this situa-
tion with one that resulted in the loss
oi $1,000,000 to a certain mid western
city where a poorly inspected sewer col-
lapsed. It is interesting to know that at
the same time the sewer which collapsed
was being built, another city department
was building a larger and more difficult
tunnel. This other job proved to be a
very successful undertaking. The sole
difference between the two jobs was in
the personnel that handled the inspec-
tion work.
Those who build machines and equip-
ment must always contend with the hu-
man element. A housewife can do things
to home equipment that no designer
would believe could happen, but contin-
gencies must be provided for. For in-
stance, it is a small matter to put a soft
key between a motor and a piece of
equipment. Then, when the inevitable
happens and the equipment becomes
jammed, the key shears, and the motor
is not burned out. There are some things
that the designing engineers imagine

should not happen, and yet those things
do happen. We have all run across cases
where simple precautions have not been
taken because the designer evidently be-
lieved his product would be operated by
first class mechanics, rather than by
people with little mechanical instinct.
The automotive designers have done
virtually everything possible to make an
automobile fool-proof. Yet they cannot
guarantee that someone will not shift
from first directly into reverse, nor go
exploring with a lighted match in a
gasoline tank to see how much gasoline
he has. Still more to the point is the fact
that most of the airplane crashes in the
last two years have been found to be
due to the human element. According to
Department of Air Commerce statistics,
very few accidents occur from mechani-
cal or structural failures.
It is indeed a far cry from the "public
be damned" policy of certain of our pio-
neers to the "customer is always right"
policy of our modern department stores.
The most successful utility companies in
recent years are those which have culti-
vated amicable customer relationships.
As the executives of most utility com-
panies come, to a large degree, from en-
gineering ranks, it is easy to appreciate
the value of a knowledge of simple
"let 's-get-along-edness."
The foregoing examples are cited to
show that engineering, in its broadest
sense, is far from being only an exact
science. Dealing as it does with every
problem of the human equation, from
the laborer on the construction job to
the housewife in the home, complete
and successful engineering depends very
much on the factor of human relations.

lowest temperature which is to be en-
countered in the operation of the car.
Because the motor fuel must be vapor-
ized before it can be burned in the en-
gine cylinder, it also is necessary to
change the volatility of the motor fuel
used according to the atmospheric tem-
peratures to be encountered in service,
if reasonably uniform and satisfactory
performance is to be obtained under
different operating conditions.
Fifteen years ago the use of motor
cars was largely a fair-weather per-
formance. With the first fall of snow,
the car was usually put in dead storage
with blocks under the axles. Hibernation
continued until after snow and ice were
removed from the surface of the ground
early in the spring.
At that time the motorist's attention
was called to the uniform characteristics

of a particular brand of gasoline, rather
than to the uniformly excellent per-
formance obtained from its use, and the
surveys made by the United States
Bureau of Mines indicated no signifi-
cant differences in the volatility or dis-
tillation characteristics of the average
motor fuel sold during the winter and
summer months. The standard distilla-
tion test for motor fuel consists in dis-
tilling 100 c.c. of the liquid fuel from a
125 c.c. distilling flask according to the
specifications of the American Society
for Testing Materials. The distillation
must be conducted at a specified uni-
form rate, the distillate is condensed,
and collected in the same graduate used
for measuring the motor fuel poured into
the flask. A curve is then drawn as
shown in the figure, in which the tem-
perature of the vapors leaving the dis-
tilling flask is plotted as a function of
the volume percent of fuel which has
been distilled out of the flask.
The average distillation curves as re-
ported in the United States Bureau of
Mines Survey for 1923 and for 193o-
1937 are plotted in the figure. The
summer gasoline of 1936 is more vola-
tile, that is, has a greater percentage
distilled at the same temperature, than
the winter gasoline of 1923; and the
winter gasoline of 1936-1937 is much
more volatile than the current summer
gasoline.

«asoline is a carefully planned change
made by the refining divisions of the
petroleum industry to give the best pos-
sible motor car performance throughout
the year, and has been generally fol-
lowed only during the past few years.
About ten years ago the Natural
Gasoline Association of America fi-
nanced a research project at the Uni-
versity to determine the relationship
between motor fuel volatility, atmos-
pheric temperature, and engine perform-
ance. As a result of these investigations
which covered three years of laboratory
and road tests including "cold room"
tests in the refrigerated chamber of the
highway department, a fairly definite re-
lationship was found between the dis-
tillation characteristics of the fuel, at-
mospheric temperature, and performance
of the motor car.
The complete results are available in
Bulletin 14 of the Department of En-
gineering Research but are summarized
in the figure by means of the vertical
lines drawn at 10 per cent and 50 per
cent. These lines bear figures indicat-
ing atmospheric temperatures in degrees
Fahrenheit, and may be used to indi-
cate the changes in fuel volatility re-
quired to give equivalent performance
of cold motors at different atmospheric
temperatures.
The more or less vertical line at 10
per cent indicates the starting character-
istics of the fuel. For example, the
summer gasoline of 1923 intersects this
line at about 32 F., indicating that
this fuel will give easy starting of a cold
engine in good mechanical condition at
atmospheric temperatures as low as 32
F. The winter gasoline, 1936-1937, in-
tersects this curve at 0° F. and will give
equally easy starting at 0' F. The line

Technology Review
J^a5tf fttteent, and
rutute oi the jla-ke-Ptane
by
CHARLES PROBST, '39E
ONE of the most popular subjects of
discussion in the aviation world to-
day is the safe-plane movement. From
the term "safe-plane" do not infer that
all others are unsafe. This term is ap-
plied to planes developed under the im-
petus of a movement by the Department
of Commerce to sponsor the building of
planes cheaper, simpler, and safer to fly.
In view of the recent developments,
some of which have already been de-
scribed in the Technic, a review of
these developments and a forecast of the
future would be in order.
The safe-plane movement was pre-
ceded by the construction of the original
safe-plane in 1932 by Fred C. Weick
under the sponsorship of the National
Advisory Council on Aviation. Mr.
Weick built a pusher type high wing
monoplane with two tail booms and a
tricycle type of landing gear. He ex-
perimented with the elimination of one
of the controls and was successful, not
only in this, but in the development of
a glide control flap which has found
adoption on most of today's safe-planes.
His three-wheeled landing gear, while
copied from a 1912 Curtiss pusher,
was, nevertheless, the first to be used on
a modern plane, and is a fundamental
feature of almost every safe-plane to-
day. It may be said, therefore, that
Mr. Weick is the actual originator of
today's safe-plane.
It was in September, 1935, that the
Department of Commerce, under the
influence, prehaps. of Mr. Weick's ex-
periments, announced that it would
foster the development of a $700 air-
plane for the average man. Ten thou-
sand questionnaires were sent out to pi-
lots, mechanics, and prospective flyers
throughout the country. "Would you
buy a $700 airplane if a satisfactory one
were available?" "What features would
you expect on such a craft?" "Would
you favor a two control system in favor
of the present three?" These and sim-
ilar questions were replied to with great
enthusaism. "We certainly would buy
such a plane. Where is it? Lead us to
it." Wide publicity was attracted by
the questionnaire, and soon the average
man was inquiring where he could get
this $700 "air-e-o-plane."
It did not take long to prove that
when the cheapest satisfactory engine
costs $2000, the plane cannot be sold for
$700. The Department then issued the
statement that it would be quite some
time before the average man could have
a $700 airplane, but that the Depart-
ment would encourage the development
of planes simpler and safer to fly. Be-
cause it needed some thirty or forty for
its inspectors, the Department an-
nounced that it would purchase any
two-place plane which would meet its
specifications.
One of the first moves toward the
$700 price class was the trial of auto-
motive engines in planes. Some time
ago, the Franklin Motor Company put
one of its motors in a plane for an
advertising stunt; but the first plane
designed for an automotive power plant
was the Fahlin Plymacoupe. Built in
8
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Plymouth six cylinder motor, the plane
attracted considerable attention, but
never got beyond this stage. The plane,
a clean cut high-wing monoplane, had a
reasonably fast top speed and landed
quite slowly, even though penalized by
the excess weight of the motor.
Since this first attempt, about a half a
dozen planes have been designed and
built for automotive power plants. The
McGaffey Aviate with a Ford V-8, the
Campbell pusher with a Ford V-8, and
the Casey Jones Amphibian with a Ter-
raplane motor are outstanding examples.
Also found on the Casey Jones am-
phibian is the V-belt system to transmit
the power from the engine to the pro-
peller, a direct outgrowth of the use of
automotive engines. Automotive engines
running at about 4000 r.p.m. needed a
2:1 gearing system to give the proper
propeller speed. This not only added
weight, but required a special propeller
rotating in a clockwise direction. The
V-belts were light in weight, gave the
proper rotation, and were proved in tests
in 1936 to be able to satisfactorily trans-
mit 100 h.p. There are two experimen-
tal planes now in the air with an auto-
motive engine and V-belts to transmit
the power to the propeller.
Working on the safety and simplicity
of control instead of the cost, three com-
panies completed designs utilizing air-
craft power plants. The first of these
was the Hammond, a low wing pusher
with tail booms and a three-wheel land-
ing gear. This ship, while it created
considerable attention, was not satis-
factory and was rejected by the Depart-
ment of Commerce because of insuffi-
cient top speed.
About the same time, Waldo Water-
man resurrected the tailless principle
and designed a two-place pusher with
three-wheel landing gear. The plane
used a Menasco four cylinder 125 h.p.
air-cooled engine. It was flown to
Washington for Bureau of Commerce
acceptance.
The third of these first aircraft en-
Fined safe-planes was the roadable auto-
giro, developed by Pitcairn. It was a
two-place direct control autogiro with
an English Pobjoy 90 h.p. motor behind
the seat, so arranged as to drive a pro-
peller in front, or a single rear wheel on
the road.
This year has seen refinements to all
of these designs to make them more ac-
ceptable, both to the Department of
Commerce, and to the general public.
The Hammond, incorporating with
Stearman and moving to Los Angeles
from Ypsilanti, produced a completely
redesigned Stearman-Hammond along
the same general lines as the first Ham-
mond Y, but considerably cleaned up.
A complete description of this ship can
be found in a previous issue of the
Technic, but it will suffice to say that
it is a two-place pusher, powered with a
Menasco 150 h.p. air-cooled motor. It
has a three-wheel landing gear, tail
booms, good flaps and wheel brakes, and
a well worked out control system which
eliminates the use of the rudder.
A new entry in the field is the Gwinn
Aircar, a two-placed close-coupled bi-
plane, powered with an English Pobjoy
90 h.p. seven cylinder radial engine, and
using a three-wheel landing gear. Es-
pecially notable is the use of automotive
type controls, the rudder having been
eliminated. A steering wheel which
slides in and out, a foot accelerator, and
an automotive type dashboard all add
to the effect.
Introduced early in 1935, the Arrow
Sport, a two-place conventional low
wing monoplane, powered with a Ford
V-8 converted motor, has grown in pop-
ularity until it is well established in the
industry today. Because the Ford motor
is held down to 3075 r.p.m. for long life,
the 82 h.p. developed gives the plane a
rather underpowered performance. De-
spite the fact that its top speed is but
95 m.p.h., the SI 500 selling price of the
plane makes it one of the top sellers of
its type.
Early in 1937 Waterman publicly
showed his roadable tailless plane, pow-
ered wtih a converted Studebaker 100
h.p. motor. A two unit control system,
standard Studebaker pedals for brakes
and flaps, and some Studebaker instru-
ments add to the automotive effect. A
well worked out transmission system
transmits the power to the pusher pro-
peller through six V-belts while the
plane is in the air. On the ground, a
simple cranking motion disconnects the
propeller from the engine, and with the
wings removed, a clutch pedal engages
four grooved rubber pulleys to drive the
plane, or half plane, at an advertised
speed of 70 m.p.h. As an actual fact,
the maximum comfortable road speed is

nose wheel tends to float at higher
speeds.
A University of Michigan develop-
ment (Technic, May, 1937) is the
Thorhawk. This two-place low wing
monoplane is powered with a Ford V-8
motor set low in the rear of the short
body, the power being transmitted to
the propeller through the six V-belts.
Thus far all is straightforward. How-
ever, the tail is supported by a single
boom projecting through a three inch
hollow propeller shaft. This boom is
braced by two struts from the wing,
making the plane rather clean, aero-
dynamically.
It might be interesting to digress a
bit here to comment on the adoption
of the three-wheel landing gear by other
larger ships. Since Weick's work in
1932, three-wheel landing gears have ap-
peared on the following ships other than
those here described: Curtiss Wright
amphibian in 1935: Navy Douglas am-
phibian in 1936; Waco N four place
biplane in 1937; and Douglas four
motor transport in 1938.
What, then, is the future of the light
plane? The safe-plane? What of the
present designs? Of those described,
only the Arrow and the Stearman-
Hammond are available at the present
time. Those supposedly available in
the near future include: the Studebaker
Waterman, the Gwinn Aircar, and the
roadable autogiro. Of the remainder,
all except the Thorhawk have been out
for considerable time with no signs of
development. But how do those avail-
able fill the requirements?
According to a survey of the industry
itself, conducted by Aviation in De-
cember, 1936, the specifications of the
ideal safe-plane were as follows: two-
place engine of about 100 h.p., three-
wheel landing gear, 500 mile range, 120
m.p.h. top speed. 35-40 m.p.h. landing
speed. Opinion was neatly divided on
the question of automotive engines.
Thus, three of our five planes fill all
of these specifications. Of the others.
the Arrow is a perfectly conventional
low wing monoplane with a Ford V-8
power plant. It handles like any other
light plane, and is relatively slow, but
low priced. It demonstrates that a con-
ventional automotive engine may be
used in a conventional plane with slight
sacrifice in performance and consider-
able reduction in price. It is a boon to
10
the flyer who can afford only 40 h.p.
light planes, but it does not enter into
our safe-plane developments.
The roadable autogiro is interesting
because of its relative foolproof han-
dling. It is of rather complicated de-
sign, with a clutch for propeller, one
for rear wheel, and one for rotor. There
is a shaft running between the seat
from the rear engine to the propeller
gear box, from which another shaft goes
to the rotor. These additional units plus
the rotor blades and the use of an
Fnglish aircraft engine increase the cost
above our consideration.
The Gwinn Aircar, again using an air-
craft engine, will be fairly high priced.
Its automotive type control with rudder
eliminated and its three-wheel landing
gear are good features. Its freakish ap-
pearance will make it difficult to sell to
the general public.
Much the same thing can be said
for the Stearman-Hammond. Its ease
of control on the ground or in the air.
its safety features, its luxury of appoint-
ment, and its performance are its assets.
As liabilities it lists a definite un-air-
plane-like appearance, a large 150 h.p.
motor, and a $6500 price tag.
The Waterman is not only very effi-
cient aerodynamically, but in addition
to most of the Stearman-Hammond's
features, it boasts a proposed $2000
price tag and a motor giving 16 miles
per gallon in the air and on the ground.
On the other hand, it looks the least
like an airplane of any of our prodigies.
Regardless of how efficient a design
may be, if the public does not think it
looks like an airplane, the plane will not
sell. It is my opinion that the Water-
man tailless Arrobile, for all of its ad-
vantages, cannot sell in quantities be-
cause of its appearance. "Airplanes have
tails, and they can't fly without them."
The low priced plane for large con-
sumption by private buyers must be of
at least semi-conventional appearance.
Whether the public will accept a tail
boom pusher must decide the design.
The power plant problem remains
still to be solved. While automotive en-
gines are functioning satisfactorily, they
are penalizing the planes with their ex-
cess weight. The solution lies in the de-
velopment of an engine suitable for both
light aircraft and rear engine cars. A
radial or V-8, air cooled engine, small—
to give smoothness and to be able to
run at high speeds with dependability
and economy, supercharged—to give the
car acceleration and the airplane alti-
tude performance, running at high
speeds—to give efficiency, could be built
to develop over 90 h.p. from an engine
the size of a Ford 60. Such an engine
could weigh less than 250 pounds and
give better than 20 miles per gallon.
Combine this engine with a V-belt
drive in a low wing pusher with tail
booms and three-wheel landing gear, of
as conventional appearance as possible,
with a simplified control system pat-
terned after that of a car, and I believe
we have the airplane to bring the private
flyers out in larger droves.
Until such an engine is developed, we
will have to be content with the Ford
V-8 and similar motors, with their
weight handicap. Rear engine cars, due
in a few years, will aid in the develop-
ment of the private plane, but it will
still be quite some time before we have
a plane at $700.
The
Stearman-
Hammond
safe-plane gives
16 miles to
the gallon.

INVENTIONS
SUPPOSE, first, that a mans back-
ground is bountifully crammed with
ideas, facts, principles and relationships.
N'ext assume that he is so placed that
he can envisage needs as yet unfulfilled.
Then—provided he has an active imag-
ination—that man may become an in-
ventor. The engineering student is in
the process of acquiring just the back-
ground mentioned above. As an engi-
neer he will almost certainly have
numerous chances to see the gaps. It
follows at once that a large share of the
inventing of tomorrow will be done by
engineering students of today.
Perhaps engineering students do have
as active an interest in invention as they
should. But if their usually complete
lack of useful information about the
subject means anything, one would
guess otherwise. Actually, they are
interested, but uninformed.
The most universal belief about pat-
ents is, that if A has patented a device,
B may make one of the said device, pro-
vided he makes one only, and only for
his own use. There is no truth what-
ever in this belief.
Many uninformed inventors think
that their best protection lies in being
as secretive as possible. It may some-
times work out best that way. But
usually, an inventor's first move is to
protect himself by creating evidence of
conception (on paper), and getting it
witnessed by two people who are se-
lected because they can understand the
idea as explained by the inventor and
his evidence.
Later, a patent may be applied for.
The whole idea of the patent laws is to
encourage disclosure rather than secrecy.
On the one hand, the inventor discloses
his ideas to the world, through his pat-
ent; on the other hand, the government
Rives him the right to keep anyone else
from using the ideas, except by consent.
To be patentable, an idea must pos-
sess novelty: it must be useful and capa-
ble of being put into operation; and it
must not introduce a hazard to public
morals or health. As to being novel, it
must be new to all rather than simply
new to the inventor. In this connection,
a live-wire engineering student should
expect to find himself re-inventing a
number of good old ideas, as he pro-
ceeds through college. It is possible for
an instructor to describe to a class of
students, a need with which he is fa-
miliar; and he can be confident that the
class will collectively suggest several
solutions within a few minutes—all of
them old, of course. The same sug-
gestions will be made, semester after se-
mester. The students are thinking of
the same need, and their backgrounds
are more or less alike.
Sometimes one is surprised. The
writer was describing a patented device
to a class a few years ago, when a sen-
ior raised his hand and proposed another
way to do the trick. It was a new way.
or so it appeared after checking with a
leader in the field represented. Very
probably, the senior had made a patent-
able invention. However, it does not
yet appear that there is sufficient merit
in the idea to warrant the expense of
obtaining a patent.
Knowledge of the field to which the
invention applies is almost essential.
Without that knowledge, there is every
chance that one will waste time re-in-
venting. For example, we learn that
there are some 600 or 700 patents al-
ready taken out on fuel pumps. A per-
son who sets out "blind" to invent a fuel
pump is almost certain to think of nu-
merous patented schemes, and v&gt;0 realty
new idea. Whereas, if he ity^. nnle
money in copies of all these »■. uo
will get a fine education in fuel pumps,
and it may stimulate him to think of
just the idea that will be better than
all the others. And again, it may not—
but his time will be saved.
It is possible for the inventor to make
out his own application for a patent;
but it is unthinkable that he should do
so until he has read a book or two.
After reading the book, he will be horri-
fied to realize that he ever thought of
doing it himself. He will get an attor-
ney. Almost any attorney can write
the application—but if you are wise
you will not let "any attorney" do it.
Turn that job over to a patent attorney,
and a good one. The wrong attorney
may get you a patent, all right; but it
is more likely than not to be worthless.
Why? Because the idea was never
worth patenting anyway: but he will
not tell you that. How are you going
to be put in touch with a reputable
firm of patent attorneys? Ask a fac-
ulty member; or go to a reputable man-
ufacturer and ask him.
All this emphasis on patents should
not lead one into thinking that the
inventor should invariably try to patent
his ideas. On the contrary, it is often
possible to market an invention before
it is patented. How to do so, is too
much of an order for this brief paper:
again the suggestion is, read a book.
One very interesting book is by Ray-
mond F. Yates, on "The Art of In-
venting and What to Invent," priced at
around $3.00 and put out by Appleton.
A book I have not seen, but wish to look
into, is "Inventions and Their Man-
agement," by Berle and de Camp—In-
ternational Textbook Company.
Suppose you have an idea that is
new, as far as you know. But suppose
that many capable men have been work-
ing in that field for decades. Does it
almost follow that they already will
have thought of the idea? It most cer-
tainly does—but not always. There
have been notable exceptions, and there
always will be.
There is an old saying, that "Neces-
sity is the mother of invention." There
is much truth in it. But uninformed
inventors make so many mistakes, and
come out of their activities with a loss
so frequently, that we need another say-
ing for them—Invention can be the
mother of necessity.

(2a5t SJton
by
PROFESSOR RICHARD SCHNEIDEWIND
CAST irons have often been regarded
by the engineer and the metal-
lurgist as the black sheep in a respect-
able family of commercial metals which
go to make up engineering structures
and whose presence is tolerated only
because of their cheapness and ease of
procurement. Although the quality and
physical properties of fabricated steels
have been greatly improved in the last
twenty years, the amount of cast ferrous
metals used has not diminished. In
1936, according to Iron Age, 48,000,000
tons of steel ingots were poured which
resulted in 32,000,000 tons of finished
steel. In the same period approximately
the following quantities of cast ferrous
materials were produced:
Steel castings 2,000,000 tons
Malleable iron castings 750,000 tons
Cray iron castings 12,000,000 tons
Thus, on a tonnage basis, almost one-
half as much cast material was sold as
finished steel.
In order to determine why cast iron
has remained in the picture in view of
the well-publicized advances in steel, it
may help to look backward twenty
years. Of the two general types of
irons, malleable and gray, let us con-
sider malleable iron first.

A malleable iron mix, due to its chem-
ical composition, will produce a white
iron casting when poured into the mold.
White iron is a hard and extremely brit-
tle material whose only commercial ap-
plication is found when the service en-
tails only hardness and wear resistance.
But, by packing the material in ore or
other like substance and heating for a
period of 100 to ISO hours through a
cycle of temperatures, a soft, ductile and
malleable product was obtained. Th"
physical properties obtainable in 1919
are contrasted with those obtainable
today according to A.S.T.M. specifica-
tions and show the development which
has gone on in this industry.
Today

Tensile strength, p.s.i 45,000 53,000
Yield point, p.s.i 35.000
Elongation, per cent 7.5 18.0
Work done in some of the more pro-
Ph'itos bv Sckiieidefrind
gressive foundries and at the University
of Michigan has shown that, by proper
appreciation of the metallurgical fea-
tures of the process, the time for anneal-
ing could be greatly reduced. The foun-
dry producing the largest tonnage in the
United States is annealing in 31 hours.
Another Michigan foundry has found
that by modifications in the chemical
composition they could further reduce
this time to 13 hours. Contrast this
figure with the 100 to ISO hours neces-
sary twenty years ago. New annealing
furnaces embodying modern control
features and designed to take advantage
of the findings of metallurgical research
have made possible this great reduction
in time, fuel, and attendant annealing
costs.
Competition with cast steel has al-
ways been keen. Cast steel is apt to
cost more per pound but has a yield
point, when unalloyed, between 37,500

which is higher than ordinary malleable
iron. The iron referred to above as
annealing in 13 hours also possesses
superior properties, giving a yield point
of from 45,000 to 50.000 pounds per
square inch, tensile strength 60,000 to
65,000 pounds per square inch and an
elongation of 18 to 20 per cent.
Research at the University showed
that, if the carbon content were reduced
to 1.5 per cent and the silicon increased
to 1.5 per cent, the annealing time could
be as low as six hours and the tensile
strength around 70.000 pounds per
square inch.
By variations in heat treatment, for
example a quench and draw instead of
complete annealing, and by the addi-
tion of small quantities of alloys, a large
series of physical properties are now be-
ing obtained, thus enlarging the number
of uses for this material. If some of the
carbon is precipitated as temper carbon
during heat treatment, the resulting pro-
duct is malleable iron or a "heat treated
malleable" depending on the extent of
the treatment.
One of the large automobile manufac-
turers is using a low carbon white iron
with a heat treatment to give temper
carbon and a pearlitic matrix (heat
treated malleable) for brake drums. By
addition to the same base metal of a
small quantity of alloy which restrains
the formation of temper carbon, a suit-
able steel casting material for crank-
shafts and camshafts is obtained. In
this manner we can see how the same
starting material produces a steel or a

"heat treated malleable" with slight
modification in composition or heat
treatment.
This general boundary type of ma-
terial lying between steel and iron is the
result of years of research and has made
available suitable physical properties at
a greatly reduced cost as compared with
a steel forging.
Similar although even less publicized
or spectacular development is going on
in the cast iron field. Twenty years
ago the average gray iron had a tensile
strength varying between 15,000 and
20,000 pounds per square inch. Iron
can be purchased today on A.S.T.M.
specification with a guaranteed tensile
strength of 20,000, 30,000, 40,000,
50,000. or even 60,000 pounds per
square inch depending upon the class of
iron specified.
Aside from the advantages of being
cast to shape, superior machinability
and low cost, grav iron has some inher-

ent characteristics which place it above
other materials for certain purposes. To
illustrate its wear resistance, brake
drums for interstate bus service are be-
ing produced which give a service life
well over 150,000 miles. Since the ad-
vent of faster automobiles practically
every manufacturer uses gray iron for
the wearing surface of brake drums and
clutch pressure plates. Steel would
score and warp under modern conditions
of service.
In railroad work, gray iron steam
cylinder parts are giving a service life
of over 100,000 miles. For gasoline and
diesel engines, cast iron cylinder sleeves
and liners are almost universally used.
Due to the contained graphite this ma-
terial resists metal to metal wear which
can be further increased by simple heat
treatment.
Research on the proper use of alloys
in gray irons has made possible many
new commercial applications such as re-
frigerator pump crankshafts, parts for
hydraulic mechanisms for machine tools,
and castings for high pressure service.
Most of these twenty years ago would
have been made of steel at a higher cost.
In addition through the use of higher
quantities of alloys a large number of
heat resistant and corrosion resistant
parts are now obtainable in the cast
condition.
In the metallurgical field as in any
other field, competition between prod-
ucts is keen. The designing engineer in
specifying materials is, of course, inter-
ested solely in obtaining adequate physi-
cal properties at the lowest cost. It
would, therefore, seem that as research
in cast irons goes on, these materials will
receive increasingly serious consideration
as materials of engineering construction.

"DEHIND the soda counter of one of
*-* our local chain drug stores an
interesting little drama has taken place
during the past year. The characters
in this real life playlet showed, for all
who cared to observe, their reaction to
their jobs. They gave a very apt il-
lustration of the personal characteristics
that industry seeks in the college men
it employs.
Regular customers at this soda foun-
tain always made a practice of going to
the back counter for their sandwiches
and milk shakes because they knew that
Jim would give them faster, smoother
and more courteous service than any of
the other boys. If you were a regular
visitor, Jim knew your name and
greeted you, he almost anticipated your
order. Your glass of water and napkin
were in front of you practically before
you drew up to the counter, your order
was never forgotten and you didn't
have to wait for the check. Naturally.
Jim received more tips than the other
boys and when the chain opened an-
other branch no one was surprised that
he was made its manager.
This promotion had an electric effect
on practically all of the other boys be-
hind the counter. Most of them started
to work much harder, a few, of course,
remained unchanged. Several months
have elapsed since Jim's transfer and
most of the boys who were stimulated
by his advance have fallen back into
their old ways. One of them, Bill, has
however, continued to do a bang-up job.
So here in this little backwater of our
twentieth century commercial life we
have a very searching illustration of
the types of men that industry is looking
for. The self starters like Jim are, of'
course, the most sought after. Unfor-
tunately, they represent a very small
percentage of the people in the world.
Next in demand are the Bills, men who
only need to be shown a goal to be as
good as the Jims. Then there is the
vast group who want to get ahead but
lack the persistence and aggressiveness
to keep up with the others in the day-
by-day work. Finally there is that res-
idue who don't seem to try or to care.
They get the poorer jobs when the
others types of men have been snapped
up. Theirs is a life of insecurity and
many jobs.
Most industry today is a team effort.
It is important that certain members of
the team be specialists in their field, but
their efforts to be successful must be
subordinated to the interests of the team
as a whole. It is for this reason that
men with a sound technical background
supported by the ability to easily meet
and cooperate with others are the most
sought after. There is no mystery to
the selection of college men by industry.
It is a very simple commonsense opera-
tion. Actually, by the time a young
man presents himself for an employment

interview in his senior year the die has
long since been cast. His four or more
years in college tell a tale that is easy
to read.
Good marks, extracurricular activi-
ties and other aspects of college life are
not virtues in themselves, but are only
important when considered in relation
to the general rounded development of
the man. We are all familiar with the
spectacle of the grind as well as that of
the All-American athlete. Preoccupation
in one phase of college life has obscured
for them the demands of normal every-
day existence. Perhaps primary im-
portance is attached to marks because
they are evidence of success in the pur-
pose for which one goes to college. Only
a genius can be Tau Beta Pi, All-Ameri-
can end and earn 100 per cent of his
expenses. So in selecting men, industry
attempst to evaluate the more common
aspects of a college career.

THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


A Recruiter's View of the Ever-interesting
Employment Problem
Any industrial organization and per-
haps particularly the larger ones present
a rather bewildering array of jobs. Prob-
ably the easiest way in which to analyze
yourself in relation to these opportuni-
ties is to reduce them to their simplest
functions. Fundamentally, engineering
opens up to its graduates three general
lines of endeavor—research, production
and sales. Your suitability for any one
of these fields really depends on quali-
ties within yourself; preferences, preju-
dices and ways of thinking and acting
that have been maturing in you for the
past several years. Research, for in-
stance, presupposes mental excellence
with its resulting high academic stand-
ing, because industrial research of to-
day is so intricate and requires such a
solid technical background that a man
is lost who has merely been exposed to
education without thoroughly absorbing
its lessons and techniques. Training can
develop the ability to carry on research
but the urge to do this sort of work must
be born in a man. Great researchers are
not dissimilar to great portrait painters,
the love of the work and the urge to
successful accomplishment are almost
inherent.
Success in the sales field is almost al-
ways predicated on the enjoyment in
making personal contacts. Without this
quality, work in this phase of industry
can be a series of trying ordeals. With
it each prospect becomes an intriguing
challenge to your personal abilities and
the technical background that you can
bring to bear on the immediate problem.
Production is the business side of in-
dustry, and surprisingly enough, its
functions are often little understood by
the incipient engineer. A man in this
type of work is faced with many in-
tegrated problems of personnel, organ-
ization, costs, quality, safety, fire pro-
tection and engineering. It is an active
vital job where work is often per-
formed under pressure of considerable
responsibility. This requires personal
qualities of leadership, initiative, persist-
ence and a great deal of human under-
standing.
These phases of industry are the home
ports from which the young engineer
sets sail on his business career. What
happens to him with the passing years?
Ultimately, the typical engineer becomes
an executive. An analysis of jobs held
by graduates of one of the largest en-
gineering schools shows that one year
from graduation 80 per cent are en-
gaged in purely technical work and only
5 per cent in executive work. Eleven
years from graduation 35 per cent were
found to be engaged in technical work,
whereas the proportion of executives
had increased to 44 per cent. Twenty-
one years after graduation the picture
had shifted even more pronouncedly in
the same direction. Only 27 per cent
still remain in strictly technical work
while the proportion of executives had
increased to 63 per cent. These figures
have, interestingly enough, been practi-
cally duplicated at other institutions.
In reading this article you may have
been impressed with the emphasis on
personal qualities. Industry assumes
on the basis of experience that the men
in the upper sections of engineering
classes at leading universities, such as
Michigan, are well prepared to handle
the technical aspects of their early po-
sitions. Naturally the more involved
technical problems will be assigned to
men who have shown outstanding abil-
ity along such lines. If in closing we
should hazard any advice on finding
your place in industry it would be to
determine the general type of work in
which you are interested and then once
located to bend every effort toward
making a success of the immediate job.

COORDINATING INDUSTRY AND
EDUCATION
In a recent series of articles on the
closer correlation of industrial and edu-
cational effort the following suggestions
by C. F. Prutton, Professor, Chemical
Engineering, Case School of Applied
Science, were made:
1. Industry should plan definitely
for the development of the graduates it
employs. Employment should be made
with some general objective in mind
and not just to get some immediate
routine work done.
2. Salaries must be kept in line with
those received in other engineering lines,
and with the other chemical industries.
3. Industry should subsidize grad-
uate work, for desirable candidates, to
a much greater degree than is done at
present.
4. It should provide summer em-
ployment for undergraduates to train
them, aid them financially and also so
that the company can look over the
men before offering them permanent
employment.
5. It should subsidize faculty mem-
bers by retaining them as consultants.
This would enable teachers to receive a
reasonable income; thus keeping better
men as instructors. The experience of
such contacts would greatly improve the
faculty members.
6. It should aid the work of E. C. P.
I), in training of men after graduation.
ENGINEERING INCOMES
Interesting comparisons of engineer-
ing earnings based on answers from
about 52,000 engineers were outlined in
Mechanical Engineering. December,
1937. Seventy-nine engineers, among
the lowest, reported incomes of less than
$60 a month while 168 reported the
highest incomes of over $1880 a month.
Others ranged between these incomes.
Which is the highest paid engineering
profession? The upper 20 per cent of
salaries from each engineering profes-
sion were compared and mining and
metallurgical engineers showed the high-
est average of $792 a month. Next were
chemical and ceramic followed by me-
chanical, industrial, electrical, and civil
engineers. Civils ranked lowest with
an average of $515 a month. Differ-
ences of income were less in the lower
earning levels but the relative standings
of the various engineering professions
remained about the same.
A WESTERN HEMISPHERE
INDUSTRIAL UNIT
A group of brilliant American engi-
neers and executives heard Boake Carter
speak at the annual S.A.E. dinner in
Xew York, Oct. 28. Among other sig-
nificant remarks on the development of
trade within the western hemisphere, the
radio commentator said, "Linked to-
gether from Hudson Bay to Cape Horn,
the United States and the countries of
this hemisphere could become the most
prosperous group of nations in material
existence. . . . The potential buying
power of the Latin-American countries
is 24 per cent in excess of the present
output of every one of our industries
going full blast."
It is hoped that the S.A.E. members
will keep his remarks in mind when
planning for future production and
sales. A tremendous market does exist
in South America and it would be un-
wise to concentrate largely on capricious
European trade when the possibility of
tightly-knit markets in the Western
hemisphere lies within easy reach.
CERAMIC ENGINEERS TO ORGANIZE
An Institute of Ceramic Engineers is
now in process of formation and in Feb-
ruary will receive applications for mem-
bership from ceramic engineers. The
first meeting is to be held during the
Annual Meeting of the American Cer-
amic Society in New Orleans, March
27 to April 2, 1938. In case you didn't
know, ceramics has to do with the art
of making earthenware, and is becoming
a large field of engineering endeavor.
DRY ICE FROM FLUE GAS
Although a great deal of speculation
has been made in the past regarding the
possibilities of recovering valuable by-
products from the flue gases of large
manufacturing concerns, very little
work was carried on in this respect. Of
late there has been a process devised
which utilizes these gases to obtain car-
bon dioxide, used in the solid form
largely as a commercial refrigerant. The
major portion of the expense involved
ordinarily is in power and delivery costs.
Thus it was concluded that the ideal
situation would be to establish a dry-ice
concern adjacent to a steam power plant
operating near a large city; and this
was done as a test. In this manner the
Macmar process is said to yield 15 tons
daily when the plant is operating at
capacity.
THE MALIGNED ALLOY
Although the world has moved out of
the Steel Age and well into the Age of
Alloys, current editions of the standard
dictionaries still adhere to the tradi-
tional definition of alloy as a word of
derogation.

...here ■ is the
Western Electric
answer!
Several years ago the question was raised: "Has the limit been
reached in the speed of drawing copper wire?"
Western Electric engineers, assigned to find the answer, developed
new methods and machines that did it throe times faster. With
further study, they surpassed even this record—twelve times the
original speed! And the product is lower in cost, higher in quality'
Aiming always for this goal—better and more economical equip-
ment for the Bell System—Western Electric engineers continue to

COLLEGE TO GET PRECISION
LABORATORY
The College of Engineering will get
a new precision laboratory as a result
of a gift of $2,865 to the Department
of Chemical Engineering from Mr. H.
Sohma, a prominent industrial leader of
Japan and graduate of the College of
Engineering. This laboratory, to be
known as the Sohma Precision Labora-
tory, will be located in room 3040 of
the East Engineering Building. It will
be used for the calibration of instru-
ments and for the making of precision
measurements of volume, pressures,
temperatures, weight viscosity, and va-
rious electrical measurements.
The equipment will include constant
temperature baths, standard thermome-
ters, and standard thermocouples in ad-
dition to many other pieces of appara-
tus. One of the outstanding pieces of
equipment which the University will add
is a dead load tester for measuring
pressures up to 25,000 pounds per
square inch. It will be one of a few
such devices in all of the United States.
According to Professor Katz who is
in charge of arrangements, the labora-
tory will not be completed before spring
due to the time necessary to have all of
the equipment standardized by the Bu-
reau of Standards in Washington.
LOOK AGAIN!
How often have you wondered just
why that little metal hive that projects
from the south side of the East Physics
Building exists? This contrivance, al-
though not in use at the present time,
has figured as an important part of a
study of light and atmosphere carried
on here a few years ago. The research
was the work of Professor Barker of
the University of Michigan, and Dr.
Adel, formerly of Michigan, now of
Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona.
The small metal platform served as a
housing for a motor driven heliostat,
which caught the sun's rays in a mirror
and by successive reflection carried the
beam to the second basement of the
East Physics Building. The heliostat,
perhaps the first to be motor driven,
automatically kept the sun's beams
steadily aligned with a chain of mirrors.
The first of these mirrors was incorpo-
rated in the heliostat unit on the second
floor. From there the beam was shot
down through a tube in the "moat" that
surrounds East Physics. This tube ex-
tends down to the second basement and
the second unit was placed at its base.
The beam traveled thence to the labora-
tory where it was utilized. As a result
of the studies connected with this appa-
ratus, Professor Barker and Dr. Adel
acquired new and important slants on
the infra red end of the solar spectrum,
and the nature of the much-guessed-
about stratosphere. So if you haven't
already noticed—look again!
PROFESSOR j. E. EMSWILER NEW
HEAD OF M. E. DEPARTMENT
Professor J. E. Emswiler has been
appointed to fill the position formerly
held by Dean Anderson as head of the
Department of Mechanical Engineering.
Professor Emswiler has been connected
with the Engineering College for over
thirty years. He became Instructor of
Mechanical Engineering in 1906, three
years after graduation from Ohio State
University as B.S. in M.E. In 1918 he
was made Professor of Mechanical En-
gineering and on October 29 of this year
was appointed Chairman of the Depart-
ment. Professor Emswiler's best known
publication is his text book on thermo-
dynamics which is now in the fourth
edition. Among the organizations of
which he is a member we find A.S.M.E..
Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, and The So-
ciety for the Promotion of Engineering
Education.
INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS A NEW
COURSE IN E.E.
The Department of Electrical Engi-
neering will offer, through the Extension
Service of the University, a new-
course in Industrial Electronics next se-
mester. The new course, which will deal
with the industrial applications of such
devices as the x-ray, photo-electric cell,
and other vacuum tubes, will be taught
by Professor Dow of the Electrical En-
gineering Department. Professor Dow
was Director of the Electronics Insti-
tute which was held here at the Univer-
sity of Michigan during the summer
session. He is considered an outstand-
ing authority upon electronics. One of
the books to be used in connection with
the course will be Professor Dow's new-
book "Fundamentals of Engineering
Klectronics" published this summer by
Wiley and Sons of New York.
NAVY YARD GIFT
The United States Navy Yard at
Washington, D.C., has recently given
six valuable machine tools to the De-
partment of Metal Processing. They
were given to the University primarily
for research and educational purposes.
The six machines, valued at approxi-
mately $5,000 and weighing close to
45.000 pounds, include a lathe, a verti-
cal miller, a slotter, a drill press and a
screw machine.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


TIMES WITHOUT NUMBER during
the icy winter, countless thousands
of motorists give thanks (if not audibly
ac least silently) for the protection
against skidding provided by the
prompt spreading of sand or other
abrasives.
Regardless of time or temperature,
our highway departments speed men
and equipment to make our roads safer
— to protect lives and property. Mich-
igan, for example, stands out as one of
many states that is worthy of high
praise in this regard.
It may be interesting to learn that
chemistry contributes to the sanding
of icy roadways.
The task of treating miles of streets
and highways with abrasive materials
calls for speed and effectiveness. Pro-
tection must be immediate if lives and
property are to be safeguarded.
To meet the emergency of ice-bound
roads, our state, county and municipal
highway departments establish stra-
tegically located stock piles of sand
or other abrasive material during the
fall months.
These stock piles, however, would be
virtually useless if frozen into an un-
loadable and unspreadable state. Here
chemistry, through calcium chloride,
makes its first contribution. This
chemical possesses anti-freeze proper-
ties. Mixed with the sand or other
abrasive it keeps it free and unfrozen,
ready for fast loading and easy spread-
ing.
But, calcium chloride's usefulness in
treating icy roads does not end there.
It does still another important job.
Spreading sand upon glassy-hard ice
would be practically useless — the first
natural or car-made wind would sweep
it away.
liu t.calciu m chloride melts ice—even
at subzero temperatures. Thus, it
causes the gritty particles to firmly
embed themselves into the ice —
providing a lasting, skidless surface.
As a large producer of calcium chlo-
ride, marketed under the trade mark
"Dowflake"*, this organization is
gratified that its product, through
the praiseworthy efforts of hun-
dreds of highway departments is
protecting the lives and happiness
of people.

PAINLESS SQUARE ROOT
The average person finds the deter-
mination of square root of large num-
bers a task; either by the conventional
method or by the use of seven-place
logarithms if interpolation is necessary.
The slide rule will give only three terms
but can be made to yield three or four
additional terms following a simple cal-
culation. In the example given below,
set up the number as shown, omitting
the decimal point. We know from in-
spection where it belongs in the root.
(1) By slide rule, find the square
root to the first three terms. Square it
and subtract from the number and di-
vide the difference by two. Place a deci-
mal point where shown.
(2) By slide rule, divide the quo-
tient just obtained by the partial root,
the result being the next succeeding
terms.
Example I. Find \/805.1286
(1) By slide rule, 1st three terms=28.3

849
2264
566
8051286
80089 —80089
2)423.86
211.93
(2) By slide rule, next three terms are:
211.93/283=.749
Then V805.1286=^28.3749
(The correct result is 28.37478+)
In the arithmetical solution of square
root, we use a divisor composed of twice
the root already found plus the next
term. In the examples given above we
have, in effect, done the same thing by
taking one-half of the remainder, but
we have ignored any consideration of
the next term. Such consideration may
be given by subtracting the square of
the next term from the difference before
dividing by two, but ordinarily this re-
finement will not be needed. If the
fourth term is over five as in Example
I, then the last place found will be from
one to three units too great; but if
under five it is of no consequence.
If, in exceptional problems, even
more places are desired in the root, they
may be obtained by squaring the first
five or more places already found, ob-
taining a new half difference, and divid-
ing by slide rule as before.—James L.
Doyle in the Engineering News-Record.

because a Kafir
couldn't stand the gaff...
• Man's quest for gold has led him into
strange places .. . the frozen lands of the
north, the deserts of the south, the bow-
els of the earth. But from the land of
Cecil Rhodes comes an amazing tale of
muck and sweat and terrific heat... and
man's victory over the elements!
-The Robinson Deep Mine, Johannes-
burg, South Africa, is the world's deep-
est hole — 8,500 feet downl In those
depths is gold, but with temperatures
exceeding 100° Fahrenheit and humid-
ities approaching 100%, production
reached what seemed to be an impass-
able barrier Even the natives couldn't
stand the intolerable heat!
What could be done to improve
conditions, to increase the effi-
ciency of miners, to permit deeper
excavations for gold? The answer
was Carrier Air Conditioning!
Into those black depths went
Carrier engineers and for 365 days
tackled the problems of rock tem-
perature and adiabatic compression of
air, both of which go higher as shafts go
lower. They studied the excessive humid-
ity; heat from oxidation; heat from hu-
man bodies; frictional heat from machin-
ery; and heat from explosives. And from
their analysis came the installation of
a Carrier Air Conditioning system with
a cooling effect equal to 4,000,000
pounds of ice every 24 hours.
Thus again had engineering triumphed
in a victory affecting not only production,
efficiency and comfort, but one which
left its impress on world economics.
There is no limit to the scope of Car-
rier Air Conditioning—nor to Carrier's
further expansion and future accomplish-
ments—except as measured by the num-
ber and ability of the young engineers
Carrier can bring under the training of
the pioneers who have been through the
35 years of the development of the art.
In the Carrier organization, young men
hold responsible positions—their capa-
city gauged not by age, but by ability.
And whether that ability is fostered best
by laboratory research or field work in
the far corners of the world. Carrier en-
ables engineers to progress. Today in
99 different countries, you will find ev-
idence of Carrier engineers' contribution
to the world's progress!

During 1937, Carrier trained 300
recent graduates from leading en-
gineering schools in every section
of the country. Carrier needs more

Tune: "Battle Hymn of the Republic"
Free energy and entropy were whirling in his brain,
With partial differentials and Creek letters in their
train;
For delta, sigma, gamma, theta, epsilon and pi
Were driving him distracted as they danced before
his eye.
Chorus: Glory, glory, dear old thermo.
Glory, glory, dear old thermo,
Glory, glory, dear old thermo.
I'll get you by and by.
Enthalpy and fugacity revolved within his mind.
Like molecules and atoms that you never have to
wind,
With logarithmic functions doing cake-walks in
his dreams
And partial molal quantities devouring chocolate
creams.
They asked him on the final if a mole of any gas
In a vessel with a membrane through which hydro-
gen could pass
Were compressed to half its volume, what the
entropy would be,
If two-thirds delta sigma equalled half of delta P.
He said he guessed the entropy would have to equal
four,
Unless the second law would bring it up a couple
more.
But then it might be seven, if the thermostat was
good,
Or it might be almost qero if once rightly under-
stood.
The professor read his paper with a corrugated
brow,
For he knew he'd have to grade it, but he didn't
quite know how,
Till a sudden inspiration on his cerebellum smote.
And he seized his trusty fountain pen and this is
what he wrote:
"Just as you guessed the entropy, I'll have to guess
your grade.
But the second law won't raise it to the mark you
might have made;
For it might have been a hundred if your guesses
had been good.
But I think it must be zero till they're rightly
understood."

SUB-ZERO DEPENDABILITY

The toughness of steel at low tempera-
tures is a vital iactor in the performance
of many different types of machines.
Just for example, hundreds of motor
vehicles must operate every winter at
temperatures that make good sub-zero impact
strength in highly stressed parts a necessity.
Molybdenum steels, when properly heat-treated,
have excellent impact properties at low temperatures.
Investigation shows that they retain their toughness
remarkably, even at temperatures as low as —90° F.
Consequently, Molybdenum steels offer great possi-
bilities for the manufacturer of equipment that must
work either continuously or intermittently at low tem-
peratures. Advantage can be taken of their estab-
lished price and fabricating economy, with perfect
assurance of their performance.
We will be glad to send detailed information on
the low-temperature impact properties of several
widely used Molybdenum steels to any one interested.

percentages at temperatures below 35°
F. for the reason that at these lower
temperatures increased oil viscosity and
decreased battery efficiency become fac-
tors of greater importance than at the
higher atmospheric temperatures.
Similarly the vertical line at 50 per
cent indicates the lowest atmospheric
temperature at which a cold motor may
be satisfactorily operated immediately
after starting. For example, the sum-
mer gasoline of 1923 will give fairly sat-
isfactory performance under driving
conditions of a cold motor at tempera-
tures in the neighborhood of 20° F. The
winter gasoline, 1936-1937, will give
equally satisfactory performance under
the same driving conditions but at an
atmospheric temperature of 0° F.
It might appear that the necessity
for seasonal changes in the volatility of
motor fuel could be eliminated if the
most volatile fuel such as the winter gas-
oline, 1936-1937, were sold throughout
the year. This would be true provided
the motor cars were designed to handle
such a fuel advantageously in the warm
weather. The temperature of the motor
varies somewhat with the atmospheric
temperature, and during the summer
months the carburetor and other parts
of the fuel system designed for carry-
ing liquid fuel frequently attain such
high temperatures that the more volatile
fuels will generate vapor in those parts
of the fuel system designed for carrying
liquid with resulting unsatisfactory op-
eration and loss of the vapors so formed.
When it is appreciated that these tem-
peratures frequently reach 140° F., it
is clear that rigid specifications must be
maintained if the fuel is to vaporize
sufficiently to cause satisfactory starting
at temperatures as low as 30: or 40° F.
and yet not vaporize in the fuel system
when heated to temperatures of 140° F.
After these relationships were re-
ported to the Natural Gasoline Associ-
ation, one of the large companies main-
taining an active membership in that
Association undertook to follow the
suggestions and modified the volatility
characteristics of its motor fuel so as
to give as nearly as possible uniform
performance throughout the year. In
this case greater variations were made
between summer and winter gasoline
than is indicated by the averages of the
United States Bureau of Mines as re-
ported in the figure; the 50 per cent
point of the winter gasoline was made
50' F. below that of the summer gaso-
line. This practice met with such in-
stantaneous satisfactory consumer re-
sponse, that other companies rapidly
adopted the practice of making seasonal
changes in the volatility of the motor
fuel.
The advertising of branded gasolines
no longer brings out the uniformity of
the product but rather the changing
character of the product to suit the
changes in atmospheric temperature and
we now see at the service stations plac-
ards calling attention to the new easy-
starting winter gasoline in the late fall
and the new spring or summer gasoline
in the late spring. The recognition of
the changing quality of motor fuel de-
sired for the best performance under
different atmospheric conditions has
been a most important factor contribut-
ing to the increased use of motor cars
in cold weather.

THERE are several different x-ray machines in the various laboratories of
the University which are devoted to research in other fields than dentistry
or medicine. Since they offer a very practical means of determining the
soundness of bodies without the necessity of cutting them open. Such
machines afford a very useful tool for research work. The 280,000 volt
machine in the Engineering College which is powerful enough to penetrate
up to six inches of steel, has been extensively used in such a manner. It is
one of the many pieces of equipment possessed by the University which
makes the research service offered through the Department of Engineering
Research something you should investigate in connection with the technical
problems which face your company and industry.

FRED SMITH
Like a Horatio Alger story reads the
recent history of Frederick W. Smith,
Jr. While a student at Highland Park
High School in Detroit, Michigan, Fred
had read about the F.E.R.A. and fra-
ternity jobs available to students who
had the ambition to work their way
through school. He had originally
planned to work for his father but de-
cided instead to first make an attempt
at furthering his education in spite of
the fact that he would be forced to earn
nearly all of his expenses.
Fred's start at the University was
not very encouraging—at one stage of
the game he had his possessions packed
and was on his way home when an
obliging friend offered him a job at a
local fraternity to bolster the financial
situation. As a freshman Fred got into
the habit of holding down several jobs
as well as maintaining a straight "A"
average. We find him (1) bartender at
the P-Bell, (2) laboratory assistant on
an F.E.R.A. project, (3) on the fresh-
man track squad, (4) maintaining a 4.0
average, all at the same time. Fred was
later helped along by several University
Scholarships, the Gemmel Scholarship
during his freshman year and the Man-
delbaum Scholarship in his sophomore
year. Fred was also rewarded for his
outstanding scholarship by winning the
A. T. Ch. E. Award, a silver medallion,
in his sophomore year and the Phi
Lambda Upsilon Award, a chemical en-
gineer's handbook, during his junior
year.
We hope we haven't given you the
impression that Smitty is a book-worm,
grind or such. It seems that he has
that too rare combination: personal at-
tractiveness and intellectual ability. As
a junior he was initiated into the local
chapter for the profession's best—Tau
Beta Pi—and was shortly thereafter
elected President, an honor for which
most engineers would consent to the loss
of a limb or two. As President of this
organization, Fred has done a "bang
up" job and has enjoyed it immensely.
The highlight of his presidential duties
was undoubtedly the recent convention
in Texas which Fred attended with Pro-
fessor A. D. Moore. Various stories
have it that he is engaged to, danced
with, or glanced at a beautiful Texas
Co-Ed. We won't vouch for any of
them. Besides Tau Beta Pi, Fred is
also a member of Vulcans, Phi Kappa
Phi, and was formerly A. I. Ch. E. rep-
resentative to the Engineering Council.
Among his hobbies Fred lists camp-
ing, handball and swimming. He has
spent several summers as counselor in
a boys camp in Northern Michigan and
is very fond of the outdoor life.
After graduation Fred plans to work
in some chemical industry and we ex-
pect to see him at the top, in practically
no time at all.
DESERT COMMODORE
Yes, from Okmulgee, Oklahoma,
comes the man who holds the key posi-
tion of Commodore of the Quarterdeck
Society in the Department of Naval Ar-
chitecture and Marine Engineering. Lit-
tle did anyone know what was in store
for Ann Arbor when that Kappa Sigma
from the University of Oklahoma
matriculated here in February, 1936. It
was known that he had been fairly
active in the two years he spent at
Oklahoma while majoring in Mechani-
cal Engineering. He had lent his deep
bass voice to their glee club and had
also been a member of the student
branch of the A.S.M.E.
And thus from that land of cowboys,
cattle, and hyperbolic underpinning
there appeared a man in riding boots to
study Naval Architecture. This man
wears riding boots everywhere. Now you
know him — Charles David Roach,
Michigan's "Tol'able Dave."
Using his records from the U. of O.,
the Quarterdeck Society saw their way
clear to invite him into their ranks his
first semester on the campus. He has
kept up his singing by joining the Glee
Club and always can be found taking
play production courses for electives.
To top off his senior year he was invited
into Vulcans. As Commodore he was
automatically made a member of the
Engineering Council and subsequently
did a very fine job on the decorations
committee of the Engineering Ball.
For three summers Dave has been
"on the road." He served his native
state as Assistant County Engineer in
charge of Bridges and Culverts. All of
which has made him the butt of many
jokes in the saltwater wing of the En-
gine School. But he claims that these
jobs were not of his own choosing and
points with pride 1o a summer spent
crewing on the yacht Aquilon out of
Chicago. We are still wondering, how-
ever, if he wore his boots while guiding
the destiny of the Aquilon in and about
the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence
River.
So we give you Dave Roach—sailor,
highwayman, cowboy—an able seaman
on any course.

OKONITE insulation with an unsurpassed record
since 1878 is still generally recognized as the
acme of perfection for rubber insulations and as
"the best product possible" of its type.
The Okonite Company and its affiliates, how-
ever, have constantly kept step with the ad-
vances of the electric art.
Whether the wire or cable is large or small,
single or multiple conductor, high or low volt-
age, whether finished with a rubber or a syn-
thetic compound jacket, braid, lead sheath or
armor of any type, Okonite can make it.
In all cases, whether the correct solution calls
for rubber, impregnated paper, varnished cam-
bric, asbestos, glass or the newer synthetic
compounds, the policy still is and will continue
to be the best product possible.

PRECISION INSTRUMENTS
"Ttuited (2o-Woxketi. ok Science
DURING the past half-century, many of the
important developments of Science have
heen furthered with the assistance of Cambridge
instruments. Today, the name "Cambridge" is
a familiar one in research laboratory, industry
and medicine.
The quality of workmanship and of materi-
als employed in their construction and the dis-
tinctive finish of metal and woodwork mark
Cambridge instruments unmistakably. From a
utilitarian standpoint it is these innumerable
refinements in the smallest details that make
Cambridge instruments accurate, dependable
and long-lived.
In the Cambridge workshop, precision is more
than merely a word—it is a code of practice
governing every detail, from purchase of ma-
terials to shipment of a fine instrument.

NETWORK ANALYZER
T¥TITH the aim of aiding public utilities in laying
"out power systems, R. N. Slinger, Oregon State
'26, R. G. Lorraine, U. of Colorado '27, and H. P.
Kuehni, Eidgen Technische Hochschule '20, Zurich.
Switzerland, L'nion '29, spent more than a year in
designing and constructing an alternating-current
network analyzer. The apparatus is so arranged that
any distribution circuit in the country may be
simulated merely by plugging various impedance
units and power sources from the plugging cabinets

and reading the results on the master instrument
panel.
The a-c analyzer, a miniature power system, pro-
vides General Electric engineers with an advanced
tool for system analysis and is made available to
utility operating companies for their individual
problems. Speed and accuracy of calculations are
the two main advantages of the analyzer, and any
experienced operator can, in two or three days, solve
network problems which would take months to
work out using other methods.


LOOKING THROUGH A BRICK WALL
T OOKING through a brick wall would not be a
■"■^ practical use for the G-E industrial x-ray ma-
chine, but it would be less difficult than the tasks to
which it is put every day. Developed for use in
factories where expensive castings and machined
parts must be inspected, the x-ray permits inspec-
tion for flaws in castings and welds without damage
to the article under observation.
The industrial x-ray machine is, in reality, an en-
largement of the familiar machine used by doctors
and dentists. Mounted on a dolly, or suspended
from a hand crane, the machine is easily trans-
ported from one job to another and can be quickly
set up for the inspection, saving time and money
and assuring the customer of a perfect casting or
welded seam.
Developments such as this are being made by
college graduates who were at one time "on Test."
Many of them have been off the college campus but
a few years and are entering a career in one of the
many engineering and business fields in the General
Electric Company.

RUBBER RAILROAD RAILS
"IVTO, the railroad companies have not started to use
-L ' rubber rails, but the new welded steel rails that
are a mile in length have many of the characteristics
which rubber rails probably would have. Developed
after research and experimental work by the Dela-
ware and Hudson Railroad, Sperry Products Com-
pany, and General Electric Company, the welding
which makes possible these mile-long rails introduces
flash butt welding of the preheated ends of regular-
length rails to form one long continuous rail.
When these rails are loaded on flatears, they bend
easily around the sharpest curves as they are carried
to the spot where they are to be laid. In addition
to their flexibility, the rails are remarkably quiet.
No longer will there be the continual bump and
clatter of wheels over worn and gaping rail joints
to disturb sleeping passengers. To reduce the noise
even more, the rails are laid so that there will be no
two parallel joints.
The flexibility and smoothness of the new rails
reduce the wear and tear on the rolling stock, so
that the initial expenditure for the rails will be
compensated by the saving on maintenance.

UNQUESTIONABLY, the most
universally present item in the
family medicine cabinet is the
familiar bottle of Iodine.
Discovered in 1811 by Bernard
Courtois, iodine was identified
four years later by his com-
patriot, L. J. Gay-Lussac. as a
basic element—the 48th ele-
ment in point of discovery but
now classified as the 53rd in
atomic number. Incidentally, iodine
ranks 28th in abundance. As a safe-
guard against infection, tincture of
iodine has sterilized the cuts and abra-
sions of many generations.
Medical science has also taken full
advantage of the unique properties of
iodine in the form of salts such as iodide
of potassium, sodium, ammonium, cal-
cium and strontium. The use of these

salts in the treatment of lead
poisoning, asthma, syphilis,
nephritis, bronchitis, arterio-
sclerosis and angina pectoris
has demonstrated them to be
of untold value. The benefits
of iodized salt in preventing
goitre development are famil-
iar to everyone.
Iodide of potassium is used
in photography and iodine
finds further use in the manufacture of
iodates, dyes, intermediates, and as a
chemical reagent.
Some conception of the vast importance
of iodine can be gained when one learns
that American consumption approaches
a million pounds annually.
Until 1928, we depended upon foreign
sources for our iodine supply. Then,
The Dow Chemical Company began the
first production of domestic iodine on a
commercial scale.
Intensive study of various processes for
the recovery of iodine finally resulted in
a totally new method, conceived and
perfected by Dow technicians.
Today, Dow is producing a substantial
share of all the elemental iodine used in
this country—at a price equaling the
lowest foreign competition. Thus, Dow
has made available to leading pharma-
ceutical houses and industry a domestic
source of elemental iodine, constituting
an important step in our national progress.

THIS MONTH AND THE NEXT
This issue of THE TECHNIC carries on the employment series with
"What I want in the Young Engineer," by J. Ralph Davis, Vice Presi-
dent, Vanadium Corporation of America. Particularly pertinent, in view
of the Administration's large watershed control projects, is Roy Size-
more's article stressing intcr-professicnal cooperation: "Forestry and/or
Engineering." Two phases of the fuel situation are ably handled this month
in L. C. Stewart's "Bromine from Sea Water" and Max C. Schoetz'
"The Fuel Problem."
Next month will see the publication of this year's job feature: "100
Michigan Engineers." It will be the most complete employment analysis
ever presented in THE TECHNIC. Keep this analysis; it will be a good
yardstick with which to measure your success in engineering.

'■ 'HE qualities of tact and leadership
■*■ are of great importance. In our par-
ticular line of business the young engi-
neer has to work with and control un-
skilled and semi-skilled labor. I would
rate as of first importance that he be
able to get along with others. An engi-
neer must get a gang of men to carry
out an idea with enthusiasm and effi-
ciency.
The ability to get along with others
adds to the young engineer's success and
harmony in his contacts with other
minor executives in the organization.
The young graduate engineer must be
prepared for and try to overcome a
spirit of antagonism and watchfulness
on the part of some of his associates,
particularly if these fellows happen to
be without college degrees and trained
the more quickly he can lay aside his
cap and gown."

only in the "school of hard knocks." A
sense of humor will help him over many
hard spots, and the more quickly he can
"lay aside his cap and gown" the more
quickly will the young engineer find
himself at home and happy in industry
today.
He must be able to "take orders."
These orders will not always fit in with
the higher theory which he has so care-
fully learned. I would by no means
advocate a "rubber stamp" attitude on
his part. I would have him when he does
not agree, state his reasons as tactfully
as possible, and suggest a better way of
doing the same thing and then be pre-
pared to go out and make it work the
boss" way in spite of the theory, if that
course is indicated to him. He must be
trained, I believe, to bring forth a mul-
titude of new ideas and have nine out of
ten of them rejected without any feeling
on his part of personal affront or dis-
couragement.
Negative thinking on the part of young
engineers is one of the greatest handi-
caps we have to contend with. The lad
whose first reaction to a new proposal is
to cast about for reasons why it will not
work instead of searching his mind for
methods of making it work is much like
the man who can walk with ease from
end to end of a narrow plank placed on
the sidewalk but finds it impossible to
pass over the same plank when it is
placed between two high buildings. His
negative thinking has him "licked" be-
fore he starts.
The habit of negative thinking should
be of serious concern to the college man
preparing for the career of engineering.
In my judgment, negative thinking, if it
is persisted in, will be a great obstacle
in the path of progress toward success.

Bromine Extraction Plant at Wilmington, North Carolina.
Dow Chemical Co.
IN 1826 bromine was discovered by
Balard, who prepared it from salts in
Mediterranean Sea water. A little more
than a hundred years later, in 1934 to
be exact, the Ethyl-Dow Chemical Com-
pany started operation of the first com-
mercial plant for extracting bromine
from sea water. However, in the period
between those dates, the manufacture of
bromine did not enjoy a uniform growth.
Thus it was 1846 before any commercial
production of bromine occurred, and
1914 before a half million pounds of
bromine was manufactured annually in
this country.
Beginning in the early 1920's the de-
mand for bromine increased very rapid-
ly, due to the use of one of its com-
pounds in the production of Ethyl fluid
for the treatment of gasoline motor fuels.
As a consequence, in 1926 there was
produced in this country 1,245,760
pounds of free and chemically combined
bromine, and in 1936 20,609,025
pounds. Because of this rapid increase
in demand, it became necessary to de-
velop sources of bromine other than the
old ones, chief of which was the natural
brine found in the vicinity of Midland,
Michigan. It was logical that sea water
should be considered as such a source,
for, although it contains only a very
small amount of bromine compounds,
nevertheless there is an almost inex-
haustible supply available.
With this in mind, the Dow Chemical
Company, which operates a chemical
process for extracting bromine from
brine at Midland, Michigan, decided
also to develop a process which would
operate on raw sea water. The problem
was one of considerable magnitude as
evidenced by the fact that one million
pounds of sea water contains only sixty-
seven pounds of bromine, and second,
that the raw material contained only
about the same amount of bromine as
that which was left remaining in the
Michigan salt brine after extraction of
bromine from that material by the
standard method.
In developing a process for operating
on sea water, the original investiga-
tions were made on synthetic sea water,
and then later the methods developed
in the laboratory were applied in a small
plant using actual sea water which was
shipped to Midland in tank cars. It was
July, 1933, when the Ethyl-Dow Chem-
ical Company decided to build and
operate a plant which would extract
15,000 pounds of bromine per day from
sea water and manufacture this into
ethylene dibromide, which is used along
with other constituents in treatment of
gasoline to give it anti-knock properties.
This plant, about twenty miles south
of Wilmington, North Carolina, takes
raw sea water from the Atlantic Ocean
on the east side of the narrow peninsula
on which it is located, extracts the
bromine from the water, and discharges
it into the Cape Fear River on the
western side of the peninsula. The river
then carries it back to the ocean about
twenty miles south of the intake.
The sea water intake at the plant
consists of two massive piers extending
into the ocean about thirty feet beyond
the water's edge at lowest tide. Each
pier is formed by a double row of sheet
steel piling. At approximately twenty
foot intervals cross-walls tie the par-
allel rows of piling together, forming a
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


then filled with sand to give stability
against battering by the waves. The
water flows between the piers into a
basin, from which it is pumped over a
dam which is at a height of twenty-three
feet above mean low tide level. From
there the water flows by gravity across
the mile-wide peninsula on which the
plant is located, to the extraction units
near the shore of the river. Thirty-inch
centrifugal pumps, having individual
capacity of about 30,000 gallons per
minute, are used to elevate the sea water
from the settling basin to the top of the
dam.
The actual removal of bromine from
the sea water occurs in two identical
units, which are brick structures ap-
proximately 200 feet long by 85 feet
wide. They are about as tall as an
average five-story building. Each unit
is composed of what is known as the
"blowing-out" tower and an "absorp-
tion" tower. Approximately 15,000
gallons of sea water are pumped to the
top of each unit every minute. At the
bottom of the rubber-lined pipes which
carry the water to the top of the units,
sulfuric acid and chlorine gas are in-
jected into the sea water. The chlorine
replaces the bromine which is in chemi-
cal combination, thereby producing a
very dilute solution of free bromine. The
latter is then removed from the water
by blowing a large volume of air through
the solution. This is done by sucking
air from the bottom to the top of the
blowing-out tower at the same time that
the sea water, with its bromine in solu-
tion, is flowing from the top to the
bottom of the tower.
The mixture of bromine and air then
is caused to come in contact with a
solution of soda ash (washing soda) in
the absorption tower and is thus con-
verted to a solution which can be con-
centrated by recirculation of this liquid
until a very strong liquor is obtained,
which will yield bromine upon further
acidification. The bromine thus obtained
is caused to react chemically with ethy-
lene gas, made from ordinary grain
alcohol by passing the latter over heated
kaolin (china clay). The product is
ethylene dibromide, which is used in
preparing Ethyl fluid, which in turn is
added to gasoline.
The success of the sea water process
depends chiefly on two fundamental de-
velopments. These important factors
are: first, determination and control of
the exact conditions of acidity which
must be maintained in the sea water
in order to set free the bromine efficient-
ly; and, second, a method of continu-
ously determining and indicating the
extent of the bromine liberation. With-
out these accurate control methods it
would be impossible economically to
treat chemically the enormous quantities
of sea water which must be handled in
order to obtain the desired production
of bromine.
The plant was designed to produce
approximately one-half million pounds
of bromine per month. Its production
has never fallen below that amount, and
in summer months it has produced as
much as 50% in excess of that quantity.
The plant is the first successful com-
mercial operation involving a continu-
ous passage of raw sea water through a
chemical process with attendant removal
of valuable materials. Because of the
ever increasing demand for ethylene
dibromide, the capacity of the original
plant has been doubled by construction
of new and improved units, which have
been put in operation during the latter
part of 1937.

A considerable propor-
tion of bromine goes into
the preparation of ethy-
lene dibromide which is
used in anti-knock gaso-
lines.

SOME SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS
ALTHOUGH engineers are constantly
•**. being urged to become more social-
minded and although many engineers
are endeavoring to become so, never-
theless, the time has not yet come when
technical journals are published pri-
marily as vehicles for social tracts. In
many fields, however, it is becoming
very difficult to separate definitely the
social, economic, and technical aspects
of current problems. This is especially
true since the Federal Government has
entered many business and industrial
fields with the purpose of allaying
economic evils and benefiting society.
The recent move of the Federal Gov-
ernment to relieve unemployment and
improve housing conditions by trying to
stimulate private building industry has
called attention to the possibilities for
low-cost housing, especially prefabri-
cated housing. There are a number of
important problems which must be
solved before popular consumption of
prefabricated houses becomes a reality.
Probably the least difficult problem to
solve is the matter of technical con-
struction—hence it seems rather point-
less to consider only the technical details
of construction when attempting to
observe the status of the prefabricated
housing industry.
Prefabrication is like the weather of
Mark Twain's famous remark. As far
as the public is concerned, everybody
talks about it but nobody seems to do
anything about it. This statement may
be an exaggeration and may be some-
what unfair to the leading prefabrica-
tors; nevertheless, as far as popular
consumption of the product is concerned,
prefabrication at present does not rank
very far ahead of television.
With the exception of a slighter de-
pendence on the tightly organized build-
ing trades, prefabrication, as a type of
housing, is subject to all the social and
economic conditions which affect the
rest of the housing industry. Therefore
before answering the question, "Are we
to have prefabricated housing?" we
must first answer the simpler question,
"Are we to have housing?" And in our
supposedly enlightened society of today
we go still farther and ask, "Are we to
have housing for every one?"
It is rather self-evident that persons
earning a very small annual wage can-
not buy a home but must depend in
part on charity and relief funds for their
shelter. The monetary value of the wage
which divides the self-sufficient man
from the partly-dependent individual
will always be subject to dispute. It
depends not only upon local living costs
but also on public or official opinion as
to the minimum conveniences a man
should have, the extent of his responsi-
bility for working out his own destiny,
and the extent to which society should
support him. In considering the position
of prefabrication as a mass production
method, only the self-sufficient individ-
ual can be considered as a customer.
The housing opportunities for the de-
pendent individual must be left to relief
agencies and municipalities.
The Purdue Housing Research Pro-
ject has uncovered facts uncompliment-
ary to our "American Standard of
Living." The Project's statistics show-
that 42% of our city homes depend on
stoves for heating, 23% do not have
either a tub or shower for bathing pur-
poses, and that 17% do not have private
indoor sanitation facilities. The Project
has calculated further that a $2,500
house is too expensive for 35% of
American families; a $3,400 house is
too expensive for 53% of American
families; and a $4,200 house is too ex-
pensive for 66% of American families.
The Foundation states, "Preliminary
studies reveal that it is all but impos-
sible in the present state of the art of
construction to erect a well built and

There is a definite trend toward the pre fabrication of
modern homes.
satisfactory house of adequate space and
facilities for much less than $5,000/'
Hence, according to these figures, 70%
of our population cannot afford to buy
new "satisfactory" houses.
The American housing situation is a
decided contrast to that of Great Britain
where 3,000,000 new homes have been
constructed since the World War,
2,000,000 of which were constructed by
private enterprise and the remaining
1,000,000 by government and minicipal
subsidies. Privately constructed houses
sell for $2,500 to $5,000 complete in-
cluding land and roads, while muni-
cipally constructed houses sell for
S2,000 including land and roads. The
British do not go in for tenements,
apartments, and duplexes, but firmly
believe a worker should have his own
house with a small plot of ground for
gardening. A $3,000 house is handled
by $200 cash and $5.00 per week for
twenty years. Municipally subsidized
small homes of two or three rooms rent
for as little as $1.25 per week. Financ-
ing is largely through housing societies
which charge 4%% and pay 3^/2% to
shareholders and 21/2% to depositors,
leaving an average handling margin of
1V4%.
In the Purdue Housing Research an-
alysis it was assumed that a worker
could afford to pay one fourth of his
weekly wage toward housing. The Brit-
ish make the same assumption in plan-
ning the financing of their houses. One
quarter of one's weekly salary is a
rather large amount to put out every
week. Does the average American
worker want a "satisfactory" home
badly enough to "sacrifice" one quarter
of his weekly wage? The writer per-
sonally thinks not. At one time every-
one considered the home a necessity.
After buying some land, buying a home,
furnishings, clothing, food, et cetera, and
after putting some money in the bank,
the then so-called luxuries were pur-
chased. At present, what with the rar\vn
and high-pressure salesmanship, the
house no longer has a preferred status
but must compete for the consumer's
dollar on an equal basis with the auto-
mobile with its license, insurance, and
garage costs; the radio; electric refrig-
erators, washing machines, and sundry
gadgets; and many other items now
raised in popular opinion to the status
of "necessities."
The extent to which the motor car
has supplanted the house in the con-
sumer's fancy is shown by figures com-
piled by the Department of Agriculture
and the Works Progress Administration.
The data was obtained from studies
made of forty-six midwestern villages in
six states. It shows that from the $1,250
income up, purchase and upkeep of cars
is a larger item in the average family
than rent or clothing. In the income
group of $1,250 to $1,500 an average of
$156 per year is spent for the main-
tenance, operation, or purchase of cars
compared with $124 spent for housing
FEBRUARY, 1938


incomes from $2,000 to $2,500, car ex-
penditures average $315 compared with
$186 for clothing and $143 for housing.
Even in the lowest brackets covered in
the survey—from $250 to $500—an av-
erage of $14 was spent on cars, increas-
ing to $40 for families with incomes of
from $500 to $750 and to $73 for
families from $1,000 to $1,250. An
analysis of the above figure shows an
average of 13% of the annual wage
being spent for cars, 8% for housing
and 8.5% for clothing. The total per
cent spent for cars and housing totals
only 21%, hence it becomes evident that
unless the American worker changes his
spending habits considerably, he will
have a difficult time buying a house
(at 25% of his income) even if he goes
without a car—which he probably
won't.
Possibly some sweet day the purchas-
ing power of every American will be
sufficiently ample to buy him everything
he wants. Until that time comes he
must select for purchase some desired
items and forego those less-desired. At
the present time the house seems to be
one of the less desirable items. If a
prefabricated or any other type of house
is to be manufactured on a mass pro-
duction basis, it must be sold on a mass
consumption basis. This will not be
possible until every American is made
house conscious. This will be brought
about only by such an intensive, long-
range program of advertising that when
John K. Public comes home at night
to his inconvenient forty-year-old frame
house, he will automatically say, "I
think the Little Woman ought to have
a nicer place to live in—even if I ha%'e
to ride to work with Joe every morning."
Long-range, intensive advertising is
costly, hence it could be carried on only
by large companies which can afford to
await the returns from their advertising.
The painless, long-time method of
financing houses in the United States
must be greatly expanded before houses
may become mass production units. In
this respect the housing companies might
follow the example of the British con-
struction companies and of our own
automobile industry. This financing
burden again necessitates huge building
corporations.
There are already a number of sizable
companies in the prefabrication field
and other established companies are ex-
tending their activities in this direction.
These companies have already equipped
their plants with up-to-date laboratories
and conveyor systems and are ready to
sell to the customer although the dis-
tribution facilities are rather inadequate.
The prefabricators claim that a pre-
fabricated house is better for the same
price or cheaper for the same quality
than the usual house. Prefabrication
brings about ease of purchase, a fixed
and predetermined price, and speedy
erection. Some difference of opinion
seems to exist, however, about the time
and costs of erection. Although we read

Japanese Pre-Fabrication at $170.
Architectural Record
of houses being completely erected at
exhibitions and conventions in from
twelve to thirty-six hours time, these
houses are erected under ideal conditions
probably by specially trained crews.
This erection time only includes the time
it takes to enclose a space with several
walls and a roof and it does not indi-
cate the exact time erection would take
place on the job. The skeleton frame,
outside shell, inside walls, roof, sub-
floors, partitions, doors, windows,
frames, stairs, and ceilings, are factory-
made and may be erected fairly rapidly.
However, foundations must be dug and
built; plumbing, heating, and lighting
installed, floors of rubber, tile, or hard-
wood laid over sub-floors; weather
proofing applied to roofing; exteriors
painted; and interiors painted or pa-
pered on the job. The Nation's Business
recently announced in a prefabrication
survey that of three prefabricators ques-
tioned, one stated that a crew can
assemble a prefabricated house in one-
quarter of the time required to build
the conventional house; another said
that prefabrication erection time would
average from four to six weeks; and a
third builder estimated prefabrication
costs to run about the same as the usual
building costs. In any case, the erection
of prefabricated houses is not the super-
speedy negligible-cost affair that many-
persons believe it to be.
It is felt by some that the cost of
erection will be an appreciable item
until prefabrication companies have
numerous assembly plants well distrib-
uted throughout the nation so that
transportation costs will be low and
trained erection crews will be readily
available.
Some rather refreshing ideas concern-
ing house construction have been
brought forth by the more aggressive
prefabricators. They say that the large
proportion of aged homes existing today
is due to the fact that the houses were
constructed to last from thirty to one
hundred years. Why should houses, any
more than radios and automobiles, be
built to last 100 years when they will
become obsolete before their actual life
is finished? These men feel that it would
be more economical to build a house
to last only 15 years and costing 60% of
the full price. Then when it becomes
old, tear it down and put up an ultra-
new model. This would result in pro-
gressively up-to-date houses and would

Inventions

.Yfie* Week
'"PHE process of invention is intimately
■*■ concerned with the way the mind
works. Psychological researches are grad-
ually revealing some of the rules of
operation within which the mind func-
tions. It is known that the mind has
some fairly orderly ways of going about
things, and equally orderly ways of
refusing to accomplish other things.
This brings us to a certain psychological
Jaw of learning, the Law of Specificity.
This law simply states the fact that
we use our learning in the same ways
within which the learning occurred.
Stated again, an idea had better be
learned in the way in which it is to be
used. The negative form of the law is
this: if the vehicle by which some learn-
ing was acquired took the form of sym-
bols, physical facts, and concepts in
Technical Field A, the mind will not
readily transfer the learning to immedi-
ate and effective use in Technical Field
B, where it may fit and be needed, but
where symbols and concepts are strange.
It should be remarked that there are
many otherwise intelligent people who
seem to resent the law, and react towards
it as if it were "put over" on them
while they were abroad, and with no
chance to defend their rights. These
people simply want to stick to an old
and exploded belief, that learning should
transfer fluid-like, in any and all direc-
tions; that learning is general, and so
on. Such fond hopes have not been sup-
ported by the findings, and they may
as well be abandoned early as late.
Restate the law in very short form:
learn things in the way in which they
are to be used. Negatively: do not
expect your mind to act with spontane-
ous fertility, and find for you new and
unexpected uses for your learning. The
reader with a fertile mind has by now
anticipated the two important con-
clusions about to be reached.
If, through the Law of Specificity, the
mind wants to behave in specific and
orderly ways, this mode of mental action
is at once the source of greatest despair
and greatest hope for the inventor. The
despair comes from realizing that one
may be looking directly at a need, and
be fully equipped to meet it by invent-
ing, but the need is in a field foreign
to that in which the particular learning
was acquired. One can hardly begin to
develop and perfect the new application
of an old idea, unless he at first thinks
of the application.
The hope comes only to those who
are willing to accept the validity of the
Law of Specificity, who further are
ready to cultivate a constant awareness
of it, and who finally develop the fixed
habit of deliberately thinking of every
possible application of their ideas, facts,
principles and relationships.
Ideas and inventions long used in one
field, often penetrate to other fields with
amazing slowness. If one were to make
a search, great numbers of illustrations
could be listed. Sometimes the spread is
rapid. But in any number of cases, a
useful and indispensable idea can be
known about and used in one way by
many people; yet it may be years be-
fore one of these people will even think
of lifting that idea out of its familiar
setting and giving it a new lease on life
somewhere else. The prolific inventor
has usually never heard of the Law of
Specificity, but he could write a very
good version of it from his own
experience.
Consider bimetal. Here is a combina-
tion of two unlike metals, such that
when a strip of bimetal changes tempera-
ture, it bends. There is an idea, naked
and unclothed. It largely remained in
that state, in textbooks on physics, for
many years. Then someone began to
make thermostats out of bimental. (Or
perhaps that early use may have pre-
ceded the appearance of the idea in
physics texts; no matter here, which
way.) Then bimetal became a current-
interrupter. Then gradually, the indus-
trial world really began to get ac-
quainted with bimetal. No one dreamed
ten years ago, that today there would
be thousands of cars in which indica-

THE average person is apt to think
of a chemical laboratory as consist-
ing mainly of stenches, fumes and beak-
ers of multi-colored liquids. It is quite
true that all of these are usually present,
but they are merely the by-products
which result from carefully planned
methods of procedure in attacking those
problems which are presented to the
laboratory. These problems, of course,
depend upon the nature of the work
being carried on by whatever branch of
industry the laboratory serves. The
Chemical laboratory of the Department
of Engineering Research is no exception
in that it is continuously called upon
to provide analytical information on a
wide variety of materials. The staff
may be called upon to determine the
amount of essential oil which can be
extracted from limes, to determine the
amount of acid in orange peel, to de-
termine the amount and character of
the sugar which can be obtained from
dahlia roots, to determine the ingredi-
ents of a certain lubricant, to determine
the analysis of a wide variety of metal
alloys, to determine the composition of
an ordinary drinking water, or perhaps
one of a large number of other determi-
nations equally diversified in character.
Despite the fact that the chemist has
carried on research for many years with
a view to developing analytical methods,
it is very often necessary to devise
methods or modify old ones to meet
particular analysis requirements. One
research project in the laboratory in-
volved clutch facings. It was desired to
know the percentages of the four prin-
cipal components of a facing which had
given particularly good results. These
components were wire, asbestos, cotton
and the binder. The binder was found
to be an organic compound which could
be leached out with the aid of solvents
and the exact amount could be readily
determined by weighing. The wire as
such could not be easily separated from
the fibres of cotton and asbestos. HowT-
ever, enough of them could be removed
so that an analysis of the wire, which
was brass, could be made. The wire
was found to contain sixty per cent
copper. A sample of the original facing
was then taken and the amount of
copper was determined by using a
simple ratio, whereby the amount of
wire was ascertained. The amount of
cotton was found by burning a leached
sample and collecting the carbon diox-
ide. From this was calculated the
amount of cellulose. This left two
alternatives for the determination of the
amount of asbestos: one by difference
and the other by direct analysis method.
Since asbestos is a mineral of rather
definite composition containing mag-
nesium and silica, it was found that by
analyzing for silica in the original fac-
ing and converting this value to its
asbestos equivalent the result thus ob-
tained agreed very closely with the
amount which was indicated by differ-
ence.
Another example was the case in con-
nection with the production of a high
manganese molybdenum steel in which
it was essential to adhere closely to the
specifications in the production of the
steel. This meant that it was necessary
to know the manganese content before
the melt was poured. The then avail-
able methods for the determination of

lengthy to warrant holding the liquid
steel until the analysis could be per-
formed. Starting with the well-known
method and making modifications here
and there and by using one of the newer
acids; namely, perchloric, a method was
devised whereby an analysis could be
completed in twelve minutes, a length
of time which is permissible for holding
the metal before pouring. The time also
was short enough so that there was not
likely to be any appreciable change in
the analysis additions could be made to
the metal to correct the analysis before
pouring. Through this development re-
jections of this steel, because it did not
meet specifications, have practically been
eliminated.
Metallurgists working on the develop-
ment of chromium alloy wires such as
are used in heating elements of toasters,
flat irons, waffle irons, and other similar
electrical appliances, found that minute
amounts of certain metallic elements had
a decided influence upon the life of the
wires. With the development of methods
of spectrographic analysis for the ac-
curate measurement, particularly of
small amounts of elements in alloys, a
development of the University labora-
tories, it became necessary to develop
a method of chemical analysis which
would give a fairly accurate analysis for
such elements. This was necessary be-
cause, in order to use the spectrograph,
it is essential to have a working curve;
that is, a curve relating the relative
intensities of certain spectral lines of
the element on which the analysis is
being performed, to certain spectral lines
of the principal component, and this re-
lation had to be based on known per-
centages of the element. One such
analysis involved a base alloy of nickel,
chromium and iron in which it was
desirable to measure the amount of the
traces of such metals as calcium. To
make the chemical analysis, it was nec-
essary to obtain the calcium in a
solution which was entirely free from
any nickel, chromium or iron. Because
of this, large samples were dissolved in
suitable acids and then by the evolution
of copious quantities of fumes, the
chromium was driven off as a volatile
compound. The determination was reg-
ulated by forming an iron salt which is
soluble in ether while the other elements
which were left in solution were not
soluble. Then, by the addition of
ammonia to the solution containing some
perchloric acid, the chemist followed a
reaction by the color changes that take
place until finally an orchid-colored
crystalline precipitate settled to the
bottom of the beaker. This contained
practically all of the nickel. Then by
use of that evil-smelling gas, hydrogen
sulfide, the last traces of the heavy
metals were removed and at last the
calcium appeared as an insoluble oxa-
late from which it could be readily de-
termined. The analysis then provided
one point on the calibration curve
essential to the spectrographic analysis.
In view of the fumes and such, it was
fortunate for the chemist that once the
working curve is correctly established
it is never necessary to repeat the
chemical work.
One railroad company experienced a
serious explosion occurring in a grease
cup on the driving rod of a locomotive.
The cause proved very perplexing to the
investigators. The remains of the cup
and a sample of the grease that was
regularly used were sent to the Research
Department and naturally gravitated to
the Chemical Laboratory. A list of the
possible causes of the explosion was also
presented. Among the possible causes
was listed an item which stated that
several years ago engineers had been
known to use the salts from a railroad
fusee to cool over-heated bearings. All
of the other possibilities had been
checked and found to give negative re-
sults. There was apparently no means
of detecting whether or not material
from a fusee had been used. However,
upon close examination of the battered
and fractured grease cup, it was observed
that apparently a very small quantity of
material which might be grease ad-
hered to the parts. This material was
observed particularly in the bottom of
the threaded portions and a minute
quantity was removed by means of a
fine platinum wire. This was treated
chemically and then held in a hot flame.
There was an immediate flare of brilliant
red in the flame, a color which indi-
cates the presence of strontium salts,
which salts are extensively used in the
manufacture of pyrotechnics, indicating
without doubt that that particular loco-
motive had received the loving care and
attention of an old-time railroad
engineer.
The discovery of shining golden-like
particles pouring forth from a spout of
a well pump should quicken anyone's
pulse. That was the cause of one indi-
vidual's trip to the laboratory with a
sample of water from his well. The
bottom of the bottle was covered with
the golden flakes accompanied by a
small amount of sand. The flakes were
carefully filtered and examined under
the microscope. The results of the ex-
amination suggested to the chemist that
he apply a drop of nitric acid to the
samples on the slide. A vigorous reaction
took place and a blue solution remained,
indicating copper compound. Upon ques-
tioning, the individual divulged the fact
that it was necessary for him to fre-
quently replace the pump leathers. With
these facts in hand all the chemist
had to do was to explain to the individ-
ual that the constant pumping of a
small amount of sand had been wearing
away the brass inner surface of the
pump and these particles of brass were
being forced up with the water.
These examples show that the life of
a chemist is far from boring, particularly
if he meets the challenge which is regu-
larly presented to him in the conduct
of a chemical service laboratory in a
research department.

U. S. wells supply a world petroleum market.
"V\ 7"HAT are students to believe in
*V regard to the length of time that
the petroleum resources of the world
can continue to supply the enormous
demands made on them each year? Cer-
tain estimates by men of authority
reveal that the world's remaining oil
reserves, recoverable by present day
methods, total around twenty-five bil-
lion barrels—a 14 year supply. These
figures paint an alarming picture; but
oil men argue, in an effort to prevent
government intervention and control of
the oil industry, that they are by no
means following the wasteful methods
practiced in the boom years by lumber
profiteers. New methods of refining
whereby a greater percentage of useful
fuel is obtained from each barrel of
crude oil, and more exact systems of
locating new resources keep pace with
the millions of barrels of oil being fired
into the cylinders of engines each year.
It is only common sense, though, to
believe that this splurge is dated. You
could change that old adage to "You
can't have your oil and burn it," and it
certainly would prove most embarrassing
to pull into a gasoline station along
about 1950 and have the attendant
reply, "That's all there is; there 'ain't'
no more." It's hardly as ominous as
that, but it is high time the American
populace is informed that this good
thing cannot last forever.
Gasoline is a fuel which must be used
to run new war machines, and countries
whose main pleasure during "off" years
is to prepare for the next war, are turn-
ing to synthetic gasoline. Germany usu-
ally is the first country to develop revo-
lutionary substitutes, and although it is
an ironic tribute, her war plans at this
time would be an embryonic stage were
she not relying on the ingenuity of two
Nobel Prize-winning chemists.
Countries poor in petroleum reserves
are fortunately blessed with ample coal
deposits, and for this reason, most syn-
thetic gasolines are derived from coal.
Germany has been using three prin-
cipal processes. The Fisher-Tropsch
"synthetic" method is a small scale
affair based on the use of coal to gen-
erate gases which are then built up into
larger liquid fuel molecules. Another
system, already ninety years old, is the
low temperature carbonization of coal,
but more coke and other by-products
are produced by this method than is
gasoline. The new Bergius or "hydro-
genation" process, however, is the first
one with any large scale possibilities.
Aside from several catalysts, it consists
chiefly in simply powdering coal and
forcing its chemical union with gaseous
hydrogen under high pressure. Cheap
grades of coal can be used, thus leaving
the better coal for industrial and do-
mestic uses besides furnishing a means
of greater profit in the export of high
grade coal. The high efficiency enables
one ton of coal to produce more than
its weight of gasoline. Although coal is
plentiful, the cost of the hydrogenation
plant is tremendous, and gallon for
gallon, the cost is three times as much
as refining from crude oil.
Bergius used a staff of 150 technicians
working over a 13-year period, to bring
the process to industrial perfection, en-
tailing a cost of $6,000,000.

England, and in the United States by
a very large oil company in the East.
Germany bore the greater part of the
cost, but her policy seems to have been
the development of armaments "at any
cost." American interests have gone
after the scheme with the idea of mak-
ing another dollar, whereas foreign rivals
worry about war. Europeans are per-
fecting another step to aid them in their
"self-preservation" while the Americans
are trying to stay at the top of the
liquid fuel industry.
Leastwise, the European populace is
being trained for days when the gaso-
line supply will go almost wholly to
the army, navy, and air force. Hitler
decreed, several months ago, that any
concern using a certain number of
gallons of oil per month must turn in
their drain oil to be reclaimed. City
departments and large industries in this
country are doing just that for economic
reasons but with no thought of preserv-
ing the world's oil supply.
When Edwin Laurentine Drake drilled
the first successful oil well in Titusville,
Pa., in 1859, he could not very well
realize that fellow countrymen were to
invest nearly thirteen billion dollars in
the business he so innocently started.
Developments and uses for the dark,
boiling mass gushing from the earth
paved the way for large scale industries.
First only certain products were desired
from the freely flowing oil; then the
internal combustion engine was per-
fected in order to make use of what
were once waste products in the refining
of kerosene oil and naptha; but it soon
threatened to eat up more fuel than
could be provided.
Today the consumption of gasoline
per motor per year averages between
400 and 450 gallons. The United States'
crude oil supply is dwindling at the rate
of 1,000,000,000 barrels per year. Year
in and year out, oil wells in the U.S.
have not only supplied the domestic
market, the largest in the world, but
have exported as well. The American
output accounts for sixty percent of the
total world production and has averaged
that figure ever since oil became a
commodity.
As the demand keeps increasing and
well drilling gets deeper, and as oil men,
in an alleviating manner point to new
cracking processes for securing more
gasoline per barrel of crude oil, and to
vast quantities of oil bearing shale as
yet untouched—the ratio of supply to
demand narrows. Eventually the price
of the crude oil process and the gasoline
from the coal process will approach the
same figure. Some other fuel source
must be found because coal cannot be
relied upon to form the basis for the
total fuel supply. With an end seeming
to be drawing near, it is no time to get
panicky; but it is time to start prepar-
ing for the new economic and social
system which will result because of the
change. Many ideas have already been
formulated and some are being put into
use. Producer gas and alcohol are al-
ways being discussed; by-product gases,
propane and butane, which are easily
liquefied for tank car shipment are in
fast growing use as a low cost fuel for
stationery engines, switching locomo-
tives, tractors, trucks and buses. At any
event, it is a problem which confronts
our generation. Thousands of people are
engaged in the industry, and it will be
the duty of the engineers to discover a
substitute and to devise a scheme to
produce and distribute that substitute
in such a manner as to cause the least
possible social and economic disorder
when the change comes about.
Modern plants are utilizing increasingly larger proportions of raw petroleum.

The Michigan Forcstrr
FEUDS among the mountain peoples
of Kentucky have long been known
as the bitterest quarrels that have ever
existed. Yet in a realm entirely apart
from the unenlightened atmosphere of
the mountains of that Southern state,
a struggle fully as bitter exists between
two of our foremost professions. Engi-
neers and foresters having originally dis-
agreed on certain points have carried
this difference of opinion over into a
knock-down, drag-out fight.
During recent years a few foresters
and engineers have broken away from
these traditional lines of thought and
have begun to pay some attention to
their professions as they fit into the
general scheme of society. Out of this
heresy has come the feeling that co-
operation between these two schools of
technical thought may be the means to
end many of civilization's battles.
Among the most important problems
that must be solved within the next two
or three decades are those that relate to
flood control and soil conservation.
Controversy over these problems be-
gan in 1873 when a breach over the
effects of forests on streamflow first
occurred. This feeling which had its
origin in Europe has practically been
eliminated there, but has been brought
over to this country and continued un-
abated. The first open break in the
United States came in 1917 when
Colonel Hiram M. Chittenden of the
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

tOY SIZEMORE. '39 F.&amp;C.
?
Army Engineering Corps first publicly
presented the argument that forests do
not affect streamflow. His action, how-
ever, did not prevent passage of national
forest legislation based on congressional
authority to control rivers and streams.
Out of fairness to Colonel Chittenden,
it must be said that he did not oppose
the extension of constructive forestry.
Difference in opinion has continued
without the constitutionality of the for-
estry measure being questioned by the
opponents of the forest effect theory.
The federal government once more
recognized that such an effect does exist
when the Omnibus Flood Control Bill
was passed in 1936. This, in turn, was
brought about by an informal "entente
cordiale" between foresters and engi-
neers.
With the weight of this authority
supporting it, the theory that forests do
influence streamflow must be at least
partly valid.
Here, then is an opportunity for for-
esters to join with engineers in solving
one of the major problems now con-
fronting the nation. Indeed, the solution
is so vital to the nation that every
possible means of attack, no matter how
small, must be utilized in triumphing
over yearly floods that tear down in
hours the work of centuries.
That cooperation is not too far in
the future is demonstrated by the
Tennessee Valley Authority. In one of
its phamphlets, its objectives
are stated as follows:
"The Tennessee valley
Authority is charged with the
comprehensive development of
an entire watershed—the Ten-
nessee Basin, covering 40,000
square miles of territory in
seven states. This duty in-
volves the improvement of
navigation, the controlling of
destructive floods, provision
for the national defense, the
generating of power from
water that would normally go
to waste, and the combatting
of soil erosion."
Prevention has been adopted
as the keynote to solving our problems
in most modern lines of endeavor. In
medicine it has been by the utilization of
preventative vaccines, in sociology by the
removal of factors encouraging crime.
The list is long and should be made
longer by the addition of the field of
flood prevention. By the establishment
of forests, run-off of the surface water
can be reduced in most cases. Since less
water flows into streams, the number
of instances in which dams or levees are
needed is reduced. Foresters are per-
fectly willing and eager for engineers
to construct checks for a time when
forests fail. They ask only that the idea
that dams are a cure-all be discredited.
To some, it would seem that any tie-

Mic/i. Manuf. &amp; Financial Record
up between hydraulic engineering and
forestry is nearly impossible. Yet wit-
ness another paragraph in the T.V.A.
pamphlet:
"But the subduing of running water
extends far beyond the erection of
massive concrete barriers. Rain upon
denuded hillsides carries away millions
of tons of fertile topsoil. The silt will
not settle until the river ceases, behind
a dam for instance. Then it falls to the
bottom. Uncontrolled, this situation
would in time affect navigation."
Speaking further, the pamphlet says
of run-off reduction as its affects soil
erosion:
"To prevent this, the fight against
destructive running water must be

sides are the results of stripping the
hills of their natural cover and plough-
ing the slopes for corn or similar crop.
They must be restored to their original
stability. New forest cover or grasses
with a tangle of roots to hold the soil
causes the rain to soak in, bringing
strength to the vegetation and insuring
that the rain will finally reach the
streams almost clear and free from silt."
So far, only the field of flood control
in its broader scope has been considered.
There are still other fields of endeavor
in which there must be a unification of
forces. In the national forests, roads
and trails are absolute necessities. Sur-
veyors, transportation experts, and
forest administrators must by consulta-
tion decide where roads must be built.
Expense, adaptability for use in protec-
tion of the forest, traffic loads, and the
effect of the roads on the forest itself,
must all be given due consideration
before a project is undertaken. It is
more than the question of the best route
from an engineering standpoint. It is in
this situation that the engineer so often
fails to appreciate the biological side of
the question. One needs only to cite the
case of the Reich's Autobahn from Ber-
lin to the German borders to illustrate
what negligence of this principle may
mean. Instead of building this, one of
the world's greatest highway systems, so
that the timber it passed through would
be protected from windthrow, it was
constructed without regard for the direc-
tion of prevailing winds. Consequently,
many of the roads are bordered on each
side by several hundred feet of fallen
timber. But, that is not the only evil
of misplaced roads and trails. Ill-advised
location of routes may start erosion—
one of the evils that forests are designed
to eliminate. Some of the most serious
examples of soil erosion have originated
from misplaced road beds. Is there any
logical reason why these evils should be
allowed to start when harmonious rela-
tions between the engineer and the
forester can prevent such happenings?
A cry of conservationists since the
movement originated has been for the
substitution in industry of replaceable
resources for the irreplaceable. If this
goal is to be reached, chemical engineers
must be constantly striving to increase
the number and quantity of products
that can be obtained from our renewable
natural products. Foresters, being the
producers of one of the most important

Cooperation between Foresters and Engineers is essential to road building.
.VrtM Week
of these raw materials, must be able to
cooperate with those who produce the
finished goods. One might reasonably
ask, "Where, then, is the quarrel be-
tween the two professions on this sub-
ject?" It is in this very question of
substitution of irreplaceable resources
with renewable materials. Some engi-
neers refuse to give any thought to the
rapidly depleting supplies of crude oil,
coal, and other substances that we get
fromearth deposits. The Farm Chemurgic
Council estimates that our petroleum
reserve is only good for about 15 more
years. [Editor's Note: See article—"The
Fuel Problem," in this issue.] Yet in
this country, development of the use of
wood products in place of oil has actu-
ally been discouraged by chemical engi-
neers. In Europe, where desperate need
exists, the utilization of wood products
for motor and heating fuels has long
been practiced. But, the forester, by his
failure to recognize the superior tech-
nological character of petroleum pro-
ducts has aggravated the ill-feeling and
has thereby slowed up progress in wood
utilization. Both are at fault and in the
settlement of their differences lies the
future hope of the conservationist move-
ment.
Places and means for cooperation be-
tween foresters and engineers in other
fields are many. Stream pollution is
becoming more of a problem. The rela-
tively new field of sanitation as well as
civil engineering will have to deal with
the foresters who handle partly the wild
life found in these streams. In the field
of recreation, engineers will have to do
their part. To anyone who has ever
taken a canoe trip on the Huron river,
the meaning of the last will be doubly
clear. Those low bridges and the power
dams built by engineers who forgot or
never knew the multiple use principle,
will long be remembered by one who has
carried canoes around them. Great
transcontinental highways, though mon-
uments to engineering progress, have
scarred nature almost beyond recogni-
tion. It has become more and more
common for foresters to perform the
duties of a plastic surgeon for nature
by the restoration of almost the original
conditions thereby saving the beauty of
our country for the motorist. Such a
list of opportunities for cooperation can
only be indicative and not exclusive so
it must be kept in mind that there are
other phases to this question.
In all of the fields where there is dis-
agreement, the fact that there is an
essential difference in fundamental con-
cepts stands out. The engineer invari-
ably arrives at the solution to a problem
by thinking in physical terms alone,
while the forester considers only the
biological viewpoint. To do his share
in bringing about harmonious relations,
the engineer must realize that a delicate
biotic balance may be destroyed by ill-
advised construction. The forester, on
the other hand, must carry on his work
with due emphasis to physical consid-
erations. Continued struggle will get the
two professions nowhere; neither side
can win. And it must be remembered
that in accordance with the old proverb
that the forester and his bundle of sticks
will be mighty hard to break—a bundle
of steel beams is even stronger—a union
of steel beams and the bundle of sticks
will never be broken.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


I think many people have only a vague idea of how our company functions
within the Bell System, and how a unique business philosophy is opetating to
make your telephone service increasingly dependable and economical. This adver-
tisement is the briefest possible statement of the philosophy that guides the
Western Electric Company.

PRESIDENT
In 1882 the Bell System became convinced that the best way to assure uniformity
of equipment necessary for universal telephone service was to control its manu-
facture through one organization. To this end it acquired the Western Electric
Company, which operates under this three-fold policy:
1. To make telephone appa-
ratus of high quality.
This in itself is not unusual. What is
unusual is that every item of equip-
ment in the vast network of the Bell
System must coordinate so perfectly that
from any Bell telephone you can talk
clearly with any one of the millions of
others. Can you think of any othet
product which must meet such an ex-
traordinary test?
2. To work for efficiency and
lower costs.
Whether it be in purchasing materials
— or in manufacturing the 43,000 items
of telephone apparatus—or in distrib-
uting all this equipment to the Bell
companies, Western Electric is always
seeking the better way. As a result it
has a progressive record of methods
developed, products improved, econo-
mies effected, and costs lowered.
3. To keep prices at the lowest
possible level consistent with
financial safety.
Western Electric furnishes most of the
telephone equipment used by the opera-
ting companies of the System. By com-
bining their requirements it is able to
manufacture more economically; and it
eliminates selling expenses and credit
losses. The resulting savings it passes
along to its telephone customers in the
form of lower prices.
On these sales the policy of the
Company is to set the lowest prices
which will enable it to pay fair wages
to its employees, to earn a fair return
on the money invested in the business,
and to maintain the Company's finan-
cial stability.
This policy of voluntarily limiting
profits is reflected in the Company's
financial record. In recent years it has
earned on its investment a rate of re-
turn only about half as large as that of
a representative group of comparable
manufacturers, and over a period of
twenty years this rate has averaged
less than 7%.

This set-up within the Bell System re-
sults in low costs to your Telephone
Company, and thus Western Electric
contributes its pan in making Bell Tele-
phone service dependable and eco-
nomical.

FACTORS IN
ENGINEERING ECONOMICS
Profit is at one and the same time
the impetus for and the sustenance of
business activity. It is the invisible force
that motivates the whole machinery of
our economic system. Curtail it and
enterprise is curtailed, increase it and
progressive business activity is stimu-
lated, remove it and the prime motive
on which progress depends is destroyed.
It is not a fixed amount by any means,
but depends upon the field covered, the
demand for the product, and last but
not least, the business acumen of the
management.
The main test for this sagacity of
management is to find a means of in-
creasing the profit. There are in general
two different ways in which this prob-
lem may be solved. First, to increase
the selling price, and second to decrease
the cost. Reduction in cost is attacked
from three different angles—labor, ex-
pense and materials. The average cost
of a certain field of production is divided
as follows: labor 12%, expense 40%,
materials 48%. Nevertheless we find
that the organization controlling labor
(12% of cost) is approximately four
times the size of the organization con-
trolling the other 88%. Let us focus our
attention on this underdeveloped field of
material control, with specific reference
to waste and spoilage.
Waste we will define as the residue
of material after all manufacturing pro-
cesses have been completed. It appears
at the scrap heap as the materials them-
selves, usually unchanged in composi-
tion, but in pieces such as turnings,
clippings, ends of stock, small pieces of
wire, solder, et cetera, so small that they
cannot be used in making a part.
Specific causes of the wastes are num-
erous and varied, but they may be
grouped into classes according to the
fundamental causes, in the order of their
importance:
1. Design of Production.
2. Carelessness and ignorance of
values of materials.
3. Improper planning.
4. Design of manufacturing and
handling equipment.
5. Conditions of materials purchased
from the vendors.
Because the design of a product can
exert an important influence on the
amount of waste, all those connected
with this activity should realize that
efficient use of materials and the elimi-
nation of waste are of prime importance
in manufacturing. Inactive or unneces-
sary parts should be reduced to a mini-
mum. The fact that a round part incurs
more waste than a square one, that an
odd shape, like the hands of a clock,
involves still more waste, and that if a
part is a fraction of an inch larger, it
may demand the next standard size of
material, and so occasion more waste
along the edges of the stock should be
taken into consideration. A little fore-
thought on the part of the designing
engineer counts heavily in the dollars
and cents cost.
Carelessness on the part of operators
can be found in almost any plant, be-
cause of ignorance of values, or a lack
of interest in a particular job to which
one is assigned. Carelessness can be con-
trolled in several ways: discipline, a
system of waste tickets, or an appeal to
the operator's personal pride of achieve-
ment. The last is the most effective and
practical method. It is carried out by
a system whereby each operator's waste
is weighed daily and displayed promi-
nently in the shop. Results are often
apparent within one week. In one case
an apparent saving of $2,000 annually
was reported.
Ignorance of values is another im-
portant factor in waste control. The
education of operators to material values
is a relatively simple matter which takes
little time and reaps valuable results.
Take the case in which operators were
working with a special processed alumi-
num and the waste ran to 15%, or $50
per day. The metal was light and the
operators did not realize the significance
of their wasting. They were told that
the metal was worth $1 per pound.
There resulted an immediate drop to 7%
in waste, or a saving of $8,000 annually.
Another important cause of waste is
improper planning. If the selection of
the proper sizes and forms of materials
is left to the men in the factory under
pressure, it is reasonable to expect that
the best judgment will not always be
exercised. An employee whose job it is
to handle this material planning can do
it more effectively and keep in mind the
fundamentals of efficient utilization.
Proper manufacturing equipment is
vital in the control of waste. Tools are
often designed without much thought to
minimizing waste, and end and side al-
lowances may be much more than is re-
quired. Careful study of each piece to
ascertain the proper size of the blank
and the possibility of utilizing the skele-
ton part, results in the use of special
tools so that both parts may be punched
at the same time. Another possibility
in avoiding waste is that of using wider
material and ''nesting" the pieces where
a peculiar shape is demanded.
The condition of material as received
from the vendors is another place to
watch for waste. To a large extent trade
practice governs the condition of the
material as it is received. For example,
steel plate may not be flat, sheet metal
may not be straight edged, bar stock may
be longer or shorter than specified. Com-
mercial grades of material have definite
specifications, and offending vendors
should be quickly taken to task if the
imperfect material exceeds the allow-
ances.
And now for spoilage. It is defined as
material and labor lost on the parts or
units rejected because they do not fit
specifications or dimensions. They ap-
pear on the scrap heap as parts appar-
ently perfect, but when examined closely
will be found to have a hole drilled
aV' too large, a stripped thread, a small
crack, etc.

SUB-ZERO DEPENDABILITY

The toughness of steel at low tempera-
tures is a vital factor in the performance
of many different types of machines.
Just for example, hundreds of motor
vehicles must operate every winter at
temperatures that make good sub-zero impact
strength in highly stressed parts a necessity.
Molybdenum steels, when properly heat-treated,
have excellent impact properties at low temperatures.
Investigation shows that they retain their toughness
remarkably, even at temperatures as low as —90° F.
Consequently, Molybdenum steels offer great possi-
bilities for the manufacturer of equipment that must
work either continuously or intermittently at low tem-
peratures. Advantage can be taken of their estab-
lished price and fabricating economy, with perfect
assurance of their performance.
We will be glad to send detailed information on
the low-temperature impact properties of several
widely used Molybdenum steels to any one interested.

(Continued jrom page 18)
As with waste we will classify the
main causes of spoilage under several
basic headings.
1. Engineering and drafting error.
2. Defective workmanship.
3. Damage in handling.
4. Defective materials purchased.
5. Surplus and obsolete material.
Many and varied are the tales of
costly results from a mistake on the
drafting board. It is often a small thing
such as the wrong metal here, or an
unforeseen stress there. These defective
parts must be replaced and the bills
often run into hundreds of thousands of
dollars. Defective workmanship counts
heavily in the spoilage list too. A bolt
improperly tightened, a semi-automatic
machine improperly adjusted, or a
thread too deeply cut, may ruin many
an otherwise perfect part. In these cases
the mistake should be traced to the
operator at fault and corrective meas-
ures applied.
From the moment that material is
delivered to a plant until it leaves as a
finished product, it is being constantly
handled by operators, stored, carried by
conveyors, and trucked from one depart-
ment to another. It is not unreasonable
under these conditions to expect a cer-
tain percentage loss due to breakage,
unless special precautions are taken. For
instance, certain porcelains were trans-
ported by truck with the pieces packed
loosely in a tray. The breakage was
2% until corrugated paper spacers were
used between them, and an annual sav-
ing of $350 resulted.
Defective purchased material also
results in spoilage. If the defective parts
cause a large class, they should be re-
turned to the vendor for credit. If it is
small and recurrent, the parts should be
allowed to accumulate until the amount
collected warrants the expense of a com-
plaint. A large amount of loss is incurred
in surplus and obsolete materials. In in-
troducing a new design to replace an old
one, there is danger that old parts which
cannot be used on the new design may
pile up, become obsolete and have to be
scrapped. This condition may be over-
come by balancing the stock on the old
design and using it up before introducing
the new design.
This problem of loss elimination is
one pertinent to our times, and the
solution of it would seem to fall to our
engineers and technical men. These men
are doing a great deal to improve the
condition of industry today, neverthe-
less, there is still room for plenty of
improvement.

PROFESSOR HAWLEYS TESTS
Aided by a grant from the Engineer-
ing College, Professor Hawley of the
Mechanical Department is supervising
tests in the laboratory to determine the
relative merits of different types of coal.
For instance, the heating value of coal
mined in Michigan is being compared
with that of other coals. The different
sizes of coal are also being investigated
in an effort to learn what size should
be used for economy in domestic heat-
ing. As a matter of interest, the shed
recently constructed on the end of the
R. O. T. C. building is used to house
the different grades of coal which are
used in these tests.

CURRICULUM CHANCE IN C. E.
DEPT.
Beginning with the first semester of
the next school year, students enrolled
in civil engineering will not be required
to take Drawing 3. In place of Draw-
ing 3, the Civil Engineering Department
will offer a course in civil engineering
drawing to be known as C.E. 1. The
purpose of the course will be to acquaint
the student with the kind of drawing
done by civil engineers. It also will give
civil engineers an opportunity to become
acquainted with the staff of the Civil
Engineering Department and a chance
to work with problems in which they
have a professional interest.
MICHIGAN THORHAWK
Many have wondered about the fate
of the proposed Michigan Thorhawk.
This unusual airplane was designed by
two Michigan students and after model-
testing it in the wind-tunnel they
planned its immediate construction. The
use of wings from another airplane—
the Hammond Y—was incorporated in
the design and was obtained to simplify
building. But designers Hawkins and
Thorne left school, enthusiasm for its
construction faded, and the whole idea
was indefinitely shelved. All that re-
mains of the Thorhawk is a beautifully
made wind-tunnel model and a pair of
dust-coated wings in the basement of
the East Engineering building.
COAL CONFERENCE
In the spring of this year, either in
late April or May, the second annual
coal conference will be held on the
campus. It will consist of a meeting of
the various coal dealers throughout the
state along with others who are in-
terested. Various papers will be pre-
sented, largely by faculty members,
dealing with the proper size, quality,
etc., of coal for most economical and
efficient use in domestic furnaces. The
purpose of the meeting is to inform the
dealers so that they may be properly
qualified to recommend to the consumer
the correct grade and quality of coal
necessary under specified conditions.

mean a more active building industry.
Many persons wonder whether or not
prefabricated houses will appear "cheap,"
"modern," or "different," than the con-
ventional houses. They will certainly
appear no cheaper than conventional
houses of the same price class. As for
a modern or different appearance, that
will depend upon the prefabricators and
the public. Here as elsewhere, the manu-
facturer can and will make anything the
public is willing to pay for. However,
prefabricators are trying to accustom
the people gradually to modern styled
houses in the same manner as the more
conservative automobile manufacturers
introduced streamlining. The principal
feature of the house of modern appear-
ance will probably be a flat roof. The
builders feel that it is abhorrent to take
new and better building materials and
mould them into lines and textures of
old materials possessing any number of
shortcomings. The old-fashioned slop-
ing roof with its catch-all attics and
gables has little to recommend it and
it is economically unsound for prefab-
rication because it is too inflexible where
standard wall, floor, and ceiling panels
are shifted about into 30 to 200 differ-
ent standard plans. The flat roof may
be very easily transformed into an at-
tractive and useful sun deck by the
addition of an external stair, deck
chairs, awnings, and accessories.
Since most persons do not want their
homes to look like their neighbors',
variety in construction is one quality
the manufacturers will have to attain.
Variety should not be too difficult to
obtain, however, because of the inher-
ent flexibility of the prefabrication sys-
tem. One manufacturer makes all of

his interiors alike but he varies his
exteriors considerably. He believes that
the interior is the most important part
of a house and that when all the inge-
nuity possible has been used for that part
of a home in which the family activities
take place, it should not be necessary
to devise many variations. On the other
hand, a variety of external designs does
away with the prejudice against a group
of houses that all look alike.
Incidentally, only in the prefabricated
house will the low-cost house buyer be
able to obtain the expensive services of
the expert house designer. Also, large
scale prefabrication eliminates the
natural reluctance of the architect and
progressive builder to experiment with
new materials since well-equipped lab-
oratories are available which can de-
termine the best working conditions and
the effect of adverse conditions on the
many new building materials which are
being marketed today.
The low-cost prefabricated houses will
probably have no basements. They will
have a general utility room which will
house the winter air conditioning unit
and all service meters and which would
serve as a laundry and store room. Such

and structural steel, precast concrete
slabs, welded sheet metal, and many
other materials. It can be said rather
definitely that at no other time in
American history has as much talent,
money, and initiative been spent in at-
tempting to furnish the American
worker with good moderately-priced
houses. There has been little public
response to date but after a few ven-
turesome individuals make the initial
purchases, the popularity of prefabrica-
tion should spread rapidly. If industry,
through intensive research, expert de-
sign, mass production, widespread dis-
tribution, and convenient financing can
make quality homes available at low
cost, will the average worker take ad-
vantage of this combined effort and use
it to provide his family with a better
home? The answer probably is no—
unless he is re-educated to a belief in a
different standard of values.

HARMLESS EXHAUST CASES FROM
DIESEL ENGINES
It is interesting to note that although
the ordinary gasoline engine exhaust
contains approximately 7% carbon
monoxide, a diesel engine shows abso-
lutely no trace of this toxic gas. In
repeated tests under varied load condi-
tions there has not been sufficient carbon
monoxide present to indicate even a
small amount of it in the exhaust. This
fact is of particular importance in
undertaking certain types of engineering
projects. More specifically, in mining
operations the diesel engine is wel-
comed because of the fact that a person
cannot withstand, for even a short time,
a greater concentration of carbon mon-
oxide than one part to one thousand
parts of air. The Bureau of Mines has
recently endorsed diesel power for min-
ing operations.
PROPOSE ARTIFICIAL CLIMATE
CENTER
New Yorkers will no longer have to
leave their home town to enjoy the ad-
vantages of exclusive summer resorts
and spas if the proposed health center
materializes. A gigantic artificial climate
center will contain all the mineral and
thermal waters of the world for the New
Yorkers right in their own back yard.
Such was the plan described by Dr.
Goldmerstein of Paris and Professor
Karl Stodiech of Berlin at a recent meet-
ing of the New York Physical Therapy
Society.
The artificial climate center would
also contain medical baths of all kinds:
hot air electrical, vapor, et cetera,
to meet every medical prescription. A
suggestion was also made "to create an
artificial beach of fine sand on the verge
of a vast pool, warmed by an artificial
A/ote5 ofi the
sun and atmosphere, the whole estab-
lishment to be situated in the city itself,
close to the main thoroughfare, and
open all year round."
On this "climate paradise for the
millions'' visitors would be able to bask
in the sunshine of an "artificial Florida,"
or breathe the dry air of Arizona or New
Mexico, or enjoy the benefits of the sea-
shore or mountain tops, while drinking
the vapors of Saratoga Springs, or other
famous spas in distant lands. While the
climate would be manufactured artifici-
ally, with proper requirements of humid-
ity, air pressure, ultra-violet radiation
and temperature, the natural mineral
waters of the world's spas would be
available in bottles.
MICHIGAN MAN WINS
SPERRY AWARD
The Sperry Award for 1937 in recog-
nition of "The greatest contribution to
the advancement of aeronautical sciences
for the year" was given to Clarence L.
Johnson, '32E. He was responsible for
the design of the Lockheed 14, the
world's fastest commercial airplane. The
Sperry Award is widely known as one
of the most distinguished honors in the
aviation field. With justifiable pride we
point out that Clarence Johnson is a
graduate—and a recent one—of the
College of Engineering.
TRANSOCEANIC AIRCRAFT
Of late, there has been a controversy
over whether to build super-liners or
flying boats for transoceanic traffic.
Therefore, it is interesting to investigate
the report of the United States Mari-
time Commission which deals with this
question. According to the survey, it
would be much more economical to build
aircraft on the order of 120,000 pound
flying boats which would carry 40 to 50
passengers and would have a range of
5,000 miles at an average speed of 175
m. p. h. With such a craft, many of the
present hazards would be eliminated. In
this type of aircraft, a business man
could leave New York for London,
spend three days there, and return in
the time consumed by the crossing of a
super-liner.

tions of gasoline, oil pressure and engine
temperature would be made through
new uses of this very old idea: yet such
is the case. Moreover, these new indica-
tors are all made in Ann Arbor. Other
applications of bimetal occur by the
dozens.
Within the memory of living men,
millions of belts have been joined by
wire clips: any one clip is very weak,
but by close spacing of clips, an
extremely strong and flexible joint is
secured. In that same span of time,
literally millions of men have seen such
belt fasteners. Most or all of these men
have at times bought and used note-
books of one kind or another. Most or
all of them at some time wished for a
cheap note book that would be thin
everywhere, yet open out flat and do so
without wearing out the binding. Yet
not until now (that is, a couple or three
years ago) did anyone place on the
market the spiral-wire idea for binding
the cheap notebooks we now see on sale
in every bookstore. If these millions of
belt-lacer men could be assembled for
five minutes, they could collectively
produce the loudest chorus of Why-
didn't-I-think-of-that! ever to be turned
loose anywhere. The writer, having seen
laced belts, and not having thought of
the easy step over to notebooks, would
like to sing bass in the last row of the
chorus.
Do not be misled. We have no facts
as to the spiral-wire inventor; if we
ran him down, it might turn out that
he has yet to see his first set of wire
belt clips. That is not the point. The
interesting fact concerns the way in
which millions—count 'em—of possible
inventors remained bound hand and
foot, so to speak—by the simple little
law of learning which says: You'll use
your learning only in the way you
learned it, if you don't watch out!

EVACUATING
and
DEGASSING
One of the many mercury pumps in the University laboratories.
It is attached to a set up for making special argon-filled lamps
used in the calibration of spectrographic plates.
The research worker finds many occasions in
which it is necessary to remove the air or
other gases from a hollow object so that that
object may better suit his needs. There are
other occasions when he must remove the
gases from a material on which he wishes to
work. One process is called evacuating and the
other degassing. If only moderate vacuums are
required, removal of the gases is accomplished
by a mechanical pump but when rather com-
plete vacuums are required a so-called mercury pump is placed in series with the mechanical
pump. In the mercury pump, the mercury is continuously evaporated and recondensed in such a
manner that the condensed mercury traps molecules of gas from the system.
These high vacuum pumping systems are principally a tool of the chemist and physicist but they
are extensively used in allied branches of research. There are more than a hundred of them
scattered through the various laboratories of the University, each doing its bit in connection
with academic or industrial research projects.
This is another example of the facilities which are available through

PUTT PUTT
One of the stars of Michigan's golf
team is Alfred Karpinski, senior in the
Engineering College. Al grew up with
the game, having served his apprentice-
ship in the art of turf-busting as a
caddie, like so many of golf's great.
While attending Benjamin Franklin
High School in Rochester, New York,
Al accumulated twelve letters for par-
ticipation in basketball, baseball, soccer
and golf. Since coming to Michigan Al
has narrowed his athletic endeavors to
golf alone and has won his letter in the
sport in his sophomore and junior years.
He was a member of the team which
won the Big Ten Golf Championship in
1935 and now, as Captain of the team,
he is looking forward to the Champion-
ship Meet to be held in Minneapolis in
May, 1938.
Second to golf the thing Al knows
most about is engineering. He is study-
ing Engineering Mechanics, which inci-
dentally has the smallest enrollment of
any of the Engineering specialties, there
being four undergraduates in the de-
partment. His interest in engineering
seems to be a part of the family herit-
age—Al has two other brothers actively
engaged in engineering work.
The financing of Alfred's education
has been a one-man job. He has earned
all of his college expenses by working
during summer vacations and working
at a board and N.Y.A. job while attend-
ing school. The financial situation was
somewhat relieved, however, by a Man-
delbaum scholarship which Al won in
his junior year. He has been rewarded
for his merits as an athlete and engi-
neer by election to Vulcans, Triangles,
and Michigamua.
Al will gradutae in June and hopes to
go into research and development work.
SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN
One of the leading candidates for the
title of "Michigan's Most Cultured En-
gineer" is Irving Brown, late of Bir-
mingham, Alabama. This soft-spoken
southerner was born in New Jersey but
soon found himself basking in Dixie's
warm climate to which he is so partial.
Among the half-dozen towns he has
called home is Hannibal, Missouri,
where he attended high school. It was
while here, in the home town of Mark
Twain, that he distinguished himself on
the local football team and hatched the
idea of coming to the University of
Michigan.
Ann Arbor's fine opportunity to enjoy
good music was one of Irving's main
reasons for choosing Michigan as the
place to continue his education. Irving
probably takes more interest in his lei-
sure time than any one in the Engineer-
ing School. True to his Southern tem-
perament these hours are not spent in
wearing him down physically. A good
concert, a good play, or a good book are
to Irving the things that make leisure
worth while. Not content with just the
Choral Union Concerts, Irving can be
found about three times a month in
Detroit taking in what the big town
has to offer in the way of good music
and drama. He also takes an occasional
trip to Chicago and Cleveland when an
exceptional musical program is in store.
The Boston Symphony Orchestra is tops
with him; and he never misses a chance
to hear Kirsten Flagstad, or to quote
Shakespeare.
Even though one is impressed by the
unhurried manner with which this
Southern gent approaches things, he
does get results. As a Junior he was
elected to Tau Beta Pi, and as a Senior
was made a member of the Vulcans, the
senior honor society.
Irving plans to return to school next
year to begin graduate work in Chemi-
cal Engineering. He will concentrate on
development, research, and culture.
CARL CLEMENT
Combustion may come and levers
may go but the Mechanicals march on
forever. Long enough ago to be in-
cluded in this year's Senior class, a cer-
tain Carl Clement of Toledo, Ohio, de-
cided to enter Michigan and join the
procession.
Since then Carl has managed to figure
pretty prominently in campus affairs.
Looking over his record, we find him
class treasurer in his freshman and
sophomore years, on the Class Finance
Committee last year, as well as the Cap
and Gown Committee this year. So-
cially, he is a member of Theta Delta
Chi, has helped put across a number of

Ball this year, and the Dorm, Key and

maxing apprenticeship at the Union by
becoming its Vice-President. Honora-
ries have recognized him too. He is
president of Vulcans, last year's treas-
urer of Triangles, and a member of
Quarterdeck.
Carl is known to most of us as the
lad who was arrested at the Scabbard
and Blade initiation one evening last
year, for doing nothing, with malice
aforethought. It happened that the
initiate who preceded Carl on guard
duty at a certain clubhouse nearby, had
inadvertently badly scared some of Ann
Arbor's smaller fry, who immediately
informed police headquarters. The Ann
Arbor bluecoats charged out post haste
to investigate, and with searchlight,
shotgun and pistol made quick work of
our hero and his grease clogged, firing
pinless, pre-war armaments. Worried
Carl was officially conducted to the local
Alcatraz for further questioning. It
took the better part of two hours and
the combined efforts of several of the
higher ups, including Mayor Sadler,
Scabbard and Blade member, to con-
vince the guardians of the law of our
now highly amused suspect's good in-
tentions.
Carl is still enthusiastic about the
benefits to be derived from an R.O.T.C.
training. In hobbies he leans heavily
towards yachting and yacht designing,
and is now working on a twenty foot
sloop of his own design. A senior me-
chanical, Carl is still hazy about his
plans after graduating, but of course
hopes to be a success. For several
reasons we think he will be.

TEST ALUMNI DAY
nPO celebrate the third annual reunion of engineer-
■*• ing graduates of General Electric Test, men all
over the world gathered in groups to listen to the
ternational radiobroadcast of the reunion at
enectady, N. Y. Officers and prominent members
m'P.T.M.. or Past Test Men's Association, sent
greetings to their fellow Testmen over the General
Electric shortwave stations, W2XAD and W2XAF.
More than 15,000 men have graduated from G-E
Test—a course which enables them to supplement

their theoretical knowledge with a practical training.
Test graduates today hold many responsible posi-
tions in the Company. Others have gone into every
walk of life—engineers, lawyers, utility executives,
farmers, industrial leaders, bankers, and many other
professions. There is, however, one tie which binds
them all—their experience "on Test," and to many
of them that experience is recalled with somewhat
the same enthusiasm as days in college.

OIL FROM WATER
T\OWN on the shores of Lake Maracaibo in the
*-* steaming jungles of Venezuela, the Dutch Shell
Company owns rights to a fifty-mile frontage. Here
it has drilled hundreds of wells to make avail-
able the rich oil found in deposits ranging from 1500
to 5000 feet below the lake surface.
The natural gas which accompanies the oil deposits
has for years been used to power the wells. In spite
of this cheap source of power, General Electric
engineers under the supervision of E. E. Thomas,
Kansas State '22, were able to convince officials of
the Dutch Shell Company that it would be more
economical in the long run to use electricity instead
of natural gas and gas engines for operating power.
As a result, a high-voltage line will be erected along
the lake shore, from which step-down transformers
will distribute current to the motors in the producing
areas.
The Lago Petroleum Company has wells in a sec-
tion paralleling the Dutch properties and extending
ten miles out in the lake, which has already been
electrified. The combination of these two com-
panies makes the largest electrified system of its
kind in the world, from which 400,000 barrels of
oil are shipped daily to refineries in Aruba and
Curacao, N.W.I.

WHISTLING GASES
/"^ ASES are liquefied to be used as cooling agents
^-* and to conserve storage space. Chester W.
Rice, Harvard '10, consulting engineer in the
Schenectady Works of the General Electric Company,
has developed a method of thus processing gases
more readily by making them whistle.
To liquefy a gas by this method, it is necessary to
compress it to 3,000 pounds per square inch, cool it,
and pass it through a series of tubes into a liquefy-
ing chamber where the pressure is released through a
valve in the form of a whistle, producing a further
escape of heat energy. Mr. Rice's whistle is so
pitched as to convert the greatest amount of heat
energy into sound energy. To be effective, however,
the sound energy must be carried away from the
liquefying chamber.
Developments such as this are being made by
college graduates who were at one time "on Test."
Many of them have been off the college campus
but a few years and are entering a career in one of
the many business and engineering fields in the
General Electric Company.

(Z^fteF \he deluge—
How human to feel the surge of red-hot
anger when some careless, unthinking
fellow (ofttimes ourselves!) "ruins" our
well-groomed appearance! But, fortu-
nately, fast on the heels of our ire comes
a consoling thought—
There is the dry cleaner who, almost
magically, will restore to our apparel
its original faultless condition.
This business of preserving the good
appearance of our wardrobes is far more
scientific than the great majority of us
imagine.
Those simple and familiar instructions,
"Clean and press," set in motion a highly
developed process involving fine engi-
neering and the latest advances in
chemistry.
In the more modern dry cleaning plants
you will find special dry cleaning systems
that are noteworthy achievements in
engineering. These finely conceived
pieces of equipment take each batch of

garments and do many things. They
accomplish thorough cleaning, of course.
But they also carefully guard against
damage, even to the most delicate fabrics.
They carefully control moisture content,
thus reducing to a negligible minimum
the danger of shrinking or stretching.
They eliminate residual odors relative
to the cleaning process. So ingenious
is the operation of these modern systems
that perfect dry cleaning is virtually
automatic.
Matching these mechanical systems are
the special organic solvents produced
by Dow. Careful research by Dow
technicians has resulted in synthetic
solvents far superior to the old-fashioned,
hazardous natural solvents.
These modern solvents clean more
thoroughly—leaving nooily film to attract
new dirt. They are safe—being both
nonflammable and nonexplosive. And,
they enable the dry cleaner to deliver
your garments free from offensive clean-
ing odors.
Dow enjoys the distinction of producing
organic solvents, especially developed to
complement the majority of modern dry
cleaning systems.
So, be not disturbed, beyond reason,
when some inadvertency renders your
apparel unsightly. Remember, there is
the dry cleaner—ready to restore the
cleanliness, lustre and faultless lines you
so highly prize.

Summer Work for Undergraduates
PROBABLY from 60 to 80 per cent
of our undergraduates have summer
jobs. The figure may be even higher;
but we are here making a safe estimate
which will give a good-and-bad year
average. The estimate includes those
who go to summer school. It should be
understood that the college has made no
general survey, and that the estimate is
based on the experience in two or three
departments. In good years, it may run
to 90 per cent.
Irrespective of the merits of the sum-
mer job question, a majority of our
students find it necessary to earn sum-
mer money. The typical savings are
inconsequential; the main factor seems
to be that of relieving the family budget
as much as possible, and any income
at any time will help in that direction.
Some students are fortunate enough to
live at home, and hold a shop job at
regular skilled-worker rates. Savings for
later use in school are in such cases,
very real items.
The college has no official policy or
attitude toward summer work. Unques-
tionably, however, the usual engineering
faculty member favors rather strongly,
the idea of industrial jobs for students
through the summer. The background
of an engineering student today is very
different in two respects, from what it
was 20 years ago. Then, it was relatively
easier to gain access to shops,—not only
to wander through them, but to get work
in them at an early age; at the same
time, the products of the Machine Age
were very inadequately reported on, in
current reading matter. Today, strang-
ers (and sometimes even friends) are
not cheerfully permitted to wander at
will through company premises; and the
temporary employee is not welcomed in
some quarters. On the other hand, there
is a wealth of current and readable
literature on shop processes and pro-
ducts, and on advances in engineering.
Thus today's student is better off by
far, in terms of reading background;
but he is at a serious disadvantage as to
observation and experience.
In this college, we are very well or-
ganized to assist the senior in his place-
ment problems. This happy situation
directly reflects the fact that a goodly
section of industry is itself organized
to the same end. Year after year we
are heavily recruited for graduates. At
the same time, the placement of the
undergraduate in summer work is al-
most entirely on the amateur, catch-as-
catch-can basis. That summer job, like
oil, is where you find it. Prospecting
for oil is gradually "going scientific,"
and with fine results. There are reasons
to believe that summer work may be
given the same tendency—if we all work
toward that end. "All" includes three
parties: faculty members, industrial
units, and the students themselves.
Every student of ours who returns to
us in the fall and leaves behind him
an employer who wishes there were
more like him, is helping to solve the
problem. Every student who leaves
a summer employer in the opposite
frame of mind, is making it worse for
the other fellow.
There are some firms that cannot
possibly give summer employment,
simply because they have labor contracts
with seniority rules that will not per-
mit student employment except in ex-
ceedingly brisk times. Other firms have
such contracts, but in such form that
students can be hired on a technical-
training basis. Most companies are not
so bound.
Those who really want industrial ex-
perience will do well, in these rather
bad times, to spend their efforts where
they are more likely to count for some-
thing. The Detroit area sensitively
responds to the state of health of car
sales. You will not find Detroit industry
keenly responsive to your needs, until
you read of less woe in the automotive
industry. Also, some industries typi-
cally go flat in the summer time; avoid
them, and save your time—unless you
have learned that some firm deliberately
takes a few summer students for train-
ing, experience, and possible permanent
employment later.
It is well to look ahead by beginning
now, with letters, to a number of se-
lected employers. Do not, in these
parlous times, be so brash as to ask
for a promise today of work to be
started in June. All the employer can
do is to say, "No." He might-even say
NO. Or even, NO! But write any
way, and propose that you be kept in
mind for later consideration; also, that
you'll be glad to be available for an
interview during Easter vacation. Until
you get an absolute turn-down, or until
you get an interview, keep working the
follow-up; write to the employer about
once a month, just to keep your hand
in, and so that he will not have to guess
about your continued availability. In
the follow-up, do not write the kind of
letter he will have to answer. Write the
kind that will keep you before him, but
without adding to his burdens.
Every such letter should be well-
typed, on good, plain, 8.5 by 11 paper;
otherwise, don't send the letter. Inter-
views get jobs. No interview, no job.
Letters lead to interviews or the waste
basket. Only acceptable letters lead to
interviews.
It can happen that after you have
been held off all spring by an employer
another student will drop in to see him
in June—and be hired on the spot. Some
employers simply will never employ
anyone until the place is opened up;
others are simply unable to predict the
future, and are not in a position to take
action until orders are in hand. In other
cases, it amounts to taking on the
student who is there in person, as
against taking more of a chance on sev-
eral who have never been interviewed,
and who may no longer be available in
June.

H. RICHARD STEDING, '40E
ONE hundred years ago rubber was
produced in limited quantities
only, and its use depended mainly upon
its water-proofing effect. Today, crude
rubber consumption in the United States
amounts to over 1,200,000,000 pounds
annually, -and it has thousands of differ-
ent uses. By far the most important
use of rubber is found in the manufac-
ture of automobile tires, and the rubber
industry owes its present development
to the stimulus provided by the con-
stantly increasing demand by the auto-
motive industries for better and better
automobile tires. Thirty years ago an
automobile tire did well to last for
2,000 miles. Today it is possible for
a motorist to get from 20,000 to 30,000
miles service from a good tire. Improved
manufacturing methods have also made
it possible to have this improved quality
at a lower price. One tire manufacturer
claims that a dollar spent in 1909
bought fifty miles of tire travel, while
a dollar spent in 1936 bought 2,000
miles of service—an increase (disregard-
ing changes in the price level) of 3,900
per cent. This improved economy has
been accomplished only through the
medium of scientific research, and this
research has resulted in a large number
of discoveries, each of which has con-
tributed in some way to the development
of the modern automobile tire. To ex-
amine all of these landmarks in the
development of the rubber industry
would be practically impossible, but we
can consider a few of the more impor-
tant developments which stand out from
the others. Before doing so, however,
perhaps it would be well if we were to
examine the function of the tire in the
modern automobile.
One of the primary functions of the
tire is the part it plays as a contribut-
ing factor in riding comfort. The tire
is by no means the only thing to be con-
sidered in the riding comfort of a pass-
enger car, but neither is it the least. As
we shall see later, flexibility, pressure
and balance are things which have a
great deal to do with this question of
riding comfort. Another function of the
tire is to provide a non-skid or frictional
contact between the car and the road
surface. Tread is an important consid-

Today a motorist gets from 20,000 to 30.000 miles of service from a tire.
eration in this respect. A corollary of
this second function is that the tire must
act as an agent to facilitate steering.
Here too, tread, balance and pressure
are important aspects. These are by no
means the only functions of the tire,
but, in general, they cover all of the
more important ones. In order to better
understand how these functions have
been considered in the manufacturing
process let us look at the construction
of the modern automobile tire.
In order to obtain enough rubber to
make a tire for an average low-priced
car, two rubber trees must be tapped
for a whole year. But rubber is not
the only material used in the manufac-
ture of tires. Of equal importance with
rubber is cotton fabric, of which
375,000,000 pounds were used by the
rubber industry in 1936. Even after
enough cotton and crude rubber has
been made available, it is necessary to
have numerous other raw materials such
as carbon black, zinc oxide, copper wire,
sulphur, pine tar, clay, mica and rosin,
all of which play an important part in
the manufacture of rubber products.
Physically, the tire consists of several
different parts. These parts are known
as the tread and side wall, the body
plies, the wire bead, the breaker strip
and the chafer strip. The tread and side
walls are made of chemically treated
rubber but no cotton fabric. The tread
is the thick outer casing on the rim of
the tire to which is given a certain
characteristic shape which helps give the
tire its non-skid properties. The body
plies are the layers of rubberized fabric
on the inside of the tire which serve to
give the tire body and strength. The
bead is a cord containing a number of
strands of copper or steel wire covered
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


is to fasten the tire to the rim and to
prevent it from blowing off. The breaker
strip is a strip of specially constructed
fabric which is placed between the tread
and the body plies. The function of this
strip is to distribute the load around the
entire tire. Chafer strips are strips of
fabric placed around the bead for fur-
ther protection against rim wear.
The main function of the tread on
the tire is to provide an agent of traction
and anti-skid. Up to around 1908, the
tread of the tire was not considered
to be important. At that time certain
designs made their appearance incorpo-
rating those principles which seemed
most practical for non-skid purposes. It
has been found that the coefficient of
friction of tires on road surfaces may
vary from 0.02 to 0.70, depending upon
the type of road and the prevailing
climatic conditions. Opinions differ as
to whether it is possible to alter this
coefficient of friction by a change in
design of treads, but no universally ac-
cepted tests have been devised as yet
for measuring non-skid properties.
Tread does present an important
problem, however, to the sound engi-
neers. It was found that the non-skid
tread coming in contact with the road
surface at high speeds produced a road
hum and rumble which had to be re-
duced to a minimum. The tires caused
certain vibrations at certain speeds
which were a contributing factor to wear
and fatigue, not only in the tires, but
sometimes to other parts of the car.
This condition was especially pronounced
after the tires had been driven several
thousand miles and had worn unevenly.
Tests were made on various tire con-
structions and tread designs by means
of a microphone and radio receiving in-
strument which recorded the noise in
decibels caused by each. One company
found through this research that noise
was greatly eliminated by unevenly
spaced blocks in the design, by elimi-
nating buttons in the design and by the
use of continuous ribs. It was also found
that the greater the approach to a flat
tread, the greater the thumping noise
over raised objects or joints in the road
surface. Thus, the whole problem of
tread design centers around a compro-
mise between noise elimination on one
hand and tread wear and non-skid prop-
erties on the other.
When pneumatic tires were first de-
veloped, they were of the clincher type.

Automotive Industries
Rubber tires have made tractors more versatile.
This type of tire was very difficult to
mount on the rims, and it tended a great
deal to rim cut. The carcass was made
from square-woven fabric or canvas. In
order to eliminate rim cut the straight-
side tire with the non-extensible bead
was developed. This tire was much
easier to apply to the rims and elimi-
nated a great deal of the rim cut. The
development of the straight side tire,
however, emphasized the weaknesses of
the square-woven fabric used for the
carcass. The square-woven fabric is
fabric in which the threads running the
long way are of the same size and thick-
ness as those running crosswise. No
matter how carefully this fabric was
rubberized, it was found that these
threads were continually chafing and
sawing each other as the tire flexed due
to irregularities in the road surface. The
faster the car was driven, the more
pronounced was this effect, and the fric-
tional heat generated soon burned out
the life of the tire.
The cord tire was developed to elimi-
nate this disadvantage. The fabric in
this tire consisted of slightly larger cords
running lengthwise with only very light
threads running crosswise. During the
manufacturing process these threads are
broken down entirely, and the finished
tire consists of a row of strong cords
running parallel to each other and in-
sulated from one another by a coating
of rubber. This type of fabric was an
improvement over the square-woven
fabric in that it was stronger, more
resilient, and greatly eliminated friction
and power losses. The fabrics in the
tires of today are all made on some
elaboration of this principle. The cas-
ing is made up of a number of plies of
rubberized fabric cut on the bias to
secure greater resilience, with each ply
alternating in angle to give interlocking
reinforcement. Each ply is separated
from its neighbor by a cushion of rub-
ber which further eliminates internal
friction.
The tire industry owes its existence
to the discovery of the process of vul-
canization by Charles Goodyear. In
1839, he discovered that when rubber
is heated with sulphur, the resulting
product is a highly elastic and tough
material. Other improvements in the
chemical compounding of rubber have
also contributed to the development of
the tire industry. In 1899, a process
was developed to reclaim used rubber.
In 1906, it was discovered that the vul-
canization process could be greatly
accelerated by the addition of certain
organic substances. Prior to that time,
sixty to ninety minutes were required
to cure an inner tube, and from three
to four hours to cure a tire. Today,
only five to eight minutes are required
from the first process, and less than one
hour for the latter. Since 1912, carbon
black has replaced the zinc oxide with
which the tires were impregnated to im-
prove wearing quality. Another general
improvement was the development of
age resistors which increased general tire
life. In recent years, changes had to
be made in the compounds in the tread
in order to eliminate static in the car
radio.

Advances in automobile manufacturing have been paralleled by progress in the tire industry.
Flexibility is also a very important
problem to be considered in the manu-
facture of the tire. The tire is supposed
to function as an envelope which holds
air, while the air is expected to carry
the load. Because of this it is necessary
that the tire carcass be very flexible in
itself so that the air column may func-
tion with as little restriction as possible.
The flexibility of the tire depends on
both inflation pressure and air volume.
The pneumatic tires first used on auto-
mobiles were of relatively small cross-
section and operated at between fifty
to sixty pounds pressure. In 1923,
however, the so-called balloon tire made
its appearance. This tire was simply a
tire with an increase of about twenty-
five per cent in the area of the cross-
section and with a considerably reduced
air pressure. The effect of this change
was to greatly increase cushioning quali-
ties of the tire and to eliminate high
frequency vibrations which manifest
themselves as body noises and rattles.
This, in turn, tended to prolong body
life.
There are several reasons for the
effects produced by this change. To
consider these we must divide road ir-
regularities into two types—those of
high amplitude and long duration, and
those of low amplitude and high fre-
quency. The tire of large section and
low pressure can do very little to im-
prove riding quality over roads of the
former type, as can be readily seen. In
the latter case, however, the dampening
effect of the low pressure on road irregu-
larities greatly improves riding comfort.
Tests have shown that at the high-speed
passage of the tire over a small obstacle
there is no upward motion of the axles;
the tire completely swallows the obstacle.
In order to better understand the dif-
ferent effects of high and low pressure
in the tire, it must be explained that
road impacts are of two kinds. When a
tire first hits an obstacle in the road,
the car receives an impact known as a
shock reaction. If the obstacle is large
enough to give the axle an upward
motion, the tire passes over the obstacle
and drops back to the road, and the car
receives what is known as a drop reac-
tion. The Bureau of Public Roads has
studied these types of impacts and has
measured their values for speeds up to
seventy-five miles per hour.
Two tires with the same static wheel
load of 925 pounds were tested over an
obstacle four inches wide and one-quar-
ter inch thick. One tire was a 5.25-18
tire at thirty-two pounds inflation, and
the other was a 7.50-15 with a fifteen
pound inflation pressure. It was found
that the first tire developed an addition-
al impact reaction of 195 pounds, while
the low-pressure tire received an addi-
tional force of only seventy-five pounds.
For a one-half inch obstacle of the same
width the additional forces were 335
pounds and 150 pounds respectively.
Thus we see that impact reactions vary
directly with inflation pressures. It
was also found that drop reactions tend
to reach their maximum values between
twenty and forty miles an hour, and
that above this speed the tire tends to
swallow the obstacle and to develop drop
reactions of decreasing magnitude.
Shock reactions increase up to forty
miles an hour and tend to remain con-
stant above that speed. These reactions
were all found to be greater in magni-
tude for the high-pressure tires than for
the low-pressure tires. Under severe
roughness conditions it was found that
reactions as high as three or four times
the static wheel loads may be developed
with high-pressure equipment, while it
is possible, under favorable conditions,
to keep reactions down to as low as
one and one-tenth the static wheel load
with low pressure equipment.
Thus we see that the introduction of
the balloon tire has made possible
higher car speeds and has greatly re-
duced impact reactions both to the
vehicle and to the road. The lower
pressures have also increased non-skid
properties because of the greater area of
contact with the road. However, this
new type of equipment has also created
a great many other problems which
were not previously present. These
problems have to do with the steering,
the engine to car speed ratio, spring
design, shock-absorber action, and many
other details. These problems all have
to be solved by some kind of compromise,
either in the construction of the tire or
in the design of some other part of the
automobile. In fact, the problems of
tire manufacturing must all be solved
by effecting some sort of compromise in
the conditions and specifications which
the tire is expected to fulfill.
Looking backward, we see that the
tire industry has come a long way in
the last thirty years. The question is
how far it may be expected to progress
in the future. One authority has pointed
out that the limit of automobile speed
and of the demand for improved riding
quality has not yet been reached. On
the other hand, the limit of satisfying
these demands with present materials
has almost been reached. Therefore,
the future trend must be toward new
materials or new combinations of present
materials.

JUST about now most civil engineer-
ing and geodesy students are begin-
ning to think pretty seriously about the
camp question. The problem breaks
down to the relative attraction between
a summer session in Ann Arbor, one
at Camp Davis in the Jackson Hole
country of Wyoming, and a summer's
earnings at jobs that range from camp
counseling to night watching in a fruit
market. The question of camp attend-
ance should not be decided on anything
but the merits of the work engaged in
at the camp. The geographical location
of the camp, in so far as it permits field
work in surveying, should have no bear-
ing; and, although Michigan can boast
one of America's most modernly equip-
ped surveying camps located in a natural
wonderland, that point will be com-
pletely ignored in the forthcoming dis-
cussion.
The problem can best be solved by

evaluating the student's attitude toward
his profession. It is useless to deny
that there are students who are primarily
interested in getting through school with
a minimum of effort. This whole educa-
tional plant is a series of hurdles that
lie between them and a $125 a month
job at the end of their senior year.
Background, foundation, engineering
vision interest these students little and
they make no effort to spend a summer
session in a surveying camp.
Those who work on engineeering jobs
during the summer have some reason to
deny their profession the background
offered by the comprehensive training
period at Camp Davis. They receive
some practical training in engineering
work and if the foreman or the chief
of party has the time they may actually
learn some of the correlating theory
that has contributed to whatever they
are doing. Regardless of what they do
in engineering during the summer, and
even if they were to work the entire
summer recess of 15 weeks, they can
hardly deny, nor will their foremen or
chiefs of party deny, the superiority of
supervised and planned engineeering in-
struction offered by surveying camps
such as Michigan's. A man may spend
his entire vacation running levels for
his particular state highway department,
and although this is certainly practical
it hardly compares with laying out an
entire road at Davis. In road work at
Davis every member of a four-man
group does every job including that of
acting as Chief of Party.
Camp here at Michigan is designed to
come after the student's sophomore year.
This leaves the student his junior sum-
mer to work, and trained as he should
be by a summer at Davis, he will have
enhanced his value as a worker and
should be able to get more engineering

he does during that summer. Only men
who spend their summers in engineering
work are being discussed here. Those
who elect to guard beaches or sell
brushes in the Adirondacks when other
jobs arc. open belong to the same group
of students that are taking engineering
because they are handy around machin-
ery.
Look at the matter this way: By
electing to go to college we have taken
four years out of our lives and invested
them in acquiring an engineering educa-
tion. This should be considered in mak-
ing all subsequent decisions concerning
this education. How are we to exploit this
four year investment so as to make
ourselves the best possible engineers?
Certainly the experience of a surveying
camp, which at Davis includes work in
highways and railroads, mapping,
astronomy, building layout, bridges,
canals, land subdivision, geodesy and
general camp life cannot be exchanged
on equal terms with a summer at spe-
cialized, uncorrelated and ineffectual
sub-engineering work. We are not so
naive as to ignore financial aspects of
a summer's recess. But let us remember
that our educations, besides an invest-
ment of years, cost someone, our families
and society in general, upwards of five
thousand dollars. The one hundred fifty
dollars that represents total camp costs
is an unimportant three per cent addi-
tional investment that increases the
value of the product by at least one
fifth. The student who went to camp
and did not learn as much engineeering
in the eight weeks than he did in any
one year on the campus missed the boat.
The argument of financial need is met
easier than some people think. Professor
Davis, founder of Michigan's surveying
camp system, left a fund from which
loans are easily obtainable for those
students desiring to attend camp. The
Department of Geodesy and Surveying
assists in arranging a means of trans-
portation to its camp in Wyoming.
Looking at it economically or profess-
ionally the answer to the question,
''Shall I go to camp?," is emphatically,
"Yes!" No decision you will make will
ever provide you more engineering edu-
cation per day.
Applied Mechanic*

J. ORMONDROYD
Professor of Engineering Mechanics
MECHANICS is the science whose
field is the description of the mo-
tion of physical bodies. The science of
mechanics would seem to be of great
interest and use to the engineer whose
task is to combine physical bodies into
stationary and moving groups which
are useful to mankind. Yet many prac-
ticing engineers refer to these sciences
scornfully as "theories." The student
has a right to ask the question, "Are
the branches of the science of mechan-
ics actually used in industry?" The an-
swer, of course, is, "Yes."
The most essential activity of any en-
gineer is quantitative prediction. An en-
gineer deals with ideas, specifications,
blue prints; he doesn't build bridges
or machines; he indicates how they are
to be built to function satisfactorily.
He is always asked "how much"—how
much the structure will weigh, how big
it will be, how well it will sustain its
loadings, how much it will cost, when
it will be finished, and so on. He is ex-
pected to give specific, quantitative an-
swers to questions like these before
a single mechanic puts one hand on any
piece of material.
The only method for correct predic-
tion that man has ever discovered is
based on experience. All we can do is
to observe what can and does happen
and remember it. If our observation is
keen and accurate and our memory is
good concerning the action of a given
combination of physical bodies, then
we can safely and successfully predict
what a similar combination will do in
the future.
Of all the different situations which
may confront an engineer, only a lim-
ited number can be included in his
past, personal experience. The time
honored methods of "cut and try" en-
gineering are based on this paucity of
personal experience. By them a success-
ful structure is achieved by successive
approximations. But this takes time—it
costs money—it expends enormous
amounts of personal energy. By this
method the individual builds up his
experience at the expense of delaying
the successful outcome of the action de-
manded at the beginning of the process.
Most of the defects which show up
in the course of such a "cut and try"
process could be predicted on the basis
of the accumulated and recorded ex-
perience of other men.
Mechanics is the recorded experience
of thousands of men gathered through
the last three hundred years. It is not
the mere description of the millions
of individual situations which were ob-
served in the past. It is the highly dis-
tilled essence of all those situations. A
few laws gained by experience, a finite
number of convenient definitions and
the symbolic language of elementary
mathematics are all that one needs to
learn to gain possession of this treasure
of practical experience. Naturally, merely
reading the recorded statements of laws,
definitions and mathematical processes
does not put one in possession of them
—they must be gotten by actively using
them.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


ries" of engineering mechanics is to
avoid, as much as possible, the expense,
time and energy consumed in experi-
menting with each individual problem as
it arises. With the use of mechanics the
experiments can be carried out on pa-
per. Where experiments must be carried
out on actual structures, properly ap-
plied mechanics permits us to direct
those experiments in such a way as to
give us the greatest results with the least
expense.
There are many problems in engi-
neering for which the mechanical sci-
ences give complete and easily used an-
swers. Every draftsman using a hand-
book is applying these obvious answers
to his designs and drawings, for a hand-
book is merely a convenient collection
of the mechanical laws and experimental
results obtained in the past.
A more spectacular use of mechanics
is found in those fields where experi-
mentation is absolutely necessary. There
are three general situations in which
experimenting is needed. First, in sit-
uations where we have actual gaps in
our factual knowledge of the processes
involved in the operation of the ma-
chine to be built. Second, where a struc-
ture or machine is so complicated that
the recorded experience, although pos-
sibly adequate, can only be applied with
overwhelming difficulty. Third, where
the structure or machine is so unique
and expensive that no chances can be
taken.
By using mechanical principles in
their most general form (dimensional
analysis) we can follow a simple, quick
and cheap procedure of testing models
of the structures in question. Model
testing is very effective when used with
a clear understanding of the relation-
ships between the test results on the
model and the behavior of the actual
structure. The model test results must
be translated to suit the dimensions of
the prototype (the actual structure).
Without the mechanical principles
needed to make this translation, model
testing becomes misleading and danger-
ous.
Model tests were first used in the
field of Hydro-dynamics to measure re-
sistance offered to bodies moving
through fluids. This problem is typical
of a large class of problems which deal
with the effects of various types of fric-
tion. The details of frictional resistances
acting on bodies moving in various sur-
roundings have resisted successful de-
tailed description to such an extent that
actual cases which are not exceedingly
simple must be studied experimentally.
The resistance to the motion of ships
through water to airplanes and dirigibles
through the air are all studied today by
the use of models. All questions of effi-
ciency in machines are studied by the
experimental methods. The efficiencies
of turbine blades and nozzles, and of
pumps and blowers are successfully
measured on models, thus avoiding dis-
astrous disappointment in the actual
performance of the prototypes. This
type of model testing represents the in-
telligent reaction to the first typical sit-
uation mentioned above in which we are
confronted by an actual hiatus in our
detailed knowledge.
Good examples of the second situa-
tion mentioned above in the use of
models for important structures are the
numerous models built of the mounting
for the 200-inch telescope. Of these
models the most interesting and useful
was the l/30th scale model of the moun-
ting built of celluloid. This model was
used for angular deflection tests and in-
dicated the existence of deformations
which could not be predicted by the
usual mathematical methods. This struc-
ture, an unsymmetrical frame, could be
and was submitted to well-known meth-
ods of analysis for deflections. But these
led to such complicated expressions that
the designers were lost in the maze of
details. The model tests were the only
way out.
The third situation is illustrated in
the design procedure of large bridges,
large dams, floating dry docks and dir-
igible frameworks. These structures cost
millions of dollars, they are usually dif-
ferent in many respects from previous
structures in the same field, and most
important of all, their failure in service
means danger to human life. Small scale
models costing many thousands of dol-
lars and many months to build are con-
sidered cheap for the purpose they serve.
Experiments and tests on actual struc-
tures become fruitful likewise when di-
rected by the dictates of mechanics. No
test is worth its cost unless it is pre-
ceded by a definite theory based on the
laws of mechanics. A wrong theory, if

it is specific in its predictions, is better
than none; since a preconceived idea
of what may happen makes the tester
look for definite results. These either
materialize or they do not, the test in-
formation becomes clear cut; the theory
is either justified or definitely disproved.
In either case the next move is distincly
presented to the experimenter.
An engineer may build his own experi-
ence from the ground up for himself.
Or he may use the experience of the
world's great thinkers and experiment-
ers as a foundation on which to rear
his personal experience. If he follows
the second course he has great men for
his assistants. If he follows the first
course he works alone—and life is short.

THE continued increase in the use of
spectrographs methods of quantita-
tive chemical analysis indicates a grow-
ing confidence in these methods and a
sustained record of success. Since the
introduction of modern methods, based
upon the measurement of the relative
intensities of spectral lines applied to
an analytical curve, there has been a
steady increase in the use of spectro-
scopic methods and a rapid spread in
the application of these methods in
various industries and research labora-
tories. The Physics Laboratory of the
University of Michigan has been an
active participant in these developments
since their beginning, as the technique
was introduced into the laboratory by
the writers in 1930. Refinements in
technique have made possible the at-
tainment of an accuracy of results that
makes of these methods a valuable tool
for research and for the control of the
production of materials and products.
Spectroscopic methods of analysis
have been found to be particularly ad-
vantageous in the determination of min-
ute traces of impurities in various solu-
tions, such as electro-plating baths, fine
chemicals and biological fluids. The
writers have recently completed the de-
velopment of the technique for the an-
alysis of caustic liquors (solutions of
caustic soda of high grade) for traces
of various metallic impurities. The
rayon industry is demanding purer caus-
tic liquor for use in the processing of
rayon. The purity demanded is so great
that analyses for some of the objection-
able elements can not be made with
sufficient accuracy by chemical meth-
ods. The spectroscopic method has been
found to be adequate, and a brief de-
scription of the procedure might be in-
teresting to industrial men as an illus-
tration of the application of spectro-
chemical analyses to solutions.
The principal problem in this appli-
cation was to develop a spectroscopic
source in which suitable spectral lines
of all of the test elements would be ex-
cited simultaneously and which would
be sufficiently sensitive to changes in
the amounts of the elements present.
The problem was not a simple one be-
cause the impurities are present in
amounts extremely minute in compari-
son with the amount of sodium hydrox-
ide. Since sodium is an element which
readily carries a current in an electric
discharge, its spectrum is one of the
easiest to excite. After trying several
sources suggested by our experience,
the high voltage alternating current arc
was found to be most suitable. This
source was developed in this laboratory
with the aid of a grant from the Rocke-
feller Foundation for the analysis of
biological fluids for sodium, potassium,
magnesium, and calcium; and has also
been employed in the analysis of urine
and body tissue for lead.
The source consists of an arc between
two electrodes of the highest grade
spectroscopic carbons upon the ends of
which a drop of the solution to be an-
alyzed has been evaporated. The car-
bon electrodes are cut into half-inch
lengths, and the ends are made smooth
and perpendicuar to the axis. The edges
are then rounded off slightly with a
clean file in order to prevent the arc
from striking the sharp edges, as it
must play upon the test material only
if the spectral lines are to have con-
stant relative intensities. A drop of the
specimen is transferred to the ends of
the carbons by a pyrex glass rod and
spread over the surface. Pyrex glass ii
used because caustic liquor readily at-
tacks ordinary glass and thus contami-
nations would be introduced. Usually,
the solution is dried on the carbons in
a drying oven, but any means of evap-
oration would be satisfactory.
The electrodes thus prepared are now
placed in position in spring clamps on
an arc stand. One of the clamps can be
moved by turning a screw by means of
an insulated handle. Care is taken not
to allow the electrodes to touch each
other as this might displace some of
the material. With the required voltage.
2,200 volts, applied to the arc gap, the
electrodes are brought together close
enough for the arc to strike. After
thirty seconds of operation, the circuit
is opened and the gap set by bringing
10

Equipment developed for factory installation.
the electrodes into contact and then
reversing the screw one full turn. The
operation of the arc causes the test
material to adhere to the carbons so
firmly that there is now no danger of
displacing it. One of the spring clamps
is designed to permit the electrode to
slide in it, so that when the electrodes
are brought together and separated, the
gap width is thus automatically ad-
justed. The arc is now ready for the
record exposures.
For exciting the arc, a S-kva 60-cycle
pole transformer, such as is used in city
current distribution, has been found con-
venient. Sufficient resistance is intro-
duced in series with the arc to limit
the current to 2.5 amperes. A bank of
ordinary cone type electric heater units
is satisfactory for this purpose, if a suffi-
cient number are used in combination
so that they are not strongly heated by
the current and their resistance conse-
quently changed. For accurate analysis,
the arc current must be kept constant
to within ±.05 amperes during the ex-
posure because the relative intensities
of the spectral lines change with the
amount of the arc current.
In order to make quantitative an-
alyses by spectroscopic methods, an-
alytical curves must first be determined.
The curves give the relationship be-
tween the amount of an element present
and the intensity of one of its spectral
lines relative to that of a control ele-
ment. The control element is introduced
into each specimen to be analyzed in
a definite amount. A series of solutions
is prepared in which the amounts of the
test elements are varied in a known
way, and from the spectra of these
prepared solutions the analytical curve
is determined. The relative intensities
of the spectral lines are measured by
standard methods of spectrophotometry.
The percentage ranges over which
caustic liquors have been analyzed are
as follows:
CaO
.000054—.005 %
MgO
.00006 —.0036%
SiO?
.001 —.1 %
A 1.0,
.0001 —.014 %
Cr
.000075—.01 %
Cu
.00001 —.005 %
Fe
.00001 —.1 %
Mn
.00001 —.00052%
Ni
000075—.01 %
Pb
.00002 —.0034 %
The ranges of analysis can be ex-
tended both to higher and to lower
percentages. The procedure for the an-
alysis of caustic liquor was developed
under the auspices of the Department
of Engineering Research for the Math-
ieson Alkali Works, Inc., and has been
installed in the plants of this company
at Niagara Falls and at Saltville, Vir-
ginia.
The method of analysis described
here for caustic liquor may be applied
to a great variety of solutions. In fact,
it has been found successful for an-
alyzing nickel plating solutions for
traces of impurities, as well as various
inorganic chemicals, pharmaceutical
chemicals and plastic materials. Saliva
and urine have been analyzed for Na,
K, Ca and Mg by a similar procedure
and the technique has just been per-
fected for the analysis of wine, bever-
ages, etc., as well as organic tissues for
lead. The percentage ranges over which
body fluids have been analyzed are as
follows:
Ca
.0005—.05%
Na
K
.01—1.0%
.05—1.0%
The abundance of lead can be de-
termined in amounts as low as .1 milli-
gram per liter. The same spectroscopic
source has likewise been successfully ap-
plied in the analysis of metallic alloys.
Carbon and graphitic products have also
been analyzed for metallic elements by
a modified method using the type of
source described above. Experience in-
dicates that this source and general pro-
cedure are capable of extremely wide
application.

Sales engineers have the highest average incomes.
/~"\\E hundred Michigan men—a ran-
dom representation of each of the
last ten classes—answered a recent em-
ployment questionnaire sent out by the
Technic. All departments except Mar-
ine Engineering were represented in the
returns.
A comparison of the average annual
incomes in the five departments (see
graph) showed that the Chemicals led
the Mechanicals by a small margin in
the race for the top honors while the
Aero's brought up the rear. Employ-
ment in the Aeronautical field has ap-
peared to be more scarce than in others,
and quite a few Aero's have found em-
ployment in some phase of Mechanical
Engineering.
A functional classification (see graph)
disclosed that Sales Engineers have the
highest average incomes followed closely
by those in the government service
which included direction of WPA proj-
ects, Highway Engineering and the
Forestry Service. The item production
includes in addition to actual produc-
tion work, those engaged in mainten-
ance and Industrial Engineering. Men
engaged in routine laboratory testing
and standardization had the lowest
average.
The graph also shows the effect on
income of changing employer. One or
two changes cause a drop in salary but
beyond this the curve rises. This prob-
ably can be explained by the fact that
only a few men fall into these classes
and one good salary affects the final
average disproportionately. The dotted
line on this graph represents the income

of those men who have taken formal
training courses given by the employer
subsequent to graduation. About 25%
of the graduates fall in this class. Sal-
aries for this group ran slightly lower
than those of men who started right in
working. It was of interest to note that
about 90% of the men taking training
courses remained with their original
employer.
On the graph there is also a compari-
son of annual incomes and collegiate
activities. Participation in a few or even
several activities has seemed to have
practically no effect on salaries. How-
ever, the men who were in almost

substantially higher incomes than the
rest of their classmates. It was found
that as far as this survey was concerned,
grade average made practically no dif-
ference. Within a small limit the plot
of income against grade average was a
horizontal line.
It must be remembered that only
the first three years of this study were
pre-depression. This fact is strikingly
brought out on the graph which shows
the average starting salary of each of
the classes. Note that except for the
jump in the 1934 average, these figures
follow closely the fluctuations of busi-

ness. The depression kept salaries of
the graduates from 1930 on from ris-
ing and many of the earlier men men-
tioned cuts flirting with the 50% mark.
Considering this fact, the averages
compiled here are quite creditable.
There has been a definite uptrend dur-
ing the last three years and despite the
current recession indications around
school are that this trend will continue.
The additional comments sent along
were as interesting as they were varied.
As a group, Michigan graduates weath-
ered the depression fairly well. Men
finishing during the worst times found
engineering employment far from plenti-
ful and resorted to varied occupations
ranging from real estate to a milk
route. One enterprising graduate started
and is still running a freight boat travel
bureau in Los Angeles. However, most
have now found employment in their
respective fields.
All were well satisfied with the train-
ing they received at Michigan although
several suggested that more stress be
laid on Economics and English. The
most general comment was that person-
ality and the ability to get along with
the people were the biggest factors in
success.

THERE are in America today thous-
ands of miles of road that are not
sufficiently traveled to justify paving
with concrete. For many years these
have been surfaced with bituminous ma-
terial and for many years motorists have
cursed the broken edges and holes that
seem to be an integral part of all bitu-
men highways.
As early as 1926 it occurred to engi-
neers that possibly cotton could be used
to extend the life of these roads. It
seemed that the inclusion of cotton fa-
bric might serve the same purpose it
does in automobile tires—that of bind-
ing the material together. At this time
an experimental stretch of road was
built which is still in good condition
today, but need for a solution to the
problem was not as acute then and ex-
perimentation lagged.
It was for a reason entirely removed
from bettering the condition of roads
that the experiments have been revived.
America has seen the world cotton mar-
ket slip through her fingers in the past
few years, and at the same time the
market has been cut at home by cheaper
prices for other types of cloth.
The depression served only to accent-
uate the rapidly growing plight of the
southern cotton farmer. The Depart-
ment of Agriculture began a search for
new uses of cotton fabric and decided
to revive highway experimentation.
They made $1,300,000 available to state
highway departments for furthering the
work. Today more than 600 miles of
bitumen road paved with a cotton fa-
bric base are in use in 35 states.
North Carolina and Alabama have
taken the lead with more than one hun-
dred miles each. Outside the cotton
producing south the leading states have
been Michigan and New York. The
cotton used in these highways has cost
from $450 to $800 a mile, with the extra
cost of applying the cotton running be-
tween $50 and $100 a mile.
It is widely believed that if the use
of cotton in bituminous highways be-
comes general, much of the South's
cotton problem might be solved. The
Department of Agriculture estimates
that there is a potential field of 13,000,-
000 bales for new work, which, when we
consider that the total crop in this coun-
try in 1935 was only 10,367,130 bales,
becomes quite a sizeable amount of cot-
ton. In addition the Department esti-
mates that as much as 400,000 bales
would be needed annually for resurfac-
ing old roads; this would mean nearly
a 40% increase in cotton consumption.
This new field for cotton then would
mean a great lifting of the burden rest-
ing on the tenant farmer.
However, it is not to be supposed
that motorists in general and highway
departments in particular are going to
include cotton in all secondary roads
merely out of sympathy for the plight
of the cotton farmer. They must be
convinced that it is financially to their
advantage to build such roads.
In placing cotton fabric in roads the
ground is first graded and a base ma-
terial is applied. This is covered with
a thin layer of bitumen; coarse cotton
fabric is then laid in longitudinal over-
lapping strips on the highway while this
layer is still sticky. When this has dried
thoroughly a layer of hot bitumen is
placed over the cotton and rolled so as
to impregnate the cotton with the sur-
facing material.
The cotton fabric has now become an
integral part of the highway; it is be-
lieved that this cotton fabric now has
somewhat the same effect as the mesh
of wires included in concrete roads. The
cotton should serve to bind the material,
prevent cracking and edging.
Although sufficient time has not as
yet elapsed for engineers to draw definite
conclusions from the experimental
stretches, it is evident that the cotton
does have at least some of the advan-
tages in practice that it has in theory.
Specimens of cotton impregnated road
appear to be standing up much better
than similar roads without the cotton.
Although one stretch did buckle in New
York during the winter of 1936, it stood
up much better than similar stretches
in the vicinity.

The first place to give way in a bi-
tuminous highway is along the edges
where material breaks off thus narrow-
ing the effective width of the road. This
difficulty, known as "edging," has been
one that for decades has remained prac-
tically unsolved. So far it is evident
that the inclusion of the cotton strips
so binds and strengthens the edges that
edging does not occur so rapidly nor
so badly. It is likely that this advan-
tage alone will suffice to reconcile mo-
torists to the idea of riding on cotton.
It is becoming evident that the in-
clusion of coarse cotton fabric in bi-
tuminous roads adds to their strength,
life, and smoothness. The question now
to solve is: Does this addition to the
quality of the roads justify the expendi-
ture of an extra five or six hundred
dollars per mile in their construction? If
the present tests prove the expense is
warranted by the results, then both a
vital engineering and a major social
problem can be solved simultaneously.

ENGINEERING EDUCATION AND
BUSINESS LEADERSHIP
Data on 54.000 officers of some typi-
cal industrial companies show that: "A
college trained man is 18 times as likely
to be president of an industrial com-
pany as is a non-college man. He is
12.5 times as likely to be treasurer,
twice as likely to be in charge of pro-
duction, 18 times as likely to be an
engineer, and 12 times as likely to be
a sales official. Taking all these officers
together, the college man is seven times
more likely than the noncollege to be
one of them.
"If we examine the influence of the
type of college in which the education
was secured, we find the following re-
sults which, at first glance, are decidely
startling. In one group we consider
those who were educated at an engineer-
ing or technical college, and in the other
group those who attended any other
type of college such as liberal arts, law,
business, and the like. Here we find that
an engineering college man is 12 times
more likely to be found in the presi-
dential position than if he had attended
a non-engineering college. He is 5

all offices together, an engineering col-
lege graduate is 30 times as likely to
find himself an officer in American
industry as is a graduate of a non-
engineering college."

Death has taken Dexter P. Cooper
at the age of 57. His name will always
be associated with the ill-fated Passama-
quoddy tidal power project to which he
gave so much time, energy and financial
aid.
In 1913, Dexter Cooper went to
Maine as general superintendent for the
Hydraulic Engineering Company. At
that time he had had five years of
engineering experience and six years of
engineering training at the Royal Poly-
technical School at Karlsruhe, Germany,
behind him.
It was while living in Maine that Mr.
Cooper became interested in the possi-
bility of developing power from the

great surge of tides through the narrow
channels along the Bay of Fundy near
Eastport, Maine.
In 1919 Cooper proposed a scheme
which would have cost $100,000,000.
The subsequent stages of this project
were a matter of great controversy
among engineers at the time. After 19
years of effort Cooper was forced to ac-
knowledge the impracticability of his
scheme. It is interesting to note that one
of the principle reasons for the ultimate
failure of this project was the improper
balance of economic factors involved.
CANADIAN ENGINEERS ARE

In Canada the professional societies
are all grouped into one major society
known as the Engineering Institute of
Canada.
At a recent meeting of this Institute it
was reported that membership had in-
creased from 4,213 to 4,536 and that
none of its members were unemployed.
This is very encouraging in the face of
the recent "recession."

DOUBLE LIFE
Most of us feel that being one's self
is sufficient, but Ed and Bill Chase look
at it a little differently. They live, as a
unit, the life they love. The double track
affair has been going on for quite a
while; ever since Mr. and Mrs. Chase
let the doctor in on it. Born and raised
in Grosse Pointe, these two dittoes fea-
tured athletically in football and base-
ball at Grosse Pointe High.
Dual impulse then guided them to the
University of Michigan, where they en-
rolled as Civil Engineers to be. Once
here these versatile Chases lost no time
in securing their freshman numerals in
hockey, and as any hockey fan could
tell you, both now have their well-
earned M's.
After their sophomore sessions, Ed
and Bill took a year off and spent it
gathering experience and wherewithal:
Bill with the Hudson Motor Company,
and Ed in a Detroit machine shop.
Then they cooperated in swelling the
present senior class. Both of them feel
that the year was well spent and came
back with a fuller realization of the
value of the days spent here.
Both of them are members of the
A.S.C.E. of which Bill is the present
treasurer. The two, who constantly
speak in terms of "we," are vitally in-
terested in the contracting business.
They were fortunate enough to secure
employment in this line last summer
and are pointing hopefully towards it
as a profession. If the "two brains are
better than one" adage carries any
weight, their Chase after success should
end triumphantly.
THE
BROTHERS YOUNG
We still have trouble telling the
Young brothers apart, so if you find
"Jack" where "Bob" should be in this
epistle, please forgive us.
The Young brothers are truly native
sons. They are born and raised in old
Ann Arbor; went to University High
where their high scholastic records and
interest in things in general gave promise
of a bright future for both of them.
They have certainly lived up to ex-
pectations in both scholarship and col-
lege activities. They are both members
of almost every important society to
which an engineer can belong. The list
includes Tau Beta Pi, Vulcans, Phi Eta
Sigma, Quarterdeck, Scabbard and
Blade and Triangles. In addition,
Jack has been on the Engineering
Council for two years, was Sophomore
Class Vice-President and Junior Class
Treasurer. Bob has also held his share
of offices. He was Secretary of the A.
S. M. E. student branch at Michigan in
his sophomore year, Vice President in
his junior year, and is President this
year.
We've often wondered how Bob and
Jack keep that healthy appearance—
flushed cheeks, fine physiques, et cetera.
It's probably due to their mutual in-
terest in athletics and the outdoor life.
In high school the boys were both out-
standing on the swimming and tennis
teams. Since enrolling in the University
they have dropped organized sports but
have pursued their outdoor interests by
joining up with Le Voyageurs, a local
society for men students interested in
boating, skating, swimming, fishing and
other outdoor sports.
Turning to their professional interests,
we find Bob and Jack enrolled in Michi-
gan's combined five year course in
Marine and Mechanical engineering.
Feeling the need of some practical ex-
perience to go with their academic
training, the brothers secured employ-
ment with a ship building concern in
Camden, New Jersey, in the summer
between their sophomore and junior
years. There the boys were employed
as ship-fitters' helpers and worked on
cruisers and destroyers being built for
the United States Navy.
On completion of their course in 1939
the boys hope to find employment in the
field of marine machinery design and
construction.

S.A.E. FORMS AT MICHIGAN
The newly formed S.A.E. student unit
has started out with a fine series of
meetings. Mr. William B. Stout of the
Stout Engineering Laboratories was the
first speaker of the second semester.
This meeting, which was well attended,
was exceedingly interesting, and it is
planned to have several more speakers
of this calibre through the spring. Sev-
eral field trips and motion pictures are
also planned.
The membership, which now totals
about 40, is increasing rapidly and it is
expected that additions from the Aero-
nautical and other departments will in-
crease the roll to 75 men. It is hoped
that Sophomores and Juniors who have
automotive interests will attend the
meetings.
The officers for the present year are:
William Fant, Chairman; Harold
Weckler, Vice Chairman in charge of
programs; and Larry O'Neil, Secretary
and Treasurer.
MICHIGAN ATOMS
Once again the University of Michi-
gan cyclotron will be heralded as the
largest in the world even though it be
instantaneous. For it is the nature of
science to plod forward towards larger
and finer discoveries and so, in this
field we find some smaller cyclotrons
being replaced by more powerful "neu-
tron guns" so that science may come
closer to reality of the inner structure
of matter.
\ short period ago the University
cyclotron was the largest in the world
which operated on a radio frequency
potential of about 20,000 volts and
derived an equivalent potential of ap-
proximately 7,000,000 volts. But in less
amput&gt;
A/ew&amp;
than a year it has been surpassed by
"neutron guns'' of like nature. So under
the direction of Professor Cork with
the assistance of Dr. Thornton the cyclo-
tron will be dissembled and enlarged and
it once more will be the world's largest.
When completed the radio frequency
potential will be increased to 30,000-
40,000, the vacuum chamber will
have a diameter of over 40 inches and
the equivalent potential will be within
the vicinity of 10,000,000-12,000,000
volts. But the Michigan cyclotron will
only enjoy the distinction of being the
largest in the world for a relatively short
period of time since the University of
California is constructing one which has
a magnet twice as large as the Michigan
one and a vacuum chamber of 50 inches
diameter. And so science marches for-
ward.
PROFESSOR RICGS
Dr. Henry E. Riggs, honorary pro-
fessor of civil engineering at the Uni-
versity, was elected president of the
American Society of Civil Engineers for
the year 1938. Though by education
and practice Dr. Riggs is essentially a
civil engineer, he is well known in the
electrical industry for his outstanding;
work in the valuation field. He has made
important studies on valuations of elec-
tric and gas properties, serving in a
consulting capacity for the state com-
missions of Michigan, Georgia, New
York, and has been retained by many
cities, corporations, and by U. S. courts.
He is the author of "Depreciation of
Public Utility Property" and of various
papers and articles in the technical
press. Professor Riggs is a member of
the Society for the Promotion of Engi-
neering Education and of other technical
associations.

THE
WIND TUNNEL
HELPS THE
FARMER
The windmill has been used for centuries as a source of power. It was
natural that, as the rural desire for radios, electric washers, refrigerators,
flat irons, and other electrical conveniences increased, the wind should be
called upon to supply the necessary power in those districts where central
station electricity is not available. The old style windmill did not prove as
satisfactory as the propeller for driving small generators. The development
of the proper size and shape of propeller for a given application was a re-
search job. The picture shows an experimental setup in the wind tunnel used
in such a development program.
This is an example of the application of the laboratory facilities of the
University to specific research problems.

Slide Rule Short Cut
'■' HE following is a simple method
■*• of obtaining the square root of the
sum or difference of two squares by
means of the slide rule.
The general equation Z=\'X--f-Y-
can be written Z=YV(—)"+! in
which form it can be solved quickly and
accurately on any slide rule having A,
B, C and D scales. For convenience
it is better to make the fraction —
y
greater than one; that is, always divide
the larger number under the radical by
the smaller, and place the smaller on the
outside.
To solve, divide X by Y on the C-and
D-scales the square of this quotient is
on the A-scale above the index on the
B-scale. Add 1 to this square by mov-
ing the slide to the right. The answer
can be read on the D-scale below on the
C-scale. (By the last step we have
taken the square root of (— )2+l and
have multiplied it by y.
For example let us solve \/35.3--)-20.6-
After dividing 35.3 by 20.6 on C and D
scales, read its square root 2.94, on the
A-scale above the index on the B-scale.
Move the slide to the right until the
B-scale index is below 3.94 (that is
2.94-|-l) on A-scale. Read the answer,
40.9, on the D-scale below 20.6 on the
C-scale.
Of course, when solving for the square
root of the difference of two squares it
is necessary to subtract one from the
fraction (—)- instead of adding it—
that is move the slide to the left instead
of to the right.
In the matter of signs there are four
possible combinations.
x'J+k,x+k..=o represents
(x+a) (x+b)=o; k,=a+b
x-'+k^—k._.=o represents
(x-fa) (x—b)=o; k^a—b
x-—k,x—k.,=o represents
(x-(-a) (x—b)=o; kL=b—a
x-— k,x-f-k..=o; represents
(x—a) (x—b)=o; k^a-l-b
From Civil Engineering, Feb., 1938
Solving Quadratics by Slide Rule
The following is a handy shortcut in
solving quadratics by means of the slide
rule.
All quadratic equations can be
brought into the form X- ± KjX ± K2=0,
by simple division. The equation can be
written (x+a) (x±b)=o. The prob-
lem is to find a and b; K;,=ab and
K,—a±b, which permits the solution
on any slide rule by placing the slide
over K. on the D-scale and adjusting
the C-scale until the sum of (or the dif-
ference between) the figure on the C-
scale under the slide and the figure on
the D-scale under the index of the
C-scale. A few trials are required—and
an engineer should be able to add (or
subtract) two figures mentally.
For example, solve the equation
X- + 7.8X+13.76=0. Place the slide
over the 13.76 on the D-scale. Move
the C-scale until the figure on the D-
scale under the index of the C-scale is
5.1, and the figure on the C-scale under
the slide is 2.7. Any other location of
the movable scale results in a sum other
than 7.8. The product must be 13.76
because of the position of the slide.

In 1855 the Bessemer process made steel available in large quantities
for the first time and paved the way for modern machinery and machine
tools. R B &amp; W, then ten years old, was in a position to contribute
substantially to the ensuing wonders of production and construction
by furnishing bolts, nuts and rivets necessary for the assembly of ma-
chines, structures and products.
Year by year since 1845, EMPIRE Brand Bolts, Nuts and Rivets
have been improved, as new materials, machines and methods — per-
fected and adopted by R B &amp; W—have made possible progressively
higher standards of strength, uniformity and accuracy.
R B &amp; VV manufacture a complete line of threaded, upset and punched
products including various types and finishes of Bolts, Nuts, Rivets,

"SOUPED" ENGINES FOR SIX-MILE
HEIGHTS
AS THE bellows is to the forge, so is the super-
charger to the airplane engine. Because of the
rarefied atmosphere at high elevations, airplane
engines require superchargers which operate like fan
blowers, maintaining air pressure in the engines and
permitting the motor to operate at normal efficiency.
f, twelve-hour flights from coast to coast at
rage height of six miles are the objective of
£rt airlines. Experiments in this field have
^ successfully conducted by Transcontinental
"Western Air. Inc., and the U.S. Army Air Corps
with very encouraging results, using G-E turbine-
driven superchargers.
Military, transport, racing, and transoceanic planes
are equipped with G-E superchargers which increase
motor efficiency, speed, and flying distance. The
superchargers were developed by Dr. S. A. Moss, of
General Electric and are built in the River Works in
Lynn, Mass. Student engineers on Test at Lynn
have an opportunity to inspect and test these devices
as a part of their training course.

BEATING SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES
WELL, not exactly swords into plowshares, but
rather discarded rails, superheaters, and boiler
tubes into steel for the overhead system of an
electrified railroad line. In this manner the old
steam railroad of the Witwatersrand Cold Mining
Area was replaced by a completely electrified
line.
Because of the rise in gold prices during the last
few years, an increased suburban passenger traffic in
that section of South Africa necessitated an enlarge-
ment of the railroad.
Mercury-arc rectifiers made by the British Thomson-
Houston Company, an affiliate of General Electric,
supply the power for the "Reef Scheme," as
it is called, while 115 four-motor, multiple-unit car
equipments were furnished by G.E. through the
International General Electric Company.
The engineering and sales work on this project was
done by several former G-E Test men. Many such
opportunities are open to graduates of college
engineering schools who have successfully completed
the G-E Test Course.

AMERICA'S OUTSTANDING YOUNG
ELECTRICAL ENGINEER
R. CHAUNCEY GUY SUITS, research physi-
cist of the General Electric Research Laboratory,
in Schenectady, has been named by Eta Kappa Nu,
honorary electrical engineering fraternity, as the
outstanding young electrical engineer for 1937.
Horn in Oshkosh. Wisconsin in 1905, Dr. Suits
graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1927
and from the Technische Ilochschule in Zurich,
Switzerland (Sc.D. "29). An ardent skier, he spends
most of his spare time on the snowy slopes around
upper New York State.
As a member of the Research Laboratory staff, his
work has been on the fundamentals of electric arcs,
showing how arc temperature can be measured bv
sound, and it was for this work that the Eta Kappa
Nu award was given him. Other activities for which
Dr. Suits is noted include the investigation of non-
linear circuits, high-pressure arcs, and the develop-
ment of automatic tuning for radio receivers.
Last year the award was given to Frank M. Starr,
U. of Colorado '28, G-E Test '29, who is employed in
the Central Station Engineering Department of
General Electric. The Test Course, of which Starr is
an alumnus, provides a practical education supple-
mentary to the theoretical knowledge obtained in

oF ENGWEEBING


WELDING is responsible for a majority of the streamliners now raring about the rountry.
Burlington's Zephyrs, the Boston &amp;• Maine's Flying Yankei all made of stainless steel—
anil tlie Pennsylvania's new super-electric locomotives, all owe their form anil much of their
efficiency to welding, Welding makes possible tremendous savings in weight without
sacrificing strength and rigidity.
Streamlining . . .
Demands smooth, unbroken surface and strong, light
frames—both attained by welding
STREAMLINING" is more than a
word to catch popular fancy and
assure sales. This design trend, in automo-
biles, trains, ships and a vast variety of
equipment items, has several extremely
sound reasons for existence. Smooth mass-
distribution and unbroken surfaces mean
ease of operation and savings in power
for moving objects. This smoothness of
design also results in easier handling of
portable objects, as well as cleanliness,
simplicity and efficiency.'
Streamlining involves the method of
construction, the theory behind the de-
sign. Streamlined articles are unit-built
of strong, light materials. The entire
product is designed to be one-piece and to
develop the maximum strength of each
individual member with the minimum of
added weight.
Welding is the most practical, least ex-
pensive and surest means of attaining
permanent strength in metal fabrication.
A welded article is a single unit when as-
sembled, and always remains so. There
are no mechanical joints to jolt, jar or
work loose with the passage of time.
Various members can be depended upon
to develop their full, assigned reactions
now or ten years from now. Welded con-
struction, therefore, means more than
adequate economy in design and con-
struction. It means confidence in the per-
manence and adequacy of the product.
Welding allows the designer to specify
any shape or combination ol shapes with-
out limitation. By welding, complex
forms can be built up from simple units.
Metal can be cut away or added. Projec-
tions, lugs, ears, rods, bars, any member
—can be added to the foundation. Dis-
similar metals can be joined. Long-wear-
ing or corrosion-resistant alloys can be
used to reinforce or build up at sections
subject to special wear or abrasion.
In fact, welding relieves the designer
of many limitations, of most ol he old
inhibitions and joint problems of old-
fashioned design. It makes possible the
fabrication of a better, more serviceable,
longer-lived product at lower cost. The
essential advantages of modern design
are obtained by welding with conve-
nience, economy and assurance.
This is a Business-News Advertisement _
I
The New Haven "Comet" uses cromansil
steel engine beds and car trucks, all welded.
Cromansil, a high-tensile mild-alloy steel con-
taining chromium, manganese and silicon, was
chosen as best for high-strength, rigid members.
Welding was specified because it develops the
full strength with minimum weight.
* * *
Stands for automatic vending machines are
now stronger, better, more permanent. They
used to be made by screwing lengths of 1 \?-
inch pipe into cast iron bases. They are now
bronze-welded at less cost with obvious im-
provement in strength, durability and ease of
fabrication.
* * *
Welding makes stainless steel beer barrels
practical. Strong, light, smooth inside and out,
these barrels have no crevices or corners in
which fungi and bacteria can breed. Welding
makes them all one-piece and prevents bacterial
and mold action and chemical off-tastes. Fur-
ther, because of welding, they outlast all others.
* * *
Welding produces gas-operated refrigerators
at a reasonable production cost. After making
exhaustive tests involving every method of
fabrication possible, the manufacturer stand-
ardized on welding 100 per cent. Results in-
clude a better product, more flexibility in
design and lower manufacturing costs.
* * *
Welding makes modern metal furniture pro-
duction possible. Faced with tremendous com-
petition, this new industry capitalized the ad-
vantages of welding in the production of light,
strong, modern designs and has grown to a
sound and healthy state. Welding in this case
means mobility in design as well.
* * *
Every day welding is being used in the pro-
duction of different articles. For instance, an
or&lt;ler was recently received for 2000 window
display fixtures. Welding was specified because
welding permits any design, gives neat appear-
ance and a strong sturdy assembly at low cost.

Tomorrow's engineers will be expected
to know bow to take advantage of this
modern metalworking process. Many
valuable booklets describing the ox&gt;-
acetylene process are available without
obligation. For further information write

OOLQU
Toundation

by
WALTON A. RODGER, '39E
FOR a number of years past, the ad-
ministration of the engineering col-
lege has been faced with a number of
perplexing problems. Ever-increasing en-
rollment, both graduate and undergrad-
uate, has made imperative the expan-
sion of both the staff and the equipment
of the Engineering College.
During the last ten years, the enroll-
ment of this college has nearly doubled
in spite of high scholastic entrance re-
quirements. More important still is the
increase in the number of graduate stu-
dents. The cost per student hour for
graduate work is several times that of
undergraduate instruction, both in money
and in instructor-time. Yet this latter
phase of the school's activity is by far
the most productive from an economic
standpoint.
This increased load has been handled,
because of budget limitations, with a
fixed faculty and existing equipment. As
a result certain established practices of
value, such as intimate contact between
student and teacher, may soon have to

be abandoned. The point has been
reached where the staff must be mate-
rially augmented if we wish to maintain
Michigan's high standards of quality
and efficiency in instruction.
It is recognized that the University is
unable to compete with industry on an
even salary basis. Furthermore, over-
loads in teaching assignments, restricted
research space and equipment with
which to work, and materially higher
salary scales adopted by other institu-
tions, have caused some of our best
teaching talent to accept positions at
other schools. If the quality of our staff
is to be maintained, increased support
must be forthcoming.
Recent allotments for repair and mod-
ernization have not kept pace with our
progress. Consequently, our laboratory
equipment needs to be increased and
there is need for equipment demonstrat-
ing the latest developments in the vari-
ous engineering fields.
In view of these basic needs, it is ob-
vious that state appropriations should
be supplemented with funds from other
sources if the College of Engineering is
to maintain its place as one of the lead-
ers among technical schools. Accord-
ingly, the Standing and Executive Com-
mittees recommended, and the Board of
Regents approved the formation of the
Mortimer E. Cooley Foundation, with
the following objectives:
(a) To build up a strong faculty
for undergraduate teaching together
with proper physical facilities.
(b) To encourage, in a constructive
and sympathetic manner, graduate work
and provide teachers of outstanding
ability together with adequate facilities.
(c) To encourage fundamental and
applied research by all members of the
faculty and provide them with the nec-
essary space and equipment.
(d) To enable the College of Engi-
neering to turn out men even better
fitted to take their places as leaders in
the field of engineering.
Specifically, the immediate aims of
the Foundation are the construction of
two new buildings, the purchase of new
equipment and the establishment of an
endowment. These expenditures, run-
ning in the neighborhood of two million
dollars, would give better facilities for
the study of air conditioning, Diesel de-
sign, automotive studies, electrical engi-
neering and electronics and would re-
lease more space for the use of other
departments. The completion of these
plans would entail the complete de-
struction of East Hall and the Engi-
neering Annex, events to be contem-
plated with relish by engineers. A unit
similar to East Engineering Building
would take the place of East Hall and
a portion of the proposed West Engi-
neering Quadrangle would be completed.
The culmination of the above plans
would be a fitting tribute to the Grand
Old Man of the Engine School, who has
been so intimately connected with the
progress of this school for nearly fifty
years. The support of every Michigan
engineer is merited.

THE STORY OF MODERN NAVIGATION
by
PROFESSOR L. A. BAIER
Lieutenant, USNR
"PROM the dawn of history to the
*• days of Columbus, no ship ven-
tured out of sight of land, for they
dared not sail the open sea. Until the
turn of the twentieth century, the com-
pass and the chronometer, an American
invention, made crude navigation possi-
ble. However, even forty years ago
many a ship was lost at sea.
Today, engineers have given naviga-
tors improved instruments and ingenious
devices which at last make accurate the
two fundamental methods of navigation.
The first method, piloting, depends
upon definite contact with fixed land-
marks. The second method, necessary
when off-shore, is called celo-navigation,
and utilizes celestial observations. Ob-
viously, when fixed marks are available
and frequent, piloting results in exact
determination of position, with corres-
ponding confidence in proposed courses
and distances. On the other hand, while
the position at sea can be plotted with
almost equal exactness when conditions
are favorable, there are many intervals
when clouds prevent observations, and
the estimate of position must rely on
dead reckoning from the last "fix." The
horizon is generally only visible from
dawn until twilight, and atmospheric
conditions during the day may also give
doubtful altitudes at times.
Since the number of vessels and the

navigational hazards are much greater
in the regions where piloting is in use,
it is natural to find engineers concen-
trating on the improvement of piloting
aids. Many of these new aids have ex-
tended the field of piloting operations
farther and farther from shore with the
result that the zone of navigation de-
pendent on celestial observations has
been continuously narrowed.
PILOTING
The essential tools of the pilot are
the compass for determining direction;
the patent log or the revolution counter
of the engines for measuring distance
traveled; the sounding lead for obtain-
ing the depth of water and character of
bottom; detailed charts; tide and cur-
rent tables; light lists; sailing direc-
tions; pelorus or radio direction finder
for taking bearings; submarine signal
detector; a clock for recording time
and a stop watch for measuring time
intervals; and, on naval vessels, a range
finder for estimating the distance in
yards to a visible mark.
All ships are still equipped with the
time-honored compass, improved how-
ever, by refinements in construction for
ease of reading and compensation.
Courses and bearings must still be
corrected for magnetic variation, which
depends on the ship's position, and for
deviation which varies with the ship's
heading. In addition, many modern ves-
sels install gyro compasses which are
independent of the earth's magnetic
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


trolled. Another distinct advantage of
the gyro is that repeaters, operated by
the master gyro, can be installed in
various convenient locations for use in
taking bearings. The gyro compass is
also used to control the steering gear
be means of the now familiar "Metal
Mike," resulting in much steadier steer-
ing. A recorder in addition gives a per-
manent record of all courses followed.
The old-fashioned sounding lead has
been supplemented by automatic de-
vices which give almost continuous
readings without reducing the ship's
speed. These are of two types. In water
less than 40 fathoms deep, the "Angle
of Reflection Method" measures the an-
gle of incidence by which a sound wave
transmitted from the ship's bottom is
reflected back from the ocean bottom
to a receiver located a known distance
from the transmitter. The other method
used in depths greater than 20 fathoms
measures the time interval required for
a sound wave from the ship to reach the
sea bottom and be echoed back.
Visual aids to navigation include
buoys, light houses, light ships, channel
range marks, and beacons. Prominent
landmarks useful to vessels are shown
on the charts and described in the Sail-
ing Directions. Buoys are used to mark
channels, shoals, turns, obstructions,
and anchorages, and are characterized
by individual types, shapes, colors,
lights, and numbers. Light houses are
located in prominent positions, and
serve to identify themselves by their
shape, and the color and character of
light. Often the light shows red sectors
which cover shoals or definite bearings.
Light ships are used to mark junctions
or shoals where construction of light
houses is not feasible.
Supplementing their visual functions,
the light houses, ships, and buoys are,
in many cases, equipped with devices to
conquer the menace of fog. Submarine
sound signals are transmitted; bells,
horns, whistles—all with individual
characteristics—are used to identify the
station and locate the vessel feeling her
way through thick weather. Certain key
light houses and ships are fitted with
radio beams and individual radio sig-
nals. Sound and radio signals are trans-
mitted at the same instant. The ship
receiving these signals can get the sta-
tion's bearing by means of a radio
direction finder or submarine signal set,

possible.

and by noting the time interval between
receipt of the sound signal and the
radio signal, also determine the distance
from the station.
The radio beacon is so accurate, in
fact, that in recent years, several light
ships on the Atlantic coast have been
rammed and sunk by vessels following
the radio beacon in fog so dense that
they were unable to see the lightship
before striking it.
A very interesting! device recently
developed is the fog camera. By means
of infra-red film the camera records
pictures through fog about four times
denser than the visibility limit of the
naked eye. The film, which is continu-
ous, is developed in the same machine
immediately and the operator within
30 seconds can view in the finder a
picture which reveals what lies in the
fog blanket ahead.
CELO-NAVIGATION
In the past when a vessel left sound-
ings all contact with shore was lost until
the lead again struck bottom when ap-
proaching the coast at the end of the
voyage. Even though three high grade
chronometers were carried and their
rates carefully logged, time was the
principal doubtful factor in off-shore
navigation. Today powerful radio sta-
tions transmit accurate time signals to
ships in most parts of the world. Radio
Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Co.
beams and direction finders make land-
falls exact by reaching out many miles
off-shore to the aid of incoming vessels.
The modern method of locating the
position of a vessel at sea is briefly as
follows: a single altitude measurement
of a known heavenly body can be solved
to define a circular trace on the earth's
surface, the center of this circle being
that spot where the body is directly
overhead. From any point on the circle
the altitude of the body is constant and
if the navigator has observed this alti-
tude, the vessel must be somewhere on
the circle. If, in addition, an accurate
bearing of the body could be obtained,
it would then be possible to fix the ves-
sel's position on the circle. Since ac-
curate azimuths are difficult to measure,
however, the altitude of another hea-
venly body is taken simultaneously,
and a second circle of position traced on
the chart. The intersection of the two
circular traces then fixes the vessel's
position.
More than most of us realize, the
safety of passengers and cargo at sea
rests in the hands of the engineer.
Modern navigation is an achievement
not only of marine engineers, but also
of the electrical, chemical, and mechani-
cal engineers who perfected the instru-
ments which surely and safely, through
storm and fog, guide the ships of the
world to their harbors.

Paint*
by
J. C. BRIER
D. F. BOUCHER
IN ALL research work dealing with
the drying of the oil type paints and
varnishes, and particularly in the study
of the various drying and semi-drying
oils with respect to adaptability for use
in some types of protective coatings,
one of the most important, and in many
cases, perhaps the most important varia-
ble that is to be evaluated is the time
required for the paint film to become
transformed from the liquid to the solid
state.
It is evident that this time factor
is important when one realizes that
during the transformation from liquid
to solid there is a period at which the
protective coating is exceedingly sticky,
which is sometimes called the "sticky
flypaper" stage. The most universal
method for determining the end of this
latter period has been manual, obser-
vations having been obtained by simply
touching with the finger and this period
is often expressed as "dry to touch".
While this method may be entirely ade-
quate from many practical points of
view it is, nevertheless, too erratic and
too dependent upon individual observers
to be used, particularly in those cases
where quantitative evaluation is impera-
tive as is the case in research work.
For a number of years in our Paint
Laboratory, research has been in pro-
cess studying the use of some of the
so-called "semi-drying" and "near-
drying" oils, particularly the treatment
of soy bean oil. Inadequacy of methods
of determining drying end points led
to a study of methods of developing
such a test which would be accurate
and capable of being repeated.
There have been developed, in the
past, several so-called drying-time me-
ters, the most successful of which has
been the Sanderson drying time meter.
The principle of this machine is quite
simple and follows:
A disc about the size of a Victrola
record is coated with the paint or oil
film to be tested and slowly revolved.
Fine sand is allowed to flow on to this
disc from a cone and makes a path
similar to that made by the needle on
the Victrola record as it is played. When
the film is dry the same will not stick.
By simply shaking or brushing off the
sand after the film is dry the point
at which adherence ceased is easily
computed. The particular disadvantage
of this machine is the fact that only one
film may be tested at a time, and there-
fore, in making comparative studies, it
is necessary to have as many of the
machines as there are films to be tested.
A little over a year ago we started,
here in the laboratory, to develop a
modification of this equipment. During
the last summer our machine was
finished and during the last semester
research was undertaken involving the
use of the machine. We have chosen
to call this drying time meter the "drum
paint drying time machine," the princi-
ple of which is very simple.

Operating and Construction details.
As can be seen from the accompany-
ing photograph, the machine consists of
a hollow, cylindrical steel drum mounted
on a horizontal shaft which is in turn
supported by bearings mounted on
wooden blocks. A framework of angle
iron supports the bearings for a second
horizontal shaft mounted above the
drum. The purpose of this shaft is to
support and motivate the sand cones.
One end of this shaft is threaded with
a % inch pitch thread, and the corres-
ponding bearing is tapped so that the
shaft moves Y$ inch in a direction paral-
lel to its own axis for each revolution
that it makes. This shaft is motivated
through a pulley which transmits its
motion to the shaft through a key which
slides in a long keyway cut in the shaft.
The cones are supported by the shaft
through sheet metal straps which en-
circle the shaft but do not bind. The
displacement motion is obtained by the
use of collars fastened on the shaft.
The cones are prevented from swaying
in any direction by a pair of long,
narrow steel strips, to which each of
the straps is securely bolted, and one of
which runs through slots cut in metal
bars fastened at either end of the frame.
The cones themselves are fabricated
of galvanized sheet metal. A conical
shaped brass collar with an external
thread is soldered on to the tip of each
cone. A small brass cap with a single
hole drilled in its center, to allow pas-
sage of the sand, is screwed on to the
collar. This construction allows the use
of various sized openings in the cones,
whereby sand of varying degrees of
fineness may be used.
Three electromagnets, operating on
alternating current, and hooked up
through a timing device, are used to
vibrate one of the bars to which the
cones are bolted. This vibration occurs
once a minute and is of about one
second's duration and the sand flows
from the nozzles only during this one
second. The electrical layout consists
of two circuits, a 6 volt direct current
circuit and a 110 volt alternating cur-
rent circuit. The 6 volt circuit energizes
a relay which closes the 110 volt circuit
causing the electromagnets to vibrate.
The 6 volt circuit, which passes through
the second hand of an especially wired
electric clock, is only closed however
when the second hand makes contact
with a small silver plated steel spring.
This, of course, occurs once a minute.
The paint is applied on to a strip of
sheet metal 5% inches wide and about
45 inches long. This strip is then
wrapped around the drum and the ends
hooked into a slot which is Y\ inch
wide and runs lengthwise of the drum.
The machine can accommodate six of
these samples at one time. The drum is
geared down to make one revolution an
hour, and the upper shaft makes two
revolutions for every revolution of the
drum, which results in a spiral trail of
sand on the painted strip with Y\ of an
inch separating each successive spiral.
When the strip is removed from the
drum, these sand trails are simply
straight lines. The trail consists of small
deposits of sand about Ys inch apart.
The machine can operate continuously
for 23 hours. In case 23 hours is in-
sufficient to obtain the drying time of a
paint, duplicate samples may be pre-
pared and at the end of 23 hours the
first sample is removed and the second
one substituted. The machine is then
reset and the test may be continued up
to 46 hours. The metal strips may be
used over and over since the paint can
be very easily removed with a solvent
such as amyl acetate.
These readings are obtained in the
following manner: After the run is com-
pleted the painted strip is removed, in-
verted, and tapped sharply. The sand
that still adheres after this treatment
indicates the "dry point" of the paint.
Next the panel is lightly and uniformly
brushed with a small camel hair brush.
The sand that remains after this brush-
ing indicates the "dust free" time. Fol-
lowing this the panel is vigorously
scrubbed with a soft cloth. The sand
that adheres after this treatment is the
sand that is firmly imbedded in the
paint and the end point thereby ob-
tained is called the "dry to touch" time.
These points probably do not corre-
spond to those obtained on other drying-
time meters, but the results are very
valuable when used in a comparative
manner. The readings should be taken
within an hour or two of the completion
of the test.
The principal difficulties encountered
in the use of this machine to date are

PHYSICISTS are once more bewil-
dered as to whether there are any
undiscovered electrons or beta-particles
(high speed electrons). During the
month of December, four days before
the meeting of the American Society
for Advancement of Science met at
Indianapolis, Dr. G. E. M. Jauncey of
the University of Washington at St.
Louis, Mo. claimed to have discovered
by means of the classical experiment
that electrons have different masses. So
the energies of the entire physics staff
were directed towards the verification
of his observations and results. At pres-
ent, electrons are considered to have
only one mass (since the Physical So-
ciety has not accepted his results offi-
cially); but if his experiments and
observations are correct, this means

that we will have to change our whole
conception of the nature of matter.
Meanwhile the news of the discovery
had leaked out of St. Louis, and all the
members of the society at Indianapolis
desired to hear from G. E. M. Jauncey.
Since the program was already com-
plete, the only alternative was to have
an extra session after the regular meet-
ing was concluded.
The officers of the society did not
fancy the idea of having the paper
presented on such short notice, for, if
the content later proved inaccurate, the
society's conduct would appear most
displeasing in the eyes of European
investigators. But the members wanted
to hear—and they did! The society had
previously read about experiments simi-
lar to those of Jauncey's which were
performed last year at the Uni-
versity of Michigan by Dr.
Zahn to study the existence of
such heavy electrons, but his
results turned out negative. So
Dr. Zahn received a telegram
from the Society requesting his
presence at the meeting in or-
der that he may present the
opposite view. And at the con-
clusion of the meeting of both
parties, Dr. Compton, of Chi-
cago University, a Nobel prize
winner in physics, stated that
Dr. Jauncey's presentation ex-
emplified an excellent piece of
scientific research but did not
confirm the results.
As the result of some preliminary
experiments by Dr. Crane's group, it
was thought possible that the beta-
particles resulting from the disintegra-
tion of radio-active substances might
be heavier than normal; as a conse-
quence, it might be possible to disprove
one of the long standing paradoxes of
the theory of radio-activity. The para-
dox is as follows: according to the
quantum theory, it is to be expected
that when a radio-active atom disinte-
grates and is transformed into another
atom, a definite fixed quantity of energy
is released. For the transformations in
which a beta-ray is given off, however,
the energy of the beta-ray is not a fixed
definite quantity but has values varying
from zero to fixed upper limits. For the
transformation giving rise to the lower
energy level, it would seem that some
of the full disintegration energy is lost
in some way. The principle of conser-
vation of energy is violated since there
is only one particle released during this
disintegration process. In order to ex-
plain this difficulty, it was assumed by
the physicists, Pauli and Fermi, that a
hypothetical, but at present unobserva-
ble, particle (called the neutrino) is
emitted at the same time as the beta-
particle and carries away with it the
energy and momentum which would be
lost if there were not such a particle.
These considerations, however, are
based on calculations which assume that
all the beta-particles are ordinary elec-
trons, having masses according to the
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


masses are not all normal, there is a
possibility of explaining the difficulty
without the necessity of assuming the
existence of this unobservable particle.
Under these circumstances it can be
calculated that the masses of the beta-
particles of the lowest velocity should
be about three times the normal value.
It should be relatively easy to detect
such heavy masses by direct deflection
experiments in the electric and magnetic
fields. Such experiments were carried out
by Dr. Zahn and Mr. H. A. Spees and
particular chosen velocity, for which the
it was found that the electrons had a
masses should have been twice the nor-
mal value, but the observed mass was
perfectly normal. Therefore these ex-
periments show that this type of heavy
electron was excluded.
Dr. Zahn's experiments were per-
formed by a new type of apparatus
which was designed so that some un-
certainties of the older method were
largely eliminated. These uncertainties
have to do with the possibility of scat-
tered electrons leaking through the
velocity filters of the apparatus, and
producing false results. In the older
type of experiments performed by the
German physicists, Bucherer and Neu-
mann, in order to measure the mass of
the electrons at various velocities and
test the theory of relativity, they se-
lected a particular velocity from the
spectrum of a radio-active substance by
letting the particle enter the space be-
tween the plates of a very shallow
electric condenser and, at the same time,
superimposing a magnetic field in the
space around the condenser. After leav-
ing the condenser, their momentum
could be measured by measuring the de-
flection they underwent in the magnetic
field alone. Hence, knowing the momen-
tum and the velocity, they could cal-
culate the mass.
Dr. Zahn's method consisted, in a
certain sense, of a reversal of the old,
classical experiment, in that the momen-
tum of the electrons was selected first
and then the velocity was measured. This
modification presents a number of ad-
vantages over the older method, chief
among which is that the uncertainty
and difficulties concerning scattering
are practically eliminated. As a result
of calculations, Dr. Zahn and Mr. Spees
had discovered that the usually accepted
experimental interpretations of the

Michigan's million volt equipment speeds up nuclear research.
classical experiments on the relativistic
variation of electron mass are subject
to serious criticism, since the velocity
filter could not have been selecting a
narrow band of velocities, as was sup-
posed. Besides, if there is a possibility
of scattering, the errors which may be
introduced are intensified. And since it
is difficult to determine how much
scattering occurs, it is equally hard to
give a satisfactory interpretation of
these classical results.
These calculations of Dr. Zahn and
Mr. Spees do not prove that the theory
of relativity is wrong, but only show
that the simple, accepted interpretation
of the previous experiments is not justi-
fiable.
Dr. Jauncey's old colleague, Nobel
Laureate Arthur Compton, who was
present at the Indianapolis meeting,
studied Jauncey's experiments and de-
clared that it was an excellent piece of
scientific work. Of late, however, in a
recent article which appeared in the
Physical Review titled "An Alternative
Interpretation of Jauncey's 'Heavy
Electron' Spectra," Dr. Compton re-
marked that some electrons, before
entering the velocity selector, might
bounce off a plate and pass on with
diminished energy, thus producing a
false record. His action came only after
a period of deliberation—much unlike
the action of G. E. M. Jauncey—and a
personal visit to the University of
Michigan to verify the observations and
conclusions of Dr. Zahn's experiments.
Thus science is in a period of watch-
ful waiting, and, if the Physical Society
confirms officially the results of Dr. G.
E. M. Jauncey, it means that the entire
concept of matter will be changed. But
if Dr. Zahn's negative results prove
satisfactory, we will be one step further
from delusion.

■^ ^ upon graduation as engineers do
not seem to realize fully the definite
requirements necessary for them to at-
tain their proper place in industry. This
is typical of the graduates of most col-
leges judging by the results of personal
interviews with several hundred appli-
cants and close association with the suc-
cessful candidates over a period of years.
If we can agree to accept these state-
ments as facts, it is only natural to as-
sume that there exists the need for a
better understanding of some of the
more important qualifications that may
make or break a young graduate engi-
neer during the early stages of his cam-
paign to "conquer the world."
To describe all the qualifications that
have a bearing on success would be an
unending task so we will confine our
efforts to those which, in the majority
of cases, we find conspicuous by their
absence. We will not describe them
independently because they are asso-
ciated with each other so closely that
separate consideration is practically
impossible.
THINK! DECIDE! PLAN! ACT!
Reads like a four-act drama. Supple-
ment it with a few traits such as:
Personality, Appearance, Fairness, Ex-
actness, Initiative, Stick-to-it-iveness,
Patience, Faith in Yourself, and you
have a "play" that may be called, for
want of a better name, "Salesmanship."
There are so many opportunities you
may take advantage of without harm
to your ultimate future that it is never
too early to start planning. You may
discuss the possible courses with your
friends and relatives, your professors, or
even your school associates. During
summers, you may secure employment
in one of the industries you are consider-
ing and thereby get first-hand informa-
tion.
"It is difficult to attempt to make
specific recommendations as to the par-
ticular courses that should be taken
during your formal education. In the
event metallurgy is the field you choose,
a broad training in the fundamental
sciences of chemistry, physics, mathe-
matics and mineralogy, is necessary,
with as many courses in metallurgy as
the particular school offers.
As early as possible, compatible with
your financial condition, it is advisable
to associate yourself with one or more
of the recognized technical societies.
This can generally be accomplished by
taking out a Junior Membership. In
this way, you avail yourself of the bene-
fits of the publications that go with
such a membership, as well as the con-
tact with older and recognized leaders
in your particular field.
In order to keep abreast of develop-
ments, devote some of your spare time
to reading the current trade and techni-
cal magazines, such as "Metals and Al-
loys," "Steel," and "Iron Age," as well
as the journals of societies associated
with the industry—the American Society
for Metals, the Society for Automotive
Engineers, the American Institute of
Mining and Metallurgical Engineers,
and the like.
By the time your college curriculum
is completed, you should have a pretty
fair idea of the industries and particu-

time you are ready to embark. Have
courage; here is the opportunity to ac-
quire something you will need all
through life—the ability to stick to a
decision until you see it through. If
the job of your choice is not available,
don't give up—take any job—one sell-
ing carpet sweepers, household brushes,
or the like. The experience gained in
ringing doorbells will come in handy
later when the real job of selling your-
self in the field of your choice is at
hand. By all means, do not allow your
plans to be changed and embark on
what, at the moment, may look like
the best just because there is nothing
available in the line of your choice.
Eventually, the time will arrive and
you will be ready to step into the em-
ployment that you have planned for.
Regardless of the industry, there will
be several companies that are outstand-
ing and your first decision should be,
which one can offer the best oppor-
tunity, not at the immediate time, but
over the long pull. Too many graduates
are influenced by seemingly better im-
mediate working conditions—shorter or
all-daylight hours or possibility of a
few dollars more income—and not what
the morrow holds in store for them.
Here is another chance to practice
stick-to-it-iveness.
You are now ready for your first
important assignment, selling yourself to
the company of your choice.
After the proper contact has been
arranged, present yourself for an inter-
view, if at all possible. Be sure that
your appearance is not to be questioned
and, above all, wear a smile. State your
case briefly but not bashfully and, by
all means, in such a way that the per-
son you contact will not be limited in
his available openings that would be of
interest to you. In short, if you keep
your foot in the door up to this time,
you are a success.
Granting that you have been success-
ful in securing employment, you should
make an effort to acclimate yourself
to the new surroundings and associates.
A large number of these co-workers will
not be college-trained and it may even
be advisable to refrain as much as pos-
sible from any reference to your back-
ground. The problem is to be sure that
all are at ease in your presence. With

this accomplished, others will consider
it a pleasure to learn of your education
from an independent source.
Be friendly. Cultivate the friendship
of all you contact; friendly people be-
come successful leaders. Even the most
humble can be of help on some occa-
sions, and there is no measure of the
value of friendship.
Work hard. Tackle the hardest job
first each day. Do all that is assigned
to you as well as you can, if possible,
better than any other person having
the same assignment. There is a sense
of satisfaction in doing one's work well.
After you have made an honest effort
to solve a problem and failed, do not
hesitate to acknowledge defeat rather
than try to bluff it through. Bluffing
only pyramids the necessity for more
bluffing. Likewise, always admit your
mistakes. The other fellow is very sel-
dom prepared for such an admission,
but is always prepared for an alibi. It
takes a big man to admit he is wrong.
Don't give up easily. Find a way out
—"He can who thinks he can." So many
seem to fall gradually into a land of
forgetfulness. They do not know how
to help themselves or where to go for
help when things are not progressing
as they should. This "sickness" (as we
might term it) is generally missing if
one is successful in making friends.
Always remember that as we progress
in importance the competition for fur-
ther advancement rapidly decreases.
What more incentive should be neces-
sary?
This should not be considered a text
on "How to Get Along". To ignore it
entirely would not mean failure—suc-
cess can be accomplished by other
means. However, it is a resume of what
we have found in many of those around
us who have achieved success.

THE ENGINEER GOES TO HOLLYWOOD
by
J. ANDERSON ASHBURN. '40E
OlNCE that memorable day in 1897
^ when Thomas A. Edison filmed a
32 second reenactment of the execution
of Mary, Queen of Scots, all filmdom
has been striving for three things:
color, sound, and depth.
The first and third of these were the
subject of much experimentation from
the early days of the "flickers," but it
was sound that was first put into uni-
versal use. In 1928 every theatre was
transformed almost overnight from
silence to sound, and the man who read
the titles aloud was relegated to the
limbo of forgotten nuisances.

Electrical Engineering
Technicolor immediately brings Disney to mind.
In the early twenties films were pro-
duced which had the illusion of depth.
Two exposures were made with cameras
several feet apart. One picture was
tinted blue, and the other red. By com-
bining the two on one film and looking
at the projected image with a pair of
glasses having one red and one blue
lens, the third dimension was produced.
But this type of film proved impractical
and soon the third dimension dropped
out of the public eye.
The remaining objective, that of
color, has always seemed the most
promising, but it has been the slowest
in developing. This is because of an
inherent difference in sound and color.
Color films can be projected with no
radical changes in equipment. In sound,
on the other hand, since different pro-
jector speeds are used and totally differ-
ent equipment, it was whole hog or none
—adopting sound meant scrapping al-
most all existing equipment, and once
the change was made there was no re-
turning to the silent films. That was
the reason for the almost miraculous
advent of sound pictures.
From the very early days films were
tinted to produce certain effects: blue
for night scenes, red for fire scenes, etc.
As early as 1908 a color process called
Kinemacolor was introduced in Europe.
In 1918 Prizma, another method,
created a temporary fad in American
movies.
Color processes can be divided into
two general classes: additive and sub-
tractive. All of the early methods were
of an additive nature. Typical of these
was the Keller-Dorian process. The film
was heat-pressed into 724 horizontal
lenses per inch. The light was broken
up by a special filter and recorded on
this film. These images were developed
in black and white, but when projected
through another set of filters the color
was added and a reasonably fair repro-
duction projected on the screen.
There were two general additive color
methods. One in which the filters were
also included in the film base (for exam-
ple Dufaycolor) which obviated changes
in the projection lenses but added appre-
ciably to the cost of the film, and the
other in which the filters were apart
from the film (for example Kodacolor).
Although when developed these meth-
ods were widely hailed and many pic-
tures made using them, all who saw
the films had to admit that this was not
a satisfactory solution. Here was color,
but here was not natural color. Further-
more, all additive processes required a
great deal more light, both for exposure
and projection, and in many cases in-
terior shots were almost impossible.

possible except on bright, sunny days.
Nevertheless, the Kodacolor method was
made available to amateurs and was
widely used by them from 1928 to 1935.
Meanwhile, the subtractive color pro-
cess had been invented. In this method
the film itself is colored by the use of
dyes, and as white light is projected
through the film all but the desired
colors are subtracted from the beam.
This process, known as Technicolor,
appeared in the late twenties and mil-
lions of dollars were spent on publicity
buildups. Typical of this extravagance
was a series of double page advertise-
ments in the Saturday Evening Post.
But at that time Technicolor was as
bad or worse than the additive methods.
Two separate pictures were taken,
colored, and then put together in one
film. This gave these two colors and any
combination of them, but no more. The
inadequacy of such a system is obvious.
Several two-color Technicolor pictures
were made, but they didn't meet with
much success and by 1930 color was out
again.
Having spent more money on adver-
tising campaigns than on technical de-
velopments, the color companies were
on the verge of bankruptcy. However,
they still had faith in Technicolor and
determined to try once more. Reversing
the policy followed throughout the tur-
bulent history of color, they renounced
all publicity and spent four years in
perfecting the color process.
The three-color Technicolor was de-
veloped. After the light has passed
through the lens it strikes a gold flecked
mirror placed at a 45 degree angle. This
permits one ray to continue straight on
through a filter where it strikes the
green sensitive negative, while at the
same time it reflects an identical ray
at right angles through a magenta filter
after which it strikes first the blue sen-
sitive negative and then the red sensitive
negative. Each negative is developed
and from each one a positive relief is
made. This matrix, as it is called, is
used to print (in the sense that a news-
paper is printed) the positive film used
in projection. This is done by using
the matrix as a plate and special dyes
as inks.
When in 1933 the process was ready
to market, the Technicolor company did
another thing contrary to precedent.
Whether they realized that the motion

picture industry had cried wolf once
too often, or whether they had no money
for advertising campaigns, the new color
process was put on the market with no
ballyhoo whatever.
The first picture was a Mickey
Mouse cartoon, and for several years
color was used only for animated car-
toons, but finally "La Cucaracha" was
made and from then on the sailing has
been fairly smooth. However, the lesson
has been learned, and no longer are the
color authorities content with present
reproduction. Technical research is con-
tinually being made to try to improve
Technicolor. A new field has been
opened up in Color Engineering. Re-
cently a change was made in the blue
dye which not only improves reproduc-
tion but adds to the life of the film.
Another fairly recent development of
the Technicolor company is Koda-
chrome. Also a subtractive color method,
Kodachrome is very similar to Techni-
color except that the three films are
combined one above the other upon the
film base with gelatin layers to separate
them. This five layer film (which is no
thicker than ordinary black and white)
can be exposed in an ordinary camera
but the process of developing is com-
plicated and expensive since each layer
must receive individual treatment.
The color reproductive powers seem
as great in Kodachrome as in Techni-
color and it can be exposed in any
movie camera with a fast enough lens
as compared with a specially con-
structed $15,000 camera for Techni-
color. This opens the new process to
amateurs and makes true color pictures
possible at reasonable prices. It is un-
likely that commercial firms will adopt
Kodachrome because the expense of pro-
cessing would offset the saving in
cameras, but between the two processes
it seems that at last color is here to
stay.
And so when you leave the theatre
after seeing the new "Goldwyn Follies"
you might think of the three decades
of work and research, of fortunes lost
and made, of engineers who devoted
a lifetime to color research—all so that
you and I can see Charlie McCarthy
in full natural color!

More on Summer Work

ENGINEERING undergraduates
seeking summer employment, when
taken collectively, exhibit all varieties
of strengths and weaknesses. The weak-
ness that is at the same time the most
frequent and the most obvious, is the
individual's utter concentration on his
own problems. The more this self-inter-
est is made evident, the more certain it
is that employment will not be forth-
coming.
It is entirely natural and proper for
the undergraduate to be everlastingly
but somewhat privately concerned with
the working out of his plans for train-
ing, education, experience, personal de-
velopment, and financing, while going
through college. If he is not concerned
about it, who will be? The trouble
arises only when he so concentrates on
his own problems, that he gives the
impression of being uninterested in the
other man's problems. When the other
man is a prospective employer, he will
choose to remain "prospective."
There is no point in glossing over
the facts. You need summer work, and
your need may be pressing. Then by
all means say so. But do not keep on
saying it. It is your weakest self-selling
point. No employer ever enjoys being
driven into giving someone a job, solely
because it is needed. What's more, long
before you came along, he has spent
many months worrying about plenty
of other people—-with families—who
need work more than you do.
The employer has his own pressing
needs and worries. One of his ever-
present difficulties is to find a fairly
constant supply of employees who will

fit in, take responsibility, and grow.
Thus, even at times when business is
very bad, and no employment can be
provided, an employer cannot help but
be interested when a good man comes
along. If you are that man, and the
employer becomes convinced of it
through an interview, he will begin to
scratch around to see if there isn't some
place where he can put you to work for
three months. When it all works out,—
What convinced the employer that
he would like to have you around for
the summer? Your letter, asking for an
interview, was a factor. He is so used
to looking at letters from college stu-
dents—letters wretchedly written by
hand, on odd-size paper—that it was
a pleasant shock to get yours. Yours
was perfectly typed on standard
(blank) paper of good quality. You
addressed him correctly. You told your
story concisely. You signed off correctly.
You included the date, your address,
and your telephone number. And there
were no misspelled words, and no mis-
takes in grammar.
In the interview, the employer did
not find you entirely at ease. He ob-
served some small evidences of nervous-
ness and fright. This recalled his own
early experiences, and he approved of
your lack of cock-sureness. He liked the
way you sat up straight. When you
promptly gave concise answers to ques-
tions having obvious answers; and when
you promptly said you didn't know,
when you couldn't be expected to know,
you were moving right along. When
he intentionally opened a gap in the
conversation, you moved into it with
about fifty words that stated your case
in brief, he pinched himself. When you
said you would work anywhere, but
preferred to work as flunkey or assis-
tant in his research department, you
jolted him by showing you knew he
had a research department. When he
laid a little trap, and you showed you
knew that he does make wheels for
trucks but not wheels for freight cars,
he lost again. . . . (There was an in-
terval, during which the employer re-
covered his poise). . . Then he boldly
inquired of you as to how you came to
know anything about his business. And
you frankly told him that your uncle,
who is an attorney, has a close friend
and client who is an officer in a truck
manufacturing plant; that through the
uncle, you were able to talk to the truck
maker, definitely in order to pump him
about the present employer's business.
The pumping only took 15 minutes.
Then you peeped into McRae's Blue-
book to see what it might say; also,
you actually looked at three trade maga-
zines, and personally saw some of the
employer's advertising displays.
Now, throughout, you are still the
undergraduate who very much wants
and needs summer employment. But the
employer's picture of you is entirely
different. He sees an unusual young
man who displays an interest in the
firm's business, as well as in his own
personal problem. He begins to feel that
you are a rare bird, and that you will
go places and do things. The evidence
all points that way. If there is any way

at all for him to squeeze you into the
organization, he will do it. Or, if he
cannot do it this summer, he will next.
You are what he is looking for when
he interviews seniors. If he sometimes
takes graduates, he is visualizing you as
a potential graduate, and a possible
permanent member of his organization.
The foregoing has dealt with the case
of the informed employer, who knows
how to deal with college students. You
will find such men in the larger com-
panies. Let it be noted right here, that
most undergraduates make the mistake
of concentrating on the large, well-
known companies. Nearly everyone
does. If you do, you thereby greatly
narrow your chances. There are many,
many more little companies than big
ones. Where are they and what do they
do? That's your problem, and you can
solve it. After you decide upon the area
in which you want to work, you can
adopt several routines for finding who
does what, and where, in the area.
In going after the little company,
never assume that the employing officer
always has the same title—or any title,
for that matter. There may or may not
be a personnel or employment manager.
Sometimes the treasurer does the hiring,
sometimes the president, sometimes any
officer of the company. There may not
be a college graduate on the premises.
In many industrial units, this is true.
When it is, your status as an undergrad-
uate will need to be played up or down,
depending on the attitude the inter-
viewer already has toward college stu-
dents and graduates. You are going to
meet an employer, sooner or later, who
is against college graduates. If you can
manage to work for him, and handle
all of your relations with him so well
that he can only be proud of you, you
will change his attitude. It will directly
affect your welfare, and that of all
college men who come to him later.
There is nothing fantastic in this possi-
bility; it has happened many times, and
will happen again.
Those who wish to read more exten-
sively about letters and interviews may
find two of my articles in the Novem-
ber and December, 1935, issues of the
Technic. Or better yet, the articles
were reprinted as one article in the

SAILING CLUB
A new organization, the Michigan
Sailing Club, is being whipped into
shape by the members of the Quarter-
deck Society. Whitmore Lake is to be
the scene of activities, as it offers a
good expanse of water for sailing boats
of the smaller classes. The club, which
is backed by the University, has had
several meetings already, and over fifty
students intend to join, a number of
them sailors of merit.
The aims of the club are to make it
possible for everyone on campus to sail,
or learn to sail, and to participate in
intercollegiate sailing regattas. Invita-
tions have already been received from
similar organizations for meets in the
coming months. At present the main
difficulty is in obtaining funds sufficient
to build up a fleet of racing dinks suit-
able to the size of the club. The present
initiation fee will not facilitate rapid
enlargement. It is hoped that some out-
side source of funds will be forthcoming,
as has been the case in sailing clubs of
other campuses.
OPEN HOUSE
On University Day, April thirtieth,
the College of Engineering, under the
guiding spirit of Dean Anderson, will
throw open its doors and display its
merits to the multitudes. This year the
program will be to a great part in the
hands of the students, with full faculty
approval and in cooperation with three
faculty advisers. All societies and de-
partments are invited to exhibit. It is
expected that Professor Ormondroyd's
celluloid model of the Mount Palomar
telescope and a glass model of a power-
house will be on display. Exhibi-
tions will be under the general guiding
hands of Mat Seilski and Dave Roach.

Wes Warren, head man from the stu-
dent angle, has strongly urged all soci-
eties to contribute aid in the form of
guides for the occasion. Any and all
men interested are invited to participate
actively to help make this open house
a really top-notch student triumph.
They should see either Dave or Mat.
Special invitations are being sent to over
three hundred seventy high schools
throughout the state, and anyone who
wishes to send invitations to his family
or friends is encouraged to do so. Invita-
tions will be distributed in the halls of
the West Engineering Building soon.
There will probably also be attractions
for the benefit of the Lawyers and the
Lits. From now on, the Open House
will be held regularly on each alternate
year.
ACTIVITIES
This month of April and the coming
one of May are full of activity for the
local technical societies. Friday, April 1,
the A.I.Ch.E. took an all-day trip to
Detroit covering Detroit Sulfite Pulp
and Paper and U. S. Rubber in the
morning, and Parke-Davis Company in
the afternoon.
U. of M. Transportation Club has
plans for a trip to the General Motors
Proving Ground and a post-spring-vaca-
tion banquet with well-known speakers.
The Michigan Mechanicals come
marching through with some news of the
higher type; they claim to have the
largest student branch of the A.S.M.E.
in the country, numbering 170 members.
A delegation is now attending the Mid-
western Student Conference, composed
of sixteen chapters, guests of Marquette
in Milwaukee. May 4 they are invited
by the senior section into Detroit to a
General Motors Inspection and a ban-
quet.

the Big Apple
TO YOUNG AMERICA, the Big Apple may
be today's dance sensation; but to some
150,000 commercial apple growers it is
a product for profit.
This business of raising the nation's apple
crop, like all other commercial enter-
prises, presents its difficulties. Foremost
is the constant fight the orchardist must
wage against insects and disease.
Only a healthy, unharmed apple can be a
Big Apple. And it requires only the sim-
plest arithmetical calculation to realize
that more big apples make more bushels
—and more bushels per tree make more
profit per season.
Hence, the apple grower is eager for
effective materials to defeat such crop
destroyers as rosy apple aphis, early green
aphis, San Jose scale, scurfy scale, bud
moth, European red mite, apple scab and
similar infestations.
, ^f':
Not only must the fruit itself be safe-
guarded but, equally, the foliage. For, it is
commonly known that the fruit flourishes
in direct proportion to the healthy sub-
stance of the leaves.
Thus, profitable apple growing calls for
seven to twelve sprayings each year to
fully protect fruit and foliage against
insect and disease infestations.
Widely used for these protective spray-
ings are Dowspray Dormant and Dow
"Mike" Sulfur. The former, applied dur-
ing the dormant period, destroys the
aphis egg and is effective against more
insects than any other dormant spray now
available. The latter, used during the
growing season, is a superior wettable
sulfur and provides a high degree of pro-
tection against apple scab and other
fungous growths.
Through these, and many other insecti-
cides and fungicides, Dow is serving the
fruit grower that he may produce larger,
finer crops and enjoy a greater reward for
his efforts.

NAVAL TANK OPERATORS
In the University experimental tank
in the West Engineering building, tests
are being conducted on the effect of in-
creased length of the hull in certain
types of ships. It has been found in
some cases that by lengthening the ship
a greater speed may be obtained with
a given amount of power. With the
thought of benefit from occasional con-
ferences of the directors and staffs of
the six experimental model tanks in the
country, Professor Baier of the Naval
Architecture department called an or-
ganization meeting which was held at
Stevens Institute of Technology on April

those of the University of Michigan,

pany, Stevens Institute of Technology,

MICHIGAN'S "400"
A few years ago a study was made
of the college graduates of engineering
colleges whose names appeared in the
1931 edition of "Who's Who in Engi-
neering." A similar analysis was carried
out for the 1937 edition. Questionnaires
were mailed to 176,000 engineers. The
list was developed from the membership
of the national engineering societies. An
advisory board of prominent engineers
established the qualifications for inclu-
sion in the volume, and the professional
aspects of the work were governed by
the American Engineering Council.
Out of the 142 colleges and univer-
sities of the United States and Canada
listed in the 1931 and 1937 editions of
"Who's Who in Engineering," Michigan
stood third. M.I.T. was first, and Cor-
nell second. The increase in the number
of graduates in the 1937 edition was 97
for M.I.T., 49 for Cornell, and 75 for
Michigan. The number of graduates of
M.I.T. in the '37 edition was 761, for
Cornell 611, Michigan 460. Another in-
teresting fact noticed was that nearly
one-fourth of all the engineers listed
were graduates of M.I.T., Cornell, Mich-
igan and Illinois The other three-fourths
were graduates of the other 139 col-
leges.

PRECISION
It takes a precise machine to turn out precise work.
And if its vital parts are made of Moly irons or steels,
the longer maintenance of its precision is assured.
Shapers, for instance.
One company building such machines uses
0.50 % Mo, Nickel-Moly iron for main and intermediary
gears in the power transmission system. This iron is
used because it possesses the wear resistance
which preserves the close tolerances necessary
to prevent "chattering." Also —because it machines
readily despite its comparatively high hardness.
Thus, the use of Moly brings advantages: (a) to
the builder of the machines through simpler and
more economical fabrication; (b) to the user
through better performance due to longer main-
tained precision; (c) to the user's customers through
better products.

STRETCH
"Stretch" Piatt came to Ann Arbor
direct from Wayne, Pa. Before coming,
however, he took time off in high school
to win his letters on the gridiron and
wrestling mat, not to mention a little
time devoted to putting out the class
yearbook. Stretch continued his wrest-
ling at Michigan his first year, and won
his freshman numerals. After going
through the usual rushing routine, he
ended up in the Chi Psi Fraternity, of
which he has since been president.
An aeronautical engineer, Stretch
plans on graduating this June; beyond
that things are a little uncertain. He is
a member of the Institute of Aeronauti-
cal Sciences, was president of his sopho-
more class, and has been elected into
Triangles and Vulcans, sophomore and
junior-senior honoraries respectively.
Numbered among his most interesting
activities is the Glider Club, in which
he is an instructor. When not pounding
the fundamentals of gliding into some
earnest, struggling neophyte, Fletch de-
lights in skimming in over fence posts
and bombing airport officials with snow-
balls from above. Fletch has spent his
summers working in a leather factory
serving apprenticeship with the Kellet
Autogiro Company, and loafing as a life
guard. His hobby instincts are pretty
well focused on being an ardent golfer,
and a gliding enthusiast. Fletch's capa-
bilities and enthusiasm should carry him
far—and probably will.

AL
Born in Harrington, New Jersey, Al
Waldchen moved at a very tender age
to Astoria, New York, and thence at the
age of nine, to Dearborn, Michigan,
where he decided to stay for a while.
During the staying process, Al went to
Fordson High, played the flute in the
band, and was president of the Commer-
cial Club. During these years Al worked
in a grocery store. He was graduated
from high school when he was sixteen,
and went to work for four years, at first
on a road gang constructing carbonating
towers, and later in a Detroit grocery
store, where he became manager in two
years.
Around about this time Al decided
that a college education would be a
good thing, and started saving money.
So four years after graduating from high
school, Al entered the University of
Michigan enrolling in the Chemical En-
gineering course. His first year here he
made Phi Eta Sigma, freshman scholas-
tic honorary, and in subsequent years
has become a Vulcan and a member of
Tau Beta Pi, of which he is the record-
ing secretary. Al is a member of the
Technic Staff, where he has done some
excellent work. He is also a member
of the Choral Union, was on the Engi-
neering Ball and Slide Rule Dance com-
mittees, is a representative of the A.I.
Ch.E. on the Engineering Council, and
is Vice-President of his class.
For recreation Al makes it a habit to
play handball at least once a week, likes
to swim, skate, and dance. He has earned
all of his expenses through college, has
worked for the last two and one-half
years with Engineering Research, and
has spent his summers on Ford's farms.
He is completely and enthusiastically
sold on chemical engineering, and has an
excellent job lined up in his chosen pro-
fession. We don't like to be dogmatic,
but, judging from past evidence and the
quality of the subject, we don't see how
you can keep the man down!
DAVE
One of the more important of the
senior engineers on the campus is Dave
Lansdale. He is the type from whom
you would expect many and varied ac-
complishments during his career, and so
far he has certainly not disappointed
those who know him in this respect.
The Lansdale family seemed to have
the traveling spirit after Dave was born,
and from Detroit they moved to New
York State and then to Los Angeles,
California, where he lived for several
years. The next move was east to Ann
Arbor, followed by Detroit again.
In order to get a good start in his
education, Dave entered the University
High School. Here he blossomed forth
as a piano player and obtained his prac-

Socially, we see that this mechanical
engineer has not missed many oppor-
tunities. He is vice-president of Delta
Upsilon fraternity, a Vulcan, an A.S.

It should be mentioned that Dave still
travels quite a bit, and claims to have
been in nearly every state in the coun-
try, with the most notable exceptions
of Maine and Vermont. One of the re-
cent holidays he spent basking on a
beach in Florida. To climax everything,
however, a few weeks ago he took a trip
of 1800 miles for a blind date at Smith
College in Northampton, Mass. Accord-
ing to reports, it turned out O.K. and
a good time was enjoyed, but it just
goes to prove something or other about
engineers.

no fault of the method, but are due to
the lack of control of climatic conditions.
Accuracy of the machine seems to be so
good that slight changes of temperature
and humidity are easily discernible. The
obvious answer to this problem is to
carry out tests under controlled cli-
matic conditions. At the present time
work is under way in which the equip-
ment is to be placed in our Constant
Temperature - Constant Humidity room
in order to have absolutely controlled
conditions. If our results are as success-
ful as anticipated, it would seem logical
to place the equipment in a small room
in which the temperature and humidity
conditions may be varied at will.
In a study of the "absorption" of
driers by pigments in oil paints the
"drum paint drying time" machine
showed considerable promise. It is hoped
and expected that further studies will
make possible a better understanding of
many of the variables to be considered
in the drying of oil, paint and varnish
films. For example the evaluation of the
effect of external conditions, such as
temperature and humidity, and of in-
ternal conditions such as type and
amount of drier, oil, filler, and pigment
used, may be carried out with more
certainty.

ONE OF
THE
MAJOR
PROBLEMS
Setup for determining the time in the cycle at which com-
pression noises occur.
One of the major problems in connection with many research projects is the securing
of the proper instrumentation in order to obtain the desired data. A wide variety of in-
struments are required for the instruction work at the University and when these are not
being employed for class work, they are available for use on research.
Present day problems are usually so complex that often a great number of instruments
must be correlated into one setup. Instrumentation is the correlation of instruments in
such setups and generally means the adaptation of instruments not specifically designed
for the job.
The University personnel are accustomed to make such adaptations in their research
work. Because of this, the research service offered to industry should prove particularly
attractive to those organizations which can not afford to purchase their own instruments or
employ the specialized type of personnel necessary for research work.

The 1938 session of Camp Davis will begin on June 27 and end on August 19. Since 1929 the camp has occupied a site near the
south end of the Jackson Hole area in northwestern Wyoming. The clear days and cool nights of this region provide an ideal climate
for field work in surveying. A considerable area near the camp is clear of trees and brush and has a topography varying from gentle
slopes to rugged mountains.
The camp is in the valley of the Hoback River, 20 miles south of Jackson and about 75 miles south of the Yellowstone National Park.
It is on the highway connecting the Lincoln Highway at Rock Springs, Wyoming with the Park. The work of the camp is arranged
to permit a three-day trip to the Park, as well as week-end trips to nearer points of interest.
Students and faculty are housed comfortably in permanent buildings provided with running water, electric lights, and a modern sanitary
system. The cost for the eight weeks session varies between $125 and $150, depending upon the individual.
Inquiries concerning the camp should be addressed to Professor Harry Bouchard, College of Engineering, Ann Arbor, Mich.

18 INCHES OF SUNLIGHT
A 50,000-WATT General Electric MAZDA lamp, a
^"*- foot and a half in diameter, was recently
installed in the Styling Section of the General
Motors Corporation at Detroit. This lamp, the first
of its size to he used commercially, is utilized to
simulate sunlight on automobiles on display. Previ-
ous lighting not only was inadequate, but produced
distracting reflections on the car bodies.
By means of a G-E thyratron reactor control
similar to devices used to dim lights in many large
theaters, the light from the lamp can be varied
from full brilliance to a black-out.
Many such practical applications as this are the
culmination of group effort. That is why General
Electric Test men of today and yesterday are always
to be found contributing their part to General
Electric's progress.

FOR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT
EACH year General Electric honors those em-
ployees who have done outstanding work in
their fields as provided in the Charles A. Coffin
Foundation. This year 40 men were chosen—15 of
them college graduates:
Adelbert Alexay, Polytechnic Institute of Budapest,
'11; *Alexander Babillis, Rose Polytechnic Institute,
'28; *T. M. Berry, Kansas State College, '27;
Michael Broverman, Tri-State College, '22; F. E.
Carlson, University of Michigan, '25; *S. B. Crary,
Michigan State College, '27; R. E. Farnham, Case
School of Applied Science, '17; J. W. Gilchrest.
Cooper Union, '08; *A. H. Lauder, University of
Wyoming, '22; *Domenico Martignone, Central
Technical College of London, '01; *F. N. Neal,

of Idaho, '25; F. C. Smith, Drexel Institute, '06;
*L. A. Umansky, Poly technical Institute of Petro-
grad, '15; R. E. Worstell, Purdue University, '25.
If any one generalization could he made to cover the
qualifications for this award, it would probably hinge
upon the extent to which an employee took advan-
tage of his opportunities, beyond the ordinary
routine of his work to achieve an outstandingly
worth-while result.

LIGHTNING GUIDER
AFTER three years of photographing natural
■ lightning striking the Empire State Building in
New York City, it was determined that many light-
ning strokes which appear to crash from the clouds
to the ground actually are met part way by a small
flash, originating from the earth, which guides the
stroke to its destination.
In addition, laboratory tests, under the direction
of Karl B. McEachron, graduate of Purdue Uni-
versity and former G-E Test man, indicate that
discharges between points and planes always begin
at the point. The Empire State represents to the
cloud a tremendous needle on the earth's surface.
Thus the guiding flash will originate from the tower
and shoot upward.
Destruction occurs when a lightning bolt con-
tacts a high-resistance area. Lightning conductors
prevent this by grounding the discharge in an area
of low ground resistance, and the lightning control
on the Empire State affords a protective area with-
in a radius of approximately one mile.

CARRIER

On the Great Nieuw Amsterdam
The Largest Air Conditioning System Afloat!
TT WAS no simple task adapting air con-
■*■ ditioning to the ocean liner. Carrier
engineers worked for years to overcome
•what seemed to be unsurmountable ob-
stacles. The corrosive effect of salt air and
water, for example, made it necessary to
introduce special metals for condensers
—and drip-proof or water-tight construc-
tion for motors. New types of equipment
-were necessary to meet the restrictions
imposed by low ceilings and limited
space. Then there were problems of
propeller vibration the rolling of the
ship...the rapid changes of outdoor
weather conditions. And, above all, the
necessity for absolute dependability.
Carrier engineers overcame
these obstacles — overcame them
so thoroughly that today, any ship
built without air conditioning is
considered obsolete before she is
launched. The "Normandie," the
"Queen Mary," the "Mariposa" and
dozens of smaller vessels all feature
Carrier Air Conditioning for passengers'
comfort. And now, with the maiden
voyage of the "Nieuw Amsterdam" this
spring, the largest air conditioning system
afloat will be in operation.
Aboard the "Nieuw Amsterdam," pas-
sengers will enjoy true air conditioning
at any season of the year. They'll be kept
cool in hot weather by Carrier Centrifu-
gal Refrigerating Machines providing
300 tons of cooling—or the equivalent
of melting 600,000 pounds of ice each
day. In cool weather they'll be warmed
by gentle Carrier heating. And always,
arrie
Air Conditioning
ENGINEERS
they'll find perfect ventilation and circu-
lation of clean, humidity-controlled air.
Engineering enabled Carrier to
pioneer in the marine field—just as it
enabled Carrier to pioneer in every other
field of industry and commerce. And the
opportunity for still greater engineering,
and still greater pioneering are as great
or greater today than ever before. Youth
is no obstacle—at Carrier, recognition is
gained by accomplishments, not by age
alone. And the young engineer is en-
couraged to use his abilities to their best
advantage—whether they be adapted to
experimental, development or installation
work in Carrier's world-wide organization.
• * *
During 1937, Carrier trained 300 recant
graduates from leading engineering
schools in every section of the country.
Carrier needs more men. If you had a good
school record, and are interested in the
world's most fascinating and fastest-
growing industry, write us.

Logically, the bring-
ing of American-
made synthetic rub-
ber to full com-
mercial development
has precipitated untold interest in industry.
Even to have arrived at potential freedom
from raw rubber importation would con-
stitute a step of stellar magnitude in our
national well-being.
But, the discovery and evolution of these
new chemically made rubbers goes
further than that. They possess, over and
above all the unique properties of nature's
product, the ability to ignore natural
rubber's arch enemies—petroleum, many
solvents and chemicals, sunlight, air and
moisture.
Obviously, the great petroleum industry-
has been quick to utilize these remarkable
rubbers. Hose made completely or lined
with these oil-proof rubbers is, today,
widely used in the handling of oil and
gasoline. Likewise, makers of paint and
lacquer spraying equipment have added
to the life and service of their products.
The printing industry is benefiting by
employing these remarkable rubbers for
ink-carrying rollers, blankets and print-
ing plates.
In automobiles, aircraft and various
equipment where rubber serves in the
presence of oil or gasoline, these rubbers
are rendering remarkable service.
Currently, these synthetic rubbers are
available in several forms and seven dif-
ferent grades, marketed under the brand-
name "THIOKOL." These include crude
synthetic rubber, liquid coating materials,
printing plate powders and molding
powders. The crude product is fabri-
cated by the identical methods employed
with natural crude rubber while the
powder forms are converted into finished
rubber products by thermo-plastic
molding.
While this great contribution to industry
belongs to the Thiokol Corporation,
Yardville, New Jersey, which pioneered
its development and brought it to com-
mercial success, The Dow Chemical
Company is now charged with the com-
plete production of crude "THIOKOL."
The Thiokol organization will con-
centrate its efforts on marketing "THIO-
KOL" and widening the horizon of its
usefulness.
It is gratifying to Dow to be identified in
so important a capacity with a material
of such prominence, broad usefulness
and value.

THIS MONTH AND LAST
With the publication of the May issue, the MICHIGAN TECHNIC
suspends operation for the current school year. This year has been
marked by a series of articles dealing with the qualities various branches
of engineering seek in the young recruit. Next year we are planning a
series discussing the opportunities in the several functional branches of
engineering such as sales, operation, maintenance, and consulting.
To climax the year's activity, the May issue contains a large number
of interesting features. It is the largest magazine we have published for
five years. "More Power To You" by ). Anderson Ashburn explains some
of the difficulties radio station WLW experienced in operating 500 Kw.
This is a very timely topic as this week WLW appears before the FCC
to ask the permanent continuation of their experimental permit to operate
at this power. The National Safety Council contributes "Safety"—an
article dealing with the hazards to be expected in your early engineering
career. Six other articles plus the usual departments complete a line-up
which we feel will provide a maximum of reading enjoyment .

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


by
W. A. JACKSON
Chairman of the Telegraph and Telephone Section of the Association of
American Railroads and Superintendent of Telegraph of the New York
Central Railroad.

IF the average citizen were to be asked
to name the greatest modern scien-
tific marvel, the chances are very great
that he would cast his vote for our na-
tional and world-wide systems of radio
communication; he would have consid-
erable justification for so doing. Regard-
less of the breadth of one's knowledge
of the communication art, sober reflec-
tion must, at times, bring a feeling of
wonder that such a thing can be pos-
sible. The act of talking hundreds and
thousands of miles through space with-
out any apparent connecting media does
challenge the imagination.
But to the initiated there are some-
times known commonplace applications
of scientific principles not familiar to
the general public. Sometimes, these are
not, in themselves, challenging to the
imagination, though they may, none the
less, be technical wonders of the first
magnitude. In this category falls the
carrier.
The principle of the carrier and of
carrier currents as applied in communi-
cation plants has made it possible for
the telegraph and telephone systems of
the world to be developed to the extent
they are today. What is there that is so
marvelous about this principle? What
does it do? We are all familiar with the
elementary type of telephone circuit
which makes possible a single conver-
sation between two points. Suppose it
were desired to have more than one con-
versation at one time between these two
points. Without the principle of carrier
currents it would be necessary to set up
an entirely different system to do this.
We do not need to go to that trouble,
however. It is possible for the second
conversation to be carried by the same
two wires that carry the first without in
any way interfering with this first con-
versation. We can appreciate the marvel
of this principle when we realize that
not only can we do this with two con-
versations, but we can send a number of
messages in either direction over the
same two wires at the same time. The
principle of carrier currents figuratively
causes many wires to "grow" where only
one or two grew before—and all without
the setting of one additional pole—the
placing of one additional crossarm—the
erection of one additional foot of cable
—or the stringing of one additional mile
of wire.
This is termed a "technical wonder"
because it is something which does not
appeal to the popular imagination and
requires some knowledge of the electri-
cal sciences in order better to appreciate
it. In the beginning of this discussion,
radio communication was chosen as a
familiar object of popular imagination
because it was desired to draw this
parallel. As applied to the art of com-
munication, there is only one essential
difference between radio communication
and the application of carrier to wire
communication, and that is this: With
radio we use a system of modulated
carrier frequencies literally to cast our
available energy to the four winds. By
the carrier principle we are able to avoid
such an apparently wasteful expendi-
ture of energy, and can, by exactly anal-
ogous methods, confine our tranmission
to the vicinity of one or more me-
tallic conductors and guide it to the de-
sired destination. It is submitted that
the latter is, in many respects, the
greater of the two wonders.
What is this carrier, then? To those
who may not already know, a few sim-
ple illustrations will probably make this
principle generally clear. Let us con-
sider first, as something with which
most of us are familiar, an elementary
type of telephone circuit for two-way
communication, consisting of a transmit-
ter and receiver at each end of a two
wire line, all four elements connected
in series with each other, and all ener-
gized by a battery at some point in se-
ries with the line. In this elementary
system there will be, of course, a flow
of direct current through both receivers
from the battery.
This system can scarcely be recom-
mended as an example of good tele-
phone engineering, but for short dis-
tances it would work. If some one were
to speak into one of the transmitters,
its internal resistance would be varied
in accordance with the fluctuations of
the acoustical power received from the
speaker. This, in turn, would cause a
corresponding fluctuation of the direct
current in the system. This fluctuating
direct current may, by well known prin-
ciples, be described as two separate cur-
rents—one a steady direct current, the
other an audio-frequency alternating
current superimposed upon the direct
current. This system bears some anal-
ogy to an actual carrier system in which
the various elements are comparable as
follows: The transmitter at the one end
can be thought of as a device which
"modulates" the direct current. The
MAY, 1938


ered the "carrier." The receiver on the
distant end can be pictured as a "de-
modulator," by virtue of its ability to
separate the voice frequency from the
direct current "carrier."
Now, to carry the analogy a step
further, let us suppose that we add to
our system a transformer at each end,
direct current to be supplied to the
transmitters from a local battery, with
the secondary or high-impedance wind-
ings of the coils connected to the line.
Under this arrangement, these condi-
tions obtain:
1. The transmitter-battery circuit at
each end is localized, and battery
losses are confined to those which
would occur in a very short length
of wire in or near the telephone
equipment.
2. The only current actually flowing
in the line is the audio or voice-
frequency component. The direct
current has been eliminated, insofar
as the line is concerned. We may
say it has been "suppressed."
The above analogy may be considered
rather crude, but it represents roughly
what goes on in systems of carrier cur-
rent telegraphy or telephony as we know
them today.
Many men have used their talents
and expended their time and energy in
the development, engineering, manu-
facture and application of carrier sys-
tems, but we are indebted chiefly to
two men for the pioneering work in this
direction. The first, Dr. Lee DeForest,
gave us the three-element vacuum tube,
without which modern electrical com-
munication, as we know it, probably
could not exist. The second, General
Squire, was born up in the little Michi-
gan town of Dryden back in 1865 and
died in the same town in 1934, but not
without having sailed the seas and pene-
trated the tropical jungles in his coun-
try's service. Although he was a soldier,
he appears to have belonged also, as
does Dr. DeForest, to that select group
of scientific adventurers—the ones who
are able to concieve and develop origi-
nal ideas.
General Squires called his idea "wired
wireless" which, from a descriptive
standpoint, is not at all a bad name,
because that is really what it is. We
now call it the shorter name of "carrier."
DeForest, in his triode, gave us a de-
vice which can do all of the following
under proper circuit conditions:
1. It can "oscillate"—that is, serve
as the source of sustained electrical
oscillations.
2. It can "detect" or rectify.
3. It can amplify—that is, serve as
the agency through which energy
is added to the circuit.
4. In can aid in the combination of
different frequencies of oscillations.
This brings us, then, to a description
of the elements of a carrier system. No
effort will be made to deal with the
characteristics of any particular system,
but only with principles that are com-
mon to all systems.
The first requirement of any carrier
system is one or more sources of sus-
tained electrical oscillations. This is or-
dinarily a vacuum tube oscillator, al-
though the telegraph and telephone com-
panies are both using, to some extent, a
multiple frequency generator for carrier
telegraph. In the early days of undamped
wave radio telegraphy, this function
was provided by an electric arc, which
under certain favorable circuit condi-
tions was capable of producing un-
damped, or sustained, oscillations. This
is the heart of the radio; it is also the
heart of the wire carrier. In fact, the
high frequency alternating current pro-
duced by such an oscillator is called the
"carrier current." Let us suppose, for
example, that this current is provided at
a frequency of, say, 30,000 cycles per
second. Such a current if sent through
the winding of a telephone receiver
would give no indication of its presence,
as it would produce vibrations of the
diaphragm far beyond the audible limit.
Most people can recognize a tone hav-
ing a frequency of 100 to 5,000 cycles
per second. A few can hear a tone of
10,000 cycles per second, but it is
doubtful whether anyone can dectect
by ear the presence of vibrations of 15,-
000 cycles or higher.
Under these conditions, therefore,
such a carrier could be superimposed
upon an ordinary telephone circuit and
transmitted at the same time that an
ordinary conversation is being held on
that circuit without the knowledge of
the people who are using the line. In its
"raw" form, however, such a current
would serve no useful function. It would
be received at the distant terminal, in
its same form, but very much at-
tenuated, that is, with its amplitude de-
creased and its phase angle altered. It
should be noted, in this connection, that
as the attenuation experienced by any
alternating current in a transmission
system is a function of its frequency, it
would be expected that the attenuation
of a carrier current of 30,000 cycles
would be measureably greater than that
of a voice current of, say, 2,000 cycles.
This is, of course, true.
Having established the conception
that a carrier current of 30,000 cycles
can be made to flow in a telephone
circuit without interfering in any no-
ticeable manner with the usual voice-
frequency equipment and conversations,
there is no reason why one could not
conceive of the addition to the system
of a second carrier current of, say, 60,-
000 cycles per second. This carrier, in
turn, would be found to interfere neither
with the voice-frequency channel nor
with the 30,000 cycle channel. Its be-
havior would follow the same pattern,
essentially, as that of the 30,000 cycle
channel, but it would be attenuated to
a somewhat greater extent.
All conditions remaining the same,
there is, then, no reason why a third
channel of 90,000 cycles could not be
added to the system. Theoretically, one
could go on and on by discreet intervals
adding channel after channel, except
that there are certain practical limita-
tions which need not be considered at
this point. Our system, then, would be
developed to the point where at the
receiving or distant terminal a com-
posite current made up of voice fre-
quencies and carrier frequencies of 30
kilocycles, 60 kilocycles, and 90 kilo-
cycles would appear. These individual
components can then be separated at
the distant end by means of a set of
so-called filters, which are assemblies of
carefully chosen units of resistance, in-
ductance, and capacity so designed as
to pass only a narrow band of frequen-
cies in the vicinity of 30 kilocycles, 60
kilocycles, and 90 kilocycles. We then
have four channels available for some
yet-to-be-determined use. In other
words we are able to send into a pair of
wires four channels of energy, allow
them to combine into one composite
wave form, and by means of filters di-
vide it again into four separate currents
at the distant end.
The voice-frequency channel is al-
ready in workable form, but the other
three channels are not yet in a form
which we can use. It would be possible.
of course, to interrupt the flow of the
three carrier waves periodically to trans-
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


transmission of intelligence, or other
signal impulses to open or close circuits
at the distant end. There are a number
of such possibilities which immediately
suggest themselves.
In addition, they can be made to
serve the same purpose as the voice-fre-
quency telephone channel by "modula-
tion" or modification of the carrier wave
form of each carrier channel in accord-
ance with the outline of any voice-
frequency telephone current which may
be impressed upon it. It is easy to refer
in this rather glib manner to the process
of modulation, but in reality it is diffi-
cult to obtain a clear conception of what
takes place except by mathematical
analysis. There are two viewpoints,
either of which is acceptable. The first
is that in the modulation of a carrier
wave, the "envelope" of the modulated
wave is in the form of the wave of the
voice frequency which it is desired to
transmit. The other is that a band of
frequencies results whose maximum
value is the frequency of the carrier
plus that of the maximum voice fre-
quency and whose minimum value is
the frequency of the carrier minus that
of the maximum voice frequency.
In any event, the result is that the
modulated wave is such that it can be
treated and handled as a band of fre-
quencies with the limits prescribed
above. Such being the case, so-called
'"band-filters" can be designed, as pre-
viously mentioned, whose function at
the distant terminal is to separate the
several modulated carrier frequencies
so that they can be brought out to
separate terminals for further handling.
After the different carrier frequencies
have been separated again at the dis-
tant end into the several channels, we
find ourselves with the same number of
lines of communication, all of which
have been carried upon one pair of wires,
but which, with the exception of the
voice-frequency channel, are not yet
in useable form. Each of the carrier
waves having been modulated at the
sending end, it is necessary that each
be de-modulated at the receiving end
in order to be of practical use. This is
essentially a process of "detection" and
is exactly analogous to the same process
in radio communication, where the
audio-frequency is separated from its
carrier and made audible to the ear of
the listener. After having been "de-

Wired Wireless."

tected" or de-modulated the result is
in a form which may be handled as any
conventional telephone circuit.
It is to be understood, of course, that
while the above description has covered
transmission in only one direction, it
is only a matter of circuit design and
methods which are well known to com-
munication engineers to provide for two
way transmission over each channel.
Carrier transmission, in its actual
working form, is limited chiefly to open
wire circuits. It should be noted that
because of the high frequencies in-
volved, circuit elements which are rela-
tively unimportant at power or voice
frequencies may become extremely im-
portant. A very small series inductance
may become a very heavy choke; a
small shunt capacity may become almost
a dead short. This accounts for the
sharp increase in attenuation which oc-
curs at the higher carrier frequencies.
An interesting point in this connection
is the shunting loss caused by ice de-
posits on open wire lines. Ice is an im-
perfect dielectric, and when it forms
a coating on wires it lies in the electric
field surrounding the conductors. Di-
electric losses then occur which appear
as shunt losses. In general, wet insula-
tors and ice in its various forms are the
more important causes of variations in
the transmission of carrier currents over
open wire lines.
Mention should here be made of the
co-axial cable recently constructed by
the Bell System engineers for communi-
cation purposes between New York and
Philadelphia. This cable consists of a
single large guage conductor which is
surrounded by, but insulated from, a
continuous cylindrical metal sheath
which forms the other side of the cir-
cuit. Because of the nature of its con-
struction, the cable can be said to be
completely shielded from external in-
ductive disturbances. Its chief claim to
practicality, however, lies in the fact
that it permits the simultaneous trans-
mission over the one conductor of a
very large number of carrier channels—
of the order of two hundred or more,
depending, of course, upon the width
of the "bands." Furthermore, transmis-
sion of frequencies of an order usually
thought of as being in the "radio" range
is practicable, and developments indi-
cate the possibility of as many as 750
channels.
It would scarcely be expected that a
complete detailed description of any
one carrier system could be given here,
not to speak of the several other types
which have been developed. All of these,
however, differ from each other only in
circuit details and methods. The broad
principles of carrier currents, as ex-
plained above, remain the same in all
systems.

Bureau of Roads,
U. S. Department of Agriculture
IN past years general highway admin-
istrative policy has been determined
very largely by the mere desire of prac-
tically all communities for excellent
roads. Today, however, the total annual,
or continuing, cost of roads and streets
has reached such proportions that pres-
ent and future programs of highway im-
provements must be based on a definite
knowledge of need. It is the function of
highway planning to supply this knowl-
edge, after having given enlightened con-
sideration to all of the several social and
economic elements involved.
The funds used for road and street
purposes are derived from property taxes,
special assessments against abutting and
adjacent property, and certain privilege
taxes or fees, including gasoline taxes
and registration fees. Such privilege
taxes or fees now constitute a very sub-
stantial portion of the highway revenue
from all sources, and property taxes as
a source of highway revenue are gradu-
ally passing out
of the picture.
This tendency,
moreover, is in
accord with the
status of pres-
ent-day highway
systems.
When the de-
velopment of
these systems be-
gan there was
not much argu-
ment as to what
projects should
be improved first
—all were important and greatly bene-
fited the public. Today there exists a
more-or-less complete system of main
highways, and construction is giving
way to maintenance and extensions and
improvements of the existing system.
Clearly the benefits resulting from such
improvements are road-user benefits and
should be financed with road-user reve-
nues.
Feeder roads and local land-service
roads, however, are today in the same
position as were these main roads some
twenty years ago, and must be extended
and improved in order to take full ad-
vantage of the main roads. As they are
extended and improved, and new ones
built, the consequent benefits will be
partly road-user, partly road-access, and
partly general-public. Hence they should
be financed partly by road-user reve-
nues, partly by special assessments, and
partly by property taxes; but although
the intangible benefits of a road system
practically obligate the community at
large to construct such roads up to a
certain minimum standard by means of
a general tax levy, subsequent main-
tenance and improvement costs are a
direct charge against traffic and cannot
justifiably be paid for with property

taxes.
Neverthless, it is evident that all of
the costs of all highways should not
be charged against the motor vehicle.
There is general agreement that motor
vehicles should pay the entire cost of
the state highways and some portion of
the costs of local roads and city streets,
the portion depending on an evaluation
of those benefits which accrue to the
public in general. Most of these benefits
are indefinite and difficult to evaluate;
there are, among others, benefits to pe-
destrian traffic, to utility companies
which are permitted to occupy portions
of the right-of-way, to publicly-owned
vehicles exempt from taxation, and to
adjoining property as increased land
values.
After a decision has been reached as
to what proportion of total annual high-
way costs shall be charged to motor
vehicles as a class, it is then necessary
to decide how much to charge each ve-
hicle. If all vehicles weighed the same,
or if gasoline consumption varied di-
rectly with weight, this decision would
be a simple one, and would depend only
on the relative annual mileage of each
vehicle. Since neither of these supposi-
tions is a fact, however, it is necessary
to know not only
the mileage trav-
eled by each ve-
hicle but also its
weight and size
characteristics.
Then, if the the-
ory that larger
and heavier ve-
hicles necessitate
wider surfaces
and thicker pave-
ments is accept-
ed, it is logical
to charge these
heavier vehicles
a higher amount than is charged the
ordinary vehicle. As all road improve-
ment and construction is dependent on
revenue, it is important that highway
users pay taxes in proportion to benefi's
received: otherwise, the highway sys-
tem will eventually collapse for lack of
8
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


public support.
Important, too, is
a decision as to how
much of the total road-user
revenues from each type of vehicle
shall be spent for state highways, how
much for local roads, and how much for
city streets. To make this decision it is
necessary to know not only the traffic-
density on each mile of each of the three
classes of roads and streets but also the
corresponding traffic pattern by vehicle
type; it is essential to have not only a
record of total miles traveled annually
by each vehicle but also a record as to
how much of this travel is on each of
the several systems of roads and streets.
Then it is possible, on the basis of rel-
ative vehicle-miles traveled, to allocate
to each system a just portion of the
money contributed by each type or class
of vehicle. Relative usage alone, how-
ever, is not an adequate basis for judg-
ing the proper distribution of revenues
10 systems; in the case of city streets.
for example, there must be considered
the indirect benefits accruing to the city
by reason of increased business brought
from neighboring areas by improved
rural roads, and also the fact that these
streets existed practically in their pres-
ent form even in "horse-and-buggy"
days.
Once the available money has been
apportioned to each of the several road
systems, there must next be considered
the relative need of particular highway
improvement projects. To economically
justify a specific highway improvement
or extension project which is being con-
sidered along with several others, it is
essential that the cost of such project be
at least equalled by its anticipated reve-
nue, and that the revenue be warranted
by corresponding benefits. Obviously,
those projects whose anticipated reve-
nue equals or exceeds the estimated costs
are those which must be given prior con-
sideration; the greater the excess reve-
nue, the greater the need. Certain local-
road improvements which may not be
economically desirable, however, may
nevertheless be justified by their in-
tended use as school-bus routes and
rural mail routes.
For simplicity, and because the fees
charged motor-vehicle users, except for
gasoline taxes, are generally assessed
upon an annual basis, it is customary to
present highway cost figures on the ba-
sis of annual costs. For purposes of com-
parison the annual cost of a highway or
section of highway may include depre-
ciation of the original investment, inter-
est charges based on the original outlay,
maintenance costs, and operating costs
of the vehicles using the highway or
section under consideration. Exclusive
of operating costs, which are of course
dependent on the number of vehicles
involved, these annual costs may vary
from one hundred dollars per mile for
unimproved earth to two thousand dol-
lars or more per mile for two-lane con-
crete.
Anticipated road-user revenues include
fuel taxes, vehicle license fees, and mis-
cellaneous receipts, such as driver's li-
cense fees and fines, and may vary from
three-tenths of a cent per vehicle-mile
on a gravel road to five-tenths of a cent
or more per vehicle-mile on a multiple-
lane concrete highway. Theoretically,
gasoline consumption is less on a high-
type than on a low-type road. Actually,
because of higher relative speeds and
a higher percentage of trucks and bus-
ses, which consume large amounts of
gasoline, gasoline consumption, and con-
sequently anticipated road-user revenue
per vehicle-mile, is greater on the high-
type road.
In anticipating the revenue which will
^
result from a
particular project it
is necessary in many
cases to predict probable and
possible future traffic trends, and
to consider those natural resources and
other land characteristics which may in-
fluence future population and industrial
trends, and consequently, traffic trends.
Questions of engineering as well as of
economics are involved, also, and parti-
cularly important are alignment require-
ments, grade lines which will provide the
necessary sight distance and free move-
ment of various types of vehicles, and
the width and type of construction
which will result in the least first cost
commensurate with minimum mainten-
ance cost. Equally important are acci-
dent-prevention measures such as the
elimination of grade crossings and the
separation of opposing vehicle lanes.
Highway planning, then, in addition
to the collection of data concerning pres-
ent, future, and continuing costs of con-
struction and maintenance of roads and
streets, involves a consideration of the
following problems:

of total highway costs chargeable to the

THE ENGINEER'S EVER-PRESENT PROBLEM
by
EDWARD R. GRANNISS
National Safety Council
WHEN the engineering college
graduate of today takes a posi-
tion, whether it is in a mine, on bridge
construction, in a manufacturing plant
or elsewhere, his employer expects him
to know something of accident preven-
tion methods. Frequently the employer
is disappointed.
Leaders in industry have found that
accidents are expensive, not only in
doctors' bills and compensation costs,
but in tools and materials spoiled and
in valuable time lost from the job. In-
dustry is dependent upon uninterrupted
production for profitable operation. Also,
when a man is crippled, all of the in-

"Designing safe tools and equipment
vestment that has gone into his train-
ing is lost.
Men with excellent educational back-
grounds and even with experience in
plant work, with qualities to become
valuable technicians, are every day per-
mitting unsafe practices to grow on them
until eventually accidents cut short their
careers. It may be as simple as acid
splashing from a test tube, causing
blindness and making a man practically
useless to his employer—and to himself.
Each year, among industrial workers,
2,000 eyes are lost, and it is safe to say
that almost every one of those eyes
could have been saved through the sim-
ple expedient of wearing goggles.
Accident prevention is something more
than "being careful"; it is an exact sci-
ence. There are definite fundamentals
with which the engineering student
should be familiar for the protection of
himself and his job. No branch of engi-
neering is so closely allied with all the
others as that of safety. It is a part of
all engineering.
Many phases of safety engineering
are evident in the regular curriculum of
study, even though the undergraduate
may know them under other names.
Safety is an ever-present consideration
in design. In electrical engineering, oil
switches, current breakers, insulators,
and other equipment are discussed
mostly for their load control features,
but their value in preventing injuries to
workers is by no means secondary. Let
equipment of too low capacity be used,
and lives will be jeopardized. Studies in
strength of materials, streamlining, con-
trol of air bodies, highway building,
structural design, and so on almost end-
lessly, all involve consideration of safety.
To be good enough, today's engineering
products must be safe enough.
But this undertone of safety which
the student engineer gets in his college
work, and which frequently is all he
brings with him into industry, impor-
tant as it is, is not enough to equip him
for industrial experience. Generally he
does not know how to play his part in
organized industrial safety. Scientific ac-
cident prevention, like any engineering
project, starts with a plan built on sound
basic premises and fashioned to suit lo-
cal conditions. The employer hopes his
engineering graduate will know enough
safety so that not only will his adjust-
ment to the existing organization be rea-

sonably rapid, but also that he may
take the leadership for which he has
been prepared by special training.
There will probably be, for instance,
various safety committees with which he
must work. Often in large concerns there
is a central or "steering" committee
with its medical, educational, chemical,
mechanical, and electrical engineering
talent, which will direct and assist, as
may be necessary, the sub-committees
working in the various departments. The
departmental committees in intimate
contact with working conditions have
their own specialized problems, for it is
up to them to develop the facts of acci-
dent causation. Competent inspections
will disclose unsafe mechanical and
physical conditions and also the unsafe
acts of workers. This information can be
developed, too, in the investigation of ac-
cidents, for no accident has ever hap-
pened in which there was neither an un-
safe condition nor an unsafe act, and
frequently both are present.
Uncovering true causes through in-
vestigation is one of the most impor-
tant features of successful accident pre-
vention work. It is here that the college
man, trained in drawing accurate con-
clusions from facts, can be of inestim-
able value. Causes may be of widely
varied types. They may be physiological
or psychological. They may lie in the
poor design of equipment, in lack of
ventilation, sanitation, or illumination,
in unsafe clothing; they may be inher-
ited: or they may exist in improper job
training.
Once causes have been determined,
methods of correction will excite the best
engineering imagination. Designing safe
tools and equipment, guarding mechan-
ical equipment, removing toxic or flam-
mable dusts and vapors by special
exhaust systems, all are everyday pos-
sibilities. The formulation of safe oper-
ating instructions and methods of en-
forcing them, perhaps through special
bonuses or penalties, is a fascinating and
creative work.
Keeping accident records in itself is
a specialty which includes the tabula-
tion of data, summaries, analyses, prog-
ress graphs, etc. These records may be
the sole basis for the entire work of the
safety committees. In fact, they may
often determine the need for elaborate
, installations such as air conditioning
systems, the remodeling of whole illu-
mination layouts, new personal hygiene
equipment, and even new building equip-
ment.
♦Safety work has in many cases been
retarded by so elementary a thing as in-
correct terminology. Injuries have been
called accidents. Accident types have
been called causes, and so on in almost
endless profusion. If this were only a
matter of rhetoric, little harm would be
done, but it is more far-reaching. Ac-
curate statistics are necessary for the
proper direction of the accident preven-
tion program. If, when cause data are
assembled, they tell a garbled story,
progress is retarded.
Briefly, the story is this. The injury is
the physical damage suffered—the cut,
the burn, or the bruise. It is the result
of an accident, the type of which may be
a slip, a fall, a falling object, and so on.
Accidents have causes divided roughly
into personal and mechanical. Personal
causes include fatigue and lack of skill,
while unsafely designed, unguarded
equipment, etc., would be considered as
mechanical causes. Included in the per-
sonal causes is that large important
group known as unsafe acts of workers,
which in turn have other "sub-causes"
behind them.
In listing injuries, accident types, and
causes, care must be taken in classify-
ing each group. The rule of having each
item of a classified list fall in the same
category so as not to overlap with any
other item and to have the list wholly
complete is imperative and will immedi-
ately be recognized as logical by the en-
gineering student. A good statistical code
for accident cause recording is available,
but the number of instances in which it
is not used is surprising. Thus oppor-
tunities exist for considerable improve-
ment in many plant systems.
Accident experience usually may be
considered an accurate index of plant or
department efficiency. Obviously the
only right way to do any job is the
safe way. As stated in a commonly used
textbook, "Electrical Engineering Lab-
oratory Experiments," by Ricker and
Tucker, "An engineer's reputation for
reliability is seriously injured if his lack
of foresight results in accident to himself
or others."
Roughly, safety may be considered in
two divisions. First, there is the safety
consciousness which is inherent in all
people and which is very much a vari-
able quality. It is that sense which gen-
erally keeps individuals from jumping
out of high windows and lying down in
busy streets but often permits them to
do other things equally foolhardy. The
rest of safety is that which comes from
deliberate training and is meant to im-
prove and augment the safety sense al-
ready existing.
Safety consciousness is in a compara-
tively low state at the time of life when
a man leaves college. Outstanding proof
of this is found in national automobile
accident statistics. The automobile ac-
cident rates for drivers from eighteen
years old and on through the low twen-
ties are far higher than for other age
groups, except for persons over seventy
when physical incapability, of course,
becomes the main factor.
It follows, therefore, that formal train-
ing must supplement the young engi-
neer's natural safety instincts if he is to
avoid personal injury and meet what is
now one of the first obligations of in-
dustry.

A STUDENT PLANS FOR THE FUTURE
by
CHARLES O. PROBST, '39E
THE "car of tomorrow"' was really
begun in 1934 with the introduction
of the Airflows. These cars featured
three basically new features: (1) The
powerplant and passenger compart-
ment were moved twenty inches for-
ward; (2) The body and chassis were
combined in one welded steel tube
unit; (3) A semi-streamlined body with
a short hood was adopted. By moving
the passenger compartment forward,
the pitching motion of the rear seat was
reduced, the width of the rear doors
was increased, and the action of the
front springs was softened by increas-
ing the weight on them. Disadvantages
incurred with the Airflow design were:
Hard steering caused by excess weight
on the front axle, and a tendency to
''point" on the road at high speeds;
short legroom and headroom because
of streamlining: long overhangs, front
and rear; a short stubby hood which
was not in accord with public taste at
the time.
The four ensuing years have seen
developments and modifications of this
design by every manufacturer. In 1935
the conventional DeSoto appeared, and
a grill and hood were incorporated in
the Airflow. The same year Ford
moved the engine forward ten inches,
and every other car soon followed suit.
Today the Airflow is practically out of
production, but the better riding, lower
floors, wider doors, and streamlining,
along with hard or slow steering, nose-
heaviness, and long overall length are
found in every car today.
These features, good and bad, are
found in the Lincoln Zephyr, the most
advanced car of 1938. The best-
streamlined and at the same time the
most beautiful, the Zephyr is about the
ultimate in front-engined cars. In the
rear compartment of the Zephyr could
be placed a small powerplant; the first
rear engined cars will look like the
Zephyr.
Rear-engined "streamlined" cars have
been built since 1920, and the Stout
Scarab, built mostly of Ford V-8 parts
and selling for $5000, is now available.
Almost all of these rear-engined cars
are unit-drive, i. e., the engine clutch,
tiansmission, and final drive to rear
wheels are all in one unit. Although
this arrangement makes the control of
the rear units complicated, it simplifies
the drive, and for this reason most of
today's "prophets" forsee rear-engined
rear-driven cars with eventually no
hood. These designs generally seat the
driver between the front wheels with
an odd seating arrangement and with
the powerplant and driving units con-
centrated in the rear. The writer main-
tains that for most efficient use of car
space the front seat will be behind the
front wheel-housings, and the car will
have a hood.
If the car is laid out, as in Fig. 1,
with no thought of powerplant or drive,
the wheels are placed at the corners
cf a passenger compartment which has
43 inch legroom front and rear. The
windshield is placed at the proper dis-
tance from the driver's eye-point, and,
preserving headroom front and rear, we
will proceed from this to design the best
streamlined body with the minimum of
overhang.
The plan view of this arrangement
can be seen in Fig. 1. The overall
width, 72 inches, is about the same as
that of the wider 1938 cars. Because
the wheel-housings are entirely ahead
or behind the seats, the seat width is
limited only by overall width minus
door thickness. Allowing four inches
for the door, a seat width of 64 inches
is entirely practical. This is as wide
for four passengers as 48 inches, average
seat width, is for three. Here, then, is
a car of about average width, carrying
eight passengers.
From the drawing it is evident that
there is a space between the front wheel-
housings and another between the rear
ones big enough for either the engine
or drive components, but not enough
for both. The engine alone will fit in

with the noise and heat problem, and tor
other reasons explained later, it will be
placed in the rear. To place the drive
components in one unit with the engine
would increase the overall length twenty
inches and would concentrate the weight
in one end of the car, leaving it un-
balanced. If, however, the remainder
of the drive system is placed in front,
together with the spare tire and lug-
gage, these units will balance the weight
of the engine in the rear so that the'
car will have the same weight on all four
wheels.
With the transmission units in front,
Ihe drive goes to the front wheels.
Front-wheel drive is known to give a
car definite cornering advantages and
better traction. The car is pulled into
curves instead of being pushed straight
ahead by the rear wheels. In addition
to the driving advantages of the front
drive, the placing of the drive units
ahead of the front floorboards greatly
simplifies the control. Although the
transmission and clutch control will be
semi-auomatic from a finger-tip button,
a gear shift lever on the steering col-
umn (Pontiac, Cadillac, LaSalle, 1938)
can control the transmission directly.
The overdrive cable and the connections
of the semi-automatic gear shift will be
short and direct. The throttle is the
only control under the floor to the rear,
the choke, spark, and all other engine
controls being completely automatic.
This engine will be a small high-speed
air-cooled V-8 engine of ISO cubic inch
capacity, about the same as the Ford
60. It will develop, with the aid of a
supercharger, 100 horsepower, and will
give the 2400 pound car a speed of 100
miles per hour and 25-35 miles per
gallon. This unusual economy and high
power is due not only to the small dis-
placement, high speed, and supercharg-
ing of the engine, but also to the over-
drive. The light weight car obtained
by design features explained later means
a lighter engine which in turn lightens
the car.
This light car weight will be par-
tially obtained by a combination of the
unit body-frame construction of the
Zephyr, and a 5" by 3" oval central
torsion tube. This will eliminate many
of the cross braces now necessary for
torsional rigidity. Through this cen-
tral torsion tube will run the propeller
shaft. Since the front drive units are
mounted on the front of the tube, in-
stead of oscillating on the axle, the
tube does not need to provide clear-
ance for an oscillating propellor shaft.
It is this movement of the propellor
shaft which makes necessary at least
18" clearance from the ground in to-
day's cars. The central tube also pro-
vides a solid mounting for the bearing
which supports the middle of the pro-
pellor shaft, eliminating any possibility
of vibration. Thus tunnel and vibra-
tion, the only two objections to a pro-
[&gt;ellor shaft under the floor, are elimi-
nated.
An independent suspension of the
parallelogram type with variable rate
springs as worked out by the Leaf
Spring Institute of America, in com-
bination with the balanced weight, will
give the car an ease of riding such as
is found in no car today. Independent
suspension gives better riding because
the reduction in unsprung weight allows
the wheels to follow the road surface
more freely without disturbing the car,
and because the springs themselves can
be made softer by the removal of driving
and braking stresses. Independent
springing also reduces total car weight,
improves riding and braking traction,
and reduces tire wear.
The enormous interior space, overall
83" by 52", aided by a raised front
seat, makes possible new ideas in motor-
ing transportation. The front seat will
be 5 inches off the floor, 1^2 inches
above the rear seat, n today's cars the
rear seat must be higher to clear the
oscillating propellor shaft and the rear
axle. In this car, however, the higher
front seat will allow room underneath
tor the rear passengers' toes; the rear
seat may therefore be moved four inches
ahead. Under the seat will also pass
heat from the front seat heater. The
driver, being* higher, will have better
vision both out the windshield and to
the rear over the passengers' heads.
The seats will each be made up of
two 32 inch components holding two
passengers. The driver's seat is on
slides so that it can be moved back and
forth and up and down. The other
three seats rest on large knobbed sur-
faces which prevent their sliding, but
allow them to be moved about on the
wide flat floor. The right front seat can
be turned to face the rear, a table sus-
pended from the ceiling, and one can
serve light meals, typewrite, play cards,
read, or write. The balanced weight
and independent springing give a ride
that makes these things possible at 60
miles an hour or at a standstill. In-
direct interior lighting which does not
interfere with the driver's vision makes
them possible day or night. Also, at
night, the right half of the car can be
made up into a bed, permitting 24 hour
driving in shifts, or the whole car can be
converted into bed 64" by 80", large
enough to accommodate three. In a
car which takes up less space on the
road than almost any car today is a liv-
ing room, dining room, bedroom, office,
or automobile for eight people.
This unusual interior space is made
possible not only through ingenious de-
sign features inside, but also through
proper design of the exterior. The
space, weight and cost of the fenders
and running boards in today's cars are
used to better advantage in this car. The
14 inch floor is low enough so that it is
possible to step directly into the car,
and the wheels are enclosed by the body
structure. All four wheels can be en-
closed through the use of a 56 inch
tread with a 72 inch overall width. The
average wide tread of today, 59 inches,
is necessary to get the 48 inch rear seats
between the wheel-housings. The wheel-
housings on this car can be as large as
necessary to allow the proper turning
angle. The completely enclosed wheels
almost eliminate mud-splashing and
greatly simplify the all-around bumpers

MacklnealxiLity ofi Met&amp;U
by
PROFESSOR O. W. BOSTON
Director of the Department of Metal Processing
IN going through a manufacturing
plant where metals are being proc-
essed by machining, it is impossible for
the layman to realize that each opera-
tion is the end result of long intensive
practice and experimentation.
The cutting properties of a metal in-
volve a number of completely independ-
ent factors. Those of major importance
include the metal being cut, the cutting
tool, the cutting fluid, the process or
type of machine, the size and shape of
the cut, and the general cutting condi-

Drill press dynamometer for measuring troque
and thrust
tions. By changing any one factor, dif-
ferent results will be obtained. One set
of cutting factors will not be satisfac-
tory for machining all metals or even
one metal under all conditions, but
rather a set-up must be selected to yield
results best suited to each case.
These factors are discussed under the
general heading of machinability. Ma-
chinability is a term used to indicate the
relative ease or perfection with which a
metal is cut with a sharp-edged tool, or
a tool or cutting fluid functions in any
metal-cutting operation. It may be eval-
uated in several ways, depending upon
the objective sought. The rating may be
based on:
1. The life of the tool for any given
set of conditions
2. The force, energy, or power re-
quired to machine the metal
3. The torque and/or thrust in drill-
ing, counterboring, threading, etc.
4. The cutability as measured by the
penetration of the tool under constant
feeding pressure
5. The condition of the machined sur-
face- or surface quality
6. The cost of removing a given
quantity of metal under specific condi-
tions
7. The temperature developed at the
tool point
By these tests, metals, tools, or cutting
fluids may be rated. These ratings will
vary when carried out under different
conditions of tests. They should b» car-
14
ried out, therefore, under conditions
similar to those of commercial practice.
METALS
Steels, for example, are sent to the shop
for machining either as cast, forged,
hot rolled, or cold finished. They may-
have almost any physical properties, de-
pending upon their chemical composi-
tion, the melting and casting practice,
and heat treatment either before or af-
ter fabrication. In jobbing shops where
small quantities of steel are being ma-
chined, the desired machining practice
is usually left to the ingenuity of the
operator. In large production plants,
where great quantities of each type of
metal is being machined, attention is
given to all details in order that opti-
mum cutting conditions may prevail.
This may involve special heat treat-
ments for each composition to provide
a structure best suited to accomplish
the desired objective. Many times that
treatment of a given steel which is best
for one operation, as turning, is not best
for another operation, as broaching. In
the case of bar stock, cold working to
increase strength and reduce ductility
further improves the machining proper-
ties of the metal.
TOOLS
Cutting tool materials now being used
consist of a dozen or more different
types, with many brands of each type.
These materials range from high-carbon
tool steel to diamonds. Each type of

which it gives best performance. One
may function best on a metal of a cer-
tain composition, or in operations in-
volving surface quality, fast removal of
metal, long tool life to insure dimen-
sional control, or manufacturing econ-
omy. The tool material considered best
for one manufacturing job may not be
superior in similar operations involving
another metal. Tool quality depends
upon composition, manufacturing prac-
tice, metallographic structure, physical
properties, tool size and form, and de-
gree of sharpness. As these characteris-
tics change, the performance of the tool
also changes.
CUTTING FLUIDS
Cutting fluids comprise liquids, solids.
and gases which are applied to the tool
point to facilitate the cutting operation
by cooling and lubricating. They are
used to accomplish one or several objec-
tives to increase tool life, prevent distor-
tion of the work, reduce power consump-
tion, break up chips and help remove
them, and improve surface quality.
SPONSORS
Because of the complexity of metal
cutting, producers of metal-cutting tools
and cutting fluids and manufacturers of
metal parts, alone or in cooperation, are
seeking constantly to improve industrial
practice. There have been developed in
the Department of Metal Processing of
the University, during the past fifteen
years, special equipment and methods
by which many of these problems have
been solved. Some four thousand ab-
stracted references have been prepared
and indexed for convenient use.
The staff of the department makes
scientific and industrial studies, having
published some forty papers on com-
pleted projects. The Graduate School of
the University has provided funds for
assistants to carry on this work. The
Engineering Foundation, through the
Special Research Committee on the Cut-
ting of Metals of the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers, has been gen-
erous in providing grants for extensive
projects. Many specific problems have
been sponsored by industry through the
Department of Engineering Research of
the University of Michigan.
PROJECTS
A few projects relative to machina-
bility which are under way at this time
may be cited to illustrate the nature of

power on milling machine.
such work. One investigation is being
sponsored by a former student, in which
scrapped high-speed steel is being re-
melted in a special manner and cast into
tool bits. This practice is contrary to the
general method of manufacturing high-
speed tool steel, in which forging and
heat treating are essential steps, yet
these cast tools will outperform the con-
ventional by producing an increased tool
life of several hundred per cent.
An oil company is sponsoring a three-
year investigation, in which the perform-
ance of several types of cutting oils is
sought when turning aluminum, brass,
and plain carbon, Bessemer free-cutting,
and alloy steels. For each metal, tool
life as a function of cutting speed and
power is being determined as the quan-
tity of each oil and the size of cut is
changed. This investigation is of impor-
tance because of the desire of the spon-
sor to obtain fundamental data which
will explain the true action of cutting
fluids. The students working on this job
have an opportunity to become perma-
nently associated with the company
upon graduation.
Two students are working on a
Faculty Research Fund provided by the
Graduate School for the development of
a bimetal cutting tool which, acting as
the thermocouple, registers the temper-
ature developed at the tool point while
under cut. It is expected that this tem-
perature developed under standardized
conditions on different metals will serve
as an index for its commercial machin-
ing. This study has been in progress for
about six years, and several papers giv-
ing results have been presented before
the American Society of Mechanical En-
gineers and the American Society for
Metals. Tests with this tool are under
way in which various cutting fluids are
introduced to learn of the relation be-
tween temperature and tool life under
various degrees of lubrication and cool-
ing.
Another series of tests on cutting
fluids, sponsored by the Engineering
Foundation, is just being finished. One
paper will report the results of tool life
obtained when turning an alloy steel as
the cutting speed, feed, and depth of
cut are changed with each of several
types of cutting fluids. A second paper
will cover the results of surface quality
measurements on the profilograph and
by direct photography for the alloy steel
under several conditions brought about
by thermal treatment as the cutting
speed and cutting fluid are changed.
The Machinability Laboratory of the
Department of Metal Processing is
unique in that there is no other labora-
tory like it. It serves the University in
Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineer-
ing and is available for students inter-
ested in advanced work, as well as to the
industries of the country, for the study
of their problems.

■*■ ing engineer has been heard to re-
mark on the small attention given to the
subject of timber design, in textbooks
and the engineering press. While it is
true that the subject has not widely
been given its merited place, this will
not long continue. Marked stimulus to
construction in timber, in the past few-
years, is noticeable. This has come from
awakened interest in its possibilities.
Timber design today is benefited by
intensive research being conducted in
government, state, and industry labora-
tories. Xo longer do timber structures
necessarily bear the stigma of being
temporary. Now the engineer may with
absolute assurance design his structure
in timber for definite strength and life.
The most staunch advocate of wood
in heavy structures has always been the
railway engineer. We take it as a com-
monplace fact that the railroad systems
of the country depend upon timber for
bridges. This preference is founded on
true economy. The lumber industry and
civil engineers are indebted to the rail-
road men, particularly the American
Railway Engineers' Association, for the
intelligent, vigorous research which it
has conducted in timber design and
use.
The engineering staffs of our state
highway departments, being largely re-
cruited in their beginnings from the
railroads, were quick to see the wisdom
of widespread timber structures. In Cali-
fornia, which is no exception in this
respect, more than five thousand car-
loads of lumber, principally Redwood,
have been used in the erection of high-
way bridges. This has happened in the
short space of ten years.
The engineering student and practic-
ing engineer will find regional lumber
associations, the U. S. Department of
Agriculture and other reliable sources
glad of the opportunity of serving him.
An excellent knowledge of wood and its
place in engineering is available today.

ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE OUR WANING FUEL PROBLEM
by
EDWARD T. VINCENT
Professor of Mechanical Engineering
THE internal combustion engine has
a ravenous appetite. If the quantity
of gasoline that is used for automotive
purposes alone is considered, the figures
are so large that it is difficult for us to
visualize the enormous bulk involved.
When, in addition, we add the fuel used
for marine Diesel and steam plants and
domestic heating burners, we note for
example, that the astounding total
crude petroleum production of the world
for the year 1936 was about 1,790,271,-
000 barrels (each of 42 gallons). At
the present time the main source of
internal combustion fuels is the irre-
placeable hydrocarbons stored in the
earth. Of course, part of the total oil
production undoubtedly goes to storage,
but in any case, the amount consumed
is of serious magnitude. Sufficiently
so, that some consideration must be
given to a possible alternate supply of
fuel.
This is particularly true in those
countries which do not possess oil fields
and have to import all supplies from
foreign powers. At the same time, the
problem is getting some consideration
in the United States, despite the fact
that it produces 61.4% of the world's
petroleum products. Two of the causes
of this attitude are: (1) conservation of
our natural resources; (2) development
of alternative fuels derived from farm
products, thus improving a basic pro-
ductive art.
Estimates of the supplies of crude oil
in the present known fields of the United
States range from ten to fifteen years,
based on present trends of consump-
tion. Such figures, even if the lowest
ones are not counted, should be food
for considerable thought. An exami-
nation of our modern life will soon con-
vince even the casual observer that
failure of supplies of fuel suitable for
internal combustion engines would give
a disastrous setback to our civilization.
Of course there is always the possibility
that new oil fields will be discovered or
that progress will evolve a new type of
power plant in the course of a few years.
Should we sit down with folded arms
and leave the future to look out for it-
self? A little thought and planning
might evolve a new scheme whereby our
known resources could be spread over
a greatly increased period of time. How-
ever, our ideas of what represents mod-
ern automotive practice may have to
undergo some changes, as have already
occured abroad.
Let us picture the average American
automobile weighing some 3500 pounds
that, for most of its life, carries but one
passenger of some 150 pounds. Since
the fuel used without the passenger is
well over 90% of the fuel used with
the passenger, the efficiency of opera-
tion in terms of effective load is very-
low. This poor performance results to
some extent from the demands of the
public. The automobile manufacturer,
if left alone to produce an economical
automobile, would be able to improve
performance in terms of miles per gallon
by 30% at least.
Economic necessity in other countries
has already forced such improvements
due to the high cost of gasoline plus the
taxes imposed on the vehicles. At pres-
ent, we are fortunate in this respect,
but who would be rash enough to proph-
esy that such a condition will never
occur here?
The rapid strides made in the last

engines of the compression ignition type
also hold out possibilities for lengthen-
ing the fuel supplies. It is now com-
monly accepted that engines of this type
will at least double the miles per gallon
of the present gasoline engine, thus
doubling the present possible miles
available if all engines should be
changed over to the Diesel type. That
such a universal change-over will occur
is very doubtful, but without question
economic necessity will soon force the
employment of the power plants of
greatest economy in all applications for
which they are suitable. Undoubtedly
this will result in a great increase in the
number of Diesel engines used for auto-
motive purposes, particularly in buses
and trucks. So far as can be seen at
present there is much to be done before
a Diesel suitable for a passenger car is
available, but even this application
should not be ruled out by our limited
knowledge at the present time.
Conservation of our liquid fuel re-
serves can also be helped by further
scientific progress on the principles of
their manufacture. The chemist doubt-
less yet has many "rabbits in the hat,"
each of which will provide more and
better gasoline per gallon of crude oil.
In addition, means are now claimed to
be available for converting some of the
large supplies of natural gas at present
wasted into liquid fuels suitable for in-
ternal combustion engines.
Coal distillation, another source of
fuel, if carried out under proper unified
control may possibly supply liquid and
solid fuels in sufficient quantities for all
purposes. Some of the oils obtained by
this distillation process are excellent
fuels for engines of the spark ignition
tvoe.
So much for the fuels with which we
are familiar. The second problem, that
of developing alternative fuels which are
at present not generally available, pro-
vides for considerable speculation. The
situation of being able to grow year by
year sufficient fuel for our national re-
quirements represents an ideal toward
which we can aim and to which the
Dictator abroad has been able to force
the attention of all under his control.
If the total consumption of crude oil is
considered, however, it is seen that the
task is rather a large one if we are to
be limited by present known means.
On the other hand, it must be remem-

bered that each country will be helping
out with its own production and the
present situation wherein a few nations
supply the world will no longer apply.
So perhaps the scheme is not so wild as
it may appear at first sight.
If the source of fuel should be found
in vegetable materials, as is quite pos-
sible, then the development of vast
tracts of land now covered with jungle
would step up production many times,
for if some of the fast growing plants
of the jungle should prove suitable for
this purpose, yields will be quite large
per unit of area.
At present vegetable material offers us
a fuel supply of alcohol which is suitable
for properly designed engines. It must
be remembered that alcohol is used
quite extensively in almost all the record
breaking engines. Its general use, how-
ever, is ruled out by its high cost. Nor
does there appear much immediate pros-
pect of its cost being greatly lowered.
The step-up in production necessary to
make the supply equal the demand is a
matter of very serious moment, particu-
larly since the supply would have to be
increased considerably due to the lower
calorific value of alcohol—13,000 b.t.u.
per pound instead of 19,000 for gaso-
line.
The picture of alcohol substitution
for gasoline therefore does not look very
bright, but most methods of attack at
present are built about using a propor-
tion of alcohol blended with hydro-
carbon fuels. This of course does not
permit the full advantage of the super-
ior properties of alcohol as an internal
combustion engine fuel.
Perhaps the compression ignition cy-
cle offers a way out of these difficulties.
An engine of this type will operate on
almost any material which is combust-
ible, including many of the vegetable
oils which can be produced in large
quantities.
Tests have been run with satisfactory
results using both animal and vegetable
fuels such as cod liver oil, whale oil and
palm oil. Considerable experimentation
would be involved before such materials
would be a commercial possibility. In
this event the production of these oils
would have to be increased very mater-
ially or blends of these vegetable and
animal oils would have to be made.
The latter alternative would not mean
stretching the present production meth-
ods beyond practical limits.
The chemist is without a question
going to play a very important part in
fuel development, perhaps even to the
extent of producing a synthetic fuel at
a price within practicable possibilities.
The three possibilities, (1) conserva-
tion of natural fuel resources, (2) devel-
opment of reproducible fuel supplies,
and (3) evolution of chemical fuels;
provide a major field of work from
which much has yet to be gathered.
Looking forward, we see here a very
wide field for future research work; for
research which will determine the future
of the internal combustion engine.

eighth floor. Little sign of flood dam-
age remained other than the high water
line partway up the second story. From
the windows I could see the ruins of
less fortunate buildings which sur-
rounded the studios of WLW.
On May 2, 1934 WLW was permitted
to raise their power to 500,000 watts
as an experiment. Since that time they
have operated as the world's most pow-
erful station; but now the experimental
period is at an end, and this week of
1938 the Federal Radio Commis-
sion meets to determine the fate
of the extra 450 kilowatts.
Several other key stations
have entered applica-
tions to raise their
power to 500 kilo-
watts, and so it
is a momen-
tous deci-
sion that
will hinge on the hearing beginning this
week. This is the reason I sat in the
technical office of WLW that cloudy
April morning and talked with Mr. Mc-
Donald.
"As this experimental period draws
to a conclusion,'' I began, "we are in-
terested in what has been accomplished
- -what difficulties you have overcome."
"We have not encountered any par-
ticular difficulties," he replied. "How-
ever, we shall be glad to show you
around and explain what has been done.
In our studios the improvements that
have been made have not been necessi-
tated so much by the direct increase in
power as by our increase in scope. At
any one point our signal is increased
about 325',; which gives us 1000/r
more coverage than we had previously.
This makes the station practically a
network in itself."
We passed through Studio A, and as
we entered a control room he continued:
"From the microphones the program
comes to a pre-amplifying unit. This
is a new unit we have just designed,
more of which are now being built. You
will notice that the tubes are always
in pairs. Ordinarily the load is
split between them, but if one
goes out the other can bear
the whole load. All the
tubes are connected to
a milliammeter so they
can be tested by
■ — merely pressing
a button. Pre-
viously it
was nec-

essary to plug in connections to test the
tubes. Also the unit is built so that any
section can be pulled out and examined
while still in operation."
"In other words," I inquired, "al-
most anything that might go wrong with
the pre-amplifier while in operation can
be repaired without disconnecting it?"
"That's right, and here is another in-
teresting thing," he said, going to the
control panel. "By placing 'feelers', or
protruding points, on all the dials it is
possible for the control engineer to make
adjustments without taking his eyes
from the artists."
"Speaking of the artists," I said, "it
seems that the two glass plates between
the studio and the control room are
mighty close together. It doesn't look
like they would be soundproof.
"But they are. We have found that
two plates of different thicknesses placed
near together are just as efficient as
two plates of the same thickness placed
a foot or two apart."
"What is the advantage of having
plates of different thicknesses?"
"It prevents sympathetic vibrations
between plates."
Proceeding through the studios we
came upon the recording room. Here
two massive turntables were placed
against the wall. "Why such heavy turn-
tables?" I inquired. "It looks like you
would try to make them as light and
compact as possible."
"That is where you are wrong. We
needed turntables that would run at
exactly 33,^3 rpm in order to get ac-
curate reproduction. There was nothing
adequate on the market and so we de-
termined to build our own."
"Yes, but why such heavy weights?"
"We figured that a heavy weight
would have so much inertia that it
would not be easily influenced by
outside forces."
"Then what you wanted was
something rigidly fastened
to the floor—."

with felt placed between them, and in
addition the legs have rubber blocks set
in them to further insure the elimination
of all extraneous vibrations."
"But all this trouble seems rather
useless unless the motor supplies an
exact speed."
"Exactly. So we use an alternating
current synchronous motor. That is the
motor is synchronized just like an elec-
tric clock. This is geared down by means
of a worm to 33l/z rpm. When we put
the machine in operation we found that
the shaft was transmitting the worm
gear noises to the disc. To offset this
we tried a rubber shaft."
"Well that certainly must have re-
moved that difficulty."
"It did, but it gave rise to another
one. A rubber shaft did not transmit a
constant speed but permitted some os-
cillation of the disc. This was overcome
by striking a compromise, and using
part steel and part rubber. Then this
was topped off with a 78 pound disc on
which the records are placed."
"How could you be sure, though,
that the turntable was running at a
perfectly constant speed?"
"We checked that with a cathode
ray oscilliscope. We recorded a 60 cy-
cle alternating current on a record. Then
we connected the power line to the ver-
ticle plates of the oscilliscope and the
pickup from the record to the horizon-
tal plates. Naturally as long as the speed
of the turntable is constant the two ef-
fects on the oscilliscope balance and
form a straight diagonal line. If the
speed of the turntable varies the line
will be curved."
Thus we passed on through the stu-
dios to the central control room, where
programs are dispatched to the trans-
mitting station . . . This station is
located at Mason, Ohio; and here with
the Chief Transmission Engineer the
tour continued.
"The ordinary procedure in broad-
casting," said Mr. Whitehouse, "is to
generate a high frequency carrier and
modulate it with the program, after
which it is amplified to the power out-
put of the station. Here it was found
advisable to completely amplify the
carrier before it is modulated with the
program."
"Then you add 500 Kw to the am-
plifier, and hence to the carrier, before
you add the voices and music to it?"
. . . use
22 of the
large 100
kilowatt
tubes."

"No. The
amplifier has an
efficiency of only
667c in the final stage,
and if we started with
only 500 Kw we would end
up with only two thirds of
that. Therefore we must have an
input power of about 750 Kw."
"I see: so you start out with a car-
rier and amplify it to 500 Kw. Then
modulate it for broadcasting."
"Not exactly. We first generate the
carrier with a quartz crystal; we must
take great care to control the tempera-
ture and hence the output of this crys-
tal. This is then amplified to 50 Kw,
the former output of the station. We
then use this to operate the new 500
Kw amplifier."
"Isn't this accomplished with the
ordinary vacuum tube just as used in
a receiving set?"
"I would hardly say ordinary, al-
though it is a vacuum tube. We use 22
of the large 100 Kw tubes. Two of these
are used in the 50 Kw amplifier, 12 in
the 500 Kw amplifier and 8 in the modu-
lator. These tubes cost about $40,000
and have an average life of 10,000
hours."
"That cost seems excessive, because
they don't look particularly expensive."
"Hardly. You see an ordinary vacuum
tube has an evacuated glass envelope
which is not difficult to make. But you
will notice that this has the glass en-
velope sealed to a copper base. Since
copper and glass have different coeffi-
cients of expansion that is no mean
feat. An alloy must be placed between
the two which will just exactly make up
the difference and make it possible to
heat the tubes without breaking the
seal."
"I've noticed the tubes seem to get
rather hot."
"Yes, they do; it is necessary to both
water and air cool them. 1400 gallons
of water a minute are circulated through
the cooling system."
"I should think that at least that
part of the process would be simple
and straightforward."
"It is—except that we use a double
cooling system. You see, the tubes have
a potential of 11,500 volts and even a
slight ionizing of the water would drain
off this voltage. We use distilled water
to cool the tubes, city water to cool the
distilled water, and then aerate the city
water to cool it."
"Now about this 500 Kw amplifier.
Suppose one of the tubes burns out,
does the station go off the air?"
"I was coming to that. There are
twelve tubes in three units of four tubes
each. If one unit goes out the eight
tubes remaining supply 333 Kw; thus
the power falls off by one third until
the unit is put back in operation."

terrupted. Bedlam broke loose in the
transmitting station. Lights flashed on
control boards, and the buzz of high
frequency equipment was punctuated
with the sound of high voltage switches.
Quiet for a moment; then the whole
over again. After which routine was re-
stored, and the silence was broken only
by the dulcet tones of an announcer
telling of the amazing qualities of some
product. It was hard to realize that the
entire excitement had consumed hardly
ten seconds.
"What happened?" I asked.
"One of the power-amplifier tubes be-
came overloaded,'' said Mr. Whitehouse.
'"When this happens the power is auto-
matically cut off for three seconds. This
usually permits the tube to cool enough
to remove the overload. This tube was
badly overloaded because it took two
of the three second periods to fix it."
So we continued past the eight modu-
lator tubes which impress the program
on the carrier. Then past two mercury
vapor rectifiers and so along the heavy
cable that led to the antenna.
''The tower is balanced upon two
porcelain insulators placed one above
the other at the base," continued my
host. "It is 831 feet high, higher than
an eighty story building; this is .58 of
the WLW wave length. We have found
that this height gives us the least lost
radiation. The tower has a dead weight
of 125 tons and is held in an exactly
vertical position by eight guy wires
leading down from the midpoint."
"Do you mean to say that that eight
hundred foot tower is balanced on a
small area at the base?"
"Yes, it is balanced on an area of
about one square foot."
"Is it safe?"
"Certainly, as long as the tower re-
mains perfectly vertical, To insure this
the eight guy wires are placed at the
midpoint."
"Then those porcelain insulators at
the base support 125 tons?"
"Certainly not. You have forgotten
the guy wires. Each of these has a ten-
sion of 70,000#. The horizontal com-
ponents, of course, cancel each other,
but the vertical components add, which
increases the load at the base by several
hundred tons."
"Then the load on these insulators
must be well over 500 tons."
"Easily, and that is in still weather,
In high winds the tension in the cables
increases with a corresponding increase
in the load on the insulators."
"Does lightning strike the tower of-
ten?"
"Quite often. To take care of that we
have a ground with a gap to prevent
draining the power off the antenna.
When lightning strikes it jumps the gap
and is grounded."
"Just like on a radio aerial?"
"Yes, but after we built the tower
we learned that, unfortunately, after
lightning starts an arc the half million
watts will keep it going and drain all
the power off the tower. To overcome
this we had to install an electric eye
which is trained on this gap. When
lightning strikes the tower it automati-
cally cuts off the power until the arc is
broken. Speaking of storms, one is com-
ing up now and we had better get
away from the tower."
Sure enough, the sky, which had
threatened all day, seemed about to
make good those threats. As we walked
back to the transmission building I

a^ked about the shield to cut down on
the power in Toronto.
"When we raised our power," he ex-
plained, "the signal was so strong it
interfered with a station in Toronto and
so we had to cut down on the power
there or else drop the whole idea of
operating at 500 Kw."
"I expected to see some sort of physi-
cal shield," I said, glancing around and
finding nothing else but some small
radio towers.
"We could have built a directional
antenna, but that woud have cut off
Columbus, Buffalo and a great deal of
territory that we didn't want to lose.
Therefore, we evolved a method based
upon a simple principle of Physics. You
know that waves add algebraically.
That is, two perfect sine waves 180°
out of phase will exactly cancel each
other."
"I learned that, but I didn't think it
had any practical application."
"It has not been applied exactly like
this before. The waves that arrive at
Toronto do not go directly, but are re-
flected from the heavyside layer. By
computing the height of this layer we
could find the angle of incidence of the
waves arriving in Toronto. What we
were trying to get was the equivalent
of a 50 Kw signal. To do this we found
that we needed an 85 Kw wave 96° out
of phase with the principle signal. It
was then a matter of simple mathe-
matics to compute the positions of the
auxiliary towers."
"You mean you actually worked all
that out so that the wave would be
cut to a 50 Kw equivalent at Toronto,
but not appreciably affected elsewhere?"
"Certainly. We found that two towers
a quarter wave length high, a half wave
length apart, and 1850 feet from the
main tower would give the proper re-
sults."
The storm passed as quickly as it
came, and as we left the building a rain-
bow appeared in the west, silhouetting
the spidery tower against the evening
sky. As I shook hands all around I
suddenly burst out laughing.
"What's the matter?" inquired Mr.
Whitehouse.
"I was just thinking," I replied, "of
something Mr. McDonald said this
morning. He said that you had encoun-
tered no particular difficulties in making
WLW the world's most powerful sta-
tion."
"That's right," he replied innocently,
"it was really very easy."

INITIATIVE
WHEN a child has learned to walk,
he is often given his daily sunning
by putting him in an open-air jail. A
little portable fence, without a floor, is
set down on the grass, and the youngster
is put inside. While he is amused, he
makes pleasant noises. When finally he
becomes bored with the location, he
leans against the fence and roars. (This
is a universal human trait—to set up a
roar about something, yet do nothing
about it.) But once in a while, when
a child is dropped into his little area
for the first time, he at once roars at
the confinement; then quickly goes to
the enclosing fence, hoists one side of
it off the ground, and moves the whole

Initiative is the sparkplug of industry.
contraption to where he wants to go.
That's initiative. Portable fences do not
work out well with such youngsters.
They will have no use for artificial bar-
riers, now or later.
A boy gets a bad case of electric
train, and no one in the family can
lead a normal existence until an order
is sent off. The train and track arrive.
The boy soon discovers that he needs
more track. They always need more
track. One boy adopts the non-initiative
routine of everlastingly asking for more
track. But another boy pops downstairs
to Dad's workshop and sets up a terrific
din. He is using the tin shears to
whack up tin cans into strips; then he
has the very deuce of a time, with pliers,
hammer and vise trying to make more
track like that which he already has.
Tht big idea probably won't work, but
at least, it might have worked; and he
tried, and he learned things in the bar-
gain. Also, when the hardboiled parent
sees all this initiative, he relents and
orders more track.
One boy has to sell papers. He sells
them by yelling, "Paper!", or, "Morn-
ing Heral-1-l-d" But another boy, . . .
let me mention the little Negro boy I
shall never forget. He climbed aboard
our street car one snappy morning years
ago, and sang out,—"Morning Herald!
All about the Murder, Fire, Drowning,
Suicide, and WRECK!" That's initia-
tive.
A freshman comes to take engineering,
and with the need for partly earning
his way. The home folks are very proud
of him, admiring his initiative in work-
ing his way through college. But after
all, this is an extremely common thing
to do; thousands do it every year. It is
a part of the folklore of the country.
This freshman in particular, has long
known that he is up against a four-year
course; so he arrives, seizes one of the
standard jobs, and promptly elects a full-
time schedule. How can he graduate in
four years unless he does carry a full
schedule? And it is a four-year course,
isn't it? As the semester grinds ahead,
he is sadly puzzled to find he is slipping
behind. The end of the semester comes,
and he finds he has made a mess of it.
. . . But his classmate had fewer il-
lusions. The classmate at least fleetingly
entertained the idea that maybe a four-
year course might better be stretched a
bit, if one were largely self-supporting.
The classmate really listened when told
here that his surmise was correct. Thus it
is we find him electing a reduced sched-
ule, taking a longer time to graduate,
and doing things well all the way
through. The first man does not do so
well, what with his bad start, and he
takes longer to get through the "four-
year" course than does his classmate.
It is the second man who really has in-
itiative.
A freshman comes here, as yet inex-
perienced in the game of life as played in
a rooming house. He incautiously takes
a roommate. The roommate turns out
to be a gabby individual who has never
yet concentrated for five minutes, nor
will he permit anyone else to do so. By
the middle of the semester, our fresh-
man is too far behind in his work, ever
to catch up. But another freshman, with
the same circumstances, takes measures.
On Gabby, he patiently tries everything
short of murder; if Gabby remains un-
reconstructed, this freshman has the
initiative to find other places for study-
ing, for this semester only. When the
ordeal ends, he severs the alliance and

mester was not enjoyed, but, scholasti-
cally, neither was it lost.
A freshman may come, lugging a load
of undesirable behaviourisms and per-
sonality defects, and may remain bliss-
fully unaware of their existence and the
extent to which they render him
unacceptable to the group he has
joined. He spends four or five years
associating with individuals who will
tolerate him because they are like him;
and sadly enough, he graduates—in the
diploma sense—all set to spend a bitter
lifetime wondering why everyone has
it in for him. His classmate may come
with an equally large and undesirable
burden of bad traits, but he has the
initiative to observe that he is not
"fitting in," and to discover why not;
in a surprisingly short time he has dis-
carded his unwanted mannerisms and
has won the esteem of his associates.
Let us hasten to add that not many
freshmen enter college with develop-
ments so warped that they fit the above
description.
One senior, at the beginning of his
last year, has learned that engineers
seldom if ever starve to death; therefore,
he expects that in some way he does
not understand, his chosen section of
society must be mysteriously but beau-
tifully organized to the end that he
shall be given a job nine months later,
and that he will be satisfactorily em-
ployed for the next forty years. But he
has a classmate who has some whole-
some doubts about that. When a job
conference is announced, this classmate
attends to see what he can learn. When
a book or article is mentioned, dealing
with the placement problems of grad-
uates, he actually gets hold of it and
reads it. He is aware that a few com-
panies will be recruiting in his depart-
ment later in the year; but he recognizes
that not one of these companies might
happen to want him, that he might not
want to go with any of these companies,
and that after all, there are hundreds
of companies that will not visit the cam-
pus at all. In odd moments therefore,
he leafs through the advertising sec-
tions of trade and society journals, to
find who makes or uses or sells or does
something, and why, and where. In
short, he is realizing that if, as a grad-
uate engineer, he is industrially asleep,
he will not go very far; and that if he
is to be industrially awake as an engi-
neer, he had better become industrially
awake as a student. That's initiative.
In society as a whole, only a small
fraction of the people display great
initiative. The point is, however, that
engineers, even though they number over
100,000 (and as high as 170,000 by one
count) still are a fraction of society;
next, they constitute one of the fractions
in which initiative is expected of a large
majority of the membership.
Far too many engineering students
are inclined to take things as they find
them. Every engineering student should
develop the practice of doing some oc-
casional pioneering,—first, to get the
habit, and second, to keep his hand in.
How to do it? Simply pick out some
wholesome objective whose attainment
would require the use of a little more
courage, imagination, and tenacity than
are normally exercised; then proceed to
attain it. Encouragement will come, out
of all proportion to the effort used or
the real importance of the objective.
Then set up another objective. The
"exercise of initiative" is no idle phrase.
Initiative needs exercising. That is what
makes it grow strong.

ALEX
ALEXANDROVITCH
Twenty years ago Alexander A. Goloff
was born in Siberia. His Russian parents
were of the old regime and changing
political issues forced the Goloff family
to move from one country to another.
Five years later he started his formal
education in a Japanese convent for
girls, stayed in this unusual environ-
ment for two years and then moved to
Australia. From Melbourne he went
to Yokohama, Japan, and attended St.
Josephs College. At sixteen he enrolled
in a Russian Y.M.C.A. in Manchuria
and the next year attended the Poly-
technical of North Manchuria. At the
Y.M.C.A. he met and made a friend of
the American Secretary, Howard L.
Haag who suggested the United States
to "Alex," pulled a few appropriate
strings, and sent the experienced youth
jaunting across a dozen countries and a
few oceans to Grand Rapids Junior Col-
lege. One semester later he enrolled in
the University of Michigan where he is
completing his two years for a mechani-
cal engineering degree.
These are the facts—what about the
man? "Man" is perhaps a misuse of
the word in describing Alex for in spite
of his experience he is young and quite
youthful looking. But in his twenty
years he has packed enough full-blooded
living for ten men. He lived with
Chinese bandits in Manchuria and can
tell of blood-curdling scenes of terror
and cruelty. He speaks Russian, Eng-
lish and Chinese fluently, has an aopre-
ciation of fine music and an under-
standing of current events in the East.
His campus activities include Tau Beta
Pi, the International Club, A.S.M.E.,
engineering research for Professor Bos-
ton, and night cook and dishwasher at
Butterworth Hospital. Alex also had
a few extra-campus activities such as
farming, working in a factory, and more
dishwashing—all of which have helped
toward an almost complete self-support.
Unforseen events have changed his
life's course so many times that Alex
has no long range plan for the future.
His ability as a student has been proved
and if he keeps his globe-trotting down
to a reasonable pace he will surely prove
himself in industry.
COFF
One would never suspect this un-
assuming senior class president of com-
ing from the mighty wilderness of west-
ern Tennessee. Yet, if you listen to his
smooth style of talk for a few minutes
you will have no doubt about his being
one of those truly southern gentlemen.
We can be safe in saying that Goff
is a B.M.O.C., without a shadow of a
doubt. Perhaps some of you will re-
member that he was the fashion pattern
featured in one of the early GAR-
GOYLES of last semester. But more
important than that is the fact that he
is known as a leader in campus activi-
ties. He figures prominently as a Cadet
Colonel in the R.O.T.C, and also as a
first lieutenant in Scabbard and Blade.
In his sophomore year he became pro-
ficient enough as a marksman on the
R.O.T.C. rifle team to win a medal. His
other activities are several and varied.
He is the treasurer of Sigma Chi fra-
ternity; belongs to Tau Beta Pi, Vul-
cans, Triangles, and Michigamua; and
was the Managing Editor of the
TECHNIC for the past year. He has
served on the junior staff of the Inter-
fraternity Council, and was on the com-
mittee for the Ball of last year. In his
second year here he was on the Slide
Rule Dance committee, and for the past
two years he has been on the Military
Ball committee. During his sophomore
and junior years he was elected to the
Honor Council, and was chairman of
that for one year.
It would be unfair to give the im-
pression that Goff does nothing but con-
fine himself to the work in the engine
school. While at home, his hobby is
bird hunting and he has all sorts of
pictures to prove that he thoroughly
enjoys the sport. Of course, when in
school he has to have something else to

fallen prey to quite a few blind dates on
the campus. On this subject, about all
he says is that, "Those days are over."
Somehow or other, while on one of his
"blind" dates he is reputed to have felt
romantic enough to wander blindly
through the tulip beds near Martha
Cook. Maybe he just wanted to get
away from it all.
Next year Goff is planning to return
to school for his fifth year in the Busi-
ness Administration and Engineering
curriculum. He is more than enthusias-
tic about the University of Michigan,
and he will be glad to come back to the
familiar campus for his final year.
OSWALD
Sydney (with a "y" please) Oswald
Steinborn was born and raised in De-
troit. That is admittedly not phenome-
nal and wasn"t his fault anyhow. How-
ever, Syd has managed to cover ground
pretty well under his own power since
then. While getting his readin' and
writin' fundamentals, he spent his after-
noons and Saturdays helping the family
budget along. After graduating from
high school, he went to work for two
years as a night watchman, a steel
worker, and an auto laborer. During
these two years he attended Wayne
University night school.
Then Syd decided to go to college,
and entered Michigan as a freshman.
He enrolled in Civil Engineering and
is majoring in hydraulics. He started
things off right by being elected to Phi
Eta Sigma, freshman honorary, and be-
came its vice-president. In his junior
year he followed up admirably by be-
coming a Vulcan and a member of Tau
Beta Pi. Most recently he has been
elected to Phi Kappa Phi, all campus
senior scholastic honorary. Syd is a
member of the A.S.C.E. and has served
on its executive council for the past
two years, besides being a member of
the Engineering Council and editor of
the Gew Gaw. From the social side we
find Syd on the Slide Rule dance com-
mittee for two years, and serving as its
chairman this last April.
This past year Syd climaxed his four
years on the MICHIGAN TECHNIC
by performing as its Editor-in-Chief. As
the man behind the helm, Syd's catch-
ing enthusiasm and downright dogged-
ness has pulled the mag through many
a tight spot. His earnest fire will take
him places and we hope he has left some
of it with us.
Syd has earned his way through col-
lege, by holding down an N.Y.A. job
for four years, and being a student as-
sistant in Geodesy and Surveying. He
was awarded the Donovan Scholarship
in his junior and senior years. He spent
his sophomore-junior and junior-senior
summers at Camp Davis. His first year
there he was a member of the famous
Party Eight and his second year he
served as a student assistant. When he
graduates in June, he will get a B.S.
in both Civil Engineering, and Geodesy
and Surveying.
S.O.S. likes to travel, and is not too
particular about how he gets there. He
once rode the boxcars five hundred miles
from Eastern Idaho to Western Oregon.
At the start of the trip he missed a fast
freight and had to spend the night on
a slow local. He felt pretty bad about
it until he learned that the faster train
was subsequently wrecked! For recrea-
tion Syd likes to read travel books,
dream of tremendous watershed de-
velopments, and hope that his '37-'38
TECHNIC will again take first place in
the E.C.M.A.—we'd like that too.

INSTITUTE OF ENGINEERING
MECHANICS
The Engineering Mechanics Depart-
ment takes pleasure in sponsoring, this
summer session, a number of advanced
courses and symposiums in mechanics
sion by outstanding authorities in their
resp;ctive fields. Among the authorities
to be present are Professor S. Timo-
shenko, formerly of Michigan and now
at Stanford University; Professor Von
Karman of California Institute of Tech-
nology; and Professor L. S. Jacobson
of Stanford University.
In the field of advanced mechanics.
Professor Jacobson will present a course
in Earthquake Dynamics which will deal
with the measurement of ground move-
ments during earthquakes. The effects
of earthquakes on buildings and ideal-
ized buildings considered as cantilever
beams will also be studied. In addition,
the experimental and theoretical ap-
proaches to the design of earth-quake
proof structures and buildings will be
considered.
Pure bending of plates, bending of
plates by lateral load, differential equa-
tions of equilibrium, boundary condi-
tions; these are but a few of the topics
which will be included in Professor
Timoshenko's course of Theory of
Tlates. Special problems in engineering,
especially of holes in applied elasticity
and aerodynamics, will be considered in
Professor Von Karman's course.
The symposium on Properties of Ma-
terials will be conducted by Professor
Timoshenko. The subject matter to be
discussed: new developments in fatigue
tests, fatigue problems in railway engi-
neering, surface conditions and surface
fatigues, new developments in photo-
elasticity, the use of models in structural
design, etc.
A/ote5 ofo the
RAILROAD RESEARCH
Despite the unfavorable financial
standing of the railroads, research along
several lines is being undertaken by
railroad maintenance engineers this
year. One important project to be stud-
ied is the subject of stresses in tracks,
which is now becoming a vital problem
to the engineers. Another is the methods
used in the manufacture of rails, as
well as the continuous welding of rail
joints. At the University of Illinois
study is being made of end-batter tests
of rails. In that college a rolling-load
machine has been developed in the
laboratory to aid in the studies. The
tests made reveal that it is necessary to
have the Brinell hardness within the
range of 300 to 4S0 in specially treated
rail ends. Above the upper limit scaling
begins, and below the lower limit there
is little or no improvement noted.
LARGER MOTORS
As airplanes increase in size, and
their motors become correspondingly
more powerful, the length and weight
of the propellors must also be increased,
until in the near future a maximum will
be reached, beyond which this weight
will be a serious problem. Army aero-
nautical engineers are working with a
possible solution for this difficulty. They
found that by mounting two propellors,
one behind the other, on concentric
shafts which rotated in oppositie direc-
tions, the size of the propellors could
be cut in half. A difficult engineering
problem is represented in the construc-
tion of the two shafts, one of which
must be inside the other and rotate in
the opposite direction. Once this mech-
anism is perfected much can be ex-
pected, for the only plane in existence
today using this tandem arrangement is
the Italian seaplane which set the
world's record of 440.68 miles per hour
in 1934.

HUGE—YET UNIFORM IN PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
Necessity hastens many a discovery. When deep
drilling in the oil industry created the need of extra-
heavy, extra-durable drill collars, their service
requirements and economical construction presented
some new machine-shop problems. Among them was
the finding of a steel which could be heat treated in
long, massive chunks (sometimes 8 tons and 40 to 50
feet long) to produce uniform high physical properties
and yet be readily machinable.
Chrome-Molybdenum (SAE 4140) steel proved the
solution. It is widely chosen for this purpose because:
(a) It develops the requisite physical properties, (b) It
responds well to heat treatment—hardening uniformly
through the large sections involved, (c) Its machin-
ability at the relatively high hardness is excellent,
(d) It is not susceptible to temper brittleness. And
— with all its unusual fabricating and service quali-
ties, it is comparatively inexpensive.
PRODUCER
Have you heavy-forging problems involving peculiar combinations of service and fabricating requirements?
There's a Moly steel, most likely, that's exactly suitable. Investigate. Our free book, "Molybdenum
in Steel," will prove helpful. Climax Molybdenum Company, 500 Fifth Avenue, New York City.

which will take all the traffic scrapes.
From the top of the bumper, both
front and rear, the entire deck panels
open to give access to the compartments.
On a smooth floor over the front axle
is the spare tire and room for more lug-
gage than in almost any car today.
Differing mainly from the front deck
by its cooling louvres, the rear deck
makes accessible the engine and the
gas and oil filler caps. Just over the rear
deck is a glass-faced, illuminated, en-
closed space for a license plate.
For the most efficient use of road
space, the edge of the front toeboard
will be behind the front wheel-housings,
and the rear seat will be ahead of the
rear wheel-housings. It is on this point
that this car differs from almost every
other predicted car of the ''future." The
car will have a hood because the wind-
shield is fixed at a definite distance
from the driver's eyes and is a consider-
able distance behind the front axle. To
move the windshield, seat, and driver
any farther forward would narrow the
front seat from four to two passengers,
would induce a pitching action from the
front axle, would eliminate luggage
space or place it at a less efficient point,
would make entry to the front seat more
difficult, and would concentrate engine
and driving units in the rear, making for
instability and complicated control.
In the rear-engined front-drive cars
here submitted there are the following
advantages: (1) Better weight distri-
bution for better riding, better stability,
and easier, faster steering. (2) Front
drive for better traction and corner-
ing. (3) Simplified control with no rods
under the floor. (4) Collision and tor-
sional strength from unit-body frame
with central torsion tube. (5) A com-
bination of speed, acceleration, and
economy unheard of today. (6) Easy
handling in traffic with no worry about
scraped fenders. (7) Small overall size
with 118" wheelbase, 180" overall
length, and 72" overall width. (8) In-
terior room with living, dining, office,
or sleeping quarters, in addition to full
traveling comfort for eight people and
their luggage.

various classes of benefited property
and individuals.
(2) The distribution of that portion
of total highway costs chargeable to
motor vehicles as a class among the spe-
cific vehicles within that class.
(3) An allocation to each of the three
classes of roads and streets of a just and
reasonable proportion of the money con-
tributed by each type or class of vehicle.
(4) A study of the economic location
and design of new construction and re-
construction.
(5) An actual programming of eco-
nomically desirable present and future
highway improvements and extensions,
and the determination of a priority ba-
sis for their construction.
The proper consideration of these
problems will make possible a decision
as to what system of various classes of
highways we need, what it will cost to
own and operate that system, and who
should pay for it.

S.P.T.
Sigma Rho Tau, honorary speech
society for technical men, has enjoyed
a steady growth since its birth on our
campus, in 1929. The Alpha Chapter
at Michigan known as the Stump
Speakers' Society, has won an enviable
number of intercollegiate contests. This
year, at the National Convention, held
May seventh at Wayne University, De-
troit, they swept first and second places
in every major contest.
It is the boast of Stump Speakers'
Society that it has more men engaged
in speech training than are out for foot-
ball. Training is strenuous and honors
are awarded only for noteworthy
achievement. The aim of the organiza-
tion is to insure a closer bond of under-
standing between the applied scientist
and the general public through the
development of speech activities among
colleges of architecture, engineering, and
technology. The fields in which "note-
worthy achievement" of interest to this
organization may be accomplished are:
1. The preparation and delivery of
debates on subjects of interest to
engineers.

2. The exposition and defense of en-
gineering projects.
3. The delivery of appreciated
speeches on great engineers or
their achievements.
4. Preparation and delivery of lec-
tures on engineering subjects.
5. The development of the art of the
raconteur.
6. Constructive work in the organiza-
tion of speech activities.
S.A.E.
The latest among student branches of
technical engineering societies on cam-
pus is the Society of Automotive En-
gineers. Established approximately a
semester ago, its activities have been
numerous and interesting. Original
plans of the society were to have the
majority of meetings in the form of
forums based on presentations of papers
on various topics by the students. How-
ever, the officers soon found that such
an undertaking would be futile, so they
directed their efforts to securing out-
side speakers. Among these were Mr.
W. B. Stout of the Stout Engineering
Laboratories, and Professor Vincent.

Perhaps the most interesting part of
such an organization is the trips that it
sponsors to various engineering plants
and other points of interest. The most
important of these and one that the
society is looking forward to with in-
terest is the Indianapolis 500 mile race
which comes on Memorial Day.
APPLIED PHYSICS
Application of Physics plays an im-
portant role in industry today, and
among Michigan's physicists who have
directed their aims to that end are Pro-
fessor H. B. Vincent and Professor R. A.
Sawyer.
Their latest undertaking is the ap-
plication of spectroscopy to the metal
industry for rapid analysis of metals.
The present study deals with cast iron
containing from 3% to 7% aluminum.
Since chemical methods are able to de-
termine the amount of aluminum in the
casts only with great difficulty and in-
accuracy, the authors investigated the
analysis of aluminum spectrographi-
cally, using the condensed-spark source
developed for foundry control. It soon
was established that analyses could be
carried out with good accuracy, since
readings proved repeatable with ade-
quate fidelity, but no samples of known
composition were available for calibra-
tion. Plots of spectrographic readings
against analyses performed by chemical
wet methods gave erratic results.
A set of special melts, following a
very careful mixing practice, was tested
spectrographically, and it was found,
from the spectrographic readings alone,
that each melt had suffered a loss of
aluminum proportional to the total
amount of aluminum added to the ladle.
The per cent recovery of aluminum
shown by all available chemical analyses
varied from SO to 100 per cent, but
gave an average of about 83 per cent.
A calibration curve was drawn assuming
a recovery of 83 per cent to be correct,
and it was found possible to analyse
for aluminum as readily as for other
metals. While the determinations may
involve a systematic error due to the
lack of satisfactory calibration samples,
the analyses are consistent and repeat-
able and the accuracy is certainly much
better than that if the chemical analy-
ses on which the calibration is based.
THE WINNER
"I don't want to make a habit of
this,'' said the Chairman of the ECMA
last November as he awarded the
TECHNIC the third of the five awards
presented at the annual convention.
These awards were for the best covers,
best illustration, and the best-all-around
magazine.
Apparently, however, it is being made
a habit for at the annual Gridiron ban-
quet at Cambridge, Massachusetts, the
MICHIGAN TECHNIC was awarded
the T.E.N, cup as the "finest under-
graduate scientific and engineering mag-
azine of the year."
The T.E.N, cup is presented annually
by the Tech Engineering News of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The cup was presented to Sydney Stein-
born, '38E, retiring Editor-in-Chief, at
the banquet held on May 12, at which
the principle speaker of the evening was
Mr. Walter Harrington, National Ad-
vertising Manager of the New York
Times.

DEW-POINT POTENTIOMETER
DEW ou the grass may be fiue for the farmers
and an indication of fair weather, but it has no
place in metal heat-treating furnaces. Moisture in
the atmosphere in furnaces causes corrosion on the
metal, thus decreasing the size of the part. Because it
is impossible to tell the amount of moisture in such a
furnace by sticking your hand into it. General Elec-
tric engineers have developed a dew-point potenti-
ometer to do this job, and do it accurately.
The potentiometer consists of a metallic mirror
located in a small chamber into which gas from the
furnace is passed and condensed on the mirror. By
means of a thermocouple, a balancing circuit, and a
direct-reading meter, the weight of water vapor per
cubic foot of gas may be derived. Thus the furnace
operator can tell if the furnace atmosphere is suit-
able for the treatment of the metal.
Many of the G-E developmental engineers working
on this and similar apparatus are former Test men.
The General Electric Test Course augments the
theoretical training received by engineering grad-
uates, giving them a practical training in in-
dustry.

SPEEDY FLIES
%' ~. O I ''HERE are many legends of nature which have

entomologist calculated the speed of the deer bot-
fly to be 800 miles per hour. Digressing from his
usual type of experiments, Dr. Irving Langmuir,
Nobel Prize winner in the General Electric Research
Laboratory, exploded this entomological myth by
means of a series of tests.
Using a piece of solder the size and shape of a deer
botfly, Dr. Langmuir showed that if this insect
traveled at 800 miles per hour it would encounter a
wind pressure of 8 pounds per square inch—enough
to crush it, and that maintaining such a velocity
would require a power consumption of one-half horse-
power—a good deal for a fly. He also demonstrated
that the insect would be invisible at speeds in excess
of 60 miles per hour, vet the entomologist estimated
the speed of the fly at 400 yards per second because
he saw a brown blur pass by his eyes. Finally the
calculations showed that if the fly, while traveling
at this speed, struck a human being, it would pen-
etrate the skjn with a force of four tons per square
inch and bury itself deep in the flesh.
ATOMff

BOMBARDING ATOMS
The modern miracles of aviation, television, and
World's Fairs are taken quite calmlv in this twen-
tieth century of progress. But it is a different matter
when scientists start snapping the whip with ions to
smash ultramicroscopic particles called atoms into
even more minute portions. \nd that's just what
scientists are doing over at Harvard University.
Using a machine called a cyclotron, devised by Prof.
Lawrence of the University of California, the Har-
vard physicists are bombarding atoms by accelerating
ions to a tremendous speed and shooting them out
through a hole in the side of the machine. But
people are talking about this barrage of ionic
ammunition because the results have proven success-
ful in the treatment of cancer.
This is the third of such atom-smashing machines
for which the General Electric Company has fur-
nished parts. Even in such academic and highly
specialized fields. Test men are called upon to make
their contributions.

YOU ARE LOOKING at one of the wonders
of nature. These glittering crystals are
magnesium, a metal as amazing in its
qualities as any ever discovered by man.
No other metal offers industry such an
extraordinary array of virtues—including,
for example, incredible lightness along
with strength and durability sufficient for
heavy duty loads.
As a consequence, Dowmetal, which
designates a group of magnesium alloys
developed and produced by Dow, is now
extensively used in the manufacture of a
wide variety of products. These include
airplane parts, vacuum cleaners, type-
writers, portable tools, foundry flasks,
photographic equipment and reciprocat-
ing parts in many types of machinery.
The unbelievable lightness of Dow-
metal is, of course, a major characteristic.
An alloy that is one-fourth the weight of
iron and a full third lighter than alumi-
num, and yet is so remarkably strong,
the maatc of mAGnesium
must necessarily be of immense impor-
tance to industry. But extreme lightness
is by no means its only amazing quality.
Dowmetal is the easiest of all metals to
machine. This means lower costs of
manufacture. It means machines can run
at top speed in turning out parts made of
Dowmetal. It means far wider applica-
tion— much greater usefulness.
But there are still other important
advantages. With Dowmetal, corrosion
is a negligible factor and these alloys
accept protective and decorative coatings
when desired. Furthermore, Dowmetal
is so versatile it can be sand cast, die cast,
forged, rolled, extruded and welded.
When Dow began manufacturing mag-
nesium alloys they cost several dollars a
pound. Today the price per pound of
Dowmetal is quoted in cents.
This fact emphasizes once again Dow's
unique ability, through unsurpassed tech-
nical resources, to develop for industry
products of exceptional economic value.
So true is this of Dowmetal that as the
virtues of these alloys have become more
widely known the use of Dowmetal has
expanded from a few thousand to several
million pounds a year.

The Engineering Council is asking
the student body of the college of En-
gineering to make a vital decision. You
will be asked soon to vote upon a pro-
posal which, if passed, will entirely
change the structure of class offices in
the Engine School. The plan, explained
in detail elsewhere on this page, will
have as its major consequence the re-
placement of all class officers with
Engine Council Representatives.
It will be the duty of the men elected
to represent their class on the Council.
They will be required by the Council
to organize and conduct a program of
class activity. They will in addition act
as two of the three members of the
class dance committee. The third mem-
ber of the dance committee will be
elected at the same time as the Council
Representatives.
What will all this mean to the Engine
School? Obviously there will be a cen-
tralization of authority and much addi-
tional power will be handed to the
Engineering Council. The objection will
probably be raised that the Council
could use this power selfishly. Others
may feel that they would be turning
over to the Council their right of self-
government.
Before going further into the pro-
posed plan, let's look at the setup now
in use. Under the present system, two
or more political groups present a slate
for the approval of the student body.
The result is generally a clean sweep
for one group or the other. For the rest
of the year the leaders of the victorious
faction "run" the campus. But of what
does "running" the campus consist?
With the exception of the dance com-
mittee members, who have some defi-
nite work cut out for them, the elected
officers accomplish little.
The majority sit back and bask in
the glow of their "hard-won" laurels.
When was the last time that any class
activity was well planned and well con-
ducted? When was the last time that
ice5
These arc the essential points of the
changes upon which the students will
vote:
1. All class officers will be abolished.
2. Each class will be represented in-
stead by members on the Engineering
Council. The Freshman Class will be
represented by two members serving for
one year only. Each of the other classes
will elect one representative for one
year and one to serve the rest of his
college term. Thus the Sophomore Class
will have two representatives, the Junior
Class three, and the Senior Class four.
3. Students desiring election to these
positions shall present petitions to the
Engineering Council giving qualifications,
plan of activities, and the signatures of
twenty-five supporters. The council will
select the six men considered best quali-
fied from the petitions submitted for
each class. These names will be an-
nounced on the morning of the election.
4. The three men receiving the most
votes in each class will be the three mem-
bers of the dance committee. The one
with the highest number of votes shall
receive the long term Council position
and shall be dance chairman when the
chairmanship is in the Engineering Col-
lege. The man with the next highest
number of votes shall receive the short
term Council position.
5. Honor council members will be se-
lected by the class representatives with
the approval of the Council. Class dues
will be collected by the Council finance
committee.
class games were a notable success? The
class officers should have been the lead-
ers in seeing that these activities were
conducted smoothly. In some cases an
honest effort has been made to ac-
complish some of these ends. In others,
absolutely none. In either case the offi-
cers have had a difficult job because of
the lack of proper support. This is the
natural result of the leaders being sup-
ported by a political minority rather
than by the school as a whole. Such a
group is seldom closely knit anyway,
racked as it is by petty jealousies.
Consequently even if the officers do feel
the heroic urge to do something for
their class, they are handicapped by a
lack of coordinated support.
If the proposed plan be put into
effect, there will be a strong coordi-
nated Council of 26 students and S
faculty members. Eleven of the student
members will be elected as explained
herein and the rest will continue to be
selected by the various honor and pro-
fessional societies of the Engine School.
This group will not only actively sup-
port the action of class leaders, but will
see to it that class leaders institute
action.
The objection has been raised that
too much power will be put in the
hands of the Council. What happens
now? The power goes not into the
hands of a duly elected legislative body,
but rather into the hands of the lead-
ers of the political group which is able
to shake its half-hearted followers
out of their lethargy and get them to
the polls. Where would you rather
lodge the administrative power for the
school? In the hands of four groups of
politicians, or in the hands of a group
duly elected from the school as a
whole?
This whole proposal is the result of
a growing sentiment in the Dean's
office—a sentiment that has been rap-
idly developing into an ultimatum. The
Deans, as well as the students, are
growing disgusted with the present state
of affairs. In fact, as things stand now,
the student governmental bodies on the
whole campus have been given one year
in which to clean things up. Otherwise
the Dean's office will do the cleaning
up in their own efficient manner. To
forestall this possibility in the Engine
School, several members of the Council
spent a great deal of time over the
summer working on the problem and
finally evolved the above plan. The
Deans have given their whole-hearted
approval, and the cooperation of other
groups has been secured. The IM de-
partment has promised the use of all
its facilities in setting up a program of
inter-class sports. The Men's Council
has agreed to turn the whole adminis-
tration of the Engine School over to the
Engineering Council. In short, for the
first time, the activities of this school
would be run entirely by Engineers
with no interference from the Lits. It
certainly represents a sincere effort to
take a step in the right direction and
merits the support of the whole College.
At any rate, it is your duty as a
citizen of the College of Engineering to
express your opinion in this election.

Assistant Director oi Research

INDUSTRIAL research may be de-
fined as the investigation by techni-
cally and scientifically trained person-
nel of technical problems which arise
in industry. Such work ordinarily is
conducted by laboratory organizations
connected with universities, govern-
ment bureaus, and industrial organiza-
tions. The problems which arise might
be classified in four general groups,
namely: (1) reduction in cost of pro-
duction; (2) improvement in quality
of products; (3) development of new
products and processes, and (4) devel-
opment of new applications of prod-
ucts. Space does not permit discussions
on each of the four classes of research,

The young engineer who is completing
his technical training is faced with a
decision as to what type of work he
wishes to follow. Unfortunately many
engineers making this decision do not
have a clear conception of the type of
work which is encountered in the vari-
ous branches of their profession and
therefore may enter into work with which
they may later become dissatisfied.
In the hope that it will help the stu-
dents at Michigan to make a wise de-
cision, the TECHNIC is presenting a
series of eight articles dealing with the
major functions of the engineer. It is
the purpose of these articles to present
clearly the conditions that will be en-
countered in industry and the future
which faces the engineer in each of
these functions.
"Only a small
percentage
of industrial
research
is conducted
by engineers
in white."
but a rather general discussion of work
applicable to each class is given below.
Research leads the way for industrial
progress. The industry of tomorrow is
in the laboratory today. Thus research
is indeed a fertile field for the applica-
tion of original ideas and an analytical
mind is therefore very desirable. The
course of research is directed by the
needs and demands of industry; conse-
quently the problems which the re-
search engineer faces change quite
rapidly. He must be alert to observe
the need for new products and pro-
cesses, and develop them. The research
engineer must assume this responsibility
because ordinarily others are not in a
familiar enough position to make these
observations. Patience and hard work
are essential. The successful research
engineer does not work by the clock.
He should be a leader and have a deep
seated desire to lead the way.
Research work probably entails a
broader application of academic train-
ing than any other branch of engineer-
ing. Furthermore the engineer entering
research should understand thoroughly
that he has just begun his technical
education and when this education is
completed he is ready for retirement.
Contrary to common belief only a
very small percentage of industrial re-
search work is conducted in test tubes,
beakers, etc., by chemists and engineers
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


very large percentage of research is
conducted on plant scale equipment by
engineers and chemists wearing old
clothes which become soiled rather
rapidly. Also a considerable portion of
research is conducted with pencil and
paper. For example the research engi-
neer might be assigned the problem of
improving the performance of a cer-
tain unit in the plant. Probably the
first step will be to make a test on this
unit as it is operating. After he has
secured all the necessary data he will
then make calculations on the perform-
ance. Heat and material balances might
be advisable. A comparison of actual
operation with what is theoretically pos-
sible will then indicate how much im-
provement might be obtained. Economic
calculations will show the potential
saving or profit and indicate whether
it is worthwhile to continue the prob-
lem. If the potential profit is large the
next step will be to determine the
causes of poor performance and meth-
ods of eliminating them. A thorough
understanding of the underlying theory
d? operation of the unit will be of great
help in this study.
The research engineer may therefore
be involved in test work in the plant,
calculations on the performance of
plant equipment, calculations on the
economics of changes to improve the
performance and design calculations on
the proposed changes. It is apparent
that this will involve a rather free use
of technical theory as well as a knowl-
edge of the limitations of theory.
Another type problem which the re-
search engineer may encounter is the
investigation of a new process which at
the time may be only an idea based on
certain theoretical considerations. The
investigation probably will begin on
small laboratory equipment and if posi-
tive results are obtained it may then
be investigated on a pilot plant scale.
Data obtained on the pilot plant may
then be used for economic and design
calculations in considering the installa-
tion of a full size commercial unit. The
research engineer will be involved in
the problem from the time the idea was
first considered until the full size com-
mercial unit is in operation and even
then it will be his responsibility to
maintain operation on the most profit-
able basis.
In research it is in general rather
"He should
remember that
it is his
company and
its progress
is his progress."

difficult to define sharply the responsi-
bilities which the engineer has. Thus
research is a field in which the engineer
can shirk his work without its becoming
apparent immediately. However this
will become evident later on because
results will not be obtained. Needless to
say industry employs research engineers
because of the expected profit on their
services. If this profit is not realized,
continued employment is difficult to
justify.
Initially the salary of the research
engineer is dependent upon the amount
and quality of his technical training
and previous experience. However the
initial salary in research is of about the
same magnitude as that obtainable in
other branches of his profession. Ad-
vancement in salary on the other hand
is probably slower in research than in
some of the other branches such as
patent work, sales and design. Never-
theless research work does not fluctuate
during business cycles as does work, for
example, in sales, and design. During
periods of prosperity the sales engineer
and design engineer may receive a
somewhat higher salary than the re-
search engineer, but during periods of
depression the sales and design engi-
neers may find themselves on a much
reduced salary if not out of work en-
tirely. During pericxls of depressions
the research engineer can be of great
help to his company in reducing costs
of production and it is this class of
lesearch problems which receives much
attention during depressions. Thus over
a complete business cycle the salary of
the research engineer may compare
favorably with salaries received in other
fields of engineering.
The research laboratory is excellent
training ground for future executives.
Administrative work of course is on a
higher salary level than any other work
in which the engineer may become en-
gaged. However, such positions are not
filled by inexperienced engineers. They
are filled by engineers who have shown
that they are capable of carrying the
necessary responsibilities and who have
the required perspective of the business
of their company.
Advancement in the research organi-
zation itself and later to administrative
and executive positions will depend
largely on the individual. The six fol-
lowing qualifications might be consid-
ered as an index of advancement:
1. Ability to assume as well as ac-
cept responsibility.
2. Amount of supervision required.
3. Ability in original thought.
4. Ability to effect rapid and satis-
factory completion of assignments.
5. Amount of energy and enthusiasm
possessed.
6. Ability to inspire others.
Each of these qualifications justifies
discussion and will be considered fur-
ther in the order given.
1. There are many people who avoid
making decisions because of the fear of
making a mistake. Those who let this
fear influence them are not qualified for
administrative positions. One should
realize in the beginning that he is going
to make errors and plenty of them. The
only people who do not make errors are
those who never do anything to pro-
mote progress. The engineer should
realize that he will make errors but
should strive to limit them as far

AN examination of the various ap-
• plications of power conversion
today will reveal that the Diesel engine
offers a very serious threat to the su-
premacy of steam power in some
fields—a supremacy that was univer-
sally acknowledged twenty years ago—
and that it promises to offer serious
competition to the gasob'ne engine in
other fields. Advocates of Diesel power,
gratified by each new forward step in
the development of the Diesel engine,
have sometimes been over-enthusiastic
in predicting the scope of its applica-
tion. Nevertheless, it must be admitted
that the Diesel engine occupies a place
of prominence in the field of power
engineering today, and that the extent
of its usefulness has not as yet been
fully realized.
It was nearly fifty years ago that the
oil engine that is now known as the
Diesel was invented and produced by
Emil Capataine. The Diesel specifica-
tions, drawn up by Dr. Rudolph Diesel,
made their appearance in 1892. The
inventor was nearly killed when he at-
tempted to start his first engine. This
engine was designed to use coal dust as
a fuel, and there was no water jacket
because it was desired to obtain a high
thermal efficiency. The first successful
Diesel engine was built by the Augs-
burg Works in Germany in 1895. After
his initial effort, Dr. Diesel contributed
very little to the improvement and de-
velopment of his engine and appeared
to have lost all interest in it by the
time of his death in 1913. The original
patents expired in 1906, and several
years later American engineers and
manufacturers began to enter the field.
By 1930 it was estimated that there
were 3,500,000 horsepower of Diesel
engines in operation in the United
States.
The Standards of the Diesel Engine
Manufacturers' Association defines the
Diesel engine as "an internal combus-
tion engine in which the fuel, injected
after compression is practically com-
pleted, is ignited solely by the heat re-
sulting from the compression of the air
supplied for combustion." From this it
is apparent that practically the only
structural differences between the Diesel
engine and other internal combustion
engines exist in the fuel system and in
the method of ignition. In the gasoline
engine the fuel is volatilized, mixed
with air in the correct proportions, and
is then drawn into the cylinder and
compressed. In the Diesel engine the
higher ratio of compression—about fif-
teen to one as contrasted with the six
to one ratio of the gasoline engine—
raises the temperature prior to combus-
tion to about 1000° F. Since the fuel
burns at about 450° F., it is necessary
to inject the fuel—under a pressure of
about 15,000 pounds per square inch
and a corresponding velocity of thir-
teen miles per minute—after compres-
sion of the air supplied for combustion
is nearly completed. To accomplish
this, the fuel-metering pump, delivery
tubing, and spray nozzles of the Diesel
engine replace the carburetor and in-
take manifold of the gasoline engine.
The compression ignition of the Diesel
engine eliminates the need for the
complicated spark ignition system of
the gasoline engine, or the uncooled
tube, bulb, or plate of the surface ig-
nition engines.
A very important advantage that the
Diesel engine possesses over other types
of power units is found in its higher
thermal efficiency. Steam turbines have
reached efficiencies as high as twenty-
eight per cent; gasoline engines vary
from twenty-two per cent to thirty per
cent. Diesel engines have been built
with thermal efficiencies as high as
thirty-six per cent. Furthermore, the
economy of the oil engine does not drop
off with a decrease in the power out-
put. In the gasoline engine the quantity
of the fuel and air mixture admitted to
the cylinder is decreased for part-load
operation, thus reducing the compres-
sion pressure and consequently the
efficiency. In the Diesel engine, only
the amount of the fuel admitted is de-
creased; the charge of air remains the
same, and the engine maintains a high
part load economy.
A great deal of the demand for sta-
tionary power may be attributed to the
growing tendency to use Diesel instal-
lations as auxiliary equipment to some
other type of power unit. Instances of
this are found in hydro-electric plants
and central power stations where Diesel
engines are used to supply stand-by
power or to handle peak loads. It has
been found to be cheaper to build dams
and generating stations large enough to
handle the maximum flow of the river
and to depend on Diesel power to sup-
ply the deficiency during the dry season
than to build plants just large enough
to handle the minimum water flow.
Steam power units used for this pur-
pose require constant attention from a
fire room force. Fires must be kept
banked, and considerable time is re-
quired to develop full power. On the
other hand, a Diesel plant has no op-
erating expense while idle, requires no
attention, consumes no fuel, and can
be started from a cold condition and
put on full load within five minutes.
Another application of Diesel power
is found in small power station units.
The efficiency of steam plants is less
for small sized units than for large
8
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


erate power in huge central stations
and transmit it over large areas. In
some isolated districts, however, the
losses in the transmission of power over
long distances are of such a magnitude
as to make it profitable to install a
local power station of small size and
eliminate these lines. Diesel power can
be used for this purpose because the
oil engine is just as economical in small
sizes as in large units.
Because of its remarkable reliability
and sustained economy for continuous
runs, the Diesel engine has found ap-
plications in such fields of severe service
as oil line pumping stations, ice plants,
cotton gins, flour mills, mines, and tex-
tile mills. The oil engine has the ad-
vantage over steam power in many
applications because of its compactness,
the economy realized in labor, the free-
dom from smoke, noise, and dirt, and
the low maintenance costs.
The fact that the Diesel engine is
well adapted to marine service is evi-
denced by the fact that there are far
more Diesel powered ships under con-
struction now than there are steamers.
In 1912 the first ocean-going motorship
was put into service; in 1930 Lloyd's
annual report stated that there were
sixty-four per cent more Diesel motored
ships under construction than there
were steamers. This advance seems all
the more remarkable in view of the
fact that it took eighty years from the
time the first successful steamer was
built to the time the tonnage of steam-
ers in use exceeded the tonnage of
sailing vessels. This rapid progress is
due to the smaller space required for
fuel and for the engine itself, the
smaller operating crew needed, the
higher part load economy, and the
quicker starting ability.
The application of Diesel power to
railroad transportation is a more recent
development. In 1925 the first Diesel-
electric locomotive was placed in serv-
ice. Since that time the Diesel engine
has found an increasing use in railroad
service. The oil-electric locomotives
have been found to be especially satis-
factory for switching and yard work
because of the high starting torque
that can be developed. Other advan-
tages of this form of motive power for
railroad use are the smaller train crews
needed, the elimination of coaling
plants and ash pits, reduction in the
number of water stations, freedom from
smoke, dirt, and noise, the ability to
develop full power at any speed, and
a fuel cost from one-third to one-sixth
that of a steam locomotive.
Probably more enthusiasm and ex-
citement preluded the advent of the
airplane Diesel than was accorded any
other use of this form of motive power.
The Packard Diesel aircraft engine,
which made its appearance in 1930, re-
ceived considerable attention and ex-
cited a great deal of speculation as to
the effect it would have on the future
of aviation. The principal reason the
Diesel engine is desirable for use in air-
craft is one of safety. The oil used as
fuel is non-inflammable unless it is per-
fectly atomized; this greatly reduces
the fire hazard which is a constant
menace in planes powered with gasoline
engines. Since there is no electrical ig-
nition the problem of interference with
the plane's radio communication is
eliminated. Because of the lower fuel
consumption in pounds per horsepower-
hour, the Diesel powered plane has a
greater cruising range than a plane
with a gasoline engine of the same
weight. Aircraft Diesels require no
warming up and can take off as soon
as the engine begins to turn over.
The application of Diesel power in
automotive uses is still more or less of
a question mark. In Europe the Diesel
engine has been adopted for use in
busses and trucks because of the high
differential between the price of gaso-
line and the price of fuel oil. In the
A smooth

United States this difference has not
been enough to provide much encour-
agement to the Dieselization of auto-
mobiles. The gasoline engine has proved
to be much more satisfactory for auto-
motive power, although the Diesel is
gaining favor in its use on tractors and
trucks. The Diesel engine cannot de-
velop the higher crankshaft speeds of
around 4,000 r.p.m. that are necessary
to obtain a rapid and smooth accelera-
tion and an even flow of power at all
speeds. Besides this, there are a num-
ber of other problems of design that
must be solved before the Diesel can
compete successfully with the gasoline
engine in the small sizes used for auto-
mobiles.
In large size applications, however,
the future of the Diesel seems to be
definitely assured. It is true that even-
tually taxes, higher costs of distribution,
and more processing will wipe out the
advantage of a low fuel cost. Contrary
to popular belief, the fuel injector sys-
tem of the Diesel engine presents as
many problems as does the carburetor
and ignition system of the gasoline
engine. It must also be remembered
that advances are constantly being
made in the development of other types
of power units just as they are in the
Diesel field. Despite all this it appears
that the Diesel engine will find a wider
and wider application in many fields.
Whether or not it will eventually dis-
place the steam turbine and the gaso-
line engine is too much a matter of
conjecture to risk any comment.

William Huiknell Stout
by
J. ANDERSON ASHBURN. '40E
WILLIAM Bushnell Stout, the son
of a Minnesota clergyman, is a
tall, impressive gentleman with a shock
of unruly, graying hair. Politically he
is conservative but far from reaction-
ary. He believes that more engineers
should take an active part in the ad-
ministration of government in an effort
to solve our economic problems.
In an unpretentious frame building
in Dearborn his engineering laborato-
ries are housed. It is here that he has
carried out his research in transporta-
tion which has literally caused th'j
world to make a beaten path to his
door.
Mr. Stout is firmly convinced that
research is the most important branch
of human endeavor. He says, "Despite
all the international unrest and talk of
war, the most important thing in the
world is research; for in the last analy-
sis all progress is technical progress,
and all technical progress is based on
research."
He feels that the world must even-

In ten minutes this small house becomes an easily handled trailer.
tually learn that it is futile merely to
"pass" laws. For a law passed is a law
unproven—those who have passed the
act must then fight to enforce it. True
progress must be based on natural laws;
laws which when once "discovered"
will work without human effort. It is
the role of research to discover such
laws.
Research has led to the introduction
of machinery into all forms of manu-
facturing. It is the machine that earn?,
and not the man. A man, for example,
cannot carry a load on his back and
earn a living. But give him a truck and
he can earn five dollars a day and there
will still be enough left over to pay the
interest on the invested capital. In the
large factories there is always an in-
vestment of several thousand dollars
worth of equipment for each man em-
ployed. It is on the basis of this invest-
ment that the factory worker makes a
living.
Mr. Stout is an energetic and active
worker. He will devote all his powers
to one subject, develop it to the point
of perfection, and then, dropping the
matter completely, pass on to some
other thing which he feels is in need of
improvement. He is utterly contemptu-
ous of those who hold the view that
America has reached the peak of in-
dustrial expansion; says that we have
only begun to skim the surface of prog-
ress, and looks for the next twenty
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


1929 look like a spent nickel.
Early in his career Mr. Stout became
interested in Aeronautical Engineering.
He developed the first internal strut
cantilever airplane in America, built
the first commercial monoplane, and
designed the first metal plane built in
this country. It was then that he de-
veloped his strong belief in functional
design. "The airplane," he says, "is of
necessity beautiful, because its design
is purely functional. It is today utterly
impossible to build an ugly airplane."
He feels that Aeronautical Engineering
is the firing line for all engineering and
has himself been largely instrumental
in its application to automobiles and
railroads.
Now he has turned his energies to
the housing problem; says there hasn't
been a basic change in housing since
the days of George Washington, and is
determined to do something about it.
Much of the expense involved in build-
ing a house is purely the result of tra-
dition. The house of the future, he
states, will be designed by the Engineer
and not by the Architect. It must be
relatively mobile, temporary, readily
replaceable, and must be low enough
in cost to bring home ownership within
reach of the mass of the people.
The new principles will be as revolu-
tionary to the housing industry as the

motor car was to the horse. Mr. Stout
intends to do away with the "ginger-
bread" and make everything functional.
In time such housing will become better
in equipment and functional value than
anything a millionaire can now hope to
own.
Mr. Stout believes that the develop-
ment of low cost housing will lead to
the formation of corporation towns.
Such towns will be built and operated
by large corporations for the use of
their employees.
If all this sounds like a fantastic
dream, you should visit the Stout
Laboratories where all this is rapidly
taking shape. In the yard behind the
main building there stands a small
house which because of its functional
planning is more roomy than the ordi-
nary kitchenette apartment. It is of the
panel type which can be transported on
a trailer from place to place and bolted
together by anyone with less than a
half day's work. It can be heated for
fifteen cents a day and can sell for only
$500. Inside the laboratories a larger
house is in the process of construction.
It will contain 3 rooms and lavatory
and, due to its functional design, will
be much roomier than this statement
would indicate.
There is also a mobile unit which
looks like an ordinary trailer in transit,
but which can be converted into a
small house in ten minutes. Already
this particular model has traveled
16,000 miles to the West Coast and
back twice and still looks as though it
had just been run off an assembly line.
All of which proves that William
Bushnell Stout is no idle dreamer but
a practical research engineer who has
the advantage of being unfettered by
any allegiance to tradition.
Thus the man who was a pioneer in
aviation, who started the first exclu-
sively passenger airline in the country,
and who developed the first completely
functional automobile, now is helping
to bring the advantages of functional
design to the housing industry.
Already he is far enough advanced
in his work that the layouts for an
advertising campaign are on the draft-
ing tables. Already he has solved many
a knotty problem. For instance what
is to be done for the young married
couple living in one of these small
homes when mother-in-law drops in.
"That's easy," says Mr. Stout, "they
have merely to call their dealer and
have a guest room sent out for the
week-end."

not yet had time to become perma-
nently established.
The first step in making use of the
data obtained was the determination
of the average starting and present
salary of each class. Figs. 1 and 2 show
the result graphically. The salary the
graduating engineer is able to command
is affected very much by the general
economic conditions; the graph of
starting salaries follows the general
economic trend very closely. Present
salaries are influenced more by the
number of years the graduate has
worked, but it apparently has been an
advantage to have been graduated in
a good year.
The fact that the younger men had
materially lower salaries than the older
graduates presented a problem when it
came to making further comparisons.

Fig. 5. Chart showing percentage of graduates of each department obtaining
employment in their own field.
It seemed hardly fair to compare a man
from the class of 1936 with one from
the class of 1926 on a straight salary
basis. To allow for this discrepancy, a
system of index numbers was devised.
We already had the average starting
and present salary for each class. We
then simply divided each individual's
salary, starting and present, by his
class' average and multiplied by 100.
The resulting figure or index number
expressed each man's salary as a per-
centage of his class' average income.
Alumni interested in checking their
own status with respect to their class-
mates may do so, then, merely by di-
viding their own salary by the average
of their class given in Figs. 1 and 2. In
all further tabulations these indices
were used as a measure of income.
Fig. 3 is a distribution chart showing
the relation of the various departments
of the Engineering College with respect
to starting salaries. Fig. 4 is a similar
comparison of present salaries. In addi-
tion to the average of each group, these
charts show the median, the total num-
ber of returns in each classification,
and the distribution of these returns.
In both cases the Chemicals and the
Naval Architects top the list while the
Electricals bring up the rear. The
spread is wider in the case of present
than starting incomes. The most strik-
ing change is the decline of the Civil
Engineers from a starting index of 104
to a present of 95. In conjunction with
these distribution charts it is interesting
to look at Fig. 5 which shows the pro-
portion of the graduates of the various
departments that have been able to ob-
tain employment in their own field.
Note that over 90% of the Chemicals
were originally employed in some form
of Chemical Engineering and that most
of them remain in this field. This is
probably due to the fact that the field
of chemistry is more specialized and
distinct than the other branches. The
Aero-Mechanicals come next but have
the advantage of having two fields
from which to choose. Only about half
the Civil Engineering graduates find
permanent employment in their field.
Most of these, it was found, are em-
ployed by some governmental agency.
The foregoing would indicate then
that the specialized fields of Chemistry
and Naval Architecture offer their
graduates the best chance of obtaining
permanent employment in their own
field with remuneration above the
average. Aeronautical, Civil, and Elec-
trical Engineering hold the lowest
three places both in salary and in the
number of graduates finding permanent
employment in their own field. How-
ever, the spread between the highest
and lowest department is not great, and
the distribution charts show that some

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


ing salaries in the higher brackets.
Michigan engineers hold many and
varied positions. We found, however,
that there are ten types of work in
which considerable numbers of gradu-
ates are employed. These are: Adminis-
tration, Patent Work, Sales, Operation,
Design, Research, Construction, Gov-
ernment Service, Routine Work, and
Education. Most of these classes are
self-explanatory, but one or two need
clarification. Under the heading Opera-
tion we included: plant supervision, in-
spection, purchasing, distribution, main-
tenance including the maintenance of
power lines for public utilities, efficiency,
and valuation. Routine Work includes
stress analysis, drafting, physical test-
ing, and laboratory work. Government
Service is made up largely of Civils em-
ployed by State and Federal bodies.
The work covered is largely that of
flood control and highway construction,
but sanitary and statistical work is also
included.
Fig. 6 shows the result of this tabu-
lation. The spread between top and bot-
tom groups is wider in this case than
in any other investigated. It is no sur-
prise to find the men engaged in Ad-
ministration holding the top position by
a wide margin.
Patent Work, a small group includ-
ing most of the graduates of the Engi-
neering-Law curriculum holds second
position. Included in this classification
are patent lawyers and patent clerks.
The former, in general, draw very high
salaries while the latter are well below
average.
The only other group to have an in-
dex above 100 is the Sales Engineers.
The rest of the classes, all of which
with the exception of Education pertain
to the actual production work in engi-
neering, have indices ranging from 98
to 79. Teachers have the lowest average
of all, obtaining incomes aggregating
only 78% of the average of the whole
group. Of actual production engineer-
ing, plant operation shows the greatest
monetary return. Design, Research, and
Construction fall off progressively, and
Routine Work rates about on a par
with teaching. In short, the men who
boss engineers or sell engineering prod-
ucts receive the highest incomes.
In other surveys of this type, there
has been found a tendency for students
who obtained high grade averages in

We did, however, find that the men
who took part in extra-curricular activ-
ities are enjoying a slight lead over the
rest of the graduates. The returns were
somewhat arbitrarily divided into five
groups: those who had no activity,
those who had none because of self-
support, and three levels of activity:
few, intermediate, and many. Few was
considered to mean one or more minor
activities which took little or no time;
the intermediate classification required
at least participation in one major ac-
tivity for a two year period; the high-
est rating was given to those men who
on campus rated "B.M.O.C." Fig. 8
shows that there is a progressive in-
crease in income from those without any
activity up through the "B.M.O.C."
The fact that the men who worked are
close to the bottom substantiates the
University's stand that it is better not
to work one's way through college if
other arrangements are possible.
Many of the men answering this sur-
vey added comments expressing their
ideas as to how the University might
improve the training given to its engi-
neers. The greatest number agreed that
there should be some form of vocational
guidance, and that there should be more
English and speech. Many of the grad-
uates felt that the curriculum should
be made more practical with less
emphasis on theory. Other suggestions
were that there should be more training
in business, economics, and politics;
that the University should establish a
system of cooperative education with
industry; that the course should be
made less specialized with the inclusion
of more cultural courses; and that
there should be some training in per-
sonality and the ability to sell yourself.
In addition there were numerous other
comments made by only a few men.
These ranged from the elimination of
paternalism to the extension of the
mentor system and the incorporation
of a course in marital training into the
curriculum.
Despite the depression which heid
the level of salaries down, most of the
men answering this survey were quite
satisfied with the engineering profession
and the training they received at Mich-
igan. A good many of them took the
trouble to say so.

Comment*
Editor's Note—This is the first of the new
series of commentaries by Professor A. D. Moore.
This is the third consecutive year that the
TECHNIC has been able to present these com-
mentaries to its readers.
WITH a portable machine in my
lap, I am writing this while sit-
ting on the rock face of an island in
Canada. Below me is the family cabin;
below that, the beach and lake. It has
been a fine summer here. Orientation
Period is still ten days and five hun-
dred miles away. I will soon be seeing
several hundred new engineering fresh-
men; and by the time this is read,
those freshmen will be in college and
hard at it.
The editors of the Technic have
been kind enough to ask me to continue
the Commentaries for a third year.
Frequently, during the past six weeks
up here, it has occurred to me to won-
der what to put into this first issue;
and every time the problem came to
mind, there also came to mind the sad-
dest, most hopeless of statements a
freshman ever made to me. So, let the
freshman furnish the theme.
After giving a talk last.year on effec-
tive study habits, I invited the fresh-
men to turn in some comments. This
particular freshman was honest enough
to write that he had derived no benefit;
for, he said, "My habits have already
been formed, and I see no prospect of
changing them." Obviously, the lecture
had done him no good. Fortunately, it
could have done him no harm. He'd be
impervious.
The ridiculous and pathetic thing
this young man was saying was, that
at the age of 18, he had already formed
the habits that not only were to carry
him through college, but through the
continued study and improvement he
would need to carry on through his ex-
pected 45 years of professional life.
Well, if so, let's hope the habits were
good habits. Let it be admitted at once
that a very few men do come into the
college with an adequate set of study
habits; but all the others need, in vary-
ing degree, to dismiss some bad prac-
tices, to strengthen some good ones,
and to adopt still others that lead to
personal effectiveness.
This fall, at least fifty of our engi-
neering freshmen will adopt approxi-
mately this pattern of college life: two
or three movies each week; a strong
interest in football, including personally
rooting for the team at all the home
games and religiously following the
sport in the papers; engaging in several
long "bull-sessions" every week, with
friends around the house who seem to
have plenty of time; and using what-
ever time and energy are left for
classes, and what is optimistically
called studying. Of the fifty, half will
not be here next year to see the games
and the movies; perhaps a quarter will
start scrambling to change their habits
and routines midway of the semester,
but will find it too late to save much
from the wreckage; and in the other
quarter there will be a dozen or so who
get adjusted early and favorably. These
last are those who discover that one of
the major reasons for coming to col-
lege is to change their habits.
Of great importance to the student
is that bundle of habits which, taken
together, we call reading. One cannot
get into college unless he can read. But
recent studies have conclusively shown
that a large proportion of college stu-
dents have reading habits that can be
materially improved; and that some
have a reading ability so poor that it
is difficult to see how they remain in
college. It is easily possible for one to
test his reading speed; and it is usually
possible for a poor reader to improve
his speed materially. However, as yet,
very few students have taken them-
selves in hand, to improve this group
of habits.
The fact is, of course, that the hu-
man being is a stubborn animal, who
doesn't like to change his habits. On
the whole, this is probably as much to
his advantage as otherwise. On the
other hand, man can change his habits
if he has a sufficient desire to do so.
And we might well define a college as
a collection of picked specimens who
are anxious to learn what good habits
are, in order to adopt them as rapidly
as possible.
Unlike the freshman whose habits
were already fixed, we should expect
to learn new habits at almost any time
of life, either for the purpose of keep-
ing on at making a living, or for mak-
ing life more worth living. For example,
last June, when I was just 23 years out
of college, I decided to try to learn to
juggle balls. I had always wanted to,
but had never tried it, and had no more
of the beginnings of the art than the
ability to toss up one ball and catch it
when it came down. After several hours
of strenuous work (the work comes in
picking up the balls) I caught on, and
could keep two balls busy; after a
couple of weeks, three balls consented
to take the air; and now, after almost
daily practice for three months, I can
handle four balls fairly well. Now, there
is nothing whatever remarkable about
this. Certainly, nine out of ten could
learn to do it, if they kept at it, learned
from their mistakes, and have plenty of
fun in the bargain.
As a college student (or graduate)
would you like to learn to juggle? Then
raid the five-and-ten for some rubber
balls, and start in; and don't get dis-
couraged by sore arms and strained
backs. Would you like to develop a
taste for fine literature? Then get hold
of some and begin reading it every day;
and don't get discouraged by some of
the strange words you will run into;
after awhile, they will become familiar,
and will be part of the fun when you
run into them again.
When this piece was started, the
September sun was warming up these
rocks and providing a pleasant spot for
a temporary office. It is now sunset; the
Canadian heavens are honoring Michi-
gan with a blue-and-gold display of sky
and clouds; and the wind is getting
sharp enough to make the cabin look
very inviting. The Commentaries stand
adjourned.

lice standing around.
This reminds us that crime does not
pay.
roommates
We don't like roommates.
They wear each other's clothes, they
run the radio at the wrong time, and
they get each other goons for blind
dates. Worst of all they read each
other's Technics.
We could sell twice as many Tech-
nics if it weren't for roommates.
We don't like fraternities either.
Sometimes one copy of the Technic is
enough for a whole house full of engi-
neers. We think it's horrible.
But we like our roommate. He's dif-
ferent—he gets his own Technic.
Besides, his shirts fit us.
sellout
We were awfully embarrassed last
year. We didn't print enough copies of
the October issue, and they sold out
the first day.
People accused us of all sorts of
things. We could stand most of them,
but then somebody accused us of pull-
ing the kind of publicity stunt the Gar-
goyle uses.
That cut us deeply.
This year we aren't taking any
chances of being slandered like that
again; we printed plenty. Step right
up, folks, only fifteen cents.
policy
This issue of the Technic marks the
beginning of the 57th year of publica-
tion. The Michigan Historical Society
informed us the other day that the
Technic is not only the oldest Engi-
neering College Magazine in the coun-
try, but that it is also the oldest publi-
cation on the Michigan campus. We
will have to admit, though, that by
making use of questionable Lit School
logic, the Ensian will probably contest
this point.
During the past few years the Tech-
nic has won a considerable amount of
national recognition. There has been
considerable comment around campus,
however, that we were more interested
in these awards than in reader interest.
That hurt.
The Technic is the Engineer's mag-
azine and it not just something put out
by a few students for their own pleas-
ure. At present close to fifty members
of the Engine School are actively en-
gaged in working on the Technic.
Contributions, comments, suggestions,
and ideas from the rest of the 1800
students are always more than welcome.
In order that the magazine might be
more readable, we are making a number
of experiments.
Give us hell if you don't like them.
Most of the changes are being made
in the departments. This pillar for in-
stance. We will confess that as yet we
are uncertain as to just what material
will be included each month. It is going
to be a consolidation of humor, (no
crax) editorial comment, and just
plain rambling. We're lazy. We are
sorta hoping that you will start con-
tributing items for this column so we
won't have to work.
The Professional Notes department is
getting a new suit of clothes. Pictures
to you. Spotlight is going to start
dragging our dear professors out for
critical examination. They're really not
bad guys when you get to know them.
Two series of articles are planned for
the year. The first will be devoted to
explaining in detail what the graduat-
ing engineer may expect to find when
he steps out into the various branches
of industry. No, fellows. This will NOT
become "What Industry Is Looking
For in the Young Engineer." Read Mr.
Kirkbride's article on Research (page
6) and you'll see what we mean. Other
functions to be discussed in future is-
sues are: Design, Sales, Construction,
and Administration.
The interview with Mr. Stout (page
10) is the initial venture for the second
series. A great many prominent men
who are too busy to write articles are
glad to submit to an interview. And
you know, it's funny, a lot of those
boys on top have some real good ideas.
Now we'll do a little confessing. All
this was a build-up. Or didn't you
know? Now you are all steamed up
about the Technic. So now you will
all go out and buy a subscription. We
hope so anyway. Because we gotta have
lots and lotsa subscriptions. Only one
dollar boys.

BETTER MATERIALS FOR HIGHER TEMPERATURES
New developments bring new problems. The design-
ing oi an improved direct-drive steam engine, for
oil-field service, necessitated the use of a material
that would withstand continuous subjection to high
steam temperature (550° to 600°F.).
The manufacturer adopted a Chrome-Nickel-Moly
(0.50—1.00% Mo) iron for vital engine parts. Due
to its Moly and Chromium contents, its high growth
resistance assures maintenance of the close toler-
ances necessary to efficient engine performance.
PRODUCERS OF FERRO-MOLYBDENUM, CALCI
This iron also has advantages from the standpoint
of production costs. The castings are free from defects.
They have fine grain in the heavy sections and satis-
factory machinability in the light sections.
On the foregoing points alone, Moly irons warrant
careful consideration. And there are many others,
likewise attested in practice. Our book, "Molyb-
denum in Cast Iron," will show the way to more
economical high-strength castings. It is free.

Opening guns in this year's series are
fired by Mr. C. G. Kirkbride who un-
folds to you all the ins and outs of Re-
search. We think you will find Mr.
Kirkbride an interesting as well as in-
formative author, and if you are think-
ing of entering this field here is your
chance to learn something about it.
Mr. Kirkbride graduated with his
M.S.E. in 1930. With the aid of a
Donovan scholarship he worked his
way completely through school and at
the same time made a B-A average. A
member of Alpha Chi Sigma fraternity,
he was elected to Tau Beta Pi and Phi
Lambda Upsilon. He was a member of
the Engineering Council and president
of the student chapter of A.I.Ch.E.
After graduation he went to work in
the laboratory of an Indiana oil com-
pany and has since become Assistant
Director of Research for the Pan Amer-
ican Refining Corporation in Texas.
Mr. Kirkbride, who thinks students
should take a course in how to get
along with people, writes us that his
present work "consists of process de-
sign calculations on cracking units,
polymerization units and pipe stills,
economic analyses and general work on
maintaining optimum operation of the
refinery."
We thought you might like to know.
old timer
Because the school seems to go for
that informal chatty style upon which
A. D. Moore has a monopoly, we are
pleased to announce that the Commen-
taries will be continued for a third
year. A. D. has some of that rare gift
possessed by the late Will Rogers: Giv-
ing advice and making you like it.
We see in his opening column—yep,
we read them too—that the Professor
has learned to juggle. We are herewith
putting in reservations for two ringside
seats to the Freshman assembly at
which he is requested to prove his
newly acquired skill.
pioneer
First in our series of interviews is
one with Mr. William B. Stout. As can
be seen from reading the interview
(page 10) Mr. Stout is a very remark-
able man.
The men we sent over to interview
him came back rather awed by the
whole affair. They've been telling their
experiences to the rest of the staff ever
since.
One of their stories concerns Ferdi-
nand, the bull. (If you don't know who
Ferdinand is you had better read up
on your modern nursery rhymes.) It
seems that Mr. Stout has a china model
of Ferdinand on a shelf in his new
accordion-like trailer.
When he was in Hollywood recently
he had Walt Disney in for lunch: Walt
saw the model of Ferdinand and made
inquiries which led to the unfolding of
the entire tale of this bull who didn't
want to fight. Result: Disney plans a
Silly Symphony on Ferdinand.
Science marches on!
aa water softening plant
After spending four years in Ann
Arbor, it has been said that a Michigan
student could drink water from any
part of the world with perfect equa-
nimity. We are sorry that the unsus-
pecting freshman cannot have that
sensation which we had when we took
our first mouthful of Ann Arbor water.
However, this summer Ann Arbor in-
stalled a water softening plant which
not only reduces the mineral hardness
of the water from 360 parts per million
to 100 parts per million, but also elimi-
nates the objectionable taste and odor
formerly connected so intimately with
the water.
The softening plant is located at the
outskirts of the West Side of town on
ground ISO feet above the main part
of town. Water is pumped from the
three wells in various parts of the town
through direct mains to the plant. The
plant consists of a three story brick
building, a number of concrete tanks
behind the building, and a storage
reservoir. Inside the building can be
found the control mechanism for the
whole plant, filtration tanks, a testing
laboratory, and a storage place for
chemicals. The concrete basins outdoors
are used for precipitating the undesir-
able calcium and magnesium com-
pounds from the water. The cold lime-
soda process is being used in this plant
for eliminating the hardness and the
plant is able to handle about 8,000,000
gallons of water per day. When the
plant is running at normal speed, which
is less than half of the top speed, it
uses about 5 tons of chemicals per day.
The part of the process that the
ordinary student appreciates the most
is the aeration of the water, for it is
here that the H..S gas and the iron and
manganese compounds are completely
eliminated. From the standpoint of the
Ann Arbor home owner and factory
owner the entire softening process is of
great importance. The reduced mainte-
nance costs of water softeners and
water heaters and the increased life of
all equipment handling water are only
a few of a number of benefits derived
from the intallation of the water soft-
ening equipment.
foundrymen
On September IS, 16, and 17, the
American Foundrymen's Association
held a regional technical conference at
the Michigan Union. The meeting,
which was planned by a committee con-
sisting of Professors Richard Schneide-
wind, W. P. Wood, and E. J. Ash, was
devoted purely to the metallurgical as-
pects of founding.
The meeting was attended by 165 of
the leading metallurgists from this dis-
trict. Forty-three of the men in attend-
ance were from outside the state.
The evening session on Thursday was
devoted to a discussion of football.
Coach Keen of the Michigan staff
showed motion pictures, and Mr. R. S.
MacPherran, '92E, the first metallurgi-
cal graduate of the University of Mich-
igan, related how in 1888 the Michigan
football team took a Saturday off and
taught Notre Dame how to play the
game.
Other speakers included Professor
W. P. Wood, R. H. McCarroll, E.
Touceda, and W. J. Cameron.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


as possible and profit by those errors
he does make. If he is right 75% of the
time he will be indeed a valuable man.
He should develop his judgment. Good
judgment may be acquired with experi-
ence but even experience will not de-
velop it unless an effort is made to
remember what experience teaches. Also
the research engineer should develop
his self-confidence. This is a primary
prerequisite of a leader. Certainly a re-
search engineer cannot expect others
to have enough confidence in him to
follow him if he has no confidence in
himself. Executive positions require
leaders.
The research engineer should become
as familiar as possible with all phases
of the business of his company. Most
important, he should have a good un-
derstanding of its economic structure.
This will enable him to observe for
himself problems which offer the great-
est profit. He should assume the re-
sponsibility of bringing to attention
those problems. He may be the only
one to observe them. Above all, he
should not take a "let someone else
worry" attitude. He should keep in
mind that it is his company and its
progress is his progress.
2. The less the amount of super-
vision he requires, the more valuable
he is. When the engineer enters re-
search he will in all probability begin
a test in which his superior will attempt
to determine his capacity for complet-
ing assignments. Each successive as-
signment will be more difficult and of
greater importance than the last one.
His superior will watch carefully the
caliber of his work and no doubt com-
ment freely on it. Also his superior will
give just as much attention to the
amount of supervision required by the
young engineer although he may not
comment on it. Consequently the re-
search engineer should ask no more
questions than necessary to properly
define his assignment. It might be ad-
visable for him to outline his attack on
the problem and if he is doubtful of
certain points, ask for comments. He
should profit by these comments and
then go about his work always keeping
thoroughly in mind his objective but
carefully observing any unusual phe-
nomena. Frequently information ob-
tained as incidental in the solution of
a problem is of far greater economic
importance than attaining the original
objective. When he has completed the
problem he should get it well in mind
and then present his solution and con-
clusions, calling attention to anything
of an unusual nature.
3. Original thought is very essential
in research because the research engi-
neer will be working much of the time
on unknowns which have never been
investigated and defined in terms of
well established scientific knowledge.
The tools used in investigations are
fundamental technical principles and
of course the engineer must be able to
apply them rapidly and accurately. The
research engineer may be able to apply
these fundamental principles in new
and novel ways to improve profits for
his company. New products, processes
and designs may be developed which
are patentable. Frequently such patents

are very valuable to his company and
if so he will be rewarded in due time
for his original thought. In this connec-
tion a slight knowledge of patent law
is advantageous to the research engi-
neer.
4. Research pays dividends only
when results are obtained. Thus it is
essential that problems undertaken
must be solved rapidly and in a satis-
factory manner. The research engineer
is not advanced because he is a hard
worker. It is because he gets results.
True he probably also is a hard worker
but that is only incidental as far as the
board of directors is concerned. He
must avoid being lost in a fog. It
might be well to outline his work into
a well-planned program and work in
that direction. He should make every
effort count. After each day he should
take inventory to see just how much
of his program he has completed. He
should be critical with himself and de-
termine where he lost time so he will
not make the same errors again. He
should not forget that his advancement
will be determined to a large measure
by the results he obtains. A problem is
not completed when he has solved it.
The solution must be reported in a
clear and concise form. Furthermore he
may be surprised that the board of di-
rectors is not particularly excited about
it. He knows more about the problem
than anyone else so it is up to him to
sell them his ideas if they offer large
potential profits. Frequently more than
half of the problem is selling the solu-
tion. Sometimes he may have to fight
to put his ideas into practice. He must
understand that he is entering into a
business world where the human ele-
ment is indeed prominent. He will meet
with individuals who will try to block,
the acceptance of profitable ideas be-
cause of purely personal reasons, prob-
ably the most common of which is
jealousy. He should not be discouraged,
however. If he is right he will even-
tually win. He should present the facts
clearly, supported if possible by eco-
nomic calculations, and know the limi-
tations. He should be tactful in his
arguments and give careful considera-
tion to all objections which are raised.
However, he should make no unneces-
sary concessions. He must have pa-
tience because eventually someone in
an authoritative position will under-
stand his ideas and see the economic
advantages. This will improve his pres-
tige and represent a step in the direc-
tion of advancement because he will
have shown the qualities of leadership
as well as improved the profits of his
company. He must realize that if the
results of his research are not put into
practice, the work might better have
not been done as far as his company
is concerned.
5. Energy and enthusiasm are also
qualities of leadership. It is difficult to
picture a leader who spends a large
per cent of his time chatting about this
and that which has no connection with
his work. A real leader does not do this.
A real leader will radiate energy. No
doubt he will relax occasionally and
indulge in light conversation during
working hours but it will be appreciated
that research entails rather deep and
concentrated thought and it is stimu-
lating to the mind to relax occasionally
during such work. It is advisable to be
a steady worker. This is an indication
of maturity. Playing pranks and jokes
should be avoided. This might stamp
the research engineer as a good fellow
among his fellow workers but also it
stamps him as not having reached a
state of maturity. Industry is reluctant
to place responsibility on an individual
of this type. He can stamp himself as
a good fellow simultaneously with giv-
ing evidence of maturity.
6. Another quality of leadership
which is in the direction of advance-
ment is the ability to inspire others.
This should be developed with experi-
ence. It is a very desirable qualification
for those directing research and in ex-
ecutive positions. A broad technical
knowledge is helpful but of far greater
importance is a keen understanding of
human nature. Also ability to organize
is important. If the engineer is not
gifted in this respect such abilities may
be developed if given attention.
All advancement of civilization is a
result of research. Early developments
were of a crude and primitive nature,
but were nevertheless a form of re-
search. Civilization progresses only to
the extent that research methods are
applied. Thus research is of vital im-
portance to society. Without it society
would not have the railroads, steam-
ships, automobiles, telephone system,
radio, electric light, or any other of the
modern conveniences which are now
regarded as a necessity.
In regard to the importance to so-
ciety of the work the individual engi-
neer will do, that will depend largely
on himself. Also the position he holds
in the community will depend on him.
If the average research engineer will
devote as much attention to his com-
munity as the average physician or
lawyer, he will in all probability be just
as prominent in the affairs of the com-
munity.
In conclusion industrial research
should be very fascinating to those in-
terested in work of a decidedly varied
nature which entails rather free use of
technical theory. The work changes
rapidly due to new developments as a
result of research itself. This necessi-
tates very close contact with technical
and scientific literature, and the re-
search engineer will have to devote
considerable of his leisure time to de-
veloping himself along the line of the
more recent results of other research
organizations.
The position of the research engineer
in his community will depend upon his
interest in his community. On the av-
erage this position probably is similar
to that of any other professional man
devoting an equal amount of interest
to his community. Certainly the work
of the research engineer is of great im-
portance to society because progress is
made only to the extent that research
methods are applied.

fred luebke
HERE'S a gent you all should know.
He'll be figuring rather promi-
nently in campus affairs this year. Fred
Luebke (pronounced Lipke) is his
name. More than likely you've heard
of him already.
Fred is quite completely a product
of Ann Arbor, having been born here,
and having lived here most of his life.
He went to Ann Arbor High School,
where he participated in football and
baseball. Then he came straight to the
University of Michigan and enrolled in
a five year engineering-business ad-
ministration course. As a result of time
processes, we find him a senior this
year in the engineering school, but
with another year to go after this June.
But Fred has covered some ground in
his past three years and it might be in-
teresting to have a glance at it. In his
freshman year he went out for the
Union and football managership, was
the Financial Chairman of his class,
and a member of the Military Ball
Committee. He also became a member
of Acacia Fraternity. The sophomore
year saw Fred concentrating more on
the Union, but still on the Military
Ball Committee. Then, in his junior
year, just past, he was a member of the
Union Executive Council, in charge of
Publicity and Advertising, on the Pro-
gram Committee of the Michigras, and
treasurer of his class. Now, in his
technically senior year, he starts off
well with the Presidency of the Men's
Council and Vice-Presidency of the
Union.
Fred has worked for Ford off and on
for several years, having put in two
summers and three winters at Green-
field Village acting as a guide. He can
tell you nearly anything you'd like to
know about it in general and about the
Edison exhibits in particular. Then for
the last two summers he has been
working with International Research
Corporation here in Ann Arbor.
For recreation Fred likes golf, swim-
ming, hockey, and metal working, but
goes in extra heavy for boating. Until
recently he has been concerned mainly
with sailboats and has become some-
thing of an expert along that line. At
present he is spending quite a bit of
time with outboard motorboats on
Whitmore Lake. We spent a very en-
joyable time out there while getting
this information. Fred is a good host
and is socially quite at ease. He has
ambitions concerning an uplift in
Michigan spirit, the effects of which are
probably well underway as you peruse
this page.
When he does graduate, a year from
this June, Fred would like to get into
the Personnel and Factory Manage-
ment field. If, as the old saying goes,
future events cast their shadows before
them, we'd say, judging from past
shadows, that Fred will get along in his
chosen field, to put it mildly.
professor menefee
Editor's Note—In order to help create a bet-
ter understanding between students and faculty,
the TECHNIC has decided to devote a part of
its personalities column each month to one of
the members of the faculty, to try to reveal him
more as a person and less as an animated teftt-
book.
WHEN we first started to pene-
trate the formidable wall of seri-
ous texts and awesome titles, we found
ourselves engaged with a solid, bushy-
eyebrowed gentleman called Professor
Menefee. We had always nourished a
suspicion that there was more to this
E.M. prof than greets the eye, but even
we were surprised when we began to
dig around a bit. To tell the truth, if
we were to attempt to do full justice
to the man we'd have to put out a
Menefee edition, so let's just hit the
high spots, and if you are inquisitive
by nature, there's always the Who's
Who, and we'll keep a list on file in
our office.
To start at the beginning, Ferdinand
Northrup Menefee was born in Colum-
bus, Kansas, on January 7, 1886. His
father was a merchant, and he himself
is one of a long line of Scotch Menefees
who first settled in Jamestown, Virginia,
in 1623-1640. In 1908 he graduated
from the University of Nebraska and
in 1910 from Cornell. At the former he
was a member of the Kappa Sigma
Fraternity, senior class president, and
at the latter an instructor in Civil En-

gineering. He is a member of Sigma Xi
and an honorary member of Sigma Tau,
Nebraska's equivalent of Tau Beta Pi.
He has been an axman, blacksmith's
helper, bank messenger, clerk, bridge
inspector, surveyman, and whatnot, be-
fore he settled down temporarily to an
instructorship in Descriptive Geometry
and Drawing at the University of
Michigan. During the War he was a
Major in the Ordnance Department of
the Army and is now commanding offi-
cer of a reserve engineer battalion.
Since the war he has held a professor-
ship in the Engineering Mechanics De-
partment.
However he seems to have found
time to do a number of other things
while pounding stresses and strains into
you and me. He has been interested in
Y.M.C.A. work, and has been the Asso-
ciation's president. For the last fifteen
years or so he has been Chairman of
the Executive Committee of the Mich-
igan Fresh Air Camp, of which we
have all heard so much, and know so
little. He is also a faculty adviser for a
fraternity on campus and is a firm be-
liever in the benefits of fraternity life
He was, for several years, the editor of
the Michigan Engineer, and has written
a great number of articles for it. He was
the founder of the engineer's speech
club which became Sigma Rho Tau, of
which he has been national president.
He is chairman of a committee in the
American Concrete Institute which is
investigating the whys and wherefores
of concrete floors and beams. Then too,
he is an authority on the St. Lawrence
Waterway. To come a little closer to
home, we find Professor Menefee hold-
ing down the Presidency of the Ann
Arbor Board of Public Works, and he
proudly points to its clean slate and
devoidness of corruption.
Personally. Professor Menefee is mar-
ried and has two children, one, Charles,
who has graduated from Michigan, and
the other, Ruth, now a senior. He is of
a serious turn of mind, and professes a
need to have light-hearted folks around
him. He has traveled widely during
what time we just can't see, and is a
gardener of a sort. He putter-practices
his gardening at his picturesque home
on Geddes Heights. The gray haired
professor's personal office is jammed
full of books, and the walls are covered
with diplomas, snapshots, mementos,
and home truths. One of Professor
Menefee's strongest beliefs is that the
engineer should play his part in social
work and participate actively in the
advancement of society.
He doesn't object to a joke in class,
even when it turns on him, for he tells
us that last spring a minicamera devo-
tee spent most of a class hour snapping
the professor as he labored to drive
home a point in mechanics. Just to
mildly inform the student that he knew
what was going on he said, "Are you
going to put those pictures in the
Daily?" The answer was quite distinct
and prompt, "No—the Gargoyle."
To say that we think Professor Mene-
fee is an excellent example of what we'd
like to see more of at Michigan would
be trite and obvious. Nevertheless, we
do think a lot of him as a man, and as
a professor, and we hope that we have
given you an inkling of why we do.
don siegel
DON SIEGEL probably needs little
or no introduction to most of us
here at Michigan. However, it is pos-
sible that there are a few things we can
point out about him that you haven't
heard of already.
This likeable blond giant was born in
Detroit during the early teens of the
century. He and his family moved to
Royal Oak, Michigan, while Don was
still at a comparatively tender age. He
went to Royal Oak High School and
it was here that he began to make a
mark with that athletic prowess that
has put him up in headlines here.
While in high school he got his letters
in swimming, track, and football. He
seemed to do all right in the water, for
he splashed himself into the state
championship position in the fifty and
hundred yard free-style. Outside the
athletic line, he was also his class
treasurer. He worked while in school,
too; during summers was a life guard
and drove a truck.
He graduated from high school in
thirty-three and dropped out of school
for two years. During this time he
piled up a couple of hundred hours
flying time in inactive duty at Grosse
He. During this time he also managed
to gain fifteen hours credit at Wayne
University Night School.
Then, in thirty-five, Don entered the
University of Michigan to take up
Transportation Engineering. He's done
pretty well here too. So far he has
been President of the Newman Club
and Chairman of their Spring Formal,
a member of Sigma Chi fraternity, and
of Triangles, junior engineering
honorary, plus being a proctor at the
Allen-Rumsey Dorm. He got his fresh-
man numerals in track and football.
Then he went on to become a two
letter man in varsity football and is
out again this fall. Don does a bit of
boxing, too. He was Frosh Campus
Champion. In '37 he was State Novice
Champion, and in '38 defeated the
national champion, one up and one
down, in the Detroit Youth Organiza-
tion championship. Out of ten fights,
Don has earned eight knockouts and
two decisions.
In his hobbies, Don has covered
quite a diversified field. As a matter of
fact, his specific hobby is learning to
do new things. He likes archery, plays
the saxophone and cornet, in fact, had
a band of his own just out of high
school. He likes to dance, and has even
won a dance contest, though that is
just between you and me.
This prodigal son of the Siegels is
frank and doesn't beat around the
bush. It is an inborn trait, witness an
incident from the days before Don
could brag about having passed his
sixth birthday. He was attending
church with his grandmother when,
during a momentary blanket of silence,
our hero hied himself to his feet, and
said, "Let's go home Grandma, I don't
like this show!" Practical Mrs. Siegel
won first prize by sending the faux pas
into a contest for bright sayings by the
little ones.
Don spent this summer attending
summer school and working for Build-
ings and Grounds. He expects to grad-
uate this coming June and intends to
go into the Naval Flying Service. He's
going strong now, and we don't quite
see anything to stop him. So hats off
to the Navy, Don.

Precision Design.
clipper shops
The Wright Brothers built their first
airplane in a bicycle shop. For 20 years
after that time an airplane plant was
just a shop without any special func-
tional characteristics. But with the ad-
vent of the giant clippers and their
special requirements of overhead clear-
ance, and huge dimensions, architects
have developed a new type of aviation
factory. The structure shown in the
accompanying cut was designed by
Albert Kahn and, in spite of a width
of three hundred feet and a length of
four hundred and fifty feet, has not a
single interior column. The height from
the floor to the underside of the roof
trusses is 43 feet. The entrance at one
end of the building consists of a door
having a clear opening of 300 feet in
width and 40 feet in height. To elimi-
nate any obstructions in the interior of
the building, the heating and ventilat-
ing system is installed underground.
All electrical and mechanical conduits
are also placed underground. We do
not believe that any other American
industry calls for such special charac-
teristics in its factories.
tallest lock gates
The lower pair of lock gates that will
close against the waters of the Colum-
bia, when a ship wants to pass Bonne-
ville Dam, tower up like diminutive
Flat Iron Buildings. Made of riveted
plates supported by a steel framework,
each leaf or gate represents 600 tons
of fabricated steel work and stands 100
feet high. Yet they are fabricated and
hung so accurately that, when closed,
they form a metal to metal union that
is perfectly watertight.

The Birthplace of Clippers
Cuts Courtesy Scientific American
They are the tallest lock gates ever
constructed, surpassing by 18 feet the 82
foot gates that served the Miraflores
locks of the Panama Canal. Gates of
the same design, 46 feet high, are em-
ployed at the upper end of the lock.
The lock is 76 feet wide and each leuf
of both the upper and lower gates i:s
about 44 feet wide.
The gates were fabricated in sections.
After each section was planned to pre-
cision measurements, the gates were
given a trial assembly as a check for
accuracy, then separated again into
sections for shipment to the dam site.
Silicon steel was employed for the main
sections in both upper and lower gates,
and carbon steel was employed in the
remainder of the construction.
number please
For years now it has been possible
to plug in a phone in your stateroom
aboard a liner in the middle of the
Indian Ocean and chat intimately with
your family in Kalamazoo, Michigan.
But now another branch has been
added to the growing plant of the tele-
phone service. A plane-to-shore tele-
phone, believed to be the first of its
kind, is being installed on the Boeing
Clipper, ready for final tests. One line
of the intra-plane system is being set
aside to make it possible for anyone
aboard ship to give a desired number to
one of the stewards, who will connect
the phone with the line at the dock,
where local or long distance calls can
be put through.

"SPEED DEMON"
HAIL the new speed champion — a champion who
has never seen a speedway or flown an airplane.
The Olympics mean nothing to him.
"He" is a tiny quartz crystal that has set a new record
by vibrating at a pace that puts the hard-working
human heart to shame — 20,000,000 vibrations a second,
or 16,666,666 times taster than the normal human
heartbeat.
This speed demon is used in a new oscillator developed
by General Electric engineers for maintaining constant
frequencies in radio transmitting. Careful mechanical
grinding and painstaking polishing by hand reduce
the rough crystals to the size required tor the particular
broadcasting frequency used. Then the simple instrument
is installed in the transmitter circuit and goes to work
making the station stay on its assigned wave length.

THE BABY GROWS UP
SIXTEEN years ago G-E radio engineers crossed their
fingers and snapped a switch in one of the labora-
tories at Schenectady — and a split second later heard
through clumsy earphones, "This is YVGY, radio broad-
casting station of the General Electric Company,
Schenectady, New York."
That was the "birth announcement" for this G-E station,
whose rise from swaddling clothes to the lusty strength
ot sixteen years has paralleled the rise of radio broad-
casting trom experiment to smooth efficiency.
From the start, WGY was an unusual child. When only
three days old, it starred pioneering by presenting the

first remote-control broadcast. And the pioneering is still
going strong. As the station grew, it provided the ground-
work tor network broadcasting, mobile transmission,
coast-to-coast television broadcasts.
This year, WGY celebrates its sixteenth birthday with a
new 625-foot nondirectional antenna (70 feet higher than
Washington Monument) and a modernistic new studio
building with everything trom a model kitchen to a large
audience studio.
Engineers conduct tests on the young giant day and
night. Some are the veterans who started years ago —
others are recent graduates ot engineering schools as-
signed to the control rooms and transmitters upon
completion ot their G-E training courses. Results of the
tests these two groups conduct today will appear as
refinements in the broadcasting ot tomorrow.
ELECTRICAL TROUBLE SHOOTER
TWO men are carefully examining a large x-ray
photograph in a darkened room. One of them points
to some dark spots, some wavy lines. . . . "There's the
trouble."
This might well be taking place in a large medical labora-
tory. Instead, factory production lines and machinery are
only a few teet away —it is a testing room in which x-ray
photographs ot steel castings are examined. In many
such rooms, in all parts of the country, other engineers
are making like tests — tests that ferret out defects in
tastings before they can cause trouble.
Knowing in detail the symptoms ot every defect, these
engineers, guided by the x-ray, detect gas pockets, shrink-
age areas, and internal cracks. They eliminate all but
"smooth" castings.
Such applications, ot which many persons are not aware,
are typical results of the constant search by G-E engi-
neers for new uses of the x-ray. And not all of these
engineers are veterans — some only a few years ago com-
pleted their studies in engineering schools and came on
Test with General Electric.

THROUGHOUT
AMERICA many
technicians in un-
related industries
are busily engaged
in independent
research to deter-
mine the various
applications of Dow Ethyl Cellulose to
their own products.
Ethocel, to use its more familiar trade
name, is a Dow development revealing
such versatility that its ultimate possi-
bilities beggar the imagination. There
seems to be no end to the useful applica-
tions of this colorless, odorless, taste-
less, non-toxic member of the cellulose
family.
Already Ethocel is available in con-
venient granular form for producing a
great variety of plastic products. Its
dimensional stability, resistance to dilute
acids and alkalies, to sunlight and to
variations in humidity vastly increase its
utility in this field.
From work now in progress it is evi-
dent that Ethocel will soon be giving
new qualities to varnishes, lacquers and
fast-dryers. It will shortly add lustre
and finish to paper stocks, increase the
flexibility and dielectric properties of
wire insulation, provide desirable pro-
tective finish to textiles. There is
scarcely an industry that will not find it
offers advantages hitherto unobtainable.
And so the world seems destined soon
to be all wrapped up in Ethocel —
figuratively and almost literally, too. For,
one of its most important developments
is Ethocel film and Ethocel foil — mate-
rials for packaging and other purposes.
Transparent, flexible, non-brittle, and
available in various color tints, they offer
exceptional strength. For example,
Ethocel foil 0.001 inches in thickness
tests 10,000 pounds per square inch.
When you find that Ethocel is soluble
in a far wider range of solvents than is
common with cellulose derivatives, is
stable to heat, light and aging, imparts
toughness and flexibility to surface coat-
ings, possesses good electrical insulation
properties and has low flammability —
when these advantages and many others
are known, you realize that Ethocel is
perhaps the most promising and romantic
product Dow has yet contributed to
American industry.

MINIMIZING MASS EFFECT
Many manufacturers in different lines are profiting
from the versatility of Moly steels. In one instance
a single cast steel (Chrome-Manganese-Moly) is
used for a variety of applications — to the benefit of
both manufacturer and users.
Not only do the sizes vary, but the sections and
shapes as well. The Moly steel has simplified both
foundry production and heat treating problems. It
also makes it easier to produce consistent results
when simultaneously heat treating a miscellaneous
group of castings.

"One steel —many parts" is available. And our
book, "Molybdenum in Steel," is literally based on
experience, not just theory. Climax Molybdenum

Analysis
Photo-Elastic Laboratory in which polarized light is used
in determining concentration of stresses.
In research design work, the Photo-Elastic laboratory, housed in the Department
of Engineering Mechanics of the College of Engineering, offers a means of checking
stresses in many structural parts.
A model of the part to be examined is made in celluloid or other material whose
transmission of polarized light is affected by the amount of strain on the material
and then, by means of the equipment shown, an analysis can be made of the stress
concentration in the model which will give an accurate picture of the stress
concentration of the actual part.

LESLIE D. GODDARD. 'HE
Consulting Civil Engineer
CONSULTING Engineering is the
business of furnishing specialized
engineering service to clients having
only occasional need for it. The con-
sultant has an office with sufficient busi-
ness and technical equipment and per-
sonnel to perform such work as he gets,
receives about the same remuneration,
and occupies the same position in the
community as other professional men.
He has fewer clients than either the
attorney or the doctor, and the recur-
rence of need for his service is less fre-
quent, being regulated by the life of the
structures he erects, although obsoles-
cence due to scientific progress fre-
quently shortens such life below the
duration of physical fitness. He is free
from direction and control, can order
his life more or less to his own liking,
and gets credit for the results he ob-
tains.
Service to a number of clients brings
a wide variety of problems to him.
Since his service costs money, he is not
called in until the client has exhausted
his usual resources, so the problems are
difficult enough to challenge his inge-
nuity and hold his interest. Being a spe-
cialist does not mean that he knows the
right answer on the spur of the moment.
It means that he has encountered simi-
lar problems and is familiar enough
with their elements to arrive at a solu-
tion without too much delay and ex-
pensive experimentation. Clients will
retain a consultant only when they be-
lieve his results will be cheaper and
more satisfactory than doing the re-
search and experimentation themselves.
Entrance to the consulting field may
be gained either as an employee of an
already established firm, or through set-
ting up in the business for one's self.
Since being a consulting engineer re-
quires qualification as a specialist, the
recent graduate would be interested
mainly in the first, but this discussion
will include both, since recent graduates
may, later on, find the field attractive.
Employment by an established firm
has many advantages over other engi-
neering jobs, but offers are usually re-
stricted to students who have shown
adaptability to specialization. The rate
of pay is usually a little higher than
other engineering jobs, and there is the
additional advantage of association with
and direction by leaders of the engineer-
ing profession. Only successful consult-
ants can hire subordinates, so the young
engineer learns the successful way of
doing things. If the employment is of
long duration, he may become a mem-
ber of the firm and thus a consultant
himself. If he loses his job through lack
of work, he is no worse off than others
in different lines of engineering, and he
can always get some other job.
Entrance to the consulting field by
setting up in business for himself comes
after years of engineering practice,
when, through no fault of his own, his
source of employment fails, as, for ex-
ample, after a political upheaval or fol-
lowing the failure of his previous em-
ployers. By this time he has held
positions of responsibility and acquired
a living standard above that of the en-
gineering beginner. Vacancies in full-
time jobs for such a man are rare. So
he capitalizes his training and expe-
rience and sets up in business for him-
self. He already has many of the requi-
sites: technical training, experience,
friends, professional acquaintances, and
a knowledge of business. He is in a
position to be of value to clients who
have not enough work to keep him in
full-time employment. He has a family,
and children just at the expensive high
school or college age, and not much
capital to put into a business.
The capital required to start consult-
ing is surprisingly small. It is possible
to rent desk space in a room with ac-
countants or insurance men, where tele-
phone and stenographic service can be
had. Personal drafting equipment, his
technical library and a car are neces-
sary. Surveying and other special instru-
ments can be rented as needed until
purchase is possible. There must be
enough money to pay family living ex-
penses and promotional travel cost for
a few months.
JANUARY, 1939


Since his
service
costs money,
he is called
in as a
last resort,
so the problems
are difficult
enough to
hold his
interest.
There will be lapses in employment.
These are not confined to the period of
getting started. There have been in-
stances where established engineering
firms have had to let some of the firm
members get almost any kind of a job
for a while to tide over "no job" condi-
tions. There will be times when the
consultant has to put his personal earn-
ings into the business to hold his organi-
zation together until new work shows
up.
As in any business, the future possi-
bilities are limited only by the ability,
industry, and efficiency of the consult-
ant, depending, of course, on the gen-
eral prosperity of the community he
serves.
In securing work, the consulting en-
gineer is subject to the same restrictions
in regard to advertising as other pro-
fessional men. A business card, giving
name, address, and general line of prac-
tice, is permissable in publications likely
to meet the eyes of clients. Informational
pamphlets or reprints of technical ar-
ticles describing work done by the en-
gineer, and bearing only his business
card inconspicuously placed at the head-
ing or end of the article, are not taboo.
Free engineering service to the commu-
nity is not good advertising. People
wonder why the service, being profes-
sional, is free, unless it is very definitely
of a charitable nature.
By far the greatest single factor in
securing work is the good word of
brother engineers employed in the vicin-
ity. Recognition of a consultant as a
Architectural Forum
specialist by these stamps him unques-
tionably in the minds of prospective
clients as a good man. The client him-
self may not know much about engi-
neering, but endorsement by one who
does know it is an invaluable aid. To
this end, the consulting engineer should
cultivate a wide and cordial acquaint-
ance with other engineers in his terri-
tory.
Next to the friendship of engineers
in importance is a personal acquaintance
with the clients themselves, or their
officers or agents. To cultivate this, the
consultant should make regular trips
through his territory, contacting them,
attending their conventions, entertain-
ing them within reason, and learning all
about them; what their likes and dis-
likes are, what they have done, what
positions they hold in their communi-
ties, who their friends are, who their
relatives are. He must become familiar
with local conditions and needs, antici-
pate possible future work and drop sug-
gestions where they may do some good.
A simple suggestion that a mosquito-
infested swamp might be developed into
an attractive aquatic park resulted a
few years later in the setting up of such
a project. The secretary of the chamber
of commerce got the credit for the idea,
and the engineer got the fee. Both
were satisfied.
Information acquired in such trips
becomes surprisingly voluminous. It is
advisable to make a record for a follow-
up purpose and to keep a record of peo-
ple contacted and the data gathered
about them. The cost of such promo-
tional work, which is often quite large,
should be carried as part of the over-
head expense. The engineer starting a
practice is sometimes tempted to defray
part of the cost by carrying a side line
of sales. This should be avoided if his
professional standing is to be kept free
from embarrassment. Sooner or later
he is liable to find suspicion of bias on
his part if he passes judgment on some
article which he has previously sold. It
is better to stick to selling personal
service, and leave sales to Sales Engi-
neers.
As practice develops, promotional
work may be done on trips incidental to
work and the overhead cost reduced.
Continual contact is necessary until the
volume and quality of consulting work
is large enough to advertise itself. Suc-
cess is the best advertisement.
Relations with the client is too large
a subject for this paper. It is covered
in lectures during the senior year in
college and forms a large part of the
discussion at engineering conventions.
In general, it is the usual relationship of
employee to employer. Complete loy-
alty to the client's interests, sympathy
with his difficulties, and honesty are
axiomatic. There is seldom a formal
contract of employment, but there
should be at least a letter summarizing
the terms of employment.
Particular attention should be given
by the consulting engineer to his rela-
tionship with his client's regular engi-
neering staff, if there be one. It is natural
for the regular engineer to feel that the
retaining of a consulting engineer is a
reflection on his ability and to fear that
it may result in his losing his job. In
this situation, the consultant should at
all times treat the regular engineer as a
brother in the profession, take him into
his confidence, consult with him about
the problem at hand, and give him
enough advance information so he is
always a couple of jumps ahead of his
employers in knowledge of the problem.
His cooperation is essential to the suc-
cess of the consultant in accomplishing
the results desired. Courtesy and tact
will usually get this result. It is to the
mutual interest of the regular engineer
and the consultant to recognize the con-
sultant's services as expert; it removes
the onus of inability from the regular
engineer and justifies the size of the
consultant's bill.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the technical problems presented is
much the same as that employed on
engineering problems in industry. The
consultant, being a specialist, must
carry on research and keep in touch
with advances in science. The only
difference is that the consultant works
for many clients, the industrial engi-
neer, for one. There must always be a
study of local conditions, an estimate
of the situation, possible solutions, and
the selection of the one best suited to
conditions, writing of the technical spe-
cifications, and supervision of construc-
tion or operation. The consultant must
talk a language his clients can under-
stand.
The engineering solutions must be
such that operation of facilities once
constructed can be properly carried out
with available personnel. And if the
available personnel can be trained, there
is always the possibility that adminis-
trative changes may bring in other, less
competent operators with resultant fail-
ure of the facility and discredit to the
consultant. An outstanding example of
this is the failure in operation of many
municipal electric utilities in the past
fifty years.
The consulting engineer has also non-
technical functions in connection with
work for his clients. Familiarity with
banking, finance, and securities makes
it possible for him to translate his en-
gineering knowledge of the problem not
only into language understandable to
the layman, but also into the language
of the dollar, which is itself as technical
as engineering, and as little likely to be
understood by his client. For this rea-
son, the engineer frequently can be of
service in conducting arrangements for
financing the project his client is under-
taking.
Another non-technical activity lies in
connection with the legal work neces-
sary in every undertaking of magnitude.
While his client's attorney is charged
with the responsibility of watching legal
angles, the engineer, through his expe-
rience in actual work, is able to antici-
pate some situations that may arise that
would not occur to the attorney. Torts,
contracts, and rules of evidence are sub-
jects he should know something about
—the more, the better.
In seeking employment, the consult-
ing engineer differs from other engineers
in that he gives considerable considera-
tion to his client's ability to pay. In
ordinary employment, the employee as-
sumes that the employer has this abil-
ity, and payments are arranged to be
frequent and regular. If this arrange-
ment does not materialize, employment
is terminated within a short period and
before the work is completed. The loss
to the employee is nominal, but the con-
sultant has to expect to give long term
credits, to get his pay late in the project
or at its end, and to protect himself as
he may; some bad accounts are inevi-
table.
To cover costs incidental to maintain-
ing consulting service through periods
of unemployment and carry on promo-
tional work, it is necessary to charge
about twice as much per unit of tech-
nical work performed, as would be paid
if the engineer were a regular, full-time
employee, with equipment and supplies
furnished by the employer. The profits
fluctuate considerably, being high in
busy years and low in slack ones, but
over a period of years, each member of
a consulting firm will average from
three thousand to five thousand dollars
per year net revenue.
Compensations other than financial
are not usually considered in estimating
the success of a professional man, but
they are desirable and include public
credit for work performed, association
with men of affairs, freedom of initia-
tive, and the personal satisfaction that
comes from being able to see the phys-
ical embodiment of one's brain chil-
dren. These are the common properties
of all engineers, but the consultant gets
them to a greater degree than falls to
the lot of the engineer who must spend
much of his time in the routine of execu-
tive work.
No better summary of the functions
of the Consulting Engineer can be writ-
ten than is comprised in the nth verse
of the Engineer's Song:
"Who is the man who'll draw a plan
for everything you desire,
From a trans-Atlantic liner, to a
hairpin made of wire?
With 'ifs' and 'ands,' 'how-eres' and
'buts,' to make his meaning clear?
The work-disdaining, fee-retaining,
Consulting Engineer!"
the recurrence of need for his services is regulated by the life
of the structures he erects."

RESIDENTS of metropolitan areas
- seldom see gravel roads and con-
sequently have a tendency to minimize
their importance. However, the gravel
road provides the rural dweller with
a large percentage of his traveling ways.
In an economic system as complex and
inter-related as ours, farm transporta-
tion is of vital importance to urban and
rural population alike. Thus the main-
tenance of graveled highways assumes
an importance not apparent at first
glance.
The safety, convenience, and economy
of gravel roads are being improved by
means of a process known as road
stabilization. This process has been
known for some time, but it is only re-
cently that the underlying principles
have been understood. Stabilization
consists of the consolidation of loose
gravel and crushed stone with clay, soil,
and moisture to form the road surface.
Frequent applications of deliquescent
calcium chloride are desirable to main-
tain the proper moisture content.
The consolidated surface has been
found superior to the loose aggregate in
convenience, economy, and safety. The
elimination of dust and loose flying
particles not only decreases the accident
hazard but also increases the traffic
capacity of the road. It is quite incon-
venient and somewhat dangerous for
cars to trail within two hundred feet
on a surface carrying loose material.
Stabilization, however, removes these
objectionable features and tests have
shown that the natural speed of travel
is increased about ten miles per hour.
Surface consolidation also effects a
saving in maintenance charges by reduc-
ing the amount of loose aggregate
thrown off the road by traffic and snow
plows and by minimizing the dust loss.
In view of the large mileage of traffic-
bound road in the United States, this
annual loss assumes a great economic
significance, both from the standpoint
of added costs and the depletion of natu-
ral resources.
The aggregate loss from untreated,
traffic-bound road surfaces under actual
traffic and climatic conditions had been
estimated at various times, but had
never been accurately measured. Since
1935, the Department of Engineering
Research of the University of Michigan
has been studying this problem for the
Calcium Chloride Association. The in-
vestigation was carried on with the co-
operation of five Michigan counties.
Each county project consisted of three
contiguous sections of gravel road, gen-
erally one mile for each section. Two
projects were carried on for the full pe-
riod from 1935 to date, two for the sea-
sons of 1935-6-7, and one for 1937-8.
These sections were prepared as follows:
1. Stabilized—Three inches of new-
gravel was applied and stabilized ac-
cording to modern design by the addi-
8
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


ride. The surface was maintained by
applications of calcium chloride at a
rate of about ten tons per mile per year
or four pounds per square yard per year.
2. Treated — The ordinary gravel
road was given surface applications of
calcium chloride at the above rate in
addition to maintenance according to
usual county practice.
3. Untreated — The ordinary gravel
road was maintained according to usual
county practice without calcium chlo-
ride treatment.
To obtain the wear on the individual
road sections, bench marks were estab-
lished by driving spikes into telephone
poles or fair sized trees at a point about
six inches higher than the roadway sur-
face. These bench marks were refer-
enced to each other and to headwalls or
other permanent monuments. A lock
link chain with tags at each foot was
lined from the bench mark across the
road with the center-line tag at a meas-
ured distance from the bench. This
chain, resting on the roadway surface,
did not interfere with traffic and indi-
cated the points where rod readings
were to be taken.
A self-reading computing rod gradu-
ated to .01 foot was used for all the rod
readings. Each bench was called ele-
vation 5.00 feet and the rod locked to
read that figure for the height of the
instrument. Graduations on the rod
were inverted; hence, all readings were
actual elevations referred to the bench-
mark. Successive observations, made at
identical points, were tabulated adjacent
to the previously recorded reading.
Errors and discrepancies were at once
obvious in the field. Approximately 500
settings of the rod were averaged into a
single point on the time-wear curve of
each type of roadway. Twenty-five rod
readings gave a point on the time-wear
curve of a single cross section. These
points were plotted and scrutinized for
unusual behavior before inclusion in the
general wear observations.
In order to discern any major dis-
turbance or heave in the various por-
tions of the roadway projects, two hun-
dred and forty steel plates were leveled
and set on concrete beds in post holes
about a foot and a half below the road
surface. Each plate was carefully lined
and witnessed to the bench so that each
spring the distance from road surface to
plate could be accurately measured. In
addition, the distance from plate to
bench mark was accurately determined.
The plates finally served admirably to
indicate a downward plastic flow of the
road-bed of about .02 foot.
A careful record was made of all new
aggregate added to these surfaces dur-
ing the period of investigation. The
cubic yards of apparent wear was, then,
the amount of loose material required
for replacement of the depth lost.
Eighty per cent of the material swept up
is credited to the apparent wear of sta-
bilized or treated roadways which were
swept clean before level rod readings
were taken. Twenty per cent of the
material swept up on a loose gravel sur-
face was charged as dissipated fines be-
cause rod readings were taken on top
of this larger bulk of loose material.
The downward movement of the
plates indicates a flow rather than a
compaction as the density was found to
vary in cycles with moisture and frost.
It must of necessity be accompanied by
lateral flow. Since the material was not
lost, and the movement is a function of
the kind of foundation material, it is
deducted from apparent wear. The tab-
ular values of these quantities, therefore,
require the negative sign.
The wear does not vary directly with
the traffic; indeed, there is an optimum
minimum of rubber tire traffic necessary
to compact the roadway and seal the
plastic surface. The table indicates
wide differences in amounts of apparent
wear per week of use. This condition
came about because of the variation in
the individual environment of each proj-
ect, such as rainfall, wind, and sun-
light. The direction of the roadway, and
the prevailing winds influence the vari-
ous individual losses. However, for each
particular road, these differences tended
to balance out since the mile sections
allotted to each kind of treatment had
approximately the same physical en-
vironment.
The economy of stabilization is, of
course, dependent on the cost of mate-
rial. A saving to the maintenance de-
partment of 149 cubic yards of gravel,
or 62 per cent, is shown for the stabil-
ized road over the loose untreated road.
If maintenance equipment is required
to service 27 miles of roadway on alter-
nate days, then a second large economy
will result for each 54 miles of stabilized
roadway.
If a credit of lc per vehicle minute is
given for the time saved because of the
increase of average speed, that saving
alone will justify stabilization even with
traffic below 100 vehicles per day. It
is evident that except in those localities
where aggregates are plentiful at low
cost, an economy to the road depart-
ment will result from road stabilization.

iPanie/ 14/efotez Mead
by
JOHN STUART ELSNER, '39E
WALTON A. RODGER, '39E
DR. Daniel Webster Mead is one of
the most striking men that we
have ever had the pleasure of meeting.
Seventy-six years old, Dr. Mead, or
D.W., as he calls himself, has for the
past half century been one of the out-
standing Civil Engineers in the coun-
try. During the course of his career,
practically every engineering honorary
has awakened to the fact that Dr. Mead
should be listed among its members. We
could list them all, but Who's Who in
Engineering uses better than half a page
in doing just that, so we'll let you look
them up there.
Notwithstanding all the honors, Dr.
Mead is a real down-to-earth man, and
one of the things he is quite insistent
about is that he has never taken himself
very seriously. "Don't take yourself
seriously," he warns, "in fact don't take
anyone very seriously."

...
and to some a life work that is fascinating."
To really understand this man it is
necessary to glance at his early life. He
was born thirty-eight years before the
turn of the century in a small, upstate
New York town. Early in his grammar
school days he decided he wanted to be-
come an engineer. Of course, at that
time he didn't know much about engi-
neering but was fascinated with what
he did know of it. He left high school
early and went to work because his high
school course seemed inadequate for col-
lege preparation. This was before the
day of the forty hour week so he worked
ten hours a day for three dollars a week.
It was during this time that he acquired
his healthy regard for hard work. He
has absolutely no use for the present
"the world owes me a living" attitude.
Sixty hours a week was not enough to
keep young Dan busy. He made up his
mind that he wanted to enter Cornell,
and furthermore, that h? wanted to en-
ter the sophomore class. Now one of his
annoying traits is that, once having
made up his mind to do something, he
generally does it, so after working and
studying for two years he entered Cor-
nell—in the sophomore class—the class
of '84. Of course, he was not satisfied
with merely the prescribed courses; he
took in addition practically every other
course in sight.
Since college, Dr. Mead has worked
with the U. S. Geological Survey, acted
us city engineer, dabbled with contract-

10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


students at the University of Wisconsin,
and has become one of the country's
leading consulting engineers in his field
of hydraulic engineering.
His long association with the engineer-
ing profession has given him some very
definite opinions. He is vitally interested
in the profession and the men "who are
to carry the torch" of engineering for
the next fifty years.
His experience has shown that al-
though honesty in business has become
somewhat outmoded of late, the man
who has the reputation for being square
will be the one to succeed in the long
run. This matter of honesty in work
often becomes a very difficult problem.
So many borderline cas?s arise. For the
young engineer these questions are
doubly perplexing. Dr. Mead thinks that
in such cases it is necessary to exercise
a little common sense. If the matter in
question is minor, he can afford to let it
pass. However, if property or human life
is to be endangered, he would rather quit
than be connected with the enterprise.
For, like any other professional man,
the engineer has a grave responsibility
to society.
Dr. Mead admits that he has probably
formed his ideas with regard to honesty
through his long association with muni-
cipal and other governmental construc-
tion. In submitting bids, he has run into
situations where politicians have de-
manded bribes in return for approval
of his bid. It has been his life-long pol-
icy to refuse to have anything to do
with such deals, and by following this
plan religiously he has gained an ad-
mirable reputation for honesty and
square dealing. Of course his determina-
tion to play square has cost him a num-
ber of jobs—often at times when he
needed the business badly. But he has
come out ahead, for now his reputation
is his best and only needed advertise-
ment. In fact he has at times (during
rush seasons) tried to decrease his vol-
ume of business by increasing his fees,
but has often been retained notwith-
standing.
Though Dr. Mead is a member of a
large number of fraternal and similar
organizations, a person would be ill-ad-
vised if he went to him expecting undue
consideration because of these connec-
tions. He feels that work should come to
an engineer because he is John W. Jones
and not because he belongs to the same

D. W. Mead—He has proved that honesty does pay.
organization as the client. He claims the
reason he has never joined a church is
that he has always been disgusted with
members who attended for business
reasons. Next to dishonesty, hypocrisy is
to him the most distasteful of all traits.
A man does not have to resort to pull-
ing strings to become a success. Applied
hard work is a much better plan to fol-
low. Of course, the definition of success
varies from person to person; to some
it means money, to others the respect of
fellow men. To most it includes, he be-
lieves, a happy family life, and to many
it means a life work that is fascinating.
But whatever a person's conception of
success is, he can achieve it at least
partially if he has a desire to make good,
lots of perseverance, and above all a
whole-hearted determination to play
square.
We suppose that to some Dr. Mead's
ideas may sound like the old fashioned
pep talk. But when a man has seen as
much of engineering as Dr. Mead has,
he is bound to have acquired some pretty
definite ideas. Above all, Dr. Mead is
completely sincere in his beliefs. He has
adhered to these principles throughout
his whole life, and, no matter what
standard you set for comparison, it
would be difficult to judge him a failure.
We mentioned that Dr. Mead had
never joined a church. We do not mean
that he is not a religious man or that he
does not appreciate the value of the
church. To play the game honestly and
squarely—that is his religion. Charles
B. Clarke has written a verse that best
sums up Daniel W. Mead's philosophy
of life:
"I take no thought of my neighbor's
birth
Or the way he makes his prayer;
I grant him a white man's room on
earth
If his game is only square:
While he plays it straight, I call him
'mate,'
If he cheats, I drop him flat:
All rank but that is a wornout lie
For all clean men are as good as I
And the King is only that."

The Ghtk of
■(in -(ihpLane
by
ROBERT C. MAGEE. '37E
Aero Digest
BEING interested in aeronautics, I
had made several friends at the
Midwest Aircraft Company. While vis-
iting with one of these, Chief Engineer
. Peters, an envelope marked "Rush" was
delivered to his office. Glancing through
it briefly, he handed it to me for my
inspection. The contents were as fol-
lows:
Midwest Aircraft Co.
Dear Sirs:
Please submit your plans for a 14-place
transport plane to be used in transcontinental
airline service. Performance will be the cri-
terion for selection of competitive designs if
the price is not prohibitive. Bids must be re-
ceived by Dec. 31, 1938. The Union Airlines
will guarantee purchase of at least fifteen
planes of the accepted design.
Hoping to hear from you in the near fu-
ture, I remain
Yours truly,
John C. Smith.
Pres., Union Airlines.
After reading the order, and having
been informed by Mr. Peters that he in-
tended to submit plans, I felt an eager
curiosity regarding the manner in which
these plans were to be made. I asked
him if he would be so good as to reveal
to me some of the inner workings in-
volved in their development.
After his affirmative reply, I asked,
"What kind of a plane do you think
will be needed to beat the competition
in this case?"
"Oh, I think," said Mr. Peters, "that
a plane with a cruising speed of 250
miles per hour will be sufficient to out-
do any plane of its type now in exist-
ence: S3 with this speed as our ultimate
goal, we can get under way with the
design."
"Just where do you begin?" I asked
wonderingly.
"Well, it's really very simple," said
Mr. Peters, "we've gone through the
process before and that will save a good
deal of time. You see, we know that the
speed of a plane depends on two fac-
tors: the horsepower required to pull
the plane through the air, and the horse-
power of the engine and propeller avail-
able. Do you follow me?"
"Yes," I nodded, "that doesn't seem
too difficult."
"Besides this information," he con-
tinued, "we know that the former quan-
tity depends on the air resistance, that
is, the drag of the plane and the speed
at which it flies."
"But how do you know the drag be-
fore you have begun the calculations?"
"Well, of course, we have to assume
it at this stage of the game, but, then
again, our engineers won't miss their
guess by much. You see, we already
have have the actual values of drag on
many similar planes. With a little care-
ful checking and comparing I can count
on them to come out with an answer
that is surprisingly close to the value
which later can be proven in the wind
tunnel."
Needless to say, some trifling doubt
crept up in my mind as to the outcome
of this free and easy assurance. With a
mental note to keep my fingers crossed,
yet not wishing to give away the extent
of my small store of knowledge, I re-
plied confidently, "That, all sounds very
good to me. Where do we go from
here?"
"Next we'll find what horsepower is
required to drive the plane at 250 miles
per hour. What would your guess be?"
"Oh, oh," I thought to myself, "now
he's got me. Let me see, let me see . . ."
Casting about frantically in my un-
trained mind, praying that lady luck
would throw an idea into my head,
suddenly I had it—Dad's old tractor-
I remembered that it had a hundred
horsepower engine and, realizing that
this plane wasn't to be over three or
four times as large, I made a rapid cal-
culation and replied with calm cer-
tainty, "Oh, I should say in the neigh-
borhood of 400 horsepower. Is that too
much?"
Luckily for my ego, I did not notice
the amused grin on Mr- Peter's face as
he answered drily, "I guess our en-
gineers are not very capable. They'd
probably get about 2000."
Needless to say, I wisely permitted
him to continue with his story without
any plan of further interruption in the
near future.
"We know the horsepower needed to
force the plane to reach it's ultimate
goal and now our next step is to look
for engines to furnish that power. We
would have our choice of using two
high-powered engines or three lower-
powered ones, but this choice does not

part, and we can go on to the design of
the fuselage and wings."
"What factors will guide your selec-
tion of the proper type of body for
your plane?" I queried, forgetting my
plan of a few seconds ago.
"That is simple enough, we'll merely
design our wing and fuselage so that
their combined drag will be as small as,
or smaller than, the value we assumed
for them. We have at our command
certain definite data from which we
can draw. We know that this is to be a
fourteen-place ship." Here Mr. Peters
paused to explain that accommoda-
tions for the pilot, co-pilot, and stew-
ardess are included in the above-men-
tioned space.
Continuing, he said: "This limits our
overall dimensions rather closely, mean-
ing we can draw up several fuselage
contours to be checked in the wind tun-
nel for minimum drag. If we presume
the weight of the plane to be 1000
pounds per person, which has been
proven plausible by past experimenta-
tion, it will quite obviously give us a
gross weight of 14000 pounds."
I noticed that he placed a good deal
of emphasis on the words "quite ob-
viously" but whether or not it was for
my benefit is debatable.
"Using this weight we can readily
determine the size and shape of the
wing needed. When the plans for the
fuselage and wing are completed, we
will build wooden models to scale.
Then we can introduce a series of ex-
haustive wind tunnel tests in which
several fuselage and wing contours can
be checked for minimum drag and for
th? lifting power of the wing."
At this point, I couldn't help remark-
ing, "There certainly is a great deal
more to this plane building business than
I had imagined. Are there many more
operations to be gone through before
we have the plane in a complete form?"
"Young fellow," replied Mr. Peters
softly, "at the risk of filling your head
with a maelstrom of conflicting ideas,
I am afraid that you have thus far only
been exposed to the simplest end of the
development of our little undertaking.
For example, the model will still have
to be remolded several times, it's coun-
tour changed by shaving off parts of
the wood, or possibly by adding new
curves with beeswax. Eventually we will
develop a scale model of the plane that
to the best of our knowledge will rep-
resent all that we desire in streamlining.
And even when this stage is reached,
you must remember that this is only a
scale model with which we have been
working, and we still have to take the
data from the wind tunnel tests, ren-
dering it applicable to the full scale
values. We will then have a fairly true
indication of the performance of the
completed plane."
"Wouldn't it be terrible if you were
to make a mistake in your original
estimates of drag? It would certainly be
a shame if you had to begin" all over
again."
"That," said Mr. Peters, "is one
point on which you and I agree. As-
suming for the present that all works
out as anticipated, we have yet another
approximation to check relative to the
matter of weight. Our detail weight
analysis might check within 2 percent,
yet the final weight could vary slightly
more. In fact, we couldn't be sure with-
out building a test job. The usual
method of solving this problem is to
continue with the design and hope that

ON SEEKING INFORMATION
IF you were a graduate wishing for a
given line of work in a certain city,
and if you went to the city as a com-
plete stranger—how would you find the
firms that might use you? Also, how
could you sort the firms into "more de-
sirable" and "less desirable," before ap-
proaching them? It is not the purpose
here to enumerate the several lines of
attack; rather, a story that is pertinent
in some ways will be told.
Recently, I wished to get in touch
with someone in Detroit who could help
me to assemble some facts concerning
inventions and patents. It seemed that
reputable patent attorney firms might
have some of the information. Now,
there are several ways by which I can
very soon be placed in touch with such
firms. I deliberately ignored them all,
and on a certain afternoon this fall set
out to conduct an experiment.
After parking the car and eating
lunch, I walked to the nearest large
office building—but not to look for pat-
ent attorneys. Looking for one at ran-
dom will all too probably land one in
the clutches of a shyster. Instead, I de-
cided to search bulletin boards for names
of engineering firms; then, to ask some-
one in such a firm to recommend to me
a good patent attorney firm. So, playing
the game that I was a stranger in De-
troit, wholly ignorant of the city, and
equipped only with a reasonable amount
of common sense, I picked out a big
building and walked in. The condensed
record for the afternoon follows:
1. David Whitney Building. A total
loss. Bulletin board simply jammed
with office listings for the professions of
M.D. and D.D.S. To street again:
sighted other large buildings up Wood-
ward.
2. First National Bank Building.
Two or three engineering firms. Picked
one, went up. No use: a construction
firm, little or no interest in inventions
and patents.
3. Penobscot Building. Bad luck. Got
side-tracked. Michigan law graduate
who used to be next-door neighbor here,
caught me snooping around the bulle-
tin board. Told him my mission. He in-
sisted on naming a reputable patent
attorney firm. Thanked him, but se-
cretly decided on not using this "unfair"
information on this experimental after-
noon. Enjoyable visit with him. It used
up that building's fair share of time, so
left.
4. Dime Bank Building. Better luck;
found controller company listed. Went
up; it was a sales office. Met sales en-
gineer. Inquired for patent attorney
firm. Instead, was promptly told of a
man who has long been an inventor, and
a developer of inventions of others.
His offices? Right across the light shaft,
this same floor, around two corners.
5. Mr. Oliver E. Barthel, the man re-
ferred to. Found him in. Spent the
afternoon with him. Early associate of
Henry Ford's. Designed Ford's first
racing car. First engineer for Cadillac.
Designed other early jobs. Holds some
35 patents. Father, brother, patent at-
torneys. Mr. Barthel, a lifetime in in-
vention. Expert witness, and so on.
Many engineer graduates from here
have found their way to him: he has
voluntarily placed perhaps a hundred in
Detroit industries, during his long ca-
reer.
6. Met another man in his office, Mr.
Theobald — inventor of the infra-red
windshield defroster, and other items.
Spent the evening with him. (This ends
the condensed record.)
Can a graduate in a strange city take
a few hours and begin to trace down
information that will be important in
his placement problems? It would seem
so. Furthermore, he will usually find
that people are amazingly helpful. More
yet: time and again, contacts made dur-
ing the process yield sidelights, odd and
useful insights, acquaintances; and, one
constantly "runs the danger" of being
drawn towards something that is even
better than the thing originally intended
as the objective.

ECONOMY-WITH A MORAL
FLAME HARDENING of steel where exceptional wear re-
sistant properties are required is comparatively new,
but the economies resulting from its application in
conjunction with Molybdenum steels, are most signifi-
cant. They are graphic proof of the cash value of
constantly re-studying your production processes and
material specifications in the light of improved methods
and Moly steels.
When high wear resistance plus good physical
properties are required, flame hardening makes the
use of relatively inexpensive alloy steels possible.
Molybdenum steels, particularly SAE 4140, 4150 and
high Carbon (0.40-0.50% C) Manganese Molybdenum,
are exceptionally suited for flame hardening. They are
practically fool-proof. Molybdenum (next to Carbon)
is the most effective hardening agent normally added
to steel.
Molybdenum steels and irons make production dol-
lars go further in many ways. Our booklet, "Molyb-
denum in Steel", containing a great deal of practical
data will be sent free on request to technical students
and others interested.

cops
Every once in a while we find it nec-
essary to change our minds completely
about a person or group of persons. For
instance—we always used to feel that
Ann Arbor cops in general were lower
than the proverbial reptilian abdomen.
But then a friend of ours related this
experience which happened to him the
Tuesday morning that classes resumed.
He lives quite a distance from Ann Ar-
bor and has one of those sweet little
permits which allows him to drive home
but requires that he impound the ve-
hicle here during the interim.
It was 7:57 that Tuesday morning
as our friend hit the city limits on
Washtenaw—three minutes before the
campus cops with pad and pencil got
busy. In his hurry to get that car in
the garage he neglected to watch the lit-
tle matter of speed limits. Suddenly
that sour-visaged representative of law
and order who prances up and down
Washtenaw appeared by the side of the
car.

The usual pleasantries in regard to
conflagration were held and then the
cop said, "Say, aren't you a University
student?'" With sinking spirits our
friend explained his predicament.
The cop glared at him and finally
said, "You University students seem to
feel that Ann Arbor cops are pretty
mean. Well, don't let me ever hear you
make any such remarks as that after
this. Get going!"
As we said, we have completely re-
vised our opinion of the local constabu-
lary.
gargoyle
We were surprised to see the Gar-
goyle come out last month.
In fact we're surprised the Gargoyle
ever comes out.
Now that we think about it perhaps
it would be just as well if it didn't come
out at all.
The Gargoyle's appearance in De-
cember was even more surprising than
usual. The day we took our January
copy to the printers the pressroom was
in a dither. The sterling staff of that
most outstanding publication, the Gar-
goyle, had just brought in the last of
their December copy. The Press swore
they could never finish the job before
Christmas. Apparently they did, how-
ever, but we wonder at what cost. The
day foreman quit as soon as the job
was finished.
Even more surprising was the fact
that there were one or two very inter-
esting things in that December issue.
For instance there was page 9—a full
page ad from the Ann Arbor Press. We
even have to admit that we learned
something from this issue. It seems
that the joke which we credited to the
Gargoyle in our November issue came
originally from a 1915 Technic. We
did not believe that at first but a little
delving into our dusty manuscripts
proved that the Gargoyle was right.
We salaam with all due respect.
However, we would like to point out
that the version credited to us by our
friends was not the correct one. As it
actually appeared in the 1915 Technic
I he joke read:
"Who was that lady I seen you with
last night?"
"That was no lady; that was my
Gar-goylc."
proof
We feel pretty good. We just got
some evidence that supports one of our
pet theories.
We have long been of the opinion that
people are not normally, naturally bad,
but that they pick up questionable
traits from their environment. Thus we
have held that the average person, when
confronted with a choice between good
and evil, will, if he makes an immediate
decision, choose the good. It is only
when he stops to meditate that he
chooses the other course.

Our theory has been subjected to
much ridicule in bull sessions, but now
we have some concrete evidence to sup-
port our claim.
The other day we inadvertently wan-
dered into a State Street restaurant for
a bite to eat. As we sat there, numerous
people presented their checks to the
cashier, settled, and left. One fellow
picked up his change and started for
the door counting the money as he went.
Suddenly he paused and counted the
money again—more carefully this time.
He turned and started back to the cash-
ier. But then—he paused again. He
was facing us as he debated. His face
plainly showed the moral struggle going
on inside. And then—-he turned and
left.
Number One on our list of already
sadly shattered New Year's Resolutions
is a resolve that hereafter we will fol-
low our first impulse. We hope to keep
this one.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Our bureaucratic University makes a
lot of humorous mistakes, but we did
think that the Communications Depart-
ment was doing a fairly good job. But
again our faith has been shaken.
The other day we walked into our
office and found our telephone gone—
instrument, bell box, and even the wires
had disappeared. At first we thought
some pesky chemical engineer had been
playing tricks. But investigation re-
vealed otherwise.
Last June the Business Department
asked us if we wanted our telephone
disconnected for the summer. Always on
the look-out for ways to save money, we
agreed. (For the benefit of those con-
templating similar action next summer,
you save exactly $1.43.)
Somehow when the Business Depart-
ment gave the good news to the Tele-
phone Company, the order was recorded
as a removal of the phone. Late in No-
vember they finally got around to filling
the order—and that is the explanation
of the missing phone.
We got the best of the deal, though.
Our old instrument had been dropped so
many times that it sounded like the
original gramophone. They replaced it
with one of the newest types—and we
can actually hear over it.
So if you want to call the office and
tell us that you would like a subscrip-
tion sent home to your parents, we will
be able to hear quite nicely—thank you.
reprimand
We don't wish to give the impression
of nagging, nor do we want people to
think that we are deliberately picking
on the Lit School. We always try to
avoid picking on people weaker than
we are.
But we couldn't help noticing the
latest blunder of our alleged journalists
on the Michigan Daily. Recently they
ran a cut with a caption to the effect
that since winter was on its way, re-
pairs were under way "like these on the
East Engineering Building."
Now that was fine. We really should
feel elated that they actually ran an
engineering picture at all. But there
were two things wrong. In the first
place the cut showed the Engineering
Annex; and in the second no repair
work was being done—a chimney was
being removed.
Speaking of the Annex reminds us
that we have been hearing some com-
ment about our prolific use of the tower
of this building as material for our cov-
ers. We would just like to point out
that Paramount News used this same
tower as a background when they chose
Ralph Heikkinen on their Ail-American
football team.
After all, fellows, we could use Ford's
smokestacks.
uncensored
Some time ago we first began to
consider publishing an article on the
birth of an airplane. Realizing that this
is a delicate subject, we have approached
the matter with considerable trepida-
tion.
However, we have felt that it is a
subject about which the public should
be better informed and so we are pre-
senting in this issue (page 12) the com-
plete and fully illustrated story.
The article has been printed on the
centerspread so that if, after you have
read it yourself, you do not feel that it
is wise for your parents to see it, you
may rip the pages out before showing
the issue to them.

Reid
Hartwell
professor eichelberger
Everyone who has taken Engineering
Drawing at Michigan knows "Ikey."
He has always been liked by his stu-
dents because he takes time to remem-
ber them after they have left his classes
and gone on in school and even out into
the world.
After graduating from Michigan
Agricultural College (now Michigan
State College) in 1916 with a B.S. in
Mechanical Engineering, Professor Eich-
elberger worked in the shops and draft-
ing rooms of both the Olds and Reo
Motor Companies in Lansing. During
the years of the World War, he was in
the Ordnance Department of the Army,
working in Washington, D.C., as a com-
puter on coast artillery. In Washington
he met Colonel Miller who is now head
cf the Engineering Drawing Depart-
ment here at Michigan. After the war,
they went to Baltimore together and
worked on plant engineering for two
years.
Professor Eichelberger came to Michi-
gan in 1922 as a member of the Engi-
neering Drawing Department, and he
has been teaching here since then. Soon
after he came, he was given the job
of starting a blue print room and putting
it on a working basis. From a very small
enterprise at the start in which he him-
self did all the work, it has grown until
today it does a good share of the com-
mercial blue printing work in this vicin-
ity. He is faculty adviser of the class
of 1940, having been elected to that
position by the class two years ago. He
is also an honorary member of the Mich-
igan chapter of Scabbard and Blade.
He has one hobby and enjoys that one
a great deal. He likes to drive, take
apart, and find out all about cars. He
says he has been this way about cars
ever since he has owned one. There is
nothing he would like better than to
have a perfectly equipped garage where
he could tinker with cars.
If you haven't met "Ikey" yet you
should take a walk up to the fourth
floor and you will find him in his office,
in a drawing room, or in the blue print
room. We know you'll find it was time
well spent.
bob reid
He is classified as Reid, Robert A.,
and his home is in Detroit. Delving into
this gent's past, we couldn't find much
about his early youth except that he had
a passion for riding home with the coal-
man or iceman. Our hopes brightened,
though, as we let a few years slip past.
The first beam of light appeared when
we found that Bob went to high school
at Detroit Northern. From then on it
was easy. For instance, in high school,
Bob or "Rab" to his friends, though he
doesn't know why, was captain of both
the hockey and golf teams, getting his
varsity letter in both sports.
Then he set out directly for the Uni-
versity of Michigan, and showed his
good taste here by entering the Engi-
neering School to aim for a B.S. in
Mechanical Engineering. He spent his
first year along athletic lines, taking in
freshman football, hockey, and golf. In
his sophomore year he changed his mind,
dropped athletics and tried out for the
Interfraternity Council. His junior year
saw him still on the Council, being
tapped by Triangles, and posing for
pictures as J-Hop Chairman. Now, in his
senior year, as the snowball of success
gains even more momentum, we find
Bob, who is a Sigma Phi, President of
the Interfraternity Council, on the
Men's Council, in the A.S.M.E., and a
member of Vulcans and Michigamua,
engineering and all-campus honoraries
respectively.
In his hobbies, Rab prefers the more
athletic type, being primarily interested

hunting. Wed like to see his secondary
list! During the Thanksgiving vacation,
Bob, just back from an Interfraternity
all-expense-paid trip to New York, in-
dulged in his hunting hobby in Canada
successfully enough to provide the fam-
ily pantry with a sufficient supply of
clucks to last until the next pay day
rolls around.
Rab will graduate in June. When
questioned about his post-graduation
plans, he replied seriously enough that
he would ''retire and travel." Then re-
laxing a bit, "No, I think I'd like to
get into sales work." Well, Bob, here's
hoping, but that "retire and travel"
idea sounds pretty enticing to us!
bob hartwell
Robert Wellington Hartwell is essen-
tially a local boy. Born and raised in
Detroit, he still calls that city home,
and has never been farther away from
it than Tennessee. Furthermore, he is
one of a line of Michigan men, with an
older brother an alumnus and a younger
in attendance at the present time. Bob
established habits of hard work and
varied activity while still in Northwest-
ern High School, holding offices in the
Hi-Y Club and on the Student Council,
swimming on the varsity team, and
spending his afternoons in the employ
of the Whitman Barnes Twist Drill
Company. For recreation he sailed, col-
lected stamps and delved into photog-
raphy.
Graduating from high school in Janu-
aiy, 1935, Bob came to the University
the following September and enrolled
in the engineering school. Here he has
continued his partial self-support, work-
ing for the Graduate Department and
as a student assistant in the Drawing
Department. Bob received Freshman
numerals in swimming, and went out
for the varsity the following two years.
In the meantime he was elected Vice-
President of the Sophomore class, and
had become interested in Congress, of
which he was a District President in his
Junior year. This year Hartwell is a
Senior, taking his first year in the Busi-
ness Administration School on the com-
bined curriculum. He is president of
Congress and is working very hard for
a strong independent men's organization.
He is also a member of the Men's Coun-
cil, Triangles, Vulcans, Michigamua, and
Tau Beta Pi, and was elected Senior
Engineering Council Representative last
month.
Bob spent most of last summer sail-
ing competitively as a member of the
Hickory Island Yacht Club, located at
a short drive from Detroit on Lake Erie.
One day there was revealed a trace of
temperament which is rather foreign to
bis usual demeanor. An intra-club race
was being run off, and, as the boats
approached the starting mark, one par-
ticularly zealous rival kept edging closer
and closer, till the Hartwell crew was
obliged to protest and signal repeatedly
for sea room, but to no avail. By the
time the first marker was rounded, a
true Wellington ire was aroused, and
when an opportunity unfortunately pre-
sented itself, a far from unpremediated
collision occurred, bow to midships. The
Hartwell boat was disqualified, but they
won enough of the remaining races to
capture the club trophy for the season.
Another characteristic Bob says he is
accused of possessing is frugality to a
fault. If such be the case, it should be
of some value to him when he enters his
chosen field of industrial management,
after graduating from school a year from
next June.

benches' past
While rummaging about in the old cut
files the other day, we ran across this
heirloom from a 1917 publication. After
penetrating the last twenty years' layers
of fingerprints, jam, dust, and what have
you, we noticed those benches lined up
along the diagonal. That started us
wondering. Why don't we have them
now? They look awfully convenient.
Forthwith we donned our old clothes and
buried ourselves deep in the archives.
We finally came up with this tale, re-
counted under front page headlines in
a 1927 Detroit Free Press. May we
quote:
"Ann Arbor, April 19:—Students at
the University of Michigan today rose
in revolt against the action of the uni-
versity last week in removing their sen-
ioi benches, flanking the diagonal walk,
long a vantage point for the review of
coeds, and began what promises to be a

long drawn out war between students
and faculty members. The day ended
with the university leading, but with
plans being laid for tomorrow that may
put the students far ahead.
"The benches, which were objected to
by parents whose daughters were, it is
claimed, subjected to ill-placed remarks
on the part of students who frequented
them, were taken by the school author-
ities during the vacation period last
week, but with the return of the stu-
dents today, trouble started.
"Soon after classes opened this morn-
ing, soap boxes, barrels, and tall stools
appeared miraculously and before the
day was an hour old, the students were
again in their vantage points, remarking
upon passing coeds and talking a bit
loudly about a university that would
take away their benches, since soap
boxes were so uncomfortable.
"With the vantage gained, things
seemed to favor the students until the
middle of the afternoon. During a period
when the students were in their class-
rooms, a truck drove up, and men me-
thodically began loading the boxes upon
it. The students in adjoining classrooms
yelled their rage from windows, but
could do no more.
"Now the students, momentarily
thwarted, are laying plans for tomorrow
that they prophesy no university can
thwart. They plan to bring small boxes
that will be carried about with them,
using them as benches to view the coeds
between classes, and carrying them into
the classrooms when in school.
"The benches were gifts to the univer-
sity from the senior engineering classes
of 1909 and 1911 and became by custom
the exclusive property of upperclassmen.
Lined up along the walk in late fall and
in the spring, the seniors at first used the
vantage point to plague freshmen. First
year students were forced to doff their
green 'pots' almost continuously while
going to and from classes.
"Later, the baiting of freshmen became
less interesting and the upperclassmen
turned their attention to the coeds. From
this an interesting little game was de-
vised which eventually spelled the down-
fall of the benches.
"The men would draw circles in chalk
on the walk and then grade the girls ac-
cording to general attractiveness. The
university grading system was used,
with 'A' standing for the senior's idea
of a perfect coed, while an ;E' signified
a failure.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the pastime. Those who were graded
highly were sufficiently complimented
not to object to the practice and those
who were unable to measure up to the
men's ideals would not admit it. Parents,
though, heard of the little game and the
removal of the benches resulted."
A few days later the D. F. P. again
ran headlines plus a large shot of the
diagonal. This time the students had
played their trump card, and moved a
section of heavy benches called "Clippy
Stadium" from a far corner of the campus
to the diagonal reviewing-stand position.
The situation had taken on a grim aspect,
but law and order finally prevailed. After
the smoke had cleared away and the
treaty was drawn up and duly signed,
the senior benches reappeared, a little to
the side of the diagonal in their present
circular form.
Today we still practice the between-
class review in a modified form, but we
somehow manage to be a little more sub-
dued about it all. Or could it possibly be
that the coeds lack some of their former
diversity and appeal?
editor
Following our usual procedure in at-
tempting to throw the spotlight on the
personal side of our authors, we wrote
a letter to Leslie D. Goddard, Michigan
'1 IE, whose article on Consulting ap-
pears on page five of this issue, and
asked him for some inside dope. We
liked his reply so well that we are relay-
ing it straight on to you. To open, of all
places, in the middle, we find:
"Honors during scholastic days may
be enumerated as follows:
"In Freshman year, had the honor of
holding the door of the surveying build-
ing open while Johnny Garrels carried
his transit through. In Sophomore year,
Joe Magidson and I helped Germany
Schultz complete his plate on Cycloidal
Gears before the Thanksgiving Day
deadline. Was Vice-President of the
Engineering Society in Junior year, and
Editor of the Technic in Senior year.
In Grad School, did nothing but study.
Made Who's Who in Engineering
since then. Celebrated 25th Class Re-
union on a hospital bed in University
Hospital. Active practice now confined to
recuperation from that experience. For
the real low-down refer to Professors
Swinton and Bouchard.
"Further, affiant sayeth not."
Ed. Note. Johnny Garrels and Joe Magid-
son were backs, and Germany Schultz an Ail-
American center, on the Michigan '07-09
football team.
awards
On Thursday, December eighth, the
A.I.Ch.E. held its annual fall ban-
quet, at which Professor Badger was the
guest speaker. During this banquet, the
annual scholarship award was presented
to Dave Cushing, '40E, for being the
Junior Chem Engineer with the highest
average for his freshman and sopho-
more years. Dave's average is a solid
4.0.
Then December fourteenth saw the
A.S.M.E. members congregated for their
annual roast. The high point of the
evening came when the "Spoofuncup,"
a humorously degrading award backed
by a long and weighty tradition, was
carried off victoriously by Professor
Axel Marin.

GLEANINGS FROM HERE AND THERE
glass in engineering
Researches of the last three years in
the field of fiber glass have brought
forth many new applications which
promise increased use of the material in
several branches of industry. The new
glass textiles have been found especially
suitable for electric, heat, and sound in-
sulation and air filters. Work in most
of these fields is well beyond the theo-
retical stage, and production has already
started at plants in Newark, Ohio, and
Corning, New York.
As one line of possible development,
consider the field of electric insulation.
Because of the high heat resistance of
fiber glass, motors utilizing it can take
overloads of 100 percent or more with-
out short circuits or damage to insula-
tion. Another advantage of the new
material is resistance to acids and mois-
ture. Due to its smaller bulk, motors of
a given power can be made one-third
smaller than formerly. This fact, to-
gether with the use of fiber glass sepa-
rator plates in storage batteries, may
even have an important effect on auto-
motive design.
whirling rotor
Super-heated steam, so hot that it
turns steel cherry red, drives the new
26,000 horse-power turbine generator
that produces enough power in Wichita,
Kansas, to light 800,000 house lamps at
the same time. Racing into the heart of
the turbine at the rate of 237,000
pounds an hour, the steam turns the
22,500 pound rotor 3600 times a min-
ute. The outer tip of the longest rotor
blade speeds at 858 miles an hour. At
that rate a train could travel from Ann
Arbor to Chicago in about a quarter of
an hour. The steel shaft in turn drives
the rotor of the twenty-two million watt
generator. Steam, in order to attain
such a high degree of power and effi-
ciency, is forced into the turbine cham-
bers at 825 degrees Fahrenheit, and ex-
hausted at a temperature less than 100
degrees, and considerably less than at-
mospheric pressure.
Paradoxically, the most delicate part
of the mechanism is also the largest—
the mighty rotor. This shaft was made
in one piece from a pressed and forged
steel ingot, then bored through from end
to end. After reaming and polishing,
the hole through the shaft was examined
with a magnifying periscope, guarding
against imperfections.
cable testing
A new method of testing insulating
materials for use on high-voltage electric
cables has been developed recently, in
which small models are employed in-
stead of the full-sized cables formerly
used. These miniature cables are sub-
jected to much more severe electrical
stresses than would ever occur in serv-
ice, and the durability of their insula-
tion is studied. In addition, post-
mortem examination of the specimens
after failure has taken place shows how
the high-voltage electrons bombarded
the insulation and burned through,
layer by layer, revealing faults in de-
sign which may be corrected in future
models.
Since this miniature-sample type of
experiment is much less expensive than
the large-scale tests, the number of vari-
ations of materials and conditions that
may be investigated is correspondingly
much greater. It is from many hun-
dreds of such experiments that research
engineers seek to learn how the best
possible combination of materials can

propel lor study
Another step in achieving optimum
safety and increased payload of aircraft
has been attained as a result of the de-
velopment of a new vibration study
technique. The new procedure allows a
prediction of propellor behavior based on
the knowledge of vibration stresses at
any point on the propellor during actual
operation; thus incipient fatigue fail-
ures at definitely ascertained points can
be overcome by necessary adjustment.
The method is based on the phenome-
non that certain materials increase and
decrease their electrical resistance in
direct proportion to the stresses imposed
upon them. The resistor is cemented
longitudinally to the propellor blade and
insulated from it electrically. Two fine
wires are then connected to its ends, and
to a source of direct current. Since the
propellor blade tends to stretch under
stress, the resistor stretches with it;
thus, the change in stress can be meas-
ured directly by recording the decrease
in current flowing through the system.
The successful completion of the study
brings to light another instance where
the continued efforts of the engineer
have solved a long standing problem in
a capable and efficient way.

factor, upon which the other calcula-

Providing these performance factors are
satisfactory, the theoretical calculations
could be ended and the plans for actual

"At this point," said Mr. Peters, "we
would then enter into the really difficult
phase of planning. From here on,
even greater care would have to be
taken, that not the smallest detail be
allowed to escape the watchful surveil-
lance of the technicians. Although the
general contour of the ship would be
known, the internal construction would
have to be planned. Each strut, rib, and
spar would require stress analyis and
would have to possess sufficient strength
to carry the load imposed upon it under
the most unfavorable conditions. Before
this prelude to the final assembly could
be begun, sketches of different types of
construction would have to be drawn
and discussed. They would have to be
made, meanwhile keeping in mind the
location of the wing, the passenger seats
and windows, as well as the landing
gear, so that no member of the structure
could interfere with another. Members
subject to high stresses, such as wing
connections to the fuselage, or motor
fastenings to the wing, would entail
special bracing.

decided upon, the external forces acting

on the plane during flight would have
to be evaluated. These forces could then
be applied to a scale drawing of the
framework at their respectively correct
points of application. A stress engineer
would determine the load that each
member of the structure would be re-
quired to carry and from this the result-
ing size of the member necessary."
"I am certain I would never have the
patience to tackle a job like that."
"Yes, it would be a tedious job, but
the safety of the plane depends on the
ability and painstaking attention to
detail on the part of the specialist at-
tached to this department- His reward
would be culminated in the evolution of
a truly stable plane. Moreover, the
stress engineer would literally be
caught between two fires, the problems
of safety and weight. Paradoxically, he
would be required to design members
strong enough for safety and yet light
enough to prevent overburdening the
ship. This means he could not design
for a /Safety factor of 5 or 10, but
would be required to keep around the
accepted value of 1.5.
"The stress analysis completed, the
engineer would have to study the spe-
cial problems relative to the plane. Such
matters as the type of control systems
to be used, interior furnishings, and
other minor aspects would be com-
pletely covered in the plans.
"And now let us project ourselves to
the long awaited completion; finished
plans have been made into a report
which will give easy access to perform-
ance figures and to the price which was
estimated by our cost accountant. This
report is sent to the Union Airline Com-
pany, and now all we can do is to await
further developments and hope our
plans are accepted.
"Possibly you may have found it dif-
ficult at times to appreciate the full
significance of the various steps I have
mentioned. My intention was to ac-
quaint you with a chronologically cor-
rect picture of all the operations which
would be involved, from the time that
a request for plans of this particular type
of plane was submitted to my depart-
ment, until the moment it would emerge,
a finished product."
So saying, Mr. Peters excused him-
self, after receiving my thanks for what
I considered a most interesting inter-
view.

OPPORTUNITY FOR RESEARCH
SELECTED graduates of American colleges carry on
research work each year in chemistry, physics, and
physical chemistry with the aid of Charles A. Coffin
Foundation Fellowships. These fellowships were established
by General Electric in 1922 in honor of the Company's
first President, Charles A. Coffin.
The awards are made by a committee of distinguished men.
This year the committee consists of Dr. Bergen Davis,
representing the National Academy of Sciences; Dr.
Karl T. Compton, of the Society for the Promotion of
Engineering Education; and Dr. John C. Parker, of the
American Institute of Electrical Engineers. The candidates'
applications, together with the faculty recommendations
forwarded to General Electric by the various colleges, are
the basis for the awards.
This year, applications for the fellowships must be in the
hands of the Secretary of the Charles A. Coffin Founda-
tion Committee, at Schenectady, on January 15, 1939.

HAWAII IH NEW YORK
TWO men sat down at a table recently and decided to
air-condition Hawaii.
But they weren't concerned with changing the atmosphere
above Diamond Head Mountain or the" Beach atWaikiki."
Their problem was centered in Manhattan; "Hawaii"
is the Hawaiian Room ot New York's Hotel Lexington,
where a 120-ton G-E air-conditioning system is being
installed. Not only will it assure greater comfort for the
patrons, but it will preserve an Hawaiian atmosphere—
heretofore the atmosphere varied with New York's sea-
sons.
The many Test men and ex-Test men assigned to air-
conditioning work are ever seeking new applications for
this G-E equipment. The results ot their efforts can be seen
in all parts ot the country. Cliff House in San Francisco,
overlooking the famous Seal Rocks, recently made its
air-conditioned debut. "The Cradle," haven of homeless
infants in Evanston, Illinois, is being similarly equipped,
the equipment aiding in protecting the babies against
infection by air-borne germs.

OF THE THOUSANDS of
suits and dresses deliv-
ered by dry cleaners
every day, how many
are destined to play their
part in encouraging romance?
It's an interesting speculation.
When "boy meets girl" both are eager
to look their best.
Appearance has so much to do with
the success of that great adventure. And
so the dry cleaner, in delivering freshly
cleaned and pressed clothes at a specific
hour, is often hand in hand with Dan
Cupid.
But the "romance" of dry cleaning
goes much farther than that. Few people
realize the true nature and extent of the
remarkable service the dry cleaner is
rendering. Clothes are not merely
"sloshed" in some commonplace liquid,
wrung out, dried and pressed, like a
family wash.
The modern dry cleaner is a skilled
technician who understands the nature
and peculiarities of textiles and tex-
tures, of dyes, of prints, of wools,
silks, rayons, acetates and mixtures.
He knows his chemistry and what to
do with troublesome spots. He knows
the problems of shrinking and stretch-
ing and what to do about them. In
fact he practices a scientific operation.
In the advancement of this essential
business Dow technicians have played
a conspicuous part by the development
of Dowclene. This dry cleaning sol-
vent, in addition to speeding up the
process, makes dry cleaning abso-
lutely odorless. It leaves no oily film
to attract new dirt. It makes clothes
cleaner, fresher, brighter, wear longer.
Beyond these invaluable results is the
immensely important fact that Dowclene
is nonflammable and non-explosive.
The utilization of Dowclene solvent
is now national in scope and Dow con-
siders it among the most important of
all its more than three hundred contri-
butions to industry.

THE LOCKHEED
"ELECTRA" IN THE
WIND TUNNEL
Whenever any radical change in design or in the size of an airplane
is undertaken, it is essential that the effect of the changes on the
speed, stability, and control be studied. Research work in wind
tunnels has progressed to a point where studies carried forward
on models in modern wind tunnels result in accurate information
on the effects.
The University wind tunnel, which has a maximum throat open-
ing of eight feet and a maximum wind speed of 1 10 miles per
hour, has been used extensively for such studies. It represents
one of the many facilities available for the research service which
the University offers industry through:

N. L. WALLACE
Production Manager, Life Magazine
WHEN the publishing of Life was
first considered in the summer of
1936, the mechanical difficulties in
printing it appeared to be well nigh in-
surmountable. Previously, picture maga-
zines were published monthly because
a comparatively leisurely printing sched-
ule, with plenty of drying time, was re-
quired. With a weekly pictorial maga-
zine, conditions were different. It had to
be printed, dried, and folded at what
approaches newspaper speed, and it had
to be on coated paper. Fortunately,
however, a revolution was impending in
three closely allied fields, the paper, the
ink, and the printing industries, which
would shortly make such a schedule pos-
sible.
Up to the fall of 1936, very little
coated paper was sold in rolls, but was
delivered in sheets and printed in sheets.
Printers thought that it had to be in-
spected sheet by sheet for imperfections
in the finish. It was prophesied that the
paper would stick together if tightly
rolled, and all sorts of difficulties were
imagined.
Two mills, however, tried to produce
roll-coated, and not only did they suc-
ceed in that, but they simultaneously
developed a process of coating the paper
on the paper machine while the sheet
was still being made. This eliminated the
necessity for putting on the coating by
a separate process, as had been done up
to that time, and was much more eco-
nomical because of the higher produc-
tion speed and the reduction of waste.
Today the digested pulp—the "fur-
nish" of the paper—is fed into the
beaters at one end of a paper machine,
to emerge at the other end in 60 inch
rolls—dry and shiny with coating,
ready to ship. And the paper is made at
the rate of more than 600 feet per min-
ute.
Next came the ink—and perhaps that
is the most important item of all, for
without the new type of heat-set inks
there could have been no high speed
printing, no matter how much coated
paper was available. These inks had
been developed for nearly a year, but
no one had successfully employed them
as a means of printing on coated paper
at high speed—and of folding that paper
on the presses with no appreciable dry-
ing interval.
All of the black and white presses
are equipped with heating apparatus
for the instantaneous drying of the new
heat-set inks. The heaters burn gas
which heats a series of vitreous cups,
so that no flame comes in contact with
the paper, and the flow of the gas is
regulated automatically to vary with the
speed of the press. Enclosed in metal
boxes on each side of the web are the
two heater units. The paper enters the
box through a slit on one side and
emerges from a slit at the other side.
When the press is running up to speed,
the temperature attained is approxi-
mately 1400°F.
As the paper, known as the "web,'"
passes over the heating unit, the vola-
tile vehicle of the ink oxidizes so rap-
idly that it actually bursts into flames.
Upon looking into the heat chamber the
paper appears to be covered with a
thousand dancing blue flames. When it
emerges from the heating unit, the web
passes over the cold-roll, which is a
water cooled cylinder. Contact with the
cold sets the ink and completes the dry-
ing.
Many are the complications surround-
ing the use of these heat-set inks. The
heat required is, of course, a compli-
cation in itself, but there is also the
problem of exhausting the gases and
fumes which result from the oxidation
of the ink. If not exhausted rapidly,
they condense, fall back on the web, and
leave it spotted. The exhaust draws out
a lot of the heat, which means using
more gas to maintain the heat level.
That is now being overcome by clean-
ing and feeding back the heated air
which is sucked out by the exhaust.
Another interesting, but very annoy-
ing discovery having to do with heat
was that the paper web was subject to
shrinkage. The sheet actually shrinks
a full quarter of an inch when it is so
suddenly dried, later to be stretched
back to its original width by the cold-
rolls. This rapid change does not help
things any, and sometimes the sheet is
left slack. This accounts for the occa-
sional wrinkle you may see across a
page.
In the beginning, fires were common.
The press would stop suddenly, the
heat would be a bit slow in slacking off,
and the result was really something.
That has been licked by the substitu-
tion of the vitreous cups for the open
gas bar.
For a time, too, blistering caused con-
siderable trouble. This had to do with
the amount of moisture in the paper
when it was received from the mill. The
ink would be laid on the paper, it would
go through the heater, get more ink on
the other side, and go back through the
heat again. Thus if the sheet were too
moist, vagrant beads of water would be
sealed into the sheet—sealed in by ink
on both sides. The moisture would be
converted into steam, which, having no
outlet, would explode—leaving a sort
of pricked bubble effect, usually right in
some advertiser's very best blonde copy.
But this difficulty, like all the others
that confronted high speed printing on
coated paper, was eventually solved. In
this case it was done by very carefully
limiting the stock as to moisture content.

TEACHERS of engineering are not

say that an accurate canvass of engi-
neers now engaged in teaching techni-

cal subjects would reveal that startlingly
few of these men, when they were under-
graduates, had any intention of teach-
ing.
The profession does not appeal to the
undergraduate engineer as an attractive
one to follow. The reasons for this are
not obscure. First of all, the practice of
engineering, which attracted the boy
originally, and the teaching of engineer-
ing are widely different. A difference in
duties and in associates is involved. In
the practice of engineering one deals
with fabrication of materials and in
teaching one deals with the fabrication
of minds. It is not reasonable to expect
that a boy attracted by one profession
would have even a minor interest in the
other. Too, the boy is approaching the
end of what must have seemed to him
a long and arduous battle with eighty
or more teachers that have pestered him
singly and in groups for fifteen years.
He knows more about teachers than he
does about the members of any other
profession. He knows that a few are
stupid and that many know more about
education than about the subjects they
teach. He knows that a very few have
"something on the ball," but he knows
too that these same men make less
money than the hometown undertaker
does during a fair year. Then, since the
philosophy of the boy of twenty is a
strange mixture or realism, ignorance,
and ambition, he decides, if, indeed, the
thought has ever occurred to him, that
he does not want to be a teacher. A
thoroughly normal decision.
In April or May of the senior year
it will occur to a dozen or more of the
class that an advanced degree would be
desirable. A good proportion of these
will have made a conscious decision
against teaching as a profession.
Of the whole group some are advised
by the chairman of the department that,
in all likelihood, the graduate school
would make them very unhappy. The
proportion so advised will depend largely
on the progress being made in the battle
between the chairman's honesty and the
chairman's desire for graduate students
in his department. In any event, a few
do return for graduate work. The impor-
tant thing, however, is that a sort of
natural selection has taken place. The
stupid and the lazy have been elimi-
nated almost automatically. The sound
average student has gone to work on his
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


gone into the bond business, and the
""all As" have been worked off on an-
other school as research assistants.
Those that remain, whether they like it
or not, are the stuff from which teachers
of engineering are made. They have, by
their election of graduate study, indi-
cated that work does not alarm them
unduly and that study and research hold
some attraction. Too, they have, in a
sense, been examined for personality
defects that would make them unfit for
intimate association with the faculty or
with their fellows.
Here, then, is a handful of young
men. They are not the best of the late
senior class from any single view point.
They are not the most industrious, nor
the most able, nor do they have out-
standing personal characteristics. They
are simply somewhat above the average
in all of these. One of these boys in
whom ability, industry, and personality
are blended in a particular yet inde-
scribable proportion may, at the comple-
tion of his graduate study, be teacher
material. And if this be true, the faculty
associated with him is aware of it.
If a need for an instructor in this
young man's specialty develops at an
engineering college that favors men from
his school, there is little doubt that the
chairman of the department will hear
of it. There is equally little doubt that
the young man will be told of the in-
quiry and encouraged to apply for the
job. The boy will still be hesitant about
making teaching his profession, but if
he is like most of us he will make appli-
cation with the private thought that,
after all, he is not making a lifelong
commitment. If he is fortunate enough
to be selected, from the dozen or more
applicants for the job, as the one to
whom a contract shall be offered, he
will be subjected to a short and wholly
informal examination (interview, really)
by the man for whom he is to work, his
new department chairman. He may be
somewhat astonished to discover that
his prospective superior does not appear
to be greatly concerned with what he
knows, but is deeply concerned with
what his current interest may be. He
should not let this astonishment be ap-
parent, because, of course, he cannot
be expected to know very much; his
interest in learning more is the impor-
tant thing.

other and similar one with the Dean of
the Engineering College will follow, and
if that in turn is successful, a contract
will be offered. The contract may call
for anything from fifteen hundred to
two thousand dollars per school year de-
pending on the type of college and its
geographical location. In exchange for
this sum of money the young man will
be expected to teach a maximum of fif-
teen credit hours per week and to be-
have himself. (Most department chair-
men, if not too severely pressed, will re-
duce the teaching load of the beginning
teacher to eight or ten hours to assist
him in his orientation.) He will prob-
ably be told that he is not to bolt classes
without good reason, and he may be
told of certain rules peculiar to the
faculty to which he has been admitted.

sense of the term, his apparent working
day is from two to three hours on the
average, and it begins to look as if it
were all too good to be true. It is. That
eight or ten hours of teaching is only
about a quarter of the work really ex-
pected of him, in spite of what the con-
tract may have said. There is equip-
ment to be designed and made, there is
research to be undertaken, there are
papers to write, there are, in fact, about
nine to the four point six one power
things to do and they add up to a work-
ing week of sixty hours—more if pos-
sible.
That is exactly why he will remain a
teacher. There are few professions that
can keep a man so busy and so fasci-
nated. Even the job outside to which
the young man will "escape" after two
or three years of teaching will not be
able to hold him. He will be back and
a better teacher for the experience.
One day, if he behaves himself, he
will be made dean of his engineering
college and he will still have reason to
be envious, transiently, of the hometown
undertaker.

FLYING PLANES FROM AN ARMCHAIR

LEO A. WEISS, '39E
ALTHOUGH the building and flying
■ of model aircraft gains but little
publicity, most people today are familiar
with the very spectacular sport and
hobby of gasoline powered models. The
models, ranging from two to fifteen or
sixteen feet in wing spread, powered
largely by single cylinder, two cycle en-
gines, with power ratings ranging from
practically zero to one horsepower, are
being built in very large quantities by
boys and young men throughout the
country.
The sight of one of these models fly-
ing overhead completely under its own
power and control is enough reward for
the money and time invested. Those
who have built such models will insist
that as fun-producers, they cannot be
beaten.
Recently, however, small groups of
men who were interested in gasoline
powered models have attempted to ex-
ercise some control over their miniature
aircraft while in flight. This immedi-
ately calls for some means of remote
control apparatus to move the elevators,
rudder, and ailerons, but since wires
cannot possibly be attached to the mod-
els, the use of radio as a connecting link
between the model and the ground is
brought to mind.
It seems now that there can be very im-
portant usage made of radio controlled
model airplanes. Large models (of say,
14 foot wing spread) powered with as
high as one and a half horsepower en-
gines can be used in studying tactical
maneuvers of full-scale aircraft for the
Army and Navy, and more important,
can be used for much needed anti-
aircraft gunnery practice. Models of the
size just mentioned can attain top
speeds of more than sixty miles per
hour. By flying at proper altitudes and
speeds, the models can easily simulate
real aircraft. Model aircraft can also
be used as a proving ground for radio
control apparatus intended to be used
on full-scale airplanes. Little has been
publicized about the United States' in-
vestigation into full-scale radio control,
although other countries, notably Eng-
land, have had success in this field. It
seems that ultimately radio controlled
aircraft will degenerate into a form of
aerial torpedo, designed for very long
range bombing.
During the Great War, an attempt
was made in the United States to perfect
an aerial torpedo, and as a matter of
fact, quite a sizeable fleet of them were
constructed. They were never used, how-
ever, for the control system, which was
not worked out on radio principles,
failed to function with any consistency.
It seems probable, therefore, that the
next few years will see increased activ-
ity throughout the country with radio
control devices. It seems fairly safe to
say, however, that in this country there
are extremely few radio control devices
which have been successfully applied to
model aircraft.
Nearly all the apparatus which has
been constructed for radio control of
models has been worked out on the far-
famed "dial selector" principle. Put into
simple language, this type of control
system works as follows: the radio on
the ground and the one in the plane are
constantly tuned to one another, usu-
ally at some high frequency (in the re-
gion of 56 mc. or five meters), and
superimposed (or modulated) on this
radio wave is an audio frequency of al-
most any frequency. The audio tube of
the receiving set in the plane reacts to
the reception of this audio signal by
causing the current flowing through
the plate circuit to drop a very small
amount (possibly one "mil" or 0.001
ampere). This drop, although quite
small, is enough to actuate a very sensi-
tive relay, which in turn actuates a
larger relay. This larger relay causes an
electromagnet with a movable core
(solenoid) to rotate a dial, very similar
to a telephone dial, just one notch. This
motion is regulated by a ratchet wheel.
In order to move the dial in the model
over another notch, the audio signal
emanating from some oscillator on the
ground must be stopped, and then
started. Or conversely, every time one
wishes the dial in the model to rotate
one notch, one needs only to press a
button, causing the audio signal to be
modulated upon the radio carrier wave,
and go through the process outlined
before.
8
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


in the model is easily realized. For each
notch on the ratchet wheel, there is a
corresponding metal contact on the dial,
which makes contact with one non-
rotating contact. Moreover, each contact
is attached to solenoids arranged to
move the different control surfaces of
the model. As each control is actuated
by the corresponding position of the
contacts on the dial, the airplane will
respond to the movement.
It is immediately seen that a very
definite sequence of control will have to
be followed. In other words, suppose
the elevators are in neutral, while either
the ailerons or rudder are in a position
for a bank to the right. Then, in order
to move the elevators up, the control
must be tapped a certain number of
times in order to rotate the dial selector
to the proper position. This means that
certain other controls will be moved
momentarily while going from right rud-
der to up elevator, or any other two con-
trols. Moreover, no two controls can be
used together, eliminating the possibility
of climbing turns. Worse yet is the fact
that no engine control is possible, since
any contact providing for ignition cut-
off would soon be encountered in the
dial's rotation.
Hence it is apparent that the scheme
of control based on the dial selector prin-
ciple is cumbersome, inaccurate, com-
plicated, heavy, and in general, a very
unsatisfactory solution to the problem.
The remarkable thing is that there is
still more experimentation with this type
of apparatus than with any other.
About two years ago, this writer, in
collaboration with some students in the
Electrical Engineering Department, en-
deavored to find some more satisfactory
solution. The method we evolved showed
very great promise (three separate sys-
tems were built, all moderately unsuc-
cessful) but lack of time and finance
forced postponement of our work to the
future. The students who helped so
much with the design and building of
the radio and model were: John S. Lo-
pus, a radio amateur (W8LUZ), Mal-
colm Hormats, also a radio amateur
(W2FQE), Charles Piecewicz,and Jerry
VViesner.
This method of radio control works
on the well-known physical phenomenon
of sympathetic vibration. As before, the
radio transmitter on the ground and the
receiver in the model are constantly
tuned to one another. That is the only
similarity between the two systems.
In our control systems, not one audio
frequency, but as many as there were
controls, were superimposed upon the
carrier wave. Thus, there would be one
audio frequency for each of these con-
trols: up elevator, down elevator, right
rudder, left rudder, right aileron, left
aileron, and an ignition switch, or seven
audio frequencies in all. We found that
audio frequencies near 200 cycles per
second worked well. In the model, in-
stead of relying upon the tricky sensi-
tive relay, there was a unit called a
"resonant reed circuit selector." This
unit had seven steel reeds mounted
across the gap of a specially designed
electromagnet, arranged so that varia-
tions in the field strength of the mag-
net caused the reeds to vibrate. The
lengths of these reeds were so deter-
mined that each one had the same fre-
quency in natural cantilever vibration
as one of the audio frequencies used to
modulate the carrier wave. Thus, by
modulating with one certain audio sig-
nal on the ground, we could cause one
particular reed in the plane to vibrate.
Vibration of this reed caused an inter-
mittent contact to be made, and working
through a relay, a small electric motor
was set into operation. The motor moti-
vated the controls through a set of irre-
versible (worm) gears. Also the motor
was reversible, so that one of the other
leeds caused it to rotate in an opposite
direction to give opposite control. Add-
ing up, we find that there were seven
reeds, seven corresponding relays, three
motors, and one ignition control work-
ing directly from one of the seven re-
lays.
Of course the system was a good deal
more complicated than has been de-
scribed here. Many paragraphs could b?
written upon each of the many intrkate
problems which had to be overcome,
such as modulating with seven audio fre-
quencies each accurate to less than a
quarter of a cycle (the reeds tune amaz-
ingly sharp), correct transmitter and
receiver design, the weight problem, cor-
rect design of the contacts on the vi-
brating reeds, construction of the seven
relays, hooking up the motors, gears,
and control surfaces, and last but most
important, digging up enough money to
put the whole thing across.
As was mentioned before, three com-
plete systems were constructed. None
worked successfully as a unit, but in all
cases, the "resonant reed circuit selec-
tor'" gave excellent results as far as
splitting off one frequency from another.
After speaking to many experts on
audio frequency work, notably Don Wil-
liamson of Physicists Research in Ann
Arbor, it is this author's opinion that
the radio control system roughly out-
lined here will form the basis around
which future radio control apparatus
will be built.

RICHARD M. ADAMS, '40E
JOHN K. MILLS, '40E
FRANK BALDWIN JEWETT, as an
acquaintance recently remarked, "is
perhaps the most bemedaled man in
America." A pleasant man with a cor-
dial manner, of medium build with thin-
ning grey hair, Dr. Jewett has two
faithful companions—his dark rimmed
glasses and his half-smoked, occasion-
ally-lit cigar.
Vice-President of the American Tele-
phone and Telegraph Company and
President of the famed Bell Telephone
Laboratories, Dr. Jewett this year re-
ceived the highest of American engineer-
ing honors, the John Fritz Gold Medal,
in previous years awarded to Edison,
Bell, Pupin, and Marconi, for "vision
and leadership in science, and for nota-
ble achievement in the furtherance of
industrial research and development in
communication." In the past he has re-
ceived the Edison, Franklin, and Fara-
day medals, and from the Emperor of
Japan, the Fourth Order of the Rising
Sun and the Third Order of the Sacred
Treasure.
In the fifty-nine years since his birth
in Pasadena, California, Dr. Jewett has
spent no small amount of his time with
engineering and engineering problems.
Receiving his A.B. from Throop Poly-
technic Institute (now California In-
stitute of Technology) in 1898, he went
on to the University of Chicago to earn
his Ph.D. in 1902. He was a research
assistant to Professor A. A. Michelson
while studying at Chicago, and then
became an instructor in Physics and
Electrical Engineering at M.I.T. for
two years. In 1904 he joined the Ameri-
can Telephone and Telegraph in its En-
gineering Department in Boston. Shortly
thereafter he became Transmission and
Protection Engineer. He progressed
steadily in this company and in 1912
was transferred to the Western Electric
Company as Assistant Chief Engineer
in charge of Bell System research and
development work. In 1916 he became
Chief Engineer of the Western Electric-
Company and later Operating Vice-
President. In 1925, when the research
development work of the Bell System
had assumed such proportions that a
separate organization to handle it
was required, and Bell Telephone Lab-
oratories was organized, he became
President of the Laboratories and si-
multaneously returned to the American
Telephone and Telegraph Company as
Vice-President in charge of development
and research work. He has remained in
this capacity continuously.
During his career with the Bell Sys-
tem, Dr. Jewett was instrumental in
work on the introduction and develop-
ment of loading coils for telephone lines,
and in development work on vacuum
tubes for use in telephone repeaters.
He also played a large part in the con-
struction of long distance telephone
lines, including the first transcontinental
lines from New York to San Francisco.
While a student he became a member
of Tau Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, and Delta
Upsilon Fraternity. Since then, he has
received honorary degrees from nine
colleges and universities. He won the
United States Distinguished Service
Medal in 1919 for his war-time work as
a Lieutenant-Colonel in the U.S. Signal
Corps. He holds directorships in four
business organizations, honorary posi-
tions on eight institutions, is a member
of five clubs, and of four societies such
a* the Institute of Radio Engineers and
the American Institute of Electrical En-
gineers, of which he was national presi-
dent in 1923.
Dr. Jewett married in 190S. The
younger of his two sons went to Kiel,
Germany, in 1936 as a skipper on the
U.S. Olympic Sailing Team.
At his home in Short Hills, New Jer-
sey, Dr. Jewett spends his spare time
(though we fail to see how he finds any)
at his hobbies of gardening and working
in his small shop. Daily he takes the
Lackawanna to New York. It was in
his office on the twenty-sixth floor of
the A. T. and T. Building on the lower
tip of Manhattan that we first met Dr.
Jewett, who spent the best part of the
next hour explaining many questions of
interest to the engineering student.
"Not at all true," he replied when
we asked if he thought that large re-
search laboratories are driving out the
independent inventor. He went on to
explain that the chances are 10 to 1 that
fundamental inventions will come from
outside the big laboratory. This comes
about from two reasons: "The industrial
laboratories can't hope to collar all
the potential brains of the world. . . .
Large laboratories are chained to their
own businesses and are applied to com-
10

pany problems." The individual inven-
tor has more knowledge at his disposal
than formerly because all large research
laboratories publish their discoveries.
He also finds a wider market for his
ideas since these same' laboratories are
always searching for basic discoveries
to develop into practical form. Indeed,
the function of these laboratories is to
work out intricate problems requiring
group attack and corporate financing.
To quote Dr. Jewett: "Ten, fifteen,
twenty, or a hundred simultaneous prob-
lems exist in one main research prob-
lem. The large laboratory can split these
up and assign them to specialists."
An active member of the Society for
the Promotion of Engineering Educa-
tion, Dr. Jewett's views are reassur-
ing to those who believe in broadening
engineering education. As he sees it, in-
dustry no longer wants engineers that
are products of glorified trade schools.
"If you are going to spend your life in
the technical or managerial sciences,"
he advises, "spend as much time as you
can on the fundamental and basic stud-
ies instead of studying applications of
today which become obsolete tomorrow."
The young engineer is expected to spend
the first two or three years after gradu-
ation in getting acquainted with the de-
tails of his industry. As Dr. Jewett put
it, "No industry figures that new men
will be productive for at least two
years."
Continuing, he expressed the opinion
that engineering provides the best prep-
aration for a business administration
course. Its advantage over a literary
course is that it introduces the scientific
method, and in itself is a rigorous course
which disciplines the mind. Dr. Jewett
freely admits, however, that he has for-
gotten almost all the mathematics he
ever learned, but insists that it develops
valuable reasoning powers, and that a
proficiency in this subject denotes an
engineering turn of mind. In his opinion,
on the other hand, we should cut out
foreign languages since few engineers
need them, and instead, emphasize Eng-
lish. "A large part of an engineer's abil-
ity to succeed depends upon the ability
to express highly technical ideas to non-
technical people. The English language
is his vehicle."
Outside activities and hobbies, both
in college days and later on in life, are,
Dr. Jewett put it, "decidedly worth-
while." Kept within bounds, he thinks
that they can prevent a person from be-
coming the"narrow-gauge human being"
he might otherwise become.
Dr. Jewett believes that in the future
engineers will have to become interested
in social problems, but should not try
to take over the job of the sociologist.
In this light it is interesting to note how
Dr. Jewett himself bears out this policy.
While a firm believer in many of its
objectives, he has this to say of the New
Deal: "In an attempted short cut to a
millennium, they have lost sight of the
whole history of human development.
There have been less than seventy gen-
erations of people since the time of
Christ. In a biological laboratory it takes
hundreds of generations to produce
stable changes and improvements." Dr.
Jewett compares the process of social
improvement with the physical process
of demagnetizing iron or with the more
familiar example of bending a steel bar
to straighten it, going first in one direc-
tion, and then in the opposite, each time
coming nearer to the goal. He fears that
in the reaction which may follow the
New Deal, "the pendulum may swing
too far in the opposite direction," post-
poning needed reforms.
We would enjoy giving more of Dr.
Jewett's philosophy and enumerating
more of his honors. Space does not per-
mit. It is our earnest hope, however,
that this article has accomplished what
it set out to do—to acquaint you with
Frank Baldwin Jewett—a truly out-
standing engineer.

Professor of Mechanical Engineering
INSIGNIFICANT in size and simple
in appearance, piston rings probably
have received as much attention as any
other single part of an engine. The func-
tions of a ring are obvious. The piston,
the direct mechanical agent in the con-
version of heat to work, cannot in pres-
ent designs maintain adequate com-
pression seal and lubrication control
over the temperature range required of
a heat engine. Hence, some flexible
means of sealing the clearance space be-
tween the piston and the cylinder wall
must be provided. James Watt used a
patented "lubricator'' composed of
hemp and tallow in the pistons of his
early engines. Later, about a century
ago, Watt*s lubricators were improved
to metallic packings of lead, brass, and
copper. However, it was not until after

Plain compression, vented snap ring, and
spring backed oil ring.
the Civil War that cast iron snap rings
similar to those used today were gen-
erally put into use.
The first snap devices were made by
simply cutting a gap in a ring turned
larger than the bore of the cylinder in
which it was to be used. Rings produced
in this manner, however, were found to
wear excessively at the tips; and when
requirements became more severe, the
section of the ring nearest the tips was
reduced, i.e., the compressed ring was
bored eccentric. Operating experience
with this type showed two disadvant-
ages, namely, that the ring tended to
pound out of the piston groove due to
reduced land area near the gap, and
that, in internal combustion engines,
carbon formed in the ring groove behind
the thin section and hampered opera-
tion, frequently causing the ring to
stick.
Improvements in the methods of pro-
ducing concentric rings have eliminated
the eccentric type. Concentric rings
are now produced with a carefully pre-
determined shape; they possess a vary-
ing radius of curvature around the per-
iphery of the ring. This radius of
curvature, proportional to the bending
moment in the compressed ring, is
maximum 180 degrees from the gap.
For a ring of uniform radial pressure,
the radius decreases as a function of the
versine of the angle from the gap.
A uniform radial pressure pattern is
not, however, the most satisfactory for
all purposes. High speed internal com-
bustion engines require "plus cir-
cularity," that is, a slightly increased
unit wall pressure near the gap. Such
rings, when closed with a flexible band,
measure larger across the gap diameter
than any other and give an egg-shaped
radial pressure pattern. It has been
found that from .005" to .010" per inch
of diameter of plus circularity is neces-
sary to eliminate breakage from high
speed flutter.
In practice the shape may be pro-
duced by (1) slitting a circular blank,
spreading it tangentially, and heat
relieving the stresses; (2) hammering
the internal face of the ring with a pre-
determined spacing or intensity of blow:
(3) casting individual rings to the re-
quired shape. The latter method is used
to produce a large majority of American
rings, particularly for automotive use.
Introduced about 25 years ago, the in-
dividual casting method requires ex-
ceptionally careful foundry practice.
The castings for automotive rings,
made in green sand molds, may be less
than 3 inches in diameter and 0.100 and
G.160 inches in section. To reduce the
possibility of chill spots and misruns.
the patterns are equipped with "but-
tons" which produce additional flow of
iron into the mold. Of course, it is neces-
sary to maintain close control over the

and physical tests, as well as chill block
fracture inspection. In addition, the
clay, moisture, and grain size of the
sand must be held to very close
tolerances. Even the air blast to the
cupola is conditioned for temperature
and humidity to eliminate the effect of
these day-to-day variables. Equal care
must be exercised in machining the
rings. Ring and groove clearance, of
primary importance in oil control, re-
quires that the rings be held not only
to close (.0005") tolerance, but that
they be machined absolutely flat. When
it is considered that a ring of cast iron
may be finished 0.090" x 0.040", the im-
portance of correct shop practice in
grinding speeds, wheels, and methods
becomes of major importance.
The gap, formerly elaborately and
expensively sealed, is now cut straight
on automotive rings, without angle or
lap. Leakage past the gap on high speed
engines is negligible regardless of the
gap design if clearance, just safely suf-
ficient for linear thermal expansion, is
maintained. Only on the larger, slow
speed engines is it of any appreciable
advantage to seal the gap.
The face of the ring is, in American
practice, left with a fine-turned finish
to allow quick seating. Oil rings are
usually channeled, slotted, and care-
fully deburred before the finish turn op-
eration.
There has been a marked tendency
to reduce ring width for high speed en-
gine use. A large number of automobile
engines now use compression rings only
3/32" wide, whereas, only a few years
ago rings were commonly twice this
width. The reason is, of course, better
ring performance, for a given unit wall
pressure, particularly at high speeds.
Modern automobile compression rings
are expected to allow less than one cubic
foot per minute of "blowby" up to 4000
RPM.
Unit wall pressures now exceed thirty
pounds per square inch, and with such
pressures, the run-in or break-in period
for the ring even with very smoothly
honed bores must be done carefully if
scuffing is to be avoided. Scuffing seems
to be caused by a breakdown in ring
lubrication before the rings are seated,
causing minute particles of metal to be
torn from the ring and cylinder wall.
Actually a minor score, scuffing results
in a material shortening of ring life. In
fact, the rings may be worn so badly
as to require replacement before they
would normally be well seated. The ob-
vious preventative, careful run-in, is not
easy to carry out with new engines in
the hands of the public; the cost of a
complete factory run-in would be pro-
hibitive. Eaced with this problem, ring
manufacturers have developed several
coating processes. Plating with nickel
or tin is used by some: others use an
adaptation of the Bower-Baiff process
of converting a thin layer of the surface
iron of the ring into a hard iron oxide.
This oxide layer breaks off into very fine
particles as the rings are run in, polish-
ing the cylinder and the ring simultane-
ously. Still another major manufacturer
converts the surface iron into iron and
manganese phosphate. The layer is
softer than iron but it improves the oil
absorption characteristics of the surface,
providing, in effect, a lubricant between
the moving and stationary parts during
run-in. All of these coatings wear off in
proportion to the run-in and lengthen
ring life only insofar as scuffing is pre-
vented.
Oil control rings are made similar to

Our favorite math Prof is Dr. Rouse.
He always seems to take the welfare of
his students so seriously while he strives
to pound a little calculus into their
thick skulls.
We can remember one morning dur-
ing our first semester here at the Uni-
versity very distinctly. We were dozing
quietly through the Doctor's eight
o'clock Math 3 class when a dog wan-
dered into the classroom. Now of
course there is nothing unusual about a
dog wandering into a classroom—it
happens every day. But this particular
canine seemed to exhibit a little more
intelligence than
most of his breth-
ren.
He ambled non-
chalantly up to Dr.
Rouse and, sitting
down at the profes-
sor's feet, gazed in-
tently at the black-
board, cocking his
head from side to
side in that appeal-
ing way peculiar to dogs.
Dr. Rouse paused and glanced down
at the dog for a moment. Now we may-
be wrong, but we could have sworn that
he started to bend down to pat the ani-
mal on the head. However, he visibly
restrained himself and continued the
discussion with the dog as an interested
spectator.
But Dr. Rouse is absent minded.
One night last summer, when the mer-
cury was flirting with the nineties, we
met a very distracted Dr. Rouse in the
hall of the East Engineering Building.

He had been working late in his office
and had walked out leaving the keys
locked inside.
When we found him he was stand-
ing in front of the door eyeing the tran-
som wistfully. Rising to the occasion, we
volunteered our services and proceeded
to vault through the transom, the sill
of which had evidently not been washed
since the building was constructed.
Dr. Rouse was very grateful. Our
only regret is that we have already fin-
ished all our math courses.
gargoyle (cont.)
We were over at the President's tea
the other day. We are a little hazy as to
how we got there and as to just what
happened, except that Jane Nussbaum
kept urging more tea upon us.
Along about the fifth cup we hap-
pened to say something about the
Gargoyle and Jane, who is one of the
leading lights of their women's staff,
replied in a tone of the utmost disgust:
"Oh, that!"
We have always had our private
opinion of the Gargoyle, but have tried
not to air it too openly. It is both sur-
prising and heartening to find our
opinion shared by the members of the
staff themselves.
But we don't wish to indulge in per-
sonalities. In fact, we are willing to call
the whole feud off if "Barkis is willing."
We even have a suggestion for smooth-
ing the troubled waters. Why not
exchange some staff members for a
while? This should work for a better
understanding between the two mag-
azines.
j-hop
The annual Junior Brawl is over and
the student body seems to be suffering
severally from nostalgia, hangovers,
and an acute lack of cash. A lot of
amusing things happened, but we think
that we very nearly had a unique ex-
perience last Friday.
We very nearly took two girls to the
J-Hop.

One of our fraternity brethren had
a date with a girl in Detroit. Since he
had to work on classification Friday
we offered to bring his date out, inas-
much as the young lady who had
foolishly consented to go with us also
was in Detroit. Friday we were natur-
ally late. Could hardly help it when you
consider we had to wait for two girls
instead of one. So the three of us arrived
in Ann Arbor nearly an hour after we
were due.
As was expected Brother Bob was
frantic—but not about our late arrival.
He was all dolled up—white tie, tails,
and everything.
But the pants.
The bottoms were dangerously flirt-
ing with his knees. Somebody had
swiped Bob's and the only other pair
in the house were approximately six
inches too short.
It looked for a while as though we'd
have to go with both girls, but luckily a
pledge of correct dimensions walked in.
So we loaded the girls, the pledge-
and Bob (knee britches and all) into
the car and dashed over to the pledge's
rooming house, where Brother Bob
acquired a more appropriate nether
garment.
Ah—such a chance to miss. But we
did find out that Brother Bob was cap-
able of the prettiest blush.

IT'S 10 TO 1
... your vital problem right now is a better product at
a competitive cost; and improved materials may be
the answer. Better re-check your material specifica-
tions today for Molybdenum steels. They are continu-
ally replacing other long established steels.
Here's a concrete case. Several important manufac-
turers of steam generating eguipment have adopted
Carbon-Molybdenum steel for many different parts.
They find it has the better elevated temperature prop-
erties and creep strength necessary for the high tem-
peratures common to modern plants. They also find
that it is suitable for welded construction (many in-
stallations today are of welded construction).
What is more, Carbon-Molybdenum steel not only
meets the physical requirements exactly but also
comes within the cost limitations that usually exist.
We will gladly send our booklet, "Molybdenum in
Steel", containing a great deal of practical data, free
to technical students and others interested in improved
materials giving more per alloy dollar.

"SMILE. DARN YA, SMILE'
OX Wednesdays, while the Freshman
Assembly is convening, our nu-
merous freshmen file past me as I stand
at the door of Room 348. While passing
out the attendance slips, I am having
one of the most pleasant experiences of
the week. There are two reasons for
making this statement. One is, that a
great many freshmen nowadays say
"Thank you," when given as small an
item as an attendance slip; and the
other is, that so many of these freshmen
light up with a pleasant smile of greet-
ing as they approach the door.
These pleasant little occurrences al-
most get crowded out, of course, when
the peak load arrives—with perhaps a
hundred men filing into the room in a
space of five minutes or less; but even
then, under most hurried circumstances,
they still do show up.
We have never suggested that fresh-
men should say "Thank you" under
these circumstances. They just do it
anyway; and it is a most welcome trait.
The smile is equally welcome. A fresh-
man who will give me a smile while hast-
ily coming through that door will be
giving his associates and his instructors
a smile all the time he is here. Because
of that smile, and because of all the
other nice personal traits that come with
it, we are glad to have him around.
Later, when he passes from our little
campus sample of the world into the
world at large, he will find it to be a
surprisingly pleasant place in which
to do his work. Why? The reason is
entirely human and very simple: people
anywhere (including industrial and busi-
ness executives) welcome the young man
who has a ready smile, a sense of tact,
and a deep appreciation for the rights
and the feelings of others.
The number of this year's freshmen
who have earned the compliments paid
them in the above paragraphs is so
large that it has been my intention for
some months to make note of it in these
columns. It would be very nice indeed
if one could stop at this point, without
noting the exceptions. Unfortunately,
not only are there exceptions, but they
also stand out in unusual contrast.
I must admit that there are a few
freshmen who barge into the Assembly
room, with never a smile, and with faces
that seem to say that they are carrying
the cares of the whole campus on their
shoulders. Some few look downcast;
others constantly look embittered. One
is tempted to ask: If college is as sad
as all that, why continue with so gloomy
an experience? Of course, it would be
wrong to assume that a sad or sour
countenance always reflects a sad or
sour disposition. But the trouble is, peo-
ple in the world at large are too busy
with their own affairs to make very
many allowances; and they are much
too busy to find time to prove that
"Sourpuss" really is mellower than he
looks. If an employer has two equally
able graduates, one of whom gets along
well with people while the other does
not; and if bad times come on, which

Instructor A. D. Moore. 1917.
one finds himself at liberty? You do not
need to do any guessing on that one;
it's a certainty. One of the surveys made
of unemployed white-collar workers dur-
ing the depression showed that much
more than half of those "at liberty"
were released, not for technical incom-
petence, but because of personality de-
ficiencies.
The freshman who constantly wears
a sad, gloomy, embittered, or defiant ex-
pression has one big job to handle right
now, and it is more important than the
business of passing courses and getting
a degree. It is the matter of changing
the expression that is already isolating
him from his fellow men. He must learn
to smile. A smile does not need to grow
into a broad grin on every occasion.
Some of the best smiles are of the
"quiet" kind—largely taking place
around the eyes. But whether it is of
the faint ripple or the earthquake vari-
ety, we all recognize a smile and like to
see it. It means good will. Just as defi-
nitely, it is very often true that constant
lack of a smile really means lack of
good will. It is natural for everyone to
have as little as possible to do with a
man who does not manifest good will.
Suppose a freshman is so unfortunate
as to have a basically sour outlook on
life; what can we do about it? This
touches upon a very large subject; space
is too limited here to attempt any full
discussion. However, it is pertinent to
mention a bit of research recently re-
ported. The researcher found that a
person's emotional attitude tended to
be influenced by his conscious behavior.
Specifically, it was found that if one is
faced with a situation that might re-
sult (a) in anger, or (b) in laughing it
off as being unworthy of anger, then
the emotional attitude adopted would
often depend on whether one decided to
break into a frown or into a smile.
From this research, as well as from
the numerous experiences anyone may
take note of if he so wishes, it will be
found that the habit of smiling can be
cultivated; and that, better still, some
initially forced smiling can result, even-
tually, in bettering one's outlook on life.
On behalf of the whole college, per-
mit me to close this month's comments
by paying tribute to the freshman class
for having so very many men who are
showing, by their pleasing demeanor,
that they are finding life not too difficult
around here.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The Michigan Technic is sponsoring a contest to
secure pictures for the cover of the magazine. You
are familiar with the type of pictures that are suit-
able for the Technic's cover. Perhaps a view of
the Christmas Tree in front of the library, or of
trunks piled high in the Railroad Station might win
a prize. Or in the field of industrial pictures you
might win with one of the glass cooling tubes of a
radio station or a scene of the sea beating against
the intake channel of a bromine plant.
Don't be scared off by the rule about listing
camera, film, exposure, and lens. Photographic
contests are often won by an amateur with nothing
more than a box camera.
The prizes are awaiting you, Gentlemen, and you
have until Midnight, April 20, 1939, so let's start
the shutters clicking and may the best man win!

author
Our "functions" author for this month
uses Notre Dame as his home address.
Prof. Brown, whose article on teaching
appears on page six, is a member of
Michigan's 1928 engineering class. Al-
ready he holds the position of Head of
the Department of Aeronautical Engi-
neering at Notre Dame.
Previous to joining the Fighting
Irish, Prof. Brown worked with Ford,
the University of Michigan, the Army,
and the Navy. During his college years,
he worked for his board, dabbled with
the Daily, and taught at the College of
the City of Detroit. We felt that Prof.
Brown is in an excellent position to
write about engineers in the teaching
profession. His article confirms our sus-
picions.
grads relax
Isiak Walton claimed many.
Dtt Pont Magazine

We were thumbing through the re-
turns on our last alumni survey. Per-
haps you remember our article based on
its results in the October
issue. We noticed a section
that we hadn't delved into,
concerning the hobby life of
the Michigan grad.
It turned out that the ex-
Ann Arborite is rather ver-
satile in this respect. As
might be expected, amateur
photography led the field by
a considerable margin. Golf-
ing, reading, odd jobs about
the house and garden, and
hunting and fishing came
next in order. Others ranged
from bridge through all
sorts of athletics to flying,
wood-working, music, stamp
and coin collecting, and ama-
teur radio work.
Practically every division
of hobbying was represented,
but some grads even brought
in new varieties. We found
four or five alumni who
claimed to be devotees of
various types of ''moun-
taineering," while over
twenty admitted to using
the wife and kids as a hobby.
One of our more enterprising gradu-
ates said that he devoted most of his
spare time to the development of a prac-
tical detinning method while another
very hardy soul actually claimed to
study theoretical chemistry for the fun
of it. What a man.
The one that floored us though was
the man who boasted about hobbying in
taxation. We admire his detachment.
but not least
All hough we frankly thought we had
said just about everything we could
think of about Frank Baldwin Jewell
in our interview with him, we'll have to
admit that we weren't the first to say it.
Fortune beat us to the draw, and to
our dismay gave him a place in their
"Faces of the Month" in their Decem-
ber issue. Such of you as read Electrical
Engineering might also have noticed
several specific references to Dr. Jewett,
including an excerpt from Who's Who
that appeared on the pages of the De-
cember issue of that publication. How-
ever, while acknowledging this slight
error in the choice of our date of inter-
viewing him, may we point out with
pardonable pride that the write-up on
page ten contains many of Dr. Jewett's
interesting personal opinions on subjects
of today, which the previously named
publications did not present. We per-
sonally found him an extremely interest-
ing person, and have tried to relay our
impressions on to you.
let's dance
While most of us are still trying to
recover financially and otherwise from
the after effects of the J-Hop, a few-
hearty socialites are already making
plans for the Slide Rule Dance.
This will be the tenth year that this
annual tradition of the Engineering Col-
lege has been with us, and we hear that
big plans are in the offing for the cele-
bration of this event. The dance will be
the night of March 31, a Friday. You'd
better ask the girl friend now, while she
is still too weak to resist.
Members of the committee are: Wal-
ton A. Rodger, Chairman: John S. Eis-
ner, Richard G. Tarbell, Richard M.
Adams, J. Anderson Ashburn, M. Rob-
ert Herman, Robert F. May, George H.
Hanson, John Stevens, Harold T. Spo-
den, Wesley Warren, and Don Van

GLEANINGS FROM HERE AND THERE
night light
Both lighting and safety engineers
are agreed that the only way to reduce
the annual toll of night traffic deaths is
to line the nation's highways with light.
Darkness nullified the work of safety
campaigns in 1937 to send the total
traffic fatalities soaring to 39,500. The
death rate at night, per mile, is three
times as high as that for the daylight
hours. Since legislation and the prob-
lem of glare limits the power of auto-
mobile headlights, the highways them-
selves must be illuminated. The possi-
bilities of such a program are strikingly
shown in the accompanying illustration.
This photograph was made by the light
from the overhead lamps alone. These
lamps are of a new type which use 4000
lumen incandescent bulbs mounted in
aluminum reflectors, thereby eliminat-
ing glare, and causing a more uniform
degree of brightness on the road. Safety
measures are effective only as long as
motorists are able to see far enough in
front of them to react before the danger
presents itself. A more effective and
universal lighting of highways than is
now employed in most situations would
enable safety measures which have
proved of value in reducing daylight
accidents to be applied twenty-four
hours a day.
hollow cables
A long standing electrical engineering
problem has lately been solved by the
introduction of a new type of transmis-
sion cable. The dam projects of recent
years have necessitated the use of ex- paradox
ceptionally large lengths of cable. So
called corona loss or electrical discharge
which takes place along the entire
length of a high voltage transmission
line, causing power loss and disturbance
to radio communication, is offset by en-
larging the size of the cable. To avoid
excess weight which would result from
the use of solid cables of the required
diameter, and to reduce transmission
losses, an aerial conductor consisting
of hollow wires for the interior with
solid copper wires stranded around it,
has been developed. The hollow cop-
per strands are made from thin flat
strips rolled and shaped into circular
form. These strands are produced in
continuous lengths as required, ranging
between 5,000 and 12,000 feet, and are
then stranded in large stranding ma-
chines in the same conventional manner
employed with solid wires. The intro-
duction of this cable is a very important
step in the transmission of electricity,
making it possible to transmit exceed-
ingly high voltages at a greater efficiency.
packaged power
Packaged electric power distribution
has arrived. The Electric Journal re-
ports that a factory-assembled distribu-
tion sub-station was recently "un-
packed" and placed in operation during
a single day at Gadsden, Alabama. In-
cluding a 24-ton transformer, voltage
control devices, switches and lightning
protection, the unit can quickly be
moved to a new location by breaking
the electrical connections and hoisting it
aboard a truck.

Darkness
triples the
death rate
on our
highways.
Roads and Streets
"If what you want is sunlight, live
either at the North or South pole, not
at the Equator," is the advice of illumi-
nating engineers. A study recently com-
pleted revealed that the poles receive
sixty-five more hours of sunlight a year
than does the equator. The explanation
is that the earth's atmosphere refracts
the sun's rays, so that the sun is visible
even when it is below the horizon. At
the equator this increase amounts to
forty hours a year, compared to 105
hours at the poles.
Closer to home it was found that the
south side of a building in New York
City, or other places in like latitude,
annually receives four and one half
times as much sunlight as the north side.
The north side receives eight hundred
hours of direct sunlight each year: the
south, thirty six hundred hours. Effects

sideration in the study, however.
By knowing the compass direction
of a building together with its latitudi-
nal and longitudinal location, a formula
makes it possible to determine accu-
rately, within four minutes, the number
of hours the sun annually will shine on
;i building or enter a given window. The
results of the study should be of great
aid to architects and air-conditioninu
engineers in planning their designs.
speed nuts
In the assembly of sheet metal and
plastic products, a new and revolution-
ary development of the spring tension
type of fastening has come into its own.
This new fastening is based on the
principle of holding assembled parts of
any product together under firm spring
tension instead of under dead tight
pressure as has been common with
threaded nuts and lock washers. One of
these spring tension fastenings takes the
place of two parts formerly used, namely,
the lock washer and the conventional
threaded nut. By using this new fas-
tening, the weight due to fasteners may
be reduced from 50% to 80%, depend-
ing on the sizes and types used.

XK7

From the viewpoint of assembly en-
gineering, its outstanding advantage is
the elimination of loosening from vibra-
tion. This is especially noticeable when
the spring fastenings are used in the
assembly of automobile fenders, radia-
tor grilles, hoods, instrument panels, and
the like. Another interesting character-
istic of these spring tension fastenings
is their natural ability to strengthen and
intensify their hold on the assembled
parts as the resistance to that hold is
increased. As the resistance or strain
increases, the base of the "nut" tends
to move closer to the teeth, and in doing
this, forces the teeth more deeply be-
tween the threads of the bolt or screw.
Over two hundred and sixty different
shapes and sizes have been already put
in use on hundreds of products in prac-
tically all the leading industries. In
many cases they serve as a blind bolting
means. They may be used in many
places that are wholly inaccessible
to wrench or pliers, and may be applied
with remarkable ease and speed. When
considering these fastening devices as
applied to smooth metal rivets and plas-
tic studs that have no threads, we find
there is no lessening of the intensity of
the grip. Yet at the same time a still
greater advantage is presented in their
application as they are actually "zipped"
on over such studs without the use of
even a screwdriver.

Mayor
Fred
wes warren
Kalamazoo, Michigan, contributes a
little fuel for the personalities pyre this
month. This "little" spark of ambitious
joviality goes under the trade name
of Wesley Warren. Wes, however, did
not come to us directly from Kalama-
zoo Central High. He attended West-
ern State Teacher's College for two years
before he finally decided to reach out
for bigger and better things by enrolling
at Michigan. At Western State he was
active in Freshman football, and he con-
tinued his football work his first year
on our campus. It was during his second
year that Wes hit his stride. He joined
Theta Chi Fraternity, was elected to
the Engineering Council, was Chairman
of the Engineering Open House, and
became a Vulcan. This year Wes is
President of the Engineering Council,
and a member of the Judiciary Commit-
tee of that organization. In June, Wes
hopes to receive a B.S. degree in Me-
chanical Engineering, and then enter the
field of Sales Engineering.
Wes is intensely interested in all that
he attempts, and has managed to lose
himself rather completely in Engineer-
ing Council and Men's Council activi-
ties. After listening to Wes discuss the
present and future plans of his particu-
lar pet, the Engineering Council, one is
left with a dizzying conception of a
convincing talker and a top notch scheme
that just can't fail.
Wes' ready smile and completely
disarming ways have won him many
friends. His affability hides an ambitious
mind that has made Wes one of the
more powerful influences on campus.
Few men, of recent years at least, can
boast of having played a major part in
as many startling revampings of campus
policies and complete reversals of form
in things politic as can Wes.
It doesn't take much imagination to
conjure up pictures of Wes in Sales En-
gineering work, but we'll risk being su-
perfluous and wish Wes the best of
luck anyhow.
fred osberg
We would like to present Fred Os-
berg to those of you who haven't met
him. Most of you already know him,
but we want to reveal some things about
him that you probably haven't heard.
Fred came originally from Massachu-
setts, living first in Waltham and then
in Plymouth. However, when Fred was
at the tender age of 14, the Osbergs
moved to Rutherford, New Jersey. Here
Fred went to high school and partici-
pated in football, track, and hockey.
Being only a little fellow and weighing
150 pounds (hard as this may be to
imagine from his present build), Fred
didn't ever make his varsity letter. He
would have in hockey his senior year
but a warm spell ended the hockey sea-
son after the first game.
After finishing high school, Fred
spent two years working on a number of
different jobs. For a while he fished for
lobsters in the ocean off of Cape Cod.
He worked in the cranberry bogs of
Massachusetts picking berries and help-
ing lay a narrow gauge railroad used
in the bogs. He also worked for a time
on a breakwater on the Xorth side of
Cape Cod. After going from one job to
another for over a year, Fred decided
that he wasn't getting any place. He
wanted to go college and study Naval
Architecture and afterwards get into
shipbuilding. He finally decided to write
to several large shipbuilding companies
and tell them what his ambition was and
see if they could give him a chance to
work with them and help put himself
through. One of the companies did give
him a job, and he worked there until
the fall of 1935 when he came to Michi-
gan.
Since coming to Michigan, Fred has
made a fine record in all ways. Scholas-
tically, he has done very fine work as
witnessed by his membership in Tau
Beta Pi and Phi Eta Sigma. Fred has
always been active in campus politics.
He was President of his Sophomore

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the Senior Class, a five year job. Fred
was caucus chairman of the indepen-
dent party until this year when the party
system went out. On some sunny after-
noon this spring, if you are down near
Kerry Field, you might see him throwing
the javelin; for that is another of his
accomplishments. In his spare time Fred
likes to sail, and indulges in his hobby
on Whitmore Lake. Honor societies have
also come Fred's way. He is a member
of Vulcans, Triangles, and Quarterdeck.
When he graduates this June, Fred
would like to go into Xaval Architecture,
and we feel sure that with his ambition
he will go far.
professor sadler
Walter Clifford Sadler has crowded
a lot of variety into his forty-eight years
of living. He has found himself in posi-
tions varying from one in the middle of
a neck-deep, ice-cold mountain stream in
the dead of winter, to one at a desk in
the Law Research Library at theUniver-
sity of Michigan. His earliest situation,
however, was that of a young son of a
watch maker in Elgin, Illinois. In this
capacity, he attended Elgin High School,
taking the classical course, not because
he was especially interested in the
classics, but largely because it was the
only course available. As a matter of
fact, Walter Sadler had already decided
to become an engineer, which he did by
attending the University of Illinois,
graduating in 1913 with honors and a
Bachelor of Science Degree in Civil
Engineering.
Engineer Sadler immediately went to
work for the Great Northern Railway,
on location in the Cascade and Rocky
Mountains of the United States and
Canada. Starting out on snow sheds, he
progressed through the construction of
bridges, tunnels, and finally shipping
docks in the port of Seattle. One Octo-
ber before the war, Sadler received hur-
ried notice to select a group of men and
go to Glacier National Park, then a still
practically untouched wilderness, to
make a hydroelectric survey. During the
winter, the party was plagued with such
troubles as being snowed in, threatened
with mutiny by the Indian guide, and
making a fifty-five mile walking trip
back to the railroad. It was here, while
fording a river, that Professor Sadler
found himself in the above-mentioned
unfortunate predicament. However, Pro-
fessor Sadler still says the trip into the
park was the best, from the standpoint
of scenery, he has ever taken.
In 1917 Sadler went to France and
served as General Superintendent in
charge of construction for two years. He
still belongs to the American Legion and
Veterans of Foreign Wars, and in 1931
was appointed Major in the engineering
branch of the Officers Reserve Corps.
For six years after the war he was in
general engineering practice. One of his
most interesting jobs during this period
was that of government engineer in
charge of field work on liquidation of
railroad claims following Federal Con-
trol of the railroads. He also did con-
siderable work in structural design and
grade separation and served as adviser
to an eastern investment house on util-
ity holdings. In the meantime, he re-
ceived a degree of Master of Science in
Civil Engineering from Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, and got married
—to Harriet Pearl Jamieson, in Seattle.
They have three sons.

Walter C. Sadler now entered an en-
tirely new phase of his career. In 1925
he was appointed Assistant Professor of
Civil Engineering at Michigan, and in
1929 was made Associate Professor. He
appears to have a sympathetic under-
standing of student problems; he or-
ganized the Engineering Council and
Transportation Club and belongs to a
number of student organizations.
Student Sadler attended Law School
in his spare time, receiving a Bachelor

of Law Degree. The law instructors
were not aware that their student was
a colleague from another part of the
campus till he was nearly finished with
his course. He had also received an hon-
orary degree of Civil Engineer from
the University of Illinois. Professor Sad-
ler has made a good use of his training
and experience in law in the publication
of many papers and articles, most of
which are concerned with law and engi-
neering and their inter-relations. In
more strictly engineering fields, he has
done research work, largely in railway
terminals and modern track, and the
adaptation of light rail equipment to
mountain freight traffic. He is the in-
ventor of a "wearometer" for measuring
the wear of railroad rails under various
traffic conditions.
During the early 1930's W. C. Sadler
added another new field to his scope of
activity. He became interested in City
Government, and was elected to the
City Council of Ann Arbor for two
years. He subsequently served as Presi-

the compression type with the exception
that slots are cut or holes are drilled
radially through to the vents provided in
the piston. Channeling oil rings reduces
the effective face width and correspond-
ingly increases unit wall pressure to
roughly twice that of the compression
devices. Inasmuch as oil rings are more
or less flooded with oil, scuffing because
of the high pressure is not particularly
serious. There is one exception to this
generalization, however, since scuffed
particles from compression rings may be
carried down past the face of the oil
rings, and wear the oiling members.
Piston rings are generally replaced at
from 25,000 to 60,000 miles in a car,
depending on the type of service. Long
haul trucks may run as far as 80,000
miles on a set of rings because of care-
ful lubrication and infrequent cold
starts. The devices used for replace-
ment are sometimes expected to seal
bores which may be tapered and out-of-
round as much as 0.010". For this con-
dition a "dead" ring, spring backed, is
usually more effective than the snap
type. The "dead"' ring thus fits the form
of the cylinder more readily and seals
the moving gap more effectively.

NEW-TYPE STREAMLINER
ANEW-TYPE 125-mile-an-hour streamliner — the
5000 horsepower steam-electric train now being put
through its final tests by G-E engineers—soon will be
speeding on its first westward run over the Union Pacific's
historic "Overland Route."
Nearly two years have been spent by General Electric
and Union Pacific engineers in designing and building
the streamliner. The result is that the power plant of the
new train is capable of doing twice the work ot a conven-
tional steam locomotive for each pound of fuel used, and
ot making three times the mileage without stopping tor
tuel or water. Six large motors in each of the two cabs
drive the locomotive, the electricity being supplied by a
geared turbine-electric generating unit similar to those
used on many ships.
As the new 15-car streamliner speeds between Chicago
and the Pacific Coast, at times winding through passes
more than 7000 feet above sea level, it will be another
symbol of the constant search by General Electric's
transportation engineers for more efficient means ot
travel. This search is one in which the engineer with years

viewed from an angle at which the glare of light reflected

the rest remains clearly visible.

a smear of lip rouge that has "ruined"

To overcome these daily inadvertencies,
and to keep the family wardrobe looking
its best, well-dressed America spends
better than 5130,000,000 annually-
through thousands of dry cleaners.
Public commendation is due the dry
cleaner. His job is far more difficult than
is commonly understood. He must know,
the characteristics of wools, silks, rayons,
acetates and mixtures—their shrinking
and stretching tendencies—their finishes.
He must also have a sound understand-
ing of dyes and the chemistry of remov-
ing an infinite variety of spots and stains.
Vitally important in dry cleaning is the
solvent that loosens and removes dirt
and grime. Dow technicians developed
Dowclene*—a series of non-flammable,
non-explosive solvents that perform the
process of dry cleaning far better than
was heretofore possible. They leave no
oily film to attract new dirt. They leave
no dry cleaning odor. Clothes return
cleaner, fresher—a delight to wear.
Already thousands of dry cleaners are
using Dowclene, to the greater satisfac-

possible as yet to find a dry cleaner using
Dowclene in every town and neighbor-
hood, the use of these scientific solvents
is spreading rapidly. Soon this modern
service will be available nationally.
Thus, Dow is enabling the dry cleaner
to extend his art to still higher levels
and this development emphasizes, once
again, the value of modern chemistry

University of Michigan Set-Up for Deter-
mining the Sound-Deadening Properties of
Various Vibration Dampening Materials.
The material is sprayed, or cemented, on a 24-inch square
by U-inch thick plate especially ground and calibrated.
A blow sets up vibration in the plate which gives off sounds
to the air. These are picked up by the microphone. The
electrical voltage thus generated in the microphone is am-
plified about 2,000,000 times and is passed through an
oscillograph. In this the electrical vibrations move a light
beam so that its swing depends on the intensity of the
sound. The decrease in swing over a definite period of
time gives a measure of the dampening. The effect of
dampening materials on these standardized plates has been
correlated with their effect on automobile panels and
doors, so that the value of a material for deadening auto-
mobile bodies can be quickly determined in the laboratory.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


EVERY once in a while in the course
of putting out this magazine, a sit-
uation arises which demands that plans
for the make-up of a number of pages
be changed. Last month, because of the
failure of a cut to arrive on time, we
found it necessary to remake our cen-
terspread, and to do so required new
galley proofs from the press.
We made the unfortunate choice of
going over to the press during noon
hour, so few people were around. There
were, however, a number of young fel-
lows lounging about waiting for time to
resume work. We asked one of them
if he would procure the needed proofs
for us (a matter of two or three min-
utes' work), and were not a little
astounded to be flatly refused.
Said he, "It's only ten of one and we
don't have to work during lunch hour."
Granted, the fellow was well within
his rights. He didn't have to go out of
his way for a customer. He would have
been doing something for which he
would not have been paid. We really
should not have expected him to.
But his attitude was so thoroughly
un-American. It was the attitude of the
typical eight-hour-a-day man. Such a
person does just what he is paid for and
no more—and probably always will. Yet
we'll bet that he has visions of being
pressroom foreman in a short time, and
feels that eventually he ought to be
made president, or anyway vice-presi-
dent, of the company.
The men who have accomplished
things in this w:&gt;rld have not been
afraid to dig in and work, often closer
to sixteen hours a day. They are men
who have been willing to do a little more
than just whit is required.
So when we get those jobs in a few
months let's be careful to stick to the
eight-hour day—and we'll be assured of
never having to work long hours.

DESPITE the objections to twice
told tales, there is one story that
came out of the war which will bear
infinite repetition. It concerns a private
upon whose draft the ink was not yet
dry, and so to whom one uniform was
like another. Finding himself without a
match, he stopped a passerby and asked
for a light. Obligingly, the stranger held
a match and then strolled on.
A comrade turned to the private and
in an awed voice told him that he had
just bummed a light from General Per-
shing. Aghast at his own impudence
the private dashed after the com-
mander and stammered an apology.
"That's all right," replied the General,
"but don't ever try it on a lieutenant."
Probably that story has survived so
well because it is nearly always the
lieutenants, not the generals, who give
us trouble. On the campus here it is not
the professors with whom we clash as
much as it is their secretaries.
Some time ago we were conducting
some research in socialized medicine and
in the course of the work sent inquiries
to a large number of American Consuls.
One brief, unexplanatory reply, from
the Consul to a very small nation to the
south of us, began with the words, "I
have to reply to your letter. . . ." On
the other hand the Consul-General of
Great Britain, probably the busiest con-
sulate in the world, secured from the
head of the Medical Practitioners' Union
a statement which contained the desired
information.
Doubtless it is not correct to argue
cause and effect; to say that one man is
a Consul-General and the other a minor
Consul because of details such as this,
but it does seem logical to believe that
it is no small factor.
Last summer, when we were planning
this year's articles, among those to
whom we wrote were Boake Carter and
an obscure engineer working on flood
control in the Mississippi. Boake Carter
was unable to write the desired article,
but he asked another authority on the
subject, Commander Rosenthal, to do

so. Unfortunately, a sudden transfer to
sea duty made it impossible for Com-
mander Rosenthal to write the article as
he had planned. Mr. Carter was pro-
fusely sorry that he had to let us down
—we never heard from the young engi-
neer.
You have probably agreed with every-
thing which has been said up to this
point. Definitely, the world would be a
better place if the people were a little
more polite, more considerate, and pos-
sessed considerably fewer of the char-
acteristics of the lieutenant.
But have we ever stopped to think
whether or not we are acting like lieu-
tenants ourselves?
There are plenty of contacts that stu-
dents must make with people while they
are in college; they make the mistake,
however, of thinking that when the
sheepskin is passed out, the recipient
then becomes a walking Dale Carnegie.
Right now is the time for all of us to
try and develop a little thoughtfulness.
If there is friction in our contacts, don't
be too quick to blame the other party.
Perhaps we are the one who is acting
like a lieutenant.
It seems to be pretty good advice to
say that if you aspire to a position on
the general staff, learn your job and do
it—and above all, don't be a lieutenant!

Manager of New York Office
United Engineers and Constructors
EACH year nearly 5000 engineers are
graduated from our colleges and
universities and are ready to start their
careers in the business world. Out of
this number, according to past statistics,
only 2500 will be engaged in engineer-
ing work in ten years; the rest will be
occupied in all branches of industry,
and some few in other professions in-
cluding law and medicine. Our concern
is with the 50f/r&lt; who have continued to
adhere to their first choice of a profes-
sion. I have narrowed this field even
further and will attempt to describe
what an engineer who has selected the
construction business may expect to en-
counter in his professional life and what
position he may attain in this field and
in his community.
The first problem which confronts
most students upon graduation is where
to find employment, and, unfortunately,
during the past years one has not been
able to be very selective in this choice.
The building industry is dependent upon
capital expenditures and therefore fluc-
tuates with the general business cycle.
In good times, there are many projects
involving new construction of factories,
power plants, and commercial buildings.
In periods of depression most of the
construction work is small and confined
primarily to maintenance jobs.
There are two branches of the con-
struction industry in which he may
choose to specialize, heavy construction
and building construction. The heavy
construction industry embraces projects
such as railroads, bridges, hydro-
electric plants and dams, wharves and
docks, tunnels, subways, roads and
sewers, pipe lines, and transmission
lines. The building division of the con-
struction industry is divided into three
parts as follows: industrial, covering fac-
tories, warehouses, and other structures
where the design is primarily to provide
housing for manufactured products;
process construction, such as oil refin-
eries and distilleries, where selection and
arrangement of equipment is the most
important requirement; and monu-
mental construction, which embraces
office buildings, hotels, theatres, hospi-
tals, schools, and large residential proj-
ects, including, more recently, slum
clearance.
Under present conditions of special-
ization in the building trades, the con-
struction engineer will find that he will
be forced in his early training to become
identified with one of these groups. The
construction companies in business today
are more or less classified into the
various groups in which they have made
their reputations as specialists. They
overlap in many cases, and all are capa-
ble of doing creditable work in other
fields. All of these companies have con-
struction engineers who, through years
of experience on similar types of work,
are qualified to manage, direct, and plan
these projects with the utmost efficiency.
The reasons for the industry's being
broken up into these various subdivi-
sions are that the methods of conducting
the operations vary greatly and each
division has its own particular equip-
ment requirements, and that the training
of the personnel necessary to carry on
the work is highly specialized. As an
example, the engineer who designs or
the construction engineer who executes
marine work, such as wharves and docks,
must have a thorough knowledge of the
various types of floating and land equip-
ment necessary to carry on the work.
This equipment would consist of pile
drivers and derricks, both marine and
land, marine dredges which may be of
several different types, diving apparatus,
submarine saws, air compressors for
carrying on cofferdam and caisson work,
marine type concrete mixers, and tremie
units. His experience should enable him
to decide whether the equipment should
be steam, gas, diesel, or electric. He
should have a thorough knowledge of
tidal conditions and know how to pre-
pare for the many emergencies that
arise due to marine storms.
The designing or construction engi-
neer on a highway project must be
familiar with a different type of plant.
He must understand the transportation,
handling, and storage of explosives; the
use of plows, rooters, scrapers, elevating
graders, power shovels, drag lines, road
pavers, steam rollers, rock crushers, con-
crete mixers and batching plants, motor
trucks, and, in general, equipment that
must be flexible for carrying on a
stretched-out or ribbon type operation.
From the above it can be seen that the
cost of equipment for any of these divi-
sions of the industry may run into
hundreds of thousands of dollars and
that what is suitable for one operation
will not cover the requirements of
another.
My reasons for giving the above brief
outline of plant requirements are to
impress upon the young engineer that
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


equipment used and that he should
expect to familiarize himself with the
various kinds of equipment in order that
when the responsibility of the design or
execution of a project is his, he will be
able to give consideration to the most
suitable method of carrying on the work,
thereby insuring the most economic
design and efficient method of procedure.
It is also a great help not only to know
the proper equipment to select, but also
to have a fair knowledge of its operation
and maintenance. The young engineer
will do well to make a friend of the
master mechanic and maintenance man,
and he will find them invariably glad
to explain to him the working and rig-
ging of any of the equipment. It is also
advisable to acquaint himself with the
small tools required and used on the
job, and to acquire the knack of using
many of them.
The time spent in the field will enable
the young engineer to become familiar
with conditions that he may expect to
encounter at the site of the operation,
such as geological formations and con-
tours, and adjacent properties and con-
ditions that may affect the handling of
the work. He will begin to appreciate
the selection of a proper personnel
organization and the methods of han-
dling and transporting material and
equipment used in carrying on the work.
He will understand what builds up the
various costs of the work and how to
gauge production of both men and
equipment. He will be instrumental in
the planning of progress schedules and
monthly estimates for payment, and will
be brought in contact with the labor
that is carrying on the work. This is a
vital part of his training, as he must
learn the conditions under which the
men work. He must learn to understand
their problems in order to see their side
of the story when gauging production
and settling their disputes.
The entrance of iron and steel into
building construction brought the de-
signing engineer's work into great im-
portance. The specialization of the
building trades and the realization of
the necessity of the speed of construc-
tion brought the construction engineer
into great importance. Fundamentally,
the construction engineer's job is to
interpret and execute the plans and
direct men. The young engineer's first
job on any construction project will

embrace surveying, time keeping, store
keeping, and general clerical work. He
may be fortunate enough to have a title
such as "Clerk of the Works," but his
salary will be nominal regardless of his
title. I recall my first job and I give it
here, for it is a typical example and may
save someone from the disillusionment
that I suffered. After several weeks of
haunting offices, I secured a job on a
power plant being built in Florida. I
arrived in Miami with practically every
text book I used in college, including
Mansfield Merriman's tome, the Ameri-
can Civil Engineer's Handbook, and a
crusader's ardor to show my ability.
Even my clothes were correct, complete
with high boots and pipe. I was greeted
by the construction superintendent, who
was in overalls, shown a pile of rein-
forcing rods which had been unloaded
from two flat cars, and told to classify
them in accordance with the reinforcing
schedule. I did this night and day for
three weeks and for the rest of the job
I sorted other material. I realized later
that I had gained a complete knowledge
of the materials that went into the
construction of a power house, and that
should I ever have to design a rein-
forced concrete foundation, I would
know that every extra piece of rein-
forcing I put in the foundation would
mean an hour's work for someone in
the field.
In the beginning, the engineer will
learn the practical methods of executing
the work specified on the plans and will
begin to learn the difference between
good, poor, and complicated design.
Every engineer, regardless of what
branch he is going to follow in later
life, should have from one to three
years of field construction work.

about two miles long. It was necessary
to meet the War Department's regula-
tions and have the lowest wire one hun-
dred feet above mean high water. The
design called for carrying three circuits
on wood poles set in a pile cluster. The
four structures on each side of the river
channel were "H" frames with each side
of the "H" supported in a separate
cluster, and the poles carrying the wires
were 110 feet high. The engineers had
given the location of each of these poles
in feet and tenths of feet from the shore
base line. One can picture the possibility
of anchoring a pile driver in a river with
a tidal current and driving four piles so
as to support the pole exactly 4,110.6
feet from shore. There were other
equally impossible requirements which
were practically met in the field by the
construction engineer.
Perhaps one of the construction engi-
neer's greatest pleasures will be ap-
plying the technical knowledge he
has learned in college to the practical
execution of work in the field. If he has
been fortunate in getting a job with a
company which has a large volume of
work, his employment will be contin-
uous and varied and at the end of three
or four years he will really have earned
the title of Assistant Construction Engi-
neer. During this first period of employ-
ment he should be prepared to live near

the work and expect long hours and
association with all types of men. His
job is to learn everything he can about
the work and the men who perform the
work, for, if he is successful, he will
some day have the responsibility of the
entire project. He should pay particular
attention to details, as this is the only
way in which he can familiarize himself
with the many component parts of the
work. While trying to master detail may
appear tedious, once he has trained him-
self to observe and note detail, it will
no longer be boring. It will be of inval-
uable help to him when he has complete
responsibility for a project.
To understand this advice, one must
realize the reason the construction engi-
neer came into prominence. The advent
of the use of reinforced concrete and
structural steel in building, coupled with
the tremendous expansion of industry,
made it economical to build large fac-
tories and office buildings. The demand
for this space put a premium on speed
of construction. Buildings were started
before complete structural plans were
finished, and it was necessary to have
an engineer on the job. The engineer's
functions grew from being just an inter-
preter of the architect's plans and a
material inspector until he had charge
of planning the construction schedule,
the subletting of parts of the work, and
the cost control of the project. Today
every building construction project of
any magnitude has a construction engi-
neer in charge of the work. His func-
tions include: consultation with the ar-
chitect in the early stages of design,
helping to select materials and advising
as to costs, planning the construction
schedule and the integration of the
various building trades which are to
work on the project, and scheduling the
time of arrival of material. He is re-
sponsible for the completed work and is
the agent of the owner, architect, and
the builder.
There is nothing that an older person
likes so well as giving advice to
younger men, and his advice is usually
tempered with suggestions which he
never followed in his own experience.
My own conclusions are no exception,
but I have tried to be honest and picture
what a young engineer may expect and
what positions his early experience will
qualify him to enjoy later. The first five
years of an engineer's life are largely
spent in obtaining experience; his salary
is small but even so is larger than that
paid other professional men who are
starting their careers, such as law clerks
or medical internes. If he is wise, he will
remain a bachelor, for his home is under
his hat and he should be prepared to
go instantly where his company has
work. Two years ago one of the leading
construction companies had work under
way in seven states and four South
American countries. His hours will also
be long and irregular, and his primary
interest should be his work and not his
family responsibilities. He has one hard-
ship in his early work, and that is that
his employment is of a temporary
nature, for with the completion of each
project he is faced with getting another
job. This is partly the reason for the
higher salary he receives. After approx-
imately five years of experience, he
begins to get responsible work and is
adequately compensated for his early
training and knowledge. From now on
his ability to handle men will be of
increasing importance and if he finds he
is not a natural leader of men he had
best choose some other branch of engi-
neering. His success and advancement
will depend upon his managerial ability,
for he is the construction company"s
sole representative in the field. His
decisions and work will mean a profit
g.- a loss for his company. Upon him
depends the satisfaction of the client.
The importance of client relationship is
often forgotten in stress of solving daily
construction problems; nevertheless, it is
of paramount significance, as the future
success of any construction company-
depends upon the recommendations and
repeat work it receives from its clients.
The construction engineer will be away
from his home a good part of his time,
as he will have to direct and manage
the various jobs his company has under
way. His home should be in the same
vicinity as the main office of his com-
pany. His ultimate position with his
company will depend upon his record.
He may become a vice-president in
charge of the construction department,
in which case his duties will be chiefly
executive. He may be fortunate enough
to have his own company. Regardless
of his future attainment, he will have
had a varied and interesting life, for
no two of his assignments will have
been the same. He will have had the
pleasure of seeing in visible form the
fruits of his labor, and his association
will have been with men of accom-
plishment.

Out ofi the

J. G. ADASHKO
Reprinted irom The Bridqe of Eta Kappa Mu
THAT the railroads are in a bad
plight is well known, and the ICC
has been trying very hard to devise
ways and means by which their financial
difficulties could be alleviated. Hard as
they try, car loadings are falling off,
passenger traffic is diminishing, and col-
lege students take more and more to
hitch-hiking. In fact, even honeymooners
have stopped taking the midnight train
to Buffalo, now that it isn't necessary
to go to Canada for a drink.
Naturally, the trouble with the rail-
roads is that they are built after old-
fashioned designs that have more than
outlived their utility. And railroad elec-
trification, though a step in the right
direction, is also in a very sad state
of affairs. All the electrical engineers can
think of is to hitch a different loco-
motive to an old-fashioned train, string
a few overhead wires—and let it go at
that. They certainly are on the wrong
track!
A similar Two-Wrongs-to-Make-One-
Right idea is the Diesel Electric train,
in which oil is used to drive a Diesel
which runs a generator which feeds the
motor which turns the axles on which
there is another generator which feeds
the lights which—simplicity itself, isn't
it? And this, my friends, is hailed as
engineering progress.
Consider, my friends, the many evils
of curved and crossing railroads, and
the detrimental effect that they have on
transportation's chief requisite—speed.
Think of the curves, varying in radius
from several feet to half a mile, which
have to be graded, banked, maintained,
etc. Contemplate the vast sums ex-
pended in grade crossing elimination,
and all the accidents where such cross-
ings still exist. And above all, dwell
upon the unsurmountable obstacles that
railroading has to overcome in Kansas,
where a state law says that whenever
two trains come to a crossing, both are
supposed to stop, and neither is allowed
to start until the other has passed by.
Obviously, a truly modern railroad
should have neither curves nor cross-
ings, so that trains could be run at a
much higher speed, and at greater safety,
than before. Fortunately, the writer
happened to remember that most curves,
when plotted logarithmically, give
straight lines. Thus the problem is
greatly simplified. Why not build a log-
arithmic railway? With all the curves
and bends straightened, with no need to
calculate elevations, and without having
to slow up, nothing but friction and air
resistance could limit the train's ve-
locity!
This, however, is not the only reason
why this ultra-modern railroad should
be logarithmic. Speed, when taken as an
average, is the distance divided by the
time. On the ordinary slide rule, which
is also plotted logarithmically, the length
from 1 to 10 is equal to the length from
10 to 100, etc. The logarithmic road, of
course, will have the same properties.
The reader can easily see that the time
required to travel 100 miles will be only
twice the time necessary to go 10 miles.
For 1,000 miles this time is tripled,
etc. This astounding gain in speed is an
even greater advantage than that gained
by straightening of the road. Not wish-
ing to "hog" all the credit, the writer
will leave it to one of the readers to sug-
gest that the local tracks be plotted as
the log scale, and the express tracks be
plotted as the log-log scale.
The mathematically minded engineer
will immediately see that the beginning
of the road lies in infinity (since the
time is zero, and log 0 = infinity). For
the same reason, the other end of the
road is also at infinity. Making the best
of this situation, and with a watchful
eye for economy, the writer stumbled
upon a most ingenious plan for energiz-
ing his railroad. As both ends of the
road are at infinity, the parallel rails
naturally cross each other at the end
points, thus forming an ideal circuit for
a thermocouple, provided the two rails
are of different rnaterials. With a source
of heat at the zero side of the infinite
end of the track, and with a cold body
at the other side, a voltage will be in-
duced in the track.
The electric motor in the locomotive
is connected directly across the tracks,
and the problem of energy supply is
easily solved. In order to maintain con-
stant voltage, the cold body is kept at
—234.5° C. In the vicinity of the cold
body the resistance of the rails decreases,
thus compensating for the IR drop near
the source of heat. Inasmuch as voltage
is available at every point of the road,
it should be easy to devise an efficient
block signaling device and other safety
features.
The writer would like to continue on
the subject of real railroad electrifica-
tion, but regrets that he must stop now
and catch the next subway train to go
to work.

The Mill

by
HUGH H. ESTES. '40E
A FEW weeks ago I had the inter-
esting experience of going through
Carnegie-Illinois' latest gift to mass pro-
duction, the new Irvin works in Clair-
ton, Pennsylvania. For sheer size it is
unequalled by anything else in exist-
ence today. Covering six hundred and
fifty-three acres, the site of the "Mill on
the Hill" is an innovation in that it is
the first steel mill around Pittsburgh not
to be built on the river bank. More than
three hundred acres of deep ravines and
surrounding hills had to be leveled to
provide for the fifty-one acre floor of
the new plant. To do this, over four
million cubic yards of earth had to be

moved—more than required for all the
home foundations in Pittsburgh. This
single mill has a daily payroll of
$30,000 and a capacity of six hundred
thousand gross tons every year. These
facts give but a slight indication of the
actual size of the outlay, for only by
seeing it in its entirety can its hugeness
be realized.
The first room I entered was the mo-
tor room. In this one room there were
electric motors capable of producing
three hundred thousand horse-power.
On my left, three ten thousand horse-
power motor-generators were operating
without a single man in attendance; in
all there were but three men regularly
employed in the room.
From here I was taken through the
slab storage yard, where the steel slabs
from the Edgar Thomson Mill across
the river are stored. The steel is taken
from this room, sent through the heat-
ing furnaces and on to the eight-inch
continuous hot strip mill. Four 4-high
roughing stands and six 4-high finish-
ing stands with their edging rolls and
scale breakers, all contribute to the fin-
ishing of the final, long sheet. Each
succeeding set of rolls must rotate at a
faster rate than the preceding one to
maintain a tension on the strip at all
times. This brings up the nice problem
of motor control; a failure would cause
a "buckle" in the hot strip, and necessi-
tate a shutdown. The two hundred foot
10

at this speed the ends are cropped off
by a flying shear, and the long strip
wound up in a coil. If sheets are to be
made, the long strip is sheared to
lengths rather than coiled.
The coils are then taken to the pick-
ling room. Here I saw huge travelling
cranes pick up the coils and set them
down in front of the continuous pickling
mill. In passing the steel through the
pickler, the end of each coil of strip is
fastened ("stitched") to the preceding
coil. To permit continuous movement
of the strip while the stitches are being
made, slack loops of the strip are per-
mitted to accumulate in a "looper" pit.
The strip is then passed through a series
of four acid tanks to a cold rinse tank,
a hot rinse tank, and a dryer. Again
idling in a looper pit while the stitched
portion is cut out, the strip is recoiled
and discharged on a gravity-roll con-
veyor for delivery to the next depart-
ment. This pickling room was filled
with the pungent odor of acid, but it
was the only place in the entire building
that was the least bit unpleasant to the
nasal senses. The whole establishment
was very clean; even the steel itself was
spotless.
From the pickling mill, the coils are
taken through a mammoth annealing
and normalizing room, where countless
gas furnaces are lined up ready to re-
ceive them. Near these is a sheet temper
mill where the sheets from the hot strip
are further rolled and tempered. From
here I went into the cold reduction
room, where further stands for reducing
the coils to the desired thickness for
tin plate were situated.
The pickled coils for tin plate are
cold reduced either in a five-stand tan-
dem continuous mill or a reversing mill,
the five-stand mill carrying the bulk of
the load. The continuous mill is one of
the fastest and most powerful ever in-
stalled and is designed to deliver cold-
reduced strip at from 600 to 1650 feet a
minute. There is also a three-stand con-
tinuous mill for cold-reducing strip.
These mills will handle the new high-
tensile and stainless steels, as well as
open-hearth carbon steels.
From these cold reduction rolling
mills, the coils are cleaned in electrolytic
baths, annealed, and then sheared to
the required length. In each of the six
shearing lines, the sheets come off at the
rate of approximately three every two
seconds. These sheets, about two feet

Five-stand
tandem continu-
ous cold reducing mi
square, are piled in three-foot stacks. I
asked the operator how much the "lit-
tle" pile weighed, and he answered, "Oh,
around three tons!" An interesting side-
line to this room was the deep pit into
which the long strands of scrap from
the shears were being fed. At one side
was a small electric motor and two roll-
ers, one of which wound on the strands
until a certain size roll was reached, as
determined by the second roller, and
then the roll of strands was ejected into
the pit. The operation was entirely
automatic; no one seemed to be paying
the slightest bit of attention to it.
Now I entered one of the most inter-
esting parts of the plant, the tinplating
room. Dubbed the "Tin House," it con-
sists of fourteen separate plating units.
A magazine of steel sheets is set in the
machine, where an electro-magnet takes
one at a time and places it on an endless
belt. The belt takes the sheet through
a palm oil fluxing bath, and then
through a bath of molten tin, where it
acquires a layer of tin thirty-thous-
andths of an inch thick. It is then scrub-
bed with a bran solution and stacked.
I was told that no cheaper substitute for
either the palm oil or the bran had yet
been found, and that these had been
used in essentially the same way for
over two hundred years! On the floor
beside each unit were five or six small
ingots of tin waiting to be put in the
bath, each weighing one hundred
pounds. My informer astonished me
when he told me that one of the little
ingots was worth fifty dollars; no won-
der they use such a thin layer of tin.
Even with all this machinery and
modern methods of production, the ac-
tual sorting of the tin-plated sheets is
left to a group of girls. It is uncanny
how they can tell a bad piece merely by
the way the light is reflected from it.
The girls stand beside long benches
taking a sheet from one pile, turning it
over, and stacking it on another. They
work very rapidly, turning over the
sheet and looking for flaws in the coat-
ing of tin with one motion. The finished,
inspected stacks are then packaged and
stored in a warehouse pending shipment.
It seems difficult to believe that this
gigantic, sixty-million-dollar structure
was erected and set into efficient opera-
tion in a year and a half after the
ground breaking ceremonies took place.
When three years ago, after some mar-
ket research which was started in 1932,
the actual construction of the mill was
announced, the only plans that existed
were rough sketches. Yet a year later,
on May 22, 1937, ground was broken,
and in a year and a half the tremendous
undertaking was completed.

FROM his very first words, James
W. Parker impressed us with his
pleasant, friendly manner and his frank,
businesslike way of answering questions.
Obviously accustomed to doing things
in the most efficient way, he was pre-
pared with a brief statement of personal
history which answered many of our
questions immediately.
His present home is on Geddes Road,
near Ann Arbor, where he lives with his

"James W. Parker impressed us with
his pleasant, friendly manner."
wife and two children. He owns a farm
which is not very productive, agricul-
turally speaking, but which affords him
an opportunity to gratify his yen for
farming and gardening. As a matter of
fact, his favorite recreation (much to
the consternation of his family) is to go
dashing around over the terrain in one
or the other of his two tractors. This
sport is occasionally complicated by the
upsetting of the tractor, but Mr. Parker
still swears by it.
Mr. Parker received the degree of
Mechanical Engineer from Cornell Uni-
versity in 1908. He was elected to two
honorary societies: Sigma Xi and Tau
Beta Pi. After graduation he worked
with the electric utility company in
De Kalb, Illinois, and with the street
railway company in Vincennes, Indiana.
In 1910 he became boiler room engineer
with the Detroit Edison Company and
has been with that company ever since.
During the World War he was granted
leave of absence for one year to become
consulting engineer and head of the in-
spection division of the Nitrate Division
of the United States Army Ordnance
Department.
During the past twenty years, Mr.
Parker has supervised the engineering
projects of his company, including the
design and construction of its four
major power plants. Now, as Vice-
President and Chief Engineer, he also
has general responsibility for the opera-
tion of the electrical system, the gen-
erating plants, and the central heating
system.
In addition to his company responsi-
bilities, Mr. Parker has been quite active
in the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers since 1913, and was recently
elected Vice-President of that organiza-
tion. He is also President of the Engi-
neering Society of Detroit and a member
of the Michigan Engineering Society
and the Prismatic Club of Detroit.
Since 1929, he has been a trustee of
Cornell University.
Mr. Parker has some quite definite
ideas on what qualifications a man
should possess in order to fill an admin-
istrative position. For one thing, he says
a man who has been a specialist in a
particular field makes a better executive
than does one with a general engineer-
ing background. Even if his administra-
tive work lies outside of his field of
concentration, the specialist has the
advantage in that he has a better under-
standing and appreciation of the prob-
lems that are faced by his employees.
He is not always able to work out
these problems for himself, but he is
well acquainted with the methods and
approaches to be used in their solution.
As an illustration of his argument,
Mr. Parker cited the case of a man in
12
THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


possessed specialized training in steam
power, internal combustion engineering,
and central station work. This man, in
the course of time, exhibited adminstra-
tive ability and was placed in an execu-
tive capacity where he performed his
duties exceptionally well. Since his work
necessitated his absence a large part of
his time, it was found necessary to
choose an assistant to take charge while
he was away. This time a number of
men with general engineering back-
grounds were investigated and tried out.
None of them did well. The reason
advanced by Mr. Parker was that these
assistants were not able to cope with
the problems of their department as ably
as the first man chosen simply because
they did not possess the first-hand
understanding of these problems that a
specialized training and experience
would have given them.
Mr. Parker also pointed out that
there are a number of men who possess
administrative ability but who do not
have the patience to stay in subordinate
positions until their superiors are ready
to advance them. As an example, Mr.
Parker told the story of a university
graduate who went to a certain com-
pany with very high recommendations.
This man had displayed considerable
executive ability in his campus activi-
ties and had a good academic record.
Eventually he would have filled a man-
agerial position quite capably; the only
difficulty was that he wanted to step
into such a position immediately. After
he had been in one department just long
enough to learn how to do his job he
wanted to be transferred to some other
department. In this way, he ilitted from
job to job without contributing anything
of value to his company. It was finally
necessary to release him. It is essential
for a man to stick to his position for a
longer time than it takes just to learn
how to do the job. He must establish
roots upon which he may base further
growth and advancement.
Mr. Parker's expression of the busi-
nessman's viewpoint on the labor ques-
tion is the sanest we have yet heard.
He does not believe that the measures
taken by the federal administration in
dealing with this problem have been
very wise. Sweeping indictments of all
businesses have been made by the
administration on the basis of malad-
justments within a few industries. These
indictments are unjust because they do

not give credit to those employers who
have handled their labor problems fairly
and wisely. Naturally, this has been the
cause of a great deal of antagonism
between businessmen and the gov-
ernment.
It was pointed out by Mr. Parker
that there are also a number of abuses
within organized labor itself. At present
labor is suffering more from poor lead-
ership than from anything else. These
leaders are not only advocating steps
that are economically wrong, but they
are using violence and coercive methods
to achieve their ends. Such methods
have the effect of building up class
antagonism and destroying the feeling
of confidence that should exist between
employer and employee. This in turn
affects the cooperation that is essential
for efficient production. Mr. Parker says
that all the employers within his
acquaintance are in favor of the prin-
ciple of the union movement. On the
other hand, he concludes, while there is
a large amount of arbitrary power in
capitalism, the alternative should not
be the placing of an equal amount of
power in the hands of labor. As long as
this is the case, no amicable solution
of the labor problem can be achieved.
We were sorry when this interview
came to an end. It is always interesting
to meet men of prominence in the field
of engineering. It is even more pleasant
when these men are as friendly and
unpretentious as Mr. Parker. We live in
hope of many such encounters.

&amp;omment5
THE student in a large engineering
college sees so very many fellow
students that he easily absorbs the im-
pression that the country must be filling
up with engineers. The fact is, that
neither the student nor the graduate
will have any but the vaguest notion of
the engineer's place in the general popu-
lation, unless he has given the figures
some attention.
One estimate has given the number
of engineers as 170,000. The population
now stands at about 131,000,000.
Divide population by engineers, and we
get 770. On the average, an engineer
must account for the direct and indirect
engineering services required by 770
men, women, and children. It is easily
seen that the country is as yet hardly
filled up with engineers.
Or, to compare the engineer with
wage-earners in general, use the assump-
tion that about 40,000,000 people are
busy earning a living. Divide this num-
ber by the number of engineers, and we
find 235 average earners to every engi-
neer. Let us picture this ratio in terms
of the Michigan stadium. Among 80,000
average earners, there would be 340
engineers. Start with the empty stadium,
put in 340 engineers, and scatter them
all over: then bring in your 80,000
average wage earners and fill up the
stadium. It would now be difficult to
find the engineers, even if they all
simultaneously waved log-log slide rules.
Is the proportion of engineers in-
creasing? Look at the local figures. Engi-
neering enrollment for most of the
engineering schools became available in
a report in The Journal of Engineering
Education, January, 1939. The engi-
neering enrollment here rose from 1858
last school year to 2058 for this year.
The increase is 10.8%. But let us not
be too local about this. Ohio State Uni-
versity, another large and nearby state
institution, fell by 6.5%, from 2003 to
1870. When trying to arrive at general
trends, it is risky to view a'small terri-
tory. Go back to the same report to see
what it says for 122 institutions, on en-
gineering enrollment: 73,945 last year,
82,585 this year, an increase of 11.7%.
Well, then: if enrollment is increasing
at the rate of 11.7% each year—but
who said it is? When getting at general
trends, a comparison between just two
sucessive years can be very misleading
indeed. Perhaps, and very possibly, some
of this increase is due to lag; students
who would normally have graduated and
gone by this time, may now be just
able to return to school, the depression
having delayed them by a year or so.
Is college enrollment in general due
to increase for years to come? Not
unless we pass a few miracles. While
in terms of the Michigan stadium."

talking of the engineer in the general
population, let us also take a very
hasty look at the population itself. Our
population is undergoing a profoundly
significant redistribution. Fewer chil-
dren are being born. The number of
elementary school children has already
diminished. Stuart Chase puts the
number at 21,300,000 for 1930, and
20,000,000 for 1938. Rufus D. Smith,
writing in October, 1936, in The Journal
of the A. A. U. W., said that the peak
of births in the U.S. was reached in
1921. The peak 1921 crop of births
would mature, some 18 years later, for
college entrance in 1939. If other factors
were not at work, it might mean that
next fall's freshmen would be the largest
(U.S. wide) class that ever would enroll
in college. But other factors (according
to Smith) are at work, and the peak
for freshmen will occur in the early
Forties. Thereafter, unless strong new
factors enter, colleges will begin to
shrink.
When I have mentioned this to some
of my friends, they sometimes enter the
claim that a new factor will enter—that
there will be an increasing tendency to
go to college. I grant that the desire
may increase; but the actualities will
depend on financing. Unless more and
larger scholarships materialize (or the
equivalent is made available in some
way) enrollment will go down along
with decrease in number of youngsters
of college entrance age.
Young men entering engineering (or
any other profession) should become
keenly aware of population trends. The
way to do this that is open to everyone
is to read everything that appears on
the subject. Stuart Chase writes on
"Population Going Down" in The At-
lantic Monthly, for February. Every en-
gineering student should read the article,
take notes on it, outline it, and eventu-
ally get its main implications into his
system. Then keep an eye out for other
writers who will be covering the same
subject. One will be certain to see a
number of things published, from
now on.
How will population trends affect the
engineer's place in society? Nobody
knows, beyond this: that it certainly
will affect it. Population trends will soon
affect automobiles, housing, real estate,
and manufacture for public consump-
tion, to mention but a few main items.
Any major effect on these will have
appreciable effects on engineering.

tion at sub-zero temperatures required a steel having
good impact properties at temperatures down to 150 de-
grees below zero F. Many different parts were involved.
Chrome-Molybdenum (SAE 4140) steel is standard
in this case because of its established ability to
meet strict low temperature impact specifications.
In addition this Chrome-Moly steel is keeping mate-
rial and production costs within competitive limits. It
is yielding the additional profit that always comes
from standardization. Substantial fabrication econo-
mies are also being obtained.
Our booklet, "Molybdenum in Steel", which con-
tains a great deal of practical data, will be gladly sent
free on request to technical students and others inter-
ested in improved materials.

efficacy
Notoriously no professor has any
sense of time and if not held in check
will continue to conduct his classes long
after the cows are safely home. Most
of them (the professors, not the cows)
are sorry about this and would like to
do better if they could.
An English Prof, of our acquaintance
thought that he had solved the problem
effectively. He appointed a student to
serve as timekeeper. Each afternoon
exactly at three o'clock this student
would say "time" in a loud, clear voice.
Oftentimes the signal would cut into the
middle of a sentence or word which
annoyed the Prof, a little, but he en-
dured it for the benefit of the students.

All went well until the last day of the
semester. On this day the semester
papers were due and they were stacked
on the desk at the beginning of the
hour. But the timekeeper was absent
this time, and the students were begin-
ning to wonder if the Prof, would stop
at the end of the hour.
Exactly as the clock struck three the
door opened, this student entered, put
his theme on the desk, said "Time!" in
the usual loud, clear voice, turned on
his heel, and walked out.
If you heard an explosion in East Hall
the last day of the first semester this
will probably account for it.
original
We reprint two jokes from the Feb-
ruary issue of the Gargoyle.
Page 16:
"'Mother, I advertised under an as-
sumed name that I would like to make
the acquaintance of a refined young
gentleman with an eye for romance.'
"'Marjorie! How awful! Did you get
any answers'
"'Only one, from father.'"
On page 47 of the same issue:
"'Mother,' said the young lady of the
house, 'I advertised under a different
name that I would like to make the
acquaintance of a refined gentleman
with an eye to romance.'
"'How dreadful of you!' gasped her
horrified parent. 'Did you get any
answers?'"
"'Only one—from father!'"
Nuff said!

culchah
The "Rambles" copy for this month
just came in and we see that the authors
are spreading their culture all over the
page by writing about the concerts. Not
to be outdone by our competitors of
"Rambles," we should like to point out
that we can absorb culture, too.
We go to lectures.
This year we sat and listened while
three noble Englishmen subtly told
us that in case of a world war we should
cdrne dashing to their rescue.
The last one was not really a Briton,
but a Scot, Mr. Lockhart, who pulled
the old one about the English thinking
themselves superior to all other races
and the Scots only thinking themselves
superior to the English, and gave us an
insight into the modesty of the British
people.
The best anecdote concerned the
foggy morning on which the headlines
of the ultra-conservative London Times
carried the following: "Storm in Chan-
nel: Continent Isolated."
staff change
This being the last issue for which the
present staff is responsible, it seems ap-
propriate that we bid an editorial fare-
well, so to speak. We once read an
article concerning ex-presidents in which
the writer expressed the view that no
person ever left the White House with-
out experiencing an acute abdominal
pain.

Now, of course, we are not trying to
allude to any similarity between the
Technic and the White House, but we
do feel just a little saddened at the
thought of leaving the Technic. We
have been connected with the magazine
as a subscriber since approximately two
minutes after we arrived at this school
(at which time Jim Walker extracted
from us one dollar), and actively for the
past three and a half years.
So it seems just a little funny to be
through. We've had a lot of fun on the
magazine and we hope we haven't bored
you too much.
Next month, then, the initial effort of
the new staff will appear. We want to
wish them the best of luck, but we're
frankly not very much worried about
their need of it. They'll, in all probabil-
ity, make anything we've been able to
accomplish look a little pale.

HIGGINS brings you a new stopper
for your greater convenience
This improved quill stopper has been adopted for the famous
Higgins Drawing Ink desk bottle to add to its convenience
and safety. Its several new features are as follows:
1 Shoulder ridges make stopper easy to grip for turning to remove
from bottle neck and prevent rolling when stopper is placed
on a sloping drawing table.
2 Stopper is weighted so it always rests with point of quill up.
3 Flat side on steeple provides a thumb rest which is so arranged
that open face of quill is always uppermost when thumb is
placed upon it, thus guarding against spilling.
4 Quills are genuine feather quills which will not splinter or
break and are just right to take up enough ink for one filling
of ruling pen.
5 Large cork makes possible bottle neck wide enough to admit
freely lettering pen or brush.
New stoppers and empty bottles may be purchased from your College Store or Stationer

brazilian note
There has been a lot of talk concern-
ing the marvelous opportunities for the
young engineers in Brazil these days.
Of some of the stories we were naturally
skeptical. However, Professor A. H.
White showed us a letter the other day
from a prosperous Brazil-dwelling friend
of his, who prefers to remain anony-
mous. We found it interesting and edu-
cational, and decided to pass it on to
you. The following are random excerpts.
"When I wrote you that opportunities
for chemical engineers in Brazil are
enormous, it was no overstatement. Al-
though there are a multitude of Euro-
pean technologists here, very few of
them are competent, and the state of
our economic system is just beginning to
emerge from that of a colonial country.
Industry is growing by leaps and
bounds. Without exaggeration, every
company that has imported technical
help from the States is making money,
and plenty of it. Unfortunately, the
amount of capital that is wasted in
half-baked schemes is staggering. . . .
"These people have yet to learn the
American method of selling for smaller
profit with a larger volume, and of mak-
ing the customer not only satisfied, but
your friend, too. Therein lies the basis
of the success of most Americans here.
. . . It is a generally accepted fact that
since Mr. Roosevelt inaugurated his
good neighbor policy, esteem of Ameri-
cans has grown to good sized propor-
tions. It is safe to say that a Brazilian
would rather have dealings with an
American than with most of his own
race, and surely rather than with the
Germans or the British. The answer is
that they have been stung too often,
and appreciate the better business meth-
ods"
Referring again to the attractive op-
portunities offered by Brazil: "However,
this is applicable mostly to Americans
who have come here in managerial posi-
tions, or as partners in going businesses.
For a young fellow without any connec-
tions and little capital to come here is
hazardous and not very promising. I
say this for one reason. The standard of
living is very low; an American could
not possibly live on the usual 600 to 800
milreis per month. (1 U. S. dollar is now
12.7 milreis.) Brazil is certainly not a
salaried man's country; the best way
for a newcomer to learn the ropes is to
be sent here on contract to an American
firm. More and more companies are
opening plants in Brazil. If this Import-
Export loan to Brazilian plants ever ma-
terializes, Americans will be in here with
a very firm footing, and Brazil will
really 'go to town'."
relaxation
We were sitting in on one of the
Choral Union Concerts the other night,
and started wondering why the per-
centage of students to town folks and
faculty was so low. Probably, we
thought, it is because many of the stu-
dents don't realize the benefits to be
derived from listening to good music.
From a purely mechanical standpoint,
a fine symphony orchestra impresses us
every time with its fine coordination.
To watch such an organization is to ob-
serve a highly-perfected, machine-like
precision, and yet each participating
unit is an artist in his own right.
As with any art, the more we learn
about it, the more we appreciate its
finer details. This applies especially to
music as one comes to recognize more
and more tunes with each concert. A fa-
miliarity with the air enables us to ap-
preciate it as an old friend.
To many who attend them, these con-
certs present an opportunity for com-
plete freedom of thought, even tend to
promote a sort of creative reflecting. We
have heard of one consulting engineer
who plays symphony records when he
is attempting to solve some difficult
problem. He claims he can concentrate
much better with the fine music softly
playing as a background to his thoughts.
Finally, and perhaps most important,
it gives us a sense of complete relaxa-
tion. We can't relax attending a swing
concert, or a stuffy movie house, but
after listening to a concert of classical
music, we come out with that solid satis-
fied feeling of an evening well spent.
rules and wigs
It's amazing what a little research
will do. What with the annual engi-
neers' brawl coming up in the near
future, our idle minds turned to the
subject of brawls in general; engineers,
18
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


turned out that the massive slide rule
around which the Slide Rule Ball tra-
dition is centered, first appeared in one
of the Union Operas years and years
ago. The engineers managed to acquire
the elephantine calculator for their
dance decorations in subsequent years.
Then the fun began as the lawyers
became obsessed with the beauty of the
thing and now try annually to spirit it
away.
Let's go all the way back to the be-
ginning of this affair and delve into a
bit of tradition. It all began back in
the days before prohibition, when the
lawyers and the engineers had classes
together in the same buildings, and the
lawyers received their degrees without
the pre-law period in the literary col-
lege. This was back in the good old days
when several beers along State Street
held the place of the ten o'clock coffee
at the Parrot.
It seems that the laws and engi-
neers had even less respect for each
other then than they do now. Generally,
however, the physical expression of this
counter espirit de corps was confined to
three major displays. One of these was
the annual spring athletic contest be-
tween the engineers and the devotees
of the Bar. These contests usually ter-
minated in a running argument which
poured up State Street and came to an
untimely end on the campus proper.
The second conflict usually occurred
at the annual senior "swingout" parade,
that was, and is now, held just before
graduation. Woe be unto the luckless
lawyer who at this time had the temer-
ity to trespass beneath the Engineering
Arch. The engineers considered it their
hallowed duty to prevent any aspiring
barrister from desecrating the sanctity
of the Arch with his presence—and en-
gineers are not prone to verbal persua-
sion. It soon became the custom for
the lawyers to separate from the swing-
out parade as it approached the Arch,
beat a sedate but hurried retreat around
the Annex, and rejoin the begowned
throng on the East University side of
the Arch.
The third outbreak of this hymn of
hate transpired on the night of the Slide
Rule Ball. It seems that the lawyers'
Crease Dance has an uncanny faculty of
occurring on the same night. Both law-
yers and engineers greeted this night
with a rosy glow of enthusiasm. Once a
group of playful engineers wandered
over to their rivals' dance and left a
"stink bomb," then took their leave.
The "Shysters" retaliated by thoroughly
dousing the intrepid engineers with
water not overly cool. Occasionally
such weapons as antiquated eggs were
used to carry on the fray at a greater
distance.
Then came the day when the law-
yers, no longer able to withstand the
trials of daily life, and growing feeble in
mind and body, moved into their quiet
sanctum on the far side of campus,
away from the hue and cry of the mad-
dening crowd.
The feud has died out now for the
most part, though every year some
young blood in the Law Quad tries his
hand at the game of capturing the
famed Slide Rule on the night of the
rival social flings. However, the
Slide Rule Ball and the Crease Dance
continue on, the rest fast falling into
the happy shades of tradition. Or maybe
not so fast after all.

GLEANINGS FROM HERE AND THERE

Scientific American
mounting press
Metallurgical samples can now be
mounted in glass-clear, shatter-proof
mountings of "Lucite," by use of a new
specimen mounting press. There are a
number of advantages to the metal-
lurgist in having samples mounted in a
block of material that has all the good
qualities of glass with none of its de-
fects.
"Lucite" is a recently developed
plastic — methyl methacrylyte — which
can be changed by polymerization from
a crystalline powder into a glass-like
solid. "Lucite" will resist pressures up
to 8000 pounds per square inch, yet can
be cut, sawed, machined, molded, or
cast. It has the optical qualities of fine
glass.
Quick to see the advantages of
"Lucite" as a mounting material, an en-
terprising scientific manufacturer built
a handy and easily operated press for
the molding of "Lucite" around metal
and other specimens.

Aluminum News Letter
Lucite mounting press.
Consisting of a hydraulic press capa-
ble of exerting 5000 pounds pressure
and an aluminum heating tool, the ap-
paratus accomplishes polymerization of
the plastic material in a minimum of
time and with little trouble. Rapid
heating of the steel cylinder holding the
sample is accomplished by the high heat
conductivity of the aluminum heating
tool. Equally rapid cooling of the sam-
ple after polymerization to prevent clou-
diness and gas bubbles in the "Lucite"
is done by an aluminum cooling tool.
electrical voice
Built almost entirely of apparatus
used in the everyday telephone, a new
device has recently been developed that
will actually create speech. Built as a
scientific novelty for educational display
at the San Francisco Exposition and the
World's Fair in New York, it represents
the first machine of its kind in existence.
The VToder, as the device is called, is
controlled by skilled operators who sit
at a keyboard somewhat similar to that
of the old-fashioned parlor organ, and
carry on a conversation by simply press-
ing keys singly or in combination. Al-
though the apparatus talks with a slight
electrical accent, a skilled operator can
make it say what she wishes. An inter-
esting sidelight occurred when the de-
signers noticed that the mannerisms of
speech of the operator were reproduced
by the machine. That is, as the southern
girl drawled and the northern girl clip-
ped her syllables, so did the particular
machine which she operated.
In conceiving the machines, designers
of the Voder first broke human speech
into two definite divisions. One of these
is based on the turbulence of the air
stream and its reinforcing resonances in
the mouth cavity. This division em-
braces all whispering, and such sounds
as "s," "th," and "f." The Voder uses
an electrical hiss, controlled by several
keys to give it a variable quality. Other
keys make the "stop" consonants like
"d," "k," and "p."
The second sound division, concerned
mostly with the vowel sounds like "a,"
"e," and "o," is produced in the human
voice by the vocal chords. These sounds
are very complex and somewhat musical.
Their source in the Voder is the so-
called "relaxation oscillator" which
gives a saw-toothed wave, in contrast to
the smoothly rounded wave of a pure
note. This saw-toothed wave has a fun-
damental note which gives the whole
sound a definite pitch. Thus broad pitch
changes mark the difference between
male and female voices, while gliding
changes of pitch over small ranges con-
stitute inflection. The whole voice sys-
tem is controlled by a pedal, ten selec-
tive keys, one volume key, and a wrist
switch to change from consonants to
vowels.
can growth
Tin cans are made by the billions.
Yes, billions, but not very long ago all
of the cans in use were made by hand.
Xot long after their invention in Eng-
land in 1810, a good day's output for
a skilled workman was sixty cans. The
present rate of manufacture is 300 per
minute.
Recent additions to the list of canned
products are ginger ale, grape juice,
potato salad, french fried potatoes, and
fricasse of chicken. It is no wonder that
a foreign observer once said, "Ameri-
cans eat what they can, and can what
they can't."

professor love
Every reader of this magazine no
doubt has had indirect contact with
Professor Love, through his text books
in mathematics. Many have known him
personally as instructor or in his ca-
pacity of classifier in the Math Depart-
ment. Despite this wide influence and
evidence of success as a teacher, Pro-
fessor Love says today that the best
feature of the profession is the long an-
nual vacation.
The story begins about 56 years ago,
when Clyde Klton Love was born in
Bancroft, Michigan. He attended Flush-
ing High School and Flint High School,
where his main extra-curricular interests
were sports, especially fishing and base-
ball. Coming to the University of Mich-
igan in 1901, Love entered the College
of Engineering and stayed three semes-
ters, when his interest in mathematics
outgrew that in engineering, and he
transferred to the Literary School. (At
that time, engineers were taught practi-
cally no math beyond calculus.)
After getting his bachelor's degree, he
came back to the University and ac-
cepted a job as math instructor in the
Engineering School. He steadily pro-
gressed to a full professorship in 1922,
in the meantime receiving his doctor's
degree and publishing several papers on
integral, differential, and difference
equations. For the last twenty years,
however, his principal professional in-
terest has been writing text books: we
are all familiar with his Analytic
Geometry and Calculus.
From his long experience as instruc-
tor, Lo%'e could no doubt tell many
stories, both on himself and on his stu-
dents. As a teacher of algebra, he has
always maintained that the inclusion of
determinants in an elementary course is
of rather doubtful value. Thus, perhaps,
it was subtle apple-polishing when, in
answer to an inquiry as to his progress,
a rather backward Freshman once re-
plied that ''he was getting along fine
with everything except those darn 'det-
riments'.'' (P.S. The student flunked the
course.)
C. E. believes the greatest compliment
he ever received as a teacher was paid
him by a student. This student had just
flunked a math course under another in-
structor and was complaining to him
about the poor quality of his teaching
methods. "Well," said his prof, "whom
do you like?"
"I like Love."
"And how did you get along with
him?"
"Oh, he kicked me out of the class."
C. E. Love has always greatly en-
joyed an outdoor life, and that is the
reason for his appreciation of long sum-
mer vacations. Since he was fifteen
years old, a part of every summer has
been spent in northern Michigan. Now
he owns a tract of land on Burt Lake in
Cheboygan County, where his chief di-
version is wood-cutting.
Clyde Love also likes to travel, to the
country and not to the city, to the new
and not to the old. He has covered
many miles west of the Mississippi and
also in the South. He has little desire to
visit Europe, but his one great ambition
today is to make an extended trip
through the African continent. We all
wish you luck, Professor Love, in ful-
filling that wish.
jack
elsner
May we introduce the first of our own
office habitues. He is Jack Eisner, pres-
ent Managing Editor of the Technic.
Jack was a well traveled gent before
coming to Michigan. Born in Racine,
Wisconsin, he traveled about the coun-
try until he finally settled down long
enough to graduate from high school in
Oak Park, Illinois. At the present time
he seems to have completed a cycle. He
calls Racine his home town again.
John Eisner, as such, is an unknown
in his own fraternity. To his brothers he
is known as "J. Stuart" and "Scoop."
The name "Scoop" comes from his ap-
parent inability to realize news events
at their proper times. They tell us that

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


fall of Shanghai.
Jack's first year of college life was
spent at Central Y.M.C.A. College in
Chicago. His first year on this campus
occurred the next year, and was a busy
one. He joined Alpha Kappa Lambda
Fraternity, Sigma Rho Tau, and worked
on the Business and Advertising Staffs
of the Technic. His second year he
fought off the usual ''Sophomore Let-
down," and continued his activities, be-
coming a member of Quarterdeck, con-
tinuing his work on the Technic staff,
and helping to compile the Freshman
Handbook. His last two years have kept
pace with the preceding ones. He has
been a counselor at Rendezvous Camp,
Floor Chairman of the Slide Rule Ball,
Publication Editor of the Technic, and
finally Managing Editor of the Tech-
nic.
The thing that impresses us about
Jack is the way that he continually
goes out of his way to convince people
that he is a quiet "do nothing" sort of
a fellow, while everything seems to
point in the opposite direction. He
lists his hobby as photography. Swim-
ming and tennis make up his athletic
program when he is able to find time to
spend in sports. He has spent summers
profitably working in a shipyard, a trac-
tor factory, and as a counselor at a
boys' camp.
This June Jack intends to leave the
University a full fledged Naval Archi-
tect. (Ed. Note: We admire his gen-
erosity, but just what would the Uni-
versity do with a full fledged Naval
Architect?) All kidding aside, Jack, best
of luck.
tim hird
That man's here again! Urbane W.
Hird, better known as Tim, Thundering
Hird, U. W., or the Lughead, steps into
the spotlight. He's a big blond lad, hov-
ering near the six foot mark, with a
build that makes him gcx&gt;d dark-alley
material, a sense of humor, and likeable
ways.
Tim was born in Cleveland, Ohio,
back in the war excitement days, and
now lives in Lakewood, a Cleveland
suburb, where he went to high school.
During high school, he worked for the
City Ice and Fuel Company, and as an
usher in the movies. After graduating
from high school, Tim went to sea for
fifteen months and worked as a coal
tosser, fireman, deckhand, and quarter-
master on an oil tanker between Tam-
pico, Mexico, and the Atlantic seaboard.
He tired of this life after being rolled
(robbed, reefed, or deprived of total
wherewithal) by his shipmates, and
studied for a competitive exam for the
U. S. Naval Academy. He won the ap-
pointment but was rejected for poor eye-
sight, and came to Michigan as the best
place to enter into studies connected
with the sea.
Despite his experience, Tim claims to
have been the greenest of all green
freshmen. He tried out for football and
wrestling, and got his numerals. As cap-
tain of the freshman class in the Soph-
Frosh game he aided materially in mak-
ing the class of thirty-eight a practi-
cally extinct species, only the fit having
survived. His most vivid memories of
the freshman year are the omniscience
of Professor A. D. Moore, and the

indulged in a little class politics on the
side. The summer of 1938 was spent at
summer school piling up an average,
playing golf, swimming nights at Loch
Alpine, and drinking quart bottles of
beer with the writer and a select motley
crew. In his junior year, too, he met
the girl and hasn't been rational or
orderly in his thinking since. All of
which brings us up to the present, and
his senior year.
We purposely saved the statistics for
a single paragraph. Just hold tight and
we'll take them at a single swoop.
Freshman year: Class Vice-President,
Delta Upsilon Fraternity. Sophomore
year: track, football, Slide Rule Dance
Committee, Triangles, and Secretary of
same. Junior year: Steward of Quar-
terdeck, Men's Council, letter in wrest-
ling, Social Chairman of D. U., Presi-
dent of Vulcans. Senior year: Executive
Committee of M-Club, Judiciary Com-
mittee of Men's Council, Engineering
Council, D. U. Provincial Delegate,
President of the Senior Class. That's
enough, exhale; we'll eliminate the de-
tails.
Tim has expressed some rare likes,
dislikes, and ambitions, which perhaps
we'd better omit. We have our own
ideas of his personal success after
graduation. As for himself, he doesn't
know definitely what he wants to do
after he graduates, but he still has a
very firm belief in Santa Claus.

ture of the camp for 1917 the Alumni will find (front row) Prof. Johnston, Deans
Cooley and Davis, Profs. King and Hoad, Dr. Stouffer; (second row, left) Prof. Mer-
rick; (fourth row, right) Prof. Bleekman.
Since 1929 the camp has been in the valley of the Hoback River, 20 miles south of
Jackson and about 75 miles south of the Yellowstone Park. It is on the highway con-
necting the Lincoln Highway at Rock Springs, Wyoming, with the Park. The work is
arranged to permit a three days' trip to the Park as well as week-end trips to nearer
points of interest.
Students and faculty are housed comfortably in permanent buildings provided with
running water, electric lights, and a modern sanitary system. The cost for the 8 weeks'
session is about $150. The 1939 session of Camp Davis will begin on June 19 and end
on August 11.
Inquiries concerning the camp should be addressed to Professor Harry Bouchard,
College of Engineering, Ann Arbor, Michigan.

A BIG SQUEEZE
IT TAKES a lot ot squeeze to put a 1,000,000-volt x-ray
equipment in a container only tour feet in diameter
and seven feet long, especially when its less-powerful
predecessors required a special building 62 teet long, 32 feet
wide, and 36 feet high. But recently, G-E scientists
applied the necessary squeeze and completed some surpris-
ingly compact x-ray equipment.
Such squeezing naturally involves a few innovations in
ilesign. So innovations were introduced. The 11-section
x-ray tube was put inside the novel transformer, in the
space normally taken by an iron core. Gas having an
impressive-sounding name, dichlorodirluoromethane, was
used instead of oil as an insulating medium, 100 pounds
ot this gas doing the work ot six tons ot conventional oil.
Then the equipment was mounted in the grounded metal
container, thereby enclosing the 1,000,000-volt circuit and
eliminating the hazard of electric shock. Looking at the
apparatus, you note a striking absence of moving parts,
for the control of the apparatus is essentially electrical.
The first of the new units will be installed this spring
in Memorial Hospital, New York City, providing medical
science with another powerful weapon in its constant
war on disease.

LIGHTS/ ACTION/ CAMERA/
IN A specially constructed room alongside the studios
of the G-E international short-wave stations, the famil-
iar words, "Lights! Action! Camera!" will soon be heard.
For General Electric's new television station at Sche-
nectady is nearing completion.
The television transmitter, perched atop the Helderberg
Hills 12 miles outside the city, will be at least 250 feet
higher than the station in the tower of the Empire State
building, New York. And, broadcasting with 10,000 watts,
it will be the most powerful television station in the
I'nited States.
There will be -literally—no strings to the transmitter.
C. A. Priest, Maine '22 and an ex-Test man, Engineer of
the Radio Transmitter Engineering Department of
General Electric, has announced that an ultra-short-wave
transmitter will be used instead of the usual cable to
relay the images from the Schenectady studios to the main
transmitter in the Helderbergs.

THE "HOUSE OF MAGIC"
BECOMES TWINS
THE world-famous G-E "House ot Magic" show has
become twins. It had to, for it was placed in the
predicament ot having to be in two places at one time—
the New York and the San Francisco hairs.
One twin —directed by R. L. Smallman, Calif. Tech '33
and ex-Test man -is already holding court on San Fran-
cisco's Treasure Island, site ot the Pageant of the Pacific.
The other makes its bow April 30, opening day of the
New York World's Fair. Its director is W. A. Gluesing,
Wisconsin '23, also an ex-Test man.
The thousands ot visitors to these Fairs will see such
teats ot modern magic as a voice-controlled toy train, a
magic carpet, zigzagging pictures of sound. They will see
the stroboscope, which makes it possible to see the spokes
ot a whirling wheel just as it the wheel were motionless.
They will see a light beam sawed by the teeth of a comb.
However, entertaining as these demonstrations are, they
represent far more than mere tricks of modern magic
They symbolize the work in pure science that is con-
stantly taking place in G-E research laboratories—work
which is the basis ot General Electric's contributions to
the world of the future.

FIVE sophomores at a New England university
had been assigned to report on the residential
districts of a southern city, its principal prod-
ucts and the location of its plantations.
Hour after hour they thumbed through book

Then one of them had a happy idea—why
not telephone the city's Mayor? They did—
and in a few minutes had all the information
they needed.
No matter what the question—in college, in

LITTLE GRANULES OF
GREAT VALUE
ONE REASON Ethocel*, a recent Dow de-
velopment, is so much in the public eye
is its adaptability to a great variety of
products.
Ethocel, the trade name of Dow Ethyl
Cellulose, is a colorless, odorless, taste-
less, nontoxic member of the cellulose
family. It has already demonstrated its
right to exceptional distinction.
Ethocel is the only cellulose derivative
possessing both stability to heat and
solubility in a wide range of low-cost
solvents. It is bringing new qualities to
fast-drying varnishes and lacquers; add-
ing lustre and toughness to paper coat-
ings; providing protective finish to tex-
tiles. Makers of wire insulation welcome
its flexibility and dielectric properties.
Still other qualities that recommend
Ethocel to designers and manufacturers
of moulded products are dimensional
stability, resistance to dilute acids and
alkalies, low flammability and high re-
sistance to sunlight and humidity. Ethocel
film and sheet provide special advantages
for packaging and other purposes.
And so in the little white granules of
Ethocel you find a material of truly amaz-
ing versatility, as well as manifold virtues.
Probably no other product among the
more than three hundred Dow develop-
ments so greatly stimulates the imagi-
nation or makes a more useful contri-
bution to industry.

IT wouldn't be safe in writing for a
monthly magazine to make any spe-
cific statements about the size of Ger-
many, for before the issue could possibly
be in circulation, the status would likely
be utterly different. This condition
causes no little concern to most Ameri-
cans.
Yet the attempts of fascistic and com-
munistic organizations to invade Ameri
ca with a view to eventually controlling
it result in considerable lethargy, a sur-
prising amount of fatalism, and rela-
tively little alarm.
Particularly disheartening are those
people who seem completely resigned to
the fact that a world war is inevitable.
Such resignation will certainly be of no
aid in averting a potential war, and it
seems by all means best not to give up
until all hope is lost.
Probably the great majority te con-
spicuous for its lethargy, but at the
other extreme from the fatalists is a
rather large group which is very active
in opposing any influence which might
be termed "un-American." This latter
group is, however, probably one of the
most dangerous of all because more often
than not it uses tactics no less repulsive
than those of the groups opposed.
For instance Stackpole Sons are now
widely advertising an "unauthorized"
edition of Mein Kampj and are boast-
ing that no royalties go to Hitler. Their
reason for this high-handed procedure
is that Hitler has placed himself "out-
side the law."
That is fascistic.
Hitler wrote the book. Consequently,
no matter how much we disagree with
him, no matter how much we despise
him, the royalties are still his property.
We cannot deprive him of them without
being guilty of the exact behavior for
which we condemn him.
Some time ago a town in Indiana re-
fused Norman Thomas a permit to speak
on the ground that socialism would take
away our right of free speech. And, of
course, we will pass lightly over such
bulwarks of democracy as the D. A. R.
The greatest danger to our democracy
lies not in attacks from the outside, but
in such undermining from the inside.
We find organizations in this country,
however, which engage in dictatorial
tactics for reasons considerably less
noble than protection of majority rule.
Today there is also developing a ten-
dency on the part of some groups to
extend these powers to as great an ex-
tent as possible and continually to de-
crease the freedom of action of the
majority of the people involved. While
this may seem wise to them at the time,
there is a dangerous likelihood that the
people concerned, particularly if they
are young, may become reconciled to
having their lives ordered in small ways
and thus be prepared to take the medi-
cine of fascism with less nose-holding.
Any organization, small in size, which,
under the impression that it is pursuing
a wise course, attempts to rule arbitrar-
ily the lives of a larger group should
seriously consider whether its path lies
upward after all. For any group—
industrial, educational, or governmental
—which in any way fosters the princi-
ples of fascistic and arbitrary rule, is
violating the basic ideals upon which
America has been built.

CARL BREER, engineering execu-
tive and director of research for
Chrysler Corporation, is best character-
ized by the phrase "looking ahead."
Seated behind the desk in his most mod-
ernly furnished office, Mr. Breer ex-
plained to us some of the ideas and
philosophy that have grown out of his
experience in the field of automotive re-
search. Gray haired and broad shoul-
dered, he looks exactly what he is—a
veritable human dynamo. His forceful
way of speaking, punctuated by a ready
smile and a wave of his dark-rimmed
pince-nez, is an indication of the enter-
prise and large capacity' for work which
have brought him to the position he
holds today.
There are not many people in the
world who have early in life discovered
in what field of endeavor they would
like to concentrate, have found their
particular niche in that field, and have
then proceeded to rise to the top flights
of success. Carl Breer is one of those
few people. By dint of hard work and
the application of a philosophy that a
man's vocation should be his hobby, Mr.
Breer has become one of the most im-
portant figures in the automotive indus-
try. Among other things, he has directed
the research activities of the Chrysler
Corporation since it was founded, and
with his partners, Fred M. Zeder and
Owen R. Skelton, has been responsible
for the development of such automotive
engineering achievements as four-wheel
hydraulic brakes, scientific weight dis-
tribution, functional design, economical
high compression engines, fluid drive,
and many other features now character-
istic of the modern automobile. Mr.
Breer was a co-designer of the first
Chrysler automobile, built in 1924, and
has had an important influence on every
Chrsyler-built car since then. At the
present time he is also vice-president of
Airtemp, Incorporated; vice-president
and director of the Chrysler Institute
of Engineering; and a trustee of the
Detroit University School.
Mr. Breer has evidenced an immense
interest in the automotive field since
his early youth. Born in Los Angeles
in 1883, he attended the public schools
of his native city, Throop Polytechnic
Institute of Pasadena, and Leland Stan-
ford University from which he was grad-
uated in 1909 with a Bachelor of Arts
degree in Mechanical Engineering. In
1900, at the age of sixteen, he completed
one of the first steam cars to be built
on the Pacific Coast. This was instru-
mental in obtaining him summer em-
ployment with the Tourist Automobile
Company and later with the Duro Car
Company while completing his college
education.
In his senior year, Breer was selected
for the apprenticeship course at Allis-
Chalmers Company of Milwaukee, Wis-
consin, later becoming assistant to the
manager of the Steam Engine and Con-
denser Division of that company. In
1912, he joined the Moreland Distillate
Truck Company in Los Angeles as su-
perintendent of the plant. Two years
later, he organized and became part
owner of the Acme Electrical Auto
Works where he remained until 1916,
when he joined the Studebaker Corpora-
tion as research engineer. In 1920, with
Mr. Zeder and Mr. Skelton, he allied
himself with the Willys Corporation.
The Zeder-Skelton-Breer firm of con-
sulting engineers was organized the fol-
lowing year, and in 1923 transferred its
activities to the Maxwell Motor Car
Corporation. In 1925 Mr. Breer was
made executive engineer and director of
research of the Chrysler Corporation,
and in 1937 he was elected to the board
of directors.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


and Tau Beta Pi, and has received hon-
orary Master and Doctor of Engineer-
ing degrees. He is a member of Sigma
Alpha Epsilon and is active in the So-
ciety of Automotive Engineers, Ameri-
can Society of Mechanical Engineers,
National Research Council, American
Standards Association, American Insti-
tute of Physics, Detroit Society of
Model Engineers, the Engineering So-
ciety of Detroit, Detroit Board of Com-
merce, Franklin Institute, and 107th
Observation Squadron.
Research has such a fascination for
Mr. Breer that he has been compelled to
devote his entire life to that pursuit. He
has found a lure in his work Uiat appeals
to the pioneering instinct. Mr. Breer
says, "Many miss the thrill of the fron-
tiersman today because they mistake the
frontiers. Geographical frontiers have
practically vanished, it is true, but the
new pioneer splits molecules rather than
rails. Modern frontiers are reached
through the processes of imaginative
and inquiring minds. Once found, they
yield the same satisfying returns that
the discovery of new and fertile lands
gave to the geographical pioneers of
former days."
Mr. Breer believes that many engi-
neers can develop into executives if they
have the proper aptitudes and training.
He contends that it might be feasible,
by a careful study of engineering stu-
dents, to discover those with executive
tendencies and deliberately broaden
their curricula with a view to equipping
them for executive work. Mr. Breer also
suggests that a year or two of pre-
engineering study be required of all engi-
neering students. Courses in political
and social science, history, economics,
and a very considerable amount of Eng-
lish, are necessary to acquaint the engi-
neer with the primary implications of
his work and how it relates to the other
things which are going on around him.
Mr. Breer pointed out that the ac-
complishments of the student in college
cannot be determined exclusively by
grades. Fundamentals so well learned
that they become intuitive are far more
valuable than fundamentals learned only
by definition. Furthermore, academic
proficiency is of value only when it is
supplemented by the cultivation of the
associations that are a part of the col-
lege experience. The ability to get along
with people and to sell yourself and

your ideas is very important. A new idea
is worthless until it is incorporated in
the finished product and is bringing in
returns. The man with the new idea
must follow through and necessarily sell
the idea before it becomes effective. The
human element is one of the greatest
impediments to this process, and the
engineer who understands this, and is
prepared to overcome such impedance
is the man for whom industry is looking.
Mr. Breer made the interesting state-
ment that the engineering graduate of
today has greater opportunity than did
the graduate of thirty years ago. He
stated that the engineering field has ex-
panded and will continue to expand;
the real difficulty is that there are
now so many more branches in engineer-
ing that students find it difficult to lo-
cate that branch in which they are best
suited for specialization.
Mr. Breer admonishes the young engi-
neer to remember that there is no mo-
nopoly on engineering fundamentals. All
engineering progress is the outgrowth of
experience coupled with the application
of the known fundamentals, and these
same fundamentals are available to
everyone. Engineering opportunities
have never been so great as they are to-
day for men with imagination, initative,
and an infinite capacity for hard work.
Mr. Breer's concluding advice was
that the engineering graduate should
find the work he prefers to do and which
he enjoys doing. Make your play your
hobby, he says, and your hobby your
work. Find the work you like best and
you will find the work you can do best.
Put your best effort into whatever you
do; always give more than you expect
in return. You will be amply repaid by
the additional knowledge you acquire
and by the recognition that sooner or
later is bound to come to the man who is
not afraid to work.
We are easily convinced of the sound-
ness of this advice coming as it does
from a man whose entire professional
record is proof of its validity. If we
had ever entertained any ideas that
success in the engineering field is the
product of anything but hard work,
these ideas would have been fully dis-
pelled by the experience of this visit.
As a model of achievement for young
engineers we can give you no better than
Carl Breer, who decided what he wanted
to do in life—and then did it.

V\ 7HEN a slender, straight column
* * with rounded ends, uniform cross
section, and homogeneous material (con-
stant E and I) (Fig. 2) is concentrically
loaded with two mutually opposing
forces P, the column will remain straight
until P reaches a certain critical value.
Then the column will suddenly bend
sidewise and take on a curved shape.
This phenomenon is called buckling of
the column. In view of the fact that the
bent column is symmetrical relative to
the midpoint, point B, we decide that
the maximum deflection A (Fig. 2) will
occur at the midpoint of the column.
While the column remains straight, the
stress therein is given by the equation,
s = P/A. Once the column buckles, an
eccentricity is created and the maxi-
mum stress at its midpoint becomes:
P
A
Mc
I
PAc
I
This formula is correct, but has no
practical value, since A is indeterminate.
A is a function of the elastic curve. The
elastic curve, in turn, is a function of
the bending moment, while the bending
moment is a function of A, thus pre-
senting a vicious circle.
The analysis of the column will be
materially simplified if we can make an
intelligent guess as to the type of curve
the column will assume once it buckles.
In Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, which represent
columns with restrained ends, we note
that the elastic curves of these columns
in the buckled state present reversed
curves with one or more points of inflec-
tion, points of zero bending moment.
For example: The center portion A-C
(Fig. 4c) represents a column loaded
in a manner identical with the one rep-
resented by Fig. 2a. This fact eliminates
the possibility of the elastic curve of a
buckled column assuming the form of a
conic section. Any one of the conic sec-
tions, the circle, the parabola, or the
hyperbola, could not possibly be ex-
pressed as a continuous function, as
graphically shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4.
One equation, which might express
all of the various elastic curves which
a column might assume when it buckles
under the various conditions of loading
represented by Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4, is
the equation of the sine curve. Let us
then assume the equation of the elastic
curve of a buckled column to be a sine
curve, and on the basis of this assump-
tion derive Eulers formula, a formula
which is substantiated by a very large
number of authenticated tests. This pro-
cedure is not as arbitrary as it might
seem. For example: in the development
of the formula s = Mc/I, it is assumed
that a transverse plane, before bending
of the beam, remains a plane after bend-
ing. Once developed, the formula is
tested in the laboratory and found to
be reliable. Throughout this procedure
no one has ever looked inside a beam
and seen a transverse plane in its en-
tirety. The best that can be done is to
see the intersection cf such a plane with
the outer surface of a beam. Similarly
the process we propose to apply appears
as follows: the assumption is made, the
formula is developed, the formula is
checked by every conceivable test and,
if found reliable, this check in turn es-
tablishes the reasonableness of the as-
sumption.
If, then, the elastic curve of a buckled
column may mathematically be repre-
sented by the equation of a sine curve,
the equation of Fig. 2a is: x = A sin
(Try//). The bending moment in this
buckled column is given by the expres-
sion:
M = Px = P A sin
The deflection

(Figure. 2b)
The area under one-quarter of a sine
curve is 2/ir times the circumscribed
rectangle. Thus the area in which we
are interested, that between the limits
of point A and point B, Fig. 2b, is:
2 / PM

The y for this area is 2/tt times the
base of this circumscribed rectangle,
thus

We thus obtain:
Area y PA/:
"EI ~EW2
From the above expression it appears
that A is a function of A. This is pre-
cisely what we discussed at the outset.
If P is held constant after buckling has
commenced, an increase in A increases
the bending moment, which in turn in-
creases the deflection A. If we cancel
A and solve for P, we obtain:

P = , Euler's Formula.

The value of P obtained by this for-
mula is the critical value which initiates

provided the column is not stressed be-
yond the elastic limit. With only a very
slight increase in the value of P, equili-
brium would be destroyed, A would con-
tinue to increase until the elastic limit
in the material of the column is passed,
and the column would collapse com-
pletely and fail to return to its original
form after removing the load P.
Figure la represents a column built in
at the base, but unrestrained at its top.
When such a column is loaded with a
critical load P the top will sway to one
side and the column will assume a form
as shown in Fig. la. If free body
sketches be made of Fig. la and of the
top half (A-B) of Fig. 2a, it will appear
that both sketches are qualitatively
identical. Thus Fig. la is both qualita-
tively and quantitatively identical with
the top half of Fig. lb, which rep-
resents a column loaded similarly to
Fig. la. However, this column has a
length h, in which h = 21. The critical
load carried by the column (Fig. lb) is:
77-EI T2EI
~hr' ~W~'
which is identical with the critical load
carried by the column shown in Fig. la.
Figure 4a represents a column with
both ends built in. The free body sketch
for Fig. 4a appears as shown in Fig. 4b
and this in turn is identical with Fig. 4c.
Figure 4b may be divided in four equal
parts which will show that all four parts
are loaded identically. Thus the central
portion (A-C) of the elastic curve of
the column, shown in Fig. 4, is of a
length: h = 1/2. This central portion
A-C is loaded in a manner identical
with that shown in Fig. 2a. The critical
load P carried by this central portion
A-C (Fig. 4c) is identical with the crit-
ical load carried by the column shown
in Fig. 4a.
Thus:
^EI 4,r2EI
Figure 3a represents a column built in
at the bottom. The top is rounded and
is restrained against side sway by fric-
tion, or by means of a pin. This column
is prevented from assuming the form as
shown in Fig. la, and its elastic curve,
therefore, is as represented in Fig. 3a.
The point of inflection at C is a distance
h from the top. There is no bending
moment at this point of inflection C.
If a free body sketch is made of portion
A-C (Fig. 3a), it appears that portion
A-C is in equilibrium under the action
of two forces, which forces, therefore,
must be colinear. The force applied at
A must then have a horizontal compo-
nent in order that it may pass through
point C. The loading of column 3 will
thus consist of a vertical component V
and a horizontal component H as shown
in Fig. 3a, or it will consist of a single
resultant P as shown in Fig. 3b. If we
knew the relation between h and I (Fig.
3), the value of P would immediately
be determined. The elastic curve of the
buckled column (Fig. 3) will be qual-
itatively the same curve as those ap-
pearing in Figs. 1, 2, and 4. However,
it will be a sine curve with respect to a
y axis drawn through points A-C
(shown by the dash line, Fig. 3b), but
not with respect to the vertical through
A. If we draw a line through point D,
tangent to the sine curve and parallel
to the dash line A-C, it appears that the
distance A-C is two-thirds of the dis-
tance D-A. From this it follows that

THE life of a design engineer is fas-
cinating and, some would say, ro-
mantic, but it is not always happy nor
exceptionally lucrative. Although some
people would consider it a monotonous
career, it is none of that. In fact, it is
rather exciting and quite dynamic.
Design ability is certainly not inborn.
Most engineers are capable of develop-
Although Harold M. Harrison is
now Factory Superintendent of Vul-
tee Aircraft, he is by no means un-
qualified to write on the subject of
design. When we first requested that
he write the article, Mr. Harrison was
Production Design Engineer for the
Clenn L. Martin Co., and his work
had always been largely concentrated
in design.

ing into excellent designers. Good stu-
dents make good designers mainly be-
cause they are usually good at most
things anyway; poor students make
good designers because they generally
have a good background of experience
in generalities and in life.
Design consists of mentally setting
up a plan. The plan may be developed
by setting down a series of ideas and
portraying them with drawings to act
as a set of instructions for conveying
the ideas to the builder. It is thrilling
to dream or conceive of any object how-
ever simple or complex, however great
or small, to see it built into a definite
shape or form, and then to watch it
function and serve mankind.
The treatment of our subject must
necessarily be a general one although
design practice differs greatly in various
fields. In any one field there may be
what is known as a buyer's market or a
customer's market. In designing for the
buyer's market it would be predicted
that some object, if produced, would
probably be profitable to sell. Ex-
amples are an electric razor, an auto-
mobile, or a metal desk. Design of
these items is based upon requirements
which the designer establishes himself
in an effort to attract buyers. For the
customer's market, however, require-
ments of a design are specified by the
customer who asks for bids on any given
project. A submarine, a library build-
ing, or an airplane would usually be
designed for the customer's market. De-

It is irritating

be referred
to as draftsmen.
sign for quantity production is vastly
differentiated from that which may be
applied to a unit construction such as
a bridge or a battleship. Although all
of the above considerations and many
others influence the classes of design, it
is hoped that some helpful generalities
may be derived from this article, though
it appears at times to apply to specific
phases of design.
Graduates on first entering the field
of design may receive the astonishing
surprise that their college training seems
to have little application to their work.
It may appear that they are called upon
to design little gadgets of small conse-
quence. Their ego may suffer at times
when, for instance, they may be given
the job of providing that a seat in a
dining car is properly supplied with an
ash tray, of designing a longer handle
for a machine to aid in the ease of its
operation, or of designing a better
bracket for holding toilet paper in the
lavatory of an airplane. The glamorous
sound of "aeronautical engineer" was
somewhat lost to the writer when he
was first called upon to perform sim-
ilar kinds of tasks. If the performance
of them was design, it seemed that a
great deal of misguidance had been
given students at college for a good
many years. The great efforts expended
to gain passing grades in calculus, en-
gineering mechanics, and strength of
materials seemed to be of little avail. It
appeared that the first dozen assign-
ments were covered most successfully by
old experiences and observations, such
as remembering how an uncle once
utilized a small piece of sheet cut from
an old dairy can to repair the manure
spreader, or how, for instance, a neigh-
bor once used an old set of rolls to form
some fancy scroll work for his iron
fence.
Time proved that design is based on
experience which consists of observa-
tions taken in the past; that college
training serves mostly in the capacity
of qualifying one properly to judge the
merit of any ideas which may be con-
ceived as a result of a background of
experience.
Training of graduates for design may
include tracing, shop training courses,
developing flat patterns of formed parts
shown on other peoples' drawings, or
revising old designs at the directions of
others. Aptitude at these chores may
establish the first chance to advance.
Of paramount importance is the feeling
that older hands at design, with whom
inexperienced designers must work, may
have toward them. Their future success
may depend on whether they are taken
for "regular guys" or not.
The relationship of drafting to de-
signing is very confusing at first, and it
is irritating to young designers to be
referred to as draftsmen. Before enter-
ing into their careers they may have be-
lieved that the only kind of work done
on drawing boards is drafting; that de-
signers sat at mahogany desks with
bookcases and file cabinets for their
individual use as they directed the ef-
forts of lowly draftsmen. No such
pleasantness can be expected, but any
early disappointments along this line
are lost when it is realized that drafting
is merely a means of portraying design
schemes and ideas, and that drawings
serve as a message of instruction for
building a creation into a reality. Gen-
uine draftsmen portray other peoples'
ideas; most designers portray their own.
Slowly, jobs of greater importance are
assigned to them and suddenly it is un-
derstood by some draftsmen that a
transition has taken place such that now
they are portraying their own ideas as
well as someone else's. This transition
to design is complete when assignments
consist of starting with blank pieces of
vellum with the task of creating some-
thing. This something may range from
a collapsible wheel chair to a retracting

fense guns.
Shop training courses are given for
new members of organizations in a great
many instances. Such training courses,
or practical shop experience at some
time or other, help the young designer
appreciate the significance of manufac-
turing problems. It is drastically essen-
tial that young men in this field be
instilled with a sufficient smattering of
general shop principles to the extent
that they may recognize problems of
manufacture which may exist in their
designs. Although actual drilling in shop
practice is not essential, acquaintance
with shop problems is necessary, because
it familiarizes beginners with manu-
facture just enough so that they may
recognize situations which require the
advice of an expert. Many so-called
"nasty" items are released to the shops,
completely designed without design
engineers ever realizing that fabrica-
tion or construction difficulties are
presented.
Young designers learn that too much
advice cannot be taken, but intelligent
use of it is the mark of real design abil-
ity. The motives and interests of peo-
ple or groups of people advising him
should be taken into account before
parts of advice or all of it is applied to
a design. In other words, the designer
is the only person who has a complete
bird's-eye view of the design as it affects
the entire organization, consisting of the
sales department which is interested in
the performance of the product, the tool
design department which is interested in
equipment required for production, the
purchasing department regarding mate-
rial costs and procurement, and the shop
departments regarding fabrication and
assembly costs.
Discouragement is common in young
designers, because so many people have
no respect for their ideas. Their sug-
gestions are ignored, and some of their
schemes when developed prove to be
impractical and often appear foolish
after they have seen in the shop that
which was difficult to visualize on the
board. In groping for ideas, a young
engineer may find that at the end of
a day little has been done that could be
called work. He may find that the paper
on the drawing board is practically
blank, and when the boss, in walking
past, glances at the board with a scowl,
he shudders and feels positive that he
will never become a good designer. If
he could think of something, he would
draw it. It seems that anything that
flashes across his mind is given little
respect by his background of technical
training, whereas the chap across the
aisle on the adjoining board, who he
understands has never even gone to
college, seems to pull a dozen ideas out
of a hat for each meager one he is able
to supply on any subject. Years later,
he may realize that he was having just
as many thoughts, but didn't recognize
them as ideas because his technical
background would not respect them suf-
ficiently to classify those thoughts as
ideas. Those thoughts which he does
express as ideas are sound ones, because
when measured with technical judgment
they are not found wanting. So it
eventually becomes known around the
office that he is a middling good de-
signer and that maybe these college guys
aren't as bad as they are advertised.
Fast draftsmen are not always speedy
designers. Young graduates are thrilled
when they learn that they can practically
double their designing speed by getting
some kind of lines on paper. Something
to look at; something to erase; some-
thing to change. As stated above, de-
sign is change. Development of ideas
via free use of an eraser leads junior
designers to realize that design consists
of erasing and that to erase lines even
to the point of getting back to blank
paper represents design progress. The
necessity for erasing is proof that a
better idea has grown.
Although a certain amount of inven-
tive ability is helpful in preliminary de-
sign conceptions, the majority of de-
signers are usually engaged in deciding
on and developing the type of innards
which "the beast" requires. This is the
greatest fun, and thus many fellows
find that they are good designers
in spite of many earlier self-condemna-
tions for lack of ideas and inventiveness.
Their training enables them to choose
types of design as determined by their
soundness, practicability, and simplicity.
To choose whether certain parts are best
produced as castings, forgings, pre-fab-
ricated sections, stampings, tubings, or
molded plastics, for instance, is fascin-
ating. To determine the best methods
of joining members taxes one's ingenuity
to the fullest extent, but great gratifica-
tion is derived from knowing that the

&amp;omment5
WHEN the typical engineering sen-
ior thinks of going to work
after graduation, he does most of his
thinking in terms of big companies. It
is quite natural that he should. It is
the big company that is well known. It
advertises nationally. Its name is a by-
word in engineering circles, and is fre-
quently mentioned in the classroom. It
probably has a recruiting and training
program for college graduates, and
therefore sends a representative to the
campus. In contrast, a small company
rarely does these things. It automati-
cally follows that a senior has a working
fund of information about big compa-
nies, and that what he knows about the
little companies is incidental and acci-
dental.
Yet, small companies collectively em-
ploy a great many engineers, and are
therefore potential employers of young
graduates. Moreover, it is quite possible
that they will begin to take a still larger
proportion of young graduates. Why?
First, numerous students of th; sub-
ject have in recent years questioned the
efficiency of the giant company. It has
been frequently pointed out that exces-
sive size furnishes its own handicaps.
In fact, there is a very definite tendency
already in full swing, for the giant cor-
poration to explode into widely scat-
tered units, each being given a large
measure of autonomy.
Second, examine the factors existing
today that favor .the small company in
ways not heretofore available. Today,
electric power in any reasonable quan-
tity is ready at hand (or can be made
so) in huge areas. Today, a fine system
of highways permits the use of fast
trucking of freight, both to get raw or
semi-finished materials to a small fac-
tory, and to take its product to market
or a shipping point. Thus, for the first
time, the small factory can be located
almost at will, which, in a great many
cases, means in a small town instead of
in an industrial center.
But neither of these essential factors
is, perhaps, enough to bring a wide-
spread decentralization of industry.
Man-power is still needed, and always
will be. Are men, and their wives, willing
to move to a small town and stay there?
If certain advantages are available, yes.

If not, definitely no. But the advan-
tages have arrived. The same fine high-
ways, plus the family car, let the family
drive to the city when it is desired to
do so. The small town can now offer
safe water, sewage systems, fire protec-
tion, telephone service anywhere, the ra-
dio, good movies, good schools, food-
stuffs as good as can be found anywhere,
open country nearby, a garden, and an
increasing amount of good community
life. We should not forget the small
town's lower cost of living.
All these things are here, in numer-
ous small towns. Other factors may be
in process of arriving. To mention just
one, there is the problem in the near
future of economically turning farm
products to industrial use. No one can
see the future clearly; but there is the
real possibility that some of the pro-
posed farm crops will be at least partly
processed in small plants located in the
region of production, later to be trucked
to some link in the general market for
semi-finished oils, hydrocarbons, plas-
tics, or what-not, or delivered directly
to a large finishing plant.
The fact is that small companies al-
ready exist in great numbers, and that
many of them either employ engineers,
or should do so. If new factors will tend
further to decentralize industry (and I
both hope and expect that this will
happen), young engineers will increas-
ingly find the work they are looking for
in the smaller companies. The sooner
they realize this, the better it will be.
both for them, and the small companies.
To locate our graduates in small com-
panies is a very difficult problem, be-
cause there are so many of these little
firms, that no school can possibly be in
touch with all of them. In "electrical
manufacturing" alone, there are sup-
posed to be over 600, nearly all being
small.
The senior himself holds the only key
to the solution, in the main sense and in
the long run. He is the man who wants
to go to work. Then, unless he has an
incurable (and perfectly legitimate) big
company complex, he must proceed to
become small-company conscious. He
will do some research to unearth and
locate some of the many firms that have
his kind of work, and then will begin
a personal placement campaign.
Back in the pioneering days, a young-
ster of 23 did not need to be very ex-
ceptional in order to raise a beard,
borrow some capital, and "go into bus-
iness" for himself. Today, the young
man keeps shaved, acquires a college
education, and altogether too often ex-
pects a big company representative to
come along and pick him off. It is a
very exceptional young graduate who
goes in business for himself. In fact,
times and conditions are different. But
the way to be exceptional today, is to
be willing to take the risk of joining a
small company. I am afraid that too
many graduates hunger for the apparent
security offered by a large, old, sup-
posedly reliable firm. They are missing
some very fine chances to get in with a
small concern and help it to succeed.

CAST IRON AND CONFIDENCE
A Molybdenum addition to cast iron has often proved
the best way to get the most out of money spent to
improve materials.
The selection of a gray cast iron with 0.75% Moly for
64-inch rubber mill drives is a typical example. The
Moly iron is strong (a test showed 61,000 p.s.i.) and
tough enough to stand severe service. Despite the nec-
essary hardness, machining presents no difficulties.
Thus full advantage is taken of the economy of cast
iron, without sacrifice of performance capacity.
This is only one of the many cases in which Molyb-
denum iron has brought about a combination of econ-
omy with dependability. Investigation may show that
you can apply it with advantage. Our booklet "Molyb-
denum in the Foundry," is free to any interested en-
gineering students on request

We went to the movies the other
night. During the nine o'clock inter-
mission we noticed, while the thunder-
ing herd was tramping down the aisles,
that all of them were students.
And we remembered vaguely that we
once heard one of the local theatre man-
agers say that "only a small portion"
of his audience was made up of students.
Come to think of it though, we did
see one man who was not a student.
He was a professor.
Last Christmas we got held up with
work on the Technic and had to stick
around a couple of days after the stu-
dents had left. One of those nights we
went to the movies and found that the
manager had been most considerate; he
apparently had heard of our coming, for
he had reserved twelve entire rows just
for us.
The theatre is to be complimented,
however; they had a good short the last
time we went. Of course, we had to
exist through three concoctions that
should have been keeping company with
the "face on the cutting room floor,"
but even one good short was somewhat
unusual for this town.
However, spring is coming along now,
so the theatre managers can stop worry-
ing. As soon as it gets hot, the patrons
will be so occupied with their sweltering
that they will hardly notice the crummy
programs.
Our home town has weather very sim-
ilar to Ann Arbor's and all five theatres
are air-conditioned. Yet this fair me-
tropolis doesn't even provide washed air.
We know all the stock excuses. "Time
and time again attempts have been
made to sink wells but all have been
unsuccessful." It seems just a little ob-
vious to point out the municipal system
which is used as a water source by
theatres in most cities.
Oh, well, someday a rival chain will
open a movie house locally and put the
boys on their toes—we hope!
and bouquets
We want to extend our sincere thanks
to a man whom we feel holds the most
difficult and thankless job on campus.
That man is Walter B. Rea. One of
his many duties is to act as contact
man between dance committees and the
music agencies.
We have just
finished a two
weeks wrestling
match with the
bookers — than
whom no one is
slimier this side
of hell — and
we're sure that
our hair has
started to gray
and we know for
a fact that we lost ten pounds. It's really
a tough job. In the first place the com-
mittee can't agree on an "ork." And
when they finally do agree, the bands on
which they settle have just signed for
a date at State College, Pa., or else are
just moving into the Savoy Ballroom for
an extended engagement. And whatever
is available wants too much money. So
all in all it's a very wearing job and
we're glad it's over.
But it dawned on us finally that we

only had to get one band. Dean Rea
has to get twenty. Each committee
feels that no one has ever had a harder
time and spends half its time crying on
Dean Rea's shoulder. And when finally
a band is signed those who are dissatis-
fied go off in a corner and gripe that a
third rater has been foisted off on them.
Yep, it's a thankless job and one we
certainly wouldn't want. But "Bud"
Rea seems to go on maintaining his
equilibrium though caught between two
fires, and does a remarkably fine job,
especially considering the factors against
him.
We think he's one swell guy.
random note
Back before the recent celebration
of the tenth anniversary of the Slide
Rule Ball, while we were still spending
our nights throwing javelins at booking
agents, we were trying to design an ad
to run in the March Technic in case we
booked an orchestra before going to
press.

One idea was to list the names of all
the bands that had played for the dance
during the sober thirties. To find out
who they were, we dragged out our old
files and set to work. We turned up
such names as Glen Gray, Art Kassel,
Red Norvo, and mike mley, but we
couldn't find oul the name of the band
which played at the first dance in 1930.
The April, 1930, issue had a page and
a half devoted to describing who was
there, what they said, and why, but not
even one little word about the music.
At the time we swore that in our April
issue we would give the name of the
band.
And so, for the benefit of future
Technic staffs, we here record that
music for the Tenth Annual Slide Rule
Ball was provided by Vincent Lopez
and his Orchestra.

author
Harold M. Harrison, "Functions"
author for this month, has had a com-
prehensive career in the field of his
article, although his present official title
is Factory Superintendent for Vultee
Aircraft. Raised in Detroit, young
Harrison made his first contact with
the aviation industry when one of the
Curtiss brothers built a pusher type bi-
plane in the family barn. When four-
teen, he became an apprentice toolmaker
and machinist, and while learning his
trade attended night classes and high
school for a year to prepare for entering
the University of Michigan. The college
activity which today gives Mr. Harrison
the greatest feeling of pride was wash-
ing pots and pans to help with his ex-
penses.

Vuttmr

Curtiss used his barn.
After receiving his bachelors degree in
Aeronautical Engineering, he went to
work as stress analyst for Spartan Air-
craft, then took a shop survey course
at Boeing, where he subsequently served
as stress analyst, shop liaison and engi-
neering co-ordinator. From Boeing he
went to the Glenn L. Martin Company,
and from Martin to Vultee. Some of
his more important design work has
been incorporated in the Boeing 314
flying boat and in Martin seaplanes.
banquet
The annual staff banquet was held at
the League March 8. Following the sat-
isfaction of gastronomic desires, several
of the staff and the faculty gave short
talks. Then Dean Joe Bursley remin-
isced in a rambling fashion for a while
on his and the engineering school's early
years.
Not that it makes any difference now,
but our college did originate as an off-
shoot of the literary school. The first
classes were held in the South wing of
University Hall. When engineering was
made a separate department, it was
moved to a former professor's house on
the site of the Clements Library. Burs-
ley was registered as number two in the
new department, but number one quit,
so our Dean of Students was the first
engineer to graduate from Michigan.
At that time Seniors were required
to write theses before graduating, so Joe
and a partner decided to study locomo-
tives. After two tries they found a rail-
road company that would let them ride
along on the regular trips, sitting out
next the boiler over the cylinders. Thusly
they spent spring vacation taking indi-
cator diagrams, writing up the report on
their return. After graduation Bursley
got a job with that same company, and
did much of the same type of neck-
risking work. The first Michigan engi-
neer on his first job was paid exactly
nine cents per hour.
One Hallowe'en during Bursley"s un-
dergraduate years, it became necessary
to have a fire. Perhaps it was an early
winter or something. The campus board-
walk along East University furnished
adequate kindling, but a satisfactory
blaze was not achieved till an Ann Ar-
bor street car had been sacrificed. One
wonders how such wanton destruction of
property was ever possible. Joe himself
gives the answer: the University then
had no Dean of Students.

George H. Hanson, '39E, was one of
the six men awarded Tau Beta Pi Fel-
lowships this year. The award carries
with it a stipend of $650 and it is the
first time in a number of years that
any member of the University of Mich-
igan Chapter has been so honored.
George, who is known to his friends
as the Alpena Flash, has been 100 per
cent self-supporting throughout his four
years at Michigan, and he has still been
able to maintain an average that looks
down on the 3.9 mark. In addition he
has been Treasurer of A. I. Ch. E., Cata-
loguer of Tau Beta Pi, Program Chair-
man, Social Chairman, and Vice Presi-
dent of the Lutheran Student Club, and
a member of the Slide Rule Ball Com-
mittee. Because a coin came down wrong
side up, George is not the Senior Class
Secretary. Last year he held the Man-
delbaum Scholarship. In addition to
Tau Beta Pi, George belongs to Phi

teaching classes in Aero 2, 6, and ad-
vanced courses in aerodynamics and air-
plane performance, Professor Thomp-
son, unofficially known as Tommy, is a
youngish-looking man with a likeable
personality and an interest in his work.
Born and raised in Grand Rapids,
Michigan, Professor Thompson started
his college career at Grand Rapids Jun-
ior College, came to Michigan in 1923,
where he got his B.S. in Aeronautical
Engineering in '25, and his Master's in
'26. Between '23 and '26 he was an
assistant in the Aero Department, chief
of a surveying party, and a consulting
engineer. From 1926 to 1928, he acted
as an engineering math instructor here.
In 1928 he received a two-year Guggen-
heim Fellowship in Aeronautics and
traveled to Warsaw, Poland to study
and collect another degree.
While in Poland he of necessity learned
the Polish language well, liked it, but
found it had its complications. One eve-
ning he confidently ordered three scram-
bled eggs. Something slipped in his
grammar, for he soon found himself be-
ing stoically served three separate orders
of three eggs apiece.
After Warsaw it was back to Michi-
gan again as an Assistant Professor in
Aeronautical Engineering. Since then
Professor Thompson has written numer-
ous technical articles, and cooperated
with Professor Dodge of the E. M. De-
partment in writing "Fluid Mechanics,"
the present text for E.M. 4. At present
he is actively engaged in research in
theoretical aerodynamics.
Professor Thompson believes the young
engineer's immediate prospects to b?
much the same as in previous years,
which means fairly good. However, if
the talk about aeronautical expansion in
the Army and Navy materializes, he is
sure there will be a considerable im-
provement.
Prof. Thompson is a member of Tau
Beta Pi, Sigma Xi, the Society for Pro-
motion of Engineering Education, an
Associate Fellow in the Institute of
Aeronautical Sciences and honorary
chairman of the Michigan Student
Branch, plus being affiliated with many
other similar groups. The proud father
of five-year-old Richard Thompson,
"Tommy" spends his spare time taking
moving pictures of his family, and hob-
bying at woodworking and cooking. The
last is definitely encouraged by Mrs.
Thompson who finds it quite convenient
of a Sunday morning. If his cooking is
as thorough as his teaching we can see
her point.
dick tarbell
The Technic again draws on its own
staff for another of the "Men of the
Month." This time it is the man who
has handled the purse strings for the
past year, the Business Manager him-
self, Dick Tarbell. Dick is one of that
vast New York contingent, a native son
of that populous metropolis, Kenmore.
For the benefit of the uninitiated, Buf-
falo is a suburb of Kenmore.
During his first year's struggle with
our bureaucratic institution of higher
learning, Richard G. went the way of all
good freshmen engineers and went out
for Sigma Rho Tau. He thought better
of it, though, and turned to the Tech-
nic. Second year, Dick swallowed the
fraternity bait; S.A.E. was the house he
decided to grace with his presence. Being
bitten by the "joining" bug he also
added A.S.M.E. to his list of activities.
The past two years he has been
equally busy. Last year Dick was Pub-
licity Chairman of the Slide Rule Ball:
this year he is Financial Chairman. Too,
this year Vulcans decided that he was
worthy of a mud bath.
Last fall Tarbell was one of the two
men chosen to represent the Technic
at the annual E.C.M.A. convention held
this time at M.I.T. Dick was in one of
those rare spending moods and decided
that since Technic staff members were

which they did, arriving back in A2 just
in time for the kickoff of the Illinois
football game.
Upon graduation this June Dick in-
tends to receive a B.S. degree in Me-
chanical Engineering. His plans after
graduation are rather vague at this
time, but he feels sure that it will be
some sort of work in Production En-
gineering. His experience in business
from the Technic and his training as
an engineer should serve him well in his
chosen field.
Dick certainly is an example of a
"mighty mite." Although small of
stature, he has a vitalic and business-
like way about him that at first is quite
surprising. His financial management
of the Technic is a good example of
the results of this nature. His co-
workers almost hate to see him ap-
proach, for he is almost certain to be on
another of his cost-cutting campaigns,
another indication of the future success-
ful business man.
bob may
This is another in the "local boy"
series, for Robert Franklin May was
born in the town of Ann Arbor, Mich-
igan, and long enough ago to make him
today a member of the class of '39. The
years from birth to high school passed
quite uneventfully; at one time during
this period Bob did intend to become
an aviator, but later on this interest was
superseded by one in radio. At Univer-
sity High, Robert exercised his muscles
on the swimming team and his voice in
the Glee Club and Senior Play. He be-
longed to the Radio Club and made
himself well enough known to be today
Chairman of the Alumni Association.
Finally, he says, he was interested in
studying.
Graduating from high school, Bob
followed his radio interest across South
University Avenue to an Electrical
course in the Engineering School. While
a freshman, his main activity was study-
ing, which he did enough of to become
a member of Phi Eta Sigma. That sum-
mer he worked as junior councilor at a
boys' camp on Burt Lake.
As a sophomore, May was occupied
chiefly by his books and his hamming—
call letters W8LCH. This experience,
together with a little study, fortified him
for an attempt at commercial operation
the following summer. He went to
Cleveland to look for a job as radio op-
erator on a lake freighter, and was about
to give it up after several discourage-
ments, when he was hired by a company
whose boats regularly docked at Chi-
cago, where (fortunately for Bob) there
happened to be some labor trouble which
had caused the rerouting of the freight.
Another lucky break came when he
found on the boat a fellow who was able
to teach him most of the many things
he did not know about the job.
Evidently the three months on the
freighter had some influence on Bob,
for he suddenly became much more in-
terested in "activities." He was social
chairman of Congress, class vice-presi-
dent, and president of the Eta Kappa
Nu, and was elected to membership in
Vulcans and Tau Beta Pi. This year,
Bob has continued by serving on the
Men's Council and the Slide Rule Ball
Committee, acting as executive secretary
of Congress, and being elected to Phi
Kappa Phi. Meanwhile, Bob's voca-
tional objectives have expanded, and
when he has received his B.S. degree in
Electrical Engineering this June, he in-
tends to take another walk across the
campus, this time to the Business Ad
School, where he will receive additional
preparation for some future job in in-
dustrial or personnel management.

power system calculator
Until comparatively recently, calcula-
tions of necessary facilities for carrying
certain power loads were more or less in-
accurate estimates. During the last nine
years, however, a mechanical calculator
has been developed which gives results
with far greater precision. Through use
of this device several cases have been
discovered where unnecessary duplica-
tion of equipment was set up to handle
estimated peak loads.
The ''alternating current network cal-
culator" consists essentially of a laby-
rinth of coils and capacitors which can
be hooked together so as to duplicate in
all its characteristics a system of any
size or complexity. The original purpose
of the calculator was the investigation of
system problems involving voltage reg-
ulation, stability, and loading of equip-
ment. Since then, many new operating
problems have developed. Among these,
transients enduring but a few thou-
sandths of a second have been trapped
and analyzed, even to lightning disturb-
ance. The device has been used in de-
signing power systems at Boulder Dam,
Bonneville, and several other federal
projects, and analyses have been made
of over two hundred separate systems in
this country and Europe.
line down
Students who studied by candle light
and picked their way down darkened
streets during last month's ice storm
may be interested in an explanation of
how such a storm causes much of its
principal damage, namely, the breakage
of transmission lines. These ruptures are
OIQ5
not caused primarily by the weight of
the ice itself.
The usual storm divides itself into
three periods. The first is characterized
by moderate winds, falling temperature,
and precipitation. The wires are coated
with ice. In the second stage, the wind
drops off and there is a rise in tempera-
ture, sufficient to cause some melting.
Finally, there is another drop in temp-
erature, with strong winds. The action
of the wind on the partially melted ice
coating causes it to take on an
elliptical shape, which then becomes
solid. Any slight vertical motion by the
wire is, due to this non-circular shape,
enhanced by a horizontal wind. Thus,
if the wire is running upwards, the wind
force tends to move it further upwards,
and if the wire is moving downwards,
the force tends to move it further down-
wards. This results in a resonant condi-
tion, with the wire vibrating at its nat-
ural frequency, and, if the wind is strong
enough, the final outcome is rupture.
relaxing steel
The theory of elasticity, today the
basis for the teaching of all engineering
design, may become inadequate, due to
a new importance of the tendency for
a metal to become permanently de-
formed under continuous loads.
Slight deformation, or "creep," over
a long period of time would seem to
imply a lessening of strength, or "relax-
ation." Experimental results confirm
this relationship. "Creep" is found by
simply applying a stress and measuring
the deformation. "Relaxation" is com-
puted by means of a device which, with
sensitive electric contacts, automatically
reduces the load every time the sample
creeps two millionths of an inch, thus
keeping the length practically constant.
"Relaxation," of growing importance
today, has not been exceedingly impor-
tant in the past, because it becomes sig-
nificantly great only at high tempera-
tures, and it is only recently that we
have been constructing machines to
operate at those temperatures. For
example, it is calculated that copper
will relax 37 per cent in 20 years at 77
degrees Fahrenheit, and 90 per cent in
the same period at 350 degrees. Steel
will relax 60 per cent from a stress of
11,750 pounds at 859 degrees, in 20
years. When we consider that modern
steam turbines often operate at tempera-
tures higher than 1,000 degrees Fahren-
heit, the importance of these figures be-
comes apparent.
freighter
A need for transportation of large
quantities of liquid caustic soda for the
rayon industry has resulted in the con-
struction of a freighter especially built
for that purpose, incorporating many
new features. Christened "Dolomite 4,"
the new boat is about 4,300 feet long,
has a beam of 43 feet, 4 inches, a
moulded depth of 20 feet, a draught of
16 or 10 feet for full or half cargo, and
a capacity of 4,000 tons.
All the fabrication was done by weld-
ing; she has no rivets. The main struc-
ture is made of cold-bent, electrically
welded steel channels or U-beams. The
hull was fabricated by welding rolled
channels, 18 inches wide, and then but-
ting them against each other, flange to
flange, and arc welding inside and out.
There are five cargo holds, each lined
with sheet nickel, which was spot-welded
to the bulkheads and arc-welded at the
seams.
The ship is powered by two 720-
horsepower Diesel engines, giving a
maximum speed of 15 miles per hour.
In addition, she is equipped with nickel-
lined pumping equiment for discharging
cargo and a special boiler to provide
steam for cleaning purposes. Although
planned for transporting rayon quality
liquid caustic, the new ship made her
first trips on the Great Lakes, carrying
kerosene and gasoline. Now she is serv-
ing alkali consumers on the Atlantic
coast.

the distance A-C, or h, must be greater

puted as follows: the tangent to the
elastic curve is given by the expression
dx/dy. At the point where the column
is bunt in, the tangent is xl/l. Thus, the
problem resolves itself in finding h as a

It appears from Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b
that V is of necessity somewhat smaller
than P, the former being only the ver-
tical component of the latter. The rela-
tionship between V and P depends on
the magnitude of the deflection when
buckling occurs. From this it follows
that, under a loading as represented by
Fig. 3, the vertical component V being
held constant, the load P would pro-
gressively increase as the deflection in-
creases. Thus, once the process of
buckling commences, the column will
continue to deform until it is destroyed.
At the instant buckling commences
(which is the instant we are essentially
interested in), P = V; and the dash line
A-C coincides with the vertical through

final choice is the soundest after choos-
ing riveting, welding, bolting, glu-
ing, or some other method available.
Designers are not always happy
people, because, while they are always
striving for perfection in the design of
projects, the very nature of design pre-
cludes any possibility of achieving per-
fection. Having chosen a type of design
for any certain project, it is usually
essential to carry it through to com-
pletion without changing horses in mid-
stream. As a design of a type of con-
struction advances, certain features
develop which may indicate that an
alternative type of construction would
have been a better one. At this stage the
enthusiasm is at a low ebb, and a de-
signer must brace himself against
The Best

WILD'S
brooding and make the best of the
situation unless time permits revamping
to incorporate a different type of basic
design. These occurrences are common,
and experience develops a mental
resistance and courage to keep the
job going in spite of the realization
that a better job could have been done
had another choice of basic type of con-
struction been made. Efforts to achieve
perfection are frustrated, which condi-
tion is not conducive to a happy mind.
The designer's task is to aid his organ-
ization to meet competition and to do
so "by making a better mouse trap."
The best sales force in the world cannot
continually lead the public to believe
that they are purchasing the best prod-
uct for their dollars unless it is truth-
fully the case. The designer must
see that it is the case.
Reasonably successful completion of
a few projects establishes sufficient rep-
utation for a designer so that he is given
responsibility in directing the efforts of
his fellow designers; he becomes a boss.
At this stage he realizes that, to advance
in his field, there are many attributes
that he must develop in himself, if he
does not already possess them. He
should not expect always to have a bet-
ter idea on a subject than his subordi-
nates, but should be able to digest rap-
idly any features of a problem as set

forth, to recognize and pool the best
ideas, and to arrive at a sound, logical
conclusion. He has taken his first step
toward higher promotion and maybe
eventually the front office. He begins to
meet more people outside his own organ-
ization and develops a better business
front than normally retained by men on
the board who at times lose their self-
assurance in meeting and speaking to
strange groups of people. Design engi-
neers engrossed in detail problems lose
touch with the world outside their
organization; that is, they have their
"noses on the board." An aggressive
personality may deteriorate, but a re-
juvenation is experienced after pro-
motions begin to come. It is obvious
then that opportunities to obtain man-
agement positions usually come more
slowly to design engineers than to per-
sonnel more directly connected in the
beginning with the front office and the
public.
Designers sometimes lament the fact
that due credit is not given them for the
product of their company, but is usurped
more or less by other individuals. Ulti-
mately, due credit is afforded; but one
must never be too reticent about gain-
ing favor for his own ideas and achieve-
ments, however. A case recently vexed
a fellow designer who had taken a vital
part in the design of a great airplane.
A squadron of these had been flown on
a history-making trip to a neighboring
continent to establish unpredictable rec-
ords. This fellow designer was invited
to a banquet in honor of the squadron
flight leaders who did a great job of
their own in leading the expedition.
Speeches and ovations dealt entirely
with the high class personnel of the
flight crews; but, much to the vexation
of the designer, no mention was ever
made of the great job done in conceiv-
ing and building the objects which were
flown on the expedition and which ren-
dered possible its success. Designers
must rise above this feeling and realize
that credit is being given to them indi-
rectly if the users of the equipment they
design are hailed for achievements ac-
complished with it.
Next month, "Administration," by J. W.
Kushing, '25E, Vice President in Charge of
Engineering of the Highway Steel Products
Company, will conclude our series of eight
articles on the functions of the engineer.

THERE IS QUALITY in water. Some com-
munities enjoy water that is a delight to
behold and an exhilaration to drink —
clear, sparkling and utterly refreshing.
Others, while meeting sanitation and
health requirements, serve water that is
unappealing and unpalatable.
Admittedly, natural sources of supply
have a definite bearing on the original
character of a city's water. But they need
not be the determining factor in its final
quality. Foremost among the means
of greatly improving municipal water
in taste, color and odor is the modern
use of charcoal—or, as it is technically
termed, activated carbon — a develop-

ment of prime importance among the
more than three hundred Dow products.
As is well known, activated carbon has
a high adsorptive power. Due to its in-
tense cellular structure, it offers a great
surface area which attracts and holds
foreign matter and thus eliminates objec-
tionable tastes and odors.
Production of activated carbon for
these purposes is a matter of high techni-
cal concern. From the characteristics of
wood varieties, down through methods of
processing, quality depends on research,
methods of production, and close control.
Through its subsidiary, the Cliffs Dow
Chemical Company of Marquette, Michi-
gan, Dow produces a variety of activated
carbons marketed under the trade name,
Cliffchar. Each is processed to meet the
specific requirements of its uses. Thus,
in still another field, Dow's broad expe-
rience in chemistry and its leadership in
chemical production are evidenced.

A metallurgical laboratory view showing stress-rupture equip-
ment in front and creep equipment in rear. This is a part of
forty-four units, twenty-two for each purpose, which are in
continuous operation in connection with the development of
materials for elevated temperature applications.
In the stress-rupture equipment the test specimens are strained
under definite stress conditions until fracture occurs. From the
stresstime-to-fracture data obtained in relatively short periods of
time it is possible to predict the extended times before fracture
would occur at the given temperature for reduced stresses. The
creep equipment makes possible the determination of the rate
of distortion due to a given load. The test specimen is not
fractured.
This equipment is a part of that which is used on those metal-
lurgical researches involving the development of steels and other
materials for structures subjected to high temperature.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


thoughts on engineering and affili-
ated subjects are more sincere, and
whose opinions are more universally re-
spected than Dean Emeritus Mortimer
E. Cooley of the University of Michi-
gan's College of Engineering. It is he
who was so largely instrumental in
building Michigan's Engineering College
from a department of the Literary Col-
lege to its present high standing among
the engineering colleges of the world.
Dean Cooley started life on a west-
ern New York farm. At sixteen he had
seen one show, Uncle Tom's Cabin,
possessed $3.65, was a teacher in a
country school, and had started to save
money to enter Canandaigua Academy.
However, he became interested in the
Mechanical Engineering course offered
at the U. S. Naval Academy, and de-
cided to try for it. He passed the en-
trance exams and in 1878 graduated
seventh in his class.
He then shipped as a Cadet Engineer,
saw considerable of the world, and
gained a lot of practical experience. In
1881 the Navy Department, author-
ized by an Act of Congress in 1879, de-
tailed him as "Professor of Steam
Engineering and Iron Shipbuilding" to
the University of Michigan. Thus he
became a professor at 26, and still holds
the distinction of having been the
youngest full professor at Michigan. At
the end of four years, the University in-
vited him to stay and the Navy ac-
cepted his resignation.
In taking this assignment, Dean
Cooley was working in a new field. He
grew with it and helped it to grow. On
the death, in 1903, of that remarkable
teacher Charles E. Greene, whose grad-
uates achieved high places in civil engi-
neering, he accepted the Deanship of
the College of Engineering, and con-
tinued in this capacity until 1928, when
he retired to his home on Hill Street
with the ultimate satisfaction of a job
exceedingly well done, and the affection
and loyalty of thousands of engineers,
his pupils and friends, the world over.
His policy at all times has been con-
servative and thoughtful. He never
adopted new measures rashly, but
always weighed ideas carefully to dis-
cern their true value. Naturally his
work has been constructive, and the
present College of Engineering is only
one of the concrete examples of his abil-
ity—living tributes to his efforts.
It would be futile to attempt to list
here his many accomplishments and to
recognize the many honors bestowed
upon him; the March, 1935, Technic
took three pages to summarize them.
Our purpose this time is not to eulogize,
but to present the Dean's most ardent
argument as he gave it to us one Sat-
urday afternoon recently. We spent a
full three hours at it; he has spent
thirty years. We only hope that we may
give you the bare essence of it all in
the following few paragraphs.
For the past thirty years, Dean
Cooley has been striving for one pur-
pose, which he regards as the most im-
portant objective in engineering educa-

tion today—to lengthen and broaden
the curriculum in order to give the engi-
neer a well rounded professional educa-
tion. As we took chairs around his
famous hearth, the Dean put another
log on the fire, lighted a cigar, and be-
gan to discuss his favorite subject.
Dean Cooley first realized the great
lack in the engineer's training when he
was accosted by a prominent employer
of engineers a few years before the War.
"What's the matter with you educa-
tors?'' this industrialist had asked. "I
have sixty or seventy graduates of lead-
ing engineering schools and they're all
the same—good engineers—fine special-
ists—but they don't know another

to say that what he and other indus-
trialists wanted was not such one-track
individuals who might be worth a salary
of from $2,500 to $3,000, but rather
engineers with a broad education who
might develop into leaders worth
$25,000. "And they can't get that with
just a technical training," he said.
This criticism started Dean Cooley
on his crusade for a longer and broader
engineering education, and today he is
just as thoroughly convinced he is right
as ever. In fact, he believes the need is
becoming greater as our profession
grows in importance and its responsi-
bilities increase.
"Look at the professional schools on
this campus, and how they have de-
veloped their curricula," the Dean said
pointedly. "When I came to Michigan
in 1881, the law course was two years
of five months each, as was the medi-
cal course. Today the legal and medical
professions have developed programs of
from six to nine years, in which general,
liberal courses are given as well as the
technical work, so that the graduate is
equipped not only to practice his pro-
fession, but to get more out of life."
The same trend is operating in the
other professions. Dentistry, architec-
ture, and forestry have all lengthened
their programs. Yet engineering, a
vital profession in our technological age,
continues to try to turn out professional
engineers in four years.
The four year program, Dean Cooley
pointed out, has only been maintained
in the face of technical progress by
steadily changing its nature. Originally,
lit,


"When I came to Michigan the law course
was two years."
the four year engineering course con-
tained only a year and a half or so of
technical work. The remainder was of
necessity from the more general literary
courses. As more and more technical
material was added, the liberal courses
by
RICHARD M. ADAMS '40E
HARRY REED '40E
were gradually dropped with the result
that today the curriculum is woefully
unbalanced. The training which the
young engineer receives at present is
preparing him to be a specialist, a tech-
nician, rather than an educated profes-
sional man.
At this point, the Dean digressed for
a moment to make one point clear. "I
make no apologies for the engineering
graduate of today. He is a fine techni-
cal man, and sincerely loves his profes-
sion and his work. But it is this very
interest which, so centered upon his
work, often blinds the young engineer
to other vital needs in his education."
The engineer, in too many cases,
lacks a basis of mutual interest with
others because he has not had the
broader education which would give him
such common interests. This has led,
Dean Cooley believes, to what he calls
the "hired man attitude" toward engi-
neers.
This attitude was brought forcibly to
the Dean's attention during his cam-
paign for the Senate in 1924. His
speeches stressed the need of having
engineers in Congress in order to deal
intelligently with public works, utilities,
and the wide variety of other national
problems which might profitably be ap-
proached from an engineering point of
view. Constantly, however, he met with
the "hired man" attitude towards the
professional engineer. One leading
statesman for instance, asked, "Why
should we elect engineers to public of-
fice? When we need engineers we can
hire them."
Much the same position is taken by
a great many business men. It is com-
monplace in the industrial world to
find that an engineer has worked out a
new process or conceived a new inven-
tion, only to have someone else step in
and reap the profits. The engineer again
gets the "hired man's" pay, despite the

SINCE internal combustion engines
first were used in transportation,
engineers have been searching for an
adequate solution to the problem of ob-
taining high starting and accelerating
power from those engines which inher-
ently have no power in starting and
develop maximum power only at high
speeds.
The conventional geared transmission
and friction clutch system is at best
only a compromise solution. Its chief
disadvantages are: 1) smooth operation
of the clutch requires considerable skill,
and poor operation results in severe
shock loads on engine and axles; 2)
about fifty per cent of the time spent
in accelerating from a standstill is spent
in changing gears when no power is be-
ing delivered to the wheels: 3) accelera-
tion in low gear is often too rapid for
the comfort of the passengers, partic-
ularly in busses where people may be
standing; 4) the gear system itself is
noisy, and invites the operator to make
still more noise by racing the engine;
5) constantly changing the speed of
the engine is detrimental to engine life
and economy; 6) efficiency is seriously
reduced by the conversion of energy
into heat in the clutch.
Recently two systems have been re-
leased for production which promise at
least a partial solution to many of the
difficulties. Both of these systems are
hydraulic, and both are variously re-
ferred to as the "fluid flywheel", "oil
clutch", or "hydraulic transmission".
However, there is a distinct difference
in their operation. The one properly
called by the first two names above re-
places the clutch and the flywheel of
the engine and has the function of a
clutch only. The other is a true
hydraulic transmission and replaces the
complete transmission and clutch.
The introduction of the hydraulic
clutch on the 1939 Chrysler Imperial is
an accomplishment not so much in the
development of the clutch itself as in
the welded sheet metal design and pro-
duction methods that brought its price
within reach of the passenger car buyer.
The clutch has been used in expensive
European cars for several years.
The hydraulic clutch depends on the
fact that modern engines have enough
power to start a car in high gear if a
clutch is provided which is perfectly
smooth and which is not damaged by
any amount of "slipping". By answer-
ing these conditions this clutch allows
the driver to use high gear almost con-
stantly, except on hills. The clutch
pedal is used only in changing from for-
ward to reverse. Ordinarily the car is
not shifted into neutral on stopping
since the clutch depends on centrifugal
force for its operation, and this is not
sufficient at idling engine speeds to
cause any motion of the car. The car is
then started by depressing the acceler-

ator pedal and stopped by releasing the
pedal and applying the brake. The re-
duction in driving skill required with
this system is readily appreciated.
A car with the hydraulic clutch starts
perfectly smoothly from a stop and
gains speed steadily. If car A with the
conventional three gear positions and
car B with only high gear and the
hydraulic clutch were to start from a
standstill together. A would at first
"step out" much faster, but on shifting
into second would lose ground. Before
A had shifted to high, B probably would
have passed it and would reach full
speed sooner. At the same time pass-
engers in A would be subject to neck-
twisting and discomfort, while those in
B would be conscious only of a smooth,
even start.
Mechanically the clutch consists of
two moving parts, the impeller and the
rotor. The impeller is in effect a centri-
fugal pump driven by the engine which
circulates oil through blades in the rotor.
The rotor is connected by the transmis-
sion to the drive shaft. The oil striking
the blades sets up in them a force, vary-
ing with the engine speed, which causes
the rotor to turn with the impeller. At
idling speeds this force is not sufficient
to move the car at all, and at slightly
higher speeds will cause it to creep
ahead very slowly. If the throttle is
opened wide, the car will accelerate rap-
idly under full power of the engine,
though the engine will not race because
of resistance in the clutch. The clutch,
with its fluid content, revolves as a
unit. It is heavy enough to replace the
flywheel of the engine, so it is bolted
directly to the crankshaft.
The hydraulic clutch, then, answers
many of the problems outlined in the
second paragraph, but introduces the
disadvantage of having little power
available for starting—no more than
the ordinary car in high gear. Since the
whole unit turns, it is theoretically im-
possible to multiply torque with this de-
vice. For torque multiplication, such as
is provided by the conventional trans-
mission in low gear, a stationary ex-
ternal reaction member is necessary.
The hydraulic transmission intro-
duced in the General Motors Yellow
Coach provides for torque multiplica-
tion by adding to the two units of the
clutch a stationary casing bolted to the
crankcase or frame. This fixed reaction
member contains two rows of internal
blades, which are placed between three
rows of blades on the rotor. This gives
a small three-stage turbine, driven by
oil circulated centrifugally by the im-
peller. According to fundamental turbine
principles, the force on the rotor will
always decrease as its speed increases,
if the fluid is circulated at a constant
rate. Thus at a standstill the torque de-
lived by the turbine to the drive shaft
is five times that of the engine, while at
road speeds the two are equal. This is
the same effect as shifting from low to
high gear except that the change is per-
fectly gradual.
To increase the efficiency of this
transmission, it is made a part of the in-
genious system shown in figure 1. In
starting position, as shown, power is
transmitted from the shaft at the left
through a simple friction clutch to the
impeller of the turbine. The rotor of the
turbine then drives the angular gearing
which is used in rear engine busses to
lead to the axle. A shaft driven by the
engine also extends through the hollow
shaft holding the turbine to the direct
drive clutch. When the bus reaches
road speed, the speeds of the inner and
outer shafts become equal and a simple
automatic mechanism engages the di-
rect drive clutch and releases the tur-
bine. The turbine coasts to a stop, leav-
ing only a single shaft revolving, and
eliminating efficiency losses from oil
churning. An over-running or "free-
wheeling" clutch between the turbine
and the angular gearing prevents the
turbine being driven from that end. The
reverse gearing is located on the axle
side of the turbine, so that in reverse
the turbine operates exactly as in for-
ward motion.
The fluid used in both these systems,
incidentally, is not a heavy oil, but
about eighty per cent kerosene and the
remainder light oil. This combination
has been found by experiment to give
least friction without a tendency to leak
badly.
The hydraulic transmission is unques-
tionably the best solution yet found for
the transmission problem. It gives high
starting power and uninterrupted accel-
eration, and allows the engine to oper-
ate near its most efficient speed most of
the time. It is impossible to produce a
rough start no matter how carelessly the
vehicle is started. This feature reduces
wear and tear on both vehicle and pass-
engers, and relieves many of the driver's
troubles. "Like taking a day off," one
driver said after trying one of the new
busses.
The noise connected with busses in
cities is very materially reduced with
this transmission. Efficiency obtained
with this system was determined by
elaborate tests to be equal to that of
any other system now in use.
One important advantage of this sys-
tem is found in the increased opportun-
ity it offers for the use of the Diesel
engine. These engines need to be run
for best results at a nearly constant
speed. The hydraulic transmission
makes it more nearly possible to run
them at this ideal condition than any
other system and may mean a great in-
crease in the use of Diesels in bus and
truck service.
It is unlikely, however, that the
hydraulic transmission will be avail-
able on passenger cars in the near
future. It is still much too expensive for
anything but commercial service. It is
entirely possible, however, that modi-
fications such as the hydraulic clutch
may appear in the lower price ranges
within a year or two.

Vice-President in Charge of Engineering

THE engineering student, as he con-
templates his professional life, is in-
terested in what phases or activities of
business his training will lead him into.
Today the field of service in engineering
is divided into many specialized fields.
Which particular field the engineer en-
ters and progresses in will depend upon
his own inclinations, ability, and train-
ing. In whatever field or capacity he
may start, he will find that always the
skilled man directs and initiates the
work for the less skilled. Even though
his first position may be that of a
draftsman, he will make pencil draw-
ings only, while less skilled workers
will trace his drawings and make blue
prints.
If he succeeds, he will in some meas-
ure be required to handle problems of
management and administration. Be-
cause of this fact, it is rather difficult
to classify administration as a separate
field, as research, consulting practice,
production, and sales were separated.
It is true that we have a separate
branch dealing with management classi-
fied as "Industrial Engineering," yet it
is only a part of administration.
Although the field of administration
or executive control may overlap other
fields of endeavor in engineering, per-
haps we can consider it as a separate
branch and examine its opportunities.
In the laboratory, field, office, or
plant the young engineer will soon be
given a position of subordinate author-
ity, which begins his activities in the
field of administration or managerial
control. Whether he will rise to accept
the larger managerial opportunities
which are likely to open to him will de-
pend upon his executive ability. Al-
though it is not the purpose to discuss
what is expected of the young engineer
but rather what he may expect in the
field of administration, it must be em-
phasized that he must possess certain

human characteristics to succeed in this
particular field. He must possess ex-
uberant energy, a keen mind of high in-
tellectual capacity, together with a
pleasing personality and a high moral
integrity.
These are not the words of an ideal-
ist, but the qualities which were used
to describe applicants to the Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation fellowships in busi-
ness administration. Such attributes are,

proficiency, as reported by Erwin H.
Schell in Nations Business for Decem-
ber, 1938.
The engineer who is thoroughly con-
vinced of the necessity of these char-
acteristics, and makes a definite effort
to acquire them will rise high in the
field of administration. The engineer
should realize that ability to manage
cannot be acquired without practice.
Study of the subject is valuable, but
without practice he will never acquire
cussed the divisions of organization in
which the young engineer develops his
ability as an executive. As he develops
this ability, he will find that he is al-
ways confronted with the problems of
men, money, methods, materials, and
markets. And, therefore, the type and
kind of work he will perform in admin-
istrative work will depend upon his
natural aptitude towards these various
problems. It is not possible to discuss
the various positions which the young
engineer can hope to fill as he rises from
bilities of General Manager to Presi-
dent.
It should be very encouraging that
never before in the history of business
has there been a greater field of oppor-
tunity for the young engineer with the
proper requisites in the field of admin-
istration of industry and government.
Business and governmental leaders are
recognizing the fact that the develop-
ment of good-will and a closer em-
ployee-employer relationship is more
genuinely sponsored by young men—■

the correlated aptitudes which are nec-
essary to successful performance as an
executive.
Whether the engineer has specialized
in a branch of engineering such as civil,
chemical, mechanical, or electrical will
make little difference as to the oppor-
tunities which are open to him in the
administrative field. Such specialization
only serves to define the field of work
in which he will endeavor to rise to
greater responsibilities. Previous writ-
ers in this series of articles on "The
Functions of the Engineer" have dis-
minor to major responsibilities in man-
agerial control. Most undergraduate
engineers are acquainted with the or-
ganization of industrial and govern-
mental activities today. Any organiza-
tion chart will show the various posi-
tions—from Sales Engineer to Sales
Manager, from Time Study Man to Di-
rector of Industrial Relations, from
Draftsman to Chief Engineer, or from
Storekeeper to Financial Manager—
which are open to the young engineer.
And then, of course, from these posi-
tions come the higher major responsi-
free of old-time prejudices. Modern
engineering colleges, recognizing this
new field of endeavor, include a number
of courses in their curricula which cover
the important phases of management
and administration. The young engineer
who aspires to this field need not worry
about the opportunities ahead. To be
sure, he cannot hope to take over the
positions of major responsibility until
he has acquired the fundamental requi-
sites. But, surely, as he develops, the
opportunities will always be present.
And it is not unusual today to find men

responsibilities of leadership and admin-
istration.
It is easily understood that these
young men were not appointed to such
positions of responsibility until they
had demonstrated that they possessed
a thorough working knowledge of the
principles of management.
It is, therefore, important that the
young engineer have an understanding
of the relationship of the responsibilities
of his position to the co-ordinated plan
of organization. This is particularly im-
portant to an engineer who desires to
succeed in the field of administration.
Any position of responsibility, even
though minor, is of great importance to
the young engineer in his development
as an executive, and, conversely, it is
equally important to those who have
placed upon him that responsibility.
When the first position of minor
authority in the chain of command of
an organization has been given to an
individual, he begins to experience his
first practice of the principles of man-
agement. The importance of this posi-
tion to him depends entirely upon him-
self. If he can acquire an understanding
of the relationship of his responsibilities
to the whole scheme of the organization,
and if he in turn can show ability to
manage his assistants, then he can be
sure of promotion to positions of higher
responsibility. Although it be a minor
trust, the young engineer should attach
a great amount of importance to his first
position.
The remuneration that the young
This is the concluding article in a
series of eight designed to help the
young engineer make an intelligent
decision regarding the type of work
he wishes to follow. It has been the
purpose of the articles to explain what
the engineer could expect from in-
dustry in each of the functional types
considered.
In conjunction with the concluding
article we present a very brief resume
of the other side of the picture.

what industry is looking for in return
for what it offers.

that the nine articles can be of im-

their future.
engineer will receive is of minor im-
portance in his first few years if he is
in a position of responsibility commen-
surate with his ability. The compensa-
tion will be in proportion to his respon-
sibilities. Fortunately, today, leading
successful organizations do pay men in
responsible positions salaries which en-
able the recipients to lead a "better
than average" civil life.
The position of responsibility and
the place in society to which the young
engineer may aspire, depend entirely
upon the standards which he sets for
himself. The standards for each indi-
vidual will be determined by his own
characteristics and the environment in
which he lives. To be sure, these stand-
ards do not stay fixed. As the young
engineer increases his acquaintance with
greater opportunities and different
phases of social life, so will his stand-
ards change.
To one who aspires to the field of ad-
ministration as an engineer, it is easy to
predict an interesting future, one which
holds opportunities unlimited in indus-
trial or governmental affairs.

TO write with a great deal of exact-
ness on what business expects of the
college graduate is a little difficult, be-
cause the term "business" covers such a
large variety of operations. Therefore,
anything that I may tell you has to be
taken as one man's opinion, built up
through the years of a particular ex-
perience. I do believe, however, that in
a broad way the requirements of one
type of business are much the same as
those of another.
To my mind, your training is largely
of importance in what it has done to
your character. All of us are salesmen,
whether we know it or not and whether
or not we have anything to do with that
section of business ordinarily known as
the sales department. Business is inter-
ested in results, and a man who has
only a moderate amount of knowledge
but can sell his ideas and put over the
things on which he is working, is far
more valuable than one who has an
enormous store of facts but is unable to
bring out of them any concrete accom-
plishment. Obviously, of course, of two
men of equal selling ability, the one
with the greater knowledge is more
valuable. I do not wish to be thought
of as depreciating scholarship as such.
One of the prime factors in selling
ability is the faculty of making others
like you. If you think over your own

lives, you will recognize that you rarely
do things for people you do not like.
This is a natural human characteristic
and one which must be kept in mind
constantly in dealing with people.
Besides selling ability we are always
looking for leadership. Real leaders are
very scarce and the demand is always
greater than the supply. The old reli-
ables which you have heard of so many
times such as self-starting and imagina-
tive qualities, are just as necessary as
they have always been. To this should
be added stick-to-itiveness and the
nerve to make decisions. In our com-
pany we require that all reports sub-
mitted shall have the writer's recom-
mendation for action.
The training you have had should
have led to the above development.
These and a grounding in the funda-
mental principles of the field of study
are more important than knowledge of
many facts or even of extremely high
marks. For general business purposes,
broadness is better than specialization,
which latter is a matter usually of grad-
uate study. This statement is not quite
true of men going into technological
positions, but rather of those who enter
general business. The chief purpose of
the university is to create the desire to
know and to show how to go about
learning.
To summarize, the important thing
is what you are; what you have learned
is important only as it has contributed
to what you are.

ONE ANSWER TO A BURNING QUESTION

TIM HIRD, '39E
POWER—an elusive term with which
every engineer must deal from the
time of his incubation at school or in
the plant until he works out his last
problem and hands his ivory colored
slide rule to another generation of power
conscious engineers. Power is omnipres-
ent; it is the foundation of the existing
high standard of living in the world and
especially in the United States. Because
every improvement in the generation of
power means a corresponding improve-
ment in the standard of living and a re-
duction in manufacturing costs, techni-
cal men have devoted their lives in an
effort to push back the already remote
frontier of thermodynamic research.
Even before the present high thermal
efficiencies were reached, engineers with
foresight had been considering the ad-
vantages of binary systems. Binary sys-
tems are an outgrowth of an attempt to
increase the upper temperature range of
prime movers by using another more
stable vaporous substance as a heat
transmitting medium in the high ranges.
The mercury vapor system which was
invented years ago by Mr. William L.
R. Emmet appeared to be the most
workable of the binary systems, because
the mercury not only showed more sta-
bility at high temperatures, but it also
condensed well above the saturation
temperature of the practical working
pressure of steam. What are the rea-
sons for the increase in the efficiency
afforded by the mercury vapor or any
other other binary system over that of
the Carnot cycle?
The greatest efficiency that can be
realized in any heat engine, as deter-
mined by the Carnot cycle, is a function
of the initial and final temperatures,
(To — TjJ/T,. In the case of a unitary
system using only steam, the tempera-
ture range is definitely limited by the
extremely high vapor pressure exerted
by steam at higher temperatures; on the
other hand, the same temperature range
is limited in the case of mercury by an
extremely low vapor pressure at lower
temperature ranges. Neither of these
two fluids, then, has ideal characteristics
for employment in the Carnot cycle;
but they may be used together, with
the mercury receiving the heat from the
furnace gases at high temperatures, say,
around 1000°F, driving a mercury tur-
bine and then exhausting into a con-
denser boiler. The condensing temper-
ature of mercury is around 47S°F at 1.3
pounds absolute. Water is used as the
cooling medium in the mercury con-
denser and is vaporized. Allowing a
25°F temperature drop through the
condenser tubes, the pressure of the
steam generated is approximately 400
pounds absolute. The steam can then
be expanded through a steam turbine
through the lower temperature ranges
and exhausted at about 80°F.
Most of the additional available en-
ergy furnished by the mercury vapor
can be secured from the furnace gas?s
without the use of extra fuel, and it is
evident that the cycle efficiency must
be considerably increased since the avail-
able energy is increased and the con-
denser rejection remains constant.
The first mercury installation was put
in at the South Meadow Station of the
Hartford Electric Light Company at
Hartford, Conn. This mercury boiler
operates at a pressure of 85 pounds ab-
solute, at a temperature of 908°F and
delivers 10,000 kilowatts from the mer-
cury turbine and 12,500 kilowatts from
the steam turbine. This unit has been
in continuous operation for about eight
years with an availability of 90%. The
following figures were published in 1937.'

When we consider that the average of
the best power plants in the country is
over one pound of coal per kilowatt
hour, or 14,500 BTU per kilowatt hour,
there can be no doubt as to the supe-
riority of the mercury vapor system at
least as far as thermal efficiency is con-
cerned.
Other successful installations of the
mercury vapor system include: the
Kearny Plant of the Public Service Elec-
tric and Gas Company of New Jersey,
and three units owned by the General
Electric Company: the power houses at
the Schenectady Works, the Pittsfield
Works, and the River Works Plant at
West Lynn, Mass. These units are fun-
damentally the same in regard to the
pressure and temperature ranges of the
system with the exception of the station
at West Lynn. There the mercury is
heated to 1015°F in the boiler tubes
and is prevented from vaporizing by a
pressure of 365 pounds absolute. From
this pressure the heated mercury is
throttled through nozzles to a pressure
of 180 pounds absolute, where the latent
heat of the mercury causes a certain
proportion of it to flash into vapor. This
vapor is separated from the liquid in the
flash chamber. In this way, all of the

tubes which absorb heat are filled with
liquid mercury and the vaporization
takes place in the flash chamber outside
of the heated zone. Because of the high
temperatures and pressures to which the
boiler tubes are subjected, they are con-
structed of alloy steel, five percent
chrome and five-tenths percent molyb-
denum. According to Mr. L. A. Shel-
don, its operation has been very satis-
factory.
The application of the mercury vapor
system is by no means confined to land
units; as was pointed out by Mr. Wil-
liam L. R. Emmet in a paper read be-
fore a meeting of the Society of Naval
Architects and Marine Engineers on
Nov. 19, 1937, at New York, this sys-
tem is admirably suited to use in ship
propulsion. Mr. Emmet used as a basis
for his talk, the "Normandie," which
develops 130,000 shaft horsepower and
is considered by Mr. Emmet to be the
crowning achievement of marine ma-
chinery. He pointed out that extreme
conditions have been used at sea on
several German ships, i.e., 1200 pounds
absolute and a temperature of 877°F,
and that the fuel rate reported is only
five percent lower than the conserva-
tively estimated performance of the
"Normandie," whereas he calculates
that his mercury vapor system would
better the performance of the "Norman-
die" by 38 percent. He estimated that
the saving in fuel cost alone at the oil
price of 1937 would be
about $400,000 per year
beside a saving of 400,-
000 cubic feet of space,
17,000 tons of machin-
ery and 3,300 tons of
fuel.
There are some ob-
jections to the use of
mercury vapor but they
can be answered easily.
One of the first objec-
tions to the use of a
mercury vapor unit is,
of course, the poisonous
nature of mercury vapor.
There are two reasons
why this danger is neg-
ligible. In the first place
all mercury carrying
parts are in enclosures

mercury detecting devices have been de-
veloped which are sensitive enough to
detect the mercury in the flue gas when
2.5 cc. of mercury are thrown into the
fire. As far as could be discovered by
research into the subject, there has never
been a life lost by mercury poisoning
in any of the five units now in exist-
ence. Another objection which is not so
easily answered is the excessive cost
of charging and "making up" feed on a
mercury boiler. The average amount of
mercury now used is seven pounds per
kilowatt. This means that a 10,000 KW
unit would require 70,000 lbs. of mer-
cury. At $2.22 per pound, it would cost
$155,000 to charge the boiler. This,
however, is a fixed cost, the leakage is
practically nil, and the unit should pay
for itself within a few years through sav-
ing in fuel cost. A third argument that
is sometimes advanced is that there is
not enough mercury in the world to take
care of power production on a large
scale. The Minerals Year Book of 1936-
1937 gave a production figure for that
year of 167,569 flasks or 604,000
pounds. There is no danger of a short-
age, and the production could probably
be increased if the demand arose.
Mercury vapor, then, marks another
milestone in the engineer's unceasing
search for more power at a lesser cost.
It is now almost perfected and ready
for commercial use. Whether it will ever
come into general use or whether it will
be superseded by another more econom-
ical device is a question which time
alone can answer.

TEN CENTS WORTH OF LIGHT
7L
UO\
A-
E. H. WA
WHEN a prominent lighting engi-
neer was asked, "What type of
lighting would you specify for
schools?'' he replied, "I'd hedge." He
did this with full knowledge of the im-
portance of that new source—fluorescent
lighting. He also realized that twenty-
five dollars would buy the ingredients
for a quarter of a mile of fluorescent
lighting, and that glass is twenty cents
a pound.
Essentially, fluorescent lighting is
produced by an electrical glow discharge
carried on between two electrodes in a
rarefied atmosphere of argon gas and
mercury vapor. When a low potential
is applied between the electrodes, the
gas conducts but a very small current
—on the order of one microampere. This
is called a Townsend current or a slow
drift of electrons. However, as the po-
tential between the electrodes is in-
creased, the speed of electron flow in-
creases until at a particular potential,
which varies with the type of gas, its
pressure, and the length of the tube,
the gas becomes a good conductor. This
happens at what is called the "break-
down voltage." After the glow has
started, the voltage is reduced to a
smaller sustaining voltage. A reactor is
used to limit the flow of current once
the arc is started. Lamps and reactors
are shown in Fig. 2.
Light is produced by utilizing the
electronic energy in kicking one periph-
eral electron of the mercury atom to
a higher energy state. An energy state
is only the particular orbit of a par-
ticular electron. As one electron drops
toward the nucleus of its atom, energy
in the form of light is radiated. Thus,
in changing the energy state of the elec-
trons of the mercury atom, light is pro-
duced. The characteristic color of mer-
cury vapor light is determined by the
energy states that the electrons fall
through. The molecules of the fluores-
cent powder which are coated on the
inner surface of the tube are lifted to a
high energy state by the light from the
interior, and when these complicated
molecules fall from one energy state to
another, the light emitted is in the form
of overlapping spectral bands. Thus is
produced a continuous spectrum and an
aesthetically agreeable light. It was Mc-
Farland Moore, Lehigh 1890, who was
the grandfather of fluorescent lighting.
As early as 1908, he had installed in the
Hotel Savoy in London a gaseous tube
containing nitrogen which emitted white
light. Although no fluorescent principle
was involved, he did lay the groundwork
for Georges Claude, a Frenchman, to
develop neon lighting. These two men
were instrumental in devising efficient
electrodes.
The European has had a real need to
invent a more efficient light source. His
power costs him on the order of ten
cents per kilowatt-hour, whereas the
cost of power to an American is on the
order of four cents per kilowatt-hour.
Hence a source that will give ten cents
worth of light for four cents is desired.
Fluorescent lighting does just that. But
before we could have efficient fluorescent
sources it was necessary to have effi-

screen in television tubes made possible
the highly efficient and much talked
about fluorescent lamp of today.
Fluorescent lamps are gaseous dis-
charge tubes. There are two general
types of discharge tubes: hot cathode
and cold cathode. For the physical char-
acteristics of the former, there is a fila-
ment at each end (on the alternating
current tube) much like that in an
ordinary light bulb. When the lamp is
to be started, this filament is heated and
emits electrons. When the glow has
been started, an automatic switch opens
the circuit to the filaments so that they
may cool. This operation greatly in-
creases the life of the filaments. Be-
cause of the great emission of electrons
by the hot cathode, this is essentially a
low starting voltage light source. A 110
volt circuit will carry a current of 0.3
ampere through three feet of this tube.
The light output for a given tube va-
ries with the amount of current.
The cold cathode fluorescent tube, on
the other hand, has no heating element,
but relies on a high voltage transformer
to cause the current to arc. Its operat-
ing conditions are such that the smaller
the tube, the higher must be the gas
pressure, and the greater will be the
voltage necessary to produce an arc.
Practically all gaseous discharge signs
—neon, mercury vapor and fluorescent
signs are cold cathodes. The elimination
of the filament switch makes the cold
cathode type popular.
Almost anyone can make a fluores-
cent lamp. Secure, let us say, a piece of
soft glass tubing about fifteen milli-
meters in diameter and ten feet long.
Rinse through some hydrofluoric acid
to etch the inside of the tube. This pro-
vides a roughened surface upon which
to apply the fluorescent powder. The
previously heated powder, for white
light, is composed of 73% zinc sulfide,
27% cadmium sulfide, and 0.01% of
silver and copper crystallizing com-
pounds—according to United States
Patent No. 2,126,233. Then to one end
of this prepared glass tube is attached a
barium coated electrode. Now insert
into the tube a globule of mercury
about the size of a small pea. Next, at
a spot several inches from the attached
electrode, heat the tube with a gas
flame and blow out a little hole. Attach
over the hole a short piece of three
millimeter tubing. Through this hole,
evacuation will be made. Now seal an
electrode into the other end. Place a
vacuum pump on the tube and evacu-
ate to a pressure of four to ten milli-
meters of mercury column at which
time a current of one ampere at ten to
fifteen thousand volts is applied to the
tube. The electrodes and glass become
red hot. This degasifies them and
causes the fluorescent powders to adhere
more firmly to the glass. Care must be
exercised so as not to melt the glass.

Comment*
IF you are a student looking for sum-
mer work, you may need to present
yourself on paper to the prospective em-
ployer either before you get an inter-
view, or afterwards. If you are an un-
placed senior, you should be busy lead-
ing up to interviews by properly using
an "on-paper" approach to a number of
employers. When you present yourself
suitably, you greatly improve your
chances of soon being suitably placed.
When the presentation is poor, you
probably will not even get to be inter-
viewed.
Getting yourself presented properly
on paper constitutes a design job. Since
it is a type of design you are unfamiliar
with until you need to engage in it, the
results are prone to be anything but ac-
ceptable unless you take advantage of
the experience of others. In an article
I wrote for the November, 1935, issue
of the Michigan Technic, I tried to
make the experience of others avail-
able. A copy of the article, and a
number of samples of typed per-
sonal records, are always kept
available in Room 274 West
Engineering. It is pleasing to
report that many students
have made effective use of
these items.
A few students
have no dif
ticulty in
finding
summer
employ-
ment.

When a freshman writes to an em-
ployer, he can usually expect to say all
he needs to say, in his letter; but when
a senior or a graduate tells his story, a
letter would run to undue length if it
is to do justice to the writer's minimum
factual items, statement of training, bits
of experience, activities, preferences, and
so on. As the 1935 Technic article sets
forth, a separation should be effected:
prepare a typed personal record, and a
letter. The typed personal record
amounts to a concise engineering report
on yourself; and the letter becomes a
letter of transmittal.
It is not the intention, in this limited
space, to try to describe the make-up of
letter and record. Those interested will
look up the article and view the sample
records. Now, to emphasize again the
fact that presenting-yourself-on-paper
is a ticklish business calling for the best
you can give it, let me cite an actual
case. To protect the graduate, let's call
him G.
G is self-centered to a damaging de-
gree. My first inkling of this came from
talks with him, in which he concen-
trated unduly on his own placement
problems, and gave no hint of having
recognized that the employer also has
things to worry about. Such a diagnosis
of self-centeredness must be tentative,
until flanked by further evidence. Later
office talks furnished the evidence. G
would come to Ann Arbor, drop in on
me without previous arrangement, and
be all set to use up an unlimited amount
of time on his own problems. Final
evidence came in terms of G's own
typed personal record.
The record, which G filed with me
after reading the afore-mentioned article
and seeing the samples, was on good
white paper of standard size. The typing
was not perfect, but acceptable. The
general appearance was acceptable. The
main facts were included. The photo-
graph was acceptable.
But the photograph was mounted on
page one of the three-page document in
such a position that to fold the record
for mailing in an ordinary large envelope
would mean folding the photograph.
Only a small part of the content was
set forth in item-style. Otherwise, G
used over two pages of letter-fashion,
paragraph-by-paragraph presentation to
cover his education, training, experience,
and preferences. This did two things.
First, it buried important facts among
a mass of words. (Self-centeredness: G
unconsciously assumes the prospective
employer has unlimited time for prowl-
ing through a personal essay to find the
salient facts about G.) Second, it forced
G to excessive use of the personal pro-
noun. The appalling fact is that he
used "I," "my," and "me," collectively,
a total of 37 times in his document.
If you are a senior who has already
been hired through a recruiting inter-
view held on the campus, you will have
made out a company interview or ap-
plication blank. But that experience did
not teach you how to make up your
own version of a good typed personal
record. Maybe you are thinking you
now have no need for it; but what will
you do later, if you want to change
from one employer to another? Only
yesterday, a graduate of several years'
standing filed an excellent typed per-
sonal record with me, and notified me
that he wants to make a change. Call
him Z.
Z has been doing fine work with an
excellent company. He wants to get into
sales and application work; his com-
pany has plenty of just that. Z is now
splendidly qualified for that work, and
he has been approved within the com-
pany for sales and application engi-
neering. But—Z has been doing such
valuable work in Department X of the
company, that his superior refuses to
let him go; and the management honors
the superior's needs. These cases do
arise, and this is one of them. Z has had
to decide that his only "out" is to get
out; and in this case, he is right.
When a graduate files an excellent
typed personal record with me, I know
that he is prepared to mail a copy to a
prospective employer on short notice.
In general (the exceptions are few) the
graduate who can and does organize his
own case on paper, can and will carry
himself through interviews with colors
flying.

MAKING PRODUCTION
DOLLARS S-T-R-E-T-C-H
The simplification or elimination of fabricating proc-
esses is one way of making production dollars go far-
ther. Molybdenum steels axe often a help in that way.
For instance, a manufacturer of high pressure motor
driven pumps uses cast Nickel-Molybdenum steel for
cross-head guides because it has the required tough-
ness and hardness. In addition, the ready machin-
ability and close grained structure of the steel make
it possible to produce a good bearing surface in the
guide runways by a light cut with a shearing tool.
One finishing operation — grinding — is entirely
eliminated.
Very often a re-check of material specifications re-
veals several places where Molybdenum steels will
produce better results, or lower costs, or both. Our
booklet, "Molybdenum in Steel," will be sent gladly
without charge to any interested engineering students
requesting it.

GLEANINGS FROM HERE AND THERE
fair lighting
One of the essentials of any world's
fair is a spectacular lighting system,
and, from all reports, New York's pres-
ent show is no exception. Among the
more interesting individual units for
illuminating the "World of Tomorrow"
is the submersible twin color-drum de-
vice being used in the Lagoon of Na-
tions display. The color drum consists
essentially of a watertight enclosure
containing two searchlights with color
filters and mechanical dimmers; one
searchlight contains a 1500-watt in-
candescent projection lamp, the other
a 400-watt high-intensity capillary mer-
cury lamp. The mercury lamp has an
output of 18,000 lumens; it is mounted
in a specular Alzak-finished aluminum
reflector and provides a thin "pencil"
beam of light with a maximum candle-
power of approximately 250,000. The
Mazda lamp has an output of 37,950
lumens with maximum candlepower of
350,000.
Around each reflector rotates a color
drum carrying special tinted glass filters
for varying the color output of the unit.
The wheel for the mercury unit has six
plates: three colored, two blank, and
one clear glass. The color drum around
the Mazda lamp has four colored, one
clear, and one blank plate. Each drum
is driven by a 1/75-horsepower, three-
phase, 1800-r.p.m., 208-volt synchro-
nous motor with built-in speed reducer.
The speed reducer in combination with
a large ring gear produces a drum speed
of one revolution per minute. Color
drums, motors, and auxiliary apparatus
are all mounted in a watertight sheet
steel housing 40" by 30" by 31". In
the cover of the housing are panels of
special heat-treated glass capable of
withstanding high localized tempera-
ture. The entire assembly weighs 325
pounds.
Since 1170 color drums will be in op-
eration simultaneously, exact control
of the motors is imperative. To prevent
"coasting" when the a-c supply is dis-
connected, the motors are braked by the
application of direct current at 60 volts.

all drums at the beginning of each show,
each color-wheel motor has a resyn-
chronizing limit switch and relay. The
relay operating coil is designed for op-
eration on direct current. Each color
drum is equipped with a cam for oper-
ation of the limit switch. To synchro-
nize, the d-c circuit is energized, the cam
closes the limit switch and supplies
direct current to the operating coil of
the relay, which is of the double-pole
double-throw type. As the operating
coil is energized by the d-c supply, the
three-phase a-c supply to the motor is
disconnected and direct-current is ap-
plied to the motor windings for braking.
After synchronization the color drums
are started merely by removing the
braking current.
dies for porcelain
The average person pays little atten-
tion to the porcelain insulation on elec-
trical devices, but occasionally that
item becomes a matter of considerable
industrial concern, as in the case of
volume production of dry-process elec-
trical porcelain pieces having some 75
individual dimensions that must be
held rigidly to drawing so that 30 metal
parts may fit the casting and enclosing
assembly accurately to each other.
The steel die used to form the piece
in the factory is made from a solid
block of the best tool steel, each detail
being chiseled or ground out, and each
surface being polished to the smooth-
ness of glass. The finished die weighs
about 300 pounds, costs several hun-
dred dollars, and produces a piece of
porcelain selling for less than a dollar.
The clay used in such a die must be
prepared just as carefully as the die
itself, so that shrinkage may be con-
trolled precisely during drying and fir-
ing, and so that porosity may be min-
imized and the ultimate strength may
be great. Presses forming these pieces
are operated by hand, and it takes a
highly skilled operator to do the job.
Most of the workmen have spent years
learning just what pressure to apply to
a die and how to apply it. After mold-
ing, the raw porcelain is dried just
enough to make the surface tough pre-
liminary to sponging and smoothing.
Then the pieces are dried until all free
moisture is eliminated, following which
they are fired in kilns in a precisely
controlled atmosphere and temperature.

administrator
Mr. John W. Kushing, author of this
issue's article on Administration, is
amply experienced in that particular
field, having served as Vice-President
in Charge of Engineering for Highway
Steel Products Company since July,
1937. His viewpoint is far from being
one-sided, however, inasmuch as most
of his previous work was in the more
technical phase of the profession. Grad-
uating from Michigan in 1925, Mr.
Kushing was associated in various engi-
neering capacities with railroads and
machinery and automobile manufacture.
For four years following 1933, he was
primarily interested in research, partic-
ularly in concrete pavement design.
During this period he served as Re-
search and Testing Engineer for the
Michigan State Highway Department,
and was active, as a member, in the re-
search work of the following organiza-
tions: American Society for Testing
Materials, American Association of State
Highway Officials, American Concrete
Institute, and the Highway Research
Board.
what would you do
Beginning with the Mead Lecture,
the Committee of Professional Practice
with the help of the faculty has been
endeavoring to acquaint the student
with the problems that he will meet out
in the business world. A number of the
upperclassmen have been invited to
round tables with various professors to
discuss situations that have arisen in
the lives of young engineers. It is an
attempt to enable the Michigan man to
meet vital problems having no simple
formula solution—problems that require
forbearance, patience, and tact as well
as a clear concept of honesty and fair
play.
Next year the Michigan Technic
with the Committee of Professional
Practice will run a contest that it is
hoped everyone will take part in. On
these pages in each issue will be printed
a problem in which Engineering Ethics
are involved. To the person who turns
in the best solution will be given a
worthwhile reward and outstanding
answers will be reprinted in a follow-
ing issue.
two years more
Should engineers be required to go to
school for five or six years instead of
the present four years before being
given a degree? Believe it or not, this
is an important and pertinent ques-
tion in engineering circles today. Natur-
ally, both the pro and con camps have
their ardent proponents.
In our interview this month, Dean
Emeritus Cooley airs his decided views
on the subject. We would appreciate
hearing your reaction to his plan. The
Technic is considering running a forum
on the question next year, and your
opinion may have a lot to do with the
attitude taken by your engineering
magazine. Letters in editorial form, or
comments pro or con, should be ad-
dressed to the Editor of the Technic.
hole in the ground
Of all the thousands of people who
walk through the Engineering Arch
every day and on up the Diagonal, per-
haps a few notice an old white picket
fence and bedraggled hedge to their
right. Perhaps still fewer read the warn-
ing sign of Danger posted on the fence.
No doubt there are some who have been
curious enough to defy that sign and
look behind the hedge—only to see a
cavity, perhaps twenty feet deep, with
the appearance of an abandoned base-
ment, partially filled with various spe-
cies of junk and debris. If you were one
of those with enough curiosity to look
into the hole, perhaps you had enough
imagination to wonder what it was
there for. You might, for example, have
heard some story of how at one time
part of the campus was a marshy hollow,
which was all filled in with the excep-
tion of this pit. Or you might have
taken it to be what it assuredly looks
like: a campus dumping-ground. Or you
might have associated it with the gun-
shots and bugle calls of the neighboring
building and thought this was a "no-
man's land" for the practice of our
budding doughboys. Or, if you were
really observant, you might have looked
at the near-by smoke-stack and the
words "Boiler House" above the en-
trance of the R.0.T.C building, for it
is these which provide the real clue to
the raison d'etre of this hole in the
ground.
The present R.0.T.C building was at
one time the power house. From 1894
to 1913, when the present power house
on Washington was built, this building
was the source of heat and power for
the University. In this hole to the south
of the building and in one which was
similar on the north were the coal
bunkers. Over the top of the hole there
was a roof of concrete which was in
turn supported by steel girders. There
were manholes in the top through which
the coal was dumped into the bunkers.
About 15 years ago it was noticed
that this roof was cracking and that the
steel girders under the concrete were
badly corroded due to the moisture and
the sulphur gases, and so the hole on
the north was filled in and the one on
the south had a fence built around it.
One night, six years ago, the top fell
in, just as everyone had been expecting
it to for years. The girders were sold
for junk as were some bricks which were
part of the understructure, and the rest
of the debris was just left where it was.
The hole hasn't been filled in because
some day the University hopes to finish
the West Engineering building and this
would be part of the basement. How-
ever, there is nothing to get excited
about because it will be a long time be-
fore this will happen.

THE SHAPE
OF
THINGS
TO COME

The shape of things
to come is planned
today on the draw-
ings of architects
and engineers.
Drawings that con-
tribute to the ad-
vancement of ar-
chitecture and en-
gineering must be able to withstand the ravages of time.
That is why such plans are drawn with Higgins Waterproof
Black Drawing Ink.
So, in preparation for your own future, Higgins—smooth,
jet-black and even-flowing — helps you to do better work.
For more than 50 years Higgins has been the standard India
Ink among engineers, architects and students who plan ahead.

fact that it was he who made the busi-
ness possible. Yet he doubtless had the
technical ability to manage the manu-
facture of his product quite as well as
the man who took the duty over. Dean
Cooley believes that if engineers were
trained to be men of affairs, as well as
specialists, they would occupy a great
many more positions of leadership in
the industrial world than they do at
present; and not in the industrial world
alone at that, but also in almost every
other conceivable field of leadership.
In addition to the rewards of becom-
ing a more successful man in his work
and of advancing the standing of his
profession, the Dean feels that the per-
sonal life of the engineer will be en-
riched if he has a more cultural educa-
tion. With a broader knowledge, he will
be able to understand more of the sig-
nificance of living. To illustrate how a

restricted, technical knowledge may
handicap one in his personal life, the
Dean told the following anecdote.
The children of a prominent engineer
were gathered around him asking a
great variety of questions on whatever
happened to appeal to their interests, in
the usual manner of curious youngsters.
He was having a tough time of it, be-
cause he just didn't know the answers.
The children were beginning to think
Dad was pretty stupid, but their Mother
saved the day. She whispered to one of
them, "Ask him something about
monkey wrenches."
When the line of questions shifted to
this familiar ground. Dad expanded and
went to town. With a smile Dean
Cooley pointed out the moral, "A man
ought to be able to talk something be-
sides monkey wrenches."
This all merely skims the surface of
the reasons for the Dean's arguments
for a more thorough education for engi-
neers. What he proposes as a remedy of
the defect is a five, or preferably a six
year course, which would not exclude the
existing technical curriculum, but which
would allow the inclusion of the human-
ities and the business and economics
courses which many of us are trying to
sandwich into the present set-up.
Dean Cooley realizes that a move-
ment of this sort could not be success-
fully carried out by a single college. It
would require the cooperation of at
least the majority of the engineering
schools of the country. The scheme has
its distinct merits and has been tried
to a certain degree here at Michigan,
with better than average success. Heads
of the engineering societies and the
deans of the leading schools of America
have been, and still are deliberating
about it.
The movement did not start with this
article, and certainly will not end with
it. Yet its success requires your co-
operation and ours. The Dean's earnest
plea is that we consider it seriously.

wait rodger
We have just received word that at
the last meeting of the Board of Re-
gents a special act was passed empow-
ering the Department of Buildings and
Grounds to remove from the south tree
in front of the East Engine Building a
piece of junk affectionately referred to
by its owner as Sally Ann.
Sally Ann, reputed to be a bicycle,
has for eleven years been the property
of Walt Rodger who claims that he can
actually ride it to school. So fanatic is
his interest in this decrepit wreck that
he claims he is going to ride it up the
ramp to get his diploma.
Walt, who is a native Detroiter by
birth and a Red ford man by choice, has,
however, one or two other claims to dis-
tinction.
During the past year he has served as
Editor-in-Chief of the Technic, and
has been Wes Warren's chief heckler on
the Engineering Council.
He is entitled to wear upon his walch
chain (and frequently does) the in-
signia of Tau Beta Pi, Vulcans, Sigma
Xi, Phi Kappa Phi, Phi Lambda Up-
silon, and Phi Eta Sigma. He is also en-
titled to wear upon his vest the pin of
Trigon social fraternity. However, he
seems to prefer to leave that in East
Lansing for safe keeping. He is very in-
terested in its welfare, though, and
makes use of every opportunity to go up
to see how it's getting along.
During his sophomore year Walt
made a straight A record and claims to
have seen 95r.v of the owl shows. It won
him A. I. Ch. E.'s scholarship award
and a reputation which has carried him
through a year of editing the Technic.
Last year Walt was Publicity Chair-
man of the Slide Rule Ball. But the
combination of ham, a trip through a
chemical plant, and the prospect of
Mike Riley was too much. He has been
trying for a year to live down the fact
that that was one party he never at-
tended. This year the General Chair-
manship fell to him and he nearly lost
his hair and did lose his good disposi-
tion before finally signing Vincent
Lopez.
But his principal love has been the
Technic. So great has been his interest
in it that he plans a year of graduate
work and then hopes to get into techni-
cal journalism. At the moment his
proudest possession is the Hamilton
wrist watch the staff gave him to ex-
press their appreciation of the fine work
he has done as editor.
Walt started out studying Chemical
Engineering but changed to Metallurgi-
cal. After being elected president of A.
I. Ch. E., however, he decided it would
be best to make it both. And so in June
there will be two degrees—one for Walt
and one for Sally Ann.
colonel miller
Every engineer, whether he likes it
or not, takes drawing, and will usually
admit that it is one of his most impor-
tant courses. Behind Michigan's exten-
sive Drawing Department is Colonel
Henry W. Miller, and behind "The
Colonel," as he is called by most of his
students, is a long and varied career.
Although he received training at
Washington and Lee in both Mechani-
cal and Civil Engineering, he has spent
little time in the latter field except when
during his senior year he worked as a
county surveyor in Virginia. The
Colonel first taught at the University of
Illinois where he was Assistant Dean
of the College of Engineering from 1909
to 1916.
Entering the army during the Mexi-
can Border trouble he served first as a
lieutenant in the Field Artillery; then
as doctor and Chief of Sanitation. Upon
our entrance into the World War, he
was ordered to Europe by General
Pershing as a Mobile Artillery Engi-
neer. He says that since neither he nor
anyone else available knew anything
about mobile artillery it was of little
import who was sent.
However, he learned what he could,
first from the British, then the French.
The Colonel readily recalls his first
days at the front which were spent in
24
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The enemy had just bombed a nearby
remount station and horses, it seems,
are hard to bury. It was here, too, that
he was gassed the first time.
Despite which he learned enough to
become Chief Engineer of the Heavy
Artillery of the A. E. F. and a world
authority on the subject. A number of
his many books are artillery manuals
and histories. His experiences in Europe
were climaxed when he submitted to be-
ing kissed on both cheeks as an adjunct
to being made a chevalier of the French
Legion of Honor.
Following the war he was chief engi-
neer for the Baltimore Copper Smelting
and Rolling Company, producers of a
fifth of the world's copper. It was from
this position that the Colonel came to
Michigan. His list of honoraries and
societies includes Phi Gamma Delta, Pi
Tau Sigma, Scabbard and Blade, Sigma
Rho Tau, Theta Tau, Phi Beta Kappa
and A. S. M. E.
Fifteen years ago the Colonel became
a member of the Tf.chnic faculty board
and for the past twelve years has served
as chairman. His long period of service
to the Technic is typical of the interest
which he takes in all his work—an in-
terest which has made him an expert
and valued man in everything he has
tackled.
At the moment the Colonel is filling
what spare time he can find with work
on three books. And if you have won-
dered about those unexpected little
tests of memory and observation that
pop up in drawing courses you might
like to know that you were serving as a
guinea pig for research on his tome
The Science of Learning. This work also
explains the device in his office resem-
bling a window frame in which is a
lighted picture. He is seeking something
that can be used to look at without dis-
tracting attention or breaking a train
of thought—calls it his "thinking
window."
chuck probst
Perhaps you have noticed, someplace
around campus, a rather agile gentle-
man with a camera—maybe he was
crawling through a ditch on his stomach
to photograph a power shovel at work,
or possibly he was hanging by his heels
from a chandelier in the Union ballroom
in order to capture for posterity the
subtle changes in expression of Vincey
Lopez' face. The man with the camera
would be Chuck Probst, and all this
activity had its beginning about three
years ago, when someone gave him a
brand-new Super-Baldina. For two
years he was too busy to do much with
it, but this last year has more than
made up for lost time. Chuck has hs
camera with him constantly, and works
on the theory that a multitude of neg-
atives will invariably produce at least
a few good pictures. During the last
six months he has taken about four
thousand negatives, of which from 20 to
25 per cent were valuable enough to
print—a rather high average, consider-
ing that many of the negatives are of
an experimental nature. While Probst
makes little attempt to limit his photos
to any particular field, most of his work
can be classified as "candid," scenic, or
technical. Chuck finds his photographic
work is a valuable supplement to lab re-
ports, especially of forging processes.
Last semester he made a particularly

Ever since we came to Michigan at-

fact that practically all small colleges

has been that if any group could put
across such an idea, it would be the

LET US SUBMIT IDEAS
This year the Senior Class Repre-
sentatives have succeeded in arousing
sufficient interest in a class ring to war-
rant having one designed. Already
enough rings have been sold to guar-
antee the success of the movement.
Although a ring is expensive, we
think it is a worthwhile symbol of the
four years spent at Michigan, and we
wish to congratulate Dick Roemer and
the others on the committee for putting
it across.

Whatever authority may be attached
comes by way of one of our more prom-
inent pre-doctorates. Claims he: last

interesting sequence of thirty shots of
an afternoon's cupola run.
Probst's whole life is far from being
completely centered around photogra-
phy, however. Born in Toledo and
christened Charles Oliver Probst, he at-
tended high school there, where much
of his time was taken up with—believe
it or not—playing with dolls, or, to be
more exact, puppets. Chuck combined
rare flairs for dramatics and linguistics,
and helped to stage miniature dramas,
in French, German, and Spanish, for the
benefit of the high school language
classes. The two most popular plays
were Little Red Riding Hood and The
Three Little Pigs.
After leaving preparatory school,
Chuck moved to Detroit and then came
on to the University. Here he went out
for Sigma Rho Tau—largely because he
was highly intrigued by Professor
Bracketfs performance in Freshman
Assembly—and stuck with it, becoming
consecutively Circle Leader, Corre-
sponding Secretary and this year, Presi-
dent of the organization. He also joined
Alpha Kappa Lambda fraternity, of
which he is social chairman, tying in
with hobby number two—dancing.
Probst has earned part of his school ex-
penses by selling some of his photo-
graphs and by working during the
school year and during the summer:
selling hosiery, drafting, and doing some
work in experimental testing. He has
also been active in ROTC, having at-
tended Camp Custer one summer.
Professionally, Chuck is interested in
automobiles. During his first three years
at school, he did considerable studying
on his own in this field; last year he
wrote two articles published in the
Technic—on his "dream car" and his
"dream airplane." Even the camera
work is not completely alien, as he be-
lieves it will be of considerable use to
him in the future. After receiving his
Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering
this June, Chuck may either go to work
or continue in school for a Master's de-
gree, but in either case he hopes to cen-
ter his activity on some phase of auto-
motive research.

spect and did not ask the grad student
how he was sure that she was calm

oh rapture
Something tells us that just beyond
the spectre of examinations there is lurk-
ing a vacation. Probably it won't be a
true holiday for most of you, but it
will be a temporary break in study and
for us it will mark the end of our fifty-
seventh year of publication.
A hasty glance around the office
shows that most of our staff is in need
of a deep breath and a good night's
sleep before tackling the October issue.
We hope they get it.
And we hope that all of you, whether
you spend the summer working, study-
ing, or playing have an enjoyable va-

to buy a subscription to the new volume

cost you only a dollar (plug).

All of which just about winds up our
activities for the year. This department
has been an experiment. Sometimes
we've tried to be humorous, sometimes
serious, but always we've tried to be
interesting. We've had fun writing it,
and hope you've gotten a little enjoy-
ment from reading it.
But now the experiment is at an end.
Perhaps the column will be back next
year, and perhaps not—that rests in
the hands of fate and the Publication
Board. And so now with a low bow
to the men who have filled the other
features during the past year—Dick
Adams, Bob Gustafson, Frank Feely,
and George Schnier—and a kind word

for any readers who have stuck through
to the bitter end, we say so long and
happy landings.

The tube is now evacuated to a pres-
sure of 0.005 millimeters of mercury
column at which time about seven milli-
meters of pressure of argon gas is ad-
mitted through the evacuation tube.
The evacuation tube is now sealed off
and the lamp is ready for use.
The two main advantages of fluores-
cent lighting are its high inherent effi-
ciency—two or three times the effi-
ciency of the incandescent lamp—and
the ease with which any color of light
may be secured.
Fluorescent lamps have a life which
is limited only by the blackening of the
tube and the dissipation of argon gas,
which prevents starting. This life may
be from two thousand to ten thousand
hours, while incandescent lamps are
rated at one thousand hours. The best

performance of fluorescent lamps is se-
cured at room temperature; sixty de-
grees above or below produces a notice-
able diminution of light output. Whereas
a one per cent change in voltage pro-
duces about a three per cent change in
light output from an incandescent lamp,
it produces only about one per cent
change in the light output from a
fluorescent lamp. The characteristic
flickering of mercury vapor arc lamps
has been eliminated by the time-lag
glow of the fluorescent powders. Figure
3 shows the spectral energy distribution
of this light source as compared to sev-
eral other light sources. Notice how the
yellow-green lines and the blue-violet
lines of the mercury vapor spectrum
come through the wall of the tube to
reinforce these energy levels.
There are several disadvantages to
fluorescent lighting, but further re-
search will probably correct them. One
of the disadvantages is that the light
emission per lamp is small—the largest
commercial daylight fluorescent lamp is
now about fifty watts—equivalent to
one ISO watt incandescent lamp. An-
other is the relatively high price of the
necessary auxiliary equipment which
consumes about 15$ of the total power
and has a power factor of 0.6. Lamps
with reactors cost from one to two

dollars per foot, yet more than one

Although fluorescent lighting has
some disadvantages, its advantages
more than outweigh them. At the pres-
ent time there are about five thousand
fluorescent lamps being made every day
in this country while nearly three million
incandescent lamps are being made per
day. Next year the lamp manufacturers
expect to make about two per cent as
many fluorescent lamps as they make of
large incandescent lamps.
Progress is so rapid in fluorescent
lighting today that any large installa-
tion will be obsolete in five years. When
the cost of fluorescent lighting installa-
tion comes down, such lighting will have
wider acceptance. At the present time,
the initial cost exceeds its inherent effi-
ciencies, except for certain special uses.
One reason for the high cost of installed
fluorescent lighting is that fixture manu-
facturers are experiencing a difficult
time in designing a light fixture for a
low-brightness light source: their expe-
rience in design has been with a point
source. For the design engineer, here is
a live opportunity. Another tremendous
opportunity exists for the electrical
engineer. He can go to his home town
and with a little capital use his knowl-
edge to make usable light sources, sell
them, and install them.
This localization of lamp manufac-
ture that will probably result from
fluorescent lighting will produce quite
an impact on the industry and to some
extent change the sociological set-up of
our country. Where before incandescent
lamps were standardized by three or
four companies so that Paducah had
identically the same type of lighting as
New York, this will no longer be alto-
gether true; there will be many inde-
pendent souls with a knowledge of elec-
tricity who desire to compete with the
big manufacturer and install custom-
built lighting.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Professor ). Ormondroyd came to the University in 1937 as
Professor of Engineering Mechanics. Before coming here he
was Manager of the Experimental Division of the Westinghouse
Elec. and Mfg. Co. and, among other things, had charge of the
design of the mounting for the 200" telescope at Mt. Palomar,
California. Professor Ormondroyd is an expert in Dynamics,
especially vibration problems, and has contributed several
papers as a result of his researches in this field. Advanced
courses in Vibration and Dynamics are offered by Professor
Ormondroyd.

Professor J. A. Van den Brock has been with the University
for 25 years as a teacher in the Engineering Mechanics De-
partment. His specialty is Strength of Materials, in which
field he has made several outstanding contributions, such as
his analysis of the spiral spring, his work on the effects of
cold working of steel, and a textbook on Elastic Energy Theory.
At the present time he is giving advanced courses in Strength
of Materials and Theory of Limit Design.

IT CUTS SOME ICE
N1CODEMUS, the brown-nosed seal, playfully swam
up to the North Pole, tripped the circuit-hreaker
and plunged Santa's workshop into darkness.
Absurd? Not as far as the successful operation of G-E
outdoor air-break switches is concerned. These have been
placed in a special room in the General Electric Research
Laboratory at minus 20 degrees Fahrenheit, sprayed with
water, and tested when coated with ice to a thickness of
one and a halt inches. The powerful leverages shattered the
ice as easily as a walrus swallows a fish. In each case the
switches opened and closet! properly.
This test is just one of the many which G-E equipment
must pass. And the observers, who check the operations
with pitiless eye, are members ot the G-E Test Course -
young college men in their first year with the Company.

OH! MUMMY.../
which a doctor may fluoroscope a broken bone, except

Harwa lived 2800 years ago, in Egypt. From inscriptions on
the coffin lid it is learned that he was overseer ot storage
houses on the great farming estate ot one of the temples of
Amen, chiet god ot the empire. Pathological study of the
mummy by means ot x-ray indicates that Harwa was
probably forty years old at the time of his death. And
now, nearly 3000 years later, he is in his portable grave, a
citizen ot ancient Egypt in the World ot Tomorrow.

FLOATING POWER
THE surging waves ot a stormy sea are beautiful to an
artist, disconcerting to a food-loving passenger, but
just another problem to an engineer. Whenever a sleek,
ocean liner plows her bow through a heaving swell, her
engines feel an added load, and her captain wonders if the
fuel will last. So, G-E engineers built an all-electric meter
that will accurately measure the power put out by the
propeller ot any boat, from a tiny tug to a transatlantic
greyhound.
The meter is essentially a combination of two electric
generators mounted a little distance away from each other
on the propeller shaft, and connected to instruments
which can be located at any point on the ship. The
generators are so mounted that at no load the voltages
generated are exactly [80 degrees apart in phase and there-
fore add to zero.
When a load is placed on the revolving shaft, the torque
causes a small angular twist in the shatt; consequently,
the two generated voltages no longer add to zero. The
resultant voltage is proportional to both the shaft twist
and the propeller speed, and hence the meter can be made
to read directly in horsepower. The installation can easily
be modified to indicate total horsepower-hours and to
write an automatic log of the power delivered during the
trip.
Among the G-E engineers who developed the device
are A. V. Mershon, Pratt Institute '13 and Union College
'ic, and C. I. Hall, V. of Illinois '10.
A SKELETON in the closet—a white-robed ghost in
the attic—even Ichabod Crane's headless horseman —
may well teel jealous ot Harwa, the Egyptian mummy. For
while conservative ancestors content themselves with roll-
ing in their graves in a genteel way, Harwa is floodlighted
in a golden glow in lull view ot the public in the G-E
building at the New York World's Fair.
'1 his unusual exhibit is designed, not to frighten women
and little children out of their wits but to demonstrate one
ot the many uses ol x-rays. By pressing a button, an x-ray
machine is turned on, anil an image ot Harwa's skeleton
appears on a fluorescent screen which moves in tront ot the
mummy. The principle employed is the same as that by
