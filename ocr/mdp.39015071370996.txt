CLEANING CLOTHES
The natural American ambition to be well dressed has
resulted in a great industry—dry cleaning.
This business of keeping the party dresses and every-
day frocks—the suits and overcoats—the hats and
other accessories of several million Americans looking
their best is no simple operation.
Few people realize the problems that must be met—the
research and demands on science involved.
Dry cleaning clothes is not just glorified laundering.
It is not just a matter of removing dirt and spots.
True enough, the garment must be made clean. But,
it must also retain its original color—its original
texture and surface—and its size and shape.
Into the dry cleaner's hands come delicate chiffons;
rough, woolly tweeds; shimmering satins; lustrous
velvets, dull crepes and many other materials. Some
are pure wool—pure silk—others are viscose and
acetate rayons.
It's up to the dry cleaner to remove the soil, yet in no
wise change the color—lose the shimmer or sheen—
and, above all, avoid shrinkage or stretching in these
varieties of fabrics.
For years the dry cleaning industry labored under the
handicap of being conlined to natural solvents—
naphthas—that were both limited in cleaning ability
and definitely dangerous as a fire hazard.
Then chemical science came to the dry cleaner's aid.
New, synthetic solvents were produced—solvents that
not only took into consideration the requirements of
both natural and commercial materials such as rayons
but were non-in/lammable and non-combustible in the
bargain.
Today, the majority of reputable dry cleaners use these
superior safe solvents in conjunction with various
highly engineered dry cleaning systems. It can be
safely said that the high standard of modern dry
cleaning is largely due to chemistry's contribution to
belter solvents.
Dow has been a leader in the development of synthetic
dry cleaning solvents and enjoys the distinction of
having its various solvents specifically recommended
by the principal makers of dry cleaning equipment.
Thus, in still another direction, Dow sees the efforts of
its laboratories, its production of chemicals, culminate
in a genuine service to a multitude of individuals.

MODERN REDUCTION PLANT
This new plant and another like it have replaced an old reduction
plant in Columbus The old extracted oils and grease from certain kinds
of garbage, and made a cheap fertilizer of the residue, but high cost
of transporting refuse to the central plant ate up all the profits. These
new plants of 100 and 150 tons per day capacity are equipped with
incinerators to handle all kinds of refuse. Furthermore, these new plants
make no smoke or odor.

THE DISPOSAL of fumes from acids
used in the pickling, or cleaning of
metal parts, and their subsequent finish-
ing, often is a complex problem in small
as well as large industrial plants. Ford
engineers have attacked the problem
with characteristic thoroughness and
persistence. Their solution, as revealed
by this brief glimpse of operations at
River Rouge, indicates the importance
of both design and materials in equip-
ment used for handling corrosive liquids
and fumes.
* * *
Among the many incidental problems
involved by the vast scale operations at
the 1100 acre plant of the Ford Motor
Company at River Rouge, Michigan,
few have been of more importance than
that of disposing of acid fumes from
pickling, cleaning and plating vats. The
magnitude of the problem is indicated
by the fact that more than fifty tons of
acid are used daily during periods of
peak production. The figure does not
fall much below this point at any time
while the plant is operating.
Acids, temperatures, and concentra-
tions cover a wide range, as might be
expected from the diversified operations
involved. For most pickling purposes
sulphuric acid is used, though muriatic
and others are employed as well. Many
plating operations are performed on
automobile parts at the plant and a large
department is maintained for the chrome
plating of tools, also involving the use
of acids.
Most pickling is done at temperatures
between 160° and 180° F., with rela-
tively little being carried out at room
temperatures. The period of acid im-
mersion and wash ranges between 35
and 45 minutes in most operations.
Solutions run, on the whole, between 6
and 9 per cent in concentrations, with
some notable exceptions. Chief among
these is the picking of small brass radia-
tor parts before soldering. These are
stamped out on huge presses at high
speed, involving the use of considerable
oil for lubricating, which must be re-
moved before the parts are sent to the
soldering tables. A short dip in acid of
much higher strength is required for
this purpose.
In the chrome plating of tools the
temperature of the preliminary pickling
runs about 135° F., a concentration of
50 per cent muriatic acid being used.
With the exception of the operations
in the tool department, all pickling is
handled in sequence in the regular line
of production with the aid of mechanical
conveyors. For the most part, however,
loading and unloading is required from
the production line conveyor to the pick-
ling conveyor. In the handling of certain
small parts, such as brake shoes, pick-
ling and cadmium plating .— for rust
protection—are carried out in the same
piece of equipment, the parts passing
through the regular acid cleaning and
plating baths in one series of operations.
Obsolescence—like dirt—being one of
the outstanding aversions of Henry
Ford, new ideas and new equipment
constantly are finding their way into
pickling as well as all other processes in
the progressive Ford plant. Naturally,
therefore, equipment changes as oppor-
tunity and study point the way to pos-
sible improvements. For engineers stead-
ily are at work on the development of
special equipment to meet various plant
needs. Therefore pickling operations,
because of their importance, have re-
ceived careful engineering attention and
a novel type of apparatus has been de-
vised. This consists of the conventional
sequence of washing, acid, and rinsing
tanks through which the parts to be
pickled are carried by a conveyor. The

equipment departs from the convention-
al in that a water sealed hood is built
over the acid bath to catch the fumes,
most of which are condensed and re-
turned to the bath. The balance is
drawn out by power fans through ducts
passing through the roof of the build-
ing. The drawing in Figure 1 shows the
construction details of the water seal.
Another type of construction is found
in the chrome plating department as
well as elsewhere in the plant. Ducts are
placed along the edges of the tanks
through which the fumes are drawn off
by a forced cross draft into exhaust
pipes and carried out of the building.
Like the water sealed tanks, this type
of construction has been found thor-
oughly successful in protecting both
workers and equipment. As additional
precaution, all workers are required to
wear masks when working around cer-
tain acids whose fumes are permanent-
ly destructive to tissues in the nose and
throat.
Obviously, since the destructive ef-
fects of the acid fumes are such as to
make necessary the elaborate measures
which have been taken to prevent the
escape of the fumes, they involve a se-
rious corrosion problem in the protec-
tive equipment.
Performance of all materials, of
course, varies with the type of corrosive
conditions encountered. In the plating
department, for instance, some galva-
nized ducts have given a relatively satis-
factory performance. Other galvanized
ducts in the same department failed
within a few months. Generally it has
been the experience at the plant that
where chromic acid fumes alone are in-
volved the galvanized ducts have given
their best service. Certain of the ducts,
however, are exposed simultaneously to
fumes from both ch-omic and muriatic
acids. Where this comb!nation of cor-
rosive agents has been encountered
Monel Metal has been found suitable.
Ford profits are made in the plants.
They are built by the familiar mass pro-
duction methods which have become
synonymous with the Ford organization
and the Ford name. Anything that con-
tiibutes to speeding up the production
keeps red ink out of the profit side of
the ledger. Conversely, what hinders or
hampers production in any manner is
apt to spell loss.
From section foremen up, they all
know their costs at River Rouge and
can translate repair and maintenance
charges into terms of lost production as
well as into those of dollars and cents,
even when it comes to fume ducts. Many
of the fume lines are over one hundred
feet in length and from one foot to one
and a half feet in inside diameter. To
replace lines of this type would cost
upwards from six hundred man hours at
one dollar an hour, to say nothing of
the production delays. The first cost of
material, therefore, becomes of second-
ary importance. Performance is what
counts, since labor cos's are no h'gher

for longer lasting materials than for
those with a shorter life. Some of the
hoods over the water sealed tanks in
the picklers have been in service for four
years and have not yet reached the limit
of their useful life.
While no problems—not even corro-
sion or fume disposal problems—are
ever regarded as permanently solved at
a Ford plant, existing solutions serve
until better ones present themselves. For
the present, Ford engineers have found,
that in most cases, Monel Metal gives
very satisfactory service as a corrosion
resisting agent for their own particular
problem of acid fume disposal. Oppor-
tunity for further development in this
field of corrosive fume disposal systems
is, indeed, great. Arrangements that
even approach a satisfactory degree of
efficiency are still in their infancy, and
the future will, in all probability, wit-
ness far greater strides toward efficient
corrosive fume disposal.
© The department where tools are chrome plated illustrates the extensive system of fume ducts. They are exposed to fumes from chromic
and muriatic acids—a combination highly destructive to most metals.

GLolfe ffhcLet
and
ien5ot tu/i5tet
by
HARRY R. MEAHL
General Electric Company
THOUSANDS have circled the globe
and some of them probably had un-
usual reasons for making the trip, but
did you ever hear of anyone circling the
globe, trying to catch up with some
tensors and twist their tails? Neither
did I until I met Gabriel Kron and he
told me— but wait a minute, let's start
this story at the beginning.
Kron was born in Nagybanya, Hun-
gary, in 1901 and grew up as most boys
do. He graduated from Gymnasium
(high school) in 1919, and started try-
ing to decide what to do with himself.
The general political situation was
rather uncertain and it seemed to be
getting worse. It was so bad that Kron
and some of his acquaintances decided
that they would have to leave Hungary.
They then agreed that since they would
have to leave home, they might as well
go to the United States where they
would be free.
When they arrived in New York City,
Kron decided that he would go to col-
lege. The others were going to college
too, after they had become rich in the
manufacturing business. In the mean-
time, they were all washing dishes at a
Horn and Hardart Automat. One eve-
ning Kron went to the public library
and looked through a catalog of univer-
sities to find one which was famous,
but which did not charge too high tui-
tion fees and which was not too far
away. He chose the University of Mich-
igan where the tuition fee was $125.
He arrived in Ann Arbor with
$126.48, so he lived on bread and milk
for eight weeks before he got a job in
the Michigan Union washing dishes. He
earned his B.S. in E.E. in three busy
years during which much time was spent
digging sewers and paving streets to pay
the bills. At the same time he acquired
a high regard for mathematical physi-
cists and a love for hiking. He spent the
summer and part of the fall after gradu-
ation hiking to Los Angeles and back to
see the country. Then he worked a year
for the Jeannin Electric Company of
Toledo as a draftsman and a year for
the Robbins and Myers Company of
Springfield, Ohio, as a motor and gener-
ator designer.
In this short time and using only his
spare time he completed the ground
work of a generalized theory of electrical
machinery using vector diagrams. Such
an achievement would make many men
well satisfied with themselves, but it
had the opposite effect on him. He was
dissatisfied because he realized that no
amount of work could make vector dia-
grams capable of carrying a truly gen-
eral theory. He knew that with this
method each machine had to be con-
sidered separately, which was against
his sense of generalization.
Consequently, he set out to walk
around the world. Queer though this
may seem, it is sound psychologically.
If you are at a dead end, stop butting
your head against it and walk around
to see what it looks like from the other
side, even if you have to walk around
the world to get on the other side. Per-
haps this sounds like a remedy worse
than the disease, but it was not the way
he took it. He packed a knapsack with
a shaving kit, spare underwear and
sox, a small camera, Johnson's "Differ-
ential Equations," VVeatherburn's "Dif-

sions" and some food and started for the
South Sea Islands with a buoyant stride.
Nothing unusual happened till he
landed from an oil tanker out of Hono-
lulu at Pago Pago, Tutuila, in the Samo-
an group. When he went ashore he was
met by a Samoan about his own age
who introduced himself as Siamani
(Siamani means Germany. The island
was a German colony when he was
born) and invited Kron to be his guest.
First they walked along the beach till
they came to a stream, then they fol-
lowed a well beaten path up along the
bank through dense foliage to Siamani's
village. The days which followed passed
all too swiftly with fishing, swimming
with Fangalina, Falaninga, Kilkala and
other sunburned South sea girls, and
going from village to village visiting
relatives of Siamani. Kron embraced
all the native customs except the one of
sleeping through the middle of the day.
He spent his time with Messrs. Johnson
and Weatherburn instead, in the shadi-
est and coolest spot available, and the

feeling that he was getting closer to the
way to generalize vectors grew stronger
every day.
One day they came upon a group of
natives working on a highway. Siamani
informed him that the road had been
started in 1900 and that someday it was
to connect Pago Pago with Leone Bay,
which was about nine miles away. The
reason for the rate of progress was soon
apparent, because after working a few
minutes the whole gang gathered to-
gether for a conference, and conferences
are much the same the world over.
After spending a delightful month
with Siamani, he got a ride on a fishing
boat bound for Suva, Viti Levu, in the
Fiji Islands. He found little to interest
him in Suva, the only harbor on the
island, so he decided to walk across to
the wildest and seldom visited part. He
soon found that five miles can be a full
day's journey when you follow jungle
footpaths and swim across unfamiliar
and unfriendly rivers carrying your
clothes above your head. He also found
that the native speech reminded him of
bursts of machine gun fire, and it had
about the same effect on his nerves until
he perceived that these fierce looking
bushy-headed men were apparently a
little uneasy because of his sparse
growth. As the country became wilder,
the people became more friendly. In one
of the wildest parts he found some Hin-
du settlers who would accept no pay for
the milk and food they gave him al-
though they were squeezing a bare sub-
sistence from the soil they tilled and the
cattle they raised. On the way back to
Suva, he stopped at Nandarivatu' where
the British erected a monument to the
last missionary who was eaten. All dur-
ing this strenuous trip Kron had con-
tinued his habit of studying during the
heat of the day. Before he got back
to Suva he finished Johnson's "Differ-
ential Equations," and buried it in an
empty oil can under a palm tree with
appropriate rites.
The next stop was Sydney, Australia,
where he was fortunate in finding a job
as draftsman in the Electricity-Meter
Manufacturing Company, the only e'ec-
trical plant in Australia. His particular
job was to design a thermostat, but after
two weeks and before the design was
completed, he received a letter saying,
"Your services are no longer required."
The letter contained a check for fifty
dollars, also, and this was appreciated.
From Sydney he walked north along
the east coast through Brisbane to
Townsville. Walking in Australia was
much like that in Michigan except that
he never got a ride there because gaso-
line, pardon me, petrol, was so expensive
that everyone used a motorcycle instead
of an automobile. He noticed that most
of the buildings had corrugated iron
roofs which were used to collect rain
water, and that there was nearly always
a tramp with his "billy-can" and a
blanket over his shoulder in sight. The
settlers call these "gentlemen of the
road," "sundowners," because they in-
variably drift up to the house about sun-
down looking for work. If they are
hired and fed, they usually feel an urge
to travel just before their employer gets
up the next morning. After camping with
some of these carefree ramblers several
nights in the bush and learning that to
get something to eat it is necessary only
to go to a policeman and ask for a food
ticket which can be cashed at the near-
est government depot, Kron decided that
Australia is the paradise of tramps.
Many Chinese junks plied these
waters and Kron got rides on some of
them to Thursday Island, to Borneo and
to Manila. He was so bored with Man-
ila because it is like any American city
that he bought passage on a regular
passenger boat to Hong Kong, and
started to walk to the interior to find
something different. He walked into
Canton just in time to see the begin-
ning of a Bolshevik uprising. The be-
ginning was so swift, noisy and threat-
ening that he ran as fast as he could all
the way back to Hong Kong. His only
weapon was a ten cent knife which had
no point and very little edge. When he
got back, he wandered along the" water-
front and struck up an acquaintance
with a Norwegian ship captain who in-
vited him to go along with him to Sai-
gon. French Indo-China.
From here he followed footpaths
from village to village toward the in-
terior through about six hundred miles
of country which was so beautiful that
he fairly glows with enthusiasm when he
tries to describe the shady paths along
river banks populated with friendly vil-
lages and innumerable Buddhist mon-
asteries. He often sat up all night talk-
ing with Buddhist monks about Life and
Death. Morning always found them just
as wise as they were when the discus-
sion started, but everyone had a good
OCTOBER, 1936


to stop in a village in the middle of the
jungle where a Siamese traveling theatre
was playing. The actors and dancers
painted their faces white and performed
by torch light and fire light with the
black jungle wall for a backdrop. The
gracefulness of the dancers, which he has
never seen equalled since, together with
the thrills added to the rythmic drum-
ming and shrill piping of the orchestra
by the occasional blood-stirring trumpet-
ing of elephants foraging in the jungle
surrounding the village made this an
unforgetable night. Some time later he
met a man and a woman leading a tame
elephant, and they offered him a ride as
far as Angkor. He accepted and found
out that elephants have a better claim
to the title, "wire-haired," than dogs.
When they arrived at Angkor, he visited
the famous temple Angkor-Vat which
once occupied a square mile and has
been almost swallowed by the jungle.
There was a hotel just across from the
temple in which the cheapest room was
twenty dollars a day, so he slept in a
niche in the ruins, and was wakened
early in the morning by a troop of
monkeys who evidently resented this
intrusion.
The people inland from Angkor were
most friendly, and the fact that Kron
carried no weapons probably accounts
for much of their friendliness, because
others have not always found them so.
In fact, he usually had to stay several
days in each village because they made
his visit an occasion for feasting. His
usual procedure was to arrive at a vil-
lage about sundown and walk into the
largest house, smile, and make motions
to be allowed to sleep there. Immedi-
ately the owner would bring a mat and
some food, and gradually the whole vil-
lage would gather. One of the chief men
would then take Kron's knapsack and
unpack it. The articles would be passed
from hand to hand until everyone had
inspected them, then they were returned
to the knapsack. There was usually
someone who could speak either some
French or English, so they would ex-
change the news and speak of many
things. Thus, although the only food he
carried with him was raw onions and
canned sardines, he had chicken and
wine nearly every day.
Kron decided he would like to go to
Burma overland, but it was some time
before he found out how to do it. He
finally found an American tourist agency
in Bankok, Siam, which charged him five
dollars for the information that a cara-
van collected every other week near
Chiengmai in the northern part of Siam
to carry merchandise over the moun-
tains to Burma. He went by river boat
from Bankok to Chiengmai and found
that the information was correct. For a
few cents the leader of the caravan al-
lowed him to join it, had his knapsack
carried on a mule and threw in his meals
for good measure. For two weeks they
climbed up a narrow valley with a small
stream in the bottom. Part of the time
the narrow footpaths they followed
wound its way through luxuriant foliage
through which troops of monkeys
swarmed chattering to each other and
hurling imprecation at the wayfarers, at
times it picked its way through the

boulders beside the stream and finally it
rose rapidly across the face of a for-
bidding stony wall on its way to the
pass. By far the most cheerful of the
group were the Burmese coolies who
carried heavy bundles of merchandise
for an unbelievable pittance. Kron mar-
velled at them, and found that the
secret of their good nature was a com-
plete lack of worry, no knowledge of
tensor analysis and a primitive fullness
of the enjoyment of food and sleep. The
caravan dissolved at the first village in
Burma, and even there it was evident
that Burma is British territory because
everything was orderly. Kron followed
a river to Moulmein on the Gulf of Mar-
taban in the Bay of Bengal and took
a boat to Calcutta.
After crossing the Ganges valley from
south to north, he started climbing from
Siliguri which is at sea-level and climbed
for three days along a road which is
inclined at about thirty degrees until
he came to Darjeeling. The Taj Mahal
and other well advertised showplaces
left him cold, but the magnificent sights
at Darjeeling left even him speechless.
There, although he was thirteen thou-
sand feet above the sea, he could still
see it out there below him and when he
turned around the mysterious, awe-in-
spiring Himalayas were still towering
over him with their tops shrouded in
clouds. According to him, it is an ex-
perience everyone should have before
he dies.
He had seen Darjeeling, so he came
down and followed the Ganges through
northern India, visiting Benares, Delhi,
Lahore and other cities. He went south
from Lahore and walked about a hun-
dred miles looking for the home vil-
lage of one of his schoolmates, Nur
Muhammad Malik, who is now a physi-
cian in Detroit, but who will return to
India soon to minister to his own people.
The name of the village was Sayadwala,
and it was located in the District Be-
hind God's Back in the Punjab section
of northern India. When he found Say-
adwala, he accepted the invitation of the
chief of police to stay in the jail, be-
cause it had the only modern conven-
ience in the village. After three weeks
of continuous visiting and feasting with
the natives, he took French leave very
early one morning because the main
dish was curry and rice every day and
he was afraid the curry was going to
burn a hole in his stomach.
He happened to strike an acquaint-
ance with a railroad engineer who was
English and found that engineers and
firemen like having congenial company
on their runs even though it is against
regulations. Thereafter, he rode in loco-
motive cabs till he got to Karachi. From
there he took a boat to Basra which
was on the Euphrates River near the
head of the Persian Gulf. On the way
to Baghdad, he stopped to visit the ruins
of ancient Babylon, but he could see lit-
tle of the splendor of old in the ragged
ditches that remained. He had dug bet-
ter ones in Ann Arbor. He caught a
ride on a truck from Baghdad to Da-
mascus, Syria, and walked from there
to Palestine, which impressed him as
a country full of stones. It seemed evi-

IF ONE peer through the telescope of
the anthropologist down the "Long
Road" of Life he can observe when, how
and why man's distant ancestors for-
sook the road called "Instinct" and
elected to travel apart from all other
creatures the highway of Reason.
The decision to travel the new high-
way was a momentous one. One may
well speculate as to whether man's an-
cestors would have taken it had they
been able to see forward clearly as far
as we may now see backward. Be that
as it may the "why" of their decision is
interesting. They were as inexorably
subject to Law I of Life as all other
creatures; that they should strive cease-
lessly to endure. Thus the forces of
hunger, emotionalism, and sex domi-
nated all of their behavior. But they
were ill equipped with strength, speed,
teeth, claws or armor to solve their ever
present problems of subsistence and de-
fense. They were happy only in the pos-
session of extraordinary eyes and paws.
Not much apparently on which to base
a decision as to a mode of life; but it
was sufficient.
It is not expected that the small de-
fenseless creature which elected to stake
all on being able to meet Law I of Life
through the use of its extraordinary
eyes and paws would meet spectacular
success on the highway of Reason at
once. By no means. But the new formula
of meeting life through observation,
testing, and determination of the how,
why, when, and what of all of nature
proved so profitable for this one and
only one creature that only a few of his
descendants left the highway of Reason
and returned to the by-paths and side
roads of instinct.
Eventually this lonely traveler learned
not only where and when the food he
liked grew, but he learned how nature
grew it and that he could manage the
process. And he learned to communi-
cate what he had experienced to others
through the use of sounds. He used a
sharp stone to cut, a pointed one to
pierce and a heavy blunt one to crush
or deform. He employed a lever or

ment of Engineering Drawing
wedge to move heavier loads than his
mere hands could accomplish. He em-
ployed a vine or a stick to apply his
force at a distance. These were all of
the tools and implements possible, but
they were entirely ample.
Finally this creature, through careful
observation, testing, and much ponder-
ing comprehended the laws of the uni-
verse, the forces of nature, and the com-
position of all of the substances about
him. One would like to believe that at
least he was in command of his own
destiny. But the anthropologist, who is
a very wise individual and does not ex-
pect too much from even this extraor-
dinary creature, advises caution. The
ancestors of those creatures who de-
serted the road of instinct for that of
reason had traveled the road of all other
creatures for a very long time; hun-
dreds of millions of years. And one's
chances against heredity are very small
indeed. So while this extraordinary crea-
ture called man has traveled the road
of Reason so long that reason has be-
come science and science the sum total
of reason, the forces of hunger, emo-
tionalism and sex are so great and reach
so far back into his evolutionary life
that men have shown throughout re-
corded time how delicate is the balance
between reason and their primitive in-
stinct.

WHERE DO engineers go and
what kinds of jobs do they get?
How do they get there? Who employs
them and what kind of work do they
do? To answer these questions and
many more the United States Bureau
of Labor Statistics, at the request of,
and with the co-operation of the Ameri-
can Engineering Council, recently un-
dertook the largest and most compre-
hensive survey of the engineering pro-
fession ever made.
A questionnaire was sent out to 173,-
151 engineers whose names were ob-
tained through national, state and local
engineering societies, state boards of
examiners, and deans of engineering
colleges. The objective of this vast sur-
vey was to determine how engineers had
fared during the depression period. More
specifically, its purpose was to find the
extent of unemployment, where substi-
tute employment was found, and what
engineers' salaries had been between
December 31, 1929, and December 31,
1934. Further information regarding
education and experience was requested
to provide a more comprehensive back-
ground for the survey.
The first of the results of this sur-
vey were published in the June 1936
Monthly Labor Review and subsequent-
ly in a Department of Labor Bulletin.
Out of 173,151 questionnaires sent out,
52,589, or 30.4 percent, were returned
with usable information. From these re-
plies engineers were grouped into nine
professional classes: agricultural, archi-
tectural, ceramic, chemical, civil, elec-
trical, industrial, mechanical, and min-
ing and metallurgical engineering.
Since our engineering college has no
departments of agricultural, architec-
tural, ceramic, or mining and metallur-
gical engineering—ceramic and metal-
lurgical courses are incorporated in the
chemical engineering department, and
architectural engineering is classified in

the school of architecture—these classes
need not be considered here. Likewise,
the number of industrial engineers is so
small and their course so closely allied
with mechanical engineering that this
class can also be omitted. The remain-
ing, chemical, civil, electrical and me-
chanical engineers, comprise 31,523, or
60 percent of all those replying to the
questionnaire. The civils lead the list
with 44.2 percent of the group; next are
the mechanicals with 27.8 percent; the
electricals represent 21.0 percent; and
the chemicals 7.0 percent.
How are these four classes of engi-
neers distributed in industry? Figure 1
shows the allocation of these profes-
sional classes into various "fields of
activity." Government work is, at pres-
ent, occupying 63.3 percent of the civil
engineers. This abnormally high num-
ber is probably due to the fact that gov-
ernment hydro-electric and building
programs alone have been continuous,
while other construction has been very
slow for the past several years. Manu-
facturing is handled jointly by mechani-
cals, chemicals and electricals. and the
electricals direct most of the public utili-
ty work. Civils find some employment
in private construction work. Personal
service employing over 2,000 of these
31,523 engineers, includes some types
of consulting and teaching.
However, "field of activity'' only half
defines the engineer's work—the function
he performs in his field tells the rest of
the story. The Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics has grouped engineers into seven
"functional classes," as shown in figure
2. Seventy-five percent of all chemical,
civil, electrical and mechanical engi-

"functional classes": Design and Re-
search, Construction, and Operation.
Eighty-two and one half percent of the
chemicals are occupied on one of these
three classes; 80.0 percent of the civils;
72.8 percent of the electricals; and 79.3
percent of the mechanicals. The other
"functional classes," General Adminis-
tration and Management, Consulting,
Teaching and Sales, absorb a decidedly

minor number of engineers. Consider
then, only those men performing one of
these three functions: Design and Re-
search, Construction, or Operation. Fig-
ure 3 shows the relative numbers of
men working in each of these three ca-
pacities. All classes appear to be domi-
nated by one or two of these three
functions—chemicals do more operative
work than anything else; civils are oc-
cupied chiefly with construction; elec-
tricals also do much work in operation;
and, mechanicals specialize largely in
design and research. Nevertheless, the
profession as a whole is balanced so
that there are nearly equal numbers in
each of the three big "functional
classes."
These figures all show where and how
engineers, with from one to forty-odd
years of experience, are situated in the
profession and in industry. What is hap-
pening to engineers still younger—those
just graduating? Last June our engi-
neering college graduated, with B.S. de-
grees, 120 men in chemical, civil elec-
trical and mechanical engineering; 48 in
mechanical, 37 in chemical, 27 in elec-
trical and 18 in civil. Four of these men
are returning to their native countries.
Fourteen percent, or 17 men are re-
mechanicals are in this group. No word
turning for graduate work, 21.6 percent
of the chemicals and 6.2 percent of the
has been received from 6 men so it is
not known whether they have jobs. The
rest, 99 or 82.5 percent, are now em-
ployed in engineering jobs. Figure 4
shows the "fields of activity" of the
June 1936, B.S.E. graduates. Where
these June graduates are employed is
shown on the graph; how they are em-
ployed is yet to be determined. What
functions will they perform in their
various "fields of activity"? Many men
will be required to fill the needs in de-
sign and research, construction, and op-
eration. Lesser in number but of hard-
ly less importance are the jobs in con-
sulting, general administration and man-
agement, teaching, and sales.

than steam engines, or prefer chemistry
to electricity may determine whether

PROFESSION
A BLEACHING and dyeing corpo-
*. *. ration which handled thousands
of yards of very delicate textile products
ran into difficulty with its reels of wire
screen mounted on cast iron frames.
The material was processed as well as
sold by the yard, in continuous lengths;
it had to be handled with the greatest
of care since any damage during manu-
facture resulted in the waste of much
costly material. Particularly difficult,
was the dyeing operation: the fabric
was wound on reels, several hundred
yards at a time and these reels im-
mersed in dye vats and revolved during
the necessary penetration period. Orig-
inally, the reels used were, as previously
stated, of wire screen mounted on a cast
iron frame. This arrangement provided
for ample penetration of the dye but
the fabric continually became entangled

at the joints of the screen, either during
the initial winding or when it was taken
off subsequent to the dyeing process.
With this method, a constant loss item
had to be computed as a part of pro-
duction costs. Finally, a method was
devised. A sheet of number 18 gauge,
nickel alloy steel was perforated with
.'?4-inch square holes along a 1 inch
center line. The perforated sheet was
formed into a cylinder, smooth side out,
and a perforated strip was welded along
the seam. Circular segments, three to
each cylinder, were then welded in place,
one on each end and one in the center,
resulting in a rigid reel which would
not contaminate or polute the dye and
which would not catch or tear the mate-
rial. The new reels were so successful
that they were adopted throughout the
entire plant.

GENTLEMEN: YOUR TORCH
ATTENTION! FRESHMEN AND
SOPHOMORES who have not as
yet been initiated into the mystic mias-
ma of Metal Processing 2! In the near
future you are going to be placed face
to face with a shiny oxy-acetylene torch
—then what? — well, here is a little
theory.
Welding is no hit-or-miss affair. A
great deal of research has been done on
the problem and today modern methods
make a good many things possible: com-
plicated piping systems are
easily installed, the internal
structure of the wings of
large, all-metal aircraft is a
welding job; Germany sur-
prised the world by making
her "vest pocket battle-
ships" without a rivet, us-
ing electric welding through-
out and thus saving several
thousand pounds and re-
maining within treaty lim-
its.
Theory and practice
have it that the most eco-
nomical and strongest weld
is the butt-weld; however, circumstances
sometimes make it mandatory to em-
ploy other methods, notably the fillet
weld. Fillet welds, because of the man-
ner in which they are employed, must
be designed to withstand both shear and
tension. Thus, in A in the accompany-
ing sketch, we have a in tension and b
in shear. The function of the weld is to
transfer the load from the upper plate
to the lower, and to achieve this end
the weld must have the proper cross-
section and length. In any case, the
materials so welded must remain in com-
plete contact since any appreciable
bending will result in increased stresses
within the weld and will consequently
weaken the joint. Also, the welding ma-
terial must have a unit tensile strength
equal to or greater than the unit tensile
strength of the plates or pipe being
bound. The sketch depicts two types
of fillet weld, full and normal, their
chief difference being that the full fillet
is best suited to transfer loads in ten-
sion, whereas the normal increases the
strength of the joint in shear. In either
method, the strength of the weld is de-
termined by the thickness of the weld
or the "throat" (as it is called by men
behind the blow torches) and by the
carbon content of the steel plates. So,
gentlemen, when Mr. Telfer gives you
that torch—try not to set the shop on
fire.

HPHE ENGINEER is confronted with
*• two problems in the design or con-
struction of any machine or project: is
it physically and technically possible to
construct?—is it economically feasible?
The latter element, the item of costs
and profits is the dominating feature in
a system of free private enterprise such
as ours. It is true that some works are
completed in the face of the knowledge
that profit will not be realized or that
costs will not be covered. The Panama
Canal is such a project, neglecting, of
course, the invisible incomes to Ameri-
can society of greater military security
and lower prices of commodities subss-
quent to lower transportation costs.
The complete analyzation of all the
costs—human, social, and technical—is
something which the student engineer,
as a rule, is not required to do. A care-
ful study of all the economic ramifica-
tions of a proposed project often makes
the project possible. Here is our sub-
ject: where has economy of manufac-
ture, procedure or sale of excess or by-
product made production or construc-
tion possible? From the experiences of
our faculty we have obtained many such
cases.
Professor Harry Bouchard's experi-
ence with hydro-electric work in the
South gives us our first case. The engi-
neers' problem in this instance was one
of making a profit rather than any out-
of-the-ordinary technical features. To
begin with, a cost and construction sur-
vey was made over the territory to be
affected or served by the proposed
power plant. This work was done by
two industrial engineers, a type of engi-
neer which has been used before and
since to give construction and designing
engineers accurate working estimates.
The physical aspects of the job were
interesting in that streams being
dammed were relatively flat, requiring a
rather extensive back-water area to give
the power plant the necessary head.
Also, the watershed draining to the dam
was subject to alternate low and high
water periods. This was where the
engineers ran into a practical example
of economics—an example that might
have been used by Professor Peterson
some sleepy Wednesday morning. Any
power-plant must be designed to ac-
commodate the the peak-load users (a
nasty phrase borrowed right out of Eco-
nomics 54). This particular plant, be-
cause of the varying head of water, pre-
sented a little difficulty in estimating
output. After some deliberation, an
estimate was made of the probable in-
come to be derived from the sale of the
produced power. The combined output
of the five turbines would be approxi-
mately 13,000 hp. This could be sold
to various users at around $22 per hp.
year—giving a gross return of $286,000,
a sum that hardly covered incurred
costs. Now, capital is not invested be-
cause its owners become bored with its
propinquity and dams are not built
merely to give engineers a chance to
stroll around in knee boots, profits must
be realized and if this dam could not
come through with a comfortable divi-
dend for the stockholders the project
would never get beyond the blue-print
stage. However the engineers overcame
the difficulty of providing dividends by
exploiting the nature of the streams'
flow. Late in the fall and well into the
new year the watershed was subject to
severe floods—harnessing these waters,
as the proposed dam would do, would
result in an excess power production al-
most equal to that produced by the reg-
ular flow of the streams. Now the engi-
neers had solved the problem of pro-
viding sufficient power to make the dam
pay—providing that the excess power
was sold, next problem, marketing the
power. The power produced by the reg-
ular flow of the streams was to be sold
to a trolley line, a light plant and to do-
mestic users; these groups could not be
expected to consume this excess power
and to create the necessary dividends.
Still undaunted, the engineers set about
finding power customers. The country
that was so situated that it might be
served by the plant was a rich cotton
area and the cotton was usually har-
vested late in the fall. The engineers
saw the connection and contracted sev-
eral mills for power, specifying that the
supply of electricity was not to be
constant. The mills were not equipped
to use electric power but the rate offered
them by the hydro-electric plant made
it pay them to electrify their equipment.
Still, these cotton mills were not suffi-
cient to consume all the excess power,
so our versatile engineers managed to
convince outside capital to invest in cot-
ton seed mills within the power area
and sold them the remaining power. The
offer made to the seed mills was neces-
sarily attractive; the regular customers
paid the constant costs, the new custo-
mers exploited the excess capacity of the
plant and were merely a variable cost
item—thus they were able to obtain
lower rates and the project still netted
$125,000 a year to its stockholders.
Nor were the engineers forgetful of the
future: they designed the dam so that
five more tubines could be readily in-
stalled, and at present they are all in
operation, again creating an income for
the project without greatly increasing
the constant costs.

SPOTLIGHT

Willis Hawkins
CRAFTSMAN
IT HAS been said, "When a man
builds a better mousetrap than his
neighbor, the whole world will make a
beaten pathway to his door." Although
Willis M. (for
Moore) Hawkins
is not in the
mousetrap busi-
ness, the world
has, figuratively,
beaten a pathway
to his door, be-
cause of his out-
standing ability
as a craftsman.
Willis came to
us from Kansas
City, Missouri, via St. Louis, Traverse
City and Leelanau Prep. While in St.
Louis he started his hobby of building
models, especially models of aircraft.
Having won medals and prizes for this
sort of work, his fame followed him to
Michigan, and when the University Mu-
seum wanted a model of an airplane
that would simulate the shape of a bird
in flight, Willis Hawkins was picked to
do the job. He designed and built a
model of a soaring glider, which now
hangs as a permanent exhibit in the
University Museum. The aeronautical
engineering department was so im-
pressed with the job that they would
not rest until Will had built them a
duplicate model which is now hanging
in the aero display cabinet in the lobby
of East Engineering Building. Another
job recently undertaken by him, was
the design of the paint job on Bob
Auburn's new utility glider, "Sunspot"
which was accredited the most beauti-
fully finished ship at The National Soar-
ing Contest, held at Elmira, New York,
this year.
Though model building is his hobby,
Willis loses no time in school because of
it. After attending Illinois College for
two years, he transferred to the Univer-
sity of Michigan. He has been working
his way through school, but found time
to act on the membership committee of

the Aero division of the A.S.M.E. until
that body was absorbed by the student
branch of the Institute of the Aeronauti-
cal Sciences, over which group he now
presides. His high scholastic average
and campus activity gave Willis his Tau
Beta Phi bent and Vulcan anvil. Little
Willie, keep it up.
MAN-ABOUT-CAMPUS
IT MUST have been a fine, sunny
morning on that March 24th of so
many years ago when Benny Cox first
saw the light of day, for he seems, ever
since, to have
kept some of that
vernal cheer in
his eyes and in
his smile. Born
in Terre Haute,
he has made his
home there ever
since. Completing
his prep-school
education there,
he came to Ann
Arbor with little
to distinguish himself from the other
freshmen engineers. However, not much
time had elapsed before our hero, by
virtue of exceptional scholarship and
whole-hearted interest in campus activi-
ties, became quite the man of his class.
His class-mates were not slow in recog-
nizing these qualities in our Benny: in
his freshman year he was elected to Phi
Eta Sigma, the Freshman Honor Socie-
ty, later becoming president. For two
years he acted as member of the Honor
Committee; by this time, the snowball
of Benny's success was gaining impetus
and increasing in size very rapidly. Dur-
ing his junior year he was successively
elected to Tau Beta Pi, the Engineering
Honor Fraternity, to Triangles, the
Junior Honor Society, and to Vulcans,
the Senior Honor Society. Socially, Ben-
ny was way ahead of the professed big-
wigs on the other side of the campus,
leaving them far behind by his election
to the office of J-Hop Chairman last
year. A member of Phi Kappa Psi,
Ben found his brothers electing him
president of that fraternity, making his
string of offices held and holding even
longer and more imposing but leaving
Benny as smiling and modest as ever.
Benny is registered in the combined En-
gineering-Law Curriculum so we prob-
ably will see very little of him this com-
ing year but if there are any big-doings
going on we will hear that Benny is
right in the thick of it. Ben's answer to
the secret of his success is: "Oh, that's
an easy game." Well, good luck, Benny!
Keep playing that easy game, and if
you have the time, come over and teach
us the rules.
LLOYD STRICKLAND
NOTHING much is known about
that strong silent hero who won-
ders around the campus here and calls
himself Lloyd Strickland, but the truth
will out so here
it is.
Everybody
knows that
"Strick" was
Vice-President of
his class during
his first year and
that h e was
tapped for the
Triangles, but
that is an old
story. Character-
istic of all still water, plenty of life ex-
ists way down deep. The Good Lord
supplied ample brain matter beneath
that curly top of his or we wouldn't see
that Tau Beta key dangling from his
watch chain. Proof of his executive abil-
ity is found in the fact that this year he
will control the financial destiny of the
Michigan 'Ensian in the capacity of
Business Manager. For this latter feat,
and perhaps because they needed some-
body to grind the corn, Michigauma got
ahold of his scalp last spring and chris-
tened him "Papoosi."
Lloyd is going into the clothes busi-
ness this winter, specializing in evening
dress. With his personality and business
ability, don't be surprised to find Michi-
gan rated near the top when it comes to
possessing the best dressed men. One
of the least of his troubles is finding
friends, and he is one of the Sigma Chi's
prides and joys.
In keeping with his likes on the far
side of the campus, the business ad
school will find his name on their en-
rollment this year.

JONES HAS AN INTERVIEW
AS AN undergraduate, Jones acquir-
ed a deep interest in labor prob-
lems. He hoped that, as an engineer,
he would also have a chance to improve
employer-employee relationships. These
are laudable objectives, and we wish
more students would actively entertain
such ideas.
As a senior, Jones was interviewed by
the recruiter for a large company. He
was not offered a job. He came to me
to get me to help him guess why he was
turned down. Having no inside in-
formation, I asked Jones what happen-
ed in the interview. It soon developed
that Jones had asked the recruiter what
his company's labor policies might be.
Now, Jones' ambition to remedy ex-
isting evils was a fine thing; but a man
who proposes to save the world had
better know what the world is like. He
learns by observation, discussion, and
reading. And either he takes liberal
doses of newspaper reading, or else he
won't know enough about the world to
know what needs to be saved.
If Jones had read the papers, armed
with a real interest in social reform, he
would already have known that the
company was notoriously unable to
escape labor difficulties. Only a short
time before, the papers had told of an-
other impending strike. Three facts
stand out.
First, Jones should already have
known of the company's difficulties to
some extent. Second, if he had de-
liberately tried to find a sure way of
putting the recruiter on the spot, he
would have selected just the question
he brought up. Third, while proper
and fully in order under the right cir-
cumstances, the question was practical-
ly out of order under the conditions of
this interview.
The recruiter's time was limited, as
Jones knew. All of the quarter hour
would be needed for bringing out the
tangible and intangible factors that en-
able a recruiter to decide whether to
make an offer. In fact, Jones needed
a longer interview than most, due to
having taken a special course that con-
siderably narrowed his services, and
having therefore an unusual job of sell-
ing himself. Yet he opened a question
that promptly bogged down the inter-
view, and used most of the available
time.
A senior who wishes to serve in in-
dustrial and social reform must culti-
vate tact and good judgment in high
degree. When Jones stepped in with
his question, he displayed lack of both
qualities. A good recruiter would at
once recognize the symptoms and act
accordingly.
Many a young man acquires tact and
judgment through getting some bumps.
Jones got bumped. We hope he learned.
At any rate, it is good to be able to re-
port that he soon placed himself with
an excellent company, in which his tech-
nical training and interests will find
plenty of outlet. Also, his employers
are leaders in dealing humanely and in-
telligently with employees.

IT'S WELDED
The appearance, sturdiness and cleanli-
ness of the modern aluminum tea kettle,
illustrate why many good products are bet-
ter if they are welded.
The word "welded" is packed with mean-
ing. It means light-weight without sacrifice
of strength. It means sturdiness and rugged-
ness that can never shake loose. It means
invisible joints as strong as the base metal.
It means smooth surfaces with no place for
corrosion to start. In short it means all that
one piece construction can mean plus com-
plete design freedom from the limitations
of most other methods of metal fabrication.
Tomorrow's engineers will be expected to
know how to apply this modern metal-
working process to a wide range of metals—
steel and iron, aluminum, copper, brass and
all other alloys and metals, even platinum.
Technical booklets describing the applica-

arrived he found that the news that he
was returning from America the golden
with sixty thousand dollars had got
there ahead of him, and nearly every-
one was out to see him come home.
When they found that he was not rich,
their enthusiasm cooled and froze into
ridicule for the man who came home
ragged from the richest country in the
world.
While he was visiting his relatives
and old friends, he renewed his ac-
quaintance with a young lady and found
that she was studying to become a doc-
tor of medicine and that she was hav-
ing a little difficulty with a course in
physics. Kron deserted tensors for a
while and tutored her through me-
chanics, sound, heat, light, magnetism,
and when they reached electricity, they
were engaged.
Some time later he returned to the
United States and did research work on
welding machines for the Lincoln Elec-
tric Company. A little later, he went
with the Westinghouse Company at
Springfield, Massachusetts, to do special
development work. While he was there
he received an offer from the Warner
Brothers who wanted him to do special
consulting engineering in their labora-
tory at three times his salary. He did
not want to make a change, but the
temptation was too great, and with the
approval of his employers, he took the
offer. After a short time, the Depres-
sion struck and Warner Brothers was
immersed in a sea of red ink, so there
was no one left to consult him.
Instead of warming a park bench and
waiting for something to turn up, he
went to the New York Public Library
where, to his great delight he found
many books on Differential Geometry,
Tensor Analysis, the Unified Field The-
ory of Relativity Dynamics, and others
on higher Mathematics. After months of
careful study and comparison, he found
a similarity of form and content be-
tween the equations of a mass particle
having a unit electric charge moving in
the non-euclidian space of the theory
of relativity of Einstein and those of
rotating electrical machinery, which is
also a moving mass carrying electric
conductors and cutting a magnetic field.
He put the results of this work in an
article, "Non-Riemannian Dynamics of
Rotating Electrical Machinery,"*
which was published by the Journal of
Mathematics and Physics in May 1934.
This article attracted the attention of
some General Electric officials, and they
invited him to join the Engineering
General Department in Schenectady. He
accepted and is now playing with the
quantum equations of Dirac and Schro-
dinger in the belief that engineers should
get into much better company: i.e., that
of Einstein, Veblen and other super-
highbrows. He claims earnestly that
their writings are much easier to un-
derstand than any text on the theory
of the single phase induction motor he
ever studied, and he studied all the 57
varieties of theories. To further this end,
he is writing a series of articles, "The
Application of Tensors to the Analysis
of Rotating Electrical Machinery," for
the General Electric Review, and he
just finished another article, "Quasi-
Holonomic Dynamical Systems," for the
magazine, Physics. The first of the Gen-
eral Electric Review articles appeared,
quite fittingly, in the Steinmetz Me-
morial Issue, February 1935, and there
are many more yet to come.

Section of the Bituminous and Chemical Laboratory of the Highway Materials
Laboratory
The University long ago sensed the importance of highways and, in cooperation with the Michigan State Highway Depart-
ment, established a group of laboratories for the testing and study of highway materials. It is self-evident that the mate-
rials of construction must conform to high standards if highways are to withstand the pounding, shoving and wear of traffic
and, at the same time, the destructive forces of nature, Cements must be strong and durable, sands and gravels must not
disintegrate when subjected to rapidly recurring sequences of wetting and drying, freezing and thawing. Asphalts and tars
are required to be good binders but cannot be too brittle nor too soft, lest the pavements crack in winter or distort under
traffic in summer.
Concrete, asphalt and road-oil mixtures all receive attention, not only to insure that present construction is good, but to
improve on the best which has thus far been produced.
In the laboratories where State Highway Department employees carry on routine tests and research, University students re-
ceive instruction and, if so inclined, may investigate special problems in materials and paving mixtures.

BIGGER AND BETTER TURBINES
The new 110,000-kilowatt turbine-generator, built
by General Electric and recently placed in service
in the River Rouge plant of the Ford Motor Com-
pany, sets several new records in turbine construc-
tion.
It is the first large unit in the world to operate at 1200
pounds pressure and at 900 Fahrenheit. Although
the weight is approximately 2,000,000 pounds, it is
so compact that it occupies less than a cubic foot
for each kilowatt of output. Because of its extremely
high efficiency, less than a pound of coal is needed
to generate a kilowatt-hour of electric energy.
The new turbine is a vertical compound machine
with the high-pressure turbine and generator mounted
directly above the low-pressure unit. Superheated
steam enters the upper unit at 12 pounds and 900
degrees. After producing 55,000 kilowatts, the steam
flows directly into the low-pressure unit where it
produces another 55,000 kilowatts before it is
exhausted to the condenser. This is the first 1200-
pound turbine in which the steam enters the low-
pressure stage without reheating.
The work of designing, constructing, testing, and
installing great turbines, such as this, is the accom-
plishment of hundreds of graduates of technical
colleges and universities—men who are also gradu-
ates of the G-E Test.

ELECTRIC HEAT FOR SOILLESS GARDENS
California nurserymen are growing tomatoes, straw-
berries, and sweet peas in chemically treated water
heated by electricity. The method, developed by
Dr. W. F. Gericke, of the University of California,
has been extended to commercial installations.
Tomato plants, grown in this way, produced un-
usually high-quality tomatoes. The yield was large,
and they matured ahead of tomatoes grown in soil.
Nourishment for the plants is provided by special
chemicals dissolved in the water. Because the water
temperature must be accurately maintained, a
controllable heat source is required, and General
Electric engineers have supplied heating cable and
thermostats both for the experimental installation
and for commercial installations which have fol-
lowed.

IT'S WELDED
Welding eliminates overlapping joints in
the modern tank car. This materially re-
duces dead weight and makes the car easier
to clean and maintain. It completely pre-
vents loss or contamination of the contents
from rusted joints.
Tomorrow's engineers will be expected to
know how to apply the oxy-acetylene proc-
ess of welding and cutting in design, con-
struction and fabrication to give similar
sales advantages to many good products.
The word "welded" is packed with mean-
ing. It means light-weight without sacrifice
of strength. It means sturdiness and rugged-
ness that can never shake loose. It means
invisible joints as strong as the base metal.
It means smooth surfaces with no place for
corrosion to start. In short it means all that
one piece construction can mean plus com-
plete design freedom from the limitations
of other methods of fabrication.
Technical booklets describing the appli-
cation of this modern metal-working proc-
ess to a wide range of metals—steel and
iron, aluminum, copper, brass and many
other alloys and metals are available, with-
out obligation, from any Linde Office. Write

SIX CUBIC YARDS PER GULP
The dredging industry has recently acquired a new
clam-shell bucket. The shovel, one of the largest of its
kind, was specially designed to withstand the extremely
severe service that will be met in underwater dredging
operations. The metal used in its fabrication was a high
strength, mild-alloy, chromium-manganese steel—a mouth
full of adjectives, but it gives the requisite strength and
lightness. The bucket stands 17 feet high and weighs 30,000
pounds when empty. It is almost an all-welded job result-
ing in an appreciable reduction of weight plus lower
maintenance costs—at six cubic yards per gulp work will
proceed in large chunks.

ROBERT BEALS, '39E
GLASS has always presented unique
problems to men who are ambitious
enough to attempt the manufacture of
large units. Expansion characteristics
have given the abused ceramic engineer

many acute headaches, so naturally
when industry presented its demand for
a glass brick with which to build walls,
the glass manufacturers must have felt
like resigning themselves to a very pain-
ful fate. When
architects further
insisted that
these bricks be of
artistic appear-
ance, it amount-
ed to adding in-
sult to injury.
However, with
their usual non-
chalance, the en-
gineers went to work.
In selecting a size for their glass
block, the objective was to find one
which was convenient to handle, easy
to manufacture, and still large enough
to avoid an excess number of unsightly
joints. These joints decrease the amount
of light admitted, especially when
viewed at an angle. The finally accepted
size emphasises the special qualities of
glass and has a scale distinctly in har-
mony with contemporary architecture.
It also simplifies designing and estimat-
ing, since the eleven and three fourths
inch dimension plus a one fourth inch
joint makes a twelve inch unit.
Class takes on a new role
as a brick. But, these new
glass bricks are not at all
like ordinary building blocks;
the scientifically designed
fluting on the inside faces
of the unit provides an
ever-changing decorative ef-
fect—high diffusion of light
— obscure images — and,
produces no lens effect.

were to be derived from making the unit
in two square dishes and sealing them
together at a high temperature. The
greatest saving was the result of a de-
crease in the amount of transmitted
heat. The overall coefficient of thermal
conductivity for a fifteen mile per hour
wind is .4 B.T.U. per square foot per
degree F. per hour. The same coefficient
for ordinary window glass is 1.13
B.T.U. per degree F. per hour.
Additional reduction in transmit-
ted heat can be obtained bp placing
insulating strips in the joints. Tests
show that a wall of these units will
transmit only about 40% of the radiant
heat falling upon it. This means an in-
creased resistance to the sun's rays in
summer and decreased heat loses in
winter. Other tests based on weather
conditions in the New York area show
that a saving of one ton of coal per sea-
son for each 100 sq. ft. of area would be
effected. The sealing of the block at 2,000
degrees F. increases the permanence of
the block and eliminates condensation
of moisture inside by insuring dry air.
A beautiful effect is gained by mold-
ing a design on the inside of the block.
Different effects are obtained by viewing
from various angles. These are obtained
as a result of pressing vertical flutes on
one wall and horizontal flutes on the
opposite one. All images seen thru the
blocks are completely obscured without
appreciably decreasing the amount of
light transmitted. This unit transmits
78% of the light directed at one surface.
The corresponding figure for plate glass
is about 90%. The glare or brightness
is reduced to about 11.6% of the bright-
ness of the same light before it passes
thru the block. Thus, a panel of three
units supplies a soft, evenly distributed,
and glareless light.
The most important factor in a build-
ing material is, of course, the strength.
While the compressive strength of glass
may be very high, the impact strength
is usually correspondingly low. As a
result, there is a very good chance that
one or more units will be cracked or
broken by impact. The glass construc-
tion units illustrated here have the
added advantage of being very easily
replaced. They are assembled with a
Portland cement 1-1-6 mix. Because of
the low absorption of glass for water,
this is mixed as dry as possible. This
method gives desirable weather-proofing
qualities. In case of a broken unit, the
glass and mortar is chipped out, and
another unit is inserted. Very little ex-
pense is involved in this operation.
The Pyrex glass of which these units
are constructed is found to have a work-
ing tensile strength of 10,000 lbs. per
sq. in. In compression it has withstood
pressures up to 170,000 lbs. per sq. in.
The shape of the unit reduces this
strength considerably. Tests run ac-
cording to TM specifications showed
that the minimum cracking pressure in
a hydraulic press was 11,500 lbs. per
unit. No unit collapsed up to 60,000
!bs., which was the capacity of the press.
Using a safety factor of two, it is safe
to assume that the blocks will not crack
b low a pressure of 5,750 lbs. per unit.
This means that it would be possible to
build a wall of these units 600 feet high
without danger of them giving away un-
der their own weight. The impact
strength is three foot pounds. This
does not take into consideration the
fact that when the unit is installed in
the wall, a percentage of the shock will
be absorbed by the wall.
This new use of an old building ma-
terial promises to introduce new possi-
bilities to both the engineer and the
architect. The wide variation in pos-
sible designs leads us to think that im-
provement will follow the acceptance
of the idea by large builders. With these
things in mind, one might predict a
new type of building to house the peo-
ple of the near future.

AMONG the achievements of mod-
ern engineering, none is more
spectacular than the great turbo-gener-
ator of the central power station. It is
little short of appalling to contemplate
the tremendous energy flow through one
of these machines. An 80,000 kw. unit,
operating at full load, is developing the
power of over 100,000 horses. The tur-
bine has no control over the load im-
posed upon it, which may drop to
60,000 kw. without warning. Unless
there is immediate readjustment of the
Balance between the load and the rate
of energy supply, catastrophic results
are certain to ensue.
The Governor is the instrumentality
that maintains the necessary equilib-
rium between the forces involved at all
times. It stands watchful guard over
the flow of energy, alert to discern the
slightest unbalance between load and
energy supply. When the load changes
much or little, the speed of the turbine
begins to change, thus furnishing the
evidence by which the governor be-
comes aware that the rate of energy
supply is no longer in perfect adjust-
ment to the load, and giving the signal
for the initiation of immediate steps to
restore equilibrium by changing the rate
of steam flow, and so reestablishing the
Balance between energy supply and
load demand.
Through its governor, the turbine be-
comes able to adapt itself to the varying
vicissitudes of a load over which it has
no control, and capable of harmonoius
cooperatoin with other units of its sys-
tem. Without a governor, the finest
unit in the world would be unfit to en-
gage in the business for which it was
created. It would totally lack the power
to adapt itself to its load—to maintain
that necsesary Balance between its pow-
ers and its environment.
A governor confers upon its unit the
attribute of conduct or behavior. A good
governor insures a minimum departure
from an orderly state of Balance be-
tween opposing forces; a poor one keeps
its unit in a constant state of turmoil,
with adjustments never quite effectually
made or maintained, and with the ever-
present threat of some destructive hap-
pening. A poorly governed unit lacks
the quality of Balance, and fails to in-
spire confidence in operation.
Man's environment is infinitely more
complex than that of a turbine, but in
his individual adjustment to it, the same
fundamentals of governing are neces-
sary. There must be a sensory system
to discern departure from equilibrium
between internal and external forces:
and a control that responds promptly to
restore that equilibrium. Only by the
alertness of the one, and the certainty
of action of the other, can that constant
Balance be maintained between the
powers of the individual and the various
factors of his environment, which in-
spires self-confidence and develops poise
in character and personality.

AMONG the four principal func-
tional classifications of engineer-
ing (namely, design, construction, op-
eration and research) what is the field
of the designing engineer, and what are
the types of problems with which he is
confronted? Lest the thought arise,
that, as a civil engineer he is con-
cerned chiefly with beam formulas, or
;is a mechanical engineer, with the
stresses in shafts and gears, or as an
electrical engineer with IR drop or as
a chemical engineer with evaporatoin
efficiency, let us attempt a definition.
The designing engineer is one who ap-
plies the art and science of engineering
in planning the ways and means by

which the resources of nature are util-
ized and controlled for the benefit of
man. The American Society of Civil
Engineers includes, within its statement
of qualifications to design, the ability
to undertake investigations, to carry out
important assignments demanding re-
sourcefulness and originality, to make
plans and to write specifications, all in
such manner as will meet the exigencies
of the case, fulfill the requirements of
local circumstances and conditions to
the end that the plan, when executed,
will successfully serve the purpose of
the design. In the opinion of this so-
ciety as with others, design is the high-
est classification of professional prac-
tice.
In this larger sense, the designing en-
gineer may find himself in one or more
of the stages of development of a pro-
ject that follow:
a. the concept of an idea
b. the investigation of the feasibility
of its development
c. the drafting of a comprehensive
plan of development
d. the promotion of the project

NOVEMBER, 1936


\fetal Progress
The designer, or his inseparable other
self, the research engineer, may have a
hand in the first step; he is certain to
be called upon as the project proceeds
through the following stages of inves-
tigation, preliminary planning, promo-
tion and detailed design. His work is
then carried on by the construction en-
gineer in the execution of his plan and
by the operating engineer in the produc-
tion of the desired result with the com-
pleted machine or plant. Let us follow
through the usual orderly procedure in
the transition from an idea through the
design of the functioning plant or ma-
chine that is to be its fruition.
The Concept of an Idea
The engineer does not go to work
until there has been conceived in some-
body's mind at least the embryo of an
idea of a need to be fulfilled or a pur-
pose to be accomplished. More often
than not, such a need or purpose arises
in the public interest or in private en-
terprise, either of which at the time may
be unrelated to engineering. But as most
concepts of this kind are concerned in
one way or another with the resources
of nature, questions immediately arise
concerning the practicability of the
scheme. To lend substance to our pur-
suit of this thought, consider an hypo-
thetical proposal to manufacture some
new food product synthetically from an
otherwise waste material. The process
is presumed to be possible in the labo-
ratory, but no further development has
been made. The idea of commercial pro-
duction is the only stock in trade. The
illustration can be made as well using
the building of an hydro-electric plant,
the production of automobiles, or the
construction of a radio station.
The Investigation of the Feasibility
of Development
The problem now is to transform an
idea of possibility into a reality of cer-
tainty. Questions immediately arise.
What basic materials of production are
necessary? Where can they be had in
adequate quantity and suitable quality?
How much and what kind of power is
needed? Is there an adequate and suit-
able supply of water for process and
power uses? Is labor of the required
skill available? How about transporta-
tion facilities for inbound materials
and outbound products? Is there a po-
tential market for the product and
where is it to be found? Finally, with
data at hand in answer to these ques-
tions, is the project justifiable either
economically or in the public or private
interest that inspries it?
If ever there is a job of engineering
analysis that calls for originaltiy, re-
sourcefulness, ingenuity, practicality,
experience and judgment, here is one.
Engineering functions from
field surveying through design,
construction and operation are
drawn upon. Many of the fac-
tors to be weighed are in the
nature of intangible future
prospects; all are subject to
variation and difference of
opinion. The time available for
the investigation is always lim-
ited. Yet an answer dependable
enough to determine the con-
tinued pursuit or the abandon-
ment of the project must be
given.
The Comprehensive Plan
of Development
When this study discloses
that the project is worthy of
development, a preliminary
plan is usually required to es-
tablish the basis for its further
promotion. Utilizing the find-
ings of the investigation, a gen-
eral plan of development, com-
prehensive in its scope but un-
encumbered with detail, is de-
vised. Such a plan is usually
presented in the form of an en-
gineering report written in clear and, so
far as possible, non-technical language,
illustrated with drawings and charts,
and so composed as to answer the ob-
vious and reasonable questions that may
be anticipated. Where pertinent, outline
plans of the proposed plant construc-
tion, flow-sheets of operation, charts of
distribution to markets, estimates of in-
vestment and operation costs and of in-
come are included. Often such a report
becomes an important part of the pro-
spectus issued by the promoters of the
project.
The fundamental idea has now begun
to take form. At least, its scope and a
reasonable plan for its advancement
have been recorded on paper. The idea
can be readily conveyed to the minds
of others than its originators. It has
taken on a tangible value as negotiable
property.
Here the designing engineer is called
upon to express his thoughts and con-
clusions in a lucid, informative and con-
vincing manner. All of the ingenuity,
experience and judgment that may have
been brought to bear upon the prob-
lem during its investigational stages will
go no farther than his notes, unless they
get into the more or less formal state-
ment of his comprehensive plan of de-
velopment. How many really meritor-
ious ideas have failed of realization at
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


there have been many cases is probable.
The Promotion of the Project
With the acquisition of a tangible
value, the fundamental idea is ready for
the market. This applies, in a sense,
whether it be concerned with a com-
mercial enterprise, a project for public
service to be publicly owned, or a private
development of philanthropic nature. If
not already existent, some individual or
some sort of corporate organization
must be formed to acquire, construct
and operate the proposed works.
The project must be financed by
some means, such as the sale of stock,
the sale of bonds or the creation of a
fund by voluntary subscription. In any
event, the prospective stock holders,
bond holders or contributors must be
convinced of the security of their in-
vestment and the probability of an ap-
propriate return. In cases of local gov-
ernment-sponsored projects financed by
bond issues, the public themselves
must be "sold", before they will author-
ize the bond obligation. Lands and
rights-of-way as may be necessary must
be acquired. Patents, if needed, must
be secured now if not previously. Trade
agreements and marketing outlets must
be negotiated.
Through all of this stage of organiza-
tion and advancement of the business
relationships, the designing engineer
stands by in readiness to supplement his
plan for the project wherever questions
arise. He must bring to bear upon the
problems presented, his engineering
ability to marshall the basic facts, an-
alyze the data and find logical conclu-
sions. He must speak publcily before
those who are to be interested, for he,
of all of those primarily concerned, has
the knowledge of the basic facts. His
efforts are likely to be ineffectual, un-
less he has acquired the ability to stand
upon his feet, and, by forceful expres-
sion, convey to his listeners, such a
vivid picture of the project, that they
cannot fail to comprehend it. Compre-
hension is a necessary prerequisite of
decision.
The Detailed Design and
Specification
The successfully promoted project of
merit is half completed, at least in so far
as the engineering design is concerned.
With a general plan of development de-
termined upon, a capable organization
as its sponsor, the financing assured and
preliminary operating relationships es-
tablished, there remains for the design-
er, the job of preparing the detailed
plans and specifications, with which
physical embodiment of the original
idea may be fabricated. The general
functions to be performed have been
outlined, the sources of raw materials
have been discovered, the site has been
selected, the approximate size has been
fixed. The work is now one of unfold-
ing and elaborating the earlier design.
The soundness of judgment and the ac-
curacy of visualization of the prelim-
inary design must now face the test.
Additional basic data must be col-
lected in wider scope and greater detail
than was justifiable at an earlier date.
Sites must be precisely surveyed, raw
materials must be appraised as to quan-
tity and quality. Complete information
concerning the resources and conditions
must be brought from the field into the
office.
Working from the general plan as a
base, the details begin to take form.
The architect and structural designer
develop the housing and supporting ele-
ments for equipment; the mechanical
designer plans for fuel power genera-
tion and transmission, and the ma-
terials handling; the electrical designer
lays out electric power generation and
transmission; the chemical engineering
designer matures the plans for processes
and treatments. The work of each must
be correlated with that of each other
and all must be directed to the accom-
plishment of the intended purpose.
The qualifications of the designer are
first and foremost the possession of a
broad training and experience basically
in engineering but supplemented by an
understanding of nature, both human
and otherwise. Nothing that he is ever
to design will be useful in large measure
unless it serves others than himself, and
he is not likely to produce a good design
without a full understanding of this
phase of his problem. As he progresses
through life he will probably have a les-
sening need to recall his formulas and
his specialized technical knowledge and
a widening demand upon his abilities to
meet and work harmoniously with his
fellow man.

Roller bearings are among the most nearly
perfect products of man's genius. They must
be so to accomplish their task in the silent
manner required of them. In their manufac-
ture, they must be so tested that there is not
a chance for a dud to get by. This is done
through the use of acoustimeters, highly sen-
sitive instruments which translate vibrations
into sounds whose volumes can be measured
and recorded on dials. Any bearing which
does not meet a predetermined standard is
quickly rejected.
For absolute accuracy—to one-hundred-
thousandth of an inch—these measurements
are carried out in sound-proof, air-conditioned
rooms. The air supplied is filtered, cooled,
and regulated at constant flow and temper-
ature. A uniform temperature eliminates con-
traction of the metal rollers and raceways,
and filtering the air prevents the accumula-
tion of dust, which would render accurate
measurements impossible.

SYDNEY STEINBORN '38E
Adapted from Steel Fads
OUR common tin can boasts of a
romantic ancestry fused with the
annals of far off lands and heavily
weighted with the age-old legends of
medieval and pre-medieval civilizations.
The early Roman alchemists coated cop-
per vessels with tin to make them re-
sistant to the corrosive acids found in
food. In 55 B.C., Roman biremes landed
their armored cohorts on the shores of
Britain to secure tin from the mines of
Cornwall, these mines having been pre-
viously worked at an unknown date by
the Phoenicians of Tyre and Sidon. In
this respect, it is interesting to note that
much of the early exploration was in-
stigated by the search for new supplies
of tin.
The origin and time of the inception
of tin plate are facts which have become
lost in the ages. However, the writings
of Pliny give concrete proof that the art
of coating cast or wrought iron with tin
was known prior to 25 A.D. For 12
centuries after that the art progressed
slowly, a few deposits of the ore being
discovered in Bohemia in 1240. Evi-
dence points to this country as the first
to see the establishment of a tin plate
industry. From this date to 1620 there
is no record of tin plate manufacture
being carried on elsewhere since the
methods were secret and closely guarded
by the guilds, being handed down from
father to son. The Duke of Saxony was
desirous of introducing the manufacture
of tin into Western Europe. He sent an
agent to Bohemia who secured the secret
of tin plate manufacture by devious
methods which are best known to him-
self; this in 1620. Still the manufac-
turing process was clouded in secrecy
and little was known of the industry
until 1720 when a plant was established
at Pontypool in Monmouth, England,
under the management of Major John
Handbury. Operations at this plant re-
sulted in the perfection of the manufac-
ture thin sheets by rolling, a develop-
ment which assured Handbury and
Payne, the discoverers, success in their
endeavor. Previous to the Handbury
process, black ''plates" for tinning were
hammered from bars about one and one
sixteenth inch square. The bars, after
being heated and somewhat flattened,
were cut into small pieces called "soles,"
bent double, again heated and further
flattened, the final operation being to
beat the plates into packs of 40 or 50
sheets of the required gage. This work
was naturally carried on at low temper-
atures and each plate became covered
with a film of oxide and as a conse-
quence of this the plates did not always
slick together.
Before 1747 and the common use of
hydrochloric acid, the plates were
scoured with rand and water to remove
scale and dirt. Rough spots were filed
off and the plates immersed in "sour
water" water made acid by fermenting
rye or barley meal. In order to increase
acidity and to speed up the process, the
vats containing the plates were heated
and kept underground in vaults. These
vaults became so hot that the men
worked naked and the acid was so weak
cleaning took several days. Present day
operations, pickling and cleaning, is so
efficient that the sheets move automati-
cally through a 350 foot bath at a rate

the physical discomforts experienced by
the workers in the earlier methods. Aft-
er the plates had been cleaned they were
washed in clean water and covered with
grease to obviate rusting and to collect
dirt on a protective film over the plate
proper. From the greasing the plates
journeyed to a bath of molten tin cov-
ered with palm oil. They acquired a
coating of tin here and upon emerging
from the bath another grease covering.
The final step was in passing through
an absorbent cleaning mixture of barley
meal and bran middlings and later pol-
ished by girls wearing sheepskin gloves.
During 200 years many changes have
been made in tin plate manufacturing
but the palm oil and bran middlings are
still used in the process.
Up to 1875 nearly all the tin plates
had iron for a base; there were two
grades produced: "charcoal" iron made
with charcoal as a fuel, and "coke"
made using a mixture of coal and char-
coal—"charcoal" being the better grade.
Plates of "charcoal" usually carried an
extra coating of tin. By 1880, progress
in the steel industry resulted in the sub-
stitution open hearth steel for charcoal
iron and bessemer steel for coke iron.
The nomenclature of "charcoal" and
"coke" remain, but their meaning is re-
stricted to indicating the weight of the
tin coating.
Present day operations enjoin the
most modern equipment available. The
method employed is to make the final
reduction in the thickness of the steel
plate while it is cold rather than at a
red heat. Coils of previously hot-rolled
strips are carefully pickled to remove
every particle of dirt, grease, and mill
scale in order to insure cleanness and
uniform adherence of the tin coating.
Next step is the further rolling, cold, to
the required thickness and to obtain a
fine, smooth surface. The rolls are usu-
ally of the five high type. All this cold
rolling makes the steel hard and brittle
necessitating some annealing measures.
This is accomplished by heating in enor-
mous furnaces to a temperature of about
1400 degrees farenheit for 16 or 18
hours and subsequent cooling to atmos-
pheric temperature in about 48 hours.
The annealing process, however, has in-
troduced a new difficulty: the pores of
the steel have been enlarged and if
coated in that condition the plate would
absorb too much tin giving a dull sur-
face. This is overcome by further cold

Defects are spotted by an expert eye
rolling, producing a smooth surface yet
not causing any cold hardening. Then
comes the inspection of the plates for
surface defects and accuracy as to size
and gage. Passing a rigid inspection,
the plates are sent on to the tinning de-
partment. Upon arrival, the plates are
coated with a flux of zinc or ammonium
chloride which removes any dirt or
grease which may have accumulated
since the pickling operation and pre-
pares the plate for tinning. The plates
are then immersed in a bath of molten
tin protected from the atmosphere by
a layer of the time-honored palm oil
which serves to keep the tin from solidi-
fying too rapidly as well as to assure an
even coating and a high luster. The
plate is next drawn out of the bath and
through the palm oil by a set of cast
iron rolls which strip the plate of any
excess tin and distribute the remainder
evenly over the surface. Upon passing
through the layer of palm oil the plate
collects its protective coat of grease.
Finally all grease and collected dirt is
removed and the plates polished in a
machine consisting of several pairs of
rolls built up by mounting thousands of
discs of canton flannel upon a long shaft.
A flowing stream of finely ground rye or
wheat middlings, similar to that which
had been used for two centuries, absorbs
the remaining oil and dirt and further
polishes the plate. After this comes the
most rigid inspection of all: a plate with
17 surface defects of the size just visible
to the naked eye being the maximum al-
lowance for a "prime" plate.
Steel Faets
The year 1890 is the red letter year
in this country's history of tin manu-
facture. Strangely enough, no tin was
manufactured in the United States dur-
ing that year. All that was used was
imported from Wales, and so great was
the Welsh supremacy because of low
labor costs that earlier tin plate enter-
prises launched in 1873 and 1874 could
not withstand the pressure of the Welsh
competition and by 1878 ceased opera-
tion. But the growing importance of tin
plate in American frontier-and home-
life and the ever-present desire for home
industries led to the insertion of a clause
relative to tin plate in the McKinley
Tariff Act of 1890 which levied a duty
of 2.2 cents per pound on imported tin
plate. The act also stated that if, after
October 1, 1897, manufacturers had not
produced in any one fiscal year as much
as one-third of the quantity of tin plate
and terne plate imported, the tin plate
clause would become non-operative, and
tin plate lighter than 63 pounds per 100
square feet should enter the country
duty-free. With this inducement, Amer-
ican enterprise set to work and by 1891
there were 20 tin mills in operation and
10 under construction. Today, Ameri-
can tin plate industry produces more
than half of the world production. Some
1,700,000 gross tons were produced last
year. This would make 14,000,000,000
tin cans and probably did make a large
percentage of this estimate. You see,
that insignificant empty salmon can has
quite a history, so don't throw it away
without a second thought.

GENERAL SET-UP
1. State immediately that the letter is an application for employment.
2. If someone has suggested that you apply for a position with the organ-
ization, make that statement in the first paragraph.
3. Information regarding qualifications should be brief, but complete and
comprehensive. Do not jumble facts—personal characteristics
should be completely covered in one paragraph, education in an-
other, experience in a third, references in still another, and mis-
cellaneous informatoin in another.
4. It is always well to mention an interview, unless the prospective employ-
er is located too far away, in which case he will request the inter-
view if he is especially interested in the application.
5. In seeking first positions it is just as well to leave all mention of salary

PROFESSION
HEART TROUBLE
AFFAIRS of the heart are not whol-
ly confined to the world of men,
cases often being found among electric
motors. Not that motors are taken sick
with jealousy because the generator goes
around with turbine; motors just get
the blues resulting from ills which are
strikingly analogous to the cardiac dif-
ficulties of the human body. For in-
stance:palpitation. Can it be that Mr.

Electric Journal
Motor is all atwitter about that blonde
D. C. from Toledo? No! Mr. Motor's
brushes merely have too high a co-effi-
cient of friction. Often times ole man
motor seems to be wasting away—is he
pining for an alternating current? No!
He has consumption, the brushes are
wasting away due to climatic conditions
and the best way to get him back on
his feet is to change the climate to suit
the brushes or the brushes to suit the
climate. Nor is the motor immune to
Spring Fever. There may or may not
be an exotic brunette transformer be-
hind the illness but the symptoms are
an emaciated and weak brushholder
spring tension; the cure? Simply boost
the tension. Sadly enough, Alec Trick
Motor may be afflicted with flat feet—
this situation is unromantic but readily
recognizable by flat spots on the com-
mutator causing painful operation. At-
tention by an experienced chiropodist
who will stone or turn the ailing com-
mutators in a lathe will usually remedy
the condition. In the same breath as
flat feet, we find that our noble motor
is often brought clown by constipation,
dreadfully prosaic and identified by
light brushes. A good rub-down of the
sides of the brushes will relieve the pa-
tient.
REMEMBER THE WELDER
FACED with the problem of disman-
tling a 50 year old railroad bridge
or erecting costly falsework, engineers
of an eastern railroad remembered the
man behind the blowtorch and solved
their riddle at a great saving of time
and money.
The lower chord eyebars in the
trusses of the bridge were only 6 inches
above the passing locomotive stacks—
exhaust fumes had badly eaten away
the material in a period of over a half a
century and the problem was how to re-
pair the eyebars and keep the bridge
open to traffic. This was done by chip-
ping away the old metal and inserting
steel plates between the eyebars—these
were then welded in place and the space
between the eyebar and the new metal
filled in with weld metal. Some 500
linear inches of welding was required,
overhead, downhand and regular, yet
the work was completed ahead of sched-
ule and at a saving of 10,000 dollars
over that of a dismantling job.
SHOWERS FOR COAL CARS
AX eastern railroad has recently in-
stalled a sprinkler tower for auto-
matically wetting coal in cars as they
pass the coal-loading dock in Toledo,
Ohio. The sprinkler system is entirely
automatic and so arranged that when
the front of the car reaches the tower it
interrupts a light beam consequently
energyzing a solenoid which operates the
sprinkler. The valve system employed
is so designed that water hammer is
eliminated and the head of water closes
the valve when the light beam is again
continuous. Provision against failure of
the light source has been made since,
should the light fail while the valve is
open, the valve would drop of its own
weight but not until a predetermined
time had elapsed necessary for the car
to pass under the sprinkler. Thus each
coal-car is given an envigorating shower
and is all pepped up to go to work.
DAMS AND PUSHOVERS
IN building a dam on the Saguenay
River, near Kenogami, Quebec, engi-
neers were confronted with the prob-
lem of diverting the waters of the swift
river during the closure period pending
the completion of the main structure.
This swiftness of flow necessitated a
quick closure because the conventional
cofferdams made of piling could not be
placed with sufficient rapidity to turn
the channel of the stream. After a little
speculation, a "pushover" of a plan was
concocted: on one side of the river a
concrete monolith was erected—techni-
cally known to the men behind the
transits as an "obelisk." It weighed
22,000 pounds and stood upright, simi-
larly to the leaf of a bascule bridge. It
was some 92 feet high with its sides
transwerse to the direction of the stream
and that portion of its surface that
faced the river was carefully contoured
to fit the character of the bed of the
stream. When all was ready, a little
powder blasted away the pier support-
ing th? monolith on the stream side of
the structure and it fell into the pre-
calciilated prone position and quickly
diverted the recalcitrant channel to its
new course—a real pushover and th?
work could continue on the main por-
tion of this 260,000 horsepower hydro-
electric plant.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

IN this department's search for eco-
nomic manifestations in the engi-
neering world we almost passed up the
Mississippi Waterway System. The
area drained is so vast and the various
economic ramifications are so complex
that this department hesitates in as-
suming the temerity to compact and
present an era in a three column page.
Mark Twain made the Mississippi a
gloriously romantic entity. When, in
the grade schools, we first learned of
the decay of River transportation sub-
sequent to the beginning of hostilities in
the Civil War, we rather wistfully hoped
that someday, somehow this fanciful era
might resurrect itself. However, engi-
neers are unpleasantly pragmatic, a lit-
tle investigation into the causes of the
falling off of water transportation
showed small hope of any real rejuvena-
tion. Talks with Professor John S. Wor-
ley head of the Department of Trans-
portation Engineering gave us real tech-
nical-economic reasons why the revival
of River Traffic was impossible in an
age of progress.
Just when did the business on the
Mississippi begin to tread water? When
did the economic and technical forces
begin to push the puffing stern-wheelers
out of the transportation picture? Prior
to the advent of the railroad, the Mis-
sissippi System was the chief and only
agency for opening up the great middle-
western territory. During this opening
period traffic moved principally between
points on the Ohio River and New Or-
leans. Freight was transported in every
conceivable current-propelled contriv-
ance imaginable—most popular being
the-boat-that-never-came-back, the flat-
boat which was sold for lumber upon
arrival in New Orleans, [n 1814 the
price to ship a barrel of flour from
Louisville to New Orleans was $9.00 or
6.7 cents per ton-mile. Here was force
number one tending to culminate in th;
obsolesence of the Mississippi as a trans-
portation medium. Freight rates were
high, profits were to be made if a sys-
tem could be advised that would result
in cheaper and more efficient freight
handling. But first the attractive rates
resulted in a shipping-by-water boom.
In 1817 800 fiat boats arrived at New
Orleans, in 1847 some 3000 arrivals
were reported. During this 30 year pe-
riod, the Golden Age on the Mississippi,
other forces were at work—forces all set
in motion by the prevalent high freight
rates and the need for any method of
moving commodities. Soon after its
practical conception, the railway shifted
from passenger traffic as a main divi-
dend providing function and began
moving freight. At first many short
disconnected lines were built merely to
connect the back areas with the main
artery, the Mississippi. However, these
railroads, which were originally intended
to complement the existing waterways,
soon became direct competitors for
available freight and passenger traffic.
In 1851, a connecting link, by rail, was
completed from the Ohio River to Lake
Erie and this unit plus others of a simi-
lar nature began to divert the mid-west
traffic to the northern route through the
Lakes rather than the long coastal jour-
ney to the Eastern markets. Emigration
to the West motivated the Eastern rail-
roads into extending their facilities far-
ther and farther west and every year
rail service was becoming more prompt
and reliable. The waterway interests
saw the handwriting on the wall and for
a time kept the railroads from crossing
the Mississippi by their demands for
railroad bridges so constructed that no
change would be necessary in the height
of existing ships. This claim was cer-
tainly a legitimate one but events
proved that their demands were in-
tended as a club to intimidate the rail-
roads into an alliance with the water-
ways. Congressional authorization event-
ually resulted in continuous railroads
across the Mississippi; with this, the
decline became more apparent. Still
other forces were acting to hasten the
growing unimportance of the Mississippi
System. One was the coming of the
deep-draft ocean liner to replace the
shallower clipper-ship of the 40's and
50's. Here was technological progress
working to obviate an inefficient system
of transportation. This change in hull
design made it almost impossible to get
over the Southwest Bar at the mouth
of the Mississippi without the aid of
towboats. Added to this difficulty was
the fact that the towboat operators ex-
ploited their position by charging ex-
horbitant rates to ships desiring to be
taken over the bar. In our economics
courses we found that no monopoly can
exist for long under a system of free
private enterprise—these gentlemen soon
found themselves without boats to tow
as the freight was diverted to the rail-
roads. The next blow to the fast dis-
appearing glory of the River Traffic
was the Civil War, terminating freight
and traffic movements on the lower Mis-
sissippi. Military demands did much to
improve the efficiency of the Northern
railroads despite the lack of capital
equipment. Cessation of hostilities and
the subsequent castigation of the South
as an economic factor in American life
saw traffic on the River reach an all-
time nadir.
Costs were written over every step of
the road in changing from boat to rails
in marketing the products of the middle
west. Shippers were given fast, efficient
hauling by the railroads and the method
obviated the use of maritime insurance
—the railroads got the business. The
passage of the Interstate Commerce Act
in 1887 gave the waterway interests a
final ray of hope. The interests worked
under almost perfect competition, since
there were many small owners, while
the railroads worked together, either
openly or secretly. The roads lowered
their rates at points where they were in
competition with the waterways, mak-
ing up the loss by higher exactions from
inland shippers who had no water facil-
ities. This was apparently price dis-
crimination; the waterways complained
to the Commission, but that body de-
clared that the railroads need not corn-
form to the long and short haul clause
in the act where water competition was
present. This spiked the last hope of
the waterway interests to maintain
themselves against the superior techni-
cal efficiency and service of the rail-
roads. The story of the decline being,
in essence, a fight against technological
progress and a futile attempt to block

ever, do not feel that the Mississippi is
a gigantic white elephant with no func-
tion to perform in our civilization. The
system carried sixty percent of the total
waterway traffic in America. It carried
well over 5,000,000,000 ton-miles of
freight last year and produces hundreds
of thousands of kilowatt hours of elec-
tric power per year. Its military impor-
tance in enormous: you can terminate
a railroad's services with a few well
placed bombs, but a river requires quite
a little blasting to destroy its usefulness.
The federal government has spent up-
wards of 500,000,000 dollars on improv-
ing the channel and appurtenant works
and you may be assured that it has and
will continue to pay dividends in lower
cost to consumers and increasing army
efficiency.

DURING the depression, quite a
number of young graduates got
bread-and-butter jobs as inspectors on
the production line. Since this is one
way to begin at the foot of the engineer-
ing ladder, we should some day hear
from these climbing young men. Should
we? That depends. One of them
dropped in on me after he had been
inspecting a certain gadget for some
time. It bothered him, because he
couldn't understand how it could work,
when assembled with the finished ma-
chine. Neither could I, from the des-
cription he gave of it. I was completely
unfamiliar with the thing. But all I had
to do was to pick up the handbook de-
voted to that field of engineering, con-
sult the index, and find a picture—not
merely of the kind of thing it was, but
SNAPPY SERVICE
ACROSS THE STREET
ANN ARBOR
Nov. 11, 1936
Dear Fellows,
Sorry to keep you
waiting so long but here we
are—open again—serving
the same good food and cof-
fee with two new smiles to
say hello at any time.
Snappy Service
of the exact unit his company was mak-
ing. Also, it proved his description to
be wrong.
The engineering world's fund of in-
formation has not yet been organized
and crammed into one book, so that any
graduate may at any time flip the pages
and inform himself as to strange de-
vices. A little initiative and some imag-
ination are often necessary to the run-
ning down of what we need to know.
These qualities are also helpful in try-
ing to climb the engineering ladder. If
our friend's performance in the above
instance were typical, and you were in
charge, would you expect soon to pro-
mote him?
Early in 1935 I called on a small but
forward-looking company, and was talk-
ing with the manager about young en-
gineers and their employment diffi-
culties. This company is perhaps too
small to warrant the introduction of a
recruiting and training program for en-
gineer graduates. Nevertheless, it had
the informal equivalent: about a dozen
young graduates had been picked up
during the depression, and placed either
in inspection jobs or on the production
line. They were not told that they were
being watched, but such was the fact.
Any who showed promise above and
beyond the routine job assigned, were
to be earmarked for better jobs when
opening occurred. In the words of the
manager, ''About one man out of twelve
was worth retaining." Yet this was
when employment opportunities were
still scarce, and young graduates were
universally supposed to be anxious to
make good on any jobs they could find.
Now think about that company for a
moment. To a remarkable degree, it is
technically self-sufficient. Some manu-
facturers are largely engaged in copying,
making, and selling things developed by
other individuals or firms, but not this
one. A very large share of the technical
achievement represented by the com-
pany's product is to be credited to the
company's own research, development,
design, application and sales engineers.
Many new ideas had to be originated in-
side this plant, before it could even
know if its main product might possibly
be commercially feasible. Many more
technical and processing improvements
had to be written into the product be-
fore is found a large and growing mar-
ket. Almost all of these contributions
were made by the staff. Changes are still
frequently made, either in the product,
or in the methods of making it. Some^
body has to think of these improve-
ments.
A young graduate on a bread-and-
butter job in a factory like this, has
plenty of chances to make helpful sug-
gestions, in addition to doing his as-
signed work and doing it well. If he
doesn't, he is one of the eleven men out
of the dozen, who worked there once.
Speaking of muffed opportunities,
there's the case of the bright young
graduate who still needed a job. An em-
ployer called me by telephone, describ-
ing his urgent need for a man. Our un-
placed graduate's technical quadifica-
tions beautifully fitted the requirements.
I at once proposed the candidate. The
employer at once replied. "No," he said,
"I used that chap part-time for a while,
just doing this and that around the
place. He didn't keep things cleaned
up."
Employers often say, ''Why doesn't
the college teach something about these
things, along with the technical teach-
ing it does?" We do—for those who are
willing to learn. That is one reason for
having Freshman Assembly. Personal
worth in all of its aspects forms the nu-
cleus for many a talk given by deans,
professors, and speakers at various
functions. Remediable shortcomings of
young engineers are discussed time and
again, in meetings and individual con-
ferences. And this series of comments is
in part devoted to that end.

SPOTLIGHT
UNIQUE

"T T NIQUE" is the word for Hillier.
^-J Since the founding of this fair
University, Don E. Hillier is the only
engineer who had been known to be
nominated, and almost elected, to the
office of president of the Freshman class
in the Lit school.
It was but a
short time after
Don had arrived
here from his
home in Cedar
Rapdis, I o w a,
when several en-
terprising gentle-
men, who make
the finer arts
their career, real-
Don E. Hillier jzed that in Don
they beheld not
only a fine gent, but also a man who
would be popular with both sexes. Thus
his name was placed on the list of nom-
inees for the aforementioned office, and
fully a week elapsed before some en-
terprising sleuth from the other side of
the campus finally discovered that Don
was an engineer, and just didn't belong.
Though not elected by the Lit stu-
dents, Don received proper recognition
on this side of the campus, and was
elected Secretary of his class in his
freshman year. In addition, Don also
won his Frosh Numerals in football,
and Kipke lost a promising guard when
Hillier decided to concentrate on the
books instead of sports.
Having this admirable start, in his
Sophomore year Don proceeded to the
office of president of his class, member-
ship in the Engineering Council, leader
of the sophs in their annual tussle with
the frosh, and then election to Triangles.
Not content with these early triumphs,
he next made Vulcans during his Junior
year, and he now wields the gavel in
that august assemblage. As a Junior,
Don also became known as "That Hon-
est Ticket Chairman of the J-Hop".
Active in all walks of life, Don has
not neglected the social whirl. He has
done his best to uphold the traditions
of Delta Kappa Epsilon, of which he
has been House Party Chairman.
Don also has a machine shop in the
basement at home where he experiments
in the true engineering manner, building
gas engines and other gadgets. Summers
find him getting practical machine shop
experience in a large factory. You can't
miss his unusual, and frequent laugh,
and you'll always notice that cheery,
wide-awake (?) expression in all his
classes.
SCHOLAR
FEW engineers can point to two
scholarships as evidence of their
scholastic ability. One such is Kenneth
Emery from Dearborn, Michigan. In
19 3 1 Kenneth
graduated from
I )earborn High
School with in-
telligent ambi-
tion in one hand
and an Alumni
scholarship i n
the other. Thus
equipped he
headed for the
University of
-Michigan College
of Engineering
with the;|)iol)li'm of keeping his average
above a!"B" so'that his Alumni scholar-
ship would be continued. This proved to
be no problem at all: in fact, he was
tapped by Tau Beta Pi and also re-
ceived the Donavon scholarship. In the
meantime the question of where to earn
room and.board -came up and was an-
swered by the" FERA (now the NYA).
Ken has taken advantage of this organ-
ization every "semester except his first
while at school, and they could not find
a more grateful recipient.
Emery takes active part in extra-cur-
ricular activities. At present he is sec-
retary of the Engineering Council, a
member of the ROTC and Tau Beta Pi.
Photography is one of his favorite past-
times, with boxing and astronomy as
variations.
Several years ago Ken performed a
globe-trotting feat which would make
the feature page of most any news-
paper. It seems he traveled from Cali-
fornia to Detroit in ten days, coming all
the way from New Mexico without any

money. If you are fortunate enough to
corner Ken and make him relate this
adventure to you, don't miss the chance.
His experiences include everything from
hazardous April Fool jokes to riding in
a box car with a man who claimed he
had spinal meningitis.
PROGRESSIVE
MILLER SHERWOOD, being a
good and methodical engineer,
chose for his parents two graduates of
the University of Michigan, thus laying
an excellent foundation for a highly
successful college career. With these
Michiganensian antecedents, Miller ar-
rived in Ann Arbor in 1933, a blushing
graduate of Grand Haven High School
of Grand Haven, Michigan ready to
conquer new worlds and generously
equipped to do so. First world con-
quered was in finding a berth for him-
self on the Varsity tennis team. His
record on the team is certainly an en-
viable one: Miller was the final Wol-
verine survivor at the Big Ten Tennis
Championship held in Chicago last year.
Being the top-notcher among his ath-
letic colleagues, Miller was elected Cap-
tain of the tennis team. Sherwood man-
ages to get about
in school with
the same drive
that he exhibits
on the tennis
courts. In his
capacity as pres-
ident of the
Men's Council
we find Miller
fostering pro-
gressive ideas
about student
government. At
present he is working toward changes
that will provide for sophomore and
junior tryouts for the Men's Council.
In the Engineering College Miller is an
active member of the student chapter of
the A. S. M. E. and will receive his de-
gree in Mechanical Engineering this
coming June. He is specializing in fac-
tory management and in heating and
ventilating. His classmates in the En-
gineering College were not slow in rec-
ognizing the worth of his activities and
we see Miller's name in the roster of
Triangles, Vulcans. and Michigamua.
Socially Miller is right on the ball, pre-
siding over his fraternity, Sigma Phi.
Progressive and driving, Miller is head-
ed toward success.

Lightest of all structural metals,
it overcomes the hindrances of useless weight
Offering the sizable gain of being a full third lighter than
aluminum, with comparable strength and durability, DOW-
METAL (magnesium alloys) is rising fast in importance and
adoption.
Its unique lightness has, on several occasions, served science.
It furthered the stratosphere flights by achieving greater light-
ness in gondola construction. It traveled to Antarctica with

Admiral Byrd. This year it aided the Harvard-Massachusetts
Institute of Technology Expedition sent to Siberia to secure
spectrograph^ studies of the sun's corona and chromosphere.
But, more conclusive evidence of its great value and prac-
ticability is found in its recent adoption by The Hoover
Company for the new 150 Hoover Cleaner.
The aircraft industry, of course, takes full advantage of its
marked lightness and strength. But, also, it is used in type-
writers, foundry flasks, buses and trucks, portable power
tools, air conditioning equipment, machinery of many kinds,
and a host of other applications.
Wherever greater lightness, with no sacrifice in strength
means easier, faster handling; greater speed; lower power
requirements; or increased capacity, DOWMETAL can show,
in most instances, an astounding gain.
THE DOW CHEMICAL COMPANY
Dowmetal Division • Midland, Michigan
The Harvard-Massachusetts Institute of Technology Expedition
established its equipment at Ak-Bulak, Siberia, in May, 1936,
to secure spectra of both the corona and solar chromosphere.
Above is shown one of the special cases, entirely constructed of
Dowmetal, housing four spectrographs. The cameras carried a
film nine and one-half inches wide automatically exposing every
second and giving a continuous study of the spectra during the
eclipse.

Speaking of Dowmetal. Doctor Donald H.
Menzel. Director of the Expedition, said:
"We chose Dowmetal because of its com-
bined rigidity and lightness."
Above is one of the spectrographic studies selected from a total
of seven hundred individual spectra secured during the eclipse.
These spectra covered the complete spectral range from far infra-
red to the extreme ultra violet. The particular one shown is of
the blue, violet and ultra-violet coronal spectrum.
At the top of the page is shown the extreme coronal extensions
of the sun during the 1936 eclipse. These extensions rose to
distances of more than a million miles from the solar surface.

NEW MEN IN THE CHEMICAL
DEPARTMENT
The Department of Chemical En-
gineering, always on the go and now the
largest department of its kind in the
country, has quite a few additions to its
staff. Three of these are: Donald L.
Katz, Clarence A. Seibert, and J. Henry
Rushton all of whom are here in the
capacity of assistant professors.
Professor Katz is a real Michigan
man, having received all of his degrees
up to and including his doctorate at this
University. His work in industry has
been chiefly concerned with petroleum
and it is in this work that Dr. Katz will
interest himself while here at Michigan.
Professor Seibert comes to us from
Wayne University, having acquired his
B.S. degree there. While at Michigan,
he received both his Matsers and Doc-
toral degrees. Dr. Seibert's forte is met-
allurgy, and at present he is carrying
on research on the oxidation of steel,
paying particular attention to grain size.
Dr. Rushton gathered his suffixes at the
University of Pennsylvania and taught
subsequent to that at the Drexel Insti-
tute of Technology. Professor Rushton
is interested in petroleum problems but
is also doing work in the field of cor-
rosion and rate of solution of metals in
ALUMNI MOVE FORWARD
The engineering alumni have an in-
herent faculty for progress: two of our
recent graduates having recently taken
decided steps up the proverbial ladder
of success. Mr. Karl Kammermeyer
has recently been appointed chief chem-
ist of the Pure Oil Company, Toledo,
Ohio. He was formerly a chemist with
the same organization in Northville,
Illinois. The other gentleman is a real
trail-blazer: the class of '35 now has an
active representative in Africa, Law-
rence Marvin Darrow, B.S.E. '35, is
now employed by the Rhodesia Broken
Hill Development Company, Limited,
Broken Hill, Northern Rhodesia, Africa.
Mr. Darrow began work in July of this
year, we hope to hear from him through
these pages in the near future.

A new department makes its debut in
this issue. This department, it is hoped,
will fill a definite need in engineering
education. The ground to be covered is
so big, and the time so limited, that in
most of the courses we study, almost
the whole time is devoted to gaining an
understanding of the principles involved.
Little time is available to acquire any
technique or polish in handling these
technical tools we get in the classroom.
Any neat short-cuts in solving problems
are gained largely through experience.
It is the purpose of this department to
supply helpful hints in handling some
difficult problems and to point out many
useful short-cuts.
The first item in this new series is a
conversion chart supplied by Professor
A. L. Clark of the Department of Engi-
neering Drawing. The chart is self ex-
planatory, but it might be added that
it is most valuable when many conver-
sions of the same kind are being made.
In this case, stick a pin in the center
point corresponding to the conversion to
be made, and rotate a straight edge
about this pin making conversions as
fast as you can read the scales.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The oil tanker plays a large part in our foreign and domestic commerce. This
type has been extensively tested in our Naval Tank.
Some of our graduates are in command of, and have helped to design,
these sturdy Coast Cuard Ships.
Provision for a department of Marine Engineering at Michigan was made by the Regents in 1899 and the first man
was graduated in 1902. Our graduates are to be found mainly on the East Coast but some are on the West Coast and the
Great Lakes. Some are in yards which build craft for our inland waterways; others are building pleasure craft, and some
are officers in the Coast Cuard.
A considerable part of fie merchant marine of the United States is obsolete and when shipowners feel that conditions
are sufficiently secure there will be a large building program extending over a number of years. Tankers similar to the one
shown above are already being built in large numbers.
Through the Naval Tank the Department keeps in touch with the technical world, as shipyards and Naval Architects
use its facilities to perfect their designs. About 500 different models have been tested in the Tank since its establishment
in 1905.

ALL-AMERICAN DRILL
The guards on a football team usually take a
terrible beating. Coaches often pay tribute lo the
courage of their guards and marvel at their stamina.
Wonder what they would say of one particular
hard-headed drill that grinds and plugs away for
General Electric in the fractional-horsepower-motor
section of the Fort Wayne works. Here's the story:
A couple of years ago, this drill started buzzing
around, drilling holes for motors and flanges. It was
tipped with Carboloy, a development of General
Electric research, and plenty tough. Result—it
established a combination speed and durability
record by completing 100,247 holes each 1 11/38
inches deep. During the years of its service, it pene-
trated approximately 2^4 miles of cast iron, at the
rate of about 10 inches a minute, before wearing out!

SOMETHING REALLY THIN
Until recently, "by the skin of your teeth" was the
very peak of thinness. General Electric, however,
now makes a strong bid for a new figure of speech:
it is "by a weld's breadth." Engineers at the Sche-
nectady works recently welded together strips of two
alloys, Copnic and Chromel, and then rolled them
to a thickness of six millionths of an inch.
The material formed by this junction has a very
small heat capacity and will respond rapidly to a
change in temperature. Engineers estimate that a
pound of this product would cost several million
dollars. %
Gold has been beaten to four millionths of an inch
thickness, and aluminum has been thinned by the
same treatment to ten millionths of an inch; but
this is the first time two alloys have been reduced to
such a thin section by rolling. The feat was achieved
by placing the welded strips of alloy between pieces
of steel and rolling the complete assembly. The
product is not yet manufactured for general sale.
General Electric engineers, working with all the
facilities of G-E research laboratories, are daily
producing new processes and new applications that
make for future progress.

HARD ON THE OX
Residents of Duanesburg in Schenectady county,
New York, killed and roasted their plumpest ox
recently in order properly to celebrate the opening
of the world's longest stretch of sodium-lighted high-
way. But the ox could feed only a small part of the
crowd that turned out to see the sight. Shortly, at
a signal picked up by an electric eye. the road glowed
out clearly in the darkness. The soft, glareless light
of 391 G-E sodium lights made of it a real Golden
Road, 18 miles long.
Fifteen thousand people watched the celebration
and listened to New York's Commissioner of High-
ways, Arthur W. Brandt, point out some of the
savings that good highway lighting gives. They
heard the figures in the case of an early lighting
installation made by General Electric—a six-mile
section on the well-traveled Albany-Schenectady
road. Night accidents have decreased there 40 per
cent. Day accidents on the other hand have in-
creased 13 per cent.
These stretches of lighting greatly reduce the hazard
in night driving. Another major installation will be
opened this fall on the San Francisco-Oakland Bay
bridge where 900 units will illuminate both decks
of the span. Sodium lighting has been developed to
its present efficiency by General Electric engineers.

IT'S WELDED
• Welding is essential in the modern air-
plane gasoline tank because high strength,
lightness and freedom from leakage are
paramount considerations.
Welding has made many good products
better—gasoline tanks, stoves, automobiles,
radios, refrigerators, streamlined trains and
a thousand other things. This modern
method of manufacture is applicable to the
widest range of materials—steel and iron,
aluminum, copper, brass and all other
alloys and metals, even platinum. It is ideal
for use where strong, smooth, invisible
joints are necessary for enameling, for
cleanliness or for appearance.
Tomorrow's engineers will be expected
to know how to take advantage of this mod-
ern metal-working process. Several valuable
and interesting technical booklets describ-
ing the application of the oxy-acetylene
process of welding and cutting in design,
construction and fabrication are available
from Linde offices in principal cities. Write

ELECTRIC ARC FURNACE
Steel scrap is the charge of this 15-ton, electric arc, alloy steel
furnace. The type of scrap to be used is determined by the requriements
of the steel to be made. This furnace does its best work when a high
degree of deoxidation is essential to proper heat treatment characteristics.
Several voltages are provided and the melt down is accomplished by pass-
ing current from the electrodes through the scrap at the maximum volt-
age and in a minimum of time. Once melted the impurities float on the
molten metal and are slagged off. A new slag is formed by adding vary-
ing amounts of coke, flour spar and ferro-silicon depending upon the
kind of steel desired. When the metal and slag are properly adjusted,
alloy additions are made. The electric arc furnace, with its precisely
compounded alloys, is assuming a role of increasing importance now that
heat-resisting and stainless steels are made in this type of furnace.

Where Do Engineers Go From College?
JJndu5ttial Ke5eatck
By
C. F. HIRSCHFELD
CHIEF OF RESEARCH. DETROIT EDISON CO.
CURRENT popular literature has
discovered the existence of research
and has done much to cast both mystery
and glamour about it. Glib writers have
engaged in wild imaginative flights in
their treatment of this subject. As a re-
sult the public has in many cases ob-
tained either a garbled or an entirely
erroneous idea.
In simple language, research is noth-
ing more nor less than an organized ef-
fort to determine fact, that is organized
fact finding. It is not confined to science
or to applied science; it is not confined
to the library or the laboratory; it is
not confined to any single group of in-
dividuals or to any group of human ac-
tivities. In its broad interpretation it is
applicable to practically all the doings
and all the things of mankind.
Industrial research is generally con-
sidered to be research financed by in-
dustry and for industry. It is self-evi-
dent that industry would not finance
such activities except in anticipation of
a profit in some form. We might define
industrial research as organized fact
finding, financed by industry in antici-
pation of an ultimate profit of some sort.
It is important to recognize the fact
that research may be applied properly,
and frequently profitably, to any activity
of industry. Almost anyone will admit
the probable value of a new product de-
veloped by research, or of a reduction of
production costs, or of a means of utiliz-
ing by-products, or of a reduced distri-
bution expense. It is not as commonly
appreciated that research may be profit-
ably applied to the improvement of busi-
ness methods such as accounting prac-
tice, billing and collection routine, pay-
ment of wages, placement of individuals
and so on. Moreover, it happens fre-
quently that the profits obtained from
organized fact finding in fields and ac-
tivities of the latter type are more im-
mediate and greater than those resulting
from research in more obvious and con-
ventional directions. It is therefore
essential to recognize the wide availa-
bility of the research method in industry
if the maximum of profit is to be ob-
tained from its application.
The conscious and wide spread use of
organized fact finding in industry is
comparatively a recent development.
There were few industrial research de-
partments in this country at the begin-
ning of the present century and the
great majority were organized during the
past two decades. It follows that this
line of industrial activity is still in the
formative stage; it has not yet been re-
duced by long practice and experience
to hard and fast lines.
DECEMBER, 1936


Mrtal Progress
• "Research is nothing more nor less than organized fact finding.
On the other hand, certain facts and
certain characteristics are already very
evident. One can begin to formulate
principles with some degree of certainty.
For example, experience is showing that
broadly into two distinct categories on
industrial research may well be divided
the basis of competitive value of the
results.
Into one class go all those projects
which, if successful, produce results hav-
ing definite competitive value within a
given industry. A new steel alloy of pat-
entable composition and of commercial
value might serve as an example of this
type of result. Obviously, a steel manu-
facturer who obtains the patent rights to
such an alloy may be expected to obtain
a competitive advantage over other steel
manufacturers. Research of this type
may be said to produce results of intra-
industry competitive value. It is almost
obvious that research of this sort should
be financed by one industrial organiza-
tion, as for example one steel making
company; not by the steel industry as a
whole.
In the other class fall researches which
if successful benefit a whole industry.
For example, research leading to in-
creased use of common varieties of steel
benefits the whole steel industry in its
competition with other industries such
as the copper or the cement industry.
Research of this type may be said to
have inter-industry competitive value.
It is evident that such
research might well be
financed cooperatively
by all organizations
engaged in a given in-
dustry. And there is
some evidence that this
is becoming appre-
ciated and that such
cooperative research is
going to assume ever
greater importance.
The American Con-
crete Institute sup-
ported now for many
years by the cement in-
dustry and the recently
formed Association of
American Railways
serve as examples.
It is also becoming
evident that, in a gen-
eral way, it pays in-
dustry to avail itself of
many different research
facilities. These in-
clude individual industrial research de-
partments, commercial laboratories and
commercial research organizations, uni-
versity departments and laboratories,
individual workers, and such tax sup-
ported organizations as the U. S. Bureau
of Standards. The wise industrial leader
about to finance research along certain
lines determines first where the best
personnel and the best facilities for this
particular type of work are available
and places the research there if condi-
tions permit. A surprisingly large
amount of research of value to a given
industrial establishment thus can be
conducted profitably through facilities
outside the company itself and, as a
matter of fact, is so conducted.
Another thing that experience is show-
ing is that the mere establishment and
manning and equipping of a research de-
partment within an industrial organiza-
tion is not enough to obtain the best re-
sults. It is necessary to educate the en-
tire administrative personnel of the or-
ganization to a new method of thought.
It is necessary to make them conscious of
the practical value of the fact finding
method as a means of solving recognized
problems and as a means of discovering
and solving unsuspected problems. Men
who have advanced in industry by the
methods more commonly in use in the
past are apt to place more reliance on
their judgment, experience, intuition and
driving force than upon any new-fangled
fact finding processes clothed in mystery
and frequently associated with academic
titles and degrees. But, real success in
the industrial application of research can
come only when the entire personnel is
sold to its value; when all concerned rec-
ognize in this method a sound means of
advancing their industry.
And another thing shown by exper-
ience is that the research department
should not report to any subordinate
executive. It must be given the recogni-
tion and the freedom that may be ex-
pected to flow from working directly
under a major executive. In fact, it ap-
pears to function best when the director
of research reports directly to the presi-
dent or the general manager. Unless the
scope of a research department is inten-
tionally limited to one objective or to
the needs of one department, it func-
tions most profitably when it serves all
departments. This, of itself, indicates
the desirability of reporting directly to
a major executive.
Now, what does industrial research
hold for the young man about to enter
industry? That, as in so many other
cases, depends a great deal upon the
young man. To one fitted to the work
by temperament, characteristics and
training it promises a series of great
adventures and at least the possibility
of rich rewards. Research has been
likened recently to geographical explora-
tion. It is pointed out that we have
crossed all the geographical frontiers,
that we have completed most of the pos-
sible geographical exploration and that
we have gone a long way toward utiliz-
ing all the economically valuable find-
ings of such exploration. But, research
brings back in another form the possi-
bilities of such activities; the opportuni-
ties for crossing frontiers of knowledge,
the adventures to be had in the explora-
tion of the unknown fields beyond those
borders and the rich rewards to those
who make commercially valuable dis-
coveries.
Such adventures and such work are
not for the small of spirit, the lazy or the
timid. They require a largeness of
vision, great courage, endless application
and tremendous endurance. In addition,
success in industrial research requires
the ability to evaluate commercial possi-
bilities, the ruthlessness needed to aban-
don beautiful but unprofitable children
of one's brain, the ability to get along
with all sorts of people and the gift of
selling one's services and one's product.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


eral years ago found the steel plants
then serving the automobile industry un-
equipped to supply the necessary wide,
hot- or cold-rolled strip steel. That is,
they were not prepared to furnish wide
strips in large quantities. The climb
back to business normalcy also found
the steel industry using more or less ob-
solete rolling equipment. During the de-
pression, definite advances had been
made in rolling technique, but installa-
tion required large amounts of capital
and, with no profits in prospect, none
was forthcoming. However, the new de-
mand for extra-wide strip from the auto-
mobile industry coupled with the mod-
ern trend toward fabrication with steel
as one piece rather than built up units
resulted in the erection of several en-
tirely new mills, incorporating all the
latest developments made up to date in
the rolling of steel strips. Since January,
1933, six new continuous hot-strip mills
have been placed in operation. These
plants are equipped to roll steel in strips
from 47 to a 100 inch width; each unit
represents an investment of from 7 to
20 million dollars or about 200,000 dol-
lars an inch. At the same time, many
of the old rolling mills have mechanized
and electrified their existing capital but

it is with the completely modern all-
electric mill that we are primarily in-
terested. Here is embodied all the re-
search and investigation of electrical,
mechanical, and civil engineers. All these
elements have gone to make a tremen-
dous enterprise operate with awe-inspir-
ing precision.
A modern hot-strip mill usually con-
sists of 10 main rolls arranged in tandem
formation. The first four rolls are the
roughing rolls; they are so separated
that the introduced slab is never under
two rollers at the same time. Modern
rolling mechanisms are entirely moti-
vated by electric motors and these
roughing stands are so operated, em-
ploying induction motors ranging in out-
put from 2500 to 5000 hp, and operat-
ing at a constant speed. The six finish-
ing stands are mounted as close together
as possible. The finishing rolls are
driven by a 600 volt, adjustable speed
D.C. motor whose capacity range is simi-
lar to that of the roughing motors. The
finishing train is activated by two or
more synchronous motor generators of
capacities between 4000 and 6000 K. W.
A complete installation requires a build-
ing about 1500 feet long and 100 feet
wide. At present speeds, a slab weigh-
ing several tons passes through the en-
tire process in about a minute—a speed
better than 17 miles per hour.
This is the process in general. Each
movement of the slab on its way to be-
coming strip steel necessitates a multi-
tude of synchronous processes all of
which are ingeniously regulated by the
latest photo-electric and electronic de-
vices.
One of these new electrical develop-
ments is an automatic signalling ar-
rangement by which the inspectors can

roughing rolls—it will end it in the finishing rolls about
a minute later—a speed better than 17 miles per hour.
* Below: "Modern mechanisms are entirely motivated
by electric rollers."

contrive the dimensions and conditions
of the travelling strip. Dimensions can
be regulated in thickness within a range
of one l/1000ths of an inch, in width
over S/16ths of an inch, and the length
of the strips cut are regulated in a 2-inch
range—all this when the strip is moving
at a speed between 1000 and 2000 feet
per minute. The system consists of one
or more receiver units placed where di-
mensional or conditional changes can be
made and several transmitting units lo-
cated at places convenient to the various
inspectors. Should the inspector decide
to change the gage of the strip he mere-
ly sets the required gage on the trans-
mitter and it immediately registers a
similar gage on all the other units in the
system; at the same time a bell or horn
sounds. The roller attendant observes
and makes the necessary changes in
gage, then sets the pointer on his units
to a position indicating that the order
has been carried out and it immediately
registers back to the transmitter. These
units are also capable of indicating
whether or not the strip is dirty and
where it should be marked for storage.
This is the standard for every other
operation during the entire rolling pro-
cess: every operation has become auto-
matic and mechanized; the entire pro-
cess being under the immediate control
and supervision of one man and only a
handful of men are used during the roll-
ing. Photo-electrically actuated electric
relays are used to replace mechanical
flag switches that were motivated by
contact with the steel in motion. Similar
arrangements are employed to actuate
furnace or annealing box doors at the
right moment. Electronic timers are
used in connection with the flying
shearers and other systems which must
operate in synchronism with movement
of the metal through the mill. Auto-
matically recording pyrometers check
the temperatures of the progressing strip.
The movement of the slabs is entirely
controlled by a man in a pulpit, similar
pulpits control the strip movements
through the tandem of rollers and
through the finishing train. The men in
these pulpits have a complete view of
their entire operation and thus can al-
ways operate at a maximum speed.
Finally there is the central ganglion
where the head roller directs and sees
the entire operation from a control panel.
This panel tells him the speed, dimen-
sions, temperature, and condition of
every strip at important points along the
1500 foot line of moving metal.
The head roller is in direct connection
with processing going on in the finishing
Elecrtical Engineering
train. Here is where the strip is ''dolled
up" preparatory to a shipment or cold
storage. The first step on the finishing
train is to run the strip through the con-
tinuous pickling bath. It then runs
through several tandem cold rolls, is
annealed and surface rolled and prepared
for inspection. After all the numerous
checks have been gone through on the
strip during the processing it is again
checked very carefully before shipment.
This inspection upon inspection may ap-
pear superfluous but it goes to make a
superior product.
In 1778 the first strip steel was rolled
between two hard rolls in a British fac-
tory. Continuous rolling was not intro-
duced into this country until 1868; it
was not until 10 years ago that 36 inch,
18 gage strip was successfully rolled in
America. Since then we find 21, con-
tinuous strip mills in operation and the
most modern of these producing 100
inch strip at something over 17 miles
per hour. Together, these mills are ca-
pable of producing 16,000,000 tons of
strip steel a year.

WALTER E. LAY
PROFESSOR OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
THOSE of us who attended the 1937
automobile shows were mildly dis-
appointed at the noticeable lack of start-
ingly new developments. To be sure,
there was the Willys with its new front,
the Ford with its choice of engines,
large or small, but mainly we saw pretty
much the same cars that we saw last
year, with the radiator grill bars hori-
zontal instead of vertical—the same old
bonnet with new trimmings. The rea-
soning behind this is fairly simple.
It is the general opinion of the manu-
facturers that next year's sales will
make a record. The big job will be to
produce cars not sell them. So why
throw the monkey wrench of new de-
sign into the production machinery
which had just begun to run smoothly
on last year's design? So they are get-
ting ready for next year's business with
more factory space and more machinery
but not much new design.
Perhaps then this is a good time to
take a general inventory of the state of
perfection of the automobile and com-
pare it with the automobile of several
years ago and with some of its contem-
porary machines. In the first place, the
automobile was never really a new
thing. It was an idea that had been car-
ried in many thinkers' minds for years.
It really began to make headway when
the light weight internal combustion en-
gine was developed. Even then it was
only a complicated collection of well-
known parts, each of which could be
usually made to operate by itself. How-
ever, when added to the hundreds of
other parts and mounted on a frame
that joggled and twisted over the rough
roads, it became one of the seven won-
ders that they would all operate to-
gether for the time required to run from
one garage or blacksmith shop to the
next.
Having watched with the greatest of
interest the development of the auto-
mobile for the past twenty-five years, I
have noted the effect of the development
of new materials, the effect of improved
roads, drivers' requirements, legislation
and many other factors. Sometimes a
type of design, discarded by all, would
be revived over night because a new

material had been developed which met
the requirements of strength, rigidity,
toughness or durability needed for that
design. The automobile was one of the
first machines to put a premium on high
strength or light weight materials. Many
parts require a special material to meet
its requirements in operation. Many
times we find that several materials are
used, each of which may have chemical
or physical characteristics much desired
but usually carrying with them some
very undesirable qualities. Thus we find
that both designs and materials are usu-
ally compromises.
In studying the change in design and
material trend it was found convenient
to plot against time the popularity of
each type as it was built into the car.
Each model is considered to be (and is)
the product of a group of engineers. It
represents their best guess as to the best
aggregation of parts and units for the
service for which that car was intended.
If for instance in 1935, 307' of the mod-
els use cast iron pistons, then 30% of
these engineering groups believed that
the cast iron piston was the best for gen-
eral use. In this way we can count the
ballots of the designing engineers each
year as the automobile show comes
around and the car specifications are
made available.
Let us look at such a statistical study
of the designs of fuel feed systems as
shown in Figure 1. Here we find that
in 1910 there were only two systems in
use, the gravity and the pressure feed
system. The former was simple and
cheap but might fail in climbing a very
steep grade where the carburetor was
above the level of fuel in the tank. It
was also a considerable fire risk, in fact
almost a certain fire risk in case of a
head-on collision. The latter system
placed the tank at the rear where its
weight is needed to help stabilize the

rear end, and where the tank is seldom
ruptured by collision. It was very ex-
pensive and very difficult to service if
an air leak, developed.
In 1914 a vacuum tank was devel-
oped, utilizing the intake manifold vacu-
um to draw gasoline from the storage
tank on the dash or engine, from whence
it ran by gravity to the carburetor. This
combined some of the advantages of
both the previous systems without most
of their disadvantages to such affect that
within four years over 80$ of the cars
used it and continued to use it over a
ten-year period. This new device had a
rather complex system of levers and
valves which, with gummy gasoline,
would occasionally stick fast. Then on
a long pull up a steep grade with the
throttle full, or nearly full open, the
manifold vacuum would not be great
enough to draw gasoline up hill from the
fuel tank and soon the vacuum tank
would be emptied and the motor would
stall.
Thus in 1927 when the diaphragm
type pump was developed it was re-
ceived by all with open arms and from
1933 to the present date all cars have

been using it. It is said that the reason
that a diaphragm type of pump had not
been previously developed was because
a suitable diaphragm material could not
be found. It is now made of silk cloth
impregnated with a material leaving the
diaphragm very flexible and at the same
time impervious to gasoline. Such a
statistical history may be plotted for
every part and assembly on the car and
if the reasons behind the changes and
development are understood a surpris-
ingly clear picture of the development
of that unit may be formed.
The first automobile race in America
was won in 1895 at a speed of S'/i miles
per hour. The first airplane flew in 1908
at just over 30 miles per hour. The first
Harmsworth Trophy Race was won in
1902 at 18 miles per hour. It is char-
acteristic of anything new that at the
beginning its development is rapid, so
that we find the increase of speed very
rapid at first, then as improvement be-
came more difficult less increases in
speed are obtained each year. That
seems to be a common characteristic of
travel by air, land or water. However
in the period 1925 to 1928 something
happened which changed this trend and
we find all three shooting upward to-
ward a new high.
With the suggestion that the one thing
common to all three of these curves is
the internal combustion engine, and that
about this time a great deal more was
learned about fuels, detonation, combus-
tion chamber design, supercharger de-
sign, etc., we will let you draw your own
conclusions in detail as to the cause for
this sudden increase in record speeds.
On this same Figure 2, a curve is
shown, near the bottom, that is desig-
nated, for want of a better term, the
"Normal Driving Speed." While it is
not based on scientific fact or accurate
data, but frankly on opinion, we still be-
lieve it is logical and a close approxima-
tion of fact. If an owner, driving his
own car, is going somewhere on a fine
day with an open road, without curves
or grades ahead of him, he is likely to
raise his speed to a certain point, and
continue on indefinitely at that speed.
The car is now humming along without
serious noise or vibration at the "normal
driving speed." The owner driver has
found, by trial, that any greater speed
will cause what he feels to be undue
vibration, noise, rattles, or something
that makes him uncomfortable. It then
becomes a more or less settled habit,
when road conditions permit, to drive
at this speed. This speed may be 10,
20 or 30 miles per hour less than the top
speed of the car. The data plotted as
normal speed was obtained by asking
friends to recollect the speed at which
they had driven different cars that they
had owned and plotting this speed at a
date say three years after the specified
model was built (i.e., at midlife since
the average life is about seven years).
A glance at the resulting curve shows
that it shoots upward at about the same
time that the speed records began to
rise. It is quite probable that the higher
top speed of the car caused many of us
to drive faster. But there was another
reason. The engine, the author of most
of our vibration and noise, was mounted
on rubber, and the vibration was no
longer transmitted to the frame. The
body is mounted on rubber on the frame
i1

so that no vibration could be trans-
mitted from frame to body. Then the
rumbling steel panels of the body had
been covered with a plastic material,
such that, had there been vibration,
there still would have been little noise.
If the hood is lifted we can see that the
engine vibrates and if the car windows
are open we can hear the engine noise
provided the noise of the tires and the
air rushing past the window is not too
great.
If I drive one of the new cars I always
keep an eye on the speedometer because
not long ago I got into a strange car and
drove it up to a speed of 95 miles an
hour before I was aware that it had
passed sixty. Thus are we being jock-
eyed or deluded into driving at speeds
higher perhaps than we can manage with
safety.
In Figure 2 the normal driving speed
is plotted to a larger scale and above
this is plotted the top speed of three
cars, one in each of three price classes.
Car A is in the lowest price class, Car B
in the middle range and Car C is in the
more expensive division. Following the
trend shown by the past, both the top
speed of the three cars and the average
normal speed curves are extended to the
year 1950. These estimates drawn in
1931 are exceeded by the 1937 figures
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


may have a speed of 100 miles per hour
in 19S0 if the present trend continues.
In Figure 4 is shown the maximum
horsepower of the engines for the same
three cars. This is the horsepower re-
quired to drive these cars up to the
speeds shown in Figure 3. In Figure 2
it may be seen that the speed of car
"A" in the year 1950 should be about
double that in 1924. The horsepower
required to drive car "A" at this speed
will be about 135 horsepower, and an
increase of about 460r£. Had the body
shape of the 1924 car "A" been un-
changed, considerably more power
would be required. Due to rounded cor-
ners and edges and a general smoothing
of contours the air resistance of the
body has been cut in half since 1924.
Having discussed some of the general
trends we may turn to some of the de-
tails on the 1937 car. As stated before,
the changes are in minor but never-
theless important details. These changes
are intended to increase the comfort,
convenience, and safety of the driver;
to improve the performance, efficiency,

and durability of the car; and even to
lessen the work of the service man.
More cars (in fact, 21 out of the 48
models) are using the hypoid gears in
the rear axle. In principle it is about
half-way between the work drive and
the spiral bevel gearing. The propeller
shaft for this type of gear lies nearly two
inches lower so that a lower floor may
be obtained without use of a tunnel.
This gearing has a very high tooth pres-
sure and was avoided until the extreme
pressure gear lubricant was developed.
This lubricant contains some acid but
oil retainers have been worked out
which keep the lubricant away from the
ball bearings.
The clutch for these larger engines
utilizes the centrifugal force acting on
weights on the clutch throwout levers
to help force the friction plates together.
A much softer spring may then be used,
and, at low engine speeds where most
clutch operation occurs, the operating
pedal pressure is much lower. The
clutch for the larger engine is now ven-
tilated by holes through the clutch and
flywheel. Through these holes air passes
and carries away the heat produced
when the clutch is slipping during en-
gagement. The change to all steel bodies
is almost complete. Thirteen models are
equipped with the overdrive which re-
duces the engine speed and improves the
fuel mileage when cruising. The com-
pression ratio has been raised from 5.8
last year to an average of 6.25 for the
standard cylinder heads. Six models offer
optional heads with lower compression
ratios and ten models offer higher com-
pression ratios averaging 6.95. This in-
crease in compression ratio, which will
increase both the power and efficiency of
the engine, has been accomplished
through better combustion chamber de-
sign and cooling and by the cooperation
of the refiners in raising the octane rat-
ing of the fuel.
Among the features that should better
the durability of our car is the universal
practice of rust-proofing practically all
external metal parts before painting.
Aluminum pistons are being anodized,
that is, treated with an acid which leaves
a coating of hard oxide on the surface
which will improve the wearing quality.
The importance of this is realized when
we consider that each piston travels
about a mile for each two miles the car
travels on the road. This same purpose
is furthered by the use of oil bath air
cleaners, which will take out grit and
sand which might otherwise reach the
upper end of the cylinders. It is again
aided by the increasing use of oil filters
which take grit and sand out of the oil
which floods the bearings and cylinder
walls. The use of full length water jack-
ets in 13 models allows closer regulation
of the temperature of the oil lubricating
the cylinder walls.
To help out the service man some
models have all the filler caps and oil
gage on one side of the car. Knock out
plugs are set in the dash so that a hot
water heater and radio may be installed
without laborious drilling of holes.
Grills are being provided in some mod-
els, at the lower edge of the windshield,
which when connected to the heater,
throw the hot air against the windshield
for defrosting. We find simplified direct
motion shock absorbers with less joints
to become loose or wear. Altogether

this year's changes are improvements of
minor details.
However with the cars growing bigger
and better with larger engines and more
comfort and convenience we do not find
a similar increase in cost. In fact the
cost per pound is less. For the lower
priced cars, it is about 19c per pound on
the tire (not on the hoof). The most
expensive car costs less than a dollar per
pound. A cast iron furnace may cost
10c per pound. One of the cheapest
electric refrigerators costs 35c per pound
and a cheap radio $1.00 per pound.
Even a good steak costs 25c per pound.

THE Middle-Atlantic states which lie
along the Mason and Dixon Line
are served by a railroad which grew from
several hundred miles of track to well
over 2,000 miles of service lines because
of its position as a developer of the West
Virginia coal fields. This railroad, the
Norfolk and Western, was one of the
few major roads to pay dividends during
the depression. Coal constitutes 80 per
cent of the line's revenue producing
traffic; appreciation of this fact by the
company has led it to instigate much
fuel research so as to better serve its
customers. The line established coal
bureaus at the main industrial centers
which it served with the result that they
are now able to market the many grades
of coal mined to those consumers who
are best equipped to use the various
types. American industrialists were
quick to see the advantage of adopting
fuel to do the work it was best suited to
do rather than the old hit-or-miss ar-
rangement.
Because of the heavy coal haulings of
this road they are constantly employing
the latest equipment developed for their
particular function. In 1935 the road
carried 32,000,000 tons of coal, much of
which was shipped to foreign consumers:
in the light of their large export trade we
see the line spending 1,500,000 dollars on
a new pier at Norfolk, Virginia. Here
5,000 coal cars can be accommodated;
the yard is equipped with tremendous
flood lights for night operation; ships
can be loaded at a rate of 2,000 tons per
hour without any undue strain on the
apparatus. Coal is this line's business
and its engineers see to it that they haul
coal faster and cheaper than the next
road.

DECEMBER, 1936

By
HAROLD J. FITZGERALD
Through special permission oj the editors oj Harper's Monthly the Michigan Technic
is able to present this unusual article to its readers.
OUR shoes sank into a springy net-
work so suggestive of chicken wire
that we stepped lightly in the fear of
pushing our feet through it. Between
its strands we saw a broad surface that
seemed to have daubed crudely with
greenish paint and left full ridges, but
which we knew from having just left it
was San Francisco Bay. The interval
was occupied by about four hundred feet
of air and an occasional sea gull.
From below, the festooned cable had
looked like a slender but quite solid
thing up against the sky. But as we
came out onto the catwalk we discovered
that it was made up of 37 smaller cables,
and that each of these was a bundle of
474 wires clamped together every few
yards. The bundles, or strands, as an
engineer called them, ran shoulder-high
beside us apparently out of and into in-
finity, and for no reason that we could
see had the multitudinous motion of a
bunched herd of galloping cattle. Later
the strands would be packed tightly to-
gether to form the 281i&gt;-inch cable of
the biggest bridge in the world, and the
combined strength of the 17,464 pencil-
like wires would support the heaviest
loads ever hung from anything in his-
tory.
On our way across the anchorage the
engineer had showed us how the strands
were looped through 37 eyebars embed-
ded in thousands of tons of concrete,
and then he had said a curious thing.
There were not really 17,464 wires;
there was one wire which ran back and
forth across the three-mile reach of bay
17,464 times. This came as a shock to
those of us who had supposed the cable
could be pulled up or let down to the
proper length before being fastened per-
mently, and someone remarked that it
didn't leave much room for adjustment.
The engineer laughed and said no, it
didn't.
As we filed out along the jouncing wire
netting, I thought of that single wire
weaving endlessly across the bay, be-
coming more and more irrevocable with
each loop; and of the possibility that
they would have to take the bridge apart
and start all over again.
"Don't worry," said the engineer
when I mentioned this. "It's all figured
out to a fraction of an inch."
"I shouldn't think there'd be much
figuring," said a man in a gray overcoat.
"Isn't it just a matter of dangling the
wires to the level of the roadway?"
"Not exactly," said the engineer.
"You see, that's just where we want
them. You never put a cable where you
want it, because then it'll go somewhere
else. You put it where you don't want
it."
We stared at him, and a man with a
cap and curved pipe said he thought he
could do that well himself. The engi-
neer said he was sure of it; the main
thing was to know the exact length of
the cable. And how, the man inquired,
resting an elbow on one of the jostling
strands, did one find that out?"
"We took the length of the span," the
engineer said. "These big ones are 2,-
310 feet. And the height of the road-
way—216."
"And the heights of the towers, of
course?"
"No. We had to find that out from
the cable."
"Well!" said the man. "I'd have done
it just the opposite!"
"That would be all right, too," nod-
ded the engineer, "if your bridge didn't
have to hold anything. We had to con-
sider the load. On these long spans it's
about 4,500 tons for each cable. From
that we had to compute cable tension."
"That's easy. Forty-five hundred
tons."
The engineer shook his head. "The
cable's not only carrying the load," he
explained. "It's pulling against itself."
He glanced around with brisk impatience
for something to illustrate his point.
"Say you stretched a string across a 20-
foot space and hang a ten-pound weight
on it. If it can sag only an inch the
tension will be about 600 pounds. Let
it sag a foot and the tension will go down
to 50 pounds. If it can stand a pull of
only ten pounds you'll have to let it
down five feet before it'll hold. It all
depends on the slope."
"Well then, what's the slope of the
cable?"
The engineer smiled. "Since it hangs
in a curve," he said, "it has a different
slope at every point. And a different
tension, too." He pulled out a note-
book, riffled the pages, and swiftly
wrote down a series of square-root signs,
parentheses, and factions, while the im-
patient rattle of an air-hammer came
muffled out of the distance and the cob-
webby catwalk swayed under us. "If it
sagged only one foot in 20," he said as
his pencil flew, "its greatest tension
would be nearly 13,000 tons. The cable
would have to be three feet nine inches
in diameter, and it would weigh 1,184
tons more than the load!"
We shook our heads, and gazed out
along the uneasy silver arc, wondering
at the ways of cables.
"Then why not let it sag ten or
even fifteen feet in twenty?" suggested
the man with the pipe.
"At fifteen in twenty," said the engi-
neer after a few flicks of his pencil, "the
sag would be 1,725 feet. Add that to
the height of the span and you get near-
ly 2,000 feet for the height of your
towers!"
"Oh!" said the man with the pipe.
"Five in twenty would still run them
up to 800. So we had to find the com-
bination of tension and sag that would
12

the sag at 266 feet, a little over two in
20, which gave the cable a tension of
5,200 tons. That made the towers 502
feet high."
The man in the overcoat produced a
memorandum book and rested it open,
against the cable. "I used to be pretty
good in trigonometry," he said. He
drew a triangle, frowned, then started
over by drawing a circle. He moistened
his lips and tapped his automatic pencil
against the dull steel. "What do I take
for a radius?" he asked. "Two-sixty-
six, or—"
"Neither," said the engineer.
You can't, it seems, measure cables as
you do straight lines or arcs of circles.
They're parabolas, and when you start
measuring parabolas you leave plane
geometry and most of your friends be-
hind and get up among the spiral nebu-
lae of integral calculus.
The engineer made the calculations
for us there on the windy catwalk, and
it flashed out the cable length—2,392!
The man with the pipe heaved a deep
sigh. "And I thought you hung cables
like clotheslines!" he said. He gazed at
the glistening curve that swung like a
swallow's path from tower to tower.
"Just 2,392 feet from there to there!"
he murmured.
"Oh no!" corrected the engineer. "Not
yet. Steel stretches. The cable won't
get its full length till the load is on it.
We know how far steel stretches under
tension. So we figured the tension at
each of the 70 suspender ropes."
"And subtracted the total stretchings
from 2,392?"
"No," said the engineer, "There was
a little more to it than that. If a 20-
foot rope will stretch a foot, you can't
make it 20 by starting with 19, because
the 19-foot rope will stretch only nine-
teen-twentieths of a foot. That wouldn't
be so bad, but when you shorten a cable
you decrease its slope. That increases
the tension and makes it stretch more.
But as it stretches its slope increases, so
that it stretches less and less. And of
course that's going on at different rates
in different parts of the cable—"
"You're not trying to tell me," broke
in the man with the overcoat, "that any
human being could figure that out!"
"Lots of them. We found that if we
made the cable 2,388 feet long it would
stretch four feet to 2,392."
The man in the overcoat murmured,
"Twenty-three eighty-eight!" wonder-
ingly, and slapped a corrugated strand.
"But you haven't told us how you meas-
ured off those 2,388 feet."
"Oh, we couldn't measure them off on
the cable. We gave each wire the prop-
er sag, and that made it the right
length."
"You let them sag a little less than
266—?"
"Not 266," the engineer interrupted.
"You're thinking of the parabola, the
shape the cable takes after it's loaded.
When it's first strung up it takes a very
different curve, called a catenary. So we
calculated the sag of a catenary 2,388
feet long with a 2,310-foot span."
"I suppose that meant a lot more in-
tegrals?"
"Not at all. It was merely necessary
to find, by successive trials, a number
which, when divided by its own hyper-
bolic sine, would equal the cable-length
divided by half the span, then multiply
this by the hyperbolic cosine of half
the span divided by the number. The
result, when the original number was
subtracted from it, yielded our answer—
which was 235."
"Then," said the man with the pipe,
"you gave the wires a sag of 235 feet,
and that made them 2,388 feet long?"
The engineer nodded. "And when the
span's in place they'll stretch—"
"They'll first turn into a parabola
with a sag of 256 feet. Then they'll
stretch four feet, which will make them
sag another ten, and just meet the
bridge 216 feet above the water."
"About measuring that sag," said the
man in the overcoat. "You couldn't
have done it from above because there's
nothing up there. Did you measure
down to the water?"
"No. We set up a transit on one
tower and aimed it at a point on the
next. The points were calculated so
that when the cable's vertex crossed the
line of sight it would be 235 feet below
the tower tops."
"Well that was simple enough," said
the man, with relief.
"Only," said the engineer, "that we
had to allow for the shape of the earth."
"Of the earth!"
"Certainly. Those towers are nearly

straight across we'd have hit 1.28 inches
too high."
"Well, that was the last of your prob-
lems, surely!"
"Almost. We still had to consider
the temperature of the air. When the
morning sun warms the east side of a
tower, the steel expands and it leans to
the west. In the afternoon it leans to
the east, like a sunflower in reverse.
"Hardly. We pointed a collimator, or
sort of telescope, straight down from the
top of each tower, and when it was ex-
actly on a mark at the bottom it meant
the tower was vertical. We had tele-
phones on the towers, and when we got
word that both were vertical at the same
time, we did our sighting."
Again we silently regarded the gal-
loping strands. Somebody asked if that
was why they were constantly in mo-

and the bay air cools the lower ones, the
internal strains cause a complicated set
of motions. And parts of them are al-
ways warmed or cooled at different rates.
It's no wonder they're never still."
"But all those close calculations," said
the man in the overcoat, "are true only
once in a while then?"
"Check," said the engineer. "There
are no absolute dimensions in a big
bridge like this. The towers are not
only swaying all the time, but they're
stretching up and down. And they're
being spread apart or drawn together by
their bracing girders. The cable is ris-
ing and falling and shortening and
lengthening, and so is the span under it,
sometimes as much as nine feet a day.
Every piece of metal in the bridge is
changing its size and shape every minute
day and night. The whole thing is con-

half of a walnut shell, came in sight
through the chicken wire, inched along
under our feet.
"What's the use of such fine calcu-
lations, then," the man protested, "when
they aren't true the minute after you
make them?"
"Oh, these squirmings and shiftings
don't bother us," said the engineer.
"They're all calculated in advance, too."
"You mean you can tell what this
bucking steel bronco will be doing at any
minute?"
"Sure," said the engineer. He dug his
rubber heel into the wire netting and
started down the spring catwalk. "That's
all figured out."
But we didn't ask him how he did
that. We were becoming a little dizzy
up there among the hyperbolic cosines.

"At the meeting of the American Chemical Society Emile F. du Pont, per-

contacts with young college graduates had shown him that they concentrate too
much on winning a diploma and not enough on the things that lie beyond the
diploma.
"'The young graduate comprehends too little of the economic aspects of
his work,' he said, 'it is still true that industrialists must think in terms of in-
come and outgo, in terms of sales revenue and costs. The student can hardly
learn too soon that the dollar sign is an unwritten but potent factor in every

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


If you should be walking past the
West Engineering building and encoun-
ter a young man indulging in the ancient
pastime of whistling, the chances are
that you have seen John Ingold. John
is the perfect example of a local boy
making good—not in the big city—but
right in his own home town—in the Uni-
versity of Michigan College of Engineer-
ing.
Aside from his weakness for filling the
air with mouth-music we find that John
has that rare gift of eloquent expression
which is so rare among engineers. This
quality along with good humor and ca-
pabilities as an engineer led to his elec-
tion to the presidency of the local
branch of the A.S.M.E. Further evi-
dence of John's popularity among his
fellow mechanic-
al engineers is the
fact that he was
secretary of his
class in '34 and
'35.
John has been
a member of
the Engineering
Council for three
years, has been
initiated into Vul-
John Ingold cans. senior en-
gineering honor-
ary society, and
served as ticket
chairman of last year's Engineering
Ball.
Ingold spends his summers at a boy's
camp on Burt Lake in northern Michi-
gan, where he is a junior counselor en-
gaged in the task of educating youth to
the wonders of nature and the health-
fulness of the outdoor life.
John's professional interests are in the
field of industrial management and ad-
ministration, where he will concentrate
his efforts upon graduation this June.

was very effective. In spite of playing
on a football team which has won only
six games in the last three years, his

SPOTLIGHT
sincerity, sportsmanship and ability
have earned for him honorable mention
on this years All American Football
Team.
Born in Detroit, Cedric Sweet was
raised and went to High School in Free-
mont, Michigan. He played center and
fullback on the High School team, and
in his last year was captain and earned
an All-State position. Upon entering
Michigan in 1932 he immediately went
out for freshman football and basketball,
and earned his numerals in each. Un-
fortunately, due to sickness, Ced had
to leave school in 1933, but he returned
In 1934 and has held down the post of
varsity fullback ever since.
Ced is enrolled in the department of
geodesy and surveying, and although
he has been carrying a heavy schedule
he has been working his way entirely.
His jobs have been many and varied,
ranging from de-
livering The
Daily to acting
as bouncer at the
Michigan the-
atre.
In recognition
of his sincerity
as a student and
athlete, Ced was
elected to Tri-
angles at the end
of his Sophomore
year, and during
the last year he
has received the call from Vulcans, the
senior honor society. He was also elect-
ed vice-president of his class in his
junior year.
When not playing football Ced likes
to get his exercise by boxing. An ar-
dent bridge player and very interested
in modern swing music, Ced never lacks
for amusement when not devoting his
time to work or study.
Last summer he was employed on a
surveying crew and this summer he ex-
pects to spend at the surveying camp in
Wyoming.

MR. SECRETARY
David C. Eisendrath is inordinately
proud of the fact that he was born and
received his early schooling in Win-
netka, Illinois. In fact, from hearing
him talk, one would suppose Chicago a
suburb of Winnetka, rather than Win-
netka a suburb of Chicago.
When Dave was a young boy in ele-
mentary school it seems he had trouble
with arithmetic, in fact he could never
pass the speed arithmetic tests. We
don't know if that is the reason, but he
is now majoring in mathematics, and,
they say, he is doing very well. He still
complains that he has a lot of trouble
with some of his courses, and we can
easily believe him as he occasionally
gets only a "B" in a course instead of
his usual "A."
The Engineering course at Michigan
is stiff enough that many men need five
years to complete it, yet Dave is expect-
ing, in five years, to get his B.S. De-
grees in Mathematics, Electrical Engin-
eering, and Mechanical Engineering.
Dave started getting good marks in his
first year, and although he claims he has
"lousy" hand writing, the boys must
have gained the impression that he was
good at taking notes, for as soon as he
became a mem-
ber of Phi Eta
Sigma, he was
elected secretary.
That is a job that
he now knows
very well, as he
has been succes-
sively elected sec-
retary of Tau
Beta Pi and
A.I.E.E. He has
also been elected
secretary - trea-
surer of the Math-
ematics Club, of
which, as in other societies to which he
belongs, he has been an outstanding
member. Recently, to top off his
achievements while here at Michigan, he
was elected to the position of Senior
representative on the Engineering Coun-
cil.

THE CONSUMER TALKS
No longer does an engineer produce
one of his brain-storm ideas and market
it, hoping it will meet public approval.
In this day and age, he employs various
forms of consumer's research and gets
statistical information as to just what
the customer desires and then goes
ahead to match his production with the
demand.
Look at this year's General Motors
Customers Research questionnaire,
mailed to over 1,000,000 motorists
throughout the country who own all
makes of cars. They discovered that
what drivers want is dependability and
operating economy above all, with safe-
ty, comfort, appearance, ease of control,
first cost, smoothness, pickup and speed
following in order.
85.27c of the customers want solid
steel tops on their next cars; 86.lc/c
desire no-draft ventilation; 71.8% voted
for radio equipment. General Motors
accepts this verdict of public opinion as
a guide for design—the consumer is the
only one qualified to state what he
wants in a car; why not satisfy him?
In 1935 only 77% of the car owners
voiced their approval of streamline design
while this year the figure has jumped to
90Ac/c. As a result the 1938 cars will
reveal even greater trends toward
streamlining because the manufacturers
know that their radical measures are
meeting public sanction with no decrease
in sales forthcoming.

TRADITION IN DESIGN
A distinguished observer at the Brit-
ish Chemical Plant Manufacturers' Ex-
hibition found that each exhibitor of
chemical manufacturing equipment was
most proud of his fine craftsmanship
and long tradition of highly specialized
experience. A knowledge of chemical
engineering or of chemical industries
was of little concern to these equipment
makers. They prefer to leave the prob-
lems of where and how their pumps, or
evaporators, or stoneware pipes are to be
used to their customers with the conse-
quence that British plants are often not
the carefully coordinated and finely de-
signed processes that are found in the
efficient and economical American
plants.
Although this traditional background
discourages the development of any radi-
cally new designs, it does result in great-
er care in machining and finishing of
machines and equipment.
THE BATTLE OF METALS
The keen competition between the
various alloy steels, the ordinary carbon
steels and the light, non-ferrous alloys
may lead one to think that the field of
structural metals has about reached the
limit of its expansion, but according to
Mr. S. K. Colby, vice-president of the
Aluminum Company of America, this is
not the case. In an article in a recent
issue of Iron Age which was reprinted,
in part, in the Aluminum News-Letter,
he says:
"If today we knew enough about the
metals to make or do all the things that
we shall one day be making or doing
with them, the present production capa-
city of every metal would probably be
wholly inadequate to meet the demand.
Or if by some magic we could abolish
the human inertia that necessitates our
spending years and years convincing
people-in-the-mass that they should ac-
cept and use the new things that indus-
try creates for their welfare, the result
would be the same. There would not be
enough of any of the metals to go
around. For metals enter into the con-
struction or production of an amazingly
large percentage if the things we use in
our daily life.
"The trouble seems to be that we are
prone to mistake the daily competitive
tilts-at-the-desk-of-the-buyer for bitter
and sanguinary battles. There will al-
ways be keen competition for orders. It
is probably best that there should be.
It stimulates progress, improves service,
keeps prices in line, and makes business
interesting. But the advance of the met-
als is not actually made in the buyers'
offices, at least not in a fundamental
sense, any more than military advances
are actually made by the troops in the
front line trenches. They are usually
planned and prepared long in advance
in places remote from the field of action.
"If we must indulge ourselves in the
"Battle of the Metals" metaphore, let
us realize at least, that the real struggle
is going on far behind the sales lines, in
the research laboratories, and that the
plans are focused on a distant objective.
Research men are working two, five, ten,
twenty years in the future. In very few
instances are they working on problems
of competition as such, but rather of
strength, durability, ductility, adapta-
bility, finish, production economy, and
the like. Campaigns of fundamental im-
provement, not petty competitive bat-
tles. Activities centered on increasing
the cost of whatever metal they happen
to be investigating."
PROTECTION GUARANTEED
A buyer of machinery and equip-
ment in merry England is permitted to
import a machine only when no similar
device is manufactured in England, or
her colonies; or when such machines
as are made at home cannot serve the
buyer's purpose. When there is any
doubt as to whether the machines of
British manufacture are satisfactory,
the question is always settled in favor
of the domestic concern. This protec-
tion is carried out by the British Board
of Trade through an intricate tariff
system.

ECONOMICS
DIMES. DOLLARS AND AUTOS
THE automobile industry expects to
produce more than 5,000,000 cars
during the year ending next November.
Perhaps that number loses its signifi-
cance to a reader accustomed to inte-
grade between positive and negative in-
finity—but that figure represents the
output of 1929, the highest figure ever
reached by the automotive industry. A
dime saved on every car sent through
the assembly line means $500,000 at
the end of the production schedule. That
is real money, and Detroit manufac-
turers like to have engineers around to
pick up these stray dimes. Time study
men, efficiency experts, schedule men,
and a host of others are always on the
warpath with any particular unit of a
plant that appears to be running high
in operating costs.
Professor Gordy of the Mechanical
Engineering Dept. offers us an interest-
ing case from his work with a major
Detroit firm. Like any other plant em-
ploying the assembly-line system of pro-
duction, the output of the entire system
was the output of any one unit along
the line. Thus, if a punchpress was
capable of only 1500 holes a day and
one hole of that particular type was
punched on the motor of each car, then
1500 cars was the maximum capacity
of the assembly. This feature of the
assembly line method of manufacture is
both a blessing and a detriment. Obvi-
ously it is not good plant management
to have the amount of production lim-
ited by so insignificant a factor as a
single hole, yet it makes for greater
speed and specialization to have all the
processing going into the final product
as one continuous arrangement. Several
alternative methods would present them-
selves to an engineer given the problem
of cutting costs, and yet increasing pro-
duction. He could either increase the
capacity of the machine or inaugurate a
parallel assembly line or a parallel
punching unit. A parallel assembly line
would double output but it would not
in any way lessen unit costs; a parallel
punching unit would allow the line twice
as many punched motors but the line
could not absorb it without completely
disrupting the synchronous movement of

Factory Management
the product. Should the extra punching
unit be used at partial capacity when it
becomes a partial as working capital?
So the engineer begins to study the
status quo of the assembly line to see
what can be done.
The investigators found that the ex-
isting assembly line system could be im-
proved but slightly, and these improve-
ments were chiefly in increasing each
man's productivity rather than intro-
ducing new capital. Also it was found—
as Messers. Bye and Hewitt have stat-
ed—that simplifying each man's opera-
tion (specialization) would increase
production and decrease the costs. How-
ever, it was seen that the greatest in-
efficiencies were located in the machin-
ing and processing previous to joining
the major assembly line. Thus all the
similar operations were placed in one
department—i.e., all the milling ma-
chines, planers, lathes and the like were
placed as units throughout the plant.
This necessitated a good deal of inter-
departmental trucking for the complete
processing of a unit. Also, delays and
disturbances to the transportation of the
units left expensive capital equipment
idle. This situation was quickly reme-
died by completely rearranging the en-
tire processing system. Thus, if a
product was to be first planed then turn-
ed on a lathe, and finally punched, the
new system saw the unit start down a
row of machines consisting of a planer,
lathe, and punch press set end to end.
At the end of the row was the major
assembly line with the car ready to re-
ceive that particular unit. The ad-
vantages were immediately obvious:
upon completion of the installation, one
thousand less machines were being used
and the fixed investment was decreased
by $1,500,000. That sum could earn be-
tween $75,000 and $90,000 a year in in-
terest—a nice saving in just one depart-
ment. And so the story went through-
out the plant. Space was extremely
valuable since the plant was located in a
dense manufacturing area and land
prices were high. No space was left for
stock at any of the machines; it came
and left on a conveyor with a speed
timed to the second. All machines were
individually driven making for greater
safety with elimination of multitudes of
belts and for lower power costs.
After everything possible was done to
the capital equipment and schedules, the
last element entering the picture was the
employee. An incentive system was in-
augurated based on the efficiency of pro-
duction rather than the speed of opera-

1,500 screws would be necessary to
produce 1500 units—if more were used,
screws were being wasted and the em-
ployees bonus suffered. If the bodies
were scratched, this, too, was indicated
in the bonus rates.
After the change had been made, in-
vestigation brought forth the advantages
wrought by merging technical progress
with everyday economics. Due to im-
proved plant layout, productive labor
was saved and operating efficiency in-
creased. Inter-divisional material han-
dling was greatly reduced and each unit
was handled fewer times decreasing the
number of operators required. The last
advantages proved to be the most im-
portant; fixed investment was reduced
and each job was supervised easier since
the foremen had their unit-process close
at hand. In actual unit costs, the money
saved was tremendous. Previously,
during a unit time period, 210 cars were
produced using 18 office men and 46 fac-
tory men. Under the new system 300
cars per unit time are produced using 5
office men and 28 factory employees.
Assuming a car to cost $1000 and labor
to cost six dollars per unit, the first sys-
tem produced $210,000 worth of cars
using $384 of labor, or one dollar of la-
bor gave you $550 worth of product.
The second system gave $300,000 worth
of product at a labor cost of $218 or one
dollar of labor gave you $1,375 worth of
product. This shows a total increase in
efficiency of 150^ of both capital and
labor. With these savings before you,
it is easy to see why automobile execu-
tives keep engineering expeditions
sleuthing through their plants.

COMMENTARIES
A case from the files. The following
letters have been highly compressed,
with all identifying data changed. This
young E. E. graduate joined a large
company several months ago. He re-
cently wrote—
"Dear Professor Moore: I have been
kept very busy at United Conditioner,
running many interesting tests. The
work slows up at times, but usually it is
thoroughly enjoyable. I now have an
offer from MovieGen, a small but grow-
ing three-year-old company in Neon-
burg. I would start at my present sal-
ary. At first I would be wiring control
panels for the motor-generator sets
(which supply power to motion-picture
projectors). I would then go out to
service the installed equipment. The
company plans to put in an experi-
mental department, and they expect to
use me there part of the time.
"The job offers me a chance to get
into electrical work in my home town.
I dislike the idea of jumping from one
company to another, but can't help con-
sidering the offer seriously. MovieGen
is young and growing, and I might get
ahead faster with them. However,
United Conditioner is old, large, well-
established. I would appreciate any
pointers . . . must decide by the end
of the week . . . K. M. Martin."
"Dear Martin: Starting all over again
when you have been out of school only
a year or two, and at the same salary
or perhaps less, is all right provided the
future really is there. MovieGen is in
a young field with a fine future. (To
the reader: the actual industry, con-
cealed here, does have a splendid future;
whereas, motor-generator sets for the
movies are old, well-developed, stabil-
ized). Whether MovieGen in particular
will continue to go ahead, rests partly
with ownership and management, partly
with unknowns of the future. Owner-
ship is likely to be important. Many
small companies are family-owned, and
work exceedingly well for many years.
Others, family-owned, soon suffer from
unwise interference with management.
"Another factor is location. Neonburg
is a fairly well industrialized locality.
On the other hand, it is enough removed
from any large industrial area to take
it somewhat out of competitive influ-
ence; employers there may be able to
hire engineers at lower rates. This may
or may not be offset by cheaper living
conditions. You will have to decide
that.
"Unless you have found out about
ownership, and also the past record of
success of those in immediate charge, I
should think twice if I were you, about
changing from a company like United.
United is large, successful, stable, fully
alive and forward-looking. Its relations
with employees are excellent. It is sub-
ject to many competitive influences,
both as to holding its men, and its posi-
tion in industry. Its "life" is more or
less an open book. Many people know
of its policies concerning employees. All
these things help to keep a good large
company on the right track. Whereas,
the small company is known to and
criticised by, far fewer people. Hence,
it is very much up to the individual to
know plenty about the small company
before joining it. . . . You see, you will
have to make the decision. I don't
know the facts about MovieGen which
—presumably—you have looked into.
Please let me know your decision. . . .
A. D. Moore."
"Dear Professor: . . . Since your let-
ter came, I have been to Neonburg
again, and had another interview with
Mr. Blank. Their proposition still
sounded good, but I have decided to re-
main with United. My present superior,
Mr. Dash, tells me I am doing very
nicely, and that I should have plenty
of opportunity with the company. . . .
Thanks again. . . . Martin."
"Dear Martin: It appears you made
the right decision, and I hope you will
never regret it. Often, the one big value
in getting an offer from another com-
pany, is the opportunity it gives you to
go to your superior and have a pertinent
talk. When he lets down the bars and
tells you (as nearly as he can) where
you stand, it means he is a good man to
work for. With the hope that your work
continues to be interesting, and that
your progress continues to bring added
responsibilities, . . . A. D. Moore."
In presenting the above case, it is not
in the least implied that one should
never change from a large to a small
company. The point is, such a change

some pertinent facts in mind. Note spe-
cifically that my advice was incomplete,
inadequate, and heavily padded with
speculation as to the character of the
small company. Assuming that Martin
looked into the small company as sug-
gested, does it follow that he then had
everything to be desired, on which to
base a decision? Not at all. In a lim-
ited time, one seldom, if ever, can get
all of the facts that might be desired.
Even in an unlimited time, there may
remain a residue of facts about both the
old and the new positions that is unas-
certainable. And the point in that is,
that many a major decision in a man's
career has to be made with some of the
facts lacking. The time in which to de-
cide to take a new position is always
limited. One's facilities for acquiring
information are always limited. The
man who refuses to decide until he has
all the facts, will never decide at all. He
has never learned that sometimes some
very important things must be taken
for granted, and that every time he de-
cides either to stay or to go, there is
likely to be some risk. After all, which
individual among us has the right to re-
quire that he, of all people, shall be re-
lieved from the risks involved in making
decisions?

NOTEBOOK
PLACING THE DECIMAL POINT
It is surprising to note how many en-
gineers come through four years of Uni-
versity training in engineering without
learning some simple rule for placing
the decimal point, when making slide
rule calculations. In this, the second in-
stallation of the "Engineers Notebook"
series, we present a simple and accurate
method of placing the decimal point
which is applicable to a series of multi-
plications and divisions of any length.
Examples will best illustrate the method.
Multiplication
22X35 = 77 (on the slide rule).
To place the decimal point: Add the
whole number digits of the multipliers:
2 + 2 = 4. We note that the right
hand index of the slide extends to the
right of the right-hand index of the D
scale. Whenever this occurs (in multi-
plication) subtract one from the sum of
the digits. The result in the above case
is 4 — 1=3. This number is the num-
ber of digits in the product. Therefore:
22 X 35 = 770. // the slide extends to
the left simply add the number of digits
in the multipliers. Example: 20 X 70
= 14. The sum of the digits in the mul-
tipliers equals 2 + 2=4. Therefore:
20 X 70 = 1400. When one of the mul-
tipliers is less than one it has a digit
value of 0. Example: 22 X .35 = 77.
The number of digits is 2+0 = 2.
Subtracting one because the slide ex-
tends to the right we have a result of
one digit in the product. Therefore:
22 X .35=7.7.
Division
8000
= 4 (on the slide rule).
20
Add the whole number digits of the
numerator and assign them a positive
value, in this case + 4. Then add the
whole number digits of denominator giv-
ing them a negative value, equals — 2.
Then take the algebraic sum of these
two numbers: 4 — 2 = 2. When the
slide extends to the right (in division)
add 1 to the number of digits already
The Ttend ok -flutomow/e development
(cont.)
When one takes into consideration the
high priced materials — copper, nickel,
tin, cloth, alloy steels, bakelite, etc., that
go into the building of this car, and then
adds to it the remarkable fabrication it
undergoes before it appears as a finished
product, it really is a remarkable
achievement for these factories to pay
dividends from a product that retails at
less than 20c per pound.
This remarkable achievement is the
result of pinching pennies—one-tenth of
a cent here, one-fourth of a cent there.
Sitting at a lunch table I once heard a
heated argument between the factory
engineer of an automobile plant and the
chief engineer of a plant building gener-
ators. The question to be decided was
whether or not they should spend one-
fourth of a cent to improve the gener-
obtained giving, in this case, 3 digits in
8000
the quotient. Therefore: =400.
20
If the slide protrudes to the left it is
only necessary to take the algebraic sum
of the digits in the numerator and de-
nominator as directed above (omitting
the correction for the protruding of the
rule).
Multiplication and Division
Combined
22 X 35 X -15
= 107 (on the slide
6 X .05 X 36
rule).
Handle the whole numerator first in
a straight multiplication. The first step,
22 X 35, gives 770. Keeping in mind
the 3 digits multiply 770 by 0.15 (0 dig-
its) and the slide extends to the left,
hence there are still three digits, or
115.5. Then, start dividing, remember-
ing that there are 3 digits in the nume--
ator. Divide 115.5 by 6 and the slide
protrudes to the left: deduct one for th^
one-digit number 6 leaving 2 digits in
the quotient. Divide this quotient.
19.25, by 0.05 (minus a minus one digit,
or plus one) gives 385 with the slide to
the left. Finally divide by the two-digit
number 36, deducting 2 and adding one
because the slide extends to the right,
giving a two-digit number 10.7.
A little practice will make the process
of keeping track of the decimal point
automatic.
• • •
ator considerably. It was finally agreed
that the improvement should be made.
The automobile factory engineer stated
that the cost of the car could not be in-
creased but added that he knew where
he could get that one-fourth of a cent—
meaning that somewhere he could pinch
off another 2V2 mills from the total cost.
It is probable that in no other machin0
that we buy, do we really get as much
value for our money as we obtain when
we accept delivery of a 1937 automobile.

the daily total of 5,000 Dowmetal
die-castings for the new Hoover
One-Fifty Electric Cleaner.

What DOWMETAL is doing for HOOVER

In the new Hoover One Fifty,
Dowmetat is used in five different
partsfromthehandle boil to the
intricate main housing. In these
five parts a total weight saving of
over two pounds is achieved
without the slightest sacrifice of
structural strength.
The amazing lightness made
possible by Dowmetal has
caused thousands of women to
abandon their present cleaner
for the lighter, easier handled
Hoover.
Lightness to the utmost limit, without
sacrifice of strength or durability,
was a major objective when Hoover
set out to re-design its famous line
of electric cleaners.
After considering every factor
Hoover adopted Dowmetal.
For Dowmetal is actually a/nil third
lighter than aluminum yet possesses
comparable strength and durability.
Thus, it carries lightness of con-
struction far beyond the pos-
sibilities of any other
commercial metal or
alloy.
While the use of

Dowmetal in the Hoover One Fifty
constitutes its first appearance in
a product of general public use,
it has long demonstrated its value
in portable power tools, trucks,
machinery, foundry flasks and many
other products.
Dowmetal opens the way to the com-
plete—not partial—elimination of
useless, power-consuming or sales-
retarding weight.
Complete information concerning
the characteristics, uses and methods
of fabrication is contained in "The
Dowmetal Data Book." A copy will

A.S.M.E. ROAST
Rumors are that some of our profes-
sors have been worrying, fearing for the
worst at the Second Annual A.S.M.E.
Roast at the Union on December 16.
Students at the Engineering Ball started
the roasting in a mild manner by their
now famous book-ends, which featured
in a rough and ready way possible fac-
ulty candidates. Not to be outdone, the
Mechanicals under the able and elo-
quent John Ingold insist that they too
will make it plenty hot for all the profs
in attendance.
Professor E. L. Ericksen has con-
sented to be "Roastmaster'' for the oc-
casion, probably in order to keep his
own name off the floor. The committee
in charge promises a fine dinner and a
lively program.
INSTITUTE OF AERONAUTICAL
SCIENCES
Lieutenant C. D. Griffin, Officer of
the United States Navy, now enrolled in
the Graduate School, addressed the last
meeting of the Institute of Aeronautical
Sciences on Naval Aviation on Decem-

taining and enlightening, Lieutenant
Griffin presenting a very vivid picture
of his experiences and observations in
the air service.
The Institute has grown considerably
since its inception here last year. The
society now boasts one of the largest
memberships on the campus, according
to Willis Hawkins, president and Mr.
B. L. Springer, honorary chairman. In
the future the society plans to bring
notable engineers and aviators to the
campus and also visit nearby airports
and factories to better acquaint the stu-
dent with the practical side of his pro-
fession.
GLIDER CLUB
For the last few weeks there has been
a new Dodge truck dashing around the
streets of Ann Arbor. This red-hued
vehicle is the proud possession of the
Glider Club. It was purchased at the
beginning of this year to replace the
once honest and sturdy, but now de-
crepit Buick, which has served the Club
so faithfully for the past few years. The
new truck will be used, as was the old
car, to transport students to and from
the Ann Arbor Airport; and to tow the
glider up and down the field on train-
ing flights.
This year the members of the club
are using the Franklin Utility type glid-
er, which they have used so successfully
for the past few years, for their train-
ing flights. They have also redesigned
and are rebuilding the primary type
glider which they expect will be ready
for use by the beginning of the second
semester.
One of the oldest and most successful
glider clubs in the country, the club
here is well on its way to completing its
eighth successive year of operation, and
we expect, before the year is up, that
many more men will have been initiated
into the arts of the bird men.

Photographic Surveying began in this country about 50 y:ars ago with the University of Michigan offering a fundamental
course for over twenty years and an advanced course during the past 5 years. The camera has been a valuable aid to engineers
engaged in field surveys since photographs make the best record of physical conditions in the field and of the character and
quality of monuments. It is natural that the field engineers keep a record of the progress of contruction by means of frequent
photographs. Today the availability of the airplane and special cameras for taking photographs from the air represent a
highly efficient and specialized technique of surveying. Students who complete the basic courses in our college, together
with a broad training in the fundamentals of surveying, may soon qualify as experts in particular fields as they complete the
necessary specialized training involved.

NUMBER 7000
JUST as if timed to take part in the 25th birth-
day celebration of the General Electric shops in
Erie, Pa., Locomotive Number 7000 recently bowed
its way out of its shed and took a brilliant turn on
the test track.
The first of Number 7000's predecessors was begun
in Erie in 1911, or just 25 years after electrical manu-
facture had commenced in Schenectady. Since that
lime locomotives weighing from 1J^ to 300 tons have
been turned out to improve haulage electrically. This
range includes types for every sort of service—
straight electric with trolley pole or third-rail shoe,
battery types, internal-combustion engines, and
combinations of different designs.
The Erie plant is notable for its contributions to
practically every phase of modern electric transporta-
tion. The electrification of terminals and railroads
has been accomplished largely with Erie equipment.
Many of the new high-speed trains, which have
aroused so much interest in rail travel, and many
urban transit vehicles, such as street cars, trackless
trolley coaches, and diesel-electric buses, likewise
use Erie equipment.

FIFTY YEARS OF WELDED BLISS
"WO pieces of metal were joined in "weldlock"
fifty years ago. That was in 1886, when Pro-
fessor Elihu Thomson, one of America's greatest
pioneers in the field of electrical science and co-
founder of the General Electric Company, invented
resistance welding—fusing metals by placing them
in contact and passing an electric current through
them.
To mark the golden anniversary and to honor the
man who officiated at the "ceremony," the Detroit
Section of the American Welding Society dedicated
a recent program to Professor Thomson's invention.
The years have seen resistance welding develop
from its purely experimental stage into a process of
metal fabrication that is wide in application. Metal
radio and industrial tubes and parts, automobile
bodies, the high-strength aluminum alloys used in
aircraft, farm implements, the new lightweight
railway equipment—all are fabricated by resistance
welding.

SUNSHINE IN MANHATTAN
AT last there is sunshine—sunshine for those who
J^L spend so much of their hurried fives in the
shadows of Manhattan's financial district. For in his
new downtown recreation and health center—largest
of its kind in the world—Artie McGovern, famous
trainer and physical director, has equipped both the
hot room and gymnasium with ultraviolet sunlamps.
Installed by General Electric engineers in the form
of 26 ceiling units—probably the largest installation
ever made in a single location—they not only afford
health-giving artificial sunshine but are the sole
means of illuminating the two rooms.
This installation marks another step forward in the
field of lighting. The development of better lamps
to sell at greatly reduced prices, the campaign
for safety on the highway by means of improved
highway lighting, the "Better Light—Better Sight"
movement for the protection of eyesight, and the
search for methods to improve general health have
all been given strong impetus through the efforts of
the General Electric Company.

THIS MONTH, LAST MONTH, AND NEXT
The questionnaire you filled out last month showed us that the De-
cember issue was the best we had put out up to that time. In fact, each
issue was better than the preceding one. "Do You Want a Job?" and
the other employment and occupational articles were favorites. Those
interesting narratives, "All Figured Out" and "Globe Circler and Tensor
Twister," and the popular technical articles, "Building With Glass" and
"200,000 Dollars an Inch" also rated high.
In this issue "Made to Order Molecules," "Cooley Bridge," "A Thou-
sand Relays," and "No More Bacteria" depict the marvels that engineer-
ing is working in civil, electrical, chemical and mechanical lines. The
experiences of recent graduates in their first jobs are found in "Let's
Look Ahead." Some of the mystery surrounding interviews may be cleared
up in this month's "job" article, "jobs and Interviews."
Next month look for "Engineers, Salaries and Depressions," a
history of distillation, "Speeding up Metal Analysis" and others as yet
unnamed.

IT WAS a fitting tribute to Dean Mor-
timer E. Cooley when Murray D.
Van Wagoner, State Highway Commis-
sioner dedicated Michigan's newest and
most beautiful bridge in his honor. This
latest achievement of the State High-
way Department has become the center
of interest not only of Michigan engi-
neers, but also of engineers the country
over, since it was recently judged the
best example of beauty and utility in de-
sign for bridges in its price class by the
American Institute of Steel Construc-
tion.
Designed by James A. Cissel, design
engineer for the Michigan State High-
way Department at the time, and at
present professor of structural engineer-
ing at the University of Michigan, the
Cooley bridge is a product throughout
of Michigan men.
With funds made possible by W.P.A.,
construction was begun in June 1934
across the Manistee River on M-5S be-
tween Manistee and Cadillac. The cross-
ing is between the Tippy Dam and
Stronach Dam in the Manistee National
Forest, one of the scenic sports of Mich-
igan. The Cooley bridge, built with a
road level 73 feet above the river, ne-
cessitated fill-in approaches several hun-
dred feet in length. However, this added
the safety feature of a diminished grade.
The substructure of the bridge con-

sists of two reinforced concrete abut-
ments and two reinforced concrete piers.
The abutments are constructed with six
reinforced concrete columns joined to-
gether with concrete struts. The result
is a frame similar to that of a reinforced
concrete building. The advantage of
such construction in this case is that it
diminishes the pressure of the earth
upon the frame.
The concrete piers are 35 feet from
bottom to top, each extending 23 feet
below water level. Considerable difficul-
ty was encountered in driving the sheet-
steel cofferdams, in preventing water
from filling the excavations. The work
was accomplished by removing the hard
clay from below the sheeting by means
of air spades. The piers are designed
to carry the entire weight of the bridge.
An unusual feature of the Cooley
bridge, is the single-span, cantilever-
type superstructure—so unusual that
project engineer Henderson encountered
some difficulty in convincing a subordi-
nate road engineer that construction of
this type was feasible for a bridge of its
size. With a center span measuring 300
feet between the supporting piers and
anchor arm braces 125 feet in length,
the steel structure itself is 550 feet long
and 73 feet above the surface of the
river.
The Cooley bridge achieves much of
its beauty from the rugged simplicity of
the structure. With its ornamental steel
railings, reinforced concrete stairways,
and symmetrical lines of construction,
the bridge adds to the natural beauty
of its surroundings.
Contract cost for the Cooley bridge
was $179,683.88 of which $42,417.53
was allocated to the building of the sub-
structure and $137,266.35 to the con-
struction of the steel superstructure. The
total cost is far below the $250,000.00
cost which was the maximum in its price
class as designated by the American In-
stitute of Steel Construction.

ROBERT M. ELSWORTH. '38E
ANOTHER chapter was written in
the story of railroad achievement
when the New York Central completed
its construction program in Syracuse,
New York. The general program en-
tailed the elimination of twenty-three
grade crossings and the elevation of
some five miles of track, a task requir-
ing a million and a half cubic yards of
fill and 120,000 cubic yards of concrete
in retaining walls and bridges. This ele-
vation project with the entire new yard
it created, afforded the railway signal
engineer an opportunity to install the
latest equipment in signalling devices
and safety apparatus, and a completely
modern and up-to-the-minute track lay-
out.
The entire yard layout of ten
''through" tracks and several sidings is
constructed in miniature on a central
control panel whence all important
switches are operated by remote control
and by one man. The switches are actu-
ated by small levers above or below the
track diagram. Just above each lever
are two lights, one yellow and one red.
The yellow warns the operator that a
switch is out of correspondence with its
lever, while the red shows that the
switch is locked. Switches are locked
whenever a train is occupying that par-
ticular section of track, or when a sig-
nal is cleared over the route giving an
approaching train a clear track. The
switch lever is ineffective when its red
light is burning—the switch is locked
and manipulation of the lever accom-
plishes nothing. The operator is free to
move any control, but incorrect opera-
tion is prevented by the interconnec-
tions of the control circuits.
In the room below are located 1,072
relays which are the connecting links be-
tween the switiches and the control
panel. There are twelve terminal points
on each relay case, making possible six
contacts for each relay. All twelve of
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


insulated nut guards to prevent short
circuits that might move a switch or
give an oncoming train a red light. Re-
lays are connected in series with the
rails keeping the signal circuits open
when there is no train in the section. As
a train enters the section it shunts out
the relay and closes the signal circuit.
A broken rail will likewise demagnitize
the relay and flash a danger signal.
Even the mercury pool rectifiers that
supply the switch machines with DC
current are a recent development. The
outstanding feature of this new recti-
fier tube is Fernico (alloy of nickel and
iron) anode seal. Fernico has the same
expansion characteristics as glass and
permits peak currents several times
those allowed by ordinary glass seals.
After all this new equipment—the
last word in railroad signaling and safe-
ty devices—was installed, it had to be
rigorously tested. Of course, all wiring
diagrams and drawings had been checked
and rechecked before installation was
begun, and all installations were care-
fully inspected, but even this was not
enough. No possibility can be overlooked
when human lives may be endangered.
A crew of eight inspectors, working with
a motor car towing a two-ton load on a
flat car, checked
every possible con-
nection and combi-
nation. This work
took three weeks
time and entailed
checking at the con-
trol panel, in the
relay room, and at
the switches. The
test load (only two
tons) is very light
in comparison with
the loads formerly
required to operate
signals under all
conditions. The old
requirement of 90,-
000 pounds has been
reduced to 2,000
pounds. The speci-
fication of "all con-
ditions" is of neces-
sity rigid because
signals must oper-
ate when the track
is icy, rusty or dirty.
The chief obstacle
in completing the
signal circuit is presented by the poor
contact between wheels and rails. The


Railway Age
• A million and a half cubic yards of fill and 120,000 cubic yards of con-
crete eliminate twenty-three grade crossings.
poor contact can, of course, be over-
come by increasing the voltage in the
track circuit, but such procedure entails
too high a loss in leakage through the
ballast. A new use of a half wave recti-
fier that gives a high peak voltage, but
a low average voltage solved the prob-
lem. Since train loads are the same, but
the load now required to complete the
circuit is much less, a greater margin of
safety and a greater degree of certainty
in signal operation has been introduced.
Besides raising the track level 20 to
22 feet above its old bed and eliminating
all grade crossings, the New York Cen-
tral's Syracuse terminal introduces
something entirely new in train han-
dling, signaling and safety. One of the
chief advantages of the new layout is
that mechanical locking of switches has
been eliminated. Formerly after a train
left the section, a certain interval of time
had to be allowed before a switch could
be unlocked. Now changes can be made
immediately facilitating changes in line-
up and preventing train delays. Thus
are the railroads responding to the spur
of competition and to the desire for
greater safety in the transportation in-
dustry.

Nation's Business
AN INTERVIEW is almost certain
to precede the offer of a job. Very
few corporations will hire you without
having at least one of their responsible
representatives interview you. These
representatives range in importance
from specially trained personnel and
contact men to the vice-presidents of
the corporation; and include chief en-
gineers, research directors, division su-
perintendents and manufacturing heads.
The ways in which different companies
and their representatives handle an in-
terview are varied greatly. The infor-
mation they may want will run all the
way from a few highlights of your col-
lege career, and a few of your personal
likes and dislikes, to your whole life
history, background and lineage.
In spite of the diversity of their ques-
tioning, interviewers have a common
purpose—to size you up. As a member
of our faculty has said, "Companies
hire men to work with them and not for
them." So no matter how your inter-
viewer goes about his job he is trying
to determine whether you are the kind
of fellow who can work with him and
his associates, and, if so, what type and
quality of work you can do. He may
shoot questions at you to see how you
stand up under fire. He may try to find
out what kind of conversationalist you
are. He may even do most of the talk-
ing himself—show you pictures of his
company's offices and plants, describe
its products and processes, and even go
into its financial set-up. While all this
is going on he will be taking a great
many notes—some mental and others
in black and white. One firm provides
its interviewers with a sheet listing all
of the elements of your personality with
a group of descriptive adjectives that
cover all possible conditions under each.
For instance, under voice there will be
such adjectives as pleasant, harsh, rasp-
ing, loud, or weak. He merely checks or
underlines the one that fits you. As you
talk or listen he goes right down the
list noting your handshake, the way
you return his gaze, your dress, and the
impression you make as you walk in
the door.
You get the impression that your pro-
spective employer is trying to sell you
the idea of working with his company.
Quite likely he is. Of course the most
desirable set-up exists when he finds you
satisfactory, and when you want to
work with his company. But, it is wise
to remember that he is probably giving
30 or 40 men in several dozen different
colleges the same talk and wants to em-
ploy only 4 or S. He has a great many
more men to choose from than you have
jobs to choose from, so it behooves you
to make the best impression you can
even though it seems that he is trying
to sell you his company.
Through all this maze of questions
you will find a few bits of vital infor-
mation almost universally requested. As
a gauge of the quality of work you can
do you will probably be asked your
scholastic rating. Your outside activities
may indicate ability to get along with
others, leadership and initiative. You
will probably be asked what kind of
work you want to do. You may usually
choose from jobs that lead to design,
construction, operation, or research.
Though this information is essential it
may not be asked of you directly be-
cause it is all available in your personnel
record sheet. One representative, when
asked why he had not inquired into
studies, grades and activities, replied,
"We can always get that information.
At present we want you to feel free and
at ease, and to talk with us. Do you do
much dating? Had you ever heard of
our corporation and its products before?
What subjects interest you most? What
do you think of the N.R.A.? Of Roose-
velt? Do you think the competitive sys-
tem is a fair one? What gives you the
most pleasure in life?" Another inter-
viewer in a less sociable mood asked,
"Can you do problems in mechanics,
thermodynamics, calculus and electrical
engineering? Yes? Good, now we'll be
talking the same language. What kinds
of pumps are there? What is the first
law of thermodynamics? The second?
State Bernoulli's Theorem. What does
it mean? Can you give me an illustra-
tion? You're positive? Well, now look
here—how can you say that? You know
better than that don't you? Well, why
did you make such a statement before?"
One company even gave an intelligence
test.
So remember that they will interview
you before they hire you because they
want to size you up—to determine what
grade of work you do, the kind of a
chap you are and what you want to do
—because they are hiring men to work
with them and not for them.

Molecule*

SYDNEY STEINBORN. '38E
SEVERAL hundred years ago an un-
known alchemist sought to turn a
group of base metals into gold and dis-
covered bronze. Gold is powerful but
bronze is useful, and his discovery par-
tially justified the aimless psuedo-
research of antiquity's chemists. Re-
cently the discovery of bronze was par-
alleled by the development of a new
plastic as a result of research in the
field of synthetic rubber. From the
standpoint of industry and society the
new plastic is of far greater importance
than the synthetic rubber which insti-
gated the research leading to its dis-
covery.

* In these kettles the complete process of
polymerization takes place and the long molecule
results.
Chemically the new plastics are com-
posed of that familiar household anti-
septic, carbolic acid, and formaldehyde.
Combined by a secret, patented process
they are known as phenol-formaldehyde
plastics. The industry concerned with
the manufacture and fabrication of plas-
tic products, being a fairly new enter-
prise, has incorporated all the latest
developments in chemical and industrial
engineering into its various processes.
The plants producing the plastics are
teeming with men speaking about flow
sheets and inspiring awe in the listening
layman by speaking in terms of multi-
syllabic, super-chemical compounds —
polymerization, Weucyltriglycyl-Z-leucyl-
triglycy\-l-leucyloctaglycylglycin, mac-
romolecular and the long molecule. It
seems that these gentlemen throw a lot
of things into a big kettle and by skill-
ful manipulation manufacture a product
whose molecules are heavy and long and
just the right size that makes for excel-
lent processing and a million and one
uses.
Chemical engineers have two methods
of tailoring the molecule—they may
polymerize (build up) simple deriva-
tives to a higher molecular weight or
degrade natural macromolecular (multi-
molecular) compounds. The process used
is chiefly that of polymerization, pro-
ducing some 5,000,000 pounds of plas-
tics every year. As previously stated, the
latest developments are used throughout
the processing of the product. Because
of the sensitivity of the plastics to con-
tamination, nickel or silver kettles and
conveyors are used everywhere in the
plant. A German corporation once at-

• "Tailoring the Long Molecule"
Inco
tempted to use copper kettles but found
that the subsequenc product was clouded
by the effect of the copper on the chem-
icals used in that particular plastic.
The raw materials, phenol and for-
maldehyde, are delivered in nickel
linked tank-cars. The ingredients are
then pumped from the tank-car through
nickel lined pumps and are stored im-
mediately above the processing kettles
—everything being nickel and 100%
free from foreign or deleterious ele-
ments which might contaminate the
product. Caustic soda is dissolved in dis-
tilled water and the solution used as a
catalyst in the processing kettle where
the molecules are whipped into line as
to size and weight.
The polymerization process is a deli-
cate one and the engineers have
expended much effort to evolve a fool-
proof system. The control of tempera-
ture and pressure in the kettles is
entirely automatic. Autographic records
of the variances in temperature and
pressure are kept so that the engineer in
charge can readily retrace the steps and
see just where the mistake occurred if
the batch goes bad. Temperatures are
controlled within a range of 2 degrees
centigrade—if the temperature should
suddenly vary, an alarm is set off, and,
to insure consistent good batches of
product, another alarm is set off when a
batch has finished "cooking." Click—

TO YOU cool and calculating engi-
neering undergraduates who feel you
know exactly where you will be, what
you will be doing and just what sa'ary
you will be earning a couple of vears
hence, take heed! If the words of recent
graduates who at one time pTSsessed sim-
ilar beliefs are any indication, you are
due to be disillusioned. We can say this
with confidence, for the Tec:inic has
just received answers to a group of ques-
tionnaires sent to the upper portion of
a recent graduating class, and (he rev-
elations are very enlightening and
amusing. Of course, we can't tell you
exactly whom you ought to get for any
particular course, or in any other way
betray these confidznces, but we are
certain that the material we do present
will be of general interest.
WHERE YOU WILL BE
Unfortunately, our survey included
only a portion of a graduating class, but
these fellows, in true engineering fash-
ion, returned the required information
punctually. Where were they located—
Well, the Lucky Strike Sweepstakes could
not have reached more remote corners
of the country! Strangely enough, there
were relatively few left in the vicinity
of their Alma Mater. True, Detroit and
Michigan in general did claim a few, but

• There arc more than a few who insist that they find it essential to study more than when
in college.
these were comparatively small in num-
ber. Many letters were postmarked in
California, and some in Texas; neigh-
boring Mid-West states absorbed a few
graduates, but N.Y. State and other in-
dustrial eastern states accounted for the
majority. One B.M.O.C. from a few
years back calls his Tennessee location
"the last outpost of civilization." We
were inclined to be sympathetic until
others wrote in and bid for the same
distinction. A certain would-be monopo-
list writes of his section: "This town and
valley are the dirtiest I have ever seen
The soot hitting against car windows
sounds like rain." These facts natural-
ly cannot present a complete picture.
However, they do illustrate the point
that many students find themselves in
locations which, in all probability, they
would not have chosen had they con-
sidered all the pertinent factors thor-
oughly at the time.
WHAT TO TAKE
Everyone, it seemed, had a pet peeve,
but none was more vehement or more
unanimous than that against specializa-
tion. Quite frequently graduates told of
how they had passed up desired courses
to specialize more completely, and then
found themselves working in some en-
tirely different field. Cases were also re-
called where groups of student engineers
from different schools had found them-
selves in the same predicament. Invari-
ably, they had suffered for lack of a
good general foundation. Employers, it
seems, rather insist that their recruits
take general courses, for they feel that
there is not much possibility that
they will acquire this broad background
once they start their specialized tasks.
In some cases, we were told, knowledge
gained in numerous elective courses
helped students take advantage of op-
portunities to prove themselves out-
standing. Since most engineers do a
great deal of drafting during the early
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


that these courses be taken more seri-
ously. Also, a good number wished they
had taken Machine Shop or Foundry.
When one considers how elementary a
part these subjects play in all engineer-
ing processes, their usefulness cannot be
doubted.
WHAT YOU WILL DO
It is particularly interesting to notice
how embryo engineers break into pro-
fessional life. Many, of course, go di-
rectly into laboratories, actual design,
or possibly production, but the great
majority find themselves starting on
training courses. Thus, for one more
year, and in some cases two years, they
are students all over again. Training
courses usually vary in method and sub-
stance but their purpose is alike in all
cases—and that is to acquaint the new
man with every phase of the business.
From Milwaukee a lonely young
Michigan alumnus writes: "There are
five of us taking this course, all from
different schools. We are designated as
Special Apprentices, just to make us
feel good. The course consists in giving
us training, for a period of eight weeks,
in all of the departments of the plant.
We have a meeting at least once a week,
at which we are called on to give an hour
talk, hear officials of the plant talk, see
motion pictures of our product, and vis-
it other plants. After finishing a depart-
ment, we are required to write a report
on our work in that department. T first
began working on the Erecting Floor.
Boy it was hot! I filed burs for shafts,
gears, and splines, along with scraping
bearings. After a few weeks I went to
work on one of the machines, installing
machine units and aligning them. ..."
Another similar experience comes
from one who describes himself as being
with an old blower company that is real-
ly booming with "this air-conditioning
business." He says: "They have about
ten men in their student department
from almost as many schools and a good
share of them with two degrees. Thev
put us all through their engineering and
research departments and give us a good
course in air-conditioning as well. T am
working in the sales department right
now on cost estimates and price quo-
tations on sDecial jobs. All their sales-
men and men connected with the de-
partment are engineering graduates."
From the General Electric at Sche-
nectady one enterprising young man re-
lates: "They immediately slapped me

• "Many engineers go directly into laboratories, actual design, or production."
Electrical Engineering
on turbine testing and about two days
of that made me hide my Tau Beta Pi
key and sheepskin and try to make
everyone think I was just a high school
graduate. I can almost say that Eve
learned more during this past month
than I had in four years of college. One
day Em an engineer, the next day a pipe
fitter, computer, welder and about half
the time a janitor!"
One graduate was surprised to find
the large number of poor engineers that
had been graduated from various tech-
nical schools. These "pseudo" engineers,
he said, are earning $75 to $100 per
month, and will never earn more. They
have reached their level.
These observations, however, were
relatively few and were sharply con-
trasted by stories of success. These lat-
ter men had apparently such an inter-
est in their work that promotions fol-
lowed continually. For example, one
fellow enthusiastically wrote: "Eve been
assigned the title of Production Plan-
ning Engineer. Last fall we started a
five million dollar expansion program
which will end with the completion of a
million dollar power plant—I have had
a wonderful opportunity to study all
phases of engineering in this job and
have had considerable business experi-
ence in my connections with the pur-
chasing and traffic departments. My
one big job is to schedule all activities
in an effort to get material and equip-
ment ordered and delivered in the proper
sequence and at the right time while
I make up building schedules for the
Construction Department. Since the
construction business is over, I am ex-
panding my activities to cover mainte-
nance and more of our regular produc-
tion." Cases of this sort prove conclu-
sively the logic in one executive's formu-
la for success:—"Make your vocation
your avocation."
RECREATION AND LIVING
ACCOMMODATIONS
From sections of the country where
small towns and mountains predom-
inate, many tell of the accommoda-
tions for skiing and skating, and their
enjoyable trips to nearby scenic spots.
As a sharp contrast to small town situ-
ations, fellows in large towns invariably
complain about high living costs and
the amount of time required for travel.
And now to be more specific as to how
they live, we've found cases where as
many as thirteen lived together, and if
we are to take their word for it, they
were certainly getting the most out of
life. Contrarily, graduates who were
working alone spent a good share of
the time wishing that they had a few
more fellows around. Finally, not to dis-
tort the picture, there are more than a
few who insist that they find it essen-
tial to study more than when in college.

* Ann Arbor's new sewage disposal plant is capable of freeing 95% dissolved organic mattei
and 95-98% of all bacteria.
A/o Mote Sactetla
by
WILLIAM S. TAYLOR. '39E
WE soon are to see the day when
the Huron River will be trans-
formed from an oversize gulley of slug-
gish filth and despicable odors to a
sparkling stream to delight the fisher
and picnicker. With Ann Arbor's new
sewage disposal plant, it is estimated
that a marked improvement will be ap-
parent in the Huron River and Geddes
Pond by next summer; in several years,
the main stream will be remarkably
clearer: as the supply of oxygen in the
water is replenished, fish life will return
and the cheerful chirping of frogs again
will fill the air.
The idea of a new sewage disposal
system was initiated ten years ago,
when, in 1916, investigations of the Hu-
ron River between Ann Arbor and Ypsi-
lanti disclosed a highly contaminated
flow of water into Geddes Pond, which
was acting as a natural settling tank
for sewage sludge—a disturbing men-
ace to progressive development of the
surrounding community.
The new $456,000 sewage disposal
plant ($124,000 contributed by the Fed-
eral Government as PWA etc.) is cap-
able of producing an effluent (the dis-
charged liquid) possessing the sparkling
clearness of drinking water and actu-
ally freed of 95% dissolved organic
matter and 9596-989c of all bacteria.
The plant is designed to purify effec-
tively an average flow of 4^4 mil-
lion gallons per day (m.g.d.) and a
maximum flow up to 9 m.g.d. for a
total population of 48,000 people.
Upon reaching the treatment plant,
the flow of sewage is directed through
a comminutor, or screenings-grinder,
consisting of a rotating, slotted, cylin-
drical screen where the solids are ground
to small particles which eventually are
removed in the settling tanks. Enroute
to the settlers, the sewage is pre-aerated
as a means of separating and floating to
the surface oil and grease to be removed
by a skimming mechanism during the
settling operation and finally burned in
an incinerator.
Two primary settling tanks with a
combined capacity of 178,000 gallons
provide a nominal detention period of
one hour under normal flow conditions.
Sludge scrapers periodically remove the
settled sludge from the tanks, and it is
then pumped to sludge digestion tanks
for final treatment.
From the primary settlers the sewage
is mixed with 25% activated sludge
which is obtained from the final puri-
fication operations and which contains
an abundance of oxidizing bacteria. It
coagulates, or primes, the raw sewage
somewhat as yeast primes dough in the
bakery. The raw sewage with its acti-
vated sludge travels to the 1,420,000
gallon aeration tanks (four 355,000 gal-
lon tanks) where a vital step towards
final purification is accomplished by the
familiar phenomena of exposure to air.
The bottoms of the tanks are equipped
with diffuser plates allowing air to
bubble up through the liquor, thus pro-
viding a medium for the oxidizing bac-
teria. A nominal detention period of 6
hours is provided for the average sewage
flow through these tanks.
Final steps in the purification process
come as the mixed liquor flows continu-
ously from the aeration to the final
settling tanks. Here the activating
sludge settles to the bottom in about
V/i hours carrying with it practically all
of the suspended solids in the raw liquor.
The sediment from these tanks is col-
lected by scraper and pumped in part to
the aeration tanks for re-circulation and
the excess amount to sludge digestion
tanks. The purified effluent from these
tanks is discharged as a clear liquid into
the Huron River.
In the sludge digestion tanks the sed-
iment from the settlers is reduced from
a watery mush to a stiff, dark bullion.
These digesters are heated, have a ca-
pacity of 144,000 cubic feet, and are
equipped with air-tight floating steel
covers to allow for storage of up to
30,000 cubic feet of gas produced by an-
aerobic bacteria in reducing the organic
matter to gas. The gas collected in the
digesters has a heating value V/i times
as great as that of ordinary commercial
illuminating gas and is consumed en-
tirely within the disposal plant in oper-
ating gas engines, incinerating skim-
mings, and heating digesters. The re-
maining humus-like material is filtered,
caked and sold to land owners as a
cheap grade fertilizer.
In five years' time, it is estimated, the
last trace of sludge along the river bank
will be decomposed, fish-life will be re-
stored completely, and all trace of an-
noying odors will have disappeared.
Already, propositions have been made
for developments of park areas along
the reinstated river, and it is possible
that Argo Pond will, in the future, find
itself in competition with Geddes Pond
as the canoeists' pleasure garden.

CONDMICS
COUNTINC ALL THE COSTS
'I 'HE newspapers of the middlewest,
*• eager to satisfy the desires of their
public, have given much space to the
oft-proposed St. Lawrence Waterway.
The idea is a romantic one to middle-
western groups situated a thousand
miles from salt-water. Quoting Waldon,
Webb, We Explore the Great Lakes:
"There is, indeed, more than immediate
economic need behind the Middle West-
erner's belief in the St. Lawrence Water-
way. There is ambition. Our eternal
American ambition to become greater
than we are; the ambition of Duluth to
grow as big as Milwaukee, of Milwau-
kee to outstrip Detroit, of Detroit to
become a second Chicago—by some
magic of water transport, of freedom
to the markets of the world. There is
pride. The Great Lakes city wants to
be able to say: 'We take no second place
to New York. We too are a seaport
town.' And there is the fascination of
the sea itself, the pathway to the ends
of the earth. The Middle Westerner
has a vision of the flags of Cuba and
Holland and England and the Argen-
tine and Japan coming over his horizon,
and of being able to go down to the
dock and smell the smells of the Ori-
ent." This is the essence of the pro-
waterway arguments—they simply like
the idea. Certainly, particular groups
will be benefited by a Great Lakes-to-
the-sea project—but the science of ec-
onomics plays no favorites. For the pro-
posed seaway to be considered econom-
ically feasible it must create a larger
net income to society than present meth-
ods of transportation and power pro-
duction are creating. To offer the reader
some facts in the light of the project's
economic feasibility is the aim of this
department.
Considering the seaway in the light
of net real income to society: if reve-
nues from power production and reduc-
tion of transportation rates are such
that when all costs have been included,
the project performs a service to so-
ciety at lower costs than previous meth-
ods, then the plan should be pushed
forward to speedy completion. If, on the
other hand, only certain groups are to
be benefited, and they at the expense of
other groups, and the net real income to
society is to be less than under the first
arrangement, the project had better be
permanently shelved.
The St. Lawrence Waterway system
can be divided into two parts: naviga-
tion and power. In the rational light of
cost-inclusive economics, each must
stand on its own feet and produce a
revenue in excess of the costs of produc-
tion. Considering the navigation aspect:
at present there are three routes by
which a midwest product reaches a
foreign port: via railroads to the Pacific,
via the Canadian National to the shores
of Hudson Bay and thence by boat to
Europe, and via Lake steamers and east-
ern railroads to the Atlantic. Present
through traffic to Europe on the Great
Lakes is negligible. For the project to
be for good of the world it must more
than compensate the losses to society
resulting from the partial abandonment
of existing transportation capital.
From the Brookings Institute report
on the St. Lawrence Waterway (where
much of the material herein presented
was obtained) we learn that the pro-
posed seaway will be in a position to
move 10,000,000 tons of freight a year
of which close to 70% is grain. How-
ever, this figure represents the poten-
tial traffic, the question remains as to
whether or not the potential traffic will
seek the St. Lawrence route to Europe.
Canada, whose freight comprises slight-
ly less than one-half the total available
traffic for the project, has two alterna-
tive lines to her foreign consumers. First
there is the westward movement to the
Pacific, and, secondly, there is the Hud-
son Bay route. These two routes are
available to the exclusion of present
method of shipping products and pres-
ent methods are more than adequate to
serve Canada's needs. In this regard, we
offer several points from a report of the
Canadian National Advisory Commit-
tee:
1. Canada's rail transportation facili-
ties are far in excess of her needs.
2. Railroad rates are generally lower
in Canada than they are in the United
States making the route unnecessary as
a means of obtaining competitive rates
from the roads.

the most part State-owned it is apparent
that the Canadian point of view is quite
different than that in the United States.
Can we, then count on Canada's
5,000,000 tons of freight to seek the
seaway? The answer is that the traffic
will seek the cheapest route and the
forced obsolescence of millions of dol-
lars of transportation capital is not the
Canadian idea of economy.
Granting that the American midwest
can use the seaway advantageously, let
us recall that farmers have for long
rallied to the banner of the high tariff.
We learned in economics that high
tariffs are not conducive to interna-
tional trade. Does the midwest propo-
nent of high tariffs wish to spend close
to a billion dollars to create a traffic
medium for a trade which he stifles by
prohibitive tariffs? Apparently, but no
one can deny the irrationality of such
a stand.
Another consideration is the depth
of the proposed channel. Engineers
have suggested the depth of the Wel-
land Canal, 27 feet. This depth would
exclude t&gt;2'/&lt; of the tonnage and 85%
of the faster cargo vessels now entering
American coastal ports. Where then,
would be the foreign flags at Chicago's
docks?
Costs are ever to be considered. Engi-
neers estimate the seaway to run up to
614,000,000 dollars. Overhead costs per
year on this aggregate of capital would
amount to $40,000,000. This amount
is to be paid by taxes; in short, Ameri-
can taxpayers will be subsidizing ship-
pers to the extent of $3.50 per ton of
freight moved. Existing freight rates
on wheat between Duluth and Montreal
average 9 cents a bushel, reduction in
rates effected by allowing ocean bot-
toms to enter the Great Lakes would
average 4 cents per bushel, but this re-
duction is subsequent to a contribu-
tion of 11 cents per bushel on the part
of American taxpayer. Counting all the
costs one is better off to continue using
extant transportation facilities.
To the American observer, the power
aspect of the St. Lawrence project is of
lesser consequence than the navigation
end. Suffice to say that 80'.v of poten-
tial power will go to Canada and that
the Canadian national policy is against
any exportation of electric power, being
desirous of fostering home industry.
American power resulting from the har-
nessing of St. Lawrence water will give
an income of 8,440,000 dollars a year,
but the production of that income will
cost 9,750,000 dollars every year leav-
ing a deficit of 1,310,000 per year—
obviously net real income to society will
lessen under St. Lawrence power. In
summation, it is apparent that counting
all the costs makes the St. Lawrence
Seaway a better dream than a route to
Europe.

COMMENTARIES
LAST month's commentaries cited the
i case of a young graduate who de-
cided to remain with a large company,
rather than accept a call to a small firm.
All this nicely raises the question (ever-
present with most seniors)—Which is
better, the large company, or the small?
Since it is a fact that most seniors can
readily name several large companies
they would willingly work for, but can-
not name at least as many small ones
they might consider favorably, it fol-
lows that for the typical senior, the
question is highly academic.
Shifting attention from company to
candidate for a moment, take a look at
a certain type of senior. He is about
22 or 23 years old. Some 16 years ago,
at age six, a mysterious thing happened:
the public schools absorbed him. For
eight of his young, formative years, most
of his activities were nicely laid out for
him. There followed a four-year stretch
in high school, where again things were
vary well organized. There were some
choices to make, but by following natu-
ral inclinations, he found a satisfying
curriculum. It brought him to college.
Another four-year stretch: some few
choices to make, but his work, in the
main, was organized for him. And now
he is a senior.
But suppose it had been quite differ-
ent. Wipe out all these school systems,
which lead a youngster so easily from
one thing to another. Substitute plenty
of equivalent opportunities for educa-
tion, but require the boy to seek advice
and decide for himself, all the way
through those sixteen years, where he
should spend each semester, and how.
Also, give him entire freedom as to
whether he should have any of it. How
likely is it that he would now be the
same kind of a senior that he really is—
or even that he would be a senior at
all?
The point is that compulsory educa-
tion in itself, lays out the general plan
by which a boy shall spend his working
time. Eight years of it is enough to be-
gin to set the boy in the habit of ex-
pecting to find many of his endeavors
planned for him. High school and col-
lege, in many cases, do little to change
the attitude. Is it at all strange that too
many seniors are distinctly unready to
face a world that suddenly stops taking
care of their major decisions?
Such a senior—if he has not in some
way taken antidotal remedies along the
way—is a babe in the industrial woods.
He has heard of few, if any small com-
panies. National advertising, plus con-
versation, have managed to tell him
there are some large companies with
recruiting and training programs. Hence,
his entire practical outlook is likely to
be confined to a hope that the recruiter
for some large company will sign him
up this spring. It will probably be a
piece of bad luck if that happens; for
unless he swiftly learns that wide inter-
ests, a desire for responsibility, and a
willingness to make decisions are prac-

OCCASIONALLY a telephone wire must be run under a rug or carpet. The twisted
wire formerly used made an unsightly ridge.
So Western Electric—manufacturing, distributing and purchasing unit of the Bell
System—produces a flat cord only one-eighth inch thick, seven-eighths of an inch
wide. (Like this ^111^ ) Within this tiny space arc four
conductors of insulated wire. Under the rug or carpet this cord
is not seen, not even felt with bare feet.
Even to the smallest detail, the Bell System is constantly on the
lookout for the better way to make telephone service more satis-
factory to the customer.

more bad ones. One has to discriminate.
Discrimination must be based on knowl-
edge. How can seniors learn about small
companies? The employment service of
a college—unless it is very extensive and
probably more expensive than is justi-
fied by results—cannot keep track of
the multitudes of small companies. It
is largely up to the senior to inform him-
self. He can begin by studying trade
journals, where he can spot the smaller
firms that are sizable enough to adver-
tise at least once in a while. He inevi-
tably finds some of more interest than
others. He follows by vacation visits if
he can. He can write letters. He can
look up financial ratings. And (this is
frequently very important) he can con-
centrate on a few by everlastingly in-
quiiing among older friends in business
and industry, about these smaller out-
fits. Such conversations often reveal that
Company A is a price-cutter and a low-
pay outfit. B means well, but has been
asleep for a decade. C is really a closely
owned and controlled feeder for a large
corporation which is notably hard-
boiled, intractable, and probably riding
for a fall some day. D has had an in-
different history, but recent changes in
management and policies predict a very
good future. E is conservative, has al-
ways made money, looks as if it will
keep on doing it. F has been lagging;
needed young, new blood for a long
time, but avoided the transfusion; is
now at last seeking some youngsters,
who will really have a ground-floor op-
portunity to make a showing. And so
it goes.
It seems the smaller companies are
due for a new and long-term lease on
life. Electric power is widely available.
Highway transport, along with the re-
cent speeding up of freight and express
deliveries, permit efficient movement of
goods through huge- areas that were
hitherto inaccessible. Along with the
spread of electricity and the highway,
go living advantages. For the first time,
a worker can move out of the city with-
out sacrificing comforts, the lack of
which used to make the isolated home
unbearable to many people. Thus a
small industry can spring up in a small
town, yet count on having its labor sup-
ply grow with it. All in all, it is quite
possible that a majority of industrially-
employed engineers of the future may be
found in the smaller concerns.

T.V.A. Trip
The A.S.C.E. is planning a trip to
the T.V.A. area during Spring Vacation.
While the plans are still tentative, there
was much support of the idea of re-
establishing the spring recess trips which
were so popular a half-dozen years ago.
The trip if successfully consumated
would be by auto and expenses would
be shared by about five to a car. Inas-
much as at least 25 students would have
to go to assure a good inspection trip,
John Poriss, chairman of the trip com-
mittee is seeking any other engineers
who might be interested in making the
trip south.
And the Slide Rule Dance
Students in the Engineering College
not as yet acquainted with be-all and
end-all of the technical social season
will listen with an attentive ear to ru-
mors concerning the annual Slide Rule
Dance. It will be early in April as is the
tradition and we have it from unreliable
sources that even freshmen will be able
to get dates providing they yell "SLIDE
RULE" and whisper '"40." More about
this in the next Tf.chnic.
NEW PROFESSOR
Prof. Jesse Ormondroyd has joined
the staff of the department of Engineer-
ing Mechanics to continue the work of
Prof. Timoshenko. His work will cover
the field of guiding upperclassmen and
graduates in advanced work in vibra-
tional mechanics, design, and advanced
dynamics. For the past sixteen years
Mr. Ormondroyd has been associated
with the Westinghouse Company where
he has made an enviable record for him-
self. Since 1930 he has been in charge
of the department of new developments
and the experiments division at their
Philadelphia plant. More recently, he
has been in charge, for the Westinghouse
Company, of the installation of all the
equipment for the mounting of the new
two-hundred inch telescope at Pasadena,
California. It was in order to complete
the last mentioned work that Mr. Or-
mondroyd delayed the beginning of his
work here at Michigan until the second
semester of the school year. He has been
a teacher in the Westinghouse Technical
Schools and has also taught special
courses at Harvard's School of Engi-
neering.
Mr. Ormondroyd is a graduate of the
University of Pennsylvania, a member
of Lambda Chi Alpha, the Franklin In-
stitute, the Gesellschaft fur Augenandte
Mathematik und Mechanick, and the
Applied Mechanics division of the
American Society of Mechanical Engi-
neering.

E. E. RESEARCH
Adding to the facilities of the E.E.
Department is the remodeled dynamo
lab annex at the Southeast corner of
the lab.
Contained in the three new rooms is
complete equipment for vacuum tube
research, including apparatus for pro-
ducing vacua and facilitating injection
of inert gases into evacuated chambers.
And the revamped radio transmitter
(emitting "'phone signals" now) used
by the E.E. Department and the
R.O.T.C. for their call W8AXZ has
been installed permanently in the new
location.

Fire in the Annex

of the West Engineering Annex immedi-
ately before Ann Arbor's Noisiest and
Speediest clanged up the driveway and
began spraying water and breaking glass
in the R.O.T.C. room on the second
floor. The causes are unknown to this
writer and to the mystified professor
trying to collect his badly singed and
completely soaked class records. The
fire brings to ear again the story that
the Annex is to be torn down and the
West Engineering Building extended in
its place.

Through the years, engineering staffs
have strained every effort to add speed,
power, acceleration and greater econ-
omy to the automobile.
And, with these advances came the need
for a better gasoline—a fuel to match
these marvelous power plants.
The answer was found in the perfection
of Ethyl Gasoline. But with this success
came still another problem—the neces-
sity for an unfailing supply of bromine,
one of the vital ingredients in the making
of this super fuel.
Every chemist has known that the ocean
contained an inexhaustible supply of
this valuable element. But how to extract
it! That was the question that had baffled
the best brains in chemical engineering.
No one had succeeded in garnering the
lone sixty-seven parts of bromine present
in every million parts of sea water.
But the demand for modern motor fuel
gave fresh impetus to finding a solution
to the problem.
It remained for the technical staff of
Dow, deeply versed in the handling of
natural brines from which hundreds of
Dow products are derived, to succeed
where all others had failed.
In a single year, Dow carried primary
research to a finished, functioning plant
that stands as one of the notable chemical
engineering achievements of our age.
Today, the Ethyl-Dow plant on the North
Carolina coast, is producing from the sea
a steady dependable source of ethylene
dibromide—an important ingredient in
the Ethyl gasoline that enables today's
motor cars to out-perform all their pre-
decessors.

PROFESSION
BEWARE OF THAT FIRST
IMPRESSION
"An American chemical engineer
might well get the first impression that
the old U.S.A. is at the head of the pro-
cession and that we would have little
to learn from chemical engineers of
other countries. It is true, I believe, that
we did do the pioneer work in coordi-
nating and formulating the separate
fields of interest that go to make up
what is now rather generally recognized
as the chemical engineering profession.
But, it is also true that in many of these
separate fields of interest, other coun-
tries had long before established their
leadership. Germany, for example, had
a highly developed technique for coordi-
nating research with plant operation.
England had advanced heavy chemical
manufacture to a most efficient basis
without the practice of chemical engi-
neering as we know it today. France had
achieved expertness in distillation and
related processes and equipment long
before these were recognized as the basis
of a unit operation in chemical engi-
neering."
—S. D. Kirkpatrick, Chem &amp; Met.
PROFESSIONAL ETHICS
Despite two unfavorable reports by
army engineers on the Florida Ship
Canal, another board of engineers was
recently appointed to make a further
report on the project. The first report
disclosed that the canal would never
pay for itself, due to the necessity of
charging a low toll to attract ocean ves-
sels. This excluded the project from be-
ing financed by the W.P.A. President
Roosevelt however, allocated $5,000,-
000 of relief funds to start the work.
Congress has since balked at appropri-
ating more money for the canal.
The latest board has concluded that
the canal is justifiable in the "public in-
terest." The report did not include an
explanation of exactly what constitutes
"public interest.'' In any case, "the pub-
lic interest" and "economic justification"
are not synonymous. The new board has
estimated that the canal will cost, ex-
clusive of land, in the neighborhood of
$163,000,000.
The last report must be passed upon
by the board of engineers for rivers and
harbors, a permanent board, which
passes on all such projects before their
presentation to Congress. It is to be
hoped that some of the older engineers
on the board will stand firm and submit
a report of "no economic justification."
Such a report would be heartening to
those who have hopes of elevating the
code of ethics of the engineering profes-
sion.
■
AUTOMOTIVE TRENDS
In spite of recent labor disputes in
industries supplying the automobile pro-
ducers with essential parts, a new high
in production for December was reached.
Ford, General Motors and Chrysler,
accounted for more units in December
than the entire industry produced in
December of last year when the total
output was 418,317 cars and trucks.
Further evidence of the increasing
prosperity in the automotive industry,
was the completion of the millionth
Chrysler unit on December 15. It was
the first time in the company's history
that the million mark was passed in the
space of one year. This is more than
twice the number of passenger cars and
trucks built by Chrysler in 1929.
W. S. Knudsen, GM executive vice-
president, points out that the workers
in the industry have not been forgotten
in the rush of this new prosperity. At a
recent meeting of the Industrial Execu-
tives Club he said: "Workers in the
automotive industry will average $340
per year more in their pay envelopes
than the workers of any other industry.
. . . The income per worker will be
higher than during any previous year
in history."

SPOTLIGHT

OLYMPIAN
THE star breast-stroker of the var-
sity swimming team—Jack H. Kas-
ley—needs no introduction to the stu-
dents of the engineering college. His
feats of aquatic prowess are known to
everyone who keeps up with the world
of sports. The world records in the
breast stroke held by Jack compose an
imposing list. At present he holds the
world's records in the 50 yard, 100
yard, 220 yard, 100 meter, and 220
meter events. In 1935 and 1936 Kasley
was also the Western conference and na-
tional intercollegiate individual cham-
pion in the breast
stroke swim.
Jack Kasley s
active participa-
tion in competi-
tive swimming
began when he
was a student in
high school in
Oak Park, Illi-
nois. He was the
mainstay of the
high school's
swimming team for three years and was
honored by being elected captain. He
has more than duplicated this feat at
the University of Michigan where he
has been one of the outstanding stars
on a team which has won one western
conference and two national intercollegi-
ate championships in the last two years.
At present, Jack is co-captain, of the
varsity swimming team.
Jack has had the opportunity to do
a surprising amount of traveling as a
member of the University swimming
team. One of the highlights of these
numerous trips was a tour of Japan in
the summer of 1935, as a member of an
all-star American team. Jack was great-
ly surprised on arriving in Japan to find
that it had taken sixteen days to get
there—that many Japanese still wear
komonas for street wear—that Tokio
is a modern city built to conform with
the very latest in engineering knowledge
—that Japanese taxi drivers are the
world's fastest and most reckless—and
that most of the cars in operation are
lack Kasley
Plymouths and Chevrolets. A success-
ful swimming campaign, combined with
the pleasant experience of being cordial-
ly received by the Japanese people,
made this trip a well-earned reward for
the hard-swimming American stars.
Kasley was also a member of the U.S.
Olympic team which campaigned in
Germany last summer.
Kasley is an independent and has
worked every semester since he enrolled
at the University of Michigan. The
campus honor societies were quick to
claim him, and he is now a member of
Triangles Yulcans and Michigamua.
LEADER
ONLY one of the many men in an
engineering class can be elected
president. The engineering class of '37
chose Gustav T. Collatz for this singu-
lar honor. Collatz is a true representa-
tive of the best the University has to
offer, for he com-
bines scholarship
with active par-
ticipation in
school activities.
After two years'
membership in
the A.I.Ch.E., he
was elected pres-
ident of the or-
ganization and he
holds that office
for the current
year. Collatz is also a member of the
Engineering Council, Vulcans, Michi-
gamua, and president of Tau Beta Pi.
A college career was not predeter-
mined for Gus but came as a result of
natural intellectual curiosity combined
with the advice and encouragement of
friends. After graduating from Hyde
Park High School, in Chicago, Illinois,
Gus enrolled at Armour Tech. A year
later he accepted a job with General
Mills which he held for two years. Fol-
lowing this experience Collatz enrolled
at the University of Michigan.
Gus is especially fond of the water
and water sports. His attraction to the
water was largely influenced by a trip
to Germany with his parents when he

Cus Collatz
was twelve years old. His temporary
residence in Germany was located near
Hamburg which gave him an oppor-
tunity to view the activities of one of
the largest shipping ports in the world.
This trip is one of Gus's fondest memo-
ries.
Collatz will receive his B.S.E. degree
in Chemical Engineering in August. His
particular interest in Engineering lies
in sales work and we feel that few en-
gineers have left this college with better
equipment for success.
WEEK-ENDER
THERE is a species which is some-
times seen on the campus of this
University, known as the homo-sapiens-
week-ender. This is a migratory animal
whose normal habitat five days in the
week is Ann Arbor, Michigan, but on
the other two
days of the week
it wanders to
other parts. One
of the most not-
able examples of
this species which
has been seen
around theseparts
for the last few
years is common-
Chuck Holkins ly known as the
Charles E. Hol-
kins. So swift is its flight from the cam-
pus on Friday evenings, that it is im-
possible to follow it. However, it has
been reliably reported, seen wandering
in and around East Lansing, Michigan,
in the company of one of the female of
the species.
Born in Leslie, Michigan, Chuck now
makes his home in Howell, Michigan.
When he arrived in Michigan as a
freshman, he immediately started to
make a name for himself in the depart-
ment of Chemical Engineering. His high
scholastic rating early earned him a
place in Phi Eta Sigma, the freshman
honor society. As a Junior he received
his Tau Beta Pi bent, and was elected
to Vulcans. A member of the Engineer-
ing Honor Council, he acted as chair-
man of that organization for one year.
Socially, he is a member of Theta Xi.
Chuck is the type that we feel is as
sure to succeed as well in later life as
he has succeeded here at Michigan. He
expects to start his career next fall, at
the Wilmington plant of the Du Pont
de Nemours Company in an engineer-
ing capacity. Here's luck to you!

OKONITE insulation with an unsurpassed record
since 1878 is still generally recognized as the
acme of perfection for rubber insulations and as
"the best product possible" of its type.
The Okonite Company and its affiliates, how-
ever, have constantly kept step with the ad-
vances of the electric art.
Whether the wire or cable is large or small,
single or multiple conductor, high or low volt-
age, whether finished with a rubber or a syn-
thetic compound jacket, braid, lead sheath or
armor of any type, Okonite can make it.
In all cases, whether the correct solution calls
for rubber, impregnated paper, varnished cam-
bric, asbestos, glass or the newer synthetic
compounds, the policy still is and will continue
to be the best product possible.

click—click—no chances are taken, the
process runs smooth, and bad batches
are few and far between.
This whole process takes place at
temperatures which seldom exceed 100
deg. C, making it possible to employ
many dyes which would decompose at
higher temperatures. The undyed plas-
tic, upon being poured from the kettle,
resembles a high-grade honey. Aniline
dyes are used for the most part and are
introduced at the beginning of the
processing resulting in solid coloring
throughout the product. Many beauti-
ful combinations are achieved by the
use of modern pastel shades.
From the kettle, the molten plastic is
cast on edge between glass plates and
annealed to an extent dependent on the
nature of the molecular structure and
intended use of the product to be fabri-
cated. The plates, after annealing, are
cut into convenient sizes and then this
handy plastic can be turned, drilled,
filed, milled, tapped, engraved, and pol-
ished to a high and durable lustre. Any
new item or use for the plastic can be
had on short notice, because molds, pat-
terns, and colors are easily and eco-
nomically changed.
Since its practical conception less
than a decade ago, this plastic has found
its way into the life of nearly every per-
son in America. Seven out of every ten
women wear jewelery of material that
was once carbolic acid. Three out of
ten automobiles employ plastics in some
manner. The slick looking radio set is
incased in many a long molecule. Ameri-
ca is plastered with plastics, with a bil-
lion, trillion macromolecular long mole-
cules that open a million doors and per-
form a multitude of tasks 24 hours a
day.
NEW YORK'S SILICOSIS LAWS
Numerous recent deaths from the in-
haling of silica dust by rock workers has
aroused the New York State legislature
to pass an occupational disease compen-
sation act, which includes silicosis as an
occupational disease. The act also re-
quires the use of dust control apparatus
on all rock work in New York State.
This act was passed last spring and has
been in effect since September 1.
A committee of contractors, mine op-
erators, insurance representatives, medi-
cal and health officials and dust control
device manufacturers have been at work
since July in compiling a workable code
which will be satisfactory to all con-
cerned. This code, now completed, and
waiting the approval of the New York
State Industrial Board, defines safe
limits of dust concentration, outlines
standard procedure for testing dust
control apparatus, and lists other
miscellaneous rules and regulations.
In the meantime testing of available
dust control apparatus has been started
on a hard granite formation on state
property in Rockland County. No dust
control apparatus can be put into opera-
tion without the approval of the state.
Enforcement of the law is postponed
pending the approval of control meth-
ods and apparatus by the industrial
board. — Condensed from Eng. News

carries on an extensive program in soil research. Being
operated jointly by the Michigan State Highway Department
and the University, it offers the opportunity for study and
research on soil problems in highway construction with
results which are immediately put into practice throughout
the State. This cooperative program combines laboratory
and field, theory and practice, in a manner not frequently
available to students or teachers.
The college has developed a soil mechanics laboratory
which has taken a prominent part in the development of
this modern science. In conjunction with the State High-

LIGHTNING STRIKES TWICE
IIGHTNING may strike not only twice but a
j dozen times in the same place over the same
path within one second's time. This is one of the
unusual facts that Karl B. McEachron, Research
Engineer of General Electric's High-voltage Labor-
atory, has found out about lightning.
Even more unusual is the new theory that the
brilliant lightning flash one observes during a storm
is not a bolt from the sky, but a union of a cloud
streamer with a similar one from the earth. The
action of the air currents and of the falling drops
of water separates the charges in the cloud. When
the voltage in the cloud reaches a certain value,
a streamer starts toward the earth, traveling in
jumps at about one-tenth the speed of light. When
this streamer is a few hundred feet away, streamers
from four to eight feet long begin to form on the
surface of the earth. When the streamer from the
clouds unites with one from the earth, the flash of
lightning occurs. The pressure generated during the
passage of current makes the thunder.
General Electric conducts research in lightning so
that its engineers can design transmission lines and
protective equipment which will insure better con-
tinuity of service.

UNIVERSITY CLUB
DAVE PACKARDof Stanford and Otto Schwartz
of Columbia played against each other in the
Rose Bowl game of 1934, but now they are working
side by side in the Schenectady Works of the Gen-

it is pointed out that in the General Electric organi-
zation is one of the largest and most cosmopolitan
university clubs in the world. Approximately 4500
college graduates, representing 237 American univer-
sities, colleges, and technical schools, are employed

DETECTING LIES
PlAPA WASHINGTON needed no lie detector;
George told the truth. But as a check on less
truthful persons. Northwestern University's crime-
detection laboratory has developed a lie detector.
It makes simultaneous measurements of respiration,
blood pressure, and perspiration. Emotional dis-
turbances are reflected in these body functions. And
since extremely sensitive recording instruments are
needed to record changes in perspiration, the delicate
photoelectric recorder developed by General Elec-
tric engineers is put to work.
For many years General Electric has made instru-
ments for exacting applications. This same photo-
electric recorder is used to obtain a continuous record
of temperature in a wire-enameling oven. Electric
gauging of ball-bearing diameters, of wire diameters,
and of strip thickness is accomplished in rolling mills.
These operations and hundreds of others are recorded
by this instrument, and with a power consumption
of only one thousandth of a microwatt.

ttet.. Lcauie ITS WELDED
Welding eliminates overlapping joints in
the modern tank car. This materially re-
duces dead weight and makes the car easier
to clean and maintain. It completely pre-
vents loss or contamination of the contents
from rusted joints.
Tomorrow's engineers will he expected to
know how to apply the oxy-acetylene proc-
ess of welding and cutting in design, con-
struction and fabrication to give similar
sales advantages to many good products.
The word "welded" is packed with mean-
ing. It means light-weight without sacrifice
of strength. It means sturdiness and rugged-
ness that can never shake loose. It means
invisible joints as strong as the base metal.
It means smooth surfaces with no place for
corrosion to start. In short it means all that
one piece construction can mean plus com-
plete design freedom from the limitations
of other methods of fabrication.
Technical booklets describing the appli-
cation of this modern metal-working proc-
ess to a wide range of metals—steel and
iron, aluminum, copper, brass and many
other alloys and metals are available, with-
out obligation, from any Linde Office. Write

FROM AN EDITORIAL VIEWPOINT
IT'S OVER NOW, but what happened
to the engineer, his job and his sal-
ary during the depression? The data
most recently compiled from the Bureau
of Labor Statistics Survey of the Engi-
neering Profession tells a story of de-
creasing salaries, of a shifting of em-
ployment from private firms to federal
government work, to work outside the
field of engineering, and even of unem-
ployment and relief. However, the pic-
ture is no longer so dark, for the turn
has come. The bottom was reached in
1932 when thirteen percent of those
replying to the questionnaire were un-
employed. By 1934 unemployment
among engineers had fallen to only six
percent. The average period of unem-
ployment was sixteen to eighteen
months.
The most marked shift was the de-
crease in men in the employ of private
companies. This varied from eighty-
two percent in 1929, to fifty-four per-
cent in 1934. There were corresponding
increases in federal work and in non-
engineering work. A great number of
those who answered the questionnaire
were young engineers who graduated
from between 1929 and 1934. Answer-
ing the 1929 questions were 14,000 men
while 1934 replies numbered 24,000 and
the latter number included all the first
group. These young engineers must
have played a large part in swelling the
ranks in non-engineering work; answer-
ing the government call; and increas-
ing the unemployed. True quite a num-
ber of older men lost their jobs or
changed employment, but these 10,000
young engineers added considerably to
increasing the number who answered
"federal government," by 2000; "non-
engineering work," by 5000; "private
firm," by 2000; and, "unemployed," by
over 1000. A relatively small propor-
tion of the "depression graduates"
found work in the private organizations
that normally absorb over three-fourths
of all engineers.
Salaries dropped too. Private firms
that paid their engineers who had fin-
ished college prior to 1925 an average
salary of $5200 in 1929, were paying
these same men an average annual sal-
ary of $4100 in 1934. Federal salaries
dropped from a $3900 average in 1929
to $3300 in 1934.
Looking at the figures in another way
shows that salaries increase in almost a
straight line for the first few years after
graduation. In 1934 engineers just out
of school received $1000 a year from
private firms, while those who had been
out from two to four years got $1500;
those with from five to nine years ex-
perience, $2400; and, all men with
more than nine years experience aver-
aged $4100 per annum.
What do all these figures reveal?
They show that engineering is primarily
a profession of experience and they bear
out the old adage that it takes three
years to make an engineer out of a
college graduate. They also show that
the engineering profession is not im-
mune to depression troubles, and, espe-
cially, that the men who get their de-
grees during the depression have to
work at whatever is available. A ques-
tion that now arises is, "will these un-
fortunate fellows be able to leave their
extra-engineering jobs and return to the
fold, or must they continue in non-en-
gineering jobs — the proverbial filling
station attendant jobs? Judging from
the number of interviewers who have al-
ready visited this campus, private com-
panies are again in the market for en-
gineers, but will the poor "depression
graduate" get in on this? Salaries will
come back; more and more jobs are
opening up; but it looks like it takes
either youth or experience to get into
this engineering profession, and non-
engineering work frequently fails to give
much experience.

Aero Digest
Rivet* In the Sfku
by
A. GUSTAF STRANDHAGEN. '38E
A FEW WEEKS ago an insurance
company announced that about
$3,000,000 would be lost in property
and about 800 persons in the United
States killed in tornadoes, dust storms
and mysterious aircraft accidents dur-
ing 1937. Perhaps most of us who saw
the prediction dismissed the figures as
the ingenious product of one of those
clever statisticians, and let the item
pass.
But suppose one of us were closely
linked with some major disaster. We
would look for a cause for the tragedy
and a method to prevent its occurrence
in the future.
Certainly fantastic tricks of rapidly
moving air currents, once ascribed to
supernatural causes, is Public Enemy
No. 1 in the list of destroyers. Dis-
turbed currents of the upper air have
been linked by government experts with
the drought of 1930. Consequently it
is believed that a greater knowledge of
air currents will lead to a better under-
standing of how droughts and floods are
formed.
Hardly more than two centuries ago,
scientists knew so little about the laws
underlying movements of the atmos-
phere that they thought the trade winds
of the tropics were formed by the
"breath of the Sargasso weed." In the
Philosophical Society, Dr. Martin Lis-
ter, the English philosopher, stated that
as these winds were formed by the
breath of only certain species of plants,
they naturally blew in one direction. On
the other hand, the great variety of
plants and trees giving off breath on
land resulted in confusion and winds
blew from every point of the compass.
Such were the fallacious beliefs of the
last century. Turning our attention for
the moment to science of today, we are
aware of the enormous advances made
in building airships, bridges, skyscrap-
ers and ocean liners regard to strength,
performance, stability and endurance.
Any kind of structure, such as for ex-
ample a dirigible, is much safer today
than one built twenty years ago. These
crafts are so designed that they should
give on an average of thirty years of
sound service.
But—and here is the crux of our pre-
dicament—the dirigible built today, a
scientifically designed ship, cannot ex-
pect any more years of service than the
first dirigible which was designed and
built less scientifically. The Akron for
example, after a few years of service,
was suddenly torn apart and plunged
into the ocean. This ship was helpless
although it was designed with a safety
factor to resist every known hazard. No
one really knows what happened, and
how it occurred. Engineering science, it
would seem, is saving an increasing
number of supposedly well designed air-
ships from being wrecked by usual
causes, only to have them fall prey to
the fantastic pranks of powerful and
turbulent moving air currents. But
how, and in what manner do air cur-
rents flow? Are there some definite laws
they follow? If so, what are they? If
we knew these facts, our airships would
be safer because we could design them
to withstand these unknown conditions.
Science has only fragmentary answers
to these questions, but here and there
encouraging clues are being turned up.
Here, at the University of Michigan,
we have one of the few groups of men
in the world, studying and experiment-
ing in this particular field, and they can
be considered as an example of the new
attack upon this problem.
A preliminary report, published in
Civil Engineering, by Professors Sher-
lock and Stout, picture the structure of
the wind with iso-velocity lines. With
special anemometers these men were
able to obtain simultaneous and very
accurate readings of velocity from
which iso-velocity contours were plotted.
This diagram shows the variations that
occurred in a horizontal and also in a

isy^ifc,

rents were once ascribed to supernatural causes.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


seconds. Contour lines were drawn so
that any line represents a particular
velocity and passes through only those
intervals in which that particular vel-
ocity was indicated by the anemometer.
There is, for example, the clue of
correlation. We ask, "Is there some
physical characteristic of wind gust
which is invariably associated with a
tornado?"
Sherlock and Stout answer "yes," and
add that a tornado is a rapidly revolving
vortex. The characteristics of a vortex
are present in the case of water flowing
out of kitchen sink. In water the direc-
tion and velocity of flow are discernible,
but in a natural wind these phenomena
are not visible, so they can be disclosed
only by measurements of velocity or
pressure. Configurations of this type
can be seen in their figure at sec-
onds 147 to 150.
Dr. Paul Huss, a research engineer
under the supervision of Prof. R. H.
Sherlock, has been concentrating on the
study of duration and extent of wind
gusts. Dr. Huss finds in the existing
data, no inflexible fact to block the en-
gineer's preserving wish to protect a
ship or a building from destruction in
storms or tornadoes.
Prof. Sherlock's and Dr. Huss' latest
researches have been directed toward
expressing similarities of wind gusts sta-
tistically. These studies are devoted to
finding some fundamental or theoretical
laws regarding wind behavior. Already
the argument for this theoretical ap-

* Variation of velocity from the average depends upon the height above the ground.
proach has been strengthened. Results
seem to indicate in most general cases
that there is some regularity in velocity
variations.
Statistics show that turbulence varia-
tion of velocity from the average depend
upon the height above the ground since
large changes in the wind are due both
to ground effects and to the presence of
air brought down from a higher region
by temperature differences. Since this
is true, we have a basis to speculate and
suggest a new attack in design problems.
A very interesting fact is pointed out
by these men in connection with varia-
tion of velocity gradient. For example,
at station 9 and second 140 there exists
a gradient of 8 miles per hour in */£
second while immediately proceeding
this there is a gradient of only 1 mile
per hour during the same length of
time. It is believed that these high
gradients probably bare a close rela-
tionship to the buckling and twisting
moments brought about by the wind.
Therefore, by obtaining a graphical
cross section of the wind with experi-
mental devices and then studying the
gradients both in time and space, a val-
uable foundation for future design is
obtained which was heretofore un-
known.
Sherlock, Stout, and Huss are work-
ing on the project today. Other men
are working on it, here and there, in a
few scattered places. But the task is
unbelievingly intricate. The workers
are few and the available equipment is
extremely limited, and the financial sup-
port of these researches is trivial rela-
tive to the momentuous issue involved.
"In the 200 years since Lister's fan-
tastic theory that wind evolved from
plants, we are for the first time making
headway," say the experimenters, "in
charting and exploring the rivers that
run in the sky. Tomorrow, these re-
searches, which are being carried at this
university, may help to solve the mys-
teries and enable us to better under-
stand the rapidly moving masses of air
that play such a vital part in our lives."

• Six miles of pipe carrying refrigerated brine
from this dam of frozen mud.
LANDSLIDE ENGINEERING
An extremely novel solution for a
practical engineering problem was re-
cently affected by the engineers on the
Grand Coulee Dam project. The foun-
dation of this dam is of exceptionally
strong natural granite and lies 500 feet
below a layer of finely pulverized earth.
In one place this bed rock has been cut
to a depth of 120 feet by the action of
a stream in some past age. When this
gulch was almost emptied of earth, the
500 feet of embankment above it began
to slide down at the rate of two feet
per hour. Power shovels could not keep
up with the estimated 200,000 cubic
yards of moving earth and were forced
to retreat to keep from being buried.
Engineers in charge of the dam de-
cided to try an experiment by which the
earth at the base of the slide would be
frozen, forming a dam to hold back the
rest of the earth until concrete could be
poured. About six miles of pipe was
driven into the moving earth in the
form of many small arches. Two re-
frigerating machines were then brought
to the site and brine was pumped
through the pipes at a temperature low
enough to freeze the earth. The move-
ment of the slide was immediately
checked and work on the dam pro-
ceeded without further delay. To fur-
ther justify their action, engineers show
a savings of $100,000 in construction
costs.

large enough to include the demands of cur-

Speeding Up Metal
-finaLu5i5
New Device Analyzes Metal
in the Cupola
by
ALFRED WALDCHEN. '38E
THE past decade has seen the ac-
cumulation of a vast amount of
scientific data with only a small frac-
tion finding applications in industry.
Until recently the scientific material
available on the spectrum and spec-
troscopy has been included in that great
body of material which has found too
little industrial application.
The Department of Engineering Re-
search of the University of Michigan
has recently sponsored active investi-
gation in this field. The result of this re-
search is the perfection of a spectro-
graph^ method by which the quantita-
tive analysis of alloy cast iron may be
accomplished. This work was done by
Dr. H. B. Vincent, of the Department
of Engineering Research, in collabora-
tion with Professor R. A. Sawyer of the
physics department of the University of
Michigan. A method of analysis was
first developed at the University. Then
a similar set-up was installed at the
plant of the Campbell, Wyant and Can-
non Foundry Company in Muskegon,
Michigan, where it was put into suc-
cessful operation by Mr. A. M. Samp-
son of that company, who also partici-
pated in the development work at the
University.
The particular conditions met in the
routine production control of alloy cast
iron have been the chief impetus in the
perfection of this method of analysis.
The production of cast iron is a rela-
tively continuous process. Scrap iron of
widely varying compositions is dumped
in at the top of the cupola so that it is
difficult for the operator of the furnace
to hold exactly to the specified composi-
tion. If castings of specified composition
are to be produced, it is very desirable
to analyze the molten iron while still in
the cupola, so that necessary corrections
in the melt can be made before the
metal is poured. If analysis is made by
chemical means the elapsed time is so
long that serious changes in composition
of the molten iron alloy may occur.
Spectrographic analysis has reduced the
time between taking of the sample and
posting of results so that very little
change in composition occurs during the
analysis period.
The principles of this method of de-
termining the constituents of alloy cast
iron are not exceedingly complicated.
The cast iron being analyzed must be
volatilized and heated to luminescence
in some manner. This is done by insert-
ing small cast cylinders of the iron in
a damped spark circuit operating at
40,000 volts. The spark reaches temper-
atures far above that at which the alloy
vaporizes. At these high temperatures
the vapor is luminescent and emits light
characteristic of each constituent of the
alloy. A Bausch and Lomb Littrow spec-
trograph is used to record these emis-
sions. The light rays pass through a
prism in this apparatus and are dispersed
and photographed. Spectral lines char-
acteristic of each element present in the
vaporized iron alloy, appear in definite
relative positions on the photographic
plate. With the aid of microphotometer,
suitable measurements and calculations
on the density of these lines may be
made to determine the percent of each
constituent in the alloy.

• Errors in charging the cupola can be cor-
rected before pouring.
The way in which the vaporization
and excitation of the iron is accom-
plished has an important bearing on the
accuracy of the results obtained. Obvi-
ously it is essential that a source be used
which will give identical results with re-
peated tests on samples of the same
melt. Several methods were tried and
two appeared promising. One of these
methods was a 25 ampere d.c. arc using
a graphite cathode and a rotating cylin-
drical iron alloy anode. The other meth-
od, which is the one in use at present,
is a damped spark operating at 40,000
volts. About one kilowatt of power is
consumed in the spark circuit. This set-
up is capable of analyzing for the fol-
lowing elements in the ranges given:
Cr— .01-1.50% Mo— .09-1.25r^
Cu— .20-3.00 Ni— .10-2.00
Mn— .35-1.25 Si— .50-4.00
The outside ranges on routine cast iron
production would run about as follows:
Cr— .01-1.00% Mo— .10-1.00%
Cu— .20-2.00 Ni— .15-2.00
Mn— .40- .90 Si— 1.00-2.75
It is evident that the range of analysis
by the spectrograph is sufficiently large
to include the demands of current foun-
dry practice. If a wider range of com-
position is to be covered, suitable changes
in the source may be made.
The cost per analysis by this method
is considerably less than the cost for
analysis by gravimetric or volumetric
chemical means. This makes it possible
to analyze the iron alloy more frequent-
ly without added expense to the pro-
ducer, the closer adherence to specifica-
tions is thereby made possible. Frequent
analysis also reduces the number of re-
jected castings. This is well illustrated
by an incident which occurred in the
plant of the Campbell, Wyant and Can-
non Foundry Company. Camshaft iron
containing 0.35% Cr and 0.45% Mo
was being melted in the cupola. In this
case spectrographic analysis of the 8
o'clock sample of camshaft iron showed
high Cr and low Mo. The operators of
the furnace were immediately advised of
this fact and the furnace was taken out
of production. The boxes of alloy mate-
rial being supplied to the furnace were
checked spectrographically and, as sus-
pected, both proved to be Cr, whereas
one box should have contained Mo. The
error was corrected and the furnace was
again put in operation. If ordinary
chemical means of analysis had been
used in this instance it is doubtful if
the error would have been discovered
until hours later. The scrapping of cast-
ings would have been expensive.
A comparison of the results obtained
from the chemical and spectrographic
laboratories of the Campbell Wyant
and Cannon Foundry Co. brings out
some interesting facts with regard to
the relative accuracy of these two meth-
ods. The accompanying graph gives a
comparison of repeat analysis for Si in
cast iron. Two determinations on the
same sample of iron alloy were made
for each point plotted. If the two analy-
ses varied, the difference in percentages
was plotted as shown. The results from
the chemical laboratory are the results
of routine controlled analyses and are
not expected to have the highest attain-
able precision. Repeat analyses were
run only in case the chemical analysis
varied widely from the expected compo-
sition, or from the spectrographic analy-
sis. It is clear, however, that the
spectrographic analyses show superior
reliability.
The advantages of this spectrographic
method of analysis over gravimetric and
volumetric chemical methods may be
summed up as follows:
1. Wide deviations on repeat analysis
are minimized because the process is en-
tirely instrumental and does not require
continuous concentration on many de-
tails.
2. Because of the speedy analysis ob-
tained by this method, more careful con-
trol of composition during routine foun-
dry operations is possible.
3. The personnel cost per analysis,
using this method, is much less than the
cost using gravimetric chemical methods.
While the work for the Campbell Wy-
ant and Cannon Foundry Company was
restricted to cast irons, there is every
indication that variations of the method
will permit the application of the spec-
trograph to practically all of the quan-
titative analysis control problems in-
volving the metallic elements.

* A modern oil refinery where distillation plays its biggest role.
PROM THAT black, sticky mass,
*. coal tar, which formerly caused
manufacturers of coke many headaches,
come many of our modern dyes, drugs
and antiseptics, sweet scented perfumes,
explosives, synthetic resin bases, prod-
ucts for the preparation of synthetic
tannins, motor fuels, solvents, creosote,
and pitch. The separation of coal tar
into its multitude of useful components
is accomplished by the process of frac-
tional distillation. Likewise, distillation
has brought about the perfection of
present-day motor fuels and lubricants,
and the production of high quality sol-
vents, waxes and oils from crude petro-
leum. Although it now works many
wonders, the venerable process of dis-
tillation has only recently been sub-
jected to concerted scientific investiga-
tion.
It is believed that distillation was
first used by early Egyptians alchemists
in isolating their products. With the
beginning of the Christian era, some of
these alchemists began to write of their
distillation methods. Unfortunately, the
advancement of the distillation process
received a temporary setback in 290
A.D. when the Roman Emperor, Drocle-
tian, ordered all writings on alchemy to
be destroyed. His action was prompted
by the fear that the Egyptian alchem-
ists' activities in producing gold might
become successful, thus enabling them
to revolt against the Romans.
The Egyptians used clay and glass
vessels of small dimensions for their
simple distillation. More practical ap-
plications of the process were made by
the Arabs. Their knowledge was, in
part, brought to Europe by the return-
ing Crusaders in the twelfth and thir-
teenth centuries and gave impetus to its
development there. A short while be-
fore that time, alcohol was discovered
and its value was quickly realized. The
demand for this spirit, together with
the advanced technique of the Arabs,
gave distillation its start as an industrial
unit process.
The history of distillation from the
twelfth century until recent times has
been one of slow development and grad-
ual realization of the possibilities of the
process. The demand for petroleum
products, which increased very rapidly
after 1900, instigated a large amount
of scientific research and the advances
made since then have been a result of
a better understanding of the theory
underlying the process. This theory is
not basically difficult to comprehend
and a familiarity with it will enable one
to appreciate its possibilities.
A solution of ethyl alcohol and water
offer a good illustration of simple dis-
tillation. The alcohol is the more vola-
tile of the two, boiling at 78 C. Since
alcohol is the more volatile it will have
a slightly higher vapor pressure than
water at any given temparature. Be-
cause of this vapor pressure difference
the vapor rising from a boiling mixture
of alcohol and water will be richer in
alcohol. If this vapor is drawn off and
condensed relatively more alcohol than
water has been removed and the liquid
remaining is richer in water. In this
way, a partial separation has been ob-
tained. If this operation is repeated sev-
eral times, and each time the vapor is
condensed and set aside, several frac-
tions will be obtained, compositions of
which vary from one stronger in alcohol
than the original mixture, to one con-
taining nearly all water. When these
portions are redistilled, the condensates
grouped according to their compositions,
and the procedure repeated enough
times, the mixture will be separated into
alcohol and water. Unless an infinite
number of distillations are carried out
there will still be some alcohol in the
water and some water in the alcohol, in
amounts depending on the number of
times the fractions are redistilled. This
method is known as simple distillation,
which was referred to above as the
method used in early times. It is a
long and tedious process, but it was the
only one known until the twentieth
century.
The fact that the composition of a
vapor over such a mixture as alcohol
and water is different from that of the
liquid was put to a new use several
years ago. In distilling petroleum, the
vapor from one still body was bubbled
through the liquid of the next. This
proved more effective than simple dis-

our present-day fractionating column.
This column contains a number of
plates, one above the other, each of
which has a pool of liquid on it through
which vapor is forced to bubble. Con-
nected to the column at the bottom is
a still containing a steam coil. Heat
from the steam vaporizes the liquid in
the still forcing it to rise up the column.
The column is designed so that the
vapor passing up comes in intimate con-
tact with the liquid on each plate. This
is accomplished by the use of bubble
caps. In the center of each of these is
a collar, fitting tightly over a hole in
the plate and extending higher than the
liquid level. Over the collar a large cap
is fastened which allows vapor rising
through the collar to pass down around
the outside of it, forcing the vapor to
bubble through the liquid. The liquid
level on each plate is maintained at a
desired height by an overflow pipe pro-
jecting above the plate. The pipe ex-
tends under the liquid on the plate be-
low and thus prevents vapor from rising
through it. It can be seen that there
are two streams of material coming to
and leaving each plate. Vapor is rising
to the plate from the one below, and
liquid is coming down to it from the

ticed only by alchemists. It

plate above. The vapor, arriving at the
top, passes to a condenser which re-
turns most of it in liquid form to the
top plate of the column. The liquid of
lowest boiling point (hence is the cool-
est) is on the top plate, while the liquid
richer in the less volatile component
(and consequently of higher boiling
point) is in the still. Thus there is a
temperature gradient through the col-
umn with the hottest liquids (and va-
pors) at the bottom and the coolest at
the top. As vapor rises from one plate
to a cooler one above some of it is con-
densed and some of the liquid is evap-
orated with the net result that more of
the high boiling liquid is condensed and
more of the low boiling liquid vaporized
so that the liquid rising from this plate
is richer in the more volatile than is the
liquid rising to the plate. The effect of
the hotter liquid flowing down from the
plate above is similar. So, by small
steps, each putting a greater amount of
the more volatile constitutent of the
mixture in the vapor state and reducing
more of the less volatile to the liquid
state, great separations are made. The
separation can be improved by increas-
ing the number of plates in the column.
If the characteristics of the mixture to
be separated, and the plate efficiency
are known, the number of plates neces-
sary to perform any desired . iparation
can be calculated.
No mention has yet been made of
the feed, or of the products. Feed may
go into the still directly, but better re-
sults are obtained if it is introduced
part way up the column. The logical
place to introduce the feed is on the
plate where the composition of liquor
corresponds to the composition of the
feed. Liquid compositions vary from the
top to the bottom of the column with
intermediate compositions on the cen-
ter plates. The distillate is removed
from the condensed top product, but
only part of the top product is removed
—the greater portion is returned to the
top plate as reflux. This reflux is neces-
sary to keep liquid on the top plate for
equilibrium, otherwise it would run dry.
The waste product, or the liquid of
highest boiling point (in some cases
this is the desired product), is removed
at the bottom of the still. In the cases
of the distillation of a multi-component
material such as crude oil, products may
be removed from several intermediate
plates as well as from the top plate and
the still.
In a relatively few years an antique
process has been brought up-to-date.
In fact a new process, fractional dis-
tillation, has replaced the older one,
simple distillation. Fractional distilla-
tion has made possible better separa-
tions, lower steam costs for vaporizing
the liquid mixture, the conversion of a
batch process into a continuous one and
greatly increased production per unit.

PROFESSION
SIDELICHTS ON THE
ENGINEERING PROFESSION
COME interesting sidelights on the
^ engineering profession were brought
out in a recent survey made by the De-
partment of Labor. Eight and four-
tenths percent of the engineers covered
by the survey were working in another
branch of the profession than the one
for which they had qualified in college.
The proportion of men whose profes-
sional work differs from that in which
they specialized in school varies from
3.2c/c of the electrical, to 35.8% of the
industrial engineers.
A few men have obtained the status
of engineers without the benefit of a col-
lege education—2.5% of the members
of the profession have only a degree in
liberal arts. Only 0.9% of the engineer-
ing graduates have degrees in fields
other than engineering. This small
group originally graduated in engineer-
ing, but went on to get degrees in eco-
nomics, business administration, law,
etc.
A sizeable group of engineers (now
practicing as such) have never finished
college. On the whole 10.8% of all en-
gineers have not finished school—14.8%
of the civil engineers never finished
college, while only 4.1% of the ceramic
engineers are non-graduates. However,
more complete data shows that it is
now more difficult, and will, in the fu-
ture, become more difficult to attain a
professional status without an engineer-
ing degree.
FROM AMERICA'S EXECUTIVES
Executives in America's leading in-
dustries have something definite to say
about engineering graduates and col-
leges. Walter S. Landis, vice-president
of the American Cynamide Company of
New York, declares that the chemical
graduate "should be prepared to be-
come a part of an organization. The
student must be able to co-operate and
work with other men." In short, the
day of the super-smart, but extremely
alone engineer is over. H. A. Gait of
the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company
directed his remarks at the recent grad-
uates saying that although the gradu-
ates are well trained as laboratory as-
sistants, few among them are leaders or
original thinkers and fewer still have
any knowledge of economic values.
These gentlemen do not pull their
punches and it appears that it would
be a good idea if students began sup-
plementing their technical education
with broadening electives.
Fuels
So

Hat
IN the coal industry, as in many an-
other industry, specialization has
taken a hand. Formally when someone
wanted heat or power, he just ordered
a ton of coal. Later it became impor-
tant that he know what kind of coal he
was buying, and its heating value. Lat-
er still, he demanded a certain size class-
ification. Now, advanced practices in
the up-to-date power and central heat-
ing plants demand that the operator
know much more about the fuel he is
going to buy.
With modern equipment, it has been
discovered that a boiler and furnace
unit will operate much more successful-
ly if the fuel used is of uniform quality
and characteristics. The highest boiler
rating and efficiency, and the lowest
maintenance costs, can be obtained
when the coal supplied conforms closely

at all times to the standard of qualities
for which the equipment and furnace
are designed. In order to maintain this
uniformity, new methods of testing and
processing coal have been developed.
Samples of coal now undergo grind-
ability tests by the ball mill method.
Tests are being used to determine the
dustiness of coal and coke, and methods
are being developed for the removal of
the dust from the fuel, as fusain, a
principal ingredient of this dust, is det-
rimental to the firing of the coal. Coal
and coke are being treated with chemi-
cal and oil compounds, at the mine and
at the plant, in order to obtain special
results and dustless coal. This treat-
ment costs up to eighteen cents a ton,
but is proving economical because of
the better firing qualities imparted to
the fuel. Other researchers are chart-
ing fusion characteristics of different
types of coal at various temperatures,
and determining ash characteristics.
By means of technical advances in
methods of burning cheap grades of
coal, and in the discovery, production,
and refining of petroleum, our fuel re-
serves have been greatly expanded in
the last year.

AIRCRAFT OF THE FUTURE
In a recent special technical meeting,
sponsored jointly by the professional
societies, numerous predictions as to the
future of aviation were made by out-
standing authorities. Huge airliners
weighing 1,000,000 pounds and carry-
ing 1000 passengers were visualized for
1950 by I. I. Sikorsky of the United
Aircraft Mfg. Corporation. By 1941,
aircraft weighing 2,000,000 pounds with
average speeds of 250 m.p.h. and cap-
able of sustained flight at 25,000 feet
would be commonplace, he said. As to
the future of land versus water planes
it is predicted that flying boats will be-
come relatively more numerous because
of vast spaces available for landing and
take-off.
The fate of Diesel powered aircraft
in the future, it was explained, hinges
on the relative rates of improvement of
gasoline and Diesel engines. Although
the superiority of the Diesel with re-
spect to fuel costs was admitted, the
problem of fuel weight for the Diesel
was as yet unsolved. A generally opti-
mistic note was sounded for the future
of aeronautical engineering.

ECONOMICS
Railroads—Efficiency and Engineers
'"THE question of the ownership of
.*. the American railroads has long
been an editorial godsend to both pro-
fessional and amateur economists. Pub-
lic interest, long lacking, in the probable
solution to the railway tangle is quite
high at this time because of the several
bills pending in Congress concerning the
further regulation of the roads and their
possible nationalization. No opinions
have been expressed with any positive-
ness as to the outcome of this potential
legislation, but the part played by the
railroads in our economic structure is
such that it merits more attention than
it has received in the past. Economies
effected in rail transportation are for
the most part the work of engineers; as
these economies manifest themselves in
reduced rail rates the real incomes of
large districts are considerably affected.
In the light of the importance of our
railway system to everyone in the coun-
try this department offers the reader
some pertinent facts concerning Amer-
ica's 243,850 miles of railway lines.
Based on the latest official reports,
statistics of 1935, the railroads paid
509 million dollars in interest to their
creditors, most of whom are public or
semi-public institutions — universities,
banks, insurance companies and the
like. These roads also paid to its 865,-
000 stockholders 126 million dollars in
dividends. However, the entire railroad
picture shows a loss of a 118 million
dollars for the year 1935. In short,
some of these dividends and fixed costs
came from earnings of previous opera-
tions. Since 1935 the economic upswing
has been accelerated and profits will
probably show up in the 1936 statistics.
Nevertheless, the nature of the rail-
roads' creditors and the size of the
amortization burden is such that sees
one sufficient cause for all the literature
being dessimated concerning the rail-
road problem in America. It is well to
note in consideration of the railroads'
tremendous fixed costs that the roads
when, operating at a loss, are proving a
well known economic axiom. By con-
tinuing to move freight and passengers
they lost 118 millions dollars in 1935;
however, had they ceased operations,
their loss would have amounted to their
fixed costs or some 600 million dollars.
In our economics courses we learned
that it pays to continue in business if
the variable costs and part of the fixed
costs are covered by gross income. With-
out any disparity between theory and
practice, the American railway situa-
tion of the past few years might be in-
corporated, as an example, into the text
of Messrs. Bye and Hewitt.
Depression or no, deficit or dividend,
the various railway engineers keep ham-
mering away at inefficiencies—reducing
costs and always improving service.
Naturally, the depression hastened
many improvements tending toward
lower costs; today we see that the ad-
vances in transportation technique over
a period of 20 years are phenomenal.
Particularly striking is the reduction in
the number of locomotives in use by
the Class I railroads (railroads whose
operating revenue is in excess of 1,000,-
000 dollars per year). In 1916, 61,000
engines were used; in 1935, 46,594
were sufficient for a greater volume of
traffic. The reduction in hauling capital
here was 24.1% and the answer lies in
the increased power of each engine—
the 1916 engine had 33,188 pounds of
tractive power, 20 years later it had
48,367 pounds traction, an increase of
45.8%. From these figures it is seen
that the railroads had 25 million more
pounds of tractive power for 17,000 less
hauling units. Transforming this data
into savings on capital expenditures you
have something better than a billion dol-
lars saved over a period of 20 years.
This figure is certainly on the safe side
as it ignores maintenance and interest
on the sum necessary to own and oper-
ate the 17,000 units. In the same vein
as these efficiencies we see that 1,000
ton-miles of freight were moved by 163
pounds of coal in 1922, while 15 years
later the same amount of freight was
moved by 120 pounds of coal.
With the advent of the stream-lined
plane and the rising popularity of speed
in transportation, railroad engineers be-
gan to work on lessening the time be-
tween stations and today we find 11,718
ton-miles of freight moved per hour
against 7,459 in 1922. Speed has gone
up but freight losses have dropped:
over the same period as the speed im-
provement we see that losses per freight
car have gone down from 111 cents to
55. In a word, wherever an economy
was to be made, an engineer was there
to do the trick.
Taxes take 6.9% of the entire gross
revenue of the railroads and this amount
is greater than that expended for fuel.
In regard to these taxes, it is estimated
that 46% of the amount paid went to
the support of educational institutions
and 16% to the construction and main-
tenance of highways and roads. It is
seldom that one industrial organization
subsidizes a competitor.
A further consideration of the income
structure of the American railroads re-
veals several interesting facts. First:
total transportation operating receipts
for 1935 were 3,542,000,000 dollars, of
this, 81% was derived from freight rev-
enues: 31.5 million carloads of freight
at 0.99 cents per ton-mile. Passenger
traffic accounted for 10%: more than
445 million passengers were moved an
average of 41.4 miles and giving the
railroads an income of 1.94 cents per
passenger-mile. 1.5% of gross revenues
came from the 121 million express ship-
ments. From the proportion of total
revenue that is due to freight move-
ments it is seen that the ability of the
railroads to make profits lies in their
ability to find and move freights. In a
manner of speaking, the stream-lined
trains look swell but it is the roaring,
bustling freight train that brings in the
dividends. In this regard, one sees
cause for the railway executives' wor-
ries. The modern tendency is toward
decentralization of industries to avoid
cross shipments and the like. Many
large corporations are building plants
nearer to the consumer; the entire in-
dustrial trend is to eliminate the long
east-west and west-east haul. The long

are slowly becoming cognizant of that
fact and are quickly adopting cures and
substitutes. Despite the falling off of
freight shipments over a long period of
time, despite depressions and deficits,
the railroads are far from bankrupt. The
investment in equipment and roads ex-
ceeding the value of outstanding bonds
and stocks by 7 billion dollars. The
railroads are much healthier than many
an editor would have us believe.

IN GETTING himself placed with an
employer, the senior may face a
number of situations pertaining to ap-
plications and acceptances. A company
can make an offer which the senior ac-
cepts; conversely, the senior may apply
(thereby offering himself) and the com-
pany accepts the man. Both things
happen.
Some companies make a clear distinc-
tion between the interview on the one
hand, and the final act of hiring on the
other. They furnish two kinds of
blanks. First, the senior files the inter-
view blank, which commits no one to
anything. Through it, the senior gets
his chance to be interviewed. Next, if
he wishes, he fills out the company's
application blank. In general, unless
the senior writes in his reservations, or
unless reservations are stated on the
blank, he thereby offers himself, and
places himself liable to acceptance by
the company. Following acceptance, he
is morally bound to go to work at a
properly agreed-upon time. It must be
admitted—and every senior should know
—that it is unheard of for a company
to try to enforce its rights, and require
a senior to come to work in spite of his
having later changed his mind. The
company's good will would be too likely
to suffer through such an enforcement.
But—that does not alter the ethics of
the situation. A young engineer, right
at the start of his career, cannot afford
to injure his reputation by throwing
over the agreement in a light manner.
He must have very good reasons indeed
—and such as will appeal to the reason-
ableness of the first employer—in order
to justify his backing out.
But there is more to be said. Life
isn't a simple affair, even in placement
matters. Recruiting and placement
business goes on all the way from Jan-
uary to June. The average senior prop-
erly wishes to have a good look at sev-
eral or many opportunities. If he signs
himself up in January, he misses most
of the total interviews of the year. So,
if to file an application in January
makes him run the risk of an early
acceptance, he would refuse to apply
anywhere until June. A universal ap-
plication of such a method would turn
the merry month of June into a mad-
house, both for seniors and companies.
The company side of it is somewhat
similar. A recruiter making a definite
offer in January runs the risk of having
it accepted in good faith. But he still
has most of his colleges to visit, and he
naturally wants to see them all before
he fills his quota for the year. In fact,
he would like to see everybody, then go
back home and in the quiet of his of-
fice, review all records and select his
men. By that time—June—most of the
candidates would have signed up else-
where.
It becomes plain that a good deal of
the chaotic character of placement is
inevitable and ineradicable. Add in the
fact that recruiting officers themselves
have differing ideas and differing kinds
of personality, and you have the ex-
planation for some of the puzzling vari-
ations in practice. One company's ap-
plication blanks says, essentially, "Don't
file this unless you are in dead earnest;
as long as you hope to have other inter-
views, lay off; if you make application,
and we accept it, we expect you to come
to work." Now, what this company for-
gets to add is, "If we do not accept you,
you may have lost several good chances
to be interviewed by our competitors."
It is perfectly all right for this company
to do business this way, provided the
senior is willing. It of course means
that the wary senior is likely to let a
good share of the recruiting season pass
before he is willing to commit himself
completely in this way.
Other companies mostly permit any-
one to file application (although they
may already have done some sifting be-
fore granting interviews) and simply take
their chances at getting their men, when
they are ready to act. They know full
well that a given applicant has probably
applied in some other directions, and
they expect to lose out on some, for
that reason. Note clearly, however, that
many a young engineer makes a wrong
beginning of his career, by failing to
withdraw, promptly, all other applica-
tions when he accepts an offer that suits
him. If companies could act more
promptly, and if seniors would univer-
sally withdraw promptly, a good deal
of the hang-fire character of placement
would disappear.
A situation not covered by any of
the foregoing applies to the special case
where the senior definitely wants a cer-
tain employer, and the recruiting agent
knows very definitely what the company
wants. When these two get together—
and the senior is approved—a final ar-
rangement can be made almost on the
spot.
Perhaps too many seniors may feel
that their end of it is all done when
they have filed an application. In most
cases, the senior should secure a clear
verbal understanding, in the interview,
to the effect that he expects to hold
himself free for a while, to look in other
directions. Or when sending an applica-
tion by mail, any mental reservation he
has should be made a written reserva-
tion in the letter of transmittal. This
is fair to the company, and will be prop-
erly received by most employing officers.
There then may follow some corre-
spondence. An application a month old
is usually beginning to grow whiskers.
The senior thinks the company has for-
gotten him. The company thinks the

...WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG
As small boys, many fathers now living knew the telephone only as a little used
curiosity. It grew into today's constantly used necessity largely because the Bell
System never ceased looking for the new and better way. It stayed young in its thinking.
Young ideas developed "conference service'', enabling several nearby or widely
separated persons to talk on one telephone connection. Young ideas steadily made
Long Distance service better, quicker, yet cheaper.
Young ideas are at work day and night to make sure America continues to get
more and better service for its telephone dollar.

be wrong. In about two or three weeks,
the senior would usually do well to
write a follow-up letter, to let people
know he is still alive, and to bring the
situation up to date in any new respect.
When the company has at least in
part initiated negotiations with a senior,
it has no right to hold up an applica-
tion and the action on it, indifinitely.
Equally, the senior should not permit
his application to remain on file indef-
initely.
Recruiting is properly an open com-
petition. Once in a long while, a com-
pany will mistakenly take steps to evade
competition. If the recruiter comes to
Ann Arbor but not to the campus, be
careful. Sometimes this is done by high
grade firms who have already learned,
through the grapevine route, as to just
which seniors they ought to see. Then

Freshman and Sophomores
At this time all campus organizations
are calling for tryouts. Needless to say
the value of outside activities is tre-
mendous. Opportunities to supplement
the regular four-year curriculum with
the broadening influences of speech
groups and journalistic organizations are
to be had for the taking. Professor A.
D. Moore has shown, through his As-
sembly lectures, that the man who has
participated substantially in extra- cur-
ricular activities is the man industry
wants. But the best man for any stu-
dent organization is the man who, as
Professor Brackett states, realizes that
extra-curricular activities pay in their
own coin. Whether or not you get a
better job because of your activities is,
in the long run incidental, you are made
a better and broader citizen because of
your efforts along lines that are not
directly connected to your chosen field.
Motion Study Laboratory Here
A new Motion Study laboratory will
probably be constructed in the College
of Engineering in the next two years,
according to Professor Gordy of the Me-
they will see those men and no more.
But such recruiters will invariably work
with some faculty member, and invite
the senior to talk it over with this mem-
ber. Beware of the recruiter who does
not in any way work with the faculty,
and partciularly watch out for him if
he puts on the "rush'' act—wants you
to sign up by tonight. He is trying to
sell you a bill of goods before you can
ask someone where the soft spots are.
There are some seniors who create
their own difficulties, by agonizing all
over the place for several weeks, trying
to weigh every factor in order to make
exactly the right choice of a company
to work for. Such a choice is impossible.
The unknowns of the present and of
the future usually considerably out-
weigh all of the knowns. This is not to
say that a senior should not seek and
weigh all of the reasonably available in-

chanical Engineering Department. An
initial appropriation of $600 has already
been made and this sum has been used
to purchase small equipment with a
view towards final installation in a com-
plete unit. The purpose of the labora-
tory is to keep in the trend of industrial
development, and thus to give the stu-
dent practical experience as well as theo-
retical knowledge.
Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences
The fourth meeting of the Michigan
Student Branch of the Institute of the
Aeronautical Sciences, held on January
11, had as principal speaker Francis L.
Wallace, a member of last year's gradu-
ating class. Mr. Wallace, who was a
former president of the Engineering
Council, is at present employed by
United Air Lines as a co-pilot, operat-
ing between Chicago and Cheyenne,
Wyoming. The talk was devoted to a
discussion of his duties and experiences,
flying as a co-pilot, and of airline opera-
tions in general.
This year the institute plans, for the
first time, to have a group picture in

formation he can get. But to be speci-
fic—if newspaper files of the last fifteen
years should carry an undue number of
items about strikes against a manufac-
turer, or show that a utility seems to be
in constant difficulty with its customers
and the public—then factors exist, prob-
ably unknown to the senior, that may
very well outweigh everything he has
already learned about the prospective
employer. Another remark: a senior
who fusses too much in trying to make
a close decision may give an impression
which is sometimes correct—he doesn't
want to take any risk whatever, and he
is out for every dollar he can ultimately
get. Any recruiter is glad to help such
a candidate to land a job—with one of
his competitors. —A. D. Moore

New Buildings and Professional Societies
The plans, always rumored, for com-
pleting the quadrangle of the West En-

question of rooms for the various pro-
fessional societies of the Engineering
College. Inasmuch as the proposed ad-
dition to the present structure would
cross the diagonal, a room similar to
that of the Sigma Rho Tau reference
room would be created. Several profes-
sional groups are contemplating asking
for that room, should the addition be
realized. The idea, as suggested at a
recent Engineering Council meeting, is
to place together all the office machin-
ery of the various societies in this one
room. The result would be a focal point
for professional group activity and a
tendency for greater inter-society co-
operation.

tive.
No one is more conscious of this dual capacity
than are those whose business it is to supply
the tables of American homes with fruit and
vegetables.
When, for instance, the apple tree puts forth
its best efforts to produce fruit of faultless
quality, there is a host of pestiferous Insects
and sundry diseases constantly out to defeat
that purpose.
Should they succeed, they rob the apple of Its
beauty and quality—the fruit grower of his
profits. And, this danger extends to the peach,
pear,cherry and to countless vegetables as well.
Protecting crops against the ravages of insects
and disease Is one of the most urgent tasks of
the fruit and vegetable grower.
Aiding him In his fight are such organizations
as The Dow Chemical Company. Well in the
forefront of Dow's research program Is the
development of better insecticides and fungi-
cides.
In 1936, Dow was able to bring to fruit growers
two new developments in spray materials.
One, a superior wettable sulfur that possesses
a particle size of such microscopic fineness
that, when sprayed in solution, it literally
envelops fruit and foliage in a fog-Ilke blanket.
Thus, it provides protection more positive
than has been possible heretofore. The second
is a better dormant type spray that goes fur-
ther in its protective power yet avoids danger

to the operator or his equipment and offers in
addition, several important technical advan-
tages.
When you next pause to admire the smooth,
unblemished texture of an apple, the perfec-
tion of a peach, or the excellence of many
vegetables, remember that day In and day out
laboratory technicians, experimental stations
and, above all, the grower have striven hard to
attain such perfection.

OKONITE INSULATION
OKONITE insulation with an unsurpassed record
since 1878 is still generally recognized as the
acme of perfection for rubber insulations and as
"the best product possible" of its type.
The Okonite Company and its affiliates, how-
ever, have constantly kept step with the ad-
vances of the electric art.
Whether the wire or cable is large or small,
single or multiple conductor, high or low volt-
age, whether finished with a rubber or a syn-
thetic compound jacket, braid, lead sheath or
armor of any type, Okonite can make it.
In all cases, whether the correct solution calls
for rubber, impregnated paper, varnished cam-
bric, asbestos, glass or the newer synthetic
compounds, the policy still is and will continue
to be (fie best product possible.

4,000,000,000 GALLONS PER DAY
More than four times as much water
is used by the iron and steel industries
when operating at near capacity than
is used daily in all the five boroughs of
Greater New York. It is estimated that
approximately 4,000,000,000 gallons of
water are consumed daily by the steel
plants in the United States while the
highest daily average in New York was
985,000,000 in 1930. Annual consump-
tion of water in the steel industry runs
close to 500,000,000,000 gallons, this is
more than the storage capacity of any
of the great dams of the world with the
exception of Boulder Dam which can
store nearly 10,000,000,000,000 gallons
of water.
Approximately 45% of the water used
by the industry goes to make steam
while an additional 29% is used to cool
furnace doors and rolls, wash away scale
and operate hydraulic machinery. About
20% is used to cool the giant blast fur-
naces and the remainder to cool coke
as it emerges from the oven and for
sanitary purposes.

DO YOU KNOW THAT—
A pale red copper alloy of unknown
composition was discovered in Germany
about 200 years ago and because it was
extremely difficult to work and erratic
in its behavior, it was named Nick-
Kupfer, which means "devil copper" in
English. In 1751 Cronstedt isolated
the other metal in the copper alloy and
called it Nickel.
There is now on the market a new
kind of paint available in two types:
one which changes color permanently
on being heated, another which changes
color at a definite temperature and
changes back to the original color when
cooled. These paints are used to give
warning of overheating of motors, bear-
ings, and other heated equipment or as
permanent evidence of overheating.

Cage and Measuring Laboratory in-
stalled in the Department of Metal
Processing by the Ordnance De-
partment of the United States
Army.
The gage laboratory shown houses many types of measuring devices, includ-
ing an 8-inch capacity, 0.0001 inch super-micrometer and various sizes of in-
side and outside micrometers, vernier calipers, depth gages, indicating gages,
dial gages, master cylinder for checking squares, and a wide assortment of
precision plates and angle irons. Several standard sets of master gage blocks
provide accurate basic sizes for reference. With one of these sets, 125,000
measurements from 0.1001 to 12 inches can be made, each with a guaran-
teed accuracy of two millionths of an inch per inch. Standard reference
discs, thread measuring wires, precision balls, etc. are available, all of which
have been calibrated and certified by the Bureau of Standards. The latest
type of universal measuring machine, provides with measuring pressure con-
trol, is available with which direct or comparative measurements to within
ten millionths of an inch can be made.
Measuring devices are provided employing the principle of light-wave inter-
ference, whereby measurements can be made in terms of light waves to an
accuracy of a millionth part of an inch. A projection machine for measur-
ing profiles of parts is available in which the profile of a gear tooth or screw
thread is projected on a screen at a magnification of 100 or 200. The shadow,
standing out clearly, may be measured directly or compared with given stand-
ards. The profilograph for making magnified contours of smooth surfaces
showing variations within a few millionths of an inch is also housed in this
laboratory.
This is 'an example of the many types of research equipment available in
the Engineering College and Allied Science division of the University for
use in connection with industrial research projects.

More Slide Rule Tricks
FRACTIONAL roots of numbers
less than one always offer some
trouble. The LLO scale is not continu-
ous throughout the length of the rule,
its accuracy is in places limited to
only significant figures and it does not
cover the whole range, from one to
zero (only from .97 to 0.05). On the
whole the use of this scale is so com-
plicated that you have to have a guide
book to get the answer. However, a
little simple arithmetic will put the ac-
tivity down on to the more familiar
LL1, LL2, and LL3 scales.
By expressing a fraction less than
one as a whole number divided by ten,
one hundred, or one thousand. The
whole expression to a fractional power
or root is the quotient of each the
numerator and denominator to the same

LOSE A NEEDLE?
Not a needle in a haystack, but perhaps a needle in
a rug. During the manufacture of rugs, needles mav
become broken and embedded in the finished prod-
uct. Former methods of inspection were tedious and
time-wasting, but a new magnetic device indicates
the exact location of the steel fragment.
This iron detector, developed in the General Engi-
neering Laboratory of the General Electric Com-
pany, consists of a test coil, a motor-generator set,
and an amplifier. The rug is passed through the
magnetic field twice in directions at right angles.
The presence of a broken needle causes a distortion
in the magnetic field and consequently an unbal-
anced voltage in the secondary coil. This unbalance
is amplified, and the relays cause signal lights to
glow.
Detectors of similar principle have previously been
developed for such uses as detecting scrap iron in
sugar cane and in scrap cellophane. The General
Engineering Laboratory is constantly receiving
problems from industrial concerns and is develop-
ing equipment or giving suggestions to solve these
problems.

MICROANALYSIS
Two million I lis of a gram of material present in a
25-cubic-centimeter sample is almost as inconspicu-
ous as one man in a group composed of the combined
populations of New York City, Chicago, and De-
troit gathered in one huge stadium, yet the photo-
lube and the recently developed spectrophotometer
can accurately determine such microscopic quanti-
ties. This detector has been commercially developed
in the laboratories of the General Electric Company
from the original design by Professor A. C. Hardv of
M. I. T.
In medical science, the spectrophotometer should
prove very useful. The presence and amount of al-
most any element which will form a colored com-
pound when combined with some reagent can be
determined. In the industrial field, paints have been
studied and the effects of heat, light, ultraviolet
radiation, humidity, and surface greases have been
measured. This has proved a reliable guide to pur-
chase of these materials.
The spectrophotometer is admirably adapted to the
study of problems involving colored substances. Its
scope extends far beyond chemistry, physics, or
industry. In fact, it is in the biological sciences that
the instrument will probably find its most important
applications.

BY A NOSE
A century ago there was a race between a horse and
a locomotive. No such race will be necessary to
determine the supremacy of the steam-electric
locomotive being built for the Union Pacific Rail-
road by the General Electric Company. This new
unit will get its first trial run on the test tracks at
the Erie, Pa., Works early this year.
This new passenger unit will carry a steam-turbine
electric generating plant to feed power to the traction
motors. The turbine will exhaust through conden-
sers, using the same water over and over with small
additions to make up for leakage. A new, highly effi-
cient type of steam boiler has been built, and heavy
fuel oil similar to that used in present-day locomo-
tives will be used.
The new unit will be a double-cab locomotive,stream-
lined, practically smokeless, and provided with
power equipment for air-conditioning the trailing
passenger cars. It is rated at 5000 horse-power and
is capable of hauling 1000-ton trains at a speed of
110 miles an hour. The efficient fuel consumption
will allow runs of hundreds of miles at top speed
without a stop.
The many desirable constructional features of the
modern high-speed electric locomotive will be in-
corporated in the design as a result of General
Electric's many years of experience in building and
equipping electric locomotives.

Thus engineers obtain the service of the best alloys at
the cost of ordinary steel
THROUGHOUT industry, wear on
metals is an important cost factor.
Until recently, most wearing parts had
to be made entirely of special high-cost
materials. Now, by welding, rapidly wear-
ing surfaces can be covered with a wear-
resistant alloy. Welded additions of bronze
or Haynes Stellite—a wear-resisting alloy
of cobalt, chromium and tungsten—
create excellent wear resistance at low
cost.
Long Life at Low Cost
Wherever metal has hard work to do,
wearproofing by welding plays an im-
portant part. Under the toughest condi-
tions, in mines and mills, in factories
and on farms, in construction and oil-
drilling, it is saving money and time.
Wearproofed parts will last many times
as long as those made of unprotected iron
or steel. Welding cost, including the
necessary alloy, is only a f raction of the
total cost of a new part. Then, after long,
hard service, the part can be re-covered—
another wear-resisting surface can be
welded on at small cost, and the part is
again as good as new.
Extensive Savings
Savings through the application of
wear-resistant alloys are not confined to
the lower cost of the part involved. Less
power is used. Inventories are cut due to
the consequently lowered investment and
simplified control. Machine shutdowns
for replacement are fewer. Maintenance
costs are decreased, and a smaller crew
can handle the necessary repairs. Further,
the plant, without added equipment, can
turn out a greater volume of production.
Figures drawn from case-histories
where wearproofing is used are often
surprising. A glance at the adjoining
column will indicate many of the possi-
bilities inherent in this process.


Welding makes automotive exhaust valve
seats good for 150,000 miles and more, with
no regrinding in truck and bus motors, the
toughest kind of service. These valve seats are
wearproofed by welding Haynes Stellite to
the contact surface. Ordinary cast-iron seats
need regrinding every ten thousand miles.
Welding saved $2200 in one year for an
Ohio pulp mill. Haynes Stellite was welded to
the wearing surfaces of shredder knives. This
work cost $90; knives, from the scrap heap,
cost nothing. Hard-faced knives lasted for six
months, and were again refaced by welding.
New knives cost $200, last one month.
Welding a wear-resistant facing on the cut-
ting edges of boiler-tube cleaners yields a
twenty-fold saving—each cleaner will clean
twenty times as many tubes as an ordinary
cutter. When worn, hard-faced cutters are
rebuilt for another long service.
Welding cured pump troubles in a pulp
mill. Shafting on a sludge pump was wearing
rapidly. Packing glands had to be tightened
every hour, completely repacked once a week.
The shaft was fast disappearing. Hard-faced
by welding with wear-resistant metal, the shaft
ran for three months with no attention, no
appreciable wear.
Welding lengthens the life of blooming-
mill shear clutches three times. Clutches pre-
viously ran 49 days, then went to the scrap
pile. Now, wearproofed by welding, these
clutches average 217 days before any attention
is necessary. The same clutches are then re-
faced and used again.
Welding has solved an impossible lubri-
cating problem. At a Southern mill where
heater furnaces are fed by internal conveyor,
rolls and bearings operate at 750 degrees Fah-
renheit. Lubrication is impossible. A wear-
resistant coating, built up on the rolls and
bearings by welding, makes the conveyor last
indefinitely, eliminates need for lubrication.
Tomorrow's engineers will be expected to
know how to take advantage of this modern
metalworking process. Many valuable and in-
teresting technical booklets describing the ap-
plication of the oxy-acetylene process are
available without obligation. For further in-
formation write any Linde office.
The Linde Air Products Company
INTO THIS YAWNING CAVITY goes the dirt to make Grand Coulee Dam. Bucket front
and teeth were hard-faced by welding. The result of this wearproofing was six months'
service on Bonneville Dam, and many more months of trouble-free, repairless service on
Grand Coulee.

THIS MONTH, LAST MONTH, AND THE NEXT
Last month saw hall sales reach an all-time high for the current
publication period; with this in mind and with an eye to reader desires
we present our biggest and, we think, our best issue of the year. Post-
graduation life is discussed in "June and then—?" by Al Marshall, '35E
and former Managing Editor of the MICHIGAN TECHNIC. The latest
developments in air-conditioning are ably presented in "Residence Air
Conditioning—What It Is and What It Costs" by Mr. ]. H. Walker, HE.
Professor A. D. Moore's article—"What is an Engineer Worth Today?"
continues the professor's interesting work on salaries. This issue, con-
taining his article, is being sent to several hundred industrial executives
to get their opinion on the matters pertaining to engineers incomes.
Next month will see the new publication board in action, attaining

Tih- conditioning
What It Is and What It Costs
by
J. H. WALKER 'HE
SUPERINTENDENT OF CENTRAL HEATING
THE DETROIT EDISON COMPANY
AS WITH most new developments,
the progress of air conditioning
in each of its various fields of application
has been due to a proper relationship
between its value and its cost. The first
uses of air conditioning were in those
manufacturing plants in which the ma-
terials in process were benefited by a
particular atmospheric environment and
it is now regarded either as a necessity
or a highly profitable investment in
many manufacturing processes. Air
conditioning is also regarded as a good
investment in many establishments such
as theatres and stores in which the
comfort of the clientele is of definite
commercial value. The efficiency of the
worker has been found to be improved
by air conditioning, under certain condi-
tions, and it is being carefully studied,
and to some extent adopted, for that
reason.
The air conditioning of residences is
a further application of great commer-
cial importance to the manufacturers of
equipment and to the public utility com-
panies and has aroused much popular
interest. In this field the benefits of
air conditioning must be sufficiently real
and sufficiently appreciated by the home
owner to impel him to incur the initial
investment for the apparatus and to pay
the yearly operating expense. What does
it cost to have air conditioning in a
residence? First let us see just what
resident air-conditioning really means.
It would be difficult to find a subject
regarding which there has been a greater
lack of understanding on the part of the
public and more misrepresentation on
the part of some commercial interests
than air conditioning. Much of the dif-
ficulty can be traced to the use of the
term "air conditioning" to embrace a
number of independent functions. The
term is analogous to such words as
"clothing," and a gadget which spins
around on the ceiling and creates a little
air movement should no more be
thought of as giving true air condition-
ing than a necktie should be regarded
as a suit of clothes. Yet both are cov-
ered by their respective generic terms.
Air conditioning has been officially
defined as "The simultaneous control of
all or at least the first three of those
factors affecting both the physical and
chemical conditions of the atmosphere
within any structure. These factors in-
clude temperature, humidity, air motion,
distribution, dust, bacteria, odors, toxic
gases, and ionization, most of which
affect a greater or lesser degree human
health or comfort." One important point
to be noted in this definition is that air
conditioning includes the function of
heating. Obviously it is of primary im-
portance to have one's house adequately
warm, and a proper air conditioning
system must therefore first of all be a
good heating system. Furthermore the
value of some of the secondary func-
tions of air conditioning will depend in
each specific case upon the local at-
mospheric conditions. Thus in a country
residence it is unnecessary to provide
for the reduction of bacterial or toxic
gas content of the air, as might be re-
quired in a hospital or a chemical plant.
To produce what is regarded as
complete air-conditioning in residences
we must control the following factors—
Temperature; Humidity; Air Motion;
Dust; Odors. Now the temperature.
humidity, and air motion combine to
produce the overall sensation of warmth,
and to say that we control the tempera-
ture, humidity and air motion is simply
saying that we keep the house just warm
enough. The maintaining of a moderate
amount of humidity, aside from its
effect on our sensation of warmth, is
thought to have a beneficial effect on
the mucous linings of the respiratory
passages and to decrease susceptibility
to infectious diseases. This, however,
has not yet been conclusively demon-
strated. There are serious difficulties in
having a high humidity in houses as
they are now usually constructed. The
condensation of moisture on windows
ruins paint and wall decorations, and
may in time do harm to the wall struc-
ture itself. Double windows are highly
important.
Thus, notwithstanding the academic
definition of air conditioning, what air
conditioning actually does in residences
is to maintain the proper amount of
warmth and a moderate humidity, to
filter dust from the air, and to introduce
enough fresh air to avoid accumulation
of odors.
Winter Air Conditioning
The regulation of warmth is a much
simpler matter in winter than it is in
summer. It requires merely the com-
bustion of fuel in suitable apparatus to
add heat to a room . but to remove heat
is a more complex and costly operation.
In the one case heat is flowing down-
hill on the temperature scale, so to
speak. In the other case it is being
pumped up-hill, and this is always a
more elaborate thermodynamic process.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


plexity of summer time air-conditioning,
much greater commercial emphasis is at
present being placed on systems of so-
called winter air-conditioning. Manu-
facturers have found that they can eas-
ily sell winter air-conditioning but they
believe that the public is not quite ready
to buy summer cooling systems in large
numbers.
The great majority of the residen-
tial air-conditioning systems which are
being offered today are built around
that simple piece of heating apparatus—
the warm air furnace. But the modern
warm air furnace is a great improve-
ment over its forbears. The addition of
a centrifugal fan makes it possible to
filter the air and to use much smaller
ducts for conveying the air to the va-
rious rooms. Also the ducts can be
tucked up close to the basement ceiling
and the basement space can be much
more fully utilized. The usual winter-
time air-conditioning system for a resi-
dence consists therefore of a warm air
furnace using a fan to circulate the air,
a filter for removing dust and a water
spray for humidification. With ade-
quate control devices, such a system
usually gives what may be truthfully
called winter air-conditioning. Obviously
its most important function is to provide
adequate warmth, but too often the
vendor through careless design or in the
effort to reduce costs, fails to produce
satisfactory heating.
Winter air-conditioning may be in-
stalled in houses which are heated by
steam or hot water by the addition of a
fan, filter, and humidifier in conjunction
with a simple system of air ducts lead-
ing to the more important rooms.
• Winter air condition-
ing is usually combined
with the heating system

The only cooling effect obtainable in
summer from these winter air-condition-
ing systems is that which can be pro-
duced in the evening by drawing in and
circulating the cooler outdoor air. Dur-
ing the daytime the cooling effect due
to the mere movement of recirculated air
within the house has been shown by
careful tests to be practically nil.
This then is winter-time air-condi-
tioning—heating, humidifying, circulat-
ing, and filtering—a thoroughly good
heating system if properly designed but
sometimes over-rated as to the value of
some of its features by enthusiastic
salesmen.
Winter air-conditioning can hardly be
considered very costly. The initial cost
of the apparatus is usually appreciably
greater than the simple warm-air fur-
nace and, as much as, or slightly less
than, a steam or hot water heating sys-
tem of equally good quality. The com-
parison with the ordinary warm-air fur-
nace is hardly fair in some cases because

forced-air circulation gives more satis-
factory heating conditions in a large
spread-out house than would be pro-
duced by the warm-air furnace alone.
The operating cost of winter air-con-
ditioning, over and above the cost of
heating alone, is merely the cost of the
electricity used to operate the fan. Fig-
ures for one residence of eight rooms
show the following electricity con-
sumption:

1933-34 912 $21.52
1934-35 711 16.00
1935-36 660 14.85
The electric rate of 2 Vic is lower
than prevails in most localities but is
the rate charged in southeastern Mich-
igan for current used in excess of a
certain minimum.
Summer Air-Conditioning
Summer air-conditioning includes
cooling, dehumidifying, circulating, and
filtering. Cooling and dehumidifying
are usually a combined operation be-
cause as air is cooled below its dew-
point, moisture is removed by condensa-
tion. The amount of dehumidifying
which is done may therefore be regu-
lated by adjusting the temperature to
which the air is cooled as it passes
through the apparatus.
For residences the cooling medium
may be well water, ice, or mechanical
refrigeration. There are also certain
methods which produce their result pri-
marily through dehumidification rather
than cooling. Water from deep wells,
and in some cases from the city water
supply, may be at a sufficiently low
temperature throughout the summer.
MARCH 1937


• An attic fan ef-
fectively cools a bed-
room
The temperature should not exceed 55
degrees to be satisfactory. The water
is simply passed through a coil over
which the air supply to the rooms is
circulated by a fan. Ice is sometimes
used and is a simple cooling medium
but the operating cost is relatively high
because of the cost of ice. The initial
investment cost of a system using ice is
somewhat less than that of a refrigera-
tion plant. The majority of summer air-
conditioning systems employ a refriger-
ating machine in which a refrigerant gas
is mechanically compressed, condensed
to a liquid, and then allowed to reevapo-
rate with absorption of heat in a coil
over which the air is passed. A chem-
ical which is widely used as a refriger-
ant is dichlorodifluoromethane, otherwise
known as Freon.
The thermal process of cooling a
building should not be thought of as
merely the reverse of the process of
heating. During the winter there is a
continuous, though variable, flow of
heat outward from the building but
summer cooling is a decidedly inter-
mittent process. On many days no
cooling is required and even in the hot-
test periods there is usually a reversal
of flow of heat from inward to outward
during the night. In fact with a heavy
wall most of the heat absorbed by the
wall during the daytime may not reach
the interior at all but may be dissipated
outward at night. Awnings are almost
essential if a house is to be cooled
because the radiant heat of the sun
through unshaded windows is a large
factor. Insulation of the walls is also
helpful in summer as well as in winter.
Summer cooling is easily added to a
winter air-conditioning system as illus-
trated in the accompanying sketch. Such
a system cools the entire house but if
only one or two rooms are desired to be
cooled, compact portable units, which
are rapidly being perfected and simpli-
fied, are available.
The Cost of Summer Air Conditioning
What does it cost to keep a house cool
when the weather is hot? The initial
investment (assuming that the house is
equipped with a properly designed fur-
tion for the house illustrated herewith,
as reported by The Detroit Edison Com-
pany. It is an eight-room house occu-
pied by a family of five—two adults and
three children. The walls are insulated
and outside blinds or awnings are in-
stalled on all of the windows exposed to
the sun. The first floor temperature
never rose above about 81 degrees and
a moderate humidity was maintained.
The cost figures for winter air-condi-
tioning, previously tabulated, were for
this same residence. No restrictions
were placed on the use of the cooling
apparatus, and it was no doubt operated
at least as generously as would be done
by the average family. During the sum-
mers of 1932 and '3S ice was used, but
in 1934 the ice tank was replaced by an
electrically-driven two-ton refrigerating
machine. The accompanying table gives
the results for the five summers of
operation.
These figures show some interesting
things. Although the summers of 1933,

quired to add the refrigerating machine
and the coil through which the cold re-
frigerant gas flows and around which the
air passes no its way to the various
rooms. If ice is to be used, the ice melt-
ing tank, a small pump, and a cooling
coil are needed. There is much diversity
of thought as to how large the refriger-
ating plant must be for a given house.
If we assume a machine rated at two
tons of refrigeration and driven by a
two horsepower motor, the cost of add-
ing the cooling equipment will be from
$500 to $700. An ice tank and its aux-
iliary equipment will cost from $300 to
$500 depending on the storage capacity,
amount of heat insulation, etc.

ALBERT E. MARSHALL '35E

Ford Motor Co.
FOUR long years of study, of con-
centrating, of grinding, and then
blooms forth the engineer. But is this
true? Technically, yes; practically, no.
Let me go further and meander among
reminiscences and impressions of the
two years following graduation. The
years of school are merely the germi-
nating period, resulting, not in the
bloom, but in the bud. The bloom then
depends on the treatment the bud re-
ceives. And so it is with engineering,
—the outcome depends on the treat-
ment after graduation.
This world of ours can be cruel, re-
lentless, tiring, and demanding, but the
fruits repay the toils. And by 'the
fruits' I do not mean solely the tangible
remuneration but also the intangible re-
muneration. Money does not mean
everything. Wealth and success are
not measured in terms of money, but in
a large degree in terms of character,
friendship, social acceptance, contribu-
tion toward humanity, and respect
among one's associates and in one's com-
munity. Perhaps this sounds a little
overemphasized. I'll grant that it is
highly important and essential to make
a living, but there is no finer sense of
satisfaction than to be able to converse
intelligently with business associates and
executives and feel that your ideas and
opinons are appreciated and considered.
There is no better feeling of accomplish-
ment than to know that you are re-
spected, and, what is more, there is no
more gratifying knowledge than the
knowledge that you are doing your best.
These three factors, and these alone,
lead to contentment which is a major
ambition in any person's life. It is not
the well paid job which marks an engin-
eer as outstanding; it is his accomplish-
ments which in turn depend entirely on
his interest in and contentment with his
work. Which all leads to this one state-
ment; ''Engineering does not stop upon
receipt of a diploma." Nor, on the
other hand, does engineering consist
solely of technical knowledge gleaned
from perennial contact with books. The
ultimate goal of every engineer should
be to contribute something to humanity
and not to make a living at the expense
of humanity. This can be accomplished
only with self-contentment, an interest
in one's work, and a broad field of un-
derstanding.
Let us for a moment consider the
engineer in practice. He is not forever
quoting theories nor speaking in terms
of formulas nor rambling among integral
signs, but on the contrary his work is
quite diversified. A knowledge of busi-
ness, keen judgment, forethought, and
the ability to make decisions are all es-
sential in his repertoire. The most vital
weapons an engineer can possess are an
analytical mind and the ability to con-
sider a problem from all possible angles.
Of course, I can speak only of my own
experience. I do not say that highly
theoretical jobs are non-existent, but I
do say that in a majority of cases the
engineer's work is more extensive than
theoretical engineering. My specific job
has involved laboring, experimental
work, designing, cost analysis, industrial
management, pure business in the strict-
est sense of the word, sales promotion,
and even journalistic work and adver-
tising work. Such a variety did not hap-
pen by choice but by necessity. Even
though highly theoretical work was not
involved to any great extent, I still have
had to study and I still have found need
to use a slide rule.
Now let us go back and consider the
schooling—I previously termed this the
germinating period. By this I do not
mean to slight it; no, in fact it is the
most vital part of an engineer's training.
This period is the foundation upon
which to build. It is just as necessary
to engineering as a foundation is to a
superstructure, or even as the sun to
life itself. In other words, this founda-
tion is the source of any future develop-
ment. Perhaps you think that you will
never use this technical background, but
when you think that, you forget one
fact; an engineer is renowned not for
his ability to quote formulas but for his
ability to reason intelligently. You may
forget that the stress due to bending is
MV
equal to or that the power in a
I
three phase system of unity power fac-
tor is equal to \/3 EI, but one trait will
remain, a trait that is inherently de-
veloped throughout four years as a di-
rect result of this technical training, a
trait that is the mark of an engineer—
THE ABILITY TO ANALYZE IN-
TELLIGENTLY.
Believe me, engineering is a grand
profession.

Those of you who have aspirations
for eternal life should make haste to
board the nearest passenger train. Once
on the train you could travel at 60 miles
per hour for 24 hours a day, 365 days
a year for 3500 years before being
hailed by the Grim Reaper. All this
safety has come to us within the last
century; a hundred years ago passen-
gers were travelling over rickety road-
beds and cast-iron strap-rails nailed
down to wooden bases. These first rails
had a faculty for coming loose at the
ends and rushing up into the cars to
impale unwary travelers; their contin-
ued use was soon discouraged. In 1935
out total railway system moved 18 bil-
lion passenger-miles without a fatality.
Whence this unparalleled safety record?
Then answer lies to a large degree in
the perfection of the rail and rail main-
tenance. Rail failures today are prac-
tically unheard of. Two things go to
make this possible: steel manufacturing
technique and efficient maintenance.
Maintenance systems vary in their
particulars with the discretion of local
supervisors and traffic conditions. As
the traffic increases the section main-
tained per man decreases. Mere eye
inspection no longer suffices on the ma-
jor roads, various instrumental aids be-
ing employed to eliminate human errors.
In some cases continuous tests are run
by an ingenious electrical device called
the Sperry detector car. This car tra-
Wb**fc«
vels along the track being inspected and
feeds a powerful electric current into
the rail, automatically marking the rail
with a white paint wherever a crack or
similar defect exists in the rail. Manu-
facturers have simplified road inspection
by hot stamping along the side of the
rail information concerning its date,
place, and method of manufacture.
They also give the very important in-
formation concerning where that par-
ticular rail came from on the original
ingot, i.e., from the top or center or
bottom portion of the ingot.
The greatest moves toward rail safety
and rail perfection found their origin
not in removal after failure but in the
prevention of failures. More attention,

many manufacturers cooperating, is be-
ing given to make rails fool-proof than
is expended on the fabrication of ex-
treme precision instruments. Yet all this
attention results in a product costing
but 1.62 cents per pound (at this writ-
ing). This is less than the cost of salt
at retail and only a small fraction of the
cost per pound of meat. The American
Railway Engineering Association has
spent more than SI00.000 in recent
years in rail research at the University
of Illinois. Every device known to
metallurgical science and technique is
being employed to find the perfect rail.
Why all this effort? Just simple dollars
and cents economy. The ability of a
rail to stand up under rapidly moving
loads determines the size of the loads
and the speed at which it can travel.
Obviously there would be no point to
building a train to go 200 miles per hour
if the rail carrying the train will fail
from impact loads at half that speed.
Today there are 400 passenger trains
traveling long distances at speeds of
60 mph; six years ago there were only
30. Six years ago there were more pas-
sengers being carried; why not more
fast trains? The trains were awaiting
the rails that could safely support them.
Once rails were fabricated from cast-
iron and at times from wrought iron in
sections so thin that they would buckle
under the static load of a modern Mallet
locomotive. This condition limited rail-
way progress until the introduction of
the Bessemer converter into this country.
This cheap, rapid method of producing
good steel suitable for rails revolution-
ized steel manufacturing technique and
subsequently rail making and the entire
railway picture. The post-Civil War
days saw the Golden Age of railway ex-
pansion; in 1875 some 260,000 tons of
steel rails were produced. From this
point on rail fabrication progressed rap-
idly ai,d 1906 saw an all-time high for
manufactured steel rails with 4,000,000
tons; at this time production was shift-
ing from the Bessemer rail to that pro-
duced by the open hearth method. To-
day all steel rails are of open hearth
origin, this method allowing for greater
control of chemical composition.
A brief synopsis of the rail manufac-
turing process will give good reason for
eternal life in a Pullman car. Ingots
weighing originally 10,000 to 15,000
pounds are cropped from 1500 to 2500
pounds so that all probable impurities
are removed. It is then rolled on the
roughing mill, finally emerging, after
careful supervision all along the route,
in the finishing rolls. The rail shape is
now complete and rigid inspection be-
gins. The rails are hot sawed, allowing
7 inches for shrinkage upon cooling.
The inspector then takes three sections
of "A" rails (from the top of the ingot)
each 4 to 6 feet long from the second,
middle and last full ingot of each heat
and drops a ton weight a distance of
about 20 feet on the rail head. This is
to see if the rail can stand that sort of
treatment regardless of the fact that
when in use it will never be subjected
to that type of usage. If any one of
these three fail all of the "A" rails are
rejected. (Engineers have a penchant
for staying on the right side of a given
safety factor.) Similar tests are then
conducted for the "B'' rails (lower in
the ingot) and for the "C" rails. If any
of the rails in the "B" or "C" group fail
the entire heat is rejected.
The rails which pass this test are not
sufficiently well investigated for the
meticulous engineer. The rails must be
able to stretch without any visible signs
of fracture. Two specimens are nicked
and broken so that the structure of the
metal can be examined and scrutinized
for blow holes, distinctly bright or fine
grains, or any other granular defects.
If the rails pass all these tests they
are then subjected to a dimensional
check; they must not vary more than
three-eighths of an inch in 39 feet.
Compare to this the days when rails
were rejected only for being visibly
crooked or when the lengths varied con-
siderably. Flaws were accepted in the
old days as long as they were under a
quarter of an inch in length or depth.
Carbon content during this same early
period of American rail manufacture
was the only chemical which was re-
stricted to any extent and the limits
there varied from 30 to 50 points. Pres-
ent specifications limit the carbon, man-
ganese, phosphorus and silicon content;
moreover it is required that the number
of heats above mean carbon percentage
of the specified range must equal the
number of heats below the mean and
that the average carbon shall be as high
as the mean.
In the early days rails were 30 feet
long, later this length was increased to
39 feet and today it is being considered
to make the length 100 feet. In 1875
they weighed 50 or 60 pounds per yard;
rails being put in today weigh 152
pounds per yard and the majority of
rails now in use weigh more than 100
pounds per yard.
Safety is dollars saved—is bigger
loads—is bigger revenue per engine—is
more passengers per passenger car—is
progress. In 1912 the American Rail-
way Engineering Association reported
that average rail failures per 100 miles
of track for all mills were 28.9 for the
first year of service. In 20 years this
was cut down to 4.5 despite depression-
forced decreases in maintenance expend-
itures, faster and heavier loads. Safety
and progress and rails—statisticians are
right; the safest place in the world, this
side of the grave, thanks to the engin-
eers, is riding the rails.

PROFESSOR OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND IN CHARGE OF PLACEMENT
OF ELECTRICAL GRADUATES
A RAPID absorption of engineering
graduates has been going on for
months, with several types of place-
ment clearly discernible. Newcomers of
the 1935-36 classes graduated into the
upswing, and with normal completeness
have already found the various niches
commonly occupied by young engineers.
Men of the 1931-34 classes, after some
waiting in the average case, either found
engineering employment or stop-gap
jobs; and recently, a very rapid shift
from stop-gap to real employment has
taken place. Many of the boom-time
graduates of 1928-30 who were dropped,
and then found bread-and-butter make-
shifts, have also been called back to
engineering. And graduates of any year
before 1930 who went through the de-
pression without losing employment, are
now either getting their salaries restored
in some degree where they are, or are
being called by other employers.
If no new engineers ever appeared;
if no existing engineers ever got older,
or inconveniently died; and if employ-
ers never needed to hire men away from
each other—it is probable that the time
and pay cuts given to engineers in the
depression would be subject to a very
slow process of rectification. However,
the normal elements of supply and de-
mand are at last getting in their licks.
All this placement now going on, fol-
lowing a long period when salary stand-
ards were fairly well shot to pieces, is
raising in acute form the question,
What are the going rates for engineer
graduates? The writer does not know of
any firm (or individual) confident of
having the answer to that question. On
the other hand, it is definitely a fact
that many company officials are frankly
bewildered as to what their engineering
salary scales should look like today. It
is equally certain that any number of
engineers have very little to go on, in
trying to place a value on their own
services.
Actually, we are in a period of transi-
tion. What we need is a survey started
now, finished now, and made available
now. But comprehensive surveys take
time: and no one, as far as we know, is
making a survey now. In fact, the latest
figures on engineering incomes are for
December 31, 1934—and most of our
recovery has been made in the interven-
ing two years. Therefore, we must go
as far as we can with the materials at
hand. We can take a look at pre-depres-
sion figures, add in the depression
trends, then finish off with a personal
estimate of the present situation.
Begin with the salary survey of en-
gineering graduates as made in 1924 and
published in 1925, by the Society for
the Promotion of Engineering Educa-

tion. The findings, in part, are repro-
duced on the chart, curves A, B, and C.
The median curve B was checked with
good accuracy by the Eta Kappa Xu
survey for electrical engineers, and by
Beatty's survey of Carnegie Tech gradu-
ates, published in Industrial and En-
gineering Chemistry, 1931. The A.S.-
M.E. survey of 1930 earnings for me-
chanical engineers checks the median
curve B, except for showing higher
starting rates; this, no doubt, reflects
the effects of boom-time inflation on
recruiting competition for young gradu-
ates. In short, curve B seems to be the
soundest pre-depression median we have.
The terms median and average should
be clearly distinguished. In a salary
group of five men, let the salaries be
2,3, 4, 5, and 6 (thousands per year).
The median is 4 (there are as many
above as below 4); also, the average is
4. But salary distributions tend to be
more like 2, 3, 4, 7, 9; the median is
again 4, but the average is 5. However,
it should be noted that for some seven
or eight years after graduation, the ten-
dency of upper salaries to run away
with the show, is not pronounced; that
is, until the group is that far away from
graduation, the median and the average
are very close together.
As to depression trends, the work done
by Isador Lubin, Commissioner, Bureau
of Labor Statistics, gives a part of the
answer. His report (of very consider-
able interest to all engineers) is made,
in part, in the Journal of Engineering
Education (S.P.E.E.) November, 1936.
The part of his studies we will use
here pertains to graduates in C.E., E.E.,
and M.E., and their total yearly earn-
ings in certain years. The incomes we
show here are for those who are work-
ing for private firms and organizations

that the lumping together of the three
kinds of engineers is feasible, in that no
essential difference exists between the
several groups' average incomes.
The data are shown on the chart,
curves D, E, and F. Curve D has but
one point. Lubin has lumped the 1933
and 1934 classes, and gives the average
(not median) income, on December 31,
1934, as $1000.00. At that time, the
1933 class was l.S years out of school,
and the 1934 class, 0.5 years out. The
lumped average is therefore plotted as
being 1.0 years out of college.
Curve E gives the averages for the
classes of 1930, 1931, and 1932. The
incomes for the years 1932 and 1934
are given. Using the median class of
1931, the incomes are plotted as for
l.S and 3.5 years out of college. With
these two examples to go on, it should
be clear as to how the curve F, for the
five classes of 1925-29, was plotted.
It should at once be noted that the
only pre-depression point on any of the
DEF curves is for the 1929 incomes of
the pre-depression classes. Observe that,
in practical terms, this point falls on
curve B, the S.P.E.E. pre-depression
median. This is as it should be. It is
too soon after college, for the average of
Lubin's survey to pull much away from
the median of S.P.E.E. The coincidence
amounts to checking the one survey
against the other.
The DEF curves, when compared
against curve B, show that the engineer
joined the general population in taking
a terrific beating in the depression.
If a survey were at hand by which to
extend the DEF curves through to 1937,
it would unquestionably bend them
rather sharply upward. However, an in-
vestigation of the possibilities of the E
curve will teach us not to be too hopeful
about the steepness of salary standards
recovery. Suppose the E group has risen
from its December, 1934, mark, $1500.-
00, to a December, 1936, mark of
$3000.00. That would be a doubling of
income in two years, which is fast going.
Yet that is what would have to happen
in order to place this group, today, on
the pre-depression median. Well, such
a rate of recovery has not happened.
To repeat, we do not know what has
happened since 1934. But, from confer-
ences with some of the larger employers,
the writer makes the personal estimate
that the median of today is not more
than from 5 to 10 per cent below the

old B-curve median. Possibly G-curve
tells today's story as well as any. But
carefully note that this estimate largely
applies to men who have not changed
employers in recent years.
Speaking now of engineers who are in
the act of shifting from one employer to
another, the writer believes that employ-
ers are already having to pay in terms
of the ABC curves. That is, engineers
who have managed to come through
with a continuous record of achieve-
ment, and who have had the salutary
benefit of exposing themselves to com-
petitive influences, are today probably
selling their services at the pre-depres-
sion rates. In all this, the median, or
B-curve, should not be over-emphasized.
A high-grade man who has continued to
grow and assume responsibility will bar-
gain in terms of something like the A-
curve. At the other extreme, when an
employer is taking on a below-median
man who lost a year or two of exper-
ience around 1932, he may refuse to pay-
as much as the C-curve might seem to
call for.
Starting rates are of primary interest
to seniors. The pre-depression median,
S.P.E.E., was $1476.00. In 1936, it was
at $1300.00 or a little more. The writer
feels fairly sure of this figure, from hav-
ing watched the figures in the placement
work of one year ago. Competition for
young engineers is now very much more
pronounced than it was in the spring of
1936. It will not be surprising to find
this year's starting median to be be-
tween $1350.00 and 1400.00.
Salaries are being raised, slowly but
surely, either through direct payroll
boosting, or indirectly through bonuses
or other devices, or both. In view of
the general good outlook for business
and industry, engineers should expect a
general restoration of their incomes, to
the pre-depression curves, within a cou-
ple of years or less. Of course, anyone
may raise the question as to whether,
when a new stabilized period is reached,
engineering incomes should be above—
or below—pre-depression values. What
has happened to the dollar, and to the
cost of living, and so on? Well, in this
transition period, it would be a wise man
who could find the answers to such ques-
tions. Let us sharply remind ourselves
that several pre-depression surveys,
along with the Lubin studies, constitute
the only comprehensive information ever
gotten together about our incomes in
engineering. We are going to have to
do our salary-thinking in terms of such
data for some years to come.

To those who observe the trend of
industrial prime movers, the extraordin-
ary climb of Diesel power in the last
three years is no surprise. When one
considers that the Diesel extracts more
useful work from fuel than any other
type of engine, it is quite natural that
more effort would be expended to better
develop the Diesel. Efficiencies for sta-
tionary units are guaranteed 35% at the
generator terminals, from the heat of
the oil. The only power plant which can
even compare with the efficiences of the
Diesel are the Mercury Vapor plants.
Efficiencies of large central stations are
usually 20-25% ; small steam plants can
boast efficiencies of only 15-20%; loco-
motive steam units are only 7-8% effi-
cient. Thus it is easy to conceive how
the Union Pacific reduced the fuel cost
per trip across the continent from $300
to $83 for a standard train.
Novel applications of power have
claimed Diesels in large numbers and
so rapidly are new uses uncovered that
authorities expect this year's sales to
soar from 1,800,000 Hp. of last year to
a new high of 4,000,000 Hp. All the
more remarkable is this figure when one
considers that sales previous to 1933 had
never exceeded 450,000 Hp. This Diesel
peak is due, for the most part, to in-
stallations in trucks and tractors. Sales
to stationary power plants, however,
have kept pace. In fact, more horse-
power of Diesel went into stationary
plants last year than into all applica-
tions in 1928. The most salient feature
in Diesel sales had been the trend to-
wards smaller capacities and higher
speeds. Approximately 80% of all sta-
tionary Diesels sold were under 199
Hp., and 90% were under 900 Hp. in
size. Despite this fact, more engines of
over 1000 Hp. were purchased this year
than ever before.
Diesel progress, in the past, has been
hindered by vibration and exhaust gas
noises. However, more logical mount-
ing on cork and use of baffle mufflers
and silencers have reduced these to a
minimum. Moreover, cost has been re-
duced from $160 per Hp. after the war,
to $55 per Hp. at present, in sizes from
500 Hp. up. Also important is the com-
pact arrangement made possible by sav-
ing in weight and sizes of engines.
Though there is no definite need for
weight reductions in stationary units,
they have been reduced from 350
pounds per Hp. to about 150 pounds per
Hp. in a ten year period. During the
same period, certain mobile units have
been reduced from 25 pounds per Hp. to
about 10 pounds per Hp.
Wide use for Diesels are found as
electric generators in water and light
plants of private industries, hotels, util-
ity companies and municipalities. In-
stallations are proving to be a thorn in
the side of public utility companies
everywhere. Small towns where long
transmission from a central plant would
be required have found Diesels a perfect
solution to their problem. Moreover,
Diesels are more efficient than steam
engines at part load, and are just as
efficient in small sizes as in large.
Rather than expend large sums of
money to run steam plants on poor
feed water, many engineers have ad-
vised Diesels. A steam plant cannot
be located where a scarcity of water ex-
ists; a Diesel uses only a small amount
of water for cooling, and can use this
over and over again. Add to these the
elimination of standby losses, of warm-
ing up period and the possibility of
simple plant layout, and it is not hard
to understand why Diesel's sales have
progressed so rapidly.
The city of Windom, Minnesota, like
many other small towns employed a
steam plant for combined lighting and
heating. When their heat load increased
they found it uneconomical to add more
steam units. Therefore they added two
Diesel units to carry the balance of the
load that the steam plant could not
carry. In the summer when no heating
is required, the engine load falis on the
Diesels. Operation revealed that Diesels
effected a saving of 50% in generating
costs compared to steam operation in
this case. Innumerable cases have been
reported where Diesels have been in-
stalled for small intermittent operation,
and have produced electricity at less
than 50% of the purchase cost from
public utility companies. In cases where
the heat of the exhaust and jacket water
can be utilized in the winter, total effi-
ciencies have been found to run to 73%;
in the summer, this heat is dissipated
out of doors.
Despite all these seemingly inherent
advantages of the Diesel, it must be
emphasized that there are many times
when other types of prime movers are
more advantageous. Each particular
case must be considered separately, and
not generalized. Diesel executives warn
that over-enthusiasm could easily place
this remarkable engine in services where
results might prove disappointing.

High temperature creep test labo-
ratory, where the Department of En-
gineering Research carries on its develop-
ment work
Department of Engineering Research Develops a New Alloy
for High Temperature Service
by
C. L. CLARK
DEPT. OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH
THE present day trend in certain in-
dustries is towards the use of higher
temperatures and pressures. Even
though marked advances have been
made in this respect during the past
few years, there is a desire, especially
in the petroleum, steam-generating and
chemical industries, to resort to even
more severe conditions. While the use
of these higher temperatures and pres-
sures will either increase the efficiency
of the process or improve the resulting
product, their use can only be economic-
ally feasible when the advantages gained
are not offset by too great an increase
in the metal cost. It is thus the task of
the metallurgist to develop moderately
priced alloys which will meet these re-
quirements.
Since 1925. considerable work has
been done in the laboratories of the En-
gineering College by the Department of
Engineering Research in the develop-
ment of steels for high temperature ap-
plications. Certain of these alloys are
now finding wide commercial use and a
brief resume of the development of one
of them should be of interest in showing
how the composition, as well as the
name, was obtained.
When this work was started it was
commonly believed that all low-alloyed
steels possessed the same creep, or load
carrying ability, at temperatures in ex-
cess of 900 to 1000° F. Therefore if
temperatures greater than these were to
be encountered, recourse must be had to
the highly alloyed steels, either of the
ferritic or austenitic types. Since the
cost of steel increases with increasing
alloying content, and generally at a
more rapid rate than the increased cost
of the alloying element itself, it followed
that expensive steels must be used. This
tended to delay the use of higher tem-
peratures and pressures.
The work in our laboratories was
based on the belief that the above as-
sumptions were not necessarily correct
and that distinct advantages might be
gained even in low-alloyed steels
through the proper selection of the type
and amount of each alloy addition. In
order to determine this a series of 40
steels were made containing chromium,
silicon and tungsten with each element
being varied by 0.50 per cent increments
MARCH 1937
13


and tungsten were employed to improve
the strength characteristics, and the sili-
con and chromium to improve the oxida-
tion resistance.
These steels, each in five different
conditions of heat-treatment, were then
subjected to all of the various high tem-
perature tests including tensile, impact,
creep, oxidaiton and corrosion. Pro-
nounced differences were found to exist
between the various analyses and the
outstanding one contained 1.25 per cent
chromium, 1.0 per cent tungsten and 1.0
per cent silicon. This steel happened to
be the seventeenth one of the series and
was thus designated as Steel 17.
In the preliminary work all of the
steels contained 0.40 per cent carbon.
In order to make these steels more
adaptable for tube applications, the car-
bon content of the ten outstanding steels
was reduced to 0.10 per cent and the
tests repeated. These steels were desig-
nated by the letter I) and the outstand-
ing one was found to be 17 D-l. Later
the 17 was omitted and the steel desig-
nated as D-l.
In order to further decrease the cost
of this steel, the tungsten was replaced
by molybdenum, since it is known that
tungsten and molybdenum are inter-
changeable in the ratio of 2 to 1, and
the steel then became designated first
as D-1M and later as DM. Since all of
this work was sponsored by The Timken
Steel and Tube Company, this steel is
commercially known as Timken DM
and its present composition is 0.15 per
cent carbon, 0.75 per cent silicon, 1.25
per cent chromium, 0.50 per cent molyb-
denum.
At the present time the property usu-
ally employed for indicating a steel's
ability to withstand stress at elevated
temperatures is its creep characteristics.
The term creep may be defined as the
plastic deformation under a fixed load.
Available data indicates it to be one of
the most sensitive properties that a steel
possesses. It is therefore influenced to
a greater degree by slight changes in
the past history of the metal than any
of the more common physical properties.
In other words, composition and heat-
treatment establishes the room tempera-
ture properties rather closely. Yet two
steels, possessing the same composition
and heat-treatment, may possess greatly
different creep characteristics at elevated
temperatures.
For this reason, the determination of
the most suitable composition did not
complete the development work on the
DM analysis. The influence of many
other factors on the high temperature
characteristics had to be determined and
among those considered were method of
manufacture, casting practice, grain size
(both actual and inherent), and the
effect of prolonged heating under stress
on the resulting physical properties and
microstructures. In this last phase of
the work, tests of 20,000 hours' dura-
tion were considered.
In high temperature applications it is
also advisable to know the fracture
characteristics of the material under the
given operating conditions. In many
instances the life of the part is based
upon a definite plastic deformation. Cer-
tain alloys show little ductility up to
fracture under the more prolonged heat-
ing times and thus are apt to fail with-
out warning. Accordingly the influence
of time, temperature and stress on the
fracture of the DM steel had also to be
investigated.
The DM steel is now finding very
wide use especially for tubing in oil
cracking stills and in superheaters. It
possesses very good creep characteristics
and has a high degree of structural sta-
bility under the combined action of tem-
perature, stress and time. In general,
however, it may be stated that relatively
large alloy content is necessary for a
high degree of oxidation or corrosion
resistance. The use of these lower
alloyed steels is therefore confined to
applications in which the oxidizing or
corroding conditions are not severe.
Their use, however, can be further ex-
tended to include these more severe con-
ditions if their surface is protected by a
material having a high resistance to oxi-
dation or corrosion, such as Calorizing.
In these cases, the low alloyed steel pro-
vides the strength and the Calorized
layer the surface stability.
FRESHMAN SCHOLASTICS AND
POTENTIAL DIPLOMAS
Several years ago the Department of
Mechanism and Drawing instigated
some interesting researches on freshman
grades and their correlation to subse-
quent scholastic achievement in college.
As a start, the students were segregated
into three groups, high, average, and
low, depending upon their honor point
averages at the end of the first semester,
freshman year. These groups were then
watched in their progress through their
respective college careers; this was done
in order to enable the department to
answer these five questions: (1) What
is the degree of correlation between the
first semester achievement index em-
ployed as the basis for classification and
segregation and the achievements of the
full four years? (2) What happens to
our superior students? (3) How many
years are required by the average and
poor students to finish the four year re-
quirements? (4) What is the trend of
the quality of the work of all students
as they proceed through college? (5)
What is the effect, if any, on high stu-
dents of the practice of teaching them in
classes with average and low students?
(descriptive geometry was the only
course where students were regularly
segregated).
Question one was answered at the end
of the four year period with the infor-
mation that first semester grades are al-
most identical with total four year aver-
ages; in a word, if you don't snap out
of it in your freshman year you prob-
ably never will—probably. There is al-
ways a chance for that strong individual
to kick precedent for a goal. And there
is no worry about the high group; 73'/&lt;
of that group graduated as compared to
129? of the low group. The average and
low groups were found to be spending
somewhat more than four years to com-
plete the required curriculum; 259f of
the average group took five years to
graduate as did 69c of the low group.
This latter group had 80'v who never
did receive a diploma. Scholastic trends
show the high group to be losing ground
scholastically while the lower groups
kept hammering away and improved
their grades somewhat. The effect, then,
of not segregating the students is to
take away the pacemakers for the higher
groups as they are placed in classes con-
taining the lower groups and are apt to
become over-confident (an over-used
word, perhaps, but statistically authen-
ticated in this instance). The lower
scholastic groups are always subject to
competition and as a consequence of this
their averages are rising slightly over a
four-year period.

A CHURNING flood had taken out the telephone line across a Colorado stream.
Repairmen couldn't wade it because of quicksand—couldn't cross elsewhere and
bring back the line because of obstructions.
Then Kayo's master had an idea. He went upstream, crossed, came back and whistled.
Kayo jumped in—swam across with a cord tied to his collar. With this cord, the wire
was soon pulled over—communication was restored.
A small incident. But it typifies the ingenuity which helps Bell System men and

AIRPLANES AND COST
ACCOUNTING
During the last year many of the
larger airlines have been taking advan-
tage of this fact by putting into service
planes of a much larger type, the Doug-
las DC3 with a seating capacity of
twenty-four. Making a graphical analy-
sis of costs for this plane, we find, as we
might expect, that the costs vary in
much the same way as they did for the
Boeing 247D, but are much lower
throughout. By use of these and larger
ships, the aircraft companies are in
hopes of definitely emerging into a per-
iod of prosperity.
On the west coast at present, the first
of a line of forty passenger planes is
being built. The four largest airlines in
the country are cooperating in backing
up the work of design and experimental
work on this plane and promise great
things for it when it is done.
March 20th of this year will be the
tenth anniversary of Lindbergh "s flight
from New York to Paris. More impor-
tant to us, however, than the great
flights of Lindbergh and the other in-
trepid aviators of that period, is the fact
that the first regular commercial flying
of passengers in this country was under-
taken in 1927 by The Colonial Airways.
Since that early beginning, the natonal
airways system has expanded with ex-
treme rapidity, reaching a grand total
last year of nearly 500,000,000 passen-
ger miles. Now that airline activities
have achieved the distinction of the
name big business, it is fitting that we
should review their past, present and
future, and see how successful they have
been in a financial sense, and what their
future will be.
At first, the airlines operating were
subsidized very largely by the govern-
ment airmail contracts and nearly sev-
enty per cent of their total revenues
were derived from this source. However
as the passenger and express business of
the various companies expanded, the im-
portance of the mail contracts decreased
rapidly, until with the cancellation of
all domestic airmail contracts in 1934,
and their renewal at much lower rates,
the revenue which was derived in this
manner decreased to less than one-third
of total revnues.
In spite of the fact that the business
has expanded so rapidly and revenues
have increased apace, very few compan-
ies have made money consistently.
Technological advancement has been so
rapid, that the average modern trans-
port airplane becomes obsolete in a per-
iod of three to four years. With ten and
twelve passenger airplanes costing from
sixty to ninety thousand dollars, the de-
preciation write off must therefore be
very great.

and operating costs, which was recently

UILU0NS OF MILES FLOVtN
made we are able to derive some very
pertinent figures.
Although at first, the airlines were
able to charge high prices when carrying
passengers, due to the novelty of flight,
they must now compete with other
modes of transportation and the fares
have come down as a result. The aver-
age rate in this country today is S.057 a
passenger mile.
Now let us look at the other side of
the picture and see what costs are in-
curred by the company in carrying pas-
sengers. These costs are twofold. The
direct costs, or costs of maintenance and
flight of the aircraft, include such items
as crew expenses, gas and oil, deprecia-
tion, maintenance and insurance. These
direct costs vary more or less directly
with the mileage flown. The second
group, the fixed costs, include such items
as publicity, radio, sales, and landing
field expenses. These may all be classi-
fied as overhead and vary very little
once the airline is established.
Using figures derived from the records
of one of the larger operating companies,
we have drawn a graph of the total cost
of aircraft transportation per passenger
mile versus the total number of passen-
ger miles flown per year. The figures
used are those for the Boeing 247 D, a
ten place bi-motor plance which has
been used for the last few years. Costs
are reckoned on the basis of sixty per
cent of the seats being filled, a very
close approximation to actual condi-
tions.
As can be seen by the graph, the cost
per passenger mile decreases along a
hyperbolic arc asymptotic to the x-axis.
The reason for this becomes quite
apparent when we consider that the
fixed costs per mile become smaller in-
crements as the total mileage goes up.
However, even as the mileage goes up
the costs do not go down sufficiently to
be covered completely by the revenues
derived from passenger traffic. The
added revenues from mail and express
tonnage carried help out, but the air-
lines have not yet passed the ragged edge
into the black.
A study of the itemized costs of flight
show one of the largest items involved
to be that of crew costs. As the crew
salary remains about the same regard-
less of the size of the ship flown, it is

Vitalizing Oil Wells
VIA


SO VITAL is petroleum in our highly mechanistic
a&gt;;e. that it might be said a nation's sword of
Damocles is no longer suspended by a thread but
by a drop of oil.
Since the days of Colonel Drake who gave America its
first commercial oil well in 1859, the discovery and
production of petroleum has constituted one of the
most vivid chapters in our national development.
Millions of barrels have flowed from the earth's depths
in close to one-half of our states—and there is little
question that this abundant resource has literally
oiled the wheels of American progress.
But, despite our apparently bountiful supply, both
known and yet to be discovered, the need for more
efficient and conservative production of petroleum
has been long regarded as essential.
A sizable stride in this direction was taken when, five
years ago. Dow brought to the oil-producing industry
through its subsidiary, Dowell Incorporated, a
specialized chemical service for oil wells.
Whereas formerly, through natural and mechanical
means, oil producers extracted approximately twenty
per cent of the potential petroleum accumulation, by
putting chemistry to work they stepped recovery up
to double, and even triple this amount.
Stripped of technicalities, Dowell undertakes through
special acids and chemicals to overcome natural
barriers to greater oil production in areas where oil
is produced from limestone or dolomitic formations.
To render this service, Dowell maintains headquarters
at Tulsa, Oklahoma, and a complete field organization
located in the principal oil fields.
To date it has treated over 9,000 wells, resulting in
approximately $50,000,000 gain to the oil industry.
In servicing these wells, Dowell trucks and cars have
traveled 4,500.000 miles and its treating engineers
have handled over 15,000,000 gallons of special acid.
Thus. Dow research and chemical application reaches
out into another channel of usefulness—promoting
and developing the value of a great national resource.

PROFESSION
KETTERING ON EXPRESSION
We have often heard students in en-
gineering at this university ask: Why
am I required to take English? What
good is English to an Engineer? These
questions have been very well answered
by C. F. Kettering of the General Mot-
ors Corporation who writes in The Jour-
nal of Engineering Education: "Success
in engineering and research depends as
much upon the ability to present an idea
convincingly as it does upon the ability
to perform calculations or experiments.
... It is only by speech and wrting that
the discoveries made in the laboratories
are made useful. Scientific men too
often look upon writing reports or mak-
ing talks as an irksome part of their
job and do as little of it as possible. En-
gineering work is not finished until the
results are clearly recorded and pre-
sented to others."

DIESEL EXPERT COMES TO M.E.
DEPARTMENT FACULTY
Once more the Engineering College
has demonstrated its desire to keep up
with the Industrial World by bringing
to the Mechanical Engineering Depart-
ment, a man who has been outstanding
in his field. Our new Professor Edward
T. Vincent has come to us from the
Diesel Engineering Division of Contin-
ental Motors Corporation as an author-
ity on Diesel engines. Upon completion
of a four-year engineering course in
Britain's Dockyard at Chatham, he was
awarded admiralty prizes for heading
of an accusation that science labours
'to kill and put down noble life." He
said: "When science gave man the ca-
pacity of tlight he was not required to
use it to bomb and burn and poison. In
showing men how to develop processes
of production science did not make the
bad conditions of industrial areas a nec-
essary consequence. Mankind might
conceivably have been spared the hor-
rors of poison gas and slums, but he
might have been left a savage. On bal-
ance, life has been made immeasurably
easier and richer and whether discover-
ies are used for good or for evil depends
upon the results of ethical and spiritual
teaching."
A CONTRAST IN FUEL PROBLEMS
Synthetic motor fuel in the United
States may seem a long way off with
gasoline selling at less than five cents
per gallon at mid-western refineries.
Xevertheless synthetic motor fuels are
here on a large scale. In this country
our problem is to modify much of our
natural motor fuel and to supplement it
by synthetic hydrocarbons to meet the

the students of all His Majesty's naval
establishments. He completed a two-
year advanced course in Mechanical
Engineering at Gillingham Technical
Institute and took a Bachelor of Science
degree with honors at London Univer-
sity. Among Professor Vincent's awards
have been the Whitworth Scholarship
and the Tyndall prize (physics) of the
Royal College of Science in London. He
has since worked with Messrs. W.
Beardmore &amp; Co. in Glasgow, Emsco
Aero Engine Co. in Los Angeles, Con-
tinental Motors Corporation and the
General Electric Co. of London.
increasingly exacting requirements of
high anti-knock engines, particularly
aviation motors. We are rapidly devel-
oping a considerable production by so-
called polymerization or coupling up
certain gaseous hydrocarbons to gaso-
line. This synthetic gasoline has high
anti-knock value and is far superior to
synthetic motor fuels produced from
other sources, as from coal.
In Europe the problem is to provide
motor fuel of any kind under the restric-
tions that would be imposed by war. In
Germany current developments indicate
a synthetic production nearly sufficient
for the national need.

SPOTLIGHT

Bob Dailey
SALESMAN
MICHIGAN men have long ex-
tolled in song and ballad the
beauty and virtues of the Ypsi gals—
without a word
about the men.
We propose to
correct an obvi-
ous slight and
injustice by pre-
senting a native
of the Normal
city—Robert G.
Dailey — vice-
president of the
Michigan Union,
from the Engi-
neering College.
Bob seems to have grown up in an
engineering atmosphere. The son of a
civil engineer, his early desires to tinker
with things mechanical were satisfied
by model steam engines and a little
later, a model T Ford. After graduation
from high school Bob had occasion to
travel to California as a driver in a
fleet of new cars. While in California
he attended San Diego Teachers Col-
lege for one semester, after which he
came to Michigan.
Dailey's engineering interest lies in
sales, his numerous campus activities
fitting him ideally for this type of work.
Bob first stepped into the spotlight
when he did a fine job in handling the
publicity for the Union Opera of '35.
As a result of this and other Union ac-
tivities he was appointed to the junior
executive council of the Union, during
his junior year, and became Union Vice-
President in his senior year.
In a recent encounter with a hard-
boiled recruiter from one of the larger
industrial concerns it is rumored that
Bob was forced to put into use all the
tact and diplomacy he had acquired.
The story goes that Bobs amorous in-
tentions were abruptly squelched by a
"no-marriage" clause in the company's
training program.
Dailey has worked for part of his ex-
penses every semester since entering
Michigan, and is at present employed

in the Union library. Mimes and Tri-
angles honor societies have claimed him
and he is also a member of Psi Upsilon
fraternity.
BUSY MAN
CERDRIC (two R's please) E.
Marsh is a busy man. However,
we know why he is a busy man. Cerd
has always been a willing worker in
whatever organizations and endeavors
he has been interested, and he has been
interested in many.
Born in River Forest, Illinois, he
changed his resi-
dence at a tender
age to Oak Park,
Illinois, where he
grew unto man's
estate. Then,
packed he up his
grip and off to
Michigan.
Soon he was
hard at work,
preparing himself
for a degree in
Chemical Engi-
neering and specializing to some extent
in organic chemistry. But schoolwork
was not the only thing in young Cerd-
ric's head. He was soon associated with
the staff of the Union and worked on
that staff for two years. As a freshman,
he joined the Stump Speakers' Society,
and has progressed far in that organiza-
tion. He is at present, program chair-
man and representative on the Engi-
neering Council, for that organization.
He has also received the honorary title
of Associate Member, in Sigma Rho
Tau.
Cerd left school for one semester to
work for Consumer's Power Company,
but returned to school the following
year. Evidently, being away from
school did not hurt him, as, on his re-
turn, his marks were good enough to
warrant his election to Tau Beta Pi and
Phi Lambda Upsilon. An active mem-
ber of A. I. Ch. E. and a newly elected
member of Vulcans, Cerd has had his
full share of extra curricular activities.
Cerd Marsh
But that isn't all! Cerd has also been
in the thick of things socially. He is a
member of Sigma Phi Fraternity. This
year he was ticket chairman for the En-
gineering Ball, and we hear rumors that
he will have quite a bit to do with the
Senior Ball too.
Yes, Cerdric E. Marsh is a busy man.
B. M. U. A.
IN OUR search for B. M. U. A.'s (big
men under the arch) we occasionally
come across a man of outstanding mod-
esty. Such a man is Richard H. Berry-
man. After much tactful interviewing
we finaly got him to admit that he was
born in Painesdale, in the upper penin-
sula of Michigan. His family and he
moved to Detroit when he was five
years old and his home has been there
since.
Whether his northern birth-place had
anything to do with it we do not know,
but when Dick attended Cass Technical
High School in Detroit he tried out suc-
cessfully for the school hockey team.
Continuing to excell on the ice after he
entered Michigan, Dick has been on the
Varsity hockey team for three years.
However, hockey was not his only ath-
letic endeavor: he earned his freshman
numerals playing baseball. Although
he has not played any serious baseball
on the campus during the last few years,
we have it from the people who know
that Dick swings a mean bat during
the summer months.
Dick is taking a course in Mechanical
Engineering and is specializing in Heat-
ing and Ventilat-
ing. His sincere
interest in, and
attention to, his
engineering stud-
ies have caused
Dick to drop out
of inter-collegiate
hockey competi-
tion. To quote
Dick: "As I grow
older my engi-
neering education
iscomingtomean
more to me than athletics, and I want
to make the grade."
A hard worker and a good one, Berry-
man has been recognized by several
campus honor societies and with his in-
herent sincerity of purpose he should
have no difficulty in receiving further
recognition in the engineering world.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The staff of the Automotive Division of the Mechanical Engineering
Laboratories at the University of Michigan were among the first to attempt
to correlate the results of wind tunnel tests of models with the performance
of the corresponding actual cars on the road. Methods of correcting or com-
pensating for the ground effect in the wind tunnel tests were studied. The
results of this work were very helpful to the automotive industry in indicat-
ing design changes which could be readily made which would materially
reduce the wind resistance of their product.
The facilities used in these researches should lend themselves to the
study of many other problems. Contact the Director of the Department of
Engineering Research if you have a problem on which these or other facilities
might be used.

CONDITIONING

was from $1.54 to $2.16 per day, as
compared with the figure of $0.83 to
$1.17 for electrical operation. These
figures of course would vary consider-
ably depending upon the local prices of
ice, electricity, and water. The electric
rate is lower than the average residence
rates throughout the country but the
water rate is probably higher. The cost
of ice is believed to be a fairly repre-
sentative figure. With this difference in
operating cost in favor of electricity,
plus an appreciably greater degree of
convenience, one can understand why
the present trend is toward the use of
electricity in spite of its somewhat
higher initial investment cost.

Is the cost of residence cooling, as il-
lustrated by the1 foregoing figures, to be
considered as high? When we say that
the cost of something is too high we
usually mean either that we do not want
that thing as much as we want some
other thing which the same number of
dollars will buy, or that we believe that
the same thing or its equivalent should
be purchasable for fewer dollars.
Whether or not American home owners
in large numbers will want artificial
cooling more than they want something
else is difficult to predict. It will depend
in a large measure upon the success of
the sellers of equipment in instilling the
desire and the pride of ownership in the
face of competition for the home own-
er's dollar.
If the cost figures reported herewith
are representative, it will probably be
agreed that it is the first cost of the
apparatus rather than the operating cost
that is the more serious item. Therefore
if the equipment cost can be lowered
either through increased production or
by simplified design we may expect a
corresponding broadening of the field of
summer cooling. There is also the pos-
sibility of some radically different
method being developed, but what it
might be is not as yet clearly visualized.
The Attic Fan
Another way to obtain a large meas-
ure of summer comfort at a much lower
cost than by artificial cooling is by the
use of an attic fan to reduce the tem-
perature—particularly the temperature
in the bedrooms—of a summer night.
In Michigan and in many other regions
the outdoor temperature almost invar-
iably shows a marked drop in the eve-
ning. If one should move one's bed out
on the lawn it would be downright cold.
But inside the house—particularly on
the second floor—the heat of the day
still remains, and there is usually insuf-
ficient breeze to bring in the cooler out-
door air.
The attic fan has the effect of a stiff
breeze. Placed in the attic it creates a
strong suction in the house, pulling co-
pious drafts of air through the open bed-
room windows. If first-floor windows
are also left slightly open it helps to
cool the downstairs and thus gives those
rooms a handicap against the next day's
rising temperature. If the fan is large
enough, the bedroom temperature falls
at almost the same rate as the outside
temperature as the accompanying
graphs, taken from an actual test, indi-
cate. A time clock which shuts down
the fan at midnight or thereabouts is
an inexpensive and economical adjunct.
There are two important requirements
for an attic fan. It must be of ample
air-handling capacity and it must be ex-
tremely quiet. The capacity should be
such as to renew the air volume of all
of the bedrooms in not more than two
and one-half minutes or better in two
minutes. This is sufficient to make (he
window curtains blow in, as in a good
breeze, and creates a noticeable air
movement through the room. Quietness
of operation is an obvious requirement
for anything that must operate while
the world is trying to sleep.
What price night cooling with an
attic fan? The newer types are de-
signed to be simply placed on their own
supports near an attic window, with a
simple duct connected to the window
frame. A complete set-up can be made
for $150 for a three bedroom house.
The operating cost on several installa-
tions in Detroit averaged about $4.00
per season. The attic fan gives a good
return in comfort on the invested dol-
lars, and some people believe that it will
find more universal adoption in many
parts of the country than the more ex-
pensive though more thorough systems
of artificial cooling.

OKONITE insulation with an unsurpassed record
since 1878 is still generally recognized as the
acme of perfection for rubber insulations and as
"the best product possible" of its type.
The Okonite Company and its affiliates, how-
ever, have constantly kept step with the ad-
vances of the electric art.
Whether the wire or cable is large or small,
single or multiple conductor, high or low volt-
age, whether finished with a rubber or a syn-
thetic compound jacket, braid, lead sheath or
armor of any type, Okonite can make it.
In all cases, whether the correct solution calls
for rubber, impregnated paper, varnished cam-
bric, asbestos, glass or the newer synthetic
compounds, the policy still is and will continue
to be the best product possible.

View of Camp Davit, the University's surveying camp, and the Valley of Hoback River
The instruction given at Camp Davis is similar to that offered at the
camps of the leading colleges of engineering of the United States. The camp
is situated in the Jackson Hole area about 75 miles south of the Yellowstone
Park. A road connecting the Lincoln Highway at Rock Springs, Wyoming,
with the Yellowstone Park, traverses the valley of the Hoback River in which
the camp is located. A splendid climate with clear days and cool nights, a
considerable area near the camp clear of trees and brush, and a topography
varying from gentle slopes to rugged mountains, combine to make this region
an ideal one for giving instruction in surveying.
Students and faculty are housed comfortably in permanent buildings
provided with running water, electric lights and a modern sanitary system.
The mess furnishes excellent meals.
The work is arranged for a three-day trip to Yellowstone National Park,
as well as for week-end trips to nearer points of interest. The cost for the
eight weeks session varies between $125 and $1 50, depending somewhat on
the interest students may have in economics.

ICE WATER
New electric drinking-water coolers introduced
by General Electric have replaced the antiquated
ice-cooled type on several prominent Midwestern
railroads. This is another step in the modernization
program being carried on by railroads to increase
passenger traffic.
The new coolers are designed to overcome many
disadvantages of the ice-cooled units. With foot
operation of the self-contained units, only one
hand need be used to get a drink. Cleanliness is
promoted because of the absence of ice-filling
operations, and the expense for maintenance and
service is reduced to a minimum.
The water is automatically maintained at a
healthful and refresliing temperature through ther-
mostatic control. Coolers are designed either as
self-contained units or as separate cooling and
refrigerant condensing units for remote installations
in the car.

AS VACUUM TUBES GREW UP
As the vacuum tubes grew, they found their style
cramped because metal could be sealed to glass
only in thin strips. Research took up the problem,
and it is now possible to fabricate glass and metal
together, in any size or shape, very much as two
metals are fabricated.
In a successful glass-to-metal seal, the tempera-
ture coefficients of expansion of the glass and the
metal must agree exactly over a wide range of
temperature. Painstaking investigation—much of
it in the General Electric Research Laboratory,
at Schenectady—developed new alloys and new
glasses, which could be used for this application.
The first application of this new knowledge has
been in metal radio tubes, now standard in almost
all radio receivers. Power thyratrons, switches,
capacitor bushings—all these follow along the new
trail. We cannot predict how far this new technique
will go, but the possibilities are numerous and
inviting.

TURBINE STEEL CREEPS
If the wrong kind of steels were used in turbine
construction, the machine would not go creeping
across the floor with the operator in hot pursuit,
but the results might be even more disastrous.
Part of the increase in efficiency that has come
about in the power-generating field in the last few
vears has been due to increased steam temperatures
and pressures. As a result, the modern turbine
shell runs, almost literally, red hot. This shell must
withstand pressures such as exist half a mile down
in the ocean and must keep a 20-ton rotor spinning
perfectly in line. Heat softens metal, just as it
softens candy, and permits it to stretch. This
stretch, however, must be kept to the merest creep—
about one part in 1000, if the changes are uniform.
In the Schenectady Works turbine shop, auto-
matic electric furnaces hold samples of turbine
steel at the temperature which will occur in the
turbine. Gauges, which indicate changes of one part
in a million, measure the creep as the pieces are
exposed to heat for years at a time. From these tests,
the best steel is selected.
It has been largely due to this research carried
on by General Electric that the temperature and
pressure of steam used in power generation have been
raised to unexpected highs in the last few years.

Welding aids modern metallurgy to produce completely
corrosion-proof assemblies
EQUIPMENT is subject to corrosive
attack and consequent deteriora-
tion by three forces: chemical attack, elec-
trolysis and erosion. Chemically active
gases, liquids, pastes, or solids eat away
the more easily attacked portion. Dissimi-
lar metals often set up galvanic currents,
which cause pitting and corrosion. High-
velocity steam or solid particles in a slurry
add mechanical abrasion to the ravages
of chemical and galvanic attack.
Welding Prevents Deterioration
Welding is a valuable aid to users and
fabricators of equipment for corrosive ser-
vice. By welding, equipment can be made
smooth, jointless—one-piece. Valves and
necessary fittings can be faced with cor-
rosion-resistant metal welded in place.
Chemical attack can be further prevented
by making welds of material similar to
the body metal.
Welded assemblies present a smooth,
unbroken internal surface. No pockets
are formed in which concentration and
consequent deterioration can occur.
Galvanic attack, which occurs with
other types of assembly, ceases to be a
factor in welded equipment. In a welded
assembly, the same or similar metals are
fused together. Perfect electrical contact
prevents the damage due to galvanic ac-
tion. Abrasion by steam, water, or solids
is prevented by welding on hard alloys at
constrictions and bends.
Welding Stops Corrosion Losses
Abrasion, chemical attack, electrolysis,
are defeated on a thousand fronts by
welding. New equipment, designed to
resist corrosive conditions and fabricated
by welding to assure satisfactory perform-
ance, is achieving enviable records in ser-
vice. Equipment which would otherwise
be scrapped is renovated and protected
against further deterioration. Many cor-
rosion problems, localized in extent, are
conquered through the application of re-
sistant materials to the affected parts by
welding.
As a result of the successful applica-
tion of welding to check corrosion losses,
industry is saving money. Repair and re-
placement bills are cut. New machinery
and supplies have a longer life, and thus
amortization charges are lowered. Less
valuable production time is lost through
shutdown and accident.
A few of the many ways by which weld-
ing checkmates corrosion, selected from
actual case histories, appear in the column
at the right. These and many other similar
welding applications may be utilized in
your future business.

THIS ALLWELDED KITCHEN UNIT includes sink, dishwasher, drainboard, working
spare, and closets. It is made of stainless steel, welded into a jointless unit which is strong,
easy to clean, and resistant to corrosion. Many of the utensils also are of stainless steel.

In the textile industry, stainless steel is used
for dye-vats, tanks, buckets, dippers, and many
other purposes. The equipment, welded
throughout, resists chemical action, is smooth
inside and therefore easily cleaned, and is
strong and durable.

Wear by sandy water had pitted the surfaces
of two 42-inch diameter balance needle valves
so seriously that the valves would no longer
operate efficiently. Twenty-two hours of weld-
ing saved these expensive semi-steel castings,
which otherwise would have been scrapped.

In redesigning several 700-gallon tanks for
food storage, it was necessary to eliminate an
unsanitary and corrosion-ridden condition. The
tanks were redesigned to be made from stain-
less steel with welded joints. The inside and
outside are now permanently free from unde-
sirable laps where germs might lodge or corro-
sion might start.
* * *
Sea water had seriously corroded the impel-
lers of cargo pumps on an oil tanker. Five hours
of welding repaired this damage at a fraction of
the cost of new parts. Resistant metal used for
the repair will prevent recurrence of trouble.

Welded piping in the floor of a skating rink
successfully resists severe corrosion in addition
to mechanical stress. No mechanical joint could
withstand this service. The piping carries alter-
nately refrigerating brine for freezing the skat-
ing surface and steam for melting it.
* * *
Milk storage tanks for a chocolate manufac-
turer were welded to prevent corrosion and un-
sanitary conditions. These tanks were fabricated
entirely of stainless steel. They were welded to
prevent corrosion at the seams as well as off-
taste in the milk. The smooth, flush, inside sur-
face left no pockets for chemical and bacterial
action to produce spoilage.
* * *
A container for caustic soda solutions, made
of Monel metal to resist corrosion, had a cast
iron plug in the base. Corrosion troubles were
imminent. By welding this and all other joints,
corrosion was successfully prevented.

Tomorrow' s engineers will be expected
to know how to take advantage of this
modern metalworking process. Many
valuable booklets describing the oxy-
acetylene process are available without
obligation. For further information write

The results of the TECHNICS questionnaire show that the magazine
is conforming more closely to the desires of the readers. This was
proven by a steady increase in reader approval, March leading with well
over 3.2. This month the TECHNIC is continuing its work on the
ever interesting job problem with Philip A. Singleton's article on Sales
Engineering, this being the first of a series of two. Robert L. Taylor,
36E and assistant editor of CHEMICAL AND METALLURGICAL ENCI-
NEERING offers the senior engineer many pertinent points in his article
"To Seniors With Jobs." Professor A. D. Moore's Commentaries (score,
high as usual in the balloting) this month are concerned with proper
office behaviour for the young engineer.
The May issue will bring to a close the current publication year;
the largest issue in several years is being planned. Featured will be
material from the United States Department of Labor Statistics on the
present employment position of engineers in view of age, years after
graduation, and field of specialization.

SCIENCE ENTERS PERSONNEL
RELATIONS
THE PROFESSIONAL aspects of
engineering have a definite evolu-
tionary character. Whether or not the
recently graduated engineer realizes it
while bending over a drawing board,
progress for him will be manifested in
the constantly increased assumption of
responsibility. Today, the engineer,
regardless of his department on Com-
mencement Day, is a potential execu-
tive. True, some engineers never get
beyond the drawing room, but those
who do, do so because of their willing-
ness and ability to accept responsibility.
Responsibility naturally entails the di-
rection of activities of other men; it de-
mands knowledge of personnel man-
agement.
Acquiring this sense of personnel re-
lations is necessarily an empirical pro-
cedure; Engineering Colleges offer little
in their curricula that educates the stu-
dent engineer in the handling of men.
Nevertheless, the management of men,
which so often falls to the progressing
engineer, is a scientific problem and is
best solved by the application of the
scientific method to the human problems
involved. Engineers in industry who
have been given the problem of per-
sonnel management have, for the most
part, set up a system of employee rela-
tions that is inherently the product of
engineering training. Facts are col-
lected and used to prevent the personnel
difficulties from arising. The systems
are preventive in nature, engineers are
prone to design a bridge against failure
rather than with the idea of repairing it
after failure. Data is obtained concern-
ing the applicants before actual employ-
ment, thus men who are basically un-
suited for the positions open are never
hired. Physical examinations and health
procedures are maintained to prevent
the spreading of disease and to increase
worker efficiency.
Engineer-personnel managers have


found that personnel work, systemati-
cally planned and consummated, is a
straight business proposition; it is not a
paternalistic or philanthropic phase of
management (although these aspects are
always coincident with good employee
relations), but pays its own way. Per-
sonnel costs become great when a large
turnover in employees results from un-
satisfactory working conditions. Cost of
labor turnover per man runs from $8.50
per man on unskilled labor to $250 on
skilled workers.
Most personnel systems that are in
successful operations have broken the
problem down into parts which are read-
ily analysed and handled. Two main
divisions are immediately obvious and
are of convenient size for intelligent
control. These are the selection of em-
ployees for one and the maintenance of
employees for the other, ft can go with-
out saying that the effective selection of
employees must be the foundation for a
good personnel structure. Here, again,
the application of the scientific method,
Electrical Engineering
the method we unconsciously assim-
ilated in four years of college, can aid
the young engineer given his first per-
sonnel responsibility.
From an intelligent selection of em-
ployees, the scientific method moves
on to adequate maintenance of its work-
ers. Every successful system has a
highly individualistic basis in that each
man has a detailed history which serves
as an indicator or gage of his chances
for promotion or dismissal. Elaboration
of maintenance includes pensions, dis-
missal wages, group insurance, and ade-
quate employee representation.
That intelligent personnel control is a
paying proposition is exemplified by the
case of the large steel corporation which
netted a book profit of 17,000 dollars
through its employee-relation activities.
The field is there; and the engineer with
his long training in the use of the scien-
tific method is best equipped to succeed
when given the knotty problem of hu-
man relations.

MALCOLM H. SOULE. Sc.D., LL.D.
PROFESSOR OF BACTERIOLOGY
AND DIRECTOR OF THE HYGIENIC LABORATORY
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
* Continuous rum distillation.
FEW of those who were thrilled last
season by the cinema production,
"The Life of Pasteur," were aware of
the fact that the spectacular and roman-
tic fight against disease featured in the
film was merely an incident in a life
crowded with discovery. Bacteria were
seen for the first time in 1676 by An-
tony von Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch janitor
of Delft. Employing methods which he
never revealed, Leeuwenhoek ground
tiny bits of glass into the shape of lenses
and subsequently mounted them singly
between strips of metal to make simple
microscopes. With these instruments,
which remain the envy of modern ar-
tisans, he amused himself examining all
sorts of things—from the mud in stag-
nant pools to the debris which gathered
about his teeth. On one occasion he
turned toward discovering, if possible,
the cause of the hotness of pepper.
Whole pepper-corns were placed in
"melted snow" and at the end of three
weeks a droplet of the water was
searched and to his great surprise the
liquid was teeming with tiny animals
smaller than red blood corpuscles. The
descriptions and drawings of what he
saw are such that scientists unite in call-
ing Leeuwenhoek the "Father of Mi-
crobiology." However, so keen was he
in the art of lens grinding and so jealous
was he of his technique, confirmation of
his observations by others had to await
improvements in instruments of magnifi-
cation; consequently, a hundred and
fifty years elapsed before any real prog-
ress was made in an understanding of
what bacteria are or what they do.
It was Pasteur who finally made the
scientific world conscious of the exist-
ence of Leeuwenhoek's little animals. If
we return to the middle of the past
century we find Pasteur (in his early
thirties) telling the Chemical Society of
Paris about his studies concerning the
development of the green mold, Penicil-
lium glaucum, on para-tartaric acid;
and, as a result of the value of these
experiments relating to the separation
of racemic mixtures by means of living
organisms, Pasteur established his emi-
nency in the fields of physical and chem-
ical research.
In 1857, Pasteur found the souring of
milk to be accompanied by the multipli-
cation of minute globules which were
much smaller than the yeasts in beer;
when the tiny bodies taken from the
ordinary sour milk were added to sweet
milk they rapidly multiplied and their
accumulation coincided with the appear-
ance of lactic acid. Pasteur pronounced
these living forms to be special lactic
acid yeasts responsible for the change in
the milk. The following year he de-
tected small but definite amounts of suc-
cinic acid and glycerol in alcoholic fer-
mentation, the importance of which will
be referred to later.
At the time of our Civil War, the
French were justly complaining about
their wine; some samples were bitter,
others ropy, others sour. The services
of Pasteur were again enlisted and he
noted the alteration of this beverage to
be coexistent with the presence and mul-
tiplication of microscopic things. The
morphology of the cells present was
identical in samples of wine having the
same "disease"; and he postulated a
specific etiological agent for each con-
dition. The question as to the origin of
these organisms perplexed Pasteur and
he eagerly sought their source. By a
series of brilliant experiments he dem-
onstrated the atmosphere under ordi-
nary conditions to be laden with mi-
croorganisms, and, to insure their ab-
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the air. If the wine was already con-
taminated, further action was prevented
by a short period of heating at low tem-
perature—now called pasteurization.
Pasteur's contributions dealing with
fermentation were interlarded with the
problems of France and he was impor-
tuned by the government to investigate
the diseases of silk worms which were
rampant in the southern provinces. He
had never seen a healthy silk worm
when he received this call; as it hap-
pened, microscopic life was involved and
these experiences formed an introduc-
tion to the labors which were to occupy
subsequently his every thought, namely
immunity to disease. The proof of the
association of microbic life with disease
(Koch 1876) was so spectacular and the
rewards for the discovery of the indi-
vidual germ associated with a particular
malady so far reaching that all efforts
were expended in this direction. Thus
microbes came to be looked upon as a
scourge of man and Pasteur led in the
defense against them. The removal of
ferments from the hands of the chemists
to the restricted realm of medical sci-
ence was unfortunate, for it held in
abeyance the modest attempts of those
who would understand bacteria per se.
The pathogenic varieties are of no com-
mercial importance other than as a re-
agent for stimulating immunity to dis-
ease.
The slumbering interest of scientists
in microbic life was reawakened by the
World War. The British needed acetone
for the manufacture of cordite, and the
usual Austrian sources were closed.
Statements were unearthed in several
publications to the effect that certain
strains of bacteria, when cultured on
sugar containing mediums under very
definite conditions, yielded traces of
acetone along with other products. The
combined efforts of competent and ex-
perienced individuals from several na-
tions were commandeered to investigate
the possibilities of putting such germs to
work, and, when the conflict terminated,
large scale plant production was a real-
ity. In addition to the acetone in this
reaction, butanol, ethanol, carbon diox-
ide and hydrogen were by-products. The
necessity of outlets for these compounds
was an important link in the develop-
ment of the quick drying lacquer indus-
try, and its increasing demands have
firmly established the process with mo-
lasses acting as the raw material. Mi-
croorganisms were likewise regimented
by the Germans, for early in the war
their stores of glycerol rapidly dwindled
and the allies looked upon the lack of
this chemical as a favorable influence
for an early cessation of hostilities. For
some incomprehensible reason adequate
supplies remained in the hands of the
enemy. For purposes of propaganda,
the Huns were accused of using human
material as a source of glycerol; when,
in reality, they were decomposing sugar
with yeast in the presence of sulphite, a
feat which increased enormously the
yield of glycerol, the impurity of alco-
holic fermentation recorded by Pasteur
decades earlier.
Fermentation has been looked upon
as the decomposition of sugars with the
production of alcohol. During this pro-
cess (similarly in the making of beer)
the active liberation of gas gave to the
fermenting mass the appearance of boil-
ing—expressed in French by the term
jevre-to-boil. The accompanying odors
are usually pleasant. Pasteur designated
all changes associated with germ life as
fermentation, and the disposal of the
carcass of an animal by microbic agents
falls under this cognomen although the
concomitant odors are distinctly dis-
agreeable. Today the term is used with
the connotation of Pasteur, even includ-
ing such process as the biological dis-
posal of sewage.
The present exploitation of microbes
has allied the microbiologist with the
chemist and the engineer, and the chem-
ist has found some reward for this
seeming humiliation in the names of the
organisms. Such appellations as Clos-
tridium polyfermenticum or Clostridium
saccharo-aceto-butylicum are worthy of
a niche in the armamentorium of good
organic terminology.
The bacteriologist separates his bugs
into three distinct groups. The first, the
bacteria of Leeuwenhoek, are the small-
est and most primitive forms; to mul-
tiply they simply enlarge or elongate
and then break in two. This process may
require only twenty minutes and the
possible crop in twenty-four hours would
be enormous if this rate of increase
should continue uninterrupted. Of
course, it does not for a number of rea-
sons. The yeasts compose the next higher
group. The individual cells are some-

what larger in size than the bacteria and
the yeasts multiply by budding; they
are the budding fungi. Molds, the
third group, are characterized by long
filaments and are recognized by all lay-
men as they appear on moldy bread. In
addition to growth by mere end exten-
sion, the processes of reproduction are
very complex. There are many genera
and hundreds of species in each group,
but, to the uninitiated, all are usually
called bacteria.
The production of chemicals by fer-
mentation—whether bacteria, yeasts, or
molds are involved—is a catalytic re-
action. The enzymes are manufactured
by the growing organisms, therefore the
process presupposes a special knowledge
of the growth-demands of the germ,
particularly the conditions under which
they will produce the highest degree of
the catalyst desired. All germs require
moisture, food, a certain temperature
and a definite tension for oxygen; the
acidity or basicity of the medium is
also important. As growth proceeds, all
or any one of these requirements may
be altered and attention must be given
to their maintenance. The primitive
nature of microorganisms enables them
to adapt themselves quite readily to a
changing environment, but, in so doing,
a new set of metabolic products usually
results. The handling of the fermentation
further demands that the reaction be
carried out in special equipment free
from undesirable germ life and under
conditions which prevent the entrance of
foreign organisms, so-called contamina-
tion, which will bring about an unde-
sirable chemical transformation.
The first industry to
employ pure cultures was
the ancient art of brew-
ing beer. Although rec-
ognized as being de-
pendent upon living or-
ganisms much mystery
surrounded the process
and the brewmasters fre-
quently encountered con-
ditions they could not
control. In the Carls-
berg brewery in Copen-
hagen, Hansen, a stu-
dent of Pasteur, studied pure cultures
of yeast and found the strain
used in making the beer exerted a
profound influence on the quality of the
product. The Danes at once adopted
the procedure of inoculating the mash
to be fermented with the desired strains
and their products have enjoyed an en-
viable reputation.
The use of a pedigreed strain of or-
ganism in certain processes is not always
practical or, in fact, desirable. We have
the very cosmopolitan microbic flora in
sewage, and the anaerobic fermentation
of this substance for the production of
fuel gas was purposefully carried out as
early as 1897. A waste disposal plant
at Bombay was equipped with gas col-
lectors and the gas, principally methane,
was used to drive gas engines. In 1925,
Imhoff in Germany introduced the gas
made in a sludge digestion tank directly
into the city mains. Many studies have
demonstrated that this procedure is di-
rectly applicable to farm wastes; thus,
a ton of corn stalks under similar con-
ditions would yield 10,000 to 20,000
Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering
cubic feet of gas. The cost of collection
of the raw material is at present a lim-
iting factor in the development of this
process.
There is a voluminous literature on
the products formed by the activities of
the microorganisms. They include al-
cohols, aldehydes and acids, from formic
to valeric, all of which have been iden-
tified in solutions of carbohydrates sub-
jected to the action of bacteria, yeasts or
molds. The engineer or chemist who an-
ticipates using living agents must be
familiar with their growth requirements,
which may be fastidious: he must be
aware that microorganisms are subject
to variation without warning which ne-
cessitates a most caerful and continued
study of the stock strains. That these
problems are not insurmountable is il-
lustrated by the tremendous increase in
the number and variety of fermentation
industries in recent years, and this ex-
pansion is only a prelude to future de-
velopments in this field from which will
ultimately emerge the Biological En-
gineer.

THE first
problem
which faces
an engineering
521-r graduate just
entering in-
dustry is that
of acclimating
himself to his
new surround-
ings. Second,
but more im-
portant, is the problem of how to
continue his development and educa-
tion to a point where he is capable of
filling a full-fledged, responsible engi-
neering position.
The purpose of this brief article is
to call to the attention of you fellows
who will be stepping out into perma-
nent industrial jobs this summer, some
of the available facilities which can be
of real help in making the solution of
these problems not only easier but much
more pleasant. From personal exper-
ience and contacts with a number of
other junior engineers in industry, I
have found that the man coming from
school is not in most cases aware of
all of the existing opportunities for con-
tinuation of his education and establish-
ment of professional acquaintances out-
side of his own company.
What appears to be one of the most
promising aids along this line is a rather
new development known as the Junior
Engineers movement. It consists at
present of a number of local junior engi-
neering societies which are scattered
throughout the country. They are not
related in any way but most of them
are sponsored by one of the various
senior professional societies along with
the aid of the Engineers' Council for
Professional Development. The thing
which does tie them together, however,
is their common purpose of serving the
young engineer in industry, and to keep
this purpose in the fore, most of them
limit their membership to men who are
less than five years out of school.
Generally stated, the aims of the
"The few years of college are gone before
the would-be engineer has had time to do
more than make a fair beginning on his job of
educating himself. He must then earn a living,
and he may want to take him a wife, and he
certainly will find many things interfering
with his most important task, namely, the
continuing of his education. But one thing is
as sure as sunrise, to wit: that if earning his
living, poker games, movies, marrying and
raising kids, or staying single and raising Cain,
or anything else under the sun causes him to
forget the fact that he must somehow con-
tinue to get an education, he is doomed. He
will settle down into a more or less comfort-
able rut; he will do what other engineers
direct him to do as long as he stays in the
profession. A man may fail in college courses
ind this usually eliminates him as a potential
:nginccr; he may pass his college courses suc-
cessfully and within the next five years elimi-
nate himself just as effectively."
—Harry A. Curtis, Chief Chemical Engineer
Tennessee Valley Authority.
Junior Engineers' movement are as fol-
lows: (1) to afford an opportunity for
acquaintance of young engineers with
each other and with older men who are
outstanding in the community and the
engineering profession; (2) to acquaint
the young engineer with certain impor-
tant general principles, policies and prac-
tices which must be observed in indus-
trial and business relations; (3) to pro-
vide incentive and facilities for study

through group
discussions
and co-oper-
ative technical
and non-tech-
nical courses;
(4) to encour-
age practice in
clear thinking,
self-expression
and leader-
ship.
A good example of how these aims
actually are being carried out will be
found in the program of the Providence
Junior Engineers at Providence, R. I.
This group of about fifty fellows holds
a general meeting once a month at which
a prominent engineer or business man
talks on some subject of particular in-
terest to young engineers. Note these
samples of recent subject titles: Control
of Time and Self; New Frontiers in
Business; and Planning the Develop-
ment of a Young Man in a Business
Concern. The talks usually are followed
by open discussion led by the speaker.
In addition to the general meetings
there are five smaller study and dis-
cussion groups on management, mar-
keting, public speaking, machine design
and civil engineering, each meeting bi-
weekly. These groups set up their own
programs for the year and, with the
aid of some older engineers as technical
consultants, have been able to carry on
very effectively. Several plant inspec-
tion trips are also made each year. A
couple of months ago I had the privilege

Studies Flaws in Automobile Body Design
by
WILLIAM S. TAYLOR. '39E
SPEED FOR SALE!
If you were confronted with such
a phrase, would you buy? Indeed, nine
chances out of ten you have already
bought—figuratively, at least, if not
actually. If you own a car you have
undoubtedly been sold some speed with
it. That is what the automobile indus-
try with the strong support of aviation
has sold to everyone in recent years.
Now manufacturers find themselves
faced with the problem of satisfying in
a safe and sane way the craving for
speed they have created.
Ever growing in the function of design
of automobiles is the factor of body
shape. The straight and stiff box-
affairs of a decade ago are entirely un-
satisfactory for modern day automobile
speeds, and until recent years, speed
was thought of entirely in terms of en-
gine power rather than in terms of
scientific body design. Up until 1932,
the tendency of car manufacturers was
to disregard the possibilities of effective
body design and satisfy their speed-mad
customers with high powered cars which
thrust their way through the air by
sheer force. Soon Mr. Public began to
feel the price he was paying for his
speed when it was necessary to supply
fuel to furnish this increase in power,
and immediately manufacturers were
beset with pleas for cheaper operating
costs. After the buying public had once
experienced the thrill of speed—after
they had become used to getting places
in a certain time, they could never be
satisfied with getting there in a longer
time. To be sure, it is human nature to
possess something and still desire more;
as the top speed of cars is made to in-
crease, the desire to drive at greater
speeds will increase, "but,'' say the driv-
ers, "not at our expense." Consequently,
the task of providing speed economically
finally fell upon the shoulders of the
research and development men who
tackled it with a smile and soon pro-
duced practical results.
Of particular interest is the work
that was carried on by the Automotive
Department of The University of Mich-
igan under the direction of W. E. Lay,
Professor of Mechanical Engineering.
The work was prompted by the fact that
the greater portion of engine power in
a moving automobile is used to over-
come air resistance. Under Professor
Lay's direction, wind tunnel tests were
made on various shaped models de-
scribed in detail later, and road tests
made on a full-size body.
The air resistance of a body consists
of two factors: (1) skin friction and (2)
form resistance. Skin friction is due to
the viscosity of the air lying next to the
surface boundary of the moving object.
The film of air nearest the body clings
to it and moves with it. Each successive
outward layer of air has an increased
velocity toward the rear of the moving
object, and it is due to the friction be-
tween these air layers that a drag is
encountered. Skin friction is always
present with any moving body, but it
constitutes only 10-15$ of the total air
resistance. Form resistance, on the other
hand, constitutes about 85% of the total
air resistance and is proportional to the
cross sectional area of the body—this
area being taken as the projected area
of the body on a plane perpendicular
to the path of motion. With these two
factors, skin friction and form resist-
ance, an equation may be formed ex-
pressing air resistance in terms of these
units: Ra = KAV- where Rn = air re-
sistance force in pounds, K = a coeffici-
ent of air resistance expressed in pounds
per square foot of projected area per
mile per hour squared, A = projected
area in square feet, and V = velocity in
miles per hour in still air.
The fundamental aim in streamlining
an object is to shape the front to form
an opening through the air with a min-
imum of disturbance, and to shape the
rear to replace the air stream with a
minimum of turbulence and eddies in
the wake of the vehicle. In view of these
facts, three objects were selected as
"yardsticks" to act as a basis for com-
parison of various experimental shapes.
First, a flat plate was taken, which, of
course, proved to be a very bad example
of streamlining since it splashes the air
in all directions causing great disturb-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


a one-quarter-scale model of a 1930 se-
dan was taken as the second yardstick.
Its projected area was exactly that of
the flat plate. Lastly, an ideal stream-
line body with the projected area of the
previous two and of the conventional
tear drop design (see figure) was used.
These three models were tested under
similar conditions in the wind tunnel
and the value for K in the equation
R„ = KAV- was found for each and
used for the comparison of air resist-
ance. From these tests it was found
that the 1930 sedan model gave a 52.5%
reduction in air resistance compared
with the flat plate, and the ideal stream-
line body reduced the resistance by
93.7%.
Having established a standard for
comparison, we may proceed with the
actual results of the investigation ob-
tained by a series of systematic varia-
tions of models in the wind tunnel.
Experiments were conducted first with
a rectangular model having square edges
and corners. The additional length
alone given the projected area produced
a decrease of 31.2% in the resistance
compared with the flat plate, and it was
found by rounding the edges and corners
to the equivalent of a 9 inch radius in
a full scale object, the resistance was
reduced by 65.69^. Additional experi-
ments were made with various wheel-
housing combinations, and it was dis-
covered that the least air resistant type
housing was the open style with wheels
set within the body but open on sides
and bottom.
Continuing with the experiments, the
middle section of the rectangular-box
model was retained but provisions were
made for attachment of various com-
binations of front and rear shapes. The
front shapes were elliptical forms vary-
ing from a full-bodied front to a finer-
lined ellipse and vertical windshield with
several intermittent windshield slopes.
The rear shapes were parabolic forms

u^^m^&gt;jyj-^


Three Yardsticks.
and varied from a stub end to a long tri-
angular tail-piece. Systematic testing
was carried on whereby each separate
tail form was tested with each different
windshield shape, and upon tabulation
of results several interesting observa-
tions were noted.
It appeared that no great advantage
was derived by an elliptical front form
over the 45 degree slope windshield
style; in fact, in several cases the 45
degree slope windshield proved superior
to the elliptical front. This indicates
the considerable freedom allowable in
developing the front windshield. Also,
the evidence indicates that no great ad-
vance can be made in revamping the
rear section of a car if an efficient front
section is not provided. But as a whole,
variations in the style of the rear sec-
tion in combination with a given front
section produced a greater change in air
resistance than variable front sections
combined with a given rear style.
As a result of these last steps of ob-
servation, a compromise model was con-
structed having the combined advan-
tages of the variable combination model,
structural efficiency, and what the pub-
lic wants in general appearance. This
compromise model possessed a 45 degree
slant windshield, modified front fenders,
and was slightly narrowed at the front
and rear sections. It was found to have
a resistance to airflow 58.1% less than
the typical 1930 sedan and a reduction
of 81% over the standard flat plate.
The next step from the wind tunnel
tests was to conduct some full-size auto-
mobile road tests and endeavor to cor-
relate the results into a factor expressing
the relation of wind tunnel testing to
road testing. Such a factor would enable
road test results to be calculated from
wind tunnel experiments, thus, eliminat-
ing much expense in conducting an ex-
cess of costly road tests. It was decided
to use the simple rectangular-box body
design to attempt to derive the factor.
A "floating-envelope" constructed of
pressed-wood was mounted on a donated
low-priced automobile chassis. This
"floating-envelope" was a life-size
duplicate of the rectangular model
and possessed provisions for square
or rounded corners. After a series
of over one hundred thorough tests
conducted on a specially selected sec-
tion of highway in very calm weather
conditions, the average value of K was
found to be in excellent agreement with
the results obtained in the wind tunnel
tests, which, of course, was the condition
hoped for.
The advances made in the streamlin-
ing of cars today are readily detected,
and all indications point toward a vital
concentration of scientific streamlining
in future vehicles. The public mind has
been initiated into the possibilities of
beautiful design and is streamline con-
scious. These changes will be welcomed
at a more rapid rate than ever before—
particularly changes which reduce oper-
ating costs. The public has destined the
car of the future to be a marvel of
efficiency and streamlined beauty.
Systematic testing was
carried on whereby each
separate tail to;m was
tested with each wind-
shield shape.

Philip A. Singleton
THIS article has been written by a
recent engineering graduate, for en-
gineering students. It does not cover
selling in a general, comprehensive
manner. It does present a year's ob-
servations in the field of Industrial
Equipment Marketing. The information
submitted is the result of a beginner's
experience: not an experts thorough
analysis.
The Student Angle
Engineer's conceptions of salesmen
differ considerably. Yet most of the
impressions are not very favorable.
Principally because salesmen are sup-
posed to be aggressive—nervy fellows,
impervious to insult or discouragement.
Possibly also because engineers do not
like the smoke emitted from black ci-
gars and a slap on the back early in
the morning.
The Fuller Brush Man, the go-getter
three-star Insurance Salesman, The Sat-
urday Evening Post's Super-Earthworm
Tractor Salesman, Alexander Botts, each
represent a type of individual that en-
gineers would rather avoid than mimic.
Selling as a vocation? "Thanks, no,
not selling." "I've studied engineering;
I'm going to be a real engineer."
It's a typical feeling among Senior
Engineering Students ... "I think I'd
like engineering sales work if it weren't
for this business of contacting unin-
terested prospects. It'd be nice if I
could go into a big office and ta'.k over
a project with an interested engineer
and try to sell him my idea on its mer-
its. I'd like to use this good brain of
mine on a job where results will show
and I'll be given credit. But the idea of
peddling something that people don't

want, the thought of influencing by in-
sincere flattery and business entertain-
ing; they just don't appeal to me. I'm
sure that I couldn't bring myself to
doing it as a life work."
Student Becomes Engineer
These same Student Engineers have
graduated and have gone out into the
business world with that same sneaking
idea about Salesmen and Salesmanship.
And gradually, with the help of their
good brains, they've taken over the more
responsible positions where it becomes a
part of their job to interview salesmen.
Unconsciously they're on their guard.
They aren't going to be bribed into a
betrayal of an engineer's responsibility
to his firm. They don't want to be
flattered or entertained by strangers.
They're not interested in having a sales-
man buy their lunch for them.
They want facts. Facts presented in
an orderly manner. They want to think
over the proposition themselves. Alone
in the peace and quiet of their own of-
fice. They want to come to their own
decision undisturbed by an attack of
flashy sales arguments.
They have developed a sales resist-
ance that the old style salesman finds
difficult to meet. They do not listen to
his jokes—"not enough time this morn-
ing, sorry." They do not give him a
chance to argue. They are, perhaps,
just a bit embarrassed in his poised and
confident presence.
And they do not buy from him.
They'd much prefer to do business with

been themselves.
Alert Sales Managers have been
quick to sense this change. Such alert-
ness is the main part of their job.
Their immediate action has been in line
with the sound policy of giving the cus-
tomer what he really wants rather than
trying to force him to take something
unpleasant.
Exit the Back-Slapper
The wise-cracking, gum-chewing, par-
ty-boy salesman has joined a lost gen-
eration. As far as the engineering sales
field is concerned, his species is nearly
extinct. The few remaining specimens
are today pointed out as the "grand old
men" of the profession—respected for
their strange ability to hang on and
make a living through selling a few
"grand old customers.''
The modern trend to specialized pro-
duction tends to place less importance
en aggressive personal sales methods,
and more importance on the logical pres-
entation of pertinent and accurate en-
gineering information.
Replacing the "high-pressure"' sales-
man comes a new type of sales repre-
sentative; aggressive, perhaps, but in a
more subtle manner; respected less for
his stock of jokes, and more for a sound
knowledge of his product, and a sympa-
thetic understanding of each customer's
problem.
Enter the Sales Engineer
The successful salesman today serves
in the capacity of an engineering con-
sultant in his specialized field. Custom-
ers like to feel that they can call for in-
telligent counsel in the solution of their
problems. This engineering service be-
comes an integral part of the sale and
is sold along with the product and its
merits.
The engineering sales profession has
undergone a change, even in name.
Checking through the stack of calling
cards in a Purchasing Agent's file,
there is a notable change in title among
those who call from the former "Sales-
man," to an assortment of vocations
ranging from "Fuel Specialist" to "Lub-
rication Engineer." The change is not
one of nomenclature alone. It repre-
sents a new selling approach.
The technical representative, although
his object is to sell, does not like to
say, "I am a salesman." He much pre-
fers, "I have specialized in the applica-

estimate.

tion of our product, and would like to
help you with your problem."
Technically trained men to contact
engineers has proved a sound and work-
able idea. A working force of "Sales
Engineers" is the present aim in indus-
trial marketing.
Engineer Meets Engineer
A good sales engineer must have a
knowledge both general and specific. He
must be sufficiencly informed on all gen-
eral problems to at least hold his own in
a conversation, and he must have
enough spec'fic data at his command to
be able to make a sound technical rec-
emmendation when the customer asks
for his advice.
Specialization in any field results in
the development of a trade language
characteristic of the problems in that
field. Business negotiations can be
made more effective if both parties are
familiar with the problem, and speak
the "language." This is the basic reason
why engineers prefer to talk business
with one of their own species. It saves
time and results in a better engineering
solution.
The negotiations and discussions,
however, must be in terms of the spe-
cific problem in which the customer is
interested. Irrelevant data is of interest
and value in stimulating conversation,
Electrical Engineering
but once the issue is met the facts must
be accurate and have direct bearing.
Sales Engineering as a Vocation
As a vocation, Sales Engineering of-
fers opportunity as a pleasuieable life
work for a man with an understanding
of engineering principles and an ability
to reason through a proposition in terms
of a customer's problem.
The actual influencing of people is less
obvious than in the past. It is, of course,
a part of every transaction, but the final
decision, "we will buy," or "we will not
buy" depends more on sound engineer-
ing principles than on aggressive sales-
manship. The trend to specialization
places emphasis on an engineering sale
in preference to a personal sale.
Pleasing personality, enthusiasm, and
persistence are all important factors
which enter into the consideration. But
if a sale is made, it is generally because
the customer has made up his mind
that he wants to go ahead with the
proposition. The salesman's personal
work has accomplished results, but the
customer has not stopped to analyze his
decision to purchase from one man ex-
cept that the proposition seemed sound
and logical in an engineering way, and
good business for his company.

THE MACKINAC BRIDGE
by
PROFESSOR J. H. CISSEL
Civil Engineering Department
University oi Michigan
r"PHE NEED for a traffic medium be
-*- tween the upper and lower peninsu-
las of Michigan has been a problem of
more or less sporadic discussion for the
last fifty years. Subsequent to the re-
cent large increases in interpeninsular
traffic the question of crossing the
Straits of Mackinac has become acute.
Reduced to fundamentals, the prob-
lem is that of providing a transporta-
tion utility. Three possibilities are
available for consideration and each
should be fully and carefully studied.
These possibilitise are:
(A) Continuation of the Ferry Sys-
tem, amplifying facilities to meet traffic
requirements.
(B) Construction of a bridge.
(C) Construction of a tunnel through
the rock underlying the Straits.
It is our purpose to briefly discuss im-
portant factors relating to each of these
possible solutions to this problem.
(A) Ferry System.
The present ferries have been contin-
uously operated since 1923. Toll
charges from 1923 to 1932 inclusive
were based on operating costs, allowance
for depreciation and S% interest on
capital invested.
In 1933 the State Legislature amend-
ed the 1923 Ferry Act and, in accord-
ance with the provisions of the amend-
ment, capital expenditures in excess of
accrued profits were charged to and
paid out of State Highway Funds. In
effect, this procedure resulted in the ap-
plication of about $609,000 to ferry
purposes, which money was obtained
from sources other than tolls. This
amendment further provided that tolls
be based on operating and maintenance
costs only and that all further capital
expenditures be charged to and paid
from the State Highway Fund. In ac-
cordance with these provisions, toll
charges were reduced to their present
basis in 1933 and in effect this means
that, since such reduction became ef-
fective, State Highway Funds have been
used to meet capital charges and de-

preciation. These charges amount to
about forty cents for each vehicle car-
ried on the State Ferry. Continuation
of the Ferries means that new facilities
must be provided to the end that the
total capacity of the system will reas-
sonably meet peak traffic requirements.
Based on the present trend, total annual
traffic in 1942 would reach a volume of
about 700,000 vehicles. On no logical
basis can the 1942 traffic be estimated
less than about 450,000 vehicles. The
mean value between these figures, or
575,000, has been adopted as a reason-
able estimate of probable traffic volume
in 1942. Maximum daily traffic reached
a total of 2798 vehicles on August 16,
1936, and 2932 on September 6, 1936.
In 1942 this figure may reach 7,000 ve-
hicles, assuming growth comparable to
total annual traffic and provided facili-
ties are adequate. Assuming that ade-
quate service would transport about
lO'/'r of this maximum day's traffic dur-
ing a six hour period, the necessary ve-
hicle capacity of the ferry boats is esti-
mated at 800. This would require five
new boats, two with 150 car capacity
and three with 90 car capacity. Assum-
ing the two 150 car capacity boats to
be built for the winter service, the esti-
mated additional capital investment is,
including expenditures for docks and
appurtenant equipment, $4,200,000.00.
Continuation of the ferries means, there-
fore, that,
(1) Probably more than four million
dollars of State Highway Funds must be
invested in new facilities. Under exist-
ing state law, this money will not be
refunded from tolls.
(2) Toll charges will probably re-
main at their present figure.
(3) The service will, except during
peak periods, be probably no better
than at present.
(4) The total annual cost of the serv-
ice in 1942 based on 575,000 vehicles
will be approximately $863,000 exclu-
sive of capital charges and depreciation.
Assuming interest at 4% and amortiza-
tion in 30 years the annual cost would
be about $1,124,000 or about SI.95 per
vehicle.
(B) Bridge
Allowing five years for planning and
construction, the earliest first year's op-
eration would be 1942. Based on financ-
ing the entire cost of $32,400,000 by
revenue bonds amortized in 30 years
and with interest at 4%, the annual
service cost would be as follows:
Debt service (annually) $1,874,000
Maintenance and Operation. 160,000
Less receipt from R.R.
$2,034,000
. 250,000
Net cost for highway $1,784,000
Based on amortizing $16,200,000 in
30 years and refunding the remainder at
the end of the first 30 years of opera-
tion, the annual cost would be approxi-
mately $1,495,000.
Assuming a Federal Grant of 45%
and revenue bonds for the remaining
$17,820,000, the total annual cost
charged to Highway use would be
$940,000.
The important considerations relative
to a bridge are as follows:
(1) Capital investment required is
about $32,400,000. Under P. W. A. pro-
visions, it may be possible to obtain a
federal grant for $14,580,000 leaving
$17,820,000 to be financed.

would require an increase in toll charges
to about their former rate. Increase in
traffic would permit corresponding de-
crease in toll charges. If financed un-
der P. W. A. with 45% grant, present
rates of toll would probably produce
income of $100,000 to $300,000 in ex-
cess of requirements in the first year of
operation. Further increase in traffic
would permit reduction in tolls. In any
case, tolls could be reduced to a nominal
amount when the investment is amor-
tized.
(3) A bridge will furnish uninter-
rupted and continuous all-year service.
The time of crossing will be reduced to
about 30 minutes per vehicle instead of
an average of one to two hours.
(4) The indirect and intangible values
accruing from a bridge are of tremen-
dous importance. Continuous service,
adequacy for trucks and busses and rail
traffic should encourage development of
northern Michigan.
(C) Tunnel
Although it is believed likely that a
vehicular tunnel is feasible, no studies
worthy of consideration have yet been
made. Based on costs of similar work,
it is believed that the cost would be two
or three times that of a bridge and in
such case it would not be an ecomonic
solution.
In considering this problem too much
emphasis must not be placed on the im-
mediate cost or on the value of direct
returns available from tolls. It must be
remembered that this utility furnishes
the only link between the transportation
systems of the two sections into which
Michigan is divided. As such, it not
only serves Michigan's $400,000,000
annual tourist and resort business but
plays a vital part in the economic and
sociological development of a vast terri-
tory. This tourist trade is not to be
considered lightly when it is realized
that twenty million people live within
cne day's drive of the Straits, one of
America's favorite vacation lands. (Bu-
reau of Public Roads estimates $109
expenditure per car per tourist while in
the state.)
Replacement of the ferries by modern
facilities, probably a bridge, is inevita-
ble and it is questionable if the state
can afford to further postpone this ulti-
mately necessary improvement.

OFFICE BEHAVIOR
By exhibiting the wrong kind of of-
fice behaviour, it is very easy for a
young engineering graduate to hand
h-mself a serious setback at the very
beginning of his employment. Since the
errors he may make often derive directly
from habits established while in college,
we might do well to discuss some of
those habits here.
N"o engineering college can give each
instructor the protection afforded by an
outer office and a secretary. The typi-
cal faculty member's office opens di-
rectly on the hall. When the instructor
is in, his door is usually unlocked, or
open. Is it any wonder that everyone
seems to have the habit of walking in on
a faculty member?
The ready-access situation is further
encouraged by deliberate training. A
good engineering college must have ex-
cellent faculty-student relationships.
These are perhaps better nourished by
the ready accessibility of faculty mem-
bers, than through any other one phase
of this business of living and working
together in a college. Moreover, we
catch our freshmen early, and urge them
not to hesitate about looking up their
Mentors, or other instructors whom they
may need to see. As a direct result of
these good aspects of a college a student
who unconsciously trains himself in cer-
tain abuses of privilege here, is getting
himself all set for serious difficulties
hereafter.
A long-distance call comes to me, at
a moment when my door is slightly ajar.
In the midst of the call (which may be
confidential, and often is) a student
comes along who wishes to see me.
He observes me at the telephone. If
he walks rapidly and obviously away,
I will have little to fear about his
office behaviour in industry. But if
he leans up against the door jamb in
the hall (not to overhear, but to be
ready at hand when I am through) then
we know he is still blind to the require-
ments of certain occasions.
Since the things that happen to me
happen to nearly all faculty members,
permit me to continue with personal ex-
periences. Again, my door is ajar, and
I am in conference with a student, a
recruiter, or a faculty colleague. Along
comes the student. If he has acquired
good office behaviour, he takes one
glance and passes on. If he has not,
then he either waits just outside the
door, or paces up and down past the
door, or walks in to interrupt. Waiting
just outside the door is the worst crime.
Pacing up and down is almost as bad:
by putting tension on the conferees, it
is more likely to prolong the conference,
ra'her than shorten it; and it is likely to
put me in an unfavorable mood towards
the up-and-down pacer. In fact, it does.
As to walking in to interrupt, there are
wide differences in the methods used by
different students. Each year, it is ac-
tually true that a few students walk in
and really interrupt a conversation:
they start telling their problem, as if a
faculty member were at their instant
beck and call at all times. These in-
stances are rare, but it is amazing and
regrettable that they should ever hap-
pen.
This is not to say that no conference
fhould ever be interrupted; not by any
means. If the matter is urgent, the stu-
dent of course can get attention for a
moment. If he appears, and waits until
I turn to him, he simply needs to ask
when he should came back.
Let us remind ourselves again, that
when a student walks into an office
conference and remains in the office, we
have contributed to the bad training.
In any number of occasions, where con-
ferences are not confidential and when
the office is large, faculty members in-
vite waiting students to wait in the of-
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


occasions. It is not to be wondered at,
if some of our students are a little slow
at figuring out for themselves that the
safest rule is to fade out of sight and
hearing unless they are certain their
presence is not unwanted.
Another direct outgrowth of the fine
relations we have here between faculty
and students, is the following kind of
office behaviour. A student has not been
able to find a faculty member, whose
office is nearby. Seeing my door open,
he steps in to ask me if I know when
Professor Threephase will be in. Right
down the hall is the open door to the
head office of the department; inside
sits a department secretary, who is paid
to know the answers to such questions.
First, she knows the answer; second, I
do not; third, the student is asking me
to serve as department secretary for the
time being. ]f a faculty member had
nothing to do but sit and wait for inter-
ruptions, he could concentrate on that
kind of thing and do a pretty fair job
of it. But with things as they are, it
does not take very many such interrup-
tions in a morning, to shoot some large
holes in the morning's work.
We can smile at the naive quality of
a certain graduate student. This man
had graduated in a small school, where
everyone knew everyone else intimately.
He arranged to take graduate work in
a university as large as ours, and made

a trip there during the summer to get
things all arranged. When he got off
the train, he telephoned to the home of
the graduate school Dean to announce
his presence. He was quite nonplussed
to find that the Dean did not even know
his name, and did not seem interested in
helping him to find rooming quarters.
Well,—this chap went from a small
place to a big one, and made the mis-
take of carrying with him habits and
expectations that would be out of place.
We should not find too much amuse-
ment in the story (which is true), be-
cause some of our own students may be
just as naive when they leave this small
place for a larger one.
While the student is in college, fac-
ulty members in many ways correspond
quite closely to the officials of the com-
pany for which he will later work. If
the student learns good office behaviour
while here, in spite of the ever-present
opportunities to make mistakes and keep
on making them, then we may be sure
that he will know how to work well in
an organization after graduation. We
also know that no magic transforma-
tions occur on Commencement Day.
The man who blunders through human
relationships here for four years, will
keep right on blundering.
About four-fifths of the students who
may read this column can congratulate
themselves on their office behaviour. I
am proud of the way in which that pro-
portion of our students have learned to
be a part of an organization. It is en-
tirely possible for the remaining fifth
to learn to practice good office behav-
iour, provided they care to do so, and
in spite of the fact that we have no
course of study along that line. Simply
being in college presents so many oppor-
tunities, that to learn requires only will-
ingness to learn.

SPOTLIGHT

TIMBER TOPPER
WHEN Robert D. Osgood finally
leaves this campus in June, he
will leave behind him a saddened track
coach, for Coach Hoyt will be losing one
of the most consistent winners that he
has ever had on his thinclad squads.
While Bob was
a member of the
track team of
Lakewood High
School in Cleve-
land, Ohio, his
home town, he
was already an-
nexing records in
the high hurdles.
Upon arriving at
Ann Arbor, Bob
early betook himself to the Yost Field
House and set forth to obtain a set of
Freshmen Numerals. Being a high
hurdler, he took that obstacle in stride,
and graduated in his Sophomore year to
the ranks of the Varsity, to become
Hoyt's pride and joy.
One cannot speak of Bob without
mentioning some of his track records.
He holds the Field House record for the
65 yard high hurdles, of eight seconds
flat. He is also the record holder in-
doors, of the Big Ten Conference 70
vard high hurdles. Outdoors he has
competed with success in the J 20 yard
high hurdles, the 220 yard low hurdles,
in which he holds the school record of
23.5 seconds, the 400 meter high hur-
dles and the 440 yard dash as a flat
run. Last year, as a co-holder of the
world's record for the 120 yard high hur-
dles at 14.2 seconds, he was a serious
contender for the Olympic team, but
had the misfortune of hitting the last
hurdle during the final tryouts at Ran-
dall's Island.
Recognized by his schoolmates, as
much for his fine personality as for his
athletic prowess, they have elected him
to Triangles, Vulcans, and Michigamua.
A member of Phi Kappa Tau Frater-
nity, he served one year as House Man-
ager, and at present is Vice-President of
the Chapter.
When Bob is graduated from Michi-
gan and is actively engrossed in his cho-
sen profession, Mechanical Engineering,
we expect that he will hurdle all his
obstacles just as easily as he has in
school.
SCAT
AMONG the men slated to receive
their B.S. degree in Civil Engineer-
ing this June we find Bill "Alley Cats''
Olsen. Lest this strange name, for which
we offer due apologies, give offense it
would perhaps be advisable to explain
its origin. "Alley Cats'' is not as some
may conclude the name of a back yard
fence variety but is the name of the
present intramural hockey champions.
As founder, organizer, promoter and
trainer of this organization Bill has done
the typically complete job that is char-
acteristic of his work at the University
of Michigan.
Bill Olsen is another example of the
well-rounded col-
lege man to which
this column is
dedicated. He
has filled the
requirements of
scholastic ability
combined with
^4^ wide interests in
^^^^k college f f a i r s
which are prereq-
uisites to member-
ship in such honor societies as Tau Beta
Pi and Triangles. The "wide interests''
to which we refer include such duties as
serving as chairman of the membership
committee of the A. S. C. E., clarinetist
in the varsity band, secretary of the
class of '37 and manager of the varsity
hockey squad.
Olsen's professional interest is rail-
roading. He has kept faith with the an-
cient, but unreliable addage—like father
like son, for Bill's father is at present
Superintendent of the Manistee, North-
eastern Railroad. Incidentally Bill has


had ample opportunity to get at the
fundamentals of railroading by summer
work as a section hand with the Man-
istee and Northeastern.
To sum up our admiration for Bill is
a task which is difficult to express in
words. Perhaps the greatest tribute that
can be paid a man is reflected in the
respect of his associates; so we say: ask
a man who knows him.
POLITICIAN
SHOULD you step inside the door of
Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, and ask to
see Jim Walker, someone would most
certainly raise a loud call for "Hiram,"
for thus is he known to his intimates.
Born in De-
troit, and chris-
tened James Her-
bert Walker, Jr.
he has since
moved to Bir-
mingham, Michi-
gan, his present
home.
Since he first
came to Michi-
gan, J i m has
been among the most active men no
the campus. With a personality that
draws people to him, and a flare for
publicity, he early found a niche for
himself in the business department of
the TECHNIC staff. He made rapid
progress in this organization, and dur-
ing the last year occupied the position
as Business Manager.
As Jim is working towards a com-
bined Electrical and Mechanical Engi-
neering Degree, one would suppose that
his studies and work on the TECHNIC
would keep him quite busy enough.
However, he has been active in many
other ways. He has been elected to
the Triangles and Vulcans, Junior and
Senior Honor Societies respectively.
This year he was elected president of
the Engineering Council, and is also a
member of the Men's Council. Always
active around the chapter house, the
Phi Psi's this year elected him president.
Although Jim expects to return to
Michigan next year to complete his cur-
riculum requirements, we know that
when he gets out into the business world,
he will be just as outstanding as he has
been on our campus.

SALES ENGINEERING
Project vs. Product Sales
{Continued from Page 11)
Selling a generating plant is a lot
different than selling a necktie or a suit
of clothes.
The Sales Psychology is not at all
the same.
The same man will behave much dif-
ferently when he is spending his own
money, than when he is spending his
company's money. A man who is loved
by his friends for his open and generous
nature becomes a shrewd and canny
schemer when it comes to improving his
department output a few pounds a
day, or cutting 1.7 percent from his
operating costs.
Selling principles perfectly workable
for the suave clothing department sales-
man, or the pretty girl at the necktie
counter fail completely when it comes to
selling a process in competition with an-
other process. A timid engineer may be
maneuvered into buying a suit that he
later dislikes, or even a red necktie that
he'll never dare to wear. His vanity
TO SENIORS WITH JOBS
(Continued from Page 7)
of sitting in on one of the general meet-
ings of the Providence group, and the
thing which impressed me more than
anything else was the genuine enthusi-
asm with which the fellows seemed to
regard the work. It was quite evident
that here was an organization which was
really accomplishing something for its
members.
Some of the national professional so-
cieties are also extending their junior
activities. The A.S.M.E. for example
now has active junior groups in 36 cities.
Most of these meet periodically with the
local senior group and then in addition
carry on study programs similar to the
one at Providence. The New York City
chapter has sponsored cooperative study
groups in which anyone may enroll upon
payment of his portion of the salary of
a hired instructor. The number in
each class is of course limited.
Professional societies as a whole,
whether they sponsor separate junior
programs or not, seem to be realizing
more and more the needs of the new
man in the field. I would seriously sug-
gest that when you get out on the new
job you at least investigate the local
chapter of your particular professional
may be flattered. He enjoys the thought
of a successful appearance. He buys on
the spur of the moment. He does not
have time to shop around and make up
his mind at leisure.
But that same timid engineer becomes
an iron man when he sits at a desk and
obscures his personality in a haze of
technical details and pipe smoke. He is
now buying for the company. His loy-
alty to the Board of Directors is some-
thing magnificent. Every penny, every
percent of efficiency is vitally important.
The proposition must stand on its own
merit, not on a salesman's pleasing
personality.
The value of pertinent information
has been mentioned before, but it can-
not be over-emphasized. The good sales
society. Attend a few of the meetings.
If things seem pretty dead as far as jun-
ior activity and interest are concerned,
perhaps the local fathers would thank
you for a helpful suggestion. The com-
mittee on professional training of the
Engineers' Council for Professional De-
velopment, 29 West 39th Street, New
York City, can give some valuable
pointers on setting up a program for a
small group of fellows.
Some of you will be fortunate (or un-
fortunate) enough to enter a company
which puts all of its recruits through a
plant training course.
Most seasoned engineers are inclined
to regard such courses as a desirable
complement to the "extra-curricular"
program of development rather than a
substitute for it.
Finally, there is the increasing num-
ber of extension and evening courses
being offered by colleges and universities
in large cities. Among these are courses
in engineering, business administration,
economics, finance, accounting and busi-
ness law which are available to the
young engineer who is interested in con-
tinuing his education in a more formal
manner.
engineer is the one who can sense a
question in the back of the customer's
mind, and then answer just that ques-
tion, specifically.
The Technical Report
In this connection, the technical re-
port is becoming of increasing import-
ance. Instead of a formal quotation of
prices, shipping weights, and delivery,
the modern procedure is to submit a
personal report describing the product,
not in a general way as in catalogs or
bulletins, but briefly, accurately, in
terms of the customer's problem. The
report that is involved and irrelevant
will not be read. If it hews to the line,
it will be read, and will sell more than
several long conversational interviews.

P M AS THE PYRAMIDS ...
Vem AS THE 20TH CENTURY
t/
While the pyramids of Cheops were yet young,
dyers of Thehes were using indigo. For more than
five thousand years, the rich blues of natural in-
digo were prized for their beauty and fastness.
Then, in 1866, Adolph von Baeyer, a famous Ger-
man professor, became curious about this age-old
dyestuff. He determined to penetrate the secret of
indigo's atomic structure.
To his amazement he found that indigo was com-
posed of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon and nitrogen
atoms surrounding two benzene residues—the
identical substances present in coal-tar products!
It remained only for chemical science to achieve
complete synthesis of these elements and a manu-
factured indigo would result.
Thus, out of this venturesome professor's research
grew a new and better way to produce indigo.
Moreover, chemists later discovered that by sub-
stituting bromine atoms for hydrogen, various
shades of blue were secured. Other variations
brought forth yellows, oranges, reds and violets.
The World War dramatically shut off our accus-
tomed European source of these dyestuffs. But
promptly, on behalf of American fabric producers,
The Dow Chemical Company undertook to per-
fect its own process for producing indigo and
its derivatives.
These manufacturers well know how speedily and
successfully Dow mastered the problem. Inciden-
tally, to Dow also went the distinction of being the
first producer of synthetic indigo in this country.
Dow has maintained a distinct leadership in this
field. Currently Dow produces twenty-six different
indigoid products. Each is notable for its purity,
fastness and uniformity of color. Each is a tang-
ible tribute to Dow research, resourcefulness and
ability to produce well.

FROM THE MARINES
Those students who are in the Depart-
ment of Naval Architecture, or who ex-
pect to enter it, will be interested to
know that out of the eight who were
graduated from that department last
June, all have been placed with some
shipping firm or in some shipping con-
nection. Most of those eight were
signed up before graduation. At pres-
ent there are no graduates in the
department.
Professor Baier of the department is
occupied with shallow draft work, hav-
ing to do with the relation of the depth
of the water beneath the keel to the
force required to drive the craft. Pro-
fessor Adams is conducting rolling ex-
periments to determine the effect of the
shape or type of bottom upon the roll of
a boat. Formerly, the models used in
these experiments had to be made to
roll by mechanical means. A method
has been devised by Professor Adams
whereby the model is made to roll by
means of induction, simulating actual
conditions more accurately.
A NEW BOOK
Professors Henry E. Riggs and Wal-
ter C. Sadler, of the Civil Engineering
department, recently cooperated in re-
vising Raymond's Elements of Railroad
Engineering. The obsolete matter to be
found in old editions has been elim-
inated, and new chapters on railroad
history, organization, finance, and valu-
ation have been added. Other chap-
ters have been revised or completely re-
written to bring all material up to date.
This book, the fifth edition, has just
been published by John Wiley and Sons,
Inc., of New York, and will be used as
a text in C. E. SO.
ENGINEERING OPEN HOUSE
The Engineering Council will again
put on an Engineering Open House;
this year it will take place on Saturday,
May 1st. James Goodrich, 37E, an-
nounced that this open house will com-
bine the usual technical side-show idea
with a systematic effort to show the vis-
itors the porfessional aspects of engi-
neering education. In the past, the
Open House was an opportunity for
outsiders to view with awe the tricks
and acts the upperclassmen put on for
their edification. Jim promises the acts,
more and better ones, but the Engineer-
ing Council is determined to impress
upon the visitors the truly professional
nature of the Junior and Senior class-
room work. As an example of a depart-
mental exhibit, the Naval Architects will
show drawings of ships, the three di-
mensional models, and the correlation
of ship results and design arrangements.
For the Open House, numerous Junior
Colleges and high schools throughout
the state will be invited to send their
students who are interested in engineer-
ing or who are planning to enter our
university.

CAMPUS NEWS
HONOR POINTS, ACTIVITIES,
AND SUCCESS
The Society for the Promotion of
Engineering Education has given this
publication some interesting figures cor-
relating campus activities and scholastic
achievements with post-graduate suc-
cess. They found that 27% of the suc-
cessful men (those who came under
their investigation) stood in the upper
tenth of the classes in which they were
graduated, 40% of the remaining part
of the upper third were also successful,
26% of the middle third and only 7%
of the lower third were successful to any
extent. Turning the story about we find
that only 5% of the unsuccessful en-
gineers came from the top tenth while
27% of the failures were from the lower
third. Those in campus activities scored
high as usual: 28% of the top-flight men
in the engineering world had participated
substantially in various collegiate ac-
tivities; only 3% of these fellows who
engaged heavily in extra-curricular work
were unsuccessful.
No correlation was found between
summer work and college earnings and
subsequent success; this finding broke
the Horatio Alger bubble to the effect
that working you way through school
was a sure key to riches and eternal
glory—the working student did not
fall behind the fellow who received an
allowance from home; he gave that fel-
low a head start and then managed to
tie him in' the race. On the whole the

only real correlation was between honor
point average and success; three out of
every four men who were graduated in
the top rungs of their class are success-
ful engineers today; on the other hand,
three out of every four engineers who
squeezed through the curricula in the
lower portions of their class are pretty
much all failures as engineers.

OKONITE insulation with an unsurpassed record
since 1878 is still generally recognized as the
acme of perfection for rubber insulations and as
"the best product possible" of its type.
The Okonite Company and its affiliates, how-
ever, have constantly kept step with the ad-
vances of the electric art.
Whether the wire or cable is large or small,
single or multiple conductor, high or low volt-
age, whether finished with a rubber or a syn-
thetic compound jacket, braid, lead sheath or
armor of any type, Okonite can make it.
In all cases, whether the correct solution calls
for rubber, impregnated paper, varnished cam-
bric, asbestos, glass or the newer synthetic
compounds, the policy still is and will continue
to be the best product possible.

PROFESSION
DID YOU KNOW THAT—
Despite the fact that clays and ce-
ments have been in use ever since man
abandoned trees in favor of caves, no
one yet knows exactly what happens
when modern cement crystallizes.
A thirty-seven ton sea plane with a
passenger capacity of 70 has been
launched in France. The plane cost
over a million dollars, has a cruising
speed of 145 miles per hour and is de-
signed for service over the Atlantic.
Twelve of our leading steel producers
representing 56,257,720 gross tons of
ingot capacity, or 82 per cent of the
country's total, report an aggregate
profit of $125,180,219 for 1936 which is
194 per cent over the profit for the
identical twelve in 1935.
Such materials as rubber and organic
plastics would be more widely used if
the engineering data with regard to
physical properties required by the de-
signing engineer were available.
BONUS FOR ALERTNESS
One of many problems involved in the
manufacture of cold drawn steel bars is
that of guarding against "mixed" steel
—that is, preventing bars of "A" from
straying into a lot of bars of analysis
"B" or "C". In addition to following
the usual precautions such as color code
painting of bar ends, use of identifica-
tion tags, etc., one manufacturer pays
a bonus of $5.00 to any employee who
detects the presence of a misplaced bar
in a lot of bars in production.—Steel.
TRADE MARKS
Recently a spark plug manufacturer
brought suit against a concern that
bought used spark plugs, reconditioned
ihem and then sold the second hand
product without removing the original
trade mark. The plaintiff claimed that
the used products misrepresented the
quality for which his trade mark
stood. A United States District Court
ruled that the defendant had infringed
upon the plaintiff's trade mark and
ordered that the defendant should be
restrained from selling the reconditioned
spark plugs without first removing the
trade mark therefrom.
This test case has brought a relatively
new problem before many manufactur-
ers that have been reconditioning other
concerns' products and not removing the
original trade marks. The difficulties
concerning this question arise from the
differentiation between reasonable repair
and substantial reconstruction. The
purchaser of a patented article may
make all reasonable repairs to maintain
the article in good condition during its
normal life. He cannot, however, recon-
struct the article so that in effect a new
article results.

EVACUATE FAMILY,

IN EVANSVILLE
Into the flood zone several General Klectric en-
gineers—among them Henry Duval of Washington
University, Eugene Darlington of Oregon State, and
Harold Towlson of Clark son Tech — took two radio-
equipped police cars and played an important part
in the relief activities along the Ohio Valley. The
equipment included a two-way ultra-short-wave
police radio set in each car, a 50-watt headquarters
transmitter, and a 150-meter transmitter having its
own gas-engine-driven electric generator—in reserve
in case of power failure.
One of the engineers reported, "We arrived in
Evansville and erected our antenna on the 75-foot
tower of a bank building. We were on the air con-
tinually, rendering service to the flooded area."
In a further effort to aid flood victims, General
Electric sent extra men to the G-E Service Shops in
the affected area to speed repair work.

IT'S "NEW AMERICAN"
Conceived by General Electric, the "New American"
home promises to influence profoundly the trend in
American building. The program is sponsored in co-
operation with all those professionally interested in
building new and better homes.
The modern kitchen is one of the results of this work.
It has been changed from just a room where a
variety of tasks must be performed to a scientifically
planned workshop. It is equipped with electric
appliances which do the drudgery of kitchen work
silently and easily. The electric range, refrigerator,
dishwasher, Disposall unit, and modern lighting are
but examples of the improvements which have been
made in the home workshop.
The radial wiring system used in the "New
American" home was designed for safety and con-
venience. Plenty of outlets for lights and for appli-
ances are the outstanding features of this system.
Tbe home is thoroughly air conditioned. Condi-
tioned air is not only more comfortable but also more
bealthful, and the G-E air-conditioning units have
been designed to promote such conditions.
With the elimination of wasted space, steps, and
time throughout the entire dwelling—with the
maximum in health, comfort, and economy—the
"New American" home is building a brighter future
for the cottage and the mansion.

IT WON'T BURN
Noninflammable and nonexplosive, this new cooling
and insulating liquid, Pyranol, was developed by
General Electric for use in transformers, capac-
itors, and cable. Its unusual characteristics have been
recognized by the National Electrical Code, making
it possible to install transformers indoors and at the
load centers, without fireproof vaults. This results in
savings in secondary copper and installation costs.
Pyranol is chemically stable and does not sludge, a
feature which minimizes maintenance. Experience to
date has showed that the materials used in Pyranol
transformers have a longer life than under oil. The
result—longer transformer life.
Pyranol transformers were first used in 1932, and
now more than 700 units, totaling more than 200.000
kva of transformer capacity, have been installed,
all giving excellent service.
