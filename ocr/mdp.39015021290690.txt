natural radar
The flying bat at night employs "nat-
ural radar" to avoid colliding with trees
and other obstacles. As the bat flies
through the air, it emits a constant
stream of high pitched cries, inaudible
except to specially constructed devices,
which permeate the space in front of
the animal. If there are any obstacles
out there, the sound is reflected or
echoed back. The bat hears these
echoes, changes its course, and flies into
regions which are echo-free.
calibrating with precision dies
New steel dies made by precision
pantographic milling are now being pro-
duced. By means of this method, it is
fairly easy to overcome the difficulty of
forming two or more parallel lines with
tolerance on the order of .001 inch.
This in turn enables the manufacturer
to produce much more accurate engrav-
ings than has previously been possible.
new plastic
A shatter-resistant plastic, which
self-seals bullet and flak holes and
makes possible pressurized cabins where
crews can function without oxygen
masks is now being used in the B-29
Superfortress.
plastic tools
A new self-hardening cast phenolic
plastic that is lighter than magnesium,
and has physical properties which make
it superior in many respects to alumi-
num and steel, is now taking the place
of metal machine tools and dies in the
production of aluminum aircraft parts.
The process of making tools with it is
declared to be "simple as baking a
cake." First, the Toolite is stirred by a
large cake mixer, and the catalyst (like
baking powder) is added slowly. Next,
the lacquered mold, usually made of
wood, plaster, or metal, is "buttered"
with wax and filled with the batter. The

Yes, zinc does double duty when applied to metals. It gives
mechanical protection, with a sheath of rust-resistant metal; the
durability depends on the thickness of the zinc. Zinc is also a rust
inhibitor — it literally "stops rust before it starts", through electro-
chemical action. The U.S. Bureau of Standards says Zinc is "by far
the best" protective metallic coating for rust-proofing iron or steel.
Lifetime Galvanized Roofing
With reasonable care, galvanized (zinc-coated) roof-
ing will last a lifetime. Its care is a simple matter—a
few precautions taken at the right time is all that is
necessary. These are fully described in a booklet,
"How to Make Galvanized Roofing Last Longer",
which will be sent free to anyone upon request. A
post-card will do—send it today.

The Thymotrol (the electronic device
previously mentioned) automatically
controls the speed of the carriage, pro-
viding slow speed for heavy cuts and
high speed for light cuts, thus drasti-
cally reducing the time required for
various milling and bevelling opera-
tions.
inside job
A new type portable milling machine,
21x22x5 ft. and weighing 16 tons is low-
ered into the new Victory ship in one
West Coast shipyard. This machine
mills to a 0.0015-mm tolerance the upper
surface of the top plate of reduction
gear foundations that have already been
welded into place. The unit is saving
about 600 man-hours on each ship, a job
which formerly kept a crew of twelve
machinists busy almost two weeks.
midget searchlight
A midget searchlight, no larger than
a walnut yet so powerful that it will
project a 1500 candle-power beam vis-
ible for 60 nautical miles, is a new
equipment item for rubber rafts. The
searchlight's current is generated by a
small hand-cranked generator. One-
half of the bulb is silvered to provide
a reflector, thus making the tiny lamp
a complete optical package in itself.
The new lamp provides the most pow-
erful beam ever obtained from such a
tiny incandescent unit.

A new triple-rated transformer with
two cooling systems. When rating of

pentolite
Maj. Gen. L. H. Campbell, Chief of
Army Ordnance, announced that a super
explosive called pentolite, 20 percent
more powerful than TNT, is being used
in rocket projectiles. A small quantity
of pentolite will penetrate five feet of
reinforced concrete. Besides providing
terrific punch for bazooka ammunition
and other rocket projectiles pentolite
also is employed in rifle grenades, anti-
tank explosives, certain types of artill-
ery shells, for demolition work, and for
clearing wrecked harbors. This ex-
plosive, which has been known since
1891, was considered too dangerous to
produce because it was so sensitive to
friction. Experts now have found a way
to use pentolite by mixing it with TNT,
thus producing safely enlarged quanti-
ties of the material for the rocket pro-
jectiles.
airport traffic light
A new light gun that will soon be
flashing signals to United Nations'
planes in all of the world's war zones is
now in production. The pull of a trig-
ger sends a 500,000 candlepower beam
of light a mile into the air; another pull
flashes a green or red stream of light.

Some Suggestions About
Your Future Career
Every young man with a job to do now—
whether it is training for the services, or
actually serving, as millions of you are—
looks forward to the day when he can begin
his career.
There are going to be many exciting
things to do.
From what we see ahead for aluminum,
may we venture a few suggestions?
You can learn a lot about the progressive-
ness of a future employer by finding out
what he is doing about using aluminum in
his business. For instance . . .
If you see a lot of aluminum on a new
product, that's a good line for you to sell.
If you see a lot of aluminum used in the
shop to make things light and easy to handle,
that's a good company to be with.
If you see a chance to make anything, or
sell anything, or work with anything made
of aluminum, you're going to be way out
in front.
This is how we see it at Alcoa . . . the first
name in Aluminum.

silenced to prevent information from
reaching the enemy, these light guns
will transmit information to our fliers

lights.
recording speeds of projectiles
A new system for recording speeds
of projectiles is now being used. To re-
cord the speed of a shell, for example, a
rectangular cage, which has a coil at
each end, is placed a few feet in front
of the gun. The coils in the cage are
spaced about one hundred feet apart
and are connected in series. The projec-
tile, which is magnetized, passes through
the open center of the coils and the
time interval required for its passage
from one coil to the other is recorded
on a chronograph's automatic type-
writer.
most powerful motor
in the world
The most powerful motor in the
world—powerful enough to hoist a de-
stroyer completely out of water and up
to the height of a IS story building, all
in a minute's time—is now being shipped
out to one of the country's biggest steel
mills. There it will run a reversing
rougher of a plate mill producing steel
plates for west coast shipyards and war
plants. Rated at 7000 horsepower and
with a shaft speed of 25 revolutions per
minute, the direct current motor weighs
approximately one million pounds,
stands 13 feet high and has an over-all
length of 44 feet.
marine railway holds destroyer
Largest side-haul marine railway in
the world has just been completed on
the West Coast. The marine railway
covers twelve acres and has twenty-four
steel rails which slope at a one to six
grade to a distance of 329 feet into the
Willamette River, ending at a depth of
forty feet below the mean low-water
level. It has 12 cradles mounted on
railway wheels which may be moved up
and down the track. When a ship comes
in for repairs it is floated into the basin
in front of the railway, made fast to
the cradles, and then pulled to dry land.
From there it is easily shifted into the
proper berth.

CONSIDER THE PIPING

Pr'fabricated'fuel oil condithn-
m| unit designed and con-
structed by Mid-West Heat
Service, Chicago, Illinois.
YOU MAY be working on a project as complicated
as this fuel oil conditioning unit. Perhaps you're
designing a simple pressure cooker—an irrigation sys-
tem—a hydro-electric plant—or any one of a thousand
other engineering projects. Whatever the problem,
they all have this in common: It takes piping to make
them work.
When you make a piping layout, remember that it
will have to be translated into solid metal—that the
proper kind of valves will have to be installed to meet
the service requirements—that fittings and bends-
traps and check valves, etc.—must be installed at proper
points in the line.
The parts that make up any piping system are many,
but it will interest you to know that everything in the
complete system is included in the Crane line.
By specifying Crane piping materials, you are as-
sured that a single source will save valuable time all
down the line. You are also assured that all parts will
fit, providing simpler assembly. Long, satisfactory op-
eration results in the high quality which characterizes
piping equipment carrying the name Crane.

THE GAS TURBINE
A STUDENT ARTICLE
The inherent simplicity of its design, together with its independence of water facilities and
auxiliaries, ideally adapts a gas turbine for certain classes of service, and it is toward such ends
that its present development is being directed.
T F simplicity, light weight, and prac-
■*■ tically no auxiliaries are the advan-
tages you are looking for in a prime
mover, the gas turbine is your answer.
But don't also expect good fuel econ-
omy, at least not of the gas turbine in
its present stage of development.
The hot-air engine has been one of
the favorite dreams of power engineers
even before the days of the internal
combustion engine. Although the gas
turbine has been the toy of Hero, Watt,
Newton, comic-strip artists, dreamers,
jet-propulsion enthusiasts and many
sane and capable engineers, there are
only a few in service right now. How-
ever, the gas turbine the way it is today
offers attractive possibilities for certain
applications on land, sea, and in the air.
The first, broad, practical application
of the gas turbine was the supercharger.
However, the difference between the
present gas turbine and the supercharger
is that the function of the supercharger
is to supply an internal combustion en-
gine with air at a greater density than
the surrounding atmosphere by utilizing
the waste heat of the engine exhaust but
without producing additional mechan-
ical power. A highly efficient com-
pressor and turbine were thus not as
essential as in the case of the gas tur-
bine where the energy produced by the
turbine must supply the power required
by the compressor and also power for
external utilization.
the gas turbine is simple
The fundamental directness of the
gas turbine power cycle, in which all
the hot gases of combustion are con-
ducted straight to the turbine, has
intrigued engineers for many years.
Leonardo da Vinci devised a crude
version. In 1791, John Barber, an Eng-
lishman, took out the first patent on a
turbine operated by gases. Since that
time there has been a continuous stream
of new developments.
Progress toward a practical gas tur-
bine power unit was delayed because,
in order to make it competitive with
the highly developed steam cycle, a high
thermal efficiency was required. In
order to achieve this end, we have to
have: (1) operation above 1000° F, (2)
a highly efficient compressor; 3) a high-
ly efficient turbine. Metallurgists, in
developing materials for turbo-super-
chargers have produced alloys that can
be expected to withstand at least 1200°
F continuous service at the lower oper-
ating pressures encountered in gas tur-
bine power units. In another seemingly
unrelated industry, aviation and wind
tunnel research on airplane propellers
have contributed very valuable aerody-
namic data on which new high efficiency

GAS TURBINE CYCLE

compressor designs are based. These
two facts plus knowledge of gases that
had been accumulated over many years,
made possible the new high-efficiency
turbine and compressor.
The gas turbine employs the simplest
power cycle known, consisting of three
major elements: a compressor, a com-
bustor, and a gas turbine. A general
idea of what the elements are like is
shown in Fig. J. The gas turbine re-
sembles the straight reaction, non-con-
densing steam turbine. The axial-flow
compressor also resembles a straight-re-
action turbine, with the gas to be com-
pressed passing axially through the
compressor. The combustor is the
burner in which the chemical energy of
the fuel oil is converted to heat energy
by burning the fuel with sufficient air
to obtain the desired temperature. The
hot product of combustion is the gas,
which, by expanding to a lower pressure
and temperature in the gas turbine, con-
verts some of its heat energy into me-
chanical energy at the turbine shaft.
The combustor is relatively small since
its rate of heat release is many times
that of the conventional steam boiler
which must transfer the heat through
tube walls to generate steam.
how cycle works
The combustion gas turbine cycle in
its basic form comprises three major
elements previously mentioned: com-
pressor, combustor, and gas turbine. In
addition to this it also requires: 1) an
electric generator, or shaft for the trans-
mission of the useful power output, and
2) a means of starting. This simple
arrangement is called the open cycle
system. To start a combustion gas tur-
bine, some external means, such as a
motor, is required. This is necessary
because the air needed for combustion
is supplied to the combustor by the
compressor. Once the unit is in opera-
tion the energy necessary to drive the
compressor comes from the expansion
of the products of combustion in the gas
turbine.
Thus the advantages of the gas tur-
bine cycle include: 1) no boiler is used,
2) water is not required for the simple
open-cycle system, 3) greater efficiency
improvement at higher temperatures,
and 4) rotating machine instead of the
familiar reciprocating engine. Present
disadvantages are: 1) low grade oil or
coal are not usable, and 2) need of time
to complete technical developments.
In the simple cycle operating at 1200°
F, the products of combustion (gas)
contain some 600 per cent excess air.

by
PROF. ORLAN W. BOSTON
Chairman of the Department of Metal Processing
Every production engineer should possess some basic knowledge about the problem of machin-
ability.
Prof. 0. W. Boston
Chairman &lt;of A.S.M.E. Committee
on Cutting Fluids.
MUCH has been heard of the prob-
lems of the War Production
Board regarding the manufacture of
equipment and supplies for our armed
forces. The layman hears of machines,
money, and the men. Little does he
realize the part played by the produc-
tion engineer and the tool engineer In
planning these operations. Maximum
production by any process is obtained
only by the proper co-ordination of
cutting tools, machine tools, and cutting
fluids with the cutting speeds and feeds,
adjusted to meet the characteristics
of the material to be machined. At
present manufacturing set-ups are often
based on previous experience. The
average machine output in our manu-
facturing plants is still far from a poss-
ible one hundred percent. The reason
for this is quite obvious when one con-
siders the many factors involved. The
principal desirable factors affecting
machinability and production are high
cutting speed (or long tool life), a high
rate of feeding the tool into the work,
good surface finish, and well broken up
chips. Dimensional accuracy and low
power consumption are desirable, but
not always essntial.
The elements affecting this machin-
ability are numerous. First, there is
the material to be machined; second,
the kind of cutting tool material that
can be used to machine it; third, the
material and shape of the tool is of vital
importance; fourth, the cutting fluid
greatly affects the performance of the
tool; fifth, the type of machine tool
doing the work or the process by which
the metal is removed, such as turning,
milling, drilling, threading, etc., require
special consideration.
Obviously, the average mechanic does
the best that he can with the tools and
information he is furnished, but unless
the set up man or production engineer
has a basic knowledge of the problems
of machinability, one can not tell how
efficient the job really is. For example,
changes in the cutting tool material and
form, the cutting fluids used as a cool-
ant, and the type and construction of
the material being machined can ac-
count for an over-all factor of more
than 1000% in production, i.e., one
machine can be made to do the work of
ten. The manner of application of the
cutting tools can make a difference in
excess of 100%. The type of tool ma-
terial used can affect production from
100% to 300%. The right coolant alone
may make a 30% difference in output,
and in some instances determine the
success or failure of the machining oper-
ation. The ratio of the feed to the
depth of cut alters the volume of metal
removal per tool grind up to 1000% and
greatly effects the production output.
A change of the material machined
as indicated on chart (Figure 1) makes
wide differences in power required and
permissible cutting speeds. Where
Monel metal requires from 1.8 net HP
at the tool point to remove one cubic
inch per minute, it has a relative ma-
chinability of only 20% based on that
of free cutting Bessemer steel screw
stock. Magnesium, on the other hand,
requires only .12 net HP to remove one
cubic inch per minute, and has a ma-
chinability rating of 1000% or better
compared with Bessemer screw stock.
The latter metal requires less than 1/10
of the power necessary to machine
Monel Metal, which makes it possible
to machine it at the proper high speed
on a machine tool powered with a
normal sized motor. The average run
of carbon and alloy steels requires about
1 HP at the tool point to remove one
cubic inch per minute and has a machin-
ability rating of from 50% to &amp;0%
based on that of Bessemer steel screw
stock.
When cutting casting or forgings to
scale, it is often necessary to use a zero
side cutting edge angle, so that the cut-
ting edge is perpendicular to the surface.
The tool cutting edge beneath the scale
causes the scale to crack ahead of the
cutting edge, and therefore prolongs its
life.
One thing is very evident from the
chart (Fig. 1) which many practical
men have observed but have been un-
able to evaluate, namely, that the metal
removed by a drill, a planing tool, or
a milling machine cutter varies with the
process for each metal. The power in
drilling is usually higher than that of
turning or planing because of the fric-
tion occurring between the chips and
the flutes of the drill as they are re-
moved from the hole because of the
action of the chisel edge of the drill. In
milling, the average power consumption
is higher primarily because of the re-
moval of the chips with very small av-
erage thickness. Thick chips are re-
moved more efficiently from a power
point of view than thin ones.
In the majority of cases, long tool
life is of the greatest importance in
metal cutting operations. Many times,
however, the production of a good sur-
face quality is of paramount importance.
In many operations long, stringy chips
are definitely objectionable as they tend
to mar the work surface, cause con-
gestion of the machine parts, and make
it very difficult for the operator to re-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


turret lathes, particularly, well broken
up chips are advantageous as they are
more easily handled and occupy less
volume.
Long tool life, low power, well broken
up chips, annd good surface quality are
seldom compatible, however, so that the
operator must select the structure of the
metal for a given analysis, the shape of
tool, the ratio of feed to depth, and the
type and application of the cutting
fluid to produce the results desired. Free
cutting brass and leaded free cutting
steel are two metals which combine
these desirable factors. The long,
stringy chips from low carbon steel
lower the tool life and are dangerous
for the machine operator to handle.
This material is best machined after it
is hardened or if it is cold drawn. Cold
drawing is a common method resorted to
for hardening the steel to improve tool
life, surface quality, and chip formation.
The addition of sulphur or selinium in
small quantities to the steel improves
these machinability factors by breaking
up the continuity of the ferrite, which is
soft and very ductile. Bessemer screw
stock, such as Bl 112 or as Bl 113, (the
latter containing still higher sulphur)
increases the permissible cutting speed
from 20% to 40%, or operated at the
same cutting speed will give increased
tool life of from 500% to 10,000%. The
surface quality is improved and the
chips are usually well broken. Medium
carbon steel in the hot rolled or an-
nealed condition has machining prop-
erties better than the low carbon steel

ENTERS THE FACTORY
by
CECIL C. CRAIG
Professor of Mathematics
More and more engineers are now beginning to realize the importance of industrial statistics.
IT IS true that for a good many years
large industrial organizations have
employed statisticians, but for the most
part the activities of these men have
been concerned with such matters as
sales analysis and studies of labor turn-
over. They have had little to do with
the actual production of articles in the
companies' factories. But my story is
about the emergence of a different kind
of statistician who ought to be at least
as much an engineer and practical pro-
duction man as he is statistician and
who can and does get his hands dirty on
the factory floor helping to get quantity
production of high quality and at low
cost. Everybody knows that many
changes in manufacturing are going to
be permanent results of our experiences
during the war and there is a fairly
numerous group of people, some of them
quite hard-headed, who insist that one
of the really significant ones will be the
general use of statistical methods in the
control of quality of articles manufac-
tured by repetitive processes.
It is also true that these methods
were not really new in 1940. They got
their start in the brain of Dr. W. A.
Shewhart of the Bell Telephone Labora-
tories and in practical experience in the
Western Electric Company around 1926.
Dr. Shewhart's ideas worked, certain
quality control problems were solved
with very worthwhile savings in money,
labor, and materials. He published pa-
pers on these new developments in Bell
Telephone System Technical Reports;
in 1931 his book, The Economic Con-
trol of Quality of Manufactured Prod-
uct, appeared; and word did get around.
General Electric and Westinghouse tried
and made gradually increasing use of
Shewart's new methods and they se-
cured a place in some of the large steel
companies, in some textile plants, and in
other places. The news spread across
the Atlantic and in England more expe-
rience was accumulated, particularly in
the textile industry. Lieutenant L. A.
Simon (now Lieutenant-Colonel), a
young army ordnance man, became in-
terested and, beginning with his work
at the Picatinny Arsenal, made one of
the outstanding success stories of sta-
tistical methods applied to quality con-
trol. Many practical men got their first
information from the A.S.T.M. Manual
on the Presentation of Data which first
appeared in 1933. That is, by 1940
there had been secured a more than ade-
quate body of practical experience in a
variety of industries for the advocates
of the new methods to be sure that their
feet were on solid ground.
Though it surprises young people, it
seems as a rule to take anywhere from
15 years up for a new idea, no matter
how practical and valuable, to gain gen-
eral acceptance and wide application.

counted for by several rather common
misconceptions, some of which are: (1)
Statistical quality control methods are
mathematically technical, theoretical,
not for the practical man. (2) These
methods are designed to replace existing
means for the control of quality which
were already good enough to give Ameri-
can industry leadership in that very re-
spect. (3) Installation would interfere
with the existing flow of production and
would mean increased personnel. (4)
These methods are to be used only in
case inspection is done by sampling.
Let us have a look at the essentially
simply way in which Shewart's princi-
pal device, the control chart, works.
This is by no means the only aid statis-
tics has to offer in the control of qual-
ity, but it is the surprisingly versatile
tool which can be put to use with rela-
tively little training and which has been
responsible for the great bulk of results
which have impressed management.
The underlying law of nature on
which the control chart is based is sim-
ply that summed up in the popular but
ordinarily little understood phrase, "The
Laws of Chance." It seems to many at
first a far cry indeed from the laws of
chance to present day precision manu-
facturing, but let me state an equiva-
lent fact which anybody who makes
precision measurement knows to be as
true as the law of gravitation—No two
things can be made exactlv alike. What

using the most perfect ammunition,
held in a machine rest, will scatter shots
over a reasonably distant target? The
process of getting a dimension on a ma-
chined part within the very close toler-
ances common today presents a close
analogy to shooting at a small target
with a rifle. One of the real facts of life
in quality control work is that finished
products will always show residual vari-
ations in quality.
The role of the laws of chance in the
control of quality is easier to see in an-
other important common situation. Here
inspection of articles is of the Go, No-
Go variety; each piece is simply passed
or rejected. Suppose that the process
turns out on the average 1% of defec-
tives and inspection is on lots of 200.
Does this mean that each lot will con-
tain exactly 2 defectives? Of course it
does not. Some lots will show no defec-
tives, many will contain one or two, but
still others will have three, four, or even
more faulty pieces in them. If the arti-
cles going into lots to be inspected have
been subject to no selection, then one
cannot say with any certainty how many
rejects will be found in any one lot.
Moreover, if one looks at the record for
10 successive lots, one is not likely to
see anything at all systematic in the ap-
pearance of the figures. But if one
should tabulate the results for 100 or
more lots a pattern will emerge which
will illustrate the working of a very im-
portant law of chance, well-known for
200 years. This law in this case (for
lots of 200 from a process averaging
1% defective) states that in the long
run about 13% will show no rejects,
about 27% will disclose 1 defective,
27% 2 defectives, 18% 3, 9% 4, 4%
5, and 1% 6 defectives.
This law of chance was first discov-
ered in connection with games of chance.
It applies to the number of heads one
gets in tossing coins or to the number of
defective bottles one finds in a gross
taken from the packers for a check in-
spection. Last spring I saw 75 selected
employees of the world's largest glass
container manufacturer very much in-
terested in a demonstration which
consisted of repeatedly drawing a stated
number of beads from a supply contain-
ing red and white beads in given pro-
portions. Afterwards an old-time hard-
headed factory manager who had been
skeptical before came up and said that
what he saw sold him. This kind of
scene has been repeated many times
during the last two years with groups
chosen by management of industries of
many different kinds all over the United
States.
It is not hard to conceive that if one
could completely analyze from start to
finish all of the circumstances that led
to getting just 3 defectives in a lot of
200 on a particular occasion, instead of
some other number, one would wind up
with a very long list of contributing
causes, each one of which behaves in a
random fashion, acting in one way one
time and in another way another time.
The end result, the number of defectives
in the lot, is the accumulated effects of
what is actually a very complicated
cause system. Without trying to be very
precise and avoiding technicalities, if
the elementary causes are large in num-
ber and are all comparable in size of
effect, if each behaves in a random man-
ner, and if the same set is operative
from one lot to the next, the end results
will behave in accordance with a per-
fectly definite law of chance.
This is really a tremendously im-
portant idea for the whole field of sci-
entific investigation and not merely for
its applications to industry. But the
reader may already see that the varia-
tion in a dimension of a precision ma-
chined part, in the weight of a piston,
in the time for a fuse to blow, in the
tensile strength of a forging, in fact in
any quantitatively measurable quality
characteristic of any article produced
by a repetitive process can be explained
as the end result of just such a cause
system. On p. 14 is a typical tabulation
of the results of such measurements of a
number of pieces of such an article.
Now 100 or 200 is not a large enough
sample for one to infer with complete
accuracy what long run performance will
be. But perhaps this example will make
plausible the actual fact that the typical
curve which represents the law of chance
operative for measurable quality charac-
teristics has the form shown in Figure
2. This is known as the normal frequen-
cy curve. It has two important constants
connected with it: its center and its
spread. The first is calculated as the
ordinary average; the second, though it
is also a kind of average, is most sim-
ply described as the horizontal distance
between the center and the point of in-
flection on the curve. Since no manu-
facturing process produces identical prod-
ucts and cannot in the nature of things,
what shall we require of an ideal pro-
cess? Shewhart pointed out that the
proper answer is that the residual varia-
tion in each quality characteristic shall
follow a stable, definite distribution law
of the kind shown. If the underlying
source of variation is of the sort de-
scribed, it is said that the variation
arises from a constant cause system and
production is under statistical control.
Then the process will maintain a stable
center, the process average, and the
variation will also be a stable quantity,
measured by the spread mentioned
above which is usually denoted by the
symbol &lt;r, and called the standard devi-
ation. Now one more important fact
about such distribution curves will en-
able us to understand the essential
principle of the control chart and the
way it works to aid in the control of
quality during production. This is that
from tables one can read off the per-
centages of area under the curve from
the center out to a given multiple of a.
In particular, one finds that of random
deviations due to a constant cause sys-
tem, as is illustrated in Figure 2, 68%
fall within one o- of the center, 95%
within two &lt;r of the center, and, espe-
cially to be noted, 99.7% within a
three-(T band about the center.
The practical working principle is
simply that for a properly functioning
manufacturing process, one operating at
its best, all deviations will come within
a definite 3-v band of a definite center;
if they do not we do not have produc-
tion under a constant cause system with
only purely random variation. If previ-
ously there has been a state of control
then something has happened to the
process. When a deviation falls outside
the 3-&lt;r band, i.e., outside the "control
limits," it does so for a specific non-
random cause, relatively large in its ef-
fect which can be identified and re-
moved. The control chart is a device by
which one can find without delay the

1855-1944
Dean Emeritus Mortimer E. Cooley,
Michigan's "Grand Old Man" and hon-
orary member of the Engineering So-
ciety of Detroit, died in Ann Arbor on
Friday, August 25, 1944, in his 89th
year. He had been hospitalized for al-
most a year in order to provide the ex-
pert services and facilities needed for his
care. But though the frailties of his age
inevitably cramped his movements,
nothing ever dimmed his spirit, and up
to the last his visitors found him sitting
at ease in a big chair with a favorite
cigar and all his great fund of stories
ready on call. His room frequently re-
sounded with hearty laughter as he and
the medical staff traded keen repartee
concerning the respective merits of engi-
neering and medicine.
Dean Cooley entered Annapolis from
his home in Canandaigua, N. Y., in
1874 as a cadet engineer, and graduated
in 1878. In 1881 he was detailed by the
Navy to join the University with the
title of Professor of Steam Engineering
and Iron Shipbuilding, which unique
phrasing always pleased him immensely.
In his academic career Mortimer E.
Cooley became Dean of the College of
Engineering of the University of Michi-
gan in 1903 and served as such until his
retirement in 1928. Thus as a professor
and administrator his services to the
University covered a period of 47 years.
During his administration four new de-
partments were added in the College of
Engineering, viz., Architecture and
Architectural Engineering (established
as a separate school in 1930), Aeronau-
tical Engineering and Geodesy and Sur-
veying. In this period the enrollment in
the college increased from 823 under-
graduates and 7 graduate students to
1715 undergraduates and 81 graduates.
The Dean insisted that engineers should
be broadly trained, and he maintained a
block of 16 hours in each curriculum
devoted to non-technical courses. For
many years this generally involved the
students taking up to the fourth course
in some one of the modern foreign lan-
guages. He also stressed the duty of the
engineer as a citizen and strove to de-
velop more active participation by engi-
neers in public affairs and administra-
tion. As a teacher and counselor he cre-
ated the "Cooley tradition" for thous-
ands of Michigan men who came in con-
tact with him. "Hew to the line," said
the Dean, "let the chips fall where they
may.''
Professionally the Dean was highly
honored for his pioneer work in the ap-
praisal of public utilities. Always active
in professional organizations, he served
as president to the American Engineer-
ing Council, the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers, the Society for
the Promotion of Engineering Educa-
tion, and the Michigan Engineering So-
ciety, and as Vice President of the
American Society of Civil Engineers. He
held membership in many other organi-
zations. He has been specially honored
with such awards as the Navy Service
Medal, the Sampson Medal and the
Washington Award for distinguished
service to the profession. .
Notwithstanding his fellow engineers'
appreciation of this glorious record in
all its versatility and attainment, Dean
Cooley lives in the hearts of Michigan
men because of his great courtesy and
kindness, the.warmth of his smile and
his supreme spirit of good fellowship.
In the great changes taking place in
Ann Arbor he was a constant factor and
anchor for all returning graduates. The
Dean could well say with Abou Ben Ad-
hem, "Write me as one that loves his
fellow men."

storm boats
When you read a communique that
our troops have forced a crossing over
some water barrier such as the Rhine,
in the face of determined resistance, the
odds are good that the Engineers put
'em across in a speedy, little plywood
"waterbug," officially called the Storm
Boat.
The Storm Boat is a striking weapon
used to throw a spearhead of assault
troops across a wide stream, inlet, or
lake before bridges can be built and
when the element of surprise is impossi-
ble. Carrying a fighting team of seven
fully equipped riflemen commanded by
a "non-com," and a crew of two, its SO
horsepower motor will drive it at 20 to
23 miles per hour, a speed which, with
its low lines and great maneuverability
permitting quick evasive action, make it
a difficult target. On the return trip
with a load of only its two-man crew, it
will hit up to 35 miles per hour.
The "passengers" lie face down, head
to bow, rifle in hand, and leap out, ready
for action, the instant the boat touches
shore. The landing may be a simple
slowing down at the river bank up which
the assault troops scramble or, if the
shore is reasonably low and shelving,
the light craft may be beached head on
at full speed, its powerful motor often
toboganning it high and dry.
Not intended for surf or rough water,
the Storm Boat, fully loaded, draws only
16 inches while underway; 20, when
motionless. The outboard motor tilts
up, away from damage, as the boat is
beached.
Having completed its primary purpose
of "putting 'em across" to establish a
beachhead, the Storm Boat scoots back
at high speed to ferry reserve supplies
of ammunition, gasoline, and other vital
stores. Thereafter, it can be used for
liaison and other chores. A busy boat!
In addition to its crew, its most ef-
ficient cargo capacity is 1,500 pounds.
Heavier loading sacrifices speed.
The boat, which is 16 feet, 9 inches
long, by 6 feet, 6 inches wide, weighs
450 pounds, to which is added 200
pounds of motor. It is manned by two
trained Engineer operators. One han-
dles the motor and navigates. The other,
who occupies a position in the bow dur-
sion, an important factor when the for-
cible beaching of the craft is considered.
White oak, laminated or solid, and
shaped by steam bending is used in the
stem. The chines and inside keel bat-
ten and floor batten are mahogany.
The bottom and side planking is
quarter-inch, five-ply plywood, a sin-
gle strake on each side re-inforcing the
bottom and absorbing some of the abra-
sion. The square stern transom, which
supports the motor, is half-inch, five-
ply flat plywood.
The gunwales are oak riveted to the
plywood sides. Handrails" are one-inch
round hickory with support blocks
spaced on one foot centers.

The "passengers" lie face down
ing the crossing, helps re-launch it for
the return trip, and acts as liaison with
the Infantry, meeting the troops at
some inland rendezvous and guiding
them to the embarkation point.
The boats are brought to the em-
barkation point by truck, nested in
groups of four for transportation on
two-wheeled trailers.
From the trucks, parked in a screened
position, the "passengers" and crew
carry the boats to the point on the shore
whence the attack is to be launched.
Convenient handholes are provided in
the gunwale for the purpose. Needless
to say, teamwork and timing are the
essence.
The Storm Boat is constructed of flat
and molded plywood, birch being speci-
fied for the outer bottom and sides, with
the grain running parallel to the keel.
Birch is a hard wood, resistant to abra-
The floor, forming a double bottom,
is a single piece of ^-inch, five-ply ply-
wood, the grain of its face plies running
across the hull. To minimize slipperness
when the inside floor is wet, a finish
coat of non-skid deck paint of the best
grade used in good marine practice, is
applied.
The Storm Boat is subjected to rugged
tests. It is run over a measured mile
course at maximum throttle to deter-
mine its speed and performance under
light, intermediate, and full loads. With
a load of not less than 1,200 pounds, it
is run head on to a gravel or sand
beach after a running start of 150 yards
to assure maximum speed.
When it has passed that "induction"
examination, the Engineers are satis-
fied that it rates "1-A" and start it to-
ward the front.

Eng. Mech. Prof. Hagerty, the man
who claims to be the world's greatest
beer drinker, as well as the world's best
father, (his son was the Michigan
Technic cover girl in March 1944) is
now telling about the remarkable intel-
ligence of the above-mentioned offspring.
It seems that Prof. Hagerty was flat on
his back fixing the family auto one day.
Hagerty Jr. who was playing around in
the front seat of the aforesaid vehicle
started the car, ran over Hagerty Sr.,
and would undoubtedly have reached
Minnesota if the garage wall had not
intervened. Commenting on the inci-
dent, Prof. Hagerty said, "Now there's
a smart kid for you, no one ever showed
him how to run a car."
The Student Branch of the
A.S.M.E. has been quite ac-
tive this summer, having
meetings on alternate Wednesdays.
A joint meeting was held with the
A.I.E.E. on October 4. Mr. James W.
Parker, President of the Detroit Edison
Company, was the speaker.
At their September 20, meeting the
A.S.M.E. elected officers for the fall
term. Those elected were:
John Blowney—Chairman
Silvio Mayo—Vice-Chairman
Carl Knapp—Secretary-Treasurer
Robert Precious—Council Represen-
tative

Due to the conditions imposed by the
war, the Engineering Council is not as
active today as it was in pre-war days.
At present, its main functions include
coordinating the activities of the var-
ious societies and clubs and seeking for
ways to make the Honor System more
effective.
In this latter endeavor, the Council,
realizing that the Honor System is being
carried out with only a limited part of
the success it previously enjoyed, has,
with Dean Emmons' help, devised a
plan which shall shortly go before the
faculty. More will be said about it at
that time.

With the start of the fall semester
many of the Engineering societies will
be rejuvenated by the influx of new and
returning students. A.I.Ch.E., I.Ae.S..
the Vulcans and the Triangles, all will
be active next semester. Not the least
to be benefitted by the influx of new
students will be the Society for Women
Engineers. Ten per cent (one dozen of
'em) of the 120 entering engineering
freshmen will be women.
gj. &lt;g&gt;_ A.S.C.E. has been very suc-
jf mx cessful and active this sum-
mer. Joint meetings with other
student professional societies were
among the innovations in its first active
summer term. One of the main meetings
was held on the banks of the Huron. Ex-
periments were conducted there in con-
nection with the rather inferior muni-
cipal beer supply, both with respect to
quality and quantity, in a certain
American University city. As finals
approach A.S.C.E. may suspend activi-
ties, but a strong nucleus of old mem-
bers plans to form a very active group
next term.
The A.I.E.E. has again
'come through with a success-
ful and eventful season. The
following were among the highlights in
the term's activities.
On Sept. 6, Mr. Walter C. Smith, En-
gineer of Foreign Wire Relations for
the Michigan Bell Telephone Co., gave
an interesting lecture and demonstration
of interference with telephone signals
by induced voltages caused by adjacent
power lines and methods of eliminating
it.
The summer's activities were climaxed
by the election of officers for the fall
term. Those elected were:
Wayne Middleton—Chairman
Donald Davie—Vice-Chairman
Eugene Hanysz—Secretary
Jerome Drozin—Treasurer
Jess Santo—Council Representative

Intoxicated Press Dispatch.
Ann Arbor, Michigan. It was reliably
reported by our A- correspondent that
in accordance with Hallowe'en tradition,
a witch was seen riding a broom along
the University of Michigan Diagonal.
Dean Lloyd (Dean of Women) was re-
ported ready to conduct an investigation
which, it is rumored, will center about
Stockwell Hall. This move, the rumor
goes on to say, was instigated by an
unsigned letter sent to Dean Lloyd and
postmarked West Quad. The letter
lauded the bewitching charms of Stock-
^6

well's inmates and also stated that the
author was a fleet man who had just
returned from Ypsilanti and had not
seen a white woman for over two years.
Well that explains it!
The ghostly, if not ghastly, antics
were not confined to the Co-eds on
campus, however. Two freshmen en-
gineers, while experimenting with an
electrical calculator had, upon dividing
pi by zero, conjured up a mathematical
genie. This representative of the spirit
world (not the kind you have to have
a liquor card to belong to) hinted
vaguely about his part in the writing
of Love's "Differential and Integral
Calculus" and maintained, despite fre-
quent applications of a steel tipped
whip, that he had received an A from
Professor Kazarinoff.
There have also been numerous re-
ports about pink elephants and green
and white submarines but as these are
rampant throughout the entire year
(this is due to the influx of anti-dry
students) they are not worth listing at
this time.
The football season being in full
swing, now may be a good time to delve
into our store of football anecdotes, and
past U. of M. football personalities. We
will not here concern ourselves with well
known personalities like Harmon, Daley

hi ^/«./».
»'&lt;,« -«.A^a&gt;
et al, but rather with the lesser known
heroes of the gridiron. The unnamed
dog, for example, (that is to say there
is nothing the umpires didn't call him,
but he had never been formally named
as far as we could find out) who held
up a game for over five minutes- last
year as the umpires chased him across
the opposition's goal line amidst the
cheers of the U. of M. crowd. And the
wolverine at the University Zoo who
has been forced, on occasion, to sit and
snarl his pride while some U of M star,
of whom he (the wolverine) had.never
heard, crashed through our opponent's
line.
But there are human interest stories
as well as those about animals. (We
only mentioned the animals first as a
belated recognition of "Be Kind to
Animals Week.")
The ones about the boys with hip
flasks and raccoon coats. We don't see
as many of those as we used to. (At
least as far as the raccoon coats are con-
cerned, for we hear that Ulrich's is now
featuring a combination slide rule and
flask for football loving engineers.) And
those unnamed heroes who swallowed
goldfish to show their love for alma
mater. There aren't many of those
around either. (If they continue selling
those same hamburgers around town,
however, many will have to resort to
eating goldfish as a means of suste-
nance.) No, we're afraid things aren't
as they used to be. Perhaps reminisc-
ing wasn't too good an idea after all.
You can't blame it on the war either.
There are plenty of goldfish and rac-
coons in town, and whisky is available
if one knows where to look. Well I
guess we'll just have to stick to good
oF beer and potato chips. Pass over a
couple of glasses, Mac, and YEA
MICHIGAN!!!
Finals, we fear, are a necessary evil.
In order to understand their background
therefore, we had one of our staff con-
duct an extensive research on finals. He
was assigned to find out who originated
them.
As far as our reporter could deter-
mine, a crazy Greek schoolteacher was
the first person to use finals. Our
prodigy discovered that in the year 700
B.C. Popolopolous Dimwitisous (the
teacher) had a very unruly class. In
order to punish the students, he gave a
two-day final in each course. (And we
complain about two hour finals.) Popo-
lopolous drove so many in his class nuts
in this manner, that he decided to give
finals every year. The Athenian Slab of
Education (boards were not popular in
those days) so strongly supported the
idea, that it ordered; all Greek traders
to spread this system far and wide along
the shores of the Huron and the Medi-
terranean. The Greeks, who are known
for their salesmanship, sold the local
yokels, Deanosaurus Crawfordibus and
Emmonstrainius, on the idea, and thus
enabled finals to become a habit which
has lasted till this very day.

A scholarly mountaineer is William
R. Powers. Although he is a native of
Pottsville Pa., Bill has also resided in
West Virginia whence comes his nick-
name "Luke" after the well known
squirrel gun toting citizen of this state.
Luke's prep school was Greenbriar Mili-
tary School, where his contribution to
posterity was made on the rifle team
which won the Hearst trophy.
At Michigan Bill seems to have made
a hobby of Greek letter collecting, be-
ing a member of Tau Beta Pi, Phi
Lambda Upsilon and Vulcans as well as
Kappa Sigma Fraternity. As evidence
that the draft is working well, he is the
last Kappa Sig left on the campus.
Chemical Engineering is Bill's field
with the emphasis on distillation.

William R. Powers
"scholarly mountaineer"
In order that his spare time would
not be wasted, he has been working in
the foundry lab for Engineering Re-
search, and used to spend his remain-
ing available time doing a bang-up job
as business manager of the TECHNIC.
Incidentally we thought there might
be trouble when we saw Bill heading
for East Engine with a fuse hanging
out of his pocket, so, to protect our
safe, we just chucked his last keg of
home-made guncotton out'of the office
window.
Bill's attitude toward Ann Arbor beer
is, to say the least, quite critical. His
views on this subject, accurate though
they may be, cannot be aired in this
column. Being a man of action, Bill is
founder and president of the organiza-
tion known as Fermentation and Frac-
tionation Unlimited. Unfortunately, due
to the prevalence of revenueers, produc-
tion has left much to be desired.
After graduation this fall, Bill has
his heart set on taking his squirrel gun
down to the Bahamas where he will
hunt wild boar.
However, it is probable that the man
with the whiskers will soon express the
desire that gun toting Luke shoulder a
gun as one of his G. I. Joes.

According to the boys, there is one
man in the Engine School who possesses
the ability to keep his students awake
during his lectures, and even to fasci-
nate them. His name is Mr. Edward G.
Shideman.
Born near Albion way back in the
1890's, at the end of the last century,
he spent his early life not far from Ann
Arbor. There he went to grade school
and high school. His university career
terminated abruptly with the outbreak
of the first World War. The United
States had not been in the war for a
week when the War Department was
able to announce the enlistment of Pri-
vate Shideman. After 22 months in
the service, he had in his pocket $6.32,
all that was left from his wartime earn-
ings.
The maxim "No money—no educa-
tion" was recited to him wherever he
knocked on college doors. And so Vet-
eran Shideman decided to take a job
for a few months, determined later to
put in the two years remaining to com-
plete his technical training.
However, as is often the case, going
back to school proved to be harder than
it seemed in the beginning. Many years
slipped by before he was actually able to
fulfill his desire to obtain a sheepskin
with his name on it, a desire to make
his hobby his life work. During these
years he had acquired a wife and four
children. His chance finally came with
the illness of his son George, when on
the doctor's advice the family moved to
Florida.
In 1937, the University of Florida
allowed him to enter the upper division
of its engineering college. Perseverance
had triumphed, and at long last, the man
whose lifelong hobby had been machine
design obtained a certificate officially
acknowledging that he was a Mechani-
cal Engineer, 20 years after he had first
left school, at the age of 40, and as the
head of a large family.
In 1941, Mr. Shideman joined the
faculty of our M. E. department. He
chose this work, he says, because he
likes boys, and because he likes to teach
them almost as much as he likes to de-
sign. Shideman believes that if the boys
like his methods of teaching, it is due

to the fact that his experiences with his
own teachers have been so recent. His
popularity can be explained in a num-
ber of ways. One of his pastimes is the
reading of books on civics, public af-
fairs, history, as well as on education
and psychology. The knowledge gained
he well knows how to apply in his class
work.
When his children's names are men-
tioned to Mr. Shideman his eyes light
up with fatherly pride, and he would

you can also see pride in his eyes when
the talk turns to his students, and their
accomplishments. There is nothing he
likes more than to show his visitors
drawings of machines which his students
have designed, and to praise their work.
He calls the students "his boys."
Mr. Shideman is leaving the Univer-
sity at the end of this semester. How-
ever, his plans are not definite yet. We
are sorry to see you go, Mr. Shideman.
elusive vagabond
If you ever call Dick Bard and are
told that he is out of town, don't get
angry; you are not getting a polite
brushoff for he probably is away. When-
ever he has accumulated enough money
and can find the time, he goes to New
York. The interesting feature of this
story is that his home is not in New
York but in Thornwood, which is about
thirty miles from that great city. As one
can easily guess, the reason for his
vagabondism is a woman, in this case a
student nurse.
Dick will graduate in October with
the degree of B.S.E. in Ch.E. He has
been a member of Tau Beta Pi for three
semesters and is now its president. Phi
Eta Sigma, Phi Lambda Epsilon, and
Phi Kappa Phi have also conferred
membership upon him. He plays the
clarinet and has been a member of the
University Band for 3 years. When
Dick came here in 1941 he intended to

extent, but has not been able to do so
due to his other activities.
Although Dick may not make en-
gineering his life work, he is getting his
licks in now as an official of the Barber-
ton Chemical Company, Inc. Barberton,
a closed corporation formed by Dick
and his two design partners, was or-
ganized to function under the sweat-
shop auspices of Chemco, Inc., the
hypothetical firm through which the
Chem. Eng. Dept. tortures its seniors.
After October 21 Barberton will dissolve
(with pleasure) since its three officials
could hardly carry on business in the
Navy.
The immediate future of Dick's life
is under the control of his draft board,
but after the war, he intends to come
back to Michigan for a liberal educa-
tion and to do some graduate work in
chemistry.
If not for the war, he would have
taken a liberal arts course before study-
ing engineering. The need for engineers
made him decide to let the liberal edu-
cation go for a while. Dick believes that
after the war men with a broad educa-
tion will be needed as much as those
with technical training so he intends to
have both. The man with a good liberal
education will be better prepared to re-
build a world which will prevent present
conditions from recurring.

THE ELECTRIC FURNACES MELTING
• . TO KEEP
ALL of us, men or women—on
the job or off it—are people
with a mission these days. The war
makes common cause for every one
and spares no one.
This maintenance man's job,
atop an Allegheny Ludlum electric
furnace, is no less essential than
that of the crew who operate the
furnace, nor than that of the men
in the factories who use the stain-
less, tool, valve or electrical steel
it produces. Total war requires
maximum cooperation on the sup-
ply fronts as well as the fighting
fronts, and it asks also that every
last bit of manpower and materials
be used to the maximum advantage.
Boiled down to a very few words
that simply means: no waste—every-
body help. It means, in terms of
your everyday life, using everything
wisely to secure the most wear;
reducing expenditures to a mini-
mum; saving materials; buying War
Bonds and stamps to the limit.
It also points up a responsibility
that falls upon you as one of the
next generation of business men
and technicians. War is the ultimate
waster of men and materials, but it
brings about enormous technical
progress and development. That
has been very true in the special
steel fields. It will be yours to trans-
late these advances into terms of
better living.

electrical "guinea pigs"
Every branch of science and engi-
neering has its "guinea pig." For the
aeronautical engineer it is the model
plane and wind tunnel; for the naval
architect it is the model ship and naval
tank; and for the electrical engineer it
is the network calculator.
Since 1929, when a-c calculators were
first made available, engineers have
taken advantage of this ingenious engi-
neering tool to solve many electrical
problems associated with the design and
operation of electrical power systems.
These solutions have resulted in eco-
nomies that follow from maximum utili-
zation of existing equipment, better
service continuity, and assurance that
capital expenditures, when necessary,
will adequately fulfill system require-
ments.
The calculator's master instrument
panel records voltage, current, and
power distribution.
Now, the a-c network calculator
is a practical, miniature power system
whereby an actual or contemplated elec-
trical network can be established in a
small scale to permit the study and an-
alysis of operating or design problems.
To accomplish this, the various branches
of the electrical network are represented
by a proportional number of variable
resistors, reactors, and capacitors ad-
justed to corresponding proportional
network values. For example, shunt
loads are represented by similar resistors
and reactors or capacitors with interpos-
ing transformers. Synchronous apparatus
involving phase and magnitude of gen-
erated or bus voltage and power output
are represented by static, adjustable,
artificial generators. As illustrated in
the cut below, each of the several cal-
culator elements terminate in flexible
Each of the calculator units consists of
a maze of resistance and reactance ele-
ments.
connectors that can be plugged into a
series of bus receptacles to reproduce
the desired system connections. Meas-
uring instruments are provided to per-
mit reading voltage, current, power, and
phase differences for the many elements
of the calculator.
Voltages, currents, power, and phase
differences that would exist in the act-
ual system are determined by measur-
ing like quantities in the calculator cir-
cuits and applying multiplying factors
fixed by the scale ratio to which the net-
work has been set up. The electrical
conditions in an existing or proposed
system can thus be readily observed.
Generally four classes of problems
govern the use of such a calculator.
Among the most common are;
1. Load Division Problems involving
circuit loading, corrective condenser ca-
pacity, optimum transformer ratings,
and the ideal location of generation fa-
cilities.
2. Short-Circuit Problems involving
balanced and unbalanced faults.
3. Miscellaneous Circuit Problems
such as, optimum design and starting
characteristics for large motors, and un-
balanced unsymmetrical three-phase sys-
tems.
4. Stability Problems involving steady-
state and transient limits.
Regardless of the type of problem,
the system of analysis on the calculator
follows the same general pattern. First,
the nature of the problem to be investi-
gated is outlined in a logical manner to
minimize set-up time on the calculator.
Then a single-line diagram of the sys-
tem is prepared showing all essential
circuits that have a bearing on the pro-
posed study (see cut).
Next, the actual system impedance
data is converted to percent of per unit
impedance on a common kilo-volt am-
pere base such as 100,000 kva or even
multiples thereof. These values are used
to set up the system and the calculator in
accordance with the single line diagram.
The calculator is then "loaded" by ad-
justing the values of load impedances
and generator outputs as set forth in the
outline of the problem to be investi-
gated. A master instrument panel re-
cords voltage and current distributions,
associated power factors, and active

All of the essential circuits that have a bearing on the proposed study are indicated
on a single-line diagram, and the calculator is set up accordingly.

Mica's special insulating qualities are mighty important in communica-
tions equipment. No equivalent exists, so war's huge demands caused a
critical shortage.
Bell Telephone Laboratories' scientists were assigned the task of some-
how finding more mica. They found it—in the very considerable amounts
of raw mica which visual inspection had rejected. By developing electrical
apparatus to test the two most important electrical properties, they in-
creased the usable amount of mica by half and so stretched current sup-
plies of mica to fill all military needs.
In many such ways the Bell System is serving the nation, constantly
meeting the needs of our fighting forces for dependable communications.

and reactive power distributions. These
results are then converted to actual sys-
tem values and analyzed to determine
what system changes would be required
to insure the maximum utilization of the
existing equipment and improved serv-
ice continuity.
With improved technique in calcu-
lator operation and with increased fa-
cilities for rapidly obtaining calculator
readings, the time required for the solu-
tion has been materially reduced. This
permits the power engineer to analyze
the results during the progress of the
study so that the board has an active
part in system planning instead of sim-
ply being a check upon completed plans.
post-war landing strips
By now most people have concluded
that there will be many airplanes in the
post-war world. They foresee a plane
in every garage and assume that much
has already been "done to bring this
about. This is true, but most of what
has been done concerns the airplane it-
self. There are, however, also many
other considerations.
The air strip is one of the most im-
portant of these. The great majority of
people don't want a plane just to fly
around in on Sunday afternoons. They
want to use it as they used their auto-
mobiles before the war, for business as
well as for pleasure. If this is to be
made possible, it will be necessary to
build many air strips in many places.
With the great number of post-war
planes a few widely scattered big air-
ports will not be adequate. The family
plane will be useless without a great
number of smaller air strips.
Aviation is in about the same position
that the automobile industry was in
in 1918. We had the materials, the man-
power, and' the production facilities to
produce the cars at a low cost, but we
lacked the roads on which to run them.
That is also true today; we have every-
thing except the air strips needed for
landing. However, this time the job
will be easier and less expensive. The
cost of a system of air strips will be
much less than that of our present na-
tional highway system. This will hardly
touch the taxpayer's pocketbook. The
estimated cost of all the air strips needed
is 90 million dollars, less than twice the
cost of New York's La Guardia Airport.
Modern highways cost about $25,000
for a single mite. In other words, th?
money spent for only 3,600 miles of
highway, a very small part of our pres-
ent system, would pay for the entire
network of fields.
At the end of the war we shall have
about 3,000 airports. All of these are
big ports capable of handling heavy
ships. They can be compared with
Grand Central Station. However, small
towns can't afford these large ports.
Besides, the small plane owner will not
be interested in the elaborate set up of
such an air field. The heavy traffic con-
ditions at such a port would put him at
a disadvantage. What he needs is an
air strip. This the small town can af-
ford. Land on the outskirts of town
with little commercial value could be
used. Good, well drained turf is satis-
factory, and economical for the landing
strip of a small community that has
l'ght traffic. It is also entirely possible
that a strip can pay its own way, if it
becomes a community project.
There now arises the question, "Of
what does an air strip consist?" It must
not be confused with an airport. The
post-war family plane will not need the
gear on the post-war plane will enable
one to make safe cross wind landings.
Studies show that about 20,000 air
strips will be needed. One proposed
plan would divide the country into a
checkerboard of squares ten miles on a
side, having a landing field at each cor-
ner. Of course, mountains, swamps,
and other obstructions will interfere,
but the strips would follow the pattern
as closely as possible. The interval of
ten miles was selected because a minute
of latitude or longiture is approxi-
mately ten miles. The fields in this
pattern would serve as aerial markers
or road signs. Thus the family pilot will
not have to learn a complicated system
of navigation. Another advantage of
this layout is that the strips would be at
frequent intervals. In case of a sudden
storm, a good landing place would not
be more distant than a few minutes fly-
ing time.
Large cities will have to construct
many air strips located conveniently for
Mr. John Q. Public, that is, near his
home and office. In some cities slum
clearance projects would provide space.
Sooner or later a strip will become a

of these strips will be located near large cities.
space provided by today's airports. A
level, grassy piece of land, 150 to 200
feet wide and 1,500 to 2,000 feet long,
can be made into a suitable landing
field. The surface does not necessarily
have to be made of a hard material like
our highways, but it must be well
drained and should be adjacent to a
highway. A strip can be made to fit
practically any piece of land. In general,
there are four patterns; the —». the
L, the T, and the X. The last three per-
mit take-offs into any of the four basic
wind directions. Nevertheless, the first
will do in a pinch, as the tricycle landing
"must" for golf courses, recreational
areas, vacationing resorts, and subur-
ban developments. The facilities of the
air strips would include airplane servic-
ing equipment, hangars, restaurants,
sales rooms, flying club quarters, tourist
lodges, and even automobile service sta-
tions.
The Civil Aeronautics Authority has
proposed a plan calling for 6,000 air
fields with Federal, State, and Munici-
pal cooperation in financing. But we
need far more than that. However, as a
start the plan is suitable, although lim-
ited in scope.

New RCA Penicillin Process Speeds Production!
TODAY, when the wonder-drug peniciN
lin is so vitally needed on the fighting fronts
and in the home-front sickrooms, the Radio
Corporation of America reveals that a rev-
olutionary method of production has been
perfected in RCA Laboratories.
Tests at the Squibb Penicillin production
center at New Brunswick, N. J., show that
a single RCA electronic installation can
concentrate two billion Oxford units of
Penicillin in 24 hours—enough to admin-
ister 100,000 individual doses.
Besides streamlining the elaborate evapor-
ation method, the new RCA Electronic
system includes these important advan-
tages: reduction of operation costs, low-
ered maintenance costs, less possibility of
mechanical difficulties and production de-
lays, great savings in floor space, and
impressive reduction in initial equipment
costs.

This gas is expanded in the turbine. No
intermediate fluid is used in the turbine
as in the steam cycle, where fuel is
burned and releases chemical energy as
hot products of combustion which pass
through a steam boiler to generate steam
for the steam turbine. The steam boiler
is' the biggest element in the steam
power plant. In the gas cycle, a com-
pressor and combustor replace the
boiler, resulting in a much smaller and
more compact power plant. Because
the simple open combustion gas cycle
does not require cooling water, no steam
condenser such as the one used in the
condensing steam cycle is needed, and
plants may be located without regard
to a suitable source of water.
high temperature metals
developed
Although the first patent was taken
out over 150 years ago, early inventors
were unsuccessful in getting units effici-
ent enough to drive their own com-
pressor. The cycle was perfectly sound,
but these early inventors lacked ma-
terials to withstand the high tempera-

ture that was necessary and also tur-
bines and compressors of high enough
efficiencies.
Today the story is changing. Ma-
terials are capable of operating at high
temperatures. The maximum tempera-
ture employed depends largely on the
useful life required. For instance, for
a life of a few hours, such as might be
satisfactory for military needs, tempera-
tures of the order of 2000° F are allow-
able. Heavy duty and.long life appli-
cations are limited to much lower tem-
peratures. The war effort will undoubt-
edly produce materials capable of oper-
ating at temperatures which would have
been unheard of under a normal peace
time development.
The combustion gas turbine requires
tremendous volumes of gas. The axial
flow compressor, small in physical size,
efficiently handles the large volumes of
air. The advancement in knowledge of
blade shapes and air foil design and re-
search have given the designer the ne-
cessary tools for the design of highly
efficient axial flow compressors.
best economy at full load
One of the significant facts in the dis-
cussion of comparative fuel rates of
various prime movers is that the gas
turbine power plant must be operated
at nearly its full rating for best econo-
my. Fuel consumption of the steam
plant and the diesel, on the other hand,
level off at about 50 per cent of their
rating. The gas turbine fuel rate is
approximately 20 and 40 per cent re-
spectively above the fuel rates of typical
steam and diesel plants at full load.
However, the difference in the type of
fuel burned must be considered in such
a comparison.
While some diesel plants are operat-
ing on cheaper fuel, the majority of
operators seem to prefer higher grade
ash-free diesel fuel intended specifically
for diesel engines. This fuel costs 50 to
75% more per heat unit than the fuel
used in most oil-fired steam plants and
31/: to 4 times as much per heat unit
as coal. This cost partly offsets low
fuel consumption.
turbine and compressor
efficiency are big factors
In the gas turbine cycle, the useful
power output depends upon obtaining
relatively high turbine and compressor
efficiencies. The net power output
equals the difference of two quantities;
the turbine output and the work con-
sumed by the compressor in compress-
ing the air. In a system of Fig. 2
operating at a temperature of 1000° F,
the turbine develops 3.95 power units
of which 2.95 is needed to drive the
compressor. If we reduce the efficiency
of each of these elements, i.e. the tur-
bine and the compressor, by 1%, we
reduce the over-all efficiency by 7%.
The useful output decreases sharply as
the top temperature is decreased.
In Fig 3 the simple gas cycle thermal
efficiency is plotted as a function of the
pressure ratio for several turbine inlet
temperatures of the combustion gas.
(Pressure ratio is the compressor dis-
charge pressure divided by the com-
pressor inlet pressure, which is 14.7 Ibs.
per sq. in. ABS. in the open cycle.) The
curves are based on these efficiencies:
Turbine 85 per cent; compressor 84 per
cent: combustor 100 per cent; and air
inlet temperature of 70° F. The 750°
F. curve is plotted for two different com-
pressor efficiencies showing the effect of
change in efficiency of one of the ele-
ments of the gas turbine. As can be
observed from the curves, a reduction
in compressor efficiency of 9 per cent
cuts the cycle efficiency almost in half.
The relatively low pressure ratios at
which maximum efficiency is obtained
means that turbine inlet pressures in the
open cycle are relatively low, i.e. under
100 Ibs. per sq. in. ABS. Low pressure
has as a result large gas volume and
large turbine blade dimensions.
Engineers have been experimenting
with this combustion gas cycle for a
good many years. This is especially true
in Europe because of economic condi-
tions that prevailed. In this country,
much of the recent development has not

sons. However, pre-war applications of
the gas turbine in Europe have been
frequently mentioned in the technical
literature of this country (see Frontis-
piece, p. 10).
regeneration, intercoooling.
and reheating aid efficiency
As shown in Fig. 3, the efficiency of
the simple open gas cycle is low unless
high temperatures are used. However,
there are three practical ways of greatly
improving the gas cycle efficiency. They
are: 1) regenerating, 2) intercooling,
and 3) reheating. The regenerating gas
cycle is a cycle in which a heat ex-
changer (regenerator) transfers some of
the heat in the relatively hot exhaust

brought out in Fig. 4. It has long been
known that regeneration is extremely
useful in the gas-turbine plant because,
when the waste heat of the hot exhaust
gases is used to preheat the air dis-
charged from the compressor, there is a
reduction in the fuel required in the
combustion chamber, and therefore an
improvement in the fuel economy.

the regenerator. The surface, weight,
and cost of a regenerator increase
sharply as the effectiveness increases.
The regenerator causes a reduction of
the fuel rate, as shown in Fig. 6. Heat-
ing the air by exhaust gases reduces fuel
consumption and improves the cycle ef-
ficiency. The amount of heat obtained
from the exhaust gas depends on the size
of the heat exchanger. This turns out
to be an economic problem where gain
in efficiency has to be balanced against
the cost of heat exchanger surface.
Efficiency is further improved when
intercooling is added to regeneration as
shown in Fig. 7. As the name implies,
intercooling removes the heat of com-
pression from the air passing through
the compressor. Water, circulating
through the intercooler, cools the air,
and is therefore a necessary part of the
cycle. By intercooling, the compressor

work is reduced because colder air has
smaller volume. Other conditions re-
maining constant, one stage of intercool-
ing will reduce the work of the compres-
sor by something like IS per cent. This
increases the part of the turbine capa-
city available for useful output and
therefore improves the cycle efficiency.
A large number of stages of intercoolers
would be ideal, but only a few stages
are practical.

various cycle combinations
compared
The combination of regenerating, re-
heating, and interceding is shown in
Fig. 9. The thermal efficiency of the
open cycle gas turbine for various com-
binations of regenerating, reheating, and
intercooling is shown in Fig. 10. This
Fig. 10
gives a relative value of the various
modifications. The temperature range
of 1000°F to 1SOO°F only is shown be-
cause operation below 1000°F is im-
practical, and because operation above
1500;F is awaiting future metallurgical
developments.
The temperature of the inlet air to
the compressor has a marked effect on
the cycle efficiency. In contrast to steam
plants, the colder the inlet air, the
higher the cycle efficiency and capacity.
In the simple open cycle, changing the
inlet air temperature 10°F changes the
cycle efficiency 0.74 per cent or approxi-
mately 3 per cent per 10°F change.
The effect on cycle thermal efficiency
of inlet air temperature with the differ-
ent cycle arrangements with a top tem-
perature of 1200°F is plotted in Fig. 11.

steam and combustion gas
cycles compared
Because steam is the most widely
used medium for transferring heat into
mechanical energy, a comparison of the
steam cycle and the gas cycle may help
in judging the gas cycle and its possi-
bilities. In judging the efficiency of
power cycles, a 100 per cent thermal
efficiency is not attainable because the
temperature of the cold body is far
above absolute zero temperature. The
Carnot Cycle is the theoretically perfect
cycle, and no cycle that operates be-
tween the same hot and cold body tem-
peratures can have a better thermal ef-
ficiency. The best any cycle can hope to
do when operating under the same con-
ditions, is to attain the Carnot Cycle
efficiency. The gas turbine cycle can
theoretically give the same efficiency as
the Carnot Cycle. However, this is pnly
theoretically possible because it requires
100 per cent efficiency of the gas tur-
bine and compressor, and infinite num-
ber of stages of intercooling and reheat-
ing, and a generator infinite in size.
closed cycle for large units
The closed cycle offers a way of in-
creasing the maximum capacity of the
open cycle. The volume of the working
gas is inversely proportional to the ab-
solute pressure. If the pressure is mul-
tiplied by 10, the size is divided by 10.
In the closed cycle, the circulating
working gas is at a relatively high pres-
sure and this reduces the physical size
of compressor and turbine. To reduce
the temperature of the gases before they
enter the compressor, cooling water is
required in the closed cycle. The heat
exchanger in which the gas is cooled be-
fore it enters the compressor is called
a gas precooler.
The closed cycle is the one used by
Escher Wyss, a Swiss manufacturing
concern. This is an externally fired
cycle in which the products of com-
bustion do not pass through the gas tur-
bine and compressor. The working gas
(air, hydrogen, or other medium) oper-
ates at a relatively high pressure in a
closed, recirculating circuit. The gas
heater in this cycle corresponds to the
steam boiler in the steam cycle. As this
closed cycle keeps the products of com-
bustion out of the turbine and compres-
sor circuits, the problem of using coal
as a fuel should be much simpler to solve
than in those cycles in which the prod-
ucts of combustion are circulated,
new cycle studied
A closed system is being developed
by Westinghouse. In this closed cycle a
separate gas turbine and compressor are
used to pump up the cycle on which the
main gas turbine and compressor oper-
ate. This cycle is internally fired, the
products of combustion passing through
the gas turbine and main compressor.
This cycle does away with the large gas

Of great value are the thermal effi-

Combustion gas turbine control can
be simple and reliable. It consists only
of the control of the gas temperature by
controlling the rate of fuel supply. Gov-
erning valves, such as used in steam tur-
bine control, are unnecessary.
possible gas turbine
applications
The possible applications of the gas
turbine are many. For example:
Petroleum Industry: Producing 100 oc-
tane aviation gasoline in the petro-
leum industry is currently the widest
application of gas turbines in the
United States. Allis-Chalmers alone
has already produced a total of 140,-
000 HP in installations.
Marine Field: A very promising ar-
rangement for marine applications is
a 3000 HP gas turbine power plant
together with a variable-pitch propel-
ler, thus permitting speed control that
is independent of the gas turbine set
speed. This permits the operator to
obtain best thermal performance from
the gas turbine at all times, and it
also greatly facilitates the maneuver-
ing problem.
Aviation: Aeronautical engineers of to-
day are of the opinion that the light
weight internal-combustion engine is
approaching a rather definite limit in
rating. The gas turbine on the other
hand, is especially useful in the sizes
where the gasoline engine seems to be
approaching a limit. Furthermore, it

Model of a marine-unit gas
does not require expensive high-oc-
tane fuel for its operation. It seems
apparent that one potential gas tur-
bine application is in the post-war
cargo and transport plane field.
Locomotives: The simple gas turbine
requires no water. It has low weight
and small space requirements and
simplicity. The thermal efficiency of
such a locomotive, its ease of assem-
bly, accessibility, lightness of weight,
and smooth flow of power all indicate
that it is an attractive application.
Below is shown a General Electric
combustion gas turbine locomotive of
the future.
The question arises as to whether or
not the gas turbine may finally succeed
the internal-combustion engine. At the
present time, the internal-combustion
engine has a higher thermal efficiency

with the same treatment. It machines
almost equally well whether hot or cold
finished. For those steels containing
from 0.35% to 0.45% carbon, there is
less clear ferrite and more of the pearli-
tic structure. A large grain, lamellar
pearlitic structure is most desirable for
machining these steels. Cold drawn high
carbon steels give the cutting tools a
licking; therefore, these steels with
0.45% carbon or more and alloy steels
with more than 0.35% carbon should be
divided into two general classes, namely,
the tungsten steels and the molybdenum
steels. The War Production Board
limits the use of the high tungsten type
because of the shortage of tungsten, and
the molybdenum steels will take its
place. At the present time the WPB
is recommending that of the high speed
steel used, 25% be of the tungsten type
and 75% of the molybdenum type. Of
the latter 70% should be of the 5.5
tungsten-4.5 molybdenum type, and
307o of the 1.5 tungsten and 9% moly-
bdenum type. In many operations the
molybdenum steel is superior to the
used generally on metals producing con-
tinuous chips, such as steel. They have
replaced the diamond as tools in most
finish boring operations.
Due to the critical shortage of tool
steels, it is economical as well as a great
help in the conservation of critical alloy-
if small tools, such as bits, are mounted
in a holder or tools tipped with these
metals are used. A x/t" square tool in
place of a %" tool makes a saving oi
900% in the critical material, and the
smaller tool may be reground at les*
cost and will last as long as the larger
when cutting.

annealed for best machining to provide
a lamellar pearlitic structure. The high-
er carbon steels will usually produce the
longest tool life when a spheroidized
structure is obtained. For the best sur-
face finish a hard sorbite structure is
most desirable.
The material from which the tools
are made has the greatest influence of
all factors on production. High carbon
tool steels are still used as finishing
tools and on free machining metals. In
mass manufacturing, however, their pro-
ductive capacity is relatively very low.
Forged and heat treated high speed
steels have been the standby in produc-
tion for years. These steels have a
wide variation in analysis but may be
tungsten type. Also, the high vanadium
types are proving superior to the cobalt
types in many instances for heavy duty
work. Coarse grained cast high speed
steels are now available and are well
worth investigating because in some
cases they give greatly increased tool
life over the forged and heat treated
types. Cast tungsten-chromium-cobalt
alloys such as Stellite, when available,
offer economics for certain production
jobs. The cemented tungsten carbides
now used as tipped tools are most eco-
nomical for the high production of parts
of brass, cast iron, malleable iron, and
magnesium. The cemented, combined
carbides of tungsten and titanium or of
tungsten, titanium, and tantulum are
The form of the tool is also of great
importance. By changing the side cut-
ting edge angle alone when cutting uni-
form ductile metals, the tool life can be
increased up to 5009r, or the cutting
speed can be increased 50/V . Increasing
the nose radius of high speed steel tools
gives greatly increased tool life. The
end cutting edge angle should be Small
and the side rake angle normally from
20% to 25%. Combining these optimum
shapes with proper grinding, production
may be increased many times. The

the chips slide has much to do with this

them with a 220-grit diamond wheel or

ing, reaming, gear shaping, etc.
chip form and tool wear
In the metal cutting process, surface
quality of the machined surface is
affected by several different factors,
namely, cutting speed, tool shape, size
of cut, process of cutting, cutting fluid,
and treatment of the metal. It fre-
quently appears that a tear exists be-
tween the work and chip at their junc-
tion. This tear is usually only a surface
effect, as by stopping the work sud-
denly, removing the section involved,
and grinding it so that a photomicro-
graph of the section can be made, the
results as illustrated in Fig. 3 are ob-
tained when ductile metals are being
turned. This shows the original work
material at the bottom with the material
compressed and sheared into the chip
at the right as it slides upward over the
built-up edge and in most cases over
the face of the tool. The condition
shown is for a newly ground tool.
The work is formed not by the actual
scraping or cutting action of the cutting
edge, but by the leading point of the
built-up edge some distance ahead of
the cutting edge. Frequently, parts of
the leading point of the built-up edge
slough off and adhere to the work sur-
face (and to the under side of the chip)
to form small steps, producing a surface
similar to that of the face of a file.
The above conditions are normal for
high speed steel tools operating at rela-
tively high speeds. If the speeds are
very low, a different form of broken
up chip is normally obtained as dis-
cussed later. If the speeds are unsually
high, the built-up edge recedes from the
cutting edge of the tool and beconv?&gt;
smaller and the cutting edge actually
does the cutting so as to leave a truly
scraped or cut surface as the machined
surface. This condition is obtained with
cemented carbide tools which permit
cutting speeds sufficiently high and with
satisfactory tool life. With the continu-
ous chip and built-up edge the tool
usually fails as shown in Fig. 2. At
the start of the cut, the tool is newly
ground and a built-up edge is formed
and supported on the tool face. After
cutting for about 3Y&gt; minutes the chip
has worn a groove in the face of the
tool after sliding over the built-up edge
The built-up edge is supported on the
narrow ridge immediately back of the

MORTAR'S GRANDPA
You could pick up this U. S. mortar about
as easily as you could move a safe and it
was about as easy to move around. But
its advocates back in the nineties foresaw
the importance of such armament in
modern warfare.
Today's version can be carried at a brisk
trot by a couple of men. It can go into
action in seconds. It's a precision weapon
—precision built, facts that many a Nazi
and Jap have discovered with a jolt.
Where did a lot of the modern mortar's
precision come from? From a little iron-
bowl furnace in which over 52 years ago,
Dr. Edward Goodrich Acheson created the
first man-made abrasive. Since then abra-

sive products have become one of our most
important production tools in the skilled
hands of American industry.
Abrasive wheels are used to grind the parts
of mortars, plane and tank engines, giant
guns and other war weapons to unbeliev-
able accuracy.
This accuracy is responsible not only
for the efficient performance of these
weapons — it also makes their mass
production possible.
For mass production depends on inter-
changeability of parts. And interchange-
ability depends on split-hair precision.
Today it is almost impossible to put your
finger on a single article mass produced for
war or for peace that isn't in some way
touched by grinding. On the land, in the
air, on and under the sea, material pro-
duced by abrasive manufacturing methods
are blasting the path to victory for the
United Nations.
We at Carborundum are mindful that
"this is a grinding war." Our efforts and
resources are pledged to making it as short
as possible.
These are just a few of the reasons why
engineers believe a working knowledge of
abrasives is a pretty good thing to have.

also be worn. It is in this condition
that the cut is most efficient because
of the increased rake produced by the
cupped face. The cutting force which
is represented by the vertical, longitu-
dinal, and radial force components are
maximum at the start of the cut when
the tool is freshly ground. They are
at a minimum in this case when the
tool life is about six minutes after the
cup in the face has developed. At this
point a new cutting edge is formed re-
sembling a range of mountains which
is the new surface between that of the
cupped face and the worn flank. The
built-up edge has disappeared. One
peak after another of this new edge
will break off, but a place will be filled
by work material to form a small built-
up edge and the tool will continue to
cut for some time. These failures,
known as preliminary failures, are fre-
quently evidenced by small burnished
lines on the cut surface which change
the nature of the machined surface.
That may occur along the side cutting
edge so that the burnished line is ob-
served along the shoulder of the work
being cut. For a given set of conditions
the tool usually can be ground so that
the preliminary failure does not affect
the work surface, but rather is noticed
by a change of the surface only on the
shoulder.
At low speeds such as are often used
in threading and reaming, a different
type of chip is formed. The chip is
broken into many small parts. They
are discontinuous rather than continu-
ous. A portion of the metal is com-
pressed as the tool advances into the
work. It is periodically sheared off to
relieve the pressure on the face of the
tool. The cutting edge scrapes over the
surface until it picks up the material
for a second segment. This chip forma-
tion offers an opportunity for a liquid
(cutting fluid) to come in contact with
the tool face and periodically lubricate
it. This explains why cutting fluids are
more effective for producing good sur-
face quality at low speeds than at high
speeds. The cutting speed greatly in-
fluences the quality of the machined
surface, even independently of the size
of cut, tool shape, and other conditions.
In cutting a steel at low speed, the finish
is usually poor. Under these conditions
a high rake should be used, a light feed,
and a cutting fluid consisting of an oil
containing sulphur or chlorine. As the
cutting speed is increased, the finish
becomes better as shown in Fig. 4. For
each structure a cutting speed is ob-
tained at which the built-up edge dis-
appears, the cutting edge actually
scrapes the work surface, and produces
a keen cut or burnished surface. The
speed at which this excellent finish is
obtained varies not only with the type
of steel cut, but with the structure of
the steel. This speed is lowest for the
hardest metals, and highest for the soft-
est metals. At this high speed, such as
when cutting steel and carbide tools, the
cutting fluid plays practically no part
in influencing the quality of the work
Cutting fluids may be used on low
speed operations for producing good sur-
face quality or dimensional accuracy.
The speeds are low, the tool rake should
be relatively high, and the cutting fluid
should be of a heavy oil type usually
containing sulphur. Under normal cut-
ting, however, such as when high speed
steels are cutting at moderate speeds,
cooling is believed to be the primary
function of the cutting fluid so that
aqueous solutions or emulsions are more
desirable. These cutting fluids should
be applied at relatively low tempera-
tures, such as from 70° to 85°, in large
quantities and at high velocity. When
carbide tools are cutting at extremely
high speeds, a cutting liquid may
be objectionable because of excessive
splashing and rapid change of tempera-
tures as the liquid is suddenly applied
to the hot tool after being intermittently
kept from the tool by chips.
new techniques in milling
Outstanding advances have been
made in the milling process during war
time. This work has been initiated
principally by aircraft manufacturers
on the West Coast. Two examples
worthy of note are: (1) the negative
rake milling of hard steel, and (2) the
high speed milling of the light metals,
aluminum and magnesium.
Carbides of tungsten, titanium, and
tantulum sintered together form a ma-
terial which is harder than any other
material except the diamond. This
material, fortunately, also has the prop-
erty of maintaining its strength and
hardness at extremely high tempera-
tures. By tipping the cutting blades of
a milling cutter with this material, it
has been found very effective to operate
the cutters in steel at peripheral speeds
of from 600 to 900 f.p.m. instead of the
usual 250 to 350 f.p.m. For this pur-
pose the cutter teeth are ground with
a double negative rake such as 10°
negative axial rake and 10° negative
radial rake. In previous practice both
of these angles have been positive in-
stead of negative. The feed per tooth
of the cutter into the work is maintained
at from .004" to .012". Because most
machine tools are powered by electrical
motors for the normal type of cutting at
low speeds with positive rake cutters,
they are inadequate for the new practice
of using the high speeds with negative
rake. It is desirable, however, to main-
tain the high speed and the high feed
per tooth, but because of the limita-
tions in power, the normal number of
teeth has to be reduced usually to 8,
6, 4, 2 or 1. Many cutters have only
one tooth in order to take advantage
of the high speeds, high feed per tooth,
and the negative rake. In this case
rigidity is of importance and the addi-
tion to the arbor of a fly wheel located
adjacent to the cutter has been found
to be very beneficial. On the West
Coast these high speeds have been ob-
tained by using high cycle motors. When
milling steel at these high speeds and
with negative rakes, the heat developed
in removing the chip is absorbed by the
chip which leaves the work cool and
undistorted. The high-speed cutting
leaves the surface of the work with a
superlative finish of smoothness and
accuracy so that in many instances no
further finishing cut or grinding is re-
quired.
It has been found that no cutting
fluid at all is better than just a little
when cutting at these high speeds. The
cutting fluid should be applied if used
so that it helps to remove the chips from
the work and even wash them from the
fixtures and machine. Compressed air
has been used particularly for this latter
purpose with favorable results. By
applying these principles, the production
of many milling machines is doubled,
tripled and even quadrupled.
It is believed that because of the tre-
mendous present capacity for the pro-
duction of aluminum and magnesium,
these metals will challenge the pre-war
position of other metals and materials.
As most machines tools have been built
to machine the heavy metals such as
steel, definite modifications are needed
in the post-war machine tools to take
full advantage of the excellent machin-
ing properties of the light alloys. These
metals are milled with cutters, the teeth
of which are made of carbon steel, high-

MAGNESIUM'S USEFULNESS IS BROAD YET CLEARLY DEFINED
Magnesium is aptly called the Metal of
Motion. For this abundant basic metal, ex-
tracted by Dow from sea water and from
Michigan brine, is the lightest of all struc-
tural metals, it is durable and strong, and
so it finds its place wherever metal is to be
put in motion, wherever inertia is to be
overcome. In all the varied fields of trans-
portation—on highway, rail, or in the air-
magnesium will help move people and
materials faster, over greater ranges, more
economically. In the moving and recipro-
cating parts of machines ... in hand- and
power-operated tools, equipment and home
appliances ... in these places is magne-
sium's inherent usefulness so naturally and
peculiarly valuable. It is only logical, there-
fore, that the weight-saving characteristics
of magnesium should inspire new ideas. The
Metal of Motion is leading designers directly
to fresh concepts of efficiency and speed and
comfort for everyday life in our time.

time and place at which such a remov-
able or "assignable" cause acted so that
a checking over the process at this point
will enable the engineer to learn what
went wrong and correct it.
In practice, working with measure-
ments, a control chart is set up as fol-
lows: As the articles come off the line,
measurements are taken on a consecu-
tive group of five, say. The measure-
ments are averaged and the range, the
difference between the largest and the
smallest is found. The averages and
ranges are similarly found for 20 or 25
such samples taken at intervals. The
governing principle here is that the sam-
upper and lower control limits and put
on the chart. A typical completed chart
for averages is shown in Figure 3.
The process was not in control. The
group of five points, 10-14, were found
to be due to a bad lot of raw material
which was used only during that period.
With these points out the center and
limit lines were revised and the further
production was compared with them.
Continued appearance of points outside
the control limits led to an investiga-
tion which showed up a faulty method
of regulating the tension of a spring.
When this was corrected the chart for
the next run of 30 points was as it ap-
pears in Figure 4. Now it appears that
the process is under control, at least for

pie size shall be such that there is no
reason to believe that a process change
can take place while the sample is being
taken, while the intervals between sam-
ples shall be chosen so that process
changes, if any, will take place during
them. The averages in order of produc-
tion are plotted on a pair of axes, with
the order numbers of samples laid off
horizontally and the values of the aver-
ages laid off vertically.
Since individual measurements vary
so will their averages and what we see
is a picture of this latter variation. The
question now is: Is this variation to be
called random, indicative of a controlled
process, or does it point to the presence
of assignable causes which if not re-
moved will result in an unstable process
center or unpredictable variability or,
more likely, both together? To an-
swer this question, first a tentative cen-
ter line is put on the chart determined
by the average of the averages. Then
the average of the ranges, which meas-
ure the variability within periods during
which the process was assumed stable,
is found and from tables the 3-&lt;r lim- 75 80
its for the averages are determined as Fig. 4
the present.
What are the advantages of a con-
trolled process? First, a controlled proc-
ess is a process doing the best of which
it is capable. Second, for such a proc-
ess, from the accumulated evidence from
it control chart, one can tell just what
this best is, i.e., where it is centered and
what its inherent variability is. Then
one can know how it will perform with
respect to given blueprint tolerances.
Third, once control is established, the
amount of inspection needed is only
enough to give assurance that control is
being maintained: without control noth-
ing less than 100% inspection is enough
And if, as it may happen, a process is
found to be difficult to get and keep in
control, every assignable cause found
and removed means a reduction in scrap
and rework and improvement in thf
quantity and quality of acceptable prod-
ucts.
I am only hitting the high spots and
I can only mention a few of the many
points I could discuss at length. First
of all, I have described very briefly the
control chart for averages, but variabil-
ity is controlled by a similar chart for
ranges or standard deviations and count;
of defective articles in lots inspected on
the go; no-go bases are likewise effec-
tively controlled by an appropriate form
of chart. Then it should be noted that
there is nothing about the control chart
analysis of a process that need interrupt
production. Such an analysis, too, can
perfectly well be applied to the results
of 100% inspection: in fact, in making
a preliminary study to determine whether
or not a going process appears to be in
control it is usual to take measurements
on from 100 to 150 consecutive articles
for this purpose. It is important that
the control chart is simple to use, re-
quiring no mathematics beyond ordi-
nary arithmetic, and that the story it
tells is grasped readily by everybody
from machine operators up. In actual
use, it is essential that the source, the
time, the place, and other identifying
marks for every point on the chart be
clearly indicated. It is also essential
that there be as little delay as possible
between production, inspection, and the
placing of points on the chart. Then
when trouble develops, its presence is
quickly detected and the search for it is
effectively localized so that it can be
corrected without delay and without the
piling up of costly rejections. Of course
the whole method is useless unless it is
actually put to work and action is taken

WHAT YOU SHOULD
KNOW ABOUT THE
TIMKEN BEARING
DESIGN
Essence of Performance
JLimken introduced the tapered principle over 45 years ago to obtain
an anti-friction bearing with the ability to carry radial loads, thrust loads or
any combination of the two. During the ensuing long period of engineering
development and experience, a constant refinement of design has taken place,
making the Timken Bearing of today supreme in performance.
Here are the three most important features
exemplified in the design of the Timken Bearing.
1. TRUE ROLLING MOTION: This basic necessity is assured by making
all lines coincident with the tapered surfaces of the rollers, cup and
cone, meet at a common apex on the axis of the bearing, Figure 1. True
rolling motion always has been incorporated in the Timken Bearing.
2. POSITIVE ROLLER ALIGNMENT: During the development of the
Timken Bearing, as speed, load and accuracy requirements increased,
various methods were used to stabilize the rollers and prevent them
skewing in the raceways. The solution was found in establishing wide-
area contact between the large ends of the rollers and the undercut
rib of the cone, thus assuring constant and accurate roller alignment
around the periphery of the raceways. The light areas on the ends of the
rollers in Figure 2, show contact of rollers with undercut rib of cone.
3. MULTIPLE PERFORATED CAGE: All the openings in the Timken
Bearing cage, Figure 3, are stamped out in one operation by means of
multiple perforating dies made to extremely close precision tolerances.
This assures exact center-to-center spacing of the rollers around the
periphery of the raceways, so that every roller takes its full share of
the load when the bearing is in operation.

A thorough knowledge of Timken Bearing design and application will be one
of your best assets when you graduate to enter the professional engineering field.
Begin to acquire it now. The Timken Roller Bearing Company, Canton 6, Ohio.

when points fall outside of limits. On
the other hand, it is evident that con-
trol charts supplant no previous knowl-
edge and experience in the control of
quality and they are to be used along
with all the engineering know-how and
judgment that can be brought to bear.
They are not meant to be put on every
production line or on every quality
characteristic of every product in a fac-
tory, but only where they are really
needed. Finally, they do pay their way;
the evidence on this point is much more
than convincing to anybody who knows
what is being accomplished by their aid
—increased volume of acceptable prod-
ucts at less cost for wastage and labor.
In these days of shortage of manpower
it is important that many plants have
found it possible to release a substantial
portion of their inspectors for produc-
tive work.
It goes almost without saying that the
control chart is only one of the contri-
butions statistical methods can make to
the control of quality. Other tools are
available for use in testing laboratories
and for devising proper sampling meth-
ods, particularly for the acceptance of
incoming materials and parts from out-
side suppliers. I could have mentioned
earlier that many tests destroy the arti-
cle tested.
Interest in these methods on the part
of industry has grown rapidly through
the war period. The Office of Produc-
tion Research and Development of the
WPB in connection with the ESMWT
units of our leading engineering schools
has given over 20 eight-day, seven hours
per day, courses in this subject to over
1000 representatives of industry selected
by management all over the United
States. In Detroit, last December, over
90 attended the course put on by the
University of Michigan. At Purdue last
spring representatives of 19 of the bet-
ter engineering colleges met in a four
day conference on the teaching of such
courses and attended, in addition, the
eight-day course given there. Regular
courses in Statistical Methods in Indus-
trial Production have already been initi-
ated in engineering schools and will soon
appear in the curricula of all the leading
ones. There is already a demand for
statistically trained quality control en-
gineers. During the post-war period the
statistician will really enter the factory
and he will not be confined to the front
office.

speed steel, cast alloys or sintered car-
bides. They are formed with large posi-
tive rake angles and the cutting speeds
are extremely high, ranging from 8,000
to 15,000 f.p.m. Rather than reduce the
feed per tooth from the satisfactory
range of from .004" to .010", the num-
ber of teeth are reduced again in order
to utilize the present machine tools with
limited power.
In recognizing the potential value of
these new techniques in milling the
WPB has now set up (thru the Office
of Production Research and Develop-
ment) two research programs to deter-
mine more exactly the details of the
practice most desirable for effective pro-
duction on present equipment. One pro-
gram is at the California Institute of
Technology and the second is at the
University of Michigan. These pro-
grams, closely coordinated are not so
much to determine what might be most
desirable for the effective production of
parts in the future on new special equip-
ment, but rather to determine what
might be considered good practice on
equipment now available in the various
shops so that all machines now in pro-
duction can be operated most effectively.

BOILERS of the FUTURE
The pressure of war-time production has demanded of*
Babcock &amp; Wilcox an ever-greater share of the responsibility
for producing boilers for increased-capacity steam genera-
ting plants. A large number of Public Utilities, Industrial
Power Plants and Ships have been equipped with B &amp; W
Boilers of modern design. These improved boilers will be
available for FUTURE use in ALL industries. It would
be well to familiarize yourself with B &amp; W Boilers NOW.

new plastic
A shatter-resistant plastic, which self-
seals bullet and flak holes and makes
possible pressurized cabins where crews
can function without oxygen masks, is
now being used in the B-29 Superfort-
ress.
vacant electron spaces make
metals rust resistant
An important metallurgist has just re-
vealed that vacant spaces in the atoms of
nickel are responsible for its resistance
to corrosion. In his earlier experiments
with corrosion resistant metal alloys
such as Stainless Steel, Monel, Hastel-
loy and others, he discovered that cor-
rosion is due to the electronic arrange-
ment of the atoms rather than to the
surface film as was previously supposed.
An atom may be thought of as a nu-
cleus around which revolve from one to
92 eleectrons. These move in from one
to seven different orbits. Ordinarily one
orbit is filled with electrons before the
next one begins, though in the case of
certain transition elements there are va-
cancies in the orbit next to the outer one.
In nickel, for example there are only
eight electrons in the third orbit, instead
of the ten it could hold, despite the fact
that there are two electrons in the fourth
and outermost shell. Because of these
vacancies, nickel is very resistant to
corrosion. Vast quantities of valuable
metals are last annually through cor-
rosion and this important discovery
may lead to more effective way of over-
coming it.
electronic welding
of aircraft gas tanks
The two halves of the P-38 dropable
gas tanks are now being welded together
by electronically controlled resistance
welding. The precision with which the
control operates insures tough, vibration
proof, gaslight seams. The process
permits substituting steel for war scarce
aluminum formerly used in making
these streamlined tanks. These tanks
when empty may be dropped from the
plane.
human hair 25,000 times
size of wire
Invisible platinum wire, so small only
its shadow can be seen, is now being ex-
perimented with. The wire is but 13
millionths of an inch thick, and approxi-
mately 25,000 strands would be needed
to equal the cross-sectional area of a
human hair. When mounted between
glass plates and held to the light, the
wire is invisible to the naked eye, but
the reflection—or "shadow" may be
seen. Platinum being one of the heaviest
metals, one cubic foot of the wire would
weigh 1330 pounds and drawn could
circle the earth 800 times. The wire is
manufactured by drawing thin silver
wire with a platinum core to an over-all
thickness of two-thousandths of an inch.
A section of the wire is then placed un-
der a microscope and a few drops of ni-
tric acid are used to dissolve the silver.
The remaining wire tends to cling to
other objects and is so fragile that it will
break if removed too quickly from the
nitric acid. No use for the wire has yet
been discovered.
portable milling machine
Finishing the upper surface of the top
plate of reduction gear foundations to a
0.0015 in tolerance once kept a crew of
12 machinists busy for two weeks at a
West Coast shipyard turning out Vic-
tory ships. The foundations are welded
into place afterwards. The job is now
done by a portable milling machine.

ble if you have a 20 ton crane. The

bazooka barrels
The barrels of the flying bazookas
installed on the Thunderbolt fighters
are made from a special paper plastic.
Plastic was used because it is lighter
and better adapted for the job than
other types of material. What resins
were used was not revealed other than
that it is fire resistant to withstand the
fiery blast of the rocket missile when
launched.

makes this powerful instrument avail-
able to doctors and research men for
whom the 12 foot, two ton model was
too large or expensive. This latest model
is suitcase style and weighs but 78
pounds. A vacuum pump weighing 55
pounds completes the set-up. This
model is operated by but two knobs and
can be used where ordinary electric
power is available.

It's
GOOD LUCK
to have GalvanizedRoofin
on Buildings

For in these days of material scarcities,
galvanized roofing can be taken care of
by simple, easy means and made to last
a lifetime.
Galvanized roofing is zinc-coated roofing;
and the U. S. Bureau of Standards states that
zinc is "by far the best" protective metallic coat-
ing for iron or steel! Zinc in the form of galvan-
izing provides double protection:
First, by simple coverage, with a sheath of
rust-resistant metal.
Second, by electro-chemical action or "sacri-
ficial corrosion."
Galvanized roofing is used on more than a
third of all the farm buildings in the United
States — which proves that farmers are smart
judges of roofing value!
Take Care Of It!
It's just good business to take good care of galvanized roofing.
It is so easy to do it, too, that there's no excuse for neglect. With
reasonable care, galvanized roofing can be made to give] a
lifetime of satisfactory service. Get a copy of the free booklet
"How to Make Galvanized
Roofing Last Longer"
and the few simple steps to take will be made completely clear. The book-
let is valuable. It's free—write for it today.

free flowing solder
for aluminum
Sheet aluminum can now be lock-
seamed, lapped, spot-welded, or riv-
eted, and the joint sealed with a new
free flowing solder that has just been
developed. This is the first free flowing
soft solder for use on aluminum and
aluminum alloys. It is claimed that it
will flow on aluminum as readily as or-
dinary lead-tin solder will on brass or
copper. This solder will work on cast as
well as wrought aluminum, on copper,
steel, and nickel alloys.
hydraulic barker
A new machine designed to remove
bark from pulpwood logs, utilizes a jet
of water as a cutting tool. A pressure of
650 pounds per square inch is used.
The jet hits the log at an angle while it
is being rotated as in a lathe, removing
a seven-inch swath of bark without
wasting a sliver of wood, a very appreci-
able saving compared with the 6 to 20
per cent wasted by conventional meth-
ods. Logs as large as 54 inches in diame-
ter can be handled at a rate of 100 logs
an hour.
portable beacon
A portable flashing beacon has been
designed for identification signalling at
temporary Allied airports. It uses a
gaseous discharge lamp of a type that
was originally developed for high-speed
photography. This portable beacon re-
quires only one third as much power
as that needed for a stationary airport
rotating beacon. The weight is also one-
third that of a stationary beacon. It is
mounted on a collapsible mast and pro-
duces a flash of such intense, split-sec-
ond brilliance that the exact candle
power cannot be measured.
photoelectric tachometer
Speeds as high as 60,000 rpm can
be measured with an accuracy of better
than one half of one percent of the full-
scale reading, with the photoelectric
tachometer. This device requires no
mechanical connection to the shaft that
is being tested, but employs a light
beam that illuminates a white spot
painted on the test part. As the part is
rotated in front of a photo-tube, each
light impulse initiates a voltage im-
pulse. This is amplified and transmitted
to an instrument which indicates the
speed in rpm.
new marine pump
A new 275 gpm automatic, self-prim-
ing, bilge pump has been developed for
shipboard use. High efficiency is ob-
tained through the use of a new type
spring valve. Being a complete self con-
tained assembly mounted on a suitably
fabricated base, this pump unit is espe-
cially suited to applications where speed
of installation is important.
largest western steel plant
The largest steel plant west of the
Mississippi river went into operation
early this year at Geneva, about 40
miles south of Salt Lake City, Utah. It
was built by the Columbia Steel Com-
pany, a subsidiary of the United State-
Steel Corporation, and is being operated
by the Geneva Steel Company, another
U. S. Steel subsidiary, without profit
during the war emergency period.
The Geneva plant was built to pro-
vide an additional source of pig iron
and steel closer to the shipbuilding

Battery of Pacific Typo HV Centrifugal Pumps
This battery of Pacific Type HV centrifugal pumps are deliver-
ing peak efficiency in refinery stabilizer reflux service. Type HV
handles extremely hot or sub-zero liquids at low pressures, with
speeds up to 3600 r.p.m., capacities 100 to 3000 g.p.m. and
differential pressures up to 325 p.s.i. It is one of the many types
ot high precision pumps designed and built by Pacific.
In pump engineering achievements, Pacific has always antici-
pated and met the requirements of industry and takes pride in its
long list of "firsts" in design, methods and construction.
Achievements
in the Field
TWO Clark 3000 BHP Steam "Angles" and three
1000 BHP Gas-Driven "Angles" in Union Oil Co.,
at Oleum, Calif. . .. are serving in two important ways
in making Hi-Octane gasoline.
Gasoline is being converted into Toluene by Cata-
lytic cracking. The 2 Clark 3000 BPH Steam-Driven
"Angles" furnish compressed air to burn coke, tar
and asphalt from the catalyst keeping it in efficient
operation. A gas residue is then compressed by the
3 Clark 1000 BHP super-charged gas-driven "Angles"
to recover 8 to 15 additional gallons of highest grade
gasoline per 1000 ft. of residue gas.

The giant new plant covers 1600
acres in a picturesque setting just east
of the Wasatch mountain range. Its
principal units include three 1100-ton
blast furnaces and nine 225-ton open-
hearth furnaces, a 44-in. blooming mill
serving a 132-in. continuous plate mill,
a 32-in. blooming mill serving a 26-in.
structural mill and a mold foundry.
They will produce 700,000 tons of plates,
250,000 tons of shapes, billets and rods,
and 44,500 tons of merchant iron annu-
ally.
hot togs
When flying in temperatures that
sometimes reach 60 F. below zero, fur-
lined gloves and shoes are of compara-
tively little value. Recently developed
electrically heated articles prevent the
frosbite of hands and feet, and are now
being supplied to high altitude flyers as
fast as they can be made.
Coats and trousers of these airmen
have always been electrically heated,
but boots and gloves, because of prob-
lems of flexibility and wear, were never
before successfully heated. Each shoe
and glove is designed to operate inde-
pendently, and for added safety, each
unit has two electrical circuits built in,
so that only one half the heat is lost if
one of the circuits in that unit should
break.
new photoelectric
technique
A photographic technique so sensitive
that it could presumably take a picture
of a ghost has recently been devoloped.
This amazing process, recorded by
means of a flashlight with an exposure
of less than one-millionth of a second,
photographs things which are invisible.
As an example of this, pictures have
been taken of a heat wave, rising from
the palm of a hand.
sensitive to a baby's touch
Can a baby twist a three-inch-thick
steel shaft? The answer is yes and it
can now be proven by measuring the
amount of twist with a highly sensi-
tive magnetic coupled torquemeter.
This torquemeter is designed to meas-
ure the twist in the hollow steel shaft
connecting an airplane engine to its
propeller. This information, conveyed
to the plane's instrument board, enables
the pilot to adjust the engines to achieve
maximum fuel economy, squeezing five
to ten percent more miles out of each
gallon of gasoline.

rubber engine mounting
Vibration is being reduced to a mini-
mum on Flying Fortresses by a new
rubber vibration absorber which is the
product of two years of research. The
radial engines are supported by a circu-
lar ring to which it is attached by a ser-
ies of these mounts. The mount con-
sists of two main parts. There is a col-
lar, lined with a rubber bushing. This
collar is attached to lugs welded to the
ring. This collar has a socket which is
at right angles to the collar itself. The
other half of the mounting, a small unit
attached to the engine, ends in a ball
which fits into this socket. Vibrations
developing in the engine are isolated by
two features of the mounting, the ball
and socket joint, and the rubber bush-
ing in the collar. The ball and socket,
as used, produces a unique rocking mo-
tion in the rubber bushing.
another pump
A Norwegian invention of a pump op-
erated by the beating of the waves
against the vessel's side is hailed as
most unusual. A wave half a meter high,
it is claimed, will make the pump eject
one ton of water a minute. This newly
patented pump can be used on vessels
under 3000 dead-weight tons, and is
said to be ideal for fishing boats.

Chairman, Dept. of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering
'ISTORICAL. The possibility of
using models to study phenomena
interest in the full scale prototype
long been known and utilized by
cientists and engineers. In the late
16th century Sir William Gilbert, the
nglish physicist, investigated the di-
rectional forces of the earth's magnetic
field through study with a small sphere
of lodestone. In the field of ship resist-
ance experiments by de Bordo in 1763
established the square law of velocity
and further experiments were under-
taken by the Marquis de Condorcet
and the Abbe de Bossut in 1775, using
a gravity type rig in a basin 100 ft. x 52
ft. x 6 ft. A few years previously in
1768 our own versatile Ben Franklin
satisfied his curiosity concerning the in-
crease in resistance of barges operating
in shoal water through the use of tank
tests. Small models were towed the
length of a miniature tank by means of
the gravitational pull on a shilling at-
tached to a line from the bow, and run-
ning over a sheave at the tank end. By
comparing the increase in time required
by the model to traverse a given dis-
tance, as the water was successively
shoaled, he obtained reliable estimates of
shallow water amplification of drag.
This method in tank testing (of prede-
termining the resistance and observing
the resultant speed) is used today in
the small tanks at Washington and New-
port News.
During the next 100 years Beaufoy,
Chapman, Scott, Russell and others,
experimented and theorized in the field
of ship resistance, but little of value was
achieved until the advent of the elder
Froude. In 1868 William Froude pro-
pounded the 'Law of Comparison' and
laid the foundation for our present tech-
nique. In 1870 the British Admiralty
voted 2000 pounds and authorized the
construction of the experimental tank
at Torquay in accordance with Froude's
proposals. This grant, by the way, was
indicated by the Lords as being ample
to completely solve all the problems of
ship resistance and propulsion! Under
the direction and imagination of Froude
however, came forth the seeds from
which have been harvested the solutions
of complex problems of hull form, ap-
pendages and propellers. In this coun-
try pioneer development was carried on
and stimulated by Admiral Taylor at
Washington and Sadler and Bragg at
Ann Arbor.
In the early days of schooner build-
ing on the New England Coast, model
tests were frequently useful in deciding
the relative merit of hull forms proposed
by optioned owners, masters, and build-
ers when a new ship was contemplated.
Scale models of each design were towed
by pairs in parallel, through lines made
fast to the ends of a pivoted cross-arm,
which in turn was a carried by a boom
rigged out from the side of a skiff, (th?
writer has on occasion served as the mo-
tive power for the skiff.) By shifting
the cross-beam fulcrum until the dif-
ference in drag of the two models was
equalized, a definite measure of relative
form resistance was obtained for ap-
proximate speeds.
Today the use of models by engi-
neers is extensive, and few projects of
importance reach the final design unas-
sisted by data and experience gained by
model tests. Such tests are called on by
the designer in the solution of many
problems for the following reasons:—
a. A mathematical analysis is virtu-
ally impossible.
b. Models may be cheaper, quicker,
and more conclusive than possible
complex and tedious pure analysis.
c. The importance of the structure
warrants a model check of the theory
involved.
d. To determine the physical limi-
tations of theoretical formulae based
on necessary assumptions.
e. Models allow three dimensional
studies of mass, color, line, and ar-
rangements under various conditions.
f. Complicated installations can be
checked and simplified for ease of re-
pair, accessibility and operation.
g. Long-time factors in corrosion,
disease-breeding, and the like, can
be investigated and controlled over

'I 'HE machinery governing the design
■*■ of a new military airplane is gen-
erally set in motion when Army Air
Force Authorities request several air-
craft manufacturers to submit plans for
an airplane capable of performing spe-
cific tactical operations. Performance
requirements are stated by the Govern-
ment, and it is the designers' responsi-
bility to meet or surpass these require-
ments. The successful preliminary de-
sign engineer is likely to be one who has
a thorough knowledge of aerodynamics
and structural practices. This qualifi-
cation, coupled with a natural ability to
envision ways of improving a product, is
of primary importance. Preliminary de-
sign engineers may at times be some-
what optimistic in their assumptions.
This is not necessarily an undesirable
feature when one considers that without
vision and optimism on the part of de-
signers, the frail wooden power gliders
conceived by the Wright brothers som?
forty years ago would never have devel-
oped into the giant aircraft which are
today circling the globe. However op-
timistic the designer may be in his

assumptions, he must be certain that
the finished product will be of a practi-
cal and reliable nature, capable of earn-
ing dividends for the manufacturer con-
cerned.
The evolution of most airplanes, both
military and commercial, can generally
be divided into three main categories—
namely, the determination of the out-
side contours and arrangement of eqip-
ment, the detail design of the parts,
and finally the actual static and flight
testing.
Before actual design work is started
on a new model, it is highly advisable to
formulate an outline listing the general
requirements pertinent to the type of
airplane contemplated. This outline 's
sometimes referred to as the Contract
Specification and contains the following
information: (1) high speed at design
altitude, (2) cruising speed at design
altitude, (3) landing speed, (4) stalling
speed, (5) take-off distance, (6) rate
of climb, (7) service ceiling, (8) abso-
lute ceiling, (9) range, (10) fixed equip-
ment, (11) useful load and (12) gen-
eral arrangement of personnel and
equipment.
All of the above factors bear a defi-
nite relationship to each other. For ex-
ample, high speed is obtained by sacri-
ficing increased range and endurance, as
well as low landing speeds; high ma-
neuverability is made possible at an in-
crease in weight and a decrease in sta-
bility; greater range is achieved at a
cost of reduced payload and operating
speeds. Thus, it is obvious that the
various factors mentioned tend to influ-
ence each other, and, in view of this
fact, the designer must compromise and
determine what factor or factors must
be sacrificed in favor of those of greater
importance.
After the general features of the air-
plane are decided upon, the Chief Engi-
neer and Preliminary Design experts go
into a huddle equipped with sliderules,
onion skin, pencils—and last but by no
means least—an eraser.
Several sketches are drawn roughly to
scale to determine the relative positions
of the power plant, wing, empennage
and landing gear. These sketches will
constitute the basis for a General Ar-
rangement Three View drawing, upon
which the following data are specified:
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


incidence, common per cent line of the
wing, M.A.C. (mean aerodynamic
chord); fuselage length, height and
breadth, fuselage reference plane; height
of vertical stabilizer above fuselage and
ground; diameter and location of wheels
in static, compressed and extended posi-
tions, wheel tread, wheel base; static
ground line; horizontal stabilizer span,
root and tip chord; location of rudder,
elevator, aileron and flap hinge lines.
In addition, the total area of the wing
and empennage, as well as the type of
airfoil sections employed, is also noted.
This drawing is then submitted to the
aerodynamicists who will later deter-
mine from wind tunnel tests the final
modifications to be made on all outside
contours.
Immediately after the above drawing
has been completed, a one-eighth scale
Inboard Profile drawing is started. The
position of pilot, crew members, fuel
tanks, seats, armament (if any), and
equipment is indicated. At this point,
engineering personnel of the Controls,
Hydraulics, Electrical, Power Plant, and
Structures Groups are usually called
upon to express their opinions concern-
ing the general arrangement of the air-
plane. Oftentimes valuable suggestions
are made by these engineers and the
drawings are changed to incorporate
new modifications and improvements.
Invariably, the ultimate success of a
new design depends a good deal upon
the closely coordinated efforts of many
engineers while the airplane is still in
the preliminary design stages.
Working in conjunction with the
men who are responsible for laying out
the Inboard Profile drawing is the
Model Shop, whose function is to con-
struct a one-thirtieth scale (or other
convenient size) wooden replica of the
proposed airplane. A special container
in which the model may be moved from
one place to another is also fabricated.
The next step is to submit the draw-
ings to the Army for approval. The
Chief Engineer, sometimes accompanied
by an Aerodynamics expert and Execu-
tive Engineer, generally performs this
duty. In the event that several com-
panies have submitted proposals, the
Army will examine all drawings in addi-
tion to performance data, and, by proc-
ess of elimination, will eventually select
one specific design to fill their needs. A
contract is awarded to the manufac-
turer for one or more experimental air-
planes. The Army usually requests that
three experimental airplanes be con-
structed, one for static tests and the re-
maining two for flight testing purposes.
It is the function of the main engi-
neering department to furnish all lay-
outs and detail drawings which are
needed to facilitate construction of
these airplanes. Particular emphasis is
placed upon the importance of design-
ing parts for production. Thus, if and
when orders are later received to con-
struct additional airplanes, a minimum
of time and effort will be spent in tool-
ing up for mass production.
After the preliminary aerodynamic
studies have been completed, a scale
model is made of the proposed airplane,
which is then tested in the wind tunnel
to determine the following flight charac-
teristics: lift, drag, thrust, pressure dis-
tribution, and stability. These tests will
enable aerodynamicists to furnish the
designer with data pertinent to loads
imposed on the airplane. Most of the
major aircraft companies build at least
one power wind tunnel model and one
plain model of each new design. These
models are constructed to the n'th de-
gree of accuracy and often require as
Static wing testing
long as three months to build. Shown
on a following page is a photo of th'$
Douglas DC-4 (forerunner of Army
C-54) wind tunnel model valued at
$20,000. Built to one-sixteenth scale,
it weighs more than 400 pounds, hav-
ing a wing-spread of 91 inches and a
fuselage length of nearly 72 inches.
Each of the four water-cooled electric
motors develops nearly 15 h.p. at 16,-
500 r.p.m. All of the control surfaces
are movable and mounted on ball bear-
ings. The nose wheel is retractable and
the propeller blades may be adjusted for
pitch. Estimated stress in the tiny pro-
peller blades is calculated to be 60,000
pounds per square inch. This miniature
is believed to be one of the finest power
models in existence and was used to
measure thrust as well as other aerody-
namic characteristics. Plain models
(without motors), fashioned from ma-
hogany, are used to determine pressure
distribution, lift, drag, and stability.
Proceeding simultaneously with wind
tunnel tests is the construction of a full
size wood mock-up, which will be used
to determine the best location for pilot,
instruments, control tubes, cables, doors,
windows, radio and other equipment.
All mock-ups must be approved by the
Army Mock-Up Board. In order that
a mock-up be of maximum value to the
engineering department it must be
completed within 20 to 25% of the total
time required to design and build the
first experimental airplane. In addition
to the mock-up, a full size Body Draft
consisting of both plan and profile
views is oftentimes made. The primary
purpose of the Body Draft is very simi-
lar to that of the Inboard Profile draw-
ing—namely, to indicate the general ar-
rangement of the airplane. It is much
more accurate, however, than the In-
board Profile drawing or wood mock-
up and is usually photographed and re-
duced to a drawing of convenient pro-
portions. Thus, a permanent record of
the airplane is available long after the
wood mock-up has been torn down.;
After the above preliminary studies
are completed, the detail design of
structural members begins. Since weight
is a factor which directly influences the
performance of every airplane, designers
must constantly be on the look out for
means of reducing the weight empty of
aircraft. To illustrate the direct rela-
tionship between weight saved and in-
creased revenue in commercial types,

A single idea often leads to several inventions—devices, machines, methods, and designs.
All may be patentable.
D. JOURNEAUX
Patent Attorney for Allis-Chalmers
Editor's Note: Believing that all engineers should be better informed about patents
and patent procedure, the TECHNIC is printing a series of articles designed to
acquaint the student with the fundamentals involved.
TN SPITE of centuries of exposure to
•*• the challenge of inquisitive minds,
the old adage "Necessity is the mother
of invention" seems never to have been
seriously questioned. Who indeed, upon
seeing a need for improvement, has not
exclaimed: "Somebody ought to invent
something to take care of that!" Then,
if the problem was proposed by someone
with an inventive mind, he immediately
added: "Let me see what I can do about
it."
This little soliloquy, spoken or merely
thought, has probably been the cham-
pagne that launched many of the in-
ventions now making us successful in
war and in peace. An inventor usually
aims to provide some means or device
for accomplishing a useful result,
whether or not a need exists at the mo-
ment.
mere ideas not patentable
The desired result may be new, but
the mere conception of a new result
does not constitute invention, accord-
ing to the standards of the United States
Patent Office, and such a conception is
not enough to warrant a patent in this
country. Patents are granted for a
means for a desired result on condition
that such means be new and constitute
invention.
The means may be altogether new, or
a new combination of old means. It
may serve to produce a new result, or it
may only produce an old result in a
new manner.
But the inventor who has applied for
a patent for his new device very often
has not exhausted the protection avail-
able to him under the patent laws. For
example, he may be able to patent the
methods of operation or the device. On
the other hand, this method may be old
and, therefore, obviously unpatentable;
or it may be new, but no more than
merely the inherent operation of the de-
vice. In the latter case, it is considered
that the device and its operation con-
stitute a single invention and therefore
are not separately patentable.
device and method of
operation patentable
If the method of operation is new
and performed manually or by devices
other than the one sought to be pat-
ented, the device and its method of op-
eration may be separately patentable.
This is true whether or not they oc-
curred simultaneously to the inventor.
Whether the device and its method
should be claimed in separate patents
is merely a question of procedure. If
separate patents are to be obtained,
however, the application for the second
to issue should be made before the first
one issues.
The drawings of a famous pair of
patents, now expired, that were granted
for what might be assumed a single in-
vention are shown in Fig. 1. Patent
555,190 claimed what would now be
called a split phase motor, in which the
main stator circuit, connected to an a-c
source, energizes an auxiliary stator cir-
cuit by induction. Patent 511,915
claimed the method of operation of the
motor by inducing current in one stator
circuit from the other. A court held that
the two patents were for different inven-
tions, on the ground that it was proba-
ble that the patented process could be
utilized in devices which are not the me-
chanical equivalent of the patented mo-
tor. Having made two separate inven-
tions, the inventor was entitled to pat-
ents securing both of them against in-
fringement.
device and machine
for making it
After inventing a new device, the in-
ventor should give some thought, as he
too frequently fails to do, to the possi-
bility of making it. In this connection
he may also invent new manufacturing
processes and new machinery for per-
forming the processes. Of course, the
inventor's mind need not necessarily
follow that particular sequence of
thought. When a device is merely an
improvement of an old device, it may be
hard to determine whether a new ma-
chine was developed for making the im-
proved device, or whether the im-
proved device was the natural result of
the improved machine.
From the viewpoint of patentability,
a machine and its products are entirely
separate, and each may be patented if it
is new. The process performed by the
machine, which is its method of opera-
tion, may however be patented only if
it is new and if it can be performed by
other machines or manually.
The four patent drawings in Fig. 2 il-
lustrate the point. This invention is the
ubiquitous bottle cap. Patent 468,226
is for the bottle cap as developed by its
inventor to about the form in which we
find it today. Patent 792,285 is for an
improvement in the composition of the
sealing gasket in the cap. Patent 792,-
284 is for a method of securing the seal-
ing gasket to either form of cap, and
patent 887,838 covers the machinery for
performing that method.
These four patents have withstood
successfully the test of trial in court.
The single idea of the bottle cap led its
inventor and others to make numerous
other patentable inventions relating to
the form of the cap and to the machin-
ery for making the cap, applying it to a
bottle and, last but not least, removing
it from the bottle.
mechanical and design
patents
The patents so far discussed are all
of the general type known as mechani-
cal patents, which are granted only for
purportedly utilitarian inventions. In-
ventions of a purely ornamental nature,
or design, are presumably without util-

ever, it would be jumping to conclusions
to assume that the Patent Office looks
on ornamentation with contempt. On
the contrary, patents of another type,
called design patents, are granted for
new, original and ornamental designs.
A device invented for a useful pur-
pose and subject to protection by me-
ful and the ornamental features, then

the first.

Likewise, the ice cream cone shown
in Fig. 4 has a new ornamental config-

in the transverse ribs for gripping the

chanical patent may also have ornamen-
tal value. It is also true, although per-
haps less evident, that an ornamental
object of which the design is patentable
may also involve some new and useful
function. The result is that a mechani-
cal patent may be granted for the useful
feature of a device, and a design patent
may be granted for the ornamental fea-
ture of the same device. The two pat-
ents, since they are of different kinds,
are not required to be co-pending in
the Patent Office. If the first of the two
patents to issue discloses both the use-
occurred to its inventor simultaneously.
Both may be patentable, but only if
they are clearly distinguishable from
each other.
For example, the automobile signal
lens shown in Fig. 3 has a useful fea-
ture residing in the provision of opaque
portions and translucent portions hav-
ing particular optical properties. Its
ornamental feature lies in the arrange-
ment of the lettering and border. Only
the useful feature is claimed in the me-
chanical patent, and only the ornamen-
tal feature is claimed in the design pat-

sign of the cone is claimed in the de-

ribs within the cone is claimed in the
mechanical patent.
When the mechanical feature and the
design feature of an object are indistin-
guishable, the grant of both a mechani-
cal patent and a design patent would
amount to granting two patents for the
same thing. For this reason, a mechani-

EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
by
S. S. ATTWOOD
Director of Wave Propagation, Division of War Research, Columbia University
Until a few years ago, the study of
physical theory was divided into half a
dozen or more distinct fields—physics,
chemistry, mechanics, electricity, mag-
netism, light, etc.—each based on its
own group of experimental facts and
hypotheses. Today the distinction be-
tween these fields are superficial, for
the physicist has obtained a deeper in-
sight into physical processes and has a
broader conception of the connections
underlying physical phenomena. The
various fields of study are still retained
for reasons of convenience despite the
development of the electron theory,
which attempts to correlate all physical
phenomena and express the relations in
terms of laws that apply to all fields of
physical theory.
The electron theory rests upon the
recognition of the electrical constitution
of matter, and many of the basic rela-
tions of this theory have been obtained
from studies of electricity and magne-
tism. It is appropriate then to consider
a factual background against which the
more recent developments may stand in
sharp relief.
The first knowledge of these matters
was obtained by the Greeks, who ob-
served that rubbed amber attracts light
particles (600 B.C.). Apparently the
Greeks made no use of this information,
but fourteen hundred years later (A.D.
1000) European navigators were using
suspended magnets or compasses for
guidance of their ships. About two hun-
dred and fifty years later, we find Peter
Peregrinus (1269) shaping a magnet
out of lodestone into the form of a
sphere. By placing a needle at various
points on the sphere and drawing lines
tangent to the needle, Peregrinus found
these lines converging like meridians
toward two points on the sphere's sur-
face, which he called poles.
The observations of Peregrinus were
extended by William Gilbert, physician
to Queen Elizabeth. In his book "De
Magnete," published in 1600, he ex-
plains that he formed a spherical mag-
net of lodestone, drew meridians upon
it which converged at the poles and
noted that it was a counterpart of the
earth. Gilbert floated two magnets and
was able to show that the poles differ
from each other and that like poles
repel and unlike attract each other.
Gilbert is known mainly for his work
on magnetism, but he contributed a
great deal to the knowledge of the be-
havior of electrified bodies by showing
that many other bodies are like amber
in that they too have the ability, when
rubbed, to attract light bodies to
themselves. Gilbert called these bodies
electrics after elektron, which is the
Greek word for amber. Certain other
bodies which failed to exhibit the prop-
erty of amber he called non-electrics.
In 1640, von Guericke, the mayor of
Magdeburg, discovered that electrified
bodies may exhibit repulsion as well as
attraction.
The true character of Gilbert's non-
electrics was not understood until
Stephen Gray (1729) succeeded in
transmitting the "Electrick Vertue"
from a glass rod to another body placed
at some distance by connecting the two
bodies with a non-electric. In modern
terminology, electrics are insulators and
non-electrics are conductors of electric-
ity. Gray's experiments yielded one
other result of importance. By electri-
fying two wooden cubes, one hollow and
the other solid, he showed that they pro-
duced the same effects and concluded
that the electrification is identified with
the surfaces and not the volumes.
The two hundred years that followed
Gray's experiments were extremely pro-
ductive, both in new discoveries and in
the development of significant theory
correlating the observations. The first
quarter of this period was devoted to
the further accumulation of experimen-
tal information.
Du Fay's work (1733), which was in
many respects merely a repetition of
Gray's experiments, is significant in that
he recognized and stated his belief in
the existence of two kinds of electricity,
vitreous and resinous, or + and —, as
suggested later by Franklin. Du Fay
noticed further that like electricities re-
pel whereas unlike kinds attract each
other, and he showed that conductor?
as well as insulators may, with proper
handling, be made to acquire electric
charge.
Von Kleist and von Musschenbroek
(1745 and 1746) independently discov-
ered that electricity from a charged
sphere could be stored in a bottle
if it contained copper wire or mercury.

as in. This soon became known as the
Leyden jar and is identical with the
condenser of the present day. The Ley-
den jar permitted a much larger concen-
tration of electricity and greatly intensi-
fied the spark of discharge, creating a
very considerable interest.
Franklin's famous kite experiment
was undertaken in 1752. He had previ-
ously noted the facility with which a
metallic point will discharge an electri-
fied conductor, and he proposed and
carried out an experiment to "draw off
the fire from the cloud." Franklin's
work brought him world-wide fame and
no doubt helped to reduce the feeling
of superstitious awe held by many with
respect to lightning, though it brought
denunciation from many pulpits for in-
terfering with the wrath of God.
GariMcro*
During the latter part of the eight-
eenth century a great deal of attention
was paid to Galvani's experiments on
"animal electricity." Galvani found
that a muscle of a frog's leg touched by
a piece of metal twitched violently every
time an electrostatic machine placed
nearby was discharged. But presently
he discovered that the effect could be
produced merely by touching the muscle
nerve at two points with a piece of
metal. Opinion was divided as to the
real source of the effect; some thought
with Galvani that the effect was electri-
cal in nature, much like the discharge
of a Leyden jar, others that he had dis-
covered a new fluid of nerve origin.
But Volta believed the real cause lay in
the metals used.
In 1800 Volta found the means for
greatly increasing the strength of the

This diagram shows the fundamentals of the cyclotron which is invaluable in high
speed nuclear research.
Up to Franklin's time, studies in
magnetism and electrostatics had been
entirely qualitative, but in 1785 these
studies were based on a quantitative
basis by Coulomb's work with the tor-
sion balance. Coulomb showed by di-
rect experiment that electric charges
(also magnetic poles) exert forces on
each other that vary, as the inverse
square of the distance. Michel and
Priestley had earlier inferred the in-
verse square law, but the quantitative
study of electricity and magnetism must
be dated from Coulomb's experiments.
This step was particularly significant in
that it made possible the application of
the mathematics developed after New-
ton's enunciation (in about 1600) of
the inverse square law as applied to
gravitational phenomena.
effects. He made the first battery or
"voltaic pile" by placing discs of cop-
per, zinc, and moistened pasteboard in
series, and found that upon closing the
circuit this arrangement gave a continu-
ous electrical effect, whereas the Ley-
den jar had to be reelectrified after each
discharge. Thus the nineteenth century
opened with a clear recognition of the
existence of the electric current and pos-
sessed a method for its generation.
Later in the same year Nicholson and
Carlisle connected a voltaic pile plati-
num wires immersed in water and
showed the decomposition of water into
hydrogen and oxygen. During the next
few years, Humphrey Davy, Grothuss,
and Berzelius sought and discovered
numerous relations between electricity
and chemistry. In particular Davy
passed a current through certain salts
and soon discovered potassium and
sodium. Berzelius is known especially
for his ionic theory that every com-
pound is composed of two parts with
opposite electrifications and that chemi-
cal combination results when oppositely
charged ions unite, giving a stable com-
pound in which the electricities are neu-
tralized.
Meanwhile Poisson (1812) gave im-
petus to the application of mathematics
by his development of the concept of
the potential as applied to electric and
magnetic fields separately. Shortly after
this, observations were made clearly
connecting the hitherto unrelated facts
of electricity and magnetism. Believing
intuitively in this relation, Oersted in
1820 more or less accidentally noticed
the deflection of a compass placed near
an electric current, and discovered the
converse, the deflection of an electric
current by a magnet.
Spurred on by this discovery, Am-
pere almost immediately devised simple
experiments which demonstrated the
force relations between two circuits car-
rying currents, and showed that the
magnetic effects of a current and those
of a permanent magnet are similar in
nature. Fifty years later Clark Max-
well, appreciating the significance of
Ampere's work, referred to him as the
"Newton of Electricity."
The years 1821-23 result in three
more important contributions: The in-
vention of the first direct-current motor
by Faraday (1821), who produced con-
tinuous motion of a wire carrying cur-
rent about a magnetic pole; the first
demonstration of current induction by
Arago (1824), who showed that a disc
of copper revolving beneath a compass
placed coaxially causes the latter to ro-
tate; and the construction of the first
electro-magnet by Sturgeon (1825).
The year 1827 saw the formulation of
Ohm's Law (E=IR), which was the
first statement of the existence of a
quantitative relation between the elec-
tric charge movement or current flow,
the strength of the battery (voltage or
potential), and the reaction coefficient
of the circuit itself (resistance). The re-
sults of Ohm's experiments relating to
the conditions which govern the pres-
ence and quantity of current and of
Ampere's investigations of its magnetic
and force effects form the foundations
for the applications of electricity and
magnetism to direct-current engineering.

It has often been said that religion
and science do not mix. To realize th?
fallacy of this statement one needs only
to meet Wayne Middleton, for in him
may be found the perfect example of a
combination between an excellent engi-
neer and ardent theologist.
As a senior at Ann Arbor High School,
Wayne had some intentions of entering
the ministry upon the completion of his
course.
Wayne B. Middleton
"a man of faith of physics"
Shortly before his graduation, Profes-
sor Cork, of the Physics Department,
offered young Middleton a job as an as-
sistant on the Cyclotron. The intricacies
of the Atom Smasher fascinated Wayne
and he became very interested in his
work. After three years in this position
he at last had accumulated enough capi-
tal to continue his education. Now the
choice had to be made between a place
in science or in the ministry. Wayne
chose to enter a field in which he had
both experience and interest—electrical
engineering..
While continuing his work for the
NTS
Physics department he proceeded to
advance through the University. Now,
as a graduating senior, he is Chairman
of A.I.E.E., a member of Eta Kappa
Nu, and Vice-President of Tau Beta Pi.
The complexities of the cyclotron no
longer faze him and after six years serv-
ice he is now in charge of the work on
this machine. In his spare time last se-
mester he taught an E.E. 2A Lab Sec-
tion.
Though he chose Engineering as his
profession, Wayne has remained very
actively connected with religion. Besides
being a member of the church choir and
male quartet, he is superintendent of a
local Sunday School. Wayne believes
that religion is by faith, while science
is seeing and believing, and that the two
disagree with each other within thin
limitations. He claims nature has a defi-
nite system, and since nature is the work
of God, the more he sees of science, the
firmer his faith in religion becomes.
perfect teacher
When a professor has reached the
point where his students say he is the
perfect teacher, you probably could say
that he has "arrived." By this token,
Professor Ben Dushnik of our Engi-
neering Math Department has "ar-
rived." His former students have de-
scribed him as a person who not only
aids and encourages learning, but one
who is explicit and complete in explan-
ation, as well as fair and unprejudiced
in marking. This, we think, is an
achievement well-deserving of praise.
To see the factors going to make up
such a person, let us look into the past
a bit. Professor Dushnik came to the
United States from Russia just before
the first World War, in 1914, at the
age of sixteen. When he arrived, he
made his way to Detroit, where Cen-
tral High School found in its halls, a
boy who was, first, to become a student
at the University of Michigan and,
later, a faculty member.
Professor Dushnik graduated from
Michigan with an A.B. Following this,
in 1925, he became an instructor in the
College of Engineering. A year later,
he received his M.A. and, in 1930, his
Ph.D. From his position as instructor,
Professor Dushnik has risen to his pres-
ent well-earned position as Assistant
Professor in the Math Department. In
addition to his teaching, Professor
Dushnik has found time to do some


Ben Dushnik
"chessplayer deluxe"
mathematical research on the Point Set
Theory.
In his leisure moments, Professor
Dushnik has somehow managed to be-
come an accomplished chess player,
even to the point of once having played,
to a draw, the world champion chess
player, Laska, in 1924. Moreover, he
plays bridge well enough to have partici-
pated in several local tournaments.
Thus, if you see a medium-sized,
dark gentleman, with a mustache and
a slight foreign accent—found over in
West Engine any place but in his office
in the Annex—you will be gazing upon
a man who is not only thought of as a
perfect teacher by his students, but who
is mathematician, chessplayer, and
bridge player; Assistant Professor Ben
Dushnik.

EXPLOR

man made fog
Having proved its worth in the North
African, Sicilian, and Italian campaigns,
a new smoke made from a petroleum
product is now being used on many bat-
tlefronts. Major General Wm. N. Por-
ter, Chief of the Army Chemical War-
fare Service, recently said, "Smoke is
our greatest protective weapon. It is
the greatest life saver of our troops."
By blotting out critical battle areas, it
is not possible for the enemy to shell or
bomb anything in that area effectively.
The white, cloud-like smoke can hide a
target completely, even from low-flying
enemy airplanes.
Two machines, operating on the same
principles, have been developed to gen-
erate the smoke. The first one, techni-
cally designated Ml. has had battle
experience, while the second, the M-2,
has just been produced. The M-l ma-
chine, which is truck or trailer driven, is
larger than the second generator, and
will probably find its main use in pro-
tecting cities, seaports, airfields and
permanent large installations. Its little
brother, however, produces half as much
smoke but is only V&gt;0th as bulky, and
can be successfully used in action on
beachheads and front line trenches.
In the generators, which contain
small metal boilers, air blowers, and
pumps, a mixture of the petroleum prod-
uct and water is vaporized in heating
coils. This vapor, at a high temperature,
emerges from small vents into the open
air, at a velocity comparable to the
speed of sound. It condenses into bil-
lows of snow-white fog. composed of bil-
lions of microscopic droplets, less than
three hundred-thousandths of an inch
in diameter. This smoke will remain in
the air until thinned and blown about
by air currents, whereas particles of a
larger size would be too heavy, and
would settle to the earth rather quicky.
Two quarts of the fog oil solution will
blanket an area the size of an average
city block. With favorable wind con-
ditions, one of the midget M-2 gener-
tors can screen an area about 200 yards
wide and five miles long, and the M-l
machine a correspondingly greater space.
This dense new smoke, wrapping up a
critical area in an impenetrable fog, is
not harmful, and is of no discomfort to
troops working within that region.
fused quartz
This war has been responsible for un-
told misery and destruction on a grand
scale. However, it has also been respon-
sible for startling wonders of science,
which have been mushrooming out of
the brains of scientists, from drafting
boards, and from laboratories.
One of the most startling weapons
used by Americans to help win the war
on the battlefront of science is a mate-
rial known as FUSED QUARTZ.
Chemical, electronic, and production
design engineers today are all swamping
the material's producers with orders for
this wonder emerged from a test tube.
According to their opinion, this is one
of the most remarkable materials now-
available to engineers and scientists, al-
most immeasurable in the breadth of its
possibilities. For instance, it has a co-
efficient of expansion that is but one-
seventh that of glass and far lower than
any type of steel, lower in fact than
that of any other known material. It
has unique optical properties, being un-
usually transparent, and having the
highest transmission of ultra violet of
all known materials except crystal
quartz and fluorite. Unlike the above
mentioned materials, however, quartz
lends itself well to commercial fabrica-
tion.
It transmits light in a very wide
range of wave lengths, starting in the
ultra violet and going through the infra
red to a wave-length of over 40,000 ang-
stroms. Because of that quality it is a
widely used material in therapeutic
work as well as in work connected with
irradiation of food products.
Like no other material, quartz lends
itself to use as a measurement standard
because it doesn't expand with heat.
Probably the closest thing in the world
to a perfectly flat surface is the optical
flat finished by the U. S. Bureau of
Standards. Made of fused quartz, the
disk is as large as 10 in. in diameter
and 1VL&gt; inches thick, and its surface
does not depart more than four ten-mil-
lionths (0.000,0004") of an inch -from
a true plane. It is obvious that for
gauges such material is ideal.
Fused Quartz is already used very ex-
tensively, especially for high voltage in-
sulation, because of its high resistivity
and low dielectric losses, particularly at

ENGINE COUNCIL
The Engineering Council, a repre-
sentative group of engineering students,
is composed of two members from each
class and representatives from the vari-
ous engineering honorary and technical
societies and technical publications.
Also invited to participate in council
activities is the president of the Senior
class, when he is elected.
Certain members of the Engineering
Council make up the Honor Council,
which tries any offenses of the honor
system. Although the honor system has
been suspended from the Freshmen and
Sophomore classes, the council hopes
to reinstate it for these two classes
"after the duration."
The engineering council tries to col-
laborate the meetings of the various so-
cieties, so that interested parties will
not be confronted with a conflict. An-
other of the council's functions is that
of sponsoring, along with the TECH-
NIC, the annual Engineering-Slide Rule
Ball. In former years it was also the
custom to hold smokers and engineer-
ing open houses, but these, too, will not
reappear until peacetime activities are
again in full swing.
The class dues, which are collected
under the council's supervision, are dis-
tributed to the funds of each class.
These dues serve to benefit the student
when he becomes an alumnus. This
includes alumni publications and other
benefits of this sort.
The council is anxious to receive
suggestions from the rest of the stu-
dent body, and will do its best to act
on any matters which are under its
jurisdiction. Any suggestions dropped
in the council box in West Engineering
or left in the secretary's office will be
welcomed.
Although the council is not quite as
active as it has been in past years, it
will continue to function in order that
it can be kept alive to form a solid
foundation for student government in
the Engineering College after the war.

VULCANS
On Thursday October 12, 1944, a
banquet and initiation were held by
Vulcans, Senior Engineering Honor
Society. The following men are the
new members:
Richard J. Bard
Richard P. Barnard
Thomas E. Bliska
William J. Culligan
John D. Jenswold
Arthur N. LeRoux
Donald Z. MacKinnon
Paul R. O'Hara
Wilmer G. Pierson
Arthur W. Renner
James E. Wallis
Vulcans was formed in 1904 for
the purpose of uniting the outstanding
Seniors of the College of Engineering
into an organization to enable them to
better serve themselves, their class-
mates, and the University. The society
is not one honoring only scholarship or
activities, but one recognizing and
uniting the leaders in all fields.
There are over 400 members of Vul-
cans some of the more famous of
whom are:
A. H. White, '04, Professor of Chemical
Engineering
W. H. Gerhauser, '11, President of
American Shipbuilding Company
Willard H. Dow, '19, President of Dow
Chemical.
This year the Vulcans plan to
erect a monument near the West Engi-
neering Building. The monument will
consist of an anvil with "VULCANS
1904" cast on the side, mounted on a
concrete base with the date of erection
formed in concrete.
A.I.E.E.
The American Institute of Electrical
Engineers held its first meeting of the
year, jointly with the A.S.M.E., on No-
vember ISth.
A representative from General Elec-
tric spoke on "Power in War." His talk
included a demonstration of General
Electric products such as electrically-
heated flying suits, hand grenades, and
turbo-superchargers.
Especially invited to this meeting
were Navy V-12 trainees, and fresh-
men interested in Electrical Engineer-
ing. Both of these groups were urged by
the A.I.E.E. to participate in further
activities of the institute during the
coming school year.

S.W.E.
The Society of Women Engineers,
which is open to any woman enrolled
in the College of Engineering, held its
first meeting on Wednesday, November
8. At this time, the Society outlined
plans for the coming school year.
The Society of Women Engineers was
originally organized to petition for the
right of incoming women engineers to
have a separate orientation group. This
was necessary because, up to that date,
women engineering students had been
ioriented with art students and were
not acquainted with the engine school
at all when they began classes there.
The petition was granted; a constitu-
tion was submitted; and the Society of
Women Engineers was legally recog-
nized on campus. Since then, the tiny
gold slide rule with a guard bearing the
intials SWE has become a familiar pin
in the halls of engine school.
Other aims of the society include the
desire to acquaint women engineers with
each other and to encourage them to
help one another.
Limited membership has heretofore
been a hindrance to any great amount
of activity on the part of the society,
but the increasing influx of women
promises to help overcome this obstacle.
Just this semester, twenty women have
enrolled as freshmen in the College of
Engineering.
The members of the Society would
like to urge all non-members to attend
meetings and meet their fellow engi-
neers. The society welcomes all women
engineers to membership and will be
happy to help them in any way possible.
Further information may be obtained
in the TECHNIC Office.

The Problem
An enemy bomber is sighted
5 miles away, 3 miles high, fly-
ing fast. He's within range of
your 90 mm. anti-aircraft bat-
tery. A shell will take perhaps
20 seconds to reach him, but
meanwhile he'll have flown
nearly 2 miles. How could
you possibly tell where to aim
to hit such a speeding target?
How the Gun Director solves it
Enemy plane (1) is spotted and followed
by Tracker (2) and Height Finder (3),
which feed information into Altitude
Converter (4) and Computer (5). Swiftly
the Computer plots the plane's dis-
tance, course and speed—aims the gun
(6) and sets the fuse of the shell to
burst at a calculated point (7) for a hit.
This electrical brain—the Computer
'—thinks of everything. It figures on: (A)
muzzle velocity of gun; (B) shell drift to
the right due to its spin; (C) air density;
(D) time of shell's flight; (E) downward
pull of gravity; (F) direction and veloc-
ity of wind; (C) even the distance be-
tween Tracker and gun!
Developed by Bell Telephone Labora-
tories men working with Army Ord-
nance experts, and made by Western
Electric, the electrical Gun Director
has made our anti-aircraft fire more ac-
curate than ever. Its production called
for the solution of many technical prob-
lems by engineers at Western Electric.

Well, here we are again. Another
day, another dollar. Another month,
and here we are broke again. There's
a good excuse this time, though. Some
of the staff took a little jaunt over to
Milwaukee to see our brave, gallant,
courageous, stalwart, undaunted heroes
battle Marquette's team. That cost
money.
What the team did at Milwaukee is
common knowledge, but our doings in

that great metropolis can only now be
revealed. The following is an eyewit-
ness account.
"Our small expedition left Ann Arbor
Friday afternoon, and by evening we
had penetrated the enemy camp at
East Lansing. Undiscovered, we pro-
ceeded deep into enemy territory and
inspected their engineering installations.
Having accomplished this mission, we
invaded a local mess line. Despite bit-
ter hand to hand fighting we succeeded
in holding our own against enemy forces
and thoroughly enjoyed our chow.
Under cover of darkness, our inva-
sion force (mechanized by virtue of a
U.S. Auto, Chevrolet, M1941, Master
Deluxe, GH4476) again moved through
enemy outposts, this time into neutral
territory, Grand Rapids.
Here our troops were received by
friendly natives, who replenished our
diminishing supplies of 99 44/100 oc-
tane gas, food, ammunition in the form
of cowbells, and first aid supplies in the
form of snake bite remedies and heart
stimulants.
Having satisfied himself that all pos-
sible precautions against enemy sur-
prise had been taken, our commanding
officer ordered the men to turn in for a
good night's rest.
In order to arrive in time to reinforce
our brave, gallant, courageous, stalwart,
undaunted heroes in their coming battle,
we cut the good night down to two
hours, and leaving our bivouac area
many hours before the crack of dawn,
sped on to Ludington, our port of em-
barkation. Due to a mixup in orders,
there was a two hour wait before we
could board our landing craft. We there-
fore decided to explore the town. In a
reputedly respectable business establish-
ment, our Intelligence department dis-
covered two curiously worded signs
and removed them as indications of
possible enemy activity in the neigh-
borhood. The enemy's code puzzled
and intrigued us. These two messages
were respectively: "Have a Coke!" and
"Keep Feet Off Seats."
An hour before dawn, we boarded the
craft which was to take us across Lake
Michigan to the hostile Wisconsin
shore.
Our headquarters, prominently iden-
tified by a WELCOME MICHIGAN
ALUMNI banner, were promptly estab-
lished on the site of the Plankinton
Hotel. The check room was our quar-
termaster's depot and the bar, our USO.
Having quenched our thirst on long
cool delicious glasses of that much ad-
vertised Schlitz product, we decided to
employ the remaining hours of daylight
in making a quick reconnaisance of the
town.
The rest is history. The battle was
joined at 8 p.m., and by 10 o'clock, the
whole world was ringing with the news:
Michigan 14—Marquette 7.
And so we left the pleasant bloodied
battlefield which was Marquette Sta-
dium. We had no regrets at our de-
parture, for like the prodigal son, we
Here it is November—the time for
elections, turkey dinners, and 1300 co-
eds. Yes sir, it's co-eds three to one
(three to_ every man, that is). Yeah,
verily, they are everywhere. 'Twas only
the other day that we perceived a piece
of lingerie being aired from a Chi Phi
house window. (It may be prudent to
explain, at this point, that the aforesaid
is now a women's residence hall.)
And, as the women are plentiful, so
the cigarettes are scarce. It's getting
so that a guy won't take a girl out un-
less she's got a carton of Camels cached
away someplace.
In engine school, where the male to
female ratio is still approximately 20
to 1, the situation is not too serious
(damn it all!).
Although more and more women are
appearing on engineering college cam-
puses throughout the country; some,
like the Northwestern engineer are still

intent on demanding the unattainable.
Herewith follows:
The Northwestern Engineer's Dream
Girl.
The waves of her potassium cyanide
colored hair (average diameter .01 cm.)
are like the graph of Y equals sin X.
The light reflected from her eyes is
analaguous to that transmitted through
a half-normal solution of copper nitrate
in H..O. The color of her cheeks has a
wave length of .00058 mm. and her lips
have a specific heat of .0001. Her fig-
ure reminds one of a hyperboloid and
her skin is as smooth as the surface of
a Johannsen block. Her voice is rich
in overtones and the radiations of her
personality vary inversely as the square
of the distance. The touch of her hand
is similar to the surprising discharge of
a 10,000 volt condenser. The photo-
metric value of her smile is 100,000
foot-candles when illuminated by hall-
way lights. The shimmering envelope
of her calf is indeed a non-Euclidean
skew surface.

What you should know about the Timken Bearing-
MATERIAL — Measure of Endurance
Design, manufacturing precision and material
all make important contributions to the out-
standing performance of Timken Tapered
Roller Bearings. None of these is more valuable
than another; each plays its definite part in
the attainment of Timken Bearing superiority.
The material used in the production of Timken
Bearings is Timken Electric Furnace Alloy
Steel manufactured in our own modern steel
plant under a rigid system of quality con-
trol that assures a consistently superior and
uniform product.
This is a case-carburized steel, having an ex-
tremely hard surface that practically defies
wear and a tough core that provides the neces-
sary strength through resistance to stress and
shock. This combination is a tremendous fac-
tor of Timken Bearing endurance and life.
Timken Alloy Steel has achieved an interna-
tional reputation for quality and now is used
for many purposes other than Timken Bear-
ings. It has played a leading role in America's
war effort in all kinds of fighting equipment
on land, sea and in the air.

Far-reaching as these results proved
to be, we have still to consider the much
more significant contributions of Mi-
chael Faraday, who even now stands
out as the greatest experimental scien-
tist. Hundreds of investigations are de-
scribed in his "Experimental Researches
in Electricity". The most important,
perhaps, are those in which he set out to
find, and did discover (1831), that an
electric current changing in time in-
duces an electromotive force in nearby
conductors properly placed. This dis-
overy made possible present-day alter-
nating-current applications, though fifty
years passed before any use was devel-
oped.
We are indebted to Faraday for the
next great stride. Before his time ex-
perimenters focused their attention on
what we might call the end effects—
the electricity and the magnetism which
cause certain phenomena and the phe-
nomena themselves. Faraday intuitively
felt that the intervening space or sub-
stance subjected to electric or magnetic
influence was the region that would re-
pay careful study. Experimenting with
condensers, he found that their capaci-
ties were altered by the substitution of
other materials for air, and he devised
a most convenient system of tabulating
substances according to their specific in-
ductive capacities or dielectric con-
stants.
Very soon Sir William Thomson
(later Lord Kelvin) began his distin-
guished career as a physicist, which re-
sulted in valuable contributions to the
study and clarification of ideas concern-
ing electricity. He early rescued from
oblivion an essay on the potential func-
tion of mathematics written by George
Green in 1828, and by giving a simple
interpretation of the concept of poten-
tial developed one of the most powerful
theoretical tools of applied mathematics.
Kelvin did more than any other man
to emphasize the importance of accurate
measurement of physical observations.
thus striking the keynote of modern
physical methods. Measurement calls
for units of reference. Kelvin was largely
responsible for devising the C.G.S. elec-
trostatic and electromagnetic systems of
units based on the point electric charge
and point magnetic pole respectively.
In 1856 Weber and Kohlrausch found
that the ratio between the electrostatic
and electromagnetic units of measure-
ment was 3 x 10 10, a number very close
to the velocity of light. The explana-
tion of this result was not made until
Maxwell's work appeared.
Toward the middle of the nineteenth
century, scientists came to realize more
and more clearly that all physical phe-
nomena have a common underlying
physical quantity—energy. The facts
and ideas concerning energy and its
transformations are summed up in the
theory of thermodynamics, so called be-
cause the main outlines were obtained
through the study of heat phenomena.
Joule showed in 1845 that the expendi-
ture of a definite amount of mechanical
energy always results in the production
of a definite number of heat units. In
1847 Hemholtz wrote a memorable
paper on the "conservation of energy."
Five years later Kelvin and Clausius de-
veloped the foundations of thermody-
namics, summed up in the well-known
first and second laws of thermodynam-
ics, which may be stated rather loosely
to be:
First Law. Accompanying any physi-
cal change, energy may be transformed
from one state to another but without
any change in its total amount. (This is
the law of the conservation of energy.)
Second Law. Whenever energy is
transformed from one state to another a
portion appears in the form of heat.
(This is the law of degradation of
energy. According to this view, heat is
the lowest form of energy, to which in
time all energy will degenerate.)
Thus there was developed the "doc-
trine of energy," which underlies mod-
ern theories.
The foundations of the "classical
theory" had been laid, and it was time
for one to arise who could gather to-
gether the isolated facts of experiment
and could weld the parts into a unified
structure by the use of mathematical
tools. Clerk Maxwell (1873) performed
this task so thoroughly that for many
years it was felt that there remained
little more to be done. Maxwell's con-
tribution was more than a mere coordi-
nation of the results obtained by others.
By developing Faraday's suggestion
that the region surrounding the electric-
ity or current is of great importance
Maxwell was led to make an assumption
that has since proved to be a forward
step of paramount importance, namely,
that even in free space an electric field
changing in time must be regarded as a
"displacement electric current." The in-

corporation of this assumption into the
statement of the previous theory led him
to a set of relations now known as Max-
well's Equations, which assert that elec-
tric and magnetic fields, if changing
in time, generate each other and by their
combined action propagate energy as
waves out into space with the velocity
of light. Thereafter it was but a short
step to the assertion that light is nothing
but an electromagnetic wave phenome-
non. Common enough today, the idea
was a veritable bombshell to physicists
of the nineteenth century.
Such revolutionary ideas usually re-
ceive slow credence. But fifteen years
later (1888) Hertz was able to verify
Maxwell's prediction as to the electro-
magnetic wave character of light by
discharging an induction coil through a
sphere gap which emitted waves out
into space. These waves, reaching the
other end of Hertz's laboratory, caused
a series of sparks to jump across a spark
gap placed in a metallic ring. By 1901,
Marconi, using these waves, was suc-
cessfully transmitting messages by wire-
less. Thus Maxwell's work must ever
remain one of the great contributions
to science—a triumph for theoretical in-
vestigation.
Many scientists naively believed that
the main outlines of science had been
firmly established by the development
and verification of the classical theory,
but they were rudely shaken from their
complacence by the advent of a new
series of experiments, which resulted in
the discovery of X-rays by Roentgen in
1895, of new types of emanations from
salts by Becquerel in 1896, from radium
by Mme. Curie in 1898. These discov-
eries together with many new facts ac-
quired through the study of the conduc-
tion of electricity through gases at low
pressures indicated the existence of phe-
nomena that could not be explained by
the classical theory. Maxwell's contri-
bution was not overthrown, however; it
must be regarded as incomplete rather
than incorrect. He treated the behavior
of large groups of atoms, and developed
laws which describe the group action
under certain conditions. Such laws
must be regarded as the "statistical av-
erages" of the operations of the group
composed of many individuals and can-
not be applied to the individuals them-
selves. New methods of study and new
points of view were found to be neces-
sary for consideration of the individual
particle, and since the advent of the
twentieth century many physicists have
made this subject the focus of their re-
search. They have gathered many new
experimental facts and have developed
new theories to account for them, and
their work has produced a picture of the
atom which shows that it is composed
of the basic electrical elements, positive
and negative charges.
As long ago as the Grecian period,
philosophers speculated upon the possi-
bility that all substances might be di-
visible into ultimate units or atoms.
Not, however, until the development of
chemistry do we find the concept of the
atom based upon an experimental rather
than a speculative foundation. Begin-
ning with the superstitious searchings of
the alchemists, centuries of painstaking
study and research passed before the
supernatural was eliminated and the
culmination of the chemical approach to
the mystery of the atom was given in
the Periodic Table of the Elements by
Mendeleef in 1870. After arranging the
elements according to their relative
atomic weights, Mendeleef formed the
list of atoms into seven groups in each
of which similar chemical and physical
properties are found. Experiments in
chemistry, though extremely valuable,
yield information about the interactions
between atoms rather than knowledge of
the inner electrical nature of the atom.
The latter problem has been approached
only by the methods of the modern
atomic physicist.
As early as 1833, Faraday was forced
to suggest, though reluctantly, lhat elec-
tricity might be atomic in nature. He
was led to this assumption by his stud-
ies in electrolysis, which showed him
that a definite quantity of elecricity
passing through an electrolyte deposit
out of solution a definite quantity of the
material forming the electrolyte. Fur-
ther investigations in this field brought
many new facts to light, but an even
more fruitful source of knowledge wa.;
found in the study of the passage of
electricity through gases at low pres-
sures.
Though Watson began work along
this line in 1752, no striking results
were obtained until 1878, when Crookes.
aided by Giessler's new type of mer-
cury-air pump giving a higher vacuum,
produced his very striking display oi
electrical discharges through gas at a
low pressure, which are called "cathode
rays." But it is really to Sir J. J. Thom-
son that we are most indebted for our
knowledge of the "cathode ray." The
end result of this series of study and
experiment (1894) was the definite as-
surance that the "cathode rays" are par-

YOU'VE seen pictures of long range
fighter planes with their"belly tanks"
that carry extra gasoline. But have you ever
wondered how the pilot gets rid of those
tanks when they're empty, to decrease
weight and gain extra speed and maneu-
verability?
The big problem in dropping the tank is
to sever a tight pipeline connection from
tank to plane quickly and positively. This
isn't easy with metal, but Corning now
makes a fitting from glass tubing that does
the trick.The minute the pilot releases the
mechanical grips that carry the weight of
the tank the glass tubing breaks cleanly
and the tank falls free!
War and Corning Research have put glass
in a lot of strange places. For instance,
there was a time when almost all piping
in chemical plants was alloy of one kind
or another. Now chemical people have
discovered that glass piping is better for
many purposes, and Corning has even
developed a method for welding it into
continuous lengths.
Many of the new uses to which Corning
has put glass will persist after the war.
For many users have discovered for the
first time how really versatile glass is as a
material. They are finding out that it has
unexpected strengths.That it resists
abrasive wear and corrosion. That •
it is so fatigue proof Corning has
even made springs of coiled glass •
for certain conditions. Perhaps after the
war, in whatever business you choose to
follow, you will also find that an intelli-
gent application of glass can improve

recently stated that every pound saved
was worth $4dO.OO throughout the first
five years of the life of the plane. To
add to the designers' problems, all parts
must be located in such a manner as not
to disturb the correct balance of the air-
plane. Heavy items such as crew, bat-
tery, radio, fuel tanks, etc., should be
located as nearly as possible to the cen-
ter of gravity. This is especially true in
smaller types of aircraft.
As mentioned previously in this pa-
per, parts must be designed for mass
production. All effort put into simplify-
ing aircraft design will pay untold divi-
dends. Each hole drilled and each
flange formed is considered an opera-
tion. The fewer the operations required
to manufacture various parts, the bet-
ter adapted an airplane will be for mass
production techniques.
The Loft Department is held respon-
sible for the development of the con-
tours of the airplane (per the prede-
termined limitations of Preliminary De-
sign and Aerodynamics), fairing of sur-
faces, determination of offsets, bevels
and so forth. This Department prepares
full size lines layouts which are neces-
sary for detail design and tooling pur-
poses. Upon receiving the above infor-
mation, the Metal Drafting Group pre-
pares full size layouts of fuselage
frames, wing ribs, spars, etc, and for-
wards these to the Photo Drawing Lab-
oratory. The latter then coordinates en-
gineering drafting with loft and template
procedure by making photographic re-
productions of sheet metal structures on
sensitized metal. These will serve as
patterns for the sheet metal parts of the
airplanes produced by the manufac-
turer. Generally, only three sets of
parts are made to be used on the first
three prototypes. Since it would entail
much expense to manufacture special
forgings for each and every fitting on
experimental types, it is deemed wiser
to machine the first fittings out of bar
stock. Later, when contracts have been
signed for a larger number of airplanes,
fittings will be cast or forged. Often-
times sheet metal parts having double
contour are formed by hand for the
first few experimental aircraft. In order
to facilitate improved fabrication and
assembly of airplanes, some companies
prefer to fabricate each half of the fu-
selage separately. The two components
are then brought together on assembly.
Upon completion of the three models
of a new airplane, one of the experi-
mental airplanes is statically tested.
Wings, fuselage, floors, tail surfaces and
landing gear are subjected to loads sim-
ulating as closely as possible the actual
flight, maneuver and landing conditions.
The thoroughness of such a test on a
large four-engine airplane (see photos)
is best illustrated by the fact that ten
or more huge hydraulic cylinders, capa-
ble of exerting a force of 50,000 pounds,
are employed. In an airplane of the
DC-4 class it may become necessary to
load the fuselage with 100,000 pound
or more of pig load to resist the for
applied to the wings during the te
Maximum strength without excessin
structural weight is insured if failure &gt;
the structure occurs at the optimu
load. Tests such as those described in
the preceding paragraph constitute
vital, final check on the safety of
structure. After the airplane has
ground tested over all possible types
surfaces: smooth concrete, gravel,
mud and grass, it is ready to take
the air.
Exhaustive tests on takeoff, clir
speed, maneuverability and dives
made. Although military airplanes
tested by the Experimental Flight Te
Division of the company concerne
they must, nevertheless, be submitt
to Wright Field engineers and Arr
pilots for subsequent testing and final
approval.
Mass production of the airplane will
begin after flight tests have been con-
cluded and orders have been placed for
a specified number of aircraft.
It should be pointed out that the pro-
cedure of design as outlined in the fore-
going paragraphs will perhaps vary with
individual manufacturers. It is believed,
however, that this paper describes the
technique employed by most of the
larger aircraft companies.

University of Michigan Naval Tank,
Ann Arbor, Mich., 1906
When the West Engineering building
was proposed, Dean Cooley conceived
and had incorporated into the plans
provisions for a naval testing tank. His
justification for the contemplated in-
vestment was based on the following
reasons:
a. The United States Navy Tank
at Washington was fully occupied with
naval work and hence was unavailable
for merchant ship experimental re-
search.
b. Development of shipping on the
Great Lakes afforded a field for direct
contributions by the University to ship
design with benefit to the citizens of
Michigan.
c. A sub-flume in the bottom of the
tank was to be connected to the hy-
draulic laboratory, providing ample
water supply for the testing of pumps
and water wheels.
d. The tank room galleries were to
be utilized when needed for research in
the transmission of compressed air
through long pipe lines.
Construction of the West Engineer-
ing building was started in 1902 and
completed in 1904-05. During construc-
tion the tank was extended 100 feet out-
side the main buildings at the sugges-
tion of Professor Sadler. In a few years
however, the building was itself length-
ened over and beyond the tank, thereby
permitting the construction of an ad-
ditional 50 feet of tank. This latter ad-
dition to tank length has never been
flooded and put to use due to prior de-
mand for floor space. Decked over with
temporary planking there was thus pro-
vided two rooms, since used by the
Electrical Engineering Department. At
the present time the extra length of run
is badly needed and will be made avail-
able when further expansion of the En-
gineering College is developed.
The bottom of the tank over the 300
foot length is semi-elliptical in cross
section, being 22 feet wide and about 9
feet 6 inches deep, with a wetted area of
about 185 square feet. A 3 foot by 4
foot flume, wood covered, extends the
tank length below the normal bottom.
All apparatus was designed by Dr. Sad-
ler and the staff and, with the exception
of the car, built in the University shops.
The towing car was furnished by the
Russell Wheel &amp; Foundry Company of
Detroit in 1904. The towing speed
limit is about 480 feet per minute in
high gear.
Up to 1936 practically all models
were made of paraffin wax. They were
cast in a clay bed, roughly to form.
The waterlines then were cut on a pan-
tograph-controlled twin rotary cutter
machine, the final shape being hand fin-
ished. The advantages of this technique
were:
a. Cheapness, as the wax could be
melted up when the use of the model
was at end, and recast over and over
again.
b. Ease of alterations and repeated
use of the same model bulk by recut-
ting.
c. A single parent set of lines could
be used, through adjustment of the ma-
chine controls, to produce a family of
models for research investigations.
The disadvantages were sagging or
hogging due to the high temperature
throughout much of the year, and
change in frictional resistance of the
wax surface due to weathering. As the
tank work gradually shifted to projects
involving single models and minor
changes in form, it was decided in 1936
to standardize on wood models. These
are glued up from % inch lifts of white
pine cut to shape on the band saw and
finished by hand to transverse tern-
plated.
Improvements in testing technique
and apparatus have been made as re-
quired, but in time a more modern dy-
namometer and car with new rails will
be installed when funds are available. A
unique feature of the University Tank is
the 140 foot false bottom which can be
adjusted in depth to simulate shoal
water conditions. This is the only facil-
ity for such tests in the United States
and is in continuous demand for the de-
velopment of towboats and barges op-
erating on the Mississippi and Ohio Riv-
ers, and other inland waterways.
The staff have always been active as
consultants in design, powering, pro-
pellers, stability, Admiralty Court
cases, and other phases of ship con-
struction and operation, particularly
with reference to Great Lakes freight
and passenger shipping. While the pub-
lications by the faculty have been im-
portant, the number of articles has been
limited by the nature of much of the
work carried out in the Naval Tank.
Pure research work has been reported
as papers before the several national

professional societies. Almost all of the
research and testing done for govern-
mental of private interests, however, is
generally of a restricted nature and in
wartime, confidential. Projects on which
the staff have acted as consultants or
experts seldom are available or suitable
for general publication, although the
experience and results have been of
extreme value to the educational func-
tions of the department.
Recent Activities. A utilization of the
naval tank perhaps not originally con-
templated by Dean Cooley is its value
as a national asset during the past and
present wars. Shipping, combatant and
supply, is the vital tool for successfully
carrying on a global campaign. In line
with the use of other University facili-
ties the naval tank has been active in
the urgent development of marine de-
sign and construction and other military
projects. This work has been done for
the Army and Navy Departments, the
Coast Guard, Maritime Commission,
and numerous shipyards and designers.
A brief list of several of these activities
will suffice to illustrate the essential na-
ture of the tank's work.
1. The correction of yaw in the over-
seas towing of large floating equipment
for the Army. The same type of work
was done on coastwise oil barges for the
Army Engineers.
2. The design of hull forms, towing
and mooring arrangements for the large
program of floating dry docks used by
the Navy as advanced bases.
3. Solution of launching problems in
connection with the heavy Great Lakes
ice breaker now under construction at
Toledo for the Coast Guard.
4. The design and testing of amphib-
ian tractors for the Navy.
5. The design of hull and propellers
for several hundred Army Supply ves-
sels. The tank developed a simplified
hull form using straight line sections for
many of these vessels which greatly re-
duced the time of construction.
6. An efficient form was developed
for a fast class of vessels designed by
the Maritime Commission.
7. Numerous other tests on ships
helping to win the war ranging from
high speed air-craft rescue boats to lake
freighters and river barges have been
carried along by the tank as part of the
University's contribution to the war ef-
fort.

BEFORE STAINLESS CETS ITS WINCS
REDUCE ACCIDENTS!
In 1941, accidents were first
cause of death among men from
22 to 38 years of age. The pro-
ductive man-days lost were
enough to build twice as many
battleships as now possessed
by the combined Allied Navies.
These are losses that can be
avoided. Don't take unneces-
sary risks at any time; and later,
when you enter business life,
remember that carelessness is
the single greatest factor in
human and economic loss.
A GREAT deal of costly process-
**■ ing is done on stainless steel, to
secure the physical characteristics
and surface finish required for the
particular war job it is to perform.
But one day all the rolling, heat
treating and surface finishing is
completed, and bright sheets of
Allegheny Metal lie ready for final
inspection and shipment to the
war plants.
They're right, those sheets—
flawless of surface and true to speci-
fications. They'll do their job and
more—which is what everything
and everybody must do, in a war
like this. In the case of stainless
steel, that job is the supplying of
vastly increased strength with equal
or decreased weight, and high re-
sistance to heat and corrosion.
These are qualities of great value
now, and of even greater promise
for the future.

When needed. Those that do not appear
promising naturally drop out of sight
as dead branches fall from a tree.
Related inventions, like human be-
ings, have family trees, but their pat-
terns need not have the uniformity re-
sulting from genealogical silviculture.
The inventor starts from a desired result
as the ground in which the tree is to
grow. The resulting growth may be a
single device, sometimes preceded by
the method of obtaining the desired re-
sult. If the device is further looked
upon as being the product of a machine,
variations are provided for the different
preferred inventions. Successive im-
provements of the different inventions
may increase the number of branches
indefinitely. To carry the comparison
further, the tree will often carry the
seeds from which a motley array of
mighty giants and scrubby dwarfs will
later grow.
The growth of the invention tree
often progresses regularly from the root
to the crown, but it is quite possible to
make it start from the top or even from
the middle. This may be an irrational
way to grow a tree, but after all this is
an age of wonders!

ion Jobs are Waiting
... for the Hardest Metal
Made by Man

i
Starting as a metal powder, Carboloy
Cemented Carbide if transformed,
under heat and pressure, into an end-
less variety of shapes and forms—tool
tips, dies and machine parts with the
super-hardness that is vital to high-
speed, low-cost industrial production.
STRAIGHT through industry, after the war,
there will be jobs that only the "hardest
metal made by man" can handle.
Why? Because the cry is for better, longer
lasting products and parts. Because closer toler-
ances will be combined with mass production.
And because industry knows that postwar
profits will depend largely on the cost at which
goods of top quality can be produced in top
volume.
Work No Other Known Metal Con Do
Urgent war production needs brought Carboloy
Cemented Carbide into its own. Its super-hard-
ness was needed in tools to machine super-tough
alloys — in dies to draw wire and tubing and
to form sheet metal.
Carboloy Cemented Carbide works at speeds
once thought impossibly high, to tolerances
never before practical in mass production—and
it commonly doubles or triples the output of
machines and men.
It is a matter of war record that the use of
this magic metal made possible production of
three times the number of aircraft engine crank-
cases and gears with the same equipment and
manpower. And this is only one of many
examples.
In peacetime production, it is certain that the
usefulness of Carboloy Cemented Carbide will
be greatly expanded, in widely varied fields—
not only for tools and dies but for "wearproof-
ing" parts that must stand up under modern
machine speeds and stresses.
A "Must" in Tomorrow's Competitive Race
The hardest metal made by man may well
write the price tags in tomorrow's "battle of
costs." You are invited to take full advantage
of Carboloy engineering, facilities and experi-
ence in planning products for tomorrow.

velocity of light, the mass mT would be
infinite. In this theory, mass becomes
interchangeable, with energy through
the relationships:
tides of negative electricity (called elec-
trons) which possess mass and therefore
inertia, which travel along paths that
are bent in the presence of either elec-
tric or magnetic fields ,and which travel
with velocities that many approach the
speed of light. Thomson's experiments
gave in addition the ratio of the electric
charge to the mass of the particles. In
1917, Millikan had completed the work
of measuring the charge of these parti-
cles so that it became possible to evalu-
ate the mass accurately.
Sir Ernest Rutherford (1899) began
a series of investigations of radioactive
elements which were known to disinte-
grate, and with the help of others
showed that the emanations are of three
kinds: o-particles, relatively slow moving
and positively charged, later shown to
be helium nuclei or aggregates of four
and two negative units; /?-particles
(electrons), swift moving and negative;
and y-rays, which were shown to be
energy emanations similar to X-rays,
but shorter in wave length, moving with
the speed of light. These emanations
proved to be the same no matter what
element served as their source. In the
face of this evidence it would be hard
to deny that all atoms are composed of
two elemental units, the positive charge
and the electron or negative charge,
bound together by forces resulting from
the energy of their contiguous positions
and motions.
Since the opening of the twentieth
century, physical research in both ex-
perimental and theoretical fields has
leaped forward at a pace so rapid that it
has been difficult to assimilate and cor-
ordinate the results as swiftly as they
have appeared. The number of workers
as well as organizations interested
in research has increased tremendously
in the last few years. Many of the
great industrial concerns have opened
departments of research and provided
sums of money for investigation so that
great promise may be held out for an
even more productive future.
Early in the century Planck found
that Maxwell's classical relations failed
to explain the experimental facts of ra-
diant energy. Hitherto it had been .is-
sumed that light of heat is propagated
through space in the form of continu-
ous waves. Planck's hypothesis, forming
the basis of the quantum theory, as-
sumed that radiant energy is emitted
from the originating source in "chunks"
or "quanta." The elementary quantum
is not a fixed amount of energy, but fol-
lows the rule that Planck's constant
(A) multiplied by the frequency of the
emitted wave gives the size of the unit.
Since frequency is the reciprocal of
time, h is of the order of energy-time or
action, a concept which has proved to
be of a more fundamental nature than
energy. Planck's constant h has been
shown to be equal to 6.55 X 10~27 erg-
second. Here then is the foundation for
the scientists' belief that action as well
as electricity and matter is atomic in
nature. But there are difficulties, for
even today the quantum idea has not
been able to explain the fact of the in-
terference of light, which is most ade-
quately satisfied by the old wave theory
arising from Maxwell's relations. Fur-
ther studies on specific heats at low
temperatures and on photoelectricity
are apparently consistent only with a
quantum hypothesis. We may expect
the quantum idea to remain even though
the details may be altered.
This century has been the age of
startling developments, for in 1904, Ein-
stein brought forward his special rela-
tivity theory, which proved to be very
upsetting because he asserted that the
ideas of space and time coming down
from Newton's day could not be entirely
true but could be at best only good ap-
proximations. He asserted that space
and time could not be absolute and in-
dependent but must be curiously inter-
mixed so that any physical event can be
described only in terms of the relative
constant motion of the observer. To an
observer standing upon the earth view-
ing a train moving relatively to him
with a constant velocity, lengths must
appear shortened and time move more
slowly than to a second observer placed
aboard the train. Velocities may not
be added directly, nor is mass a constant
quantity. A mass m„ as seen by an ob-
server traveling with it, appears larger
to another observer moving with a con-
stant relative velocity v, in this way

so that infinite energy would result from
a mass moving with the velocity of light.
This is of course a limiting case never
quite reached. Before this time, Kauf-
man and Bucherer experimented with
/?-electrons ejected by radioactive sub-
stances, which travel with a velocity of
about 98 per cent of that of light, and
found that their ratio of charge to mass
varied with the velocity. Strangely
enough, if the charge is assumed con-
stant, the variation in mass which they
found is that given above by Einstein.
Ten years later (1915) Einstein ex-
tended his ideas to cover accelerated
relative motion and developed the gen-
eral relativity theory, in which gravi-
tation appears as a consequence of the
distortion of space-time in the neigh-
borhood of material bodies. In the pe-
riod between Newton and Einstein,
gravitation had successfully defied every
attempt to correlate it with other nat-
ural phenomena. To an increasing ex-
tent throughout this century physicists
have been developing spectrum analysis
into the most powerful laboratory tool
yet discovered for prying into the mys-
tery of the constitution of the atom.
Side by side, checking each other at
every step, the speculations of the
mathematical physicist and the results
of laboratory investigation largely given
by spectral studies are forcing the
atomic riddle of today to become the
commonplace of tomorrow.
As the evidence increased, it was nat-
ural that attempts should be made to
construct an atom model which .vould
give a true and usable image of the
atom itself. In 1913 Rutherford and
Bohr proposed the planetary atom
model, in which electrons rotate in or-
bits about a nuclear sun. Unfortunately
the atom model, while easy to visualize,
fails to predict the correct spectral wave
lengths, and a wave-mechanical type of
atom has taken its place, at least where
accurate calculations of atomic magni-
tudes are required. The wave-mechan-
ical atom was developed originally by
De Broglie and Schroedinger in 1926.
Since then many workers have used
their methods so that present-day
knowledge concerning the electronic
shells of the atom is fairly complete.

G. I. REFLECTIONS
A college man's impressions of the Army, or, if Hargrove can do ir, so can I.
by
Probably every Army rookie who
has gone past the fourth grade has
attempted to write a book or article
on his experiences. Having not only
graduated fourth grade but gone on
to the fifth, I feel entitled to make
this literary endeavor.
When one begins to write an arti-
cle on life in the Army, a cursory
survey of the task makes it seem
indeed hopeless, for the subject en-
tails a whole new way of life, a mode
of living never before encountered.
Upon closer scrutiny, however, this
"way of life" is seen to be nothing
but a conglomeration of little things,
—customs and incidents which seem
superficially to be unworthy of men-
tion, but which prove to be the very
essence of Army life.
Probably the greatest single change
to which the novice in the Army
must accustom himself is the change
in his companions. Particularly is
this true of the former college stu-
dent. No longer does he associate
with a group of fellows who had been
fast equipping themselves to take
their places in business and indus-
try, but who are sadly lacking in
actual experience. He is now "thrown
in" not with the average American
college student, but rather with th?
average American, and he does not
immediately orient himself. At first,
he imagines himself in a world apart
from the rest, thinking different
thoughts, and expressing them in a
different language. Then he sudden-
PVT. ALAN PASCH, '46E
ly realizes that they are saying the
same things he would say, in the
same way he would say them. He
begins to distinguish one from an-
other, to see separate personalities
where before he saw just a mass of
faces. He strikes up acquaintance
with some of them—Bill, the Arkan-
sas farm boy; Ed, the salesman from
Detroit; Frank, the Shrevesport me-
chanic; Ralph, the "joik" from
Brooklyn. He sees that they are,
after all, the same as he, and his
first and biggest hurdle is over.
The next big change in the rookie's
life is one of routine and discipline.
He has, of course, an idea that when
a superior says something, he is not
just beating his gums for the sheer
joy of it. This stems from the days
(seemingly years ago) when he was
arguing with his draft board about
what should be written in the upper
right-hand corner of that little white
card they gave him. He now be-
comes of the opinion, however, that
non-coms are supermen with a sadis-
tic streak in them, instilled with
what in the Army amounts almost to
Herculean powers; and until he
learns the fine art of goldbricking
(which, let me assure you, is fore-
most among military maneuvers) he
continues to think so.
From his first morning in the re-
ception center, when, at the hereto-
fore unheard-of hour of 5:00 A.M.,
the first sergeant's voice comes bel-
lowing over the P.A., "Awright, you
lazy ****, get the &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; out of those
#### beds!" the new soldier is
aware of a system known as routine.
When he marches to chow, to work
(before beginning training he is put
to work on work details), to chow,
back to work, to chow, to mail-call,
and then drills until dark, he is more
aware of this routine than ever. He
thinks they'd march him to the la-
trine, if feasible. Upon settling down
to the daily routine of basic training,
however, he becomes accustomed to
it, percieves the benefits his mind and
body derive from it—and resolves to
lead a more dissipated life than ever
upon return to civilian life.
The serviceman has been eulogized
countless thousands of times in the
course of war. Every civilian in
America has had enumerated to him
time and time again the many sacri-
fices of this war's G.I. Joe. Yet I
doubt if anyone realizes—certainly I
didn't, as a civilian—just what it
does mean to a fellow to enter the
service. Take it from one who hasn't
even been out of the country—it is a
heck of a big sacrifice. Civilians have
also been told by everyone of any
prominence from Orphan Annie to
John's Other Wife that mail means a
lot to a serviceman, that it brings
home a little bit closer. They're right.
If every civilian could see a mail-
call, whether in the United States or
in "Jebru," he would not have to be
reminded again.

copperplating feet
stops athlete's foot
Leathernecks and sailors are getting
copperplated feet to stop athlete's foot,
Sergeant Alvin M. Josephy, Jr., a Ma-
rine Corps Combat Correspondent in the
South Pacific, reports. The patient
places his feet in a copper sulfate solu-
tion containing an ordinary copper plate.
Copper bands, soaked in salt water for
good contact, are fastened around the
ankles and connected to six-volt storage
batteries. Treatment takes about six
minutes and is repeated for six or seven
days. Although copper particles tem-
porarily adhere to the patients feet,
there is neither discomfort nor discolora-
tion.
quick three dimensional
drawings
A new machine, called the axono-
graph, makes three-dimensional draw-
ings photographically from two dimen-
sional drawings in less than half the
time it would take a draftsman to do the
job. A three-dimensional drawing is
much easier to work with than a two
dimensional one on assembly line work.
The actual making of the three-dimen-
sional prints is mechanical. The original
drawing is placed on a board in front of
a camera. By adjusting the drawing, it
is possible to produce a photograph in
any one of three planes, plan, face, or
side. The photographs are then returned
to the drafting room where draftsmen
place the prints in their proper position
and make the finished drawing. A sim-
ple illustration is the use of a square.
By placing it in the new machine, and
moving the copy board into three differ-
ent positions, it is possible to make
photographs, which when put together
produce a cube, of which the original
square is one side.
why ships crack up
An investigation of 2,993 Liberty
ships shows that no lives have been lost
as a result of structural failures, except
in the case of the John P. Gaines, from
which ten persons were missing after
successfully embarking in a lifeboat.
Out of the group of ships studied, 20
suffered complete fractures of the
strength deck, and of these, five have
completely broken in two. Two of these
fractures occurred before the vessels
were put in service. Cracking in ships
afloat has been largely due to low, near
freezing, temperatures, or heavy seas.
An analysis shows that nearly all frac-
tures have been due to imperfect weld-
ing. Effective measures have been taken
to reduce fractures while the ship is still
being built.

American gunners to aim directly into

and does so with the same filament wat-
tage. The brilliancy of the gunsight

WAR'S emphasis is on strength,
in men and in steel. That
truism is pictured for you above, in
a scene showing the last admixture
of alloys going into an electric
furnace in one of the Allegheny
Ludlum mills.
In the shortest possible time after
the arc is struck, that batch of alloy
steel will be war material in use.
It may be stainless bomb racks or
ammunition chutes; tool steels fash-
ioning a tank; valves or nitrided
shafts in engines; electrical steels
in gun, engine or plane controls—
or in radio range-finding and com-
munications equipment. Whatever
it is, Hitler definitely won't like it.
Nor will Tojo, and the reasons why
are inherent in the steels them-
selves.
Special alloy steels are the "Su-
permen" of metals. Whatever job
there is for steel to do, they do
better. Many jobs they do today,
in fact, weren't even possible until
a special steel was developed for
the purpose—the records of our
Research Laboratories are full of
such instances.
It has been said, and truly so far
as combat equipment is concerned,
that this is an "Alloy War." Much
has been learned that you will carry
forward as the commercial tech-
nicians of the future.

portable power plants
Portable electric power stations, now
being used by the United Nation"s
armies to provide electrical power in
shattered war conquered cities taken by
the allies, will be of great service in time
of peace. The units are highly portable
and make it possible to set up a gener-
ating unit at any point accessible by
railroad.
One unit is capable of producing 1,-
000 kilowatts or approximately enough
electricity to serve 2,000 people. Each
unit consists of 3 cars which are com-
plete with boilers, turbines, and gener-
ators. They also carry their own boiler
feed and cooling waters making them
independent of the services of rivers or
harbors on which the usual power sta-
tion is dependent. The portable sta-
tion is ready to begin generating elec-
tricity a few hours after it is located,
and it will operate equally well in hot
or cold climates on any fuel available in
fhe vicinity.
Uses for these rolling power plants
after the war would involve such tasks
as supplying remote construction jobs,
and opening new town sites. A more
spectacular use will be to provide much
needed power in distaster areas where
storms, floods, or earthquakes have dis-
rupted facilities.

Faxfilm is a new method of surface in-
spection and comparison. By the use of
a solvent, one surface of a plastic film is
softened enough to permit the making
of a contact replica of any surface. This

board frame which fits any standard pro-
jector where it can be enlarged 100
diameters or more, and shows all con-
tours in three dimensions. The film can
be filed for future record, if desired.

these flaws before they may be the cause
of catastrophe. On a small flat car are
three 100-pound blades. After sliding
three films under each blade the operator
presses a control button. An electronic
device opens the door to a lead-lined

the X-ray picture is taken. The car
then moves out on an oval track, and
another car enters the room. Inspection

ROBERT LAWRENCE HESS, "45E
There are many machines that need
brakes of various types in order that
they may be slowed or stopped at the
operator's will. To meet this demand,
several types of braking systems have
been developed, the most common of
which are those classed as frictional. To
present a full picture of these systems it
is necessary to explain how the brakes
function and to explain how they re-
ceive their power.
One of the most common of the fric-
tional brakes is the block brake. This
[.brake, with its modifications, is found
| on machinery from farmers' wagons to
[the heaviest of trains. The mechanics of
I the block brake are perhaps the simplest
of any type of frictional brake. Refer-
ring to Fig. 1, we shall see just how this
brake operates. A is a wheel or drum
whose revolution about axle B in bear-
ing C it is desired to slow or stop. A
lever D with its fulcrum at E is supplied
with a frictional block F. Power is ap-
plied at G in the direction indicated.
I The design of the block is such that be-
Isides that frictional action there is also

Fig. 1
definite cutting action. This brake is
|&gt;f necessity then used only upon metal
lims and drums. Lubricants may be
feed upon the surface but in most
ises are not. The type of block brake
Ihnwn will operate well enough for light
Bads: however, when heavy pressures
Bust be applied it has its disadvan-
tages. The chief of these is that an un-
itural amount of wear will occur in
Journal as indicated by the arrow.
Besides this, there will be great alter-
nate stresses upon the axle when the
brake is being applied. Larger types of
block brakes eliminate these difficulties
by mounting opposing blocks on oppo-
site sides of the drum and connecting
them with equalizing levers. Now, as
shown in Figure 2, the forces are equal
and in opposite directions, and there is
no added wear in the journal nor any
tendency to bend the shaft.
Another frictional braking system just
as important as the block system is the
band system. As the name indicates and
as shown in Figure 3, this system makes

Fig. 2
use of a band which contracts about a
drum attached to the load which it is
desired to stop. Various alterations may
be made in the design of lever A,
thereby changing the method in which
band C is contracted about drum B.
This band may be of steel, bearing upon
the drum directly or, as in most cases,
it may be lined with a special heat and
friction-resisting leather. The chief dif-
ficulty found in this type brake is that
foreign objects may become lodged be-
tween the band and the drum. To elimi-
nate this difficulty, the band system has
been altered in many instances, notably
on automobiles, so that the band, in-
stead of contracting around the out-
side of the drum, now expands on the
inside of the drum. The band now
must be of rigid material and must be
in sections as illustrated in Figure 4.
Since this system fits entirely within the
brake drum, it becomes a simple matter
to enclose it in a dirt-proof case. As in
the case of the contracting bands, these
shoes are also lined with leather.

Fig. 3
Another system of braking is referred
to as axial. Of the axial brakes, there
are two general types; the cone and the
disc. The name itself indicates that in
this type of braking system the braking
load is applied at the axle of revolution.
It is therefore plain that the mechanical
advantage of the machine over the brake
is much greater in the axial braking sys-
tem than in either of the types taken up
previously. As a result, this type of
brake will require more energy to do the
same amount of work. However, it is
found that this brake is very popular.
All modifications of the cone brake use
the same system of gaining friction. A
conical piece, usually bronze, fixed rig-
idly, is pressed forward into an empty
conical piece of harder material which
is fast to the axle of revolution. The
cone may be either smooth or rough. In
either case it gives the desired friction.
The disc type brake finds wide use in
clutches of various sorts. The brake is
composed of discs fit about the axle of
revolution. Every other disc has two or
three lips in the center which fit into a

NATURAL rubber is the unchal-
lenged choice when a rubber high
in tensile strength, stretchability, speed
of comeback and resilience, and low in
permanent set, is desired. However, for
good aging, resistance to abrasion, sun-
light, action of oils, fats, and solvents,
coronal discharge and diffusion of gases,
synthetic rubbers have wrested the
crown from natural rubber. Improve-
ments in synthetic rubbers are being
rapidly made, and their all over proper-
ties may, in time, surpass those of nat-
ural rubber compounds. There is much
question as to how permanently syn-
thetic rubbers have usurped or en-
croached upon natural rubber applica-
tions during this wartime absence of a
natural stock. The exploitation of syn-
thetic rubbers is too recent for one to
hazard predictions about the extent of
post-war competition. One must consider
that natural rubber, cheap and avail-
able under normal conditions, is estab-
lished as an industrial material, and
that research is constantly perfecting its
compounds. A synthetic rubber can be
considered either as a direct substitute
for a natural in specific compounds, or
the mobile characteristics of the syn-
thetic exploited to full advantage. These
interpretations of the synthetics are re-
flected in the dual trends of research,
the latter trend being prevalent in the
United States.
Familiarity with the history, devel-
opment, and methods of synthesis is
essential to an understanding of the
status of the field. In accordance with
accepted terminology, references to
"butadiene" designate 1, 3 butadiene,
CH,=CH—CH=CH,. It is difficult to
determine where the butadiene rubbers
end and distinctly different compounds
begin, and to distinguish the synthetic
rubbers from other products nearer the
plastic end of the plastic elastic scale.
The "synthetic rubber" in this article is
a product which has physical properties
similar to those of natural rubber, and,
when released from a 300% + elonga-
tion, will return quickly to its original
dimensions.
In the early 19th century, rubber
first became industrially significant. On
destructive distillation, then current as
a method of studying a natural organic
material, rubber yielded an oil. The
analysis of this oil was undertaken
without results by some of the most
famous chemists of the period, includ-
ing Dumas, Leibig, Dalton and Gregory.
Not until 1860, did Grenville Williams
isolate C3Hg with a density of 0.6823
(20° C) and a boiling point of 37.6°C.
Williams named his discovery "iso-
CH3H
prene," CH2=C—C=CH2
A few years later, G. Bouchardet
found that isoprene, heated with a large
excess of fuming hydrochloric acid,
yielded a rubbery compound. Almost
simultaneously, Tilden made the first
truly synthetic rubber by the pyrolysis
of turpentine and polymerization (link-
ing together of molecules) of the re-
sulting isoprene.
The development of a good, eco-
nomically feasible synthetic rubber was
slow, because ample and reasonably
priced natural rubber was available.
Rather than foreseeing the need to ex-

investigators limited their costly at-
tempts to duplicating them. The search
ironically parallels the alchemists' at-
tempts to duplicate gold from baser
metals. When the search for products
chemically similar to natural rubber
was largely abandoned, progress was
made in the production of useful syn-
thetic rubbers.
About 1910 the demand for automo-
bile tires was great and, therefore, the
price of raw rubber went up to $3 per
pound. This economic stimulus greatly
hastened the development of synthetic
rubbers, particularly in Russia and Ger-
many. In this period Kordakoff, a Rus-
sian, discovered a method of producing
butadiene. Most of the work was done
with 1, 2-butadiene, CH1,=C=CH—
CH:! and the results were quite disap-
pointing from the standpoint of tensile
strength and milling properties.
World War I served as a catalyst to
the German synthetic rubber industry.
Several thousand tons of methyl rubber
were produced commercially. After the
war, however, it could not compete with
natural rubber either on an economic
basis or in its physical properties. It
was, as Hofman says, a "hothouse
plant.'' In the 1914-18 period, the
United States supply of natural rubber
was never gravely threatened, so our
activity in the field of synthetic rubber
was not noteworthy.
With the development of intense na-
tionalism and the desire for economic
self-sufficiency in the 1930's, those
countries having no source of raw ma-
terials renewed their search with vigor.
In 1940, I. G. Farbenindustrie, the Ger-
man chemical trust, held considerably
more patents on processes, catalysts,
etc., for the manufacture of butadiene
rubber than all the industries of the
rest of the world combined.
In 1942, it was announced that the
Standard Oil Company of New Jersey
owns the American rights to the Buna
synthetic rubber developed by the Ger-
man trust.
Russia, Japan, and especially Ger-
many, had as their goal a rubber which
duplicated the natural materials in
properties and cost. Up until Pearl
Harbor, the trend in the United States
was toward the production of a rubber
superior in some respects, with cost as a
secondary consideration.
In Table II appears a group of syn-
thetic rubbers available in 1941. The
list is far from comprehensive since
there are countless satisfactory varieties
of synthetics for specific applications.
Good synthetic rubbers can be made
by interpolymerizing such compounds as
isoprene and butadiene with other com-
pounds containing active vinyl groups,
CH„=CH—, i.e., vinylidene chloride,
methyl vinyl ketone, methyl methacry-
late, other vinyl substituted hydrocar-
bons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, ethers,
esters, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, ni-
trites, etc.
Another group which may be quite
productive includes interpolymers of
butadiene or some other diene with an
olefin, i.e., isobutylene. Butadienes may
also be interpolymerized with dienes
such as chloroprenes. Furthermore, there
are many three-way interpolymers which
have definite possibilities. Obviously
the range of possible products is vast.
All types of synthetic rubber made on
a laboratory or commercial scale have
some things in common. They consist
of very long chains—sometimes re-
ferred to as grant molecules—built up by
the repetition of some unit form. There
may be thousands of these units in a
single chain. In Table I appears a few
varieties of synthetic rubber with the
monomer and the unit of polymer from
which the final product is constructed.
The long chains of most of these syn-
thetics are built up by the polymeriza-
tion of molecules of liquid. Organic
polysulfides, on the other hand, consist
of chains formed by condensation. The
terminal group of these chains has never
been identified.
The production of synthetic rubber
may be divided into (1) manufacture of
the monomer (a single link in the chain)
and (2) the polymerization or condensa-
tion reaction. This second reaction gen-
erally takes place in the presence of a
catalyst. Buna, a German synthetic, de-
rived its name from "Bu" for butadiene
and "na'' for natrium, the German name
for sodium which was the first catalyst
used.

Shell Oil Company to copolymerize with
butadiene for water-proof fabrics. In
1942, no economical process for isoprene
had been evolved. All plants were built
for the production of a synthetic differ-
ing chemically from natural rubber. A
number of these rubbers are prepared
from two separate starting materials
which polymerize in a single operation,
to form mixed or copolymers. Butadiene
is generally a starting material. The
product of butadiene and styrene
(C0H,-CH=CH,,), is Buna S, the
most widely utilized synthetic. Butyl
rubber, low in butadiene and high in
olefin, was studied by the Standard Oil
Development Company in 1942. Tire-
tread compounds made with this product
are initially more resistant to dynamic
flexure, losing little of this resistance
after long aging, whereas natural rub-
ber tread fails rapidly under similar
conditions.
The copolymers of butadiene and
the polymers of chloroprene are usually
prepared catalytically in the form of an
emulsion in water. The final product, an
artificial latex, is used for impregnating
fabric. A solid material may be ob-
tained by coagulation of the latex with
a weak acid.
The chloroprene for neoprene rubber
is prepared by forming a dimer of acet-
ylene, namely, vinylacetylene (CH2=
CH—C = CH) and the addition of hy-
drochloric acid. A rearrangement takes
place giving chloroprene, CH.,=CC1—
CH=CH... The chloroprene is poly-
merized as an emulsion, and the artifi-
cial latex obtained coagulated to form
neoprene. Several types of neoprene are
on the market.
Polyvinyl chloride, a white powder
with no resemblance to rubber, when
properly plasticized gives Koroseal, a
rubber-like product with many inter-
esting properties.
In Table I, the recurrence of the
vinyl radical CH.,=CH— in the com-
pounds is evident. The structure of the
synthetic unit is unsymmetrical rather
than symmetrical as indicated.
Virtually all European synthetic rub-
ber is manufactured from butadiene,
prepared by the polymerization of acety-
lene and catalytic hydrogenation. The
process is quite free of side reactions,
yielding a butadiene of high purity. In
Germany, the energy requirement is sup-
plied by electricity, representing a large
item in the cost, especially for the poly-
merization. A second process, reputedly

ters Patent are public documents open
to everyone for inspection. Anyone in-
terested in starting to manufacture a
new article is therefore able to consult
them, as he should, to see if the article
is patented or whether it may be manu-
factured freely.
Frequently a manufacturer starts
making articles that are already on the
market, for the simple reason that it is
easier for man to copy than to create;
and it is unjustly that we taunt our four-
handed cousins with the time-honored
aphorism, "Monkey see, monkey do."
If an article is sold without showing any
indication that it is patented, a manu-
facturer desiring to copy it will be sorely
tempted to assume, without investiga-
tion, that it is not patented, and it may
be made and distributed without restric-
tion. With some 750,000 patents now
outstanding, a patent infringement
search is often a formidable task and
one not to be undertaken lightly.
patented articles
should be so marked
As early as 1842 Congress decided
that, human nature being what it is, it
should be permissible to copy unmarked
articles without investigation, and
passed the first statute requiring articles
made under patent protection to be so
marked. Under this statute and its
amendments, every article patented in
this country and made or sold in this
country should be marked with the word
'"patent" and the number of the patent
so as to "give sufficient notice to the
public that the same is patented." (The
date of the patent may be substituted
for its number if the patent issued be-
fore April 1, 1927.) The marking may
be applied to the package containing one
or more articles if the article itself is of
such character that it cannot be marked.
In former years the penalty for failing
to apply the proper patent marking used
to be a fine. At present, however, the
patentee neglecting properly to mark his
patented articles is merely prevented
from recovering damages caused to him
by infringment of his patent, unless the
infringer continues his invasion of the

patentee's rights after being duly noti-
fied of his infringement.
Conversely, it is a criminal offense
punishable by a fine to mark an un-
patented article as being patented, but
only if this is done "for the purpose of
deceiving the public." Thus, when there
is no intent to deceive, placing a patent
marking on an unpatented article is con-
doned, a fortunate circumstance for
manufacturers who have to keep straight
the markings of different kinds of pat-
ented and unpatented articles.
Even articles on which the patent has
expired may, with impunity, bear a
patent marking if it appears that this
was not done to deceive the public. In
1876, sewing machines of a popular
make were marked with the dates of
several patents, including the one shown
in Fig. 1, which had all expired at that
time. Apparently this marking had been
initiated during the life of the patents
and carried through their expiration, and
it was held in 1882 that no intention was
apparent to represent the machines as
still being patented.
Patent marking is required on articles
made under design patents as well as
mechanical patents, but should not be
confused with copyright marking. Lack
of patent marking does not render a pat-
ent invalid, while lack of copyright
marking precludes the securing of copy-
right protection.
articles should be
marked plainly
The language of thejnarking statute
is simple enough; but, as with all laws,
the bewildering variety of unforeseen
circumstances under which it was ap-
plied caused the courts to investigate its
requirements in many litigations in
which it was invoked. For example,
since the purpose of patent marking is
to give notice to the public, it would
seem clear that the articles should be
marked plainly.
This was evidently overlooked by a
manufacturer of a patented looseleaf
binder having a metal plate slipped into
the thickness of a leather back, as shown

was marked on the binder in characters
so small as to be readable only with the
aid of a magnifying glass, for the reason
that larger characters would have de-
faced the binders. The law, however, is
not concerned with defacing patented
articles, and in 1931 a court found the
marking on the binders to be deficient.
mark article itself
That the patented article itself must
be marked whenever feasible also needed
to be emphasized by a judicial condem-
nation of relevant examples. One such
was a cherry stoner of the type shown
in Fig. 3, which was sold with a tag at-
tached to it bearing the marking, a prac-
tice condemned in court in 1913. An-
other was the patented wooden dish
shown in Fig. 4. The dishes were packed
in crates which bore the patent marking.
In 1893 this marking was held improper
because the dishes were susceptible to
marking. Xo weight was given to the
pretty transparent excuse, and an after-
thought to boot, that individually mark-
ed dishes would be so expensive as to be
uncompetitive.
marking packages
sometimes permissible
Whether or not it is feasible to mark
the article itself instead of its packages
is not always beyond question. The
Supreme Court itself felt bound to recog-
nize that, in doubtful cases, something
must be left to the judgment of the pat-
entee although it would be unwise to
assume too much latitude in that re-
spect. It is true that in 1892 this Court
held small trunk catches of the type
shown in Fig. 6 adequately marked by
affixing a patent marking label to the
package in which the catches were
shipped and sold. But that was a long
time ago, and the Court may well re-
verse itself some day, as it sometimes
does, in view of the present state of per-
fection of marking devices.
In the meanwhile, it was held in 1932
that the popular razor shown in Fig. 5
was properly marked by marking its
package. It is difficult to see why mark-
ing the razor itself should have been
fraught with insurmountable obstacles,
especially as the Court remarked that
nothing requires every element of a
patented combination to be marked sep-
arately.
It should be clear from the statute
that no patent marking is adequate if it
is not applied to the patented article or
to its container. As late as 1909, how-
ever, the owner of a design patent on the
hat band shown in Fig. 7 had to find
that out the hard way. The patented
bands were applied to ladies' sailor
hats in whatever eccentric manner was
then dictated by fashion, and the patent
marking was carried on the lining of the
hat. This marking was held improper.
While it would have been unreasonable
to require that the hats be worn showing
the word "patented" in large letters on
the band, there were other proper ways
of applying the marking.
multiple patent marking
It often happens, especially in the case
of complicated machinery, that a manu-
facturer owns several patents covering
different features of a particular article.
To comply with the spirit of the statute,
the marking should include the number
of every patent having a claim reading
on the article. Besides, this is necessary
to enable the patentee to recover all
damages he suffers by infringement of
any of the patents.
When it is doubtful whether several
patents all apply to a particular article,
everything is to be gained by listing
them all. For this purpose, and also for
simplifying the procedure of marking a
wide variety of articles, many manufac-
turers use blanket patent plates, such as
the plate shown in Fig. 8, to be fastened
to all articles coming under any of the
patents listed.

Fig. 2 C. D. Trussel's binder, patented in 1912, was improperly marked with the
number in microscopic characters.
marking patent pending
The much abused Pat. Pendng. which
is not the name of an Irish inventor, is
often used as a bugaboo to frighten pros-
pective imitators of unpatented articles
but is of doubtful standing. The equiva-
lent marking "Patent applied for" on
the inkstand shown in Fig. 9 was dis-
posed of in court in 1915 with the re-
mark that it was not in strict accordance
with the language of the statute. On the
other hand, another court he'.d more re-
cently that loose-leaf books on which a
patent application was pending should
have been so marked. Such conclusion
was probably unreasonable, but until
the Supreme Court so decides it will be
safer to mark articles on which a patent
is pending.
every one of patented
articles must be marked
One requirement which some pat-
entees have failed to observe is that a
definite attempt must be made to mark
every one of the patented articles, no
matter how few or how numerous they
may be. Accidental failure to mark a
few articles out of hundreds of thou-
sands may be excused. But the exclu-
sive licensee of the patent on a machine
for making finned radiator tubing was
found to have shirked his duty for hav-
ing, in a room barred to the public, three
unmarked machines located next to two
machines that were properly marked.
Also, any party bringing suit against
an infringer is held responsible for see-
ing that patented articles made by his
licensees be marked as if he had manu-
factured them himself. This require-
ment probably came as a surprise to the
owners of the patent on the once popular
radio receiver circuit shown in Fig. 10.
who were denied recovery in 1937 be-
cause their licensees had marked only
two-thirds of the radio sets made under
the patent.
Regardless of circumstances, and al-
though there is no immediate or degrad-
ing penalty for failing to mark a pat-
ented article, the cost of marking it must
be considered as a good investment if
recovery for patent infringement is im-
portant. Although the value of marking
may not be apparent at the time and
the inclination may be to apply it cas-
ually, the headaches of negligent pat-
entees are evidence that patent markins
is often one of those little things that
count, and should be done well.

FLECTS
Here it is December and time to
knock out another page of stuff that
will undoubtedly sound corny on the
second reading, if you read it over the
way you do your Econ. or History as-
signments, and on the first if you devote
any time to it at all. It is at times like
these when one attempts to be funny
when he does not feel that way, that
cynicism is born. The following gem
is the result.
A college mag is a great invention.
The college gets all the fame,
The printer gets all the money,
And the staff gets all the blame.
Going now from cynical to the ob-
serving mood, we perceive some items
of interest in the Reflects basket and
proceed to go to work on this month's
column.
It's often said that birds and animals
are possessed with a special "sixth
sense" not available to man. Many ani-
mals instinctively hibernate in the win-
ter; most birds fly to regions where con-
ditions are most suitable to their
character and physical well being. Thus
it is small wonder that more than one
representative of the wisest group of
bird life, the owl, has made his home
in that part of the campus where the
environment is most appropriate to his
renowned mental superiority. I am, of
course, referring to the West Engineer-
ing Building.
Owls, however, are not the only new-
comers to Engine School. And though
they represent a small minority numer-
ically, they have always and will con-
tinue to get mention out of proportion
to their numbers on this page. No, Am-
brose, I don't mean the owls: I mean
w-o-m-e-n (women). Ah, yes!!
All of which is my way of leading
up to my passing on a report which has
been reaching the ears of Ye Olde Tech-
nic Staffe.
It seems that a female freshman was
promised a blind date with that pillar
of strength, that man with the ringing
voice, Burton Tower. She was to meet
"him," the matchmakers informed her,
right outside the Michigan League at
8 P.M. The fatal hour came, and went,
and with it our heroine's sad realiza-
tion that she had been stood up. Un-
able to face her friends with her dilem-
ma, she dug deep into her pocketbook
and sent herself a dozen roses, and faked
a note of apology.
Now that our fair lady has discovered
that Burton Tower was at the ap-
pointed place, that he, or it, had been
there long before she arrived and, in
fact, he, or it, is still there, she can
draw solace from the fact that each time
the carillon chimes she can proudly say,
"At least, I haven't the type of face
that would stop a clock!"

Some people believe that dreams are
glimpses into the future; others claim
that they are merely your subconscious
breaking into your conscious thoughts.
Be that as it may, I had a dream the
other night. And, what is more, the
dream was quite appropriate for the
Christmas season. I dreamt that, like
Scrooge, I was visited by the "Spirit
of Christmas Future." The spectre,
without uttering a single syllable, en-
folded me in his immense shroud and
whisked me away into the night. When
I had at last regained my composure
and perhaps some of my arrogance, I
made so bold as to inquire the phan-
tom's business with me. "You," the
spectre answered, "have been privileged
to be granted permission to see this
Christmas Eve in whichsoever place
that you may desire." I took prompt
command of the situation. "We are off
to the P-Bell!" I cried.
'Twas the night before Christmas
and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring; not even
a souse.
The sliderules were hung on the bar
stools with care; there wasn't one
pantywaist Lit student there.
Some of the boys had had one too
many; the wide range of emotions was
truly uncanny.
And I in my slippers and the ghost
in his shroud were just getting set to
do ourselves proud.
When out on the street there arose
such a clatter, we all sprang from our
chairs to see what was the matter!
An what to our wondering eyes
should appear—but a minature sleigh
(NOT effects of the Beer!)
With a little old driver so lively and
quick; if I'd been at the Union I'd
have sworn it was Pick!
More rapid than eagles, his reindeer
they came; each would sing out a tune
when he shouted its name.
First "Varsity," then "Victors," then
"Hail to the Colors"; the reindeer just
sang as he handed out crullers.
And the venison in unison were in
chorus yet, as Santa sat down and lit
his cigarette.
He smiled and he winked and he
patted his belly; and it shook as he
laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.
He smiled again and went straight
to his work; pulling out a slide rule.
he turned with a jerk.
"This says you all rate your bourbon
and rye, and everyone knows that log-
logs don't lie!"
And as he jumped on his sleigh he
yelled, "Hey, engineer! Merry Christ-
mas to you and a Happy New Year!"

operations officer
As Operations Officer at the Head-
quarters of the Commandant of the
I". S. Army, Captain Erik Lewis Swyler
seems to be well suited to his job, ac-
cording to all reports. His stern bearing
and clipped speech give him an air that
is very military and perfectly in keeping
with his position. With these qualities
at hand, Captain Swyler has ably ful-
filled his duty of preparing the training
schedule for the various Army units on
campus and instructing classes in Mili-
tary Science and Tactics in the ASTP
groups and the ROTC.
Although Captain Swyler hails from
New Jersey, he attended Penn State,
from which college he graduated with an
A.B. in English. Until the outbreak of
the war, Captain Swyler was an instruc-
tor in the English Department at Mid-
dlebury College in Vermont. Here, in-
terestingly enough, he taught English
Drama. However, since the Military
was a sort of hobby with him, he held a
reserve commission in the Army. In
October, 1940, he went into active duty
and was stationed at Fort Dix, N. J.
In January, 1942, he was transferred to
the Infantry School at Ft. Benning, Ga.
Following this, he went to Ft. McClel-
lan, Ala., from which he came directly
to Michigan, on October S, 1942, to take
his post here at Army Headquarters.
Captain Swyler came to Michigan as a
First Lieutenant, but received his cap-
taincy a few months after he had been
here.
At home, Captain Swyler has a very
charming wife and a three-and-a-half
year old son, Karl Joseph. "Joe," as
they call him, has a favorite pastime—
playing with soldiers.
On the whole, Captain Swyler likes
Michigan very much, and says he has
found the people very cooperative, hav-
ing received nothing but cooperation
from them in everything he has tried to
do. Partly because of this, and partly
because he enjoys his work so, he has
found this a very peaceful duty com-
pared with some of the others he has
had.

Captain Eric L. Swyler
As yet, Captain Swyler has made no
definite plans for his future, which is
well taken care of for the ''duration,
plus." However, he likes teaching, and
it is possible that he will teach after the
war.

metrogon lens
Along with the development of the
airplane in the present world conflict
came the development of the aerial pho-
tographic lens. In the field of aerial
photography, there are two main types
of cameras. One of these is just a high
quality motion picture camera. This
type is placed so that it will record the
path of the machine gun bullets, en-
abling the gunner to bring back pictures
of each burst. However, the lens with
which we are concerned in this article
is used to take pictures of the earth
from the air.

Courtrsy Bausch and Lomb
The optical elements of a metrogon lens.
All lenses of this type must have cer-
tain characteristics. All alike must have
superb correction for flatness of field,
distortion, and chromatic aberration.
Chromatic aberration is caused by the
different index of refraction for each
color or wave length in a ray of light.
Achromatic lenses are so designed as to
bring the different wave lengths to one
focal point, thereby obtaining a very
clear picture.
Among these lenses is one of excep-
tional performance and design, known as
the Metrogon (see cut). It is a new lens
developed by the Bausch &amp; Lomb Opti-
cal Company for use in mapping and
reconnaissance. This lens accomplishes
almost the impossible. It is really four
lenses, two of which are paper thin at
the center and two of which are paper
thin at the edge. The lenses must be
ground super-fine and must be correctly
placed on a mount. This job alone
must be so exact that it requires all the
ability of an expert mounter.
The Metrogon is so free from distor-
tion that equal areas on the negative
can be considered to represent equal
areas on the ground. The clarity of pic-
tures taken through this lens is amaz-
ing. Enlargements of these pictures
show the minutest details, even go-
ing so far as to record individual rail-
road ties at a distance of 35,000 to 40,-
000 feet away. Using the same type of
lens, with a six-inch focus, you could
take a picture covering a square plate
9x9 inches.
As an aerial lens the Metrogon must
not be effected by drops in temperature,
anywhere from 150° to 200° F. in the
span of a few seconds. It must also be
able to withstand shocks and vibrations,
of which it will receive many.
Today, lenses of this type are being
produced only for the armed forces.
However, in the near future, when the
present conflict is over, they will be
placed on the open market. So keep
your eyes peeled, photographers!
hellcat
Since the introduction of the tank into
warfare in the first World War, bigger
and better tanks and anti-tank weapons
have been invented. By now we are all
familiar with the "Generar' series of
tanks and the "Bazooka." Recently
the production of two new armored ve-
hicles was announced. The "Hellcat," a
new tank destroyer, has been in secret
production in Buick's automobile fac-
tories for more than a year, while the
"Staghound," a new high-speed armored
car, has been a closely guarded secret
since early in 1941.
The "Hellcat," or M-18, is a 76 mm.
gun-carrying tank destroyer of lightning
like maneuverability, SS-mile-an-hour
speed, and destructive firepower. Its
high velocity cannon, mounted in a
heavily armored rotating turret, can
knock out enemy tanks and pillboxes
at several thousand yards and has an
effective artillery range of more than
seven miles. Despite its heavy armor,
the M-18 is the most elusive target in
modern tank warfare by virtue of its
high speed and unusual maneuverabil-
ity.
Power is supplied by a 485 horsepower
radial aircraft engine which is mounted
in the tank destroyer on tracks so that it
may readily be removed for replace-
ment or overhaul. A similar track ar-
rangement has been designed for the
final drive and transmission to provide
maximum accessibility for servicing.
The vehicle is equipped with a torqu-
matic transmission, the most recent step
in heavy duty transmission development,
which provides considerably greater
mobility.

The M-18 "Hellcat" in seven feet of water
The driving controls are very simple
and dual controls are provided for the
driver and co-driver who are completely
shielded under armor plate and rely for
vision in action upon two periscopes
mounted at eye height.
Weighing approximately 19 tons,
with welded armor plate hull and 360
degree revolving turret mounting its 76
mm. cannon, the tank destroyer is cap-
able of speeds of 55 miles per hour on
level terrain and corresponding perform-
ance in rougher going where its ability to
negotiate barriers, trenches, deep water,
mud, and mountainous, heavily wooded
ground is claimed by Army Ordnance
and Buick engineers to exceed that of
any motorized artillery yet developed.
staghound
Unique among wheeled weapons in
this war, the Chevrolet-built "Stag-
hound" armored car combines the fea-
tures of a tank and a reconnaissance car,
and performs acceptably over a variety
of terrains. Weighing 14 tons, it carries
a five man crew at speeds exceptionally
high for an armored combat unit. The
vehicle has on over-all length of 17i/&gt;
feet, and is protected by heavy frontal
armor plate and armor on the sides and
rear. It mounts in its turret a cannon in
combination with a machine gun. The
latter weapon, using tracer bullets, is
used to find the exact range for the can-
non, thus conserving cannon ammuni-
tion. In addition, another machine gun
is mounted in the bow. Other weapons
carried are a submachine gun, hand
grenades, and a smoke mortar for the
laying of smoke screens.
These cars, powered by Chevrolet
built engines, have a top speed com-
parable to that of a passenger car and a
cruising range of hundreds of miles.
They are four wheel drive vehicles,
equipped with tires nearly four feet high,
which are said to be unusually shell and
bullet resistant. Each car is equipped
with radio and all crew members can
converse through an intercommunication
phone system. Periscopes can be used to
direct the driver and sight the guns
when the vehicle is in action with all
hatches and ports sealed.
Both of these vehicles have been most
useful and effective weapons in spear-
heading the recent United Nations ad-
vances in the European theater of war.
Spectacular use of the "Hellcat" was
reported by correspondents with the
American Third Army in the fall of
Orleans, and General Patton's flanking
sweep around Paris. The "Staghound"
has also been particularly successful on
the fighting fronts. It has been used as
a menace to enemy supply lines and in
eliminating machine gun nests and light
weapon emplacements. It is also cred-
ited with important "assists" in the ad-
vance of infantry units and has proved a
particularly effective instrument in the
occupation of inhabited areas. Moving
into a town before troops can take over,
the armored car can locate and blast out
nests of snipers, and then patrol the
areas as a mobile fortress.
microscopes
The mysteries of the infinitesimal

wenhoek discovered the uses of the
microscope. Now, with this instrument
in a veritable state of perfection, man is
able to solve problems of unbelievable
complexities. Minute bacteria have
been unmasked and medical science has
made gigantic progress towards the ir-
radication of disease. But the micro-

world alone; for it has found countless

NEW CAMERA "SHOOTS"
FLYING PROJECTILES
WHEN Army ballistics experts needed to photo-
graph speeding rockets, scientists at Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories built the special "ribbon-
frame" camera.
Their experience came from making high speed
cameras to study tiny movements in telephone
equipment parts.
The new camera gets its name from the narrow
slot that exposes a ribbon of film at a speed of one
ten-thousandth of a second. These "stills," taken
on ordinary film, show a fast flying P-47 firing
its under-wing rocket.
This is an example of the many ways Bell
System research is helping to provide better
weapons, better equipment for war and peace-
time telephone service.

keyway in the axle. The remaining discs
are fitted with lips on their outer edges
which fit into fixed keyways. These lat-
ter discs remain fixed. By an arrange-
ment of levers the operator is able to
bring pressure to bear, which tends to
compress the discs along the shaft. The
fixed discs grip the revolving discs; thus
causing the desired braking effect. When
it is desired to use this as a clutch, as
is the case generally, the only change
required is to connect the fixed discs
with another shaft of revolution. Then
when the discs are compressed, both
axles will revolve at the same speed. To
disengage the clutch, the operator
merely releases the pressure on the discs.
This type of brake or clutch requires a
lubricant between the discs. A variation
of this type is commonly found in mod-
ern auto clutches, which are for all pur-
poses a type of brake. These clutches
or brakes operate by bringing together
two flat surfaces, one fixed to a driven
axle and the other fixed to the axle to be
driven. In this case, no lubricant is used
on the surface as one of them is lined.
So far we have discussed the three gen-
eral types of frictional brakes but have
said nothing as to how they received the
power required to operate them. This is
as important in the consideration of
braking systems as is the study of the
mechanism of the brakes. The various
methods of supplying power to frictional
braking systems may be classified as
follows: simple hand operated levers,
complex power driven lever systems,
gravity, and compressed air and liquids.
For the purpose of supplying power
to braking systems on many types of
machinery, simple levers which may be
Fig. 4
operated by hand or foot will suffice.
Thus, a man holding back on the spoke
of a wagon is for all intents and pur-
poses operating a type of block brake.
The ground in this case acts as the block.
The force tending to hold the wagon
back is the component of the weight of
it tending to press downward and the
man's action on the spoke.
A system closely allied to the band
brake is. often found when a man is
holding a horizontal load which is at-
tached to a line. The man will throw a
few loops of the line over a stump
thereby gaining the required friction.
When complex braking systems are
being considered it becomes apparent
that these simple methods will not be
satisfactory. For instance, the brakes of
most four wheeled vehicles must all be
applied at the same instant and with an
equal braking effect. This necessitates
complex lever systems with appropriate
equalizers and releases. Tandem wheels,
for instance, generally must be braked
equally, regardless of whether or not
one of the axles may in its action be a
foot above the other. In many instances
where the braking must be automatic or
where it must be applied at a constant
rate, power driven lever systems must
be used.
pressure. This is according to certain
laws of physics with which we are all
well acquainted. The main use of air
brakes has been upon railway trains. In
order that disconnected parts of the
train be assured of safe braking power,
the brakes of each car must be held off
by air pressure while the train is con-
nected, and applied by pressure when
disconnected. This is made possible by
the Westinghouse triple valve system.
To explain this system, we must refer to
Figure 5, where the valve is shown when
the brake is released and also when it is
applied. The valve is in the form of a
cylinder A, connected at one end to the
brake pipe and at the other end to the
auxiliary reservoir. The cylinder houses
a piston B, upon the stem of which a
slide valve C is fixed. In the wall of the
cylinder there are two ports, one leading
to the brake cylinder and the other to
the atmosphere. The slide valve, moved

Friction is often defined as the prod-
uct of area, coefficient of friction, and
weight. In most braking systems, the
weight is supplied by mechanisms con-
nected to the machine. However, it is
perfectly legitimate for the weight to be
the weight of the body itself. Thus we
see that gravity or weight is one of the
means of supplying power to braking
systems. Of course, it must be realized
that any such system would be none of
those mentioned above. An example of
such a special system would be the ordi-
nary inclined plane which is often used
when it is required to move an object
from one position to a lower position
without its gaining too much momen-
tum.
Perhaps the most widely used method
of supplying power to braking systems is
that of using compressed air. A com-
pressed gas released into a cylinder can
move a piston and exert an enormous
by the piston, moves over these ports.
When the air in the brake pipe is reduced
below that in the reservoir, the piston
moves to the left until it blocks gap D.
The valve's movement closes the brake
cylinder to the atmosphere. The air
from the reservoir through the control-
ling levers thus applies the brakes. To
release the brakes, the pressure is re-
stored in the brake pipe, moving the pis-
ton over and refilling the reservoir. By
proper care in the reduction of the pres-
sure in the brake pipe, the brakes may
be applied smoothly.
Compressed liquid or hydraulic brakes
work on the same system as the com-
pressed air brakes with the exception
that the liquid cannot be wasted after
use, as in the case of air. Almost all
modern cars are equipped with hy-
draulic brakes in addition to mechanical
brakes. Each wheel is equipped with a

FROM A PLASTIC BAG!
The man adrift here is drinking sea water. But it is
sea water that he has made drinkable by chemicals and
a filter contained in a VlNYLlTE plastic bag*. The plastic
—produced by Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Cor-
poration—has been made possible by the availability of
synthetic organic chemicals, in which this Unit of UCC
specializes.
But the story behind VlNYLlTE plastics is far more
than just the history of another chemical development.
Rather, this unusual substance is indicative of the
way man can learn—through years of uninterrupted re-
search in the basic and applied sciences—to make better
material than nature. It is one more confirmation of the
continuing progress that is achieved by co-ordinating
research, development and engineering.
The importance of Vinyeite plastic in helping to
solve such vital needs as fresh water at sea is typical, in
terms of human progress, of the stature already attained
by many of the 160 synthetic organic chemicals that
Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation now
has in commercial production.
T
*There are good reasons why a VlNYLlTE plastic is used in desalt-
ing bags. It can't mildew or rust. It is strong and tough, scujf-prooj
and shock-proof. It is chemical-resistant and sun-resistant. It is
lightweight, transparent and flexible. It is non-flammable and
cleanable . . . Engineers and executives interested in this material
are invited to write for the booklet P-12 "Vinylite Plastic Sheet

uses in hands of geologists and metallur-
gical engineers. It is used extensively in
testing foods, textiles, minerals, and
metals. Our sinews of war owe their
terrific strength to the powerful eye of the
microscope.
The microscope of the medical labora-
tories is the one most commonly seen.
While there are many adaptations of
this type of apparatus, it is essentially
the same as the Leeuwenhoek version of
the early seventeen hundreds. Leeuwen-
hoek however, had a single magnifica-
tion power on his instrument, while the

machines of today offer their user a
variation of magnifying powers. These,
in general, run between ten and twenty-
five hundred diameters; with special
models having greater power. The ma-
chine common to the biology lab usually
has variations of between 20x and
450x. (The designation 20x means that
the objective appears to the observer
as twenty times its actual size. Simi-
larly 450x appears at 450 times its ac-
tual measurements.)
The modern medical microscope
usually has three objective lenses
mounted on a movable head. Let us as-
sume these lenses are marked 10, 50,
and 100. This is the same as stating
that these lenses will magnify the speci-
men to 10, 50, or 100 times its normal
size, depending, of course, through
which lense the specimen is viewed.
Likewise, the eyepiece is similarly
rated, it being a standard practice to use
lenses of 5x and lOx. The total power
of the microscope is the power of the
eyepiece multiplied by the power of the
objective. Thus, in our theoretical
microscope, we have six possible com-
binations with a variation in magnify-
ing power of between 50x and lOOOx.
Magnification, in itself, is of negligible
value unless it is accompanied by the
capacity of the optical system to resolve
or reproduce extreme detail. Resolution
is the function of the objective which
separates two discrete points of an ob-
ject to appear as such. It is designated
"numerical aperture" (abbreviated to
N/A.). The higher the N/A., the finer
the detail which can be resolved. For
instance, if an objective of .SON/A, will
resolve detail 1/50,000 of an inch in
size, another objective of twice that
N/A. will resolve details 1 100,000 of
an inch apart. In general, high N/A.
and high magnifying power go hand-in-
hand. This is easily understandable
since a magnification sufficient enough
to show detail of 1 20,000 of an inch
would not be strong enough to observe
detail of 1/40,000 of an inch.
Machines of the aforementioned type
may be used only in the observation of
transparent specimens. They operate by
the light passing through the object
from beneath. Thus, the specimen must
be extremely thin. Special machines,
called microtomes are used for this pur-
pose. These machines are so fine that
they could split a human hair twenty
times along its diameter.
In order to obtain best results from
a microscope, proper illumination is im-
perative. This is generally accomplished
by a mirror which reflects the daylight
from below. In the higher-powered
microscope, a system of lenses below the
stage serve to supply the proper illum-
ination.
The types of microscopes seem to be
limitless. Besides the ordinary medical
model, there are microscopes with po-
larizing lenses, which filter out various
colors. These are used extensively in
chemical and metallurgical research.
There are also binocular types with two
eyepieces giving a stereoptic or three-
dimensional vision. These, and many
more similar machines, are in reality to-
day's eyes viewing tomorrow's future.

The butadiene used in the manufac-
ture of the Russian rubber, SKB, is pre-
pared from alcohol obtained by the fer-
mentation of grain or potatoes. Russian
sodium rubbers are designated by the
initials of the Russian word for synthetic
rubber followed by "A" and "B," vary-
ing with the choice of starting materials,
petroleum or alcohol.
When dechlorinated normal butane
(straight chain) is passed into a bath of
molten metal chloride and KC1 main-
tained at 400-600°C, or through a high
chrome steel tube at about 650-700°C,
with or without a catalyst, butadiene is

A gas containing 88 per cent buta-
diene is obtained by placing tetrahydro-
furan at 360° in contact with calcium
phosphate.
Cyclohexene, passed through a high
chrome steel tube at 650-700° C. with
or without a catalyst, is hydrogenated
and produces butadiene. A cheap
method of directly reacting ethylene
and acetylene is outlined in German pat-

ents but is disadvantageous in being dif-
ficult to control and producing low
yields.
From all indications, the main source
of butadiene in this country will con-
tinue to come from two processes: the
catalytic dehydrogenation of gaseous
paraffins to olefins and thence to diole-
fins; and the thermal cracking of petro-
leum. The latter process directly yields
a butadiene which is subjected to purifi-
cation. Russian rubber, SKA, is pro-
duced in this way, and it is reported
that Standard Oil Company uses the
method for the manufacture of a syn-
thetic rubber similar to perbunan.
A plant for the production of mono-
olefins consists essentially of a furnace,
banks of catalyst reactors, and a hydro-
gen separation unit. Automatic con-
trols alternate the flow of paraffin gases
first through the furnace and one section
of the reactors and then through a sec-
ond, while the catalyst is being regener-
ated in the vacated section. The regen-
eration consists in passing through auto-
matically controlled mixtures of air and
combustion gases or steam, to burn off

the carbon on the catalyst at a moderate
temperature (usually below 900°C). A
feature of the process is that the length
of the operating cycle is short, usually of
the order of one hour.
Various types of catalysts have been
recommended, but the oxides of chrom-
ium, molybdenum, vanadium, titanium,
and cerium, supported on carriers of low
catalytic activity, i.e.—alumina, have
been found most satisfactory. These
catalysts meet the following requisites:
they split off the hydrogen selectively
without cleavage of the C-C bond (the
hydrogen may be used in catalytic hy-
drogenation processes elsewhere in the
plant), are easily regenerated, have a
long life, and are low-priced.
The production of butadiene from
butenes, and of isoprenes from pentenes.
is the connecting link between the bil-
lions of cubic feet of butane in natural
and cracked gases (butenes in cracked
gases), the billions of gallons of pentene
in natural gasoline and crude oil, and
the production of synthetic rubbers from
these raw materials.

A general equation describes this con-
version:
CH2=CH-CH=CH2-fH2
The process was run on a pilot plant
scale, using a granular catalyst of alum-
ina impregnated with a 4 per cent
weight of chromic oxide in a,quartz tube
heated by an electric furnace. Con-
densable gases were caught in CO.,
traps; non-condensable gases, by a vac-
uum pump equipped with a metering
and sampling device. The diolefins were
identified by the preparations of the
crystalline derivatives, maleic anhydride
addition compounds, the tetrabromide,
or the di-bromide.
High carbon formation (which fouls
the catalyst) in the dehydrogenation of
olefins can be decreased by operation at
shorter contact times.
The purification of butadiene is a dif-
ficult and important phase in the pro-
duction of synthetic rubber. Though
many methods are in actual commercial
operation, the exact procedures are care-
fully guarded trade secrets. The major
methods include:
(1) Simple distillation. The Phillips
Petroleum Company operates a 200-
plate column which is run at total reflux.
The slug of product occasionally re-
moved from the top contains approxi-
mately 95 per cent butadiene.
(2) Extraction process. On exposure
to SO2, butadiene forms a sulfone which,
when isolated, is heated to re-form pure
butadiene and SO2.
(3) Azeotropic distillation. Patent
literature mentions the application of
SO2 at a temperature too low for the for-
mation of the sulfone.
(4) Liquid-liquid extraction and liq-
uid-gas extraction. Utilization of com-
mon organic solvents, i.e. dioxane. i-
mentioned in patents.
Since the synthetic rubbers vary
somewhat in chemical behavior from
natural rubbers, it is only logical that
their vulcanization properties should dif-

fer somewhat. These differences are not
too great in the case of the butadiene
compounds which can be vulcanized
with sulfur, zinc oxide, and other accep-
tors used in the vulcanization of nat-
ural rubber. Neoprene can be vulcan-
ized with heat alone in the presence of
a trace of oxygen. Sulfur is not only un-
necessary for neoprene but also fre-
quently undesirable, as it lowers heat-
and water-resistant properties and pro-
motes aging or hardening.
Most of the synthetic rubbers show
higher permanent set after stretching,
with the exception of butadiene and ne-
oprene, which approach natural rubber
in this respect. Abrasion resistance is
an important factor, especially in tires.
Butadiene polymers and butyl rubbers
are superior to natural rubber in abra-
sion resistance as are Buna S, Buna N,
chemigum and hycar. Koroseal is satis-
factory in the absence of heat genera-
tion, while thiokol is poor. Synthetic
general statement since neoprene and
koroseal are important materials for
flameproof, oil-resistant electrical insu-
lation.
Natural rubber compounds surpass
synthetics in elasticity, display less en-
ergy losses due to hysteresis, the lowest
heat build up under rapid deformation,
greater resilience, and lower permanent
set. Synthetic rubbers excel where a
rapid damping of vibration is important,
because they absorb more energy during
repeated stresses. The lower rate of gas
diffusion through synthetics makes them

Heat exchange equipment in a butadiene purification
unit.
The butyl rubbers may be vulcanized
in a manner similar to the butadiene co-
polymers. Thiokols require a metallic
oxide.
Polyisobutylene (vistanex) can be
molded with rubber but is non-vulcan-
izable and remains thermoplastic.
In contrast to natural rubbers, the
time of heating for vulcanizing synthetic
rubbers is not a controlled factor be-
cause reconversion (softening and de-
terioration) does not occur.
Most synthetic rubbers, among them
neoprene, can be processed with ma-
chinery applicable to natural rubbers.
In the instance of Buna S, the method of
handling differs. The synthetic is given
a permanent softening by exposure to
hot air, the malleability not affecting
the vulcanized product. Generally, syn-
thetic rubbers require lower tempera-
tures, smaller speed ratios of mill rolls,
and smaller batches.
Buna N and neoprene have higher
modulus figures (a measure of the stiff-
ness of the stock or stress at 300 per
cent elongation) than natural rubber.

rubbers do not equal natural rubbers in
tear resistance, but surpass the latter in
resistance to aging. Synthetic rubbers
are useful for gaskets and hose or wher-
ever extremes of temperature prevail,
which would cause decomposition or ma-
terially affect natural rubber. Generally
speaking, synthetic rubbers resist swell-
ing and chemical corrosion in contrast to
the natural product. Koroseal and butyl
rubber actually withstand the action of
concentrated hychrochloric and sulfuric
acids.
Synthetic rubbers have low water ab-
sorptivity and are therefore used in elec-
trical insulation. The hydrocarbon poly-
mers, the numbered bunas, Buna S, vis-
tanex, and butyl rubber are superior to
natural rubber; those containing polar
groups—neoprene and koroseal—are in-
ferior. This must be accepted as a very
attractive for use in balloons and dirigi-
bles.
In certain laboratory tests, butyl rub-
ber was flexed 5,000,000 times before
failure; koroseal, 3,000,000: natural
rubber, 350,000-850,000.
Neoprene and koroseal cease burning
on the removal of a flame, whereas buta-
diene polymers, thiokol, and natural
rubber continue to burn.
All synthetics other than koroseal are
black since they are compounded with
various blacks known to the trade as
carbon blacks. The odor of synthetic
rubbers persists, not responding to re-
moval treatments as does the natural.
The distinct advantages of synthetic
rubber indicate that it may be not only
a wartime ersatz, but a permanent sup-
plement to natural rubber in post-war
industry.

PEACE
Except as the needs of our nation's security have be-
come manifest, The Dow Chemical Company has
never included in its own program the production of
materials designed solely for a destiny of destruction
... for the destruction of man or of man's possessions.
Rather, its place in industry has been and ever will be
predicated upon the constant enhancement of man's
well-being and contentment.
From this program have come more than five hundred
products: products that aid and guide pharmaceutical
manufacturers in their efforts toward the alleviation
of suffering . . . products for our protection from bac-
teria, insects and fungi . . . plastics of versatile useful'
ness, including new utilization in the field of prosthesis
... Dowmetal, the lightest of all structural metals .. .
and over a thousand chemicals whose use has not yet
been finally determined.
It is with certain satisfaction, albeit tempered with the
humility which so surely touches those who deal in
the potentials of Nature, that the Company reviews,
now, the results of the policy so firmly formulated by
the late Dr. Herbert H. Dow in 1890, more than three
wartimes ago. Those who have inherited the Dow
traditions and responsibilities look hopefully forward
to ever-increasing accomplishment to promote the
chemistry of peace.

fontana dam
(see frontispiece)
While in the remote corners of the
earth this nation is fighting a war
against aggression, inside her borders
she is fighting another war against the
elements: a continual battle to subdue
this nation's mighty flood waters. To
help win this struggle, sixty miles south-
east of Knoxville, where the Little Ten-
nessee sweeps through a deep gorge in
the western fringe of North Carolina,
the Tennessee Valley Authority is build-
ing the largest hydroelectric power dam
east of the Mississippi.
specifications
Fontana Dam will rise 470 feet
from bed rock, and will require almost
2,800,000 cubic yards of concrete. The
plans call for the structure to be 375
feet thick at the base with a twenty
foot roadway extending 2,330 feet
along the top. Necessary evacuation
for the dam involved the moving of
more than 1,600,000 cubic yards of
rock and earth . The 29-mile lake which
it forms will reach almost to Bryson
City, N.C. and spreads out in its upper
reaches into the Nantahala and Tucka-
segee Rivers.
In building Fontana Dam the T.V.A.
set up one of the largest construction
plants in the country. It is designed to
produce 15,000 tons of aggregate (rock
and sand of various sizes) per day. It
will handle 8,000 barrels of cement a
day, mixing and placing 8,000 cubic
yards of concrete in the same amount of
time.
Some idea of the magnitude of the
job may be noted in a summary of the
principle construction plant equipment
required; 16 tractors of 95 to 110 hp;
three tractors of 80 hp; four tractors of
25 to 30 hp: eleven power shovels; one
75 hp electric tunnel mucker: two elec-
tric hammerhead cranes; one locomo-
tive crane; two 42-ton primary gyratory
crushers; two 41/L&gt; foot standard cone
crushers and two 4-foot short head cone
crushers; two nine-by-twelve-foot rod
mills: and one refrigeration plant for
cooling concrete with a capacity of 225
tons per hour.
To supply enough material for the
construction of the dam, every day
enough rock to fill a freight-car train
two and one-half miles long is taken out
of the 400-foot walls of a nearby quarry.
Nine inch holes are drilled 250 feet
deep into the quarry walls and packed
with explosives. One big blast, using
200,000 pounds of dynamite, brings
down as much as 650,000 tons of rock.
To make the river flow around the
stream bed, where the work is going on
day and night, two tunnels, large enough
to fly a small airplane through, have
been blasted through the rock mountain.
When the lake behind the dam is full,
these tunnels, which are 34 feet in di-
ameter, and an average length of 1,750
ft will be used as a part of the spillway
outlet. Each tunnel has a maximum ca-
pacity of 95,000 cfs.
The emergency spillway is located
about 600 feet from the left abutment
of the dam. The discharge from this
spillway will be carried through the
ridge by a horseshoe-shaped concrete-
lined tunnel, 30 feet in diameter and
400 feet long, to a secondary valley
which joins the main river one half
mile below the dam.
housing accommodations
When the first construction crews
brought their trucks and bulldozers
into the gorge of the Little Tennessee
to start work on the Fontana Dam,
bears and other wild animals used to
come down and watch them work. Now
a busy city has been built on the steep
slopes of the Yellow Creek mountains
where 6,000 of the Fontana workers
and their families live. This community
has facilities equal to those of a modern
city. It has moving picture shows,
white and \egro schools, barber shops,
beauty parlors, food stores a band, hos-
pital, drug store, cafeteria, library, post
office, pool hall, gymnasium, softball
fields, and tennis courts.
The cafeteria in the center of the
main camp, with a seating capacity of
more than 680 men, and the Negro cafe-
teria with accommodations for 250 men,
serves four times a day to accommodate
war workers from all three shifts and
packs lunches for the men to take to
their jobs at no extra charge. The mini-
mum cost of lodging and three meals a
day is $20.00 a month.
importance
Needless to say this mighty structure
has not been constructed for flood con-
trol alone, for these TVA dams have
impounded huge lakes to create new
highways for commerce, to bring flood-
waters under control, and to generate
power sorely needed by a nation, either
at war or at peace.

Know Timken Bearings-
Be a beffer Engineer
Just as the design of the Timken Tapered
Roller Bearing has been developed and im-
proved steadily over a long period of years,
so also has the manufacture of the Timken
Bearing been brought to its supremely high
standard.
The factory of The Timken Roller Bearing
Company is not only the largest in the world
devoted exclusively to the manufacture of
tapered roller bearings; it also is one of the
world's finest examples of precision produc-
tion on an extensive scale.
To give the Timken Roller Bearing its watch-
like accuracy, many millions of dollars are
invested in tools, gauges and automatic ma-
chines of all kinds. Tolerances of less than
one ten-thousandth of an inch are regularly
adhered to in many phases of manufacture.
Thus, although millions of Timken Bearings
are produced every month, so accurate are our
manufacturing methods and so careful our
inspection and testing, that uniformity of
quality — and consequently of performance
— are consistently maintained.
No matter what type of machine you may
be designing, nor the bearing service fac-
tors involved, you can always depend upon
Timken Bearings to meet every require-
ment with utmost efficiency. The Timken

As this is written, Fontana Dam is
well on the road to completion. Within
a few months, the power station at the
base of this man-made mountain will
begin to function and over 200,000 kilo-
watts will be added to the output of the
TVA system.
Harnessing the river at this site even
in peacetime, would be an engineering
feat. Successful prosecution of the work
on schedule, under wartime conditions,
adds another illuminating chapter to
the constructive achievements on Amer-
ica's homefront. Fontana Uam is a
monument to the skill, resourcefulness,
and teamwork of all who have had a
part in building it, and who confidently
expect to complete this $70,000,000
project this year.
signaling device
Nine men in a life-raft pray for their
life. Their diary reflects despair:
First Day: About 11:30 a.m. we
spotted a Navy plane coming over close.
We fired four of the precious flares of
our raft, but received no response. . ."
Second Day: Around two o'clock a
Navy scout plane came over close. We
all waved shirts and flashed signals with
can tops. . ."
Seventh Day: (Two had died) An-
other plane flew up, seemingly straight
toward us. It passed not more than a
mile away. God, we could practically
see the pilot's eyes. But it went on
by. . ."
Above diary is typical of many, many,
written by stranded fliers, shipwrecked
sailors, soldiers and marines of torpe-
doed vessels.
A rescue party approaches the ship-
wreck: soon disappears again on the
horizon, not having discovered the ship-
wreck.
But at last science has taken a hand
in the problem of rescue. A signaling de-
vice has been developed which trans-
forms potential rescuers into actual ones.
As demanded by the War Depart-
ment, requirements for the signaling de-
vice included:
1. High reflective power, and a sur-
face to stay bright under severe salt air
or water exposure.
2. Resistance to impact, abrasion, and
bending, all of which would rapidly re-
duce the intensity of a reflected beam.
3. Convenience in use and insurance
against loss.
4. Most important: Absolute preci-
sion in aiming of sun beam at rescuing
party.
A signaling mirror satisfying all those
requirements was finally developed by
Mr. W. M. Potter of General Electric.
It consists of a small rectangle of tem-
pered (heat treated) polished plate glass'
with a corner hole to make possible its
suspension from the neck by means of a
cord.
The rear surface of the glass is cov-
ered with a thin film of vaporized alum-
inum of very high reflectivity. The re-
flection factor reaches .85, which is
30% higher than that of chromium
plate. Under good sunlight conditions,
the beam candlepower appears to be
from 15 to 16 millions. The mirror has
an enormous range of a maximum of ten
miles, and therefore its reflected beam
may attract attention of rescuers not
visible to the exposed man.
The "Solar Searchlight," as it is called
by its inventor, is resistant to salt air
and water, as well as tough and resistant
to ordinary abrasion.
Though no glass is absolutely break-
age proof, the mirror is tempered to a
degree insuring maximum resistance to
fracture from impact. When broken, it
does not form sharp, dangerous splint-
ers, but disintegrates into small, blunt
crystals. Since these mirrors are worn
by our men on their bodies, this is a
most important quality.
The dimensions of the signaling mir-
ror are four by five inches, thus making
it of convenient size. It weighs less than
eight ounces.
The outstanding feature of Mr. Pot-
ter's "Solar Searchlight" is its aiming de-
vice.
When an ordinary plane mirror is
used, the reflected beam of sunlight is
narrow. Its spread is only about \'-&gt; deg..
or, in diameter, about 50 ft. at a dis-
tance of one mile. It is easy to direct
such a beam to a nearby target by
noting the position of the spot produced
by the beam. But when the target is
at some distance, possibly on the horizon
or in the air, the spot can no longer be
seen, and a means of precision aiming is
required. It is obviously desirable that
facilities for aiming be integral with the
mirror and that they do not invariably
require the use of both hands.
In the Signaling Mirror, the means for
aiming consists only of the central cross-
shaped aperture; and the round section
of aluminum film left visible on the rear

America's NEW Frontier
O IN AMERICA'S EARLY DAYS of growth, op-
portunities for progress lay in the ever widen-
ing frontiers. In the fertile lands of the great
plains ... in the timber of our forests ... in
the metal of our mines.
Today, we have reached the limit of our
physical frontiers. But new frontiers lie be-
fore us—new opportunities for exploration—
in our research laboratories. Here in the
multiple world of the electron tube are be-
ing born the scientific advances that will make
our world immeasurably safer and happier.
Pioneering on this new frontier of research
are RCA Laboratories in Princeton, New Jer-
sey. Today RCA Laboratories are devoted to
providing the fighting forces of the United
Nations with the best radio and electronic
equipment available. Tomorrow, this same
skill will continue to serve America in creat-
ing new and finer peacetime products.

side. The cross form is desirable be-
cause it facilitates finding and follow-
ing the target; and sunlight shining
through produces a spot of distinctive
shape.
As indicated in the instructions
printed on the back of the mirror,
the procedure of aiming the reflected
beam is simple. The user positions
the mirror to face a point about
halfway between sun and target, picks
up the image of the sunlight cross in the
round rear mirror and sights the target
through the center of the cross. The
conditions for accurate aiming are com-
pleted when the mirror is tilted so as to
superimpose the image of the spot on
the aperture and target.
The parallel opposite surfaces of the
very thin aluminum film best insure co-
incidence of beam with line of sight.
Obviously, if they were out of parallel
by only a small fraction of a degree, the
narrow reflected beam might miss the
target entirely.
The film's microscopic thickness is
also an advantage since it permits view-
ing and centering targets at angles as
high as 80 degrees from the perpendicu-
lar to the mirror surface. Were reflect-
ing material of substantial thickness
used, the deeper aperture would act as a
louver, restricting the angle of view.
There are, of course, two conditions
under which the aiming method is not
applicable:
(a) When target is silhouetted di-
rectly against a bright sun
(b) When it is 180 degrees away
from the sun.
Tn locations near the latter point, the
user's head may place the mirror in the
shadow, or the mirror may be so greatly
foreshortened as to be ineffective. If the
angle is such that aiming cannot be ac-
complished with either eye, a second
mirror may be used to direct sunlight to
the signaling mirror at a more favorable
angle.
That the mirror is practicable even
under extreme conditions has been con-
clusively proved in official tests con-
ducted by government authorities. Re-
sults show that a man in a life jacket
and in rough water can consistently sig-
nal distant ships, aircraft, or other van-
tage points.
BRAKING SYSTEMS
(continued from page 26)
piston connected to the main line by
tubes. The main line leads to what is
usually spoken of as the master cylinder.
The master cylinder is a reservoir con-
taining about one half a pint of brake
fluid and equipped with a piston. When
the piston moves forward the liquid is
compressed throughout the entire sys-
tem, working the individual pistons at
the wheels and thus applying the power
to the brakes. The one main difficulty
of this system is that when it fails there
is no way in which the operator can ap-
ply the brakes unless a secondary system
is also installed.
In the western region of the United
States, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St.
Paul and Pacific Railroad operates six
hundred and sixty miles of electrified
railroad. Regenerative braking plays an
important part in the operation of this
line; the air brakes being used only in
emergencies and for bringing the train
to a full stop. The principle behind this
system is that as the train is going down
hill its potential energy is changed to
electricity to be used in other trains. In
this method, the electric trains running
this route are able to return fourteen per
cent of the total power consumed.

PLY
testing motors at
30,000 rpm
The creation of high-speed motors for
the war effort has resulted in the de-
signing of a new dynamometer. In the
past, dynamometers for testing motors
and generators at high speeds up to
20,000 rpm have not been available.
Performance of some high-speed motors
of conventional design has been de-
termined reasonably well by extrapola-
tion of curves based on data obtained
at slower speeds and on one or two spot
checks obtained by driving high speed
fans of known characteristics. But the
performance of the new types of air-
plane motors needs to be obtained with
precision from actual tests. The new
high-speed dynamometer is capable of
testing machines of 1/100 to 3/4 H.P.
and is frequently operated at speeds up
to 25,000 rpm. It has been run as fast
as 30,000 rpm. The dynamometer is of
the conventional cradle type, but uses
special low-loss steel in the armature
and embodies every known expedient to
provide high bursting strength. It is
strictly a laboratory instrument; com-
mercial models will not be available.
supreme accuracy
High precision methods developed at
Louisville, Ky., in the nations largest
privately-operated Naval Ordnance
plant have resulted in the manufacture
of a five-inch Naval gun so accurate it
can hit a two-foot target at a mile and
a 16-foot target at seven and one-half
miles. Enough of these guns have been
produced to equip the equivalent of 375
average cruisers. "This 5-inch single
mount gun is one of the most accurate
rapid-fire guns of its size in existence
because it can fire as fast as it can be
loaded, but its exact rate is a secret."

This new gun has an effective range of
seven and one-half miles and can be
used either as a combat gun or as an
anti-aircraft gun. In use as an anti-
aircraft gun it frequently surprises
enemy fliers who are accustomed to plan
their attack coarses according to guns
offering far less range and accuracy.
steam-driven forced-draft
blowers
Damage to the electrical system of a
merchant ship in combat areas might
cause outage of the motor driven blower •
supplying air to the furnaces thus caus-
ing the ship to roll. To eliminate this
link in the ship's power plant a new
type of steam driven blower has been
developed. It is the same type of blow-
er used on fighting vessels, stripped of
many features made necessary by the
more rigorous demands of Navy service.
It has, for example, no speed-limiting
governor. The speed of the turbine is
limited by the blower, which provides a
load that rises as a cube with speed.
Hence runaway is impossible. The new
blower forgoes a separate oil cooler, and
therefore needs no water connections.
It is built for vertical operation. Be-
cause both bearings are placed below
the turbine element, i. e., overhanging
the single stage of blading and the blow-
er, only one steam gland is required.
This also makes it possible to lift out
the whole rotor element as a unit as-
sembly with the bearings. By a unique
arrangement of oil chambers, no packing
is needed to hold oil. The steam-driven

It took the Liberty ship to make a chump out of Nazi Admiral
Doenitz! He told Hitler his U-Boats would starve England
out of the war. But he reckoned without our ability to build
ships by the hundred and get most of them through safely.
We are proud of the part The Carborundum Company played
in making that record. For in shipbuilding, as in every other
modern industry, "CARBORUNDUM"-made products are helping
do the job faster, better and at lower cost.
For instance, grinding wheels
by "Carborundum" precision
grind pins and bearings for
giant marine crankshafts. They
accurately grind and finish en-
gine cylinders, pistons, gears,
rods, parts—and miles of ship
welds. Abrasives, refractories
and "Globar" electric heating
elements by "Carborundum"
are all tools vital to production.
This wide application offers ex-
ceptional opportunities for En-
gineer-Salesmen. If interested,

motors keep gyros
spinning
The gyroscopes, that keep our guns
steady while firing, require special high
speed motors for motive power. One
motor is required to bring its gyro fly-
wheel to full speed of 12000 rpm in two-
tenths of a second. This motor—about
the size and shape of a beer bottle—
weighs but 10.S pounds but developes
22 hp. To get the 600 amps, into the

Courtesy Wcstinghousc
armature, the brushes must work at a
current density of 1600 amps, per square
inch. Another gyro required a motor of
super construction accuracy in which
the weight had to be almost perfectly
distributed. To balance these rotors,
special dynamic machines had to be
built. Eight times more sensitive than
Dynetric balancers ordinarily used in
precision work, these machines are able
to detect an excess or shortage of weight
on the S-inch diameter flywheel of but
one ten-thousandth of an ounce. All
parts for these motors are made on a
production basis and are completely
interchangeable. To do this it is neces-
sary that all finishing operations be per-
formed in temperature-controlled, dust-
free rooms. These tiny motors must
operate under trying conditions. This
involves a severe lubrication problem,
especially so since space for lubrication
is small. The motors are totally in-
closed and are confined in tight housings
along with other heat-producing ap-
paratus; thus the temperature problem
is doubly aggravated. Because ordi-
nary varnish might soften at the high
operating temperatures and deform (de-
stroying balance), special thermosetting
varnish is used that won't shift when
hot. Even the standard progressive
winding cannot be used in the d-c arma-
ture because it does not distribute the
mass of copper around the rotor with
sufficient uniformity to provide the pre-
cise balance required.
war on fungi
Because of fungi growth, unprotected
organic insulation—varnish, cloth, or
molded material—can survive but a few
days or sometimes only a few hours in
tropical combat regions. The enemy
has carried the battle into regions where
the rainfall is 25 inches a year and the
temperature never goes below 70 de-
grees. This type of climate furnishes
ideal conditions for fungi growth. Over-
night fungus can reduce a sheet of leath-
er to slime. It can even attach itself
to optically clean glass and produce a
substance capable of etching the surface.
To combat this growth, which can easily
be more destructive than the guns of
the enemy, a substance, which is toxic
to fungus, has been developed. The
equipment to be treated by this sub-
stance is coated with varnish and the
substance is added to the varnish used
in the last application. This substance
develops a very low but continual, vapor
pressure adequate to prevent fungi from
taking rest on the surface.

VVTHAT do you think of this?" said
* * the research physicist, hauling out
alongwide flexible ribbon of glass as thin
as paper. He shook it and it bent and rai-
ded like rain on a roof.
"What's it for?" said the fellow who
writes these ads. "Well," said the physi-
cist,"it may have a lot of uses.We haven't
had time to explore them all yet. But one
we've already found is in wartime radio
equipment."
This interesting new type of glass is just
one of the many contributions of glass
research to the war. For the glass indus-
try has thrown its entire accumulated ex-
perience, engineering and research facili-
ties, into the job of putting glass on the
fighting and industrial fronts where it
can hurt our enemies most.
War and Corning research have put glass
in a lot of strange places. For instance,
there was a time when almost all piping
in chemical plants was alloy of one kind
or another. Now chemical people have
discovered that glass piping is bet-
ter for many purposes, and Corning
has even developed a method for
welding it into continuouslengths.
What about the business you choose to
follow? Perhaps someday glass can re-
place metals, speed production, improve
products for you. It has for others, and
Corning knows how to apply glass to
many different problems. Keep it in mind.

the procedure that inventors must fol-
low before they can obtain the patents
which should rather, in their minds, be
pressed upon them. Vet one of the pur-
poses of the patent system in this coun-
try is to give to the public the benefit
of disclosures of inventions at as early
a date as possible. Indeed, the history
of our patent laws seems to reveal a
series of attempts to determine, by a
method of successive approximations,
just how soon prospective patentees can
be required to file their applications
I after completing their inventions.
I one year public use
| At present a valid patent on an in-
"vention cannot be obtained unless the
application be filed within one year
from the first public use or sale of the
invention in the United States. For-
merly the length of this period was two
years. The thought back of this limi-
tation of public use is that the public
should not suddenly see itself deprived
of an invention after having enjoyed
the unrestricted use of it for a period
of years. In this respect a patent
assumes a certain similarity to real
property; and it was held in a suit for
infringement that, if an inventor allows
the public at large to use his improve-
ments for many years, "he must be
deemed to have made a gift of them to
the public, as much as a person who vol-
untarily opens his land as a highway,
and suffers it to remain for a length of
time devoted to public use.
The law, at least since its revision in
1870, is perfectly clear as to this re-
quirement. Yet its application has been
found so full of difficulties that it has

been disregarded by numerous patentees,
who were often apparently quite un-
aware of being tardy.
what is public use?
Naturally, before different aspects of
public use are examined, the question
arises, just what does constitute a pub-
lic use? As is often the case in patent
law, a too general definition is danger-
ous in that it may be inapplicable to
some unforeseen set of circumstances.
With due caution it may be considered
that an invention is in public use when
it is used openly by the inventor for
its intended purpose and also when it is
used by any one beyond the control of
the inventor. To apply this rule to any
particular instance of its use, it is, how-
ever, always necessary to bear in mind
the explanatory statements made by the
courts and the conclusions reached in
cases involving similar states of facts.
experimental use
Taken literally, the public use stat-
utes were always quite inflexible. It
was not very long, however, before in-
ventors, or more probably, their counsel,
had the brilliant idea that, if public use
of an invention for more than two years
(now one) before filing is a bar to the
grant of a patent, there is no reason
why some other kind of use could not
take place at that time without having
such an effect. The most frequent ex-
ample of innocuous use is experimental
use, which has served many times as an
excuse for delay during the last six or
seven decades. While in many instances
a long use of an invention cannot rea-
sonably be interpreted as being experi-
mental, a well proven experimental use
made in good faith has often been held
by the courts not to be a public use.
The authority for this policy is the
Supreme Court, which stated that:
"It is sometimes said that an in-
ventor acquires an undue advantage
over the public by delaying to take out
a patent inasmuch, as he thereby pre-
serves the monopoly to himself for a
longer period than is allowed by the
policy of the law; but this cannot be
said with justice when the delay is oc-
casioned by bona fide effort to bring his
invention to perfection, or to ascertain
whether it will answer the purpose in-
tended. His monopoly only continues
for the allotted period, in any event;
and it is in the interest of the public,
as well as himself, that the invention
should be perfect and properly tested,
before a patent is granted for it."
profits from experimental use
Litigants in patent suits have often
made legal history out of the fact that
experimental use and use for profit may
be hard to distinguish, and a use in
public may even serve both as an ex-
periment and as a source of revenue.
Naturally if a patentee happened to put
his invention to any use at all before
the period allowed by law, an infringer
will solemnly assert that the use was
public and that it invalidates the patent,
while the patentee will contend no less
strenuously that the use was experi-
mental and hence permissible. The
Supreme Court, therefore, went one step
further in an attempt to bring order out
of chaos, and stated that:
"A use by the inventor for the pur-
pose of testing the machine, in order by
experiment to devise additional means

SELF-PROPELLED BOMBS?
by
COLONEL HENRY W. MILLER
Chairman of the Department of Mechanism and Engineering Drawing
An article in Newsweek for Novem-
ber 20, 1944, has the title "V-2 Weapons
May Win Next War But Come Too
Late For This One." Any such title as
this in a reputable magazine leads the
readers to wonder precisely what is
meant by that title. Is it actually true
that the V-l jet-propelled bombs and
now the V-2 rocket type bombs have
been so destructive, even in their crude
state of development, that it is justifi-
able to say the next war may be won
through the use of them?
On the day when Mr. Churchill re-
ported to the House of Commons such
details as he had available with refer-
ence to the use of the V-2 rocket, a well-
known broadcaster used about five
minutes of his fifteen in painting a very
gloomy picture of the future in which
a nation might completely overwhelm its
enemies with this particular type of pro-
jectile. With no information beyond
that contained in the brief report of Mr.
Churchill, the commentator was telling
the public that this type of weapon
would be so developed in the accuracy
of its propulsion and in the dimensions
of its destructive power that future war-
fare would be transformed completely
and that nations would be overwhelmed
in a few hours from the time of the
launching of a super rocket attack. It
is no wonder that citizens of the United
States are asking these questions: What
are we doing in the development of jet-
propelled bombs similar to the V-l?
What are the real qualities of the V-2?
What are the probable possibilities of
this type of weapon for effective use in
warfare? They ask whether we are pre-
paring to bombard Japan with V-l types
of jet-propelled bombs and if not, why?
The publication of illustrations of the
jet-propulsion apparatus made in record
time by the Ford Company last year
adds to the public belief that we are
planning such warfare.
On Sunday, December 17, the captain
of a destroyer group which was in the
Leyte landing described the part of his
destroyer in demolishing beach installa-
tions. He said in particular "when we
were through with our targets we with-
Col. Henry W. Miller.
drew and the rocket boats took over."
Following is a copy of part of a navy
report on the work of such ships: "Mov-
ing ahead of the first waves of landing
craft, they worked with battleships,
cruisers and destroyers in the bombard-
ment which preceded the landing.
Standing offshore and with great naval
shells howling overhead the rocket craft
blazed away time after time leaving sec-
tions of the defenses (beach) a dancing
floor of flame, carpets of bursts crashed
on the hillsides or sections of the
beach!"
And then this confusing statement is
made: "Each rocket ship (perhaps a
converted LSI) carries an aggregate fire
power two and one-half times that of a
New Jersey class (45,000 ton) battle-
ship."
Could anything be more confusing to
those who do not know that each de-
vice of the army or navy is purely
functional and not a jack-of-all-trades.
A converted LSI the equivalent of a 75
million dollar super battleship!
The purpose of this discussion is not
to disparage in any manner the utility
of rockets. They are now in warfare to
stay just as mortars, machine guns and
artillery. However they are highly
specialized weapons of limited utility
having a low degree of precision except
under very special circumstances, and
they merely augment the present array
of destructive devices. They do not re-
place any weapon.
The present discussion may seem to
be more essentially about artillery than
about super rockets. The reason for
this is to indicate the degree of pre-
cision which must be attained before
we will adopt and use ten to fifteen ton
devices of the V-2 kind, or the lighter,
more destructive V-l.
There probably never was a war that
did not have its measure of spectacular-
ly dramatic events and when these could
be discussed in the newspapers, they
always drew the headlines. It is a well-
known practice of newspapers likewise,
to spread it on heavily when they break
a story and very seldom to say at any
later date in equally spectacular head-
lines or front page articles that they
were poorly informed, having frightened
the public unnecessarily, and that the
effects were infinitely less than had been
at first reported. Apparently this is not
news, so the public is left with the be-
lief that the original headlines and scare
story represent the whole picture.
Regardless of the dramatic qualities
of V-l and V-2 bombs of this war and
the Paris Guns of the other war, the
various departments of an army must
always ask themselves some very search-
ing questions when they decide to de-
sign and put into production any given
type of weapon. To defeat an enemy
one must (1) destroy so many of his
fighting men that he cannot continue
the war; or (2) destroy so much of his
production capacity that he cannot
supply his men with fighting equipment:
or (3) destroy so many of his ships or
roads and railways that he cannot
transport supplies to his battlefronts:
or (4) overrun so much of his territory
that he is unable to continue the war.
One or more of these objectives must
always be accomplished, and in the end.
it is always necessary to overrun and
take possession of so much of the re-
sources of an enemy that he is con-
vinced he has lost his war. Each de-

of these necessary accomplishments in
recommending a program of design, de-
velopment, manufacture and transporta-
tion of any and all of the array of in-
struments that are employed in warfare.
One may sum this up by saying that
each item decided upon and then de-
signed, developed and produced, must
accomplish its mission with such a de-
gree of dependability that one may
definitely count upon it to assist in
winning the war.
dependable effect vs. possible
psychological or material
effect
In the American Revolutionary War
the colonial army introduced into war-
fare an idea so tellingly effective that it
probably was instrumental in the win-
ning of that war. Some of the American
soldiers were equipped with the French
Charleroi musket of the model of 1765;
but there were not by any means enough
of these. The British soldiers were
equipped with a musket commonly
called Brown Bess. Both of these were
approximately the length of our Civil
War muskets. Because of the shortage
of muskets and the lack of confidence
that the colonist had in a musket, it
became necessary to require each new
recruit to provide his own weapon. It
soon became apparent that a very large
number of the colonists, particularly
those who lived in outlying regions,
possessed a new lightweight gun, a muz-
zle loading rifle. The design had been
originated by gun makers in Lancaster,
Pennsylvania, who found that they
could not sell their extremely heavy-
barrelled rifled guns to a colonist who
had to pack it on his back all day long.
Therefore, they had made a lightweight
rifle that eventually became known in
America as the Kentucky rifle. It was
approximately five feet long, light in
weight and fired a spherical lead bullet
about one-half inch in diameter.
A handbook, compiled by a manu-
facturer of these rifles, and now in the
possession of the writer, contains some
extremely interesting and pertinent in-
formation. There are two etchings of
the accuracy with which these rifles
could be used against a given target. In
each case the target is a man. In the
first, the range is 100 yards and in the
second it is 200 yards. At 200 yards,
all but two of 24 shots had found their
mark in the torso or upper arms or
thighs of the man. Any one of the 22
shots would have killed or disabled the
man. The second target at 100 yards
shows the effect of the firing of 34
rounds. In this case, all but two struck
the man in the torso, or thighs, or
shoulders. Any one of the 32 would
certainly have killed or disabled him.
These are excellent illustrations of the
degree of accuracy which a rifle of that
time had to attain in order to be useful
to a colonist. To be worth the purchase
price and to serve a backwoodsman, a
rifle had to kill an Indian at 200 yards
or to kill a bear or deer or turkey at 100
yards. Demonstrations at fairs and
competitions on various occasions were
sufficient to prove that a rifle would ac-
complish this.
When the backwood colonist enlisted
in the Continental army and brought
with him this Lancaster rifle, he intro-
duced into warfare an entirely new idea,
that is, accuracy of gunfire. So in-
accurate were the British Brown Bess
musket and the French Charleroi mus-
ket that to hit a man definitely at 100
feet was a real achievement. It is not
surprising then that the men were usual-
ly ordered to hold their fire until they
could see the whites of the eyes of the
opponent. A record of the number of
rounds fired at the Battle of Waterloo
in 1815 by British soldiers indicated in
terms of the number of Frenchmen
found on the field that they had fired
450 rounds to hit one Frenchman. But
almost immediately after the back-
woodsman appeared in the Continental
Army, it became known in the British
Army that when one of these buck-
shirted soldiers stepped from behind a
tree as far as 200 yards away and aimed
his rifle, he was looking at a man whom
he certainly was going to kill or maim.
This event had never occurred in war-
fare before. The record of the back-
woodsman for accuracy of fire was soon
such that enlistments practically ceased
in Britain and it eventually became
necessary to hire the Hessians to help
fight that war. This probably added to
the resentment of the colonists, and they
finished the war.
It may seem very odd that having in-
troduced that idea into warfare so early
as 1775, we did not adopt muzzle load-
ing rifles as regulation weapons until the
very end of the Civil War in 1865. But
it is true that during all of this time
America was becoming what we may
term precision minded. That is, we had
so much to do and so little time in
which to do it that every device that
was made and utilized and every effort
expended on any task had to be, of

Optical glass differs so widely from
all other varieties of glass that its man-
ufacture may almost be regarded as an
industry separate from that of the mak-
ing of other types. A consideration of
properties of optical glass and their in-
dustrial significance will serve to em-
phasize this difference.
properties of optical glass
Optical glass, contrary to prevalent
belief, is not merely clear high-grade
glass, similar in quality to fine domestic
glassware. Among the qualities which
differentiate optical glass are high trans-
parency, freedom from color, non-dis-
playal of selective absorption throughout
the visual range, resistance to moisture
and gases, and the absence of tarnish
and efflorescence.
The properties which affect the value
of optical glass may roughly be divided
into two groups, the first comprising the
specifically optical properties, i.e., those
directly influencing the behavior of
light in its passage through the glass,
the second covering those properties of
a more general nature which are of
special importance in glass that is to
be used for optical purposes.
The most essential optical property
of glass is homogeneity. Glass can never
be regarded as a definite compound. It
consists of mutual solutions of various
complex silicates, borates, etc. Solu-
tions being of the very nature of mix-
tures of two or more different sub-
stances, it follows that they can only
become homogeneous when complete
mixing has taken place. A familiar
example of the formation of such a sol-
ution is the dissolving of sugar in water.
The water surrounding the sugar be-
comes saturated with sugar, and is
therefore of different density from the
remaining water. If the water is slight-
ly stirred, the pure water and the dense
sugar solution do not at once mix com-
pletely, the denser liquid remaining for
a time disseminated throughout the
whole fluid mass in the form of more
or less fine lines, sheets, or eddies, which
are visible because the imperfectly
mixed liquids have different effects on
the light passing through them. The
sugar-water mixture is, however, a very

mobile liquid, one with a low viscosity,
and one in which a few turns of a tea-
spoon is sufficient to render the mixture
complete and the solution homogeneous
and transparent.
In the manufacture of glass, when
the raw materials are melted together,
a very viscous mixture results; and fur-
ther complete stirring can not be at-
tained. In glass, as ordinarily manu-
factured, therefore, it is not surprising
to find a lack of homogeneity. Its ef-
fects can be traced whenever a thick
piece of ordinary glass is examined.
The threads or layers of different dens-
ities can be recognized in the form of
minute internal irregularities in the
glass. These defects are known as striae
or veins, and their presence in glass
intended for the better kind of optical
work renders the glass useless. As will
be seen later, in the production of opti-
cal glass, special means are adopted for
the purpose of rendering it as homogen-
eous as possible. In fact, the early his-
tory of optical glass manufacture is
simply the history of attempts to over-
come this defect. The problem is, how-
ever, beset by chemical and physical
difficulties; and even in the best mod-
ern practice, the occurrence of striae
presents the greatest problem to the
glass technician.
Transparency and color are obviously
fundamentally important properties of
glass. In one sense, homogeneity is
essential to transparency, but the as-
pects of the subject which are now
being considered is that of the absorp-
tion of light in the course of regular
transmission through the glass. It may
be said that no glass is either perfectly
transparent, or, what comes to nearly
the same thing, perfectly free from
color. In the best optical glass the
absorption of light is very slight when
considerable thicknesses are viewed,
showing a greenish-yellow or bluish
colouring. To some extent, the public
objects to the use of even a slightly
greenish glass in optical instruments of
good quality. In many cases glassmak-

ish glass, but in order to overcome the
color they deliberately add to the glass
a coloring oxide which imparting a color
more or less complementary to the nat-
ural green tine. The result is a natural
glass which, however, absorbs much
more light than the naturally green
glass would have.
Refraction and dispersion, the quan-
titative properties of glass which govern
its effects upon incident and transmitted
light, are of fundamental importance in
all optical uses. The basic optical con-
stant of each variety of optical glass is
known as its refractive index. The index
really represents the ratio of the veloc-
ity with which light waves are propa-
gated through free space to the velocity
with which they travel through the
glass. Not only does the ratio vary with
every change in chemical composition
and physical condition of the glass, but
it also varies according to the length of
the light waves themselves.
In the glass industry, there are ordi-
nary trade names by which each type
of glass is known. These names, while
somewhat arbitrary, indicate in a
rough way the chemical nature of the
glass concerned. Thus, the word ''flint"
always implies a glass containing lead,
therefore having a comparatively high
refractive index and a high dispersive
power of the glass. The word "crown"
originally applied only to lime-silicate
glasses but is now used more for all
glass having a comparatively low dis-
persive power. The most desirable op-
tical glass should combine the proper-
ties of both flint and crown glass, in
other words, it should be a glass with
both high refractive power and low
dispersion. An example of one of the
newer types of glass that combines
these properties is the barium crown
glass. However, as the chemical com-
position of a glass "forced" by the addi-
tion of special substances intended to
affect its optical properties in an ab-
normal direction, the chemical and
physical stability of the glass is rapidly
lessened. The more extreme glasses, in
fact, behave as active chemical agents,
readily entering into reaction or com-
bination even with relatively inert sub-
stances in their environment. They re-
act vigorously with the pots in which
they are melted, and are rapidly at-
tacked by acid, moisture, or even warm
air when in the finished condition.
Others tend to crystallize upon cooling
into an opaque agglomerate, and are
only prevented from crystallizing by
rapid cooling through certain critical
ranges of temperature. A limit to the
possibility of production is set by these
tendencies when they exceed a certain
amount, a point being reached where
it ceases to be practicable to overcome
the tendency of the glass to self-de-
struction.
In addition to possessing the re-
quired optical constants, viz., a good
color and perfect homogeneity, certain
other properties are essential in good
optical glass. These are the general
physical and chemical qualities which
are necessary in all good glass, but
which especially emphasized by the fact
that the requirements for optical glass
are more stringent than for any other
variety. Thus, chemical stability is of
the greatest importance, for the best
lenses would soon become useless if the
action of the atmospheric moisture were
to affect them appreciably. The harder
varieties of glass such as boro-silicate
crowns are probably the most durable
and chemically resistant.
(Left) Fig. 2—Blunger machine in which
pot clays are mixed.
(Right) Fig. 3—Removing inside form from
cast pot to facilitate drying.
However, as mentioned before, when
extreme optical properties are required,
the necessary chemical composition of
the glass always entails a sacrifice of
this chemical and physical stability.
manufacturing aspects
The process of manufacturing the
best qualities of optical glass may be
briefly described as consisting of obtain-
ing a crucible full of the purest and
most homogeneous glass, and then al-
lowing it to cool slowly and to solidify
"in situ." Perfect homogeneity essential
for optical purposes can only be at-
tained by laborious means, and can
then be retained only if the glass is left
to solidify undisturbed.
The choice and proportion of raw
materials used in the production of any
quality of optical glass is governed
by the chemical composition which is
necessary to yield the desired optical
properties. The manufacturer .has a
certain amount of choice as to the pre-
cise form in which the various chemical
ingredients are to be introduced into
the mixture, whether as oxides, carbon-
ates, nitrates, or hydrates, according
to the properties that are to be im-
parted to the mass during the earlier
stages of fusion. The state of purity in
which the various substances are com-
mercially obtained also enters largely
into the problem since the greatest
possible degree of purity in the raw
materials is essential to the production
of glass of good color, or rather, free-
dom from color. The extreme import-
ance of purity of raw materials for op-
tical glass is now so fully recognized
that some manufacturers go to the
length of carrying out a special purifi-
cation process on certain of the chemi-
cals, although these have been purchased
as pure.
Generally, the ingredients of optical
glass are obtained in a state of finer
division than necessary for other vari-
eties of glass. Although it is quite
possible to obtain successful meltings
from the raw materials alone, it is pref-
erable to mix with these a certain pro-
portion of cullet or broken glass derived
from a previous melt of the same sort
of glass. The actual operations of pro-
ducing a good melting of optical glass
begins with the glass melting pot.
Melting pots are an integral part in
the production of optical glass, for a
defective pot can contaminate the finest
ingredients or interrupt the most careful

Four weeks ago, on December 17, the
world observed the 41st anniversary of
heavier than air flight. The years since
1903 have been marked by many sig-
nificant developments in man's attempt
to conquer the air. Each January, as
we have looked back upon the preced-
ing year's aeronautical achievements
we have observed the airplane, powered
by a reciprocating gasoline engine, reach
ever higher stages of perfection. But
the developments of 1944 include some-
thing decidedly different from those of
other years, a truly revolutionary
achievement, a propellerless plane.
In January 1944 the United States
War Department and the British Air
Ministry announced simultaneously that
a plane powered by jet propulsion
engine had been flown successfully. The
American public clamored for informa-
tion on this strange craft but it was
not until October that pictures and data
were released. But now the curtain of
secrecy has been lifted—now the story
can be told.
principle of operation
The principle of jet propulsion is, in
reality, very simple, for it is basically

the same as Newton's third law of mo-
tion which states "For every action
there is an equal and opposite reaction."
It may be explained as follows:
Air is picked up by a compressor in
the front of the engine. After being
compressed it passes through a chamber
where fuel and air burn thereby in-
creasing the velocity of the air and
gases. This mixture then sweeps through
a turbine spinning it at a tremendous
speed. The turbine in turn drives the
compressor. After swirling through the
turbine the hot air and gases rush with
a terrific velocity through a funneled
orifice in the rear of the engine. The
reaction of the air and gases furnishes
the thrust which drives the plane for-
ward.
advantages
Rightfully the American public asks,
"Is a jet propelled plane better than
one driven by an ordinary internal com-
bustion engine?" A summing up of the
advantages and disadvantages will allow
the reader to draw his own conclusions.
First let us discuss the new engine's
merits. They are:
Speed—A turbo jet engine will propel
planes faster than any conventional re-
ciprocating engine driving a propeller.
Maneuverability—There is a high de-
gree of maneuverability at super speeds.
Vibration—Here is a distinct ad-
vantage in that the vibration is neglib-
ible, regardless of the speed and power
produced. This eliminates one factor
which causes pilot fatigne.
Quick take-off—No warm up is need-
ed. Thirty seconds after starting the
engine is ready for flight.
High Ceiling—Jet driven planes func-
tion powerfully and smoothly at ex-
tremely high altitudes and use less fuel
under these conditions.
Propellerless—In a conventional air-
plane, especially at high altitudes, the
propeller is plagued by compressibility
due to high tip speeds. This creates a
large drag. The lack of a propeller in
a jet plane makes possible higher speeds
before encountering this phenomenon.
With no danger of propeller blades strik-
ing the ground the jet planes are built

with a low undercarriage. This reduces
the weight of the landing gear tre-
mendously.
Controls—Fewer controls and instru-
ments are required to operate a jet
plane.
Weight per horsepower — Here is
probably the greatest advantage over
the reciprocating engine for the jet en-
gine is much lighter for the same horse-
power. This allows a greater payload
to be carried.
Maintenance—The standard conven-
tional engine is intricate, the jet com-
paratively simple. Thus maintenance is
much simpler on the latter.
Fuel—High test gasoline is not need-
ed. Almost any kind of liquid fuel may
be used.
To offset the above advantages there
is one major disadvantage, that of fuel
consumption. The jet engine requires
considerably more fuel for operation.
However, only about 15% as much oil
is required for lubrication.
history
The story of the development of the
jet propulsion engine is interesting in
that it represents the combined efforts
of two great nations. The original de-
sign was British, being perfected, after
many years of labor, by Flight Com-
mander Frank Whittle, of the Royal Air
Force.
In July of 1941 the General Electric
Corporation was requested to send an
engineer familiar with aviation prob-
lems to England "to investigate a new
and very secret device." No one in G.E.
was informed as to just what this device
was. The assignment was given to

Mary Worsham.
She also hopes to do some graduate work
at some future date. A career woman,
she plans to stay unmarried for a while,
at least.
She entered Michigan in 1941, before
Pearl Harbor, when woman engineers
were much more of a rarity than they
are now. She says this is why she was a
freshman orientation adviser for engi-
neering girls this semester; she didn't
want them to go through the tortures
that she had to bear for a while. On
the other hand, she says that most of the
fellows and profs have been very nice,
which she appreciates very much.
As well as going through school in
eight semesters, Mary finds time to help
out on such things as the Junior Project,
belong to the A.I.Ch.E., be vice presi-
dent of Chi Omega sorority, go out for
sports in the way of house teams, and
take in a bit of social evening life.
Mary believes that the engineering
courses offered here should be liberal-
ized considerably. She advises more and
better courses in Engineering, English
and Economics, as well as introducing
courses in political science and Ameri-
can Literature. She also complains that
personal contact with the faculty is en-
tirely too limited, and wishes that some-
thing could be done about it.
tau bate
Yes, he really exists—a member of
the Engineering Clan who appreciates
the finer things of life! George G. Bin-
der enjoys this distinction, primarily be-
cause he so thoroughly enjoys his all
too-few courses in the Lit. school. In his
opinion, the regular Engineering curricu-
lum falls far short of providing a liberal
education for its students.
Prospective engineers may well model
themselves after George; for despite his
eager participation in almost countless
activities, he has made a real name for
himself in the Engineering World, by
becoming President of Tau Beta Pi, the
Engineering Honor Society. It is ob-
vious that he, by no means neglected his
technical studies; yet he preaches and
practices the doctrine of "squeezing-in"
every available English and Social Stud-
ies course possible. It is his belief that
a student should obtain a well rounded-
out education, even if this entails an
extra year of study. He is a firm ad-
vocate of the five-year Engineering
course.
But don't get the idea that George is
a bookworm. He can be seen at almost
any musical event on campus, for he is
an ardent music lover. The boys living
with him will attest to the fact that he
plays the piano, even to the point of
"driving them mad." Our Mr. Binder
took one of those famous "You Learn To
Play in Less Than a Day the Easy
Way" correspondence courses, and has
mastered the art of applying mathema-
tics to the piano keyboard so that music
is actually produced!
George is very fond of outdoor life,
and especially enjoys ice-skating, tennis,
and golf. He only regrets that he has
so little time to enjoy these sports.
This unique chap came to Ann Arbor
from the University of Toledo in the
fall of 1943. During his two-year stay
at Toledo, George managed to be elected
into the Polymathic Society, which ac-
cepts as members only those who have
attained success in several diversified
fields. One of his numerous sidelines at
that University was to act as laboratory
assistant in the Physics course. His
main reason for changing schools was

that he believed the University of Michi-
gan offered better opportunities to him
as an Engineering student. At any rate,
he is a splendid addition to the Engine
School.
Xot to be overlooked, is the fact that
George is self-supporting. He accom-
plishes this through the assistance of a
student-aid in Chemical Engineering
and by working in the Pendleton Li-
brary.
What spare time George has, is spent
at the Michigan Coop House, the place
he calls home. He is proud of the Coops,
and feels that they offer the same kind
of good fellowship and pleasant environ-
ment as the fraternities on campus.
Moreover, he was House Manager for
two semesters, President for one semes-
ter, and is treasurer and accountant of
the House for the current semester.

A certain V-12 of our acquaintance
was shipped to Great Lakes and subse-
quently to active duty. He was an in-
telligent and concientious fellow and
was soon made a first mate aboard a
P.T. boat.
While in this capacity, he had the
misfortune to be'at sea on New Year's
Eve. Trying to make the best of it,
he nevertheless celebrated the occasion
in time worn fashion. Upon glancing
at the log the next day he perceived the
entry, 'The first mate was drunk last
night."
Our hero was greatly distressed and
pled with the captain to strike it off the
record. He had never been drunk be-
fore, he insisted, would not be drunk
again; was concientious in the perform-
ance of his duty and had been off duty
at the time off the offence, anyway. He
begged for leniency, pointing out what
an unduly detrimental effect on his serv-
ice record such an entry on the log
might have.
The captain remained firm, "You
were drunk last night and I can't change
the fact. The record will stand."
Very indignantly our alumnus re-
sumed his duties. That night it was his
duty to make an entry in the log for
the period of his watch. Keeping in
mind the adage "Honesty is the best,
policy" he wrote the following innocent
but damning statement. "The captain
was sober last night!"

Reports have reached this office
about a particularly ingenious fresh-
man engineer. His tight-fisted papa who
had come up the hard way wanted to
teach his son the value of money and
put him on a ten dollar per month al-
lowance.
But before long reports began to drift
back to he hometown to the effect
that Junior had a date every night, ate
his meals at the Sugar Bowl, and seri-
ously contributed to the local liquor
shortage. Papa hustled over to A.A. to
investigate. "How can you have such
a wild time on the money I give you?"
stormed the angry parent. "Easy pop,"
said Junior. "I make about fifty bucks
a month raffling off your allowance
check!"

One of the more strongly-willed mem-
bers of Ye Staffe was determined to at-
tend his eight o'clock class on the morn-
ing of New Year's day. He stumbled
in at 7:59 A. M. complete with slide
rule and flask, and planting himself in
his seat, he determined to remain awake
at all costs. The hour was drawing to
an end and Morpheus was fast improv-
ing his hold on our hero. The prof,
oblivious of the time or occasion lec-
tured on glibly. Yawning loudly, our
paragon glanced at his watch and to
his amazement beheld its hands in a
position indicative of 9:01. He could
stand it no longer. Getting up with a
start, he gave the prof, that "don't you
know the class is over" look, and start-
ed for the door.
The prof, caught in mid-sentence
jerked out his hourglass and checked the
time; then glaring at the culprit, said,
"According to my watch we still have
five minutes. Isn't that right?" As the
rest of the class nodded in agreement
our hero's scarlet head could be seen
sinking quietly through the floor.
Those cheap time pieces will do it
every time.
Yet another member of Ye Staffe had
a big night New Year's Eve.
This one got home at 7:30 and de-
cided to grab a few winks before going
to his eight o'clock. He too under-
went an unusual and somewhat em-
barrassing experience on this morning
after. Taking it in his stride, however,
he proceeded to draw up his experiences.

tough searchlight
ready for navy
Tough enough to stand the pounding
of heavy waves and the shock of heavy
guns fired close by, a newly developed
searchlight is now ready for duty aboard
Uncle Sam's warships. This new search-
light will be used for signaling between
ships and sending messages to airplanes
and to shore stations when the enemy
might be listening in on radio messages.
The searchlight sends messages by
flashes, and does this by means of vene-
tian-blind shutters operated by hand.
Because of the hard use this searchlight
must go through, a special heat-resisting
glass, ten times stronger than plate
glass, enables the searchlight to resist
sudden changes in temperature and
stand up even under the beating of the
roughest seas. Cold waves lashing
against the lens of the searchlight while
it is hot would instantly shatter ordi-
nary plate glass. To prevent this a
special glass has been developed which
can be quenched in ice cold water and
cooled from a very high temperature
without showing the least bit of strain.
The shutters on this searchlight must
also stand up under severe tests.
gyro-stabilizer
for tank guns
Information has recently been re-
leased regarding a new mechanism which
makes United States tanks far superior
to those of our enemy. This superiority
is due to the fact that our tanks can
fire accurately while racing full speed
over the battlefields, while those with-
out this device cannot. A gyro-stabil-
izer, developed by Westinghouse engi-
neers and now produced in quantities
matching the nation's output of tanks,
increases by several hundred per cent

the shooting accuracy of Army tanks in
motion.
Gyro-stabilizers are used on American
tank guns to minimize the pitching
transmitted from the moving tank to the
gun. At tank speeds of approximately
15 miles an hour over typically rough
cross country terrain, this device make*
possible better than 70 per cent hit*
over a target range of from 300 to 1200
yards, in contrast to the less than 1 per
cent hits scored by even experienced
gunners under similar conditions with-
out the stabilizer.
The basic components of the gyro-
stabilizer system used for tank guns are:
1. The gyro
2. The silverstat regulator
3. The oil pump system including
the electro-magnetically controlled
valves.
4. The piston and cylinder assembly
The gun is mounted on roller bear-
ings at approximately its center of
gravity. Due to its inertia, the gun
tends to maintain its position relative to
the horizontal, however, trunnion fric-
tion, unbalance, and the operations of
the gun crew exert forces which tend to
change this relation. The purpose of
the gyro control is to maintain the tank
gun in its aimed position. Movements
of the tank tending to alter this position
precess the gyro which is attached to the
gun. The gyro, through the silverstat.
varies the current to electromagnetic
valves which in turn control the oil
pressure above and below the piston.
Since the piston is fixed to the gun, its
movement to the low pressure side main-
tains the gun in its aimed position.
The latest development of the tank
gun stabilizer is the mono-gyro control.
Originally the system consisted of two
gyros, one to maintain the position of
the gun relative to the vertical and the
other to maintain its position relative to
the horizontal. It was discovered how-
ever that satisfactory stabilization could
be obtained by only using the velocity
responsive gyro. With the dual system,
'the response of the upper gyro to lateral
accelerations was so pronounced that
firing was accurate only at fairly uni-
form tank velocities. The change to one
gyro had the advantages of greatly re-
ducing the complexity of the mechan-
ism and also minimizing its response to
lateral accelerations. Since the gunner
must continually aim the gun, the slight
drift in the mono-gyro system is un-
important.
The mono-gyro control, consisting
principally of the gyro-motor and the

fiywhed, the dampener be'.lows as-
sembly, and the silverstat control, is
only slightly influenced by an accelera-
tion or sharp turning of the tank. In
order to prevent ''hunting," or oscilla-
tions, the gyro movement is controlled
by an hydraulic dampener. Movement
of the gyro causes a small bellows to de-
flect, forcing oil through a needle valve
into a larger bellows which acts as a
reservoir. This acts to prevent reson-
ance about the vertical precession axis
and also to return the Micarta spacers
to their correct position between the
silverstat leaves. Thus, the gyro has a
gradual and approximate return to the
aimed position.
The gyro motor, operated from the
tank storage battery, is a 12 volt direct
current machine for light tanks or a 24
volt motor for medium tanks, and oper-
ates between 12,500 and 16,000 r.p.m.
The rotor is dynamically balanced be-
fore assembly in the motor, and is
mounted on "frictionless' bearings. At-
tached to a bracket on the motor is a
Micarta spacer which opens and closes
the silverstat contacts as the gyro moves
in its bearings.
The silverstat is a form of rheostat
whose resistance values are varied by
shorting out sections of the resistance
by closing a series of contacts. These
contacts consist of silver buttons fasten-
ed to flexible phosphor bronze leaves
which are kept approximately four thou-
sandths of an inch apart by Micarta
spacers. The leaves connect to taps on
resistors and by making and breaking
silverstat contacts the current flowing
through the coils which regulate the
pump valves can be varied, thereby
changing the compensating force exerted
by the piston.
The means used for stabilizing the
tank gun is limited by several factors,
the most important of which are the size
of the tank and the required speed of
operation. Because the required ac-
celerations are excessive an electric
motor is impractical for this purpose.
The space required for an electric
motor drive capable of developing such
high angular accelerations as is neces-
sary would be too large for the limited
available turret space. A gyroscope to
stabilize the gun by its direct action
would also be too large. For these
reasons a composite hydro-electric sys-
tem is used. This consists of a constant
delivery type pump with the porting ar-
ranged to obtain the effect of two com-
plete pumps, one discharging to the top
and the other to the bottom of the con-

trolling piston. Pressure difference is
controlled by a pair of seated by-pass
valves regulated by the teeter bar arma-
ture of an electromagnetic unit. The
entire assembly, including the magnetic
valve control is immersed in oil. If a
valve is partially closed by a differential
pull of the magnet the pressure in-
creases, forcing oil into the cylinder sup-
plied by that side of the pump. Since
the magnet valve is enclosed within the
pump of the hydraulic system, the op-
eration is free of friction. Furthermore,
since a very small movement of the
valves immediately provides any propor-
tion of the constant flow of oil, the op-
eration of the system is instantaneous
for all practical purposes.
The complete process may be sum-
marized as follows. Any angular dis-
placement of the gun arising from the
tank motion will tend to displace the

tion. When the tank pitches or vibrates:
1. The gyro control is slightly dis-
placed from its former vertical position.
2. The resulting precession of the gyro
makes electrical contacts, shorting re-
sistance through the silverstat.
3. The changed current alters the two
electro-magnets regulating the teeter
valves.
4. The operation of the oil valves de-
creases the pressure on one side of the
hydraulic piston and increases the pres-
sure on the other side.
5. The piston is forced to the low
pressure side.
6. The movement of the gun is con-
trolled accordingly since the piston is
fixed to the gun.
7. There are auxiliary controls of
similar nature to compensate for the re-
coil of the gun and to allow the gunner
to move the gun to aim it.

for perfecting the success of its opera-
tion is admissible: and where, as inci-
dent to such use, the product of its
operation is disposed of by sale, such
profit from its use does not change its
character; but where the use is mainly
for the purpose of trade and profit, and
the experiment is merely incidental to
that, the principal and not the incident
must give character to the use. The
thing implied as excepted out of the pro-
hibition of the statute is a use which
may be properly characterized as sub-
stantially for purposes of experiment."
experimental use must
be proved
Although the grant of a patent is not
accompanied by a guarantee of validity,
it is a general rule that a patent is as-
sumed to be valid until sufficient reason
is shown in court why it should not have
been granted. An infringer, who would
establish that a patent is invalid be-
cause the invention claimed therein was
in use before the permissible period,
must furnish full and convincing proof
of it. If he succeeds in doing so, what
will the court do on the basis of his evi-
dence? The answer was well formulat-
ed in a court decision stating that:
"Instead of laying down a fixed rule,
it seems to us that in each case the
court should direct its attention to the
fundamental inquiry: Under what cir-
cumstances and for what purpose did
the public use or sale take place? And,
where it appears that there was a public
sale or use more than two years before
the application, the burden is thrown
upon the patentee to establish, by full,
clear, and convincing proofs, that such
use or sale was principally and primarily
for experimental purposes, and that such
purposes were not merely incidental or
subsidiary. Whatever expressions may
be found in the opinions of the Supreme
Court to the effect that a single sale
comes within the statutory prohibition,
we think a careful examination of the
cases shows that the primary and gov-
erning consideration is the purpose and
object of the inventor in making such
sale."
The question whether an invention
was in public use or in experimental
use, while depending in the inventor's
intentions, resolves itself into a question
of fact. The inventor's intentions are,
no doubt, often obscure or nebulous,
and his testimony regarding them after
a number of years is, at best, unreliable.
Facts carrying out these intentions,
however, can be proved by witnesses,
and the inventor may then be credited
with whatever intentions are consistent
with his actions. If his acts and his pro-
fessed intentions were not in accord, he
deserves little sympathy and will prob-
ably receive none.
experimental use in public
If an inventor decides beforehand
that the first use of his invention will
be experimental, making his intentions
clear to all persons involved in such
use, and conducts the use as an experi-
ment, that use may extend over a num-
ber of years without invalidating a
patent subsequently applied for. Most
cub patent attorneys cut their legalistic
teeth on one instance of such use, which
is famous for its extreme length and
publicity as well as for the masterly ex-
planations of the law that it occasioned.
The invention in question consists of
a pavement of wooden blocks with wide
joints filled with a mixture of tar and
gravel and laid on a waterproof founda-
tion. Upon being sued, an infringer
pleaded the patent was invalid because
a 75-foot strip of the pavement had been
used by the public for six years before
the patentee filed his application. This
strip was installed in 1848 by the pat-
entee, at his own expense, on a toll road
owned by a corporation of which he was

Evidence of their ability to meet the challenge is

With over 1,000 route-miles of coaxial cable now

treasurer. The patentee made it clear,
from the beginning, that it was experi-
mental, and he inspected its condition
himself almost daily.
In view of these circumstances, the
Supreme Court in 1878 held that there
was no public use of the invention and
that the patent was valid. Thus was
born the paradox of an invention being
used by the public for years without be-
ing in "public use." But, as an experi-
mental use on that scale was unprece-
dented, the Court based its decision on

spring which, at the time of its inven-
tion in 1855, no doubt deserved con-
siderable attention. It was devised to
replace the disconcertingly breakable
single leaf springs then currently in
use and to give to the feminine body
the softly resilient support now more
generally provided for automobile
bodies.
The inventor made some springs and
gave them to his future wife to be used

use by the inventor.
the established rules governing the pub-
lic use of machines of which it is said:
"When the subject of an invention
is a machine, it may be tested and tried
in a building, either with or without
closed doors. In either case, such use is
not a public use, within the meaning of
the statute, so long as the inventor is
engaged, in good faith, in testing its op-
eration. He may see cause to alter it
and improve it or not. His experiments
will reveal the fact whether any and
what alterations may be necessary. If
durability is one of the qualities to be
attained, a long period, perhaps years,
may be necessary to enable the inventor
to discover whether his purpose is
accomplished."
public use in private
Going from one extreme to the other,
the same court, in 1881, declared an-
other patent invalid in a decision which
has set, for generations of patent at-
torneys, the standard of non-permissible
use. This decision also gave us the
second paradox of an invention being
in "public use" merely because it was
used privately by one person other than
the inventor. The invention in litiga-

by her, but without enjoining her to
keep his idea secret. Apparently he did
not have in mind that such use be made
under his direction as a scientific experi-
ment. In 1866, when the inventor ap-
plied for his patent, the springs had
somehow, it is stated, gained general ac-
ceptance by the trade. But the paten-
tee was too late to gather his reward. In
the words of the Supreme Court, the in-
ventor slept on his rights for eleven
years. Like Rip van Winkle, he found
on awakening that what once belonged
to him had passed to others. His patent,
to which he belatedly gave so much at-
tention that he and his wife reissued it
five times, was held invalid. The gen-
eral principles of this holding were laid
down as follows:
"To constitute the public use of a
patent it is not necessary that more
than one of the patented articles should
be publicly used. . . . Whether the use
of an invention is public or private does
not necessarily depend upon the number
of persons to whom its use is known.
If an inventor, having made his device,
gives or sells it to another, to be used
by the donee or vendee, without limita-
tion or restriction, or injunction of se-
crecy, and it is so used, such use is pub-
lic, within the meaning of the statute,
even though the use and knowledge of
the use may be confined to one person.''
public use beyond
knowledge of user
Use beyond the knowledge of the
general public was also fatal to a claim
of a patent on the safe construction
shown in Figure 3. The claim was di-
rected to the tapered bolts used for
fastening together the plates forming the
casing and the door. The patentee made
and sold outright a few of these safes
more than two years before applying for
the patent. The invention embodied in
those safes was held in 1883 to be in
public use for the reasons that:
"The construction and arrangement
and purpose and mode of operation and
use of the bolts in the safe were neces-
sarily known to the workmen who put
them in. They were, it is true, hidden
from view, after the safes were com-
pleted, and it required a destruction of
the safe to bring them into view. But
this was no concealment of them or use
of them in secret. They had no more
concealment than was inseparable from
any legitimate use of them. As to the
use being experimental, it is not shown
that any attempt was made to see if the
plates of the safes could be stripped off,
and thus to prove whether or not the
conical bolts were efficient. The safes
were sold, and apparently no experi-
ment and no experimental use were
thought to be necessary. The idea of
a use for experiment was an after-
thought. An invention of the kind
might be in use, and no burglarious at-
tempt be ever made to enter the safe:
and it might be said that the use of the
invention was always experimental un-
til the burglarious attempt should be
made, and so the use would never be
other than experimental. But it is ap-
parent that there was no experimental
use in this case, either intended or
actual."

public use of process
The litigation involving the so-called
driven well patent distinguished from
the above cases in that the patent was
for a process and in that the patentee
had no participation in the public use
which defeated the patent. The latter
claimed the method of making a well by
driving the well casing into the ground
or by first driving a mandrel which is
then replaced by the casing. This
method had considerable merit, and it
is still standard practice for procuring
drinking water in rural communities.
Both mandrel and casing, shown in Fig-
ure 2, may have been new when the in-
ventor provided them with his process
in 1861, but he did not claim them as
his invention.
Soon after inventing his method he
demonstrated it in public, and within
the next few years wells were driven by
some who either had witnessed his
demonstration or heard of it. Unfortun-
ately, the patentee delayed applying for
his patent until 1866, and in 1887 the
patent was held invalid because the
driving of the wells constituted a public
use of the invention outside of the per-
missible period. The fact that the in-
vention would not be readily apparent
upon inspection of the finished wells
was immaterial since it had been used
by the makers of the wells, who were
members of the public.
public use of material
Likewise a material used in the manu-
facture of articles of commerce is in
public use even if its processing has ren-
dered its composition unrecognizable.
Thus, in 1928, an infringer of a patent
for a rubber composition comprising a
particular type of vulcanization acceler-
ator pleaded that an accelerator of that
type had been used in the manufacture
of rubber tires more than two years be-
fore the patent was applied for in 1914.
The accelerator was destroyed by the
vulcanization process before the tires
were sold to the public, and there was
no way of learning from the finished
tires either their composition or the
process by which they had been made.
Could such use of the material be pub-
lic? The court answered:
"This was the only kind of use pos-
sible and it was public. . . . Once the
invention has been embodied in goods
which are put in public use it becomes
(continued from page 2S)
impossible for a later inventor to secure
a patent."
experimental use disproved
Another invention which had an ele-
ment of inaccessibility was the cable
railway track. The inventor designed
this arrangement in 1876 for a short line
which began operating in 1878, more
than two years before he applied for a
patent. When suing an infringer in
1892, the inventor argued that this in-
stallation was experimental because its
construction was still untried; and,
therefore, he had doubts as to its
permanency. But the circumstances of
this use were not similar to those of the
pavement case previously considered.
The court therefore disagreed with the
inventor, stating that:
"He did not treat it as an experi-
mental thing, but allowed it to be appro-
priated as a complete and perfect inven-
tion, fit to be used practically, and just
as it was, until it should wear out or
until it should demonstrate its own un-
suitableness. He turned it over to the
owners without reserving any future
control over it, and knowing that, ex-
cept as a subordinate, he would not be
permitted to make any changes in it by
way of experiment.''
no experimental use
after unrestricted sale
Equally unsuccessful was the assignee
of a patent for the engine shown in Fig-
ure 4. This engine, operated by hot air,
was similar to some toy engines still sold
today, but of a species apparently other-
wise extinct. It embodied a water
pump discharging through the water
jacket of the engine cylinder. Several
engines were sold outright and installed
in Manhattan by the patentee's assignee
for pumping water into the attic tanks
of residences, a job otherwise incumbent
upon the house coachman. At least one
engine installed in 1887 was frequently
inspected and repaired, sometimes with-
out cost, by the manufacturer. The
engine efficiency however was not guar-
anteed, and there was no agreement to
take it back. After seven years' use it
was traded in as part payment for a
new engine of similar construction. In
an infringement suit, it was argued that
such a set of circumstances was evidence
of experimental use. But the court held
in 1893 that the engine had been in pub-
lic use, stating that:
"If the inventor wishes to keep con-
trol of the machine which embodies his
invention, to secure his own access to it
for examination, and to keep it in the
friendly hands of those who, he intends,
shall aid him by practical experiment,
he must make such restrictions a part
of the contract of sale, and the court
cannot assume them to exist in the ab-
sence of proof."
public use in experimental
system
The carbon brush, which has assumed
considerable importance in the manufac-
ture of electric motors, is also notable
for the peculiar circumstances which led
to invalidation of the basic patent
granted for it. Figure 5 shows one of
the constructions illustrated in the pat-
ent. In 1881 the inventor tried replac-
ing the then current copper brushes by
carbon pieces. Later he devised an
overhead conveying system utilizing a
car running on a cable and propelled by
an electric motor. An experimental
model of this novel system, driven by a
motor provided with carbon brushes
was built in 1885 for the sole purpose
of demonstrating its operativeness. The
inventor did not need to experiment
with the carbon brushes, as he had al-
ready found them satisfactory years be-
fore. The motor simply did its duty
as a motor, and there was nothing ex-
perimental about it. Were then the
brushes in public use? The court deny-
ing the validity of the patent in 1901
found that:
"There is no dispute on the proof as
to what this use was. As to a system
for overhead electrical transportation it
was experimental, but as a use of car-
bon brushes in combination with a seg-
mental commutator on an electric motor
it was a substantial public use .... it
was a practical use of the invention,
since the motor was used occasionally to
propel the car in connection with the
experiments on the cable system, which
the apparatus was intended to embody."
Such was the history of the third
paradox of an invention being in public
use in an experimental system.

operations. The iron of the pot is of
necessity free of silica and other chem-
icals injurious to the melt. The pot
must be capable of withstanding 500-
2000 pounds bulk; resistant to high
and variable temperatures, and sturdy
enough for constant handling with tongs.
The walls must retain such thin liquids
as molten barium crown glass; with-
stand corrosive action; and be chip-
and flake-proof.
European manufacturers once mo-
nopolized the optical glass market by
refusing to reveal their pot-making pro-
cedure. During World War I, coordi-
nated efforts of the Bureau of Standards
and the United States Geological Service
culminated in the discovery of suitable
kaolin and ball clay deposits.
These materials and "grog" (burned
clay scrapped from meltfree fragments
of discarded pots) are the principal in-
gredients in pot manufacture. The
assembled ingredients are mixed with
water and chemicals in a so-called
"Blunger" machine. The resulting semi-
solid mass, referred to as the "slip" is
allowed to flow from the Blunger into
plaster of Paris molds on a lower level.
Within a day, the dry plaster of Paris
absorbs the water and the dense clay
mass shrinks free of the mold. Exposure
to air is increased by the removal of the
mold core. The pot is trimmed and
polished, the rough lips rounded, and
the shoulders encircling the pot sharp-
ened to provide a grip for the lifting
tongs.
The time of fabrication and period
of aging is shorter than that required
for handmade molds. Aging is com-
pleted within ten to twelve weeks.
Throughout this period, time, tempera-
ture, humidity, and air circulation are
controlled. Damp cloths maintain the

moisture balance between sections of
varying thickness, and a gravel bed be-
neath the base eliminates cracking dur-
ing shrinkage.
As the actual operations of produc-
ing a melting of optical glass start, there
is a gradual pre-heating of the pot.
This pre-heating lasts from 72 to 96
hours, and the pot is then placed in the
glass furnaces. When the furnace and
pot have attained the necessary temper-
ature, but before the raw materials are
introduced, a small quantity of the cul-
let is thrown into the pot and allowed
to melt; and then, accurately weighed
amounts of carefully mixed glass in-
gredients, containing more cullet, are
introduced until the pot is full. The
object of this procedure is to coat the
bottom and part of the walls of the pot
with a layer of molten glass which
serves to protect them from physical
and chemical atack by the raw mate-
rials during the violent action which
takes place when they are first exposed
to the furnace heat.
The batch is maintained at the ap-
propriate melting temperature (about
2700° F) until fusion, and the opera-
tions of mixing and fining—the release
of entrapped gases—are completed.

Fig. 5—During transport to casting table,
pot is held by huge tongs.
Fig. 6—Pots must be strong to en-
dure mechanical and thermal strains.
Upon contact, the alkali members of
the batch begin almost immediately to
fuse. There ensues a reaction with sand,
and the alkali silicates form eutectic
liquids at as low as 800 degrees Fahren-
heit in temperature. Lime and other
bases begin to find their complement of
silica and enter solution or perhaps
double silicate formation with the al-
kali silicates. The excess of silica now
begins to dissolve as the melt becomes
hotter and the viscosity lessens. Mean-
while, gases are liberated from the car-
bonates, hydrates, nitrates and sulfates.
The violent agitation of the mass is a
great aid toward attaining a final homo-
geneous mixture. The cullet entering
with the charge has also played its
part in helping to dissolve the less fusi-
ble ingredients.
Complete fusion and solution of the
materials having been effected, there
remains the more difficult and time-
consuming process of plaining, or free-
ing the melt from bubbles. Large bub-
bles rise more rapidly than small ones
because of their greater buoyancy com-
pared with their resistance to move-
ment. Large bubbles, by coalescing
with each other and with smaller ones,
tend to sweep the melt clear. Hence,
it is desirable that the fusion process,
which evolves gases from the raw mate-
rials, should proceed at a rapid rate,
once started. This demands a rapid
transfer of heat to the charge, which
operates to reduce the viscosity of the
melt as it forms, and thus, to acceler-
ate further the escape of the bubbles:
therefore, the recognition by glassmak-
ers of the advantage in working for
rapidity in melting. For, if melts are
made slowly at moderate temperatures,
a stage is reached where the large bub-
bles have escaped; but the glass is still

filled with fine bubbles, or seeds, as
they are called, which go out very slow-
ly in spite of subsequent application of
higher temperatures.
Chemical means for promoting the
plaining of glass include the design of
compositions to reduce viscosity, and
the incorporation of batch ingredients
which will generate gases in relatively
large volume at late stages in the melt.
In the adjusting of composition to se-
cure greater fluidity, due attention must
be paid to the characteristics of the glass
at the working temperature, to its phys-
ical properties in the finished state, and
to its chemical resistance. Borax has
come into favor in recent years because
the presence of as little as one percent
of boric oxide in soda-lime glasses has
a powerful effect on their plaining rate,
and even enhances their desirable prop-
erties.
The molten glass is homogenized by
the stirring action of a clay tube at-
tached to the end of a water cooled rod.
By this means, the previously heated
red-hot clay tube is introduced into the
open mouth of the pot; and when it has
attained approximately the temperature
of the molten glass, it is dipped into the
glass itself. The operation of dipping
the stirrer into the glass is carefully
accomplished in such a manner as to
carry as little air as possible down into
the glass. At best, however, the pores
of the clay stirrer are full of air; and
this must be permitted to escape before
stirring is begun, as otherwise, minute
air bells would be dispersed throughout
the glass during the stirring operation.
For this purpose the stirrer is left im-

mersed on the surface of the glass for
several hours before the actual stirring
is begun; but when the stirring is start-
ed, the clay tube is moved through the
mass of molten glass at a speed or
series of speeds determined by previous
experience.
This operation eliminates striae and
insures the uniformity of composition
requisite in an optical glass.
It was for a long time considered
that the stirring operation should be
conducted by hand by skilled workers
who were supposed to know by the
"feel" of the glass whether they were
moving the stirrer at the right rate for
the condition of the glass at any given
moment. The whole operation, how-
ever, was extremely trying, as the work-
man was exposed to the heat and glare
from the furnace, particularly as he had
to watch the motion of the stirrer in the
glass. In modern practice, the move-
ment of the stirrer is actuated by elec-
trically driven mechanisms.
The stirring and fining procedures
are not standardized, varying with the
composition desired in the product.
Most of the data which was originally
secured by the old trial and error meth-
od is now considered as a vital part of
every glassmakers skill.
The clay rod is withdrawn and the
pot removed from the furnace when the
glass is of proper viscosity. Glass to be
utilized for opthalmic lenses is trans-
ferred to a rolling table, flattened into
lenses, and cooled to room temperature
by passage through a lehr. If it is
scheduled for photographic lenses, ob-
jectives, and prisms, the glass is re-
moved from the furnace and cooled
slowly through the critical range.
This cooling, which takes place in an
insulating drum, promotes the breaking
of glass into chunks from which the pot
can be removed when a suitable tem-
perature is reached. The sizes of these
fragments determine the slab di-
mensions.
The lumps are now ready to be
molded into plates, slabs, or discs, ac-
cording to the purpose for which the
glass may be required by the optician.
The plan used for the molding process
varies widely, but in all cases the oper-
ation consists in gradually heating the
glass in a suitable kiln until it is soft
enough to adapt itself to the shape of
the mold provided for the purpose. In
some cases, these molds are made of
fire clay, and the glass is simply allowed
to settle into them by its own weight
in other cases, iron molds are used; into
these the glass is worked by gentle
pressure from an iron paddle. In addi-
tional cases, particularly where ths
glass is required in the form of small
thin discs, or where it is to be formed
into the approximate shape of concave
or convex lenses, a press is sometimes
used.
In all cases, the molding process i~
followed by a final annealing which
consists in cooling the glass very gradu-
ally from the red heat at which it has
been molded down to room temperature.
The length of time used for such cool-
ing depends upon the size of the object
and also upon the degree of refinement
to which it is necessary to prevent small
strains in the glass. For many purposes
it is sufficient to allow it to cool in a
large kiln for six or eight days. For
special purposes, however, where per-
fect freedom from double refraction is
demanded, much greater refinement is
required. For such purposes, special
annealing kilns, whose temperatures can
be accurately regulated and maintained.
are employed. In these, the annealing
operation can be carried out so gradu-
ally that a temperature fall of one de-
gree Centigrade will require several
hours. As a result perfectly annealed
glass can be produced in discs, slabs, or
blocks of large size.
However slowly this cooling takes
place, it is accomplished as rapidly as
safe practice will permit, the purpose
being to prevent the recrudescence of
striae as a result of convection currents
or other causes which might affect the
homogeneity of the glass.
When the glass has been chilled to a
certain point, this "rapid" rate of cool-
ing must be arrested, as otherwise the
whole contents of the pot would crack

Therefore, the glass is placed into an
annealing kiln and slowly cooled to or-
dinary room temperatures, a process
which normally occupies a period of
from one to two weeks, according to the
size of the melt.
Refractive index and dispersion
measurements indicate the optical char-

polished and viewed from opposite sides
for imperfections. Examination in an
optical instrument reveals minute re-

The raw materials of optical glass
are silica in the form of quartzite sand,
nitrates, carbonates, oxides, fluorides,
and other salts of sodium, potassium,
calcium, borin, lead, barium, zinc, anti-
mony, and aluminum, to name but a
few. By the use of all of these various
chemicals, optical glass is available in
a wide range of refractive indices. Var-
ieties of these are also available over a
suitable range of dispersive power.

ability of the lens designed to provide
combinations of single lenses which will

The success of the glassmakers in
meeting all of the specifications of the

that it is possible in everyday produc-
tion to provide instruments which for-
merly could not be made because of the

decisions which seem to be relatively
free of the apparent or real contradic-
tions often found between court de-
cisions based on different sets of cir-
cumstances. It may be deduced from
them that an invention will not be held
to be in public use if it really requires
experimentation at the time of its being
used and if the inventor makes it clear
that such is his purpose in using it.
With a view to possible future patent-
ing of the im-ention, it is, therefore, ad-
visable to make it of record that an ex-
perimental use is intended even before
such use is begun. Any agreements
that may be necessary should be reached
beforehand with the users of the inven-
tion to insure that it remains under the
full control of the inventor or of his
assignee for experimental purposes. Last
but not least, the use should be actually
conducted as an experiment, and records
made of observations from which the de-
sirability of changes or the suitability of
the structure under test will be apparent.
prompt filing advisable
during experimental use
It is seldom however, that an experi-
mental use of a complete invention
needs to last as long as one year to de-
termine whether the invention will per-
form satisfactorily. In general it will
be possible to file a patent application
on the fully tested invention within one
year from the beginning of experimental
use. If it is desired to subject the in-
vention to a life test under actual op-
erating conditions, or even under ab-
normally adverse conditions, the experi-
ment may extend over a period of
years.
Although application for a patent
may still be delayed until the test L-
completed, nevertheless the inventor
may save himself a considerable amount
of trouble in establishing or asserting
his patent rights by filing his application
within one year from the beginning of
the experiment. Of course, any protec-
tion that he may seek by a patent will
be limited to whatever features of his
invention were in his mind at the time
of filing his application. But if con-
tinuance of the test suggests to him
some valuable improvements, he may
still protect them by other patent
applications.

necessity, as effective as possible. In
other words we needed always to hit the
target and to hit it effectively. By the
end of the last century, this precision
mindedness of America had become
almost an obsession and during the last
war we found we were introducing the
idea of production manufacturing and
replaceability of parts to the maximum
possible extent. It was anything but
easy but we traveled a long way on that
road. Everything we did had to hit the
target and hit it effectively. Whatever
we made had to accomplish something
definite and it must prove that it would
do so.
the revolution in artillery
It was in the first World War that a
tremendous revolution took place in the
realm of artillery. We may define a
piece of artillery as a device for project-
ing a destructive missile against a given
target with a predictable degree of ac-
curacy. The revolution that took place
in the last war was essentially in the
nature of "seeing to it that the destruct-
ive power was delivered at the target."
So much of conventional artillery has
so great a range that it is not possible
to see the target. It is then necessary
to operate by what we call "indirect
fire." But immediate observation of the
effects of the delivery of the destructive
power is always of so great value in
following up with other telling blows
that the idea of carrying the destructive
power right onto the target has always
been an alluring one. Chinese soldiers
have fastened huge quantities of dyna-
mite to their bodies and walked into
barriers and blown them up. It is now
the practice of a certain group of Jap-
anese airmen to crash their planes into
the enemy ships. This is a method of
operation that bespeaks desperation and
is only used as an illustration of the
ideal toward which the revolution was
aiming.
The revolution was to the effect that
artillery had been finally classified into
four groups; the conventional artillery
in the field on wheels or in coastal forti-
fications on concrete foundations or on
battleships; a second classification is a
submersible ship whose projectile is a
submarine torpedo and whose target is
a ship which it sees at the moment of
firing the torpedo; the third is a self-
(continued jrom page 13)
propelled piece of artillery with con-
siderable armor for protection, which we
call a tank; and the fourth is the mod-
ern ideal, the bombing or torpedo plane,
which drops its load of explosive on the
target through the use of unusually in-
tricate sights of the Xorden type or
drops its torpedoes into the water with
such accuracy that many ships (mostly
Japanese) have been destroyed thereby.
Only a beginning was made in the de-
velopment of three of these types of new
^artillery in the other war; that is, the
submarine, the tank, and the airplane.
But between these wars so much was
done that the use of the Stuka dive
bomber and the mass use of tanks by
the Germans in Poland and in the low
countries was terrifying indeed. In
1940-41-42, the use of the undersea
form of artillery against British ship-
ping was so effective that it looked for
a time as though Britain was gone. It
even appeared that the artillery placed
on battleships had become relatively in-
effective and for a while we wondered
if the battleship was any longer a worth-
while investment. But it must be re-
membered that the effectiveness of the
destructive power of the submarine and
the tank and the airplane was largely
because they were direct fire instru-
ments, and the operators were therefore
seeing their targets and could determine
for each round whether they were effect-
ively hitting that target.
essential degree of accuracy
Observing that precision and ac-
curacy have become an American obses-
sion and that if one is to accomplish
his mission in warfare, which is to de-
stroy (1) an enemies' army or (2) his
resources or (3) his transportation facil-
ities or (4) to occupy his territory, one
must hit the target, whatever it may be,
accurately and effectively. The question
is always what must be the achievement
of an instrument in the hands of our
operating services to warrant approval
of the use of money obtained through
the sale of bonds, the efforts of skilled
workmen and manufacturing facilities.
Starting with the conventional artil-
lery of all calibers from 20mm. through
40, 75 and 76, 105, 155 and 210 mm.
and sea artillery from 40 mm. to 16-
inch cannon, we find that we do expect
and demand a very definite and highly
precise degree of accuracy. One of the
most accurate weapons of the other
war, which is used in this one also, was
the 155 mm. French howitzer. It had
a range of about 10,000 yards. The
range tables for that weapon, which by
the way have been checked by the
actual performance of many such
weapons, indicates that the probable
error in direction was one mil. This
technical designation of the probable
error in mils is very convenient because
this is an angle which subtends one unit
at 1,000 units. It is always possible,
therefore, to determine the probable
error at any range. It would be one
foot in 1,000 feet, one yard in 1,000
yards and so the probable error in this
155-mm. French howitzer at 10,000
yards was ten yards or 30 feet. One
may state this error in different fashion
as one-tenth of one percent of the range.
It is safe to take the "probable error"
of the very accurate 155 mm. first
World War howitzer, which is either
equalled or bettered by some cannon of
this war, as the indication of the degree
of accuracy that we must have in the
delivery of destructive power on a
worthwhile target before we would de-
cide to use money and skilled labor and
resources and then issue that device to
our operating services for effective war-
fare. The error must not be in excess
of one-tenth of one percent for a can-
non. If the 16-inch gun. which is
mounted on the most modern battleship
of the New Jersey type, is placed on a
concrete foundation, the degree of ac-
curacy of this weapon will be equal to
that of the howitzer just discussed. At
any given range, the probable error will
not be in excess of one-tenth of one per-
cent. Then if this cannon is placed on
a floating platform of the battleship
type and operated with its platform
having three motions, that is. in the di-
rection in which the ship is steaming, a
pitching motion and a rolling motion, it
is possible for the operators of this can-
non to fire upon a worthwhile target at
20,000 yards range or even greater and
destroy that target. With the effects of
the three motions of the platform, that
is, forward, pitching and rolling, the
probable error is in excess of one-tenth
of one percent. But even so. starting
with the extremely accurate cannon, it
is then worthwhile to spend 75 million

Only the knowledge of how to obtain
them, refine them and fabricate them into
such a vehicle was lacking.
At Alcoa, we call this important ingredi-

the kind of a job that has a special appeal for
young men interested in the future.
It's exciting and exhilarating work to let
your imagination have free reign on the

then engineer it down to earth. So there
is plenty of opportunity in the aluminum
industry for young men with imaginations
that refuse to be limited by traditions.
There is almost no limit to imagineering
with Alcoa Alloys in making things lighter,
more attractive, more economical. All this
adds up to making Alcoa Aluminum avail-

dollars on a floating platform for nine
of these big guns. They have amply
demonstrated what they can do and the
German navy built two very wonderful
ships, the Bismarck and the Tirpitz, and
we have built a series of the Iowa and
New Jersey class; both nations felt that
they were definitely worthwhile even at
this advanced stage of the use of science
in warfare.
the airplane and
the submarine
The degree of accuracy attainable
from the other two pieces of artillery,
the submarine and the airplane, are not
quite so great as for the cannon on
battleships. This is primarily because
the principle of directing the course of
the missile is less effective even though
both operate at ranges not exceeding
five miles. It would be an extraordinary
thing if any naval engagement were
fought at such a close range as five
miles. It could happen, but it seldom
does. But with the airplane, the B-17,
B-24, or B-29, operating at an elevation
of 25,000 feet, it is possible to drop one
and two thousand pound bombs on a
target, which may be a factory, a rail-
way yard, a harbor, a bridge, or any
other worthwhile target with a probable
error no greater than five mils. It is
necessary to use a sight of the precise
character of the Norden sight to ac-
complish this, but it is accomplished so
consistently that whenever visibility
permits we are sending out our B-17's,
24's, and 29's, to operate at the maxi-
mum practical height and they are defi-
nitely destroying targets. At 25,000
feet, a probable error of five mils would
mean 125 feet. That would mean then,
that if the rectangle of the campus were
the target and represented vital airplane
or other war production factories, none
of the bombs would miss the target. It
would make almost no difference, there-
fore, what the carrying device for these
bombs would cost. They would still be
regarded as worthwhile, because they
would permit the accomplishment of one
of the aims of warfare, that is, the de-
struction of vitally needed manufactur-
ing resources. A B-17 and B-24 cost
between four and five hundred thousand
dollars each when we first began to con-
struct them. We have not been told
what a B-29 costs, but it is probably
(continued from page 38)
much in excess of that. But because of
that very practical accomplishment of
dropping a 1,000 or 2,000 or even 4,000
pound bomb on a target with a probable
error not in excess of 125 feet for an
elevation of 25,000 feet, we regard the
expenditure as worthwhile and have
constructed the Willow Run Bomber
Plant and many more similar to that all
over the United States. That form of
artillery is never going out of use. It
has demonstrated its value in terms of
the accuracy and the destructive power
of its performance.
The writer cannot speak as positively
concerning the accuracy of the sub-
marine as about the cannon and the air-
plane. A modern torpedo however, has
a range of several miles. The stabiliz-
ing gyroscopic mechanism, which keeps
it on its course and at the proper depth,
have been so far developed that a tor-
pedo will remain almost perfectly on its
course for several miles. It seems safe
to say that at the maximum range of
the torpedo, the probable error would
not be in excess of ten mils and in all
probability is not in excess of five. If
the probable error is five mils and the
range is as extreme as four miles, the
probable error would then be approxi-
mately 100 feet. This makes it profit-
able to operate against any ship much in
excess of 300 feet in length. A light
cruiser, a battleship, aircraft carrier are
easy targets even if the error were as
much as ten mils and the range again
the extreme of four miles which it is not
likely to be. At two miles which is
more probable as a working range, the
error for five mils would be 50 feet and
for ten mils, 100 feet. It is thus prac-
tical and a common practice for all na-
tions to build submaries and with these
devices the Germans almost destroyed
Britain.
summary of artillery
To summarize the observation we
have already made with reference to the
fundamental purposes in warfare and
the devices which all nations build to
accomplish those purposes, we find that
American colonists went a long way to
winning the Revolutionary War with a
hand gun, a muzzle loading rifle com-
monly referred to either as a Lancaster
rifle or a Kentucky rifle, whose prob-
able error was not greater than five mils.
The famous 75 mm. gun was well nigh
worth its weight in gold because its
probable error was not in excess of one
mil. A whole series of first World War
cannon as well as American seacoast
cannon were built at fabulous cost and
used with high destructive effect be-
cause their error was not in excess of
one mil. We put the same device on our
armored vehicles in order that it may
go over into the territory of the enemy
and fire at his pillboxes, and similar de-
vices over open sights because those
cannon likewise have an error not in ex-
cess of one mil. Those tanks may cost
$50,000 each. Germany has relied
heavily on five to ten million dollar
submarines and we Americans have ac-
complished tremendous destruction of
Japanese shipping with our submarines,
costing approximately ten million dol-
lars because the error of their torpedoes
is not in excess of five mils. We have
spent as much as 500,000 dollars on a
B-17 or B-24 and perhaps as much as
a million on a B-29, because the bom-
bardiers on these planes, using Norden
bomb sights, can drop one and two ton
bombs on worthwhile targets from an
elevation as high as 25,000 feet, with a
probable error of five mils or 125 feet.
A nation with an ample supply of all
of these devices, that is, the present
Garand rifle, with a probable error not
as great as one mil, cannon on field car-
riages, on ships, on tanks, on tank
chassis as antitank destroyers, all hav-
ing an error not in excess of one mil.
submarines with an error for the tor-
pedo not in excess of five mils and the
bombing plane again with an error not
in excess of five mils has little if any
need for freak V weapons. To repeat,
a nation having an ample supply of all
of these, with facilities for their repair
and expert men to use them, is as well
off as a nation can be in warfare. And
for emphasis again, each and every one
of these devices has been built at a tre-
mendous cost and in tremendous quan-
tities for the simple reason that they
have demonstrated thoroughly what
they will do toward the winning of
a war.

floating cold storage warehouses, held at a tempera-
ture of 15°F., are a major factor in the fighting
efficiency of our Armed Forces.
Here is what an official of United Fruit, the op-

the exacting requirements of the quick turnaround
that is one of the major demands made in the re-
frigerated trade . . . there has been no instance in

Yet York equipment serving in our fleet of refrig-
erated ships is but a part of the total refrigeration
tonnage necessary for the maintenance of our Armed
Forces. Self-contained refrigerating units on landing
craft, in trucks and on trailers bring fresh rations
from beachhead to battle zone.
On ship and on shore York equipment is serving
with our Armed Forces. In many cases requirements
have called for new and superior techniques. Wartime
developments will be reflected in ma-
terially improved air conditioning and

several different ways. The British air
service has done extensive bombing from
their Lancaster bombers, which are
lightly armed and armored and in the
main, they have operated at night against
dimly illuminated targets or against un-
seen targets from above the clouds.
Gradually their technique has been
modified to include smaller planes,
which search out the target below the
clouds and at such elevations at which
they can probably identify them and
dump loads of incendiaries on them.
The Lancaster bombers then merely
drop their bombs on the regions illumi-
nated by the fires started by the incendi-
aries. Blind bombing by the Germans
has been principally through their V-l
or jet-propelled aero bomb, and their
more recent V-2 rocket propelled strato-
sphere bomb.
Those who have reported the tre-
mendous bombings by British Lancaster
bombers very soon found themselves
running out of superlative adjectives in
describing such raids. A raid over such
and such target involved the dropping
of the "greatest load of explosive ever
dropped on any target in history." This
type of expression has become so com-
mon that few people listen to it any-
more. Quite soon it must have been
evident to those who were broadcasting
these announcements that in spite of
these "greatest loads in history," the
target, whatever it might have been,
kept on making airplane parts, cannon,
tanks and synthetic gasoline. All of us
wondered when the bombing of Berlin
would reach a saturation point. The fact
seems to be that after the most terrific
bombing that any city has ever taken,
it is still operating. The German war
effort apparently is still being directed
from Berlin and the industries around
the city are still producing munitions
of war.
Lancaster bombers were sent out
against various targets in France. Re-
cently a friend who flew from Nor-
mandy to the LeBourget airfield, north-
east of Paris, had this to say from his
observation of what he could see on the
way. "From the air very little de-
struction could be seen. However, it
was easy to pick out places where the
Germans had made stands as these
places were pock-marked with shell and
bomb craters lip to lip. Such areas
were simply wiped out. The accuracy
of fire was great as the craters would all
be in a very small area with very few in
the surrounding fields. Bridges would
be taken out with three or four shots."
(It should be noted that this was done
by shelling and bombing with a prob-
able error in shelling not in excess of one
mil and bombing with an error not in
excess of five). To continue the report
this observer says, "Over Paris it was
easy to see which railroad yards had
been raided by precision bombers and
which by blind bombers. Those which
the blind bombers had visited were all
chopped up and there were craters for
three or four miles around, while those
which the precision bombers had struck
were equally knocked out, but all the
damage was in the yards." This con-
trast between blind and precise bombing
raises a very nice question. If one
2,000-pound bomb in the right place will
destroy the target and five in the wrong
place will not destroy it, what is the
answer? Well, it seems certain that we
Americans will not engage in blind
bombing. We believe in precision, in
accuracy, and in hitting the target. This
interesting obsession is more than ap-
parent in every American factory. We
have come to the use of machine tools,
each machine being designed to do just
one operation, or perform one function
and it cannot be used for anything else.
It is interesting then to study the pic-
tures one sees of shops in Russia, in
Germany and in Britain. One finds
long lines of benches with workmen fil-
ing at parts for the purpose of fitting
them into their places. In Russian fac-
tories one sees men carrying parts
around to various places rather than
having the parts come on conveyors to
the place where they are to be as-
sembled. This is the contrast between
blind production and precision produc-
tion.
In the first World War, which was
characterized by four years of stale-
mate warfare along a line stretching
from the Swiss Alps to the North Sea,
the tendency was to develop devices
that would throw over great weights of
explosive into the probable area occu-
pied by the enemy. There was no pre-
cise means of observing where the
trenches were from the ground and
bombing planes had been very poorly
developed at the time, so there was a
strong tendency toward blind bombing.
The German army had developed in ad-
vance of the beginning of that war in
1914 a small mortar which they called
a "minenwerfer" or mine thrower. Ap-
parently they had little use of them
early in the war, because of course they
were primarily for position warfare
rather than warfare of motion. It is
said that British soldiers very early in
the position warfare period in Flanders
began to develop crude mortars out of
shell cases. This lead to the develop-
ment in the British Army of what was
known as the Stokes mortar, which was
a smooth tube about four and one-half
feet long attached to a timber platform
and firing a steel mortar case with fins
attached to the base. The range could
be controlled by the elevation of the
tube but more generally by the amount
of powder used.
In the first three years of the war this
'trench artillery' as it became known,
was developed to such an elaborate ex-
tent that the writer found on the Italian
front mortars so large that very heavy
winches were required to lift the mortar
bombs and to load the mortar. The
French army developed 340 mm. or
13'/^ inch trench mortars which were
very elaborately emplaced and served
from a narrow gauge railway, leading
from their ammunition storage to the
various batteries of mortars. The
American service made use of the Stokes
mortar in 1918, although not by any
means to so great an extent as the
British army.
The writer has before him numerous
handbooks of trench artillery compiled
by the French, German and Italian
armies. There were similar handbooks
for the Stokes mortars for the British
and American armies. The British and
American armies did not develop trench
artillery by any means so elaborately as
the other three. At the end of the war
the writer, in gathering up captured ar-
tillery, found great quantities of Ger-
man trench artillery from 77 to 210 mm.
Most of them had recoil mechanism and
were mounted on wheels for transporta-
tion. Most of them were crudely rifled
and therefore were more accurate than
the smooth bore tubes.

vital to you than Food and Water?
Men have lived forty days without
food—perhaps even longer. They have
gone several days without water — and
lived. But without sufficient oxygen, life
is snuffed out in a matter of minutes.
Normally, a person obtains plenty of
oxygen bv breathing air. But following
bomb blasts, shock from battle wounds,
heart attacks,during severecasesof pneu-
monia, and after major operations, addi-
tional quantities of oxygen may be pre-
scribed. The treatment is known as oxy-
gen therapy.
The breathing of extra oxygen also is
required by all flyers in the rarefied at-
mosphere of high altitudes. The study
of this use is contributing important data
to that which the medical profession's
continuing research has made available
on the clinical use of oxygen.
The Linde Air Products Company,
a Unit of UCC, is devoted to the pro-
duction of oxygen. Every cylinder of
Linde Oxygen, even Linde Oxygen for
industry, conforms to the purity stand-
ards of the United States Pharmacopoeia
— and is therefore suitable for human
consumption.
Oxygen therapy, once used as a last resort,
is now routine early treatment. It should be
welcomed by patient and family as an oxy-
gen mask is welcomed by a flyer.
Civilian and military physicians and
nurses and others are invited to send for

which describes generally the types of
equipment with which oxygen is adminis-
tered.

The important point in connection
with the blind bombing from trench
mortars is that it was given a thorough
trial in that war by all armies and was
then discarded by all armies. The use
of small mortars, the 60 and 81 mm. in
the American army, with greatly im-
proved mortar shells or bombs at the
present time and for specific purposes, is
not an indication in any sense that the
trench mortar artillery of the first
World War was a success. The fact
that led to the discarding of this artil-
lery was its lack of accuracy. In gen-
eral, it was found that the probable
error of this trench artillery was ap-
proximately ten per cent of the range.
The probable error at 1,000 yards would
be 100 yards. This is 100 mils as com-
pared with the maximum of five mils
that we have already indicated for the
submarine and the airplane. The result
was that it was necessary to shoot a
tremendous amount of ammunition to
have the desired effect. This practice of
using the equivalent of shrapnel or a
shotgun charge to demolish a target be-
cause of lack of accuracy of the weap-
ons received very little sympathy, and
no army spent very much time in de-
veloping any such devices between the
two wars. All armies are now using
small mortars firing steel fragmentation-
case mortar shells or bombs; and like-
wise, all armies are using some varieties
of self-propelled or rocket type pro-
jectiles, launched from tubes on landing
boats, carried by hand by a soldier or
on vehicles. All of these rocket-pro-
jectiles are but thin metal cases con-
taining high explosive and the effect is
obtained from the force of the explosion.
A point that should be made in connec-
tion with both the mortars and the
rockets is that the ranges are short and
in the case of the rockets, the target is
always visible. The American army has
found it profitable to make from three
to six-inch diameter rockets for use at
ranges not much above 500 yards. At
these ranges the so-called "Bazooka"
will demolish a pillbox, will seriously
damage or destroy a tank, and the larger
rockets launched from tubes on the
wings of airplanes will destroy tanks,
seriously damage the decks of ships, and
clear out strong points and entangle-
ments on the shore in the event of an
amphibious landing. But be it remem-
bered, the ranges are not much more
(continued from page 42)
than one-third of a mile. At these
ranges, the probable error is at least ten
mils. Even so, the probable hits and
the probable damage are both such that
they are profitable.
German V-l jet-propelled
bombs
The German V-l self-propelled bomb
is admittedly a very clever weapon. The
propulsion engine is particularly out-
standing. The equipment contained in
the body of the bomb or plane to stabil-
ize it as to elevation and direction is
skillfully designed and effective in op-
eration. The arrangements to shut off
the fuel and send the bomb into a nose-
dive after a certain number of seconds
of flight are likewise resourceful. In
almost every respect it is an ingenious
instrument. But from the standpoint of
accomplishing any of the necessary ob-
jectives of warfare: to destroy soldiers,
factories, harbors, transportation, cities,
or to assist in the occupation of a coun-
try, it certainly has not succeeded. It
was used at a range of approximately
100 miles, the distance from the region
of Calais to London. We shall have to
wait a long time to determine the pat-
tern of hits of these projectiles. But the
various armies have overrun the various
areas from which these were launched
and know how crude were the launching
devices. There seems little likelihood,
likewise, that the launching devices
could ever be improved very greatly. It
seems likely that there was a probable
error of several degrees in the takeoff of
the bomb. It seems, likewise, from the
observed performance of them that they
could not be so perfectly guided on the
way, and that the probable error or
deviation in the direction in the hundred
miles was considerably over ten miles or
far beyond the ten percent that was
commonly accepted in the other war for
trench mortar fire. This would raise
the question then as to exactly what the
purpose of these bombs might have
been. A factory, railway yard, bridge,
or harbor could be hit only by the
merest of chances; never by design. It
must be realized by those who know the
densely populated condition of Britain
that it would be impossible to fire such
a projectile into southern Britain with-
out probably injuring someone and dam-
aging houses. It might, therefore, be
classified as a vengeance weapon or as
a morale destroying weapon. And surely
we have learned by this time that we
cannot destroy morale by that kind of
destruction or by frightfulness. We have
finally learned something that we did
not know before; that the German
people will not surrender even when we
have nearly destroyed their capital and
a great many of their large cities. They
continue to fight effectively and with no
sign yet of cracking, even when we in-
vade their homeland and destroy com-
pletely their fine cities. Blind bombing
with V-l types of bombs does not seem
profitable no matter how it may be con-
sidered.
V-2 rocket bombs
The V-2 rocket projectile is more
spectacular than the V-l. As one ex-
amines history of long ago, he finds so
many times the expression "the rattle
of the musketry was deafening and the
roar of the artillery was terrifying." But
at Waterloo, as we have already said, it
took 4S0 English bullets to hit one
Frenchman; so that the terrifying rattle
of the musketry had no real effect after
the men got used to it. And so with
respect to these spectacular V-2 rockets,
which are again most ingenious, if we
may accept the diagrams that are now-
coming to us from Britain, seem to have
no place in the effective prosecution of
war. Possibly they can be made to
travel greater distances than they have
already traveled. But no matter how
large they may be made nor how elab-
orate they may be in their design, there
seems no possibility whatsoever that the
probable error of this projectile or bomb
can ever be made as low as even ten
percent. We shall surely find that the
probable error of the V-l was in excess
of ten percent.
The answer to the question as to
whether we are preparing to bomb Ger-
many and Japan with V-l and V-2 de-
vices would seem to depend upon a deci-
sion as to whether we see any profit in
blind, terror bombing. Can blind bomb-
ing or terror bombing shorten the war?
We have no production facilities at the
present that we can afford to use on
other than proven effective devices. Let
us hope that we do not blunder in favor
of the merely spectacular. Illustrations
of V-l jet engines and the statements in
The Sunday Free Press for January 7
may indicate that we are doing just that.

D. R. Shoults who was the first Ameri-
can to see the British plane. Upon his
return to this country he was not al-
lowed to reveal any information to his
employer until he had discussed the
matter with the Army Air Forces in
Washington.
A short time later some of the G.E.
officials were called to General Arnold's
office for a meeting with General Arnold,
General Spaatz, Colonel Irvine, and
Assistant Secretary of War Lovett. Gen-
eral Arnold emphasized that it was of
the greatest importance that no one
learn that work on jet propulsion was
being undertaken in this country. He
then went to his safe, took out a pack-
age which had recently been flown in
from England and the first drawings of
the British jet propulsion engine were
revealed in this country.
Throughout the development of the
engine secrecy prevailed. An old build-
ing was procured and guards posted day
and night. Every person who worked
on the engine was carefully checked,
even his home life investigated. British
engineers came to this country to aid
with the development, but their pres-
ence was carefully guarded.
Bell Aircraft was selected to build
the first jet propelled fighter. A few
trusted employees were investigated and
sworn to secrecy under the penalty of
death. These men were moved to a new
factory where the Airacomet was born.
After months of labor the first plane
was completed and shipped to the army
testing grounds at Muroc, California.
During October, 1942, the P-S9 (other-
wise known as the Airacomet) under-
took her first flight with Bob Stanley at
the controls. On the first day flights
were made to 25, 4,000, and 10,000 feet.
The results and statistics of these flights
are of course, a military secret.
future of jet propulsion
The General Electric Corporation has
obtained a new plant for the sole pur-
pose of manufacturing jet propulsion
engines. Bell Aircraft is swinging the
Airacomet into production. In a short
period of time these new fighters will be
on the battle fronts. It is predicted that
the jet propelled plane will prove to be
an invaluable addition to our air
strength.
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(continued from page 21)
The stabilizer not only satisfied field
conditions but surpassed original re-
quirements by almost 3 to 1. The Ord-
nance Department had requested that
disturbances of ±2-Y2° at 1% cycles
per second for the tank, (typical fluctu-
ations over average rough terrain)
should be reduced to ±l/s° error at the
gun. The stabilizer as developed re-
duced these disturbances to less than
±V&amp;° gun error instead of the ±^S°
as required.
Credit for the invention of this de-
vice is due to Mr. Clinton R. Hanna,
research engineer for the Westinghouse
Electric and Manufacturing Company.
He believes that the benefits of the gyro-
stabilizer will not cease when the war is
won. He has ideas about applying the
principle to many peace-time jobs. The
same principles that enable American
tanks to fire on the run with deadly
effect promises to provide "floating"'
rides in high speed trains and other
vehicles. Calculations show, for ex-
ample, that only three horsepower are
needed to stabilize the vertical move-
ment of a railway coach. Since stabil-
izer power and size vary as the mass
and the square of the fluctuations, an
automobile and a railroad car would re-
quire units of about the same size since
an automobile although lighter in
weight, vibrates more excessively. The
railway and automotive fields are merely
typical of possible applications of the &gt;.
general principles of the stabilizer; such
principles are applicable wherever sta-
bility is required in a member of a body
in motion.

improvement for trolley
coaches
The trolley coach, youngest of all city
transit vehicles and the one growing
most rapidly in popularity, is undergo-
ing many improvements in its control
and drive. A new control gives better
performance as viewed either by the
rider or operator. Heretofore the coach
operator, in the front of the vehicle,
controlled the master switch, accelera-
tor, and reverser, which are in the back
of the coach, by three long mechanical
linkages. Because these are subject to
wear, the new controls are operated
electrically. Cam switches replace the
more complex and less positive inter-
locked sequence switches. Trolley-coach
motors have previously been self-venti-
lated by a fan on the shaft. Because
the speed of the motor fan varies from
zero to high speed, the motor receives
no cooling effect at standstill, only a lit-
tle while the coach is pulling slowly up
a heavy grade, and more than necessary
at high speed. The new trolley coach
has a separate motor-driven fan which
blows a draft of air first through the
motor, then across the resistors, and, in
winter, into the coach for heating.
recording vibration
on location
Engineers have aimed directly at the
requirement for a quick simple means of
recording vibration on the spot, and
the result is a "little black box-' called
the Vibrograph. In the past the prob-
lem of recording the vibrations in some
remote corners of a plant or in buildings
far removed from laboratory facilities
was difficult to solve. Although portable
vibration recorders were available, most
were large and heavy, and required an
external source of power. This device
writes a permanent record of vibration
over the range of 600 to 15,000 cycles
per minute and amplitudes as low as
one ten thousandth of an inch or as
great as one-sixteenth of an inch. The

record and a timing wave are drawn by
a stylus on a transparent plastic tape
only one inch wide, and are viewed by a
low-power microscope. The Vibrograph
is a purely mechanical device and
achieves mechanical amplifications of
about eight, using the same principles
by which earthquakes are recorded.
This mechanism makes its mark on the
tape either when sitting on the vibrat-
ing body or when held in the hand with
the vibration being picked up by a
prod.
rocket fuel inspected by x-rays
Rocket fuel is extruded in solid form.
Any voids in the fuel may cause faulty
operation of the rocket sticks. X-ray
sets have been developed to discover
these flaws. There is nothing unusual
about the X-ray as it is a standard
220-kv factory inspection-type set, but
the hazardous nature of the product re-
quires that they be provided with a
special enclosure. This is a lead-lined
chamber equipped with a sensitive tem-
perature indicator and photoelectric
tube that turns on a veritable flood of
water from nozzles should a jet stick
start to burn. The operator positions
about the X-ray chambers were chosen

The 3500 shp turbine, generator and

plant of a transport, can now be lowered

plete, even to the lubricating system,
pumps, and piping. Only connections
to the steam and water line and electri-
cal connections need be made. These
new ships are twin screw, each shaft be-
ing turned by a 3300-hp slow speed syn-
chronous motor and supplied with en-
ergy by one of the "package" power
plants. The excitation for the genera-
tors, instead of being governed by the
usual type of regulator, is under the
control of a rotating regulator of the
Rototrol type. This permits smaller
normal excitation power (and excita-
tion equipment) but provides a rapid
boosting of excitation in emergencies, as
during the increases in load that may
appear in shallow water or in heavy
storms. This system provides an auto-
matic control of stability.
a billion stresses in a hurry
Impatient with endurance test meth-
ods that require five or six years, engi-
neers have devised test machines to
check in a short time the new high
temperature alloys used in steam tur-
bines, jet propulsion units, and other
high temperature machines. At room
temperature, the story of endurance of
a metal is usually told in ten million
cycles of stress. But at elevated temper-
lures, the curve of waning endurance
continues downward for several hundred
million cycles. It takes years to stress
an alloy held at 1500 degrees F. a
quarter of a billion times by ordinary
means. The special machines can do
this job in a month. The test piece is
clamped in a furnace that maintains
the desired temperature. One hundred
twenty times a second, a stress is ap-
plied through the clamping structure by
two stator coils connected to a two-
phase 60-cycle supply line. The entire
system is mechanically tuned to reso-
nance at this frequency to minimize the
driving force necessary. This tuning
also serves another important purpose.
Research engineers want to see the
specimen after the first tiny crack
appears, not after the complete failure
of the sample. With this device, the
first crack reduces the stiffness of the
system which detunes the mechanism to
such an extent that the machine auto-
matically stops. A sample can be placed
in the tester, heated to the desired tem-
perature, and tested continuously for
weeks or months without attention.
When failure begins, the test stops itself
instead of continuing until important
evidence of the mechanism of failure is
destroyed. Tests of high-temperature
alloys up to a billion applications of
stress have been made in 100 days.
an absolute altimeter
An absolute altimeter in mass pro-
duction and in successful use, now tells
the pilot how high his plane is above a
mountainside or other unseen obstacle
at night, during fog, or in storms. This
new altimeter, based on radio principles,
is a development of engineers of several
organizations, including RCA and the
Navy. It is a highly accurate d-c milli-
ammeter of the circular-scale type and
is fully temperature-compensated to
operate from minus 67 to plus 18 de-
grees F. Over the normal range of
temperature, the accuracy is within one
per cent. The instrument has two scales.

lected by turning an external switch.
Only one scale shows at a time behind
the windows in the dial face, thus elim-
inating any possibility of error by the
pilot's reading the wrong scale. The in-
strument, necessarily made as light as
possible because of its use in planes,
also combines the master control switch
for the entire absolute-altimeter system.
Unlike previous altimeters, which gave
only an indication of altitude above sea
level, the absolute altimeter provides in-
formation as to the distance to the near-
est solid object. Furthermore, for dis-
tances within the all-important region
of 10 to 400 feet, this indication is ac-
curate to within 5 feet of the actual dis-
tance. The radio system and the in-
strument are so accurate that they have
enabled many a pilot to land his plane
on a runway he could not see.
turbine blades are ready
for tomorrow's loads
When the need arises for stronger im-
pulse blades for high-pressure steam
turbines, designers will be ready. From
the laboratory, complete with life tests,
has come a new blade construction able
to withstand duty much greater than
present blades. In fact, to determine
the strength limits of the new, pinned
blade, a stronger test machine had first

addition to its great strength, has other
attractions. Any segment of three blades
can be removed directly without dis-
turbing any other segment. For the

shutter which makes it much faster than
if it had to be turned on or off. The

lamp has louvers for ventilation, yet
they are arranged so that absolutely no
light is able to leak out. The great light
efficiency comes from the use of lamps
of the sealed-beam type originally de-
veloped for automobiles. Because the
reflector is inside the lamp, dulling of
reflector surface by corrosion is no prob-
lem. Any of three types of lamps can
be used without alteration of unit or
wiring. These are 300 watt, 115 volt;
150 watt. 24 volt; and 100 watt, 12
volt. Hence the searchlight can be used
on almost any kind of power supply,
which in this class of service is usually
limited in amount.
electroplating of metals
Two holdouts among metals defying
electroplating, one of the most useful of
engineering tools, have at last capitu-
lated to engineers. Beryllium and tanta-
lum do not respond to usual electro-
plating techniques. Methods have been
found for plating beryllium and tanta-
lum from fused salt baths. Tantalum-
plated anodes in vacuum tubes offer
possibilities of low secondary emission,
and as an absorber (getter) of stray
gases.

A new electronic attendant has been
developed for your postwar garage. As

tells the WHY of Ball Bearings
There is a simple, fundamental truth in the principle of the
ball bearing: "Nothing Rolls Like a Ball!"
The ball possesses inherent advantages unequalled by any
other rolling body. There are no ends to a ball—so its axis of
rotation need never be artificially fixed.
Thus, a Ball bearing bears the loads on a circle of free rolling
stcd balls, reducing friction and wear, maintaining precise lo-
cation of parts and cutting maintenance time—as does no other
type bearing.
That is why over 300 million New Departure Ball Bearings
are at work in this war. That is why designers of peace-lime
machinery are designing more ball bearings into their machin-
ery than ever before.
There is really no substitute for the ball bearing — nor any
substitute for the technical experience and creative engineering
that go into New Departure Ball Bearings.

On East University, set well back
from the road, stands an unimpressive,
well-weathered brick building that is
rich in the traditions of the Michigan
Engineer. Although much could be said
of a derogatory nature concerning the
physical features of East Hall, the ma-
jor offense for which it lives in infamy
in the heart of the average engineering
student is the fact that within its se-
date walls is housed the Department of
English in its entirety. Due to this un-
happy fact the modest structure has un-
doubtedly been responsible for more
writhing and squirming per cubic foot
(287,000) than any other building of
the College of Engineering.
The methods by which the student
gives vent to his wrath are many and
varied. For example, one of the most
common of speeches which occur in
English II is one in which East Hall is
denounced in no uncertain terms. After
some investigation your reporter has as-
sembled a complete dossier concerning
the iniquities of East Hall, the most se-
lect of which appear below.
This nemesis of the Michigan engi-
neer came into existence in the year
1883. Its first 39 years were spent in
comparative tranquility due to the fact
that it functioned as a part of the pub-
lic school system of Ann Arbor. During
this period it was known as the Tappan
School. Eventually, as he must to all
buildings, the fire marshal came to East
Hall. After inspecting the structure
carefully, this benefactor of mankind
was quoted as making the following ob-
servation. "Give me one handful of ex-
celsior, one match, and five minutes,
and I will produce such a conflagration

here that no fire department this side of
Detroit could touch it." And so it was
that East Hall graduated from the ranks
of the grammar schools into the realm of
higher education, passing under this
cloud into the hands of our alma mater
for the tidy sum of $14,300.
Under no circumstances should it be
assumed that we are unaware of the
many striking features of this structure
which render it distinct if not superior
to other buildings on the campus. The
square tower of the Michigan Union is
obviously modeled from the graceful
lines of East Hall. With due respect to
architect Kahn, we feel that our vener-
able relic contrasts favorably to the
Lit school mausoleum known as Angell
Hall. In fact, these two buildings may
have acquired some of the characteris-
tics of their inhabitants. East Hall is
not all front as is the L S &amp; A club-
house. Furthermore, consider what lies
in back of Angell Hall.
East Hall has been described as one
of the most intricate buildings on the
campus, its architecture is one of the
foremost examples of the labyrinthian
style in existence. When one desires to
commute from the north side of the sec-
ond floor to the south it is necessary to
make preparations for an extended
journey. The only building in existence
which ranks with East Hall in this re-
spect is the Pentagon in Washington.
It would take a number of engineers to
explain or justify this aspect of the
building.
The year 1944 saw a new milestone in
the career of East Hall. Some enthusias-
tic individual at last had succumbed to
an urge which had no doubt been experi-
enced by many another whose destiny
had been blighted by our inanimate
hero. The results of his clandestine ac-
tivity created a mild sensation among all
who passed -the scene of his crime. This
was due to the fact that he had replaced
an "A" with an "E" in the most ap-
propriate if not the most painful place

possible. Thus it was brought into the
open, a condemned building for the con-
demned subjects. When the offender
was brought to justice his punishment
was merely a $10 fine to replace the sign
and a hearty slap on the back.

ENGINEERS
by
IVAN C. CRAWFORD
Dean of the College of Engineering
Even in the midst of a great war, a
war which is far from being won, some
thought must be given to the "form of
things to come." Just as planning for
re-conversion in industry is a most im-
portant activity toward the close of the
war, so, as we draw nearer to the end
of the conflict, engineering education in-
tensively scans its past performance and
plans for the future in the light of its
accomplishments and the probable con-
ditions which are ahead.
Some Recent History
During (he past three years the prob-
lems facing engineering colleges have
multiplied with confusing rapidity. Be-
ginning in the summer of 1941 the Fed-
eral Government provided funds for the
support of what has become known as
the Engineering, Science, and Manage-
ment War Training Program in order
that throughout the nation large num-
bers of people might be trained to func-
tion more efficiently in the technical
phases of war industry. In general, the
establishment and administration of
courses under this program fell into the
labs of the engineering colleges of the
nation because fully 75% of all expen-
ditures went into the training of people
for technical work, such as, Junior En-
gineering Aides, Ordnance and Aircraft
Inspectors, and for the teaching of pro-
fessional engineering courses on the col-
lege level. Thus a considerable addi-
tional load was placed upon the facul-
ties of engineering colleges which, with
the aid of instructors selected from the
outside, carried on the program.
Until early in 1944 engineering stu-
dents in the upper classes were de-
ferred from the draft and permitted to
complete their work for the baccalau-
reate degree. Thus the enrollment in
engineering colleges kept well up until
into the third year of the war.
Demand for engineering specialists in
all the military services caused the for-
mation of the Xavy College Training
Program (V-12) and the Army Special-
ized Training Program. The Xavy pro-

Ivan C. Crawford
gram conformed quite closely to the en-
gineering curricula of peace-time, even
to the adoption of a 16-week semester,
three semesters a year. The Army pro-
gram on the other hand, departed ma-
terially from the regular engineering
curricula and was built upon a 12-week
term or four quarters per year. The
College of Engineering participated in
both of these service programs and con-
sequently found itself operating on two
time schedules, namely, three terms per
year for civilian and Naval personnel
and four quarters per year for Army
students. Both of the service programs
were placed in effect in 1943. It was in
1942 that the entire University went on
a three-term basis, thus doing away
with the long summer vacation.
Added to the activities mentioned
above is a course in Xaval Architecture
and Marine Engineering by the Xavy
Department in June 1943. The objec-
tive is to train selected Xavy officers in
this field by means of a thirty-week
course of study. Instruction is furnished
jointly by Xavy officers and the staff of
the College.
The Army program for advanced en-
gineering students went out of exist-
ence at the University of Michigan for
all but sanitary engineers in March,
1944. The Xavy program continues;
probably it will continue for another
year, but with diminishing numbers.
Army reservists, trainees under 18 years
of age, continue to come to University
in small numbers.
Post-War Education
Committee Recommendations
With the peak of the war-load over
so far as educational programs are
concerned, it is only proper that thought
be given to planning the engineering
education programs for the future. A
year ago the Society for the Promotion
of Engineering Education appointed a
special committee to work on this prob-
lem. This committee reported in June.
1943, specifically recommending that all
engineering curricula reserve at least
20% of the student's educational time
for subjects of a humanistic-social na-
ture: and that these subjects be so se-
lected that they would constitute a "de-
signed sequence of courses extending
throughout the four undergraduate
years." Such an allottment of time
would be practically the equivalent of
a 3-hour course each semester. The
subjects which would compose the hu-
manistic-social stem are to be found in
the fields of History, Economics and
Government, and of Literature. Philoso-
phy, Psychology and Fine Arts.
This recommendation is of special in-
terest to the Michigan College of Engi-
neering because for a number of years
there has been reserved in its curricula
slightly over 20', of the students time
for free electives, English and Econom-
ics. Xo attempt has been made to coor-
dinate the free electives so that they
would become a "designed sequence of
courses." A study of 114 accredited
civil engineering curricula in the United
States reveals the fact that in 84 of
these curricula the amount of free elec-
tives, English and Economics is less
than required at the University of
Michigan. The study also shows that
there is much less extreme specialization
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


ing colleges. In one Michigan curricu-
lum, and it is thought that this is rep-
resentative of all of them, approxi-
mately 31 per cent of the student's time
is devoted to specialization within his
field of engineering. Some institutions
require 40% for such specialization.
The report referred to above suggests
that programs be prepared for three
groups of students "1. Those who
would follow programs of the usual pat-
tern This group would continue to
comprise a majority of the undergradu-
ate engineering students. 2. Those pre-
paring for careers in the operation and
management of industry. 3. Those who
would be fitted for unusual scientific
and creative accomplishments."
The report continues: "For all of the
programs mentioned, we believe that the
first three years should conform to cus-
tomary patterns, modified in general
characteristics as suggested in this re-
port, and with variations in subject mat-
ter of physical and engineering science
in accord with the several major
branches of engineering. After the third
year, however, more fundamental differ-
entiation would begin. For the first two
groups—regular students and the indus-
trial group—professional subject mat-
ter should be different in nature and
functional in purpose. The industrial
group would give major attention to
matters relating to production and op-
eration, while the regular group would
concentrate on scientific-technological
studies. The content of the humanistic
studies would be the same for both
groups as would be the total duration,
generally four academic years, required
for the baccalaureate degree."
"The program for the group prepar-
ing for highly scientific and creative en-
gineering work should be differentiated
from the other programs not later than
the end of the junior year in order to
provide broader and more fundamental
preparation in scientific principles and
methods than is needed for the general
run of students. This program would
of necessity be longer in duration than
the others and would extend from the
end of the junior year through one or
more years of graduate study leading
to the master's or doctor's degree"
In considering these suggestions there
immediately comes to mind the question
of whether or not it is feasible to clas-
sify students at the end of the junior
year into the functional groups. For stu-
dents with strong scientific leanings and
with outstanding records in mathematics
and science, there would probably be
little difficulty. In the other two groups
it would seem that the segregation
would result in a large percentage of un-
certainties.
Cooperative Engineering
Education
Alternating periods of formal school-
ing and experiences in industry compose
a system of education which has proved
its value. It is most effective when the
industrial experiences are varied and
carefully selected so as to lead to a
definite goal. This type of education
has now accumulated sufficient back-
ground to enable cooperating institu-
tions—industrial corporations and col-
leges—to clearly understand their mu-
tual problems. As a result, the pro-
grams now provided bring the student
into the industrial world with some un-
derstanding of the problems of produc-
tion and our industrial society. Only by
carefully choosing work experiences
during vacation periods can the conven-
tional type of student bring to his job
in industry the same understanding. All
indications point an extension of coop-
erative education in the engineering
field.
The College of Engineering has been
engaged, in a limited way, in coopera-
tive education since 1927. Immediately
preceding the War such programs had
practically disappeared; recently one
has been re-established and it is ex-
pected that the movement will grow
with the advent of peace.
Returning Veterans
Many, many men now serving in the
armed forces look forward to engineer-
ing as a career after the war. Some of
these veterans have had a year or two
in college either as regular students or
as trainees in the Army programs; oth-
ers who will enter our colleges are
young men who entered the services di-
rectly from high school. In either case
it would seem that they should be given
the opportunity of completing their for-
mal educations as expeditionally as pos-
sible, but without the elimination of
subject matter fundamental to the ma-
jor branch of engineering in which they
wish to specialize. They will be several
years older than the normal student,
and will have had experiences which
have aged them beyond their years.
Their interests and the interests of so-
ciety generally, it seems, will be best
served by placing them in active life
just as soon as possible.
The Outlook for the Future
The system of education under which
the engineers of the present have been
developed has proved its worth both
in peace and in the trying days of war.
Men trained in applied science have
been at a premium both in war industry
and in practically all branches of the
military service. In spite of the fact
that the results of the system have been
tested by experience and have been
found to be good, it appears that in or-
der to keep abreast of scientific and so-
cial developments some changes may be
in order.
It is quite clear that students inter-
ested in the strictly scientific aspects of
engineering must be prepared to spend a
longer period of time in college study.
Constantly expanding fields of engineer-
ing demand more time. The S.P.E.E.
Committee report suggests that addi-
tional time be spent in graduate study
and research. This group would com-
prise but a relatively small percentage
of the total number enrolled in engineer-
ing schools.
Those colleges whose curricula leave
little room for electives are faced with
two alternatives in trying to adopt the
recommended sequence of humanistic-
social studies; they must either make
room by lessening specialization or by
adopting a longer program. One or two
have already announced that they will
follow the latter course. In these cases
the entire period of time will be spent
in the engineering college; a significant
departure from the proposal of several
years ago that one or two years should
be spent in the study of "liberal" sub-
jects before entering on the study of en-
gineering.
The general overall situation in tech-
nical education is further complicated
by the proposed establishment of a con-
siderable number of new technical insti-
tutes. These schools would serve those
who have completed high school and
who for one reason or another would not
continue on to college. Without doubt
there is a place for such institutions in
the field of technical education, but it is
questionable whether a great expansion
is justified at the present time. The
tradition in America has been that the
students continuing beyond the second-
ary school will take a college course and
secure a degree; nothing short of this
has been satisfactory in either the stu-
dent or his parents. Perhaps conditions
have changed.

The project popularly known as the
St. Lawrence Seaway is officially before
the governing bodies of the United
States and Canada again, and it is be-
lieved by those who are in a position to
judge best that it will be favorably
acted upon this time, regardless of the
impression gained by some persons that
it was rejected by the United States
Senate in the closing days of 1944.
What is the Seaway?
What constitutes favorable action?
In referring to it, why use the term
"again" or "this time"?
After almost twenty years of study by
engineers, economists, and public men in
the United States and Canada, the Sea-
way, in almost the form under consid-
eration now, was made the subject of a
treaty between the two countries and
submitted to the Senate of the United
States in March, 1934. It failed to re-
ceived the required two-thirds of the
Senate approval, the vote being 46 yea,
42 nay, 5 absent, and 3 paired.
One might justifiably ask, just what
is the St. Lawrence Seaway? Hasn't the
St. Lawrence River been the outlet of
the Great Lakes to the sea since glacial
times? In answer one might say yes to
the latter part of the question and to the
first part add that in a general way the
river has been a water route from the
Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean ever
since man has lived in the Great Lakes
Basin or along the banks of the river.
Ferdinand N. Mcncfec
It was first used by the American In-
dian as a water highway on which he
traveled by canoe. But there were
many rapids and one great water fall,
now called Niagara, around which he
had to portage.
He could start from Lake Superior
and shoot the rapids at Sault Ste. Marie
and paddle down the St. Mary's River
lowering himself from 601 feet above
sea level to 580 feet and find himself in
Lake Huron. From Lake Huron he
could paddle southward through Lake
St. Clair and down the Detroit River to

Lake Erie, dropping 8 feet more to an
elevation of 572 feet. Then, by pad-
dling eastward in Lake Erie, he finally
came to the Niagara River around the
falls and rapids of which he had to
portage for a drop of more than 250
feet; and thence northward through
perilous waters to Lake Ontario, the
level of which is 326 feet below Lake
Erie and 246 feet above the sea. At
the eastern end of Lake Ontario he en-
tered the St. Lawrence River proper.
Passing northeasterly through the
''Thousand Islands," through compara-
tively quiet water for 67 miles, he came
to Chimney Point and to a 48 mile
stretch of what is now called the Inter-
national Section of the river reaching to
St. Regis. In the International Section
he shot the Galop Rapids, the Rapid
Plat and the Long Sault Rapids, drop-
ping downward for 92 feet. From St.
Regis onward he was in what is now
Canada for the rest of his journey to the
sea. But to reach sea level he had to
pass through a wide stretch of the River
known as Lake St. Francis, a series of
rapids in the Soulauges Section and an-
other series in the Lachine Section be-
fore reaching the location of Montreal
and comparatively quiet water dis-
turbed only by normal river current and
the fluctuation caused by tides which
come up the River to Quebec 120 miles
further on. He still had 300 miles to go
if he wished to visit or trade with the
inhabitants of Newfoundland lying in
the mouth of the river and beyond
which was the Atlantic Ocean.
There is some evidence that fisheries
by white men off the coast of Newfound-
land existed before the voyage of Cabot
in 1497. In 1506, one Deris of Hon-
fleur (France) explored the Gulf of St.
Lawrence and Jacques Cartier first
reached the coast of Newfoundland in
August, 1535. He discovered current in
the waters inland from that large is-
land, from which he concluded that he
was in a river. Cartier is credited with
naming the river St. Lawrence.
For four hundred and ten years since
the time of Cartier, the river has been a
travel route for white men: explorers,
adventurers, missionaries and settlers.
The first lock canals on the St. Law-
rence were built around the three rap-
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Engineers in 1783. They were 120 feet
long, 9 feet wide, with a lift of 6 feet
to each lock. From that year on the
building of locks and canals has pro-
gressed westward from Montreal. In
1797 the Northwest Fur Company built
a 9 foot lock and a 2580 foot canal on
the Canadian side of the St. Mary's
river at Sault Ste. Marie. Following
this, Michigan with help from the Fed-
eral Government, built another set of
locks and a canal on the American side
of the St. Marys in 1855. There were
two locks 350 feet long, 70 feet wide,
each with a lift of 9 feet.
With the passage of time and with
the increase in traffic—mostly iron ore
coming down and coal going up—the
Weitzel, the Poe, the Davis, the Sabin,
and a new Canadian lock with canals
were built at the Soo. Then in 1943, as
a war time measure the Weitzel lock
was replaced by the McArthur lock,
built to Seaway specifications and at a
cost of $14,000,000. All are a part of
the Seaway. In addition, the Detroit
River has been dredged to allow safe
passage for ore boats and is now prac-
tically deep enough to conform to Sea-
way specifications, which call for 27
foot channels.
In 1829 Canada finished the first
Welland Canal by which boats could
pass between Lake Erie and Lake On-
tario. In 1932, they opened the fourth
Welland Canal. It conforms to present
seaway qualifications and was built on
the assumption that the final link in
the waterway—that portion in the In-
ternational Section from Chimney Point
to St. Regis—would be sanctioned soon
thereafter. As previously mentioned,
the treaty between the United States
and Canada failed of ratification in
1934. Since that time surveys of the
damsite at Bernhart Island near Mas-
sena. New York and Cornwall, Ontario,
have been restudied. Under the super-
vision of the International Joint Com-
mission, borings have been made and
plans redrawn which have met the ap-
proval of the United States Army En-
gineers, The Power Authority of the
State of New York, the Province of
Ontario, and the Dominion of Canada.
The general plan is as follows. On
the north side of Barnhart Island just
above St. Regis and at the bottom of
the 92 foot fall in the river from Chim-
ney Point, two power plants will be lo-
cated in the river. The American plant
will extend from the Island out to mid-
stream, and from there on to the Canad-
ian shore the Canadian plant will be
built. The International Boundary will
run between them. From the head of
Barnhart Island to the New York shore
line a dam will intercept that branch of
the river which normally flows to the
south of the island. A navigation canal
with two locks will run along the New
York shore from the pool above the
dam to the water level in the river just
below the power houses. Forty-eight
miles upstream near Morrisburg, a con-
trol dam and lock will be installed.
The control dam at Morrisburg and the
dam at Barnhart Island will drown out
the falls and rapids in the 92 foot drop
between Chimney Point and St. Regis.
The locks at the control dam and in the
canal south of Barnhart Island will be
80 feet wide and 820 feet long with a
minimum depth of water over the sills
of 30 feet. All channels will have Sea-
way specification depth of 27 feet.
The navigational improvements in the
river between Chimney Point and St.
Regis and the power houses at the foot
of Barnhart Island are what is now re-
ferred to as the St. Lawrence Seaway,
although in fact the Seaway extends
from Duluth to Newfoundland.
Pertinent data on the locks of the
proposed Seaway is seen in Table 1.
Favorable action on the project con-
sists in approval by a two-thirds of the
United States Senate if it is to be sub-
mitted as a treaty, or by a favorable
majority vote of the Senate and the
House of Representatives if it is to be
submitted in the form of an executive
agreement between the two countries.
On March 19, 1941, an agreement
was drawn up between the United States
and Canada whereby the two govern-
ments agreed to:
(1) Establish and maintain a Great-
St. Lawrence Basin Commission, of not
more than ten members, of whom an
equal number will be appointed by each
government.
(2) Under supervision of the "Com-
mission'1 Canada agreed to construct
the works in the International Section,
allocated to it by the ''Commission/'
and to bring all those parts of the river
lying wholly in Canada to Seaway speci-
fications by December 31, 1948.
(3) The United States agreed to con-
struct the works in the International
Section allocated to it by the "Com-
mission" and to provide funds for all
the work done in the International Sec-
tion, except for the machinery and
equipment in the Canadian Power
House and expense of rehabilitation of
flooded property owners on the Canad-
ian site of the International Boundary.
Itemized costs of the works in the In-
ternational Rapids Section are given in
a Department of State Bulletin of
March 22, 1941, as $266,170,000 from
which $8,403,000 is to be subtracted
as being costs of rehabilitation along the
Canadian shore, and $93,375,000 as
the amount New York State agreed
to pay for the power plant. The net

Diamonds were diverted from purely
luxury channels into industrial at
the advent of World War I. By 1925
the potentialities of the black diamond,
the lowly cousin of the gem diamond,
were being greatly dramatized and such
characterizations as "industrial dia-
monds—the crown jewels of industry"
appeared. Now, twenty years later, the
widely used industrial diamond is
threatened by a stripping of its gem
standing. A foremost British diamond
concern suggested that, since industrial
diamonds are used in such quantity,
they be marketed by the kilogram rather
than by the carat. Despite a possible
drop to the common weight level, the
diamond remains the gem of industry.
These workaday diamonds are per-
forming essential operations in steel
mills, mills for drawing copper, steel and
tungsten wire, in automotive and avia-
tion plants, and in machine shops.
About 75-80% of the world's produc-
tion of diamonds are used in mining
and manufacturing operations, the vast
majority in processing metals and al-
loys; a secondary amount in prospec-
tors' drills which locate ore mines;
wire-drawing; grinding, cutting and fin-
ishing operations on automobile motors,
aircraft pistons, submarine torpedo
tubes and precision optical instruments.
Diamond tools alone make possible
the use of extremely fine tolerances and
the working of exceptionally hard met-
als. These techniques are closely allied
to the production of quality war ma-
chines, airplanes, tanks, guns, trucks,
and the super-precision instruments re-
quired by radio and rangefinders. Much
of our war equipment would have been
inferior in quality if the need for a re-
serve stock of diamonds had not been
anticipated.
The three main classifications of dia-
monds are: (1) carbonados or "black
diamonds," (2) bortz, and (3) gem dia-
monds.
Carbonado is a cluster of small dia-
monds, non-cleavable, opaque, less brit-
tle and more tough than the crystal va-
riety. Bortz is round with a radiate or
confused crystalline structure. Particu-
by
KAREN D. NELSON
larly fine bortz composed of crystals ra-
diating from a common center are
known as ballas. Carbonados are ob-
tained in quantity only from alluvial de-
posits (streams and gravel beds) in the
State of Bahia, Brazil. Bortz is mined
principally in South Africa. Brazil, the
East Indies and India are minor sources.
The U. S. imports 97% of its supply
from alluvial deposits in Africa, princi-
pally the Belgian Congo. African "pipe
mines'' have ceased operation due to a
severe labor shortage. Brazil is progres-
sively producing from alluvial deposits.
Venezuela and a part of British Guiana
afforded small amounts for a number of
years. Their unexploited fields may
eventually supplant the African which
have reportedly passed the peak of pro-
duction.
On the traditional Mohs scale, the
hardness of the diamond is 10. A more
sensitive scale presented by Wooddell
shows the diamond to be 4-5 times as
hard as corundum: corundum being 9;
South American carbonados, 36.4;
South American brown bortz, 42.4;
boron carbide, the hardest synthetic
abrasive, 19.7. Though cemented car-
bides and synthetic abrasives are ex-
ceedingly hard, the diamond will scratch
any of them.

Specially trained and highly paid ar-
tisans are employed to shape diamonds
into cutting mediums. The United
States, which produces no diamonds ex-
cept for an infinitesimal deposit in Pike
County, Arkansas, received the bulk of
the skilled diamond cutters who ecaped
Nazi oppressed Holland. New York is
now the diamond-center of the world
and for the first time, American appren-
tices are learning the skill.
Industrial stones may be classified as
(1) drilling stones, (2) shaped stones,
(3) natural stones and (4) die stones.
Drilling stones are small and well-
shaped, usually about 80 to the carat
and up to % carat in size. Shaped
stones are select. They are lapped and
polished according to the specifications
of individual operations. Stones from
0.1501-.2S carats are required for most
diamond tools. Small tools for ^2 in.
bushings take a stone from 0.30-0.35
carat. The commonly employed boring
tools need stones as large as 0.5-1.0
carat. Larger tools and form tools may
take considerably more carats. Other
than for boring and turning, these tools
fitted with shaped diamonds are used in
machining non-ferrous and non-metal-
lic substances.
Natural stones, selected for shape and
structure, may be used without further
finishing. Set in various types of hold-
ers, they serve predominantly as wheel
dressers.
Diamond dies stones are small, of
gem quality with clear centers, and free
of flaws.
The distinction between «gem dia-
monds and industrial stones is mobile,
fluctuating with individual stones, price,
and demand. All diamonds are inher-
ently capable of industrial application,
though those of higher quality are gen-
erally cut, polished, and marketed as
gems. At present many stones which
would ordinarily be used for ornamen-
tation are allocated to the diamond tool
industry.
About % of all industrial diamonds
are used as dies for the precision draw-
ing of fine wire of copper, steel, tung-
sten, osmium and tantalum. These
stones are round, the so-called "flats."

carats. Usually the diamonds have
smooth rounded corners and are octahe-
dral in habit.
The tungsten filaments in light bulbs
vary in diameter from 0.00055-0.00187
in. The wire is passed through 75 differ-
ent dies to reduce the diameter from
0.04-0.0004 in. The specifications which
must be met include a maximum ± 1%
variation in diameter and no more than
a ± .25% variance along the wire. A
rod of tungsten 3 in. long and ^ in. in
diameter can be transformed into a fila-
ment 58 miles long by diamond draw-
ing.
Stainless steel wire can be drawn to
gages so fine, the use of die material
other than the diamond is not feasible.
The drawing speed for the steel wire
varies from about 650 feet per minute
at 0.0009 in. diameter to 1800 feet per
minute at 0.0019 in. diameter. A
0.020-in. die will draw approximately
100 Ib. of wire; a 0.0019-in. die will av-
erage 5 Ibs. Since there are 15,000 feet
of wire per pound at this latter diame-
ter, it is apparent that the die life is
long.
In the preparation of the die, lowest
quality diamonds are broken down into
powder and screened through 400-mesh
sieves. The powder is further graded by
centrifuge, and chemically treated to re-
move foreign matter. Before the dia-
mond die is drilled, two parallel faces
are cut and polished. The exact position
for penetration is marked on one of the
faces and the exit precisely centered on
the other. The diamond powder de-
veloped by the grinding of the needle is
the true cutting agent rather than the
needle itself. After the hole is polished
with diamond powder, the die stone is
mounted in an appropriate metal case,
and secured with a metallic alloy.
Diamond dies of 0.002 in. diameter
or greater have been made in this coun-
try for years. However, until 1941 ex-
tremely fine dies, 0.0003-0.002 in., were
all imported from Europe. The U. S.
can now supply its own domestic de-
mand for these smaller diameter dies.
Precision boring with diamond tools
came to the fore with the advent of the
Liberty engine and the difficulty of
aligning the seven bearings of the motor.
Following further development, the au-
tomotive and aviation industries adopted
the process for applications where
greater uniformity and close tolerance
were required on large runs.
Because of their hardness, diamond
tools do not wear in the accepted sense.
They chip from hitting a hard spot, a
hole, or through excessive machine vi-
bration. Diamonds cannot be success-
fully employed in any tool which is sub-
ject to a "chattering" action—due to
their brittleness. Brazilian diamonds,
composed of myriads of minute crystals
are more satisfactory than the normal
large single crystal. A single diamond
tool may produce 200,000 parts before
relapping is necessary.
Diamond tools have been used to turn
metals ranging from soft babbitt to
hard bronze with an accuracy of
1/10,000 inch.
Shaped tools are made by craftsmen
familiar with both diamond cutting
practice and the requirements of ma-
chining operations. In fashioning tool
diamonds, the shape is first magnified
75-100 times by a projectograph. The
diamond cutter cuts or polishes first the
table (flat part) of the stone and then
the right and left sides. This latter shap-
ing gives the diamond the included
angle desired and proper clearance on
the cutting edge. The radius or rounded
cutting edge is formed and polished as
the final step. The dimensions are then
rechecked with the projectograph.
In a typical automobile plant these
shaped diamonds are set in metal hold-
ers and used to finish wrist pin holes in
pistons, to ream bearing ends of con-
necting rods, and to turn aluminum al-
loy pistons and other parts. Aluminum
alloy pistons were machined with great
difficulty before shaped diamond tools
were employed to turn them.
Both shaped diamond tools and resin-
oid wheels impregnated with diamond
dust are used in truing grinding wheels.
About 85% of the stones employed are
of the bortz type, the remaining
15 r/f, carbonados. The shaped diamond
adapted to this purpose generally has a
rounded cutting face. The combination
of a very slow and uniform rate of travel
across the wheel face and a light cut
averts undue heating of the diamond.
Though the operation of truing a
grinding wheel is a simple one, its ef-
fects are far-reaching. Fine finishes im-
parted to bearings in automobiles per-
mit initial full-speed operation without
a breaking-in period. Thread- and gear-
grinding operations also require these
tools for dressing grinding wheels.
In the past decade, innovations in the
diamond-drill field have been prolific.
Though the technique was discovered in
1864, the imperfections of the early in-
strument were still tolerated as late as
1929. At that time, Brazilian black dia-
monds, $175 per carat to the drilling
trade, were used almost exclusively.
The adoption of the cheaper bortz bits
contributed to an increase in the use
of diamond drills. When black dia-
monds were used, bit-rotating speeds of
300-500 r.p.m. were considered suffi-
cient. Speeds from 100-2000 r.p.m are
now standard with some machines.
Black diamonds threw considerable
pressure on the bit: bortz, despite high-
bit rotating speed, transfers little pres-
sure. Originally, bortz diamonds were
manually set in the inner and outer
periphery of the flat-face types of bits
used for the black diamond. It was rap-
idly discovered that contour bits were
superior. Cast or sintered bits which

a gentleman and an
officer
The University of Michigan is fortun-
ate in having such capable and under-
standing officers in charge of its service-
men. One of the most highly respected
and universally popular of these is Lt.
Melvin G. Flegal, who is an excellent
soldier, as well as an "all around Joe."
His story is unusual and interesting.
Lt. Flegal, who hails from Salt Lake
City, Utah, began his unique career as
a professional dancer, while operating a
dancing school in Salt Lake City. In
1928-29, he journeyed to Broadway,
where he was featured in the "White
Way Gaities."

Lt. Melvin G. Flegal
However, he did not by any means
limit his activities to the theatrical
world alone. His regular participation
in various sports has practically amount-
ed to a vocation. He plays an excellent
game of golf, usually shooting close to
par. At one time, he was President of
the Nibly Park Golf Association, a fact
which only further exhibits his pro-
ficiency in this sport. As Secretary of
the Silver Skiis organization, Lt. Flegal
enjoyed several winters skiing at Alta,
Utah. His fondness for hunting and
fishing were, no doubt, partially re-
sponsible for his membership in the Salt
Lake Fishing and Hunting Association.
Even these few examples of his diversi-
fied fields of interest give one an idea
of the scope of his work before the
present war.
Lt. Flegal entered the Army for the
sole purpose of becoming an entertainer
for the boys in service. He took his
basic training at Camp Roberts, Cali-
fornia; and attended O.C.S. at Fort
Benning, Georgia, in order to become a
special service officer. However, his con-
tact with the infantry made him literally
"fall in love" with that branch of the
service and as soon as he received his
commission, he journeyed to Ft. Sheridan
in the capacity of M.P. Company Offi-
cer. Finally, he received his orders to
come to Ann Arbor, where he now serves
as Assistant Professor of Military Sci-
ences and Tactics. He was accompanied
by his charming wife and young son
Bobby.
It could have been expected that Lt.
Flegal would not content himself with
merely one line of work in Ann Arbor,
but he has even set himself a new record
here. One of his numerous "sidelines"
was the ice carnival given in Ann Arbor
last year. It is the common opinion
that he did a most magnificent job in
running the show, as well as carrying
out his duties as Vice-President of the
Ann Arbor Figure Skating Club.
At present, Lt. Flegal is in charge of
the War Bond Sales for the University,
and in this capacity he has done a most
commendable job. Furthermore he in-
structs several classes in rifle practice,
and is in charge of the ROTC rifle team.
Whenever he finds time, he runs over
to Ypsilanti, where he is an instructor
in the Civil Air Patrol.
It is obvious that the Lieutenant lives
a well-rounded, busy life. Vet busy as
he always is, Lt. Flegal always has time
to be cheerful and friendly to all. The
very fact that he can handle details so
capably, while retaining his winning per-
sonality, should serve as an inspiration
to all students.
"Hello, MICHIGAN' TECHNIC.
Kelso speaking." By way of introduc-
tion, this is probably the most familar
way we can present Jack Robert Kelso
to you. To those of us who inhabit the
TECHNIC office, this greeting over
4121, Extension 483, became very well
known during the past few months. No
longer do we hear it, however, for our
Editor-in-Chief for Fall, 1944, has left
us and is now giving Uncle Sam the
benefit of his talent and experience.
Jack is only one of Michigan's many
senior engineering students who have
had to leave before completing their col-
lege careers ... in his case, four weeks
and one semester before graduation. Al-
though Jack was anxious to go into serv-
ice, he did regret having to leave these
familiar haunts that form some of the
most poignant memories of college life.

Jack Robert Kelso
Proof of his ability to maintain a sub-
stantially high scholastic record and still
participate in a number of outside ac-
tivities may be found when one exam-
ines his past three and a half years on
campus. As a second semester fresh-
man, Jack was initiated into Phi Eta
Sigma. At that time he tried out for
the TECHNIC and went through the
usual gruelling tryout period that our
recruits experience. Two terms later he
was tapped by Triangles in recognition
of his scholastic and activities standing.
When a junior, he became Managing
Editor of the TECHNIC. He kept this
position for three semesters, serving also
on the Engineering Council, and was
initiated into Vulcans. In his senior
year, he was elected to membership in
Tau Beta Pi, senior honor society, and
18
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


served as corresponding secretary. Be-
ing a Civil Engineering student (struc-
tural major), Jack was also a member
of A.S.C.E. He also managed to squeeze
in two years in the ROTC, attaining the
rank of sergeant in the basic program.
And until he left, J. R. was an active
member of Acacia, quite ably fulfilling
his duties this semester as Social Chair-
man, a position for which we know he
was well-suited.
Jack loves to talk about the TECH-
NIC (who could blame him?), some-
times even carrying his troubles to be
discussed on the most social of occa-
sions. But he really did have his dif-
ficulties, particularly since the Editor's
burden of late has been increased due
to a somewhat smaller staff. Jack's fa-
vorite job during the past semester was
"putting the dummy to bed at 3 A.M."
every month. Then he could sit back
and take it easy for several days, until
it become necessary to begin work on
the next issue.
Most of J. Robert's spare time last
fall was spent up here at the office
where he was either using the steel-
tipped whip in his efforts to convince
the staff that the copy should be in be-
fore the deadline; or madly doing some
last-minute proof-reading that the as-
sistant editor had left for him as usual.
Occasionally he would put on his best
bedside manner and tell some new vic-
tim (who wanted to join the staff) in
his own smooth, suave way just how
wonderful it is to work for the TECH-
IC and how much we could use his
particular talent. It usually worked!
At any rate, Jack spent so much of
his time on such things as these, that
he rarely, if ever, had an opportunity to
play tennis and handball, his favorite
sports. His most enjoyable task on
campus was spotting from the Press
Box during the last two football sea-
sons. This duty grew out of a former
position as one of the managers of the
football team in his sophomore year.
Jackson hails from Detroit where
he attended Central High. It was there
that he became interested in engineering
and decided to come to Michigan. He
said very emphatically before he left
that he would return, after the war, to
receive at least his Bachelor's Degree
in Civil Engineering, but had no fur-
ther definite plans.
His fondest hope will be realized
when he at last has an opportunity to
BE an engineer so he will have time to
do all the things he missed while in
school learning how to become one. He
believes that after the war, too, it would
be a good idea to carry out the five year
plan proposed for engineering students,
so that they may include a few more lit-
erary courses in their schedules. He
stated that, "Such a plan would be use-
ful to the prospective engineer not only
by enabling him to take courses for
which he feels a need, but also to help
broaden his education."
Jack is undoubtedly best character-
ized by his favorite remark which cov-
ers any and every situation. . . "That's
life." As several people have mentioned,
when you hear that little phrase, you
think, that's Kelso.
Although Jack has a very pleasing
personality, his seriousness has some-
times become the object of his friends'
teasing. Yet, with all his seriousness,
one feels a genuine sincerity about Jack
and an earnest desire to please everyone.
Remarkably enough, he usually does.
We would like to say that if he can ac-
complish this endeavor in life, he will
certainly be on the road to success and
we wish him the best of luck.

Wilmer G. Pierson, better known to
his friends as "Bill," came to us from
Saginaw in June of 1942. After one se-
mester as a civilian, he went into uni-
form when the NROTC was incorpor-
ated into the Navy Specialized Training
Program.
Bill had planned to study medicine
but several factors made him change his
mind. When the United States entered
the war he saw that he would not have
time to complete medical school, but he
wanted to have some training which
would be of value to both himself and
the Navy, in which he intended to en-
list. He had been most interested and
had received his best grades in mathe-
matics and the sciences in high school
and therefore decided that engineering
would be his field. His brother, who re-
ceived his degree in M.E. here and is
now a Lieutenant in the Navy, con-
vinced him to study mechanical engi-
neering. He will graduate in February
with his degree in M.E. and has applied
for submarine duty. He feels that he is
best suited for this sort of work because
of his interest in it and also because he
has specialized in Diesel Engines.
Bill says he likes it here and would
have come to Michigan even if he did
not live in this state. He likes Ann Ar-
bor because it is so easy to get around
since everything is within walking dis-
tance. Before the war there was plenty
to do and there was always something
going on. Naturally, due to the war,
most things slowed down, but he says
that now things are on the upgrade
again. One of the things he likes about
being in the Navy as compared to his
civilian life here is that he gets to meet
and know a lot more fellows now than
he did before. However, one of the
drawbacks of being in the Navy is that
he cannot have the "midnight snacks"
he used to have as a civilian.
At present, Bill is one of the three
company commanders in the X.R.O.
Each company consists of approximately
eighty men. He is a member of Tau
Beta Pi, president of Acacia, secretary
of the A.S.M.E., a member, of Vulcans,
and Engineering Council representative
for Vulcans. He says that he doesn't
work too hard but just "hits the exams
right."
In the course of three years in the
Navy and in college, one is bound to
have several interesting experiences and
pull some boners, and Bill—being hu-
man—is no exception. Once on a train-
ing cruise on the Great Lakes Bill
served as a "hot shell man." This job

Wilmer C. Pierson
consists of removing the hot shells from
the guns after they have been fired.
Members of the gun crew have cotton
in their ears to protect them from the
noise. While he was handling shells, one
of the guns was shot off. He happened
to have his mouth open at the time and
the sudden change in pressure blew the
cotton out of his ears. He could not

tankers
Task Force 58 the most powerful
unit in all history, was many thousands
of miles from its home base when, in
one engagement, it sank 30 Japanese
ships and destroyed 757 enemy planes.
It may well be asked how a large fleet
such as this is able to operate efficiently
so far out in the ocean. The answer is
this: the unit carries its own fuel, food,
replacement aircraft and pilots wherever
it goes. In other words, the fleet is a
floating warehouse as well as a destruct-
ive fighting outfit.
One of the most interesting and im-
portant stories of supply is that of the
oil tankers. These vessels carry the life-
blood of the fleet, and without them,
long and continuous operations are im-
possible.
When war broke out in 1939, this
country had a total of less than 350
tankers, about two-thirds of which were
more than 25 years old. Practically all
of these ships were slow, running at
about ten knots.
The British soon were in a very bad
spot. From the beginning of the war
to May, 1941, the Allies lost a million
deadweight tons of tankers. It was a
question whether or not they could carry
on the war with the supply of oil so
drastically cut. The United States
could offer little help, because of its
neutrality, and because there weren't
enough tankers to supply the British as
well as ourselves with oil.
Finally to meet the possibility of our
entering the war, the Maritime Commis-
sion decided to start building the mer-
chant fleet we might need. An order
was placed for 50 high-speed tankers.
The problem of propulsion was a big
one, for turbine gears, which had been
used for most of the tankers up to then,
were needed badly for the great project-
ed fleet of cargo vessels. An ideal solu-
tion was soon found: turbine-electric
drives, supplying 6000 horsepower to
drive the new tankers at 15VL&gt; knots.
The ships are of 16,600 deadweight
tons, carry 135,000 barrels of oil.
Then came Pearl Harbor, and our
tankers were preyed on by Nazi subs.
The 50 new tankers under construction
were not enough; several hundred more
were ordered from the nation's ship-
builders. Slowly at first, but at an in-
creasing rate, these high-speed tankers,
most of which were powered by turbine-
electric drives, slid down the ways.
Courtesy General Electric
10,000 h.p. turbine-electric tanker
Gradually this menacing situation v&gt;-a~
brought under control, and oil was de-
livered steadily across both oceans.
The high speed of the new tankers is
very important in eluding enemy sub-
marines, which travel only about 10
knots under water and twice that on the
surface. Equipped with antiaircraft
and deck guns, the tankers can take
care of themselves. In the Pacific they
run free, in the Atlantic they are con-
voyed only because of the double threat
of Nazi subs and planes.
The American tanker fleet now i-
superb. After the war, the majority of
the ships will be sold to private oil and
tanker companies as replacements for
older craft. The railroads, which are
doing an immense job of transporting
oil, will not compete with tankers be-
cause of their high cost. The three pipe-
lines that run from Texas to New York
will continue to carry oil at about 3 cents
more per barrel than the tankers, and
there is a possibility that one of these
lines will be converted to natural gas.
Since less than half of the normally re-
quired oil can be piped in these lines
anyway, the tankers will supply most of
the oil required on the Atlantic Coast,
the major consuming area.
Our tankers, then, will be required to
continue their efficient service after this
war. In any case, our tanker fleet will
never be allowed to drop to the depths
it did in the early '30's, and if ever these
ships are urgently needed to serve the
country again, they will be ready.
railroads and research
Probably no other industry is as re-
sponsible for as many lines of research
in nearly every field as are the Railway*
of America. There are very few indus-
tries, in fact, that have not contributed
to the scientific advancement of the rail-
roads during the last three quarters of a
century.
The railways, being a service indus-
try, offer no physical product for sale
and consequently do not delve into their
own research as much as they might.
Also, a lack of capital has prevented it
to a large extent. Instead, manufactur-
ers have exploited the large and diver-
sified market resulting from the great
demand of the industry.
The railway supply industry, then,
is what has developed. This includes
locomotive and car builders, manufac-
turers of couplers, car wheels, locorn &gt;•
live super-heaters, air brakes, firms sup-
plying special power and control equip-

A. S. C. E.
The A.S.C.E. held its third meeting
of the semester January 10, 1945 at
the Michigan Union. Professor Young
of the Engineering College was the
speaker for the evening. His subject
was "Aerial Photography" and was
accompanied by lantern slides relating
to the subject.
All members of the student chapter
were invited to attend the banquet and
business meeting of the Michigan Sen-
ior Society which was held January 26
at the Michigan Union. The meeting
was enjoyed by all who attended.
The final meeting of the semester was
held on February 14.
I. Ac. S.
Good news for all you Aeros! The
student chapter of the I. Ae S. has been
reorganized. The first meeting was held
on January 24th in the Michigan Union.
At this time, Mr. Chester S. Ricker, De-
troit Editor of "Aviation," gave an il-
lustrated lecture on "Some Structural
Features of Foreign Airplanes."
The election of officers took place,
and a group photograph was taken for
the 'Ensian.
Regular meetings will be held on the
2nd and 4th Wednesdays of the month.
Come on, Aeros, the I. Ae. S. was re-
organized because you wanted it; it's
up to you to help keep the ball rolling.
TAU BETA PI
On January 18, an initiation banquet
was held at the Michigan Union for the
newly elected members of Tau Beta Pi.
Professor Burkland, of the Engineering
English faculty, spoke on "What the

ate."
The following men were those hon-
ored:

ENGINE COUNCIL
One of the first actions of the Engi-
neering Council this term was to at-
tempt a foolproof coordination of the
meetings of the various active Engineer-
ing Societies. A schedule of assigned
dates was prepared by the Collabora-
tion Committee of the Council, under
the leadership of Robert Dolph, and
this was distributed to the societies con-
cerned. So far this term there has been
a minimum of conflicting meetings, and
things seem to be running very smoothly
in this respect.
The Council Treasurer, Fred Dyson,
undertook the rather thankless job of
collecting class dues during registration
week. The $26.00 collected was cred-


ited to the proper class accounts, and
records were made of individual pay-
ments for future reference.
The next step of major importance
taken by the council was the election of
representatives by the Freshman and
Sophomore classes. Charles Helmick
and George Spaulding were elected by
the Soph Engineers to represent them
on the Council, while Rudolph Haber-
mann and Victor Brooks were elected to
similar positions by the Freshmen. At
the same time, the Senior class officers
were elected, those elected being: Jim
Wallis, President; Bob Precious, Vice-
President; and Bill Culligan, Secretary-
Treasurer.
In order to acquaint the Freshmen
and transfers with the various societies
active in the Engineering College, the
Council held a smoker in the Union on

Thursday night, January 18. Vice-Pre&gt;i-
dent F. X. Xutto, with his committee of
Helmick, Spaulding, Habermann and
Brooks did a very good job in putting
the affairs over. Most of the societies
both professionals and honorary had
representatives present who told some-
thing of the activities of their respective
groups. The gathering seemed well
worth while, and the Council is consid-
ering the sponsorship of such smokers
in subsequent terms.

College students majoring in chemistry and other technical subjects find special interest
in Dow developments. Here are some of the things Dow has learned how to do as
producer of more than 500 chemicals essential to industry:
How to specialize in the chemistry of brine by recovering bromine, chlorine, magnesium
and other chemicals from a prehistoric salt sea imprisoned
far below the surface of the earth—how to handle enormous
volumes of ocean water in continuous flowr for the
recovery of both bromine and magnesium.
How to develop original processes for large-scale, low-cost
production of these chemicals, their co-products and
related materials.
How to develop plastic materials—
Kthocel, Styron, Saran—with distinctive
properties of varied usefulness.
How to develop Dowmetal Magnesium Alloys to give the
lightest of structural metals strength, ductility and other essential qualities.
How to fabricate magnesium, aptly called the Metal of Motion.
Such constructive tasks for the advancement of industry provide a fascinating field for men
interested in industrial chemistry as a life work. Dow draws
heavily on college men to recruit its large staff of technicians
and technically trained service and sales employees.

national Sections, the "bottle neck" of
the St. Lawrence Seaway, would ac-
cording to these figures be $164,392,000.
We know, however, that since the 1932
treaty was rejected in 1934, improve-
ments have been made in the river be-
tween Lake Ontario and St. Regis. We
know too that the McArthur Lock at
Saulte Ste Marie has been installed at
a cost of $14,000,000.
Considering the fact that the $164,-
302,000 is based on 1940 prices; that
they do not include the McArthur Lock
or the expenditures made on channel im-
provements since 1934, it is probable
that the costs from that time on will be
at least $200,000,000 and perhaps
more.
On December 12, 1944, the March
19, 1941 agreement with Canada was
attached by amendment to the Rivers
and Harbors bill and was defeated by
a vote in the United States Senate of
56 to 25. Thus the Seaway was de-
feated when submitted as a treaty in
1934 and again in 1944 when submitted
as an agreement. Friends of the proj-
ect say that the latter defeat was because
it had no hearing before the Commerce
Committee and that certain Senators
were opposed to its form. They prophe-
sized passage when the State Depart-
ment worked out a more acceptable one.
Senator Vandenberg of Michigan says
he has "personally recommended to the
State Department that the present
'agreement' be withdrawn and that a
new 'agreement' be negotiated with
Canada in a form which will avoid the
Constitutional infirmities of the present
'agreement.' I think this can be done
without the necessity of invoking the
'treaty' process I expect that
something of this nature will be under-
taken in the new Congress."
Governor Dewey is reported in the
press to have plans for financing the
power features of the project by a New
York State bond issue if Congress fails
to act favorably. It is difficult to see
just how this can be accomplished, for
while the State Department might be
able to negotiate a "treaty" or an
"agreement" with Canada for New
York, the cost for power would be
higher per horsepower, for the control
dam at Morrisburg and the dam at
Barnhart Island could not be eliminated
and would all be chargeable against
ST. LAWRENCE SEAWAY
(Continued from page 15)
power. As far as navigation is con-
cerned the bottle neck would not be
eliminated.
The opposition to the project as a
whole comes from power interests along
the Chicago Drainage Canal and the
Illinois River, from railroads between
Chicago and the eastern seaboard and
from those interested in transshipping
from lake boats at Buffalo and Oswego,
New York to railroads and canal barges
and similar operators at Boston and
New York where ocean going cargoes
are again transferred to ocean steamers.
As the Seaway is planned it is esti-
mated that the annual or seven months
per year tonnage could be 26,000,000
tons, of which one half would be allo-
cated to each of the countries involved.
The prewar estimated saving per ton
is $5.00. This would mean a saving to
industry in the United States portion of
the Great Lakes Basin of $65,000,000
per year. The prewar estimate of ad-
ministration, operation and amortization
is less than $20,000,000 annually, leav-
ing a net annual saving in transporta-
tion costs of $45,000,000. If only one
half of this amount were saved annually,
say $22,500,000 and could be applied
to amortization, the total cost would
be paid off in less than ten years, pro-
vided money saved was considered as
equivalent to money earned.
Very probably there will be a surplus
of available ocean going cargo vessels
for some time after the war, but no one
denies had the Seaway been available
at the outbreak of the war, Great Lakes
shipbuilding companies could have de-
livered larger completed ships to the
Atlantic Seaboard than they were able
to do with the present 14 foot depth
locks and canals in the International
Section, and the present 9 foot deep
Chicago drainage canal to the Missis-
sippi.
An interesting equation was devel-
oped by government engineers on the
probable amount of goods that would be
offered for transportation if the Seaway
were available and the rates cheaper.
Taking note that the Seaway area is
that portion of the United States around
the Great Lakes from which transporta-
tion could normally flow to the Seaway
rather than to the Pacific, the Atlantic
or the Gulf, if by so doing cheaper
transportation to the seaboard could be
had, the equation follows:
Exports by the Seaway
Total Exports by U.S.
Production in Seaway Area
Production in the L'.S.
A similar equation can be set up for
estimated imports, all factors known ex-
cept exports and imports. By this
method prewar estimates placed the
annual tonnage at 23,000,000 tons; re-
ducing this to 13,000,000 tons for rea-
sons of conservatism, we arrive at the
tonnage quota allocated to the United
States.
As said above there has been opposi-
tion on the part of the railroads. The
Seaway will be a transportation unit.
It would be purblind folly for our coun-
try to add something to the existing
transportation system that will not be
used, or that might wreck long estab-
lished transportation properties. But it
would be equally foolish to refuse to
make studies ways to improve the
overall transportation system of the
country. No commercial concern dares
to adopt a static policy relative to dis-
tribution of its goods, nor should any
important governmental department,
having to do with the cycle of opera-
tions going to make up a completed
transaction between the producer of
raw material and a satisfied user of a
fabricated article, do so. Competition
between industry at home and abroad
is too keen to be ignored.
The St. Lawrence Seaway has been
under consideration for 25 years, and
one might say under construction as
well, for the new Welland Canal, the
improvements to connecting channels,
the new McArthur Lock and the power
dams below the International Section
are all a part of the plan for a 27 foot
deep 80 foot wide waterway from Du-
luth to the Atlantic Ocean.
It has been analyzed for engineering
and economic feasibility and while
there has been able and sincere opposi-
tion throughout, its proponents are
more confident today than at any time
in the past. Considering its cost, its
international character, the proportion
of population and invested capital lo-
cated in the geographical area which
will be served with cheaper trans-
portation, and the 2,000,000 horse power
which will be developed, it takes rank
among the post war improvements un-
der consideration in the United States
today.

All Napoleon needed
was one spotter plane...
Napoleon was a hot shot artilleryman! His cannoneers had hairy ears... but
better reconnaissance would have saved his bacon . . . and his empire!
One little "Spotter Plane" might have changed the face of Europe
. . . and our destiny.
Every ingredient of the spotter plane that Napoleon needed was on earth then.
The only reason the plane itself didn't exist was because men had not learned to
"Imagineer" the things they needed.
"Imagineering" is a word we invented to describe the way Alcoa, and other great
groups of technical men and women, go about the job of supplying the materials,
methods and machines of modern life.
Remember this word "Imagineering". It represents the union of imagination, man's
oldest mental development, and engineering, his newest. Together they are the key to
progress. Together they are the engineer's contribution to mankind.

about the hardest metal made by man
AMAZING FACT NO. 1—Carboloy Cemented
Carbide starts out as a mixture of simple
metallic powders! Under heat and pressure,
it is transformed into a super-hard metal
—in an endless variety of shapes and
forms—for machine tools, dies and wear-
proofed parts.
AMAZING TACT NO. 2—The hardest metal
made by man works at speeds once thought
impossibly high! It has what it takes to
machine today's super-tough alloys to tol-
erances never before possible in mass pro-
duction. It commonly doubles, even triples,
the output of machines and men.
AMAZING FACT NO. 3—Carboloy Cemented
Carbide has literally revolutionized produc-
tion—in the forming of sheet metal, and
in drawing wire and tubing, as well as in
machining operations. It has cleared serious
bottlenecks in vital war industries—speed-
ing tank, aircraft and ammunition produc-
tion, and naval building programs.
AMAZING FACT NO. 4—This miracle metal
is one of the most wear-resistant materials
known. This characteristic, of great value
during the war, will open up countless new
peacetime uses. Examples — valves, gauges,
guides, machine parts—and non-industrial
uses such as wear-resistant guides for deep
sea fishing rods.
Increased output - lower costs - for you
KGHT NOW, in your present shop set-
up, Carboloy Cemented Carbide
will step up production of vitally needed
war materials.
At the same time your organization
will gain valuable experience for the
peacetime competitive battle to come—
in which success will depend upon
ability to build better products, in larger
volume, at lower costs.
And remember this—in many cases
Carboloy Cemented Carbide tools ac-
tually cost less than far less efficient
materials for corresponding uses.

hold his ears with his hands because he
had to take care of the hot shells, so he
had to stand the noise till the end of
the firing practice, during which time
the sound seemed to echo back and
forth inside of his head. Bill says that
now he knows when to keep his mouth
shut.
Bill says that he found M.P.3 the
toughest course to keep awake in. The
fact that it was an eight o'clock didn't
help the situation in the least. However,
he could not fall asleep as "the prof,
was too nice a fellow to do that to." He
also had to stay awake for the sake of
the rest of the follows in the class as
they all fell asleep before he did, and
as soon as the prof, would see that the
whole class was asleep he would stop the
lecture and wake them up.
Bill has several nicknames among
which are "Whitey," "Pierpont" and
"Bull-Moose." He says that the boys
call him Bull-Moose because of the way
he plays basketball. He played football
in high school and was on the first team
in his senior year. He also likes bowl-
ing.
After the war Bill intends to come
back here to get his Master's Degree in
Industrial Engineering—conditions per-
mitting. Like everyone else, Bill says
that he will be sorry to leave here. He
says that he is "just picking up the lit-
tle details of the place, and learning
how to get around." He also is just be-
ginning to find out what nice fellows
some of the profs are.
As a parting remark, Bill said the
only thing he does not like about Michi-
gan women is that they aren't in En-
gine School. He's sorry he didn't start
here three years later now that we are
getting so many women engineers in the
freshman classes.

It took a little hunting, but we have
finally found an engineering student
who always wears a tie! He is none
other than Francis X. Nutto, who is un-
doubtedly one of the ''sharpest" dressed

Needless to say, this is not his only
claim to fame. "F.X." has an excellent

ics, and has helped many a student to

Vibration problems are especially fasci-
nating to him, and it is an indisputable
fact that he really does "know the stuff
cold."
Mr. Nutto entered the University of
Michigan in 1941, after graduating from
Grosse Pointe Woods, the "community
of which Detroit is a suburb.'' He cam;
to Ann Arbor because, as he says, "It
is near' enough to me to be convenient,
but far enough away to put one on his
own.'' After surviving eight terms here,
he still believes that Michigan is the
very best of schools, with perhaps one
exception: the weather leaves much to
be desired. When he receives his degree
in Engineering Mechanics this Febru-
ary, he will enter the firm of Vickers,
Inc., manufacturers of hydraulic equip-
ment.
Besides being an ambitious engineer-
ing student, F.X. participates in num-
erous extra-curricular activities. At
present he holds the position of vice-
president of the Engineering Council,
and is also the chairman of the Engi-
neering Honor Council.

love of music probably explains his ex-

Francis is a member of the La
Chi Alpha fraternity, and devotes mi
of his spare time in fulfilling his inm
erable obligations as acting treasn
secretary, and rushing chairman of
organization. Last year the office;
treasurer and steward kept him well
cupied.
His ambition is to retire at fifty,
spend his summers in Detroit and
winters at his family's ten-acre gr
fruit orchard in Texas. F.X. brags
his grapefruit are so sweet that they
be eaten without sugar! Although
seems to be an early age to retire,
must remember that Francis starlet
work when he was only sixteen,
enough, his first job was selling
grams at Motor City Speedway, w
is certainly a far cry from engineer!
F.X. Nutto is one of the many

FlRE was both a tool and a limitation for the ancients. With it
they made things of tin and lead, silver and gold. But their fires
were never hot enough for the sterner metals.
Man's progress through the ages has been accelerated each
time he has learned to create and control a higher temperature.
With the electric arc came heat hotter than any fire. And. by
means of carbon or graphite electrodes —developed by research
of National Carbon Company, Inc., a Unit of UCC—man put
tin- electric arc to work in furnaces such as the one you see above.
Born in the terrific heat of the electric furnace are many of
the alloy steels used in ships, trains, planes and other equipment.
and also the ferro-alloys that give strength, toughness, hardness
— or the quality of being stainless —to these steels. These mate-
rial—and the intense heat that produces them —are vitally nec-
essary to American industrial progress.
Coming from the electric furnace—in addition to alloy steels and ferro-
alloys—are phosphorus, abrasives, calcium carbide for acetylene used for
ueldtng and cutting, and many special alloys.
For further information write for booklet I*-2, "The Story of the Carbon
Arc". . . there is no obligation.

trial research is employed by all of
these manufacturers, for the improve-
ment of their respective products. The
railroads themselves, however, do em-
ploy some research, and often when
they do not initiate it, they inspire and
guide it.
As early as 1873 a competitive trial
of an air brake and a vacuum brake was
arranged by the Master Car Builders'
Association. A great deal of testing and
studying was done, and, after eliminat-
ing other brakes, the air brake was
chosen for a standard in 1887. A proj-
ect was carried out in 1875 when an-
other Railway Association tested iron
and steel axles for stiffness and endur-
ance. As a result of these tests, steel
was found to be the most suitable. This
pattern of testing materials has been
used many times since in determining
physical properties of the construction
metals.
One well-known testing agency em-
ployed is the locomotive test plant at
Altoona, Pa., which was originally in-
stalled at the St. Louis Exposition in
1904. This plant has long been invalu-
able in supplying data on steam produc-
tion, fuel requirements, horsepower de-
veloped in the cylinder, and drawbar

pull, as well as many internal functions
of the engine. Many changes have been
effected in locomotive design as a result
of this extensive research.
An example of other industries con-
tributing to the progress of the rail-
roads is seen by considering railway sig-
nals. The track circuit, for instance, is
the basis of automatic block signaling.
Its control and power supply have been
subjects of study for a long while. The
demand for improved signals led to the
development of lights that could be seen
by day as well as night, and even to the
production of a yellow-colored glass that
could easily be distinguished from the
conventional red and green.
The demand for steel rails that would
not crack led to more careful operations
at the rolling mills where they were
made, as well as a device that would ac-
curately locate fissures in the rails. The
demand for wooden ties that would last
longer than four or five years resulted
in the wood-preserving industry, treated
ties now lasting 25 years or more.
Many other improvements in rail-
ways have originated in industries not
devoted solely to the railway market.
Manufacturers of steel, nonferrous met-
als, chemicals, and rubber, and pro-

ducers of electrical equipment, internal
combustion engines, roller bearings, and
air conditioning equipment have all con-
tributed. Alloy steel and light metals
have resulted in great savings in weight,
rubber is used for insulation against vi-
bration, and rolled bearings account
for smooth rolling of passenger cars.
The Diesel-electric locomotive is now-
proving its worth in all types of service.
Research is being conducted con-
stantly in order to improve the rail-
roads in service, economy, and safety.
The problem of balancing reciprocating
parts is now being studied extensively.
The results should materially affect de-
signs and performance of the locomo-
tive. Another current project is that of
the application of the wireless for head-
to-rear communication on trains, as well
as train to roadside communication.
In March, 1944, Clyde Williams, di-
rector of the Battelle Memorial Insti-
tute, was appointed as technical consult-
ant to advise the Association of Ameri-
can Railroads on matters concerning
technological improvements. And thus,
in many ways, the railroads are taking
direct steps today to insure that intensi-
fied research continues.

television station
A new television station has been de-
signed under the direction of a promi-
nent Michigan grad. J. K. Gannet.
'10E, director of Engineering and Re-
search of the Austin Company is re-
sponsible for the station which is shown
here in model form.

Model of new station
A combination one-and-two story
structure of striking modern design, this
dual control multi-purpose station in-
cludes one large studio with 44-foot
movable stages, and two smaller studios
which are served by a common set of
controls on a pivoting control platform.
Offices, dressing rooms, work shops and
storage facilities axe located on the
ground floor surrounding the studios,
while the second story is devoted to con-
trol rooms, broadcasting equipment,
sponsors' lounges and public observation
areas.
The large studio stage moves to right
or left on a track for speedy changes of
scenes. Its control and observation fa-
cilities have been arranged so that a
turntable stage and independent seating
areas on either side of a central con-
trol room make possible rapid changes
of both scenes and audiences. The new
design provides seating of sponsors and
the public in lounges on either side of
the control room.
The aim of the designers has been to
provide for extreme flexibility to avoid
unnecessary duplication of costly broad-
casting equipment. The control rooms
serving the large studio and the two
small studios are located back to back,
(Continued from page 34)
in a manner which permits centralized
installation of cables and wiring. The
first floor area below the observation
rooms has been laid out to facilitate
transfer of cameras and microphones
from one studio to another, so that a
minimum of standby equipment will be
required.
injection molding
A new continuous injection molding
and extruding machine has been de-
veloped by Chrysler engineers. This
versatile machine makes possible the
fabrication of molded sections of many
types of thermoplastics and thermo-
setting plastics, and real and synthetic
rubber at a rate which has never before
been approached. Among the articles
produced by the machine are seamless
plastic rocket tubes, rubber insulators
and corrosion resistant plastic tubing.
The largest item which has been pro-
duced is a plastic battery case made
from thermosetting plastics weighing
eight pounds molded in just five min-
utes. Xo other machine is known
capable of injection molding an article
of this material weighing more than five
pounds. It has produced at one mold-
ing in less than three minutes as many
as 144 rubber insulators. It is also
capable of producing precision rubber
parts for airplane motors and other war
products.
The potentialities of the machine in
the tubing field are especially signifi-
cant. Thermosetting plastic tubes of
any length whatever can be made to be
used for underground and overhead
pipelines. When iron or steel must be
used to obtain necessary rigidity thermo-
setting liners produced by this machine
would provide resistance to corrosion.
The feature of this machine which
constitutes such a radical departure
from conventional types is the worm
screw which forces the material into the
die and makes the process truly con-
tinuous. The two types of molding ma-
chines which this development is expect-
ed to replace are the compression and
the injection or plunger types.

THADC.MANK »IO U. S. NT. OFF
TAPIREO ROLLER REARMS
Design, material and manufacturing precision are all vital factors
in the outstanding success of the Timken Tapered Roller Bearing;
but our engineering experience in applying Timken Bearings to
every kind of mechanical equipment — extending over more than
three decades — is of equal importance in assuring consistently
superior performance wherever Timken Bearings are used.
Just as we pioneered the tapered roller bearing itself, so we have
pioneered its use in industry after industry, until today there is
hardly a single industry or type of equipment in which Timken
Bearings are not employed and preferred for their versatility in
eliminating friction; carrying radial, thrust and combined loads;
and holding moving parts in correct and constant alignment.
Through many years of adapting Timken Bearings to thousands of
different kinds of machines, we have learned how to make the
utmost of their varied abilities; how to take full advantage of
their unusual qualities. The value of this experience to the de-
signing engineer cannot be overemphasized; it cannot be bought;
but when your student days are over and you enter the industrial
field as a graduate engineer, our combined experience in design-
ing, manufacturing and applying Timken Tapered Roller Bear-
ings will be at your disposal to help you solve your bearing pro-
blems, whatever they may be. Furthermore, we stand back of every
Timken Bearing application that is approved by our Engineer-
ing Department. It must work to the complete satisfaction of
the user. The Timken Roller Bearing Company. Canton 6, Ohio.

Under the compression molding meth-
od plastic or rubber is placed in a die
by hand, and pressed into shape by
clamping another die to it. To insure
adequate material in the finished product
more than enough plastic or rubber is
inserted in the die cavities. Under
pressure the excess material forces itself
out through cracks where the die faces
join, causing flash, or waste material,
which must be trimmed at a loss of ma-
terial and time.
The ordinary "one shot" injection
machine, which was an advancement
over the compression type, eliminates
Hash waste, but is limited in the size
of parts it can produce and is much
slower than the new machine. With the
continuous injection machine only the
quantities of plastics or rubbers needed
are injected into dies already clamped
together, eliminating flash and saving
time and materials and cutting costs of
production. Although it is capable of
making plastic and rubber parts larger
and faster than the two other types of
machines the new version weighs but
6,000 pounds, one-twelfth as much as
one of the other types and is approxi-
mately one-third as large.
The worm gear used is identical in
principle with the worm of a furnace
stoker. To insure evenly mixed and
heated plastic material it is necessary to
introduce turbulence in the heating
chamber. With these refinements the
molding machine was brought to a stage
where it could make outstanding con-
tributions in our war production pro-
gram.

weed killer
... In a new farm implement which has
recently been patented, weeds are killed
by sheets of flame instead of the con-
ventional steel blades. The flames
spread flat, killing the low weeds, but
have little effect on the tall stalks of
crops like cotton, cane and corn. After
the weeds have wilted and died, they
form a light mulch which protects the
surface of the soil.
EAST HALL
(Continued from page 11)
In an endeavor to uncover some of
the virtues of East Hall we consulted
some of its hardy occupants. It is com-
mon knowledge that East Hall is in-
habited by a few famous mathemati-
cians and a few infamous English pro-

fessors. The trend of our conversation
with one of the latter seemed to indicate
that tears would not be shed in large
quantities if it were to sink without a
trace into the rich soil on which it
stands. Unfortunately, however, this
sturdy structure shows no sign of doing
so, being one of the most persistent
buildings on the campus. One distinc-
tive feature of E. H., he revealed, was
the swaybacked roofs and floors. Far
from being detrimental, this property of
E. H. has proved to be of great utili-
tarian value for it has reached such an
advanced state that when anything is
dropped upon the floor it is only neces-
sary to go to the center of the room to
find it. The ventilation system is also
quite unique, the cracks in the wall
being quite adequate to supply large
quantities of fresh air. The situation as
a whole, we are informed, would be
quite desirable if it were confined to the
offices of the professors. Our confidant
suspects very strongly, though, that the
students are seizing the opporunity of
evading his lectures by slipping unno-
ticed through these ventilating ducts.
.Nevertheless, he expressed the desire to
see East Hall reduced to a mass of Irish
confetti which would be used as am-
munition to keep the lawyers from tres-
passing on the holy soil of the Engi-
neering College.
The day may come when this proph-
esy will materialize for we are reliably
informed that the University is plan-
ning to erect a new building on the site
where East Hall now stands. Yes sir,
a new wing is to be added to the East
Engineering building as a part of the
post war building program. Ten years
hence clear old East Hall may exist only
in the memories of us old timers. Per-
haps we may even wax sentimental, for
after all, through these portals have
passed some of the best damn engineers
on earth.
INDUSTRIAL
{Continued from page 17)
incorporate small, inexpensive stones
bonded in metal are cheap but effective
tools. The tool consists of the bit (a
ring of special alloy studded with a hun-
dred or more small bortz diamonds)
attached to the ends of tubular steel
drills. These drills are rotated by power
and cut through quartz and granite
tough enough to demolish the hardest
steel. They are used not only in core
drilling but also may eventually replace
the air drill in drilling long holes. The
increased accuracy and control of the
diamond core bit practically eliminates
the dust which gives rise to silicosis.
Statistics on the use of diamond drills
in the province of Ontario indicate that
about 350 miles of drill holes were
bored in 1936. The drillers used 100.-
000 carats of industrial diamonds,
largely bortz, varying in size from V,,,-
Vi carat. It is reported that in 1940
three Canadian mining companies drilled
37 mile of holes in breaking down ore.
During the same year, contractors in
Canada alone drilled 459 miles.
Small air-operated diamond-impreg-
nated saws are used in taking samples of
ore from mines.
Diamond dust, soft and white as face
powder in appearance, is used primar-
ily as an abrasive, either free for lap-
ping or polishing, or fixed in a tool or
wheel. The consumption of diamond
powder has recently increased due to the
development of diamond grinding wheels
and the slitting, edging and polishing of
quartz crystals for the Signal Corps.
Diamonds in the form of crushing
bortz are the cutting constituent for
grinding wheels employed in the finish-
ing of cemented tungsten and tantalum
carbides. The need for forming, shap-
ing and re-sharpening cemented carbide
tools led to the development of bonded
diamond wheels.
Domestic central-heating plants fitted
with automatic oil burners are exten-
sively used. The abrasive action of the
oil spray enlarges the fine nozzle holes
in a relatively short time. Diamonds
frequently serve as nozzles on these fur-
naces and as Diesel engine injectors.
Though this survey of the applica-
tions of diamonds is far from compre-
hensive, the major uses have been indi-
cated. It can be seen, however, that in-
dustry has ingeniously converted the
luxury stone into a contributor to better
living in time of peace and surer victory
in war.

thermostat saves five
pounds of weight
The weight of dynamotors for air-
plane radios has been cut in half by the
use of a recently developed thermostat.
According to radio engineers, the weight
of the dynamotors can be cut from 12
to 7^2 pounds if the dynamotor were
not operated continuously. It is the
purpose of the thermostat to keep the
dynamotor from running continuously
by disconnecting it from the line when
it gets too hot.
Another innovation which has de-
creased the weight of the dynamotors is
the shortening of the core. In order to
get the same output the speed of one
type of dynamotor was increased from
6000 to 9000 rpm.
B-29 electrical central control
gunnery control system
The central control gunnery system
in use on the Army Air Forces B-29's
is making it possible to carry out long
range missions against the Japanese
without fighter escorts. With this new
system it is possible to fire the many
turret guns from the centrally located
pressurized cabin of the ship. All the
gunner has to do is get the enemy
fighter in his sight and pull the trigger.
The turret guns are sighted automatic-
ally by remote control. Electronic and
mechanical brain-like devices in the sys-
tem make corrections for lead, gravity,
windage and parallax, aiming the guns
so that the path of the bullets will rip
through the enemy plane.
decrease in weight of air-
cooled transformers continues
Changes in core material and method
of assembly have resulted in over a 60
per cent decrease in the weight of air-
cooled transformers in the last six years.
Instead of building the core up by hand
of individual punchings, Westinghouse
now winds Hipersil into a coil to form
the core. The core is then cut,apart;
the coils are inserted, and the two sec-
tions are placed together again with a
bond between and are tightly strapped.
precipitrons in railroad cars
In post-war railroad passenger cars,
the air may be as clean as in a Maine
woods. In cars equipped with electro-
static air cleaners, cinders, soot, and
road dust will be removed before the
air goes through the air-conditionins;
system. Tobacco smoke no longer need
annoy nonsmokers. With precipitrons
every car can be a smoking car. An
experimental car of a progressive East-
ern railroad is being equipped with a
specially built precipitron. This unit
borrows heavily from the experience
gained with a unit installed before the
war in a deluxe railroad car used in
the West. The unit^^gggvergajii de-
signed to go just-tinder the roof at the
end of the car instead of vertically in
one section of a washroom. Also a sim-
plified and more Dositiyesvstem of oil-

IN THE BOEING WIND TUNNEL
• The aCSP" Spherical Roller Thrust
Bearing.
Here's an electronically controlled
Variable Speed Coupling that's in
the middle of a tough job in the
Boeing Wind Tunnel. It's located
between the 18,000 h.p. synchron-
ous motor and the 24-foot, seven-
ton fan. Thus, it is possible to
maintain any desired speed within
one-tenth of one revolution per min-
ute ... to reach a maximum horse-
power of 18,000 at 500 r.p.m.
Dynamatic engineers selected aKfF
Bearings for this unit. They used
the new fflCSlF Spherical Roller
Thrust Bearing to carry full pro-
peller thrust load. Consequently,
they made certain of high bearing
capacity, complete self-alignment
and low friction for dependable per-
formance at all times —even under
the most adverse operating condi-
tions. The tougher the job, the
stronger the proof that aCSiF puts
the right bearing in the right place.

The Black Widow P-61 night fighter
has a top turret, source of its deadly
"sting." While many of the actual per-

nacelle, houses four .50 caliber machine
guns. This system can be controlled by
either a gunner in the rear compartment
or a gunner in the front compartment,
located behind and above the pilot's

a-c systems for planes
At Wright Field, during the closing
weeks of 1944, engineers were busy get-

"on the ground." It represents the work
of design engineers over a period of
months to produce the numerous com-
ponents required for the much-discussed
400-cycle alternating-current power sys-
tem for the planes of tomorrow. Be-
cause the operation of each generator,
motor, switch, relay, and wiring is ef-
fected by the operation of all members
of a group, it is desirable to test the
system as a whole on the ground before
sending up a 400-cycle equipped ship.

high wind-pressure tunnel
speeds turbine blade tests
A new type wind tunnel has been de-
signed for testing turbine blades. In-
stead of using the present system blades
at extremely high velocities the new
tunnel gets the same results at much
lower velocities by making use of Rey-
nold's number and increasing the pres-
sure to 220 pounds instead of atmos-
pheric. This makes it possible to use
wooden models instead of expensive and
hard to make steel models. In doing
this it cuts down on the time required
to make a test from weeks to hours.
This allows a great many variations to
be tried quickly, greatly expediting the
final designs, which can be tested by the
slower, but more precise high-speed tun-
nel.

LIGHT ON THE RISfWG SWW
Keeping Navy searchlight r. 11.. tors
spotlessly clean is an unending job.
The Haines Slellite alloy, from uln.li
many reflectors arc made, is so hard
that constant cleaning and polishing
will not mar its surface.
Uncle Sam's Navy has the most efficient searchlights
on tlie Seven Seas. They are so powerful that one of
them measuring 24 inches across can shoot a heani of
light through 23 miles of inky darkness.
The reflectors of these searchlights are made of an
alloy perfected and produced by Haynes Stellite
Company, a Unit of UCC.
The Navy is using this Haynes Stellite alloy for sev-
eral reasons. It will not shatter from shock of gunfire.
It has high resistance to corrosion by salt air, salt spray,
powder and sulfur fumes. It withstands the terrific heat
of the arc light—and hot particles of copper and carbon
from the electrodes do not cause it to pit and lose its
reflectivity. Searchlight reflectors are indicative of the
many applications to which Haynes Stellite alloys—with
their unique combinations of properties — can bring
more efficient performance.
Haynes Slellite alloys hate long been used for scientific mirrors,
surgical and dental instruments and other equipment requiring
great resistance to corrosion, near and heat. Unending research
by L'CC is constantly adding to the variety oj these alloys. They
can be produced in many exacting shapes —in quantity— and de-
livered ready jor assembly without jurlher finishing.
Consulting engineers, production munagers, educators and
designers are invited to send jor booklet P-3 describing the
properties of Haynes Stellite alloys.

Microscopes are gunsights in Medicine's
battle on bacteria.
Optical microscopes, however, were not
powerf ul enough to "draw an accurate bead"
on the deadly virus that caused influenza.
But today, medical men have seen what
no optical microscope could bring into
focus—the infinitesimal influenza virus that
previously had lain craftily camouflaged
among larger cells.
This revelation came about through the
Electron Microscope, developed by scien-
tists at RCA Laboratories. And now, having
been seen, influenza may be forced to un-
conditional surrender, saving the lives of
thousands each year.
Here is but one facet of the genius shown
by scientists behind RCA research ... the
"ever-onward" research that saves lives or
creates a better radio with equal skill...
the "there-when-you-need-it" research that
gave super-secret equipment to the United
Nations... the "way-ahead" research that
goes into everything made by RCA.
When you buy an RCA radio or phono-

The flexibility of x-ray inspection is
illustrated by a plant making light
metal parts for aircraft. Some parts
are small and thin, others are thick
and of considerable size. Obviously, a
single x-ray exposure will not show de-
fects in both parts. The problem was
solved by providing two x-ray ma-
chines, astride the conveyor line and
spaced with respect to the trays loaded
with parts to be inspected. One ma-
chine makes an exposure for the heavy-
density parts as the other machine
makes a simultaneous exposure for the
thinner parts. Furthermore, the opera-
tion can be made automatic, with the
heavy lead walls of the unit closing
about the part when the exposure is
made. If production should be shifted
so that only heavy parts are placed in
one tray and light ones in the next, the
x-ray machines can be easily reset to
meet this situation because no longer
are lead-lined rooms needed for per-
sonal protection.

longer life for high
speed tool motors
The life of high speed tool motors
has been greatly extended—without
making any basic changes—by re-exam-
ination of every tiny detail of their de
sign and construction. Motors for small
drills, grinders, routers, and the like are
of the universal type and run at 8000
to 10,000 rpm. fully loaded. When the
load is removed, the speed jumps to
20,000 rpm., which imposes severe cen-
trifugal stresses on the rotating parts.
In such service, motors may last only
a few hours or a few hundred hours
depending on the severity of service.
The problem of the high-speed tool-
motor designer—like that of the design-
er of automobiles for racing—is to make
a seemingly small improvement here, a
slight modification there, which in the
aggregate lead to overall improvemem
in the strenuous service intended. For
example, a thermosetting high-temper-
ature varnish with a durable, moisture-
resistant surface has been developed
that is extremely resistant to vibration.

- how often you were without electric
power for hours after a severe electric
storm?
Among the many reasons why you get
almost uninterrupted service today is this
glass gadget that looks like an over-size

time lightning arrester whisks the harmful

the- line goes back to normal operation.
The lightning arrester body is built by
Corning out of a special Corning-devel-

youropinion of glass if you always thought
of it as a frail, brittle material. You'll find
hundreds of such surprises at Corning
today. Glass pumps, for example, and
heavy glass fractionating columns for
chemical industries. Airfield runway
marker lenses capable of bearing the
weight of a plane. Corrosion - resistant
glass pipe for the food and other indus-

glass can do better than other
materials, thanks to Coming's
nearly 100 years of glass-making
experience. Corning, like every-

and Metallurgical Engineering
Although fractionating columns are
widely used in many industrial processes
such as the manufacture of synthetic
rubber, the production of synthetic
toluene, and the production of aviation
gasoline, the effect of many design vari-
ables on the performance is incomplete-
ly known. Consequently, a fractionating
column of sufficient size to give results
comparable to those of a commercial
installation but small enough to allow
convenient operation is an essential part
of a chemical engineering laboratory.
Such a column permits the students to
become familiar with equipment de-
scribed in the classroom by actual op-
eration in the laboratory and, at the
same time, allows them to obtain quan-
titative data and to observe the effect
of various design features by visual in-
spection.
A fractionating column is a device for
the countercurrent contacting of liquid
and vapor streams so as to obtain both
the transfer of heat and the transfer of
material from one stream to the other.
Although many types of columns have
been developed, the one most frequently
used is known as the plate column. In
this type, contact between the streams
is obtained by bubbling the vapor,
which is rising upward, through the
liquid on the plate. The liquid is flow-
ing in a horizontal direction across the
plate during the time it is in contact
with the vapor and then flows over a
weir and into a downspout to the plate
below. The compositions of the vapor
and liquid streams are continually
changing as the streams progress
through the column, the amount of the
more volatile components in the vapor
increasing as the vapor rises while the
amount of the less volatile components
in the liquid increases as the liquid
descends. A fractionating column or a
combination of such columns may be
used to separate a mixture of two or
more volatile substances into the indi-
vidual components or into other mix-
tures having certain specified properties.

Fig. 1. View of fractionating column.
In order to operate a fractionating
column certain auxiliary equipment is re-
quired. The vapor rising through the col-
umn must be generated by supplying heat
must be generated by supplying heat
at the bottom of the column through
suitable heat transfer surfaces. This
portion of the equipment is known as
the "reboiler" or "still." Similarly, a
source of liquid must be supplied to the
top of the column and is obtained by
condensing the vapors leaving the top
of the column in a condenser and re-
turning a portion of the liquid to the
column.
Prior to the war, the Operations Lab-
oratory of the Department of Chemical
and Metallurgical Engineering had a
steel fractionating column containing
only three plates. Plans to modify this
column, including the construction of
additional plates, were under way dur-
ing 1942 but the requirements of the
war industries for steel forced the aban-
donment of these plans. The restricted
production of civilian goods by the
equipment manufacturers and the short-
age of critical materials made it obvious
that if the laboratory were to have a
suitable column the Department would
have to build it from scrap material.
There was but one answer. The labor-
atory column would have to be made
of cast iron. It was thought possible
that the auxiliary equipment could be
obtained by the conversion of one of
our experimental evaporators which was
no longer being used. The evaporator
body and tube bundle could be used for

denser could be used as the condenser
for the column. The cast iron shell re-
maining would supply the major portion
of the scrap metal necessary for the
column sections. The Department of

In spite of the intimate dependence
of our daily life on innumerable inven-
tions, the monetary value of new
inventions is usually quite unpredict-
able and is often, therefore, a matter
of opinion. In this connection it is
sometimes implied that inventors, as a
class, are inclined to place an excessive
value on their inventions. This is quite
likely to be true of an inventor whose
invention is outside of the field of his
trade or profession and who therefore
may lack the right yardstick for meas-
uring its value. On the other hand, a
manufacturer owning an invention,
whether made by himself or assigned
to him by someone else, may be ex-
pected to look at it with a more critical
eye. To him the value of an invention
resides very often in its chances of im-
mediate commercial success, and money
spent on a commercially untried inven-
tion may be an unwise investment, par-
ticularly for a man with limited capi-
tal.
Patent Protection Must Be
Sought Promptly
This may explain why manufacturers
have often put valuable inventions on
the market without taking the obvious
step of first patenting them. If an in-
vention is a commercial failure, money
spent to patent it may be wasted. If
it sells well, however, it is eventually
seized by competitors, and then its
originator may realize that the few
hundred dollars that a patent would
cost might be well spent. Often the
question was raised, alas, too late, for
the patent statutes require inventors to
seek patent protection promptly. The
latest that a patent application may now
be filed is one year after the invention
has been in public use or on sale in
this country for the first time, but a
delay of two years was permitted up
to a little over a year ago. Failure to
comply with this requirement renders
the resulting patent invalid. To avoid
any confusion, it may be stated that the
public use or sale refers to an embodi-
ment of the invention; the statute
makes no reference to sales of rights
to an invention.
by
D. JOURNEAUX
Patent Attorney for Allis-Chalmers
A requirement of this nature, far
from being an imposition, is really a
concession to inventors. Any delay in
applying for a patent defers the time at
which the inventor will have to relin-
quish the invention to the public. Under
most circumstances, the allowed time
cannot be extended; and, as with other
laws, ignorance of patent laws is no
excuse. If an inventor, after his inven-
tion has been on the market for one
year with or without his consent, has
not applied for a patent, it will be pre-
sumed that he does not desire it. His
failure to apply for a patent is taken
as evidence of his intent to abandon his
invention to the public.
It recent years it has been rather in-
frequent for patentees to see their pat-
ents invalidated by premature sales of
their inventions. Apparently prospec-
tive patentees nowadays are well
coached by their counsel as to the legal
requirements. These requirements, of
which the full import could only be
guessed toward the end of the last cen-
tury, have now been clarified by numer-
ous court decisions. The efforts of tardy
patentees to prove that their inventions
were not on sale outside of the permis-
sible period have caused the courts to
look into a sufficient variety of circum-
stances of sales to satisfy even the most
fastidious inquirer.
Inventions On Sale
One of the earliest principles estab-
lished by the courts in this connection
is that an invention is to be considered
"on sale" riot only when it is sold but
even when it is merely offered for sale
until it has been completed by being at
least tried out with all its elements or,
in the language of the courts, "reduced
to practice."
It is reasonable enough to disregard
offers to sell an invention before it has
been fully tested and found satisfactory.
The language of the statute seems to
indicate that the sales it refers to are
only those that may lead to immediate
use of the invention by the public. But
even a very simple invention is apt to
have fatal defects or disadvantages
which may not be obvious upon casual
casual inspection. A final test of the in-
vention may show the need of consider-
able modification, in which any "sale"
made before test is reduced to a mere
prophecy. Any "sale" of an untried in-
vention is therefore questionable.
Invention Exposed For Sale
To establish that an invention was
on sale, it is not necessary to prove
any offer to sell to any particular per-
son. One sample of the wagon jack,
shown in Fig. 1, was exposed for sale
in a hardware store in 1888, more than
two years before its inventor applied for
a patent in 1890. The jack may or may
not have been offered to any customer
in 1888, and in fact it was sold only
in 1899. But its mere display was suf-
ficient to cause the patent to be invali-
dated in a suit terminated in 1901. The
patentee's contention in the suit was
that the jack had not yet been made
at the time it was supposed to be on
sale. This defense was original and
would possibly have been successful but
for the fact that it was disproved by
the testimony of credible witnesses.
Invention On Price List
Although an article can be "on sale"
only after at least one sample of it has
been made, it is not necessary that the
object itself be shown to prospective
buyers.
This became apparent as early as
1883 from litigation involving the roller
skate shown in Fig. 3. Its inventor,
the pioneer in the invention of "parlor
skates" as they were then called, had
already made skates having their wheel
bearings mounted on brackets through
inclined pivots so that the wheels would
cock in response to shifting of the
weight of the skater to take curves.
The skate in suit was an improvement
of this earlier skate, differing from it
in details. The inventor included it in
a price list which he distributed early
in 1863, more than two years before he
applied for a patent covering its im-
proved construction. This was one of
the reasons for which his patent was
ultimately held invalid.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

In many respects the patent laws
make no distinctions between the so-
called mechanical patents, which are
the only patents known to most people,
and the less familiar design patents,
such as those illustrated in Figs. 2 and
5, which are used to protect ornamental
designs. The restriction of sales before
patent application applies equally to
both kinds of patents and was fatal to
the design patent covering the lamp post
shown in Fig. 2. The patentee applied
for his patent in 1878, but unfortunate-
ly it was proved in a suit decided in
1880 that another manufacturer had
submitted the same design to a town-
ship in 1875. Only a drawing was ex-
hibited with an offer to sell the lamp
posts, but lamp posts differing from
that offered to the township only in an
immaterial detail had already been
made. The design was therefore on
sale, and the patent was properly held
invalid for that reason and because of
public use of the design.
Invention Sold When
Accepted
Since an invention is not on sale
until it has been put in tangible form,
it may be asked at what time an inven-
tion becomes "on sale" when an em-
bodiment of it is made only after receipt
of a purchase order. The question was
answered in several court decisions, one
of which involved the adding cash regis-
ter shown in Fig. 4. This machine con-
tained an interlock or coupler between
the keys to insure that all keys de-
pressed simultaneously would register
even if some were released before com-
pleting their stroke.
In this case the order for the ma-
chine was placed with the manufacturer
before he made the invention in ques-

merely adopted. The girls both have
first names beginning with J. So, in
order to keep family matters at a mini-
mum and be scientific to the maximum,
let us call them Jl and J2.
When Jl took up ornithology, her
life became irregular. And when she
settled upon the study of a mess of
young Barn Owls, irregularity became
the order of the day and also the night.
Jl would come biking home last spring,
at 2 a.m., with tall tales to tell. Then
she prevailed upon me to- do some
photographing. I dug up the old cam-
era equipment, bought some flash
bulbs, hung the junk on the bicycle,
and the three of us sailed forth into the
night. Owls are nocturnal. If you want
to study them, you have to learn to
catch up on sleep.
The tower looks down on the diagonal
walk, from the Engineering Annex.
Owl parties usually start about 10 p.m.
or later. We have the keys. First, we
let ourselves into the building. Then
we climb the creakiest wooden steps in
existence. It is dark, the building is
empty, and the creaking is superb. On
the second floor, we turn on the lights
and use a second key. A few feet be-
yond that door is the door to the tower
stairway, and it calls for a third key.
Up the steps, and there is the pendulum,
going back and forth with great delib-
eration. Up some more steps, lift a big
trapdoor, and there are the ancient
clockworks. No more stairways. A lad-
der comes next, and, of course, another
trapdoor at the top of it. That brings
us among the open brick pillars, where
one may look down on the diagonal and
also hear everything that is said down
there. It is an interesting place. The
drive shafts for the clock go up through
its center, to the tower room above.
Over in the southwest corner is a tall
A. D. Moore
ladder, leading up to the opening in the
floor of the tower room. It is very dark
up there. What if one's head should
go up through that hole, just when a
big Barn Owl decided to come down
and go hunting? That's something to
think about. In fact, one always thinks
about it.
As we climb into that dark room with
a clock face on each side of it, the cold
chills racing down the spinal column are
not to be explained by weather. It is
a hot night. Maybe the chills and
gooseflesh can be tied up with the ter-
rifying hisses that echo about the room.
The further we advance, the louder the
hisses. I stumble to the southeast cor-
ner and plug into a socket. A single
bare bulb lights up, and there, on the
bare floor, are five downy owlets. They
are jammed against each other and the
brick wall. They are a creamy white,
with very dark blue eyes. They are all
stomach and beak, they are uglier than
any bird you ever saw in a nightmare,
and they are hissing endlessly. These
are not short little pinktea hisses. A
bare handful of owlet fills himself up
with air, and then send out a 1-o-o-ng,
snoring hiss of amazing volume.
The parents are out hunting. I set
up the camera, two feet from the family,
and carry the string across the room
to the blind. Jl has built the blind
out of old sheets and stuff, and the
northeast corner. We three enter the
blind and get fixed. Each is peering
through a hole. I enlarge my hole, to
let my hand stick out through it, with
the flash lamp in the hand. We are
still as we hope the mouse is, the mouse
we hope the parent is now bringing.
The bulb was left lighted, and we can
see pretty well.
The air is stuffy in the blind. In fact.
it is very stuffy. There is no ventila-
tion up here, and the day was hot.
There are other reasons for stuffiness,
too. Pellets, for instance. The pellets
are scattered all around the site the
youngsters no doubt think of as home.
What are pellets? Largely, ex-mice.
Mamma brings in a mouse. One of the
brats swallows the mouse. His diges-
tive juices extract the nutriment, leav-
ing bones and fur. The fur is still
around the bones. And then (if you are
a good ornithologist, you won't mind
this—you get used to such matters!)
the owl heaves up the pellet by regurgi-
tation, and care not where he drops it.
Dropping pellets at one's feet and sit-
ting on them makes the floor softer,
and the air stuffier. But owls can breath
anything. The owl probably has almost
no sense of smell. He would be happier
without it.
Midnight is announced from the
carillon tower across the campus, and
still no parent owls. Half an hour more
of tense waiting. There are several
screams outside. The babies come to
attention and start hissing. The parent
is circling the tower. There is a thump!
She (or he) has flown up the hole, and
landed on its edge. Those big claws
really sound wicked, when they hit the
wood: they are very effective, and that
sound reminds one of the fact. Quite
briefly, she surveys the scene. We freeze.
She flies to the "nest," stands by the
brood, and drops the mouse from her
beak. My string opens the shutter.
The little click causes her to look square
at the lens. I turn loose with the flash.
Instantly, Mrs. Owl flies straight for
my opening in the blind. I do my best
to reduce to one microsecond the time
it takes to pull a hand and a flashlamp
16
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Just before striking, the owl shoots up-
wards, crosses the room, and flies down
the hole to the outdoors.
Was all that thrilling? You ought to
experience it. It was worth two hours
of waiting, and then some. Before we
forget it, let's erase a false impression.
"Just before striking. ." implies that
she would have struck if she could. Not
so. There is no record of a Barn Owl
attacking a human being. On the other
hand, the parent owl did carry out a
perfectly typical gesture,—one that the
youngsters used on us time and again
when they could fly.
We scramble out of the blind, all stiff
from holding cramped positions for so
long. "The lame, the halt, and the
blind" is the phrase to use in describ-
ing our gait and the cause of it. We
want a picture of the swallowing act.
I get the camera and flash ready again.
An owlet in the front row discovers a
dead mouse at his feet. He drops his
beak onto the end of the mouse and
starts to swallow. Wrong end. He drops
the mouse, and this time reaches for
the head. The owl is only about twice
as long as the mouse, so it is quite an
undertaking. I snap him when he is
well started. Ignoring the flash, he con-
tinues to make progress. More strug-
gles, more swallows, a final surge, and
he sinks back panting and exhausted.
The meal is down,—all except the mouse
tail dangling from one side of his mouth,
and that's a minor detail to be taken up
when there is more room downstairs.
Barn Owls largely live on small ro-
dents, and they and other owls render
an important service in keeping the
hordes of mice in check. Barn Owls
are not averse to taking a small bird
if it is abroad at night when it
shouldn't be, but the damage on that
score is small. As a part of her study,
Jl collected about a hundred of the
pellets, lugged them home, and dis-
sected them. This is known as "mak-
ing a pellet count." Mice predomi-
nated in the diet .
By the way, if you object to moth
holes in your spare suit, make pellet
counts in a laboratory. You can
go up to the clock tower and see an
interesting life complex on that score.
The owl eats the mouse, rejecting the
bones and fur. Moths like fur. They
have no objections to the origin of the
fur. You'll find moth larva having a
good time in old dried owl pellets.
When the baby owl is a few days
old, he is almost helpless. He sags
down shapelessly, resting his big
stomach on his flattened legs and feet.
His big head is too heavy for the neck
muscles, and he rests his beak on the
floor, or on another owlet, most of the
time. He is too small to swallow a
whole mouse, and at that stage,
Mamma has to make hamburger of
the mouse in order that the babies
may eat.
The owlets grow rapidly, but the
marvelously precise coordination of
the adult is achieved by the young at
a very slow rate. When the youngsters
are about two-thirds grown, they are
still confined to their same old spot in
learned to approach the young gang
without being frightened by hissing,
when suddenly, a very loud snap japs
your eardrums. A young owl has
learned to snap his beak. It is a single
snap, but a mighty good one. Tells you
to look out and behave yourself, don't
get familiar, and so on.
The third trick is the great laugh-
getter, and the one nobody under-
stands. This is the headswinging. As
soon as the babies can hold their heavy
heads off the floor for a little while,
they begin to pass the time by swinging
the head from side to side. They keep
it up, clear into the flying stage. You
may chase a flying youngster around

A youngster submits to being displayed. (Those are pellets on the floor.)
a corner, on the floor; still jammed in
against each other; occasionally
stretching upward, with the help of a
wall or a couple of buddies to lean
against, but mostly slouched down in
a stoop-shouldered hunch. Having
nothing much to do and nowhere to
go, they learn odd little practices. One
of the earliest is a very rapid flutter-
ing of the beak. It had been believed
that this was due to panting when hot,
but I have disproved that idea. It
has no connection with the breathing
rate. It think it is simply a matter
of having certain muscles that will
later be needed for handling the beak,
and of learning a kid trick of using
those muscles rapidly. As they reach
adulthood, this rapid beak movement
is dropped. That is, our numerous
observations were definitely to that
effect. However, the flying adult may
use it to modulate one of the several
kinds of calls of the Barn Owl.
After developing the quivering beak
stunt, the somewhat older adolescent
hands you a surprise. You have
the room time and again, and he is
apparently all hot, excited, and angry.
He lands on a ledge. You approach; he
gives you a couple of hisses; abruptly,
he seems willing to drop the whole ar-
gument. He drops his head (still eye-
ing you) and starts mournfully swinging
his head. Now, due to the feather ar-
rangements around the face, everyone
remarks on this owl's resemblance to a
monkey. In fact, he is called the
Monkey-Faced Owl. No normal person
can watch a monkey-face swinging his
head without bursting into laughter.
The weighing of the very young
babies (Jl had to keep a weight record)
was a simple matter. You just pick a
baby up and put him on the scales.
Later, when he is almost a double hand-
ful of owl, not yet walking and three
weeks from flying, weighing is a tougher
job. Five young fighters at bay in a
corner are not going to let anybody
weigh any owls, if they can help it.

which used to hold flash bulbs, and you

fire resistant hangars
for blimps
One of our Navy's most effective
weapons in combatting the U-Boat
campaign against transatlantic shipping
was the non-rigid dirigible airship, bet-
ter known as the blimp. Ever since a
sufficient number of blimps have been
available for this long range service,
they have made a fine record. In order
to make most efficient use of them, strat-
egically located bases were provided for
them on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific
coasts.

Impregnation retorts.
The construction of these bases con-
stituted quite a problem. Suitable
hangars for these blimps had to be con-
structed as quickly as possible and with-
out any sacrifice in durability. In addi-
tion, the structures had to be fitted to
the climate and other conditions of the
locality, and the construction materials
would have to be such as not to hamper
other defense needs.
During the present war the earlier
blimp hangars were of welded-steel arch
type construction, but at the time that
Germany was intensifying her subma-
rine campaign, it became evident to our
strategists that we would need many
more blimps and a far larger number
of hangars for their accomodation. With
structural steel a critical material be-
cause of our greatly enlarged shipbuild-
ing program and other pressing de-
mands, the Bureau of Yards and Docks
was confronted with the problem of de-
signing hangars that would be accept-
able in every way and not use metal.
The substitution of fire resistant wood
on a maximum scale and the employ-
ment of a minimum quantity of steel
was the solution arrived at after inten-
sive study. The great timber structures
which resulted stand forth as a major
engineering achievement.
The hangars are about 1060 feet long
and 300 feet wide with a clear internal
span of 234, a height of 174 feet, and a
span on the center line of the arches of
258 feet. Since they had to be located
in different parts of the continent, each
had to be built to meet the prevailing
conditions or those likely to arise at its
particular site. Accordingly, the hang-
ars were constructed to withstand stress-
es that might be caused by an earth-
quake, a hurricane, or a heavy snow-
fall. The amount of lumber used for
each varied from 3,100,000 to 3,500,000
board feet, depending upon the design
of the structure.
The substitution of timber for steel,
apart from presenting many structural
difficulties, introduced another problem
—that of providing protection against
fire. This was of utmost importance,
even though our blimps do not in them-
selves constitute a fire risk, because we
are fortumate enough to be able to
supply them with non-combustible heli-
um gas. Even so, the lean-tos along the
base at each side of the hangar at
ground level, which house the operating
offices, workshops, and serve as storage
spaces for equipment and supplies, are
a possible fire hazard. Although ade-
quately safeguarded with a sprinkler
system, these provisions do not suffice
because there always remains the un-
predictable and uncontrollable menace,
—lightning, which is one of the princi-
ple sources of fire losses in the United
States.
Before the experts found a satis-
factory answer to this question, con-
sideration was given to deluge sprink-
lers, hose reels on the roof, and similar
equipment. The difficulties of provid-
ing reliable protection by these measures;
the danger to men atop the arch roof,
nearly 200 feet in the air, fighting flames
underneath them; the problem of sup-
plying sufficient water to combat a ser-
ious fire in a structure of this size; and
the consumption of critical materials for
any adequate system, all dictated a
different approach to the problem of fire
protection.
As far back as 1895, the Navy had
made use of timber that had been given
a fire-retarding treatment. Subsequently,
the Bureau of Yards and Docks found
various applications for such lumber.
Today, timber is also treated with pre-
servatives to make it resistant to decay
and insect attack. The generally ac-
cepted method of impregnation calls for
a pressure treatment, or, what is known
to the trade as the full-cell process. The
work usually calls for different treat-
ments, which may be grouped as fol-
lows; two for fireproofing, one combina-
tion type for fireproofing and wood
preserving, and two for straight wood
preserving. The solutions used are com-
binations of eight chemicals which are
mixed according to the treatment de-
sired. In the case of the hangars, much
of the wood was impregnated with solu-
tions containing fireproofing chemicals
as well as salts to protect it from decay.
The process used in the treatment of
the lumber for the hangars utilizes both
vacuum and air pressure at different
stages to achieve the effects desired.
The lumber to be treated may range
from 1 inch to 12 inches in thickness
and is loaded on trams. As the sticks
are loaded lengthwise, separators are
placed between the layers to keep them
far enough apart for the chemicals to
be able to flow freely to all external sur-
faces of the timber.
Should the wood received at the plant
be newly cut, the material must be
freed of all excess moisture before im-
pregnation can be started. This is done
by subjecting it for from two to eight
hours to low pressure steam at tempera-
tures ranging from 220 to 260° F. It
is then placed under a vacuum to stim-
ulate evaporation.

long and have an internal diameter of
4 feet. The shells are contructed so that
they can withstand the high pressures
necessary to process the heaviest lumber
which is so treated. On the bottom of
each retort is a track for the trams
which carry the lumber. Between these
tracks are coils in which steam is cir-
culated to heat the solution to the tem-
perature required for any given lot of
lumber. Some woods have to be pro-
cessed at lower temperatures than others
in order to avoid distortion.
A loaded tram is shoved into the
retort and heavy doors are sealed
shut. After this is done the vacuum
pump withdraws the free air from with-
in the retort, thereby evacuating the in-
tercellular spaces in the wood. A 22
inch vacuum is held on the retort for a
period of one hour. During that time,
any air in the lumber is removed, thus
aiding the absorption of the impregnat-
ing fluid with which the cylinder is filled
as soon as the vacuum pump is cut off.
When the valve in the solution line is
opened, the atmospheric pressure and
the pressure of the solution forces the
chemicals into the retort from the stor-
age tanks, which are placed at a higher
elevation out in the yard. However, air
pressure can be applied to the storage
tanks to force the solution through more
rapidly when necessary.
Above and parallel with each retort is
a shorter and smaller tank which is
partly filled with the impregnating fluid.
On top of this tank is an air receiver
which is connected with the compressor
plant. Between the working tank and
the retort is a solution line with an in-
terposed valve. When the valve is
opened, air from the receiver flows into
the working tank and exerts pressure
against the free surface of the liquid.
This pressure is transmitted through the
liquid to the solution in the retort, there-
by forcing it into the intercullular spaces
and effecting either partial or complete
penetration as desired. In the case of
the wood fireproofed for the Navy hang-
gars, material up to 2 inches in thick-
ness was given complete penetration,
while the heavier members had a treated
zone of ample depth to insure protec-
tion.
The pressure exerted upon the solu-
tion to force it into the lumber varies
considerably in general practice, being
a function of the species of the wood,
its thickness, and its physical character-
istics. It also differs with the depth of
penetration, which is controlled by both
pressure and length of time it is applied.
The pressure used may vary from at-
mospheric to 215 pounds per square
inch, and may be exerted for a few hours
or for a full 24 hours, while the temp-
erature of the solution may vary from
that of the atmosphere at the time of ap-
plication to 190° F. In other words,
the process is a flexible one, and de-
pends on the material and the require-
ments.
After the lumber has been under
pressure the specified time, the valve
between the retort and the working
tank is closed and the chamber is emp-
tied by applying pressure from the air
receiver to force the solution back
through the feed line to the storage
tank. Then all valves but those leading
to the vacuum pump are closed, and a
vacuum is again drawn on the retort
for a short while to take care of drip
and unabsorbed liquid still clinging to
the surface of the timber. With that
done, the vacuum is released and the
lumber is removed from the retort and
stacked on larger trams, in layers, with
interposed separators, and placed in a
kiln.
The drying kilns have concrete
floors traversed by ducts for drainage,
steam heating coils, as well as steam
sprayers. The heat is distributed in
transverse, circular currents that pass
through and envelop the spaces between
the layers, by reversible power-driven
fans. This makes control of the drying
process rather efficient.

Set-up for making the crib test.
The care with which the solutions
are prepared and the process is applied
is not in itself sufficient. Out of each
lot of 5000 feet of treated timber, a
sample must undergo what is known as
the crib test, as prescribed by the Ameri-
can Society for Testing Materials. The
test set up is diagrammed in an ac-
companying cut. While the wood may
char more or less where exposed to the
hottest part of the flame, and may even
be glowing if not blazing before the
burner is shifted, flaming usually ceases
immediately thereafter, while the resid-
ual glow, in a satisfactory test, dies out
in a few seconds.
The object of the process is not fire-
proofing but to obtain an appreciable
amount of fire retarding. The virtue
of the treatment, then, is to make an
ordinarily highly combustible material
slow to yield to flames and by so doing
hamper the spread of a blaze, and thus
give fire fighting equipment time either
to arrive or to get into action. All lumber
treated by this Protexol process for the
Navy's blimp hangars had to pass the
foregoing test to prove that it could
meet the exacting specifications drawn
up by experts of the Bureau of Yards
and Docks. •
new ice breaker
During war or peace the U. S. Coast
Guard must wage a ceaseless battle
against the ice which hinders the move-
ment of ships on the Great Lakes, in
northern harbors, and in the sea lanes.
Several new ice breakers of the "Wind"
class, more powerful than any ever
before built, are now in service.
The most spectacular feature of these
new ships, which are the results of ex-
tensive research and study of ice break-
ing, is a bow propeller. The bow pro-
peller, supplementing two conventional
stern propellers, can turn in either di-
rection. It will create a bow wave to
help crack ice by being turned in the
reverse direction, and, if turned in a
forward direction, will pull water out
from under the ice, the ice cracking
under its own weight.
Each stern propeller is driven by a
5000 h.p., 900-volt Westinghouse motor,
the total being 1500 h.p. more than on
the highest powered Victory ships. The
bow propeller is driven by a 3,300 h.p.
motor. As shown in the figure, the power
for these motors is furnished by six
generators. Each delivers 1375 kw. at

Jack Verschoor is undoubtedly one
of the most outstanding engineers in

Jack D. Verschoor
Much of Mr. Verschoor's knowledge
has been gained through actual experi-
ence, and this has been of unquestion-
able aid to him in his engineering
courses. He was employed last sum-
mer by the Continental Tool Works
Division of the Excello Corporation as
a tool designer. His work with this or-
ganization was so outstanding that he
was presented the Army-Navy E award
for his achievements. He has also been
a draftsman for the Pennsylvania Rail-
road, as well as a tool designer for the
American Seating Company. At pres-
ent, in addition to his regular studies,
he is working for Professor Porter in
the Department of Engineering Re-
search, where he is doing experimental
testing.
It is Jack's firm belief that the engi-
neering course should be altered to a
two-year cultural course and a three-
year concentration in engineering. Since
he feels that the first two years might
well be spent at junior college, it is not
surprising that he entered the Univer-
sity of Michigan after completing two
years' work at Grand Rapids Junior
College. He feels that the first two
years should be used in the study of
such courses as mathematics, science,
economics, languages, and humanitarian
subjects such as history, sociology, psy-
chology, etc. By following this course
with three years of specialized training
in engineering. Jack believes that a
student would get an education truly
worthy of the name.
What spare time Jack has is devoted
mainly to his favorite hobby, mechanics.
As his father is the owner of a garage,
he has ample opportunity to work di-
rectly with life-size machines. Another
of his favorite hobbies is photography,
and he was the photographer for his
high school annual. It seems that al-
most everything he tries, he can do
well.
aero prof
The most recent addition to the
faculty in the department of aeronauti-
cal engineering is assistant professor
Julius D. Schetzer. Professor Schetzer
graduated from the University of Michi-
gan in 1939 with a B.S. degree in
physics. Although specializing in elec-
tronics and mechanics as an undergrad-
uate, he also mastered the fundamental
principles of aerodynamics.
Thus, with a well balanced knowledge
of engineering, Professor Schetzer was
able to accept a position in the air-
craft industry in 1939 when the need
for aeronautical engineers was greatest.
While at Curtis Wright, in the struc-
tures and vibrations department, Pro-
fessor Schetzer worked on many well
known military aircraft, namely, an
early model of the present P-40, and on
the XSB2CI which was the forerunner
to the navy Hell Diver. At Stinson he
worked on the L-5, commonly called the
"Flying Jeep."

ulius D. Schetzer
Thus after obtaining four years of
practical experience in the aircraft in-
dustry, Professor Schetzer returned to
the university and obtained his M.S.
degree in aeronautics in the spring of
1944. At present his teaching schedule
occupies most of his time but he hopes
to do research work on compressible
fluids in the near future.
As a youth, Professor Schetzer spent
a great deal of his time working on his
favorite hobby—building model radio
sets, a hobby which eventually resulted
in providing the family living room with
a full size cabinet radio.
Skiing and listening to classical music
are Professor Schetzer's favorite forms
of relaxation.
Professor Schetzer's personal taste in
smart looking wearing apparel certainly
makes him a contender for the best
dressed man on the campus, but of
course we could be wrong—his taste
may be somewhat influenced by the
fact that his wife is a young campus co-

At 7:15 Wednesday, January 10, the
Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences,
previously hard hit by Selective Service,
reorganized for an informal meeting in
the Michigan Union. A technical sound
film was presented, illustrating charac-
teristics of the air flow around air foils
and other bodies.

Two weeks later, the 24th, Institute
members, under the direction of Dr.
A. M. Kuethe, of the Aeronautics De-
partment, elected officers Floyd Miller,
Bob Champion, Bill Scudder, and Ken
Morey as Chairman, Vice-Chairman,
Secretary, and Treasurer, respectively.
Speaker Chester Ricker lectured on for-
eign aircraft design and construction
features with a series of pictures on
the Focke-Wolfe 190 and De Havilland
"Mosquito."
At 7:30 Wednesday, February 14,
Prof. Maugh of the Civil Engineering
Department addressed the I. Ae. S. His
subject was "Lighter than Air Ships."
Prof. Maugh discussed the construction
and some of the problems which must
be dealt with in connection with these
aircraft.
All Aeronautical Engineering students
are urged to join the I. Ae. S. and to
attend meetings. The present member-
ship of seventy-one, although below pre-
war levels, foreshadows an active season.
Future plans include trips to aircraft
production centers, films of current in-
terest, and lectures by both industrial
men and members of the University
staff to tempt those planning an engi-
neering career in aviation. Especially
when so much effort is directed toward
new developments is everyone encour-
aged to join our aviation society.

attend.
S. W. E.
The members of the S. W. E. toured
the campus January 31, 1945, and saw
the wind tunnel, cyclotron, and naval
tank. At the wind tunnel, Professor

Schetzer explained the elementary oper-
ation, and gave a demonstration test on
a tail piece. Professor Cork explained
the cyclotron and said that much of the
work on radio-active materials has been
done here at Michigan. He also told
what uses are made of these materials.
The work at the naval tank was ex-
plained by Professor Baier, who gave
the members a ride on the towing car.

The
Best Engineers-
JLimken Tapered Roller Bearings can carry all kinds
of loads — radial, thrust, or both together. The amount of
these loads that the bearings can carry is equally important.
The load carrying capacity of Timken Bearings has been
established on a thoroughly scientific basis. Each bearing's
capacity has been checked and confirmed by extensive
laboratory tests and by the field experience gained from the
500,000,000 Timken Bearings in service.
The machine designer may therefore select with confidence
the proper size and style of Timken Bearing to best keep
wheels, shafts and gears turning smoothly, easily, dependably
— free from the threat of friction, wear and misalignment.
When your college days are over and you begin your career
as a mechanical engineer, you will find the load capacity of
Timken Bearings an asset of tremendous value in design-
ing machines of any type. You will always know a Timken
Bearing by the trade-mark "TIMKEN"
stamped on every bearing. The

Metal Processing agreed to cast the
column sections in their foundry for a
low cost. The foundry would make the
molds, melt the scrap metal in their
cupola furnace, and cast the column
sections if the patterns and scrap metal
required were furnished.
Following this plan, senior students
in "Chemical Engineering Laboratory"
checked the capacity of the evaporator
heat transfer surfaces and, after find-
ing them to be sufficient for the pro-
posed column, dismantled the evapor-
ator. They also made the forms for
the new foundations to be used for the
reboiler and mixed and poured the con-
crete. Students in "Chemical Engineer-
ing Design" designed the cast iron col-
umn sections to be used, prepared a
piping diagram for the installation, de-
signed the supports, and prepared lay-
outs of the assembled installation.
Students in "Foundry" made the molds
and poured the cast iron sections of the
column. The teaching staff acted as
consultants. Some of the work, such
as the patternmaking and machining,
had to be done by skilled workmen. In
all other respects the new laboratory
fractionating column was a student
project.
Since the column is intended pri-
marily for illustrating the principles of
distillation and for research investiga-
tions, numerous features were included
that are not present in commercial col-
umns. Referring to Figure 3. each plate
has two large observation ports so that
the column operation may be easily ob-
served. The patterns were constructed
so that a wide variety of plate designs
are possible. Plates may be cast with
or without vapor risers, and with or
without a baffle for the liquid down-
spout. The plate spacing and weir
height may be varied, and the section
may be cast as a shell alone, without
the plate, to be used for special ex-
perimental columns.
The column was put into operation in
February, 1944. Since then it has been
operated each term by the senior stu-
dents. In this operation mixtures of
ethanol and water were fractionated.
The results obtained indicate- that the
performance of the column compares
favorably with that of commercial in-
stallations. During the summer of 1944.
an investigation was conducted on the
performance of a sheet metal plate con-

Yes, zinc does double duty when applied to metals. It gives
mechanical protection, with a sheath of rust-resistant metal; the
durability depends on the thickness of the zinc. Zinc is also a rust
inhibitor—it literally "stops rust before it starts", through electro-
chemical action. The U. S. Bureau of Standards says Zinc is "by far
the best" protective metallic coating for rust-proofing iron or steel.

struction that was known to be unusu-

the cast iron shell sections were used
to retain the experimental sheet metal

Commercial manufacturers of distilla-
tion equipment have shown considerable
interest in the laboratory column. The
Fluor Corporation Ltd. has sent sam-
ples of its standard rectangular steel
bubblecaps to be used in the column.
The E. B. Badger and Sons Co. also
has sent samples of its standard circular
copper bubble caps. The Koch Engi-
neering Company is at present fabricat-
ing three of its cascade-type plates for
installation in the laboratory column.
The design and construction of the
column has been of value as a student
project. The completed installation
has provided an excellent means of
teaching the principles of operation and
the design of fractionating columns. In
addition, the proposed research investi-
gations are of more than theoretical in-
terest, as evidenced by the response
obtained from the manufacturers of
commercial equipment.

tion, neither the seller nor the buyer
then knowing how the machine was go-
ing to be arranged. It was only in the
course of the manufacture of the ma-
chine and after evolving an unsuccess-
ful design that the manufacturer in-
vented the coupler. The machine con-
taining the coupler was delivered to
the buyer in 1886. It was held in a
suit decided in 1910 that the sale was
completed by the delivery and accept-
ance of the machine, the title to which
only then passed from the seller to the
buyer. Taking place more than two
years before the patent was applied for
in 1890, the completion of the sale ren-
dered the patent void. The court also
found good reason to declare that the
patenting of the machine was just an
afterthought.
The fact that the machine was manu-
factured and delivered upon an ad-
vance order rather than manufactured
before an order was obtained did not
alter the effect of the sale. But, if the
invention had been made by the buyer
instead of by the seller, the sale of the
machine would not have been a sale of
the invention. The buyer would then
have been paying for having his inven-
tion embodied in a machine, but he
would not have paid for his own inven-
tion. A sale of the invention can only
be made to a member of the public: in
other words, to anybody except the in-
ventor himself.
Sale Completed By
Implied Acceptance
A sale of an article embodying an
invention may be completed even if
the acceptance of the article is not ex-
pressed but merely implied. In the case
of the fireplace mantel shown in Fig.
5, one mantel was shipped to a pur-
chaser in 1888 and shortly thereafter
was billed to him. The bill was ren-
dered two years and two days before the
manufacturer applied for a design
patent covering the mantel. There was
no formal acceptance of the mantel,
but the fact that the invoice had not
been protested was apparently sufficient
evidence of the goods being accepted.
The patent was held invalid in 1893 al-
though the mantel was paid for less
than two years before the patent was
applied for.

It's a high speed flier-strander which forms unit cores
for telephone cable.
One-hundred-and-one pairs of paper pulp insulated
copper wire from the supply reels are assembled and
bound with cotton, then are taken into a unique revolv-
ing flier which twists them into a unit cable core—all at
the rate of 600 linear feet per minute, or twice as fast as
machines previously used. Several of these unit cores
are later combined and sheathed in lead to make the
familiar telephone cable.
Each of the 101 supply reels holds up to eight miles
of paired wire and has an individual motor drive with
sensitive control to insure uniform tension on the wire.

Sometimes a sale may even be com-
pleted before actual delivery of the ar-
ticle sold. Such a sale was fatal to the
patent on the coating machine shown
in Fig. 6. The patented structure com-
prises a heated coating roller closely
adjacent to a heated equalizing scraper
and a cooled smoothing roller and is an
improvement over a machine previously
built by the inventor in 1908 on bor-
rowed money. The latter machine was
used by the inventor to make carbon
paper for his financial backer. Instead
of repaying the loan, the inventor gave
his backer a bill of sale of the machine,
and soon thereafter the buyer leased
the machine back to the inventor's wife.
In a suit decided in 1918, the inven-
tor contended that this queer sequence
of transactions did not constitute a sale
and that the machine was simply se-
curity for a mortgage. The court, how-
ever, held the sale completed by the
transmission of the bill of sale, more
than two years before the patent was
applied for in 1911. In fact, the ma-
chine was actually delivered to the
buyer in 1910. Even though the ma-
chine sold was perhaps imperfect and
the structure shown in the patent
greatly improved, the sale invalidated
the patent because the machine sold
was within the scope of the patent
claims.
INVENTIONS "ON SALE"
(Continued from page 28)
Conditional Sales
The completion of a sale by accept-
ance of the article sold is not affected
by any money-back guarantee or other
guarantee of satisfactory operation, as
long as it is not agreed between the
seller and the buyer that the article sold
is purely or at least principally experi-
mental and that the sale is made for
the purpose of testing the invention.
Conditional sales were sufficient to
invalidate the patent on the stove shown
in Fig. 7. The stove consisted of a cast
iron frame supporting a double wall of
soapstone slabs. The drawing looks a
trifle incomplete, but the patent help-
fully states that the stove may be pro-
vided with a door and with a stove pipe.
A few stoves were sold on trial in 1854,
to be returned if they were not satis-
factory. Taking place over two years be-
fore the inventor applied for a patent in
in 1857, they rendered the patent in-
valid. The patentee's contention that
the stoves were experimental was un-
availing in a suit decided in 1880 since
their conditional sale was not a proof
that the inventor had any doubts as to
their operation and intended to use his
customers as guinea pigs. He had all the
facilities needed for testing the stoves
himself and did not need to sell them to
find out their defects.

Sale of Process
Although the word "sale" brings to
mind a transaction involving a tangible
object, the principles governing the ef-
fects of sales of patented inventions
have been extended to processes. The
process of making artificial stone shown
in Fig. 8 was so involved. This figure
shows a mold into which are poured a
series of veins of dense cement, the
veins afterwards to be backed by a layer
of porous cement showing between the
veins to imitate rock comprising alter-
nate dense and porous layers.
This process was used by the inven-
tor in 1910 for making the strikingly
attractive facings of the Pennsylvania
Station in New York. The job was
completed and accepted more than two
years before a patent claiming both the
process and the product was applied
for in 1915. Although the sale of the
stone was subject to replacement of
material showing defects within one
year, it had the same effect as an un-
conditional sale. It was held in 1925
that both the process and the product
of the invention had been placed on sale
for a profit outside of the permissable
period and that the patent therefore
was invalid.

In giant oil refineries like this, high test

produced with the help of Super Re-

And they further assist the war
effort by increasing the production
and efficiency of heat treating furnaces,

of the nature of the invention embodied
in the article he is buying or even that
it contains any invention. The effect
of the sale on a subsequently procured
patent remains, nevertheless, the same
even if the invention has been rendered
ineffective in the article sold. This ac-
tually happened with respect to the
sight feed lubricator for steam engines
shown in Fig. 9. This lubricator com-
prises a pipe for connecting the con-
denser to the boiler and a short inner
pipe for conducting live steam from
the condenser to the oil discharge pipe.
In a suit decided in 1896, the inven-
tor testified that one such lubricator
was tested on a prospective buyer's en-
gine in 1883, but that the inner pipe
was plugged up before the lubricator
was finally sold. This took place more
than two years before he applied for a
patent for the lubricator as originally
made, including the inner pipe. It was
held that the invention had been sold
because it was embodied in the lubrica-
tor, so that the buyer could avail him-
self of it simply by removing the plug.

Sale To Test Market
One of the oldest excuses used to
explain sales of an invention before
patenting is that the sales were made
to test the salability of the invention on
the market. Even if it is true, such
reason does not avoid the effect of a
sale on a patent applied for more than
two years later. In a celebrated deci-
sion, the Supreme Court in 1877 held
invalid the patent on the fruit jar shown
Fig. 11. A. M. Swain's hydraulic turbine, sold without experi-
mentation in 1879, rendering void the patent applied for over
two years later.

acter.
The jar was intended to be an im-
provement of another jar of the same
inventor still popularly known as a
Mason jar. The inventor had a few
samples of the modified jar made in
1859. Some of these were sold at that
time for three or four dollars a dozen
for the purpose of testing their popu-
larity with the public and also make a
little easy money. This was sufficient
to invalidate the patent, which was ap-
plied for only in 1868, when the inven-
tor was stimulated into activity by
seeing jars similar to his being sold on
the market.

These spheres—these little steel balls
that are the hearts of ball bearings-
have as great an influence on our lives
as anything promulgated at interna-
tional conferences.
For as our civilization depends on
Production ... Production (the science
of "keeping 'em rolling") depends on
anti-friction bearings — and "Nothing
Rolls Like a Ball!"
The Ball Bearing carries loads on a
circle of free rolling steel balls, reducing
friction and wear, maintaining precise
location of parts and cutting mainte-
nance—as does no other type bearing.
That's why over 300 million New
Departure Ball Bearings are working
in this war. That's why designers of
new and better machinery are design-
ing more ball bearings into that ma-
chinery than ever before.

slip it down over one scrapper and
scoop him up. You weigh him, box and
all. Then you turn the carton upside
down, and nothing happens. Owls love
nooks and crannies. He pokes his head
and wings and claws into all possible
corners and defies you. It takes quite
a. bit of jouncing to get him out of there
and back to the nest.
All the world loves a good fighter.
Well, the world ought to see the young
owls at this stage: pretty well grown,
crudely feathered, unable to walk.
Reach a hand towards the mob (but
be sure to keep it out of range). Five
owlets are at bay, and that is something
to see—and hear. The hissing is mag-
nificent. Their rage is unbounded.
They swell up, push back to the wall
and against each other, and seem ready
for anything. But what are they going
to do about it. The natural guess is
that a beak will flash out and cut your
finger to the bone. It could do that, too.
But that isn't the defense. Bring your
| hand a little closer. Then get it back in
a hurry,—for a foremost owl has skid-
ded down onto his back, flat to the floor.
His legs reach out to you; come a little
closer, if you dare. He will drive him-
self towards you by using his wing
elbows against the floor, and strike out
with the claws. Offer him a stick or a
sack instead of your hands, and he
strikes and hangs on. You can lift him
off the floor that way.
These young owls are tough. Of the
many instances one could cite to prove
it, I will cite The Case of the Missing
Owlet. One night early last summer,
we went up again. Ouly four owls were
in the nest. We looked everywhere, and
we repeatedly counted the mess of owls.
Four owls. There should be five. Final-
ly, we found him. The other four were
sitting on him. There he was for about
fifteen minutes of a hot night, stretched
prone, with four teammates using him
for a bench. Of course, we thought he
was dead. By various devices, we dug
him somewhat out of there. He turned
out to be the oldest and biggest and
scrappiest young owl of the family. He
scrambled to his feet, ready to fight
the world.

he ducked to one side, and to his great
surprise, took a couple of steps away
from the nest. He started to keel over,
but threw out an ever-ready wing to use
as a third leg. He tried some more of
it, and wound up, unsteadily across the
room. In a few minutes, we had wobbly
young owls all over the floor (and I'm
laughing as I write this,—you would
too, if you had seen it). An uncertain
owl takes a step, loses balance, wheels,
finds himself face to face with his next
of kin, and both promptly flop on their
backs to take the defensive. We shoo
them around to somewhere else, and
things happen all over the place. I
catch one, set him on a big stool; he
spreads his wings, lightly sails to the
floor, and puts on the greatest air of
pride you ever hope to see.
Catching a young owl at this stage
calls for underhanded trickery. I refer
to barehanded catching. I discovered
this routine; approach him and back
him up against a wall. Meanwhile,
slip the right hand from far above,
down the wall, to get the fingers behind
his head. He will not turn and bite.
Patting the back of his head, and slip-
ping on down to toixh his shoulders
and body, brings no reaction whatever.
Why? Here is my explanation, for
whatever it may be worth. He has spent
all of his young life with his back to
the wall, or against his brothers and
sisters. That was security. All attacks
came from the front. Nothing could
attack from the rear. In fact, he actu-
ally seems to be reasured by the touch
from the rear. Continue with the hand
until it is around his wings and body,
and one can pick him up in safety.
Once he is firmly held, he relaxes with-
out fear. (This statement holds for
these youngsters, who must have been
somewhat used to us; I held them thus
many times; a later and wilder crew,
unused to humans, could be caught,
but were not so content to be held).
The big night was the Night of the
Flying Circus. The night before that,
low flights of a few feet were made, but
nobody really got up and went places.
The next night was as different as could
be. First, our entry: there was never
a hiss. Always before that, they had
tried to hiss us back down the ladder.
Tonight, it was so silent that we were
sure the birds had flown. I poked my
head up into the tower room. Thump.
Thump. Thump-thump. Owls all over

the place, in the dim moonlight. Tak-
ing off from any where, flying silently,
landing anywhere, with a Thump. Back
and forth. Five sturdy young owls,
showing what they could do. It was
better than any circus I ever saw. From
the room's center, a shaft goes out to
each of the four clock faces. One owl
was on a shaft. I took a stick and urged
him off it. He flew to the next shaft. I
urged him off that, and he went to the
next, and so on. Went around the room
that way.
After turning on the light, we kept
the beasties flying around until they
were a little tired. They settled down
on top of the blind. If I took a stick to
argue with one, he usually would shrink
back into a corner. But if he decided to
fly for it, he would do what Mamma
had done that other night; he would
take off straight for my head. Yes, I
always ducked. Science would like to

know if the owl would veer upward to
miss me, at the last split second, if
I did not duck. Science remains unin-
formed. I always ducked, and the
young tough would fly just overhead.
He would do it that way, rather than
fly to either side, where there would
be plenty of room.
These are owls of distinction, being
record holders. In 1942, a pair of Barn
Owls (this same pair, perhaps?) laid
their eggs in this tower in February,
and hatched them. Did you know that
this is the earliest Barn Owl record in
Michigan? That information comes
from Dr. Van Tyne, Curator of Birds
in the Museum.
And that's the story—or a small part
of it—of a family of owls in the tower
you have all looked at so often. We
saw one of the youngsters fly out, for
the first time, early in July. All the
others left on July 8. The breeding
season was ended, and that's where this
story should end. But it has a queer
sequel.
One day later in the summer, Dr.
Van Tyne got word to me that he had
a young Barn Owl I had better see.
This almost seemed like too much of
something; you close the books for the
year, and then have to open them again.
I went to the Museum. Yes, there was
a youngster in a box, a week or two
from full flying stage, and very thin
indeed. He had, if you please, been
holding a reception on the diagonal
walk, in the daytime. Some admirer
had warned Dr. Van Tyne, and he had
captured the specimen. He and I
walked from the Museum to the tower,
carrying the young devil. We climbed
all those ladders and steps, mounted
to the tower room, and found three
more youngsters. We banded them all.
in another week, all four were in fine
fettel. The pioneer who had gone out
too soon had gobbled enough mice to
get his weight back. And there, if you
please, is another record for the tower:
this is the latest Barn Owl breeding
record in Michigan.
Did you hear any unearthly screech-
ing this fall and early winter? You
should have. Sitting in my office at
nights, I would hear this late brood
screeching around the tower. One night.
I went up there and stood, looking out
through the pillars. Soon, three or four
owls were in sight at one time, flying
around the tower on a level with me, or
resting on the peak of a nearby roof.
Later, down at the ground, one could
see these fine young birds playing
around up there. They were a beau-
tiful sight. They stayed until just about
the time of the first good December
snow. Come spring, and the time to
enjoy walking the diagonal again, stop
and look up at the tower. You might
get to see a Barn Owl, with his yard
of wing spread. He's worth looking at.
If you make any comments, talk about
owls rather than faculty members.
Your voices carry upwards very well.
Some Professor might be up there owl-
ing around, and hearing every word you
say.

Stove and Heater Plant Converted to Efficient
Manufacturing of Practice Bombs by
LAMSON CONVEYORS
When one of the great West Coast makers of stoves
and heaters was awarded a contract for the produc-
tion of 100 lb. practice bombs, it faced many problems.
Materials handling was one of the most difficult.
Moving raw materials to initial processes and semi-
processed materials through operations was especially
challenging, due to the irregular shapes of the compo-
nent parts—and of the bomb itself. Second—no single
building large enough for the complete job was avail-
able. Lamson engineers, employing a series of overhead
and belt conveyors, linked two buildings into one
smoothly operating unit, moving hard-to-handle ma-
terials to the job in either building.
Our engineers have selected 17 actual cases pre-
senting difficult problems of conversion, analyzed
them for you and presented solutions and results in

hands after a futile attempt to get
information for this article. Then sud-
denly, and without warning; this Aero
Engineer reversed his tactics and pro-
ceeded to tell such fantastic stories that
the Technics ace female reporter gave
up in utter despair. But, like the
Mounties, we always get our man, and
so after beating Ralph over the head
for a few hours under the blazing lights
of the Aero design room the following
confession was obtained. Because of
the unusual conditions under which this
information was procured, the Technic
claims this article to be neither fact nor
fiction but rather a combination of both,
and hereby refuses to be responsible for
the material therein.
Nevada and California each claim
the other to be the birthplace of Ralph
Strem. Ralph maintains that he was
born on a train which was in Nevada,
but as the nearest town was in Cali-
fornia his birth certificate was made out
in that state. (That's his story and
we're stuck with it!)
During his high school days at Grosse
Pointe he took a decided liking to base-

ball and in 1941 was voted the most
valuable player in the City League.
Here at Michigan he has not limited
himself to baseball but has tried out
for the baseball and track teams as well.
In his spare time he takes a crack at
tennis, hockey, and skiing. Believing

Ralph E. Strem
that running is the best possible exer-
cise, Ralph daily goes down to the Field
House and knocks off at least a half a
mile. Mental relaxation is taken over
the checker or chess board, preferably
the former.
Strem's greatest desire after leaving
the University is to travel. So that he
might do this he is seriously consider-
ing entering the Merchant Marine after
which he would like to work in either
South America or Scandinavia.
When questioned on the relations be-
tween faculty and students Ralph was
of the opinion that there should be
more activities on campus whereby the
students could get to know the faculty
better. He also believes that the Engi-
neering school should limit itself to the
teaching of Engineering courses, and
that subjects such as History and Eng-
lish should be covered adequately in
High School.
Besides his sport activities on cam-
pus, Ralph is a member of the Institute
of Aeronautical sciences and Tau Beta
Pi. He has done some private flying
and plans to continue with this after
the war.
ness early in 1880. Naturally, at first
the putting of the spring on sale was
something of a gamble, but the same
can be said of almost any article of
commerce. The spring, however, sold
well; and, evidently as an afterthought,
the inventor made his patent applica-
tion late in 1882. This was too late,
even though the patentee obtained his
patent in less than ten weeks, a feat
seldom equaled today. In a suit the
inventor tried to save his patent by
passing off the early sales of springs as
an experiment. It was evident, how-
ever, that those sales were not made
primarily for the purpose of discovering
the defects of the invention, and for
enabling the inventor to remedy them.
The decision of the court, handed down
in 1893, therefore held the patent in-
valid.
Experimental Sale Must Be
Coupled With Tests
Experiment was also the excuse for
the untimely sale of the hydraulic tur-
bine shown in Fig. 11. This turbine is
of the double runner type discharging

(Continued from page 32)
into a single draft tube. The inventor
placed a partition in the draft tube for
minimizing eddies resulting from the
meeting of the two water streams. One
turbine, sold and installed in 1879, was
complete and fully developed; but it
could not operate at its full efficiency
because it has been connected to exist-
ing undersize water pipes.
Although the turbine had been un-
tried before that time, this first sale
was not experimental because it was
not conducted as an experiment. The
sale of the machine was the inventor's
first opportunity to test it, but he did
nothing to determine the efficiency and
to find out what improvements might
be necessary. In fact, the mahcine was
so installed that tests made on it would
have been meaningless. For this reason,
the claims of the patent applied for
more than two years later in 1881, di-
rected to the partition within the draft
tube, were held invalid in 1901.
In several of the instances above
considered, as well as in other litiga-
tions, the improvident patentee had no
other recourse than to try and present
a premature sale of his invention as
having been for experimental purposes
in order to save his patent. Occcasion-
ally this argument has been successful,
and a single sale of an invention by the
inventor has been held permissible where
the inventor was unable otherwise to
test his invention properly. For exam-
ple, the inventor may be impecunious
and unable to secure the capital re-
quired for building his device otherwise
than by sale, and he may not have the
facilities for testing his invention under
the conditions of its intended operation.
The proof of the inventor's intention
of using the device sold for his experi-
ments should be clear. He should re-
tain control over his invention with the
right to alter it as he sees fit to over-
come the defects. Even so, the inventor
runs the chance that some un-thought-
of circumstance will tend to disprove
that the sale was for experimental pur-
poses. It is certainly safer to consider any
sale of a new invention to be a regular
sale and to follow it with the filing of a
patent application within the one year
period now set by the statute.

900 volts and 810 rpm. and is driven by
a Fairbanks, Morse and Company Diesel
Engine. Each stern motor can be pow-
ered by one, two, or three of the gener-
ators on its circuit. The bow motor
may be powered by either one or both
of the two forward generators.
With the diesel engines operating at
minimum speed and the fields of the
stern motors excited at a minimum, the
speed of the motors is increased by
gradually raising the generator excita-
tion to 75% maximum. The speed is
increased further by simultaneously in-
creasing the engine speed and the gen-
erator excitation. During this process
the motor fields are automatically con-
trolled to cause the motors to absorb
approximately the maximum available
engine output.
Another interesting feature is the
torque limiting action of the engine
governor. If the ship is running freely
with only one or two generators operat-
ing each motor, the available power will
be reduced. If, now, the ship begins
ice breaking and meets heavy resistance,
its engines will become overloaded.
The governor will then function and re-
duce the engine speed, which in turn
will reduce the generator voltage and
the motor speed.
The six engines are connected direct-
ly to the generators and are located by
pairs in three engine rooms separated
by watertight bulkheads. The genera-
tors are ventilated by the ships ventilat-
ing ducts. The two stern motors are
mounted in separate rooms. Water-
tight bulkheads separate the motor
rooms from each other and from the
engine rooms. The bow motor is simi-
larly protected.
A novel method is used for ventilating
the motors. Each motor room is divided
in two by a bulkhead which is attached
to the after (in the case of the stern
motors) end of the motor. A fan is
mounted in this bulkhead and blows
air from the forward compartment into
the after compartment. The air then
passes through the motor windings, is
water cooled, and returns to the forward
compartment.
Motor generator sets in each motor
room supply field current for the motors
and generators. Ship's service power is
supplied by four 220 kw., 450-volt,
900 rpm., three-phase 60-cycle gener-
ators, driven by a 4.2 kw., 120 volt,
shunt wound exciter. Two of these sets
are located in the forward engine room
and two in the after engine room.
The vessel itself is of unique con-
struction. All-welded construction is
employed on its double hulls so that the
ship may stand the heavy strains en-
countered in ice breaking. Its appear-
ance is something like that of a small
battleship, being unusually wide with
respect to its length, and having a
rounded bottom. It also carries anti-
aircraft and anti-submariine armament.
While its bow is shaped along the lines
of conventional ice breakers, its stern
is notched out in a shallow "V". Should
the power of more than one vessel be
desired during heavy ice breaking, an-
other ship may insert its bow in this
notch. The ship also has its own plane
which it stows on its after deck. The
photograph of the ice breaker was made
from the ship's plane.
It is believed that the successful ap-
plication of a number of large direct-
current propulsion generators, connected
in parallel, supplying power to a sin-
gle motor, will result in a definite trend
toward this type of installation, especi-
ally on vessels requiring considerable
power where full horsepower is neces-
sary over a wide range of propeller
speeds, in preference to the series con-
nection of low voltage, high current
generators which has been used in the
past.

gyro is deadly war device
A child's toy. the spinning top, or
gyroscope, is a deadly war instrument
that is used in underwater warfare, on
shipboard, and in aircraft. Under water,
the gyro is the means which directs the
torpedo on its path to the battleship,
destroyer, or transport. On board a
ship it performs the vital job of indicat-
ing the vertical, in spite of the pitch or
roll of the ship. Such stabilization
makes the firing of guns possible at
any position in the roll of the ship,
and greatly increases fire power as well
as accuracy of fire. Gyro compasses
when equipped with automatic steering
devices, become the means by which
the fighting vessels of the world navies
today are navigated in fair or foul
weather. AH but the smallest aircraft
are equipped today with directional
gyros, which are used by the pilots to
maintain their determined courses. New
uses for the gyro have been found, not
only for war, but for the more desir-
able peacetime uses.
centrifuge tests
pilots' resistance
What is believed to be the world's
fastest merry-go-round, one that swings
a human being around like a pail
of water at the end of a rope, is now
helping the Air Force pilots combat
superhuman forces of gravity at high
speeds. This ingenious machine, called
a centrifuge, enables studies of how
much strain above or below the normal
forces of gravity a pilot can take with-
out losing consciousness. While whirl-
ing the subject at 40 miles an hour,
the machine tilts him in such a posi-
tion he is affected as if he were pulling
out of a steep dive at a speed in excess
of 500 miles an hour. At the same
time instruments are attached to his
body to record his blood pressure, pulse,
and respiration. A movie camera shows
that at high speed blood drains from
the subject's face, his cheeks are sunk-
en, and he looks twenty years older.

• How does an engineering student eventually
become vice president or head of a company?
What—over and above his technical education
—must he know to qualify as a top executive?
The answer is: a basic understanding ojprac-
tical business principles and methods.
It is this PLUS knowledge that enables him to
see beyond the specialized activities of one de-
partment—to grasp the importance of Market-
ing, Finance and Accounting as well as Pro-
duction.
Fundamentals Needed
The Alexander Hamilton Institute's Modern
Business Course and Service provides a thor-
ough groundwork in the fundamentals under-
lying all business and industry. With the help
of this intensive training, an alert man can
accomplish more in months than he could,
ordinarily, in years!
Many Technical Subscribers
There is a scientific quality about the Institute's
Course and Service that appeals to technically-
trained men. That is why there are so many
prominent members of the engineering pro-
fession among the more than 400,000 sub-
scribers. They include: J. W. Assel, Chief En-
gineer, Timken Steel &amp; Tube Co.; Lewis Bates,
Plant Mgr., E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.;
Lewis P. Kalb, Vice President, Chg. Eng. &amp;
Mfg., Continental Motors Corporation; H. W.

Institute training fills the gap in ordinary
technical education, and provides access to the
thinking and experience of many famed indus-
trialists. It is basic, broad in scope and fits into
a busy schedule.
Prominent Contributors
Among the prominent men who have contrib-
uted to the Course and Service are: Thomas

1,200 chemicals are required in the
building of a warship. About 600 chem-
icals enter into the production of a
plane. A bomber requires about 2.5
tons of alkali in its fabrication, and one
type of bomber takes over a ton of
neoprene.
automatic pilot outflies
human pilot
Superiority of a robot pilot over a
human in holding a plane on its course
and in correcting for deviations from
straight and level flight have been dem-
onstrated by aviation engineers. The
demonstration showed that an auto-
matic pilot will start correcting ac-
tion as soon as the plane begins
to move off its course. Reactions of
a human pilot are much slower be-
cause at least one tenth of a second is
required for the message that he is off-
course to reach his brain. Then, he
must have time to adjust his controls
by hand. The secret of the speedy,
accurate performance of the robot pilot
is an electrical gyroscope, which acts
as the 'brains' of the system. Any de-
viation produces an electrical signal in
the gyroscope. This, in turn, is am-
plified and converted into mechanical
power which moves elevators, ailerons,
and rudder to bring the airplane back
to its correct course. The automatic
pilot is being used widely on Navy tor-
pedo bombers. It provides relief for
the human pilot by taking over and
maintaining any course that he may set.
In doing so it relieves him of the phy-
sical duty of controlling the flight and
will hold the airplane on a steadier
course than he can hold by hand.

A BATTLE WAGON WEARS 4,000 SAPPHIRES
THE DELICATE PRECISION instruments so essential to the
navigation of ships of the sea—and ships of the air—are
dependent for accuracy on jewel bearings. There are
4,000 of them in a battleship.
Before the war, synthetic sapphire for these bearings
came from abroad. Today, because of concentrated ef-
forts over the past 36 months by THE LINDE AIR PROD-
UCTS COMPANY, a Unit of UCC, America need never
again depend upon an outside source for this hard,
smooth, wear-resistant material.
This unusual UCC research project led to the quan-
tity production of Linde sapphire and Linde ruby.
These are produced in the form of a single crystal
shaped like a cylinder—known as a boule (pronounced
"bool") —and also in the form of rods of varying sizes,
for more efficient and economical fabrication.
In addition to its indispensability in bearings for mil-
itary instruments, Linde sapphire already is being used
by industry to combat wear in precision gauges, cutting
tools, thread guides for textile mills, barometers, com-
passes, and watches. Phonograph needles that last in-
definitely are another interesting use.
American synthetic sapphire production indeed is a
tribute to American ingenuity, and promises much for
the Nation's postwar progress.

These objects are Linde sapphire
and Linde ruby in boule and rod

tance in military and industrial
use. Because they are single crys-
tals that are second only to the
diamond in hardness — and can
be given a surface that is per-
fectly smooth—they are invalu-
able in bearings and in countless
other parts where there is wear.

More than two million feet of lamin-
ated wood is now in use in military
vessels. This included keels for 11,000
landing craft, keels and stems for 100
PT boats, and one piece stem, keel,
and stern posts units for other ships.
More than 150,000 laminated paddles
have been supplied to the armed ser-
vices, not as substitutes, but as better
and stronger paddles than have been
obtainable before. Thousands of spare
parts in the form of laminated heavy-
white oak timbers have been shipped
to advance repair bases in the Euro-
pean and Southwest Pacific theatres. The
lamination program has been enlarged to
produce structural parts for military
truck bodies, mine guides, railroad tres-
tles and highway bridges. The tech-
niques learned in the necessities of war
may be expected to carry over into
peacetime markets.

Pocket size clouds and snowstorms
that would fit into your hat can now
be 'manufactured.' Confined in a glass
flask not much bigger than a milk
bottle, the clouds and the snowflakes
that flutter down from them are used
to test the effectiveness of electrical in-
sulation at altitudes up to 12 miles. A
thick cloud can be created in a few sec-
onds by pouring liquid air into warm
water and snow can be made to fall by
cooling the flask to below the freezing
point. This innovation helps to speed
development of more powerful electrical
systems for American warplanes.
transforming water
Ordinary water can now be trans-
formed into the chemical equivalent of
distilled water by a simple filtration
process. The principle involved is one
of filtration by skillful utilization of re-
sins. In water passed through beds of
these "ion exchange" resins the dis-
solved salts are changed to the corre-
sponding acids which are then absorbed.
The process may be visualized by pic-
turing water as containing flowing met-
als which are attracted by a magnet,
except that the magnet in this case is
a chemical. Demineralized water with
an average salt content as low as two
parts per million of calcium carbonate
is obtained. So effectively has water
been stripped of its minerals that its
specific resistance has been increased
to as much as 6,000,000 ohms.

Industry's "special j account" with Dow
It is characteristic of large scale
chemical operations, such as
Dow's, that one thing leads to
another. Sometimes materials
emerge from development work
not specifically sought for in the
original task. Yet they are the
logical result of established
chemical reactions. Their prop-
erties, of course, are known, but
their ultimate usefulness to in-
dustry has not been completely
charted.
There are probably as many as
7,000 of these chemicals and
chemical compounds that have
emerged from Dow laboratory
developments. They are neither
accidents nor by-products, but
co-products. They align them-
selves readily into scientific
groups—for example, phenolic
derivatives. From time to time
these are referred to technicians
in various manufacturing fields
who may find among them just
the needed chemical ingredient
to put the finishing touch to
their own work in progress.
To borrow a banking analogy,
these chemicals are industry's
"special account'' with Dow on
which it can draw so that con-
structive developments may
proceed to their successful con-
clusion. And thus America at
large has a genuine stake in this
accumulation of potential assets.

GEORGE B. BRIGHAM
Associate Professor of Architecture
Over a period of years I have been re-
peatedly impressed with the complica-
tion and inefficiency of conventional
construction for small buildings. Each
time my designs have been built I have
felt that the cost and time elements
were excessive. This has been increas-
ingly obvious as new methods and ma-
terials were attempted.
As a result of these experiences I
have experimented from time to time in
better methods of construction and pre-
tabrication for small buildings. On the
basis of these studies the Office of Pro-
duction Research and Development of
the War Production Board requested a
study of prefabrication utilizing com-
plete factory-built units one-story high,
as wide as highway regulations would
permit (8 ft.) and as long as practic-
able. The contract for this research
stated that these units were to be capa-
ble of assembly side by side, end to end,
or end to side, and further, that all ex-
terior and interior walls were to be re-
movable laterally, and all panels inter-
changeable with each other and with
door and window panels without dis-
turbing the floor or roof. Only the cor-
ner posts of each unit would remain sta-
tionary. In these respects the units were
to differ from truckable units developed
by the Tennessee Valley Authority and
others.
Because of acute steel sortages, it
was specified that the units must be

built entirely of wood, and although this
restriction was subsequently relaxed
somewhat, the final result was affected
by it.
This study was, if possible, to make
use of thin wall panels combining struc-
ture, insulation, and finished facings,
and joined in some simple, economical,
and demountable manner.
Preliminary studies were made to test
the degree of flexibility in planning pos-
sible with such large factory-built units,
to investigate the problems involved in
demountable wall, window, and door
panels, and to find a satisfactory floor,
corner post, and room construction.
The next step was the construction of

one full-size unit. As a result of our pre-
liminary studies we had established the
size at 8 ft. by 16 ft. by 8 ft. clear
height from floor to ceiling.
In order not to delay the study of
this problem as a whole, we chose a
fairly standard type of wall panel com-
posed of a rigid insulation core faced on
both sides with ^-in. exterior grade fir
plywood and with a solid wood frame
set in between the plywood facings on
all four edges. The total thickness was
2-% in. The core was built with two
thickness of 25/32-in. vapor-seal Celo-
tex cemented to each other and to the
plywood with an asphaltic binder.
Joints between plywood and frame were
made up with Plaskon Weldwood glue.
Before adopting this panel construction
it was tested for thermal conductivity
in our Mechanical Engineering Depart-
ment. Conductivity proved to be .20
B.T.U. per hour per degree difference in
temperature per square foot. More in-
sulation was desirable, but further study
to achieve it was not advisable at the
time.
Condensation within the core of the
panel was tested at our Wood Utilization
laboratory. After exposure to 90 to 100
per cent relative humidity for six days,
a section was sawed from the panel and
tests revealed no apparent increase in
moisture content above atmospheric
conditions in the shop where the panel
was built. Structural tests were made
when the panels were incorporated in a
full-size wall section.
A simple and effective joint was de-
vised to unite wall panels and roof pan-
els, and to attach wall panels to the
ceiling. The connection was accom-
plished by means of rolled metal chan-
nels driven into grooves in the edges of
panels and floor and ceiling plates.
These channels transferred stresses uni-
formly throughout the structure and
were held in place by tension. This ten-
sion also provided for the natural ex-
pansion and contraction of the plywood.
Tests applied to this method of joining
revealed great strength, the result of
the continuous bearing of metal chan-
nels on the wood panels.

COALSEGREGATION
IN BOILERPLANTS
by
ARTHUR). STOCK, '22E
Editor's Note—Mr. Stock is a graduate of the University of Michigan's College
TECHNIC in 1921. Mr. Stock is president of the Stock Engineering Company.
Engineering in August, 1944.
Coal segregation in boiler plants is a
cause of fuel waste and increased main-
tenance, and it limits maximum steam
output. Therefore, it is a subject which
should be given careful consideration in
order that boiler plants may produce
maximum results. Whenever coal is
moved there is a tendency to separate
the coarse from the fines or to mix the
coarse with the fines. What actually
takes place depends upon the condi-
tions surrounding the movement of the
coal.
This paper will try to explain coal se-
gregation, its problems, and their solu-
tions. It will therefore give to boiler-
plant operators the basis for study of
their own plants with the end in view of
making improvements therein. It is
felt also that an understanding of the
problem of coal segregation will benefit
consulting engineers, in their design of
future plants.
This discussion is limited to coal seg-
regation as it is experienced in steam-
boiler plants; however, the principles
are fundamental and they may be ap-
plied to any place where coal is han-
dled. Segregation exists in many other
places, and although this paper is not
intended to cover any other material
than coal, it still may prove of value as
a starting point for the solution of
problems involving other materials. For
such problems, engineers should bear in
mind that coal particles are fairly alike
in shape and density whereas other ma-
terials may have more widely varying
properties. This is particularly true
where mixtures of materials are em-
ployed.
what is segregation?
According to Webster, to segregate
means, "to separate from a general mass
and collect together or become concen-
trated at a particular place or in a cer-
tain region." As applied to coal in boiler
plants, segregation means to separate
the larger particles of coal away from
the finer particles. If this segregation
continues into the furnace, combustion
will be found to be irregular because of
the different sizes of coal. Irregularity
of combustion results in lower efficiency,
higher maintenance, and lower maxi-
mum capacity.
Nonsegregating, which of course is
the opposite of segregating, means to
keep in a mixed condition. Inasmuch as
coal is always segregating or mixing as
it is handled, transported, and used, it is

of Engineering, and was Editor of the
This article appeared in Mechanical
extremely difficult to have coal com-
pletely mixed at all times. Therefore,
some definition of non-segregating equip-
ment as applied to boilerhouse equip-
ment is needed.
In our work we have defined nonseg-
regating equipment, as applied to coal-
handling equipment in boiler plants, to
mean that type and arrangement of
equipment which puts the coal into the
stoker hopper of a stoker or into a
feeder of a pulverizer in a thoroughly
mixed condition or in such a condition
that the firing results are uniform. The
fact that a piece of equipment operates
well in one case is not proof that it is
nonsegregating, because the degree of
segregation and the effect of that segre-
gation of the fire varies considerably
with the characteristics of the fuel and
stoker. The equipment, if properly in-
stalled, must produce satisfactory results
with any coal to be nonsegregating.
effect on stoker operation
Coal segregation adversely affects
stoker operation, because the ignition of
coarse coal proceeds at a different rate
from that of fine coal; then too, the re-
sistance of the fuel bed to the flow of
air varies according to coal size. Those
parts of an underfed or chain-grate
stoker covered with coarse coal burn
faster than those parts of the stoker
covered with fine coal. As a result, the
fire burns shorter where the coarse coal
exists, and hence a portion of the stoker
air passes without having an opportun-
ity to combine with the fuel. This air
picks up heat from the furnace which
it carries to the stack. This is a loss of
heat. Also this exposed portion of the
stoker becomes overheated and burning
of the stoker iron follows.
In those parts of the underfed or
chain-grate stoker where the fine coal
exists, combustion proceeds at a slower
rate, which means that it is incomplete
when the stoker dumps the ash. The
unburned portion of the fuel bed is
therefore dumped into the ash pit. This

content in the ash. In some cases coal
segregation may also cause clinker for-
mation due to the fact that some sec-
tions of the fire burn at higher tempera-
tures than others. This is particularly
true where low-fusion-ash coal is burned.
Uniform size distribution of fuel is
also important on a spreader stoker.
If, for some reason, the distribution is
not uniform, a clinkering tendency will
be noted wherever there is piling. Ad-
justment in the speed of the flipper is
provided for changes in size of fuel.
When the fuel tends to run large, it
must be slowed down, and when it tends
to run fine, it must be speeded up.
Where more than one feeder is required
for a boiler, it is customary to run all
feeders from a single line shaft, which
means that no individual unit can be
varied in speed from the others. They
all go up and down together. Therefore,
uniformity of fuel to the various hop-
pers is important, otherwise one might
be throwing too far and the other not
far enough. Segregated coal feed on
spreader stokers would thus result in
loss of combustion efficiency and clink-
ering.
Coal segregation causes higher main-
tenance of furnaces, because the ir-
regular firing conditions allow certain
parts of the furnaces to be at higher
temperatures than others. Gas velocities
also vary across the furnace. Damage
due to these variable conditions is se-
vere in the case of refractory arches over
chain grates.
In the case of pulverized coal, chute
segregation is of no importance, but seg-
regation caused in a bunker, which
changes the size of the coal from minute
to minute, does change the grinding ca-
pacity of the mill. This is particularly
true when there is considerable surface
moisture, inasmuch as the moisture af-
fects the mill-grinding capacity of fine
coal more than that of large coal.
Moisture combined with the fines causes
a sticky condition which affects the rate
of feed of the feeder, or which may
cause coal stoppage.
Because it is very difficult to make
clear the exact costs of coal segregation
and the dollar savings that will result
because of its elimination, many plants
tolerate bad conditions. The benefit to
be derived from the elimination of segre-
gation depends upon how bad the con-
ditions are in the plant before improve-
ments are made. It is for this reason
that the author feels reluctant to quote
the improvement in results that has
been obtained in some plants. Suffice
it to say, however, that improvement in
conditions has in most cases proved to
be very much worth while from the eco-
nomic point of view.
cause of segregation
Just why does coal segregate? The
forces which act on pieces of coal as
they move from one point to another
vary according to their size, and there-
fore the direction of motion is different
for each size. Illustrations of coal segre-
gation are presented herewith, not with
the idea of condemning one type of
equipment and recommending another,
but rather to point out how segregation
occurs in each case, how to recognize
the effects of such segregation, and what
to do about it. When coal segregation
in a boiler plant is considered, every step
from the car to the inside of the furnace
must be studied. Segregation caused
early in this process often cannot be
subsequently corrected. Most of the
causes of coal segregation in boiler plants
are due to the equipment installed in
the plant, or the arrangement of that
equipment. Operation is seldom the
cause of coal segregation.
In order to get an understanding of
coal segregation, let us analyze the case
of the typical flat chute such as has
often been used to feed stoker hoppers.
If a flat plate were inclined to the hori-
zontal as shown in Fig. 1, and a piece of
coal were placed at its upper edge and
then released, it would follow the steep-
est slope down the surface of the plate
as indicated.
A number of such pieces of coal re-
leased successively from the same start-
ing point would form a pile at the bot-
tom, as shown in Fig. 2. The course
coal would roll over this pile, away from
the center of the plate, while the fine
would sift through the coarse coal and
remain at the center.
Two side guides could be added with-
out changing the tendency for the coarse
coal to roll and fine to sift. The addi-
tion of a second plate placed parallel to
the first, as shown in Fig. 3, would form
the usual straight fan-shaped chute. If
two such flat chutes were to be installed
on a stoker hopper, there would be
coarse coal down each side and down

ROBERT BALD, *45E
Men with engineering education have
continually demonstrated their ability
to adapt themselves to positions in fields
other than engineering. Since the begin-
ning of the century a new field, that of
municipal management, has developed
in which engineers are distinguishing
themselves. This article is concerned
chiefly with the profession that has re-
sulted from the ever increasing empha-
sis on municipal management; that of
city manager. Before dealing with the
subject directly, however, a brief dis-
cussion of the evolution of city govern-
ment is in order.
From colonial days up until 1900,
various forms of mayor-council govern-
ment were the only plan of city govern-
ment in the United States with the ex-
ception of the New England town-meet-
ings. The relative power of the mayor
and of the council changed considerably
during that period. Originally the mayor
was the ceremonial head of the govern-
ment with little or no power, while the
council was almighty in power over lo-
cal affairs. In the early part of the nine-
teenth century the mayor became an
elective officer. Following this came the
wave of Jacksonian democracy which re-
sulted in limited terms of office and in
the theory that a "public office is a prize
and not a trust." It was on this basis
that the spoils system developed.
The governmental affairs of most
cities became so foul that the better
class of people was finally aroused
enough to seek a remedy for the situa-
tion. Along with cliques of defeated
city politicians they sought special leg-
islation by the state legislature regulat-
ing municipal affairs. The legislatures,
only too happy to accommodate, went
to work and very neatly tied the city
government in knots of special legisla-
tion which we are still trying to untan-
gle. Under the pressure of public senti-
ment, however, many legislatures have
returned the control of municipal gov-
ernment to the residents of the cities
under various home rule acts and con-
stitutional amendments. More will be
said about these later as they constitute
the vehicle for the city manager form of
government.
Even with the removal of state inter-
ference, authority was so decentralized
among the numerous elective and ap-
pointive officials that fixing of responsi-
bility for corrupt and inefficient prac-
tices was impossible. In an effort to
eliminate the lack of responsible admin-
istrative charge, some cities gave the
mayor power to appoint and remove
department heads at pleasure, while
others gave him this power subject to
councilmanic approval. It was during
this period, 1895 to be specific, that the
National Municipal League came out
with its strong mayor form of city gov-
ernment. This plan made the mayor
undisputed administrative head of the
government by granting almost unre-
stricted powers of appointment and re-
moval and a strong veto power. Such
concentration of administrative power
was superior to any other plan available
at that time. Its chief weakness, how-
ever, resulted from the placing of the
selection of this chief administrator in
the hands of the voters. Most men with
ability to handle properly a job of such
magnitude refused to subject themselves
to the trials of a political campaign and
consequently politicians, rather than
administrators, still ran the government.
This danger is theoretically, if not prac-
tically, eliminated by the council-man-
ager plan.
In the early 1900's, another move-
ment began which was diametrically op-
posed to the strong mayor-council plan
since it advocated separation of the ad-
ministrative power into the hands of
three to seven elected commissioners. As
individuals, these men acted as heads of
the various departments, and as a group
they formed the commission or policy-
making body.
Although the plan did not originate
there, Galveston, Texas, adopted the
plan in 1901, to meet the situation left
by a destructive tidal wave and a cor-
rupt administration. The five commis-
sioners along with an enthusiastic popu-
lace made an outstanding success of the
plan. As a result, other cities began
adopting the plan with the belief that
a cure-all form of government had fin-
ally been developed. They soon found,
however, that, while the commission
form simplified municipal government
on the one hand, it complicated matter*
by arbitrarily fixing the number of de-
partments and placed complete adminis-
trative and legislative control with the
same body on the other. They found
that without the impetus of a disaster
like the Galveston flood, the commission
plan was no better than any other form
of city government. Consequently, this
form of government is no longer being
adopted, even though about 300 cities
are now using it.
Although Staunton, Virginia, had
adopted the manager plan in 1908, it
was not until 1913 when Dayton, Ohio,
voted for city managership that it re-
ceived nation-wide attention. A com-
mittee had already been appointed to
draft a new charter, when in the spring
of 1913 the swollen Miami River
flooded the town, causing one hundred
and twenty-eight million dollars worth
of property damage and the loss of
eighty-four lives. The president of Day-
ton's largest industry was put in com-
plete charge of the city government.
The voters, recognizing the advantages
of having a manager for a municipal
corporation similar to the manager of
a business enterprise, over-whelmingly
adopted the council-manager plan that
same year. Since that time the number
of city manager governed municipali-
ties has continually increased.
The manager form of government has
as its basis the theory that policy-mak-
ing officers should be elected, while ad-
ministrative officials should be ap-
pointed. Since only the councilmen
have to be elected, the voter has a much
better chance of voting intelligently
than he had when the ballot was clut-
tered with the names of many adminis-
trative officers. Superior administrator?
are secured since they are not subjected
directly to the fickle electorate.
The organization of the manager
form of government (see Fig. 1) is
analogous to that of a large corporation.
The voters, corresponding to the stock-
holders, choose the councilmen, corre-
sponding to the directors, on a non-par-

points the city manager, the equivalent
of business's general manager; he ap-
points department heads, supervises the
work of the various departments and re-
moves incompetent employees. Since
there is no limit to the number of de-
partment heads the plan is applicable to
cities of all sizes.
The plan has proved quite popular.
At the present time 582 cities and towns
and 9 counties in the United States are
ager towns should explain the popularity
of the plan.
In 1925, Cincinnati streets were so
full of holes that driving was a risky
business. Two years after the adoption
of the manager plan, the streets were so
smooth that salesmen complained be-
cause they were unable to find places to
test automobile springs. In addition to
improvement of the streets the city
saved one and a half million dollars in
the first two years.

spite of a $273,000 bond issue during
the depression. It has built a $500,000
city hall, a 300 acre airport, and two
municipal golf courses; all are debt
free.
Although at no time has the status of
the city manager been seriously threat-
ened, it was never any stronger than at
the present time. The courts in Ken-
tucky and Arkansas have held that he
is an officer of the city, not an employee,
and the courts in general have upheld
his powers and prerogatives. He is ac-
cepted as a member of a profession com-
posed of a rather select group of men,
since at present there are only a few more
than 600 men engaged as city managers
throughout the world. He is still, how-
ever, the bane of politicians and often
under the continual fire from them. His
status within the government is strictly
that of chief administrator. As such,
his activities and duties fall along the
following lines.
For convenience in the succeeding dis-
cussion it will be advantageous to dif-
ferentiate between large and small cities.
No sharp line of demarcation can be
drawn between large and small towns,
but for our purposes the overlap can be
limited by a population of 10,000 on the
smaller side and one of 25,000 on the
larger side. When reference is made to
large or small communities in the subse-
quent enumeration of the duties of and
requirements for the manager, these
limits will be implied. The following
table gives some ideas of the resulting
distribution according to these limits:

Turning now to the activities and
duties of the manager, his general ac-
tivities will be considered first. The
manager, as was stated above, is strictly
the chief administrator. He takes no
leadership or responsibility in matters
of policy, but leaves such things for
the mayor. He does not participate in
elections nor become identified with the
candidates or political parties. He must
prevent the council from encroaching
upon his authority over departmental
personnel and keep up his organization
lines so that employees observe the
proper channels in reporting and in
seeking instructions. Furthermore, even
in large cities, he must handle citizens'
complaints.

TECHNIC
EXPLOR

anti-blackout flying suits
Centrifugal force is the outward force
which is exerted upon a moving body
when it is undergoing circular motion.
Consequently, when a fighter plane
comes out of a dive or makes a sharp
turn at high speed, centrifugal force
causes the pilot's blood to flow to the
lower parts of his body and to stay
there. This anti-gravitational pull is
known as the "G" effect. At a force of
"SG," or five times the normal effect
of gravity, many airmen "black out"—
they are temporarily blinded because
blood has been drained from the brain
and the heart is unable to pump any
blood upward. At "9G," a 160-pound
pilot weighs three-fourths of a ton, and
his 4-ton pursuit plane is heavier than
many bombers. His blood becomes very
heavy and collects in his feet and legs.
At this point a pilot is apt to lose con-
sciousness as well as his sight.
To counteract this effect, pilots of our
newest and fastest fighter planes now
wear pneumatic pants, known as a
G—suit. In using this equipment, pres-
sure is applied to the legs and abdomen
to offset the downward force of blood
during an abrupt turn or dive, so that
a pilot will not suffer temporary blind-
ness or unconsciousness. As a result, a
pilot can retain valuable time and con-
trol in out-maneuvering an enemy. The
G—suit has been used with great suc-
cess in Europe, and it was an important
military secret until the Germans dis-
covered its details.
As shown in the accompanying cuts,
the G—suit is similar to a pair of
tight, high-waisted trousers, with sus-
penders and a girdle built into the gar-
ment. The bladders in the suit are in-
flated from the compressed-air supply
used to operate the aircraft's instru-
ments. The suit is put on when the pi-
lot is ready to start on a mission, and
it can be worn partly open until it needs
to be utilized. Then the suit is zippered
together and an air line connects it with
the plane's compressed air system.
When the force of gravity rises above
2G, an automatic valve inflates the
bladders in the lining of the suit. About
two seconds are required to inflate or
deflate the suit. Even though the G—
suit gives a. flier a conteracting effect
of only 1.96 G, fighter pilots have re-
ported that the suit makes black-out
impossible. The use of this suit also
results in a great reduction of the com-
bat fatigue which normally follows
manuevers.
Since World War I, engineers had
recognized the limits of a pilot's endur-
ance to quick manuevering, and as
stronger and faster planes were devel-
oped, it became necessary to increase a
pilot's resistance to blacking out. It
was discovered that when a pilot
crouched and shouted, he tensed his
muscles and decreased the G—effect by
hindering the downward flow of blood.
However, this impeded his freedom of
movement during combat. Both the
Allies and the Axis air forces have at-
tempted to check the G—effect on their
pilots. The Germans designed an air-
plane in which the aviator would fly in
a prone position. The Japanese wrapped
their pilot's legs with tight bandages.
However, these methods were very un-
comfortable for the men. The Allies
decided to develop equipment which
would enable their airmen to withstand
the top performance of the planes. Ac-
cordingly, the first suits were designed
by the Canadian and Australian air
forces. Their first test in actual war-
fare came in 1942, when the Allies in-
vaded North Africa. Improved and
standardized to seven sizes, the suit is
now used extensively by both our Army
and Navy air forces.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the development of
smokeless powder
Smokeless powder is the propelling a-
gent which is giving our Navy's guns
the added firepower and range needed
for superiority over our enemies, with
the result that smokeless powder more
than anything else has enabled our
forces to achieve such staggering vic-
tories whenever they have encountered
the enemy.
This improved explosive, therefore,
should be of great interest to us because
of its importance in helping us to
achieve final victory. Originally de-
veloped in the chemical laboratory,
smokeless powder has required long
years of research before its properties
have been completely understood, in
order that it might give uniform per-
formance under all battle front condi-
tions. Chemically it is rather myster-
ious because of the diverse nature of
some of its ingredients.
The smokeless powder used by our
Navy is developed from guncotton as a
base, and guncotton is the explosive
product formed when cotton filaments
have been dipped in nitric acid. Gun-
cotton has been used for the heads of
torpedoes and for submarine mines. It
is this quick acting explosive which has
been regulated so that, in the form of
smokeless powder, it can be safely fired
in our guns and at the same time give
more power, pound for pound, than the
black gunpowder which has been used
for more than six hundred years.

Plugging in the G-suits airline.
Black gunpowder is composed of 75%
saltpeter, 15% charcoal, and 10% sul-
phur. A variation of this is brown gun-
powder, which utilizes charcoal obtained
from incompletely burned straw. The
quality of these propellants may be
modified by adding small amounts of
sugar.
Brown gunpowder was somewhat su-
perior, ballistically, to black powder, be-
cause of its "grain" composition. Each
grain of powder was a hexagonal prism,
produced under pressure and perforated
by several axial holes, so that the flames
of combustion would have continuous
passage through the charge. This dis-
tinctive quality of the grains enabled
the charge to burn more slowly, but
progressively. Thus, the brown powder
was completely burned, and a greater
power was developed in the powder than
in the abrupt explosive action of black
gunpowder.
One factor which contributed to the
need for smokeless powder was that only

MARGARET CARROLL, '46
For many a year Michigan students
have walked down the diagonal and
stopped to look inquisitively at a stone
stump, situated inside the engineering
quadrangle. Some probably sat on the
engineering benches and gazed at the
Greek letters, 2PT, imprinted on the
side of this stump. Those letters stand
for Sigma Rho Tau, the honorary speech
society for engineers and architects. And
that is the stump upon which prospec-
tive members stand to give their initia-
tion speeches. Perhaps you were one of
the gathering crowd, which stood with
mouths agape and eyes wide, listening
to the strange, arousing speeches. You
were seeing and hearing the "stump
speakers" in action.
In 1926 a society was organized by
Professor Menefee and a group of boys
interested in developing the ability to
speak well. Then in 1929, Professor
Brackett, of the speech department, and
another group of boys injected some
new ideas and more vitality into the
organization. All worked together to
make the society a strong and perma-
nent one. They pledged themselves to
"develop an engineering platform among
the engineering colleges of the United
States, not only to develop speakers,
but also to keep engineering subjects
before the general public."
With this goal in mind, the organiza-
tion set up its rules and policies. They
decided to have four stages of member-
ship. Those students who had just
started their speech training were called
neophytes. After proving themselves
worthy of membership in the society,
they were initiated and given the rank
of novice. In the time there were a
few novices who had done outstanding
work, both in Sigma Rho Tau and in
campus activities, and they became as-
sociate members. Finally, some received
the honored distinction of becoming full
members.
Sigma Rho Tau also outlined its
training program at that time. Unlike
so many debating societies and speech
organizations, Sigma Rho Tau decided
to train its members in the delivering
of project speeches, extemporaneous and
impromptu speeches, Hall of Fame
speeches, and entertaining stories and
funny jokes, as well as in debate techni-
ques. The stump speakers invented and
introduced the Conference Debate. So
often the engineer or architect has to
present new ideas to his employer or
those with whom he is working. And
how often he finds himself incapable of
proving his point! That was the very
reason for using the project speech in
the training program. Similarly, all the
other forms of speech training were de-
signed to meet the needs of professional
men.
Due to this strong "plan of attack"
the society grew rapidly. Its member-
ship increased to over one hundred stu-
dents and a large number of faculty
members, who were eager to share in
such an opportunity to improve the
Sigma Rho Tau Stump.
technical man's speaking ability. Sigma
Rho Tau gained a fine reputation and
soon the Literary College debating team
and the lawyers stopped resting on their
laurels. It was time for them to jump
on their hobby horses and get ready to
meet those mighty engineers. Ever since
they have been very wary of accepting
the stump speakers' challenges.
This reputation of Sigma Rho Tau
soon spread to other colleges and univer-
sities. They too wished to organize such
a society and steps were taken to fulfill
their requests. Sigma Rho Tau became
a national organization; the University
of Michigan group was called the Alpha
chapter, and other chapters were estab-
lished. At present there are seven chap-
ters—the eighth is up and coming. With
the establishment of these new groups
came the idea of having intercollegiate
debates. A chapter would schedule a
debate with one of the others and send
its representatives to the big event.
This proved to be a good test of a
speaker's ability for he found himself
confronted by strange, unfamiliar faces.
Realizing the benefits to be gained by
this inter-chapter work, the members de-
cided to hold a convention each spring.
The chapters send men to the contests to
compete in the various events. There
are contests for project speaking, ex-
temporaneous speaking, and all the
other types of speaking. Everyone is
out to win and the result is a top notch
performance.
Perhaps you have been wondering,
though, what Sigma Rho Tau is doing
now. The best answer would be that its
members are continuing to "learn to
speak by speaking." Today it is neces-
sary to eliminate a great deal of the in-
ter-collegiate work. Yesterday one could
hop into the car and drive to Toledo or
Detroit for a contest. Though that can-
not be done so easily nor so frequently
now, meetings are still held every other
month with the Detroit chapters. These
are being run, temporarily, as round ta-
ble discussions, rather than as debates,
on such pet topics as "Recognition of
the Engineer as a Professional Man"
and "Who Should Carry the Burden of
Expenses Involved in Expanding Public
Utilities' Services?"
In the weekly meetings, the time is
devoted to training. Heated debates are
run on timely subjects, people are
elected to Sigma Rho Tau's Hall of
Fame by biographical sketches, new
projects such as the jet propelled plane
are presented, and jokes and stories are
told. The work is interesting and bene-
ficial, and will be greatly expanded in
the years to come.

CHNIC
FLECTS
One day between the end of our "va-
cation," and the beginning of classes
your reporter was browsing around Ye
Olde TECHNIC office. Looking around
to see what changes had taken place
since he had been there last (one week
before), he saw a dust covered wooden
file in a corner under a desk. Never
having noticed it there before (the cor-
ner being dark) he succumbed to his
curiosity and decided to peer inside.
Upon opening the drawer three inches,
the front readily parted its long com-
pany with the sides and your reporter
was thereupon several inches in bound
sheafs of paper. Upon closer inspection
these turned out to a file of Technics
of the last twenty-five years. The result
of several hours reading of these relics
are the following tidbits.

In November, 1922, the Engineering
Laboratories in East Eng. were well on
their way in construction; excavation
had started for the new Physics build-
ing which is now known as the Randall
Physics building. "Those persons who
have watched the digging progress, have
observed that the excavations were being
carried to an extraordinary depth. In
fact, the concrete footings of the build-
ing are being placed forty feet below
the ground level.—It is hoped in this
manner to obtain numerous rooms in
which the temperature will remain con-
stant, and rooms which will be free
from noise and vibration of walls and
floors."
Also announced were the new field
house, and new power house equipment.
The new field house "will give ample
facilities for all intercollegiate and
intermural athletics—allow Waterman
Gymasium to be used entirely for phy-
sical education—put Michigan in a posi-
tion to entertain other schools and
colleges at large indoor track meets,
and will be an ideal place to hold the
Conference indoor track meet." The
new power house equipment consisted of
a new type stoker of flat-arch type con-
struction which makes it much easier to
replace badly burned bricks.
A prize tid-bit is as follows from the
same issue.
"Probably due to the inefficiency of
the track walkers, a cracked rail went
unnoticed and the sturdy little locomo-
tive U. of M. jumped its track. It was
on the morning of October Sth that the
University's own engine, hauling the
University's own coal on the Univer-
sity's own tracks, ran amuck on this
weakened rail, causing a damage of
more than five dollars. (Our friend Mr.
Menefee would have laid it to the fact
that the load was too great for the ulti-
mate shearing stress). It leaped up
from the rails and tore up approxi-
mately three feet of the "Hand that
feeds it," better known as the third
rail.
For the benefit of those who are not
acquainted with the U. of M. railroad,
we might state that the equipment of
the railroad includes more than a mile
of track in addition to the electrically
driven locomotive. The engine is an ex-
act enlargement of the "electric train"
a certain Santa Claus brought us some
time ago. Its chief function is to convey
coal from the Michigan Central tracks
to the power house and this is a very
important function since the B.T.U.'s
it brings to the power house are the
very B.T.U.'s that keep us warm in our
classrooms,"
It was in this issue that "Spicy Slices"
changed its name to "Transitory-Slants"
with some morsels such as the follow-
ing;
"Gee, this tea is weak, it must have
strained itself getting into the cup."
"Naw, it's on the verge of consump-
tion."
In the issue of January 1922, we find
an article on the "All-metal Airplane"
which predicts, "Recent developments
are bringing into prominence the abso-
lute surety that future airplanes will be
built of metal." This issue announced
the reorganization of the University
Aeronautical Society, the new course in
Industrial Engineering to be headed by
Prof. Gordy, and the building of the
new Clements Library.
One sign of the times on the humor
page, (then called "Spicy Slices;)
"One can't get a drink now except
with a doctors's prescription."
"Yes, I was thinking about telling
my son to stop studying Engineering
and take up Medicine."
And just to show that things haven't
changed much in the last twenty-four
years here's another.
Boarder—Here's a nickel I found in
the hash.
Landlady—Yes, I put it there.
You've been complaining I understand,
about the lack of change in your meals.
The issue of March, 1922 (the
TECHNIC was published quarterly at
this time) proposed a plan whereby
20,000 to 30,000 people would be able
to hear Charles Evans Hughes address
the senior class at commencement. The
idea was that the ceremonies be held
in the stadium at Ferry Field and the
acoustical problem be taken care of by
the recently developed amplifier system
such as had been used at President
Hardings inauguration.
Spicy Slices included;
Prof, in M.E. 3—Define an eccentric.
Student—Something of which the
center isn't in the middle.
"There are two things you can't dis-
guise; a man and a Ford."
"How can you tell?"
"By the clutch."
Eve (from the bushes)—"Adam,
dear, close your eyes so that I can come
home."
Adam—"What's the matter, my
own?"
Eve—"I've been A.W.O.L."
To be college bred, means four years
loaf, requiring a great deal of dough, as
well as plenty of crust.
Ec. Prof.—"Give me an example of
some force causing an upward move-
ment of foodstuffs?"
Stude:—"Sea sickness."
Well, so much for this issue; next
month we intend to reflect upon some
thoughts of an American who visited
Japan over twenty years ago.

The A.S.M.E. wound up its activities
for the fall semester with a meeting at
the Rackham amphitheater on Feb. 7.
Mr. C. E. Chayne, chief engineer in
charge of engineering in Buick's plants
at Flint, Mich., and Melrose Park, 111.,
was the evening's speaker. He presented
a sound 'motion picture that followed
the work on radial aircraft engines from
the first operations through the final
inspections and testing, showing many
of the latest innovations in foundry,
machining, assembling, and testing prac-
tice. The picture also included opera-
tions on shells, gears, and the M-18
tank destroyer, with shots of the tank
destroyer in action.
Mr. Chayne concluded a very interest-
ing and informative meeting by answer-
ing and discussing numerous questions
that were asked concerning manufactur-
ing problems, engine performance, and
post-war design trends.

guished educator and a true friend of his
students but a real gentleman as well.
Professor Pawlowski's interest in
Aeronautics was kindled long before the
epic flight of the Wright brothers in
1903. In the 1880's, while still attend-
ing secondary school, Professor Pawlow-
ski happened to see a drawing of Al-
phonse Penaud's model airplane in a
popular scientific French book; and he
spent the next eighteen months con-
structing similar models until he finally
succeeded in producing one capable of
a stable flight of ten seconds duration.
His greatest discouragement was not
due to his lack of knowledge, but to the
fact that his fellow classmates ridiculed
him and accused him of possessing an
empty dome for a head with little birds
flying around in it.
Professor Pawlowski studied engineer-
ing in Germany where he received a
combined degree in Mechanical and
Electrical Engineering; after which he
worked as draftsman, designer, pro-
duction engineer and finally chief en-
gineer in Poland. At this last position
he publicly suppressed his interest in
aeronautics at the request of the gen-
eral manager of the company, for it was
usually considered a poor policy to em-
ploy a "lunatic" in such a responsible
position as chief engineer. Nevertheless,
when, due to some troubles with Rus-
sian authorities, he was obliged to leave
his native country, Poland, he went to
France, where at LeMans he witnessed
the historical flights made by Wilbur
Wright, whom he met at that occasion.
He also met Orville in the spring of
1909 in Pau where the Wright brothers
established the first school for airplane
fliers. Having found it beyond his
means to join the school full of wealthy
sportsmen and aristocrats, he returned
to Paris, where the first chair in aero-
nautics had been established at the Un-
iversity of Paris, Sorbonne, in 1909, and
was among the first to enroll.
After completing this course, in 1910,
he set out to build an airplane. His
endeavors finally resulted in a mono-
plane with a twenty-seven horse-power,
three cylinder Anzani engine.

Felix W. Pawlowski.
To build the plane was one proposi-
tion, to fly it another. To familiarize
himself with the plane, he spent a great
deal of time taxiing along an airfield
which was one square kilometer in area,
at Issy-les-Moulineaux near Paris.
When he reached the boundary of the
field, it was necessary for him to throttle
down the engine, jump from the plane,
grab the tail of the ship, swing it
through an arc of 180 degrees, jump
back to the cockpit and then taxi to
the opposite end of the field. This
procedure eliminated stopping the en-
gine and throwing the prop at each end
of the field which might have been ac-
companied by the loss of an arm or two.
After many flights of ten to fifteen
minutes duration, his plane was finally
destroyed in its second crash. Professor
Pawlowski considers himself very for-
tunate in that the only injury to him-
self was a few broken bones.
After these experimental flights Pro-
fessor Pawlowski came to this country
and having been refused employment
by Glenn Curtiss and Orville Wright,
he worked for two years in the auto-
motive industry as a designer. At the
same time, he wrote to the major en-
gineering schools in the country, pro-
posing to offer courses in what is now
known as Aeronautical Engineering.
His initiative was rewarded by replies
from the deans of the schools—most of
them asking what kind of a joke he was
trying to play on them or stating blunt-
ly that aeronautics would never amount
to anything worthwhile. Only two
schools believed to the contrary: M.I.T.
and Michigan.
Through the foresight of the late
Dean Mortimer E. Cooley, Professor
Pawlowski was offered a position here
in 1912 as an instructor in the Depart-
ment of Mechanical Engineering with
the prospect of teaching aero courses at
the most opportune moment. Professor
Pawlowski started teaching regular
courses leading to the degree of Bach-
elor of Science in Aeronautical En-
gineering in February, 1915. This was
the first such course in the U. S. The
regents established the degree in Aero-
nautical Engineering in 1916 and the
holder of the first degree, a member of
the class of 1916, is Flavius E. Laudy,
now a Lieutenant-Colonel in the A.A.F.
Professor Pawlowski's ability in the
field of aeronautics has been widely re-
cognized. In 1916 he and Donald Doug-
las were engaged as the first aeronauti-
cal engineers for the U. S. Army. Dur-
ing his summer vacations he has done
research work for NACA at Langley
Field, Va., and for the Army at McCook
and Wright Fields.
Professor Pawlowski is one of the
Founder Members and a Fellow of the
Institute of the Aeronautical Sciences.
Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Soci-
ety of London and member of Sigma Xi
and many other professional and sci-
entific organizations. He is also a mem-
ber of the Early Birds, a very exclusive
organization because its membership is
composed of those who have piloted
balloons or airplanes within the first
thirteen years following the first flights
made by the Wright brothers, i.e. Dec.
17, 1916.
Perhaps the summer term will mark
the end of the career of Professor Paw-
lowski as an educator for he is nearing
the retiring age; nevertheless, his reign
will be long remembered in the hearts
of his students as part of the tradition
that has made Michigan a great Univer-
sity.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Proving that it IS possible to receive
two degrees in eight terms, John Stock
will receive one in Physics and one in
Mechanical Engineering next fall. Need-
less to say, he is an exceptionally bril-
liant student, gifted in many lines.
One of his most outstanding accom-
plishments is still in the making. With
a high-school friend, he is building a
six foot model tugboat with a 155 pound
displacement. His tug is steam powered,
having a Scotch marine boiler, twelve
inches in length and eight in diameter.
The vessel, which was launched last
June, is to be radio-controlled after the
war. John is now working on some of
the superstructure details and on the
electrical equipment.
John R. Stock.
Besides spending much of his time on
this project, John has found ample time
to become a high-honor student. In his
freshman year, he joined Phi Eta Sigma,
which requires a 3.5 (B+) average
for membership. He is now a member
of Tau Beta Pi, highest engineering
honor society.
John has numerous htobbies, to which
he devotes much of hi* spare time. He
likes music and has played flute and
piccolo in the Michigan Concert Band.
He is actively interested in radio, and
through his first class radiotelephone
license, he is able to operate practically
any radio station. His scientific mind
also enjoys astronomy, and he plans to
visit the Phillipines in 1955 to see the
total eclipse of the sun then.
This is by no means the end of his
interests. John likes mountain climbing,
swimming, and above all, canoeing. Be-
fore coming to the University, he spent
most of his summers in the Timagami
district of northern Ontario. His out-
standing work in mathematics earned
for him the Miller Prize, awarded for
the best undergraduate engineering work
in math. He works for the Student Re-
ligious Association at Lane Hall, and
last but not least, he is employed by
Engineering Research in a grinding pro-
ject.
John does not expect to leave school
after receiving his two degrees. He
wishes to take more courses, especially
in Mathematics, Architecture, Music,
and Philosophy. Here is a boy who will
undoubtedly have one of the most varied
accumulations of knowledge on this
campus.
hess bros., inc.
George Hess and Bob L. Hess are
NOT twins, and they want the world
to know it! These two brothers from
Benton Harbor will graduate in June,
having completed eight semesters of
work at Michigan. They will receive
degrees in Mathematics and Engineer-
ing Mechanics.
Both boys are members of the V-12,
and will have to postpone many of
their plans until after the war. Never-
theless, they have mapped out a prom-
ising future for themselves.
George hopes to come back to school
and study philosophy and physics. He
is especially interested in the strength
of materials from a molecular-physics
point of view, and will undoubtedly
work for his Ph.D. in this line. George
has already had practical experience in
the business world. He worked his way
up from time keeper to personnel mana-
ger, while employed by the New Pro-
ducts Corp., of Benton Harbor. In addi-
tion to this practical experience, George
should be praised for his scholastic
achievements. In his Freshman year,
he was elected to membership in Phi
Eta Sigma, and now, as a senior, he is
president of Tau Beta Pi!
George thinks that Michigan is an
excellent school, although he does offer
a few suggestions of his own. He be-
lieves that all engineering students
should have more direct contact with
practicing engineers. In this way, the
student could acquire familiarity with
work in his own specialized field.
George further believes that through
courses such as philosophy and the de-
velopment of mankind, the student
could obtain the understanding for his
fellowmen that is essential for all pro-
fessional men.


George and Robert Hess.
Bob has also made extensive plans
for the future. His ambition is to ob-
tain a Master's Degree in Mechanical
Engineering, by carrying on his work
in vibration and gas turbines. Then,
after obtaining some practical exper-
ience in industry for two or three years,
he hopes to work on his Ph.D.
Bob has also made a name for himself
in the scholastic world, and is, at pres-
ent, corresponding secretary of Tau
Beta Pi.
Bob agrees with his brother that en-
ineering students should come into di-
rect contact with the exact type of work
they plan to go into after graduation.
He suggests that conducted tours through
certain industries might add greatly to
the students' store of knowledge. He
further believes that a few courses in So-
cial Studies would be most beneficial for
Engineering Students.
Both boys are especially interested in
vibration and mathematics, and hope
to go into business together after they
have received their doctors' degrees.
They may become consulting engineers,
but whatever they decide to do, they
will do it together.
Both Bob and George are engaged to
Ann Arbor girls, and are patiently
awaiting the day when they can design
and build their own homes, and settle
down in a comfortably small town. It
must be emphasized again that George
is twenty-two, while Bob is twenty, and
the boys are most definitely NOT
twins!

for one month it was subjected to ex-
cessive dampness and dryness alter-
nately applied. Temperatures reached
107° Fahrenheit, relatively humidity 80
per cent, while temperatures on the ex-
terior reached as low as 10° above zero.
The results of these tests were en-
couraging. Our allowance of Vs in. for
lateral expansion of panels proved suffi-
cient. Warping of panels was very slight
and not enough to prevent their reuse in
later models. Condensation of moisture
within the core of the panel was negligi-
ble, as it had been in the first test
panel. No delamination of panels oc-
curred, but there was a slight separation
of plywood from core in the door.
Following the experience gained on
this first unit, two more were con-
structed. These two and the first one
were then assembled out-of-doors to
form a 16 ft. by 24 ft. three-unit, mini-
mum war house. The major change
from the first model was a double floor
construction to form a plenum chamber
through which heat could be circulated.
The window construction was also sim-
plified.
A special forced-air coal-burning fur-
nace was designed and constructed with
reversed air flow to force the heat down-
ward, distribute it throughout the
plenum chamber and exhaust it through
registers located in the floor close to the
exterior walls. The furnace was located
in the kitchen. A test of this heating
system showed an even distribution of
heat and sufficient volume to be highly
satisfactory.
The openings in which the registers
were located were also used for access to
bolts which united the units below the
floor line. Where registers were unnec-
PREFABRICATION
(Continued from page 21)
essary, a solid panel flush with the floor
filled the hole. Units were united and
secured at ceiling level by bolts through
the 2 x 12 girts. These boltheads were
eventually covered with small cover
plates which, with their regular spacing,
produced a decorative effect.
Roof joints where units came together
were sealed with a metal channel mold-
ing similar to that used for wall joints,
but in addition this molding was set in
and covered with asphaltic-type roofing
mastic.
With a reasonably satisfactory build-
ing technique established, the next step
was to test its practicality in commercial
production.
A house plan was chosen which would
require seven complete standard units,
two standard roof panels, and a special
storeroom unit, 3 ft. by 12 ft. in plan,
to support one end of the two roof
units. This house was one of a series
requiring from three to ten units to pro-
duce eight different sizes. At each size
the house was planned to be complete
and present a finished appearance. The
seven-unit size included all the compli-
cations found in larger models and ap-
peared to be representative of the build-
ing technique.
The nucleus of this series of plans
was the utility unit in which was assem-
bled all the heating and plumbing
equipment. This included a complete
bathroom, a small laundry with wash
trays, and a hot water heater, the
kitchen sink and cabinet, and the fur-
nace. The kitchen work space and other
kitchen equipment was located in an-
other unit adjoining this utility core.
With this core unit and two adjoining
units, it would be possible for a young
couple to start housekeeping for ap-
proximately $2000 above the cost of the
lot, and enlarge their house unit by unit
as their income permitted and family
required. Non-utility would average
around $400.
This young couple we facetiously pic-
tured in middle life detaching a unit or
two from their house and presenting it,
along with a new utility unit, as a wed-
ding gift to a daughter or son, and thus
eventually reducing the house to a size
sufficient for their old age.
The temporary site chosen for this
seven-unit model was a level lawn ad-
joining our East Engineering Building.
In preparation for the unit, post holes
were dug to frost line and poured full of
ready-mix concrete from the delivery
mixer. Exact levels and alignment of
foundations were obtained by setting
pre-cast concrete blocks on these posts.
The entrance step and storeroom floors
were concrete slabs poured directly on
the ground without foundations.
The three units previously built were
reassembled for the bedroom wing of
the seven-unit house, but the remainder
were prefabricated by four manufac-
turers located in Detroit and Grand
Rapids. One company made the floor
frames; another, the roof panels and
windows; another, the wall panels and
doors; and a fourth, the rolled metal
sections to join the panels. Insufficient
time prevented the testing of sample
constructions from these several manu-
facturers and we therefore had to hope
that our first decision as to tolerances
would be correct. Of course, some ad-
justing had to be done when these ma-
terials were assembled at the site, but
we were gratified that our technique

TRACKING DOWN TROUBLE
This laboratory, ready to move anywhere on
short notice, runs down "crimes" against good
telephone service. Finding these threats is one
of the many jobs of the Bell Telephone Lab-
oratories' scientists. The "criminals" are such
things as threads of lint, traces of acids, or
sulphur compounds in the air—any of which
might damage telephone equipment.
In their interesting war work, Bell Labora-
tories' scientists have been on a new kind of
hunt. They have tracked down different ma-
terials for those hard to get, found others that
would serve in special conditions, and have
detected in captured equipment the kinds of
material the enemy uses.
These are some examples among many of
the ways Bell System research is helping to
serve America at war.

channel moldings gave the most trouble.
They were supposed to be pressed in by
hand; actually, rubber mallets were re-
quired in most instances and even car-
penter's hammers, at times, but never
the proverbial sledge hammer.
Utilization of the first three units for
the bedroom wing provided an oppor-
tunity for testing disassembly, transpor-
tation, and reassembly on a new site
several blocks removed from the loca-
tion of the three-unit model. The mov-
ing process was accomplished in one
day by six men, a University delivery
truck, and without heavy lifting equip-
ment. The units were jacked up one by
one with heavy timbers and the truck
backed under them. This process was
reversed at the new site. In spite of the
crudity of this method, the units were
not damage and no difficulty was en-
countered in their reassembly.
As previously stated, all units were
designed for complete factory fabrica-
tion and were to arrive at the site need-
ing only to be bolted together, con-
nected to utility pipes and wires, and
sealed at the roof joints. This method
PREFABRICATION
(Continutd from page 24)
was not possible with the final house
for lack of plant and equipment. The
entire assembly process was therefore
carried out at the building site without
protection from the weather.
The final construction differed from
the three-unit model in that the floor
frame was changed to open-truss-type
steel joists with a structural floor of
2-in. plank. These steel floor frames ap-
pear to be highly satisfactory and are
more economical than wood, but it is
hoped that the plank floor can be re-
placed by light-weight concrete.
An asbestos cement board skirting
was used to give a finished appearance
to the house at the grade line. This was
backed up with an insulation panel to
prevent loss of heat from the under-
floor heating system.
The edges of the dead level roof were
finished with a sectional prefabricated,
clip-on, overhanging cornice which can
be disassembled and reassembled as
easily as the wall panels. The cornice
was made of sheet metal on a light wood
frame.
Windows were outswinging casement
type with screens on the inside and pro-
vision for storm sash interchangeable
with the screens. Operating hardware
was the sliding sash type and the sash
were operated by a through-screen de-
vice of our own design.
The electric installation was a combi-
nation of Wiremold conduit carrying
feed wires horizontally at door-head
level and outlets built into the metal
channel connection moldings between
panels. This method was not developed
sufficiently and we feel that several
modifications and improvements are im-
perative. One point in its favor, how-
ever, is its accessibility for changes or
repairs. Even in its present state, it is
an improvement over conventional wir-
ing in frame buildings.
It is planned eventually to move this
house to a permanent location and com-
plete it for the use of a family. This
will test demountability and reassembly
and subsequently, weathering tests can
be conducted over a prolonged time pe-
riod.

A favorite story among writers and
speakers on the subject of city manager-
ship is the one about the manager in a
small town who was awakened one
morning about 4 A. M. by the ringing
of his telephone. The citizen on the
other end of the line complained that
the street light in front of his house had
burned out. Upon further inquiry, the
manager discovered that this condition
had existed for several weeks, but had
not been previously reported. Without
losing his temper, he informed the citi-
zen that the light would be repaired
immediately. That evening the manager
set his alarm clock for 4 A. M. and went
to sleep. Upon being awakened at that
unearthly hour, he telephoned the com-
plainant and asked him to look out the
window to see whether the street light
was now lighted. He then returned to
bed, thoroughly contented, for he knew
that once again a citizen's complaint
had been satisfactorily remedied.
The results of a study concerned with
the activities of twenty managers during
a typical nine hour day are reproduced
here as a further example of a manager's
movements:
TABLE 2
Talks with citizens in the off-
ice and over the phone 2 hrs.
Conference with department
heads V/i hrs.
Planning current activities and
future work 1 hr.
Handling correspondence 1 hr.
Formal and informal meetings
with council SO min.
Inspecting municipal activities SO min.
Attending meetings and talk-
ing before groups 40 min.
Preparing official reports 30 min.
Interviewing candidates for
positions 20 min.
Miscellaneous 20 min.
Considering now the duties of a city
manager, this following list of general
duties holds true regardless of the size
of governmental unit.
A city manager must:
1. See that all laws and ordinances
are enforced.
2. Exercise control over all depart-
ments and appoint, supervise, and
remove department heads and sub-
ordinate employees of the city sub-
ject only to civil service regula-
tions.
(Continued from page IS)
3. Make such recommendations to
the council concerning the affairs
of the city as may seem to him de-
sirable.
4. Keep the council advised of finan-
cial conditions and future needs of
the city.
5. Prepare and submit the annual
budget to the council.
6. Prepare and submit to the council
such reports as may be required by
them.
7. Keep the public informed, thru
reports to the council, regarding
operation of the city government.
In the smaller towns where these du-
ties will not, or rather, cannot be al-
lowed to take up all of his time, the
manager may have any number of other
duties. A study made by the Interna-
tional City Managers' Association illus-
trates this fact sufficiently. In 116 cities
with a population below 5,000 the man-
ager also holds from one to six of the
following jobs; city clerk or secretary
in 29; engineer in 18; road commis-
sioner in 18; treasurer in IS; tax col-
lector in 15; superintendent or manager
of utilities in 14; purchasing agent in
13; overseer of the poor in 13; fire chief
in 5; assessor in 5; and 23 other posi-
tions. In the larger cities these posi-
tions are held by subordinates and the
manager depotes his full time to the job
of management.
From the foregoing discussion of his
activities, the qualifications for a city
manager may seem obvious; neverthe-
less, some of the essential ones will be
enumerated. As was true of duties, there
are some general qualifications that are
required regardless of the size of the
community.
A manager must:
1. Be honest.
2. Be forceful.
3. Be tactful.
4. Be industrious.
5. Have foresight.
6. Have a sense of humor.
7. Be loyal to interests of the city as
a whole.
Experience dictates that he be a non-
resident before his appointment, but this
is not absolutely necessary. Further-
more, engineering graduates are espe-
cially suited for small towns since they
may be required to act as city engineer
in addition to being manager.
In the larger cities, however, a man
versed in municipal administration is
essential. As one writer puts it, "A
manager must be manager and leave the
technicalities of street paving, lighting,
garbage disposal, police patrol cars, fire
stations, snow removal, and smartly op-
erated water and power plants to the
technically skilled department heads."
In perfectionistic terms a manager
should be able to solve problems includ-
ing those of his subordinates. He should
be able to analyze any situation. He
should be able to plan. He should be
able to sell his ideas and then follow
them through. The nearer a man can
approach these qualities the better man-
ager he should be. From the preceding
examination of the qualifications neces-
sary for a manager, the question natur-
ally arises as to available training for
city managers.
A man with an engineering education
and some administrative experience is
fairly well suited for a small town since
a large share of the expenditures are for
public works, and also, as was previ-
ously mentioned, the town may have no
city engineer. Too often, however, an
engineer may over-emphasize public
works to the detriment of other phases
of municipal activity.
With the growth of the manager plan,
various colleges and universities have
set up one year graduate courses in city
managership. Among these are the Uni-
versity of Michigan, University of Cali-
fornia, Stanford University, Syracuse
University, and Texas Agricultural and
Mechanical College. The I. C. M. A.
also offers complete extension courses in
municipal administration.
Several sources of practical training
are likewise available. Numerous gov-
ernmental research bureaus have been
organized in which experience in munici-
pal affairs and administration is avail-
able to college graduates if they can
qualify for positions with these groups.
Some of the large cities employ assistant
managers and managers in small cities
often train apprentice managers who are
willing to work without pay. Once in
a managerial position, training contin-
ues, especially with an occasional ad-
vancement to a larger community.
It must be remembered that even
though a man may satisfy all the re-
quired qualifications mentioned above,
he can obtain the position only by coun-
cilmanic appointment. The selection of
a city manager is perhaps best covered

How Television Got its Electronic"Eyes'
As revolutionary as airplanes without pro-
pellers—that's how much electronic tele-
vision differs from the earlier mechanical
television!
Whirling discs and motors required for
mechanical television were not desirable
for home receivers. Pictures blurred and
flickered.
But now, thanks to RCA research, you
will enjoy all-electronic television, free from
mechanical restrictions—"movie-clear" tele-
vision with the same simplicity of operation
as your radio receiver.
Such "let's make it better" research goes
into everything produced by RCA.
At RCA Laboratories, world-famous sci-
entists and engineers are constantly seeking
new and better ways of harnessing the un-
believable forces of nature... for mankind's
greater benefit.
Electronic television is but one example
of the great forward strides made possible
by RCA research—opening the way for who
knows what new miracles?
When you buy an RCA radio or phono-
graph or television set or any RCA product,
you get a great satisfaction .. . enjoy a
unique pride of ownership in knowing that
you possess the finest instrument of its kind
that science has yet achieved.

1IT STARTS AS A MIXTURE of simple
metallic powders. Under heat and pres-
sure, it becomes the hardest metal made by
man . . . Carboloy Cemented Carbide. Its
uses are endless. In tools, dies and wear-
proofed parts, it is performing wartime
miracles of high production at low cost.
2 AS A TOOL! Official records show
"production of crankcases and gears
for aircraft engines was tripled, with the
same equipment and manpower, by the
use of carbide tools." And no wonder! For
they work at speeds and to close tolerances
formerly impossible in mass production.


3 AS A DIEI "In making tubing for
tanks," says the chief engineer of a
great tubing plant, "Carboloy drawing dies
have produced an almost unbelievable num-
ber of times the footage of any other type."
In sheet metal forming also, this miracle
metal is pointing the way to unprecedented
savings in production costs.
4 AS A WEAR RESISTANT METAL) The
use of Carboloy plates to insure uni-
form hardening made possible the success-
ful manufacture of the extra thin razor
blades so many men prefer. Carboloy inserts
step up the life of inspection gages, valves
and machine parts such as cams and bush-
ings as much as 100 times.

by the procedure suggested by the
I.C.M.A.
Whether appointing a man to fill a
vacancy left by the removal or resigna-
tion of a former manager, or one created
by a newly adopted manager form of
government, the council should agree
upon their procedure and general policy
in the selection of a manager. They
should also agree upon their relationship
to him after his appointment and should
decide upon a maximum salary so that
the candidate will have an idea of the
conditions under which he will have to
serve. When these items have been
agreed upon the council should appoint
a committee to receive and consider ap-
plications.
Upon completion of the preceding ar-
rangements, the council may secure ap-
plications by several means. They can
advertise in trade and professional jour-
nals, or they can refer to the Municipal
Yearbook which gives a complete list of
names of all managers and choose men
from this list. They will more than
likely receive applications from men
seeking such a position who have found
the vacancy listed in one of I. C. M.
A.'s bi-weekly bulletins.
The council's committee then investi-
gates qualifications of applicants. The
committee follows its investigation with
a report to the council on the suitable
candidates. If among these are men en-
gaged as managers in other towns, it is
preferable that the list be kept confi-
dential so as not to embarrass those who
do not receive the appointment. After
having agreed upon the four or five out-
standing applicants, the council inter-
views these men. At this time their
names should be made public.
Following the interviews, the council
should discuss their impressions of each
candidate and then hold an election
among themselves to decide the appoint-
ment. The vote should be unanimously
in favor of the appointee, but whatever
the vote, he should be informed of the
outcome for it will be to some degree a
gauge of future councilmanic coopera-
tion.
The future of the manager seems
quite promising, but so is that of the
profession. Council-manager govern-
ment has survived war and peace, de-
pression and prosperity and is still going
strong. More and more cities and towns

THE CITY MANAGER PROFESSION
and even counties are adopting the plan
each year. An increase in the number of
home rule states would serve to stimu-
late adoption to an even more rapid rate.
Only time will tell how completely the
manager can remake our municipal gov-
ernment.
One of the important factors in the
advancement of the profession has been
the International City Managers' Asso-
ciation which was founded as the City
Managers' Association in 1914. It was
launched as an unincorporated profes-
sional organization of city managers to
aid in the improvement of local govern-
mental administration. It is composed
of members and associate members. The
former are administrative heads of city
governments appointed by a legislative
body, and have served as such for three
years or more in conformance with the
City Managers' Code of Ethics. The
latter are administrative heads of mu-
nicipal governments and appointed by
the legislative body.
The activities of the I. C. M. A. are
financed by the University of Chicago,
(Continued from page 30)
the Rosenwald Foundation, and the
Spelman Foundation, along with the
annual dues of the members. Some of
its activities include publication of the
Municipal Yearbook, Public Manage-
ment, a monthly magazine, and a bi-
weekly bulletin, and occasional leaflets
of pertinent information. It offers lim-
ited consulting service, maintains a
standing committee on research, and
conducts an annual convention of city
managers. At the convention of 1915,
the famous charter incorporating the
manager plan was adopted. At an-
other of these meetings a code of ethics
was agreed upon. Also adopted at one
of the conventions was the name coun-
cil-manager plan, "as the term most ac-
curately describing a form of govern-
ment which leans as heavily on the
calibre of the legislative body as it does
on the competence of the manager."
From the material already presented,
it can easily be concluded that the job
of city manager is not an easy one; it
requires training and a certain amount
of native ability; the pay, as the fol-
lowing table shows, is good, at least in
the larger cities, but the manager earns
every cent of it.

In conclusion, here is C. A. Dykstras
definition of the managerial profession:
"This is the managerial profession—
planning, directing, using men, exercis-
ing imagination. An opportunity t&lt;
serve the people is the highest honor
and responsibility a man can seek,
and the greatest reward a man can re-
ceive is a public decoration—a public
job well done. The profession of man-
agement bids fair to become one of the
highest in American life."

which results from such an arrangement.
The amount of coal segregation in
any installation depends upon the kind
of coal, the size distribution, the mois-
ture, the velocity, and the size and shape
of the passageways through which the
coal flows. A number of illustrations
are presented herewith in order to indi-
cate what happens under various condi-
tions. It is not possible to indicate the
quantitative amount of segregation that
will result with the arrangements as
shown. This will account for the fact
that a few installations of these equip-
ment arrangements are apparently oper-
ating satisfactorily, whereas, under
somewhat similar conditions with the
same arrangements, results are often
very bad.

Let us consider coal segregation as it
will exist in the coal bunker fed by a flight
conveyor without a trough. The conveyor

and the fine on the left-hand side.
In the case of the steel silo with a
vertical center feed, Fig. 5, it will be
found that fine coal collects in the cen-
ter of the silo and the coarse will dis-
tribute itself around the periphery.
When coal is withdrawn from such a
silo, fine coal comes out first followed

by a mixture, which progressively be-
comes coarser.
In the case of a concrete silo, as
shown in Fig. 6, it will be found that a
fine-coal core exists on the side near the
elevator and the coarse material exists
on the side away from the elevator. As
coal is withdrawn from such a silo, it
will be found that the coarse coal re-
mains on the right-hand side of the out-
let downspout or chute and fine coal on
the left-hand side. If coal from such a
bunker is fed to a stoker hopper, whose
long dimension is parallel to the plane
of the illustration, it would be found
that the coarse material would practi-
cally all exist on the right side of the
stoker hopper and the fine coal on the
left side. Such an installation would re-
sult in a very poor fire.
On the other hand, if the long di-
mension of the stoker were perpendicu-
lar to the plane of the illustration, and
were on the right side, then the coarse
material would find itself next to the
boiler, and the fine material on the side

GOOD LUCK




to have Galvanized Roofin
on Buildings
For in these days of material scarcities,
galvanized roofing can be taken care of
by simple, easy means and made to last
a lifetime.
Galvanized roofing is zinc-coated roofing;
and the U. S. Bureau of Standards states that
zinc is "by far the best" protective metallic coat-
ing for iron or steel! Zinc in the form of galvan-
izing provides double protection:
First, by simple coverage, with a sheath of
rust-resistant metal.
Second, by electro-chemical action or "sacri-
ficial corrosion."
Galvanized roofing is used on more than a
third of all the farm buildings in the United
States — which proves that farmers are smart
judges of roofing value!
Take Care Of It!

It's just good business to take good care of galvanized roofing.
It is so easy to do it, too, that there's no excuse for neglect. With
reasonable care, galvanized roofing can be made to givei a
lifetime of satisfactory service. Get a copy of the free booklet
"How to Make Galvanised
Roofing Last Longer"
and the few simple steps to take will be made completely clear. The book-
let is valuable. It's free—write for it today.

gated causes little or no difficulty in
burning.
When coal slides down a Sloping
downspout, the coarse coal gradually
rises to the top of the downspout and
the fine coal sinks to the bottom. Fig. 7
illustrates this condition. Trouble ex-
ists in many installations of two-single-
retort stokers because of this fact; Fig.
8 shows such an installation. Inasmuch
as the fine coal settles to the bottom of
the downspout, the right-hand stoker
hopper receives the coarse coal whereas
the left-hand stoker hopper receives the
fine coal.
Fig. 9 shows segregation as it takes
place within the typical apron-fed hop-
per scale. The coal slides off the head
pulley of the feeder in such a manner
that it throws the greatest amount of
the coarse coal to the right-hand side of
the weigh hopper. In the event the coal
scale is installed with the feed belt par-
allel to the stoker hopper, then coarse
coal will be at one end of the stoker
hopper and fine coal at the other. But
if the coal scale is installed with its feed
belt running toward the boiler front,
then the coarse coal will be on the boiler
side and the fine coal will be on the aisle
side and no trouble will be experienced.
Fig. 10 shows a flat chute feeding a
stoker hopper which has its inlet flange
on the left side. This design puts a large
proportion of the coarse coal on the
right-hand side and the fine coal on the
left-hand side. Such an eccentric flat
chute causes a greater amount of segre-
gation than the center-feed chute.
Still another type of coal segregation
results from an infrequently operated
weigh larry. This type of operation
causes a coarse-coal seam that runs across
the flow of the coal. A similar coal-
segregation pattern is caused by a screw
conveyor which is installed along the top
of the stoker hopper and is operated only
periodically.

operators do not recognize this type of
segregation since it is periodic and not
of the streak type. In many cases it can
be eliminated or reduced by more fre-
quent filling of the stoker hopper.
elimination of coal
segregation
What should be done in order to cor-
rect coal segregation? Bunker segrega-
tion in general can be eliminated to a
certain degree by multiple points of
loading. In the case of a flight conveyor,
a trough should be provided with outlet
gates. These gates shguld be opened and
closed in such a manner that the bunker
will be loaded in horizontal layers instead
of from one end. In the case of a silo
with center feed, as shown in Fig. 6 or in
some similar coal-bunker installation, it
is often possible to reduce the amount of
bunker segregation by the employment of
chutes within the silo or bunker similar
to those employed at the University of
Illinois. This method consists of pro-
viding chutes which carry the coal to
several points in the bunker and there-
by reduce the amount of bunker segre-
gation by division. These chutes are
built with open tops so that, when the
bunker is nearly full, the chutes are
flooded. Hence, the bunker capacity is
not reduced.
Also, in some cases of silo segregation,
it is possible to move the elevator 90
degrees in plan and thereby change the
segregation pattern to one that will do
little harm to the fire. Segregation in
downspouts can be eliminated by turn-
ing the discharge of the downspout to-
ward or away from the boiler.
In order to eliminate coal segregation
in downspouts feeding two br more
stokers, as shown in Fig. 8, a vertical
division of the coal flow should be made,
as shown in Fig. 14. The elimination of
segregation caused by coal scales can be
accomplished by so arranging the scale
that the feed belt flows toward or away
from the boiler.
There are numerous means of elimi-
nating segregation caused by chutes or
distributors which put the coal into the
stoker hopper. Some plants reduce the
air flow under those portions of the
stoker that receive the coarse coal. In
other words, air segregation is caused to
offset coal segregation. Such a proce-
dure is far from satisfactory because
changes in the size and type of coal re-

(Continued from page 38)
quire a change in the air dampers. Even
with a mixture that remains the same
from hour to hour, it is impossible to
adjust the air dampers exactly. This
method also reduces the maximum
steaming capacity of the stoker.
Many plants have employed the
hand-swung spout, as illustrated in Fig.
IS. This arrangement consists of a sin-
gle pipelike spout with a hinged upper
portion. A handle is provided so that
the operators can swing the downspout
from side to side. The angle of the

ment of a cone.

swing should be maintained at the mini-
mum, otherwise there is considerable
force required to swing the spout over
the full width of the stoker hopper. For
this reason, the employment of hand-
swung spouts is usually limited to small
installations. For best results the spout
should be swung frequently and a coal
valve at the spout outlet should be
closed after the spout has been swung.
It is possible to install a plate across the
center of the stoker hopper to stop the
flow of coal when the spout is in the
vertical position. Such a plate is the
equivalent of an automatic coal valve.
Its employment will assist the operator
in getting better results.
Mechanically operated swinging spouts
are available. These give satisfactory
results from the segregation point of
view if the spouts are swung the full
width of the stoker hopper, and if the
speed of the spout is reasonably rapid.
Baffles have been installed within the
flat fan-shaped chutes in an attempt to
eliminate the segregation caused within
these chutes. Designs of baffles have
taken numerous forms. In some cases
they help a little; usually they impede
the flow of coal to such an extent that
they prove to be unsatisfactory. In no
case, however, can baffles installed in a
flat chute be considered as nonsegregat-
ing chutes.
In some plants a chute the full width
of the stoker hopper is run up to the
bunker. Since there is no change in
cross-sectional area, such a chute will
not cause segregation within itself.
However, this design makes it impera-
tive that there be no bunker segrega-
tion, otherwise, the bunker segregation
will travel directly through the chute
itself. Likewise, the length of the
bunker should be substantially the same
dimension as the length of the stoker
hopper. If the bunker is longer than
the width of the chute, then serious se-
gregation will exist when the bunker is
low because the coal fills the chute
from the parts of the bunker not directly
in front of this stoker. Such a condf-
tion is illustrated in Fig. 16.
Weigh larries can be employed to
eliminate segregation in stoker hoppers.
In order to do so, it is necessary to move
them frequently from one side of the
stoker hopper to the other. It is also
necessary to close the coal valve at the

weigh-larry hopper outlet so that the
larry does not discharge freely into the
stoker hopper when it is standing still.
If the larry is moved sideways at infre-
quent intervals, segregation will be
caused, and if the larry is allowed to
stand with free discharge of coal, the
segregation will be caused in the stoker
hopper, as shown in Fig. 3.
Good results or poor results will be
obtained with the larry, depending upon
whether or not the operators put suffi-
cient effort into their job to get a rea-
sonably nonsegregated fuel feed to their
stokers.
The conical design of the distributor
has proved to be satisfactory in elimini-
nating chute segregation. The operation
of this type of chute or distributor may
be explained as follows: If a lump of
coal were placed at the apex of a cone,
the axis of which is vertical and then
released, it would slide down any ele-
ment of the cone, such a A, B, C, or D,
Fig. 17. Now if a number of pieces of
coal were placed at the apex of the same
cone and released, the condition shown
in Fig. 18 would result, wherein all the
(Continued from page 40)
coal, regardless of its size or shape,
would be equally distributed around the
cone.
A segment of a cone, as in Fig. 19,
would produce the same result. In order
to deposit the coal along a straight line,
the conical segment is cut by a vertical
plate, as in Fig. 20. The coarse and fine
coal remain uniformly mixed in this
vertical drop, since the flow of the coal
particles is parallel. The concical nonseg-
regating coal distributor is formed by
adding such a conical segment to act as
a cover plate.
air and moisture segregation
In addition to coal segregation, there
are two other forms of segregation
which affect firing results on stokers,
namely, air and moisture. Air segrega-
tion is usually caused by poor design of
the air ducts or of the plenum chamber.
Many cases of poor fires on stokers are
blamed on air segregation, but in most
of these cases careful analysis has
proved that coal or moisture segregation
often produces a definite pattern, where-
as moisture segregation usually produces
a variable pattern. Most cases of mois-
ture segregation are the result of irregu-
lar tempering of the coal by steam in the
stoker hopper. From our observation,
it is recommended that, if coal is to be
tempered by steam, it should be done in
the downspout ahead of the distributor,
or the coal should be tempered by water
as it is introduced into the bunker.
The elimination of coal segregation
within the boiler plant should be done
when the plant is still in the design
stage. The illustration given herein can
be used as a gage to indicate where se-
gregation will occur. Well-considered
design will insure that the plant, when
built, will give proper operating results.
It is just as important to check proposed
coal-handling equipment from a coal se-
gregating point of view as it is to check
the drawings for dimensional accuracy.
In an existing plant coal segregation
may be eliminated either by proper op-
eration of equipment as installed, or by
revising that equipment to accomplish
the desired results. Improvement in
combustion efficiency, reduction of main-
tenance, and increase in boiler capacity
will result from so doing.


How this plant serves a town of 2500
as the Community Refrigeration Center

An ice plant of only 10 tons capacity
a few years ago, the Greencastle (Pa.)
Ice and Cold Storage now handles up to
80 tons daily, sells ice refrigerators, sup-
plies farmers with ice for cooling milk,
chills 600 tons of cherries in ice water
before pitting, ices many refrigerator
cars. • It stores 100,000 bushels of apples,
and freezes big hogsheads of peaches and
berries, all from its own packing house.
• Meats, poultry, vegetables, and cream
are frozen and stored. Twelve hundred
refrigerated lockers are rented. Fresh-
tilled calves and sheep (4000 per month)
are chilled before being shipped. • The
ice cream bar sells lunches; a cold room
serves as a milk substation; beer was
formerly handled at wholesale. Quid-
freezing of locally grown foods in great
quantity is the next step. • We believe
every progressive town can profit, in the
postwar world, from a COMMUNITY
REFRIGERATION CENTER. You are
welcome to make use of the consulting-
enqineerinq service and equipment we
offer for this program.

powder was used in propulsion. The re-
maining 65% of weight escaped as
smoke and as waste residue in the bore
of the gun. The resulting smoke ham-
pered the gunners' vision, and the pow-
ders were altogether too inefficient, be-
cause the wasted energy had to be han-
dled and carried along with the useful
part of the charge. Smokeless powder
was destined to solve both these prob-
lems.
Guncotton was first produced in 1845
by a German physicist. Ordnance ex-
perts attempted to adapt this new ex-
plosive to practical use, but the uncer-
tainties of the substance caused many
experiments to end in tragedy. The
United States Navy began research in
the development of smokeless powder in
the "eighties" of the last century. At
Newport, R. I., a plant produced gun-
cotton for torpedoes and mines, and an
experimental laboratory was stationed
there. It was found that when guncot-
ton was dissolved in a suitable mixture
of ethyl alcohol and ethyl ether, a col-
loid resulted which could be formed into

stable "grains" suitable for artillery
propellants.
In 1879, a colloid was developed
which burned progressively and was
decomposed entirely into gaseous pro-
ducts giving to the charge a high bal-
listic efficiency. A plant was estab-
lished at Indian Head, Md., to produce
enough smokeless powder to supply our
entire fleet. Initial production was
1,000 pounds per day, and by 1917 it
was 20,000 pounds daily. Today, this
plant is an important link in the pro-
duction system for supplying powder
for our armed forces.
Activities at Indian Head are a mili-
tary secret, but some information has
been disclosed concerning the process-
ing and performance of the smokeless
powders used by our Navy today.
These powders are not a mechanical
mixture like brown or black gunpowder.
Rather, they are worked up from cotton
into a chemical composition which is
converted into a variety of sizes of
grains. These grains burn progressively
and are completely consumed by the
time the projectile leaves the muzzle of
the gun. The pressure within the guns
is not as great as when old-fashioned
powders were used, but nevertheless the
total power developed is 2V-&gt; times that
of previous propellants.
Short cotton fibers, linters, are util-
ized in the production of smokeless
powder. The cotton is combed and
washed to remove impurities and for-
eign matter and is then dried as com-
pletely as possible. The material is
then converted to the chemical com-
pound which constitutes smokeless pow-
der. This compound is shaped into the
desired size of grains. Seperate batches
of powder are never mixed, so that the
grains will retain a more constant degree
of uniformity.
One shortcoming of smokeless pow-
der is that it ignites with difficulty. A
small charge of black powder is used,
consequently, to ignite the main charge.
Thus, the final reaction is not com-
pletely smokeless.
Much research remains to be done on
smokeless powder. Through constant
improvement, our Navy will continue to
use propellants which will be superior
to those our enemies mav have to offer.

Many industrial processes require the application of heat under
controlled conditions which makes the use of direct flames impossible.
Some of the temperature requirements are beyond the safe working
limits of steam so that other heat-carrying media have been devel-
oped. Research on proposed substances for this purpose has been
necessary to determine the characteristics of each and to check their
performance in given applications. The experimental unit shown has
been used extensively for this purpose.
The University of Michigan is offering a research service to indus-
try through sponsored projects and the work on the heat carriers illus-
trates one of the great variety of fields of study coming within the
scope of this service.

film of plastic
2/1,000,000ths inch thin
To study the superfine structure of
polished metal surfaces through the
electron microscope, plastic replicas
about 2/1,000,000th of an inch thick
—or about one one-thousandth as thick
as the cellophane wrapper on a cigar-
ette package—can now be made of such
surfaces. Replicas are used because it
is not yet known how to make a slice
of the metal itself thin enough to be
transparent to electrons. Although the
replicas are very thin, they are thick
enough to carry the impressions of the
delicate contours of the surfaces on
which they are made. These impress-
ions consist of variations of thickness
of the plastic film of a couple of ten-
millionths of an inch. This is about
the height of ten atoms piled one above
the other. The plastic replica is made
by pouring a very dilute solution of the
plastic Formvar on the metal surface
and allowing most of it to drain off. The
remaining plastic solution will evapo-
rate, leaving a thin plastic coating on
the metal surface. The coating follows
the hills and valley of the metal's sur-
face, and when it is removed, it is a
true replica of the surface.
secret weapon
now revealed
The veil of secrecy has now been lifted
in connection with an anti-tank weapon
which has been in use by U.S. Armed
Forces overseas since the St. Lo break-
through last summer. Although it has
been reported for some time that the
Army was using a new type of armor-
piercing projectile for tank and anti-
tank guns, details up to now have been
withheld. The new projectile which has
been so effective in combating German
Tiger tanks obtains its vastly higher
armor piercing ability from two factors:
the use of extremely hard and tough
tungsten carbide instead of steel for the
armor-piercing core, and much lighter
total weight of projectile. The latter
factor is important since it permits a
given gun to fire the projectile with a
much higher velocity. The muzzle ve-
locity of the projectile is around 3400
feet per second compared to a previous
2800 feet per second. Actually, the
combat effectiveness of the new project-
iles is even greater than is indicated by
their deeper armor piercing ability. This
is due to their higher accuracy, trace-
able in large part to their higher veloc-
ity and shorter flight time. With the
new projectile it is possible to hit tanks
in motion with much greater ease. Ac-
cording to reports from the front, Ger-
man tanks have been stopped with a
single shot at a range of 3000 yards.
One of the most important weapons on
which the Germans relied in the Rhine-
Land campaign was its new "Tiger"'
series of tanks with their heavier armor.
The new high-velocity armor-piercing
shot with its tungston carbide core has
proven an effective weapon with which
to defeat these tanks.

his radar equipment depend for their
very existence on the delicate relation-
ship between the expansion rates of met-
al and glass. A hard working electronic
tube gets hot almost to the softening
point of glass. If the glass were to ex-
pand faster than the metal used to seal
it, the tube would shatter instantly.
Likewise, a too-rapid expansion of the
metal seal would also break the tube.
The problem was to find a metal to be
used to seal the glass that had the same
coefficient of expansion as glass. Kovar,
an alloy of cobolt, nickel, and iron has
proved to be the best metal for this im-
portant job. Thousands of seals of Ko-
var stand guard over radar tubes in
battle today.

who has seen a whole vast western section
of America change in his lifetime as if by
magic!

I '■*■ A New Kind of
Horsepower it
Changing Your World
This is the story of what is likely the biggest
thing that has happened in our time . . .
of a new kind of power spreading throughout
the world. . . of a new force affecting our
lives, our outlooks, and our incomes as perhaps
only electricity has done since the turn of
the century.

The Westerner operates a ranch that was
literally made possible by power —
electricity and irrigation from the great
Boulder Dam harnessing the Colorado
River. Power which made possible the
conversion of millions of acres of barren
wilderness into fertile ranches and farms!

No wonder he's eager to hear the pilot
tell of a new super-power — such as that

which speeds the great Boeing B-29
Superfortress across theair miles to Tokyo
. . . power that makes possible a trans-
Atlantic flight every 13 minutes.

Most efficient power plant in the world,
today's Wright Cyclone packs a horse-
power into less than a pound of metal.
Four Cyclones develop more power than
the mightiest locomotive operating in
the Rocky Mountains .. . and already this
new power is changing ranches and
farms, business and homes . . .

These Cyclones help make possible the
operation of U. S. transport planes over
more than 110,000 miles of global air
routes. For example, 1,800 cargo ship-
ments daily leave a single U. S. airport,
and millions of miles are daily flown by
U. S. airlines and the Air Commands of
our armed services.

which the bar stock is passed at rates as
high as 80 feet per minute. If a flaw is
present, a sensitive electron-tube indi-

hot tip
Smokers may not realize it, but the
lighted end of a cigarette is so hot its
temperature is slightly above the melt-
ing point of aluminum or magnesium.
Using a thermocouple, made of extreme-
ly thin wires 5/1000ths of an inch in
diameter, it has been found that the
lighted end is between 1200 and 1325
degrees Fahrenheit. Despite the prox-
imity of this terrific heat to the lips,
no burns result, because fibrous mate-
rials containing spaces—such as the to-
bacco in a cigarette—are inherently
good insulators. Consequently, the tem-
perature drops off very rapidly from
the hot end.
50th anniversary of x-ray
Exactly 50 years ago Wilhelm Roent-
gen made his discovery of that wonder-
ful ray that has since proven a boon
to mankind and industry. Roentgen
called his discovery X-ray because he
was at a loss to otherwise define this
unknown quantity of great penetrating
powers. At the time, newspapers every-
where published stories, cartoons, and
even poems about the new "wonder
rays." They printed ghastly skeletons
of hands and feet of living persons and
extolled the mysterious powers of these
strange rays that could "see" through
almost anything. A few weeks after
Roentgen's discovery. New York news-
papers hit on the idea that the new
rays might solve such age-old problems
as spiritualism and soul photography.
One paper even reported that at the
College of Physicians and Surgeons, the
rays were used to reflect diagrams and
printed material directly into the brains
of students, thereby making a much
more enduring impression than the ord-
inary methods of learning. This report
was obviously false. Consequently, col-
leges and schools are still here and stu-
dents will study and learn the old-fash-
ioned way. Today the X-Ray has found
a multitude of uses and more applica-
tions of the ray are being discovered
every year.

The new type of foam plastics devel-
oped initially is resin resembling molas-
es. Within two to five minutes after it
is mixed, it begins to grow and foam.
In practically no time it develops into
a course-textured mass that is lighter
than rock wool, glass, or cork, and low-
er in heat conductivity than anv of the
three. Equally astonishing is the fact
that the resin is also self-curing. What
little heat is needed is generated by the
mixture itself. As soon as the foam
stops growing it is ready for use. The
plastic weighs less than two pounds per
cubic foot. Wartime uses of the plastic
foam are secret. But after the war, the
material promises to have many applica-
tions, especially where insulation is re-
quired.

IN ENGINEERING
1. TRUE ROLLING MOTION
This basic necessity is assured by making all lines coincident
with the tapered surfaces of the rollers, cup and cone, meet
at a common apex on the axis of the bearing, Figure I.
True rolling motion always has been incorporated in the
Timken Bearing.
2. POSITIVE ROLLER ALIGNMENT
During the development of the Timken Bearing, as speed,
load and accuracy requirements increased, various methods
were used to stabilize the rollers and prevent them skewing
in the raceways. The solution was found in establishing wide-
area contact between the large ends of the rollers and the
undercut rib of the cone, thus assuring constant and accurate
roller alignment around the periphery of the raceways. The
light areas on the ends of the rollers in Figure 2, show con-
tact of rollers with undercut rib of cone.
3. MULTIPLE PERFORATED CAGE
All the openings in the Timken Bearing cage, Figure 3, are
stamped out in one operation by means of multiple per-
forating dies made to extremely close precision tolerances.
This assures exact center-to-center spacing of the rollers
around the periphery of the raceways, so that every roller
takes its full share of the load when the bearing is in operation.

FLEDGLING ENGINEER
As was indicated in a recent issue of
the Technic, new things are supposed to
be in store in the way of education for
the engineer. ''Supposed to be in store"
is perhaps a good qualifying expression,
since as indicated in the article pre-
sented, the University of Michigan is
now to all intents and purposes meeting
the requirements set up by the Com-
mittee of the S.P.E.E. A feeling has long
existed, however, at Michigan as well as
elsewhere, that the engineer has not
been given a sufficiently liberal educa-
tion. Specifically, it has been felt that
the engineer on graduation has been al-
together too poorly equipped in a knowl-
edge of the social sciences, particularly
economics. Since the period after the
war will undoubtedly witness a new
spirit in engineering teaching here
whether or not there is any radical
change in curriculum, it is the purpose
of this article to suggest to the under-
graduate engineer and perhaps to the
faculty of the College, some of the
things that may be done to stimulate
interest in economics, in order that the
study of the subject may be something
more than a desultory procedure under-
taken by the student, not because he
ieels that the knowledge gained will
have an important function in his career,
but because the subject is prescribed.
At the outset, the writer wishes to
disavow any claim to being an econo-
mist, in fact, to insist that he is merely
an interested observer of what goes on
in engineering education, as well as of
what goes on in the economic world. It
has long been his conviction that a
knowledge of the industrial and ex-
change processes are so vital a matter to
the engineer as his training in expres-
sion, either in words or with tools. That
others share this view is revealed by the
following statement made by O. S.
Byer* some twenty-four years ago:
"What the profession really lacks
are two fundamentals, absolutely nec-

essary for any group strategically lo-
cated and desirous of leadership in
society. These are: (1) an intellect-
ual background based squarely upon
a comprehensive study of the eco-
nomic and political institutions of
society, their history, growth, and
function, together with a study of the
larger aspects of human behaviour
and rights; and, (2) the development
of a facility for intelligent criticism,
especially of engineering and eco-
nomic enterprises. A wholesome in-
tellectual background is necessary to
interpret the new position and its
prerogatives which the application of
science has created for the engineer.
A development of the critical faculty
is desirable in order that he may de-
tect the blandishments of cult, the
temptations of formulas and systems
expressed in indefinable abstractions,
and the pitfalls of the status quo."
Another thing that bespeaks the sig-
nificance of a knowledge of economics
lies in the fact that most men in the pro-
fession, those especially who have had
little training in economics, feel that
they missed something in their training
that would have been of invaluable aid
to them in their careers. To illustrate
this point, one of the vice-presidents of
the General Motors Corporation was
heard to remark, after he had heard a
speech by a leading economist, 'Why
couldn't I have been taught those things
in college? The information just pre-
sented would have altered many of my
decisions." Of course, the most cogent
evidence of the regard in which the
study of economics is held by the pro-
fession, is seen in the action of the Com-
mittee of the S.P.E.E. above referred
to. To put the matter in terms that per-
haps the student can understand bet-
ter than he can the language of a uni-
versity catalogue, the whole world, as
we know it today, is basically a
world of industry and trade. Religion
and philosophy and other speculative
branches of learning, no doubt, have
their place in the curriculum; their im-
portance can not be questioned. But, if
somehow a better understanding could
be achieved of the world of production
and distribution, our most vexing prob-
lems could be approached with some
measure of understanding.
It may be insisted that no reliable
set of fundamental ideas are held to by
economists and that at best economists
have little power in the shaping of
events. The writer would not, of course,
hold that there is one right set of princi-
ples or views. So far as education is
concerned, herein lies the crux, perhaps.
Too often in the past, it has been as-
sumed that the essential purpose of the
study of economics was to inculcate in
the mind of the student a particular
point of view and to foist upon him a
closed, logical pattern, the thought be-
ing that the fundamental purpose of the
study was to develop in the student a
logical mind.
There is another way to look at the
matter, however. Much has been said in
educational journals in recent years
about teaching "straight thinking." It
is the contention of the writer, and he

ABSORPTION REFRIGERATOR
J. L YORK
Instructor in Chemical and
Metallurgical Engineering
by

J. L York
On the third floor of the East En-
gineering Building, behind double doors
marked "Operations Laboratory," the
casual visitor is startled by an intricate
maze of piping with no obvious plan or
purpose, brightly painted a glossy white
with trim here and there of blue, orange,
yellow and black. This tangle of steel
is not an attempt by the faculty to con-
fuse the students, but one of the newest
additions to the University, the am-
monia absorption refrigeration unit.
In the summer of 1943 the Univer-
sity was offered this unit as a gift from
the Hoover Company, of North Canton,
Ohio. This concern, though known to
the lay public primarily because of its
vacuum cleaner, is well known to re-
frigeration engineers as one of the lead-
ing research groups and strong advo-
cates of absorption refrigeration sys-
tems. In connection with their research,
the engineers of the Hoover Company
had worked with the engineers of the
York Ice Machinery Corporation in the
design and construction of a special ab-
sorption system capable of freezing two
tons of ice water to ice each day. The
machinery was so arranged and built
that temperatures could be measured at
more than twenty points throughout the
system, pressures could be measured in
each separate space, liquid levels could
be read in each container in the system,
and all cooling water streams could be
measured. This arrangement permitted
extensive research to be conducted with
the unit if it were desired, and such was
the original intent of the Hoover Com-
pany.
Shortly after the entire system was
installed, tested, and some operation had
been carried out, the trend of the re-
search work at Hoover developed in
such a direction that the need for the
unit almost disappeared. Consequently,
the system was rarely operated and was
relegated to a show piece. Soon the
pressure of war work forced the com-
pany to utilize the space being occupied
by the unit, and it was decided to donate
it to a university where its special de-
sign, excellently adapted to research
and instruction, could be used to the
greatest advantage. Through the friend-
ship of Mr. H. Earl Hoover, an alumnus
of the University of Michigan, this in-
stitution was selected, and the gift was
accepted with pleasure.
In October, 1943, photographs and
information had been sent to Ann Arbor
to permit selection of a site for the
erection of the unit, and a staff member
went to North Canton to examine the
system and witness the initial disman-
tling operations. Employees of the
Hoover Company carefully separated
the principal parts of the unit, marked
them for convenience in reassembling,
crated and shipped the entire system in-
cluding all piping to Ann Arbor. The
complete shipment weighed more than
16,000 pounds.
Immediately, the problem of layout
and installation confronted the labora-
tory staff of the Department of Chemi-
cal and Metallurgical Engineering. The
arrangement used at the Hoover Com-
pany was excellent, but took advantage
of the special construction of their lab-
oratory, with its system of interlocking
gutters built into the floor and covered
with steel plates set flush with the con-

crete floor. No such gutter system was
available here at the University, and the
number and size of the different parts
of the system would necessitate wide
spacing and complex cross-piping; there-
fore, the system was carefully studied
for the simplest arrangement compatible
with easy operation and maintenance.
Scale-model cutouts of the system's
parts were arranged and rearranged on
a floor plan and elevation view of the
proposed site, resulting in a layout re-
quiring a minimum of cross-piping and
maximum of accessibility.
After this basic layout was approved,
the detailed layout for the installation
began. The parts of the system wer? set
in three banks, with sufficient space be-
tween them for a passageway. This
meant that all piping between the banks
must go underfoot or overhead. Under-
foot crossovers meant large openings
through the reinforced concrete floor-
ing of the laboratory or small ramps on
the floor, neither of which was satisfac-
tory, therefore, an overhead crossover
system was selected. All piping was then
to be confined to the spaces around the
banks themselves and the two main
crossovers. Ordinary drafting proce-
dures would have been too time-con-

therefore, the entire system was sketched
in four colors in perspective. This per-
mitted the elimination of most difficul-
ties in regard to the location of the
many different piping systems involved,
namely ammonia vapors, strong and
weak ammonia solutions, brine, steam,
cooling water, relief lines, transfer lines,
instrument lines, and the regular service
lines for the remainder of the laboratory.
By February, 1944, the system was
in operation as an instructional unit,
the first tests being made by a group in
the Army Specialized Training Program.
Since that date it has been in regular
use by all students enrolled in the
senior course, "Chemical Engineering
Laboratory." These classes have ma-
terially contributed to the success of
the unit by performing calibrations and
suggesting modifications and improve-
ments.
In any system using ammonia as the
refrigerant, the refrigeration is accom-
plished by allowing liquid ammonia un-
der pressure to expand to a lower pres-
sure. The liquid then vaporizes at this
lower pressure, absorbing heat in the
process. Because of the properties of
ammonia, this vaporization will occur
at low temperatures. For example, at
14.7 pounds per square inch absolute
(atmospheric pressure) pure ammonia
will vaporize at —28 degrees Fahren-

heit, while at 50 pounds per square inch
absolute the vaporization temperature
is + 21.7 degrees Fahrenheit. The heat
to be removed may be absorbed directly
by the ammonia or indirectly by an in-
termediate fluid, such as brine or air,
which is in turn cooled by the ammonia.
There is no significant difference be-
tween the ammonia absorption system
and the ammonia compression system in
the above part of the process.
In order for the process to be con-
tinuous it is necessary to convert the
ammonia vapor back to liquid ammonia,
so that the ammonia may be continu-
ously recycled through the system. In
the compression system the vapor is
sufficiently compressed so that it may be
condensed with the available cooling
water. The lower the temperature of
the cooling water the lower the pressure
necessary to condense the ammonia. In
the absorption system, the vapor at the
lower pressure is dissolved in a weak
aqueous solution. The heat liberated
during this absorption is removed by
means of cooling water. The more con-
centrated or "strong" ammonia solu-
tion is pumped to the higher pressure
and is separated by means of the frac-
tionating column and reboiler into sub-
stantially pure ammonia, which leaves
the fractionating column as vapor and is
then condensed by means of cooling
water, and the weak ammonia solution
used for the absorption, which leaves
the reboiler. The heat energy required
for this separation is supplied by con-
densing steam in the reboiler heating
element.
The operation of both types of re-
frigeration processes may be made
Fig 2B
clearer by referring to the schematic
diagrams for each process given in Fig-
ures 2A and 2B. Figure 2-A represents
a compression system. Ammonia vapor
flows from the compressor to the con-
denser, where it is cooled and liquefied
by water. The liquid ammonia flows to
a storage receiver, then is throttled
through an expansion valve into the
evaporator where it vaporizes at the low
pressure and extracts heat from the ma-
terial being refrigerated. This vapor
then flows to the compressor and the
cycle is repeated.
Figure 2B represents an absorption
system. The condenser, storage receiver
and evaporator operate just as in the
compression system, but from the evap-
orator the vapor (A) flows into the ab-
sorber and dissolves in a weak solution
(B) coming from the reboiler (some-
times called the "generator"). The
strong solution (C) is raised to the
higher pressure by a liquid pump, then
flows through a heat exchanger to be
heated by the weak solution. From the
exchanger the strong solution is intro-
duced into the fractionator (sometimes
called "analyzer") and is separated into
weak solution, which flows from the re-
boiler, and concentrated vapor (D)
which flows up to the partial condenser.
This condenser liquefies most of the
water and some of the ammonia in the
vapor stream, the liquid being separated
and returned to the fractionator. The
residual vapor which is substantially
pure ammonia continues to the main
condenser and the cycle is repeated.

tem installed in the laboratory. The

After almost a half century of re-
search and improvement, television is
ready for the public. It has reached a
stage of technical development which
is far in advance of radio at the time
radio was introduced. Preceded by sys-
tems of rotating scanning disks and
drums, electronic television is about IS
years old and utilizes no moving me-
chanical parts. Television images are no
longer hazy but are as highly defined
as home movies. Improvements on the
iconoscope tube used in the television
camera have corrected its color sen-
sitivity, so that scenes are more faith-
fully reproduced, and grotesque make-
up is no longer required. Methods of
producing fades, dissolves, wipes, and
superpositioning, commonly used in
motion pictures, have been worked out
for television.
At present there are 9 commerical
television stations and an estimated
10,000 receivers in the United States.
The Federal Communications Commis-
sion now has before it applications for
over 100 new television stations, and it
is estimated that there will be a market
for 30 million receivers in the first ten
years after the war.
broadcasting
A television broadcasting station is
necessarily considerably more elaborate
than a standard broadcasting station.
In fact, a television station must be a
sort of combination radio station and
movie studio. All the lights and props
associated with the movies are required
in television. The actors must be more
carefully rehearsed, for scenes can't be
retaken. The iconoscope in the televi-
sion camera is not as sensitive to light
as movie film, and consequently very
bright lights are used.
Some cameras employ electronic view-
finders, which are simply cathode-ray
tubes fed from the output of the cam-
eras. The advantage of this type over
the optical viewfinder is that there is
no displacement due to difference in the
position of finder and lens. The actual
televised scene is seen in the electronic
finder.
The scene being picked up by each
camera is reproduced in the control room
and is adjusted for proper shading by
an engineer. The output of any camera
can easily be selected, and the picture
is then piped to the transmitter by co-
axial cable.
The scheme for broadcasting sound
along with the picture is the same as
in sound broadcasting except that the
microphones must be kept out of the
range of the cameras, and the sound is
broadcast by FM.
scanning
The television image is not repro-
duced in the receiver instantaneously
but a spot at a time. This spot, which
is produced by a beam of electrons
striking the fluorescent screen of a
every second line until it reaches the
bottom of the screen. The spot then
returns to the top of the screen to
sweep out the picture again, but this
time it follows the lines it missed before.
During this complete cycle 525 hori-
zontal sweeps are made, and the cycle
is repeated 30 times per second. The
spot skips every other line instead of
taking the lines in order, because the
tendency for the picture to flicker de-
pends on the number of images pro-
duced per second. By tracing half the
lines on the first trip down the screen
and the other half on the second trip,
more images are produced per second:
namely, 60, and the flicker is impercep-
tible.
In the television camera is located
the iconoscope, which contains a mosaic

cathode-ray tube, starts in the upper
left hand corner of the screen and
sweeps horizontally across the screen
of the tube, changing in brightness ac-
cording to the picture shading. At the
end of the line it is extinguished, re-
turns quickly to the beginning of a new
line two lines below the previous one,
and sweeps across this line producing
more of the picture. This process is
continued, the spot sweeping across

electric particles. The image to be tele-
vised is focused on this plate. Each
tiny photoelectric particle releases a
charge according to the amount of light
striking it. The plate is scanned by a
narrow beam of electrons emanating
from the neck of the tube, thereby re-
moving the charge from each particle
one at a time. A varying current is

THE MICHIGAN TECHN1C

LAWRENCE C. MAUCH
Associate Professor of Civil Engineering
With the amazing development of
military and commercial aeroplanes em-
phasized in almost every newspaper and
periodical, it appears timely to consider
also the use of airships, particularly of
the rigid type, for commercial transpor-
tation. To make any discussion of this
subject of value, the reader must keep
in mind certain physical characteristics
that are common to all airships. The
most important factor is that all of the
lifting force that can ordinarily be util-
ized for carrying loads comes from the
difference between the weight of air
and of the lifting gas. In this country,
the latter is, of course, always helium,
for which the differential of weight is
approximately .062 pounds per cubic
foot. Therefore, the gross lift at sea
level is obtained by simply multiplying
the volume of gas by .062. The volume
of gas that can be used will depend not
only upon the capacity of the gas cells
but also upon the altitude or ceiling that
the airship must be able to attain. The
lifting gas will expand roughly one per-
cent for every 300 feet of elevation, be-
cause of the reduction in atmospheric
pressure. Accordingly, if the airship
must obtain a maximum elevation of
about 3000 feet, then, to conserve all of
the gas. the gas cells must not be more
than 90 percent full at sea level.
Therefore, only 90 percent of the gross
lift can be used for that trip. The possi-
ble use of aerodynamic lift to supple-
ment the static lift will not be consid-
ered.
From the above statements, it is ap-
parent that airships will operate most
efficiently and profitably over commer-
cial routes that will permit long flying
distances at low altitudes, such as trans-
oceanic routes. The more steady air cur-
rents that are encountered over the
ocean, particularly at low altitudes, will
also make the operational and mainte-
nance problems less serious. For such
routes, the lifting force can be calcu-
lated for about 95 percent of gross lift.
The pay load will then be determined
by subtracting from this lifting force
the dead weight of the structure and
ballast, the fuel and service load, and
certain miscellaneous items. The weight

Lawrence C. Maugh
of the structure will probably never be
less than 53 percent of the gross lift,
unless serious infringements are made
on the factor of safety that should be
used in the structural design. This ra-
tio of dead weight to lift is satisfactory
when compared to that for most aero-
planes.
The necessary fuel and service load
for airships is dependant primarily upon
size and speed. As the power require-
ment increases with the cube of the ve-
locity and the two-thirds power of the
volume, the cruising speed is a very
important factor in determining the fuel
load. In practice, any cruising speed
over 65 to 70 miles per hour would prob-
ably be prohibitive for a commercial
airship. However, this comparatively
low speed is partially compensated by
the range of flight that can be made by
an airship without landing. Large air-
ships can be designed for a range of
5000 to 6000 miles without landing, al-
though such distances are not often re-
quired. The service load, particularly
the size of crew and the food and
water for crew and passengers, will in-
crease with the size of ship and the time
of flight. If freight constitutes the major
portion of the payload, the service load
will not vary greatly with the length of
the route. In general a ten million cubic
foot airship can carry about 100 to 110
passengers, and some freight, over most
transoceanic routes with a cruising
speed of approximately 65 miles per
hour. The German airship L.Z. 129, the
Hindenburg, which was about a seven
million cubic foot ship, carried from 50
to 60 passengers and some freight.
Parallel with the question of carry-
ing capacity of a rigid airship come
the important factors of length of serv-
ice and operational costs. The length of
service, which also involves the safety
of the airship and occupants, is mainly
dependent upon the structural design,
construction, and operation. Although
all of these factors are important, only
the structural design will be discussed.
The structural design of a rigid air-
ship of the Zeppelin type, is usually sep-
arated into several divisions that arise
from the functional requirements. These
divisions as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2
are: the main transverse rings or bulk-
heads, the intermediate or stiffening
rings, the longitudinals, the shear and
gas-cell wiring, the empennage or con-
trol surfaces, and the engine mounts.
The main transverse frames or bulk-
heads serve to divide the gas space into

Lorenzo Plumpton, better known as
Butch, is a familiar figure to surveying
students as the man who is responsible
for all surveying equipment. Butch is
as much a part of the Civil Engineering
Department as the professors and is
very well liked by both students and
faculty. It is reported that Butch some-
times indulges in corn-cob philosophy of
no ordinary merit.

Lorenzo Plumpton
In addition to keeping track of over
$25,000 worth of equipment consisting
of about 40 transits, 40 levels, 19 ali-
dades, and numerous other pieces of ap-
paratus, Butch is responsible for the
proper maintenance of the equipment.
He must see that the instruments are in
good operating condition and secure
needed parts or materials. He has a
tag system of checking out instruments
and equipment so that he can tell at a
glance where each piece of equipment
is.
During the summer when Camp
Davis is in session, Butch can be found
there efficiently performing the duties of
instrument man. Recently, however, he
has been occupied here all year around.
Butch likes to farm on a small scale
and raises a variety of vegetables in his
garden. He enjoys lake fishing, and
likes to hunt rabbits and pheasants, but
says he finds it difficult to do so these
days.
Butch is a grandfather, having four
children and four grandchildren.
He was born in Stanton, Michigan,
and came to the University 16 years ago
as custodian for East Engine. Four
years ago he was transferred to his
present position. Butch likes his job as
instrument man, probably because of the
variety of characters he runs across.

Bill Culligan, June graduating aero,
is perhaps best known to Michiganders
for his gridiron feats, more specifically,
for his educated right arm. The passing
combination of Culligan to Rifenburg
was a natural.

Bill Culligan
Bill played prep school football in
Detroit where he made all state honors.
His one cherished dream was to win a
letter at Michigan; this he accomplished
last fall. When asked how he developed
his passing arm, Bill very modestly
stated that "it just happened."
His athletic accomplishments do not
terminate with football, for swimming,
baseball, and basketball occupy a great
deal of his spare time.
"Cully" entered the V-12 program in
June '43. He had a varied interest in
engineering subjects, but he finally chos?
aeronautics as his specialized field of
study. After graduation he would like
to service planes on an air craft carrier.
Bill is a member of Phi Delta Theta
social fraternity, is a past president of
Triangles, present president of Vulcans.
and a member of I. Ae. S.
Bill is engaged to a senior co-ed.
and after the war is over, nothing would
please him more than to settle down
and raise a family. He only hopes that
the "little Culligans" will have a
fondness for hot dogs (heavy on the
mustard), which is his favorite lunch.
Bill's funniest experience at Michi-
gan occurred last summer. It so hap-
pened that one day he decided to leave
his Aero 3 class 15 minutes before dis-
missal time. Just as he was maneuver-
ing to the door, one of his "pals" stuck
his foot out and as a result, Bill with
all of his books and slide rule made a
thunderous crash to the floor. The kind
professor turned around from the black-
board, and noting the precarious situa-
tion, saved the day by meekly asking.
"Is someone sick?"

The tails and tuxedos are once more
packed away in moth-balls, the engine
school has once more returned to a nor-
mal state of existence, for the strains of
"Robinhood" have died away and the
Slide Rule Ball is over. Yes, as we look
back, the dance seems like an all too
perfect dream—a dream of soft lights
and happy contented dancers. As this
vision comes into focus the Rainbow
room appears with its beautiful inter-
changing colored lights appearing even
prettier than before, for the addition of
a great wheel of colorful streamers has
transformed the Union Ball Room into
an Engineer's paradise of its respec-
tive organization. Up on the band
stand the orchestra adds to the color
by their brilliant red jackets, while on
the dance floor the most beautiful
girls on the campus complete the pic-
ture with a wide collection of stun-
ning evening gowns. Engineers, dress-
ed in tuxedos, tails, army, navy
and marine uniforms have a look of
satisfaction upon their faces, for this,
their dance, is Michigan's social life at
its very best. Louis Prima proceeds to

and "I Wanta Get Married." But at

the clock vertically upwards and as the
clock strikes midnight (E.W.T.) the
dancers disappear and our vision van-

The mystery as to what happened to
the slide rule has not as yet been solved.
The large slip stick was originally hung
up above the band stand. However, a
few members of the Law School (we re-
fuse to call them lawyers, for such is an
insult to that profession) believed that
they must carry on the old feud and
proceeded to take down the slide rule
and carry it away. This much is known,
but how and why the slide rule ar-
rived at the foot of the band stand is
the unsolved mystery of the dance.
The Lawyer-Engineer feud which
originated in 1927 has become famous
in the annals of Michigan. At that time
the lawyers took the rule from its cus-
tomary place over the arch a few days
before the night on which both the
Slide Rule and Crease dance were held.

"At the ball"
In revenge a party of engineers
including a few assistant professors at-
tended the Crease dance and raised
havoc throwing stink bombs and tear
gas as well as cutting off the lighting
current. In recent years the engineers
have had the usual trouble with the
elusive slide rule but have always risen
to the occasion and displayed the slip-
stick at the dance in all its glory.

LOR
the geared turbine
steam locomotive
Instead of experimenting with small
sizes first, and then working up to larger
units, the Pennsylvania Railroad has
gone whole-hog in a new undertaking:
the class S-2 geared turbine locomotive.
The S-2 has a main turbine rating of
6900 horse-power, making it one of the
most powerful, high-speed locomotives
in existence. The advantages of the tur-
bine have already been utilized in sta-
tionary and marine uses. The steam tur-

bine has substantially replaced the re-
ciprocating steam engine in these uses,
and now may prove a threat to the two-
cylinder engines of the conventional lo-
comotives.
The turbine locomotive is compared
here in a few respects with a conven-
tional reciprocating steam engine type
of the same boiler capacity and with the
same weight on drivers. Figure 2 shows
that at starting and at slow speeds the
tractive effort developed by the two
types are approximately the same. At
higher speeds, however, the percentage
difference of the two tractive forces
is quite substantial, the turbine locomo-
tive having the advantage. This means
that the turbine locomotive can acceler-
ate a train faster than the conventional
type, and attain higher speeds, or pull
a heavier train at the same speed. Fig-
ure 2 also compares the useful horse-
power of the two locomotives at various
speeds.
At normal speeds, the steam con-
sumption of the turbine locomotive is
less than that of a reciprocating type.
At low speeds, the turbine is at a dis-
advantage, but if it were desired to use
it for low-speed freight service, the tur-
bine itself and the gear reduction would
be altered to give more desirable per-
formance characteristics in the low-
speed range.
Another advantage of the steam tur-
bine is illustrated in figure 1. Because
of the elimination of reciprocating parts
the torque developed is uniform, whereas
the reciprocating steam locomotive de-
velops a pulsating torque. Uniform
torque is quite desirable from an engi-
neering standpoint, and also from the
passengers' point of view, since the
jerks and jolts of starting are eliminated.
The class S-2 (6-8-6 wheel arrange-
ment) is a geared turbine, noncondens-
ing steam locomotive. The conventional
fire-tube boiler is capable of supplying
95,000 Ibs. of steam per hour at 310
psi gage boiler pressure or 285 psi gage
and 750°F total temperature to the high
speed noncondensing steam turbine. The
unit develops 6550 hp at the rail at 70
mph; less at other speeds as shown in
figure 1.
The forward driving turbine is of
the impulse type, consisting of a Curtis*
stage followed by five Rateau stages.

How to make 2 wires do the war work of 20
As our armies push forward, they
need more and more communica-
tions channels. They get them
quickly—thanks to Western Electric
carrier telephone equipment.
Without carrier, 2 wires ordinari-
ly carry one telephone and one or
two telegraph circuits. By using
carrier equipment, more telephone
and telegraph circuits can be pro-
vided without adding more wire.
This makes maximum use of exist-
ing wires — eliminates the need to
manufacture, transport and install
thousands of additional miles of
wire—saves countless hours in pro-
viding vital circuits.
The Army, for example, uses car-
rier to obtain three telephone and
fourteen telegraph circuits over one
pair of wires. Even with the use of
much carrier equipment, the Army's
consumption of wire in France ran
as high as 3,000 miles per day.
Carrier telephone equipment has
long been made by Western Electric
for the Bell System. Army needs,
however, differ in many ways from
regular telephone requirements.
To meet these wartime conditions,
Bell Laboratories engineers de-
signed a revolutionary "packaged"
carrier equipment for the Signal
Corps. Self-contained, completely
wired for quick, easy installation,
these units have been produced by
Western Electric in vast quantities.
On every front, they are speeding

CHNIC
PLICTS
When in the course of the month's
events it becomes necessary for your re-
porter to pause and reflect for a while,
other work always manages to find its
way in, but ne'ertheless, here we are.
Upon reading the TECHNIC for
May, 1923, we happened across an ar-
ticle entitled ''Some Observations on a
Trip to Japan," written by Elmer A.
Sperry, of the Sperry Gyroscope Com-
pany. We found this article interesting
in the light of the events of the last few
years and since in this case hindsight
happens to be much better than Mr.
Sperry's foresight (or anyone else's for
that matter), we thought it would be of
interest if passed along now. During
Mr. Sperry's short stay there he was
treated very courteously and was priv-
ileged to view many things which were
not seen by the usual traveler.
In the matter of education, he con-
sidered the statistics shown to him noth-
ing short of startling. The Japanese
easily led all of the nations of the world
in the percentage of those of school age
who at that time were receiving educa-
tion. According to Mr. Sperry, our edu-
cational work together with their indus-
try contribute the largest share to giv-
ing them the right to aspire to true
leadership as a world power.
To illustrate the rapid advance of
science and the achievements of the
Japanese, Sperry told how at the end of
the 19th century, the Japanese bought
a little 13,000 ton ship from England.
The money was obtained from contri-
butions by the Mikado and government
officials who gave 10% of their salaries
to the cause. The startling thing is that
in s^ven years they were building their
own battleships—the first of 15.000
tons—and they made practically every-
thing themselves. He was taken through
two of the largest dockyards they have,
one of them four times as large as any
navy yard in this country, where they
took in Swedish pigiron at one end of
the place, and put out 33,000 ton bat-
tleships at the other end, with enormous
16-inch guns, turrets, armor plate, tur-
bines, gear drives, all made in the yard.
"In engineering and scientific activi-
ties," said Sperry, "Japan is without
question going forward with leaps and
bounds. Their tools, equipment, and
machinery in many branches of these
activities are the finest obtainable.
They are not being handled with as
great speed in some instances, possibly
as in our own country, but with caution
and excellent understanding. Their
principles are sound, and the product,
especially on any line in which they
have had experience, is of the best."
Sperry believed that there are no en-
gineers in the world who are more studi-
ous, devoted, or more enthusiastic in
their work. He continued, "There is
something that I cannot explain about
the engineers in Japan, except to tell
you that they have no traditions, pre-
cedents or ruts, and need not stop to
unlearn a lot of things. Their minds are
free to go straight to the mark. This is
one explanation I have for what I saw."
At that time, there were fifteen naval
testing tanks in the whole world. One
in Washington and ours here at the
University of Michigan comprised all
of those in the United States. In Eng-
land they had six, and in Japan four, so
you can see that Japan had a goodly
share.
The Japanese had a larger horizontal
mill than in our country. Thirteen foot
forgings were available in America, a
fifteen foot one could be gotten in Eng-
land, but for a larger one, one would
have to go to Japan as they had a still
larger press there. The Japanese built
this great forging press themselves, and
the work Sperry saw was of the best.
The Japanese locomotives were the
most modern we knew how to make in
America. Here we had locomotives with
five kinds of valve gear while in Japan
they had only one,—the latest. They
had adopted the very latest in almost
every line and had nothing else. "We
hear that the Japanese come to our
country and take away many things. It
would be much more to the point to say
that they reject fifty things to one they
may select."
Mr. Sperry went on to describe the
industry and cooperation among the
workers, which he said is one of the
greatest factors in the industrial and
technical development of Japan. He
closed his article with a repetition of
his statements on the most favorable
impression made upon him by the Jap-
anese's ''entire sincerity and charming
courtesy."
The occasion of Mr. Sperry's visit
was the celebration of the twenty-fifth
anniversary of the establishment of the
Japanese Society of Mechanical Engi-
neers, and the Japanese Society of
Naval Architects. He represented the
corresponding American Institutions.

The same issue of the TECHNIC had
an editorial which holds just as well
now. if not better, than twenty-two
years ago. It is entitled "Be an Engi-
neer" and contains some very valuable
advice for the prospective engineer.
"Why is it that a man who may be
very interested in engineering in the
class room forgets all about it the mo-
ment he is out of the building? Engi-
neering is a practical profession. It can
be easily applied to many of the things
of every day life, for at every angle
there is something that should be of in-
terest to the thinking Engineer. And
why can't you be a thinking Engineer?
Are you merely going to wade around
among a lot of theories and principles
or are you going to notice the achieve-
ments around you as the direct applica-
tion of these theories and principles?
When you get out into the world you
will not be able to cash this "Text Book
Engineering" except as you can apply
it to practical cases.
You can start being an engineer right
now. Notice the things around you that
other engineers have done and ask your-
self if they have been done the way you
would have done them. Attack your
problem, whatever it may be, in an en-
gineering manner, that is: get at the
underlying principles and do not
stumble around on the surface hoping
to chance upon a solution. Try to be
an Engineer twenty-four hours of the
day and you will be much closer to your
goal when you leave here with your
"Sheepskin," than you would otherwise
have been."
Join your engineering institute, the
A.I.E.E., the A.S.C.E., I.Ae.S., A.S.M.E.
or one of the several others. Participa-
tion enables one to see and learn the
practical applications of his studies.

Gai-tired rod annealing furnace; photo courtesy of Selas Corporation of America
Research in Gas application, through the ceaseless
study and experiment of equipment manufacturers,
independent laboratories and the facilities of the
American Gas Association, is constantly producing
improvements and new departures in the application
of heat, industrially.
For example, heat treating of metal rods in batch
furnaces has certain disadvantages, particularly that of
uneven heating throughout the bundle of rods. A group
of engineers recently perfected a continuous-flow type
Gas-fired furnace with a ceramic heating unit capable of
intense, focussed heat, and closely fitted to the shape of
the work ia progress.
There are many advantages to this new Gas technique
for annealing. For instance, one inch rod stock passing
through a six foot furnace of the new type can be heated
and quenched at a rate of 12 feet per minute, no section
of the metal remaining under heat more than thirty
seconds—against 2&gt;2 hours in a batch furnace. Further-
more, better uniformity of heating is achieved; scaling,
distortion, decarburization are minimized. Floor space
of the new furnace is 24 square feet against several
hundred feet for the older type. Over-all costs are also
considerably reduced.
Local Gas Companies help make these new benefits
of Gas and Gas Equipment available to industry
through the services of skilled I ndustrial Gas Engineers,
who are available for consultation without obligation.

New Projection Television - Bob Hope's face "big as life
Can you picture Bob Hope on television
. . . seeing his face big as life—right in your
own living room?
Well, you will—for now, thanks to RCA
research, all limitations on the size of home
television screens have been removed.
RCA Projection Television sets can have
18 by 24-inch pictures, or for that matter,
pictures as large as the screen in a "movie"
theater!
When you tune in an NBC television
broadcast you'll almost think the actors are
in the same room with you—and trust NBC,
America's No. 1 network in sound broad-
casting, to bring you the best in television
entertainment.
This revolutionary improvement was
achieved in RCA Laboratories by develop-
ment of an entirely new reflector and lens,
shown in phantom above. This lens, of inex-
pensive plastic, is 8 times as efficient for the
purpose as the finest optical lens.
When you buy an RCA radio, phono-
graph or television receiver—or any other
RCA product—you receive the benefit of
the latest research development of RCA
Laboratories. It is this plus value which is
your assurance of lasting satisfaction.
The widespread public recognition of
this plus value has given to RCA world
leadership in the radio, phonograph, televi-
sion and electronic art.

hopes not merely a contention, that the
most significant aspect of the process
lies in developing an open and analyti-
cal mind. New situations are constantly
arising that demand new approaches
from the economist's point of view. To
teach of a static world that exists only
between the covers of books in some
one's imagination is to miss the point
entirely. The mind of the undergradu-
ate engineer demands description,
graphic portrayal of facts, and other
modes of presentation that arouse the
imagination and fire the intellect. The
engineer is willing to accept principles
and to deal with the facts upon which
they are based, but he is unwilling to
make his mind merely a storehouse of
discrete facts and abstractions. He is
used to dealing with things, with meas-
urable forces, and with other matters
that pertain to his immediate world.
Hence, the approach from a consid-
eration of the phenomena that lie
around him to the underlying and more
basic principles to which they are re-
lated would stimulate him as no mere
absorption of dead principle and remote
fact could possibly do. To make more
specific the meaning, an illustration
from experience may be effective. A pro-
fessor not long ago asked, apropos of
the teaching of economics on the Cam-
pus, "Well, do they teach the truth
about the gold standard?" Probably
the most fundamental truth about the
gold standard is that there is none. But.
if the professor who asked the question
had visited an economics class in which
that peculiar fact was being taught, he
probably would have been horrified. He
was a product of the old school. A bet-
ter procedure than that involved in
teaching merely the truth about the gold
standard, that is, the fundamental
theory relating to the gold standard,
would be to present the theory and then
to indicate specifically how the politi-
cal and economic notions regarding the
gold standard have been modified.
Many problems now confront us
that demand new attitudes of mind and
new types of exploration; many more
will confront us when the war is over.
Both demand specific analysis in the
light of changed conditions rather than

. . . but Mrs. J. Woofington Smith-Smythe wishes
she hadn't had to demonstrate it in just that way.
Especially since that fundamental fact is being dem-
onstrated in thousands of ways in every phase of
war and industry.
For the ball bearing carries the loads on free-
rolling steel balls—making possible the higher
speeds, heavier loads and rigidity essential to
the latest developments in war and industry.
That is why over 300 million New Departure
Ball Bearings are at work in this war. That is why
designers of new and better machinery are design-
ing more ball bearings into it than ever before.

acceptance of an esoteric set of time-
honored rules. A consideration of how
the monstrous debts of the nations are
to be paid and what procedure of re-
distribution of wealth will be involved is
a matter that should consume the inter-
est of even the most callow. Many of
the classical doctrines will bear scrutiny
in the light of the facts gathered by the
temporary National Economic Commit-
tee and the various research institutions
and agencies of the country. The old
theory was that savings always found
their way into the production of capital.
The facts prove that this was false doc-
trine. The student should be interested
in a study of what becomes of savings,
rather than in the acceptance of the dic-
tum that savings are always converted
into factors of production. Another mat-
ter that should be intriguing is that of
production in relation to buying power.
A whole new congeries of ideas has come
into existence since the Brookings In-
stitution started its researches in this
field some twenty years ago.
Then, too, the trainee should be put
on his guard against the blandishments
of certain cults that have achieved dis-
tinction in the last dozen years. The
doctrines of those who assume that the
profits of the well-to-do will have to be
taken by the Government deserves
scrutiny. The notion that along the Co-
lumbia River a dozen more dams can
be constructed to give labor to returning
soldiers and others out of employment
and that a St. Lawrence seaway can be
built with funds that would otherwise
be idle and with excess hands should
not only be viewed as idealistic ventures,
but as sound economic enterprises. The
proper presentation of these, and a large
number of like problems would with
dramatic force bring home to the engi-
neer the need for solutions to the diffi-
cult problems with which he and his
civilization will be confronted. The
purport of the above remarks is that for
the engineer a kind of case, or perhaps
a project, study would be of much more
vital interest than the old-fashioned
textbook method. Only through revi-
vifying economic doctrine by applying
it to practical engineering problems can
it become a significant factor in the edu-
cation of the coming engineer.

NO, it isn't a gun or a new-style bomb.
It's just about all we can show you
of a special glass radio bulb that is a part
of our secret military apparatus.
At one stage in the war a high-ranking
officer stated that a bulb of this type was
so valuable and effective that he would
risk the lives of five soldiers to keep it in
operation. That's something to think
about. And it's one reason why you find
Corning men and women today striving
to surpass quality standards that are al-
ready exacting.
This bulb is made of a special glass to
very strict requirements. And so are most
of the articles Corning is making for the
Army and Navy and other services. They
cover a wide range—from airplane wing-
tip lights to giant field marking beacon

ity of an absorption system as compared
to a compression system. The increased
number of operation variables, such as
compositions and rates of flow of the
two solution streams, increases the diffi-
culty of operation over that of the com-
pression system unless adequate instru-
mentation and automatic control are
provided. This feature is counterbal-
anced by the reduced number and size
of moving parts and by the ability of
the absorption system to utilize low
pressure exhaust steam which would
otherwise be wasted.
The ammonia absorption system de-
scribed may be modified in several ways.
It is usually more efficient and more
economical to eliminate the partial con-
denser by using additional contact plates
in the column and returning some liq-
uid ammonia from the main condenser
to the fractionator. Also, since the am-
monia leaving the final condenser con-
tains a slight amount of water which
accumulates in the evaporator, purging
of the liquid from the evaporator is
necessary. In the older systems this is
done periodically. During the intervals
between purging, the water content of
the liquid in the evaporator is steadily
increasing and the capacity of the unit
is steadily decreasing. During the act-
ual purging operation no refrigeration
is accomplished. Both of these factors
have led to the development of a con-
tinuous purge so that no accumulation
of water occurs in the evaporator.
Future plans for the experimental
ammonia absorption refrigeration unit
include three principal programs. The
unit will be arranged to operate con-
tinuously to supply the refrigeration
needed by the Department for the
manufacture of ice and maintenance of
brine at a low temperature. The modi-
fications and improvements mentioned
above will be investigated by students
in regular laboratory and research
courses. Also, students will study the
effect of the major operating variables
upon the operation of the entire unit
and of portions of the unit. Because
the absorption system involves a number
of unit operations, such as fluid flow,
heat transfer, and fractionation, which
must be integrated to obtain successful
operations, it serves as an excellent sum-
mary and review of the theoretical and
experimental work previously performed
bv the students.

UNION CARBIDE A&amp;AIM REPORTS
on the production of
'■■ BUfABIIMI ■
for ,the Government's Synthetic Rubber Program

-&gt; ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT factors in the
"Government's rubber program is the produc-
tion of GR-S type synthetic rubber.
The basic chemical in this rubber is Butadiene,
which can be made from alcohol or hydrocarbon materials.
The Government's original plan provided that about one third
of the required Butadiene would be made by CARBIDE AND
Carbon Chemicals Corporation's alcohol process.
In 1943, their first year of operation, however, the plants using
this process produced over 75 per cent of all Butadiene made for
GR-S type synthetic rubber.
In 1944, the second year, these plants produced about 64 per
cent of all Butadiene necessary for military and essential civilian
rubber. This was true despite the fact that good progress had
been made in the production of Butadiene by other processes.
THE RECORD
The first tank-car load of Butadiene was shipped from the Gov-
ernment's Carbide-built, Carbide-operated plant at Institute,
West Virginia a little over two years ago.
This was just five months after the famous Baruch Committee
Report pointed out this nation's desperate need for rubber—and
approved Carbide's butadiene alcoholprocess,originally selected
by Rubber Reserve Company, as one of the solutions.
In its first year the Institute plant, with a rated capacity of
80,000 tons per year, produced enough Butadiene for more than
90,000 long tons of synthetic rubber.
Two more great plants using Carbide's alcohol process—and
built from the blueprints of the Institute plant—arc in full pro-
duction. One of these, with an annual rated capacity of 80,000
tons of Butadiene is located at Kobuta, Pennsylvania and is
operated for the Government by another important chemical
company.
The second, with a rated capacity of 60,000 tons a year, is oper-
ated for the Government by Carbide at Louisville, Kentucky —
making the total rated capacity of the two huge plants now
operated by Carbide 140,000 tons a year.
In 1944, the production of Butadiene from the three plants
using the alcohol process totaled 361,000 tons — representing
operation at over 164 per cent of rated capacity. An even higher
rate is expected in 1945.
Before Pearl Harbor, the United States was a "have not" na-
tion with respect to rubber. Now, thanks to American research,
engineering and production skill, our coun-
try can take its place as a dominant factor
among the great rubber producing nations of , ,
the world.
Business men, technicians, teachers, and others are invited to send for the
hook P5 "Butadiene and Styrene for Buna S Synthetic Rubber from
Grain Alcohol,™ which explains wliat these plants do, and what their place
is in the Goternment's rubber program.

SEPTEMBER 10, 1942
"Of all the critical and strategic materials, rubber is
tbe one which presents the greatest threat to the safety
of our nation, and to the Allied Cause We find
the situation to be so dangerous that unless corrective
measures are taken immediately tbe country will fare
both a military and a civilian collapse.4*
— Report of the Rubber Survey Committee
(Baruch Commitrpe).
AUGUST 31, 1944
"Undoubtedly the outstanding achievement of your company has been the develop-
ment of your process for the production of Butadiene from alcohol. With a rather
meager background of experimental work, your engineers were able to design and
construct commercial unitsfor lite production of Butadiene. In an exceedingly short
time, the operation of this equipment at capacities up to 200 per cent of rating has been
largely responsible for our present safe situation with respect to rubber supplies..."

stress in the ring girders.
The longitudinals, which are usually
spaced at every 10 degrees around the
circumference, must be designed to re-
sist the bending moment from static and
aerodynamic loads as well as some pres-
sure from the gas cell. Most of the
bending moment is caused from the bal-
ancing of the airship by the control sur-
faces, either during maneuvers or when
hit by a gust. The shear and bending
moments due to the gravity forces are
relatively small as they are almost bal-
anced by the buoyancy forces except
when certain cells are deflated. Under
the latter conditions, the movable weight
must be redistributed so as to trim ship
and some weight must be dropped to
provide equilibrum.
RIGID AIRSHIPS
(Continued from page 32)
The shear and gas-cell wiring, which
serves to carry the buoyancy forces to
the main rings and there balance it
against the gravity forces, is not only
difficult to design but also to place dur-
ing construction. Nevertheless, it con-
stitutes an essential part of the struc-
tural framing. The wires must be placed
with considerable initial tension which
causes initial stresses in all of the other
structural members. The illustrations
show the position of the shear and cell
wiring. The wires must be designed to
resist the pressure of the gas cells and
to transmit the shearing forces along
the ship.
The design of the fixed and movable
control surfaces and of the engine
mounts involve no new features, except
for size. The size of the control sur-
Fjg. 4—USN dirigible SHENANDOAH
faces for even a small airship is difficult
to comprehend until one has stood be-
side them. The arrangement of the con-
trol surfaces as can be seen in the illus-
trations usually follows the conventional
system, although the use of bow ele-
vators has been given considerable
study.
The handling of an airship during
departures and landings must be given
careful consideration in the design.
Some of the structural members must
be designed particularly for the loads
that arise from the use of mechanical
equipment that is required for the han-
dling of large airships. Special portable
mooring masts and power tractors op-
erating on rails, together with some as-
sistance by the ground crew, must be
available at all landing fields. Special
hangars which are costly to build must
be available at the terminal stations. In
general, any transfer of passengers and
mail to or from the airship at any inter-
mediate station can undoubtedly be ac-
complished most efficiently and eco-
nomically by means of airplanes. Sev-
eral small airplanes were carried by the
U. S. Navy airships, Akron and Macon.
and no great difficulty was experienced
in attaching and pulling the airplanes
aboard. With this experience available,
there seems to be no question but that
larger commercial planes that are spe-
cially designed for the job could be
used. During the short time that the
airplane is aboard, its weight can be
partially carried by the aero-dynamic
lift of the airship. Also, some lift will
be available from the weight of fuel that
is consumed before the plane is taken
aboard.
Although the author is quite confi-
dent that the rigid airship can be con-
structed and operated in a manner that
will provide safe and comfortable trans-
portation, the possibility of its compet-
ing successfully with the large commer-
cial airplanes on even the long, trans-
oceanic routes is extremely doubtful.
The relative cost of operation of air-
ships and airplanes is difficult to com-
pare, as no data is available for the cost
of operating commercial airships. How-
ever, it may be that the advantages that
large airships possess in providing com-
fortable transportation may help to
overcome their disadvantages of to*
speed and probable higher cost of con-
struction, maintenance and operation.

greatly enlarged image and may find
great use in theaters, where news, sports
events, etc., may be observed by large
audiences at the moment of their occur-
rence. Some home sets will be of this
type.
color television
In England, Mr. John Logie Baird
has developed a tube which he calls the
Telechrome, for color stereoscopic tele-
vision. He says, "By utilizing a new-
form of scanning, every line in the pic-
ture is reproduced instantaneously and
in the color it actually occurs. The re-
volving discs and lenses which prevented
the color image from appearing directly
upon the fluorescent screen of the tube
and made colored stereo-television less
efficient and silent than black and white,
have been eliminated."
It has been felt by some that the in-
troduction of television should wait un-
til the perfection of color television in
order that the advent of color will not
obsolete black-and-white receivers. Color
television, however, is just being devel-
oped, and the television industry is re-
luctant to delay television any longer. It
points out that although movie techni-
color has been on the market for years.
it is still used far less than black-and-
white.
televised movies
The movie industry will play a big
part in television. Using movies as tele-
vision program material is now common
practice, and movies will be the standby
of the small station. Studio equipment
and procedure for television are expen-
sive and a small station will not be able
to afford to produce the high quality of
program which the public depends,
especially if it serves only a small area
and can offer only a very modest buying
power to its advertisers. No one is go-
ing to spend big money on a production
which is seen only by a hand full of peo-
ple once. Motion pictures can be cir-
culated all over the country and will
make the highest quality of entertain-
ment available to the small station.
Small stations will, however, need a
method of presenting local information.

that t/ck/ec/ Roya/ty /

Back In 1903, when you could still acquire a
reputation as a wit by yelling "get a horse," a
group of American auto mechanics really showed
their English cousins, including some repre-
sentatives of royalty, what mass production of
interchangeable parts was all about.
They stripped thro* can and threw the parts in a
pile. Then they rebuilt the cars using stock
parts, and they ran perfectly, much to the de-
light and surprise of the audience. Today thanks
the high accuracy of interchangeable parts,
the marvel of mass production is commonplace.
But few people stop to think how much mass
production with accuracy owes to modern grind-
ing methods, and modern abrasive products such
as are made by "Carborundum."
Helping Industry increase production and lower costs is
one of the most satisfying of occupations. And that
is the job of "Carborundum" Abrasive Engineers.

ing for your life work, please write The

events, and advertising. They can do
this also by photography. Movie cam-
eras are much cheaper and convenient
than television cameras and can be used
to advantage both out doors and in-
doors. Of course, there is a time delay
when film is used, and this may make
television seem less spectacular to some,
but modern methods of processing make
possible the broadcast of a film in less
than an hour after it is exposed.
networks
The use of networks is another way
by which programs will be presented to
a large audience. Because of the wide
range of frequencies present in a tele-
vision signal, it cannot be fed over tele-
phone wires. Two methods that are
being used successfully to connect sta-
tions are coaxial cable and radio relay
stations. Television radio waves will not
curve around the earth's surface, because
of their high frequency, but travel in
almost straight lines. If television is to
be transmitted long distances by radio
it must be relayed every 20 to 60 miles
depending upon the height of the relay-
ing antennas and the intervening ter-
rain.
General Electric proposes a post-war
network of television stations employ-
ing unattended radio relay equipment
mounted in plastic domes on top of
towers to be spaced within line-of-sight
distance of one another across the coun-
try. They would employ large para-
bolic reflectors that concentrate the
radio energy into very narrow beams,
and possibly be serviced by mainten-
ance engineers flying from one relay
station to another in helicopters.
Television networks will probably
originate in three parts of the country:
the East, Central, and West, and will
first connect large cities, later stemming
to smaller cities. Eventually, the three
sections of the country will be inter-
connected to form a national network.
satellite stations
Satellite stations, having no studios
of their own may become numerous in
small cities. Built for a fraction of the
cost of other stations, they will be pro-
grammed from a network. The equip-
ment of a satellite station would con-
sist of a small building and a tower with
two antennas mounted on top. One would
be a parabolic reflector which would
pick up the picture and sound signals
from the nearest television relay point:
the other would be the broadcast anten-
na. In the building would be a low
power transmitter, a receiver, and
equipment for televising motion pic-
tures; the motion pictures to be used
for handling local events.
But television will do more than en-
tertain; it will help save life and prop-
erty. In aeronautics television may be
used to transmit to airplanes a picture
of the positions and movement of all
aircraft within several miles of an air-
port. In police work it would be invalu-
able for indentification purposes.
Television, the dream of man for cen-
turies, has been perfected and now
awaits the end of the war to begin its
unpredictable peace-time growth.

One of the most outstanding features
of this war has been the development
and application of weapons and ma-
chines which incorporate the working
principles of the common Fourth-of-
July rocket. The successful perform-
ance of an Allied anti-tank weapon, the

cow's anti-aircraft rocket defenses have
established rockets as major weapons of
warfare. Any doubts we may have en-

of momentum caused by the body. This
means that the forward thrust of an
aircraft is proportional to the product
of the mass of material ejected from the
vehicle in a given time and the amount
its velocity has been increased with re-
spect to the vehicle. A propeller ejects
rearward a large amount of material at
low velocity, while a rocket ejects a
smaller amount of material in the same
interval of time but at higher velocity.
Successful jet-propulsion engines are
classified in two basic types of engines.
The first group consists of self-con-
tained rocket motors, which carry both

were removed by the results of the robot
bombing attacks upon London.
Military secrecy surrounds the pro-
duction of rockets and jet-propulsion de-
vices, but occasionally some hint of
their magnitude is revealed. By mid-
summer of 1944, the U. S. Navy was
spending $100,000,000. per month on
rockets, and the other military services
were demanding equally large quanti-
ties. Besides being applied in Germany's
V-l and V-2 robot bombs, jet-propul-
sion has been utilized in rocket-assisted
take-offs for airplanes, jet-propelled
planes, jet-assisted gliders, our own
robot bombs, and other weapons of war.
These devices have sound engineer-
ing principles as their bases, for they
are heat engines, however radical in de-
sign. These jet-propulsion engines, to-
gether with the conventional propeller-
driven plane, have a common principle
which explains their performance. The
principle is Newton's third law of mo-
tion—that for every action there is an
equal and opposite reaction. This fun-
damental law, more formally expressed,
states that the net force on a body is
proportional to the time rate of change
necessary for flight. The second group
consists of air-stream engines, which
take their oxygen from the atmosphere.
The five important air-stream engines
are the intermittent-firing duct engine,
the continuous-firing duct engine, the
gas-turbine engine, the combination gas-
turbine propeller-driven engine, and the
reciprocating, propeller-driven engine.
The fundamental difference between the
two groups is the source of the oxygen.
Rockets are independent of the atmos-
phere; air-stream engines are not. All
but the fourth and fifth air-stream en-
gines are jet-propulsion engines. How-
ever, they, too, are a function of New-
ton's third law.
Theoretically, the ejected mass may
be a solid, liquid, or a gas, for only the
rate of ejection and the increase of its
velocity affect the forward thrust. How-
ever, the only practical substances are
gases, the products of combustion. By
the nature of their production, they can
be ejected at high velocity. Briefly, all
propulsion devices consist of a heat en-
gine which converts the fuel energy into
mechanical energy, together with a de-

Liquid-fuel rockets can utilize many
fuels, from kerosene to gasoline, alcohol,
or liquid hydrogen. The oxidizer is us-
ually liquid oxygen. Combustion with
liquid fuels is more easily controlled
than with solid fuels, provides higher-
velocity jets, and is more efficient per
unit weight of fuel. The liquid-fuel mo-
tor has potential advantages. It can op-
erate at greatest efficiency in a vacuum,
and is at present the most logical de-
vice for the often-discussed trip to the
moon.
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued from page 40)
Since all present rocket devices are de-
signed to function within the atmos-
phere, greater efficiency could be ob-
tained if a jet-propuusion motor could
be built which would derive its supply
of oxygen from the surrounding atmos-
phere. Accordingly, engineers have de-
veloped air-stream jet-propulsion en-
gines which pump air into the combus-
tion chambers. The two basic types of
air-stream engines, the jet-propulsion
unit and the gas-turbine, differ in the
method employed to pump air to the
combustor.
The intermittent-firing duct engine
was built in practical form by the Ger-
mans, and it is known as the V-l
rocket bomb. This engine is launched,

The combination power unit consisting of a gas turbine driven propeller and some
jet effect offers attractive possibilities for some aircraft applications. The pro
pcllor is more effective at the lower speeds while the jet is more effective at higher
speeds.
Any propulsion engine must lift
against gravity and must drive against
air resistance. A rocket motor in opera-
tion must lift itself, the payload (ex-
plosives or other cargo), and the un-
burned fuel and oxygen. At the start
of a flight the fuel and oxygen comprise
most of the weight to be lifted. The
oxygen required always weighs several
times as much as the fuel. Conse-
quently, until it is consumed, oxygen
can be considered only as dead weight.
to start the motor. Air presses against
the front of the machine, passes through
a grill and into the combustion chamber
where fuel has been pumped. The mix-
ture is ignited by an electric spark, and
the pressure of combustion forces the
front grill shutters closed. The gases
of combustion are ejected through a noz-
zle at the rear of the machine, a par-
tial vacuum is created within the ma-
chine, and the combustion cycle is re-
peated, 40 times per minute. These
"buzz" bombs travel at 200-400 mph.
but their efficiency is very low.
The continuous-firing duct engine
looks like a slightly elongated barre
with both ends knocked out. Gasoline is
fed into a central tube, so that the in
coming air stream mixes with the fuel
and passes into the combustion chamber.
The force of the ejected air jet creates
a suction which continually draws more
air into the engine, so that it can main-
tain a speed above 500 mph.
These duct engines are ingenious
and amazingly simple machines. They
have succeeded, without requiring ro-
tating parts, in gulping large volumes of
air for combustion. However, increas-
ing the combustion pressure would
raise the heat-engine efficiency. Ac-
'cordingly, some of the power of the rear
air jet has been diverted to drive a com-
pressor at the inlet end of the motor.
Consequently, an open cycle gas-turbine
has, at little expense of weight, been
combined with a simple jet-reaction en-
gine to enable an airplane to fly at
speeds of 400-700 mph.
All these thrust-reaction engines
must be compared on a basis of thrust,
not horsepower. The translation of
thrust to horsepower requires the inclu-
sion of distance and time factors—one
pound thrust at 375 mph. is equivalent
to one horse-power.
The magnitude of the thrust de-
pends on the rate at which mass is
ejected and the increase in velocity
given to it. With rocket motors, this
velocity increase is the jet velocity; with
air-stream engines, it is the difference
between the jet velocity and the velocity
of the incoming air. Rockets, which
carry a limited quantity of fuel, must
produce high jet velocities. Air-stream
engines can carry more fuel and conse-
quently can handle a larger mass of
ejected gas at a lower velocity.
The results of the development of
jet propulsion are that the limits of
flight have been extended greatly, in ad-
dition to providing competition for ex-
isting fields of transportation. The po-
tential military value of this new type
of engine is already apparent during thi^
war. Peacetime applications include
high-speed commercial aircraft, meteor-
ological rockets, and robot rocket mail
and express. We can only conjecture
further possibilities for jet-propulsion.

sterilamp
The Sterilamp, a germicidal lamp
which is used to destroy airborne bac-
teria and to promote health and clean-
liness, has recently been developed and
has already been commercially adapted
in many ways. A bakery, for example,
must be operated at about 90 degrees
Fahrenheit, and the moisture content of
the atmosphere inside the bakery is so
high that mold can very easily grow in
bread dough which has been allowed to
lie in containers until needed. By in-
stalling Sterilamps, which emit ultra-
violet rays, mold growth is stopped, and
bacteria in the air are killed, so that
the bread dough can be kept clean and
safe from dirt and bacteria.
Similarly, meat-packing concerns and
slaughter houses can economically in-
corporate the benefits of Sterilamps in
preparing and processing meats. The
lamps, which are constructed in long,
slender tubes not unlike fluorescent
lamps, can be installed at normal room-
height, between the rows of meat. The
ultra-violet rays keep the atmosphere
inside the packinghouse clean, and pre-
vent the growth of mold upon the meat.
Thus, sanitary requirements are more
easily met, and the public is assured
of a fresh, clean supply of meat.

Courtesy Wrsti&gt;i»lions&lt;
Sterilamps are used in this meat locker.
Another novel application of Steri-
lamps has been demonstrated in veter-
inary hospitals, where ailing animals
are observed to recover from their sick-
nesses in shorter periods of time than
is generally the case. Sterilamps
hung from the ceilings prevent bacteria
from being spread by sneezing animals,
and the atmosphere is cleansed of germs.
Sterilamps can be employed benefi-
cially in hospitals, where purified air
and the prevention of the spread of
disease bacilli could easily save many
lives and shorten many illnesses. Per-
haps an economical Sterilamp unit
could be built for home use. Although
people must protect their eyes from
ultra-violet rays by wearing dark glass-
es, this germicidal lamp will find appli-
cation in many more industries and
businesses.

Years of mathematical calculations
in the solution of complex mechanical
problems have been eliminated through
the use of an electrical calculator re-

gineers. Klectrical currents flowing
through a maze of wires and coils inside
the machine perform all the calcula-
tions and the final results are displayed
by an electronic beam upon a fluores-
cent screen.

solve problems involving mechanical
shock or vibration. Recently a com-

Lhe reasons why internal combus-
tion engines run may be elementary
to you.
But somewhere in your career you'll
probably want to help men around
you to understand them better.
Here's a booklet that's a short cut for
you — saving your time, compressing
much information into simple forms,
and making complicated machines
understandable.
It's a result of one of our wartime
problems — the problem of training
inexperienced men to help service
automobile, aircraft and Diesel
engines.
We found that if they knew exactly
what they were doing and why, their
interest rose. Their skills increased,
and they became more valuable to us
and to the war effort.
This 115-page booklet is a collection
of the elementary facts about the
three types of internal combustion
engines in general use today. It is
readable and accurate. If you would

to know what happened inside a crate
of tubes, packed for shipment, when the
crate was suddenly dropped to the
ground. A problem like this would or-
dinarily take an engineer 800 days to
solve, working twelve hours per day.
However, this amazing electrical device
provided the complete solution in ten
days.
Its technical name is a mechanical-
transients analyzer, and it does its cal-
culations by figuring with electric cir-
cuits which have duplicated the various
mechanical conditions included in a
problem. For instance, the weight of a
falling body, the velocity and impact
with which it strikes the ground, and
the cushioning effect inside the body
are all transmitted into electrical cir-
cuits. These circuits can be connected
in any desired sequence and their com-
bined effect, when passed through the
fluorescent screen, is easily viewed as an
electrical shock wave which accurately
interprets the results of the mechanical
vibrations being considered.

for every application where a bearing is needed
. . . whether for the vital rotating parts of a
powerful modern locomotive or the comparatively
simple requirements of a motorcycle . . . there
is one type and size of bearing that will do the job
right. Anything else is a substitution—not quite
so efficient.
That's why SBCStP makes a complete line of both
hall and roller bearings. True, in wartime, you
have not always been able to obtain the SCSIF bear-
ings you needed. That was because our armed
forces have demanded so much of our produc-
tion that even a six-times increase in capacity
couldn't meet all the heavy military and civilian
requirements.
Some day — fairly soon, we hope — 25CSSF and its
distributors will again be able to offer you prompt
service on a complete line. SCSfF1 makes practically
all types of anti-friction bearings. Therefore, when
SCSfF recommends a particular type of bearing,
you may be sure that its recommendations are un-
biased— the right bearing in the right place.

made if these stresses and vibrations
were to be measured with mechanical

easily saves manufacturers much time

copper man
Scientists have built a copper robot,
equipped with temperature controls,
which duplicates the reactions of human
beings to varying degrees of tempera-
ture. Modelled in clay and cast in wax.
the statue was coated with a varnish
and electroplated with copper. 1/16
inch thick.
The purpose of this robot is to test
flying clothes in high-altitude, low-tem-
perature chambers. At first, human
guinea pigs had been employed in these
research projects, but it was discovered
that the results obtained in reactions to
low temperatures were very unreliable,
since each human will react differently
on successive days. It was necessary,
therefore, to develop something which

The copper robot.
would represent an average person, and
which could be adjusted to the thermal
reactions of different types of people.
The copper robot designed for this pur-
pose has been found to be 100% reliable
in its reactions.
The robot has been constructed to
represent the circulatory system of a
human. The fifteen different areas of
his body are each subject to tempera-
ture control, varying from ten to twenty
degrees on each side of the normal tem-
perature. Thus, engineers can test the
reactions of a man with cold feet, or
other peculiarity. All these tests are
possible because the robot has been
strung internally with resistance wire,
so that the body heat of a human is
exactly duplicated. By dressing the
robot in the flying suit to be tested,
placing him in the cold chamber, and
measuring the heat loss at various parts
of the robofs body, engineers are able
to design electrically-heated flying suits
which sucessfully counteract heat loss
and which result in a great saving in
weight and greater freedom of action
for fliers.

blackest substance known to man —
carbon.
From a booth at the rear of your
movie theatre, the intense snow-white
light of a carbon arc projects the tiny
pictures from the film, enlarged as much
as 300,000 times iti area, onto the screen.
Onlv the carbon arc witb its concen-
trated brightness can do this difficult job.
Tbe carbon arc —a subject of years of
ri-carcll by NATIONAL CARBON COM-
PANY, Inc., a Unit of UCC—also serves
in many ways other than on tbe motion
picture set and in movie projectors.
Military searchlights, as well as lights
for photoengraving, employ the carbon
arc. It is also used to increase tbe Vita-
min D content of milk and other prod-
ucts. It has opened up new scientific
methods in the analysis of metals. It
brings the beneficial effects of ultra-
violet rays to man. Even in agriculture,
uses are being found for the carbon arc
in tbe study of plant growth.
For further information on the carbon arc...

one-half square inch in area.
Through intensive and continuing re
search, National Carbon lias made the

fighter plane compasses
Mounted in the wing-tip, but read
in the cockpit of a pursuit plane, a new
remote-indicating compass has been de-
veloped which has solved the problem
of deflection which occurs when a com-
pass is placed near anything made of
iron or steel. Since more and heavier
armor is being placed on fighter planes,
the problem of placing the aircraft's
compass where the pilot could read the
compass, but where it would not be de-
flected, had almost seemed to be beyond
practical solution.
However, the solution was found by
employing Alnico permanent magnets in
the compass unit. And, when these mag-
nets lined themselves with the earth's
magnetic field, they affected the electri-
cal voltages in a wire coil, so that cor-
responding coils in the cockpit would
move a pointer on a dial in the same
direction as the compass. An added ad-
vantage of this new type of direction
indicator is that several dials, for other
members of the crew, can be read from
the same compass.
ignitron tube
The Ignitron mercury-arc rectifier, a
|3,000,000 electronic tube, was per-
fected just in time to fill the urgent de-
mands for converting alternating cur-
rent to direct current in the rapidly
expanding aluminum and magnesium in-
dustries at the start of the war. If
the development of this tube had not
yet reached the commercial stage, the
amazing production records of the elec-
tro-chemical industries could not have
been attained.
Other types of rectifiers could have
been manufactured, but they were not
as efficient as the Ignitron rectifier,
and the steel and alloy metals needed to
build them were not available in suffi-
cient quantity.
The Ignitron consists of an evacuated
tube containing a mercury pool into
which is dipped an igniter, usually boron
carbide, and having opposite it the
other main electrode, or anode. The
mercury and its igniter make up the
cathode of the device. Since the cath-
ode can only emit electrons, the reverse
cycle of alternating current does not
pass, and a direct current is the result.
Discovered in 1932, the principle of
the Ignitron has required years of ex-
pensive development, to be adapted for
practical use. The first installation was
made in 1939 for aluminum production,
and today more than 3,000.000 kilo-
watts of Ignitrons are in service in the
electrochemical industries.
The Ignitron possesses the ability to
handle tremendous voltages, and has
potential use in transmitting direct cur-
rent over long distances. Development
in this direction would make possible
the electrification of more railroads.

AND THE HUMANITIES
In his interesting article in the Feb-
ruary issue of the Michigan Technic,
Dean Crawford—among other things-
sketched in brief the changes in en-
gineering education recommended by a
special committee appointed by the
Society for the Promotion of Engineer-
ing Education. The recommendations
are of great significance, especially as
they relate to the humanities, since they
clearly affirm the need for more em-
phasis on the nontechnical in the prep-
aration of engineers for their profes-
sion. If they are carried out. no longer
will the so-called "cultural electives"
be "filler," somewhat casually tucked
into the engineer's education, but an
integral part of such education.
The recommendations, no doubt, af-
ford much room for difference of opin-
ion. It is safe to assume that not a few
of the technical professors in the engi-
neering colleges see little need for their
adoption: and it is equally safe to as-
sume that teachers in the humanities
are generally in favor of them. As one
of the latter group I should like to dis-
cuss briefly why the proposed exten-
sion of the humanities in the curricu-
lum seems desirable. Before proceeding
to do so. however, it might be well to
summarize the proposals and provisions
most relevant to the discussion. For
this purpose I shall draw upon the "Re-
port of the Committee on Engineering
Education After the War," printed in
the May. 1944. issue of the Journal oj
Engineering Education.
I.
The Committee, first of all, provides
for two basic areas of study: the scien-
tific-technological, to be alloted about
SO per cent of the student's time; and
the humanistic-social, to be allotted
about 20 per cent of the student's time.
Both areas of study are to be recognized
as essential and co-ordinate aspects of
the engineer's education.
In its discussion of the means by
which to achieve the purposes of the
curriculum, the Committee recommends
by
CARL E. BURKLUND
Professor of English

Carl E. Burklund.
"a designed sequence of courses extend-
ing throughout the four undergraduate
years"—roughly equivalent to one
three-hour course running through the
four-year curriculum.
The objectives of the humanistic-
social division of study the Committee
lists as follows (I give them in their
entirety):
1. Understanding of the evolution of
the social organization within which
we live and of the influence of
science and engineering on its de-
velopment.
2. Ability to recognize and to make
a critical analysis of a problem in-
volving social and economic ele-
ments, to arrive at an intelligent
opinion about it, and to read with
discrimination and purpose toward
those ends.
3. Ability to organize thoughts logic-
ally and to express them lucidly and
convincingly in oral and written
English.
4. Acquaintance with some of the
great masterpieces of literature and
an understanding of their setting
in and influence on civilization.
5. Development of moral, ethical, and
social concepts essential to a sat-
isfying personal philosophy, to a
career consistent with the public
welfare, and to a sound professional
attitude.
6. Attainment of an interest and
pleasure in these pursuits and thus
of an inspiration to continued
study.
The methods recommended by the
Committee for organizing the materials
in the humanistic-social area of study
are too long to be quoted here. The
Committee recognizes the difficulties
likely to be encountered and suggests
the need for a close co-ordination of
content, for a careful checking of re-
sults, for exceptionally skillful teaching,
for a shifting of major stress on non-
technical subjects to the later years of
the curriculum, and for a capitalizing on
the natural interest of engineering stu-
dents in current rather than in older
literature and history. Especially sig-
nificant are certain of its recommenda-
tions: that engineering students should
be encouraged to participate in such
expressional activities as music, dra-
matics, and public speaking; that they
should be urged to join student organ-
izations concerned with public and
social problems; and that "organized"
opportunities should be provided them

The foregoing present the principal
proposals and recommendations of the
Committee in so far as they affect our
discussion. There is also much excellent
commentary, which only limitations of
space forbid noting here. The program,
as we see, calls for the definite assign-
ment of a fifth or more of the student's
time to a systematized study of the
humanities and the social sciences. To
me it seems an admirable' program—■
admirable for several reasons.

Since the production and use of nylon
promise to be immense after the war.
ft is felt by the author that it would
be highly enlightening and interesting
for the reader to know something about
the product and its possibilities. Not
much has been written about nylon up
to the present time. This is due mainly
to the fact that nylon is a relatively
recent discovery, having been intro-
duced to the public only five years ago
by the Dupont Company. It is also due
to the fact that for the past few years
all nylon products have been utilized
by the armed forces for war purposes;
thus, little information is available con-
cerning its more recent applications and
improved characteristics. However,
enough material is available to give a
fairly good idea of its properties and
use, and that is the purpose of this
article.
Before a further discussion takes
place, it is best to define the term
"nylon." Nylon is the generic name
chosen by the Dupont Company for a
group of materials classed as synthetic
linear superpolymers. It has also been
defined as a "Man made protein-like
chemical product (polyamide) which
may be formed into fibers, bristles,
sheets, and other forms, characterized
when drawn by extreme toughness, elas-
ticity, and strength."
The term nylon does not refer to a
single material alone, but to a vast
group of chemically related materials,
whose physical properties differ con-
siderably. It is an entirely new class
of materials which has the combined
charactertistics of metals, plastics, and
rubber. Their characteristics may be
greatly modified to yield varying de-
grees of toughness, hardness, thermo-
plasticity, flexibility, solubility and
color.
Nylon contains atoms of carbon, ni-
trogen, hydrogen and oxygen. All of
these elements are derived or extracted
from coal (carbon), air (nitrogen), and
water (hydrogen and oxygen).
It was found that molecules of an
amino compound polymerize together
by condensation to form a product
called polyamide. If polyamides are
induced to polymerize further, the ulti-
mate material formed is superpolyamide
or nylon. The condensation product
has a linkage within the molecule which
resembles the protein linkage in the
natural fibers of the animal class such
as wool and silk. The resemblance is
not accidental, but part of the design
of the artificial fibers. The linkage is
attained bv condensation of an amino

group with a carboxyl group with the
elimination of water. This reaction is
shown below.
X-NH., + HOOC-Y-*X-NH-OC-Y
+ H,O
The first stage in the process, thus,
is to yield a polyamide from the union
of two molecules to form a linked mole-
cule. There are two possible ways for
this to take place.
1. Linkage of two similar molecules:
NH, (CH.,),, COOH +
H.,N (CH.,),, COOH-&gt;
NH., (CH.,),, CO-N-H (CH.,),,-COOH
+ H,0
2. Linkage of two dissimilar mole-
cules:
NH., (CH.,),, COOH +
H..N (CH.,),n COOH-*
NH., (CH.,),, CONH (CH.,),,,-COOH
+ H,O
Since an amino and a carboxyl group
are still present as terminal groups of
the polyamide molecule, a further con-
densation involving these groups is pos-
sible. If the first case is used as an
example:
2NH., (CH.,)n CONH (CH.,),, COOH-.
H..N (CH",),, CONH (CH.,),, CONH
"(CH,)n"cONH (CH,),, COOH
The molecule can, thus, continue to in-
crease rapidly in size until, by this
process of chain polymeric condensation,
molecules having a molecular weight of
from 7000 to 21000 can easily be built
up. Such molecular systems, termed
superpolyamides, form the basic nylon
polymers. The degree of polymeriza-
tion in the production of nylon is regu-
lated by the duration of heating, the
extent to which the polyamide is super-
polymerized being determined by meas-
urements of viscosity to electrical con-
ductivity.
It is essential in the foregoing reac-
tions that the molecules remain linear if
continued polymeric condensation is to
take place. The reaction must be so
arranged that the terminal groups can-
not condense from each end of the
molecule to form a cyclic or ring struc-
ture. If this occurs, all condensation
will stop and the superpolyamide wtll
not be formed.
It is also possible to form polyamides
by the polymeric condensation of dia-
mines with dicarboxylic acids. Thus:
NH., (CH.,),, NH., +
HOOC (CH~),,, COOH-*
H.,N (CH.,),, NHCO (CH..)m COOH
+ H,O
These compounds will also form long
chain polymers of the superpolyamidf
type if cyclisation is avoided. This cy-
clisation may be avoided by making the
radical length of the polymer (m + n)
not less than eight and preferably nine.
During condensation, water is split
off and this must be removed from the
reaction or otherwise back reactions
will take place and lessen the chances
of superpolymerization proceeding satis-
factorily. The reaction is usually con-
ducted by heating the dicarboxylic acid
and diamine in a suitable solvent so
that the water will be boiled off as soon

nitrogen is usually provided in order to
prevent oxidization and decomposition
of the polymer.
The actual reactants chosen for in-
dustrial nylon were adipic acid and
hexamethylene diamine. and the poly-
mer obtained was known as polymer
"66" in the Dupont laboratories. The
first "6" indicates the number of carbon
atoms in the diamine and the second
"6" the number of carbon atoms in the
dibasic acid. Both of these reactants
were more or less chemical curiosities,
but technical production of them was
worked out from one raw material, viz.,
benzene. Adipic acid, which is known
chemically as tetra-methylene dicar-
boxylic acid, is obtained by the oxidiza-
tion of cyclohexanol, which in turn is
obtained from benzene by the hydro-
genation of phenol.
Hexamethylene diamine is also ob-
tained from adipic acid. The acid is
converted into the corresponding amide,
adipamide, (via the acid chloride) and
the amide hydrated to the correspond-
ing nitrile, adiponitrile. The nitrile upon
reduction yields hexamethylene diamine.

Complexity of structure alone is not
sufficient to give the required properties
for a synthetic textile fiber. It is also
essential that the molecules be arranged
or oriented in a definite manner. The
molecules must not only be in a chain
arrangement, as previously explained,
but they must also be adequately
oriented. If this orientation is not
achieved and the molecules are agglom-
erated or randomly arranged, inade-
quate tensile strength and elasticity
will result as well as poor lustre and
transparency. It has been found that
the superpolyamides could be converted
to the oriented form by coldworking a
spun fiber. The molecules, under the
influence of the coldworking, arrange
themselves into the required form. This
aspect of the research was carried out
by X-ray photographs in which it was
noted that nylon fibers closely resem-
ble natural silk fibers. The final poly-
mer is hard, opaque, very tough and
has a molecular weight of from 10,000
to 25.000 and a melting point of about
246°C.
In commercial preparation, the adipic
acid and hexamethylene diamine are
made by high pressure synthesis from
coke-oven gases and coal tar intermedi-
ates. Solutions of the above two com-
ponents then react in stainless steel
kettles to form the nylon salt, hexa-
methylene diammonium adipate. These
stainless steel vessels are provided with
a means of returning any solvent lost
by distillation to the reaction product.
The solvents employed are generally
while nitrogen is passed through the
mixture continuously. When the mole-
cular complexity of the superpolyamide
is sufficiently high, as determined by its
intrinsic viscosity (above .6), the re-
action product is poured slowly, with
continuous stirring, into a large vol-
ume of alcohol. The superpolyamide is
insoluble in this reagent and is precipi-
tated as a white granular mass. This is
filtered off, washed with alcohol, and
then dried.
The salt thus formed is then put in
water solution to facilitate handling. It
is run into tank cars, shipped to nylon
spinning plants, and from there piped

formic or carbolic acids. An inlet tube
is also provided so that dry nitrogen
gas can be passed through the mixture
to avoid oxidations and the subsequent
decomposition of the superpolyamide.
Water formed during the reaction is re-
moved by distillation. The vessels are
jacketed and usually heated by means
of the vapors of boiling napthalene at
a constant temperature of 218°C.
A mixture of 264 quarts of hexa-
methylene diamine, 322 parts of adipic
acid, and 600 parts xylenol (a mixture
of the three isomeric xylenols) is
heated for thirteen hours at 218°C,
to evaporators to be concentrated to
approximate saturation. The desired
mixture is next put into a cylindrical
autoclave and heated by Dowtherm,
circulating through a jacket and coils,
to a temperature of about 280°C. Poly-
merization causes an extremely long
molecular chain or polyamide to form.
The correct length is obtained by care-
ful control of temperature, of the dura-
tion of the process, and by the intro-
duction, at the proper moment, of a
chemical inhibitor that prevents further
linkage.

MICHIGAN WATER POWER
by
ALFRED H. LOVELL
Professor of Electrical Engineering
Our first thought about Michigan's
water power today is to wish that we
had much more of it developed and
working. The tremendous demands of
industry for power under the impetus
of war-time contracts and the severe
restrictions on the use of coal, oil and
gas for fuel, have made it necessary on
a national basis to use our water power
resources to the utmost in order to meet
the emergency.
Although Michigan has been very
generously treated by Nature in the
allotment of water power, some other
states far surpass us in this respect be-
cause they have huge mountain ranges
to provide the necessary reservoirs and
slopes and great, high areas to provide
large flows. In the order of their de-
veloped water power the states would
rank as follows: first. California; sec-
ond, Washington; and third. New York;
with Michigan in twelfth place. But
our highly developed industries call for
vast amounts of energy so that in 1944
when the electric utilities carried the
largest loads they have ever had, our
water power had to be supplemented by
an unusual amount of fuel power.
Hence our installed capacity of 369.000
kw. of water power was augmented by
almost 2,000,000 kw. of steam power
and 47.000 kw. of internal combustion

engine power, or the hydro was only
IS percent of the total. The same ratio
holds approximately for the energy gen-
erated by the Consumers Power Com-
pany last year, the fuel power produced
was 21/. billion kw-hr. while the water
power generated was % billion kw-hr.

Geological Survey, United States De-

partment of the Interior, "stream flow
in the lower peninsula continued sub-
normal" but "in the upper peninsula
runoffs apeared about normal and un-
usual amounts of snow on the ground
assured a normal volume of spring run-
off." Thus for the lower peninsula it
promised rather a dry year unless we
got unusually heavy spring rains. Very
fortunately the weatherman cooperated
with enthusiasm by giving us a rainfall
of 7.85 inches in Ann Arbor in May.
which was more than twice our normal
quota of 3.40 inches. The hydro-elec-
tric engineer is like the ardent Victory-
gardener—he would like to have a good
rain every night.
It will be appreciated that for a good
hydro-electric development we need a
high head and a large steady flow of
water in the stream. But in Michigan's
topography high heads are not avail-
able, the total fall on our southern
rivers being often not much over 300
feet from the head waters to the outlet
lake levels. Hence many of the heads
obtainable for any one plant site are
26 feet or less, while a few plants on
the Muskegon River have higher values.
such as Rogers' Dam 40 feet; Croton
Dam 40.5 feet; and one notable head
of 100 feet at the Hardy Dam. In the
Upper Pensinsula, although some of the
mountain peaks may reach an elevation
of 2000 feet, whereas the lake levels
are about 581 feet along the shores of
Lake Michigan and 602 feet along the
shores of Lake Superior, these rockv
knobs are only 8 percent of the surface
area of the Upper Peninsula and no
very high head plants are recorded.
The second factor, or stream flow.
will depend mainly upon the surface
runoff and the groundwater. The first
will come from the precipitation and
therefore be related to the total quan-
tity for the year and its uniformitv. As
all enthusiastic gardeners know, our
normal annual rainfall of the spring
months may be shed rapidly from the

eminent, outstanding, and highly reput-
able organizations has felt the pinch of
a very severe manpower shortage. Our
records show that in the fall term ten
of our gallant staff were unceremoni-
ously whisked off to the armed services.
in the spring term we lost so many
stalwarts that we have been unable to
compute the gloomy figure, our slide
rule not being handy. Nevertheless, the
grand tradition of the Technic has been
continued—we have yet to miss an is-
sue. (It's not that we are patting our-
selves on the back, although we do feel
a distinct soreness in the right elbow).
Consequently, we are dedicating this
page to an appeal to all engineering
students to rally round the Technic.
For the benefit of those who may desire
to join the staff we shall describe the
entertaining, interesting and often vio-
lent aspects of life as it is led within the
walls of Ye Olde Technic Office.
Our standard greeting for subscribers
appearing at the office consists of a
twenty-three gun salute accompanied by
three floor deep salaams. (We are go-
ing to dispense cartons of cigarettes as
soon as our arrangements with the black
market are completed). On the other
hand an individual once burst into the
office bearing a copy of the Technic
screaming. "I can't stand it, I can't
stand it!" Would anyone care to claim
his body?
A personality with whom every staff
member soon becomes acquainted is a
nebulous character called Ambrose
McHigan who represents everything
collegiate in the magazine. This indi-
vidual is responsible for our joke page
where his portrait appears. The reason
for Ambrose's existence becomes clear
CTS
whenever things go haywired and snaf-
fued at this office. Who was it that
slipped the objectionable jokes into the
joke page? What was it that left the
beer bottles in the office window? Who
was it that purchased a station wagon
with the money that should have paid
off one months' printing bill? Brother,
you guessed it, it was our boy Ambrose.
Now. it has been rumored about that
Technic men become so engrossed in
their work on the magazine that they
allow their scholastic work to surfer.
Nothing could be farther from the
truth. Naturally we give our responsi-
bilities to the magazine highest priority
but we place great emphasis on extra
curricular activities like carrying 17
hours of classes. The reason is obvious,
certain unsympathetic individuals exist
who insist on requiring us to present
eligibility cards before participating in
this activity. In view of this fact the
Technic operates one of the finest tutor-
ing organizations on the campus, open
to all staff members. Our motto is:
"Knocked out? Flunking out? Try-
out for the Michigan Technic."
Another feature of greatest import-
ance is the East Engineering smoking
and bull session room. When staff
members find themselves harried and
worn by the ordeal of a gruelling grind
of morning recitations they seek refuge
in the congenial and relaxing atmos-
phere of Ye Olde Technic Office. For-
get your cares at club 3036.
Above and beyond these side issues
the staff is chiefly concerned with put-
ting out our pride and joy, the Technic.
One of the most troublesome aspects of
the publication schedule is the Ambrose
McHigan Flexible Deadline. In all ef-
ficiently run publications a deadline
means just as it sounds. All copy not
turned in before the deadline cannot
be printed. However, as most copy is
turned in after the prescribed date it is
obvious that a flexible deadline is the
thing to have. Unfortunately the
A.M.F.D. often shows signs of converg-
ing on the deadline for the next month.
When this occurs the editor breaks out
his trusty six shooter and proceeds to
reduce the size of the staff. We don't
mean to say that the Technic is an in-
efficiently run magazine, we're just dif-
ferent, that's all. Besides, we realize
that college students often have other
things that require their attention, blue-
books for example. Consequently they
are put out of their misery in the most
humane manner possible.
Now, fellow engineers, (that includes
our brothers in bell bottomed trousers
and members of the fairer sex too)
analyze yourselves. Do you enjoy the
prospect of participating in an activity
which guarantees exciting, educational,
and often violent experiences? Would
you like to make the acquaintance of
Ambrose McMigan? Do you find En-

gineering English revolting? If the an-
swer is yes, drop into the office at 3036
East Engineering building. If the an-
swer is no, you will still be welcome.
Service men who will not be drafted
are especially welcome. If you are a
civilian we prefer men who are defin-
itely draft proof since selective service
seems to be especially interested in
Technic men. To sum it up. our plight
is desperate, act now. this means you.

statue of liberty is
re-illuminated
Since Germany has surrendered, the
many improvements which have been
built into the lighting system of the
Statue of Liberty have been utilized to
bathe the symbol of Freedom in greater
and more realistic brilliance than before
the war. Westinghouse engineers solved
many unusual floodlighting conditions
in order that the torch of Liberty may-
glow in a realistic manner, as if it were
an actual flame. The lighted statue will
be for many returning soldiers their
first glimpse of home in several years.

watt floodlights are directed upward,
toward the body of the statue. In the
eleventh point, directly underneath the
face of the statue, sixteen 1,000 watt
floodlamps bathe the face of Liberty in
almost-daylight brilliance. Upon the
statue's copper base are mounted six-
teen 200-watt lamps which are also
directed upward upon the statue. All
these lights have been reserviced with
modern reflectors and new lenses, doub-
ling the total amount of light which
previously was poured onto the statue.
The most difficult problems of illum-
ination were encountered in properly

The lighting system of the statue

installing the lights which were to be
the torch-flame. The oven-like heat
generated by the cluster of lamps with-
in the unventilated torch was more than
any ordinary light sources could with-
stand. Six 400-watt mercury-vapor
lamps, to provide a bluish-white bril-
liance, were added to the thirteen 1,000-
watt lamps and the 2 50-watt lamp
which previously provided the torch's
flame. A suggestion for installing
orange-tinted sodium-vapor lamps in the
torch had to be dropped because of the
large and heavy equipment necessary
for such lamps. In addition to size and
weight factors, the light placed in the
torch must necessarily possess low main-
tenance factors, since the torch tower
is accessible only with difficulty.
The adverse weather conditions atop
the statue were counteracted by re-
building the glass walls which enclose
the torch chamber. The 600 panes of
glazed cathedral glass are graduated in
color from a deep amber at the base of
the torch to a clear white at the top.
Set in non-hardening putty, these glass
wall are flexible enough to withstand
the 60 mph winds which blow at the
top of the tower, and also water-proof
the torch chamber against rain and sleet.
The combined brilliance of the light
bathing Miss Liberty is equal to 2S00
times the illumination from the moon,
or 50-foot candles, which is more than
four times the effective light emitted
from an average reading lamp. The
radiant spectacle of New York harbor
will further serve as practical warning
marker for ships and planes.
100-octane gasoline
100-octane gasoline is one of the great
technological advances brought by the
pressure of the recent world war. Al-
though this progress would probably
have come about eventually in normal
times the new gasoline was such a vital
factor in our war effort that its develop-
ment was given a high priority.
A modern, high-compression aviation
engine develops 2200 hp., while a 1927
model of the same weight could only
develop 525 hp. Using 100-octane gaso-
line, greater power has been gained,
without increasing the size or weight of
the engine, by increasing the compres-
sion ratio in the cylinders. Since in-
creasing the compression ratio, while
using low-octane gasoline, would result
in dangerous knock vibrations, high-test
fuel must necessarily be utilized in any
high-powered engine.
When knocking was first encountered,
it was thought to be caused by prema-
ture ignition, and it was reduced by re-
tarding the spark in the cylinder. How-
ever, researchers eventually discovered,
through experimenting with various
designs of engines, that knocking w
produced by the explosion, rather thaj»
burning, of a small part of the fuel mix-
ture. The resulting sudden force upon
the piston, rather than a slower, pro-
gressive push, caused the familiar
knocking sounds and vibrations. Sev-
eral coal-tar hydrocarbans were discov-

they were too expensive for commercial
use. In 1921 Thomas Midgley, Jr., of
General Motors Company, after adding
many compounds to ordinary gasoline,
discovered that tetraethyl lead possessed
the long sought-for anti-knock charac-
teristics.
Midgeley found that very little tetra-
ethyl lead was needed to obtain a
greatly improved fuel, but it still didn't
compare with today's 100-octane gaso-
line. The octane rating-scale, incident-
ally, was established five vears after
selecting crude oils whose hydrocarbons
have high anti-knock qualities, a gaso-
line can be produced which has an oc-
tane rating of 75. Several cubic centi-
meters of lead tetraehtyl per gallon of
gasoline will increase this fuel's octane
rating to about 87. This new 87-octane
fuel gave designing engineers the op-
portunity to construct engines with
higher compression ratios, thus increas-
ing by i37c the power output over that
obtained from 60-octane fuel.
It was at this point that the octane
rating scale was established, for iso-

octane, a hydrocarbon which wouldn't
knock in the most powerful engines
available at that time, was discovered.
It would seem that the problem of pro-
ducing anti-knock fuel was solved, but
satisfactory results were still a long way
off. First, iso-octane does not vaporize
very well when used by itself; and.
second, this fuel would cost around $20
per gallon. However, through further
experiments, scientists discovered that
when iso-octane was added to a 75-oc-
tane basestock gasoline, the further
addition of lead tetraethyl would boost
the final octane rating to 100. Thus, a
great stride in the commercial produc-

And, in addition, as if he had not
already done enough to make Michigan
proud of him, he was named the out-

Mert, a native and lifelong resident
of Pontiac, Michigan, is not only an
athletic engineer, but has a fine scholas-
tic record as well, as is evidenced by his
membership in Tau Beta Pi, Phi Kappa
Phi and Sigma Xi.
His hobbies are model airplanes and

During his summers, Mert made him-

Mert not only believes in engineering
for the engineer, but in culture for the
engineer; being a firm believer in the

Roy S. Swinton, Associate Professor
of Engineering Mechanics, has returned
to his position on the faculty after a
five year absence. He has been on a
leave of absence at the University of
the Philippines.
He first went to the Philippines in
1911, immediately after his graduation.
Because he was the first engineer to
teach there, he lectured in many engi-
neering fields, and even conducted some
physics classes. He held that position
for three years, from 1911 to 1913. At
this time he returned to the United
States, and to his present position on
the faculty of the University. He taught

He remained in the city during the

The engineers became carpenters and
built beds, shelves, eating-tables, and
most of the things that they needed.
After the first year, the price of an
8d nail was about 5c so they learned to
build using rattan instead of nails.
At the beginning of the internment,
when there was enough to eat, they got
on quite well; but when the food was
cut down to one-fifth of a normal man's
requirements, they slipped quite badly.
The men lost on an average of fifty
pounds, and it is no wonder when one
considers the food not in their diet.
Meat, milk, eggs, and citrus fruits were
totally absent, one ounce of fish and
two bananas were one months supplv.

Swinton lectured as a member of the
Science Seminar, and among his stu-
dents were some American citizens.
Several of these students are now study-
ing at M.I.T., and several more are
expected to enroll here at the University
of Michigan this fall.
After thirty-seven months of impris-
onment, the American army captured
the city, and on February 3, 1945, the
internees at Santo Tomas were released.
Professor Swinton returned to the

This is the heart of the simple
Texrope Multiple V-Belt that solved
a problem plant engineers had been

Multiple V-Belt Drives, invented
by A-C, eliminated usual "jungle"

Even on farms, A-C engineering is
at work. It produced the first low-

the One-Man Hay Baler—machines
that mean big savings in time and
manpower on family-sized farms.

A large part of the flour for U. S.
bread and pastry is milled by A-C

(Continued from page 13)
The fault, I believe, has not been in
the student himself as much as in the
traditional pattern of his education. He
is natively quite as intelligent and alert
as his friends across the campus; at
least as diligent and serious minded:
and certainly as heavily worked. I am
not questioning the student, but the
character of the curriculum to which
he has been entrusted; to one of my
bias for the humanities, it has seemed
far too narrow. Say what one will—
and I resent it as much as the next
person—on any university campus, stu-
dents of the Engineering College are
likely to be students of the "engine"
school. The stricture is annoying and
in many ways unfair, but it does point
out a weakness in the traditional cur-
riculum—its failure to provide the stu-
dent with much more than a technical
training. No one, of course, in his sane
mind, questions the value of that train-
ing, or of the obvious need in an engi-
neering college to stress the technical:
but it may be seriously questioned
whether that type of education alone
is sufficient, especially in the world of
today, where more and more, it would
seem, emphasis must be placed upon
human understanding, upon a sense of
social responsibility, and upon the need
for effective cooperation among all
classes and races if we are to have any-
thing like the better world we all dream
of and believe not impossible to attain.
The proposal to increase the human-
istic-social studies in the engineering
curriculum is, I believe, an excellent
one, primarily because it will make for
more liberality of view in the student
and for a more generous perspective of
man and events. It will certainly con-
stitute no panacea; a few short courses
in the humanities cannot provide the
student with that organized knowledge
of man and his problems, that tempered
and wise adjustment to the world that
may constitute the ideal of a liberal
education—a lifetime is hardly suffi-
cient for that. But even the modest
range of humanitarian and social studies
recommended by the Committee should
make for a greater interest in and a
better understanding of man and his
institutions, and hence for a more lib-
eral and socially minded type of gradu-
ate.
Xor would the benefits of the pro-
posed change be limited to those accru-
in the requirements of their profession,
but relatively uninformed in the social
and economic problems of the world of
which they are inexorably a part. Only
too often these students leave college
with no balanced perspective of man
because they know little or nothing of
his history, the institutions which he
has created and modified, the major
observations he has made on the mean-
ing of his own life and that of society,
and the principal solutions he has of-
fered to the inescapable problems grow-
ing out of the political, economic, and
racial organization of mankind. Only
too often they go out into the world
with but slight appreciation of the
realms outside their profession that can
offer them great personal pleasure and
an insight into the nature of man—re-
ligion, art, literature, music.
And—especially important—only too
often, I should judge, they fail to
realize that they have a social responsi-
bility no less grave than that of other
educated men. They feel that their
contribution to society will be complete
when they have produced the useful
inventions and techniques by which life
is made easier for us all, or created the
engineering structures by which the
business of the world is expedited.
These are indeed great and indispens-
able contributions, worthy of the
noblest praise. But they are not enough.
Engineers have no more right, in my
opinion, than the pure scientists, to as-
sume that their responsibility ends with
the laboratory. They have the civic
obligation of all educated men to give
active support and leadership to all
agencies seeking through honest means
to correct economic injustice, to insure
peace, to eliminate political corruption,
race prejudice, class and religious ha-
treds. They have the obligation of all
educated men to encourage and support
the various art manifestations of their
area and of the nation, and to promote
philanthropic and humane activities in
the community of which they are a
part. In brief, they have a duty as
urgent as that for any type of college
graduate: to make their influence felt,
wherever and whenever possible, in the
creation of a more just, more sane, and
more enlightened world. As far as I
have been able to judge, all too few
engineering students leave college with
any such feeling of responsibility to
their fellow men.
HUMANITIES
ing to society. With greater diversifica-
tion of study, the engineering student
himself would, I believe, find that in-
crease in personal satisfaction and hap-
piness which comes to all of us when-
ever new vistas are opened up and new
subjects revealed for the mind's con-
templation. Even such introductory
courses as the program would provide
(they could hardly be more) would at
least offer fresh points of view and the
delight of intellectual adventure. They*
might do a good deal more: create in-
terests and recreational pleasures ade-
quate for a lifetime. And after the green
salad days when mere living itself is
sufficient, such secondary pursuits are
valuable, nay essential to any well-
balanced life. No professional man can
spend twenty-four hours a day at his
job without going to the madhouse. A
shift in intellectual focus, a change in
tempo, a fascinating and fruitful hobby
have a therapeutic value that many a
professional man has recognized and
taken advantage of. I knew at one time
a lawyer whose favorite relaxation was
the reading of the ancient historians; I
know a doctor whose hobby is the study
of poetry. Mathematicians are fre-
quently expert musicians. Bankers and
business men often become amateur
astronomers, archaeologists, composers,
geologists, painters, and what not. I
believe that they lead happier and fuller
lives as a result; nor am I persuaded
that their professional activity suffers
as a consequence. To be the master of
one trade but a dilettante in several
seems to me an excellent combination;
at the best it adds to the joy of life;
at the least it is insurance against mid-
dle-age boredom.
My last reason for favoring the pro-
posed changes I state hesitantly. There
has been much discussion of late. I
gather, on ways and means of inducing
the public at large to view engineering
as a profession in quite the same way
that it views law and medicine as pro-
fessions. The matter was discussed at
length at regional meetings of the
S.P.E.E. held in Ann Arbor in 1944.
It became clear that people in general
are not as willing to accord the engi-
neer the professional status that they
do a doctor, for example. And various
explanations for this attitude were
given. Speaking as a layman (and here

rivers many times as large as the flow
in the late summer months. Unless such
floods can be impounded in large stor-
age reservoirs and held over until the
dry season periods, much of it rushes
down stream, spills over the waste ways
of the dams and is lost to power genera-
tion. Hence the serial development of
our rivers, with each additional plant
providing some improvement in the
control and regulation of the water
flow, does much to increase the effi-
ciency and usefulness of our water re-
sources. The precipitation which falls
as snow is more slowly transferred to
surface run-off, particularly if foresta-
tion, vegetation, and agricultural devel-
opment help to hold it back. However,
if the ground is frozen under the snow,
a sudden thaw and warm rain will send
it off in a hurry as a flood flow of huge
proportions. In this respect the north-
ern part of our state is a better con-
servationist than the southern part, be-
cause the greater cold in the north holds
the snow for the entire winter season
and releases it gradually as surface run-
off in the spring.
The largest hydro-electric plant in
Michigan is on a boundary stream of
the Upper Peninsula and is that of the
Michigan Northern Power Company at
Sault Ste. Marie. Here the St. Mary's
River brings an average flow of about
75,000 cubic feet per second out of
Lake Superior down a 19-foot drop into
Lake Huron after a river journey of
16 miles. The power plant is an indus-
trial one, the capacity being some 37,000
kw., and the output going to the Union
Carbide Company. This power is owned
by the United States Government be-
cause of its association with the Soo
locks. It is an ideal hydro power devel-
opment, because the industrial com-
pany operates 24 hours per day and the
power plant is supplied with practically
constant flow throughout the year, by
reason of its use of the 32,000 square
miles of Lake Superior for a storage
reservoir.
Another river in the Upper Peninsula
which is important from the point of
view of power possibilities is the On-
tonagon. Although it is eleventh in the
state in terms of its drainage area and
like all the upper peninsula streams is
quite short, still in its length of 70 miles
it has a total fall of over 1000 feet.
This makes for a high stream in flood
(Continued from page 16)
time with a swift flow which soon runs
off to a minimum. However, with the
hills which Nature has provided, the
hydraulic engineer has a chance to lo-
cate impounding reservoirs on such a
stream, both to generate power and to
regulate the flow to some extent. The
Ontonagon has 4 branches (the South,
the East, the Middle and the West) all
flowing northerly to a junction near
Rockland, from where the main stream
cuts through the Copper Range and
goes down a steep descent into Lake
Superior at Ontonagon.
The Saginaw River proper, though
only 20 miles long itself, has the largest
primary drainage basin in the state be-
cause it is formed by the junctions
within about 4 miles of four important
tributaries, the Tittabawassee, which

put on a spectacular flood this spring,
the Shiawassee, the Flint, and the Cass.
This basin occupies the East end of the
great valley which cuts across the Lower
Peninsula from Lake Michigan to Sagi-
naw Bay, running along the valleys of
the Grand and Maple Rivers from Lake
Michigan into Gratiot County, then
over a divide and down the Shiawassee
and the Saginaw River into the Bay.
The summit in this valley is about 85
feet above the level of the Bay. There
are some 21 impounding dams on the
streams of this basin, 3 on the Cass,
6 on the Flint, 2 on the Shiawassee, and
10 on Tittabawassee.
Now let us go a little to the north
and take the Au Sable River, famous
as an old lumbering and trout stream.
From its source in Otsego County the
Au Sable runs south and east some 100
miles, not counting bends, to its mouth
at Lake Huron, having a total drop of
about 650 feet in this length. Because
of the pervious nature of three quarters
of its watershed, the sand and gravel
conserves the precipitation which it re-
ceives and so regulates the flow through
the seasons, a%'oiding extremely low
water. Thus it is an important unit in
the hydraulic system of the Consumers
Power Company which placed six power
plants on the river, namely the Mio.
Alcona, Loud, Five-channels. Cooke
and Foote Dams. These developments
are of moderate capacity, ranging from
4.000 to 9,000 kw. but represent a total
of 41,000 kw., thus putting the Au
Sable in second place for power in the
Lower Peninsula.
The Muskegon River is probably the
most important stream in the Lower
Peninsula so far as hydro-electric power
is concerned. It rises in and near two
of our largest inland lakes, Higgins of
15 sq. mi. area and Houghton of 31
sq. mi. area, in Roscommon County and
flows southwesterly to its outlet into
Lake Michigan at Muskegon. It has
about 600 feet of fall in its total length
of some 150 miles and ranks fifth among
our rivers in terms of the area of its
drainage basin. Because of the un-
usually large portion of its watershed
which is in lakes and swamps and the
hilly nature of the country along its
course, the conditions are favorable for
power dams acting as impounding reser-
voirs. This fact has been recognized
by the engineers of the Consumers
Power Company, who have built a very
notable plant on the river at Hardy
Dam. Here an earth dam obtains a
head of 100 feet, the highest in Michi-
gan, with a water storage capacity of
about 4,000 acres, almost twice that of
any other dam in the Consumers sys-
tem. The 30,000 kw. installed here plus
the capacities of the three other hydro-
electric plants on the stream, viz.,
Croton, Newaygo, and Rogers, make a
total development of 47,000 kw. for the
river.
In third place for power capacity in
the Lower Peninsula, I think we should
place the Manistee River. From its
source in the lakes on the common
boundary of Antrim and Otsego Coun-

I go out on a limb—the very tip of the
limb), I should say that the principal
reason for this lamentable state of af-
fairs is that engineers are not given
a professional man's education. Law,
medicine, and even dentistry require a
cultural as well as a technical educa-
tion, often four years in a literary col-
lege as a prerequisite for entrance to
the professional school. It may be that
they require too much, but evidently
those in administrative control assume
that technical knowledge alone is in-
sufficient for a lawyer or doctor in the'
contemporary world. Is engineering of j
less importance than these other call-
ings? The public, I believe, would be
quite as ready to accept the engineer
as a professional man if his education
were comparable to that of his col-
leagues in medicine and law. Hence
among the various benefits from the
proposed extension of the humanistic
and social studies, this. I should assume,
would not be a minor one: that it would
be a step in securing, not greater im-
portance, but greater dignity for the
engineering profession itself.
MICHIGAN WATER POWER
(Continued from page 26)
ties it flows southwest through some
200 winding miles of channel to its
mouth at Manistee where it empties
into Lake Michigan. In this length it
has a total fall of about 620 feet and
a drainage basin which in area ranks
eighth largest in the state. Much of its
water supply is from springs and it has
some hilly places along its course which
offer opportunities for power develop-
ment. The Consumers Power Company
has utilized two of these sites, one with
the Tippy Dam, and the other with the
Hodenpyl Dam. These plants have
generator capacities of 20,000 kw. and
18,000 kw. respectively.
Limitation of space prevents mention
of the individual plants on our smaller
rivers, frequently at an old mill site
where power has been developed contin-
uously for many years. Typical of these
plants are the hydro power stations of
Mr. Henry Ford and Hayden Mill at
Tecumseh.
For the future of water power de-
velopment in Michigan I think we can
look first to the Upper Peninsula where
the Ontonagon and Sturgeon Rivers
offer a number of sites where gowl
heads can be de%'eloped. Although the
most attractive sites have been utilized
in the Lower Peninsula still some addi-
tional locations are available.
In alternative forms of power the
mechanical engineer is continually im-
proving the efficiency of steam and
diesel plants, principally by going to
much higher pressures and temperatures
in his thermal cycle. However, the gain
he makes here is pitted against higher
taxes, greater labor and material costs
and continued increase in the price of
coal, which is now over $5 a ton to the
power companies in the state. These
conditions will justify further develop-
ments of remaining hydro-sites unless
our gas and oil production can meet the
growing demands for power. The engi-
neer has to consider all available sources
of power and, other things being equal,
select the most economical one. Each
needed development, then, will present
a particular problem of its own. to b?
solved in terms of the engineering and
economic factors which apply at that
time and location.

With the new RCA lifeboat radio, shipwrecks need no lonuer take a terrible toll of lives.
A two-way radiophone—for lifeboats!
Here's when a telephone comes in rather
handy . . . when you can "get your party"
and hear "We'll be there to get you in a
couple of hours!"
With the new RCA compact lifeboat
radio, that's exactly what happens. A kite,
or a balloon, takes the antenna up 300 feet.
Turn the power-generating cranks and
out goes an SOS —along with a direction-
finder beam so shore stations can figure
your exact location.
But even more amazing, shipwrecked
mariners can talk with the men on their
way to the rescue. They can "pick up" ships,
airplanes, and that wonderful place called
"land"—even if it's 1000 miles away!
Endless research, such as went into de-
veloping this lifeboat radio, goes into all
RCA products.
And when you buy an RCA Victor radio,
or television set or Victrola, you enjoy a
unique pride of ownership in knowing that
you possess one of the finest instruments
of its kind that science has achieved.

the casting wheel. The ribbon then goes
to a rotary cutter which chips the mate-
rial into flakes to facilitate handling
and further processing.
Next, blending of the flakes from
several autoclave batches is carried out
to insure uniformity. The blended flake
is then poured onto spinning hoppers,
and each charge is purged of oxygen by
I passing into a blast of pre-purified ni-
trogen. The nitrogen is later removed.
The valve at the lower end of the
spinning hopper is opened and the flakes
fall onto a melting grid, where again
Dowtherm supplies the heat. The
molten polymer then passes through the
grid into a funnel shaped chamber.
From there it goes to a filter where it
is filtered through a layer of hot sand
to insure smoothness and purity. Sand
is used since it is easy to handle, is
cheap, and can withstand high tempera-
tures. The polymer is then drawn by a
special gear pump into the spinneret
assembly. This is a thick disc of metal.
2 inches in diameter, pierced with fine
holes flaring out like tiny funnels at
the upper ends where the polymer en-
ters. The thick syrupy liquid is then
squeezed through the holes of the spin-
neret. The filaments are formed at the
rate of 1000 feet per minute and pass
through a three sided chimney, where
a draft of air cools them. They next
converge and pass into a steam jacket
which moistens them enough to make
them stick together as a strand. During
the working process which follows, the
yarn passes over a lubricating roll,
which puts a finish on the surface. This
not only helps the filaments to stick to-
gether, but prevents static electricity
from being produced. This static elec-
tric effect is very pronounced in nylon
because the moisture regain of the yarn
is considerably lower than that of other
textile fibers. If allowed to go un-
checked, the static will cause the fila-
ments to balloon as soon as the tension
on them is released. In addition, dust
particles will be picked up. Also, there
is the danger of electrical shock to fac-
tory personnel. All metal parts should
be grounded or adequate static elimina-
tors installed.
The yarn is now pretwisted. and
several strands may be pleated together
to get a heavier denier yarn. Denier is
the term used to define the weight di-
ameter relationship and. therefore, in-
directly, the fineness of the yarn. A
one denier fiber is one of such size that
9000 meters of it weigh one gram. A
one denier filament of nylon has a di-
ameter of approximately 1/2 500th of
an inch.
Up to this point the nylon has un-
dergone no physical change, since it has
come out of the spinneret. Now it is
drawn or stretched by traveling be-
tween two rolls revolving at different
speeds so that it becomes several times
its original length. The amount of
stretch produced is proportional to the
difference in the peripheral speeds of the
two rollers. This cold drawing makes
the long chain chrystalline molecules of
nylon snap out of their helter-skelter
arrangement and line up parallel to each
other and close together. It increases
the opportunity for powerful intermole-
cular forces to come into play, and so
results in an exceedingly strong fiber.
During the cold drawing process two
conditions must be scrupulously avoid-
ed. First of all, care must be exercised
not to break the fiber. Secondly, as be-
fore, there is the presence of static
electricity. This latter effect can be
avoided by moistening the strands with
water, or preferably with iso-butyl al-
cohol.
After it is drawtwisted, the yarn is
twisted again and then sized. The siz-
ing material is applied to protect the
yarn. It also binds the filaments to-
gether during the textile knitting and
weaving operations. It is removed when
the nylon fabrics are scoured and fin-
ished. The sizing often used is poly-
vinyl alcohol.
The yarn is finally twist-set in a
steam oven. The process relieves in-
ternal stresses and strains and prevents
kinking.
If the yarn is to be used for hosier.',
it should be preboarded after the textile
knitting and weaving operations, but
prior to the scouring and dyeing. Pre-
boarding means that the fabric is placed
on a form and subjected to a definite
temperature under saturation conditions

for a definite time. This operation stab-
ilizes the stocking against distortion of
stitch by subjecting it to higher tem-
peratures than those which would be
subsequently encountered. The result
is a seamless stocking, unheard of until
a few years ago. It removes the trouble
of wrinkling, which in the early stages
of production of nylon made it unde-
sirable for stocking wear, even though
its wearing properties were exception-
ally good. This wrinkling was pro-
duced by the scouring, dyeing, and
handling of the fabric.
The physical properties of nylon dif-
fer from those of any other man-made
fiber. It is an entirely new, basic class
of materials, having the combined char-
acteristics of metals, plastics and rub-
ber. It is stronger, more elastic and
more durable than silk, but less soft
and absorbent. Although it is very
tough, it is very fine. All nylon pos-
sesses a low modulus of elasticity with
slow but definite recovery. It is simi-
lar to rubber in this respect, except that
nylon does not yield to stretch as read-
ily as rubber, nor does it stretch to the
same extent. On recovery nylon comes
back more slowly than rubber.
Nylon is solid and dense, yet very
light in weight. It gives much more
coverage for a thread of a given weight
than most common fibers, even though
it appears bulky. This greater coverage
is true for two reasons. First of all,
it is translucent. Secondly, the thread
is very compact, since each individual
filament is uniformly circular in cross-
section and free from surface irregulari-
ties. Thus, nylon hose possesses greater
sheerness than silk hose of the same
gauge and weight.
Compared with materials outside the
textile field, it has a remarkable advan-
tage in light weight. Nylon wire (sp.
gr. 1.14), for example, is substituted
for copper wire (ap. gr. 8.9) as indus-
trial filter screening. Below, the density
of nylon is compared with that of vari-
ous other fibers.
(Continued from page 30)
Elastic recovery is the ability of a
material to regain its original length
after being stretched. The time in-
volved in this recovery is the important
factor. Without this property it is im-
possible to produce fabrics which will
maintain their original shape or con-
form to a specific contour of the body.
The cling or fit of nylon results from
the inherent elastic recovery of this
fiber.

Stress-strain curves.
Nylon gives a typical stress-strain
graph. Its power of recovery is superior
to that of most other textile fibers.
However, at low loadings nylon is more
susceptible to strain, being more exten-
sible at loadings below .5gm. per den..
than silk, viscose or acetate. Above 1
gm. per den. it is less susceptible to
loadings than viscose, acetate, or vin-
yon; and above 2-2.5 gm. per den., it
is better than silk. These facts are of
practical importance, since the tensions
imposed in the processing of yarn are
in the order of .3-.4 gm. per den. in
throwing and .1 gm. per den. in chees-
ing. Thus, nylon at these low loading?
tends to elongate more than any other
textile material, and the tensions must
be kept as evenly controlled and as low
as possible to prevent tight ends, picks
and puckers.

Nylon returns slowly to its original
shape after tension upon it is released.
This phenomenon is called "creep.'
With an applied tension in effect for
several days, nylon will return 50%
of the stretch imparted immediately
upon release of the tension, S5% after
the first 24 hours, and completely after
two weeks.
The ease of stretching increases with
an increase in the relative humidity.
Also, since the elasticity of nylon is
similar to that of rubber, it constantly
returns to its original length after being
held under stretched conditions. It
possesses such a contracting force that

it is capable of crushing cones, spools,
and the bobbins upon which it is wound.
Thus, it must be wound carefully and
not too thickly, or otherwise the exces-
sive bulk will yield too great a crush-
ing force.
Nylon may be manufactured with
either high or low tenacity as desired.
The less the ultimate (breaking) elong-
ation, the higher the tenacity. The
tenacity may vary from 4.5-7.0 gm.
per den. with a corresponding average
elongation from 20%-12% (determined
at 72% r.h.). The tenacity of the yarn
when wet is from 84-90% of that when
dry. The corresponding elongation of
the wet yarn is 5-30f/r greater than that
of the dry yarn. Both of these measure-
ments were made at a relative humidity

The moisture regain of nylon is con-
siderably less than that of silk, cotton,
viscose rayon, and acetate rayon at any
one relative humidity. For example, at
65% r.h., it is 3.8% for nylon, 11% for
silk, 7.5% for cotton. 16^ for wool,
12% for viscose rayon, and 6%: for ace-
tate rayon. This low moisture regain of
nylon, though, makes it more suscep-
tible to the accumulation of static elec-
tricity, as previously pointed out. It
is, thus, important to keep the relative
humidity high enough to prevent static,
yet low enough so as not to cause sticki-
ness.
Water, glycerine and W/&lt; sodium hy-
droxide solution cause no lateral swell-
ing of nylon fibers. Its wet length
varies, however, from 3% gain to an
actual loss, depending upon the degree
of previous relaxation and the removal
of residual shrinkage. The following
table shows that boiling water has more
effect on shrinking than steam at atmos-
pheric pressure.
Nylon has high resistance to abrasion.
This resistance is attributed to the in-
herent toughness, natural pliability, and
the ability to undergo a high degree of

flexing without breakdown. Also, since
the surfaces of nylon filaments are
smooth, little friction is created by the
rubbing together of these surfaces and
abrasion resistance is improved.
Due to this superiority in abrasion
resistance, nylon has been used exten-
sively in hose, particularly as an enforc-
ing thread in the toe or heel, where
it has shown superior wear to silk,
rayon, and cotton. Nylon consistently
gives two to three times the wear of
comparable gauges and weights of all
silk hose.
Nylon is inert to all organic acids,
carbon bisulfide, halogenated, hydrocar-
bons, carbon tetrachloride, alkalies,
soaps, gasoline, benzene, benzine, alde-
hydes, ketones, and alcohols. It is af-
fected by formic and carbolic acids,
these two substances being solvents for
nylon. Other solvents possible for ny-
lon are meta-cresol, cresylic acid, and
xylenol at 25°C.
Oxidizing agents and mineral acids
do degrade nylon. Boiling in 5% hy-
drochloriic acid makes it brittle and
eventually causes complete disintegra-
tion. Cold concentrated nitric acid
rapidly disintegrates it.
Most types of insects will not attack
or eat nylon. This is particularly of
importance in considering the clothes
moth which causes untold damage to
wool fabrics, but will not harm nylon.
Undyed, unfinished nylon yarns and
fabrics have a marked resistance to
molds, fungi, and other micro-organ-
isms. They are completely unaffected
by cellulose-destroying organisms, which
completely destroy cotton. The use of
certain finishes on nylon might induce
or support the formation of a mold on
the finish, but this, in general, does
not impair the strength of the fabric.

In general, nylon is very resistant to
heat, and because of this resistance, its
ironing properties are good. There is
no effect on tensile strength up to
180°C. At 135 !C unset creases may be
removed. At 180°C sticking begins,
and at around 230 C damage starts.

The effect of extreme cold on nylon
is negligible. Its tenacity and strength
are only slightly affected, and the de-
crease in elongation is exceedingly small.
Nylon is much more resistant to
burning than silk, rayon or cotton. Un-
dyed, finish-free nylon yarn will melt at
480°F if a flame is applied. As soon
as the flame is removed, however, it
hardens with no further tendency to
flame. Thus, nylon may be considered
flame proof. If inflammable oils, pig-
ments, dyes, or finishes are on the
fabric, though, it is possible that the
thread may support the combustion.

METAL MUSCLES

What muscles are to human bodies, S. S. White flexible shafts are
to mechanical bodies. Like muscles, S. S. White flexible shafts
are flexible elements for transmitting rotational power and con-
trol to moving parts—metal murcles for motivating all kinds of
driven and controlled mechanisms—muscles that never get tired
and are practically immune from injury.
As basic mechanical elements for power transmission and
remote control, S. S. White flexible shafts offer many physical
and economic advantages. Chief among these are their simplicity
for the purposes they serve and their ready adaptability.
These advantages are the reasons why annually, millions of
feet of S. S. White flexible shafts go into aircraft, motor vehicles,
machinery, portable tools, radio and electronic equipment and a
wide variety of other products.
As an engineer you will find it well worth while to familiarize
yourself with the range and scope and possibilities of these
metal muscles for power transmission and remote control.
THIS BULLETIN WILL HELP YOU
It gives the basic facts and technical data about
flexible shafts and discusses their application for
specific power drive and remote control requirements.

fast. These are the best leveling dyes
for nylon. Acid wool, direct cotton,
mordant and metal-containing dyestuffs
can also be used. Vat and azo dyes are
not easy to apply and are not fast.
The use of nylon involves no greater
hazard than that of rayon or natural
degummed silk. Repeated experiments
have proved that nylon possesses no
harmful toxic properties and is incap-
able of causing skin reactions. No ill
effects on plant employees have been
produced. Nylon, in addition, has met
the rigid suture requirements of the
medical profession, so that it is now
used successfully in surgical work.
Nylon was first introduced to the
public for ladies hosiery in May. 1940.
As was previously stated, it was for
this specific purpose that nylon was
originally conceived. However, in the
years that have followed a wide varia-
tion of applications and uses has ex-
tended tremendously the scope of the
nylon industry.
Due to its high strength and resilency
nylon is used in conjunction with rayon
in the tires of heavy bombers, where
the necessity of withstanding inflation
and the shock of landing are essential.
Nylon is used in the fabrication of
tents for jungle and Alpine use, where
resistance to rot, insects, and cold is
requisite.
The use of nylon has also played an
important part in the production of
parachutes. Before the war, this coun-
try was almost totally dependent upon
Japan for silk, and if nylon had not
been developed, the outcome of the war
might have been decidedly different.
As it has turned out, nylon has com-
pletely taken the place of silk in the
production of parachutes, and it has
proved superior in every respect to silk,
being unaffected by mildew, insects, and
less susceptible to ripping.
Nylon has also been used extensively
in tooth brushes, paint brushes, clothes
brushes and many other types of
brushes. Originally, antural bristles
were used all over the world, the bristle
being obtained from the skin of the
wild boar, and imported from the Far
East. The sizes of the bristles were
more or less restricted and were difficult
to obtain. In the production of nylon
bristles, many different sizes can be
easily obtained and a uniform taper

achieved. Nylon bristles last three to
four times longer than similar natural
ones, and they are unaffected by the
usual organic solvents used in the man-
ufacture of paints, stains, lacquers,
enamels, and cleaning fluids. They are
not attacked by moths, rats, or mice,
which destroy natural bristles.
Other uses of nylon include strings
for tennis rackets, fishing lines, surgical
sutures, furniture, tow ropes for gliders,
With the technical improvements and
manufacturing efficiency brought about
by the experience gained in wartime
production, postwar prices will be much
less than prewar. Also suitable facilities
will be available for production due to
wartime expansion. Pre-Pearl Harbor
prices of $3.10 per Ib, for 40 denier
bobbins and $2.80 per Ib. for 70 denier
bobbins have already been reduced to
$1.90 and $1.62 respectively, and the

braid for cargo nets, shoe laces, sash
cords, window curtains, men's wearing
apparel, carbureter diaphragms, wire
screens, blood filters, tough films, sheet-
ing, and slide fasteners.
When nylon first appeared in 1940
in the hosiery market, the Dupont
Company was unable to supply the de-
mand. The war soon interrupted subse-
quent plant expansions for civilian use,
and the entire industry was converted
for the wartime needs of the nation. At
the present time, two large plants of
the Dupont Company are producing
nylon. These plants are situated at
Seaford, Delaware, and at Martinsville,
Virginia. With satisfactory conditions
the plants will be enlarged in a two
year plan. This enlargement will make
it possible to produce from 22 million
to 23 million pounds of nylon a year.
indications are that they will be re-
duced still further in the near future.
The anticipated postwar production of
nylon is 23 million pounds as compared
to a present rayon production of 800
million pounds, cotton production of
5600 million pounds, and a wool pro-
duction of 650 million pounds.
In general, the possibilities of nylon
are almost unlimited. Applications in
fabrics where strength, elasticity, light-
ness, quick drying,, and low moisture
content are desirable are innumerable.
These great applications should not be
construed to mean that nylon will dis-
place the other popular fabrics. Each
has its desirable characteristics and
properties. Nonetheless the future pos-
sibilities of nylon are enormous, and it
appears to be destined to be one of the
world's greatest discoveries.

theless, there still remained the problem
of producing large quantities of iso-
octane at a cost of a few cents a gal-
lon, and of securing sufficient quantities
of high-grade base-stock gasoline.
Tso-octane was first obtained by sub-
jecting isobutylene, a waste gas from
the refinery, to heat, pressure, and a
catalyst, until polymerization occurred,
producing di-isobutylene. This com-
pound was further changed by hydro-

which finally succeeded is called cataly-
tic cracking, and is another scheme for
rearranging hydrocarbon molecules so
as to change undesirable types into de-
sirable ones. The process previously
employed was called thermal cracking,
which consisted of the distillation of
crude oil, with the application of heat
and pressure. This older method had
increased gasoline production from 20
to 40 barrels of gasoline per 100 barrels
of crude oil. Unfortunately, gasoline ob-
tained from thermal cracking is not
nearly so much improved by the addi-
tion of lead tetraethyl as is the product
of catalytic cracking.

ation of the complicated and heavy
equipment for the process. However, in
1938, a procedure called alkylation was
perfected. The hydrogenation reaction
was eliminated, and the refinery gases,
butylene and iso-butylene, were merely-
bubbled through sulfuric acid or hydro-
gen fluoride. Butylene was abundant,
and iso-butane was obtained by poly-
merizing normal butane. Thus, when
the war began, sufficient production of
iso-Octane was assured.
However, the biggest problem of ob-
taining adequate quantities of high-
grade base-stock gasoline was yet to be
solved satisfactorily. The procedure
The Houdry Process, perfected be-
tween 1920 and 1935, was the first com-
merical method of catalytic cracking.
By passing the crude oil stock through
a bed of catalytic material, a synthetic
silica-alumina compound, the cracking
reaction is accelerated and the products
are. amazing though it may seem, higher
quality hydrocarbons. The catalyst be-
comes progressively clogged with coke,
and the charge is routed through an al-
ternate reacting chamber while the coke
is burned out with hot compressed air.
The production of aviation-gasoline
base-stock varies from 25-50% of the
crude oil. and at the time of Pearl Har-
bor, the Houdry Process was providini
most of our aviation gasoline demand?
Technology is, nevertheless, con-
stantly changing and improving, and i
greatly improved process, the Fluid
Catalytic-Cracking Process, has been
developed. It consists essentially of
providing the catalyst in fluid form—
that is, by introducing the very finely-
powdered catalyst into the vaporous
crude stock and allowing the catalyst
to react as the combined charge flow;
through the cracking chambers. Like
wise, the impurity-clogged particles ol
catalyst are regenerated by suspending
the minute particles in a stream of h&lt;i&lt;
compressed air. These improvements
over the Houdry Process are based upon
a very simple chemical fact—that in-
creasing the surface areas of the react-
ants involved in a reaction results in an
increase of areas which are exposed to
reaction. Consequently, the reaction is
greatly speeded up and goes toward
completion in a more uniform manner.
These improvements were developed for
practical use in a 100-barrel-a-day pilot
plant, operated by the Standard Oil
Development Company, and. sine? 1942.
have been incorporated into forty 13.-
000 barrel-a-day units.
Another improvement over the Hou-
dry Process is the Thermofor Cataly-
tic-Cracking (T.C.C.) Process. As in
the fluid process, the catalyst is circu-
lated through the cracking chambers,
but it is in the form of beads and pel-
lets, instead of powder. At several
stages in the system, it is necessary to
transport the particles of catalyst on
mechanical conveyors, instead of in a
blast of compressed air and oil vapors
One-hundred-octane gasoline will be
employed extensively in commercial
aviation, after the war. This will enable
commercial planes to fly faster, earn
heavier cargoes, and make fewer refuel-
ing stops along extended routes. Event-
ually, automobile owners will experience
the benefits of this high-test fuel, when
auto engines are redesigned to satis-
factorily accommodate the peculiarities
of high-compression fuel reactions. Gas-
oline development is continuing, and
even higher-grade fuels are being stud-
ied, so that the aviation and automo-
tive fields are wide open for many new
improvements in fuel.

fire weapon against japan
The history of warfare is full of in-
stances when fire was used as a major
weapon against an enemy. In ancient
times the defenders of a city would pour
blazing pitch down from the walls of
their city and upon the enemy attempt-
ing to scale the walls. Even the Amer-
ican Indians employed fire against the
white man, in an attempt to halt west-
ward migration. When the Indians
tried to storm a stockade or fort, they
would shoot burning arrows into the
besieged area, so that the white men
would be forced to divert men from the
garrison to battle fires in the burning
buildings. During the first World War
the Germans made use of aerial incen-
diary bombs, about the size of footballs,
which contained gasoline. They were
utilized in raids upon supply dumps
and service centers, since they were in-
effective as a front-line weapon against
infantry.
The first really destructive incendiary
bomb to be developed in this war con-
sisted of a steel case which was filled
with magnesium particles. Also included
in the assembly were a firing mechanism
to ignite the magnesium upon impact,
and a tail-fin to accurately direct the

pressure vessels of many shapes in numerous refining

Designing and building all kinds of pressure vessels—
drums, tanks, towers, catalyst chambers, accumulators,
evaporators, heat exchangers, autoclaves as well as
related products, is a major activity of the versatile
Babcock &amp; Wilcox organization — and has been for
many years. In successfully supplying practical solu-

flight of the bomb. Another incendiary
weapon is composed of a magnesium
case, a thermite mixture of aluminum
and iron oxide, and an appropriate firing
device. These bombs develop great heat
and are quite destructive when dropped
in large numbers, since they range in
weight from two to four pounds each
However, for the American air force,
magnesium was too vitally needed for
manufacturing purposes to be used ex-
tensively in incendiaries, so that an al-
ternative material was sought.
It was known that both crude oil and
gasoline have a potential heat capacity
which is double that of magnesium,
whose heat capacity is 10,800 BTU per
pound. Consequently, it was perfectly
natural to direct research toward these
two materials, since we had a greater
abundance of them than of magnesium.
The final product which was created is
jellied oil, or "gel-gas." This material
is a heavy, doughy mass when it is
mixed with magnesium and other chem-
icals to form the substance "pyrogel.'
Pyrogel will supply more intense heat
than any metals previously used, will
burn in all directions, and will not spray
when spread by an explosive mixture
which is included in bombs made of
this material.
Rather it will shoot forth, upon ex-
plosion, in thick gobs, and will burn
fiercely and for a considerable period
of time wherever it is deposited.
Its greatest advantage over other in-
cendiary substances is that it supplies
its own oxygen for combustion. Thus,
these bombs are almost impossible to
extinguish. Instead, their fires must be
segregated and allowed to burn out.
The result is that huge conflagrations
have been produced in the tinder-box
cities of Japan.
Pyrogel bombs are made in several
sizes. Thirty-eight small ten-pound
charges, constructed with hexagonal-
shaped bodies, are clustered together in
a SOO-pound assembly, and are dropped
as a unit from a plane. Mechanical
devices release the cluster of missiles in
mid-air, so that their combined effect
will be spread over a large area. A
larger, 100-pound jellied-oil bomb has
found many uses on the tactical battle-
fronts, besides in stategic bombings. A
still larger SOO-pound "block-burner"
bomb has proved to be very useful
against heavy installations such as fac-
tories, machinery, and shipyards.

EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT IT, BUT-
"Everybody talks about the weather
but nobody docs anything about it."
Mark Twain
, UR excuse for dragging this famed
quotation into the light once more
is that it fits the situation so well. On
this occasion, however, we are going to
substitute Honor System for weather.
Every engineering student seems to
agree that the Honor System is dead on
its feet and everyone who was familiar
with the Honor System when it was in
its heyday is convinced that something
should be done to put it back in order.
Before continuing let us make sure that
we know what is meant by "Honor
System." The following material is con-
densed from the 1940 Arch, a publica-
tion designed to acquaint the incoming
freshman with the traditions of the
College of Engineering, sponsored by
the Engineering Council and the Michi-
gan Technic.
* * *
Our Honor System is based on the
principle that it is not only dishonor-
able but also detrimental for any man
to receive credit for work which is not
the result of his own effort. Honor is
a part of the code of a gentleman and
an engineer, and it is the basis of suc-
cess here at Michigan.
In the operation of the Honor System,
there are three main points which
should be observed:
1. It is neither fair nor honest to his
fellow students for a man to receive
aid on a written quiz or examina-
tion.
2. The prevention of dishonesty in ex-
aminations should be in the hands of
the students rather than the faculty.
3. It is the duty of all students, in fair-
ness to themselves and others, to
uphold these principles in word and
action.
The actual operation of the Honor
System is contained in the short and
simple phrase: "I have neither given
nor received aid during this examina-
tion.''
At any time a student sees another
student acting suspiciously or actually
cheating the Honor Code, it is HIS
DUTY TO SPEAK TO THE OF-
FENDING STUDENT AND ASK
HIM POLITELY TO REFRAIN
FROM ANY SUCH FUTURE PRAC-
TICE. A failure to comply with his
request should be reported to the in-
structor or TO ANY MEMBER OF
THE HONOR COMMITTEE. This is
the most difficult part of the System, for
it takes the greatest determination and
is easy prey for rationalization. Student
cooperation with the Honor Committee
is extremely vital.
The enforcement of the Honor Sys-
tem comes from the student body. Each
year, each class elects two men to the
Engineering Council, the student gov-
erning body of the school. These two
and a chairman chosen from the Coun-
cil form the Honor Committee. Meet-
ings are held when necessary to inter-
view those accused of violating the
Honor Code. After hearing both sides
of the case, a report containing the
decision and recommendations is writ-
ten and turned over to the Faculty Dis-
ciplinary Committee.
This faculty committee reviews the
case with the defendants in the presence
of at least one member of the Student
Honor Committee. These men have the
authority to mete out penalties: HOW-
EVER,' IN EVERY CASE THE
FACULTY DISCIPLINARY COM-
MITTEE HAS FOLLOWED THE
RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE
STUDENT HONOR COMMITTEE.
Y ¥ *
The reason we say the Honor System
is dead on its feet is that to the best of
our knowledge the Honor Committee
has not functioned since the summer of
1944. Freshmen and Sophomores take
proctored examinations and for the
others the Honor System is optional.
The reason given is that the cooperation
of the students was lacking. It has been
said that the influx of service men to
our college has brought a type of stu-
dent into our midst that is not capable
of living up to the responsibilities which
the Honor System places on the indi-
vidual. ,
We do not share this view. Since the
summer of 1943 we have had men of
the Navy and Marine Corps in our
classrooms and our impression is that
their honesty and integrity is compar-
able with that of the average prewar
Michigan Man.
If we engineering students are to have
our Honor System back in full force we
will have to make our wishes known.
The best way to do this is tell your
Engineering Council Representative that
you want to see some action on the
part of the Council. The Engineering
Council doesn't need to be sold on the
idea but they could certainly use some
encouragement.
This should be an excellent opportu-
nity for the Council to perform a real
service for the student body.
Student organizations and faculty
members can do their part by making
the students feel their responsibilities
under the Honor System.

electrostatic filter
Air-borne dirt has come to be recog-
nized as a major industrial problem.
Quite aside from the health hazard—
which may be serious under certain
conditions—dirt in the air definitely
interferes with production.
In some operations, such as fine as-
sembly, or the manufacture of binocu-
lars, bombsights and optical devices,
the quality of the product may be sig-
nificantly impaired by extremely
minute quantities of dust. In other
cases, as, for example in textile plants,
dust, soot or oil may cause products
to be degraded, with consequently
lower selling prices.
Sometimes the attempt is made to
reduce the concentration of dirt in the
air by ventilation alone, that is, by
diluting the air in the building with
large volumes of outside air. In most
circumstances such a system would be
prohibitively expensive because of ex-
cessive heat loss in winter and refrig-
eration loss in summer. Even then the
results would not be satisfactory, for
in the vicinity of a factory the outside
air also is liable to carry large amounts
of dust, smoke and soot.
Usually the remedy is sought in
some type of air-conditioning system
which provides equipment for cleaning
the air before it is introduced into the
system, and also for cleaning the in-
side air being recirculated. Until re-
cently mechanical filters were employed
in these systems, in spite of the known
fact that they removed only the larger
dirt particles.
A few years ago, electrostatic meth-
ods were made practicable by the de-
velopment of the Precipitron. This
device kept size, voltage, and power
requirements within reasonable limits.
The three essential parts of the Pre-
cipitron are:
1. An ionizing unit consisting of a
fine wire at high, direct current po-
tential, and two grounded electrodes.
This creates an electrostatic field in
which the particles are ionized.
2. A collector cell consisting of a
system of parallel metallic plates so
arranged that a high uniform voltage
gradient exists between each pair of
plates. As air passes between the
plates the charged particles are re-
pelled by plates having the same sign
as that of their charge, and attracted
by the plates having the opposite sign.
3. A power pack consisting of trans-
former, rectifier and capacitor to sup-

January temperature was held constant.
It took a long, sticky time, but the
viscosimeter proved once and for all
that molasses is just about the slowest
thing moving. The molasses was given
three tests, and the answer came out
5,100 centipoises, which according to
scientists is 3 minutes and 41 seconds.
A household cooking oil took 5.4
seconds, a white refrigerator lacquer
took 19.5 seconds, a black lacquer used
for painting electrical instruments ran
23 seconds, and a representative var-
nish took 28 seconds.
Molasses was also tested under ordi-
nary summer temperature, but even
then it was far from speedy—requiring
800 centipoises or 35 seconds—more
time than most of the other fluids.
The GE-Zahn viscosimeter is a small
metal cup with an orifice in its bottom.
The cup is immersed in a fluid to be
tested, then quickly removed permitting
the fluid in the cup to run out of the
orifice. Time required for the fluid to
run out provides a measure of the fluid's
viscosity or resistance to flow.
color detective
This instrument, more technically
known as the photoelectric spectropho-
tometer, plots an exact curve of the
amount of light reflected by a paint
sample. Though it can trace down any
color, the color red, a major component
of all sunlight, is the particular subject
it seeks in this application. Experience
has shown that different shades of the
same fundamental color will reflect dif-
ferent amounts of red. Two shades of
"battleship" gray, for example may
look the same to the naked eye but
prove to be quite different when seen
by the spectrophotometer. When the
gray is found that absorbs the least
red, this is the paint chosen to aid in
keeping the ship and crew cool when-
ever intense heat prevails.
The previous method of selecting
paints for ships relied on the human eye
as the final criterion. Visual selection,
however proved to be very inaccurate,
due to eye fatigue and variations in
sight. The new instrument not only
selects that paint which best reflects
sunlight but also sets a color standard
so that all paints used for the same pur-
pose will be of exactly the same shad-
ing. It may also be used in selecting
the colors of nylon hose and in the
choosing of paints for automobiles.
atomic power
The most probable utilization or
nuclear energy, the basis for the atomic
bomb, is as a source of heat. This is the
report of a group of scientists in answer
to many questions received from indus-
try and the general public alike, asking
about the potentialities of atomic power.
It has been stated that although we
can release a tremendous amount of
nuclear energy in one instantaneous
blast, at a controlled time, we must
learn to generate it and control it in a
way that is adaptable to power produc-
tion.
Most difficult to answer is the ques-
tion of the economic practicability of
the commercial use of nuclear energy.
The $2,000,000 cost of the atomic bomb
program unquestionably could be re-
duced greatly if a similar project were
to be started today based on the knowl-
edge already gained through this de-
velopment, but it would still be a very
costly undertaking.

"Didn't 4W a BH-!"
Our young FRIEND means exactly that. He wasn't hurt a
hit. And what happened to him is now the rule—not the
exception.
For today dentists—as well as physicians and surgeons —
have at their disposal main safe and effective pain pre-
ventives.
These merciful preparations fall into two types, anal-
gesics which are used to reduce pain, and anesthetics which
are used to abolish all sensation.
^ hichever type your dentist or physician decides is indi-
cated, you can know that his methods and understanding
of pain prevention represent almost incredible progress in
recent years. They are a far cry indeed from the effort of
Sir Humphry Davy, who first discovered the anesthetic
effects of nitrous oxide back in 1800.
Regardless of the type of pain preventive which mav be
selected to meet your requirements, you may be increasingly
confident of its purity and effectiveness.
For the pharmaceutical manufacturers who make anes-
thetics and analgesics now have available to them a wide
variety of scientifically produced synthetic organic chem-
icals from which to select their raw materials. The qualitv
and potency of these chemicals are of assured uniformity
because they are man-made under strict, scientific control.
And. untiring research is continually increasing the number
available for use in the prevention of pain.
Many of today's synthetic organic chemicals were developed through research by CARBIDE AND C ARSON CHEMICALS
CORPORATION. More than ll&gt;0 of these chemicals are now produced as raw materials for industry by this one Unit of UCC.
Among these are diethylethanolamine used by pharmaceutical manufacturers as an intermediate in the preparation of
novocaine so familiar to dental practice . . . acetic anhydride used in the synthesis of aspirin and other analgesics . . .
and others like ethyl ether, ethanol, dichlorethyl ether, ilimelhylethanolamine, and methyldielhanolamine, which serve
in important ways in the preparation of pain preventives,

Although medical science has long
been aware of the pharmacological
value of natural plant, animal, and min-
eral products in the treatment of dis-
ease, it was not until the twentieth cen-
tury that the chemical specificity of
these products was firmly established
as a basis for their ability to combat
pathogens. The discovery of this rela-
tionship led to further investigations to
ascertain the possibility of using com-
pletely synthetic or modified natural
substances which might be more readily
obtainable and provide more efficient
pharmacological treatment than the
natural products themselves.
In the middle of the nineteenth cen-
tury it was first discovered that meta-
bolic products of one microorganism
were in many cases definitely toxic or
at least harmful to an organism of an-
other species .although they had little
or no detrimental effect upon the par-
ent organism. However, it was not until
1922 that scientists began to fully com-
prehend the possibility of using this
principle as a valuable instrument in
fighting disease. It was in this year that
Raistrick began his investigations on
the metabolic products of molds. To
date some fifty mold products have been
isolated and their chemical constitu-
tion determined.
The chemical specificity of these
products indicated to Raistrick that
they were probably secreted by the
molds as a defense against hostile or-
ganisms, many of which were of a path-
ogenic nature. In view of this discov-
ery, further investigations were carried
on in the hope that these natural prod-
ucts of microscopic life would eventually
lead to the isolation of a new series of
chemotherapeutic agents.
In 1929 Alexander Fleming, while
carrying on investigations involving
certain pure strains of Staphylococcus
aureus, observed that one of his cul-
tures had been contaminated with a
mold from the air. He further noted
that the agar medium surrounding the
contaminating mold was quite clear and
free of staphylococci, which had appar-
ently been destroyed by a metabolic
product excreted from the mold.
Fleming immediately investigated

RICHARD A. MOCK

the mold, and after isolating it, experi-
mented with pure strains in a nutrient
broth medium. Examination of the
broth, after the mold, a species of
Penkillium, had been incubated in it
for several days, showed that it con-
tained a substance or substances pos-
sessing definite bactericidal characteris-
tics. Further experiments showed the
broth to be non-toxic and non-irritating
to animals, even when administered in
large doses.
tcrium tuberculosis, for a period of four
to six hours after administration of the
drug. However, such relief is only tem-
porary in nature, and cannot be classed
as a cure.
In war injuries, penicillin has proven
to be a major factor in the treatment
of staphylococcic infections which have
been found to occur in at least 90% of
all wounds. Burns, another source of
staphylococcic infection and eventual
blood poisoning, have been successfully

Cotuttsy YALE SCIENTIFIC MAGAZINE
This cluster of bottles contains growths of penicillin notatum, from which penicillin
is extracted.
The active constituent of the broth,
after isolation and separation from
various contaminants by methods to be
discussed below, was found to be a
powder containing about 2% moisture
and 5-\Qr/t pure penicillin. Investiga-
tions on the bactericidal properties of
penicillin powder against pathogenic
organisms showed that a given quantity
of it was much more effective than an
equal amount of any of the sulfona-
mides in combatting disease and infec-
tion from Staphylococcus, Streptococ-
cus, the dreaded Pneumococcus, and
Gram positive organisms in general.
Penicillin has been known, in some
cases, to free the blood stream of Gram
negative organisms, such as Mycobac-
treated with penicillin.
This astounding chemotherapeutic
agent has found further effective use
in swiftly ending dangers of infection
in incisions from mastoiditis surgery. A
tube stiched into the wound at the close
of the operation provides a means to
drain it with penicillin solution, thus
eliminating the weeks and months of
tedious medical dressings and gauze
drains previously needed to promote
proper healing. No treatment other
than the penicillin draining is needed to
accomplish complete healing.
The many and varied therapeutic
uses of penicillin have made it an es-
sential war material, and this strain on

ROY S. SWINTON
Associate Professor of Engineering Mechanics
Editor's Note—This article appeared in
the August-September, 1945 issue of the
MICHIGAN ENGINEER.
It is months since that unforgettable
hour when American doughboys burst
into Santo Tomas and liberated the
thousands of U. S. Civilians the Japs
imprisoned there. Millions of words
have been published on our adventures,
treatment, starvation diet and health.
Yet somehow the press has overlooked
the feature of life in Santo Tomas
which should be the source of great
pride to members of the engineering
profession—the human and effective
role which ingenious engineers played in
making those three ugly years more
bearable for all.
The Philippines, rich in raw mate-
rials, were a happy hunting ground for
engineers before the war. Mining engi-
neers were especially numerous, for the
Philippine Commonwealth produced
more than $34,669,900 in gold in 1939
and, as I recall it, stood fifth in gold
production among the countries of the
world. Other branches of the profes-
sion were equally well represented.
When an arrogant Japanese military or-
dered all American civilians into con-
finement at Santo Tomas University,
Manila, in January, 1942, a hasty in-
ventory disclosed many engineers
among our number. Time showed that
was an act of fortune for which other
civilians less accustomed to the practi-
cal use of hand and brain would always
be thankful.
From the first the engineers pitched
into the community life which was so
vital to our survival. With ruthless
thoughtlessness, the Japs allotted less
than 35 square feet of bare floor space
to each captive American. Rather than
whimper over their fate, the engineers
joined forces with former superintend-
ents and foremen. They became a corps
of carpenters, turning the scanty scrap
material available into beds, shelves,
tables, and mezzanine floors. Sheds
were roofed with galvanized iron. After
their first work had made life a little
more comfortable, they turned to more
difficult tasks. Many learned to build
with bamboo and split bamboo lath.

Roy S. Swinton
Sheds were shingled with palm leaf.
After the first year 8-penny nails could
not be purchased for less than five cents
apiece, far more than most of us could
afford to spare from our scanty hoard
of funds. Yankee ingenuity furnished
the answer—the engineers substituted
rattan for nails. It worked.
As the months passed in our prison,
it became apparent that the camp hos-
pital must procure soaps and detergents.
Several Manila universities, including
Santo Tomas, had industrial chemistry
departments. Other chemical engineers
were graduates of leading American uni-
versities. Between them, with no more
than salt, cocoanut meat and electricity
to work with, they produced an amazing
quantity of material for the hospital.
It included 1,600 kilos of cocoanut oil;
1,400 kilos of caustic soda, 7,632 kilos
of soap, 2,200 kilos of calcium hypo-
chloride, and 82 liters of alcohol.
In the all-important field of food,
engineers did their part, too. Rice was
the staple of the meager diet which the
Japs gave us—but much of it was crawl-
ing with maggots . A British and Ameri-
can engineer teamed to convert a Wulf-
ley Silt Table into a device for sifting
and cleaning rice. There were empty
hours, and it was then that men fell to
worrying over the bleak future.
The engineers met that by going to
school. A 'Science Seminar" was held
weekly during virtually the entire 37
months. Mining, mine valuation and
ore processing received the most atten-
tion, for most of the technical men were
from that industry. However, other
subjects were not forgotten. A group of
young men from Pan American Air-
ways covered meteorology. A group of
physicists, who had been sent out by
the government to degaus ships as pro-
tection against magnetic mines, took up
Prof. Coe's vector mechanics.
Two groups of more than 20 men
apiece covered a review course in
Statics and Strength of Materials, simi-
lar to that given in preparation for
State Board Examinations in Michigan.
A smaller group took the same subjects
for college credit to be presented at
M. I. T., the University of Michigan
and British universities. Four men
worked for a year on advanced me-
chanics.
Our concentration camp university
was headed for the first two years by
Dr. Rene Engel, a consultant of the
Marsman Company, which had many
mining interests. Educated in France,
he had taught at California Tech.
Note some of the lecture titles: lenses,
light, cameras, radio activity, time sam-
ples, cyclotron, color photography, me-
teorology, physical metallurgy, sound
reproduction, iron and alloys, Sulu Sea
survey, sampling ores, nomographs, and
the Pacific cable. There was a catholic
range in subjects and each man lectured
on what he knew best. Some were single
talks, others were given as a series or
seminar. Several technical articles on
earth pressures or barodynamics were in-
terpreted. Dr. Engel himself discussed
the fundamentals of colloidal chemistry.
The engineers were a hardy lot.
Their enthusiasm and the way they
kept busy did much to maintain their
spirits. In the early days, when food
was comparatively plentiful although
often unpalatable, most of them main-
tained their full energy. Then the
starvation diet was forced upon us. Our

aero prof
A new arrival in the Department of
Aeronautical Engineering is Professor
Emerson W. Conlon. Perhaps it would
be more accurate to say ''old friend"
for Professor Conlon has been on a
leave of absence since January 1942
when he left Ann Arbor to give the
Navy the benefit of his talent and ex-
perience. We take pleasure in reporting
that Professor Conlon is resuming his
position as Chairman of the Depart-
ment of Aeronautical Engineering.

Emerson W. Conlon
Professor Conlon received his degree
in Aeronautical Engineering at M. I. T.
in 1929. He is an Associate Fellow in
the Institute of the Aeronautical Sci-
ences, and also is a member of the
XACA Subcommittee on Aircraft Struc-
tures.
We at Michigan are indeed fortunate
to have had a faculty member partici-
pate so actively in the development of
air power during the late war when so
many vital problems in Aeronautics were
under consideration. As a Commander
in the Navy, Professor Conlon's efforts
initially were concentrated on experi-
mental structures. At Washington he
was in charge of the Structural Devel-
opment Section of the Bureau of Aero-
nautics. Much of his time was devoted
to "trouble shooting," ironing out the
structural failures in the Navy's first-
line aircraft such as the Hellcat.
Although much of the work done at
the Bureau cannot be revealed he de-
scribed how failures of the tail experi-
enced in high speed dives were repro-
duced and studied while the plane was
on the ground. This procedure was of
extreme importance because it was the
quickest way of obtaining a satisfactory
'"fix." The extreme hazard to both the
pilot and the experimental airplane
tended to make everyone ultra-cautious
and delays occurred when other pro-
cedures were used which could not be
tolerated in the time of war. The pro-
cedure consisted of recording on an
oscillograph the time history of the
stresses, amplitudes and frequencies in
the critical structure in a flight condi-
tion at or near that which produced
failure. A second airplane was then
set up in the laboratory with duplicate
instrumentation and arbitrary external
dynamic loads were applied until the
oscillograph records were duplicated and
the failure obtained in flight duplicated.
It was a simple matter then to try dif-
ferent types of re-enforcements until a
satisfactory change had been obtained.
This work necessitated the development
of many new methods of instrumenta-
tion, such as the transmission of the
intelligence by a radio link which per-
mitted the oscillograph to remain on the
ground and therefore preserved the
record even though the airplane were
lost. The philosophy of controlled fail-
ures in aircraft structures was also de-
veloped. Since, under combat conditions
it was often necessary for the pilot to
exceed the yield strength of the air-
plane, common sense dictated that the
weakest section in each component of
the airplane should be so located that
a failure resulted in minimum hazard to
the pilot, and if the airplane was un-
able to return to its base the pilot had
ample opportunity to bail out.
One of the most progressive members
of a clan noted for being broadminded
Professor Conlon says he has ceased to
call any idea in this field ridiculous be-
cause almost anything can and does
happen. His progressive views are not
confined to Aeronautics, he believes
the proposed plan to liberalize the En-
gineering Curriculum is most commend-
able. He says that many engineers will
find themselves in executive positions,
making decisions not necessarily related
to engineering, and will find a broad
background most desirable.
This semester Professor Conlon is
teaching advanced as well as more fun-
damental courses in aircraft structures.
With regard to Aeronautical Engineer-
ing here at Michigan, he plans to con-
centrate on filling in the gap between
the theoretical considerations in Aero-
dynamics and Structures and the actual
design of the elements of an airplane.
Good news for those who are in-
trigued by super-sonic flight is his state-
ment, "I see no limit in the future to
the speed of aircraft."

transformer testing
Power transformers built by Westing-
house now receive an impulse test as a
matter of production routine for qual-
ity control. A 3,600,000-volt impulse-
generator station has been installed in
the production aisle so that power trans-
formers following assembly can be given
impulse tests that prove the adequacy
of their design and workmanship and
determine the ability of the transform-
ers to withstand lightning surges. Be-
cause the surge generator test station
is located as part of the assembly floor.
it is unnecessary to move the trans-
formers to the high voltage laboratory
as heretofore. This greatly shortens the
time required to make an impulse test,
and permits testing each transformer
under cover so that all conditions can
be carefully observed. The impulse-
generator, built especially for routine
impulse testing of power transformers,
is designed for rapid operation, with the
flexibility required to subject trans-
formers of various ratings to the im-
pulses appropriate for their voltage
classes.

This lead-to-lead fault developed on the
full-wave impulse.
With this procedure applied to power
transformers, impulse testing becomes a
quality control instead of just a means
of satisfying the designer or the user as
to impulse strength in the case of se-
lected units. The particular tests pre-
scribed as routine are considered fully
as rigorous as any test now applied to
power transformers and hence often
made unnecessary the special impulse
test sometimes required by purchasers.
The quality-control test for power
transformers consists of applying to
each unit two front-of-wave (i.e., steep
front) impulses followed by two full-
wave impulses with normal excitation at
power voltage. The steep-front wave
used rises at the rate of 1000 kv per
microsecond. For a particular transform-
er under test this wave is allowed to reach
the peak voltage specified by the ten-
tative NEMA standard for a unit of
that voltage rating. The full-wave im-
pulses correspond, within practical
limits, to the crest-voltage levels and
40-microsecond duration set by ASA as
a standard.
The front-of-wave impulse provide a
check if the insulation at the line end
of the transformer and in adjacent
parts. These steeply rising waves cor-
respond to the effect of direct or almost
direct lightning strokes that highly
stress the turn nearest the incoming
line. These waves, however, do not
penetrate throughout the transformer
windings. The full-wave gives an over-
all test to the entire windings, inasmuch
as the long duration of the wave per-
mits it to check the adequacy of the
insulation deep in all parts of the wind-
ings. In combination with power excita-
tion the full waves provide an effective
method for detection of the faults
throughout the windings. This combi-

production, coupled with the large
civilian consumption of the drug, has
made it practically unavailable for all
but the most essential of needs. This
difficulty in supplying sufficient peni-
cillin to meet the requirements of a
world at war may be readily under-
stood when one realizes twenty liters
of nutrient broth are required to obtain
one gram of the active ingredient. Fur-
thermore, the difficulties in obtaining
a product of high purity and containing
a sufficient percentage of active peni-
cillin for clinical use are numerous, and
techniques requiring considerable time
and expense are essential for the suc-
cessful processing of the nutrient broth
and proper culturing of the mold.
Preparation of pure samples of the
active chemical constituent of penicil-
lin powder for the determination of the
molecular and structural formulas of
the compound has been a laborious and
exacting task assigned to the organic
chemist. Because of the inaccessibility
of the material, this work has been made
still more tedious by the necessary in-
troduction of chemical microtechniques.
In order to synthesize penicillin or
a modified substitute in the laboratory
and eventually in industry on a large
scale, such analytical information is es-
sential, and must be obtained before
further research in the problem can be
begun.
Production of penicillin by extraction
of the material from nutrient broth with
which the mold Penkillium notatum
had been incubated was first begun on
a large scale in this country under the
supervision of Florey and Heatley, two
Englishmen who had devised a method
for assaying the active constituent in
the broth and had supervised small
production laboratories in Oxford.
Among the first organizations to begin
commercial production were Merck &amp;
Co., Lederle Laboratories, Inc., E. R.
Squibb &amp; Sons, and Chas. Pfizer &amp; Co.,
Inc.
The most important factor in obtain-
ing high yields in penicillin production
is the capacity of the various strains
of P. notatum for formation of the ac-
tive metabolic product. These strains
are usually discovered by parallel test-
ing in media suitable for penicillin pro-
duction. Once isolated, care must be
taken that these active strains do not
lose their ability to form the drug.

by the formation of white cottony
patches which gradually spread over
the culture surface. Loss of potency is
also noted in cultures after continued
successive transfers on artificial media.
This practice is conducive to degener-
ation of microorganisms in general.
Spontaneous degeneration of this na-
ture is avoided in both laboratory and
industrial production by mixing an
aqueous suspension of the spores with
lyophilized soil or sterile sand. This
master culture is then dried and may be
kept for an indefinite period in a re-
frigerator.

The mold which produces penicillin.
Subculturing for manufacturing pur-
poses is reduced to a minimum of vege-
tative transfers to avoid danger of de-
generation. Petri dishes containing
Sabourand's solid agar medium are in-
noculated with loopfuls of the master
soilspore culture and are incubated for
four to six days, after which time an
abundance of grass-green spores result.
These spores are in turn injected into
Roux or Blake bottles containing a
suitable liquid medium, from which the
penicillin is eventually harvested.
At present industrial production is
confined to two methods known as the
''deep method" and the "shallow or
surface method." Similar difficulties
are encountered in each, but the deep
method is advantageous in that it pro-
duces penicillin in much larger quanti-
ties over a given period of time than
the shallow method. Perhaps the great-
est handicap to large scale production
exists in the fact that only minute
amounts of penicillin are formed in the
metabolism of the mold, and these small
amounts result only after one to two
weeks of incubation.
The nutrient medium must be pure
and free from contamination by foreign
bacteria and molds. Such contamination
during the growth period destroys peni-
cillin already formed and prevents its
further formation. Furthermore, if im-
purities are impregnated into the broth
during the processing period, the prod-
uct tends to deteriorate and will lose
its activity in a short time. Conse-
quently, absolutely sterile conditions
must be maintained throughout all
stages of production.
In the deep method of production,
tanks ranging from 500 to 6,000 gal-
lons in size are used. These tanks are
generally glass or porcelain lined and
are thermostatically controlled to main-
tain a temperature of 24° C, the opti-
mum growth temperature of P. nota-
tum. As the mold is an aerobic micro-
organism, these tanks are equipped with
pipe systems to allow sterile air to bub-
ble freely through the liquid medium,
so as to ensure growth throughout the
entire tank rather than at the surface
alone. In this method as in the surface
method, the acidity of the broth must
be maintained at pH of 7.0-8.S.
Glass or ceramic flat bottles and
flasks are used in the surface method
of penicillin production. In this process
the medium is sterilized directly in the
flasks, after which they are innoculated
and laid flat in storage rooms main-
tained at a temperature of 24° C. The
same oxygen tension, acidity, and tem-
perature conditions are maintained here
as in the deep method. After the growth
period the product is harvested by
withdrawing the medium from under
the mold mycelium, and replacing it
immediately with new medium. The
next crop of penicillin forms in about
half the time needed for initial produc-
tion.
As has been before mentioned, a
growth period of seven to fourteen days
at 24° C. is essential for a high yield
of penicillin. Fleming found in original
experiments that the mold cannot grow
above 37° C. In the initial stages of
growth, the spores float on the surface
of the medium in white flocculent
patches, which soon cover the entire
surface with a thin layer (pH 6.0-7.0).

# Fearful of being "too late with too
little," American industry won its race
against time. Quantity and quality sur-
passed the hopes of all but the most
courageous and progressive.
One of the contributing factors to vic-
tory was the general advancement in
mechanical materials-handling, and
most particularly in routing materials in
process through successive stages of manu-
facture. Substantial savings in manpower,
time and costs accrued. Production con-
sistently increased, meriting a steady flow
of "E" awards.
Lamson Conveyors, through many in-

CHNIC
FLECTS
Editors' note, the policy of the
MICHIGAN TECHNIC has been to
reflect in true perspective any and all
aspects of the Engineering College.
Consequently, Miss McHigan has been
given the following space in which to
air her views. We suggest that her
message be taken with a grain of salt,
perhaps two.
* * *
Enough of this foolish joke-cracking
about the female engineer! Let's have
a few comments on the average male
engineer for a change.
Scene: The halls of engine school.
Time: Any change of classes.
Down the hall comes a typical speci-
men of the civilian Michigan engineer.
His slide rule swinging from his belt, he
presents quite a picture. The appear-
ance of his hair makes it quite obvious
that he is in dire need of either a violin,
a dog license, or a haircut. Very charm-
ing, to say the least! That sweater
he is wearing practically screams out
for a visit to one of the local cleaning
establishments. And his trousers! Well,
there's nothing wrong with them that
a good ironing won't cure. To top off
this simply ravishing appearance, it is
apparent that he really had a tough
problem to work last night; he stayed
up so late that he just couldn't get up
early enough this morning in order to
have time to shave. All in all, he really
looks startling!

Now, every male engineer is sure that
he is really a "sharp character." To
begin, let us define a "sharp character."
He is one who is a neat dresser, a
smooooth dancer, is fairly "smart," has
a clever line of chatter, and is versatile.
The first point, in relation to the Michi-
gan engineer, we have already discussed.
Now let us go on to the "smooooth
dancer" part of the definition, which of
course is only a small portion of the
topic "Social Life."
Many engineers lead a one-sided so-
cial life; they disgustedly refer to danc-
ing as a "foolish waste of time." If
they do struggle out to a dance floor,
they step on their partner's feet, and
find even the simple two-step an unsur-
passable difficulty. Very annoying to a
girl to find this out when she arrives at
the Slide Rule Ball (plug). The rest
of the social life of the Michigan engi-
neer in Ann Arbor centers around three
things only: BEER! BEER! and
BEER!! He is not too particular in
choosing from the Bell, the Old German,
Flautz', the Sugar Bowl, or Metzgers,
but usually you will find him at Ye Olde
&amp;

P-Bell. And what is his conduct at this
time-honored establishment?
As soon as he has made his entrance
and displayed his forged ident card, he
spies "that fellow who was in my E. M.
2 class three semesters ago," and shouts
at the top of his lungs, 'Hi, Zeke!"
This, of course, attracts the attention
of everyone present. Naturally, this was
the desired result, attracting attention
to himself! After stumbling over many
people, he finally manages to find a
place to sit. He noisily orders three
or four pitchers of beer, loudly exclaim-
ing about how much beer he can hold.
After the first few glasses, he begins
to display his vocal powers, booming
out such songs as 'St. Patrick Was An
Engineer" and "Samuel Hall." You
can be sure that when someone gets the
'bell," it's an engineer. Soon after his
singing spree, his remarks fall into a
vein, the gist of which I shall not repeat
here. If he should, by any chance, have
a date, she is usually most emabrrassed,
and at this point finds someone else
to take her home. At any rate, by the
end of the evening, he usually has to
be rolled home, or worse yet, carried.
And so ends an engineer's evening at
the Bell.
As far as being 'fairly smart," we
will give this point to the engineer. We
think enough of our engine school to
give him the benefit of the doubt in
this case.

Now let us discuss the "line of chat-
ter" of this typical engineer, and the
manner in which he expresses himself.
Despite the valiant attempts of our
brave Engine English Department, his
grammar is, in many cases, (and I un-
derstate) atrocious. Sometimes I think
that he ought to have an interpreter
tagging along with him. There are many
theories as to the cause of this sad sit-
uation. A large number of people in-
sist that at least one-half of the fellows
who enroll in engine school do so be-
cause they dislike English, not because
they like engineering! Still others main-
tain that it is an anti-climax of the
insistence of various engineering profs
that the members of their classes speak
absolutely perfect English. These peo-
ple contend that the strain of stating
every formula in a sentence which is
structurally correct is too much for the
poor student.
And if he does manage to get some-
thing intelligible said, just what does
he give out with? Clever remarks?
Humor? A good line to hand his girl?
Oh, no, not the Michigan engineer!
His remarks should be sent back to the
cornfield! But definitely! 'Nuff sed!
Now, as to the versatility of our en-
gineer. What does he know besides
engineering? (or does he even know
that?) Art? Music? Books? Let us
analyze this situation with actual rele-
vant cases. Only the other day, I heard
someone advising a "Log-log Larry,"
"No, no! Rembrandt didn't originate
the drawings of Barnaby!"

In other industrial fields, A-C en-
gineering has been equally alert.
To balance and control power ac-
curately for special steel mill opera-
tions, we developed the "Regulex"
Exciter Set, above.
The "Regulex" Control helps speed
output of steel wire for bridge
cables . . . regulates electrode posi-
tion in electric furnaces—means
extra "heats," more special alloy
steel for peacetime use!
Wherever chemicals are processed
for drugs, plastics, synthetic rub-
ber, you're apt to find other im-
portant A-C developments at work
—special pumps, sifters, scrubbers
and rotary kilns.

The same is true of the mining and
cement making fields. We outfit en-
tire processing plants — make the
world's most complete line of crush-
ers, grinders, screens and other
basic industry equipment.
Our new techniques, learned in war,
will work for better peacetime liv-
ing! Postwar homes, cars, food,
clothing—all will be made faster,
cheaper and better thanks to A-C
"know-how" in many fields.

control test differs from the ASA im-
pulse test in that two steep-front waves
of 140 percent of the chopped-wave
crest value are substituted for two
chopped-waves of 115 percent of full
wave crest value, and two full-wave im-
pulses are used instead of one.
The front-of-wave and full-wave im-
pulses for power transformers have been
chosen on the basis of a large volume
of impulse-testing experience. Of the
power transformers tested from 1939
to 1944, about 80 percent received the
ASA test (two chopped waves and one
full wave), and the other 20 percent
received, in addition to the ASA test,
a front wave test. Of the total faults
that were discovered, 19 percent were
developed by the front wave test. Sixty-
five percent resulted from the applica-
tion of the full wave. The remaining
16 percent first appeared on the chopped
wave, in part, because the chopped im-
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued jrom page 14)
pulses preceded the full wave in the
ASA test. Had the full wave test pre-
ceded the chopped wave test, a number
of these faults would have been de-
veloped on the full wave . Furthermore,
if the transformers that received the
ASA test had in addition the front wave
test, experience shows that all of the
faults would have been accounted for
by the front-of-wave and the full-wave
tests alone. This led to the conclusion
that the front-of-wave and the full-
wave impulses are the all important im-
pulses to combine in a quality-control
test. The chopped wave adds little or
nothing to the adequacy of testing cov-
ered by the combination of the front-
of-wave and full-wave impulses be-
cause the steep front and the full wave
reveal any fault that the chopped wave
indicates.
The possibility that impulse testing
might itself introduce insulation weak-
ness was considered in the earlv davs
s &gt;
of impulse testing. Some believed that
impulse testing might constitute more
of a hazard than serve a useful purpose,
this in spite of the unquestioned accept-
ance of the long-standard, low-fre-
quency dielectric-strength test. Such
fears have proved to be groundless.
Many transformers have been life tested
by subjecting them to groups of about
a hundred steep-wave and full-wave
tests, each group being followed suc-
cessively by another of higher voltage.
At intervals the transformers were dis-
mantled for examination. In no case
did a careful examination of the dis-
assembled transformer disclose a weak-
ness if the many applications of im-
pulses indicated none. On the other
hand, with few exceptions, when failure
was indicated by test, the faults were
located on disassembly of the trans-
formers. In the few exceptions the
faults were minor. In almost all cases
where faults were detected by the im-
pulse test, the transformer passed the
low-frequency AIEE tests. The life
tests have also disclosed that if failure
occurs at all it takes place within the
first few tests at a given voltage level.
Continued impulse testing at that volt-
age level does not produce failure.
The manner of detecting faults is im-
portant in impulse testing. Fifty per-
cent of the faults were indicated on
cathode-ray oscillograms. Smoke and
bubbles were observed in 90 percent of
the faults.
(Continued on page 30)
Left, a coil duct had been damaged
when winding and core assembly was
lowered into the tank. Fault was de-
tected on full-wave impulse, and also
by the disturbance produced from
power-follow current. Right, a turn-to-
turn insulation failure developed on
front-of-wave impulses. Subsequent
full-wave tests and power follow devel-
oped fault more fully. Below, these
oscillograms show the two steep-front
and two full-wave impulses applied to
the 115-kv transformers shown on
page 14.

HEADS GOT TOGETHER
RESULT: MORE TRANSCONTINENTAL TELEPHONE CIRCUITS
With wire scarce and wartime calls
increasing, telephone engineers made
existing pairs of long distance wires
carry nearly four times as many calls as
before. This was done through installa-
tion of additional carrier equipment,
requiring closer spacing of the wires on
the line and transpositions at shorter
intervals.
Three pairs on the Southern Trans-
continental Route were rearranged, and
in a 430-mile section this had to be done
while keeping the urgently needed wires
in service all the time. To do this, new
tools and new methods had to be de-
vised in the laboratories and on the job.
This is another among many examples
of how Bell System teamwork and en-
gineering skills maintained telephone
service under wartime conditions.

_ The story of Radar—the magic beam that enabled
the United States Navy to sink a Jap battleship
eight miles away at night . . . that helped save
C **£ England in her darkest hours by detecting enemy
planes . . . that automatically aims guns and detects
submarines . . . this whole story is now officially released.
RCA takes this opportunity to congratulate the Office of
Scientific Research and Development, the Army and Navy re-
search laboratories and all other elements of the radio industry
for their splendid work in so perfecting Radar that it became
one of our most powerful weapons in winning the war.
Radar's contributions in peacetime will be equally as great ... in
making private and commercial flying even safer ... in detecting
obstacles at sea . . . and in hundreds of other ways yet to be discovered.
As for our part in this great effort, we here list the major developments in Radar made by RCA
1932—RCA Laboratories originated micro-wave equipment,
which later was used in successful radar experiments.
1934—Echoes were obtained with micro-wave equipment
set up near Sandy Hook. This experiment showed for the
first time the potentialities of micro-wave radar.
193S—An experimental micro-wave pulse radar system was
developed by RCA Laboratories. It was demonsttated to the
Army and Navy in 1936.
1936 —A lower frequency high power radar wa« supplied la
the Army by RCA.
1937—RCA micro-wave radar was used to scan the Phila-
delphia skyline with cathode ray indication essentially the
same used in today's newest radar sets.
1937—RCA developed an airborne pulse radar. This equip-
ment operated very satisfactorily for detecting obstacles such
as mountains, and was also invaluable as an altimeter. It
was demonstrated to the Army and Navy in 1937, and at
their request was classified as "secret."
1933—RCA started development of a practical altimeter
employing FM principles. This and the RCA pulse altimeter
later became standard equipment for the Army, Navy, and
the British. A large quantity of altimeters of these types have
been manufactured for controlling the height of paratroop
planes at the time of jumping, for use in bombing enemy
ships, and for other military purposes.
1938-9—RCA Victor manufactured the first radar equipment
purchased by the Navy.
1939-40—Twenty high-power sets, based on the Navy's
design, were developed and installed by RCA Victor in the
Navy's important vessels.
1940—RCA developed and built radar apparatus which was
especially suited for use on destroyers, and apparatus de-
signed especially for submarines. These equipments were
among the earliest procured by the Navy, and have proved
very successful.
1940—Experience in the manufacture of vacuum tubes
made it possible for RCA Victor to be the first and only
manufacturer in the United States to produce a radar tube
developed in England. RCA also produces many other types
of radar tubes, including the cathode ray tubes of which RCA
is largest manufacturer in the world. RCA's unchallenged
leadership in cathode ray tubes for radar was made possible
by extensive developments in television, since television, too,
requires high quality cathode ray tubes.
1941—RCA Victor supplied receivers and indicators for the
type of radar then used by the Army.
1942—Loran, a system of long-range navigation, was manu-
factured by several firms, but difficulties were encountered
because of size and weight of the receiver. In 1942 RCA
Laboratories undertook the design of a simplified, compact
receiver, and achieved such success that large quantities were
ordered from RCA Victor and from other firms instructed
in RCA's design, and other types were discontinued.
Some of RCA developments are of major importance in de-
velopments of other concerns engaged in radar manufacture.
RCA gave complete design and instruction to other firms
in altimeters, tail warning devices, bombing devices, tubes,
Loran receivers and other radar equipment designed and
developed by RCA.
Several hundred RCA specialists were abroad during the
war servicing radar and communication services for Army and
Navy equipment made by RCA and other firms.
RCA was represented on the National Defense Research
Committee and on other government technical committees
on war activities.
RCA engineers have been loaned to government labora-
tories for special radar projects.
RCA has co-operated with England in radar projects.

As the mycelium forms, the medium be-
comes strongly acidic, often having a
pH as low as 3.0. After about a week
of growth green spores begin to appear,
and the pellicle begins to wrinkle. At
this stage chrysogenin. a yellow pig-
ment, and penicillin are excreted into
the medium, whose pH has risen once
again to 6.0. From the time immedi-
ately following the wrinkling of the
pellicle up to the fourteenth day of
growth the maximum portion of peni-
cillin is formed in the broth, and the
pH of the system rises slowly to 8.8.
Further growth results only in deteri-
oration of the penicillin, and hence the
broth crops should be harvested at this
point.
American workers in general have
found the most effective medium for
growth is the standard Czepak nutrient
broth modified by using lactose for a
carbon source along with corn steep
liquor, rather than glucose or brown
sugar. It has been observed that this
broth tends to produce a slower rise
in pH throughout the growth period,
thus increasing the yield of active peni-
(Continued jrom page 16)
cillin. Too rapid a rise in pH during
growth causes deterioration of the
product. Lactose broth medium also
minimizes gluconic acid formation from
glucose, a reaction catalyzed by penicil-
lin. A high concentration of glucose
or any other easily oxidized sugar in
the medium will cause acid formation
to such an extent that the necessary
slow rise in pH to 8.8 for an optimum
yield will be completely blocked.
Traces of heavy metals in the nu-
trient broth produce a decided effect on
the growth and metabolism of P. nota-
tum. The most important of these are
zinc, copper, iron, and manganese. It
was found that 1-3 mg. of zinc sulfate
heptahydrate per liter of medium
caused a marked increase in the growth
rate of the mold. However, higher
concentrations were found to have a
detrimental effect on penicillin forma-
tion. Some zinc is absolutely essential
to growth, as it catalyzes complete ox-
idation and utilization of the carbon
source by the mold, thus preventing
glyconic acid formation, and subse-
quent lowering of the pH of the med-
ium.

After the nutrient broth is harvested,
it is assayed to be sure that it was col-
lected at the peak of penicillin accumu-
lation. It is then filtered free of mold,
and the solution is acidified with phos-
phoric acid. An organic layer separates
out, which is extracted with amyl ace-
tate, and shaken with water or phos-
phate buffer to bring the pH back to
5-7. This first extraction must be done
with extreme rapidity, as the penicillin
is quickly decomposed in acid solution.
Penicillin remains stable for several
days in the organic solvent.
In 1943 Tsun T'ung reported a pro-
cedure whereby the crude penicillin
substrate can be concentrated with a
considerable increase in the potency of
the active principle. He further found
that after an initial drip, the liter of the
concentrated medium remains constant
for as long as six months, if it is stored
in a dry ice cabinet.
A second extraction of the nutrient
medium is made with amyl acetate, and
ether, and the extraction product is
treated with a mixture of barium and
calcium hydroxides and calcium car-
bonate. It is then centrifuged to break
the resulting amyl acetate-water emul-
sion. The penicillin is then removed
from the organic solvent by concentra-
tion and is taken up in pyrogen-free
water. The resulting orange-red solu-
tion is relatively stable, and can be
stored in the refrigerator. Lyophiliza-
tion gives a yellow powder containing
5-10% penicillin, from which various
metallic salts can be made.
However, despite the amazing prog-
ress which has been made in producing
penicillin during the past few years, it
is of the utmost importance that scien-
tists, manufacturers, and especially the
general public realize that the product
being placed on the market for world
consumption is painfully inadequate.
We must all comprehend that the sup-
ply of penicillin is of necessity ham-
pered by the high expense and great
difficulties encountered in the best of
the present production methods. And
it will not be until further research
unfolds newer and more satisfacton'
ways for its manufacture from either
natural or synthetic processes in larger
quantities and higher states of purity
that the beneficial results from penicil-
lin treatment of disease and infection
will be realized to the maximum possi-
ble extent by the people of the world.

man's diet. Men lost an average of SO
pounds, 25 of them in the terrible six
months before our rescue. Active men,
having lost all fat, deteriorated rapidly
as they continued to expend energy.
Feet would swell and hearts quit. The
death rate in January, 1945, was five
times that of January, 1944. A Dr.
Stevenson, formerly at Ishpeming with
the Cleveland Cliffs Corp., bluntly wrote
"starvation" on the death certificates.
The Japanese ordered him to stop. He
refused and was thrown into special
confinement on January 31. By that
time everyone—even the engineers, was
losing energy and finding it difficult to
go on.
Then, on Feb. 3, the 1st Dismounted
Cavalry Division broke through to
Santo Tomas. All was confusion. For
a day the Japs sought to take refuge
by mixing with internees in the educa-
tion building. Just after daylight one
Jap peeked through the concrete grill
of the balcony and asked: ''Americans?"
When we gleefully answered "yes," he
asked: "American-tanks?" Again we re-
plied affirmatively. The Jap stared
(Continued from page 12)
straight ahead for a moment. Then he
walked over to the corner and killed
himself.
Cut off from the world for three years
as we had been, our last memories of
the American Army were of the gallant
but beaten men who fell back to Ba-
taan. But this was a new and mighty
Army. It impressed all of us what a
magnificent engineering job had been
done back in the United States to equip
it. It was the little things which struck
us. A shell came into camp and "walkie
talkie" operators started out to locate
its source. In 1941 there had been
nothing like that. Then a gunfire di-
rector a mile away told a gunner three
miles distant the size of the shell, alti-
tude and the azimuth to fire in order
to knock out a Jap field piece four miles
away. It was the science of war. To us
it was a miracle. America had not merely
fulfilled its pledge to rescue us—it had
welded a fighting machine which struck
us as something out of an "Amazing
Stories1' magazine.
Looking back over those 37 months
now that we are free again, there is
one thing which strikes me. They call
Manila the city where everyone takes in
someone else's washing. It was a city
of commerce and at first business men
sought to assume governing powers
within the camp. Most of us thought
they played favorites. Certainly the
results were unsatisfactory. Soon an
election became a real necessity. It was
held—and many of those chosen were
engineers. Loyalty, commendation and
satisfaction in service and pleasant as-
sociation were their only reward aside
from a food bonus—one extra scoop
of rice daily—for those engaged in
heavy labor.
Life resolves itself into a socialistic
society when all eat the same ration and
labor depends upon voluntary co-opera-
tion. The camp was a great equalizer.
The final regard in which one was held
depended on one's social attitude in
essential matters rather than on wealth
or one's previous position in life. Engi-
neers, accustomed to serving others with
ingenuity and skill, held a high place
in Santo Tomas society. Their skill and
ingenuity made it easier for all to live.
One was proud to be a member of the
engineering profession.

ALL credit to steel, a staunch and strong building
material! It's worthy of the best protection you
can give it —and the U. S. Bureau of Standards says
ZINC is "by far the best protective metallic coating
for rust-proofing iron and steel"... So long as steel is
coated with zinc, it can not rust; and since the life of
a zinc coating is at least proportional to its thickness,
the heavier the coating, the longer it will protect
the underlying steel.
£%&amp;sl
SM&gt;a\eriaI!

aintenance! ... witk ZINC
It is sound sense and simple economy to use zinc wher-
ever possible for the protection of iron and steel—in
buildings, in equipment, in machinery. Good design
that includes zinc-protected steel will cut costs, not
only in the original saving of material but also in sub-
sequent maintenance. Heavy zinc coatings insure
greater durability and longer service life — that is a
demonstrated scientific fact; so for economy, specify
heavy coatings. They cost but little more, yet pay
enormous dividends in greatly increased durability
and reduced maintenance costs.

(Continued from page 22)
Records were also taken with the
magnetic oscillograph, but this disclosed
so few faults not shown by the cathode-
ray oscillograph and by visual inspec-
tion that this extra complication is not
considered justified in the quality-con-
trol test set-up. All impulses in the
quality-control tests are recorded on
cathode-ray oscillograms.
In designing the impulse generator
the aim throughout has been to facili-
tate production and expedite testing, all
in keeping with good practices in testing
and safety. To this end, operations of
the impulse generator and in the test-
ing have been mechanized wherever
possible. For example, the setting of
the series gaps is done automatically
through a motor-driven gear mechanism
and adjustments are rapidly made from
the operating room by suitable remote-
control indicator. In this manner the
operator can adjust the generated volt-
age automatically in a few seconds, in
fact, during the charging of the genera-
tor from one test to the other. The
charging equipment is liberally built to
charge the generator to full voltage in
IS seconds if required. The discharge
operation of the generator is all auto-
matic. It is synchronized with the
cathode-ray oscillograph and is provided
with features that insure positive dis-
charge operation. A relay in the oper-
ating room enables repetitive applica-
tions of impulse voltage in case such
be required for life testing.
kova r—
Designed specifically for certain dis-
tinctive tasks, a new alloy has been
developed which enables permanent
glass-to-metal joints to be made easily,
quickly, and economically. Called
Kovar, this recent engineering accom-
plishment has found many important
uses in the production of radio, radar,
and other electronic equipment.
Many modern electrical devices
function within air-tight enclosures,
either in a vacuum or in a particular gas
or vapor. This may be necessary for
the successful operation of an electrical
device or for the purpose of sealing
vital elements of a mechanism from the
harmful effects of dirt and moisture.
Lamps, radio tubes, ignitron tubes, x-
ray tubes, refrigerators, transformers,
and meters are equipment which require
sealed enclosures around some of their
parts. Small electrical transformers and
delicate electrical instruments function
better when operating in a vacuum.
In all these enclosures of electrica
apparatus, one feature is in common
Current must be supplied into and ou
of the enclosures, and the lead wires
must be electrically insulated withou
giving up the necessary degree of tight
ness. Glass is a satisfactory insulating
material, since it is gas-tight, but to be
successfully used it must make a vac
uum-tight seal with metal. Also, fo
lamps, photoelectric cells, and observa
tion windows, it has the added usefu
characteristic of being transparent.
The most difficult factors, however
in sealing metal to glass are the un
equal rates of expansion of the two
substances. Glass is brittle, and cracks
when highly stressed. Certain glasse
have a low coefficient of expansion
which is matched only by the expensive
unalloyed metals, tungsten and molyb
denum. These two metals provide a sat
isfactory seal, but the excessive cost o
the seals prohibits extensive use o
these materials.

Consequently, it was necessary to

hard glass is matched with great preci-
sion. Consequently, Kovar-seals are
applicable in a large range of sizes.
Kovar has a high electrical resistivity
(45 michroms per cm.) and is ferro-
magnetic, having approximately the
same magnetic properties as annealed
low-carbon steel. It is more resistant to
corrosion than ordinary steel but is in-
ferior to stainless steel in this respect.
However, this deficiency has not yet
limited its usefulness in applications
involving corrosion. Also, it can be
joined to other metals by brazing, sol-
dering, or welding. The unique quality
of the seal between Kovar and glass is
the chemical bond which they form.
The joint to be sealed is heated, and
the surface oxide formed on the Kovar
part is dissolved into the glass. This
forms a perfect hermetic seal, perma-
nently vacuum and pressure tight under
all climatic conditions. The process is
very simple. The part to be sealed is
designed to prevent sharp corners at
points to be sealed. The Kovar part
is annealed in a decarburizing atmos-
phere to remove the effects of cold work
and to eliminate residual carbon at and
near the surface. The part is then
brought to a dull-red heat in an oxidiz-
ing atmosphere until a thin adherent
oxide film is obtained. Molten glass
may then be applied immediately or
the part may be reheated for sealing in
a separate operation.
In military operations, equipment
must function under adverse conditions.
Large temperature ranges, high humid-
ity, insects, and fungi rapidly deterio-
rate such equipment as communication
and range-finding apparatus. Protec-
tion against these influences was ob-
tained with total enclosures using
Kovar-glass seals for leads for trans-
formers, resistors, capacitors, con-
densers, vibrators, switches, receivers,
transmitters, and various other electri-
cal components. When this adequate
protection was given to sensitive instru-
ments, their performance improved.
In the instrument and gauge field, the
use of Kovar-glass sight tubes and in-
dex glasses proves ideal for sealing
mechanisms under pressure and where
visual means for reading operational
data must be provided.

Matching tubes
to jobs ...


One of the major ways B&amp;W can serve
you in your engineering career is in
matching steel tubes to jobs — to such
diversified applications as stationary,
locomotive and marine boilers; to high
pressure high temperature services in re-
fineries, synthetic rubber plants and other
chemical processes.
Since B&amp;W became the first boiler manu-
facturer to make its own tubes, nearly
40 years ago, it has produced enough
pressure tubing — both seamless and
welded — to wrap almost 6 times around
the Earth. In addition, B&amp;W has produced
vast quantities of mechon/cal tubing, of
both kinds, for machined parts and struc-
tural purposes.
Two specialty tube mills are operated
by B&amp;W today, with extensive physical,
chemical and metallurgical laboratories
for manufacturing control and continuity
research.
8&amp;W's past experience, plus present
research, make B&amp;W the name to watch
for future tube developments.

"SHOOTING THE BREEZE" may be a matter of stirring

In either operation, there is mechanical motion at
high speed — with a need for anti-friction bearings,
carefully designed for a specific task.
Different loads, speeds and other factors require
bearings of different kinds. Therefore, S5CS[F makes
both ball and roller bearings — from small ones for
tiny motors and appliances up to huge bearings used
in the largest motors and locomotives.
Because so many SBCSfF1 bearings have gone into
fighting ships, tanks, planes and other war equip-

activities until he was sure that they
would not seriously interfere with his

Chairman of the Slide Rule Ball Com-

this campus for one of the most popu-
lar dances of the year. While putting
in many hours on these activities, he
maintained his high scholastic record
which resulted in his being elected to
Tau Beta Pi as well as Phi Kappa Phi.
John was also an active member of

At the twenty-fourth annual ECMA
convention, held October 26 and 27 at
Columbus, Ohio, your MICHIGAN
TECHNIC received four awards from
the Engineering College Magazines,
Associated.
The convention was held in the tra-
ditional ECMA style, due to the efforts
of Dean MacQuigg and Ernest Grabill,
who were assisted by the OHIO STATE
ENGINEER staff. Forty delegates,
representing eighteen outstanding Amer-
ican Universities, were present.
The proud Technic Illustrations Edi-
tor walked off with two first prizes—one
for the best covers and one for the best
illustrations during the 1944-45 season.
The Technic was further honored with a
third prize for best editorials and an
Honorable Mention for best student ar-
ticles. Since the competing ECMA
magazines all maintain extremely high
standards, the University of Michigan
delegation was fortunate indeed to at-
tain such distinction.
These awards were presented at the
Saturday night banquet, which con-
cluded a well-planned convention pro-
gram. Educational talks on Advertis-
ing, Circulation, Editorials, Illustrations.
Staff, and Copy, presented by various
members of the ECMA, constituted the
major part of this program.
Undoubtedly, the most humorous in-
cident at the convention took place at
the final banquet. One of the speakers,
in order to stress a point, used the
French Revolution as an illustration.
The climax of his talk was the question:
"And why did the heads stop rolling in
France?" At this critical point, a voice
from the audience called out: "Because
the guillotine was broken." Thus, did
that speaker make an everlasting im-
pression on the 1945 ECMA conven-
tion.

Of course, there are others enrolled
in the College of Engineering. I refer
to those paragons of manhood, the row-
boat sailors who came directly from
some campus to the V-12 unit at Michi-
gan. We can always count on these fel-
lows to keep us well informed as to the
failings of Michigan as compared with
their original alma mater. They seem
to forget that we weren't forced here
at the point of a gun, any more than
they were made to go to their original
schools. Another topic which they can
be relied on to discuss is the shortcom-
ings of the Michigan coed. Endlessly
they go on about this subject, their
favorite. And do they love to gripe!
Just once they should taste the food
which the civilians have to down (the
civvies are forced to keep their eyes
shut to accomplish this great feat)!
We have become resigned to this situ-
ation, however, and are waiting patient-
ly for "the good old days." Now, don't
misunderstand, these fellows are really
welcome on our campus.
In conclusion, I would like to make
a request of all those frequenting the
halls of engine school. If anyone should,
by a stroke of luck or fate, come across
an engineer who meets the specifications
stated in the definition of a "sharp
character," please, please bring him up
to the TECHNTC office, without delay.
I am sure we could clean up in a raffle,
even if we sold tickets to women engi-
neers exclusively.
As to music, one engineer I know,
when asked to think of a classical com-
position on the spur of the moment,
started to sing, "Toreador, don't spit
on the floor, use the cuspidor, that's what
it's for!" And sometimes, this fellow
does not even heed the advice of this
number!
And is he well read on other sub-
jects besides his classroom assignments?
Ah, me! On his bookshelf, the highest
level of fiction seems to be "The Rover
Boys!" However, I don't wish to omit
the fact that he is also an ardent reader
of "The Police Gazette."

MORE and BETTER THINGS for MORE PEOPLE

THESE are times when the world
cries out for new and finer thing?.
There is a great hunger, broad as all
mankind, for happier relationships
among men — for greater individual
opportunity for accomplishment, for
more and better goods within reach of
everyone.
It is by satisfying this hunger that we
can bring greatest benefit to our na-
tional economy in the future. Through
such action lies the road to more good
jobs, to an ever-rising standard of liv-
ing through the continual replacement
of old things with new and better ones.
Ihe General Motors Technical Cen-
ter is dedicated to such an objective.
It will occupy a 350-acre tract of land
outside of Detroit as soon as condi-
tions permit. Its purpose is to develop
new things that add to the comfort and
security of our living, and to enable
existing things to be made more effi-
ciently, hence at lower selling prices,
so more people may own and enjoy
them — all with expanding job oppor-
tunities.
It will shorten the time required to
bring the work of creative thinkers out
of the idea stage and into usable
reality.
llere in groups of buildings designed
especially for the purpose, General
Motors will gather in advantageous
and inspiring new surroundings the
most modern facilities for research,
advanced engineering, styling and the
development of new manufacturing
techniques.
Here physicists and engineers will dis-
cover new facts and convert them into
new improved products. Stylists will
give them new and more attractive
form. Process engineers will develop
better manufacturing techniques for
making them.
Science here will go to work in the
interest of economic progress. And
history is full of proof that when sci-
ence is so harnessed, more jobs are
created, more comforts and conven-
iences are brought within reach of
more people.
Serving as a source on which the en-
gineering staffs of all of our Divisions
may draw, the General Motors Tech-
nical Center will stimulate improve-
ment in all General Motors products.
Automobiles, refrigerators, Diesel en-
gines, locomotives and other good and
useful things may be expected to be
improved at even faster pace than in
the past.
But the work of the Technical Center
will not be confined to existing things.
It is dedicated to the idea that progress
is the servant of mankind and that
whosoever advances it not only helps
himself but his fellow men. Its goal
will be "more and better things for
more people," whether that comes
through improvement of the old or
development of the new.

stratovision
Until recently the possibility that
television would be available to a ma-
jority of the people in our country was
very small. But now 78% of the na-
tion's population will be covered by
thirteen large Martin, twin-engine air-
planes, flying six miles up transmitting
television and frequency-modulation
waves.
The only way of transmitting tele-
vision and FM waves, previous to the
discovery of Stratovision, was from the
tops of high towers or relay stations
and through co-axial cable. Since tele-
vision and FM waves do not follow the
curvature of the earth, but shoot
straight off into space, one relay station
would cover an area of only about 50
miles radius. To set up relay stations
all over the country 100 miles apart
would be an exceedingly expensive
proposition. Another disadvantage of
the relay station is that the waves sent
over network relays would lose sharp-
ness, emerging at the far end blurred
around the edges. It has also been esti-
mated that a 6000 mile co-axial cable
network, sufficient to reach a majority
of the population would cost at least
100 million dollars.
The idea of Stratovision was con-
ceived by 27-year-old Charles E.
Nobles, Westinghouse engineer, while
flying over his native Texas en route to
Baltimore.
"I suppose my work on military
radar," he says, '"had so crowded my
mind with detail of its operation that
I looked for radar applications in every-
thing I saw. At any rate as the plane
soared over the flat Texas landscape, I
was impressed by the possibilities of
television and FM radio operation—
both similar in many ways to radar—
from an airplane especially at high alti-
tudes common to stratosphere planes."
The "flying antennas" for the new-
network will be built by the Glenn L.
Martin Company. Present plans call
for an all-metal, low-wing monoplane—
almost as large as the B-29, but weigh-
ing about a third as much. The planes
will have a wing spread of about 161
feet, weigh about 20 tons fully loaded,
and be equipped with automatic pilots,
turbo-superchargers and pressurized
cabins. The interior of the planes will
contain sufficient room for the compli-
cated radio equipment and the men
necessary to operate it, plus lounge room
where the ''experts" can relax when off
duty. At 30,000 feet the planes would
be "above the weather" but they would
still face the weather in getting up and
coming down, so that it would be
equipped with the latest in heat anti-
icing and blind flying equipment.

YOU are looking at a partial view of
23.6 miles of glass piping, connec-
tions and fittings used in making mag-
nesium ... a material with a thousand
peacetime uses! If you are figure-minded,
you may be interested in what the mag-
nesium manufacturer himself has to say
about this installation:
"In the Reduction Works Recovery
operation, we use 6,240 feet of 2' Pyrex
piping on each acid cooler. We have 20
of these units, or a total of some 125,000
feet of this piping in service under full
operation. Our replacements amount to
only .0O8 of 1%. In fact, our first unit
went into operation October 24, 1942
and has been incontinuousservice since!"
It didn't just happen that Corning was
called in to furnish the glass piping for
the heat exchangers shown above. Pyrex
brand glass combines adequate mechan-
ical strength with high resistance to
chemical attack. It can also stand high
temperatures and sudden changes from
heat to cold and vice versa. The same
qualities that recommend this type of
glass to chemical industries are also
placing it in drug and dye plants, and in
food industries where transparency and
ease in dismantling for cleaning are
added features.
Corning research and experience over
the years has been able to fit glass to
many jobs that are a little unusual if you
are accustomed to thinking in old-
fashioned terms about glass. Pipe-
lines, glass pump parts,glass instru-
ment bearings, precision glass
parts, to mention a few. And now
that the skill of Corning workers is free
for peacetime work, you'll see glass in
new places and doing a better job than
ever before. In the business you choose
to follow,keep this in mind:glass is amaz-
ingly versatile in the hands of people
who know glass! Corning Glass Works,

ENGINEERING PICTURE

S.S.White flexible shafts are basic mechanical elements
for transmitting power and for remote control under con-
ditions which do not permit of direct connection with solid
shafts. As such, their place in engineering is well estab-
lished and important. This is indicated by the millions of
feet taken annually by applications in aircraft, motor
vehicles, machinery, portable tools, radio and other elec-
tronic equipment and many other products.
The reasons for this wide-scale use are the advantages
offered by these "metal muscles" for many power drive
and remote control uses. Consider the following funda-
mental facts:
1. With a single S.S.White flexible shaft you can transmit
power or provide remote control between any two
points, regardless of the relative locations of the points
or of the distance or obstacles between. This single-
part simplicity, in contrast with systems of gears, uni-
versal joints, belts and pulleys, etc., means simplified
manufacturing and assembly, reduced production time
and costs.
2. The use of S.S.White flexible shafts often makes pos-
sible product improvement because it gives unre-
stricted freedom in placing driving and driven or
controlled members wherever desirable to secure
highest efficiency, ready assembly, space saving, con-
venience of operation and servicing.
SEND FOR THIS FREE BULLETIN
A knowledge of S. S. White flexible shafts and
their power drive and remote control possi-
bilities will be helpful to you as an engineer.

Four planes will be assigned to each
broadcast location, with two planes in
the air constantly—one handling pro-
grams, the other ready to take over in
case of an emergency. The planes will
operate in 8-hour shifts.
Here is how a typical broadcast would
take place; In a theatre in Hollywood
a hit play would be picked up by tele-
vision cameras and piped into a small
television transmitting station. From
there it would go out into the air and
up to the waiting 'flying transmitter.'
Delicate receiving machinery in the
plane would pick up the waves and re-
broadcast them to the television sets
covered by this one plane. But that is
not all. From this plane the wave
would be sent to the next, and from
there to the next, until the play would
appear in television sets in New York.
at the same moment it was being picked
up in Hollywood.
It is well known in television that
the higher a television antenna and
transmitter are raised in the air. the
less power is needed to send out a sig-
nal. This is because television and FM
programs travel from transmitting an-
tennas to receivers via two waves—one
direct, the other ground-reflected. These
two waves arriving at the receiver
simultaneous, tend to cancel each
other out and, if both traveled over the
same path, no signal would be seen or
heard. Conversely, the greater the dif-
ference in their paths, the better the
signal at the transmitter.
At 30,000 feet only one kilowatt of
power would be required to send a
usable signal throughout a 422 mile
wide area, whereas a ground transmitter
would need 50 times as much power
to cover an area 100 miles wide. There-
fore power to operate all of the flying
transmitters and equipment can be pro-
vided by each plane's engines.
For the television home receiver.
Stratovision will mean clearer images
and better reception. Because of the
great height of the antenna and trans-
mitters, the broadcasts will be practical-
ly free from the interference and dis-
tortion caused by unwanted buildings,
mountains, or other obstacles and by
numerous amplifications necessary un-
der previous ground-located stations.
That this isn't a pipe dream of the
future is evidenced by the fact that the
Federal Communications Commission
has already been asked to approve ex-
perimental trials.

lumber shortage
One of the biggest reasons for the
war-time lumber shortage was the
atomic bomb. Construction of the cen-
ters of bomb production in Tennessee
and in Washington required 360,000,-
000 board feet of lumber from the
market.
It was necessary to construct two
complete, modern industrial cities, at
Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and at Rich-
land, Washington—complete from drug
stores to churches. Most of the lumber
was southern pine, obtained from
southern mills. The lumber for Rich-
land came from western forests. Also,
some 35,000,000 square feet of plywood
were used for housing alone.
About 20% of the lumber was
secured on the open market, while 80%
was secured through an auction system
conducted by the Central Procuring
Agency, which purchased lumber for
all the war agencies. To insure secrecy,
lumber was not sent directly to the
bomb production centers, but to nearby-
railheads.
Oak Ridge had a population of
75,000, which made it the fifth largest
city in Tennessee, and at the end of
the war new buildings were being con-
structed at a rate of 1,000 per month.
The plant itself consists of 425 build-
ings. The residential area includes
9,000 houses, 5,000 trailers, 114 apart-
ments in three buildings. 90 dormi-
tories housing 13,000 people, and bar-
racks for 16,000 persons. Also, 1,000
prefabricated units and 204 farm houses
were utilized to ease the housing prob-
lem.
Community facilities included five
churches, a 9,000-volume library, a high
school, nine elementary schools, and a
300-bed hospital. Public buildings in-
cluded thirteen super-markets, nine
drug stores, seven theaters, and seven-
teen large restaurants. Playgrounds,
and athletic facili-
ties were also constructed. Within and
near the reservation were built 300
miles of roads and 55 miles of railroad.
Richland presented the same picture
of frenzied construction and develop-
ment. Since time was such a vital
element, almost all buildings are of
frame construction. All told, $1,655.-
000,000 were spent on these two proj-
ects. Since the war had been costing
a billion dollars per week, the work and
expense of the atomic bomb project
saved many lives and much time and
money in the war effort.
infra-red spectroscope
A new spectroscope, utilizing infra-
red rays, which will analyze oils and
plastics, has been developed by a young
physicist, Dr. Donald K. Coles.
A sample of the material to be
analyzed—a liquid, solid, or in solu-
tion—is placed in a transparent holder,
and a beam of infra-red light is directed
through it. (The infra-red light is pro-
duced from a silicon-carbide rod heated
to incandescence). Mirrors and prisms
guide the beam along to electrical
receivers that convert the light into

Says the U. S. Bureau of Standards, in Cir. No.
80, "by far the best protective metallic coating
for rust-proofing iron or steel" is ZINC.
That statement has been true for over a
hundred years, and is likely to be true for a
long time yet.
Zinc in the form of a coating protects against
rust in two ways:
First, by simple coverage, with a sheath of
rust-resistant metal.
Second, by electro-chemical action, or "sac-
rificial corrosion"
Stop Rust! Cut Costs!
Save Materials! . . . witlt ZINC!
Buildings, equipment, machinery — in all of them the use
of zinc for protection against rust is good engineering and
sensible economy. Zinc can be applied by hot-dip galva-
nizing, electro-plating, sherardizing, or as a metallic pig-
ment; all these methods are sound and practical for various
applications... And specify heavy coatings, for the heavier
the zinc coating, the better the protection, the longer the
service life, and the lower the cost.

The spectroscope tunes the frequency
of the infra-red beams to that of the
samples by means of an intricate tuning
device. When the frequency of the
beam matches the frequency of the
sample, the material absorbs the beam
and transmits it to the electrical cal-
culator, where the frequencies are
measured. Comparison against a stand-
ard determines accurately the composi-
tion of the sample being tested.
physiotherapy
"Bouncing putty", the much-publi-
cized, taffylike member of the silicone
family, has been found to be of prac-
tical use in physiotherapy. Wounded
men with disabled arms or hands have
found this substance to be helpful as a
means for limbering up stiffened mus-
cles during their healing periods. This
silicone product has been credited with
success in cases in which all other
attempts to eliminate stiffness of joints
and muscles had failed.
war research
Consulting engineers, recently re-
turned from technical missions in Ger-
many, have stated that at the end of
the war German war research was rap-
idly reducing the Allies' margin of
superiority in research and in armament
production knowledge.
The Germans had conducted exten-
sive research in infra-red detection. Ap-
plied to night tank warfare, the
Germans were taking a tremendous toll
of destruction among our tank corps.
They mounted infra-red niters on their
searchlights and directed the invisible
rays toward Allied tanks. The reflected
infra-red rays were transmitted to de-
vices, mounted on the German tanks,
which transformed the rays to images,
enabling the German gunners to open
fire.
pure water
The water used for cooling large elec-
tronic tubes must be kept clear of con-
tamination to a greater degree than
drinking water. Certain ions, originat-
ing in the circulating system, must be
kept out, if the water is going to be a
good electrical insulator.
In many instances distilled water is
used for cooling high-potential vacuum
tubes. Fresh distilled water has a resist-
ance of from 300,000 to 500,000 ohms
per cubic centimeter. The addition of
minute particles of impurities lowers

The giant rolling mill that flattens out steel for

SCSEF makes ball and roller bearings for many

pipes contains a sufficient quantity of
metallic ions to drastically lower the
resistivity of the solution.
A test system of electrolytic water-
purifying equipment was constructed
entirely of glass, plastic tubing, and tin-
plated copper, since tin causes little
contamination. The water passes
through a chamber which contains two
oppositely charged electrodes. Each
electrode is enclosed in a porous cera-
mic cup. The metallic ions are attracted
to the negative electrode, and are
trapped within the ceramic cup. The
acid-forming ions go to the positive
electrodes. With this apparatus very
pure water for cooling the electronic
equipment can be maintained. In fact,
while distilled water has a maximum
resistivity of 600,000 ohms per cc, this
system will raise the resistivity to
5,000,000 ohms, making the water ten
times purer.
fosterite
Early in the war, operation of elec-
tronic equipment was uncertain, because
moisture would ruin transformers and
other apparatus. Because of sudden
changes in temperature, even the elec-
trical windings treated with ordinary
impregnants would become wet and
would quickly rot. Fosterite, a poly-
merized resin developed by Newton C.
Foster, has provided, to date, the best
EFLY
from page 6)
solution for moisture-proofing impreg
nants and electrical equipment.
To combat excessive humidity and
sudden changes in temperature, trans-
formers were first put in cans, and the
cans were filled with oil or gum. How-
ever, the cans would soon swell and
leak. Also, it was difficult to seal the
openings and leads to these containers
Then, too. a serious increase in weight
resulted, particularly in airborne equip-
ment. Another method consisted of
soaking the transformers in varnish and
then painting the outer surfaces with
heavy coats of varnish. This procedure
still did not meet the desired specifica-
tions. When the volatile solvents in the
varnish evaporated, there were ready-
made capillary tubes for the moisture
to seep into the electrical apparatus.
Fosterite, however, contains no sol-
vents, and in addition has a very low
viscosity, being almost as fluid as water.
Since it is so highly fluid, it can fill
completely all the holes in the coils and
even in fibrous materials. Also, the
absence of solvents prevents the exist-
ence of moisture-drawing capillary
tubes.

mersion in a 65 degree C. water solu-

transformer was still rated as fit for
service.
A revolutionary electrical system has
been developed for the control of air-
craft, so that the huge air transports of
the future will have a simple solution
to the control of the various electrical
devices needed to operate the airplanes.
The new system is an alternating
current system, and will supply the
electrical auxiliary power necessary for
the operation of radios, landing gears,
lights, navigation instruments, and all
other control services in aircraft.
The development of this new system
was hastened during the war, and it is
estimated that within two years the
weight of a plane's power system will
be reduced between 30 and 40%. Con-
sequently, commercial transports will
be able to fly at higher altitudes with
greater safety.
Present aircraft, such as the B-29,
utilize a direct-current electrical system,
standardized at 30 volts for that partic-
ular model. Since the newer models are
being designed for higher altitudes,
more power is needed. However, the
use of a direct current system would be
prohibited by the large increase in
weight which would be necessary. Also,
D-C equipment seems to suffer consid-
erable brush wear and motor damage at
high altitudes.
By developing an A-C system, the
researchers were able to obtain higher
voltage with less current, at no loss of
power. Each power plant includes an
airplane motor and a variable ratio
drive attached to a generator. Thus,
on a large airplane, several systems can
be run in parallel, increasing current
output and dependability of operation.
Test demonstrations with this new A-C
system have been satisfactory, and
flight tests are being made at present.
new, improved wind runnel
A new, $2,500,000 variable-density
wind tunnel, constructed by the Curtiss-
Wright Corporation, is estimated to
have the most highly flexible range of
testing conditions built into one tunnel,
and will be able to test aircraft in the
"fast-as-sound" range.
The tunnel, will test airplanes at
pressure conditions which exist at 35,-
000 feet. Its volume is 250,000 cubic
feet, and it will be used to test all types
of aircraft, thus accomplishing in one
testing laboratory what might take more

time and money to test in several small-
er tunnels. It will also be available to
other aviation manufacturers for test-
ing purposes. Its 378 feet of circuit
length has an 8V2 x 12 feet testing
chamber which will accommodate a ten-
feet span model. With an overall length
of 178 feet and width of 81 feet, enough
steel to build a heavy destroyer was
necessary for its construction.
The tunnel is powered by a 115,000-
volt power supply which is transformed
to 4,800 volts for use with the 14,000
hp drive motors. These motors can op-
erate twenty-four hours a day, and com-
pressors can increase the atmospheric
pressure four times, or to 60 pounds
per square inch. On the other hand,
pressure may be reduced to four pounds
per square inch, the minimum pressure
at 35,000 feet.
The test chamber may be sealed off
from the rest of the tunnel, to facilitate
handling of two testing operations at
the same time. Only three men are
needed to operate the chambers, since
all the apparatus may be controlled re-
motely from a room just outside the
tunnel.

proximately 21 miles. The super-high-

tures of highway construction were in-
corporated into this highway including
two tri-level bridges, which separate
traffic into three directions.
mobile power plant
When the Red Army smashed into
Berlin, the world first learned how
American-built power plants had helped
the Russians in their drives. Following
in the wake of the advancing troops,
these mobile power units have rendered
invaluable service by supplying tank
and truck repair shops with electrical
power. Then, too, those units have
helped to restore such devastated Rus-
sian cities as Stalingrad, Gomel, and
Minsk.
Sixty-three power plants have been
sent to Russia from the United States,
of which forty are 3,000 kilowatt units
and twenty-three are 1,000 kilowatt
units. A 3,000 kilowatt plant is
mounted on nine special-built railroad
cars, and can be operating within three
hours after arriving at a power-less
area. Each plant consists of two loco-
motive boiler cars, two tenders, a tur-
bine-generator car, a switchgear car,
and three cooling tower cars.

SQUARES AND CUBES
By
BENJAMIN F. BAILEY
Professor Emeritus of Electrical Enginee
We have lived to see the happy (for
us) ending of the greatest series of
battles in the history of the world. But
going on around us all the time are
innumerable other battles. Men are
fighting all the time to exterminate cer-
tain kinds of animal life, e.g. mosqui-
toes, rattlesnakes, harmful bacteria and
many others. In some cases it is a ques-
tion of kill or be killed. Large animals
eat smaller ones who in turn eat still
smaller ones. And so it goes; life is a
battle; a survival of the fittest.
But there is another silent conflict
going on, the battle of the squares and
cubes. The weapons used are not guns
or atomic bombs but merely the inexor-
able laws of nature. As a result giants
and midgets find it difficult to exist,
large buildings are more economical
than small ones, big gas and steam en-
gines (not turbines) tend to be heavy
and costly but large ships and large
electrical devices show the opposite
tendency. Trees do not grow beyond
a certain size (and fortunately for us)
the same is true of mosquitoes, rats and
other pests.
Automobile Engines
As a specific case, let us consider the
automobile engine. I well remember the
storm of protest when it was first pro-
posed that the number of cylinders in
automobile engines be increased from
one to two and even four. Did not one
cylinder give plenty of trouble and
would not four give four times as much
grief? However, the four quickly drove
out the one cylinder engine and it in
turn has largely been replaced by
"sixes" and "eights" with a sprinkling
of "twelve" and "sixteen." Airplanes
today are frequently propelled by 18,
36 or even more cylinders. There is a
reason and it is tied up with the squares
and cubes.
Consider two cylinders, alike in shape,
but one of say 3" bore by 4" stroke;
the other 6" by 8". Clearly the big one
is eight times as heavy as the small one
and it will take in eight times as much
explosive mixture per stroke. It exerts
approximately eight times as much
torque, since the area of the piston head

Benjamin F. Bailey.
is four times as great and the leverage
is twice as great because the throw of
the crankshaft is doubled. But it will
not develop eight times the power for
several reasons. One is that the area
of intake passages is only four times as
great and other things being equal, only
four times as much mixture per minute
can pass into the cylinder instead of
eight times. Moreover the speed in feet
per minute of the piston is limited (due
to lubrication difficulties) and the al-
lowable rpm of the large engine would
be only about half that of the small
one. The net result is that the large
cylinder weighing eight times as much,
develops only four times as much power
as the small one or the weight per horse-
power is doubled. Of course these fig-
ures are not exact, since many minor
considerations have been neglected.
With the above facts in mind, however,
it is easy to see why automobile engines
today use small cylinders and many of
them. Try to imagine a modern car
in which the eight cylinder, 125 hp en-
gine has been replaced by one having
only a single cylinder. The flywheel
alone would weigh as much as the entire
multiple cylinder engine. Here we have
a clear cut case where size is not an
advantage but rather the contrary.
If in the above we substitute "recipro-
ring
eating steam engine" for "automobile
engine" the argument is still good. If
reciprocating steam engines were being
built in large sizes, we would doubtless
see a tendency to use more and smaller
cylinders. The same trend can be seen
in diesel engines which are being built
for higher speeds, smaller cylinders and
more of them.
Electrical Machinery
Big and Little Ships
Here the volume and roughly the
weight and the ability to carry load in-
crease as the cube of dimensions; the
resistance to motion through water,
about as the square. Hence in propor-
tion to size, the large ship requires far
less power, consumes less fuel and has
more space for cargo. Ships would un-
doubtedly be built much larger than
they are now if it were not for the fact
that few harbors are deep enough for
even the existing large ships. Commer-
cial considerations also limit the size
of ships since it would obviously be im-
possible to find suitable cargoes for
very many large ships. In the case of
ore carriers on the Great Lakes where
there is no competition for cargoes, the
ships are built as large as practicable,
being limited by the depth of water and
size of locks.
A striking illustration of the influence
of the squares and cubes is afforded by
sailing ships. It requires only a glance
to see that the power (i.e. sail area)
increases about as the square of the
length and not as the cube. Neverthe-
less, the big ships are faster and it is a
fact that the speed of our racing sail
boats is far below that of the clipper
ships (which were of course much
larger) built 75 years ago.
Airplanes
Here, much the same considerations
apply and planes are rapidly becoming
larger and more effluent. Tt is amusing
to recall that not very long ago a
"scientist" proved that large planes
would never fly, since the weight in-
creased as the cube of the dimensions;
the wing area only as the square. Fig-
ures don't lie, but be sure you have all

a job—and who doesn't?—
some brief, pointed ideas.
Pi
Sk:
YOU do not know how to write a job-
hunting letter. That goes, literally,
for nine of you out of ten. And you had
better learn. Last week I sat in the office
of a Detroit business man, who had ad-
vertised for an engineering sales assist-
ant. He showed me a stack of letters of
application. Except for about two let-
ters, the stack was not worth the trouble
involved in pushing it into the waste
basket.
When you write that letter, either
conform to business usage and put it on
8.5 by 11, or don't write it. Never write
it on someone else's stationery. Ordinary
business correspondence never appears
except in typed form. Neither should
yours. You may type the letter yourself
if you can do a good job that is no com-
promise with shoddiness in any respect;
otherwise, get somebody to type it for
you. Let handwriting be but a reluct-
antly adopted alternative. If you must
write by hand, either do a good job or
let it go.
Imagination and the creative instinct
are valuable assets, but not when ap-
plied to the formal parts of a letter of
application. Please, please do not as-
sume that you know all about this
letter business. Get a copy of Hadida's
Pitfalls in English (Putnam) or some
such manual, and find out exactly how
these things are done. While on a tender
subject, what of your spelling? Think
of the graduates who have written back
to me and spelled it "Proffesor." Note
the many seniors who write "proceed-
ure." Dwell on the case of the man who
spends four years playing with our ap-
paratus, and still writes and speaks of
"lavatory," meaning laboratory. The
pertinent question is: are you wise
enough to know that your spelling is
shaky somewhere, and do you know
enough to have a friend check over your
letters before you send them?
Letter Content
Design the letter with care. Very
often, the purpose of the letter is to
secure an interview. The almost invari-
able rule: no interview, no job. Hiring
BY POPULAR DEMAND
Ever since "Dear Sir" and "Good Morn-
ing, Sir" appeared in the TECHNIC in
1935 and 1940, we have received favor-
able comments from many students who
have made good use of the material pre-
sented.
The articles were reprinted in numer-
ous other publications and we have fre-
quently been asked to run them again.
Because we feel that they constitute one
of the briefest and best bits of informa-
tion on the important subject of contacts
with prospective employers, we are doing
so now.
Professor Moore points out when a can-
didate (senior or graduate) for employ-
ment makes up his typed personal record,
his most usual omissions are date of the
record and preferences.
Here is the first of the two articles.
The second will appear next month.
sight unseen is extremely rare. When
your letter gets there, it is the only
thing there to represent you. Unless it
is one of the few that commands atten-
tion and earns respect, you are accept-
ing an almost insurmountable handicap
from the very start. The interview is not
granted. Or if it is, the employer is
likely to sit before you, constantly re-
minding himself that "this is the chap
who used his girl's perfumed stationery;
his fountain pen ran out halfway, mak-
ing it a two-color job; he failed to get
my title right; he ended in a rush with
Very truly yrs.'; yes, I remember this
man's letter."
What to say? So many exceptions
come in, that the subject is too broad to
attempt writing comprehensive rules
here. Carefully think out the minimum
requirements; find the things you must
say, then say them concisely and clearly.
Beyond such a limit you hardly dare
go, unless you are one of the few, blessed
with imagination, good taste, and ma-
turity of judgement, who knows he can
add touches lending a personal distinc-
tion to an otherwise prosaic document.
If you can do, this, it is invaluable. If
not, emphatically do not try it; it would
turn an otherwise successful business
letter into something ludicrous.
Some day, as an engineer, you will
have to send an engineering report by
mail. The situation also calls for a letter
of transmittal. You would not dream of
thinking that, since you must write a
letter anyway, you should recast the
whole report and shove it bodily into the
letter of transmittal. Now, a similar
mistake can be made if you try to cram
all the factual data about yourself into
your letter of application. If you had
an engineering report on yourself, you
would mail it to the employer, and your
letter of transmittal would become a
letter of application. This brings us to—
The Typed Personal Record
The personal record may be thought
of as a special form of engineering
report. Its subject is—you. It is typed.
It is in outline form. Every item is so
presented as to be easily found. It must
always give the minimum required facts.
It may contain more, depending on your
judgement. The form, the general ap-
pearance, the sequence of classifications

that should be your own. A wide latitude
exists within which your material can be
suitably arranged. Do not make your
job look exactly like one you have seen;
consciously make it your own. to give
it individuality. That the paper should
be standard size need not be mentioned.
The personal record may vary from
one to five pages in length. Many recent
graduates who have filed records with

me usually manage to cover between
one and two pages A graduate ten years
out may have to adopt an ingenious
tabulating scheme to compress his varied
experiences into an acceptably short
document.
The record serves at least three
needs. It enables you, perhaps for the
first time, to know your own experi-
ence, training, education, and value.
When a copy is filed with your faculty
placement officer, you are giving him
just the fine cooperation he needs in
helping to place you now or later. And
a copy placed with the employer pre-
sents you to him in the form of a high-
grade report. These needs indicate the
content.
Content oj the Personal Record
1. Photograph. Perhaps the home
town paper honored your departure for
college with a story, and wisely included
a picture to prove to the incredulous
that there was no mistake in identity.
Of course, you saved a clipping. Leave
it intact; that half-tone print will not
serve here. As a senior, you are being
photographed for the 'Ensian, to a size
of 4 by 6. In general, that is too large.
Get a relatively inexpensive photograph
made, size 3 by 4 or a little smaller.
Never send a snapshot or a bad photo-
graph; omit entirely rather than com-
promise. Never place the picture on
the record so that it will be folded and
creased in mailing.
2. Personal Facts. Such items as
name, address, telephone number, date
of the record itself, your age at that
date, place of birth, height, weight, state
of health, whether married, whether
there are children or other dependents
—these usually head the record in out-
line form.
3. Affiliations. Memberships in honor
and professional societies are given.
4. Education, Training. The high
school may or may not be be mentioned.
The college, degree, and date of gradua-
tion must be given. A breath-taking
omission occurred when one of our
graduates remembered everything ex-
cept-to say in his record, that he ever
graduated anywhere. Advanced degrees
are of course mentioned. Any special
training, such as one gets within numer-
ous industrial training set-ups, is set
forth.
Under Education, some go so far as
to list all college courses taken. Proba-
bly the typical employer would consider
this as going too far with detail. How-
ever, a selected list of courses con-
sidered most valuable and which might
be most pertinent for a certain kind of
employment ought to go in.
5. Experience. Err on the side of
completeness. Tell the jobs you have
held before, during, and after college.
One little item, such as selling groceries
one summer, may seem insignificant to
you; it may turn out to be the very
thing that separates you from the group
of applicants and hands you the job.
Selling groceries is sales experience, it
means getting along with fellow hustlers,
and it involves meeting the customers—
pleasant, cantankerous, and all kinds
between. Did you earn college expenses
on some menial job in the hospital?
Then you are one of the very few grad-
uates having any kind of extended hos-
pital contact whatever. A manufacturer
of therapeutic apparatus might want
you for design, development, or sales.
Companies making unusual finishes,
paints, flooring materials, sound absorp-
tion materials, surgical supplies—all
these would prefer a man who had hap-
pened to spend four years working in
any capacity in a hospital, to others who
had not.
6. Activities. (Remember, the se-
quence of divisions is up to you; if you
prefer to list Activities right below
Education, do so. I'm putting them
here to be sure they get into the story.)
Class offices, memberships and offices
held in societies and student activities—
all should be mentioned. Does every
employer expect that all his recruited
graduates shall have a long record of
activities? Not at all. Some would pay
no attention to it. A few might even
object to it, when looking for a certain
type of man. Most of them will tolerate
a decent amount of activity background,
and many will insist on some.
7. New Objects Planned, Designed,
or Built. Here we come to the gadgets.
Many seniors have been tinkering for
years, planning or building model en-
gines, model airplanes, radio sets, and
so on. Make clear those that were real-
ly built, as against those that never got
beyond the design stage. The late B.
G. Lamme, so long and so eminently the
chief engineer for Westinghouse Elec-
tric, interviewed thousands of graduates.
He always inquired into this kind of
self-imposed activity. He considered it
essential to the make-up of every to-be-
successful engineer. It may well be that
he gave the matter undue emphasis; but
due to his influence, you may be assured
that many employers of engineers think
the same way about it.
8. Special interests. You can bring
these out strikingly, in part, by putting
red stars on those courses (under Edu-
cation) whose content most represents
the lines you wish to follow. A foot-
note can explain the stars. Then, in a
paragraph or two, state your special
interests. One of our men roomed in
the house of a married "Medic" stu-
dent; due to long talk-fests there, and
with other particular motivations, he
took an unusual dose of work in the
Arts college. He wound up with a per-
manent and informed interest in socio-
logy, mental hygiene, medicine, medical
apparatus; and said so in his personal
record. Another man stated that he had
been reading Lester's Marketing Indus-
trial Equipment on his own time, and
had been following current articles along
the same line. Since he wished to locate
in sales engineering, he had listed a
valuable special interest in an up-to-the-
minute way.
9. Preferences. You may hesitate to
mention two or three or four preferences,
fearing that some employer may pass
you up if the opening he has does not
quite fit your desires. Indeed, the fear
may be justified. But you can hardly
leave him completely in the dark; he is
quite likely to do the same to you—
(Continued on page 16)

to ask you to come across the state for
an interview, only to find that you don't
want his sales job. On the positive side,
if he is looking for a production man,
and you have said you wanted to be one,
you begin to get together with him right
away. Of course, preferences are to be
stated in general, functional terms. An
older man may properly say he wishes
to design fractional horsepower motors;
that is his line, and has been for years.
You will say, a recent graduate, that
you want design of small rotating appa-
ratus. And put down about three pref-
erences, not just one. It is seldom neces-
sary to state negatives. However, if you
positively will not consider something—
such as sales—say so.
10. References. It is customary to
cite as references, one or more of the
men you have already worked for. They
are used to these matters, and will take
it as matter of course. As a college
man, such references will not complete
your list. You must not fail to refer to .
at least one faculty member. Otherwise,
the employer will assume that for some
reason that ought to be smoked out, you
left college under such a cloud that you
would rather not have your name
brought up on the campus any more
than can be helped. That isn't the case
•—but what is he to think? No, you do
not need to ask permission of any
faculty member in order to refer to him.
Whether or not you ask him about it,
he will be glad to respond to inquiries
and he will tell the facts as he sees them
in either case. Now, there is often good
reason for asking him first: you thus
make more certain that he really will
remember you. It lessens the chance
that in a couple of years he will be
mistaking you for the classmate of
about the same size, weight, and degree
of difficulty in keeping awake in that
early afternoon class.
11. (....?) Write your own ticket.
It is by no means intended that when
ten categories are listed above, you will
faithfully have all ten—no more, no less.
Make the job your own. And after
reading this, do not get in wrong by
trying to bedevil some poor faculty
member into telling you in detail how
to do it. Get to work and design the
record. Type it to see how it will look.
Then, if you wish, take it to a faculty
member and ask for suggestions.
It is entirely legitimate to get all the
ideas you can from personal records al-

ready available. We have plenty on file
in the E.E. Department. The secretary
in room 274 (mornings only) will be
glad to let you look at several at your
leisure.
To close this matter of personal rec-
ords, a striking instance may be cited.
A recent graduate carefully informed
himself before he left the campus. He
shortly sent me one of the best records
I have ever seen. A few days later he
called on a certain firm in his home city,
and handed a copy to the girl. She
cheerfully passed it in to the chief engi-
neer, and promised it would receive at-
tention. However, she told the graduate
not to wait. It was not customary to
grant an interview the same day. He
chose to wait anyway. In five minutes
he was called in. He answered three
questions and in ten more minutes was
hired. Total elapsed time, fifteen min-
utes. He's there yet.
Author's 1940 Addendum . . .
In the spring of 1939, I made a study
of the content of interview and applica-
tion blanks of 21 companies. I have not
seen such a study published anywhere;
this is the first publication of the present
study.
Forty-two items were found that are
of significance in the placement of col-
lege seniors. Omitted are some items
that apply mainly to older men—such
as Number of Children.
The table presents (at top) the confi-
dential key numbers of 21 companies,
and (at left) the 42 items. A blank
space means that the company did not
include that item. It is amusing to
note that one of the largest firms in the
world forgot to ask for Height and
Weight.
Companies 1-3 are automotive; 4-11.
chemical; 12-13, electrical; 14-17, me-
chanical; 18-19, steel; 20-21. optical
and business machines.

silicones
The development of silicones has
given the scientists of the world a huge
opportunity for the discovery of new
compounds and industrial materials.
Research work on silicones was begun
seventy years ago, by Dr. F. S. Kip-
ping, in England. Curious about the
many similarities between carbon and
silicon, Dr. Kipping reasoned that semi-
organic compounds could possibly be
made, with silicon replacing the carbon
atoms in the molecular structures. The
final results would be compounds simi-
lar to the vast systems of hydrocar-
bons in organic chemistry.
In his original research, Dr. Kipping
was highly successful in making many
organo-silicon compounds which should
be chemically designated as silico-ke-
tones, but which he shortened to sili-
cones. Kipping was annoyed, however,
because these new compounds did not

cati rolls as a soft white sheet. Its

lem.
display the same physical and chemical
properties of their hydrocarbon counter-
parts. For purely scientific reasons, Dr.
Kipping and his co-workers spent forty
years preparing and naming a large
number of organo-silicon-oxygen com-
pounds. Thus these men laid a sub-
stantial foundation of facts and for-
mulas for the men who were to apply
the silicones industrially.
In the United States, during the
1930's, Corning Glass Works were con-
fronted with a serious problem in glass-
fiber insulation for electrical parts.
However, since an insulation needed an
organic filler, the results of their experi-
ments were limited to the temperature
weaknesses of the organic filler. Sili-
cone compounds provided solutions to
this problem, because they solidify
under heat—the characteristic of poly-
merization which troubled Kipping in
his work.
This problem in insulation has led to
the discovery of many important appli-
cations for silicone compounds in indus-
try. Although only one plant is at
present manufacturing silicones, many
more units will be needed to provide
these new industrial materials.
The primary raw material for sili-
cone production is sand, prepared with
chemicals made from brine, coal, and
petroleum. The complicated chemical
reactions are performed in steps, in a
complex system of stills, pressure tanks,
coolers, and piping, all of which resem-
ble the equipment of an oil refinery.
The possible combinations of silicone
molecules, like hydrocarbons, are infi-
nite in number and in composition. As
in the days of Columbus and Magellan,
Man stands upon the edge of a new
continent of mysteries and opportuni-
ties, and only the bare outlines of a
few sections of this continent have been
charted.
Silicones can be considered in three
broad divisions—resins, liquids, and
rubber. Two common basic properties
which these three groups have are great
temperature stability and water resist-
ance. Not only are silicones operative
over a wide range of temperatures, but
they are also able to resist temperatures
higher than those which organic mate-
rials can withstand. It is easily
explained why this should be the case.
The silicon-oxygen bond on the silicon
chain is very strong; that is, relatively
large amounts of energy must be ap-
plied before the bond is broken. This
amount of energy has been calculated
to be 89.3 units (kilocalories per mol).
The bonding energy for carbon to car-
bon, however, is only 2/3 as much, or
58.6 units.
An explanation of the silicones'
water-resistance is that the silicon-
oxygen-silicon chain linkage is sur-
rounded by hydrocarbon units, and
presents toward water a surface simi-
lar to paraffin and oil, and which subse-
quently is capable of resisting water.
The silicone resins are produced as
varnish-like liquids which polymerize
to solids when heated for three hours
at 250 degrees F. and cured for several
hours at 450 degrees F. The heat causes
the chain-like resin molecules to form
many side-bonds to adjoining molecules,
in all three dimensions. The brittle-
ness or elasticity of these solids depends
upon the degree of formation of side-
bonds.

v Courtesy Weslinghouse
Processes are rigidly checked.
Silicone resins, therefore, are ideal
for high-temperature insulation. They
can be applied as liquids to a fabric of
fiberglass or asbestos, filling the inter-
stices. Upon baking, they polymerize
and solidify, forming permanent im-
pregnants that repel water and resist
heat far better than organic varnishes.
These thermosetting resins are equally
suitable for coating magnet wire, for

The University of Michigan is proud
to welcome back a distinguished faculty
member, Professor William G. Dow,
who returned to campus this fall after a
three-year leave-of-absence. Professor
Dow is once again a member of the Uni-
versity of Michigan electrical engineer-
ing staff, which he first joined in 1926.
In February, 1943, Professor Dow
left the University in order to work in
the Radio Research Laboratory of Har-
vard University. This laboratory, which
operated under the Office of Scientific
Research and Development, was di-
rected by Dr. F. E. Terman, Dean of
Engineering at Stanford University. Pro-
fessor Dow directed work connected with
developing ultra high frequency continu-
ous wave radio equipment. His main
interest was to operate equipment at
highly increased power and frequency.

William C. Dow.
Professor Dow points out that many
of the wartime developments made in
continuous wave transmitters will find
countless applications in postwar com-
munications and industries. His continu-
ous wave equipment, which is equipment
which radiates power continuously, is
invaluable in such fields as television,
frequency modulation, communication,
and short wave radios. Hence, it is obvi-
ous that his contributions not only
helped to win the war, but will also
help to make a better peace-time world.
In 1917, Professor Dow received his
BS in electrical engineering at the Uni-
versity of Minnesota. The first two
years of his career he spent in the engi-
neering corps of the army as an officer.
He then worked at Westinghouse for six
years, until he came to Ann Arbor. Since
he has been at Michigan, he has mainly
been connected with teaching and re-
search in electronics. He has made out-
standing contributions to the field of
theory and design of vacuum tubes,
as well as applications of the electronic
method in the manufacturing industries.
Having become an authority in this
work, it is no wonder that he has con-
ducted several extension courses on in-
dustrial electronics. He has directed
a research program at the University
related to the use of high frequency
power for manufacturing—a project
financed by leading Michigan industries.
Professor Dow makes splendid use of
his spare time, as evidenced by the large
variety of organizations he is active in.
He is a member of the Institute of
Radio Engineers, the American Welding
Society, the Engineering Society of De-
troit, as well as secretary of the Ameri-
can Institute of Electrical Engineers
(AIEE) Technical Committee on elec-
tronics. Furthermore, he is a member of
the IRE technical committee on elec-
tronic tubes and is vacuum tube consult-
ant on the Bureau of Standards staff.
When mentioning Professor Dow's al-
most countless contributions to the Elec-
trical Engineering field, his studies on
electronics for welding aluminum in air-
plane construction, conducted in the
early part of the war, should not be for-
gotten. His book, "Fundamentals of
Engineering Electronics" published in
193 7 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, has become
a byword with all upperclassmen and
graduates in the field. The University
is indeed proud to welcome back such
an outstanding scientist to its faculty.

Destiny and the United States Navy
were responsible for bringing Howard
Yerges to the University of Michigan
campus. Otherwise, Ohio State Uni-
versity would have been the beneficiary
of his impressive football talents. Born
in Columbus, Ohio, Howard early in his
life made plans to attend Ohio State
University, and after receiving his ele-
mentary and high school education in
Columbus, he enrolled in O. S. U. and
even went so far as to complete his
freshman year there. But then Fate,
in the form of Uncle Sam and his blue-
jacket boys, intervened, with the result
that Michigan has greatly benefited
from the presence of this outstanding
football star and very personable stu-
dent.

Howard Yerges
Howard has been in the Navy V-12
program since November, 1943, and has
spent all of that time on the Michigan
campus, not having had to receive boot-
camp training. When the V-12 men
were transferred to the Naval R.O.T.C.
Howard was in his sixth term and thus
has remained in V-12.
Due to graduate in June, Howard,
like other seniors in the naval service,
is seriously pondering over the uncer-
tainty of his future. He can accept a
direct commission in the Navy, report
for active duty in February, serve a
term of sea duty, and then return to
school to finish his last term and gradu-
ate. Or he can finish school in the
Navy, graduate in June, and then re-
ceive his commission in the Navy, after

...to do a man-size job!
NO bigger than a five-grain aspirin tablet
—that's the size of a new non-linear
coil, specially designed so that an FM trans-
mitter and receiver might fit into the
cramped interior of a tank!
This mighty midget that does the work
of four vacuum tubes and two tuned circuits
was developed by Bell Telephone Labora-
tories—and constituted a real challenge to
the manufacturing engineers of Western
Electric. Besides being the smallest toroidal
coil ever produced for electronic equipment,
the materials used were of the most delicate.
The core of the tiny doughnut-shaped
coil consists of a small ceramic form wound
with permalloy tape 3/32nds of an inch
wide and in thickness about l/20th the
diameter of a human hair. The problem was
how to wind l/50th of a gram of this fragile
tape around each core, and then to wind
fine wire around the taped form.
Western Electric engineers discovered
that a standard coil winding machine could
be adapted for wrapping the foil-like tape
around the form. However, when it came
to applying the required forty turns of wire,
they found that the only effective method
was to have the wire sewn by hand around
the minute core through the hole in the
center ... in much the same way that a
seamstress sews around a buttonhole!
This system efficiently met military pro-
duction demands—to the tune of over
100,000 units. It was just one of many far-
reaching, interesting assignments mastered
by radio, electrical, mechanical and in-
dustrial engineers at Western Electric. Now
these combined production skills are once
more dedicated to Western Electric's 63
year old job as supply unit of the Bell
Telephone System.

A FLEXIBLE SHAFT IS
LIKE A HOLE-IN-ONE
The object in golf, as you know, Is to complete the course with
the fewest strokes. A hole In one stroke helps greatly to accom-
plish this object.
The object In machine design Is to achieve desired results
with the fewest parts—for that means less material, less manu-
facturing, less assembly, lower costs. Where the transmission of
rotational power Is involved, an S. S. White flexible shaft Is the
counterpart of the hole-in-one In that It accomplishes the purpose
with a single part.
This is a basic reason why S. S. White flexible shafts are
worth considering for every rotational power drive or remote
control problem that comes up. You will, therefore, find It help-
ful In machine design work to be familiar with the range and
scope of S. S. White flexible shafts which are produced In a
large selection of sizes and characteristics In both the power
drive and remote control types.

the facts before you figure. One thing
he overlooked was the fact that in-
creased speed could make up for the
smaller wing area. Also in both planes
and ships not all dimensions increase
at the same rate and the weight is less
than proportional to the cube of the
dimensions. A similar instance is that
of the scientist who "proved" about 100
years ago that no steam ship could ever
carry enough coal to cross the Atlantic.
He didn't make allowances for the fact
that more efficient power plants would
be developed and that larger ships would
require less fuel in proportion to their
size. Even today a really small power
boat could not carry enough fuel to
cross the Atlantic.
Turning now to something with
which the writer is more familiar, we
find that the tables are turned; the big
electrical machine has a greater output
per pound, is more efficient and costs
less. For the benefit of those who have
"passed" physics and have not yet
taken some elementary electrical engi-
neering may we point out that the
transformer is the simplest, cheapest
and most efficient device ever invented
to transform power to a different form
and is well suited to a simple analysis.
It consists merely of a core of laminated
iron surrounded by two coils of wire.
(The ordinary induction coil used in
the ignition of automobile engines is a
small transformer.)
To understand what follows you need
to know only a few simple facts. The
voltage applied to the total magnetic
flux in the laminated core and the cur-
rent it can carry is proportional to the
cross section of the wire. The facts are
summarized in the following table. The
figures are of course only relative. As
before we will assume a simple two to
one ratio; that is every dimension of
the large transformer is just twice the
corresponding dimension of the smaller
one.
We have kept the flux and the current
per square inch the same, hence the
losses are proportional to the weights.
The output per pound (and roughly per
dollar) is twice as great in the large
as in the small transformer. The effi-
ciency is higher since the losses are
proportionally only half as great. Don't
think that the efficiency of 99% is too
high; many transformers have even
better efficiencies. The output is then
(Continued from page 13)
approximately proportional to the
fourth power of the dimensions.

There is one "fly in the ointment" for
the electrical engineer; the big trans-
former has eight times the losses but
only four times the area. Since all the
losses appear as heat which must pass
out through the surface, the loss per
square inch is doubled and if nothing
were done about it the big fellow would
get much too hot. The remedy is to
increase the surface by building ducts
through the iron or if that is not suffi-
cient, by blowing a blast of air through
it or by other means which need not be
discussed here.
A similar analysis can be applied to
other electrical devices, and similar re-
sults are obtained. For example, elec-
tric motors increase in weight in pro-
portion to the cube of their dimensions
but the horsepower increases as the
fourth power, providing the speed of
rotation remains the same. (Obviously
this last condition cannot always be
met.) The weight and cost per horse-
power become less and the efficiency
better as the size increases.
The following table shows some of
these facts. The data refer to poly-
phase induction motors and are taken
from manufacturers' catalogs.
Horse
Power R.P.M. Weight Cost

Horse Power Pound Efficiency
$ 9.00 0.293 0.88
$ 6.40 0.278 0.92
$10.20 0.28S 0.89
Note that the cost of the 20 hp motor
is not twice that of the 10 hp at the
same speed but only 42% more. (Actu-
ally the price increases very nearly as
the square root of the rating for motors
of the same speed.) Also the weights
are in about the same ratio. It is inter-
esting to see how nearly constant is the
cost per pound of different motors.
Rather close estimates of cost can fre-
quently be made in this way. The cor-
responding data for a slower speed mo-
tor have been added and naturally the
weight and cost are greater. The effi-
ciency of the 20 hp motor is consider-
ably greater than that of the 10 hp a&lt;
was to be expected. This advantage is
however lost if we are forced to use a
low speed motor. Modern airplanes use
many electric motors and these fre-
quently operate at 8000 rpm, to save
weight and cost.
In the Animal Kingdom
Which can fly better, an ostrich or
a humming bird? Of course, thv hum-
ming bird, because he can go ahead,
hover or even fly backward (some say
that he does this so he can see where
he has been) while the ostrich cannot
fly at all. The application of the
squares and cubes is obvious.
Why are whales so big? Because they
weigh nothing in the water. A land ani-
mal the size of a large whale would
probably be unable to stand up. His
strength would not be proportional to
his weight. A flea is much stronger than
an elephant in proportion to its size.
Imagine an elephant able to jump the
way a flea can.
There Were Giants in Those Days
Perhaps, but not in these days. The
giant has a hard time of it trying to
dodge the squares and cubes. Why?
His weight is proportional to the cube
of his height and presumably he re-
quires food in proportion to his weight
but his stomach area and consequently
his ability to assimilate food is only
proportional to the square of his height.
The area of his skin and lungs is like-
wise small compared with his weight.
One giant (over eight feet tall) made a
living by exhibiting himself at World
Fairs. He was really a pitiable sight.
The poor fellow could walk only with
difficulty and died when he was only
a little over 20 years old. No statistics
are at hand but did you ever see a really
big man or woman who lived to be very
old? Of course there are exceptions
but the person who has lived to the age
of say 80 is usually of medium height
or even below it.

... what else is in store for these Man-Made Gems?
That's a good question. But at this point no one can give
you the complete answer to it.
The full possibilities of these man-made gems have not
been explored. The making of synthetic sapphire and ruby
in this country is an infant industry—born in World War II.
Prior to the war, all our synthetic sapphire and ruby were
imported. When our supply of these war-vital materials was
cut off, The Linde Air Products Company, a Unit of UCC,
at the request of the government con-
densed into months the research necessary
to master the techniques of quantity pro-
duction.
Of all the gems, synthetic sapphire and
ruby, like their natural forms, are second
only to the diamond in hardness. Already
they have many uses.
Thev are long-wearing thread -juides in

textile mills. They are the bearings in watches and delicate
navigation instruments. They make phonograph needles
that will far outlast metal. They are much in demand for
jewelry . . . and are used for many types of cutting tools,
gages, spray nozzles, burnishing wheels and insulators.
What else are they good for? If you are technically
minded and read the italicized paragraph below, you may
come up with a new answer or two.
In addition to extraordinary wear resistance and
great beauty, LlNDE synthetic sapphire and ruby
are highly resistant to most chemicals and have
high strength at temperatures up to 3,000 deg. F.
and higher. Electrical losses at all frequencies are
low. They can be given an exceptionally smooth
surface, and can be bonded to other materials.

Silicone fluids are crystal-clear liquids
whose molecules consist entirely of long
chains. Controlling the lengths of these
molecules gives complete control over
the viscosity of the resulting liquids.
Short-chain molecules form thin, water-
like fluids, while extremely long-chained
molecules give a product that is as thick
as molasses.
A silicone liquid similar to water has
a freezing point of -125 degrees F.t
and a boiling point of 300 degrees. It
is, therefore, suitable as a hydraulic
fluid or lubricant which must operate
in extreme cold, yet can withstand
operation at moderately high temper-
atures. Silicone lubricants, however,
have not yet been completely proved as

good lubricants. They have been most
effective in instruments where bearing
loads are light. Besides being applicable
as damping fluids for precision instru-
ments and gauges, silicone liquids have
been utilized as heat-transfer fluids and
in high-temperature baths. Since even
the silicone fluids are moisture-resist-
ant, ceramic insulators are coated with
a silicone-base paint which prevents
surface-wetting of the insulators. In-
stead, water collects in droplets and
rolls off the insulators.
A curious quality of silicone fluids is
their ability to reduce the surface ten-
sions of lubricating oils and other
hydrocarbon liquids. Consequently, a
minute percentage of silicone fluid in

the oil prevents the oil from foaming
badly when it is heated. Long-chain
molecules in the silicone fluids have
resulted in the development of mate-
rials having the consistency of grease
and paste. This grease maintains an
unchanging consistency in a tempera-
ture range of from -40 degrees to 400
degrees F. It is also resistant to oxida-
tion, acids, and alkalies. As a conse-
quence, it has become a very practical
lubricant for stop-cocks and pressure-
lubricated valves.
The third group of silicones resem-
bles rubber in looks and in behavior.
Although these compounds are as soft
and resilient as rubber, they possess all
the heat and water-resisting properties
of silicones. Silicone rubber products
can be employed in places where tem-
peratures reach 500 degrees F. Sili-
cone water-resistant gaskets are rapidly
replacing rubber in marine equipment.
In uses where extreme temperature
changes occur, silicone rubber is adapt-
able as a coating for wire, as a sleeving
for cables, or a glass-fiber tape. Print-
ing-press inking rolls and coatings for
metals and ceramics have been fash-
ioned out of silicone rubber.
Unfortunately silicone rubber is not
a complete substitute for natural or
synthetic rubber, since it is deficient in
tension, shear, and abrasion. Its signi-
ficant properties, however, have forged
for this family of chemicals an impor-
tant place in our industrial world. The
science of molecular engineering will,
in years to come, undoubtedly find many
new and practical uses for these ma-
terials.
rocket- projectiles
Rockets have played a very impor-
tant role in the defeat of Japan. The
Navy used great numbers of them to
bombard enemy shore positions preced-
ing troop landings, and other forces
used them for strafing and offensive op-
erations. The great demand for these
rockets resulted in a mass-production
line at the Canton Naval Ordnance
Plant. This line is indeed a great feat
in modern engineering. In war it has
served extremely well as a munitions
producer: and, in peace, it will stand
as a model for efficient industrial plan-
ning and operation. Every conceivable
production problem was overcome and
maximum flow of finished parts was
made possible by careful engineering de-
sign and planning.
In laying out this project a scale
model of the production line was used.
In addition, small models of workers
were made in order to insure proper
working space and correct working
levels. By using this miniature layout
the engineers were able to design an ex-
tremely efficient system, compactly ar-
ranged in a minimum of floor space and
constructed for ease of material han-
dling.

A view of the production line model.
The actual projectile process consists
of two production lines. The first line
makes the spinner head, the '"nose" of
the missile; whereas the second line
produces the "HVAR head." which is
a machined casing threaded to receive
the spinner head at one end and the
rocket motor at the other. Although
these parts are different in size and
shape, the machines and methods in
both lines are very similar.
The first step in each production line
is surface cleaning the rough forgings.
Rotary blast machines were found to be
very satisfactory, but it was at this
point that the first real production prob-
lem was met. Traces of moisture on
the parts would clog the nozzles of the
shot blasts, it was learned. Therefore,
infra red drying ovens were installed.
Conveyors carry the forgings beneath
banks of lamps surrounded by glittering
surfaces of gold plate.
A discussion of the "HVAR" line will
give us a general idea of the produc-
tion of this projectile and some of the
problems met in designing the line.
After shot blasting with a rotary-air
driven machine to clean the surfaces and
thus increase the life of the machine
tools, the forging is sawed to correct

do a pull-up (i.e. chin himself) with
great ease, but could the larger one?
If the small man weighed 100 Ibs. the
big one would weigh 800. His muscles
would have relatively a cross section
of four and doubtless could pull four
times as hard. He would also get twice
the leverage since the distance from his
elbow to the point of attachment of
the muscles to the bones is twice as
great but this advantage is offset since
the distance from his elbow to his
hands is also twice as great. The net
result is that he can pull four times as
hard but he weighs eight times as much,
and it is probable that he could not lift
his great weight. The same analysis ap-
plies to tumblers but not to jumpers
or pole vaulters because these athletes
do not have to cover distances or
heights proportional to their own di-
mensions. Almost obviously a tall man
has an inherent advantage in jumping;
certainly a four foot man could not
clear five feet in a high jump but our
mythical eight footer could almost step
over a bar five feet from the ground.
The Running Races
Here we must consider the difference
between power and endurance. Take
the mile race for example. Other things
being equal, the large man can exert
eight times as much horsepower as the
small one. This uses up the oxygen in
the blood and requires eight times as
much blood to be pumped per minute,
but the big guy's arteries are only four
times as large; hence insufficient blood
supply. Moreover the blood is restored
by the fact that in the lungs, it comes
into contact (or near contact) with the
oxygen of the air, but the larger man
has only four times the lung area of
the smaller one and consequently tires
more quickly. In the sprint races,
the longer stride of the tall man gives
him an advantage and in football sheer
weight and strength are important.
Moral
The moral of the above is consider
your squares and cubes in your engi-
neering work. It may save costly mis-
takes or it may indicate the road to
improvement.

"cable" that piped oil from Great Britain to the Allied
forces on the European mainland. Paid out from
huge coils in the holds of ships,more than 20 flexible
pipelines were laid under the English Channel.
As the picture indicates, this "cable" comprises a
lead alloy tube, steel reinforcing tapes, steel wire
armor and jute wrappings. It's actually a submarine
cable except there's no core. Oil flows in the space
normally occupied by the electrical conductors.
The Okonite-Callender Cable Company was one
of four American wire and cable manufacturers who
together turned out 140 nautical miles of this pipe-
line. Experience in working with others to solve
special manufacturing problems is combined at
Okonite with years of research and development
work in electrical wire and cable improvement.

ice. One choice leaves open the possi-
bility of playing another season of foot-
ball for Michigan, while the latter pro-
cedure eliminates the chance of going
to school during a fall term. Either
way, Howard seems to be slated for a
tour of sea duty, after which he will
be able to follow all his original plans.
A senior in Aeronautical Engineering,
Howard is at present struggling through
five Aero courses plus M.E. 3, all of
which constitute an admittedly rugged
schedule. He is majoring in aircraft
structures, and admits that all the
theory he is forced to absorb wears him
down at times. Basic airplane struc-
tures, advanced aerodynamics, and the
mechanical theory behind these subjects
combine to make school a very busy
place for him.
Howard's talents, however, extend
far beyond his engineering abilities, for
he has proved to be very versatile in
his activities. His football record this
year is greatly admired by Michigan
sports fans, and his support out on the
gridiron made him one of the mainstays
of the team. He has been awarded two
letters in football, and if he could re-
main eligible he would like to be able
to stay at Michigan just to play foot-
ball. Being a senior, however, he prob-
ably will not have another chance to
play his favorite sport, and he regrets
that this is the case.
He is not only proficient in football,
but he has also played a good game of
baseball here at Michigan. He considers
sports to be a major element in his edu-
cation, and he has made good in all his
participations.
Unlike many of the Navy students
stationed at the University of Michigan,
Howard has exhibited an uncommon
amount of school spirit. Michigan is
both proud and happy to see its Navy
men contribute so magnificently to its
student activities.
Howard is a member of Delta Upsilon
fraternity, but his Navy curriculum pre-
vents him from spending much time at
the house. His campus and social ac-
tivities have also won for him an ap-
pointment to the Triangles society in
his Junior year and, more recently, the
coveted initiation to the senior engi-
neers' society of Vulcans.
In the recent campus elections, How-
ard was voted to be President of the
Senior Class for the fall and spring

terms, 1945-46, and he will also work
not only on the coming Senior Ball,
but also on the committee responsible
for getting out the Senior class an-
nouncements. This seems to be a great
deal of work for a boy with as heavy a
schedule as Howard has. His scholastic
record, sports achievements, and social
activities have won him an honored
position in his class, as he prepares for
graduation.
busy man
There probably isn't a person at the
University of Michigan who hasn't
heard of Charles Walton in some con-
nection or other. Ever since he first
arrived in Ann Arbor in June, 1943,
Chuck has played an important role in
campus affairs.



Chuck Walton.
At the end of his first semester here,
he pledged Phi Delta Theta—the fra
ternity that is second to none in his
estimation. By the end of his second
semester, he was a member of the
famed Engineering Council AND the
Union Staff! He increased his list of
activities by leaps and bounds during
the next two years. While still only a
Junior, he took the office of President of
the Engineering Council. He also acted
as Secretary of Triangles that year. He
now occupies one of the most important
positions open to Michigan men—Pres-
ident of the Men's Judiciary Council.
Furthermore, he is currently active on
the Board of Directors of the Michigan
Union, on the Student Affairs Commit-
tee, and in Vulcans. Each of the posi-
tions he holds requires a great amount
of leadership, and Chuck has shouldered
his innumerable responsibilities with
remarkable aptitude.
Chuck was born in Hackensack, New
Jersey, but he can hardly call it his
home town, since he has spent the major
part of his life moving from place to
place. The longest period he has lived
in any one city is nine years, and the
place was Ridgewood, New Jersey. In
his ramblings, Chuck had never come
west, so when it came time to choose
a college, he decided to explore the un-
known. He chose Michigan because
he felt he could get a good foundation
in mechanical engineering here. He
also confides that he came to Ann
Arbor "to see how the other half of
the country lives."
After receiving his degree in Me-
chanical Engineering this coming June.
Mr. Walton hopes to go on to Law
School. Although he has no definite
plans for the future, he feels that a legal
background will be invaluable. There
is also some indication that much of
the future depends on a certain young
lady, whose home is in Grand Rapids.
There is another outstanding cam-
pus organization that Charles Walton
has played an important role in. This
is the Engineering Honor Society.
Chuck says that the present system of
proctoring Freshmen and Sophomore
exams will remain in effect until the
students themselves request a change.
Under the present system, which has
been in effect during the course of the
war, Juniors and Seniors may vote to
decide how exams shall be conducted.
Naturally, these rules are all subject
to the ruling of departmental heads.
Every engineer should thank Chuck.
who, by his contributions to the Honor
Society, has helped to bring about the
very fairest exams possible during the
wartime period.
As a parting bit of advice, Chuck
says that students should get into as
many activities as possible. He believes
that the way to get the maximum out
of a four-year college program is to
take part in as many campus activities
as possible. If this is true, then Chuck,
one of the outstanding men on the
Michigan campus, certainly has received
the greatest possible amount of benefit
from his course here.

THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


YOUNG ENGINEERS OF AMERICA
To those young engineers who are in the service—
those who are at the drafting boards of industry—
those who are preparing themselves for the engi-
neering profession:
The "good-will" which attaches to a good name or
trade-mark has often been appraised at many millions.
For the public places reliance and trust on those names
which down through the years have proved they
will faithfully reward that confidence.
The products the public trusts are the ones they buy.
Where their heart is—there their business follows.
Such a tremendously valuable asset is not built up
overnight. It comes only after arduous years of toil
—of many disappointments—many triumphs and
achievements. And once attained—an equally
strong and effective effort must be constantly main-
tained to guard and protect the reputation thus
earned.
Quality of the product—standards of workmanship—
must be kept at the highest possible level—in line
with the famous name which it bears. Performance
in the hands of the user must live up to the highest
standards he has been led to expect.
Industrially, one of the great names in America—a
name recognized for its foresight, courage, progress
and leadership, is the name Timken. The whole
world moves forward on these advanced products.
You'll do well to learn the many benefits of Timken
Bearings. For Timken Bearings have indeed been
of prime importance in making life easier, smoother
and better for all humanity.
The Timken Roller Bearing is one of the basic factors
which made possible the efficient performance of
our huge war machine. It will be vitally important
to our vast peacetime economy at which the whole
universe will marvel.
In addition to Timken Bearings there are Timken
Alloy Steels used for many highly specialized ap-
plications and Timken Rock Bits which have rev-
olutionized modern mining and construction.
The Timken Company has spent millions in research
and technological improvements so that millions of
Americans may enjoy a better life—so that en-
gineers like yourself can rely implicitly on each
Timken product—each Timken recommendation.
Engineers have at their disposal all of the facilities of
this organization which is the world's foremost man-
ufacturer of anti-friction bearings.
This company offers unlimited opportunity to many
young engineers. Maybe you might like to come
with our organization. We will welcome applications
from engineers who feel that they may fit into a
company such as ours.
The old proverb—"Deviate an inch and you lose a
thousand miles"—is a sound thought for young en-
gineers to bear in mind. There is one thing as stead-
fast as the North Star—Timken Bearings are stead-
fast in dependable performance.
Everyone knows dependable performance is a basic
requirement of mechanized America. Millions of
wheels and shafts are turning faster, more accurately,
more freely, and longer, because of the inherent
qualities of this precision product.
It has been truly said that the trade-mark Timken
incorporates all there is in Bearings. See that the
trade-mark "TIMKEN" is on every bearing you use.

were again confronted with another
great problem at this point in the line.
A method for rapid centering of the
projectile was needed to retain fast pro-
duction. A special vertical-type center-
ing machine was developed and applied
to this flow line. After being centered
the projectiles pass on the conveyor
system to the rough turning operation.
This is accomplished by large vertical
lathes.
Following the preliminary operations
is the heat treatment. Old, conventional,
time consuming methods of "heat treat"
had to be discarded because the element
of time was of paramount importance.
First of all, the projectile had to be
heated for the "nosing down" operation.
This job presented another engineering
problem. Manpower was limited, floor
space was limited, and the time of heat
treatment was limited. Induction heat-
ing was found to perform very well even
under these conditions, and it was
therefore, promptly employed. A two
hundred kilowatt generator operating at
three thousand cycles supplies the nec-
essary high frequency to the apparatus.
Under this setup a projectile is heated
very quickly and then is "nosed" by a
two hundred and fifty ton nosing press.
The next phase of treatment is to
obtain maximum physical properties in
the metal, while retaining machineabil-
ity. Only excellent control produces
good heat treatment, and so control
was emphasized in designing this oper-

ation. Different batches of forgings
vary in chemical properties, and this
has made it necessary for the furnaces
to be adjusted for each batch. Here the
metallurgist plays an important role.
Courtesy Westingtiouse
Three dimensional models, accurate to
3 quarter-inch-per-foot scale were used
in planning the layout to save time.
Pilot samples are run through the setup
and then tested. The metal is etched to
determine homogeneity and microstruc-
ture. Properties must conform with
rigid specifications.
Forgings are conveyed through the
hardening furnaces and are oil
quenched. A maximum hardness of 520
Brinnel is secured on quenching. Tem-
pering reduces this hardness to 240
The oil in the quench is kept at the
temperature of ISO degrees F. by cool
ers. Agitators circulate oil around the
outside of the HVAR while sprayer
quench the inside. Tempered forging-
are cooled by air jets.
Another shot blast machine remove-
the scale which results from the heat
treat. Then comes the finish machining
The outside of the projectile is finish
turned and the nose chamfered by verti-
cal lathes. Large drill presses then dril
the base hole to correct dimensions
Again the manpower shortage had to be
considered and provided for. One
worker runs a series of drilling opera-
tions. Specifications require that these
rockets be accurate in weight within one
quarter of a pound. This has made it
necessary for an inspector to weigh
each projectile and record the amount
of its overweight or underweight. This
is compensated for in the cutting opera-
tions which follow.
The remaining finish cuts are made
by turret lathes. Since most of the
workers at the Canton Ordnance Plant
are unskilled, the setting up of the
projectile in the lathes has been made
almost entirely automatic. A tra\
swings over the conveyor, picks up the
part, and places it in the machine
Including chucking, this action takes
seven seconds. This mechanism is
operated from a 100 pounds per square
inch air line.

One of the many ways radar can serve aviation is by enabling the pilot to "see" through fog and darkness.
Radar- a "Moving Road map" for Flying
Pilots can now have an accurate radar
"road map" of the earth below—showing
landmarks and major details of terrain.
Radar will make it a whole lot safer to
fly at night or in stormy weather—as well
as in broad daylight.
This is only one of the many possible
uses for radar. For example, radar will
"see" icebergs or islands many miles away
—day or night—and enable ships to avoid
them. It will provide man with an amaz-
ing new "sixth sense"—and will be used
in a great many ways yet to be discovered.
RCA research and engineering played a
leading role in developing radar. Similar
research goes into all RCA products.
And when you buy an RCA Victor ra-
dio or television set or Victrola, made ex-
clusively by RCA Vrictor, you enjoy a
unique pride of ownership. For you know,
if it's an RCA it is one of the finest instru-
ments of its kind that science has achieved.

HOW RADAR WAS BORN
During RCA experiments at
Sandy Hook in the early
1930's, a radio beam was shot
out to sea. Men listening with
earphones discovered that this
beam pnxluced a tone upon
hitting a ship that was com-
ing into the New York harbor.
Later on the question arose,
"If radar could 'hear' couldn't
it be made to 'see'?" So the
viewing screen—or scope—was
incorporated into radar. This
scope is an outgrowth of the
all-electronic television svstem
that was invented and perfect-
ed at RCA Laboratories.

thread cutting. It is necessary that the
threads be concentric so that when
assembled with the motor, the projectile
will be true in flight. This precise
operation is done on planetary-type mill-
ing machines. The outside and inside

inches, are cut simultaneously.

HVAR projectiles pass from the draw
furnace to the air mist cooling chamber
where they are cooled to room tempera-
ture.
Except for heat treatment, the spin-
ner head receives the same method of
manufacture as the HVAR, whose pro-
duction has been described. Inspection,
degreasing, painting, and drying com-
pletes the operations; and off goes the
rocket for assembly with the rocket
motor and charging with an explosive
load. Any defective projectiles are sent
to the "hospital" where they can usu-
ally be repaired. All metal surfaces are
covered with grease to prevent corro-
sion, and the projectile production is
complete.
The Canton rocket projectile line has
indeed given the world an advancement
in methods adaptable to the production
of peacetime goods which will greatly
benefit civilization.
x-ray development
Just half a century ago, on Novem-
ber 8, 1895, a type of radiation was
discovered coming from an amusing toy.
the Crookes tube, which was to become
one of the greatest boons to mankind.
Wilhelm Karl Roentgen, an obscure
professor of Physics at the University
of Wurzburg in Bavaria (later a Nobel
prize winner in 1901) noticed a queer
ragged line on a piece of barium platino-
cyanide paper, which had been exposed
to no known radiation, but which had
lain near the shielded Crookes tube with
which he had been working. Denoting
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued from page 30)
the radiation which could pierce light
proof paper so easily as "X" rays (for
the unknown quantity), he prepared a
paper on the few facts he could gather
about them, and electrified the world
when it was presented to the Physical
Medical Society at Wurzburg.
The newspapers noted enthusiastic-
ally that here was a ray which could
see through anything, and drew numer-
ous cartoons about it, mostly humorous.
Some said that the rays could solve the
age-old problems of spiritualism, and
"ectoplasmic" photography. All this
publicity, as Roentgen foresaw it would,
effectively made his discovery public
property, beyond the reach of exploita-
tion by any one man.
Of all the radiations now known to
man, the x-ray is perhaps the greatest
single tool in his efforts to probe the
mysteries of the human body, the
crystalline structure of elements and
compounds, and the reason for muta-
tions in organic life cells. Foreign
bodies in foodstuffs can be rapidly
found and removed, blowholes and
other defects in castings can be detected
and the parts rejected, genuine art
masterpieces can be distinguished from
fakes, all with the aid of the x-ray.
Up until a few months ago, exclud-
ing secret wartime developments, the
highest power x-ray device was a mil-
lion volt adaptation of the Coolidge
tube, first perfected by Dr. William D.
Coolidge, of the General Electric Com-
pany, and named for him. This size
tube, along with its smaller 800,000,
400,000. and 140,000 volt cousins finds
use in all the large hospitals of today as
well as in numerous industrial plants.
PYREX GLASS
ENVELOPE
A recent development, result of long
research, is the 2 million volt machine.
This unit is composed of a low-fre-
quency resonance transformer, and a
multi-section x-ray tube. The use ui
glass to fernico welds made this giant
possible, which speeds electrons on their
way to the target through 24 stages,
averaging 83,500 volts per stage. This
new heavyweight is already finding
uses in medicine and metallurgy, les-
sening the exposure time compared to
the million volt unit by as much as
60 to 1 in some instances.
The present day commercial x-ray
tube consists of an electron emitter,
usually a tungsten filament, a series of
accelerating anodes at high potentials
to give the electrons speeds approach-
ing that of light, and the anode, or
target. In some of the lower power
tubes, the accelerating anodes arc not
used and a focusing cup replaces them.
The electrons, when they strike this
target, usually made of tungsten, gener-
ate the very high frequency radiations
known as x-rays. For a long time, only
platinum was used as the target, since it
had an extremely high melting point.
Platinum will not stand prolonged over-
loads however, and tungsten, even with
an even higher melting point, has re-
placed it.
At the present time, most of the
publicity of the x-rays potentialities
have been directed toward the field of
medicine, and rightly so. Physicians
can gain definite pre-operative infor-
mation on the condition of most of the
body organs and structure. Dentists rely
on the x-ray to reveal deep-seated cavi-

ties, otherwise indetectable. But these
boons to medicine have been possible
since the advent of the earliest x-ray
tube. A phase of Roentgenology that
will increase in effectiveness with each
perfection of equipment however, is
physiotherapy.
Cancer, one of the most dreaded
diseases of man, can definitely be at
least helped, if not completely eradi-
cated by proper use of x-rays. The
largest problem to date has been the
protection of intervening tissue from
the scourging effect of the rays that
penetrate to a growth deep within the
body. With the low voltage tubes
•'soft", or fairly low frequency rays are
generated, and long hours of exposure
are necessary. As the voltage in a tube
is increased however, the frequency of
the generated rays also increase; these
"hard" x-rays give the same effect as
the softer rays in a much shorter period
of time, lessening the patient's discomfort
and decreasing the possibility of dam-
age to healthy tissues. Its uses are
multitude, and all branches of science
are continually developing new x-ray-
techniques or improving the old. Dur-
ing the war years, great strides have
been made, which only now are be-
ginning to be released for publication.

CUBIC FEET OF GAS
used industrially and commercially in year*
Prove

FOR over thirty years, the records show
there has been an increasing trend to Gas
for all industrial and commercial heat re-
quirements. The last ten years have been
most spectacular, use of Gas in these fields
having doubled. The twelve months ending
June 30, 1945 saw the staggering figure of
one trillion, four hundred fifteen bil-
lion, eight hundred fifty-three million
cubic feet of Gas consumed by industrial
and business establishments.
Nor was this due to war demand alone,
for a large percentage of this ten year growth
was attained before hostilities opened. Rea-
sons for this wide acceptance of Gas by
production managers and executives is seen
in the merits of this modern fuel and the
great advances made in scientifically de-
signed Gas equipment.
The characteristics of Gas that make it so
desirable to industry and business include
its speed, economy in unit and overall costs,
its precise automatic control, its cleanliness
and dependability.
The story of the many advantages of Gas
and the data on the specific type of heat
transfer equipment that will do the most
exact job is available from the Industrial
Engineer of the local Gas Company.

ATTENTION FRESHMEN!
Now that the semester is entering
its last few weeks all freshmen who
will soon complete a scholastically
satisfactory first semester should look
forward to participating in the activi-
ties of their choosing.
Those who are near the border of
ineligibility, should take the time now
to look over their records, and then do
the extra work required to raise their
grades above that level.
Many will ask, "Why participate
in activities and what activities shall
I try out for?" A freshman may well
ask himself this question as the vari-
ous organizations on campus begin
to look for new men to fill positions
next semester.
The question "Why participate in
activities?" is easily answered. In
fact there are a multitude of reasons
for such extra-curricular participa-
tion. One of the most important rea-
sons for a student working on some
activity is the opportunity for person-
ality growth and character develop-
ment derived from such work. In any
activity chosen, a certain degree of
responsibility will be placed upon the
student. He will have to prove his
dependability if he desires to advance
in the organization, and in so doing
will be improving his character as a
one word description of character is
often given as dependability.
If a student is to work his way up
to the top in his chosen activity he
must also develop the quality of lead-
ership. The ability to get along with
one's associates and to give them the
clear thinking and good judgment
necessary in any job, in college or on
a job after graduation, is of prime
importance in the search for success.
Personality is the quality of influenc-
ing other people, and participation in
activities provides this personality
growth so important to the success of
a student after he gets out into the
business world.
The representatives of industry
who come to this campus to inter-
view students investigate the scholas-
tic record of their prospective engi-
neering employees and also the record
of their extra-curricular activities. On
the whole, employers feel that stu-
dents who have taken part in some
activity successfully — publications,
technical societies, sports, etc.—are
likely to prove more valuable em-
ployees than those with a similar
scholastic record who have not taken
part in any activity.
At this point it might be well to
inject a word of caution. There can
be ''too much of a good thing." There
have been students in the past and
there will be students in the future
who are able to participate in several
activities and yet maintain good
scholastic averages. If you are one
of these students we wish you well,
but this type of student is rare and it
is. in our opinion, better to enter into
one major activity and devote all the
time you can spare to making a suc-
cess of your participation in that ac-
tivity.
A freshman is sure to ask. "What
activity shall I try out for?" Here
the answer is mostly up to the indi-
vidual. What do you like to do? Are
you an "organizer?" Then you may
probably find your place on the Engi-
neering Council. Class representa-
tives and representatives of the vari-
ous engineering societies are elected
each year to serve on the Council.
If you are interested in both tech-
nical subjects and journalism, then it
would be well worth your while to
try out for the TECHNIC. Both the
Engineering Council and the TECH-
NIO also offer you excellent opportu-
nities for establishing new contacts
with your fellow students, members of
the faculty, and men in industry.
You will probably belong to the
technical society of your department
of study. The A.S.M.E.. I.Ae.S..
S.W.E.. A.I.Ch.E., A.I.M.E., A.S.C.E..
and others all have active student
chapters on this campus. In addition
such groups as the Flying Club are
being reorganized after being inactive
for some time.
It would be almost impossible to go
into the activities available on the
campus as a whole. Some of you will
try for sports, either as players or
managers. Others will find their place
in the many musical organizations on
campus. The student governing body
of the Michigan Union has attracted
several engineers each year.
"Why and What?" is an oft-re-
curring problem. We have tried to
help you in the solution of this ques-
tion. We believe that participation in
some student activity will pay you
rich dividends in character and per-
sonality development and new friends.
We also believe that the ordinary
student is fully capable of "getting
in over his head." Give this participa-
tion your careful thought. Figure out
how much extra-curricular work you
can take on without seriously affecting
your scholastic standing, choose the
activity you are most interested in.
and give it your best.

official engine ring
The Engineering Council at a recent
meeting voted to retain the Official En-
gineering Ring. When an all-campus
ring was adopted last year it was de-
cided to keep the Engineering Ring and
thus Engineers would be able to pur-
chase the ring of their choice. The En-
gineering Ring has been recognized for
many years by graduates and seniors
as the symbol of graduation from the
Engineering College.
rotascope
Engineers, with the aid of a newly-
developed instrument, the Rotascope,
now are able to make any rotating ob-
ject appear motionless before their eyes.
The blade of an electric fan, or an air-
plane propellor, will appear to stand
still, even though they are whirling at
full speed, when the "optical engineer"
is focused upon them.
Developed for the study of airplane
propellors under actual operating condi-
tions, the Rotascope is the first instru-
ment of its kind which allows the con-
tinuous viewing of a rotating object at
any point on the perimeter (or path of
travel).
The new device is the answer to the
scientific problem for an optical system
capable of untwisting the light of rotat-
ing equipment before it is recorded by
the human eye. It eliminates the rotary
component of motion, but shows any
flutter or vibration of the moving part,
thereby making it possible for scientists
and engineers to make a thorough study
of the rotating parts of machinery. They
can see what happens to any of the ro-
tating objects while these objects are
under the strain of thousands of revolu-
tions per minute. Lowest speeds as
well as speeds up to 2,000 revolutions
per minute can be studied with the Ro-
tascope, while special designs can adapt
the machine to higher speeds.

The one-watt white bulbs will prove
ideal for a nursery, because their soft
glow is insufficient to disturb the

will be visible in his crib throughout
the night.
On the cellar stairs, it is expected that
the green lamp will be burned night and
day as a safety light. In the kitchen
it will be burned all evening, to prevent
accidents.
The new bulb screws directly into any
ordinary light socket in a standard al-
ternating current house lighting circuit
or, if the user prefers to plug it into a
baseboard outlet, it will be equipped
with a bi-prong base. Tests indicate
that the lamp will operate for at least a
full year, burning day and night.
The new bulb captures for the first
time the efficiency, coolness, and color
range of a modern flourescent lamp in a
long-lived miniature bulb. It contains a
mixture of rare inert gases and a pair
of electrodes. When electricity flows
through the circuit, an invisible ultra-
violet radiation occurs inside the bulb.
Instantly this radiation is transformed
into visible light by the phosphor crys-
tals which coat the inside of the bulb.
To produce green light, zinc silicate
phosphors are used. For white light,
the standard white chemical mixture of
zinc berylium silicate and magnesium
tungstate is used.

e/ saw ottr way ib fi'cfoty


Our troops, moving through tropical
forests, found it often necessary to cut
down trees of the tough teak family—
to make passage or perhaps to use this
sturdy timber for their needs. To saw
down these trees required a cutting
edge that could indeed, not only "take
it" but "deal it out."
Sawteeth or bits arc removable; they
must be extremely hard at the edge, soft
and ductile where they are attached to
the band of the saw. This calls for spe-
cially well controlled heat treating of
the part. Gas and modern Gas heat
treating equipment solve the problem.
On a circular track they run the gaunt-
let of 12 slot-type, ceramic cell burners,
emerging with exactly the qualities
demanded by their stern use. This fur-
nace, operated by a girl, can heat treat
2,000 saw bits per hour, is adaptable to
the heat treatment of many other small
parts, bringing to bear an intensity of
focused heat just where it is needed.
Conversely, in a mid-west plant, Gas
furnaces did a most successful job of
heat treating large hull castings of
tanks, 22 feet long and 10 feet wide.
That's a far cry from saw bits but Gas
takes both extremes in its stride. The
Industrial Engineer of the local Gas
Company will check over any heat
treating problem—and help put this
versatile, modern fuel to work solvingit.

Laboratory set-up of miniature power plant
miniature power plant
A miniature educational power plant,
designed to permit convenient study of
all operations of any type of industrial
or city standard power plant, has been
developed for use in laboratories of en-
gineering colleges. The complete, coor-
dinated unit occupies a floor space of
only 10 by 15 feet and stands approxi-
mately six feet high in contrast to a
standard power plant that would need a
two-story, half-block-long building to
house it. Total weight of the unit is ap-
proximately 20,000 pounds as con-
trasted to some 1,000,000 pounds a city
power plant would weigh.
Despite this diminutive size, the
miniature power plant embraces all
equipment component to its commer-
cial cousins, including two 20-kilowatt
steam generators, a motor with a genu-
ine "load," complete four-panel switch-
gear equipment, a condenser, miscella-
neous piping, and a foundation.
During operation, total power of 40
kilowatts generated is dissipated by an

traight talk about your
after-college job
No. 1. An engineer should find
out what he can do best
AS A COMPANY made up largely of engineers, we
il have observed a good many young engineers on
their first job.
One thing we have discovered is that each student
engineer will have a special ability in some phase of
his chosen profession. When given a chance to apply
that special ability in the right place, an industrious
man usually makes a good beginning.
More often than not however, the student engineer
is not sure where his special ability lies. Neither can
his first employer be sure. Temperament and person-
ality, we find, have as much bearing as university
training on what line of work an engineer should follow.
It quite often happens therefore, that while doing
productive work, a man will expose
latent talents which he, himself, did
not know he possessed.
J That is why
we think it is wise for a young grad-
uate engineer to go with a company
which will undertake to give him a
varied course in practical experi-
ence. It gives him time to "find
himself;" to determine what he
likes best, and what he can do best.
At The Timken Roller Bearing
Company, student engineers are
given an opportunity to work in
various departments of our business. While doing
productive work, they are watched carefully for the
development of special aptitudes. And in the meantime,
they get a broad and solid grounding in our policies,
products and manufacturing procedures.
■ Our course is particu-
larly valuable and interesting to trainees because the
operation of our business requires widely varied en-
gineering skills. We manufacture tapered roller bear-
ings for every industry. And we operate a large alloy
steel mill which produces high quality alloy steels in
a wide variety of standard and special analyses.
If you will soon be awarded a degree in Metallurgy
or in Mechanical, Mining, Chemical, or Electrical En-
gineering, and you would like to know more about our
plan, drop us a line now. The Timken Roller Bearing

break. The unit requires only a supply
of steam ranging from 125 to 250
pounds and source of circulating water
for condensing purposes.
A miniature plant holds an advan-
tage over a standard power plant. Usual
study systems employed by colleges call
for one or two field trips per semester,
during which classes visit the nearest
power plant. Because .of the small num-
ber of trips and the tremendous size of
the plant, each student receives a specif-
ic study assignment, sees only a part of
power plant operation, and thus misses
the overall perspective. A miniature
power plant, however, can be set up so
that each member of a class can watch
the entire operation at once.
fluorescent progress
Although not yet ten years old, fluo-
rescent lighting has achieved an amaz-
ing degree of success and popularity, in
both industrial and domestic applica-
tions. Research continues to provide, at
an accelerating rate, improvement in
this new type of lighting.
The first important variations from
the familiar cylindrical shape of fluo-
BRIEFLY
(Continued jrom page 6)
rescent lamps has appeared. A circular
lamp has been developed. It is an even
foot across and is rated at 32 watts.
Because of the high light output in a
small space and its symmetrical shape,
it removes the principal obstacles to its
use in portable lamps in the home. The
"Circline" is now appearing as the light
source in floor and table lamps and in
other specially-designed household light-
ing units.
New fluorescent lamps are longer and
slimmer. Four lengths—five-eighths and
one-inch in diameter — are standard,
from 3J/2 to 8 feet long. Their special
place in the lighting picture is for
showcase and decorative lighting where
long lines of low brightness are re-
quired. The electrodes are designed for
instant starting on high voltage. Long
lamps present a starting problem in hu-
mid air which is overcome on the "slim-
line" by painting a narrow silver stripe
on the outside of the glass to within a
short distance from each end. This me-
tallic stripe acts as a capacitor, facili-
tating starting.
The slimline lamp is slightly more ef-
ficient in turning watts into lumens
rather than the regular lamps. This is
because a large proportion of fluo-
rescent-lamp losses occur at the ends.
and with the slimlines, for a given
length, there is a smaller percentage of
loss.
Fluorescent lamp life and the specific
effect of starting is better understood.
As a result, fluorescent lamps are now
rated with consideration of the number
of starts. For example, the 40-watt
lamp has a life of 6,000 hours if it burns
12 hours per start. But if the lamp
burns 6 hours per start, the life is 4,000
hours; for 3 hours per start, the life is
2,500 hours. The efficiencies in percent
of initial lumens per watt when the
lamp reaches 70 percent of its rated life
are 70, 76, and 84 percent under the
three conditions above.
Fluorescent lamps decline about 15
per cent in efficiency during the first
hundred hours and then at a much
slower rate for the remainder of the
lamp life. Research now definitely
fixes the blame at another source. It is
caused by the low-wave length radia-
tion of the mercury-vapor discharge.
This short radiation has a damaging ef-
fect on the ability of phosphors to con-
vert invisible to visible light. The cure
is still not known, but at least knowl-
edge of the cause must precede the cure.

The doctor • • • in shirt sleeves
Many advances in medicine begin with the tireless
efforts of some doctor who literally rolls up his sleeves
and works intensively on some new medical theory—
a new method of treatment—a new medicine. ~ But the
doctor would he first to report that he could rarely
carry out this important work single-handed. * Estab-
lishing the value of a new medicine demands widespread
clinical experience. Thousands of cases must be treated—
studied—and evaluated. * Leading pharmaceutical houses
are ever ready to aid doctors in experimental medicine
through their extensive laboratory facilities and by pro-
ducing medicines in sufficient test quantities for mass
clinical study. * Medicine frequently looks to large
chemical producers to make basic drugs available to mil-
lions at low cost. It is as an important producer of
chemicals for pharmaceutical houses, that Dow shares
in bringing to final fruition the work of the doctor in
shirt sleeves.

On July 16, 1945, on a bleak, de-
serted plain in New Mexico, a new era
of our scientific civilization was born,
and on August 6, 1945, in the sky above
Hiroshima, its debut was announced to
the whole world. Even as the people
of the earth ceased to marvel at the
steam engine upon the advent of the
Model T and the first crystal set, the
mysteries of radar were replaced in the
public interest by the power present in
the infinitesimal particles of which all
matter is made. Atomic energy, in its
first useful, although destructive form,
was born.
Confronted by this new weapon,
against which there is no known de-
fense, the Japanese capitulated, and the
war ended. The saving in lives, as well
as in material, was worth a hundred
times the 2 billion dollars the U. S.
and British governments had invested
in the perfection of the destructive
violence of atomic energy; it now re-
mains to be seen through long careful
research, what peacetime uses can be
developed for this new type of energy.
"Atomic" engineering will take its place
with mechanical, aeronautical, and
chemical engineering in the familiar
curricula of modern colleges.
First, if such a thing as atomic energy
does exist, what is it, and how does it
differ from chemical energy? Any en-
gineer is familiar with the commercial
sources of power available to present
day industry. The energy in falling
water turns the huge generators at
Niagara Falls and Boulder Dam; thou-
sands of tons of coal burned annually
to produce steam which in turn can be
changed into mechanical energy. In
this latter case, according to the equa-
tion
C + O, = CO, + heat
coal liberates between 12.000 and 17,-
000 BTUs per pound. This is a definite
amount of energy and can be converted
to work. The individual atoms of car-
bon and oxygen are not intrinsically
changed however; after combustion they
are combined in a CO, molecule but
each may be recovered in its original
form by suitable chemical processes.
Furthermore, if carried out under lab-
by
TED CIER '47E
oratory conditions, the weight of the
coal plus the weight of the oxygen
which combines with it are exactly
equal to the weight of the carbon
dioxide formed.
Atomic energy however, deals with
the transformation of mass into energy.
Atoms or parts of atoms (neutrons,
electrons, etc.) combine with other
atoms to form new elements, with the
liberation of huge quantities of energy.
In 1905, Einstein, in his energy-mass-
motion relation, postulated that energy
and mass are interchangeable according
to the equation
E = mC2
where C is the speed of light. At that
time there was no experiment which
could corroborate his theories but recent
developments seem to substantiate this
relation. For example, it is now possi-
ble to bombard lithium with high speed
hydrogen ions to form helium.

atoms (actually x particles) has been

MORNING, SIR
By
A. D. MOORE
In Charge of Placement
Department of Electrical Engineering
There's no sure way to get that
job, but some ways stand
a better chance than others.
Editor's Note: "Good Morning, Sir"
is the second oj two articles which were
first published in the TECHNIC in 1935
and are now being reprinted because of
popular demand.
Some interviews are easy to obtain.
An employer's representative comes to
the campus, you sign up for an inter-
view, and that's that. At the other end
of the scale is an interview you seek,
and which takes place in the employer's
office. Let us talk about that kind. As-
sume that the employer has written to
me, asking for candidates. I dip into
my file of available men and select four
names. Maybe I really found six who
might qualify, but only four have com-
plied with the well-published request
for filing personal records; two others
have not, and are often passed by for
that reason. Why? If a man will not go
to a small amount of trouble to partici-
pate in a plan erected entirely for his
own benefit, how can I believe he will
take care of an employer's interests in
any better style?
Next, having the typed records at
hand, I can make sure the four are
qualified, with no loss of time. Dupli-
cate letters are now sent to the men,
apprising them of the opening, and
giving the essential facts of the case. At
the same time. I write to the employer,
and at least tell him the names of the
men he may expect to hear from. If I
have time—and often I don't—and if
the occasion may warrant. I may also
discuss each man in the letter to the
employer.
It is now up to each man to tele-
phone the employer for an interview
date; or, to write a request for that
privilege. If the request is by letter, the
candidate includes a copy of his per-
sonal record.
Assuming you are granted an inter-
view, you get there ahead of time. In
the next twenty minutes you decide your
fate. I assume you have already learned
(forgive these personal details) that
pants look better when pressed; that a
recent shave improves any male of col-
lege age or over; that finger nails need
cleaning as well as cutting; that there
is at least once when it is well to sit up
straight and favor the other fellow with
a few direct looks—which is right now.
The employer has usually had some
practice at interviewing, and he will
probably lead the conversation. To any
questions, give direct and clear replies.
If he dangles an opportunity for you
to run off at length on some tangent,
be wary. Perhaps he is looking for that
very trait. You came here about this
job, and not to issue a half-hour alibi

for the football team. Of course, if it
appears that he really wants to take
time out to discuss football, skeet shoot-
ing, or the soy bean crisis, let him have
his way and even contribute to the sin.
But be careful.
Don't ever make the mistake of as-
suming that all employers are inter-
view experts. Some certainly must find
interviewing quite a trial. When the poor
man seems hesitant about prying into
your qualifications, he may need help.
Take the lead and tell your story to
the best of your ability—keeping your
twenty minutes in mind. He is a busy
man, but kindly and courteous. He may
make it easy for you to overstay, but
will take sharp and secret objection to
any serious transgression. If you err on
the safe side by attempting to leave too
soon, he will hold you; don't worry
about that. If he keeps you all morning
and then takes you out to luncheon, it
is a safe assumption that matters are
going rather well. But look out for
luncheons. It will then be too late for
any thing but regrets, if you do not al-
ready know how to handle yourself at
table. This does not finish our discus-
sion of interviews; we will have to come
back to it later on.
How You Can Fit In
You are about to graduate; it is cus-
tomary for graduates to secure employ-
ment and make a living; therefore, you
propose to follow custom. Well, no grad-
uate is ever handed a job on that basis.
The hard cold world doesn't care a
whoop whether you, individually, get a
job or not. The only reason you will
ever be hired is because you have con-
vinced some employer that it will pay
to take vou on. Now. it is true that a

group of men each year, the only im-
mediate concern being that each man be
desirable. The company is big enough
to use any one man later, in almost any
line along which he may develop. That
is campus recruiting: you can learn of
it here, first-hand. It is quite a different
story when you approach an employer
who has no jobs open.
You make such an approach because
this is one company you would like to
be with. You secure an interview. The
employer is glad to look you over, at
least. Now get this picture: that morn-
ing he, the chief engineer, has had a
dozen telephone calls, a third of which
call for decisions. His patent expert was
in a while ago to raise a question he
will have to settle, and he doesn't know
the answer. Nobody knows the answer.
Shortly before you arrive, a report is
dumped on his desk, calling for a close
decision as to whether to spend fifty
thousand for scrapping old machinery
and buying new. His wife is on the
telephone, asking him to help guess
whether little Philbert's temperature is
due to scarlet fever, indigestion, or
cussedness inherited from the father's
side. And then you walk in. He didn't
ask for you in the first place. He cannot
use you now. Unaided, he can't see
where he might use you six months
hence. If you simply appear as a large,
blushing graduate who wants to work
for him, all you are doing is to hand
him one more vexing problem he can't
find the answer to. Did you just re-
mark Uhat such a chief engineer's morn-
ing is rather unusual? Well, maybe you
are right; many of his mornings are
easier to get through than this one.
Doesn't it become rather clear that
under such circumstances, you had bet-
ter come prepared to help him solve
your problem? It is possible for you to
come to the interview knowing a great
deal about the company's products:
advertisements, trade journal articles,
gossip, friends—there are many possible
leads. You learn that certain products
have not switched over to welding—
which is one of your preferential inter-
ests. You are prepared to suggest that
you might be taken on in any capacity
whatever, just so you could learn still
more of welding problems and needs,
and could soon be of value in the ap-
plication of wedding.
Some of his Company's products are
intricately shaped. You have learned
that diecasting is used to the limit, but
that apparently plastics have been left
alone. You learned something about
plastics in college, and have picked up
a good deal more from recent publica-
tions. You do not rudely take the gen-
tleman to task for not having lost his
head over plastics, but you do find a
chance to say how fascinating it would
be to have a job where such adaptations
might work well and save money.
Of course, all such preparation may
usually miss the mark. As long as you
are an outsider, you may never be able
to smoke out a thing the company isn't
already alive to and worried about. The
point is, that the employer will be pleas-
antly astounded to interview a recent
graduate who is thinking more of the
employer's problems than his own. You
will not be hired that day; he can think
of no excuse for wedging you in. Two
weeks or three months later, that man
may call you long distance (provided'
you include your telephone number in
your record) and ask if you can go to
work next Monday.

c. e. prof
Earnest Boyce came to the University
of Michigan in October 1944 as Profess-
or of Municipal and Sanitary Engineer-
ing in the Dep't. of Civil Engineering
and as Professor of Public Health Engi-
neering in the School of Public Health.
His somewhat unique double appoint-
ment recognized the need for close co-
ordination between the work in sanitary
science given by the School of Public
Health and the work of the College of
Engineering. During the year that Pro-
fessor Boyce has been on the teaching
staff he has assisted with the U.S. Army
Sanitary Corps special A.S.T. Program
Earnest Boyce
conducted as a part of the war training
program of the University as well as
conducting undergraduate and graduate
courses in sanitary engineering subjects.
International developments have given
emphasis to the need for better sanitary
engineering and many foreign students
have been sent here by their respective
governments for instruction in this field.
After receiving his B.S. in Civil En-
gineering from Iowa State College in
NTS
1917, Professor Boyce saw service in
France as an artillery officer in World
War I. Upon his discharge from the
Army early in 1919 he was employed
for a time on highway construction in
Arkansas. In 1920 he joined the staff
of the Engineering School, University of
Kansas, where for twenty years he
served on both the teaching and state
service staff. For seventeen years he
was Chief Engineer and Director, Divi-
sion of Sanitation, Kansas State Board
of Health. In 1930 Professor Boyce was
granted the professional C.E. degree by
Iowa State College and in 1932 upon
completion of a year of graduate study
he was granted the degree of Master of
Science in Engineering (Sanitary) by
Harvard University.
In April 1941, he was granted a leave
of absence to act as chief consultant,
Water Supply Unit, Construction Divi-
sion office of the Quarter Master Gen-
eral. On July 1, 1941 Professor Boyce
accepted active duty as a Senior Sani-
tary Engineer (R) in the commissioned
corps of the U.S. Public Health Service
with rank of Commander. He served
continuously as chief of the Sanitation
Facilities Section. Division of Sanita-
tion, Office of the Surgeon General,
U.S.P.H.S. until Sept. IS, 1944 when
he was released from active duty to
accept his present position.
Professor Boyce's appointment fills
the vacancy created by the retirement of
Professor Wr.C. Hoad after thirty-two
years of service. It is an interesting
coincidence that this is not the first
time Professor Boyce has occupied a
position vacated by Professor Hoad.
Prior to his coming to Michigan in 1912,
Professor Hoad, as a member of the
Engineering faculty at the University of
Kansas, helped organize the Sanitary
Engineering State Service work and was
appointed the first State Sanitary En-
gineer of Kansas.
Professor Bovce is enthusiastic with
regard to the oppor
can be provided at the University of
Michigan through the close cooperation
of the School of Public Health and the
College of Engineering for the develop-
ment of an outstanding instructional
and research program in his special
field.
vice-president
Henry ''Hank" Fonde will long be
remembered as a sparkplug of Michi-
gan's 1945 football team. This mighty
mite contributed greatly to Michigan's
successes, with his brilliant running and
enthusiastic teamwork. His spirit and
initiative on the team have secured the
nickname "Fireball," for he has always
given everything he had into every play
he ran.


Henry Fonde
It is easy to give instances where
Henry's running has either begun or
added to a Michigan touchdown drive.
What was probably one of his most out-
standing plays in the Ohio State-Michi-
gan game was the run which began
Michigan's successful touchdown drive.
When the team got down to Ohio State's
goal line, it was Hank who carried the
ball over for the touchdown. Again and
again, in previous games, it was the
"fireball" who would break away for a
beautiful run, often for a touchdown
Consequently, Henry's football abilities
and spirit of cooperation have won him
a high place in the annals of Michigan
sports. It is indeed unfortunate that
he is a senior, for it is a lucky school
that has a fellow like Henry Fonde at-
tending.

'hat is expected of the college pro-
&gt;r? In most institutions much more
"full-time teaching." The admin-
tion expects the professor to teach,
:ounsel students, to do committee
t, to keep abreast of the times, to
uce research, and to grow in per-
lity and culture. In these ways the
inistration expects the professor to
fit the students, the college, and
:ty. The live professor wants to do
f this.
j teach well, the professor must
er continually the latest findings,
ugh local or distant libraries and
;ssional meetings, and must reor-
K his material accordingly. To
courses up-to-date and to introduce
courses takes more time each year
the outsider thinks. Many sum-
are wholly consumed in working
tew courses with only a breathing
before the fall term sets in. Other
ners are the only uninterrupted
to do research. Yet often the col-
professor must do outside work
ig the summer to earn extra money.
Never does the conscientious teacher
take a long summer's holiday.
The administration wants the stu-
dents to have neither luxury nor pover-
ty, but time to cover the assignments, to
assimilate them and to develop mature
personalities. The administration does
not always seem to realize that the
teacher, too, needs time. If the teacher
must earn extra income, he loses that
time from research at least. To keep
the teacher from doing any research
would limit research to special founda-
tions. This would be a pity, since there
is great need for research, many college
teachers are fitted to do it, and teach-
ing and research naturally stimulate
each other.
The college teacher is no longer a
recluse, but a person who lives in the
real world. This is as it should be, be-
cause, so long as economic demands are
not too pressing, the world of ideas and
the world of reality naturally enliven
each other. Unless the professor has a
private income, however, he is subject
to continual financial restrictions. Often
he lacks money from the start. Typical-
ly, his parents lived more for things of
the mind than for money. He himself
has probably earned much or all of his
higher education, either as he went along
or repaying an educational loan after-
wards. Many a teacher also helps his
or her parental family. The average
male teacher marries late. His wife is
usually a college graduate, and, when
she has advanced degrees, she teaches
or does other professional work for need
as well as for desire. The couple has
only one or two children because they
cannot afford to have more. The profes-
sor and his wife contribute little to char-
ity and frequently are uncomfortable
about it. They have small or no margin
for war bonds.
According to studies reported in 1928
and 1929, covering more than 7000 fac-
ulty familes, the average number of chil-
dren is 1.5. In most of these families an
extra child means no insurance. Sick-
ness expense means no vacation fund.
The children must depend on education-

fatigue failure
Machine parts, such as connecting
rods, axles, and crankshafts, are always
subjected to varying stresses, and a
great deal of study has been necessary
to analyze and to understand the be-
havior of the machine parts under all
possible operating conditions. It has
been found that under repeated loading
and unloading, producing cyclic stress
conditions, failure can occur with
stresses much smaller than the ultimate
strength of the material as obtained by
a static tensile test. This phenomenon
of lowered resistance of a material to
cyclic stress is called fatigue, and the
testing of these materials is called fa-
tigue testing.
A fatigue failure of a machine part is
the break or fracture that occurs when
the part has been repeatedly stressed
under a large number of load cycles. A
characteristic break consists partly of a
smooth surface, containing small con-
centric rings radiating from the outer
surfaces of the material. The remain-
ing area of the broken surface is rough
and crystalline. The popular notion
that the material failed because of crys-
tallization of the material is a fallacy.
Recent tests indicate that there is no
change in the crystalline structure of
metals under cyclic stresses. Rather,
there is a development of area of slip,
and of spreading cracks, until a frac-
ture takes place.
A perfect example of fatigue failure
is an arch bar of a freight car. Made
of medium-carbon steel, the bar was
bent and formed when red-hot. It is
used as part of the support between the
freight car and its wheels. When put
into service, the bar undergoes cyclic
stresses due to the vertical vibration of
the freight car. Under the influence of
a large number of these stresses, the
bar may reach its fatigue limit and
break. Examination of the break will
invariably show the smooth and the
crystalline proportions of the surface of
the break. In an actual break there
were the series of concentric rings
around points of the surface which a
blacksmith had notched to indicate
where the bar should be bent. When a
bar is undergoing tensile stress, and
a notch or scratch is impressed into the
metallic part, the original tensile force
must be supported by a slight decreased
area. Considering the overall area of
the arch bar in this case, the percentage
decrease in total area is quite small.
However, in the small area around the
notch, a tensile force is being supported
by a greatly decreased area. Conse-
quently, high stress concentrations are
produced. When the bar experiences
vibration, or cyclic stress, the high
stress concentration at the peak of the
notch in the bar may exceed the limits
of the material, and will cause the part
to progressively fail. These failures, be-
ing at first minute and insignificant, will
naturally follow along planes of weak-
ness within the material. Two or more
notches or scratches merely multiply
this failure, until the tensile force
carried by the whole bar is larger than
that which can be supported by the
greatly decreased working area of the
bar. Or, in the same manner that a
strong, brittle material will easily crack,
a momentary increase in tensile force
may cause the final break in the bar
long before its ultimate strgenth is
reached.
Although fatigue failure always oc-
curs in the same procedure, namely,
progressive failure at high stress con-
centration points, there are four general
causes for the existence of these danger
points. They are the design of a ma-
chine part, its fabrication, its metallur-
gy, and any mishandling which it re-
ceives in service.
When a machine part or construction
piece is being designed, the designer may
not know much about the working con-
ditions and the loading under which the
part will operate. Consequently, he will
utilize a large "safety factor" in design-
ing the part. That is, a piece of ma-
chinery with a safety factor of three is
designed and constructed so that it will
operate satisfactorily under three times
its estimated working load. This safety
factor merely displays the ignorance
which prevails in the designer's mind as
to the ultimate disposition of the fin-
ished machine.
Unfortunately an increase in size and
weight does not always result in a satis-
factory solution to the problem of de-
sign. A large locomotive drive rod, op-
erating at high speeds, would fail more
rapidly due to the accelerations of the
engine and the weight of the rod rather
than any cyclic stresses which would
occur. However, it has been found
through experience that a properly de-
signed rod of I-beam cross section func-
tions more economically and more safe-
ly than a rod with the same overall
dimensions, but of rectangular cross
section. Many times a part can be
greatly strengthened by designing it
with fillets of maximum possible radius.
Bolt and thread design improvements
have greatly strengthened and length-
ened their service. In a few cases, as
in undercutting a fillet in a bold-head,
the removal of metal has resulted in an
improved product.
Fabrication difficulties which result
in weakening the fatigue strength of
machine parts are due to errors in in-
terpreting the design of the part, or be-
cause of faulty handling and incorrect
metallurgical treatment in the shop.
Fillets may be incompletely specified,
and the machinists may make wrong
choices in cutting out parts. Whenever
a piece of material is welded or brazed.
it must be immediately annealed, or
otherwise heat-treated. Improper or in-
complete treatment in this manner will
greatly shorten the part's life in service.
Likewise, dropping, tool marks, tearing,
and careless machining will all reduce
the machine part's effectiveness in the
finished product.
Heat treatments %&gt;art from the nec-
essary welding for fabrication constitute
the metallurgy of the finishing of me-
tallic objects. Ordinarily, surface-hard-
ening heat treatments are utilized to
prevent excessive wear or corrosion on
the part. Today, however, controlled
surface-hardening is being employed to
increase the fatigue strength of highly
stressed machine members, in conjunc-
tion with wear and corrosion resistance.
This procedure was developed because
the surface of any metal is naturally a
stress-raiser, the crystals in the outer
layer not being surrounded by adjacent
crystals.
In a surface-hardening treatment for
increasing the fatigue life of metal
parts, these objects are first carburized
in a conventional manner. The pieces
are then quenched and subsequently
annealed partially. The carburized coat-
ing, upon quenching, was changed to a
martensitic material, which occupies a

81/-: million electron volts apiece. The
mass of the particles on the left hand
side of the equations is 8.0241 units,
but the mass of the two helium particles
is only 8.00S6. In other words, .0185
units of mass has disappeared and 17
million electron volts of energy has ap-
peared. (The energy of the incident
H atoms is neglected since it is com-
paratively small). Now the .0185 units
of mass is equal to 3.07 X 10~26 grams,
and 17 mev is equal to 27.2 X 10-6
ergs. If C, the speed of light is taken
as 3 X 1010 cms/sec, we have,
E = 27.2 X 10"° ergs
mC = (3.07 X 10-26)(3 X 1010)2
= 27.6 X 10-8 ergs
which is a close enough approximation
to indicate that this relationship be-
tween mass and energy is the correct
one.
It can be seen therefore, that in an
'atomic" reaction, none of the original
reactants can be recognized in the prod-
ucts; furthermore, the laws of conserva-
tion of energy and mass no longer hold,
since matter is destroyed and energy
created. Also, for an extremely small
quantity of matter, unbelievably large
quantities of energy are produced.
The second important question is,
granted the presence of tremendous
power in the atom, how is it obtainable?
Since 1939, when E. O. Lawrence of
Cal. Tech. developed the cyclotron, ex-
tensive research has been carried out,
both in this country, and abroad, on
the behavior of various elements when
bombarded with hydrogen ions, &lt;x par-
ticles (helium nuclei), high speed elec-
trons, etc. The hydrogen ion-lithium
reaction has been known for some time,
in fact almost all of the known elements
have been made to split up into other
elements with the release of energy.
There was one very serious drawback
however. The amount of energy re-
leased by these atomic transformations
was never more than a very small frac-
tion of the energy that had to be sup-
plied to the bombarding particles and
hence the efficiency of the processes was
practically zero. However, much valu-
able information was obtained about
how the different elements reacted under
bombardment.
It was inevitable that uranium, the
heaviest known element, should come
under the scrutiny of the scientists car-
rying out these experiments. In 1939.
Hahn and Strassman discovered that
uranium, when bombarded with neu-
trons, would occasionally undergo a
curious transformation, splitting into
two new elements and at the same time
emitting two or three secondary neu-
trons. This was of the greatest basic
importance. It indicated that it might
be possible for a self-sustaining chain
reaction to exist, since the splitting of
each uranium atom (called "fission")
gave rise to neutrons, each of which
could cause further fission in other
uranium atoms.
This discovery narrowed the field of
possible elements which might take part
in a chain reaction. To date, only
uranium is known to produce more neu-
trons on splitting than are required for
fission to take place. Research was
speeded up by the declaration of war.
and the possibility that atomic energy

Release of atomic energy depends on
the phenomenon known as fission. A
neutron moving with the right velocity
strikes a uranimun 235 atom (or pluron
ium atom), which breaks up into two
middle-sized atoms whose total masses
are very slightly less than the mass of
the disintegrating atom. The difference
appears as a whale of a lot of energy,
according to the Einstein law of mass
and energy equivalence.
might have a military use. Many facts
about the reaction of uranium to neu-
trons of different velocities were discov-
ered and correlated into data from
which various predictions could be
made. Before stating these facts how-
ever, it would be wise to define here a
new term which is peculiar to the sci-
ence, the relative ''cross-section" of ura-
nium when subjected to neutronic
bombardment. This term has no physi-
cal meaning, but is rather a "measure
of probability" that a neutron will col-
lide with a uranium atom. The larger
the probability that a collision will
occur, the greater the "collision cross-
section." The same relation is applied
to probable fission and "fission cross-
section" and probable absorption and
"absorption cross-section" since colli-
sion or absorption (which will be ex-
plained later) may occur without fission.
The facts then, were these:
(a). When subjected to bombard-
ment by "fast" neutrons, all isotopes of
uranium have a very large "collision
cross-section" but a rather small "fission
cross-section." In other words, fast
neutrons have a high probability of col-
liding with uranium atoms, but usually
only lose some of their kinetic energy
and do not cause fission.
(b). To medium speed neutrons,
Uranium;,,, exhibits a high "collision
and fission cross-section," the products
of this fission being an atom of barium
and an atom of krypton plus two or
three high speed neutrons, accompanied
by the release of large quantities of
energy. (U235 is a rather rare isotope of
uranium, occuring only once in 140
parts of the commoner isotope, U^g).
Ordinary U^g still exhibits a small "fis-
sion cross-section."
(c). Very low speed neutrons cause
no fission in either U235 or U2S8 but are
easily absorbed by the latter with the
formation of new elements, never found
in nature. This was another important
revelation. U238 absorbs a slow neutron
and forms U239, an unstable isotope of
uranium which has a half-life of about
twenty minutes, emitting a high electron
and forming a new element Neptunium,
the 93rd element. Neptunium itself is
unstable, with a half-life of two days,
and emits another high speed electron,
becoming Plutonium, with an atomic
number of 94. This is illustrated below.
U2ss + neutron -» U,39
U239 20 mla NpM9 -f- hi'speed electron
NPsso'2 d,y* Pu2:i9 + hi speed electron
Pu239 —» quite stable
Plutonium is an entirely different
element than uranium and can be separ-
ated from it chemically. Its physical
properties are much similar to U,^
however, inasmuch as it undergoes fis-
sion with medium speed neutrons with
the formation of two new elements and
several high speed neutrons.
Here now we can begin to see the
prerequisites for obtaining atomic en-
ergy. First, it must be self-sustaining,
requiring the application of no external
energy. Secondly, to be self-sustaining,
it must consist of essentially a fission
reaction, in which several neutrons are
produced for each fission that takes
place. Only U235 and Pu239 seem to be

Sparkling pans, pressure cooker, tableware, shining sink

imparted these prized qualities to the steels of which they
are made.

powerful influence it exerts upon steel. Most of the
alloy steels relied upon today for beauty, durability,
and resistance to heat and corrosion now contain this
interesting element.
Many years ago Units of Union Carbide discovered
how to extract chromium from its native ore. They
since have been constantly at work on the ever grow-
ing list of chromium alloys and their uses.
Union Carbide does not make or fabricate steel.

spite the fact that, according to the same
studies, 75% of faculty familes supple-
ment their income by an average of
SI000 to $2000 a year. They do this
by additional teaching in summer school
or in neighboring institutions, by lec-
tures, by private lessons, consultations
or testing, by administrative work, by
writing, or by some combination of these
activities. More recently we saw pro-
fessors and professors' wives taking
part-time jobs in defense plants.
Professors, no less than other citizens,
are eager to help win the war and the
peace. Here the question is: How can
the professor be most helpful?
It would seem that many professors
can be most helpful by carrying on their
year, he is contributing less than he can.
Administrative work, likewise, can be
challenging, and can open up new per-
spectives.
Writing, which some administrators
seem to think should round out the pro-
fessor's income, reduces to three general
kinds, namely, technical articles and
monographs, treatises, and commerical
publications. Of these the technical ar-
ticles and monographs cost the profes-
sor money for typing and often for print-
ing, usually bring in no money. A trea-
tise costs several hundred or a thousand
dollars to prepare and perhaps as much
again to print, and commonly returns
negligible, if any, royalties. Commercial
publications include popular articles.
popular books, manuals for industry,
and textbooks. Many of these publica-
tions are useful not only for the con-
sumers but also for the professor in
helping him to make his ideas clear.
Nevertheless, the commercial publica-
tions take valuable time. Even the pro-
fessor who attempts to put out his best
unpublished work in a "textbook" in-
stead of articles and monographs may
learn from the prospective publisher
that "textbooks do not ordinarily con-
tain new material. Furthermore, text-
books must fit established college
courses." Thus the professor comes to
understand why to write an ordinary
textbook is to market rather than to
develop knowledge. He perceives that
textbooks, like the other commercial
publications, too often must be mere
potboilers.
The professor realizes that the re-
cent depression and the war seriously
affect the college budget and burden
the administration. He realizes, too.
than many people have suffered in the
depression, and that many suffered
and died in the war. He knows that
he is far more fortunate than other and
no-less-deserving men. So long as his
own institution is not too hard hit, he
marvels at his relative security, his fa-
vorable surroundings, his stimulating as-
sociations, and his opportunity for sig-
nificant work. Apparently typically, he
feels obligated to re-examine his objec-
tives and techniques, and to do much as
he can.
His increasing costs of living, how-
ever, turn his attention from his work to
his financial situation. How his work
suffers in consequence has been shown
in Ridendo Dicens Verum's survey of
"The Salary Situation at Quaelibet Uni-
• versity," in the Autumn, 1944 issue of
this BULLETIN. Professor "Verum"
concludes, quite properly, that unless
colleges and universities "can restore the
real income of their staffs to a level
comparable with other social groups
corresponding to prewar relationships,
young men and women of promise and
outstanding ability will turn to other
pursuits and thus make it impossible
for educational institutions to maintain
faculties of competence and distinction."
Despite the popular impression, pro-
fessors are of many types and combina-
tions of types if, indeed, we can speak

of types at all. For our present pur-
poses, however, we shall consider pro-
fessors and their work relative to three
broad interests which are familiar to
the general population, though the first
of these interests applies very little to
professors. The three interests we shall
call material success, the life learning,
and a balanced life, respectively.
Material success means a comfortable
home, good clothes, expensive trips, va-
cations, superior schools for the chil-
dren, and social prestige; though it
means these several things in various
proportions for various devotees of this
interest. In any case, as we are using
the term here, material success means
not merely material reward; indeed, it
may not mean reward at all. It means
material enjoyment and, likely, material
eminence, well above the ordinary.
The life of learning means the intel-
lectual life, the love of truth, and the
urge to increase knowledge both for it-
self and to make men free; again in
various proportions for various devotees.
Ideally, this interest is free from the
urge to stand out above other individ-
uals.
A balanced life means one's vocation
combined with a normal personal life.
For the professor it means the life of
learning combined with a normal per-
sonal life.
Many persons are so devoted to ma-
terial success that they never enter the
teaching profession, knowing that little
material success lies that way. A few
professors whose incomes are sufficient
nevertheless feel so keenly their own
lack of material success that they wel-
come the first opportunity to leave the
profession in order to make more
money; whereupon, according to some
of them, they "begin to live." Both
among the persons who never enter the
profession, and among those who leave
it as soon as they can, there are individ-
uals who could develop into good pro-
fessors. To do so, however, they would
have to develop the requisite knowledge
and skills together with a real interest
in the life of learning.
Some persons are so devoted to the
life of learning that they seem to care
for little else. By their own choice, they
neither marry nor are given in marriage;
they shun property as a burden; and
they live and die as consecrated media
of learning. Some of these devoted ones
contribute greatly to the life of learning.
Many, however, contribute less than
they should, because they are too little
nourished from the real world. Neither
they nor the administrations that hire
them should overlook the G r a e c o-
modern truths that to be a good man
or woman one must first be a good
animal, and to be a good professor one
must first be a good man or woman.
To be a good man or woman requires
a balanced life; and, ideally if not nec-
essarily, a balanced life includes family
life.
It is true that colleges and universities
do not hire men and women to marry
and have families; and it is true that
family cares often impede the life of
learning. Perhaps the most exquisite
and intricately proliferated forms of the
life of learning come from those who
have no family cares. On the other
hand, such precious forms of learning
are often more of the ivory tower, if
not of the asylum, than of life. Family
responsibilities may hold the professor
in from many imaginative flights and
intellectual tangents; but, given the
essential conditions, family responsibili-
ties are profoundly stabilizing, motivat-
ing, and enlightening.
Given the essential conditions, the
professor who has a family cannot but
feel, however blithely, somewhat at-
tached and responsible to humanity,
past, present, and future. He is re-
minded of what it means to be a young
person constituted to share in many
values, physical recreational, social,
ethical, esthetic, intellectual, religious.
He knows that to share well in these
values the young person needs knowl-
edge, even wisdom. He knows that
needed knowledge, to say nothing of the
wisdom, is not fully available from any
one professor. He knows that some
knowledge is more important than other
knowledge, both within the knowledge
which is available and within that which
is to be found out. Many a professor
without family responsibilities knows
these things too; but, other things equal,
and given the essential conditions, the
professor with a family knows them bet-
ter. Thus the professor's family life
helps him to understand, learn from,
and contribute to his students, his col-
leagues, and society at large.
The essential conditions for the pro-
fessor's family life include, obviously,
sufficient material reward. In these
times, unless the professor has an un-
usually large salary or a private income
he is faced with the dilemma: Shall he
ask for an increase of salary, or shall he
seek to earn money outside his job?
Either course has its drawbacks. The
administration, as we have said, is likely
harassed with economic problems; to
increase the salary of one professor and
not of all would seem unfair; and per-
haps the administration is not accus-
tomed to increase the salary of any pro-
fessor except at the point of an offer
which he has received from some other
institution. Perhaps, too, the professor
has not always been as co-operative as
he might have been to avoid duplica-
tion of courses and to reduce other
academic wastes. Moreover, in a calling
not aimed at material success, it goes
against the grain to beg for more pay.
Thus the professor may feel at once too
sympathetic, fearful, and embarrassed
to ask for an increase of salary.
On the other hand, to seek to earn
money outside his job seems likewise
disloyal. The professor's training has
been expensive, and he has been hired
for full-time work. Like woman's work
and many another job, his work is never
done. Ideally, he learns to be content
in doing what he can. He remembers,
too, that in wartime many individuals
must sacrifice their personal interests,
even their lives, for the larger good
Often he wonders whether he is evading
responsibility by staying within his aca-
demic work. Unless some special need
for him appears outside, however, he i&lt;
likely to conclude that his academic
work is most essential for society now
and in the years to come.
If the professor's work is most essen-
tial, and we believe it is, it should be
furthered in every possible way. A little
practical work outside can strengthen
the professor's academic contribution:
but enough outside work to balance his
budget must sap that contribution seri-
ously. The answer would seem to be
increased academic salaries— if admin-
istrations can find the means. It would
seem that the means could be found
if the educational significance of the eco-
nomic condition of our profession were
understood and made clear to the public
Here is a question that should be of
concern to all administrators, all pro-
fessors, and all friends of higher learn-
ing.

YOU are looking at two bell-shaped
cathode ray bulbs mass-produced by
Corning during the war for military radar.
In most ways they are like the bulbs
Corning is now preparing to make for a
television set that may end up in your
living room.
And that's why television is nearer than
you think! Years ago television in its in-
fancy was the "father" of radar. Today, as
a result of development to meet war's
urgent needs, radar can more properly be
called the parent of tomorrow's television.
These bulbs are just one example of how
glass developed by Corning for use in war
will have an equally important place in
peacetime living. The list is long. It in-
cludes special "metalized" glass parts for
wartime radio and radar equipment. A

research achievements establish glass i
made by Corning as versatile engi
neering material with ever increasing •
possibilities. That's why it will pay you

practical at present; U23g, although fis-
sionable, has such a small "fission cross-
section" that the probability that the
neutrons produced by one fission would
cause any other fission is extremely
minute.
With these facts at their disposal,
namely that huge quantities of energy
were locked up in the atom, but could
be released in U23B and Pu239 in a chain
reaction, the men working on the atomic
energy project were confronted with
the problem of obtaining these elements.
As mentioned before, U23r, is present
in ordinary uranium ores only to the
extent of one part in 140, and must
be separated from the more prevalent
U.,,K in order that a chain reaction such
BSa
as is used in an atomic bomb be possi-
ble. Since chemically the two isotopes
are identical, separation by the usual
chemical means is impossible, and the
very small difference in weight is the
only characteristic which physicists may
take advantage of in separating the two.
There are three methods of separation
possible; the mass spectrograph, in
which ions of the isotopes to be separ-
ated are introduced into a magnetic field
and deflected by differing amounts (ac-
cording to their difference in mass) into
suitably placed collectors; the gaseous
diffusion method, which depends on the
fact that lighter molecules of a gas
will diffuse through a porous barrier
faster than heavier molecules; and the
thermal diffusion method. After exten-
sive experiments, the first two methods
were combined, uranium hexafluoride
(UF,,), a gas, being roughly divided
into (U23i,)F,( and (U23R)F8 by gaseous
diffusion and the more concentrated
(U23i,)F0 then introduced into the mass
spectrograph where it was further puri-
fied. The great difficulty in using the
mass spectrograph is due to using ions
of the elements. Only a small quantity
°f ^23r&gt; can be separated by one ma-
chine, and as a result several were built
and put into operation at Oak Ridge,
Tennessee.
At the same time that methods for
separating U2:&lt;5 were being explored, a
technical difficulty in obtaining a self-
sustaining chair reaction was discov-
ered. It was previously established by
experiment that U23n was split by me-
dium speed neutrons, and released extra
neutrons on fission. These secondary
neutrons were very fast however, and
the probability that they could cause
further fission in other U235 atoms was
small. A method had to be found by
which these fast neutrons could be
slowed up enough to be able to cause
fission. After consideration of various
"moderators" (materials which slow
down neutrons), graphite was chosen
as the most practical. It was believed
that if bars of uranium and graphite
were formed into a lattice work, the fast
neutrons which were the result of fis-
sion would escape from the uranium,
be slowed down in the graphite and
later reenter the uranium where they
could cause fission in any U^ atoms
they might strike.
Another consideration, the amount of
U235 necessary for the reaction to go.
was a critical matter. If the probability
that the neutrons would escape through
the surface of the material, be absorbed,
or merely collide elastically with the
uranium atoms was greater than the
probability that they would cause fis-

Plutonium is made by a four step process
in which a U atom absorbs a slow-
moving electron. The product emirs

sion, the chain reaction would soon
stop. The ratio of surface area to vol-
ume had to be kept small enough so
that the probability of fission within
the mass was greater than the prob-
ability of neutron escape through the
surface. A tentative size was mathe-
matically arrived at. from purely theo-
retical speculation.
Finally, in the fall of 1942, the ex-
perimenters believed that enough of the
problems which had originally faced
them had been solved to warrant build-
ing an atomic power plant. 12.400
pounds of pure uranium, containing
ing both U2;tr, and U23S were assembled
carefully in a roughly spherical lattice
work of graphite. At various locations
throughout the "pile," rods of boron
steel which could be automatically
operated, were inserted. The purpose

Hank was born and raised in Knox-
ville, Tennessee, and even now his home
locale can be identified by the easy-
going drawl of his conversation. After
he finished his high school education,
he entered the Navy, and completed
boot camp training at Great Lakes.
From Great Lakes he enlisted in the
Navy V-12 program and was immedi-
ately sent to Western Michigan College,
at Kalamazoo, where he completed his
first two semesters of college work.
Since June, 1944, he has been on the
University of Michigan campus.
Henry is a senior in Aeronautical En-
gineering, majoring in engine design.
Between keeping up a full schedule of
class work and participating in sports,
having earned a letter in football and a
minor in track, he has a busy time at
Michigan. Never a man to keep his
nose to the grindstone, Hank has been
enough of a social butterfly to acquire
a 'liberal' education which an engineer-
ing school notoriously lacks. He is a
member of Phi Gamma fraternity, but,
like other sailors, being at West Quad-
rangle prevents him from participating
fully in these activities. To add to the
honor which is his because of his ath-
letic achievements, he was elected to
the Triangles society, and more recently
to the Vulcans, the senior engineers'
honor society. Having also been elected
Vice President of the Senior Class,
Henry will end his college years heaped
with honors and pleasant memories.
Due to graduate in June, Hank will
receive his commission and then will re-
port for active duty in the fleet. He is
not yet certain of his post-Navy plans,
but he expects to build a career in Aero
Engineering. When he leaves Michigan,
he will be able to feel that he has given
a lot to the school's glory and traditions,
while he has received a good engineer-
ing education.
A perfect example of willingness to
co-operate with his fellows, Hank has
achieved tremendous popularity, both on
the Michigan campus and among Michi-
gan's football fans. A B.M.O.C., Hank
has undertaken, as part of his class-
officer responsibilities, to aid in the plan-
ning and preparation of the Senior Ball
and a Senior Picnic this spring. He re-
ports that all his activities, together with
a full semester's complement of studies,
keep him consistently busy.

of the metal. Since it still adheres to
the rest of the machine part, it follows
that large compressive stresses are set
up in the surface of the material. Par-
tial annealing is necessary to relieve ex-
cessive compressive stresses, and to pre-
vent brittleness, the vulnerability to
cracks in the metal. Since fatigue fail-
ure can take place only under the in-
fluence of tensile stresses, the heat-
treated part, when undergoing cyclic
stresses, will merely relieve its surface
compressive stresses, or at most will
register small tensile stresses. Conse-
quently, the finished parts are able to
hold up much better when in service.
The compressive stresses, called
"compressive surface residuals," can be
obtained by carburizing, nitriding. in-
duction hardening, flame hardening, and
by severe quenching. The increase in
fatigue strength which is derived by
these methods depends upon the resid-
ual stress pattern which is produced on
the parts. By carefully controlling these
hardening processes, and by exercising
a high degree of skill in quenching,
good results will consistently be ob-
tained.
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued from page 16)
Compressive residual stresses can be
produced in a variety of ways other
than heat treatment. A mechanical
method of improving springs is to "pre-
set' them: that is, to stress them beyond
the yield strength a few cycles. Thus,
when the load is removed, residual com-
pression will exist in the springs. Sim-
ilarly, springs, gears, and other parts are
improved by shot blasting, tumbling,
and sometimes by straightening, since
compressive stresses are developed in
the parts.
When the finished part is finally put
into service, surface damage by abra-
sion, cutting, localized overheating, and
dropping are liable to reduce the fatigue
life of the parts. Greater care, obvi-
ously, will prevent premature failure.
However, press fits of axles in wheel
centers, threaded or grooved parts, and
those subjected to surface abrasion pro-
duce stress conditions which can not as
yet be efficiently countered, since they
are necessary for operation of specific
machine parts.
Using photoelastic methods and
strain gage methods, engineers have in
recent years greatly augmented the
compilation of scientific data about the
fatigue of metals. As a result, metal
machine parts are being utilized more
efficiently and with much greater mar-
gins of safety.
radar in navigation
Radar which played a highly impor-
tant role in the war has been exhibited
in its postwar form when an electronic
navigator was demonstrated aboard a
maritime training ship. This device can
detect through darkness, fog, and storm
the position of any above-water obsta-
cles, such as light-houses, buoys, ice-
bergs, other ships and land, at distances
up to 30 miles, depending upon the size
and shape of the object.
This equipment operates on the radar
principle of radio waves which are re-
flected from objects and are measured
to give true bearing and distance of the
object from the point of sending. It is
predicted that the new device will revo-
lutionize "thick weather" navigation,
providing the mariner with an instru-
ment to plot a safe course, even though
his normal visibility is strongly limited
by natural conditions.

tron-absorbers, was to control the rate
of reaction. When pushed into the pile,
the rods would absorb so many of the
secondary electrons that the chain re-
action could not proceed; when pulled
out a critical distance, just enough neu-
trons would be present at all times to
keep the chain reaction going, and when
pulled out farther, the reaction would
proceed faster. Finally everything was
in readiness. On December 2, 1942. the
control rods were slowly withdrawn
from the pile. When they were about
halfway out, a radiation detector placed
near the pile flashed the news to the
control room, carefully shielded from
the huge amount of radioactive material
in the pile, that their hopes were justi-
fied. The first chain reaction in history
was taking place!
The Chicago pile was operated for
ten days at a power level of */&lt;&gt; watt,
and then raised to 200 watts. Higher
power levels could not be reached with
the inadequate shielding then available.
It must be remembered that this pile
was operating only through the agency
of the U.,;,.,: the majority of the pile
ATOMIC ENERGY
(Continued jront page 28)
was composed of the inactive U238. We
have already shown that U.,.,8 will ab-
sorb very slow neutrons to form Plu-
tonium and this is exactly what occurs
in a pile. Perhaps a short explanation
of this would help clarify its action.
A stray neutron from the atmosphere
enters the quiescent pile, striking an
atom of U2.&lt;r, and causing fission. The
high speed secondary neutrons, which
are a result of this fission, pass into the
graphite moderator and are slowed
down sufficiently so that on reentering
the block of uranium they cause more
fission among the U235 atoms. This is
a fairly rapid action and reaches equi-
librium quickly. At equilibrium, the
neutron products of fission are partly
lost through the surface, partly absorbed
by the controlling boron steel rods,
parti}' absorbed by the U,38 to form
Pu.,.,9, and partly collide with more U.,35
atoms to continue the chain reaction.
Aside from generating heat as a re-
sult of the uranium fission, the pile pro-
duces Plutonium which we have already
seen may be used as well as U.,.,-. in
atomic bombs. At the present time, all
the piles now operating in the U.S. are
producing Plutonium, while the heat
which may some day be doing useful
work, is being dissipated to the atmos-
phere. To extract the Plutonium, the
bars of uranium are removed one by one
from the pile, treated chemically to
remove the Plutonium, and then re-
turned to the pile.
And so finally, we come to the bomb.
As yet, full details are not available on
its construction, or the materials of
which it is composed, but with the in-
formation which is at hand, we can
make some general statements about it
(1). It is composed of Uo3S or Pu....
perhaps with a small amount of moder-
ator added.
(2). The total amount of the ele-
ment must exceed the critical size for
a chain reaction to take place.
(3). The U235 is not in one large
lump, but is separated into at least two
pieces, each smaller than the critical
size, which by proper mechanism are
capable of being rapidly forced together
into one mass larger than the critical
size when detonation is desired. The
reason for this is obvious.

"Metal Muscles" for Power and Control
1

ITiey simplify manufacturing
and cut production costs
One of the rules in engineering design is to use the
fewest parts that will accomplish a given purpose
—for that means the product can be manufactured
easier, faster and at lower cost.
Where your design calls for the transmission of
rotational power around turns and in paths other
than straight lines, the fewest parfs that will do the
job is an S.S.White flexible shaft.
This is also true for mechanical remote control. A
single S.S.White flexible shaft suffices for smooth,
sensitive control between practically any two points.
S.S.White flexible shafts are produced in a large
selection of sizes and characteristics in both the
power drive and remote control types. A knowledge
of the range and scope of both types will be helpful
to you in engineering design work. As a preliminary
step in acquiring this knowledge, follow the sug-
gestion below.

INDUSTRIAL
ATOMIC ENERGY
{Continued from page 32)
It has been a matter of considerable
discussion as to how far the fission of
the U235 proceeds before the tremen-
dous energy released has time to blow
the mass apart. Uncontrolled fission is
an extremely rapid reaction (as opposed
to the controlled fission in the pile), but
at the present time, no method of deter-
mining the extent of fission before dis-
integration has been published. Esti-
mates of the efficiency of the original
Alamogordo bomb do not exceed 3c'c
fission, but no later data is available.
Nothing has been said about the
terrific handicaps under which the ex-
perimenters in atomic energy labored.
The intense radiations from the piles,
stronger than all the radium ever mined,
necessitated thick shielding on all ap-
paratus: all work on the pile or in ex-
tracting the Plutonium had to be carried
on by remote control. Furthermore, the
pressure of war made long hours of
overtime necessary, materials were hard
to get until the project received top
priority rating, and there was always
the need for absolute secrecy. Nor
could the scientists be absolutely sure
of their calculations. For all they knew,
their brainchild might explode at any
moment, destroying months of work,
and a few scientists too. Future his-
torians will mark these men as con-
tributing one of the greatest scientific
achievements of all time to mankind.
It is difficult to foretell exactly what
civilization will be like twenty years
from now, but a few guesses might be
hazarded. Atomic piles will be im-
proved in efficiency and may eventually
be used as power plants; due to their
weight, including shielding, it is doubt-
ful whether they can be condensed
enough to be used in automobiles or
airplanes, however. Piles will probably
also furnish many types of radioactive
materials which will find use in medi-
cine, metallurgy, physics and the like.
Atomic energy is capable of a tremen-
dous amount of good, if used in peaceful
ways; turned to war. it can well wipe
out our thriving civilization and return
the earth to another Dark Ages.

apparatus showed, in the dead of night,
how it is possible for a ship to operate
safely and accurately through any kind
of thickened overcast condition. During
the demonstration in the waters off
Long Island, such objects as other ships,
lighthouses, and land masses were
shown in their relative positions, and
both distance and bearing were auto-
matically plotted on the face of the
viewing screen in relation to the ship's
own course. The distance of objects
from the ship was shown in true propor-
tion, being measured by a series of con-
centric "marker rings" electronically
super-imposed on the picture screen.
Basis of the "electronic navigator," it
was explained, is a rotating antenna,
located on the top of the ship and anal-
ogous to a searchlight, in that it sends
out beams to locate obstacles in the
ship's path. The difference, however, is
that beams from the radar antenna,
which are actually powerful radio micro-
waves, are capable of penetrating fog
and other atmospheric conditions with-
out hindrance. Moreover, they are sent
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued jrom page 31)
out as "pulses" or surges of extremely
short duration and at a very rapid rate.
As the radar waves locate an obstacle
in the surrounding waters, they bounce
off and are scattered, no matter what
material the object is. Some of these
echoes, or scattered waves, will return
to the rotating antenna, which also acts
as the receiving antenna during the time
intervals between the outgoing pulses.
After being amplified, these echoes are
made to appear as bright spots on the
face of a cathode ray tube, which is
somewhat similar to a television screen
tube. The image thus formed gives the
operators a "radar picture" of the obsta-
cle, and the marker rings tell him how
far away it is.
By controlling internal circuits, the
operator may change the scale of the
field to cover either a 2, 6, or 30-mile
radius. Thus, when a ship is sailing in
the open sea, the operator will use the
30-mile range until an object approaches
to within 6 miles. Then, by turning a
knob on his radar set, he is immediately
presented with a larger scale chart, the
outer radius of which is 6 miles. For
very close work another turn of the
knob provides a 2-mile radius chart on
which objects may be observed down
to about 200 yards.
Radar waves sent out from the ship's
antenna travel with the speed of light,
186,000 miles per second, and therefore
require only about a millionth of a sec-
ond to make a round t$p to an object
200 yards away. Since the measure of
distance to an obstacle is given with
extreme accuracy by the marker circles,
the system must be able to measure
time down to 1/100 of a millionth of a
second.
Despite the complexity of circuits
within the radar system, which such ac-
curate timing makes nepessary, it is de-
clared that sets are as easy to operate
as a large home radio receiver. A few
minutes instruction will enable an oper-
ator to grasp the fundamentals of opera-
tion, and in a few hours of practice he
can learn safe recognition of various
types of objects, as well as their bear-
ing with respect to the course position
of his own ship.

In the job conference with E. E.
seniors last year, the seniors were asked
to name some companies they had
thought of tackling. About ten com-
panies—all large—were rapidly nomi-
nated. I had with me a January trade
journal which was filled with annual
survey reports. One such listed about
thirty leading manufacturers, and
showed whether they had made or lost
money in the preceding two years. Eight
of the ten companies named had lost
money. A number of firms that had al-
ready climbed out of the red were not
mentioned. There are about six hundred
electrical manufacturing companies in
the United States. Why do great num-
bers of electrical graduates concentrate
their attention on the few? And isn't it
too bad, when at a given time, energy
directed towards getting into these few
may be almost entirely wasted?

Mr. Clifford A. Faust of Transit Jour-

fact that several hundred New York

the job hunters were finally placed.

of course, posted there. In addition, a
rather continuous parade of items is run
throughout the year. Many of the fea-
tures described in these articles are pre-
sented in one form or another. The
senior is given plenty of opportunity to
inform himself as to what is expected
of him in participating in our particular
placement scheme. When a significant
book appears, such as that by Lester
(mentioned in the first article), sales-
minded seniors are urged to read it.
About halfway through the year, the
bulletin board announces—
The Job Conference
This annual event is mainly for sen-
iors of the electrical department. Start-
ing at 7:30 P.M.. with about 70 men
present, it ends at 11:00 because we
have to go home sometime. It is an
open forum, devoted entirely to rapid-
fire questions and answers about the
very things these articles are trying to
cover. Should one return for graduate
work? Should he do so right away, or
get some experience first? Does a roll-
ing stone gather any moss, or anything
else? What about these training pro-
grams? What are present starting
rates? What to do when an outside
offer comes to a man already employed:
These are lengthy matters. The article
has no room for discussing them. If you
want to hear them talked about, you are
welcome to attend the conference. I
will offer to write about them in future
articles, provided a sufficient number of
readers will let me know their wishes.
Perhaps you had better tell the Editor
about it at the same time. It would be
up to him, you know.
Seniors—Live and Otherwise
The live senior will inform himself
on job matters long before his active
contacts begin. A large share of the
things he wants to know are common to
the whole senior class. It is out of the
question for any faculty member to find
time to dish out the answers to in-
dividual seniors. Hence bulletin board
service. And then comes the test. When
a senior drops in along about May and
innocently asks some question that re-
veals he has not kept himself posted,
and when discussion reveals the fact
that he first heard of the job conference
the day after it was over, we know we
are dealing with a man who has been
sound asleep. If he does not promptly
come to life and catch onto things in a
hurry, he may be in for a series of dis-
appointments for some time to come.
Keep In Touch
Soon after graduating, send a copy
of your personal record back to your
faculty placement officer. As soon as
you get that job, let him know. Get
out of the way, and let him concentrate
on your unemployed classmate. Once
a year or so, drop him a letter, bringing
yourself up to date. (Ask him to file
your letter without bothering to answer
it: maybe, if he has a spare moment,
he'll answer it anyway.) In a few years
he will have a complete file on you.
Since you will be one of the few who
really do this, he will reach for you
first when something nice shows up.
While on one job, if you ever decide
that you want to make a change, you
must be particularly sure to inform your
faculty member about it. He does not.
for several reasons, wish to bother you
with offers in the usual case. He should
and will let you alone when your present
opportunities are as good where you aro
as it seems they would be elsewhere.
Morever, your company will properly
resent it if we or anyone else are con-
tinually bringing offers to your atten-
tion. Experienced men know that a good
share of a year's productive effort can
be seriously upset, if full consideration
is given to but two or three good offers
a year. When you really wish to make
a change, tell somebody about it.

You just THINK you're
touching aluminum, mister!
Pick it up ... in your bare hands . . . any-
thing made of aluminum. Your cigarette
box. A saucepan. The foil on a choco-
late bar.
You're not touching aluminum. You
never have, never will.
The reason is very simple. Aluminum is
constantly covered with the thinnest of
thin "skins". It is Aluminum Oxide. You
can scrape it off, but it re-forms immedi-
ately. In a split second.
This—the scientists at Alcoa's Alumi-
num Research Laboratories learned many
years ago . . . but they didn't stop there.
They wanted to know what could be done
to this "skin" . . . how it could be made
thicker, thinner, harder, porous ... so that
Aluminum products could be more useful
and serviceable.
Out of this Alcoa research on the "skin"
of aluminum have come many new things.
Aluminum pistons of porous "skin", to
hold oil. Aluminum trays of lush lustre
that won't tarnish—ever. Colored alumi-
num—the color dyed right into the "skin".
Yes, Alcoa has found many ways of not
only controlling this "skin" but also of
making aluminum better and more versa-
tile in many, many ways . . . 1ml the search
still goes on and always will.
This search calls to young men of science
and engineering . . . and spells new oppor-
tunity to salesminded men of tomorrow.
The next time you pick up ... in your
bare hands... anything made of aluminum,
say to yourself, "What new could I make
this light, strong, durable metal do for
man . . . some day?"

smoke-free coaches
To secure a better share of passenger
travel, railroads seek to allow those who
smoke to do so, but without annoyance
to those who do not, and without having
to provide separate equipment.
The only known method of removing
more than a small percentage of parti-
cles as small as those that comprise
smoke is by electrostatic attraction. An
electrostatic air cleaner is shaped to lie
flat overhead just inside the head-end
door. All of the fresh and the recir-
culated air are passed first through a
mechanical filter that removes the large,
bulky dirt and then through the precipi-
tron to remove the fine particles. The
final product is relieved of mo
per cent of the total number
particles.

A VITAL PART OF YOUR TELEVISION SET WILL BE A VAC
...LITERALLY NOTHING!

That's RIGHT...nothing. A blank, an absence of anything
... or, technically, a high vacuum ... is all-important to
television.
For a high vacuum in a television tube is necessary for
control of the electrons that make television a reality.
The first step toward a high vacuum is pumping the air
out of the tube. But pumping won't remove enough of it.
Here's where a "getter" of barium, one of the less com-
mon metals, comes in—and more air goes out of circulation.
Inserted inside the television tube, the barium "getter" is
flashed from the outside by electricity. Instantly it vapor-
izes and entraps the remaining air.*
Barium "getters" were developed by Kemet Labora-
tories Company, Inc., in their research on metals.
Contributions by this and other UCC Units to television
and electronics do not stop here. Radio, radar, X-ray, hear-
ing aids and other electronic devices have also benefited by
the extensive research of UCC Units in the fields of alloys,
carbons, chemicals, gases and plastics.
*Barium has a high affinity jor oxygen end other gases. When the
"getter" is flashed in television or radio tubes, molecules of hot metal-
lic vapor combine with... and immobilize... remaining particles of
air. The barium, with the "captured" air is deposited as a silvery film
inside the tubes. . „
Most UCC products ... like barium "getters" are basic raw mate-
rials for American industry. Just about every business enterprise, from
the small corner garage to the largest steel plant, uses them in one form
or another. If you want a description of these products and how they

electronic fence
The fish in the state hatcheries at
Pennsylvania's famed Pymatuning Lake
reservation, near Linesville, are well be-
haved these days, since an instument as
modern as the radar used in military
operations is helping to keep the finny
tribe in line.
The new device, an electronic fish
fence, keeps the fish in waters where
they are protected, thereby saving mil-
lions of them for later '"planting" in the
streams and lakes of the state.
The screen or "fence," consists of one
or more rows of metal rods or strips
that serve as electrodes through which
electrical impulses are sent to set up
an electric field in the water. This elec-
tric impulse creates an electric force that
gives the fish an effective but harmless
shock and sends them scurrying back to
a safe area. The electric impulses are
produced at a relatively rapid rate from
the electronic generator, resulting in a
special wave form of electric current
that serve as electrodes.
At Pymatuning, the electric fence
prevents the fish from migrating to open
water.
The "fence" has other extremely prac-

being destroyed in the water intakes of

Radio relay toners, about 50 miles apart, will gradually replace thousands of miles of telegraph poles and wires.
Now, telegrams leapfrog"storms
through RCA Radio Relay
With the radio relay system, developed by
RCA, Western Union will be able to send
telegraph messages between principal
cities without poles and wires.
"Wires down due to storm" will no
longer disrupt communications. For this
new system can transmit telegrams and
radiophotos by invisible electric micro-
waves. These beams span distances up to
fifty miles between towers and are com-
pletely unaffected by even the angriest
storms.
When large numbers of communica-
tions circuits are required, these auto-
matic radio relay systems are more effi-
cient than the pole and wire system ... are
less costly to build and maintain. They'll
be particularly useful, too, in areas such as
China and South America where distances
are great and long-line services have not
been developed.
This revolutionary stride in communi-
cations was made possible by research in
RCA Laboratories—the same "make it bet-
ter" research that goes into all RCA
products.
And when you buy an RCA Victor ra-
dio or television set or a Victrola* radio-
phonograph, you enjoy a unique pride of
ownership. For you know, if it's an RCA
it is one of the finest instruments of its
kind that science has achieved.

by
JAN A. VAN DEN BROEK
Professor of Engineering Mechanics
Editor's Note: Address delivered before the
Structures Section of the A.S.C.E. at the an-
nual meeting in New York City on January
18, 1946. The author was awarded the Norman
Gold Medal of the AS.C.E. for his paper on
Limit Design in the 1941 Transactions.
The chairman of the Structures Divi-
sion of the ASCE has expressed a desire
for a "knock down and drag out" dis-
cussion of Limit Design, has re-
quested me to present the subject, and
has requested others to 'take it apart."
In order to assist these others in their
task I have prepared a manuscript to
be studied by them if they so choose.
If occasionally some of my statements
appear too strongly assertive, the rea-
son for this lies in the fact that I try to
stress the basic values which distinguish
Limit Design from other theories and
that I like to provide convenient handles
for those who are to take my arguments
apart.
I am expected to talk on Limit De-
sign as part of the theory of strength.
and this f shall do. This subject has
interested me for the last thirty years.
I shall be obliged, however, to bring
into this discussion philosophy, psychol-
ogy' and history, fields in which I lay
no claim to special authority.
What do we mean by strength? Some
of my former students come back to me
and proudly proclaim themselves as
stress-analysts. I smile at them and tell
them, since apparently they have for-
gotten my teaching, that stress-analysis
is a poor substitute for strength analysis.
This brings to mind a profound personal
experience. In 1914 I read Prof. Bridg-
man's article in the Philosophical Maga-
zine of July. 1912. entitled. ''Breaking
Tests Under Hydrostatic Pressure and
Conditions of Rupture." In this paper
he described, among others, the experi-
ment of having placed a bar of carbon
steel, or a glass bar. in a box with the
ends protruding. The portion of the
bar within the box was subjected to
hydrostatic pressure. As the hydrostatic
pressure increased sufficiently the bar
ruptured on a transverse plane. This
transverse plane of rupture is a plane
of zero stress. I recall distinctly how,
at the time, I regarded this Bridgman

Jan A. Van denBroek
experiment as the most significant single
engineering experiment of which I had
ever heard. I had been carefully nursed
to regard stresses as the safe and only
criterion of strength. The Bridgman ex-
periment shattered, with one stroke, my
faith in this myth, and it has remained
shattered to this day. I still regard the
Bridgman experiment as the most sig-
nificant single engineering experiment
ever performed.
Now, to come back to my original
question, "what do we mean by
strength?" I cannot speak for others
but by strength I mean the property of
a structure by means of which it resists
excessive distortions and functions sat-
isfactorily as it is intended to function.
As I take an aeroplane from New York
to Detroit I want to feel reasonably
certain that this plane, once it takes off,
will deliver me intact. As I cross a
bridge in a railroad train I want this
bridge to deliver this train in good
working order to the other side of the
river. As an engineer for a railroad
company I want more. I want this
bridge to provide passage across this
river with reasonable safety and com-
fort at minimum cost, and I want it
to continue so to function for a number
of years. What the stresses are in either
the plane or bridge, a priori, does not
interest me. Considering the present
state of aeroplane design, I would not
like the plane to start flopping its wings
like a sea gull, nor would I like the
railroad bridge to assume the shape of a
roller-coaster while I passed over it.
Either of these things might easily dis-
turb my sleep and, in fact, might dis-
turb much more than my sleep. I am
basically interested, as an individual
and as an engineer, in deformations and
am interested in stresses, if at all, only
to the extent in which they throw light
on deformations. It may be argued:
What about Hooke's Law which tells
us that strains are proportional to
stresses, and I might reply, what about
Poisson's Ratio which tells us that
strains occur at right angles to stresses
(witness the Bridgman experiment),
which strains are not accompanied by
stresses in the direction of these strains.
More pointedly I might say, what about
ductility which, if it means anything,
means excessive increases in strain with-
out corresponding increases in stresses.
I have stated that I would be forced
to indulge in some historical and psy-
chological reflections. Frankly, I am
suspicious of historians. It seems to me
that the personal equation, the subjec-
tive reactions of the historian which
guides him in sifting a near infinite
array of facts and determines his choice
of facts, is more important than the
facts themselves.
I thus feel hesitant to indulge in his-
torical speculation myself. I feel, how-
ever, somewhat comforted by the fact
that there will be men to take my argu-
ments apart as they feel inclined. Nat-
urally. I am as much interested as any-
one, if not more so, in the taking apart
process. In my historical reflections I
will not go beyond the period of forty
years which period I have covered by
my own engineering experiencs. As I
have stated, I was brought up as a
stress-analyst. I graduated from college
in 1911. At that time the pin-connected
railroad truss was still standard. This
was the time when reinforced concrete

inforced concrete calls for redundant,
continuous construction. Thus continu-
ous construction began to assert itself.
Appeals were heard to replace the eye
bars and pins in railroad bridges with
structural members and gusset plates.
The stress analysts proved by irref-
utable logic that rigid construction was
uneconomical, but rigid construction of
bridges nevertheless continued to gain
favor until at present the pin-connected,
statically determinate, truss is practical-
ly obsolete. The logic of the stress-
analyst, by which rigid construction is
condemned is extremely simple and is
irrefutable, if one believes in stress as
a criterion of strength. It goes as fol-
lows: The tensile stress in a diagonal,
for example, in an ideal pin-connected
truss, is easily computed with a very
high degree of accuracy. If now we re-
place the pin with a gusset plate, then
bending is introduced in the diagonal,
and this bending increases the stresses
in the diagonal. Hence gusset plates
are undesirable. Here is another simple
analysis of the same question. In Bel-
gium, Mr. Vierendeel evidently did not
like pins and had a special distaste for
cross-bracing. Why he had it in for our
well tried and highly efficient cross-
bracing is beside the point. The point
is that he did build numerous structures
without diagonals, called Vierendeel
trusses. A rigid conventional railroad
truss may be regarded as two trusses,
one Vierendeel Truss and one ideal pin-
connected truss made to function as a
unit. If built of glass or other brittle
material, the stress-analyst's conclusions
would undoubtedly come very close to
the truth. If built of structural steel,
the property of ductility irons out so-
called secondary stresses and the load
carrying capacity of the rigid truss sub-
stantially equals the sum of the carry-
ing capacities of the Vierendeel Truss
and the Pin-connected truss. Both
analyses are valid and logical. Yet they
lead to very different conclusions.
Which of these conclusions we choose
to accept as the more valid depends on
our sense of value.
It seems to me that in the last forty
years we have witnessed a revolution
in structural engineering practices with
which theory has failed to keep pace.
To use stress as a criterion of strength,
in the days of statically determinate
construction, was not too flagrantly un-
reasonable. It seems to me the reason-
ing was somewhat as follows: If a
member was stressed to the elastic limit,
it would elongate several percent of its
length under a substantially constant
stress. This would spell doom for any
structure that was statically determi-
nate. Therefore, we designed for a
working stress, say one-half the elastic
limit stress, and we would have a factor
of safety of two. It seems to me, we
might with equal logic have argued that
we multiply the working loads by two
and design for the elastic limit stress.
It seems a pity that this procedure was
not adopted as it would have forced
upon us the consideration of just what
happens when the elastic limit stress is
slightly exceeded. I have already pro-
vided a partial answer to this query. I
have spoken of an excessive deformation
under a substantially constant stress.
Remember, however, that this example
was qualified by the stipulation that it
applies to statically determinate struc-
tures.
I hold that the terms statically inde-
terminate and redundant are synony-
mous. Those mathematically inclined
may prefer the term statically indeter-
minate, and those who prefer to think
in terms of structures may prefer the
word redundant. By a redundant struc-
ture is meant a structure in which more
than one member, reaction, or restraint
function to the same end. Consider, as
an example, a continuous beam of two
equal spans over three supports and
loaded with a uniformly distributed
load. According to the texts the maxi-
mum bending moment occurs over the
wl2
middle support and equals
8
. This
value for the maximum moment is the
same as that for the maximum moment
in a simple beam subjected to a uni-
formly distributed load. Ask the elas-
tician. or even look in an engineer's
handbook, and one finds the strength
of the simple beam represented by unity,
and the strength of the continuous beam
on three supports also represented by
unity. Next, ask a construction fore-
man, who has handled steel construction
all his life, whether he would have as
rigid or strong a structure if he should
cut his continuous beam in two and
make two simple beams out of it. He
might mumble something of not being
a theorist, or of a conflict between
theory and practice, but he would be
pretty sure to know, by virtue of being
a better theorist than the elastician or
the engineer's handbook, that the an-
swer given in the handbook is absurd
and that the continuous beam supports
by far the greater load. If the behavior
of the beam were carefully checked by'
laboratory methods, the stress analyst
would find his claim substantiated, so
long as no part of the beam were
stressed beyond the elastic limit. He
would find that the stresses at the sup-
port are 77% greater than those at the
point of maximum moment between
supports. This would be true for a
considerable time as loads were pro-
gressively increased. The stress an-
alyst's error is an error in sense of value,
error in his basic assumption that he is
permitted to regard stress as a criterion
of strength.
It will be granted that, as the loads
on the continuous beam are gradually
increased, the stresses over the support
will reach the elastic limit when the
maximum stresses between supports are
but a fraction of the elastic limit. The
error in sense of value, thus the error
in theory, lies in the fact that this
reaching of the elastic limit stress over
the suport is regarded as equivalent to
failure. In a paper called Theory of
Limit Design (Trans. A.S.C.E., 1940) a
dictum 3 is formulated. This dictum
states: "When in a well designed and
especially a properly detailed, n-jold re-
dundant structure, n redundants art
stressed to their clastic limit, or up to
their critical buckling load, the de-
formations involved are oj the order oj
magnitude of elastic deformations until
an (n -\- l)'h member has reached its
elastic limit, or its critical buckling ca-
pacity." This dictum is crucial in the
theory of limit design. As parts of the
steel over the support passes into the
ductile state, the entire portion of the
beam between supports is still elastic.
Thus the deformations of the beam are
still of the order of magnitude of elastic
deformations, and are still far less than
they would be if the beams were simply
supported. We may continue to load
the beam with the resisting moment
over the support remaining substantially
constant, while the moment between
supports continues to build up. The im-
portant thing to recognize is that the
deformations remain less than the elas-
tic deformations of a simply supported
beam of the same length and section.
If these deformations of the beam thus
remain small enough, if the plaster does
not crack off the ceiling in the room be-
low, or if the water does not form into
puddles as the janitor cleans the floor
which rests on the beam, then who is
there to worry about the strength of
the beam? Possibly some of the clasti-

gas turbine locomotive
During the past few years the field
of railroad transportation has made gi-
gantic advancements. Complex systems
for safety have been designed and ad-
apted; luxurious cars have been made
to provide extreme comfort for the pas-
senger; and diesel, steam, and electric
locomotives have been perfected to give
great efficiency. Now another mode of
power is ready for the rails. Yes, the
gas turbine will soon find its place as
a locomotive power plant because of its
many natural advantages.
Let us first consider the working
parts of the gas turbine and how they
operate. First, the air used for combus-
tion purposes must be compressed. This
is accomplished by an axial compressor
which is usually driven by a small auxil-
iary power plant. This air, filtered from
the atmosphere, traverses the compress-
or and then enters the cross-flow heat
exchanger. It is at this point that the
filtered and compressed air is heated by
means of the turbine exhaust gases. The
heated air is then driven into a series of
parallel combustion chambers. Part of
the air is used for the combustion of the
fuel and the remainder is hurled through
a cooling jacket which surrounds the
entire turbine. The gases of combustion,
together with some uncombined air, ex-
pand through the turbine, induce rotary
action against the rotor blades, and
pass through the preheater to the outlet
vent.
The gas turbine is started by bringing
it up to an operating speed. Some mo-
torized unit effects this action. At this
speed the running temperature of 1200°
F. is attained and combustion com-
mences.
This turbine power plant is now
ready for adaptation to railroad locomo-
tives. A very efficient unit consisting
of a gas turbine, an electric generator,
and an electric drive has been designed.
The proposed road locomotive is
propelled by two 2,400 horsepower tur-
bines, giving a total rated power of
4.800 h.p. These units will drive,
through a reduction gear, the main
direct-current generator which in turn
will provide current for the traction mo-
tors. There is adequate power, also, to
run auxiliary electric generators for var-
ious purposes.
The locomotive itself will be 90 feet
in length and it will have two three-axle
trucks. Each of the six axles will be
powered by a direct-current traction mo-
tor. These trucks will support the total
weight of 450,000 pounds which, when
compared with other modern locomo-
tives, is extremely low. For even weight
distribution, one turbine will be in the
front end and the other in the back.
The locomotive will have a beauti-
fully streamlined outside surface. Un-
like many others which display ugly
stacks and tanks, this new type will
have just several inconspicuous vents.
The air intakes will be located on both
sides of the cab near the top. The height
of the intakes above the track makes it
possible to secure clean air almost per-
fectly free from foreign matter stirred
up from the roadbed. Furthermore,
they will be safely out of the way of
passengers when the locomotive is stand-
ing in the station. The exhaust gases,
after passing through the heat exchang-
ers, are discharged through the locomo-
tive roof.
Many other features of the proposed
locomotive have been carefully consid-
ered. For example, two large steam gen-
erators have been perfected for heating
the entire train. Perhaps future experi-
ence will prove the practical use of ex-
haust gases for this heating job.
Another factor of considerable im-
portance is the method of starting the
engines. Designers have perfected a
double-purpose auxiliary engine-genera-
tor set of 150 horsepower. This is not
only to bring the turbine up to operating
conditions, but it may be used for pro-
pelling the locomotive about the yards
when the main units are shut down.
Storage for fuels has been generously
supplied. The turbine fuel oil tank will
provide storage for 4,000 gallons of oil,
enough for ten hour's run. There are
also other tanks for lubricating oil, wa-
ter, etc.

type turbine locomotive? Will it actual-
ly be as efficient as many other types of
modern streamliners? From the results
of research carried out in this field it
can be seen that the new turbine road
locomotive will live up to its expected
efficiency.
One of the deciding advantages of the
new locomotive is its electric drive. De-
signers were met with two alternatives
at this point: they could use a mechan-
ical or electric type drive, or they could
employ an electric type one. This lat-
ter type was selected because of simplic-
ity of operation and relatively low main-
tenance costs. Furthermore, the facts
concerning the operation of the electric
drive as determined by long experience
could be used. Perhaps future turbine
locomotive design will include mechan-
ical transmission.
Another distinct advantage of the gas
turbine locomotive is its extremely light
weight. As previously stated, this is
about 450,000 pounds, which is less than
one-half the weight of the modern con-
ventional type of locomotive. A mini-
mum of weight will, of course, result
in lower fuel consumption and less wear
on the rails and roadbed.
One effect of many different locomo-
tives which, although usually over-
looked, is important, is the amount of
smoke and soot which is discharged
through the stacks. Because of the large
CO
MPH

percentage of excess air used in combus-
tion, the problem of smoke and other
products of incomplete combustion is
eliminated.
In respect to operation and mainte-
nance costs, this new locomotive should

and investigations into the cost of main-
tenance have been made. Gas Turbines

One of the University of Michigan's
most promising young graduates. Jack
Norton, at present enrolled in the grad-
uate school, has already packed years of
practical experience into his engineering
knowledge, and he is well on the way
toward earning for himself an outstand-
ing reputation in the field of electrical
engineering.

Jack Norton
Jack was born in Iowa and, since his
father's business required considerable
traveling, he received his elementary
and high school education in several
schools before coming to the University
of Michigan in 1938. Jack had been an
enthusiastic amateur radio operator, to
the extent of holding a class A radio op-
erator's license and operating the ama-
teur radio station W8TBM, for several
years before he came to college. How-
ever, he determined not to let his liking
and talent for that hobby dictate what
branch of engineering he should study.
He first enrolled in Chemical Engineer-
ing, and subsequently in Civil Engineer-
ing. He soon decided to follow his natu-
ral bent for electricity and radio, and so
he again transferred, this time to Elec-
trical Engineering. That this has been a
wise choice can be borne out bv review-
ing Jack's scholastic record and his ex-
periences after graduation.
Jack earned an admirable scholastic
average in his school work, and he was
elected to the Electrical Engineer's hon-
or society, Eta Kappa Nu, the equiva-
lent of the literary school's Phi Beta
Kappa. While maintaining the high
standards of school work, he was active
socially, and he was well-liked by pro-
fessors and fellow students alike. Jack
was and is an all-round good fellow, im-
pressing people with his jovial nature
and his sincerity of purpose. These two
qualities have contributed greatly to his
rising star in the field of engineering.
Immediately upon graduation he went
into naval service as an ensign, and
from February, 1943, to October, 1945,
he worked in Washington. D.C., at the
Naval Ordnance Laboratory. Working
specifically on the development of mines
and depth charges, Jack designed auto-
matic testing equipment for these mines
and depth charges. Already he holds
several patents, the first of his perse-
vering work and of his brilliant capabil-
ities as an engineer. One example of his
patents is one which is a design for a
test apparatus which automatically
checks a multiplicity of electrical cir-
cuits. Jack's inventions have been put
to good use in his naval research on
anti-submarine weapons. In recognition
of his very important services to the
Navy, Jack has been awarded a Meri-
torious Civilian Service Award.
On leave from the Naval Ordnance
Laboratory, Jack is at present studying
for his Master's degree in Electrical En-
gineering. He has a teaching fellowship
for which he teaches laboratory sections
in E. E.-3 (fundamental A. C. theory)
and E. E.-12 (elementary electronics).
Jack will receive his Master's degree
next June, and he says that his future
plans have not yet been completely de-
cided. If he went into industry, he would
specialize in Industrial Electronics—
electrical controls for machinery. His
school record and practical experience
have prepared him for this type of work,
and he will undoubtedly make impor-
tant contributions to the engineering
profession.

Don Snider is a lad who must cer-
tainly like Michigan, for after going to
school here in a service unit, he has
returned as a civilian to the Michigan
campus, to complete his technical educa-
tion. His home is not far from Ann
Arbor, at St. Clair Shores, and that may
partly account for his decision to go to
school here.
At any rate, after graduating from
Lake Shore High School, Don enlisted
in the Marines and was assigned to the
Marine unit at the University of Mich-
igan. He came here in 1943 and left
the service last March. He had been
accepted into Marine officer candidacy,
and consequently he had spent the last
eight months in service in officer candi-
date schools at the Parris Island and
Quantico, Virginia, Marine bases. As
soon as he was once again a civilian,
he considered the advisability of contin-
uing and completing his college work.
Don is a first-term senior in the Areo-
nautical Engineering department, major-
ing in aircraft structures. He reports

Donald Snider
that studying aircraft power plants, ma-
chine shop procedure, engine testing,
and experimental aerodynamics is quite
a strain at times, but if his scholastic
record is any indication, he will com-
plete all his courses in good order. His
immediate plans are. of course, to grad-
uate in June. After that, he intends to
return to Michigan for a year, to earn
his master's degree in aircraft struc-

our profession may worry and find the
ground sink from under them. But
why should that worry us? If they try
to pose as engineers while not realizing
that there is no a priori stigma attached
to any passing of the elastic limit, if
they don't realize that all the floor
beams in this building are purposely
manufactured short so that they may
be swung into place, and that at least
half of the connection angles which
fasten these floor beams to the columns
are strained beyond the elastic limit
when the rivet gun hits them and remain
so strained with impunity for the life of
the building, then I would say. let the
foundation sink from under them, and
good riddance. This deformation of the
order of magnitude of elastic deforma-
tion, formulated in the era of statically
determinate structures, has been our
real criterion of strength from time im-
memorial. We have gone off on a wrong
tangent when we substituted elastic
limit stress for deformation as our cri-
terion of strength. This substitution
was quite innocent in the day of static-
ally determinate construction. However,
the absurdities it leads to as applied to
redundant construction at the present
time are too numerous to mention.
Take, for example, the case of a sim-
ple rivet connection, say six rivets in a
row. The stress analyst for a very good
reason does not like to talk too much
about rivets. His conclusions would be,
and what is more, careful laboratory
tests would back him up, that the outer
rivets carry the major part of the load,
and that the inner ones are practically
duds. This then means that rivet con-
nections should be condemned. Many
may agree with this conclusion at the
present time when we have the alterna-
tive of welding at our disposal, but this
position certainly was not tenable a few
decades ago. The common, well proved,
and established practice in rivet design,
of assuming stresses to be equally dis-
tributed over all rivets, is violently in
conflict with the conclusions of the elas-
tician. The justification of the well es-
tablished and proved practice of assum-
ing the stresses to be equally distributed
over all rivets we find in the specifica-
tions, not in the currently dominant
theory of elasticity. The specification
calls for rivets of ductile material. This
LIMIT DESIGN
(Continued front page 14)
ductility of the rivets insures that the
assumed equal distribution of stress is
attained just when the limit load is
reached. Under normal loads the stress
distribution over the rivets is grossly at
variance with those assumed in design.
This substantiates my claim that the ac-
tual instantaneous stress distribution is
not important. The stress distribution
which governs strength is attained
under limit load, and this stress distri-
bution is governed by ductility and not
by elasticity. The conflict between the
elastician's stress analysis of rivets and
those assumed in current and. inciden-
tally, very good design practice, is an-
other example of the numerous so-called
conflicts between theory and practice.
I hold, as a primary philosophical prem-
ise, that conflict between engineering
theory and good practice is a priori an
absurdity. Either the theory is hay-
wire, or the practice is. We should
either change the one or the other. The
stress analysts appear to have concluded
that the less said about their conclusion
in regard to strength of rivet connec-
tions the better—the better for them, I
mean. If we would only face facts we
might realize not only how absurd their
conclusions are as applied to rivet de-
sign, but as applied to secondary stress
analysis as well. Then, if we were logi-
cal, we would quit talking about con-
flicts between theory and practice,
throw out the theory which leads to
obviously absurd conclusions, and start
looking for a theory in harmony with
facts and with good sound practice.
I hold that the theory of elasticity,
beautiful and valuable as it is, has for
decades had a stifling influence on
theory of strength. I further hold that
in any theory, assumptions, premises,
sense of value, and objective are pri-
mary, and mathematics is secondary. I
criticize the theory of elasticity, as ap-
plied to strength analysis, not for its
own sake, because I regard it both as
very beautiful and as very useful. If I
did not think so. I would not have writ-
ten a book on the subject, which I
champion as a very useful book. Note,
however, that this book contains a clos-
ing chapter entitled, limitations of the
elastic energy theory. This chapter is
the prelude to the theory of limit de-
sign. I criticize the theory of elasticity
because, in my judgment, it has culti-
vated and nursed for decades an absurd
sense of value, the sense of value which
regards elastic stress as an all sufficient
criterion of strength.
Some years ago, Mr. S. B. Lilly and
S. T. Carpenter (Trans. A.S.C.E., 1940)
published some carefully conducted
tests on plate girders. The paper
brought out considerable comment since
we are all greatly interested in plate
girders. In all the tests the girders
were carefully guarded against perma-
nent deformation. This saved a few
dollars, it must be acknowledged, but I
hardly believe this was the sole reason
for the conservatism. It seems to me
the authors reflected the current state of
engineering sense of value, when they
checked a few threadworn old formulae
within the elastic range of the function-
ing of girders. They don't even tell us
whether the girders were ever loaded
to failure before they were scrapped.
In our engineering colleges we proceed
in like manner. The students check
stresses in beams and shafts. These same
beams and shafts are used over and
over each semester and are carefully
watched so as never to be stressed be-
yond the elastic limit. This again re-
sults in the very commendable virtue
of saving a few pennies. I don't believe,
however, that this is the real reason for
this procedure. It seems to me that
we are lulled into the naive belief that
we can study strength merely by study-
ing elastic stresses, and that it is quite
unnecessary to study in detail the phe-
nomenon of failure. Some student*
graduate in the absurd belief that
failure and rupture are synonymous.
The subject of column strength anal-
ysis from its inception has been a matter
of limit design. The elastic stress ana-
lysts, however, have succeeded in
muddling it. To quote from a com-
munication issued by the organizing
committee of the Column Research
Council, "The field of designing and
detailing compression members in engi-
neering structures is a confused one and
is becoming more so as new materials
are produced." I, for one. shall be very
curious to see, whether by "ever more"
elastic stress analysis they will subtract
or add to the confusion, or whether they
will possibly try a less stereotyped ap-
proach.

We're fussy about
our Spaghetti!
In the language of vacuum tube
makers, Spaghetti" is a ceramic
sleeve for insulating conductors.
As the emphasis in electronics has
moved toward higher and higher
frequencies, tube elements have
grown smaller and smaller till some
spaghetti" insulators are the size
of a bristle in your tooth-brush!
The smallest ceramic sleeve now
made by Western Electric measures
under .030 of an inch outside diam-
eter, with a center hole of .020
inch. This means the walls of the
tube are only .005 inch thick — yet
each unit is rigid,strong and provides
good insulation.
In the production of hundreds
of varieties of such tiny elements,
Western Electric engineers have
achieved remarkable precision which
has had much to do with the rapid
progress of electronics.

Tiny Crystals

Delicate quartz crystals—some only
one-eighth inch square—withstood
a terrible beating in military radio
equipment One reason: engineers
at Bell Laboratories and Western
Electric devised a way to anchor
them gently, yet firmly, in place —
assuring stability and perfect contact
between terminal wires and crystal.
Here is how it is done: after
the crystal is ground nearly to pre-
scribed frequency, a spot of liquid
silver is applied at exact points for
terminal wires. Baking at 1000° F
fuses the silver to the crystal.Then
the entire surface receives a finish
of vaporized silver:
Finally—using a precision fixture
— the terminal wire, with a dot of
solder on its tip, is lined up with
the spot of silver and a jet of hot air
anchors it firmly in place. During the
war, millions of military' crystals
were assembled in this manner.
Manufacturing telephone and radio apparatus for the Bell System is Western Electric's primary jot It calls
for engineers of many kino's — radio, electrical, mechanical, chemical, metallurgical. Many of the things they do
—whether seemingly little or big — contribute greatly to the art of manufacture of communications equipment.

As Secretary-Treasurer of the En-

instructor
Many of our electrical engineering
students were pleasantly surprised re-
cently to see Henry J. Gomberg return
to the University of Michigan as an
instructor. Mr. Gomberg has been away
since April, 1944. and has only returned
this January to take over several classes
in electronics and electrical machinery.
Henry Comberg
For almost two years, Mr. Gomberg
worked at the Naval Ordnance Labora-
tory (known more simply as the
N.O.L.) at Washington, B.C. Here,
in the highly secret underwater warfare
ordnance, development work was done
in the field of torpedoes, mines, depth
charges, and the other weapons us?d in
the assault and protection of beach
heads.
In November, 1944, Mr. Gomberg
went into Navy uniform, and while still
under the jurisdiction of the N.O.L., he
visited many of the large laboratories
in the United States. In fact, for six
months, he had his own laboratory at
Iowa State College, Ames. Iowa, for the
study of special electrical problems.
Since his graduation from a New-
York high school in 1934. (which was
during the middle of the depression) in-
cidentally) Henry J. Gomberg worked
in almost every phase of electrical engi-
neering. He first worked himself
through City College of N.Y. by attend-
ing night classes, while working for a
scale manufacturer in the daytime. He
also did some designing of electrical con-
trols at this time, which were eventually
used in the Borinquen Airfield in Puerto
Rico.
In the summer of 1940. Mr. Gomberg
first came to Ann Arbor in order to fin-
ish his remaining years' work for a B.S.
degree. He received an appointment as
Research assistant to Dr. Bailey, and in
this capacity, he performed extensive
experiments on the sub-synchronous
motors. These motors are used on such
common commodities as electric clocks
and phonograph turntables.
After he received his B.S. degree, Mr.
Gomberg received a teaching fellowship
which enabled him to stay here and re-
ceive an M.S. degree in 1943. As usual.
he was not content with merely one
job, and so he began research work for
General Motors Corporation under Pro-
fessor Dow on the industrial applica-
tions of high frequency. Later, he di-
rected his own research project for the
Toledo Scale and Defiance Tool Com-
panies in the same field. \Vhen he re-
ceived his call to Washington in 1944.
he left this project under the capable
management of Professor Upthegrove.
Today, he has returned to Michigan
as an instructor as well as to work for
his Doctor's degree. His main interest
at present is electro-magnetic field
theory, although electronics does run
a close second.
In the personal vein—Mr. Gomberg
has a lovely wife, Edna. Their greatest
pride and joy is their little son Richard,
who was born just this last September
28th in Maryland, while Mr. Gomberg
was still in uniform.
Mr. Gomberg should certainly be an
inspiration to those who are working
their way through school. He has al-
ready distinguished himself in the field
of electrical engineering, and his career
is only at its very beginning.

priced fuel oil, and it has been deter-
mined that the fuel consumption will be
very low at the train speed of forty miles
per hour.
The design of the proposed locomo-
tive is nearly complete. Efficient gen-
erators will drive motorized units which
in turn will operate wheel revolution. A
light, large horsepower gas turbine will
supply the necessary power. All evid-
ence points to the fact that it will be a
huge success. Yes, the gas turbine loco-
motive is destined to be one of tomor-
row's finest streamliners.
shooting star
The Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star,
recently unveiled for public scrutiny,
is driven faster than any other plane
will fly, by a General Electric super-jet-
propulsion turbine, the most powerful
engine in the world. Additional details
about this supreme fighter of the war
also now can be told for the first time,
with permission of the War Department,
as another recognition of an anniversa-
ry of the Army Air Forces.
The first exhibition of the Shooting
Star was held at Washington, D.C., and
later ones were held at Wright Field,
Dayton, Ohio; and at Burbank, Califor-
nia. Air corps officers told dramatically
how the trim fighter knifes through the
air at high speeds with virtually no vi-
bration, being generated by the light
Jet engine;—how both the plane and
engine were developed under tremendous
wartime pressure at great speed by the
teamwork of the Air Technical Service
Command and civilian engineers.
Clarence Y. Johnson, chief reasearch
engineer for Lockheed, under whose
direction the first Shooting Star was de-
signed and built in the record time of
only 143 days, pointed out design
achievements and characteristics of the
propellorless plane, that are factors in
its going nearer the speed of sound than
any other man-made vehicle has ever
been able to achieve.
The outstanding quality of the super-
jet engine for the Shooting Star is that
it actually has but one moving part,
while in flight. Also, the jet engine can
be removed from a Shooting Star and
replaced with another engine in twenty
minutes.
The basic features of this plane and
the super jet engine are many and
varied. First, the Shooting Star is the
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued from page 16)
fastest plane in existence today. It is
highly manueverable and superlative in
rate and angle of climb at high speeds.
The new turbo-jet engine gives the
Shooting Star more power than any
other fighting airplane possesses. The
engine is far more powerful than any
exsisting reciprocating conventional gas-
oline engine.
N'o new flight problems are created
by the harnessing of the tremendous
power of the jet engine in the airplane.
Any competent pilot can fly a Jet-pro-
pelled plane, reducing training problems
to a minimum. Flyers enthusiastically
proclaim that it is easy to fly, and that
when the Jet engine is wide open, there
is absolutely no sensation of tension or
vibration.
The Shooting Star can function
Fuel sufficient for long range fighter
operations is carried in this fighter, due
to its advanced aerodynamic design, and
an ingenious arrangement of wing and
fuselage tanks, coupled with the fact
that the jet engine is both powerful and
light, make this large fuel load possible.
The Jet Engine has but one moving
part, which consists of an impeller and
turbine connected by shaft. The tur-
bine and impeller spin more than 10,00
times per minute. Frequently, the air
condensed by the impeller is minus 50
degrees Fahrenheit, while that pouring
from the combustion chambers through
the turbine buckets only a few inches
away, is 1500 degress Fahrenheit or
more.
Kerosene is now being burned in the
Jets to provide power for the airplane.

smoothly at greater altitudes than any
other airplane. Actually, its Jet engine
operates more economically at extreme
altitudes. This fighter plane achieves
its peak performance without a propel-
lor, radiator, and many other complex
controls and instruments. The Jet en-
gine has no carburetor, oil cooling sys-
tem, complex ignition system, gener-
ators, etc. Both the plane and engine
are simple to service and repair.
The super Jet Engine generates vir-
tually no vibration. This elminates a
factor which causes much pilot fatigue.
When jet engines and gas turbines are
harnessed to propel larger aircraft, com-
fort for passengers in transport planes
will be greatly increased.
High octane gasoline is not necessary to
produce maximum power in these en-
gines. Any fuel that will burn will pro-
duce power in the Jet engine, for the
more heat produced, the more power is
generated.

cabin, kept at virtually normal tempera-
ture and air density, regardless of alti-
tude. At an altitude of 40.000 feet.
going more than 550 m.p.h., the pilot
doesn't have to wear an oxygen mask
or heavy clothing.
The armament of Shooting Star is

concentration of fire power.

So claimed Charles Duryea for his horse-
less carriage. He had built it in a barn in
Springfield, Massachusetts, and it was the
first of its kind in the country.
It was the year 1892, when gasoline was
to be bought by day at the hardware store
and by night at the corner drug store. The
new contraption had "two speeds forward
and one reverse, and was operated by an
up and down movement of the steering
handle."
We have come a long distance since
Charles Duryea's day. One measure of
that distance is the universal use in motor

stantaneous generation of great power
by the Jet engine. The power plant is
in the fuselage, between the pilot and
the tail of the plane. Air ducts are
flush along the nose and lead to the im-
peller compressor of the engine. The
impeller whips air to the combustion
chambers, where the kerosene burns
fiercely in the compressed air. Velocity
of the air and gases is increased by the

surplus aircraft
Two important problems that face
the United States today are the disposal
of surplus aircraft and the maintenance
of American airpower. For the preserva-
tion of our air strength, there must be
research, constant improvement and an
up-to-date aircraft industry which is
capable of manufacturing the best
equipment. Therefore it is argued that
Courtesy General Electric
The Propjct, a combination to provide propeller drive and boost with jet propulsion.
surplus aircraft, if not dispos:d of and
distributed as much as possible for do-
mestic use, will stand in the way oi
progress. •
The huge quantities of military air-
planes and all the engines and spare
parts which were also required for sen--
icing purposes today constitute, in
terms of original cost, the largest share
of surplus war property which must be
distributed through the Surplus Prop-
erty Board. In disposing of surplus air-
craft, the board's objective is to sell
whatever material can be adapted to
commercial use, and then to convert the
remainder of surplus property into raw
materials. Fighting aircraft, of course,
have no commercial value and. except
for instruments, will be largely scrapped
and remelted into their component met-
als. On the other hand, transports,
training, and light "grasshopper" plane&lt;
are easily adapted for civilian use and
will satisfy much of the existing de-
mand for these planes in commercial
fields. However, the greatest danger in
the existence of surplus aircraft lies in
a possible throttling of aviation research

Many of the inherent qualities in Gas contribute to its unit
and overall economy in use. Further, the research achieve-
ments of the American Gas Association and Gas
equipment manufacturers in sponsoring ad-
vanced apparatus to utilize to the
utmost the advantages of this modern
fuel, add to its economy.
Among the contributions to economy
of Gas application in industrial plants
arc: speed—desired temperatures are at-
tained in shorter time in the Gas furnace;
controllability—which provides and main-
tains the precise temperature required; sim-
plicity—Gas equipment requires less space,
maintenance, attention; elimination of storage
—Gas requires no capital investment in stored fuels, again saves space; dependability
—Gas is there when you want it; uniformity of production and elimination of
rejects—Gas users report that production has been improved, products arc superior,
seconds or rejects cut to a minimum or eliminated, since switching to Gas.
The economical application of Gas to specific operations can readily be
demonstrated by an Industrial Engineer of the local Gas Company. His service
is complete, there is no obligation.

structural engineering science and prac-
tice represents a hodge podge, a crazy
quilt patch work, of conflicting theories,
rules, and practices. Take for example,
the design of a transmission tower, sub-
ject to transverse wind loading. The
diagonals will probably be of a length
such that their 1/i is equal to or greater
than 200. If we take the glorified
theory of elasticity as our guide, we will
have to increase the diagonals to undue
proportions, or else not build at all. The
engineering profession knows a way out
of the dilemma. It offers a dogma in
stating that the compression diagonal
may be, nay, should be, ignored. The
elastician acquiesces. He may be, and
often is, deficient in engineering sense
of value. But he is not deficient in a
sense of value relative to his own inter-
ests. He does not take on a fight which
he knows he will lose before he starts.
He withdraws in his shell only to assert
himself again to confuse us in the next,
more abstruse, problem. The dogmatic
rule to disregard the compression diag-
onal in the cross-bracing is well nigh
universal. It is a good rule as long as
we all follow it, and as long as we spend
the money of the client who knows no
better. Once, however, someone kicks
over the traces by approaching the de-
sign of transmission towers from a dif-
ferent point of view, conditions are not
so serene. As a third method of anal-
ysis we may argue that compression
diagonals cost money, and that they
form an integral part of the structure.
They contribute to the strength of the
structure, any dogmatic rules notwith-
standing. Furthermore, if we consider
the compression diagonal as the redun-
dant, then there remains an elastic
frame after the limit buckling strength
of the compression diagonal has been
reached, which elastic frame continues
to function, and to restrict the deforma-
tion to elastic deformation, until its ca-
pacity or limit strength is reached.
Compute the limit strength of the elas-
tic frame, add to it the strength incre-
ment contributed by the redundant,
compression diagonal, arrive at the
limit strength of the entire frame, then
apply a factor of safety and arrive at a
safe working load. This third alterna-
tive is limit design. I might add here
that one firm has kicked over the traces
and has skimmed the cream of the world
transmission tower business for decades.
LIMIT DESIGN
(Continued from page 20)
Don't let any elastician fool you by
saying that a column's strength drops to
zero the minute the Euler load is ex-
ceeded. If you make a search in the
library, you may become discouraged by
the voluminous column test data, re-
corded by elasticians, which appear to
tell you everything about columns ex-
cept this one important item. However,
if you will search long enough, you may
find something which will put your fears
at rest.
The primary consideration, in the
theory of strength, is equilibrium. If
the equations of static equilibrium are
not satisfied, say by but a fraction of
an ounce, we are face to face with col-
lapse. Both the theory of elasticity and
the theory of limit design are secondary,
they are supplementary to the equations
of equilibrium. Both of these theories
formulate conditions of continuity. If
we want to stipulate complete absence
of permanent set, we are restricted to
the theory of elasticity. This require-
ment, however, is so rare, in structural
engineering, as to be practically non-
existent. If we want to get the most
for our time spent on design as well as
for the money spent on material, we se-
lect points of contraflexure or assign
maximum values to redundants at will,
the latter not to exceed the ductile load-
carrying capacity of the redundant.
Once we have assumed the element of
strength contributed by the redundants,
the question of finding the strength of
the entire structure becomes a mere
matter of satisfying equations of static
equilibrium. This powerful rule of se-
lecting points of contraflexure and of
assigning arbitrary values to the re-
dundants at will, generally is handed us
as another one of our many dogmas. It
is a very good dogma, one to be cher-
ished, but it need not be a dogma at all.
It may, nay, in my opinion it should be
justified by rational philosophy. The
theory of limit design is the thoroughly
rational philosophy which justifies this
rule. In 1917, Prof. Kist of the Uni-
versity of Delft, gave an inaugural ad-
dress entitled "Does a strength analysis,
based on the proportionality of stress
and strain, lead to good construction of
iron bridges and buildings?" The an-
swer to this question he summarized in
the closing sentence of his address as
follows, "It seems to me that the answer
to my question must be 'No'. The anal-
ysis based on proportionality can gen-
erally be dispensed with, and can, if not
dispensed with, be regarded as second-
ary. The principal procedure is to use
a much easier analysis by means of
which we assume values for the re-
dundants as favorable as possible con-
sistent with equilibrium,—by favorable
is meant that the loads transmitted by
the redundants is assumed as large as
possible."
The title of Professor Kist's address
was in the form of a question. He did
not offer a name for a theory. His com-
ment on my paper on limit design was.
'The strength analysis based on the
ductility of steel, you have treated very
differently from the way I have done
it." Yet, Kist's address was clearly the
inspiration for all my efforts. Since
1920 I have offered a course at Michi-
gan in theory of ductility. This term
of theory of ductility was changed to
theory of limit design when I discov-
ered that the late C. M. Goodrich, chief
engineer of the Canadian Bridge Co..
was very successfully applying the basic
principles of the philosophy which 1
championed, not only to rivets and
beams, but to the design of transmis-
sion towers.
The numerous dogmas which I have
cited, I claim as evidence of support of
the theory of limit design. I do not
claim that they are the equivalent of
limit design.
If we accept the theory of limit de-
sign as the most rational philosophy to
govern the design and construction of
structures made of structural steel (a
recent investigation has satisfied me
that we need not fear any competition
from aluminum or magnesium probably
for a long time to come), then the dog-
mas mentioned before assume the status
of laws. Fallacies, such as the engineers'
handbooks' statement that a continu-
ous beam is no better than a simple
beam, then appear as absurdities. Not
only can the dogmas be replaced by-
laws but a lot of deadwood theory can
be completely eliminated and other
sounder laws formulated to replace it.
Attention would be directed to design
connections not only so as to develop
as nearly as possible the full strength
of the members, but so as to develop
the full ductility of the members as
well. (See "Effect of Connections on
Ductility of Steel Angles"—Civil Engi-
neering, February, 1946).

Good News for Unsuspecting T. B. Victims

HERE is news that marks another step
ahead in the fight against t. b.—
news about free tests and new x-ray
equipment.
As a means of locating possibly one
and a half million undetected cases of
tuberculosis, the U. S. Public Health
Service plans to offer chest x-ray tests
to nearly every American during the
next five years. This survey is made
possible through the use of new equip-
ment which produces chest x-rays on
small film, thus permitting mass exami-
nations at reduced cost.
The development of the new film and
the special fluoroscopic screen was not
accomplished overnight. Organic chem-
ists, physical chemists, physicists, and
other technically trained men were re-
quired to make exhaustive studies be-
fore the problem was solved. Special
sensitizers had to be found. Phosphors
and activators had to be formulated for
the screen. Both screen and film had to
be of ultra-fine grain, and the spectral
emission of the screen had to be adjusted
to the spectral sensitivity of the film.
Men of Du Pont are proud of their
part in the development of this new aid
to medical science. The fact that their
efforts helped to contribute a new bene-
fit to society is a heart-warming in-
spiration.

Du Pont chemists, plant pathologists,
entomologists and engineers have helped
the farmer to increase the nation's
food supply through their never-ending
search for better ways of protecting
crops. The development of new fungi-
cides is a typical example.
Du Pont men were faced with the
problem of finding chemicals to be used
in treating fungus diseases of plants,

under conditions in which the use of
copper and sulfur proved harmful. After
long and intensive research they found
the answer in the salts and organic de-
rivatives of dithiocarbamic acid—such
as the iron and zinc salts of dimethyldi-
thiocarbamic acid, and tetramethyl-
thiuramdisulfide.
Agriculturists now know Du Font's
iron salt of dimethyldithiocarbamic
acid as "Fermate," and the zinc salt of
the same acid as "Zerlate." These fungi-
cides are products of Du Pont research
—research that is helping the farmer to
bigger crops of better quality.

and development due to the elmination
of immediate demand for new planes.
As an example of the immensity of
the surplus aircraft problem, consider
the history of a typical B-24 Liberator
bomber. Built in 1942, it was one of
the best bombers in the air when it was
first pressed into service. This partic-
ular plane's first tour of duty was with
the 18th Anti-Submarine Squadron,
hunting Nazi U-boats off the Atlantic
Coast. In 1943 this craft was sent over-
seas to the 12th Air Force in North
Africa. It was used for six months in
missions for softening the under-belly
Fortress Europe. These raids which
wrecked Nazi oil resources at Ploesti,
Rumania, and missions all over the
globe, wherever Allied planes fought,

Surplus aircraft
were carried on while newer planes,
Allied and Axis, were being developed
and manufactured to overcome the dis-
advantages of existing models. Conse-
quently, after six months of duty in
North Africa, our plane, which we can
now call the "White Elephant," was
sent home to rejoin the submarine pa-
trol. In 1944 the White Elephant was
classified as a "war-weary" airplane,
and was assigned to Patterson Field,
for salvage disposition.
When the White Elephant was dis-
assembled, at an expenditure of 783
man-hours, the big warplane had been
reduced to 32,759 pounds of frame,
armament, hydraulic mechanism, en-
gines, rubber, propellers, landing gear,
and electrical equipment. This plane,
first produced at a cost of $236,000 to
the taxpayer, was almost completely a
pile of junk. Expert appraisal estab-
lished the fact that some instruments
and electrical controls had salvage value,
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(Continued from page 26)
but that the excessive cost of collecting
and sorting out the vast majority of air-
craft parts necessitated converting old
bombers and fighting planes into scrap.
In short, our present fighting ma-
chines are a complete economic liabil-
ity. Produced in huge numbers because
of the urgent needs of the war, these
planes were obsolete before they had
seen a year's active service. Radically
new designs had been made, and new
fighting aircraft had been produced
which greatly outclassed the older
models in speed, maneuverability, and
firepower. It is a vicious circle; planes
are sent into service and are soon
rendered useless by research and devel-
opment in the aircraft industry. This
development is vitally necessary to keep
the United States in aviation leadership,
but this great turnover of aircraft must
inevitably result in a large supply of
surplus airplanes.
Since June, 1940, the United States
has produced more than 285,000 milita-
ry aircraft. This is ten times the num-
ber of civilian and military planes in
operation in the U.S. before the war.
Since the most modern planes are get-
ing larger and heavier, we produced 100
times the amount of aircraft that we
had when France fell in 1940. Many of
these planes are cargo planes and train-
ers. Others have been sent by lease-
lend to our Allies. Even so, of all the
fighting aircraft which are in service to-
day, many are already obsolete and in
a year all the others will have become
obsolete due to super-bomber develop-
ments and jet propulsion improvements.
As of July, 1945, there were already
more than 40,000 surplus "White Ele-
phants" and since the end of the war
this number has more than doubled.
These planes are cluttering up Army
and Navy airfields and reducing the
fields' capacity to handle air traffic.
World War I has shown the futility of
keeping these airplanes and using them
in peace-time service, because it can
easily be seen how these obsolete craft
will endanger the peace. The Army, in
1919, kept half of about 12,500 planes
and most of the 20,000 brand new Lib-
erty engines left over from the war. Due
to frugal peacetime budgets, the Army
was forced to design new planes which
could use the old Liberty engines. Con-
sequently, world-war-vintage airplanes
were being used by the Air Corps as
late as 1932.
France is another glaring example of
a nation utilizing castoff, outmoded air-
craft. The French systematically de-
stroyed all existing German airplanes
but kept their own, believing that they
could maintain continental air suprem-
acy. Lulled into security by the great
size of their air force, the French were
demoralized and defeated by the blitz-
krieging Luftwaffe which had been de-
veloped with the most modern planes
and radically new air tactics.
The British, however, had conscien-
tiously discarded obsolete aircraft and
had maintained a nucleus of modern
fighters and bombers. Soon the Luft-
waffe began to feel the decay of stand-
ardized models, and in the Battle of
Britain, the quality of British aircraft
decisively defeated the quantity of the
Luftwaffe.
Early in 1944, in the United States
a plan had been developed which estab-
lished policy in disposing of surplus air-
craft. Based on a committee report
headed by L. Welch Pogue. Chairman
of the Civil Aeronautics Board, the
policy of the Surplus Property Board is:
1. Civilian and commercial uses must
be found for as many of the planes
as possible.
2. An orderly method of supplying
this civilian market must be de-
veloped which will use normal in-
dustrial channels and benefit the
public interest.
3. Not only domestic demands but
also foreign demands for commer-
cial planes should be satisfied in a
way that will serve the public in-
terest. Tactical aircraft have little
or no commercial value, and they
must necessarily be scrapped.
4. After all aviation needs have been
supplied, the remaining surpluses
can be used partly to satisfy the
market existing in educational, ex-
perimental, memorial, and miscel-
laneous non-aviation uses.
5. After all worthwhile components
of all the remaining aircraft are
salvaged, the remaining material
should be scrapped.
6. Our capacity for research, devel-
opment, and production of the
very latest aircraft and aeronau-
tical devices must be maintained
in the interests of national secur-
ity.
This policy is being carried out to
a large degree. The existing surplus has
been separated into five categories—

themselves poorly to development in an
address. Whether you agree or not, I
maintain that I have talked theory, and
nothing but theory. I have presented
what I regard as the most essential
part of any theory, namely, sense of
value. If you agree with me, (1) that
we may have rupture on a plane of
zero stress, (2) that deformations are
of an order of magnitude of elastic de-
formations, long after redundants are
stressed beyond the elastic limit, (3)
that stress in structural engineering is
not now and never was a safe and
sound criterion of strength, (4) that we
simply cannot break a steel beam by
bending and can only deform it beyond
its range of usefulness, (5) that the
LIMIT DESIGN

theory of elasticity, glorified as it is,
has turned out to be as much of a liabil-
ity as an asset, and (6) that what we
really are concerned about, in structural
engineering, are deformations and not
stresses, then you can easily, with a
little reading, work out your own theory
of limit design. If you don't accept this
sense of value formulated by me, then
no amount of examples would convince
you.

spending to the loads P. Figure 1 (d)
represents successive stress distributions
over the cross-section of the beam at B,
Figure 1 (e) represents successive stress
distributions over the cross-section at
point C. Figure 2 shows the load deflec-
tion curves for both the simple and the
continuous beam. The theory of elas-
ticity tells us that, so long as the beam
functions elastically, the ratio of the
bending moments at points C and B
in fig. 1 (b), is M../M,, = 1.875. The
ordinates to the bending moments at
points C and B. for bending moments
1, 2 and 3, are thus in this same ratio.
The ratio of the maximum stresses, indi-
cated by 1, 2 and 3 on figures 1 (e) and
1 (d), are in the same ratio. As load P,
is increased until it reaches the value of
P4 the resisting moment at point C is
increased 12% while the stress distri-
bution at section B is represented by
number 4 on figure 1 (d). If load P,
is still further increased to P. the maxi-
mum resisting moment at point C re-
mains constant, the stress distribution
over the cross-section at B changes from
that represented by No. 4. to that
represented by No. 5 fig. 1 (d). The
moment at B increases simultaneously
some 12%.
For the loads P,. P.., and P;!. within
the elastic range, the bending moments
1, 2 and 3. fig. 1 (c) all manifest the
same point of inflection. As P., is in-
creased to P4 the bending moment at C
increases but slightly while the bending
moment at B increases materially. The
point of inflection thus moves nearer
the central support. As P4 increased
to P- the bending moment at the sup-
port remains constant while that at
point B increases some 12%. Therefore,
the point of inflection moves still fur-
ther towards the central support, in fact,
moves to the midpoint between points
B and C.
The beams' behavior, outlined above,
may be traced on the load deflection
curves shown in figure 2. The elastic

psi. The limit load on the simple beam,
taken from figure 2, is 8600 Ibs. or some
12C/C greater than the elastic limit load
of 7700 Ibs.
In the analysis of the redundant
beam the theory of elasticity gives Me
as a function of P, (fig. 16). Me =
80
—P inch Ibs. Taking the elastic limit
bending movement of 61700 from the
test record for figure l(a) and solving
for P we obtain:

— P = 61700, or P= 6900 Ibs. On fig.
2 the total maximum load within the
elastic limit stress, or 2P = 13800 Ibs.,
is shown as ordinate and is marked C.
Under a limit loading of the continuous
SI
beam Mh =—= 61700 inch Ibs. and

Me is 12% in excess of Mb. Thus
Me = 69000.
Figures 1 (f) and 1 (g) represent
free body sketches of portions A B and
B C of the continuous beam fig. 1 (b).
Writing eqilibrium equations for figures
1 (f) and 1 (g) we obtain:

(P-RJ X 16 = Mb + Mc.
16 P - - 16 X 1930 = 61700 +
69000 = 130700. Therefore, P =
10100 Ibs., and 2P, the limit load for the
entire beam as recorded by the testing
machine, and as shown in figure 2, equals
20200 pounds. This limit load of 20200
Ibs. is 46 r'r in excess of the load of
13800 Ibs. which caused the elastic limit
stress at point C to be reached. The
deflection of the redundant beam under
this limit load of 20200 Ibs. is sub-
stantially the same as the elastic de-
flection of the simple beam.

THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


Start of a big whittling job
LOOK at this great, great grandpappy
i of the modern transport plane.
Most of it was virtually whittled out
of wood.
Now, picture in its place a giant
airliner of today with its huge
wings, its growling engines, and its
magnificent equipment. It, too, is a
"whittling" job ... by fabulous men.
Men who have no limits to their
dreams. Men who have Tncredible skill
with tools. Men who perform miracles
with metals.
And it is a "whittling" job by the
hardest metal made by man — an
amazing new metal for cutting and
forming other metals. Its name is
Carboloy Cemented Carbide.
What gives our planes the endurance
to fly thousands of safe miles in all
weather in all climates? What helped
to bring back warplanes with tail sur-
faces half shot away . . . with wings
and engines mutilated by steel slugs?
The answer is super-tough metal
jlloys.
CARBOLOY
CEMENTED CARBIDE
Engine parts, wing spars, armor plate
and hundreds of other vital air-
plane parts literally have to be whittled
out of these tough, hard alloys. This
could never be done quickly and eco-
nomically unless a harder metal like
Carboloy were used for the cutting
tools and forming dies.
In fact, high American Air Forces
officers have said,
"We couldn't have produced our
present aircraft engines on a pro-
duction basis without carbide tools."
The reasons why Carboloy Cemented
Carbide is used throughout the avia-
tion industry and in hundreds of others
are simply these:
1. Its amazing ability to cut and form
the toughest alloys at speeds that
commonly triple the output of both
men and machines.
2. Its unbelievable resistance to wear.
In the air age to come, Carboloy will
help bring many new benefits to every-
one . . . consumers and manufacturers
alike.
Its usefulness will multiply over and
over again, not only in tools and dies
in every phase of metal working, but
also in wear-resistant parts in hundreds
of products from automobiles to knife-
sharpeners.
A challenge to industry!
It's 10 to 1 that our research men
and field engineers can find applica-
tions for Carboloy in your plant that
will help you improve quality and cut
production costs. Why not accept this
challenge?

Yes, S.S.White flexible shafts are among the
most useful of basic mechanical elements. The
partial list at the left will give you a good
idea of the many different products in which
they play a part.
And here is the reason for this extensive use
—S.S.White flexible shafts provide engineers
with a simple, practical answer to two prob-
lems which come up again and again In the
design of mechanical products-
ID The problem of transmitting rotational
power around turns and in paths other
than straight lines.
(2) The problem of mechanical remote control.
S.S.White flexible shafts, in both the power
drive and remote control types, come in a
large selection of diameters and characteris-
tics to meet a wide range of requirements. En-
gineers will find it helpful to be familiar with
the range and scope of these "Metal Muscles"
for mechanical bodies.
WRITE FOR BULLETIN 4501
It gives basic facts and technical
data about flexible shafts and their
application. A free copy will be
mailed to you for the asking.
Please mention your college and
course when you write.

tactical aircraft, transports, personal
aircraft, components and parts, and un-
absorbed surplus. The tactical airplanes,
or combat ships, have absolutely no eco-
nomical commercial value and must be
scrapped as they become obsolete.
Transports are being sold to commercial
lines in the U.S. and, in limited quanti-
ties, to foreign lines. A purchaser must
pay a fixed price for a transport—$100-
000 for a DC-3 airliner—but is allowed
the cost of conversion and overhauling,
in preparation for civilian service. Many
training planes are being sold to tech-
nical schools and private individuals,
but they are sold at a fixed price with
no allowance for reservicing the planes
Many of the "grasshopper1' planes used
for artillery observation and liaison work
are being sold to individuals for per-
sonal use or for private instruction pur-
poses. These light liaison planes, how-
ever, are sold at auction to the highest
bidders, and competition for these
planes has been high. By last Novem
ber 15,000 surplus planes had been sold
to the general public.
Components and parts of airplanes
will become useful as replacements art-
needed for these planes which are now
in civilian service. Useful parts will be
sold, usually through the original manu-
facturers, and the rest are classified as
salvage.
The unabsorbed surplus will have
great value for educational and memo
rial purposes, but their cash value is
low. These airplanes have great poten-
tial value to the country as a means of
educating the new generation in an air-
minded world. Also, these aircraft,
though obsolete for fighting purposes,
provide useful material for continuing
aircraft research, especially in educa-
tional institutions.
The remaining quantities of aircraft
and parts have to be scrapped. When
melted down in the "sweating" process,
whereby the aluminum is melted off at
its fusion temperature, leaving a fer-
rous alloy composed of steel, lead, and
magnesium, the scrapped parts can be
converted into usable raw materi-1--
In review, it can be said th the
Surplus Property Board is pursu an
intelligent and efficient program dis-
posing of our country's surplus aj aft.
At the same time, our national ecc mic
interests are being safeguarded, e our
research and productive genius not
being wasted because of disco uerl
aircraft manufacture.

attached, the boss of one blade lies next
to the boss of its neighbor. These ends
are then welded quickly without trans-
mitting heat to the blade section.

a new anneal anlysis
A new x-ray method of studying
metal crystals which will help explain
just what happens when a metal is
strained, and also how annealing re-
moves strains, has recently been de-
veloped.
A small piece of the metal to be
examined, about one five hundredth of
an inch thick and polished on both sides,
is placed in the x-ray beam and an ex-
posure made on a photographic plate
behind the specimen. The planes of
atoms within the crystals diffract the
rays from their course thus preventing
them from reaching the plate on the
back. This leaves an unexposed area
which shows up light when the plate is
developed.
In parts of the crystal where a strain
is present, the atomic planes are dis-
torted and the rays previously stopped
at that point, may reach the plate.
However, if the metal sample is tilted
a few degrees, the spot gradually dis-
appears.
In examination the angle of most
spots is first located. The metal is then
tilted slowly. The ratio of spots (which
may even reach 80 per cent of the total
area) with the change of angle is meas-
ured, and a corresponding curve is
drawn. These data show the distortion
that occurs in metals and permits the
scientist to map the strain, thus open-
ing new roads in metallurgical research.
forged blade lashings
The blades in the last rows of a large
steam turbine are long structures with
low natural frequencies. They require
bracing near the middle for tuning pur-
poses. Welds of stainless-steel wires be-
tween them is one common way of
lashing them together. However, there
is a possibility that the heat of welding
may disturb the metallurgical structure
of the blade.
A new type of blade has eliminated
direct welding to the blade surface.
Stubes or basses are forged at the point
of lashing, and when the blades are

Courtesy Westintkcust
When turbine blades are assembled on
rotor the forged lashings are readily
welded together without heating the
blades.

There's plenty here you can't see
Your train ride of the future may be a more de-
lightful experience because of something you can't
see in this picture.
The thing you can't see is the customary gap
between the ends of the rails. You can't see it because
it isn't there. For the rails, instead of being bolted
together, are welded together into lengths of solid
metal sometimes a mile long.
This is done by pressure-welding ... by forcing
the rails together at their ends in the beat of oxy-
acetylene flames until they become a single, con-
tinuous piece, uniform in appearance, structure,
and strength.
Pressure-welded track is being used increasingly
by railroads because it cuts maintenance costs and
provides a smoother, quieter ride for passengers.
Pressure-welding also is used by many other indus-
tries. Some use pressure-welding for the construction
of overland pipe lines . . . some for the fabrication of
machinery parts . . . some for making oil-well tools
. . . and some are using pressure-welding to make
airplane and automobile parts.
Pressure-welding is a research development of
The Linde Air Products Company and The Oxweld
Railroad Service Company, Units of UCC.
If you are a bit technically minded or just want to
knoic more about this subject, write for booklet P-4

flexible motor
Sometimes engineering requirements
call for a variable speed from a constant
speed machine. At other times constant
speeds are needed of variable speed
machine. One such machine has been
recently developed and put into oper-
ation.
One the motor-shaft extension is a
smooth drum. Surrounding this drum
is a cage with lengthwise slats. Resting
in these slats and riding on the motor
drum are carbon blocks held in posi-
tion by garter springs. The cage is con-
nected to the driven load. The motor is
arranged so that at all times its speed
is above that desired, but the blocks
and springs are so adjusted that at the
correct rotation, the centrifugal forces
lighten the pressure of the springs and
the carbon slips just the right amount
on the motor cylinder.
The resulting speed regulation is re-
markably constant. During tests on a
M-G set servicing a torque meter, the
400 cycle output is held within one cycle
for motor speed changes from 8400 to
11,000 revolutions per minute.
mighty mite
A 5000 K\V power generation unit,
including steam turbine, condenser,
generator and auxiliaries, complete as
one unit has been developed recently.
The unit, compact and ready to be put
together is intended for installation
abroad where small, ready-designed
power plants requiring the minimum of
erection time, skill, and preparation are
needed.
The unit contains the standard,
thoroughly tried power units—but in-
tegrated as to design for maximum
compactness and simplicity. The con-
denser doubles as the foundation super-
structure. The unit occupies a floor
area of 31 feet by 13 feet and stands
17Vo feet high.
small airport lighting
The hundreds of small airports, which
have no regularly scheduled operations,
are a vital part of the national aviation
program. Their requirements for light-
ing, although less rigid than for the large
all-year airports, are important. These
are: no sacrifice in safety under the
conditions of flying done at these ports,
unqualified reliability, and low initial
cost.
The requirements for these ports must
not be simply cut-down versions of
apparatus for the commercial-line air-
ports. An example of the engineering
for these fields is the new wind cone.
The new cone employs four SO watt
lamps instead of four 200 watt lamps
This cone is thus simpler, and cheaper,
yet it can be seen as far as necessary
in the type of weather for which these
small airports are used.
portable brazer
Brazing is an old but not too gen-
erally used method of joining such
metals as copper, brass, and bronze.
For the production line of factories, the
well-developed brazing are in much de-
mand. One handicap, however, has been
the lack of brazing apparatus that can
be taken to the job. as in shipyards,
railroads shapes, etc. Portable units
which have a self-contained family of
brazing sets that require only a con-
nection to a 220-volt power source have
been developed recently. These sets
contain a transformer for providing high
currents at low voltage, suitable voltage
selectors, controls, and carbon tipped
tongs that can be clapped over the pieces
to be joined. Currents flowing through
the carbons raises the metal to the braz-
ing temperature, 1200 to 1500 degrees
F., in a very short time.

Great new research laboratories
being built by Standard Oil
(INDIANA)
will provide every modern facility
for about 1200 research workers
War activities revealed hitherto undreamed-of possi-
bilities that lie in petroleum ... found many new
products that can be made from it... widened the
entire horizon of organic chemistry.
So, the Standard Oil Company (Indiana) started
building these new research laboratories at Ham-
mond, Indiana, near- the famous Whiting refinery.
Here the Company's able scientists will work their
magic... taking hydrocarbons apart and putting them
together . . . turning aliphatics into aromatics . . .
developing amazing new methods for carrying out
chemical reactions.
From these laboratories will come fuels for new
cars and new diesels, for gas turbines, for jet-propelled
planes. There will appear new lubricants, insecticides,
cutting oils—and an increasing number of new chem-
icals and plastics.
Some of the scientists will work with flasks and
beakers, some will operate pilot plants. Others will
carry out complicated chemical analyses electroni-
cally by the flick of a switch. Still others will design
huge new refinery units, or help run these towering
steel giants. Chemical engineers with a flair for eco-
nomics will watch crude supplies, costs, markets.
They will decide when, if ever, the Company ought
to start making gasoline from natural gas or from coal.
All this and more will go on in these new research
laboratories.

electronic finger
An "electronic finger," which auto-
matically controls the operation of ma-
chine tools, has been developed and put
into use. This automatic contouring
control system, of which this "finger"
is a part, shapes anything from graceful
candlesticks to superchargers for air-
craft engineers. In fact, almost any-
thing that can be cut from a pattern
and template by a motor tool can be
produced accurately and automatically
by the machine.
The vital part of the machine is the
"electronic finger" which feels its way
around the curves and angles of the pat-
tern and controls the cutting tool in
such a way as to reproduce the object
from the pattern.
The tracing stylus comprises two
magnetic bridges, which in turn consists
of two identical magnetic circuits, one
pair mounted on the axis at right angles
to the other. These are assembled on a
diaphragm which is attached to the
stylus, which slouches the pattern or
templet.
The stylus of the tracing-head moves
along the side of the contour on the
pattern which is to be reproduced.
Pressure of the feeler, caused by a
change in the pattern, on the template
causes deflection of the diaphragm
which in turn causes a change in voltage
in the coils of the tracing head. This
voltage is then carried to the center of
the device, where the signals from
the bridge circuits are amplified and
"mixed" into what is called a vector
signal. This signal is related to the di-
rection of the pressure on the stylus
thus, by means of a "bender" circuit,
the stylus changes direction uniformal
and stays on the pattern.
The signal from the bender circuit
produces two separated C voltages.
Each voltage determines the speed of
one of the two feed motors. When a
change in contour is encountered, one
motor will automatically slow down or
speed up just the proper amount to
reproduce on the piece of work in the
machine the same contour encountered
by the stylus on the pattern. Inside,
outside, or right angles can be cut.
The rapid changes in direction are
dependent on fast motor control. The
thyration tube controls motor speed and
direction almost instantly.
In tests made during the controls de-
velopment, fine chess pawns, complete
with ball on top, were completed from
the same templet. During the war, ma-
chines equipped with this instrument
produced parts for jet engineer and
turbo-superchargers.

rothing is guessed at, nothing is taken for granted
by the engineers in charge of Okonite's cable proving
ground. Buried in various types of chemically different
and highly corrosive earth, pulled into conduit or in-
stalled overhead, electrical cables are tested under con-
trolled conditions of temperature, voltage and loading
conditions duplicating those of actual operation.
In use since 1936, carefully-recorded tests made in this
"outdoor laboratory" have disclosed valuable trends. As
facts accumulate, Okonite engineers apply their findings
to the improvement of their electrical wires and cables.

Exciting To Him
h
II
WHEN A MAN finds his work exciting
be stimulated to do his best work.
That is a point we think every young engineer would
do well lo consider before he applies for a job anywhere.
If you like variety and enjoy meeting a perpetual
challenge of doing the job better, you will find much
to attract you to the Timken Roller Bearing Company.
For no other product is involved in the basic design
of so many other products in so many industries as
Timken Roller Bearings.
■ As an engineer for the
bearing division of this company, you might one day
be working on problems which would take you 25,000
feet in the air. And the next week, you might work
5,000 feet underground. In rapid succession, your job
might shift from bearings for a ma-
chine tool, to bearings for an auto-
mobile, a farm tractor, a drilling
rig, a locomotive or any product
which has revolving wheels, or shafts.
You would have to know basic
working conditions for many prod-
ucts. You would have to keep pace
with technological advances. And
because bearings arc an important
part of design, you would in many
cases, be asked to help work out the
design of a wide variety of new
products. With this company, your
work will be as varied and absorbing
as the whole of America's dynamic
industry.
As training for this work, we operate a practical
"Work-as-You-Learn" Plan for young graduate en-
gineers who measure up to our standards. There are
no classes. While doing productive work in the various
departments of our factory, each man is careftillv
watched and supervised by experienced and highlv
skilled engineers with a view to developing special
aptitudes.
■ When a man, in our
opinion, becomes sufficiently grounded in the basic
principles of our business, he is assigned to the line of
work for which he is best fitted.
Many executives now in responsible positions with
our company, started in this way.
Again, this year we want to hire a limited number
of men from leading engineering schools; men who
we hope will make a successful career for themselves
with us. If you will soon have a Bachelor of Science
Degree in Engineering, we would like to talk with you
now. Write The Timken Roller Bearing Company,

Peacetime Lessons
in a Wartime
Engineering Record
The Hoover Company manufactured
a lot of important wartime products.
A few of them are pictured here.
Some of them came to Hoover well-
engineered, and were production jobs
only. But on others, Hoover engi-
neers had the experience and the
know-how in a wide variety of fields
that equipped them to lick tough
design and construction problems.
Hoover men were one of the se-
lected few engineering groups as-
signed to development work on the
famous proximity fuze. One of the
revolutionary batteries powering the
electronic devices of this fuze as well
as some of its other component parts
was a Hoover engineering develop-
ment. This work alone required over
145,000 man-hours.
The moral of the story is this: be-
cause Hoover engineering sets the
pace in its important industry it
calls for the kind of men and experi-
ence that people look for when the
going gets rough.

The Problem
The scientist and science student of
today can no longer look upon the work
of science as being concerned only with
the advancement of knowledge or the
solution of particular industrial prob-
lems. The developments of the exact
sciences have become such dominant
factors in modern life that their social
consequences must be a primary con-
cern of the scientist as well as the
economist and public official. Scientific
developments and their social conse-
quences cannot be separated; neither
can we afford to consider as separate
the planning of future research and the
acceptance of responsibility for its re-
sults.
The question of what use society shall
make of technology is not merely a
matter of academic interest which can
be deferred for later consideration. Cer-
tainly when we survey the consequences
of the war, it should require no drama-
tic phrases to make us realize that we
must make our technological potential
work for society on a basis of world-
wide cooperation; or, as the only al-
ternative, see it destroy that society
completely.
How shall we analyze the problem?
Perhaps a review of recent history may
give some insight as to the current trend
of technology and social organization.
Modern science and industry have de-
veloped in the surprisingly short period
of two hundred years. In the Seven-
teenth and Eighteenth Centuries men
such as Galileo and Newton laid the
foundation of the experimental scientific
method. Since then our knowledge of
the physical world and the applications
of that knowledge have accumulated
like the integral of some higher exponen-
tial function of time. The effect upon
daily life has been indeed far reaching.
Two hundred years ago most of the
work of the world was done by human
hands and human backs. Today steam
power, the internal combustion engine,
and the electric motor have been put
to work to the extent that every person
in an industrialized nation has many-
times his own strength in "mechanical
slaves" working for him day and night.
Chemistry and metallurgy have made
abundant materials of amazing proper-
ties for use in clothing, shelter, trans-
portation vehicles, and other objects
for our comfort and convenience. The
efficiency of agriculture has been in-
creased four-fold. In the United States,
twenty-five percent of the nation's
working people are able to supply our
own needs for agricultural products as
well as an export market. In contrast,
an undeveloped economy such as that

without an end. Today science can
offer the promise of sufficient energy
and material goods for all the needs of
humanity.
As part of the doctrine of individual
rights upon which this democracy is
based, the private ownership of prop-
erty was extended to all citizens; and.
as a result, economic control of the
growing technology fell into the hands
of those individuals best able to manipu-
late the new institutions of the private
property system, viz., corporate finance,
patent laws, etc.
On the other hand, partly as a result
of certain failures of the capitalistic,
privately owned and directed economy,
and partly because of the less indi-
vidualistic temperament of Central and
Eastern European peoples, new forms
of state controlled economy called so-
cialism and communism have developed.
The fact remains, however, that none
of these systems has yet succeeded in
utilizing the full potential of science
for constructive purposes. Each must
face the same problem of allocating re-
sources effectively and each encounters
the same difficulties in overcoming the
shortsightedness of selfish interests and
in finding intelligent, trained personnel
for public office. Essentially all systems
of social organization require at least
as well trained personnel as the science
which produces the technology that they
direct.
Thus, a summary of humanity's pres-
ent problem reveals this; a rapidly
growing technological potential directed
by systems of social organization which
are also developing but not rapidly or
efficiently enough for the task they must
perform.
We are apparently confronted by an
unequal race between science and the
ability of organized society to utilize
science constructively. The greater the
discrepancy between scientific and so-
cial development, the more severe and
destructive are the depressions and wars
which result when social organization
breaks down.
What shall be done? Some people
say declare a moratorium on science.
However, not only would such a thing
be practically impossible to do, but also
it would constitute a completely nega-
tive approach to the problem. The en-
richment of life through scientific devel-
opment is the only real basis for ending

EDITOR'S XOTE: Because of the im-
portance of acquainting all engineering
students with the existence of State
Registration we are reprinting the Mich-
igan Law in its entirety; all others are
similar.
Who is an engineer? Is engineering
a profession? Should an engineer be
restricted in the public practice of his
special skills? Should, and by what
means, an engineer attempt to elevate
his technical position and achieve rec-
ognized superiority over the many tech-
nicians and draftsmen with whom he
works and associates, all of whom often
seem to be doing identical work? These
and other similar questions are fre-
quently being asked today. Modern
engineering and manufacturing have
been developed on a scale never before
realized, and the complexity and variety
of work necessary for production have
created many confusing impressions
about engineers and engineering.
Too often overlooked in the publicity
and advertising of manufactured arti-
cles and other engineering projects, the
engineer occupies a blurred position in
the public eye. He is considered to be
everything and anything, from an execu-
tive in charge of many men and of dol-
lars of property to a plumber's helper,
or anyone engaged in routine technical
tasks. It is no wonder that engineering
as a career should be regarded by the
public with wonder and with a great
deal of ignorance. The succeeding para-
graphs of this paper are the result of
an attempt to explain who is an engi-
neer, whether or not his work should be
accorded professional standing, and how
an engineer can increase his technical
eminence.
WHO IS AN ENGINEER?
First, who is an engineer? Obviously,
the plumber's helper cannot be consid-
ered to be one, since he does his work
in accordance with the exact specifica-
tions and instructions of someone much
more competent, technically, than him-
self. Also, an executive may be able to
plan and direct much work by depend-
ing upon other men for technical advice.
Such a man cannot be considered to be
an engineer. Even between these two
extremes there is an infinitely wide band
of productive activity, within which an
engineer operates and must be classi-
fied. There has been no perfect defini-
tion of an engineer or of engineering.
The best attempts are clouded with
vague expressions and generalizations,
because engineering occupies a very
large and varied part of modern life.
An extremely generalized definition is
that "engineering is the art of applying
the laws of the natural sciences, includ-
ing mechanics and thermodynamics, to
the utilization of the materials and
forces of nature in producing facilities
for the benefit of mankind, and the art
of organizing the human effort in con-
nection therewith." Coupled with this
explanation, the responsibilities of an
engineer include "the entire range of
technical and executive direction in-
volved in the production of fuels and
industrial materials, the planning and
erection of structures, the design and
fabrication of industrial products, the
planning and operation of utility serv-
ices, the ordering of industrial plants
and processes, the sale of technical
products and their adaptation to special
uses, and the administration of techni-
cal enterprises, both private and public."
These definitions of an engineer and
engineering are worthless for legal pur-
poses. On the other hand, to completely
define and describe these two terms
would require reams of paper and car-
tons of aspirin tablets for the lawyers
attempting the job. The only way out
is to decide upon a reasonable, yet gen-
eral, definition, and to establish the
means to study and legislate in conflict-
ing instances. A legal definition will
follow after a discussion of the need for
engineering legislation.
ENGINEERING—A PROFESSION?
Whether or not engineering is a pro-
fession has been seriously argued by
many thinking persons, within and out-
side the spheres of engineering practice.
As our standard of living becomes more
and more dependent upon our indus-
trial activity, larger numbers of engi-
neers are entering into positions of so-
cial and economic leadership. These
people, particularly, believe that the art
or ability to administer and direct tech-
nical activity has reached so great in
importance in our economic life and has
resulted in so incalculable value and
service to mankind that their work, like
the services of doctors, lawyers, or
clergymen, has already reached profes-
sional stature and must, therefore, be
considered in its present relation to so-
ciety's needs.
These administrative engineers con-
sider the ability to lead people and to
direct technical projects the minimum
requirements for a "professional" engi-
neer. However, before they can super-
vise engineering problems, they must
be able to understand and apply the
basic engineering principles and tech-
niques which are integral parts of the
end results. With this preceding sen-
tence as an argument, many technical
people believe that the minimum re-
quirements of a professional engineer
should be such that the ability (coupled
with actual experience) to perform
highly specialized technical work should
classify a person in professional status.
In any case, engineering is being in-
creasingly regarded as a profession, and
the public is demanding more and more
protection against faulty engineering, at
least in public works projects. The big-
gest job. therefore, is to define accur-
ately engineering activity and to set up
legal machinery whereby an engineer
can present proof of his abilities, as
evidenced by his work, and can achieve
a professional engineering status.
ENGINEERING RESTRICTIONS
Even before World War I, responsi-
ble citizens in the United States saw
the need of restricting technical work,
particularly work involving public struc-
tures, to competent men who would be
able to preserve the public safety. In
1915 an act for the registration of archi-
tects had been passed in Michigan and
in several other states. These first laws
provided for the licensing of architects,
to restrict architectural design to men
who were fully acquainted with the
strength requirements of buildings and
could design structures which would
possess a necessary factor of safety.
14
THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


ing had advanced and expanded to such
a degree that it was believed necessary
to extend the principle of registration to
engineers engaging in public works
projects. Accordingly, in 1919, the
Michigan legislature passed a law which,
although it extended licensing to civil
engineers, had no real "teeth" in it. As
a result, many "old-timers" were classi-
fied as engineers, merely on the basis of
their long years of technical work, even
though many of them were still incom-
petent.
The primary difficulty in creating an
efficient registration law is in writing an
accurate definition of engineering. Many
states have gone ahead with practically
useless registration laws, while other
states have seen fit to declare unconsti-
tutional any registration act which
would be unenforceable because of its
vagueness and lax requirements. The
Michigan legislature, however, in 1937,
passed a law which has been a great
improvement over the act of 1919, but
which will be further strengthened and
improved by amendment, as time and
necessity demand. This Registration Act
is officially known as Act 240, P. A.
1937. It is "an act to license and regu-
late the practice of architecture, pro-
fessional engineering, and land survey-
ing; to create a state board of registra-
tion on architects, professional engi-
neers, and land surveyors, and to pre-
scribe its powers and duties; to impose
certain powers and duties upon the state
and the political subdivisions thereof,
in connection with public work; to pro-
vide penalties for the violation of the
provisions of this act; and to repeal all
acts or parts of acts inconsistent with
the provisions of this act." (The rest of
the act follows).
THE PEOPLE OF THE

air cargo
Since the end of the war, the airlines
of the nation have been devoting a good
deal of time and energy to the question
of air cargo transportation. Air cargo
is an all-inclusive term which excludes
only passengers and is applied to such
cargoes as passenger baggage, mail,
freight, and express. One of the chief
reasons for this emphasis on air cargo
transportation is that the rate of profit
for it exceeds that for passenger trans-
portation.
To investigate the future and the
characteristics of such cargo, Air Cargo.
Inc. was formed as far back as 1941.
This organization sent thousands of
questionnaires to industries, suppliers,
and producers of perishable goods ( such
as flowers, fresh fruit and vegetables,
etc.). These questionnaires asked the
various firms if they would find it profit-
able to ship their product by air to
certain places at certain rates. The an-
swers to such questions will not only
aid the design of planes to accommodate
the product, but will also determine the
future of airline organization as well.
The results of this and a number of
similar surveys has indicated the prac-
ticability of air cargo transportation.
Today American, Eastern, United, and
TWA (the leaders in this field) average
34 daily all-cargo flights covering over
45,000 route miles from coast to coast.
To carry the brunt of the present freight
loads, the airlines are extensively using
"stripped down" Liberators and two
million air-freight pound-miles. Another
plane which has proved to be profitable
is the Consolidated Vultee Model 39
which has been used by West coast food
shippers.
In addition to these types of planes
a number of new cargo planes are now
in the design or test stage. The DC-4
and the DC-6 big brothers of the D-3,
have more than met the requirements
of economy, speed, and greater load ca-
pacity. More than fifty of each of these
planes are now on order by the cargo
airlines. When enough are in service a
reduction of the present freight rate is
expected. The new C-54 (a flying box-
car) will have a payload of 19,000


pounds and a 2.500-mile cruising range.
Still in the experimental stage is the
DC-8 which has been called the '•flying
egg-beater" because it has one pusher-
type engine and propeller on top of the
fuselage and another on the tail. It
will carry more than twice the payload
of the old C-47 and will travel twice as
fast.
When considering the types of car-
riers for air cargo in the future, the

airship or dirigible should not be over-
looked. The fine record of performance
by Navy blimps during the war has
given the airship a place in air trans-
portation of the future. Supporters of
the use of airships list these several
assets of this mode of transportation:
paved runways could be dispensed with
(only a mooring mast is needed), air-
ships have a speed 3 or 4 times faster
than steamships, the freight rate would
be low in comparison to other means of
air transport. Even now. plans are
underway for the construction of a new
dirigible which would be a third larger
than the ill-fated Macon and Akron.
Airlines are now transporting a num-
ber of types of freight and express
which benefit by the decreased time in
transit. The general nature of the air
cargo is to carry perishable soil-products
on the west-to-east and the south-to-
north flights and return with small
manufactured articles. The policy is to
never "dead head" a flight, that is to
fly a load to its destination without ar-
ranging for a return load, because of
the great overhead involved in flying an
empty plane.
A California company, which has
been conducting test shipments of per-

a large variety of goods on its return
trips. On one occasion, B-29 parts urg-
ently needed in the pacific were flown
back and once a load of gas kitchen
ranges were shipped back by air to a
housing project. The success of air
shipment of perishable foods and flowers
and equipment, the future of air cargo
transportation seems to be nearly un-
limited. Air transportation makes us
think in terms of hours and minutes in-
stead of days or weeks or miles and
disregard our old yardsticks of measur-
ing shipping time. Even in view of
great interest shown in air cargo trans-

Courtesy
rests not only on lowering costs by
obtaining a return cargo in advance of
shipment, but also on the fact that the
consumers will pay more for fresh prod-
ucts. This leads to a new slogan for air
transport to get there "fustest with the
freshest."
Besides carrying perishable food-
stuffs, air transportation in the future
will benefit a number of shippers. On
the basis of the results from a number
of questionnaires it has been determined
that the leading shippers would be the
small tool-and-die industry, the automo-
tive parts industry and the pharmaceu-
tical industry and related products. It
is quite evident that only goods which
have a high value in comparison to their
weight can be shipped profitably by air.
Still another goods which is coming to
use air transportation is that type whose
value depends on style or fashion, such
as women's apparel. In the future such
"fashionable merchandise' would be
available overnight.
At present the chief hindrance to
widespread use of air cargo transpor-
tation is the high cost involved. Until
rates are about 10c per ton-mile, air-
lines will not be able to compete effec-
tively with railway express. The pres-
ent air cargo rates vary from 25c to
45c per ton-mile while air express rates
are as high as 65c per ton-mile. On
January 1, 1946, these rates were re-
duced 13 percent, and further reduc-
tions are expected.

electric power in airplanes
A recent cartoon which received wide
spread publication depicted the elec-
trical engineer's idea of an airplane, an
elaborate electrical system consisting of
motors, generators, radios, inter-com
sets, and batteries, all suspended in
space with no evident means of support,
such as wings. At first, this representa-
tion appears amusing but actually 90%
of the accessories used in modern air-
craft are actually run by electric power.
The panel of a modern four-engine
bomber contains more than 50 instru-
ments 35 of which are electrically oper-
ated, a far cry from the plains from the
last war.
Although it may be seen at first
glance, that electrical appliances play
as large a part as possible in the oper-
ation of aircraft, there are several func-
tions which only the pilot has been able
to carry out so far. Elements of judg-
ment, such as the most economical fuel
feed to the engine on long flights, proper
propellor pitch, and the technique of
take-offs and landing have never been
made automatic. Yet, in their endeavor
to make flying as safe as possible, in
other words to eliminate the personal
factor insofar as possible, several large
airlines are conducting extensive re-
search in the development of electrical
controls which can take over all of the
pilots duties.
At the present time, there are usually
four levers in a cockpit to control each
engine, which are the throttle, the mix-
ture, the propellor governor, and the
supercharger. All these levers must be
adjusted for minimum fuel consumption
for satisfactory performance at a given
altitude and speed. If these four levers

The American Society of Mechanical
Engineers was organized in 1880 and
now has a membership of over 27,000.
Its eighteen divisions provide profes-
sional objectives in subjects ranging
from Aviation and Applied Mechanics
to Railroads and Management. The So-
ciety publishes such technical transac-
tions as "Mechanical Engineering" and
research reports on work done by many
of its members. Students who have
M.E. 3, M.E. 7, etc. behind them are
familar with the Standards and Test
Codes formulated by this Society which
have insured Industry with safe, eco-
nomical equipment and processes.
A.S.M.E. gives its members the op-
portunity to meet and mix business with
pleasure. While it is not expected that
student members will have much busi-
ness to discuss outside of studies, these
meetings give them the opportunity to
meet industrial representatives and view
their future job background. Speakers,
representing the many phases of Indus-
try, are brought in from time to time
to talk about their company, its poli-
cies, and present and future prospects
for Mechanical Engineers.


But Michigan's chapter of A.S.M.E.
is not altogether concerned with the
technical side of engineering. It plans
to engineer a few suds studies down by
the Huron this semester. Research shall
decide whether the local Cream Top can
be improved upon, if a beer bottle can
be self-cooling, and if beer can't be de-

meetings last around an hour. All Me-
chanicals are eligible for student mem-
bership. Dues at $4.00 for twelve

share a common interest in engineering
studies and activities and to offer guid-
ance to those who are new in the field.
We hope to secure some good speak-

The University of Michigan branch
of Electrical Engineers, is unique in
that it was founded even before its sec-
tion branch in this state. It has grown
steadily ever since 1911, and today
boasts of the largest membership in its
history—ISO.
The Institute has increased the num-
ber and importance of its activities along
with its membership. At the dance held
in the League in January, "Pic" Mag-
azine took pictures. An excellent tour
to the Ford River Rouge Plant was
sponsored by this organization recently.
This year, the A.I.E.E. will participate
in the annual regional conference and
hopes to present several student papers
at that time.

At the recent banquet, the new of-
ficers for the year were elected. They
are: Chairman, Lee Russell, Vice Chair-
man, Steve Squillace, Secretary, Belle
Sperling, and Treasurer, Bob Allword.
Professor Gault will remain as counselor
to the group, since he has proved to
be such a strong guiding hand and in-
spiration in the past. A.I.E.E. is an up
and coming organization on this cam-
pus. At every meeting, a worth-while
speaker is presented; for example, Dean
Crawford spoke at the last banquet-

Robert H. Sherlock, Professor of
Civil Engineering, to most of us is a
man behind the scenes, whose influence
is felt but who is seldom seen. His in-
terests in the educational field are as
varied as an undergrads curriculum.

Robert H. Sherlock
Professor Sherlock earned his Bache-
lors Degree at Purdue University,
graduating with the class of 1910. Dur-
ing the following thirteen years he was
affiliated with the American Bridge
Company of Toledo, Ohio. During his
stay with them his services were fre-
quently loaned to other companies.
The variety of projects which he under-
took were many and diversified. He
also had many leaves of absences to do
engineering work of various natures,
such as designing reinforced concrete
structures, gun foundations for patrol
boats and general structural and archi-
tectural designing. This experience was
to stand in good stead in later years for
in 1923 he joined the teaching staff as
an assistant Professor with the inten-
tions of staying but two years. But
time passed as it will, and contrary to
his epectations he liked teaching and
has remained on campus, receiving his
full Professorship in 1933.
Much of his time is spent in research
along such lines as Abrams Law of
Strength, the grading of aggregates for
concrete and the "Structure of the
Wind." Although Professor Sherlock's
special field is Design and Analysis of
Structures, the Structure of the Wind
has so intrigued him, that he has spent
over seven years collecting data. It all
started when on a project concerning
the 'Loading and Strength of Aerial
Structures' in 1927. The Structure of
the Wind is far from being a simple
subject. On one project over one hun-
dred thousand observations were made
before study could be begun. These
were made over a period of four years
during the winter storms. This subject
is made up of various phases such as
Wind Gusts, Atmospheric Turbulences.
Eddies in Air Flow and many others.
He is the author and co-author of many
publications dealing with the wind.
Along with being the author of a
great many articles, he is a member of
a number of professional and honorary
societies. Sigma Xi, Tau Beta Pi, Phi
Kappa Phi and many others.
Aside from pursuing his profession
he has found time to be on different
college and university committees, hav-
ing been a member of the Executive
and the Discipline Committees, and the
committees on Post Graduate Studies
and Standardization of Scholastic Dis-
cipline. During the war period he was
on the Executive Committee of Emer-
gency Training and was coordinator for
the Engineering, Science and Manage-
ment War Training program on campus.
At the present time he is chairman of
Advisers fo Veterans in the Engineering
College and is on the University Co-
ordinating Committee for Veterans Serv-
ice.

It was in June of 1944 that Howard
Haftel convinced the U. S. Navy to
send him to the U. of M. The U. and
Howard have profited ever since. His
scholastic standing and scientific ac-
tivity have contributed . . . but wait
let's start from the beginning.
This Haftel contribution to the Irv-
ington, New Jersey, population was
born in January, 1925. (He isn't afraid
to laugh in the P-Bell, and talk above a
whisper.) Since his father was settled
in Irvington as a retail merchant, How-
ard grew up there. He entered the
public school in Irvington, and after
grasping everything that his grade-
school teachers could teach him, How-
ard entered Frank Morrell High School.
While he was there he showed his ath-
letic ability by winning a letter in ten-
nis. The fact that he was in every
society for scholastic achievement that
exists and valedictorian of his class
proves that he was capable of great
accomplishments. Howard further dis-
played his potentialities when he placed
among the forty winners of the national
Science Talent Search of 1943.
About this time Howard became
eighteen, "the unlucky age" of the dec-

Howard Haftel
ade, and Uncle Sam started giving him
the eagle eye. By the time the eye was
focused and the questionnaire sent.
Howard had joined the Navy and was
sweating out boot camp. After boot
camp he received fire-control training.
Eight months after he had joined the
Navy Howard received a chance to join
the \T-12 unit. He passed the exams and
was sent to Tufts College in Medford,
Mass. For two semesters Howard held
his own in the engineering college at
Tufts. After this time the Navy was
for him.
As soon as he arrived at Michigan

The room was filled with haze of grey
smoke, and a constant mumbling of
voices greeted me as I stepped into it.
Occasionally, the tinkling of glasses
could be heard. As my eyes moved
about the room, my head naturally fol-
lowed them. At the far end of the room
sat a counter. He was counting pennies.
Near the back wall, there stood a slot
machine with an old, dirty sign above
it. The words on it being hardly dis-
tinguishable. I moved nearer. The mes-
sage inscribed thereon was "In case of
an air-raid, gather around this machine.
It hasn't been hit in the last twenty-
years." One still sees relics of those
hazardous war years.
At a table near by, I saw two boys
from the Engine School with glasses of
that "forever amber" liquid in front

of them. The topic of discussion be-
tween them s?emed to be the March
edition of the TECHNIC.
"If I ever get my hands on this
McHigan person, I'll reduce that nine-
to-five ratio of male to female students
registered this term." commented one.

With that. I promptly made my way
towards the door. But, alas. I was not
swift enough. There were two shouts
and the race was on. For some reason
or other. I set sail for the Arboretum
with the two engineers close at my heels.
Making the "Arb" in sixty seconds flat.
I proceeded at all angles and deviations
trying to shake them off. When the op-
posite side of the park was reached, I
looked back and, to my delight, my
pursuers were no where in sight.
I pondered the reason why I had so
quickly lost them. Was it my elusive
running—or were they distracted by
something. As I was thinking over this
perturbing question, a familiar voice
started ringing my eardrums.
'McHigan! McHigan! Wake up.
You can't sleep there on the couch all
dav."

Then my superior added "Get up and
face the issue!"
"What issue?'' I asked.
"Issue is or issue ain't going to write
that April Reflex?"

The housing shortage is so acute this
term that your humor editor has been
using the TECHNIC office for his living
quarters. Of course. I don't get any of
my homework done but after all. my

A very interesting subject with which
to finish this article would be a com-
parison of the enrollments in the Uni-
versity during the past four years. With
this in mind, yours truly journeyed over
to the Rackham Building and, with the
cooperation of the lady in charge of the
Dept. of Statistics. I was able to obtain
all the necessary data in short order.
From these figures, the following curves
were plotted. Attention is called to the
fact that there were two terms to the
1941-42 year and three for all of the
rest.
The first graph contains the total
number of students enrolled in both the
Engine School, and the entire Univer-
sity plotted against the respective years.

WHAT KIND OF POISON IS THIS?
some poisons are killers. Others are
preservatives. Creosote is one of the
"others" ... a protective agent which
preserves timber against the attacks
of decay, termites, and marine
borers. Those destructive agents
cause millions of dollars worth of
damage every year . . . but when
wood is pressure-treated with creo-
sote, it becomes toxic to them.
Koppers pressure-treats about
50,000 carloads of lumber and other
forest products every year. Its creo-
sote treatments baffle decay, ter-
mites, and water worms. Other spe-
cialized treatments make wood re-
sistant to acid and abrasion, as well
as to decay and fire.
The result is that wooden struc-
tures of all kinds . . . bridges, farm
buildings, railroad ties, telephone
poles ... all last more than three
times as long as they used to. And
this, in turn, helps to conserve
America's invaluable forests.
Wood preserving is only one Kop-
pers activity. Koppers also makes
paving and roofing materials, de-
signs and builds coke ovens, manu-
factures piston rings, couplings,
chemicals from coal and engages in:
many other activities. That's why
Koppers is known as "the industry
that serves all industry." Koppers

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



Resistors dressed
in carbon
Early in the war, shortages of high
resistance wire finer than a human
hair, threatened the output of radar,
electrical gun directors and high-
frequency radio equipment.
Calling upon experience gained in
telephone work, Bell Laboratories
and Western Electric engineers broke
this bottleneck with deposited car-
bon resistors.
The base for one such resistor is a
ceramic "pencil." This base slides
through an automatic machine oper-
ated at high temperatures and re-
ceives a deposit of carbon film. Helical
grooves are then cut in this film to
provide a long, high-resistance path
for the electric current.
Great savings resulted. For ex-
ample: each 1-megohm deposited
carbon resistor unit saves about one
mile of wire, weighs about one-tenth
as much and costs only one-twelfth
for Engineers
as much as wire-wound units! In one
war year, the saving was equivalent
to more than 25,000 pounds of 46
gauge alloy wire.
Ringing the Bell
on Reconversion!
One of the elements that makes the
telephone ring is a pair of ringer coils
—each coil \yi inches long, tightly
wound of 39 gauge copper wire. A
horse hair is thick by comparison! So
fine is this wire, that women with
mechanical ability having fingers
capable of fine needlework are selected
to operate the complicated automatic
machines which wind the coils, eight
at a time, on one "stick."
Reconverting for production of
ringer coils was one job for Western
Electric production engineers. On the
first Monday, exactly 80 coils-
enough for only 40 telephones—were
wound. On the fourth Monday, 8,232
coils were wound.

That's just one example of how
production engineers have been ring-
ing the bell on reconversion in mak-
ing the 429 parts which go into the
combined dial telephone set.

Prospecting for
Mica
in a Junk Heap
Until war put the clamps on ship-
ping, mica from India held top place
in the manufacture of capacitors used
in radio circuits. As the shortage
became acute, old methods of stamp-
ing out blanks by hand—which
wasted a lot of mica—had to go.
Western Electric engineers attacked
the problem of cutting down this
wastage—devised a machine to hold
the sheets of mica during punching.
This machine made possible the
production of capacitor blanks from
sheets of mica smaller than ever
before usable—reduced scrap to a
minimum. What's more, output
soared—operators were less fatigued
and worked more safely—inspectors
found fewer imperfect blanks in each
trav.
Manufacturing telephone and radio apparatus for the Bell System is Western Electric's primary job. It calls
for engineers of many kinds—radio, electrical, mechanical, chemical, metallurgical. Many of the things they do
—whether seemingly Utile or big—contribute greatly to the art of manufacture of communications equipment.

economic and political conflict. A much
more constructive solution would be to
couple scientific research more directly
with a parallel program of research and
training in economics and governmental
processes.
The next question to be answered is
how such parallel development could be
assured. In the collectivistic types of so-
cial organization, coordination of scien-
tific development with social science
would be a function of government.
Definite allocations of personnel and
money would be made as a part of the
planned economy. Soviet Russia as well
as prewar Germany and Italy have
made considerable efforts to promote
scientific research, and the development
of their governmental organizations con-
stituted in itself an experiment in so-
cial planning. A matter of more direct
concern to the American people is the
choice of a method, in keeping with
our institutions, by which we can pro-
vide for adequate mutual development
of science, economic methods, and gov-
ernmental organization. Shall we assign
the job of coordination to government,
depend upon the voluntary action of
private enterprise, or seek some semi-
public agency removed from the imme-
diate pressures of politics? It is the
purpose of the second portion of this
article to make a proposal for your
consideration.

received through grants and endowments
for scholarship and research. Profits
from industrial research contracting
would be divided in proportion to in-
vestment, although it might be desirable
to choose some other basis for voting
on policy direction in order to prevent
domination by the wealthier schools.
The organization would operate on
the following basis: Contracts would
be made with the customer concern for
the solution of a particular problem or
for a long-range research program. The
shorter type of production problem
solution could probably be undertaken
on an estimated-fee contract basis,
whereas the longer range program would
be arranged on a cost-plus-percentage
basis.
At the head of the whole organization
would be the Board of Policy Direction
consisting of members representing the
participating universities. This policy
board would be assisted by members of
the permanent staff and advisors repre-
senting industry. The policy board
would be responsible for the permanent
Administrative Staff consisting of the
general manager and the heads of sub-
sidiary divisions.
Acting under the administrative of-
ficers would be a Secretarial and
Records Office, Treasurer, University
Liaison Office, Contract and Legal Staff.
Personnel Office, Purchasing Depart-
ment, etc. Also included would be a
Department of Publications charged
with the preparation of reports, organi-
zation journals, and articles to appear
in established scientific journals. An-
other adjunct to the organization as
whole would be a Library with dross
references to the libraries of the member
universities and other scientific organi-
zations. The Library would perform
a literature review service for the re-
search divisions.
The main work of the organization
would be carried on by five research
divisions. The first is a Division of
Fundamental Science engaged in basic
studies of the nature of matter, energy
and life processes. It is through this
division that the organization would
perform one of its main public services
and attain one of its primary objectives,
for it would have at its command facili-

The practice of land surveying within the
meaning and intent of this act includes the
surveying of areas for the correct determina-
tion and description and for conveyancing,
or for the establishment or reestablishment of
land boundaries and the plotting of lands
and subdivisions thereof.
(No person shall publicly use the term
"architect," "professional engineer" or "land
surveyor" in connection with his name unless
such person is registered under the provisions
of this act.)
The term "board" as used in this act shall
mean the state board of registration for archi-
tects, professional engineers and land survey-
ors, provided for by this act.
STATE BOARD OF REGISTRATION
Sec. 3. There is hereby created a state
board of registration for architects, profes-
sional engineers and land surveyors, which
shall be vested with the administration of
the provisions of this act. Said board shall
consist of three architects and four profes-
sional engineers who shall be appointed by the
governor for terms of seven years each, ex-
cept that the members of the board first ap-
pointed hereunder shall hold office for terms
of one, two, three, four, five, six and seven
years, respectively, as may be designated by
the governor. One member of the board shall
be from the upper peninsula. Members of the
board shall qualify by taking and filing the
constitutional oath of office with the secretary
of state, and shall hold office until the ap-
pointment and qualification of their succes-
sors. On the expiration of the term of any
member, the governor shall appoint a regis-
tered architect or registered professional engi-
neer, as the case may be, to take the place
of the member whose term on said board is
expiring. Each member of the board shall be
a citien of the United States and a resident
of this state, and shall be a registered archi-
tect or registered professional engineer. Va-
cancies shall be filled for the balance of any
unexpired term, in the same manner as the
original appointment. The governor may re-
move any member of the board for misfeas-
ance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office.
Sec. 4. Members of the board shall serve
without compensation but shall be entitled
to their actual and necessary traveling and
other expenses incurred in the performance of
their official duties. The board shall have the
power to appoint such employes and assist-
ants as shall be necessary for the proper exer-
cise of the powers hereby granted. Employes
and assistants shall receive their actual and
necessary expenses incurred in the discharge
of their official duties. Compensation and ex-
penses of all assistants and employes shall
be paid from the appropriation made there-
for by the legislature. The board is author-
ted to incur such expense as shall be required
to carry out the provisions of the act, to be
paid from the appropriation made therefor
by the legislature.
Sec. .1. The board shall hold an organiza-
tion meeting within sixty days after this act
shall become effective, and thereafter shall
hold at least two regular meetings each calen-
dar year. Special meetings shall be held at
such times as the rules and regulations of the
board shall provide. Notice of all meetings

After this act ihall have been in effect
five years the board shall issue certificates of
registration only to those applicants who meet
the foregoing requirements of this section.
Any person having the necessary qualifica-
tions prescribed in this act to entitle him to
registration shall be eligible for such registra-
tion though he may not be practicing his pro-
fession at the time of making his application.
All registrations as architects, professional
engineers, or land surveyors tinder the laws
of this state and legally in force at the time
this act becomes effective shall continue in
force until they legally expire under the pro-
visions of the act which authorized them. All
persons previously registered as architects,
professional engineers or land surveyors in
this state and whose registration is legally in
force at the time this act becomes effective
may renew their registration as provided for
renewals under this act.
FEES
Sec. 13. Applications for registration shall
be. on forms prescribed and furnished by the
board, shall contain statements made under
oath, showing the applicant's education and
detailed summary of his technical work, and
shall contain not less than five references, of
whom three or more shall be architects or
professional engineers or land surveyors hav-
ing personal knowledge of his architectural or
engineering or land surveying experience.
The registration fee for architects and pro-
fessional engineers shall be twenty-five dol-
lars, fifteen dollars of which shall accompany
application, the remaining ten dollars to be
paid upon issuance of certificate. When a
certificate of qualification issued by the na-
tional council of architectural registration
boards or the national bureau of engineering
registration is accepted as evidence of quali-
fication, the total fee for registration us
architect or professional engineer shall be ten
dollars.
The registration fee for land surveyors
shall be fifteen dollars, which shall accompany
application.
Should the board deny the issuance of a
certificate of registration to any applicant,
the initial fee deposited shall be retained as
an application fee.
EXAMINATIONS
Sec. 14. When examinations are reauirfd,
they shall be held at such time and place as
the board shall determine. The scope of the
examinations and the method of procedure
shall be prescribed by the board with special
reference to the applicant's ability to design
and supervise architectural and engineering
works, which shall insure the safety of life,
health, and property. Examinations shall be
given for the purpose of determining the
qualifications of applicants for registration
separately in architecture, in professional en-
gineering, and in land surveying. A candidate
failing on examination may apply for re-
examination at the expiration of six months
and shall be re-examined without payment of
additional fee. Subsequent re-examination
shall be granted upon payment of a fee of
five dollars.

Since this law has gone into effect,
hundreds of engineers have been regis-
tered, and the results have been encour-
aging. An engineer, by proving his
ability to pass the necessary registration
requirements, gains considerable prestige
in his work, and proves that he is capa-
ble of advancing into more responsible
positions. While the professional regis-
tration of engineers is at present limited
to public projects, many outstanding
engineers have expressed the hope that
engineers as a group will soon be re-
quired to register. Thus, the public

matic electric controls so that the en-
gine, for any desired operation would
follow the power curve and give the
least economical fuel consumption, a
great stride toward making living more
automatic would be taken. Furthermore
if the four single levers controlling the
four engines could be combined into
one, the engine control would need only
the adjustment of one lever and the
only requirement of the pilot would be
the speed desired at that altitude. So
far, all but the mixture control have
been experimentally combined, reducing
the controls of a four engine plane from
16 to 8, but over-riding switches are
built in, since this combination is still
not completely reliable.
With an automatic pilot, an estab-
lished fact, and automatic engine con-
trol, two of three factors required for
automatic flying would be solved. There
is a third however. Landing a plane still
requires considerable skill of the pilot;
could it be controlled automatically?
THE TECHNIC EXPLORES
(.Continued from page 17)
The pilot must locate the airport, learn
the weather conditions, lower flaps and
landing gear, slow down to landing
speed, and manipulate the stick cor-
rectly in or to make a successful land-
ing. Some of these things could be done
automatically; a radio beam could de-
termine the direction and distance to
the runway, an accurate altimeter could
lower the flaps and the landing gear at
the correct altitude and perhaps deter-
mine the landing speed, and at the
proper moment, the stick would be
pulled back for a perfect landing. All
of these controls can conceivably be
made automatic by the development of
suitable electrical circuits. Changing
cams or other mechanical means actu-
ated by a push button would compensate
for varying wind velocities, etc.
If all these factors which govern the
flight of an airplane can be made re-
liably automatic, the aircraft of the
future will be absolutely safe, even
more so than the present day train
travel.
There are a few other factors in which
the airlines must look to the electrical
engineer for help. At low pressure,
corona effects weakens the insulation.
Furthermore climbing to high altitudes
and descending again causes condensa-
tion effects which makes most insulation
deteriorate rapidly, necessitating con-
stant maintenance. Before flying is ab-
solutely foolproof, existing electrical
controls must be made much more re-
liable than they are at present. Insula-
tion breakdowns are the commonest
source of trouble in maintaining elec-
trical power, and new insulation must
be found which will stand the rough
usage in the air.
The field of research is wide open for
the enterprising electrical engineer who
can develop the automatic controls now
needed or who can improve the main-
tenance of electrical power within the
aircraft itself. As these improvements
are made, flying will become a mode of
transportation that will hold the con-
fidence of everyone.

Says the U. S. Bureau of Standards, in Cir. No.
80, "by far the best protective metallic coating
for rust-proofing iron or steel" is ZINC.
That statement has been true for over a
hundred years, and is likely to be true for a
long time yet.
Zinc in the form of a coating protects against
rust in two ways:
First, by simple coverage, with a sheath of
rust-resistant metal.
Second, by electro-chemical action, or "sac-
rificial corrosion"
Stop Rust! Cut Costs!
Save Materials! ... with ZINC!
Buildings, equipment, machinery — in all of them the use
of zinc for protection against rust is good engineering and
sensible economy. Zinc can be applied by hot-dip galva-
nizing, electro-plating, sherardizing, or as a metallic pig-
ment; all these methods are sound and practical for various
applications...And specify Aeavy coatings, for the heavier
the zinc coating, the better the protection, the longer the
service life, and the lower the cost.

Alpha Chi Sigma
Alpha Chi Sigma is a national pro-
fessional fraternity founded to bring
together men interested primarily in
chemistry and chemical engineering.
There are more than forty collegiate
chapters and some twenty odd profes-
sional chapters throughout the country.
The alpha beta chapter was founded at
the University of Michigan in 1916 by
a group of faculty men and advanced
students, and an active chapter has
been maintained ever since. Member-
ship has consisted of upper-classmen,
graduate students, and a majority of the
faculty of both the chemistry and chem-
ical engineering departments. Members
have been chosen on the basis of both
personality and scholarship.
The fraternity combines the aspects
of social and strictly professional fra-
ternities in that up until 1944, it main-
tained a house and held social functions,
but at the same time carried on activi-
ties of a strictly professional character
such as awarding a scholarship, and
sponsoring lectures on chemistry.
The present active chapter numbers
only eleven, which is below the prewar
level of between twenty and thirty, but
with the return of many veterans and
the increased enrollment, membership is
due for a boost. The fraternity has a
strong faculty and alumni backing to
which it owes a great deal of thanks for
carrying it over the difficult periods in
its history.
The officers of the fraternity at pres-
ent are:

twin motor drive
Several years ago steel mills were
built with one d-c motor on each roll.
It was a twin motor drive on a motor
driving the top roll and the other the
bottom roll. The system worked well
indeed, but that was on blooming mills
where the thickness was large. Whether
one motor turned a little faster than the
other made little difference.
Now two big mills are equipped with
twin motor drives that are to roll the
steel sheet down as thin as five thou-
sandths of an inch. Here perfect syn-
chronism is essential. Furthermore
there can be no substantial variation in
speed with a change of load. Getting
two d-c machines with these flat char-
acteristics to share load is a very dif-
ferent thing than with drooping charac-
teristics.
This feat is being accomplished on
four twin motor drives for two cold
strip mills by an adaptation of a scheme
developed years ago for securing parallel
operation of two or three d-c generators
furnishing power to reversing blooming
mills. As its principal element it em-
ploys a zero-voltage generator with two
fields, each in series with the series field
of one of the twin-drive motors. The
voltage of this little generator remains
zero until one of the twin motors takes
more load than its mate, whereupon a
correction voltage of the right magni-
tude and polarity is created to effect
speed recovery.
improved molybdenum
Molybdenum has been in high de-
mand for a long time. However, its
remarkable properties have been almost
solely of academic interest to designers,
since it has been available to them only
in sheets the size of a playing card, or
some such similar small and simple
shape.

shapes, has finally been removed. More-
over, the cost has been reduced to about
one-third. This metallurgical feat has
been accomplished by a plant devoted
to the manufacture of lamps and other
electronic tubes.
Moly's melting point of 4,748° F. has
long attracted many designers. How-
ever, this same property has prevented
its manufacture in large units. No con-
tainer known can withstand the heat
required to convert it from the pow-
dered form it takes after preparation
to large and complicated solid shapes.
Now, however, through modern elec-
tronic devices, it can be molded into
any desired shape.

By new processes, molybdenum is avail-
able as a structural material in many
shapes.
The excellent properties of moly are
now available for a variety of uses. The
most important characteristics are its
high melting point and great wear-re-
sistance at elevated temperatures. It
also has a higher modulus of elasticity,
increased strength when hot, and better
thermal conductivity than any steel. It
has a lower specific heat and coefficient
of expansion than any steel. Its corro-
sion resistance compares very favorably
with tantalum, palladium, and plat-
inum; each of which costs many times
as much as moly.
large engine dynamometer
The rapid increase in the horsepowers
available from aircraft engines is graph-
ically displayed by the history of the
dynamometers to test them. It is cus-
tomary for engine builders, when pur-
chasing dynamometers, to order them
twice as large in horsepower rating as
the largest engine available at the time.
This allows for future growth in engine
capacities. With the exception of two
4,000 hp dynamometers, at the war's
beginning most of them were capable
of absorbing about 2.000 hp. The new-
est one, well under way at the close of

The number one job for 45 graduate engineers and 85 other members of
the Hoover engineering staff is to keep The Hoover Company and the Hoover
Gleaner the leaders in their fields. But in doing that job as thoroughly as it is
done at Hoover, they're bound to come up with developments that have
important applications in other fields.
One piece of evidence: The 879 patents granted to Hoover on engineering
developments include 274 that have been sought and used in other manufac-
turing industries—many of them far removed from the home appliance field.
This modern four-story brick building, with a total of
60,CXX) square feet of floor space and containing up-to-
date laboratory equipment, is the Hoover Engineering
Department.
The Hoover Cleaner is "born" in the development
engineering division, where teamworking skilled de-
signers, inventors and engineers plan tomorrow's elec-
tric cleaners.
The laboratory division studies and tests, rejects or
recommends each component part of each new product
"to be."
Mechanical engineers measure noise and vibration,
design fan systems, study cleaning methods and solve
power transmission problems in developing new designs.
Electrical engineers develop and test motors, wiring,
switches, lamps, etc., designing the right power plant
and accessories for a Hoover.
Product engineers solve manufacturing problems,

the war, will be good for 7,700 hp. To
obtain so much energy absorption
ability this big one uses the same basic
machines, but instead of a single d-c
generator and a single eddy-current
brake, it uses two 850 hp d-c generator
and two 3,000 hp eddy-current brakes.
All four machines are coupled together
on one shaft, although the d-c generator
on one end can be disconnected from
the other three and used for independent
testing of small engines. Instead of the
usual weight scale to measure torque,
the pneumatic indicators are used in
which torque is measure by air pressure.
east-west compass
A new type of magnetic material
which will point east and west rather
than north and south when placed in
a compass has been developed recently.
The magnet is called silmanal after its
components; silver, manganese, and
aluminum. Such a device is made possi-
ble through silmanals ability to be mag-
netized widthwise rather than length-
wise.
No particular practical use has been
found for such a compass other than
as a novelty. Its chief advantage, how-
ever, is its extreme high roercine force,
which permits it to withstand severe
demagnetizing effects. Because of its
high resistance to demagnetization, sil-
manal has found use in electrical relays
and in instruments where service in
strong electrical fields is required.
This unusual material is ductile and
malleable rather than hard and brittle
as most magnetic metals are. It can be
easily machined, punched, rolled, or
ground. Various sizes and shapes can
be held to very close tolerance. Becai&amp;
of its ductility, silmanal can be in rod,
or sheet form or even drawn out in form
of wire.
new light on flying
One of the most valuable devices to
assist a pilot in landing in his plane
at night is an approach-angle indicator.
The pilot literally comes in on a beam
of colored lights. This unit projects
three colored beams toward the ap-
proaching plane. The beams are all 16
degrees wide. The top one is amber and
is eight degrees thick. This indicates
the plane is above the proper approach
angle. The middle one is a two degree
green beam which represents the true
approach angle. The bottom one, six

Horizons off Chemistry
constantly beckon . . .
Dow is deeply interested in colleges and technical schools and maintains
close ties with them. The very nature of our business makes this a logical
course for us to pursue.
We are producers of chemicals essential to industry and agriculture. We
are developers of plastic materials. We are the pioneer producers of mag-
nesium, recovering this lightest of all structural metals from ocean water.
We are developers of magnesium alloys and methods for their fabrication.
To carry on this work, research is a necessity and a considerable portion
of our efforts and resources are devoted to it as an undeviating policy.
All these activities require trained men—scientists and technicians—
chemists and chemical engineers—metallurgists, biologists, physicists,
entomologists. Dow employs such men in large numbers—keeps an eye on
them as they emerge from their academic training—gives many of them
special schooling at the Dow plants, according to the jobs they are slated
to do.
In peace as well as in war, chemistry is an essential occupation because it
deals with materials essential to industry and to the health of the nation.
It is a developing business with horizons that constantly beckon—a
profession to intrigue any ambitious young man with an eye to the future.

The overlap of colors is very slight.
Even at one mile the zone of color tran-
sition is only about four feet wide. The
secret of such remarkable color-beam
fidelity is the lens system. The unit
comprises a reflector, a 100 watt single
plane filament, and a series of live clear
lenses and three color filters. The lens
system not only provides sharp color
separation but also magnifies the light
ten to one.
To prevent mistaking the red or green
beams for obstacle markers, the beams
are flashed. This is done by tipping a
vane across the light beam to cause the
interruption. To turn the vane a tiny
high-speed motor drives a cam. which
forces the vanes to more than 90 de-
grees into the light path against a light
spring. By variation of the cam. pro-
portions of light on and off periods can
be controlled.
torpedo motor
One of the requirements of the Navy's
long secret and deadly weapon, the
electric torpedo was a motor to bring
the small gyroscope of its control
mechanism from a standstill to the full
speed 12,000 rpm in 0.2 seconds. The
best available motors did this in a mini-
mum of 10 seconds. Calculations
showed the desired motor would have
to be 1200 times more powerful. The
size of the motor, too, was limited as
there is little space in a torpedo. Fur-
thermore the motor was required to
declutch or disengage itself from the
gyro instantly at the end of the 1 5
second, and disconnect itself from the
power supply.
The motor was created and the re-
quirements were fully met. The motor,
which has an instantaneous rating of
22 Hp., can be held in one hand.
million-pound electric
locomotive
A new million-pound "super-giant"
electric locomotive. 143 feet long,
destined to be the most pow?rful con-
tinuously-rated electric locomotive in
the United States, is being built for use
sometime in 1946. More of these en-
gines are to be built in the future, main-
ly for the use of heavy coal-hauling
operations over the Allegheny moun-
tains.
This new engine will be the first of
any kind of locomotive to carry a
weight of one million pounds on the
drivers. The present high is about 900,-
000 pounds.
The most valuable feature of the en-
gine will be its rating of 8,000 horse-
power. 6.800 of which will be available
continuously at the rails. This is an
increase of 800 horsepower over the
presently most powerful locomotives.
The starting tractive effort of the en-
gine will be 260,000 pounds, based on
267f adhesion to the rail. It will have
a continuous tractive effort at 15.75
miles per hour of 162,000 pounds. This
is an increase of 50,000 pounds over
present-day locomotives. This extra
power means that the engine will be
able to pull 10,000-ton coal trains up
heavy grades at moderate speeds.
The design of this engine calls for
two 4.000-horsepower motor generator
sets which will supply energy to a d.c.
traction motor. The motor will be
geared to each of 16 driving axles under
the two-cab unit. Stations generated
by coal will send power through this
system.
high-power aircraft engine
Until recently, the 2100-horsepower.
liquid-cooled airplane engine, which
established three newr world records for
engines of its type and greatly advanced
military and commercial conception of
aircraft-engine performance, has been
on the restricted list of the War De-
partment. This remarkable engine re-
cords power output of 1.5 horsepower
per cubic inch of displacement, weight
of only .78 pound per horsepower, and
a maximum diameter of only 32 inches.
The engine passed the Army tests in
mid-1944 with a rating of 2100 horse-
power. It is a 12-cyiinder inverted V-
type engine, weighing 1645 pounds, de-
veloped for use with a supercharger.
Twenty-three experimental engine
were sent to the Army Air Forces.
These tests proving successful, these en-
gines were used as a pioneering engine-
development, to explore high brake-
horsepower per cubic inch displacement.
The results proved that engines could
be built for maximum pressures of 1600
pounds per square inch.
The engine itself was not put into
production, since the Army decided to
have various aircraft-engine corpora-

THIS isn't a fashion picture today, nor
was it in 1896 when it appeared in
newspapers all over the world. But this
picture prompted a London department
store to take advantage of the occasion
by advertising and selling "x-ray proof
dresses."
It was also reported that x-rays would be
used by medical colleges to implant ana-
tomic diagrams directly into the brains
of future doctors. And some people sug-
gested the whole business be forgotten
before the new rays brought about the
total destruction of mankind.
Such was the popular reception accorded
Roentgen's discovery of the x-ray SO
years ago. Few people, even scientists,
could foresee that within a half century
this discovery would become a major
weapon against disease, and an industrial
tool that would help win World War II.
Corning first appeared in the "x-ray pic-
ture" some 30 years ago, when the de-
velopment of this science seemed to be
reaching its limit unless tubes could be
produced of a glass capable of high trans-
mission of x-rays and capable of with-
standing extreme heat and high voltages
for long periods of service. Here is where
Corning skill was instrumental in fur-
nishing bulbs to x-ray tube manufacturers,
just as it has furnished glass with special
properties for countless other fields
... all the way from elaborate labor-
atory apparatus to glass cooking
utensils, from giant airway beacon
lenses to an all-glass pump for handling
corrosive acids. Corning, with its years
of experience, is anxious to help you
learn all abou t glass today. For tomorrow,
that knowledge will come in handy on
your new job. Why not write us? Corning

tions use its many advantages separate-
ly, rather than go to the expense of
tooling an entire new factory. More-
over, there was a need for a larger and
more powerful engine. Accordingly,
facts about this new engine were dis-
tributed among various other manufac-
turers who could fill the requirements.
micro-balancer
About ten years ago, a dynamic bal-
ancing machine, capable of analyzing
vibrations due to unbalance, with an
amplitude of twenty millionths of an
inch, was put into use. At that time,
it was thought that a finer degree of
unbalance measurement would never be
required. However, that ability to
measure unbalance effects is too crude
for many present-day high speed rotat-
ing parts. To balance sensitive parts,
so that they may function properly and
without failure, it is necessary to reduce
the amplitude of its vibration due to un-
balance to a fraction of a millionth of
an inch.
To meet these requirements, the
fundamental principles of the original
balancer were used in conjunction with
a superior type of amplifier to produce
the new microbalancer. This machine
can measure and locate unbalances that
produce vibration amplitudes of as small
as a quarter of a millionths of an inch.
A weight of one-millionths of a pound
at a two-and-one-half inch radius on a
ten pound rotor, will create such an
effect.

No. 5 A Good Engineer Must
Go on Learning
AS BACCALAUREATE SPEAKERS are
-^^ prone to point out, a degree in engineering is
not the ending—but only the end of the beginning.
Here at The Timken Roller Bearing Company,
a firm made up largely of engineers, we know it
to be a fact that what and how much an engineer
learns during the first years following his gradua-
tion usually have a decisive effect on his future.
It seems to us highly important for a young
engineer to locate where he will have an oppor-
tunity to learn.
That is why a job with The Timken Roller
Bearing Company has so much to offer sound-
thinking, ambitious young engineers.
■ To give these men the
chance to go on learning and developing, our
company operates a "Work-as-You-Learn" Plan
of training. No classroom work is involved; only
productive work in the various departments of
our factories and steel mills.
While performing a wide variety of jobs,
trainees work with many engineers who are con-
sidered the best in their field. They have the
chance to observe methods and ask questions
about every operation in our business. All the
while, they are closely watched. When particular
aptitudes show up, trainees are assigned to the
line of work for which they are best fitted.
But that does not end the learning period. To
be successful in this company, an engineer never
can afford to stop learning.
■ We do business with
every industry in America. Our engineers are in
continuous contact with the top engineers in
hundreds of companies in every phase of enter-
prise. They must keep pace, or in many cases,
keep ahead of progress in every industry. Because
of that, this company deliberately fosters a rest-
lessness—a "never-be-satisfied" spirit among its
men as a spur to do the job better.
If you are willing to accept the challenge of
continual progress which a job with this company
offers, we would like to talk with you. The first
qualification for training under our "Work-as-
You-Learn" Plan is a Bachelor of Science de-
gree in Engineering. Write The Timken Roller

The VT, or radio proximity, fuze is
a device which is installed in the nose
of an artillery shell and which will
cause the shell to burst at the instant
it comes within lethal range of its tar-
get. This fuze operates as a miniature
sending and receiving radio station in
the nose of a shell. When the shell
leaves the gun, this station begins to
send out a continuous radio frequency
signal, not a short pulse as in radar.

Photo Courtesy ISCO
One of the rugged tubes from the
V-T fuze.
When a target is approached, part of
the radiated signal is reflected back to
the fuze and an impulse is set up in
the fuze by the interaction of the radi-
ated and returned signals. This im-
pulse is amplified by an audio-frequency
amplifier in the fuze and is fed to a
thyratron tube which serves as a switch
to initiate the detonation of the projec-
tile. The detonation of the projectile
is accomplished by an electrical deto-
nator much like a dynamite cap. When
the thyratron is triggered by the impulse
generated on approach to a target, it
causes enough electric current to pass
through the electrical detonator to make
it explode. This explosion sets off an
auxiliary explosive charge, or booster,
carried in the fuze, which in turn deto-
nates the explosive filling the projectile.
The basic components of the radio
proximity fuze are (1) miniature "rug-
ged" vacuum tubes, strong enough to
stand the tremendous stresses of being
shot from a gun, as essential elements
of simple electrical circuits; (2) a mini-
ature rugged battery to provide electrical
power; and (3) safety devices to pre-
vent operation of the fuze until it has
traveled to a safe distance from the gun.
The success of the VT fuze is a
tribute to continuous and effective col-
laboration by research groups, industrial
organizations, and the military services.
It is also, in a sense, the payoff on a
"long shot," because many of the prob-
lems seemed practically unsolvable at
the beginning.
The idea of influence, or proximity-
fuzes is not unique and was suggested
independently by various persons in the
United States and abroad long prior to
1940. However, the obstacles in the
way of actually developing a fuze of this
type seemed insurmountable. Many
technically inclined people who have
witnessed an antiaircraft demonstration
have toyed with the idea of a proximity
fuze. The small target area presented
by an airplane, together with its isola-
tion in space, practically forced a con-
sideration of a fuze which would deto-
nate automatically in the vicinity of the
airplane.
British scientists were working on
proximity fuze devices for rockets and
bombs at least as early as 1939. Cap-
tured documents indicated that German
work on proximity fuze development be-
gan in the early 1930's, and was still
in process when hostilities ended in the
European Theater.
Although inventors suggested almost
every possible type of proximity fuze,
in both prewar and war years, they
failed to indicate how the formidable
development and engineering difficulties
could be satisfactorily overcome. Such
fuzes to be useful for artillery purposes
would have to be capable of withstand-
ing the shock of acceleration when shot
from a gun, which is of the order of
2,000 g in addition to undergoing a high
rate of rotation in flight. Many patents
on proximity devices were issued in
various countries, but these also failed
to indicate how the invention could be
manufactured.
Early in World War II, it became
disturbingly evident that the speed,
maneuverability and heights attainable
by modern military aircraft presented
a method of attack against which the
fuzes currently available for antiaircraft
guns were relatively ineffective. This
fuze which is actuated by a clock, deto-
nates the shell at a fixed length of time
after leaving the gun, consequently a
slight error in the time setting causes
the shell to explode at a harmless dis-
tance from the target. Even with the
improvements in directing antiaircraft
gunfire made possible by radar, dimin-
ishing probability of hitting elusive at-
tacking planes made the problem of de-
fense against aircraft extremely urgent
for a nation involved in the war.
At the request of the Navy Depart-
ment, Bureau of Ordnance, work on the
VT fuze was begun on August 17, 1940.

quonset huts
A product of the urgent needs of the
war, a new type of building has been
developed and extensively used which
bids fair to make its influence greatly
felt in postwar construction. Called
Quonset huts, these have been used on
every one of the many fronts in a global
war. They were used at military bases
in the United States, on all the islands
in the Pacific where Allied forces were
gathered, in India, Africa, Iceland,
Alaska and Europe.
When Guam was taken, the quick
erection of Quonset huts helped to make
that island one of the most complete,
modern and efficient bases in the Pacific.
The Quonset huts were all-purpose
structures. Built by the Sea-Bees at
Guam, these buildings provided a per-
fect answer for permanent administra-
tive quarters, barracks, and supply cen-
ters. The little island was covered with
clusters of Quonset huts. Since Guam
was the Navy's principal Western Pa-
cific base for a long time, a considerable
administrative force was quartered on
the island. Those Quonset huts housed
the offices, were utilized as post ex-
changes, the base bank, recreation halls,
chapels, post offices, supply stores, re-
pair shops, and many other units on
that island. Quonset hut combinations
were also used extensively. Three or
four units, forming the legs of a com-
pound "E" may be joined at the back
by a long Quonset unit. Large siz?
Quonsets were designed for use as a
base hotel, or as administrative build-
ings. Whenever a base required the use
of a hall, seating 1500 to 2000 people,
these large-size Quonset units were
quickly constructed and filled the needs
of the base.
The large structure, double the width
and triple the length of a conventional
unit were two-story buildings which, de-
spite the huge bulk, were built so quick-
ly, on Guam, that Jap snipers were still
being killed on the island long after the
Quonset units were built and in use.

The interior of a Quonset hut may be decorated very attractively.
All these Quonset huts are of the
same simple design. They consist
fundamentally of a steel frame covered
with corrugated steel plate, so that the
end result looks like a huge cylinder
which has been split horizontally
through its axis, making two Quonsets.
Many combinations can be formed,
connecting a series of normal-length
Quonset units at right angles to an
extra-long unit. These unit frames,
which are manufactured in sections,
can be combined into a Quonset hut of
almost any length. Further work can
convert these buildings for any need—
as barracks, meeting hall, store, office,
and for many other uses.
Now that the war is over and many
of the army and navy bases will be
dismantled or at least decreased in size,
many of the Quonset huts will be torn
down, to be scrapped or sold as sur-
plus. However, in the minds of the
men who lived in these structures, Quon-
set huts occupy a significant place.
These huts have shown great versatility
in use and have been easy to construct,
being of prefabricated design. It is no
wonder, therefore, that many service-
men, in their minds' eye, have specu-
lated on the possibility of peacetime ap-
plication of these very practical huts.
The returning servicemen, having been
responsible for many of the ingenious
adaptations of Quonset huts, have al-
ready expressed a desire to secure them
for civilian use.
Seeing much more than military use
in these structures, some servicemen
would like to con%'ert them for use on
farms. They might be ideal as tool or
equipment sheds, storage bins, dairy
barns, chicken sheds—or anything
which would not require a huge struc-
ture, but would depend upon simplicity
of design, ease of constructing and low
cost.
Other men believe that Quonset huts
have tremendous potentialities as sum-
mer homes or beach cottages. Erected
in a pleasant summer location and fin-
ished in wood paneling, these huts
would provide a comfortable, and luxur-
ious, yet not too expensive, place to
spend an enjoyable summer.
These huts may be used for housing
machine shops or repair shops. If the
Quonset units could be installed and
ready for use at much less cost than a
conventional masonry building, then
the Quonset huts might be seen in all
the cities of America, being used by
small business as a means of reducing
initial investment.

An exterior view of a Quonset hut that is to be used as a small home.
Quonset huts are factory-produced
units which have proved their worth and
versatility in the wars. To what ex-
tent they will be used in civilian life
will depend primarily upon their cost
and permanence of installation. They
are applicable in many ways in modern
life and business. The postwar decades
will see a great deal of small scale con-
struction, and if Quonset huts can com-
pete economically, they may be in the
forefront of our building industry.
electric propulsion
In the past twenty years, wide use
has been made of electric propulsion
for ships, both by direct and alternating
current. Although this means of pro-
pulsion had a humble beginning and
progressed slowly at first, there are now
in operation in the United States more
than 870 propulsion units of the tur-
bine-electric type totaling over 7.600.-
000 shaft horsepower. More than 940
Deisel-electric units totaling approxi-
mately 2,600,000 shaft horsepower have
also been built or contracted for. The
turbine- electric type with a-c drive has
found its widest application in driving
passenger and cargo liners, tankers, and
coast guard cutters. Deisel-electric
units with d-c equipment are used to
drive special classes of vess?ls requir-
ing a good deal of maneuvering, while
a-c drive is utilized on vessels requiring
a considerable amount of power and in-
frequent maneuvering.
The first application of electricity to
move ships is accredited to the Russians
who experimented in this field over a
hundred years ago. In 1839 they built
a boat propelled by an electric motor
with energy supplied by a 69-cell stor-
age battery. However, the motor proved
to be a weak link and the experiment
was soon forgotten. About 1887 both
the British and the French built several
submarines fitted with electric motors
fed by storage batteries. In 1903, the
Russians again built a river boat de-
pending on electric propulsion. The
machinery consisted of three three-cyl-
inder Diesel engines, each driving a
generator and exciter and three propul-
sion motors, each drive a screw. The
control system was of the variable volt-
age type.
The first use of the a-c system of
propulsion was made by the British in
1910 on a small passenger launch. It
had a single Diesel engine driving an
alternator with independent windings
for four or six poles and a propelling
motor wound for 8 and 12 poles. The
motor had a squirrel cage and bridge
control was provided. The next devel-
opment was made in the United States
in 1913. when the Navy made an ex-
perimental installation on a 5,400 shaft
horsepower twin-screw ship. The plant
involved two propulsion turbine-gener-
ator sets applying power to wound rotor
induction motors.
These early installations were heavy
and bulky and operated at about 30
cycles. During the last IS years, many
developments have taken place which
have improved this type of propulsion
equipment. Developments in welding
have accounted for a considerable sav-
ing in weight and space of machinery.
The operating speeds of the turbine-
generator sets have been materially in-
creased so that some modern units op-
erate at 90 cycles. Through experience,
testing, and research, a much better
knowledge has been obtained of actual
performance characteristics. Electric
equipment can now be designed to fit

FLECTS
Good morning, afternoon, or evening,
which ever the case may be. When
writing an introduction to such articles
as these, I always recall what one beam
said to another: "Don't bother bracing
yourself, what you see here will never
knock vour Ts' out."

Last Sunday evening, I stood in front
of the radio directing the 1st Piano
Concerto of Beethoven with my slide-
rule in hand. After the first movement,
however, I got so keyed up that I de-
cided to pitch in on the REFLECTS for
May. Great difficulties were immediate-
ly encountered in making the words flow
from my pen as did the notes from the
piano. After considerable research, it
was discovered that there was no ink in
it, (the pen, not the piano). As I was
just about to render an oration with
a vocabulary not at all suited for sab-

bath evening, my roommate interrupted
me with "You should have expected
that. Everything in Ann Arbor is dry
on Sunday."

The tentative list of graduates for the

The demand for engineers in all of
these fields at present exceeds the sup-
ply and the graduates will have little
trouble in getting positions. In the
cases of the Aeronautical and Electrical

engineers, they will have to be careful
or shall find themselves trampled by
the representatives wanting to inter-
view them. Prof. Conlon has been kept
busy these last few weeks trying to ar-
range a reasonable schedule for the
interviewers who have been clamoring
to "get at" the June graduates in the
Aeronautical Engineering field. The
majority of the graduates here are Navy
V-12 men who have been "hitting the
books" steadily since the latter part
of 1943 and who probably would like
a little rest before they start work. The
same applies to the Naval Architects
who are ready for the diploma.
The main reason for the present day
demand for Engineers is due most likely
to the fact that the returning veterans,
besides being interviewed by Detroit
Free Press reporters, are still in the
process of getting a degree and otheiv
are returning to positions they held be-
fore the war. Since a goodly number of
these veterans have only two or three
terms left to complete, it is anticipated
that this demand may be reduced con-
siderably in another year.
That just about covers all the items
for this issue so I will close with "May
you all have a happy June."

The Sliderule Ball has come and gone
again and the only traces that it left

were a few grey hairs in the domes of
the Committee. It seems that when the
posters arrived for one Band, a change
had to be made and new posters ordered.
This kept up all during the sale of the
tickets and made the task just a bit
tedious. It is estimated that about ten
percent of the total Eng. School enroll-
ment attended the dance.

The circulation of the Detroit Free
Press fluctuated quite a bit one week
in Ann Arbor. Wednesday morning a?
I was walking down State St.. I noticed
people stopping dead still in the middle
of the side walk and uttering all sorts
of exclamations. They had just gotten
around to reading the front page of the

paper. The Free Press reporter must
have been quite hard of hearing because
everyone involved declared that he had
been misquoted. By the time this gets
into print, the storm will most likely be
subsiding and it is impossible to predict
any of the results.

In winning the victory of the Pa-
cific the U. S. navy was confronted with
more varied difficulties than ever before
in its history. Not the least of these was
the problem of repairing combat and
auxiliary craft which had been damaged
by the enemy. Speedy repair was es-
sential for it is a maxim of the Navy's
that "... the cheapest and quickest
way to build a ship is to repair one al-
ready built." In the battle of the Pa-
cific, especially in its later stages, our
fleet ranged far from any large bases
and if a vessel was heavily damaged, it
was a long trip to Pearl Harbor or the
West coast. As a result, the provision
of adequate dry-dock facilities was one
of the major problems that had to be

solved by the Board of Naval Opera-
tions.
Even in 1939, reports showed that
dry-dock facilities were far from ade-
quate in the Pacific; by 1941 and the
Japanese strike at Pearl Harbor, steps
had been taken to overcome these weak-
nesses. By resorting to modern con-
struction practices as well as several
newly developed techniques of placing
large volumes of cement under water, a
huge graving dock was constructed at
Pearl Harbor, 50% larger than the pre-
vious one, and was ready for operation
in the middle of 1941. Similar graving
docks were also built in Norfolk, Phil-
adelphia and New York.
Since 1940 the Navy has ordered 183
dry-dock units at an estimated cost of
51 million dollars. About 60% of these
are light, highly mobile floating dry-
docks, ranging in size from these de-
signed for submarines and torpedo
boats to larger units to service cruisers
and battleships.
Although the U. S. Navy was estab-
lished in 1775, it was in 1834 that
money was first appropriated by Con-
gress for dry-docks in the Navy yards.
At that time the masonry lined grav-
ing docks were built one at Boston, and
the other at Norfolk. Ordinarily, when
the wooden warships of that period
needed to be repaired and freed of bar-
nacles and marine vegetation, the ships
were hove down in shallow water at
high tide and tipped to expose the
bottom first on one side and then the
other side, the work being performed
at low tide. Heaving down was a long
and tedious operation and often caused
permanent deformation of the ship's
hull. Obviously there was great practi-
cal need for graving dry-docks, and
these dry-docks were developed and
built.
Ultimately, floating dry-docks were
designed and built. The graving, or
fixed, dry-docks was still considered to
be more desirable, since it was of more
permanent construction than a floating
dry-dock.
Floating dry-docks built in the mid-
dle 1800's lasted for more than 50 years
and they were outdated only because

PRESENT

e. m. prof
Richard T. Liddicoat, Assistant Pro-
fessor of Engineering Mechanics, has
been associated with the University in
one way or another for the past thirty-
four years.
Born and raised in the Upper Penin-
sula, he worked as a hard-rock miner
for the first few years after graduation
from Calumet High School. He then
switched to the seemingly unrelated oc-
cupation of teaching country school on
the shore of Lake Superior.

Richard T. Liddicoat
In 1912. he arrived at the University
to begin the long and pleasant associa-
tion which has been interrupted only
once. While a student, he served as
assistant to Edward Eriksen and John
Vanderberg. Four years later, he re-
ceived his Bachelor's Degree in Civil
Engineering and an appointment to the
position of assistant mining engineer
for the Solverine Copper Mining Com-
pany.
This particular job was short-lived,
however, as World War I soon broke
and he joined the Army, serving with
the 29th Engineers in France. Imme-
diately upon his discharge from the
Army, he returned to the University to
contact some of his former instructors
and found a teaching job in the De-
partment of Engineering Mechanics
waiting for him.
While at the University, Prof. Liddi-
coat became interested in the develop-
ment of the helicopter and initiated con-
siderable research on the problem. Dur-
ing this time, he achieved what he calls
"very moderately successful" flights
with a 125-pound model having a wing
span of twenty feet. He maintains,
however, that the successful results of
the experimentation were due in large
part to his assistant, Henry Abrams,
who later graduated from the Archi-
tecture School and became a practicing
architect in Detroit.
During the years from 1927 to 1935.
Prof. Liddicoat engaged in extensive
study of mechanics under Dr. Stephen
Timoshenko, who at that time was on
the University faculty. Prof. Liddicoat
remembers installing quite a few water
systems during the summers of some
of these years when he had a contract-
ing business.
After taking his Master's Degree in
Mathematics in 1931, he was granted
a sabbatical leave and took his family
to Cambridge where he studied a semes-
ter at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Granted another sabbati-
cal leave in 1939, Prof. Liddicoat re-
versed direction, taking his family to
Pasadena, where he spent a semester at
the California Institute of Technology.
Prof. Liddicoat received his Doctor's
Degree in a phase of classical hydro-
dynamics the following year. During
the war, he has participated in several
active research projects for the Army
and Navy.
Prof. Liddicoat has two sons, one of
whom has received a Master's Degree
in Minerology and served in the Navy
during the war: the other having left
college to join the Merchant Marine.
At the risk of appearing sentimental.
Prof. Liddicoat describes his wife, the
former Miss Carmen Williams of Kear-
sarge. as a "childhood sweetheart."
Prof. Liddicoat. a member of the
Methodist Church, is actively associated
with the S.P.E.E. and the American
Society for Testing Materials. In 1942.
he presented a technical paper before
the S.P.E.E. meeting in New York. In
addition to several contributions to the
TECHNIC, he is the author of the
laboratory manual for Testing Mate-
rials, and several pamphlets for the use
of his own students.

That fellow you have undoubtedly
noticed bobbing in and out of the Engi-
neering Arch is Harold Walters. He's
not headed to a fire; he's just trying
to get to his ten o'clock after holding
a discussion with the deans and profes-
sors on how the engine school should
be run.
Harold, a 21-year-old BMOC. was
born in Canton. Ohio, where he dashes
quite frequently for a week-end. He
entered grade school there, and although
he didn't understand Einstein's theories
until he was in the higher grades, he
was still way ahead of the average stu-
dent. In high school, Hal displayed his
athletic prowess along with his scholas-
tic acclaim by winning a letter for his
service on the track team.

In November of 1943, with his slide
rule under his arm and his beanie on
his head. Harold charged through the
Arch for the first time. Hal proved to
be a zealous freshman. His constant
efforts were for a worthy cause, for after
the cloud of books, papers, slide rule,
etc., had cleared, Harold emerged as a
member of Phi Eta Sigma.
His activities really began to stack
up in the spring of 1945 when he joined
Phi Gamma Delta, became a member
of Triangles, and secured a position on

with Dr. M. A. Tuve of the latter insti-
tution as director. The research group
soon outgrew its quarters at the Depart-
ment of Terrestrial Magnetism, and
moved to a large building in Silver
Springs, Maryland, with Johns Hopkins
University as the official contractor. To
Dr. Tuve, who remained the director
until the completion of the job, should
go the credit for supplying the initiative
and drive which put VT fuzes in the
hands of our armed services in time to
have a vital influence upon the course
of the war.
The University of Michigan had an
important part in the development of
the VT fuze. Besides supplying at least
twenty men from its faculty and student
body to the research staff of the central
laboratory, an intensive research pro-
gram was carried on at the University
under the authors' direction, in which
about twenty trained scientists were en-
gaged. Performing thousands of re-
duced-scale experiments near the gravel
pits at Dixboro, the local research group
solved a vital problem nearly a year
before the first fuze was fired in combat.
This problem was to find (a) the exact
point in space at which the actual, full
scale shell would explode, relative to the
airplane, for all angles and distances of
approach and (b) how to alter the in-
ternal construction of the fuze so as to
improve the burst pattern and make the
fuse more effective.
The first VT fuzed ammunition was
fired from the cruiser Helena in Janu-
ary, 1943, against attacking enemy air-
craft, with spectacular success.
The story of the performance of the
VT fuze is best told by giving a few
excerpts from the official Navy and
Army reports from overseas.
The following is an excerpt from a
report of the official U. S. Army ob-
server regarding the battle against the
V-l.
"The first employment of VT fuzes
against the enemy came with the first
launching of the V-l flying bombs against
London on 12 June 1944. The anti-aircraft
at first played a minor role in the defenses,
being allowed to fire only when the weather
was such that fighter planes could not op-
erate. ... By the first of July, it became
evident that the defense system could be
improved by allowing anti-aircraft firing
VT fuzes to engage targets without inter-
ference from the fighter planes. Conse-
quently, during the second week of July

the size of newer ships outgrew the size
of existing dry-docks. In 1901 the Al-
giers dry-dock was built at Sparrow
Point, Md.. It was designed to lift
vessels up to 16.000 tons displacement.
Floated to Algiers, North Africa, this
dry-dock remained at that base for 39
years until, in 1940, naval officers de-
cided to tow it to Pearl Harbor. The
structure was floated to the eastern en-
trance of the Panama Canal, separated
into three sections, and reassembled at
the western terminus of the canal. The
Algiers was then towed the 4800 miles
to Pearl Harbor, making the trip in 44
days. The main difficulties in trans-
porting this bulky craft were because of
the slow speed of 4.5 knots which was
maintained and the winds which caused
the drydock to swing off its course and
advance crab-like to the pull of the tow-
line.
Another floating dry-dock, the Dewey,
was completed at the Sparrow Point
shipyards in 1905. It was 500 ft. long,
130 ft. wide, 18 ft. deep and it had
sidewalls 45 ft. high. Upon completion
it was towed 13,089 miles to our naval
base at Olongapo in the Philippines. It
was towed to the Philippines via the
Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the Indian
Ocean, through all kinds of weather, so
that its transfer to the Pacific is epic
tribute to its sturdy construction.
Ordinarily floating dry-docks are not
designed for frequent shifting, but
rather they remain in service at a partic-
ular port or base. Their motion is verti-
cal—submerging to receive a vessel and
rising by discharging water ballast to
lift the docked craft out of the water
for repairs. When the necessary work
has been accomplished, the dry-docks
ballast tanks are refilled to cause it to
sink and to refloat the ship. However,
as the size and design of ships vary
greatly today, and since dry-docks are
expected to fulfill emergency needs, as
in war or the breaking of a ship's vital
parts, dry-docks are built to handle all
sizes of ships and, if necessary, to be
transported speedily to the scene of
repair.
Many dry-dock types had been de-
signed and tested by competent engi-
neers at the approach of the recent war.
Accordingly, when the U. S. became in-
volved in the war, the Navy was pro-
vided with the types of dry-docks which
fulfilled all its needs in the sea war-
fare which resulted. Made mainly of
steel, the designs incorporated lumber
and concrete in many places, and the
ingenious economics effected by the use
of these auxiliary materials have much
peacetime construction value.
A floating dry-dock is a vessel, but
some are box-like and must necessarily
be towed, while others are fitted with
tapered hulls and motors so that they
can proceed under their own power.
They were used in the Pacific either
to follow the fleets or to occupy posi-
tions at the new naval bases which were

This is how the problem of moving a drydock through the
Panama Canal was met. (Above) Six tiers of steel pontoons
were mounted on top of the side wall. (Upper-right)
Water was then admitted to some of these pontoons and
also to some of the bottom compartments on that side of
the dock section, causing it to heel over. The upper right

added it turned more, finally riding at an angle of 85 on

illions of American youngsters enjoy
the delicious thrill of adventure every
day with their favorite heroes of the
airwaves.
And every one of them would be bitterly disappointed
if anything were to interrupt the flow of electric power
which makes these exciting radio dramas possible.
A minor tragedy? Of course. But an indication,
nevertheless, of how much we have come to depend
upon a constant, uninterrupted flow of electricity for
our pleasures, our work, our health, our daily living.
Bartlett-Hayward Division of Koppers manufactures
a unit which helps to assure that steady, uninterrupted
flow of electric power. It's called Fast's Self-Aligning
Coupling. This coupling is used to join engines to
generators, generators to motors, motors to blowers and
pumps and other rotating power equipment. And the
coupling adjusts itself automatically to misalignments
of the connected machines, so that the motors keep run-
ning smoothly and the power keeps flowing.
This coupling has done its share to make Koppers "the
industry that serves all industry". Just as the designing
and building of coke ovens, the production of chemicals
from coal, the treating of timber, the making of roofing,
paving, piston rings and many other products have
played their part in helping Koppers to serve American

are metal muscles expressly created for
performing two functions in mechanical
bodies:
(1) Transmission of rotational power.
(2) Mechanical remote control.
S.S.White flexible shafts offer such im-
portant advantages that it will pay to
consider their use every time a power
drive or remote control problem comes
up in engineering design.
Suppose, for example, you have to
transmit power from one part of a ma-
chine to another where a straight line
drive is not practicable. The fewest parts
with which it can be done is an S.S.White
flexible shaft — a single mechanical ele-
ment that will provide a positive drive
between practically any two points, re-
gardless of turns, obstacles or distance.
This basic simplicity, plus their ready
adaptability to a wide range of power
drive and remote control conditions and
requirements, are main reasons why
S.S.White flexible shafts are used to the
extent of millions of feet annually — and
why engineers will find it helpful to be
familiar with the range and scope of
these Metal Muscles.

constructed during the war. They
greatly increased our fighting strength
by enabling crews to make speedy re-
pairs on slightly damaged ships or to
patch up badly crippled vessels prior to
sending these ships back to the states.
The Navy's floating dry-docks are
divided into four main classes: ABD's.
advance base sectional docks; ABSD's,
built from a number of ABD's; ARD's.
auxiliary repair docks, built of steel and
having ship-shaped hulls; and YFD's.
yard floating docks, assigned to a ship-
building or navy yard. Two other di-
visions are the ARDC's, auxiliary re-
pair docks of concrete construction; and
AFD's, steel auxiliary floating docks.
The ARD's have an overall length
of 490 feet, a beam of 81 feet, and
can accommodate our largest destroyers.
They are partially submerged by drop-
ping the gates at the open ends of the
docks and then fully submerged by
pumping ballast into hull-tanks. The
ship to be repaired then enters the dock
and is held in position while the repair-
ing basin is evacuated. Upon the com-
pletion of repairs, the dock is flooded,
the ship withdrawn, and another ship is
ready to enter the dock for overhauling.
Quarters for 107 officers and men are
provided in the upper sections of the
sidewalls which are ten feet wide. In
the lower section are the diesel gener-
ating sets which provide power for the
compressors, lighting circuits, and fuel-
oil pumps. ARD's are not self-propel-
ling but they are equipped with rud-
ders which help to seady them when
being towed or while being buffeted by
heavy winds or seas.
Reinforced concrete ARDC's are rect-
angular in shape, with rounded ends.
They are, like the ARD's open at the
ends and have similiar crew quarters
and provisions for equipment.
YFD's are made of steel, lumber and
steel, or entirely of timber, and are con-

America Learns to Make Its Own Camphor
For years, the Japanese main-
tained a tight hold on the world's
camphor supply.
Americans had to have camphor
in ever-increasing quantity for the
manufacture of photographic film,
celluloid, plastics, perfumes, medi-
cines, lacquers and disinfectants. But
they were forced to pay whatever
price the Japanese chose to ask. And
even at 1919's exorbitant top figure
of $3.75 a pound, they were never
sure of a full supply.
Men of Du Pont undertook to make
this country independent of such an
unsatisfactory source. They knew
that camphor could be synthesized,
but to make it at low cost and in
large quantities was an entirely dif-
ferent matter. Long years of experi-
ment and research produced little
but disappointment. But finally, in
1932, a way was found to produce
low-cost chemical camphor on a com-
mercial scale that matched nature's
product in color, texture, scent and
usefulness.
Ci0HI6O from Turpentine
Basic material from which Du Pont
camphor is made is pinene, obtained
from turpentine from southern
pine trees. The formula of pinene
(CioHi6) seems to differ but little
from that of camphor (doHi60), but
the structural difference is consider-
ably greater than is indicated by the
single atom of oxygen. Although the
chemical conversion of pinene to
camphor is not difficult to accom-
plish in the laboratory, to do so eco-
nomically on a commercial scale
taxed the ingenuity of many Du Pont
chemists, engineers and designers.
World War II completely shut off
the supply of natural camphor. But
within a few months Du Pont pro-
duction men were able to step up the
output of the man-made product to
take care of military, medical and
civilian needs. Today this supply is
going into the manufacture of hun-
dreds of products that will bring

more comfort, more satisfaction,
more joy into the lives of millions.
All the men at Du Pont—chem-
ists, mechanical engineers, civil en-
gineers, and hundreds of others who
worked on this development—feel
great pride that they were able to
free their country from foreign
sources for such a vital material in
our industrial life.

SYNTHESIS OPENS NEW ERA
IN PERFUME MANUFACTURE
Some of the most interesting discov-
eries at Du Pont have come from
"fundamental" research groups as-
signed to establish new scientific
facts without regard to immediate
commercial use.
Synthetic musk is an example.
Musk is the most important single
ingredient used in perfumery, a fixa-
tive blending many subtle odors into
one fragrance and making it lasting.
Until recently its only source was the
musk deer of Tibet, an animal near-
ing extinction.
Then Du Pont organic chemists, in
their long-time study of giant mole-
cules, noted that a group of ring
compounds called macro-ketones re-
sembled musk in odor. Following up
their observations with intensive re-
search, they produced compounds of
even more pronounced likeness.
Now, in "Astrotone," perfumers
are offered a synthetic musk that is
of a determined strength, immedi-
ately usable and as powerful as the
pure essence of natural musk.
Questions College Men ask
about working with Du Pont
"WILL AN ADVANCED DEGREE
HELP ME AT DU PONT?"
There are many Ph.D.'s at Du Pont.
However, the majority of our chem-
ists, chemical and mechanical engi-
neers, physicists and biologists are
Bachelors or Masters. Every effort is
made to see that full recognition is
made of a man's scientific training, as
well as his special experiences and
aptitudes. For certain openings, a
higher degree is a distinct asset.

stern, so that they can easily be towed.
They are 200 to 300 feet long, 64 feet
wide, and a docking space of 54 feet.
Self-contained, they contain internal-
combustion engines, electric generators,
air compressors, evaporators for a fresh
water supply, and all other necessary
equipment.
The most versatile developments in
floating dry-docks have been the ABD's
and the ABSD's, advance-base sectional
type. Consisting of structures made up
of several hulls, these docks are equip-
ped with sidewalls that can be lowered
to decrease wind resistance. The sec-
tional walls, 55 feet high and a 105 feet
long, are hinged at the bottom and can
be laid flat on the section's dock. ABD
units are identical to each other and
can be connected to a long series of
other ABD's, forming the combined
docks, ABSD's. Each section can lift
10,000 tons, so that seven units work-
ing together can handle a cruiser while
ten of them, with a total length of 830
feet, will accommodate our largest bat-
tleships or aircraft carriers. The dis-
tance between a section's walls is a
140 feet, while our biggest battleships
are no more than 110 feet wide.
Other outstanding features of the
ABSD's are their ability to handle ves-
sels longer than the measured length of
the dry dock. This would be impossi-
ble with permanently stationary docks.
Also, the stern or the bow can be raised
for repairs while the remained of the
ship in the dock floats.
When the power and construction fa-
cilities of the docks have been over-
taxed in an emergency, auxiliary docks
or barges containing the necessary ma-
chinery or power supply, have been suc-
cessfully utilized.
These floating dry-docks helped
greatly in the Pacific war. These docks
have helped to extend the effective op-
erating distances of the fleet from home
bases, and naval operations were ex-
tended and greatly speeded up. With re-
pair facilities nearby, our fleets were
able to maintain their highest degree of
fighting strength, and the length of the
war was materially shortened.

of '45, Hal added to his long list of
activities by becoming the A.S.M.E.
representative to the Engineering Coun-
cil.
After three semesters of active in-
dulgence in Union activities, Hal was
elected secretary of the Union Council.
The Engineering Council, not content
with other groups draining all of Wal-
ters' abilities, elected him secretary last
term and vice president for the present
term. Recognizing his potentialities, the
Vulcans initiated Harold into their
group in the spring of '46. It seems
that Hal's craving for activity could not
be satisfied, for early in this spring se-
mester, he served on the J-Hop Commit-
tee and further contributed his efforts to
making the Slide Rule Ball a success.
Harold, in his eighth term in me-
chanical engineering, will come back
next fall to complete his studies. After
that, he has no special plans, but if he
continues to put forth his efforts as he
has in the past, he will be a success,
regardless of what field of endeavor he
chooses.

Borden, Sheffield and many another of America's
famed milk producers have called on "Headquarters
for Mechanical Cooling" not only for dependable
equipment—but also for the specialized engineering
knowledge and intimate understanding of the dairy
industry which is uniquely York's.
For instance, a York contribution which has
materially helped the milk business reach its pres-
ent peak efficiency is High-Temperature Short-Time
Pasteurization. This process is the result of intensive
study, research, and experimentation extending over a
period of many years.
Throughout the nation this York equipment is pro-
cessing the huge total of 9,772,540 quarts of milk
per day!
Not only in the dairy industry but also in the field
of fast freezing and in the storage and wider distribu-
tion of refrigerated foods, York is supplying the engi-
neering and manufacturing skill necessary to make us
a healthier, better-fed nation.

THE HONOR SYSTEM OR
In the past few months much space
has been devoted herein to arousing
interest which we hoped would lead
to reinstating the Honor System.
During the war it has been half-
heartedly operating for upper-class-
men, and the two lower classes have
taken their bluebooks under the proc-
tor system, by faculty action.
Our efforts were rewarded when
the Engineering Council took steps
to inform the freshmen and sopho-
mores of the system's fine points. A
pamphlet was published and distrib-
uted in freshman assembly; steps
were taken to call a sophomore class
meeting. The meeting was called for
four in the afternoon, an off hour,
and the attendance was discouraging.
This was partly due to the fact that
few students were in school at the
time, and partly to conditions beyond
the control of the Engineering Coun-
cil.
During fall registration, the newly
published pamphlets describing the
Honor System will be passed out to
all students. Shortly thereafter, peti-
tions will be circulated for the sig-
natures of those students who would
like to have the Honor System acti-
vated for all classes. If enough stu-
dents sign these petitions, an elec-
tion should be held for the entire
school. This will leave the final
choice directly up to the students.
The Honor System was put into
effect only after the students had
petitioned the faculty in 1916; had
it proved ineffective it would have
been eliminated long before the par-
tial suspension during the war. It
is the faculty that judges whether
the system works or not; it is the
students who make it work. To bring
the system back to its prewar posi-
tion, it is the obligation of every en-
gineer to show that he wants it and
that he will abide by its rules. It is
not up to the faculty to urge the
system on the students. The initiative
lies with the Engineering Council,
the representative body of the stu-
dents.
If we find then, that a majority of
the students want the Honor System,
let's have it, and make it operate
properly. If the majority does not
want it, then let's abolish it complete-
ly and go back to the state that
finally resulted in its being adopted
back in 1916. We are approaching
that state now when the freshmen
and sophomores are not operating un-
der the system, and a large part of
the upper-classmen are operating un-
der it, but do not know what
It is time for a complete job
education for all classes. If t
done, and the majority still do
see the advantage of being ti
and of having trust in himst
every professional engineer
then the engineering body wil
all respect. Not only on the ca
where we are really envied by
schools, but by the public we
and the industry that gives u
employment.
When the Engineering Counci
started next fall, let's get behind
and give them our support. 1
cannot get the Honor System
stated now, then this is what

gyro gunsight
One of the most important secret
weapons of the Navy was its Gyro Gun-
sight. Without this remarkable gun-
sight every ship in the Pacific squadron
might have fallen prey to the Japanese
Kamikaze.
Development of the gunsight began
back in 1940 with the desire to apply
the gyroscope to a computing sight for
heavy guns on warships. The gyro's
ability to maintain its position in space
in spite of external forces suited this
purpose, and similar ones in our tanks,
especially well.
The first major test success for the
gunsight came when the "Battleship X"
destroyed virtually every Japanese
plane in an air attack on it. Eventually,
85,000 of these instruments helped to
cripple Jap air forces to such an extent
that only an occasional raid proved
successful. Because of them the Navy
dared to sail within range of Japanese
land based planes.
The gyro gunsight was the answer to
the Navy's need for a more maneu-
verable defense weapon. It permits
guns to be aimed accurately at a target
moving at high speed.
The gyroscope computes the "lead"
automatic due to its characteristics
known as "precession." Precession may
be described as follows: when a gyro-
scope is subject to a force which tends
to alter the direction of its axle in space,
the force meets with great resistance,
and the gyroscope wheel will turn about
an axis at right angles to the axis about
which the force was applied. Thus, if
the gyroscope is spinning in a vertical
plane, and a force is applied to its sup-
porting ring in an attempt to push it off
the vertical the roto will turn at right
angles to the force instead of tipping.
As it is known how a gyro will precess
when such a force is applied to it, ad-
vantage is taken of the movement to
control such operations as operating
valves and electrical circuit. The gun-
sight makes use of a "rate gyro." A
spring is attached to the gyroscope, and
the faster the latter is made to precess,
the greater the force in the spring. In
the gunsight the rate at which the gun-
ner moves his weapon in following the
target determines the force in the spring,
the force increasing with the movement.
Consequently, when the gunner is sight-
ing a target, the weapon is actually
pointing ahead, just far enough to al-
low for the target's movement.
There are two gyros to a gunsight.
They are delicate instruments and some

of the 879 patented Hoover engineering
developments have been sought and used
by other manufacturing industries—many
of them far removed from the home ap-
pliance field.
Today an engineering staff of 130, one
third of them graduate engineers, is re-
quired to meet calls made on Hoover engi-
neering skill.
The Hoover Cleaner is "born" in the development
engineering division, where teamworking skilled de-
signers, inventors and engineers plan tomorrow's elec-
tric cleaners.
The laboratory division conducts research, studies
and tests, rejects or recommends each component
part of each new product "to be."
Mechanical engineers measure noise and vibration,
design fan systems, study cleaning methods and solve
power transmission problems in developing new designs.
Electrical engineers develop and test motors, wiring,
switches, lamps, etc., designing the right power plant
and accessories for a Hoover.
Product engineers solve manufacturing problems, set
up standards, see that Hoover quality is maintained.

cleaner cut
The meticulous surgeon, who just
prior to operating must make sure his
hands are free of germs, got a sanitary
boost from science when a new elec-
tronic soap dispenser, which automati-
cally squirts liquid soap without being
touched, was developed.
Unlike the usual soap dispenser which
requires pressing a plunger to operate,
the electronic soap dispenser operates
whenever its light beam is broken. Since
a beam of light does not contaminate
ones hands, one more sanitation buga-
boo for the surgeon is removed.
When the surgeons hands break the
light beam a light-sensitive photoelectric
relay causes a current to flow which,
when amplified, electrically operates the
soap dispenser mechanism.
photoelectric colorimeter
A photoelectric colorimeter, whose
electronic "eyes" are able to describe
color far beyond the ability of the naked
eye, is now being used to standardize
with pinpoint accuracy the radiated col-
ors of fluorescent lights for office and
home use and of cathode ray tubes for
television receiver use.
Applied to fluorescent lighting, the
colorimeter insures that all lamps in one
color line will be within the limits of
one single shade. Because of the colori-
meter, all television receiver sets will be
set to receive the same shades of a color.
The colorimeter uses a system of color
filters linked to photoelectric cells to
beat the human eye in reading color.
Each of the filters show the amount of
their color that is emanating from the
color that is being tested. The photo
cells, which are able to transpose light
into current pulses, send out different
pulses for each of the colors in a ratio
to the strength of the colors. The pulses
register on an indicator dial, and the
readings can be checked against a color
graph or chart to determine if the light
being tested meets the standard set.
soft magnets
Magnets are commonly known as
hard, horseshoe shape pieces of metal.
Recently, however, two new types of
magnets, cunico and cunife, which are
soft enough to be machined rather than
ground have been developed. These
magnets, because of their ductility, can
be made in the shape of metal plates, in
the form of screws, punched into various
shapes and even drawn in the form of
wire.
A short length of either magnet will
do more work than a comparatively long
length of the oldtime magnet.
Cunico, comprised of copper, nickel
and cobalt, from which it gets its name,
has been used during wartime on
tachometers to measure the speed of
aircraft motors or small timing motors,
and in gyroscopes where magnetic
screws effect extremely fine magnetic
adjustments.
Cunife, which is named from its com-
ponents copper, nickel, and iron, has
been used as a meter magnet to indicate
whether flaps or wings of an airplane
are up or down, or whether landing gear
is up or down.
Both new magnets, because of their
versatility of size and shape, are ex-
pected to find applications where mag-
nets have never been able to be used
before.

noxious prankster to some, but to the
power lineman it is a surefire remedy
against the chief danger of his job,
electrocution, thanks to a new device
known as a glove testing set.
In designing the instrument a "hand"
or some sort of double for a human hand
was needed, and poured into the glove
proved to be the only such "hand" that
not only could conduct electrical cur-
rent but as well could fill completely
even the minutest of cracks or weak
spots in the glove.
The glove tester, or "liquid hand,"
consists mainly of a high voltage power
supply and a water tank large enough to
accommodate a lineman's "clothesline"
of a dozen gloves. The gloves are filled
with water, then immersed into the
water tank deeply enough so that only
the cuffs remain above the surface.
An electrical circuit is established
from power supply to water inside the
gloves by means of a conductor. A mil-
liammeter is readied to register any cur-
rent that might pass from water inside
the gloves to water outside the gloves in
the tank.
The safeness of the gloves can thus
be measured quickly and easily.
electronic dewpoint recorder
A new electronic instrument known as
dewpoint recorder, which can determine
automatically and continuously the
amount of moisture in a gas has re-
cently been developed. This instrument
may be of great aid in preserving meats
and vegetables on the dinner table. The
device would also serve to afford a flier
greater assurance that his oxygen sys-
tem will not fail at high altitudes. The
machine can be used in practically any
field wherein control of moisture is es-
sential.
The dewpoint recorder is an electronic
combination of heater, refrigerator, mir-
ror, and gas chamber. As the gas cham-
ber feeds a test gas out over a stainless
steel mirror, the refrigerator and heater
cool or heat the mirror until a tempera-
ture is attained at which moisture in
the gas precipitates into dew on the-
mirror.
Keeping its own "eye" on the mirror,
the device spots the dew the instant it
forms, then simultaneously records this
dewpoint temperature on a graph.
Working in coordination, the refrigera-
tor and heater hold this dewpoint
temperature within a tolerance of two
degrees, so that a continuous reading on
the chart is available. The dewpoint
temperature recorded then is converted
into amount of moisture present in the
gas tested.
airline transports
United Air Lines recently purchased
35 twin airplanes having pressurized
cabins for low altitude comfort at high
altitudes. The ships will form the first
fleet of 300 mile an hour twin engine
planes with pressurized cabins. Other
improvements to be supplied by the air-
line will be jet thrust augmentation for
extra speed, heat de-icing for the wings
and tail, and electronic automatic pilots
for use in automatic instrument landings
as well as in regular airway operations.
The 35 ships will cost about $9,-
000,000.00 with about $1,000,000.00
added for pressurizing the cabins. The
planes will be used to provide increas-
ingly frequent inter-city services.
Through a supercharging process,
pressure of the cabin will be increased
so that, for example, there will be the
equivalent of sea level pressure within
the cabin while the plane is flying at
8,000 feet.
The planes will cruise at five miles a
minute while carrying 40 passengers.

No. 6. An Engineer Needs Enthusiasm
AN ENGINEER gets more enjoyment from
his work and does a better job when he can
be enthusiastic over his company's achievements
and the part he plays in these achievements.
Enthusiasm, we have observed, can make the
difference between a good beginning and a poor
one in the critical first years of an engineer's
career.
We like to point this out to young engineers
who are thinking of joining The Timken Roller
Bearing Company, because its record of achieve-
ment, past and present, is a continual source of
inspiration to our engineering staff.
■ As the leading manu-
facturer of anti-friction bearings for many
years, our company is one of the best known
in America. Because it has produced bearings for
every application needed by industry, its reputa-
tion for quality and advanced engineering stands
unquestioned everywhere.
The Timken Roller Bearing Company has spent
millions in research and development. From the
genius of its engineers have come a continual
stream of important contributions to many fields
of engineering.
■ In such an atmosphere,
the enthusiasm of young graduate engineers in-
variably runs high.
To help them get the best possible start, we
operate a "Work-as-You-Learn" Plan of training.
The men selected are rotated from department
to department, performing productive work all
the while. When we are satisfied that they have
gained a good basic understanding of our business,
they are assigned to a regular line of work.
We are interested now in talking with men
who will soon get a degree in Engineering. If
you would like to know more about our company
and its training plan, write The Timken Roller
Bearing Company, Canton 6, Ohio.

COURTESY AUTOMOTIVE GOLDEN JUBILEE CIVIC COMMITTEE
Ten pioneers of the motor era have
been selected for the Automotive Hall
of Fame by the Automobile Manufac-
turers Association and the National
Automotive Golden Jubilee Committee.
The ten men, who were honored dur-
ing the Automotive Golden Jubilee,
celebrated from May 29 to June 9, are:
Edgar Apperson, of Phoenix, Arizona,
pioneer automobile builder and de-
signer, who was responsible for many
early mechanical advances;
William Crapo Durant, New York
City, automotive empire-builder, whose
faith in the industry's future has been
boundless;
J. Frank Duryea, of Madison, Con-
necticut, surviving member of Duryea
Brothers, makers of early gasoline
motor wagons;
Henry Ford, Dearborn, father of the
assembly line, who drove his first car,
a "quadricycle," in Detroit, June 4,
1896;
George Holley, Detroit carburetor
manufacturer who has been selected by
auto parts manufacturers as the out-
standing pioneer of their branch of the
industry;
Charles B. King, Larchmont, New
York, who built and drove the first car
in Detroit on March 6, 1896;
Charles W. Nash, of Beverly Hills,
California, who headed some of the in-
dustry's largest companies in a long
and colorful career;
Barney Oldfield, Los Angeles, cigar-
chewing champion of the Roaring Road,
whose name for years was synonomous
with speed;
Ransom E. Olds, Lansing, Michigan,
who pioneered the volume production
of automobiles;
Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., New York City,
pioneer manufacturer of motor parts.
All of these pioneers were honored at
an industry and civic dinner and dram-
atized tribute on May 31 at Detroit's
Masonic Temple, and received distinc-
tive awards for their contributions to
automotive progress.
Months of research preceded selec-
tion of the pioneers. Many more pio-
neers will be selected from year to year
by the industry in recognition of their
significant contributions. These pio-
neers of motor transport have re-made
the face of America in half a century.
By putting the nation and the world
on wheels, they have ended rural iso-
lation, changed the pattern of city life,
and revolutionized the whole world's
working and living.
The Automotive Golden Jubilee, cele-
brating the birth SO years ago of what
is now America's biggest industry, was
observed in communities throughout the
country. The key celebrations were
held in Detroit which, as the automo-
tive capital, staged a series of spectacu-
lar events, including pageants, a salute
to the industry's pioneers, parades, fes-
tivals, and an antique automobile expo-
sition.
Biographical sketches of the ten pio-
neers follow:
Edgar Apperson
The man responsible for many of the
automobile industry's advances in me-
chanical design was part owner of a
machine shop in Kokomo, Indiana,
when Elwood Haynes brought in draw-
ings of his proposed horseless carriage
and sought mechanical aid. After Mr.
Haynes had driven the car in Chicago
in 189S, Mr. Apperson and his brother.
Elmer, now deceased, joined in the or-
ganization of the Haynes-Apperson Au-
tomobile Company. Mr. Apperson
drove in many races and long overland
road tests. As engineer and production
manager, he contributed to the industry
such advances in design as the three-
quarter floating axle and the system of
hanging the brake on supports, leaving
the band at the rear free movement.
He recalls that two of his important
assignments in the early days were to
run cars over a demonstration route for
customers who came to the factory for
delivery, and to collect the purchase
price in full before the car was driven
out of the yard.
William Crapo Durant
This industrial empire builder had
such faith in the motor industry's fu-
ture that he risked a successful wagon-
building business to invade the new

DONALD SKILLITER "48 M.E.
Natural gas is so common in the
United States today that few people
actually realize the size and extent of
industry connected with its production.
Today, thousands of industrial appli-
cations of gas have made it one of the
three leading fuels in a country which
has the largest fuel consumption per
capita in the world. Its cheapness,
cleanness, and ease of handling have not
only accounted for its use as a fuel, but
also make it a highly desirable raw
material for producing synthetic chemi-
cals. Research has shown that using
gas as a base, thousands of chemicals
may be produced. Although its use in
the chemical industry is still rather
limited, it takes little imagination to see
many more industrial and chemical ap-
plications which would greatly increase
the present gas production.
A total of nearly four trillion cubic
feet of natural gas were consumed last
year in the United States. Under ordi-
nary atmospheric conditions this volume
is equivalent to a single cube of gas
measuring three miles on a side and
weighing about 100,000,000 tons which
is approximately the weight of the an-
nual production of the steel industry.
It has a heating value equal to that of
150,000,000 tons of coal.
Of this total, over two trillion cubic
feet were marketed for domestic and in-
dustrial uses. Over 90 million Ameri-
cans depend on gas for cooking, refrig-
eration and heating their homes. The
wide industrial uses of gas range from
heating open hearth furnaces to baking
bread. More than 20,000 different ap-
plications have been made of this versa-
tile fuel in various manufacturing and
commercial processes.
Startling as it seems, over four-fifths
of the total volume of gas marketed is
natural gas; less than a half trillion
cubic feet of manufactured gas is now
used. Most of this artificial gas is piped
into domestic pipe lines. The important
difference between these two fuels is
their relative heating value. Natural
gas, which consists of 85 percent or
more of highly inflammable methane
gas, has a heating value of over 1,000
Btu per cubic foot. Manufactured gas,
made by passing steam over hot coke to
produce methane and carbon monoxide,
has a heating value of only about 540
Btu.
A large amount of the remaining
volume of gas is used immediately in
the various oil and gas fields. Here it
is used as fuel under boilers, in gas en-
gines for drilling wells, and pumping and
lifting oil, and in operating gas compres-
sors and natural gasoline plants. The
exact volume* for these uses, however, is
not available.
Hundreds of billions of cubic feet of
natural gas are also used in the manu-
facturing of several hundred thousand
tons of carbon black each year. Here
again, the exact volume consumed in
this industry is not available. However,
carbon black is still the most important
chemical product derived from natural
gas. Nine per cent of all this "soot"
goes into the manufacture of natural
and synthetic rubber. A maximum of
five pounds of carbon black is needed
to make a standard 6.00 x 16 four-ply
tire of natural rubber.
The production of carbon black is
not economical however, either for the
money yield or from the material yield.
Although the carbon content of methane
gas is about 75 per cent, the "channel
process" of producing carbon black re-
covers only about 5 per cent of the car-
bon. The newly developed "furnace-
type" process yields about 25 per cent
more carbon than the "channel proc-
ess." This product is only usable in
the making of synthetic rubber, and the
extent of its application depends on the
future use of synthetic rubber over
natural rubber. Because of cost of
transporting natural gas as compared to
shipping the manufactured carbon black,
it has been found more economical to
pipe the gas to the point where the car-
bon is to be used and process it there.
Some of the natural gas contains
traces (as high as 2 per cent) of helium,
which can easilv be extracted. The

taken can then be fed into pipe lines
with no impairment to its fuel quality.
Helium, which is only one-seventh the
weight of air still finds its greatest ap-
plication in inflating lighter-than-air
craft and airplane tires. It is also used
to create a synthetic "atmosphere" (to
take the place of nitrogen) for deep-sea
divers, whose work in compressed air
exposes them to the bends. It is indis-
pensable as a protective blanket to keep
oxygen away when arc-welding mag-
nesium.
Natural gas as a raw material has
made possible a considerable synthetic
chemical industry. ''If we start with
natural gas," says Dr. Gustav Egloff
of Universal Oil Products, "all the
known synthetic products that man has
developed in organic industry can be
derived—and there are over 500,000 of
them!"
Until the early 1920's, the idea that
natural gas was unreactive and com-
pletely inert was accepted by everyone.
Then an "accident" in a lab of an oil
company, where a chemist was studying
the problem of corrosion in gas lines,
completely changed the whole picture.
In reproducing conditions and to hasten
any reaction, they put gas and air in a
steel chamber under pressure. Several
hours later, they observed droplets of
wood alcohol, formaldehyde, and formic
acid in the tank, which they reasoned
to be formed due to the reaction of the
gas with oxygen.
This accident blew the lid off the
natural gas industry. A raw material
had been provided which is cheaper and
easier to handle than any other product
previously known. Rough calculations
show that 1,000 cubic feet of natural
gas, at a cost of 5 cents at the well,
can be converted into eight gallons of
ethyl alcohol, four gallons of methyl al-
cohol, one gallon of acetic acid, and nu-
merous other products. Weight-for-
weight of products, natural gas costs
about one-fifth as much as crude oil.
Natural gas is composed chiefly of
methane (about 85 per cent), ethane,
propane, and butane.
Besides these constituents there are
smaller quantities of pentane, hexane,
heptane, and helium. The various in-
dustries, in most cases, extract the com-
ponent wanted, and pipe the remainder
into fuel lines.
There are four general methods now
in use for ripping apart or retailoring
natural gas molecules. The first of these,
oxidation, is similar to the process in
which the "accident" occurred. Oxygen
is added to the constituents of natural
gas under heat and pressure, and some-
times in the presence of a catalyst.
Formaldehyde and acetic acid are pro-
duced in this way. In the decomposition
process, natural gas molecules are split
apart leaving free hydrogen and car-
bon. Hydrogen may be combined with
nitrogen to produce ammonia and its
numerous by-products while carbon is
generally used in the rubber tire and
printing industries.
The halogenation method calls for
combination of natural gas with the
halogens—chlorine, fluorine, bromine,
and iodine—resulting in the formation
of a new group of chemicals. Well
known in this group are chloroform and
the solvent, carbon tetrachloride. The
last method, nitration, is the addition
of nitrogen to natural gas to produce
powerful new explosives. This also
served as a cheap and prolific method of
making toluene into TNT during the
war. A number of widely used plastics,
such as Lucite, and nitro-celluloses such
as rayon, may be produced in this way.
Perhaps the most pertinent chemical
use of natural gas is in the manufacture
of synthetic gasoline. So promising does
this new industry look, that a new $19,-
000,000 gas-from-gas plant is to be built
near Carthage, Texas. The man behind
600 I

the project is P. C. Keith, who bossed
the construction of the atom-bomb
plant at Oak Ridge. Mr. Keith became
familiar with the manufacture of syn-
thetic gasoline when he visited Germany
in the thirties. With the Fisher-Tropsch
process, the Germans were able to pro-
duce a 40-octane gasoline at a cost of
about 18 cents a gallon from the me-
thane in artificial gas.
In brief, the process for producing
gasoline involves breaking down the
methane content (90 per cent) of nat-
ural gas with oxygen, steam, or carbon
dioxide to form hydrogen and carbon
monoxide. These building blocks can
then be reacted to produce liquid hydro-
carbons, viz., gasoline. The main prob-
lems which confronted the experimenters
in this field were the great quantities of
heat, which resulted from the combina-
tion of oxygen and methane, and the
high price of pure oxygen ($3 per 1,000
cubic feet). It was the solution of these
problems that made it possible to pro-
duce synthetic gasoline economically.
They honey-combed the reaction cham-
ber with water pipes to produce a cool-
ing effect. The steam generated in the
cooling pipes was then used to operate
condensers which were able to produce
oxygen at less than 5 cents per 1,000
cubic feet.
Mr. Keith ironed out the kinks in his
process by setting up a pilot plant
in Olean, N.Y. near the Pennsyl-
vania oil fields. From the calcu-
lations made from the small out-
put of this plant, it is believed
that the proposed Texas plant will
be able to produce about 5,000
gallons of gasoline at a cost of 4
cents a gallon. These costs will

greatly increased both in
industry and in the
home. (Figures in bil-
lions of cubic feet.)

LOR
yangtze dam
With the help of expert engineers of
the United States Bureau of Reclama-
tion, the Chinese government is grad-
ually developing the plans for the
largest dam in the world. To be located
at the foot of a series of menacing
gorges known collectively as the Yangtze
Gorge, this hydroelectric mammoth is
intended to alleviate the living condi-
tions of the millions of people who in-
habit the Yangtze basin and indirectly,
of all China. Ichang is the nearest city
and Chungking is about 300 miles to the
west; in all probability the dam, with
its attendant phenomenal source of
power, will transform these two cities
into metropolises in the true Occidental
sense.
Statistics on the dimensions and pow-
er to be generated of this dam stir the
imagination. The height will be 750
feet, topping Boulder dam by 24 feet.
In volume of cement, it will exceed
Grand Coulee's 10 million cubic feet by
5 million cubic feet. The total reservoir
is estimated to be 250 miles long, hold-
ing 50 million acre feet of water which
will be released through a series of ir-
rigation systems to the surrounding
farm lands. As for the power plant it-
self, 96 Coulee type, 108,000 K.W.
generators will harness the energy of the
falling water, providing more power
than Boulder. Grand Coulee and Shasta
Dams combined.
Aside from the useful power gen-
erated, the Yangtze project will serve
other purposes. For generations the
Yangtze valley has been scourged by
floods resulting from heavy snows and
rains in the upper basin. Millions of
dollars of agricultural products as well
as many thousand lives have been lost.
The flood control afforded by the proj-
ect will remove this ever impending
danger to the small farmers of the dis-
trict. (Within a radius of 300 miles of
the dam there are more people than in
the entire United States.) Furthermore,
by regulating the How ot the river,
navigation in its lower reaches will be
immeasurably improved, permitting
ocean going steamers to penetrate
farther inland than has been heretofore
possible. Lastly, and perhaps most im-
portant from an economical point of
view, it will permit the populace of the
valley to spend less time farming, and
more time in industrial work. Power for
the industries as well as the electrical
appliances manufactured and distrib-
uted in the area will be supplied by the
dam, thus eventually helping to raise
the standard of living.
The technical planning for the darn
presents many difficulties. One of these.
the problem of lifting river craft over it
has been solved in two alternate ways.
The first and least revolutionary is the
building of huge locks to accommodate
the boats and raise them the required
550 feet. The second is a rather novel
innovation providing for the use of huge
gantry cranes straddling a canal, the

"Let's make this last Reflects of
yours on the campus high-lights, Mc-
Higan," suggested Mr. David. So, with-
out further ado, I grabbed my sliderule
and my hat and journeyed over to Bur-
ton Tower and proceeded upwards to
I
the eighth floor. As I walked out on
the belfry, I saw another student stand-
ing there looking out the rain-swept
terrain. He looked like he was higher
than a kite—and come to think about
it, he was. I told him that I was look-
ing for the campus highlights and would
like him to point them out to me. He
looked at me kind of strangely and
then replied, "I don't think you will
find them here; the top floor of Univer-
sity Hospital has lights that are higher
than these." After a lengthy argument,
we decided to change the topic of dis-
cussion. I thought of an excellent ob-
ject to discuss—the weather. We came
to the conclusion that this wet season
we were having was longer than the
"reign" of Henry V.
One person's opinion on what were the
high-lights of this college term will not
agree with everyone else's, of course, but

PRESENTS
Bob was born in Lakeside, Michigan
in 1922. After mastering all that Three
Oaks High School could offer, he came
to Michigan with his brother in the fall
of 1940. He arrived here just in time
to see 'Harmon and company run wild'
math prof
You may have noticed him on cam-
pus, sporting a natty tweed suit matched
with a crimson tie, or you may have
heard a group of engineers talking about
him. but you'll always remember him
if you've had the good luck to be in
any of -his classes. For Professor Louis
J. Rouse, of the Department of Mathe-
matics, has the distinction of being not
only one of the most competent but also
one of the best liked teachers at Michi-
gan. Since coming to Michigan in 1913,
Prof. Rouse has devoted most of his
time to presenting his courses in the
most complete possible manner, and
his patience with students is easily de-
termined by the satisfactory comments
made by the students.

Louis J. Rouse
A genuine "Down-Easterner," Prof.
Rouse's ancestral home is in New Jer-
sey. This accounts for the fact that he
completed his undergraduate work at
Princeton University, receiving his A.B.
degree in 1908. Following this, he at-
tended the University of Pennsylvania,
from which school he was granted an
A.M. degree in 1913. It was then that
he took Mr. Greeley's advice and mi-
grated westward to Ann Arbor, and
began teaching part time at the Univer-
sity. In 1918 he received his Ph.D. in
Mathematics from the University of
Michigan, and since then he has been
a full time member on the staff of the
Mathematics Department.
His hobbies have managed to fill his
spare moments. When he still lived in
the eastern part of the U. S., he did a
lot of hiking and mountain climbing in
the New Hampshire Adirondacks, and
he has spent many enjoyable vacations
in pursuing this sport. He is a proficient
swimmer, as evidenced by the fact that
he often swims 60 pool lengths in the
Michigan Union pool. (He claims that
his exercise does not make him lose
weight, but merely "redistributes" it.)
Now that spring has arrived, however,
his main source of exercise is his garden,
a half-acre plot which he plants and cul-
tivates, and he takes a great deal of
pride in harvesting its products. Other
very important interests in his life are
his wife and his three daughters—which
daughters, incidentally, have chosen to
attend schools near Boston rather than
to adorn our Michigan campus.
Students who have been in Prof.
Rouse's courses and who have kept up
with the daily assignments invariably
come away with a feeling of accomplish-
ment, of having profitably spent their
time on courses very necessary to an
engineer's knowledge. Professor Rouse
is noted for his very fair bluebooks, even
though his daily assignments are some-
times a bit heavy, and he has always
been willing to spend his time out of
the classroom in helping students who
may be having a rough time in Math.
He is remembered for his fine personal
characteristics and for his valuable con-
tributions to the mathematical knowl-
edge of a great many engineers.
ex-ediror-in-ch ief
It was in November of 1944 that Bob
Royce first came out for work on the
TECHNIC, and now at the end of this
term he is leaving the campus after
being Editor of the MICHIGAN
TECHNIC since last Fall. Thus he
rose from a staff member to the highest
position in just one year.

Robert F. Royce
on the gridiron. He entered the Engi-
neering College with the expectation of
staying here for one year and then
transferring. After he became settled
here, Bob decided that he could get
what he was interested in, without
transferring, so he stayed. After drop-
ping out in the fall of 1941, he came
back for the spring term and in the
summer of 1942 he enrolled in the
Ordnance Material Inspection Course
from which he was graduated with a
rating of excellent. However, when the
fall term started, Bob was here, and
stayed till he received his B.S. in Me-
chanical Engineering in June, 1945.
Not being satisfied with this, he then
transferred to the Civil department and
after two semesters work he received his
B.S. in Civil Engineering in February,
1946. Since then he has been taking
additional courses in Sanitary Engineer-
ing in the Graduate School.
Between semesters last fall, Bob
found time to attend his own wedding,
taking as his bride a girl he had known
since his senior high school days. Dur-
ing the last semester, Bob has been
working half-time for the City Planning
Commission of Ann Arbor.
Bob started on the TECHNIC staff
in November, 1944 at the bottom of the
publications staff. After two semesters
of hard work he was advanced to As-
sociate Editor last summer, and in the
fall of 1945, took over as Editor-in-
Chief. Bob has served on the Slide

of Crystals
Most synthetic crystals contain water.
Under sustained operation, heat drives
off the water, destroys the crystal. To
lick this trouble—which put vital
Navy electronic apparatus out of
action, new equipment using a water-
free synthetic crystal was developed
by Bell Telephone Laboratories.
It was the job of engineers at
Western Electric to set up equipment
for growing synthetic crystals on a
mass production basis.
For "seeds" they use tiny pieces of
crystal, "planted' in metal pans.
Temperature is raised to 110° F, am-
monia salt solution is added, the pans
are rocked gently by mechanical
means. Lowering the temperature
starts crystallization. After several
days, the salt solution is drained.
Then the process is repeated for from
45 to 60 days.
Result: synthetic crystal bars six
inches to a foot in length from which
the electronic crystals—better than
nature's own—are cut.

One-Way Streets
To one group of Western Electric en-
gineers, every day is baking day. The
objects of their culinary skill are cop-
per washers and discs—from l-16th
to l}/2 inches in diameter—done to a
turn in a red hot oven, and with a
crust of copper oxide on one side.
Piled in matched sets, these copper
oxide discs are called varistors (vari-
able resistors). They are high resis-
tance in one direction, low resistance
in the other, and so, in effect, allow
electrical current only a one-way
passage.
&gt;onewaQ&gt;

As radio moved into very high fre-
quencies, specifications for precision,
stability and smaller size of these rec-
tifiers went far beyond anything pre-
viously attempted outside the labora-
tory.
Western Electric's manufacturing
engineers set up shop for quantity
production of these interesting little
devices. The techniques they have
developed have great significance for
post-war communications.

Smaller than
a Pinhead
Thermistor—thermal resistor—is the
name of a class of solid variable re-
sistors used as circuit control ele-
ments. These tiny units must be
sturdy and dependable, yet extremely
sensitive in response to temperature
variations.
Most thermistors begin life as a
metallic oxide paste. This is proc-
essed; "fired" under carefully con-
trolled atmosphere and temperature
conditions; then formed into beads
on fine wires, pressed into discs or
extruded as rods.
One interesting manufacturing
problem arises from their size, which
may be smaller than a pinhead. To
manufacture these tiny devices, some
of the operations must be performed
under microscopes.
Developing and setting up tech-
niques for quantity production of
these precise units is another accom-
plishment of Western Electric en-
gineers.
Manufacturing telephone and radio apparatus far the Bell System is Western Electric's primary job. It calls
for engineers of many kinds—radio, electrical, mechanical, chemical, metallurgical. Many of the things they do
—whether seemingly little or big—contribute greatly to the art of manufacture of communications equipment.

in 1861 and was brought to Flint,
Mich., as a boy. The wagon-building
business which he and a friend, J. Dal-
las Dort, bought for $2,000 grew into
the largest of its kind in America, pro-
ducing 150,000 vehicles a year in 14
plants. .In 1903, Durant took over the
Flint wagon works and began automo-
bile manufacture. The result was one
of the most famous of the early cars,
the Dort. Durant, who was a million-
aire before he was 40, founded some
of the most famous names in the auto-
mobile world while making and losing
successive fortunes. Among the cor-
porations he founded were General
Motors, Chevrolet and Durant Motors.
Ransom E. Olds
The father of mass-production of au-
tomobiles was born in Geneva, Ohio, on
June 3, 1864, and received his schooling
in Cleveland. Before he built gasoline-
propelled cars, he had made a steam-
driven model which he sold to an Indian
potentate. The ship on which it was
sent to the Orient sank and the car was
lost. Olds often has said that his repu-
tation was saved as a result. He began
his business career by organizing the
Olds Motor Works at Lansing, Mich.,
in 1897. The first year the plant built
only six cars, but in 1899 Olds moved
to Detroit and became the first manu-
facturer to produce automobiles in
volume. In 1903 his then phenomenal
output of 4,000 cars was 35% of the
industry's total production. Later that
year he left the Olds Company and
founded another, giving his initials,
REO, to its product.
Barney Oldfield
The daredevil speed demons of the
early days of the automobile did much
to bring the young industry into promi-
nence, and the most colorful racer of
all was Barney Oldfield, who was born
on a farm near Wauseon, Ohio, June 3,
1878. He sold newspapers to purchase
his first bicycle, and became widely
known as a bike racer in the 90's. In
1902, Henry Ford and his associate,
Tom Cooper, built a special race car
called the "999," and then could find
no one to drive it. Cooper recomended
his friend, Oldfield, but Oldfield had
never driven an automobile. Mr. Ford
taught him how, through a week of

thrills, and Oldfield went on to set
record after record until his name be-
came a synonym for speed. He figured
in a dozen serious crashes, but as late
as 1932 he was planning to break the
then record of 253.96 miles an hour.
After his retirement from the speed-
ways, Oldfield became a tire manufac-
turer and an automobile designer. He
now works for General Petroleum Corp.,
a subsidiary of Socony-Vacuum.
Alfred P. Sloan, Jr.
A pioneer parts maker, Mr. Sloan
was born at New Haven, Conn., May
23, 1875. He had an early interest in
engineering, and was graduated from
Massachusetts Institute of Technology
at the age of 20, completing the four-
year course in three years. Mr. Sloan,
his father, and another associate ac-
quired the small Hyatt Roller Bearing
Company at the time that automobiles
were becoming more than experiments.
Alfred Jr. became president in 1897 and
expanded the business to more than
$10,000,000 a year. He was one of the
first in the industry to realize the ad-
vantages in consolidation of far flung
operations and in 1916, Hyatt and a
number of other accessory companies
were consolidated into United Motors
with Mr. Sloan as president. United
became a part of General Motors in
1918, and Mr. Sloan was made presi-
dent of the enlarged corporation in
1923. He held this office until 1937,
when he became chairman. His inter-
ests are widespread and reveal a broad
constructive grasp of industry and pub-
lic problems. He has been chairman of
the National Highway Users Confer-
ence from its founding in 1933 to date.
J. Frank Duryea
J. Frank Duryea and his brother,
Charles, built the first gasoline-powered
automobile in this country, and drove
it to Springfield, Mass., in February,
1893. Their first car is now enshrined
in the Smithsonian Institute in Wash-
ington, D. C. J. Frank Duryea drove
his second model to victory in Amer-
ica's first automobile race on November
28, 1895, in Chicago. Mr. Duryea was
born in Washburn, 111., and showed an
early bent for mechanics. He was work-
ing in Chicopee Falls, Mass., when he
and his brother conceived the idea of
building a horseless carriage. Frank
Duryea continued in the automobile
business until 1915, when he retired as
vice-president of Stevens-Duryea to de-
vote himself to other interests.
Henry Ford
The man who has become the auto-
mobile industry's best known person-
ality was born on a farm near Detroit
on July 30, 1863. At 16, he left the
farm for Detroit, where he worked at a
variety of jobs ranging from watch re-
pairing to machinist. He was chief en-
gineer of the Detroit Edison Company,
earning $125 a month, when he built
his first car in a shed behind what is
now the Michigan Theatre in Detroit,
and startled his neighbors by driving
the horseless carriage through Bagley
Avenue in June of 1896. After several
unsuccessful attempts to form a com-
pany to manufacture his car, Mr. Ford
successfully founded the present Ford
Motor Company in 1903. Mr. Ford
is world renowned for his many con-
tributions that have altered industrial
activity throughout the world. He fa-
thered the assembly line; successfully
applied on a modern scale progressive
volume production principle; pioneered
in establishment of rural industry; and
took a leading part in the development
of chemurgy. His broad civic, social,
and national activities are too numerous
to enumerate.
George M. Holley
A representative pioneer automotive
parts manufacturer best known as the
builder of more than 20,000,000 carbu-
retors in the past 41 years, Mr. Holley
has been identified with the motor in-
dustry since 1899, when he produced a
three-wheel Holley automobile. He was
born at Port Jervis, N. Y., in 1878 and
graduated from Stevens School in Ho-
boken, N. J. After his venture with a
three-wheel car at Bradford, Pa., Mr.
Holley started manufacturing standard
automobiles and motors in 1901. He
supplied Willys-Overland with its first
motors, and at the same time produced
motorcycles at the rate of 175 per year.
Mr. Holley established world motor-
cycle records at the Pan-American Ex-
position in Buffalo and, together with
George Hendy, won a gold medal for
completing the first motorcycle contest
between Boston and New York. He

products of the process—1,000 gallons
of diesel oil and 20,000 pounds of crude
alcohol and acetone a day.
Another interesting use of natural
gas is in producing a "tailored" atmos-
phere for heat treating. It is rather
commonly known that because of the
oxygen in the air, a scale of oxide is
formed on metal during heat treatment.
By introducing an atmosphere of nat-
ural gas into the heat treating furnace,
a "neutral" situation is created in which
there is no oxygen. Thus razor blades,
bed springs, and other products may be
heat treated and tempered and still re-
main shiny through the process.
Because of the cheapness and ease of
handling, natural gas has been called—
"the most desirable chemical raw mate-
rial the world has yet seen." However,
most industries engaged in extracting
synthetic products from gas are still in
an infant stage, and have yet to fit them-
selves in a competitive market of their
own. It is interesting to note that the
widest use of gas to make chemicals
which is economically conceivable would
not for some time conserve more than
50 billion cubic feet of natural gas a
year which is only about 1.3 per cent
of the total marketed production. All
of these minor uses, however, are great-
ly overshadowed by its use as a fuel—
the cleanest and most efficient of all
fuels in general use—for domestic and
commercial heating.
The development of the natural gas
industry to its present status of supply-
ing fuel to a total population of 41,000,-
NATURAL GAS
(Continued from page 13)
000, living in 33 of the 48 states, is in-
teresting to follow. It has been used
locally for more than 50 years. Early
explorers in the Appalachian region 300
years ago were familiar with perpetual
flames burning on the ground with no
apparent fuel to feed them. The town
of Fredonia in New York State made
use of this miraculous gas which flowed
from nearby crevices in the slate rocks,
to light their homes.
In spite of several similar applica-
tions, natural gas was quite frightening
to most people because it was apt to
fill the air without warning and serious
explosions sometimes resulted. With the
rapid development of the oil industry
around Titusville, Pa., after 1859, great
quantities of it were produced. It was
this gas, sealed under thousands of
pounds of pressure in oil-filled beds of
sand which helped the "black gold" to
flow to the surface when a well was
tapped. But oilmen were only interested
in producing kerosene and greatly feared
the fires and explosions caused by the
gas. Therefore, the gas was led off and
"flared" as a safety measure.
Later, however, the heating value of
natural gas was recognized and it was
introduced as a fuel under the boilers
of wells which were being pumped and
drilled. Its use spread to near-by dwell-
ings, and finally in 1883, it was piped
to Pittsburgh where the volumes con-
sumed annually by foundries, rolling
mills, and large manufacturing plants
soon exceeded that of a million domestic
consumers. The metered use of gas.
however, was not introduced until about
1896. This had the effect of cutting the
consumption in half; thereby the waste
by consumers was reduced and the pro-
ducer benefited alike. The marketed
production rose from a volume of only
$13,000,000 in 1896 to about $160,000.-
000 in 1919. Because of the rapid ex-
pansion of pipelines, this value was
brought up to $821,000,000 in 1944.
The expansion of pipelines from
Pennsylvania and West Virginia began
its development in the late 1800's. Soon
this wonderful fuel was flowing to all
the major cities in the East and even as
far west as Chicago. But the real vol-
ume of gas was in the huge mid-conti-
nent oil fields of Texas and Oklahoma,
and since there was no near-by indus-
trial areas, the oilmen continued to
"flare" the gas. It was not until the
demand for gas in the Mid-west became
sufficient that it was found profitable
to construct pipelines from the fields.
In 1919, a greater potential capacity
was added to the gas market with the
discovery of the Monroe field in Louisi-
ana. About this same time, huge reser-
voirs of natural gas were found in Texas
and Kansas, which became known as
the Panhandle field and the Hugoton
field. With this assured supply and an
increasing demand for gas, huge high
pressure pipelines were soon pointing
northward to the industrial regions of
St. Louis, Chicago, and Detroit. The
growth of our present network of gas
pipelines has risen to a total mileage
of 218,440 miles in 1944, which is
enough to girdle the globe nearly nine

What they did they aren't telling
The above picture shows a notable
moment in the history of petroleum
research. A. L. Conn, representing a
special Research Department group
of Standard Oil Company, has just
received a framed certificate from
Dr. Robert E. Wilson, Chairman of
the Board of the company.
The certificate reads:
An Award for
Chemical Engineering Achievement
to
Standard Oil Company (Indiana)
In recognition of its unique
and meritorious contribution
to the
Atomic Bomb Project
A great military and industrial ac-
complishment made possible by a
patriotic pooling of the scientific
knowledge and engineering experi-
ence of American industries and uni-
versities in the research and develop-
ment, design, construction and
operation of manufacturing facilities
under the direction of the
Manhattan Engineer District
Corps of Engineers, U. S. Army
Presented by
Chemical and Metallurgical
Engineering
February 26, 1946
Dr. Wilson had previously received
the certificate in a ceremony in New
York at which Chemical and Metal-
lurgical Engineering's seventh bien-
nial award for chemical engineering
achievement was divided among
many companies which had a part
in the atomic energy work.
Much was said at the Whiting
presentation about atomic energy in
general, but not one word about
what the Standard of Indiana re-
search workers did. That is still a
secret.
Whatever it was the Whiting re-
searchers did about the atomic bomb,
it was only a small part of what all
American industry did. The signifi-
cance of the picture is not so much,
therefore, in the fact that the Whit-
ing group did something to make the
atomic bomb possible, but rather in
the fact that this aid was available
when the nation needed it.
When the armed forces suddenly
needed scientific work of an unusu-
ally high order, the labora-
tories of American indus-
try, developed in a com-
petitive economy under a
system of free enterprise,
stood ready to do the job.

Technical skills built up through

comparable job was done in the gov-

Dynamic Research
Here in the midwestern part of the
United States is a research institu-
tion capable of attacking a great
variety of problems in petroleum
chemistry. Its personnel totals 200
scientists and about twice that many
technicians and assistants. And their
number is growing. When the great
new laboratories now under con-
struction in Hammond, Indiana, are
completed they will house 420 chem-
ists and engineers and 800 techni-
cians and helpers.
On the threshold of whajt scien-
tists themselves regard as a new age,
the goals of petroleum research axe
now set beyond the achievements of
the war years. Where experimenta-
tion may lead, no one fully knows,
for it is the nature of research to
pioneer into the unknown.
These research workers
will follow their great op-
portunity wherever the
stream of development
may lead.
JUNE, 1946


(Continued
times. This rapid growth has been made
possible by Dresser-type couplings, by
acetylene, electric and pressure welding,
by high pressure boosting stations and
by steel pipe of reduced diameter, cap-
able of withstanding the high pressures
—400 pounds per square inch and more
-—at which gas moves across the coun-
try. The relative suddenness of this de-
velopment has made gas one of the
three leading fuels of the country.
Despite the rapid shift to the use of
gas, the wastage of the product is still
rather alarming—1,000 million cubic
feet per day. Much of this is lost
("flared'' off) in the form of casing head
gas which is a by-product of the oil
wells. At the present time, numerous
investigations are being conducted to
find ways to utilize and conserve the
wasted product in the larger gas pro-
ducing states.
As part of the conservation program,
a number of absorption plants are in
the process of construction near the
large oil fields. From casing head gas,
which "blows" the oil to the surface,
liquid hydrocarbons (natural gasoline)
are extracted. In the absorption proc-
ess, the gas is passed over certain oils
which extract the gasoline. The gaso-
line can be separated either by distilla-
tion or by compressing it until the de-
sired portion liquefies. "Natural gaso-
line" is extremely volatile and therefore
is used in making high octane aviation
fuel. Blended with heavier gasoline por-
tions, it produces an automobile fuel
capable of quick starting and good mile-
age. Once it has been stripped of its
gasoline content, the "dry" gas is piped
away to industry.
The second method of conservation
is to "repressure" underground oil reser-
voirs. These oil reservoirs extend over
huge underground areas and the oil is
boosted up through bore holes, which
are from six to eight inches in diameter,
by the pressure of the gas. To maintain
or rebuild this essential pressure dry
gas is forced down "input" wells into
the oil-bearing sands. Not only does
"repressuring" reduce the wastage con-
nected with casing head gas, but it also
enables a higher percentage of the oil
to be recovered at less cost.
In the past five years 332 billion
cubic feet of gas have been returned to
underground reservoirs in Texas. A
rather large amount of gas is also re-
turned to underground storage in de-
jrom page 24)
pleted natural reservoirs to await the
peak demands of the winter months.
Even though the figures for the losses
of natural gas sound rather alarming,
over 80 per cent of the total production
is marketed or used in "repressuring."
The loss from gas wells, excluding cas-
ing head gas from oil wells, dropped
from about 37 per cent in the early
thirties, to less than 5 per cent last year.
A greater emphasis has been placed on
conservation, the lost production of the
total industry has dropped, until in
1943, only 14 per cent of the total was
flared off, which is a smaller percentage
loss than is experienced by most other
mineral industries. The two main rea-
sons for flaring gas today are that it's
not always feasible to return gas to un-
derground reservoirs and that there is
no market available to utilize the gas at
a price that would cover the cost of a
processing plant.
On reviewing the rapid growth and
the amazing potentialities of this won-
derful product one wonders how much
gas we actually have in the ground to
support withdrawal at the present rate.
Various "authorities" have stated their
opinions on the subject, ranging from
the pessimistic thought that the gas re-
serve is nearly depleted, to a more opti-
mistic thought that the gas will last
for thousands of years to come. Taking
the middle course, the War Petroleum
Administration estimated in January,
1944, the extent of the gas reserves at
113 trillion cubic feet. E. L. DeGolyer,
one of the most influential petroleum
geologists, told a Senate investigating
committee that the proved gas reserves
were 140 trillion cubic feet. He further
stated that taking into account the
probable extension of existing fields and
the development of new smaller fields,
the present gas reserves are more in the
neighborhood of 200 trillion cubic feet.
He also pointed out, in regard to the
discovery of additional reserves, that
drilling to greater depths have resulted
in the discovery of a greater proportion
of gas to oil, as compared to that found
at shallower depths. Assuming these
estimates to be reliable and taking into
account the increasing proportion of gas
found with increasing demand, the fu-
ture of the gas industry seems secure
for a good number of years using gas
at the present rate of 4 trillion cubic
feet a year.

negotiated in Paris for production in
the United States of the Longnemare
carburetor, and in 190S, in conjunction
with Earl Holley, he established the
Holley Carburetor Company in Detroit.
Charles Brady King
The first man to build and drive an
automobile on the streets of Detroit,
now the motor capital of the world,
started life as a builder of railroad cars.
Mr. King was graduated from Cornell
in 1891, and went to work for the Mich-
igan Car Company. Later he joined the
Russell Wheel and Foundry Company,
as head of the pneumatic department.
It was in 1896 that Mr. King built and
drove the first horseless carriage in De-
troit. The concern of the authorities
over this new mode of transportation
was so* great that his speed was limited
to five miles an hour, and he was or-
dered to be out of Belle Isle Park,
where he conducted tests, before 5 a.m.
each day. Mr. King later built motors
for other automobile manufacturers, in-
cluding the forerunner of the once well
known Cartercar. A four-cylinder en-
gine he designed became the Buffalo
Marine engine. Mr. King, who now
lives in retirement at Larchmont, N. Y..
also founded the company which built
the Northern, once one of the motor
industry's outstanding names.
Charles W. Nash
Mr. Nash, who has headed some of
the industry's biggest companies in a
long and colorful career, began working
when he was six years old. Born at
DeKalb, 111., Jan. 28, 1864, he was
"bound out" to a Michigan farmer un-
der an agreement that was to remain
in force until he was 21. After six years
of farm chores, relieved only by three
months of schooling a year, the young
Nash ran away and apprenticed himself
to a carpenter for a wage of $9 a month.
He started his business career in a $1-
a-day job with the Durant-Dort Car-
riage Company, of which he later be-
came general manager. After heading
Buick and later General Motors, Mr.
Nash organized his own company, Nash
Motors, in 1916. Nash Motors was
merged with the Kelvinator Corpora-
tion in 1936, and Mr. Nash became
chairman.

materials research
Improper use of process, improper
use of standardization, and lack of
quality control defeated a nation strong
in science, with many new weapons and
years of preparation for war. Unques-
tionably Germany was defeated tech-
nically more by the overwhelming num-
ber than by the individual superiority
of our arms. The miracle of American
production is based on a design related
to obtaining the most from the process
used, materials of uniform quality and
high-speed production methods using
high power and automatic machinery.
Germany made the mistake of standard-
izing too early and too inflexibly and
was therefore unable to take advantage
of improvement in the art. They also
lacked understanding of design for the
use of high-speed production methods
for which slave labor and expert crafts-
men could not compensate.
Progress in science is based upon re-
search. Research might be said to be a
natural human expression involving
man's curiosity about his environment.
Scientific research can be classified as
basic research on one hand and applied
science on the other. Basic research is
concerned with new principles and new
conceptions, and the understanding of
Nature and its laws and generalizations.
Basic research is also concerned with
techniques and methods of making re-
producible tests and is most often done
without thought of specific practical
ends.
Between basic research and applied
science there is a great amount of ac-
cumulated knowledge, data and art. Re-
search is principally concerned with
the collection of vast masses of data
from many carefully controlled tests and
measurements. Not only must there be
a reproducible test, but there should be
sufficient data to satisfy the laws of
chance or probability that the measure-

What muscles are to human bodies, S. S. White flexible shafts are
to mechanical bodies. Like muscles, S. S. White flexible shafts
are flexible elements for transmitting rotational power and con-
trol to moving parts—metal muscles for motivating all kinds of
driven and controlled mechanisms—muscles that never get tired
and are practically immune from injury.
As basic mechanical elements for power transmission and
remote control, S. S. White flexible shafts offer many physical
and economic advantages. Chief among these are their simplicity
for the purposes they serve and their ready adaptability.
These advantages are the reasons why annually, millions of
feet of S. S. White flexible shafts go Into aircraft, motor vehicles,
machinery, portable tools, radio and electronic equipment and a
wide variety of other products.
As an engineer you will find It well worth while to familiarize
yourself with the range and scope and possibilities of these
metal muscles for power transmission and remote control.
THIS BULLETIN WILL HELP YOU
It gives the basic (acts and technical data about
flexible shafts and discusses their application for

ments are under control and reliable.
Engineering design is based both upon
natural laws and upon the data that
have been collected by all the investi-
gators working in a particular field.
Modern industry is based upon spe-
cific requirements controlling the useful
quality of athe material produced. In
promoting the knowledge of materials
and the standardization of specifications
and methods of test, the usual proce-
dure is the development of methods of
test, followed by the collection of data,
and then the arrival at the necessary
specifications for control of quality.
Future industrial methods will require
more advanced controls of quality as
science is utilized more efficiently.
Because of this trend and since new
products must be found at the frontiers
of science, scientific research has now
teamed up with technology in the crea-
tion and discovery of new and useful
products. Engineering demands are so
great today for better materials and
processes and products that basic scien-
tific research is being pressed for results.
It is expected that this condition will
be alleviated when our scientists return
to basic research now that the emer-
gency has passed.
Several important trends in the scien-
tific development of useful materials
can be recognized. Ferrous and non-
ferrous alloys, stainless steels and light
metals have been established. Recent
progress in metals has surrounded proc-
esses of die castings, electro-deposited
metals, and metal powders. Vapor-
deposited metals or metals deposited or
combined with other metals in the vapor
phase may well be the next important
field of investigation.
In chemical research the trend is from
fuels and lubricants, rubber and plas-
tics, soaps and solvents to adhesives
which will have application to composite
materials. The trend in methods of test
is in the direction of the mass spectro-
graph, the infra-red spectrograph, and
the electron microscope. Great strides
have been made during the war in proc-
ess and fabrication and it is therefore
to be expected that the immediate fu-
ture will see an age of prefabrication
and process development. As a result
labor will have more power at its dis-
posal and will produce more than by
conventional methods. As technology

aladdin's lamp of television
Recently throwing aside a veil of
wartime secrecy, the Radio Corporation
of America exhibited for the first time
a new television camera of revolutionary
design and sensitivity in the studios of
the National Broadcasting Company,
Radio City, New York. Described as
the "Aladdin's Lamp of Television" by
NBC vice-president John F. Royal, the
intricate electronic eye, 100 times more
sensitive than its prototypes, was put
through its paces before an intensely in-
terested audience of newspaper and
magazine writers.
During the series of studio dem-
onstrations and remote pickups, the
startling new tube, called the Image
Orthicon by the wizards of RCA, clearly
transmitted scenes illuminated only by
candle and matchlight, far surpassing
any performance by its earlier brothers
in the television field.
At one point during the demonstra-
tion, the studio lights were extinguished

and the audience sat in complete dark-
ness. Infra-red rays, invisible to the
human eye, were directed into the room.
When television receivers in the room
were operated, members of the audience

dancer and other persons in the room

the naked eye.
If expectations of RCA executives are
any indication, the device heralds a
bright new age for television. It will
soon be possible for the American public
to bring into its home televised images
of a high and pleasing quality, thus put-
ting on a solid financial basis radio's
most expensive pet. Television home re-
ceivers using the new device and selling
at a price comparable to that of a large
home radio will begin coming off the
production lines by early summer of this
year.
The super-sensitivity of the new tube
has solved many of the most knotty
problems of television illumination. It
opens the field for round-the-clock
coverage of news and special events,
and in all kinds of weather and lighting
conditions. Incorporated in a new
portable television camera, the Image

of theatricals, concerts, and indoor

Chemistry Finds Better Way to Descale Steel
One of the most bother-
some problems in the met-
al industry is the removal
of scale from the surface
of stainless steels and
other alloys. Scale is a
thin film of metal oxide
which forms at high tem-
peratures during fabrica-
tion or processing. It is
very abrasive to dies and
other metal-forming
tools, and if not com-
pletely removed causes
serious flaws in the sur-
face of finished products.
Several years prior to
World War II, Du Pont
chemists, engineers and
metallurgists went to
work on the problem of developing
a quick and positive descaling proc-
ess. When success came three years
later, a secrecy order prevented its
public announcement at that time
—the discovery went directly into
war work.
Process Development
In developing the process, a group
of Du Pont Chemists found that
small amounts of sodium hydride,
dissolved in molten sodium hydrox-
ide, effectively removed scale with-
out attacking the base metal or em-
brittling it. However, the problem
then arose of finding an efficient and
economic means of obtaining the
sodium hydride. This was accom-
plished by developing an ingenious
apparatus for forming it directly in
the molten sodium hydroxide (700°
F.) from metallic sodium and gaseous
hydrogen.
Metal chambers, open at the bot-
tom, are placed along the inside of
the descaling tank and partly im-
mersed in the bath. Solid sodium is
introduced into these chambers, and
hydrogen gas bubbled through. The
sodium hydride formed is diffused
uniformly throughout the molten
caustic.
Practical Application
The metal to be descaled is im-
mersed in the bath which contains
1.5 to 2% of sodium hydride. Scale
is reduced to the metallic state for

the most part in from a few seconds
to twenty minutes, depending on the
size and type of material.
The hot metal is then quenched in
water, and the steam generated ac-
tually blasts the reduced scale from
the underlying metal. A water rinse
and a short dip in dilute acid com-
plete the process and produce a clean
bright surface.
This process has been called the
most significant development in the
cleaning of metal surfaces in decades.
It is representative of what men of
Du Pont are doing to help American
industry to better, quicker, more
economical production methods.
MAN-MADE SPONGES PRO-
DUCED BY DU PONT CHEMISTS
Among the most versatile members
of the family of cellulose products—
whose members include rayon, cello-
phane, lacquers and plastics—is the
synthetic sponge.
Du Pont cellulose sponges have
many of the attributes of the kind
that grow in the sea, plus several ad-
ditional advantages. For example,
quality can be kept uniform; texture
and hole-size can be predetermined;
they can be cut to handy shapes, and
they may be sterilized by boiling.
The complicated 10-day manufac-
turing process starts when viscose is
produced by adding carbon disul-
phide to alkali cellulose {from wood
or cotton), and dissolving the mix-
ture in water and mild alkali. To
produce holes, crystals of the desired
size are introduced. Heating in a salt
solution hardens the viscose and dis-
solves out the crystals. Washing,
centrifuging and oven-drying com-
plete the operation.

When the United States entered the war
the demand of the armed forces for
television applications called for an ac-
celerated research pace by RCA scien-
tists, thus enabling the development of
the tube much sooner than under nor-
mal conditions. It was used successfully
during the war by the Navy, acting as
the "eyes" of a "ghost bomber." Some
of these pilotless attack ships were em-
ployed against the Japs at Rabaul.

A "Glomb"—a television-controlled glider-bomber that can "see" its target ahead
and be guided to it from some remote point.
The Image Orthicon has a large
cylindrical head about 3 inches in diam-
eter by 3 inches long, joined to a shank
of 2 inch diameter. Overall length is
about IS inches. The tube consists of
an electron image surface for amplify-
ing the photo-electric current, a scan-
ning section more compact and less
intricate than pre-war types, and an
electron multiplier section which am-
plifies the relatively weak video signals,
or light impulses from the object being
televised, before transmission. The
super-sensitiveness of the new tube is
based on a principle similar to the mul-
tiplier phototube used by astronomers
to measure starlight—the principle of
secondary electronic transmission. Elec-
trons are made to bombard a target
known as a "stage," or "dynode." The
arrangement is such that for each elec-
tron striking the dynode, two or more
electrons are emitted from it. Each of
these newly liberated electrons are di-
rected to another dynode where again
more electrons are emitted than strike
the target. This process is repeated
through a series of dynodes until the
multiplied effect of the original impulse

Makes Dies Last Longer
and Saves Refitting Time

This crankshaft trimming die is hard-
faced at points of wear with Haynes
Stellite. It trimmed from 150,000 to
155,000 pieces before it was returned
to the die shop for touching up. Before
the practice of hard-facing these trim-
ming dies was adopted, they produced
less than 500 pieces before it was neces-
sary to refit them.
Haynes Stellite increases the life of
all types of dies because it resists abra-
sive wear even on hot work. Mainte-
nance costs are reduced—as dies have to
be changed less frequently, and, also,
you can refit a hard faced die in less
time than is required for refitting a
plain steel die.
For further information on savings
that can be made by hard-facing with
Haynes alloys, write for the 100-page
book, "Hard-Facing With Haynes

On weak signals, when the light in-
tensity striking the camera tube is about
.01 candles per square foot, the multi-
plying effect is about 100. At an in-
tensity of 10 candles the effect drops to
about 10. This phenomena makes pos-
sible the provision of an intensity con-
trol, similar to automatic radio volume
control, a distinct advantage in televi-
sion since it prevents high intensity
areas from blotting out those of low in-
tensity.
The scene being televised is focused
by means of an optical lens system on-
to the photo-sensitive surface of the
tube. The number of electrons emitted
from this surface is in proportion to
the intensity of light rays striking min-
ute areas of the surface. A positive
voltage grid directly behind the sensitive
surface forces these electrons to flow
towards a scanning target in paths held
parallel by an electro-magnetic field.

emission of electrons which leaves a
pattern of positive charges correspond-
ing to the light pattern of the scene be-
ing televised.
An electron gun in the base of the
tube sends a scanning beam across the
back of the target. An arrangement is
made such that the electrons in the
beam will slow down just as they ap-
proach the target and return to their
source, unless they approach a section
of the target carrying a positive charge.
When this happens, enough electrons
are deposited on the back of the target
to neutralize the positive charges, after
which the beam will again fail to reach
the target.
Now of varying electron intensity,
and carrying picture information where
electrons were left behind on the target,
the beam returns to the base of the tube
and strikes the first of a series of mul-
tiplying dynodes. The signal impulses
are amplified until they reach a signal
plate where they are carried out of a
tube into an external connection.
These signals are later received in
a receiver set by means of which the
stream of electrons are transmitted to a
screen in such a way as to re-create the
scene being televised.

model airplanes grew his desire to at-

University of Michigan.
Evan began his college career in a

blaze of glory by becoming a member
of Phi Eta Sigma honor society in his
Freshman year. He was one of the foun-
ders of the popular Flying Club on this
campus. He is also a member of Phi
Kappa Phi, as well as being active in the
Westminster Guild at his church. As a
Junior, he was selected to become an
Engineering Council Representative—a
very high honor. Not to be forgotten
is the fact that he is a Greek letter man
—that is, he is a member of Sigma Phi

greatest honor he has achieved is his
membership in Tau Beta Pi, highest
Engineering Honor Society.
Evan plans to return to the Univer-
sity of Michigan next fall to work for
his masters degree in Aeronautical En-
gineering. He has great faith in the
Engineering School here, and hopes, as
do so many others, to see a quick return
of this College's famed honor system.
Evan admits that "he likes it here," and
certainly no small part of his reason for
coming back is the girl living in Martha

There are, for instance, six Gas furnaces for MAGNESIUM
MELTING. These furnaces utilize the ultra-modern
ceramic Gas burner, thirty to each furnace. The pot,
which sits inside the furnace shell, holds a charge of
about 4,000 pounds of magnesium. Temperatures range
from 1350° to 1500° F. (Photo No. 1).
The well equipped MACHINE DEPARTMENT has
six muffle type Gas furnaces and a Gas heated salt bath
furnace. This equipment provides accurately controlled
temperatures ranging from 1400° to 2400° F. for heat
treating dies, mandrels and other production tools.
(Photo No. 2).
In the EXTRUSION DEPARTMENT, there are four
large extrusion presses and between each pair of presses
are large, Gas fired traveling furnaces through which
billets pass to be preheated before extruding. (Photo
No. 3).
ANNEALING of finished products, such as the tube
shown here, as well as treatment of scrap (burning off
oil and other waste prior to re-melting) are accomplished
in a direct fired, recirculating, Gas unit, automatically
controlled. (Photo No. 4).
Gas, the most versatile fuel for all types of heat
treating will do the speediest, most efficient, most
economical job.

IT'S TIME TO CONSIDER -
There are several questions which
are important to all engineering stu-
dents, but which should be considered
particularly by you newly-arrived
veterans, freshmen, and prospective
students in Michigan's College of
Engineering. These are the develop-
ment of proper study habits, the
planning of each student's program
which will afford him the greatest
possible development of his talents
and the highest possible degree of
happiness in later years, the extra-
curricular activities available in cam-
pus life, and, in developing higher
professional ethics, the vigorous sup-
port of the Honor System in the En-
gineering College.
Everyone realizes, of course, that
he must apply himself to be a suc-
cessful engineer, but all too many
students go through life without hav-
ing developed their concentrative
powers in extracting knowledge from
books and experience, for successfully
applying themselves in their respec-
tive fields of endeavor. Many sug-
gestions have been put forth for help-
ing students to increase their knowl-
edge and efficiency by deriving great-
er benefit from their study hours.
One important aid is to plan your
day by scheduling your time for
classes, study, and relaxation. By
adhering to a well-balanced plan of
eating, working, sleeping and play-
ing, most students greatly increase
their capacity to "get things done."
By practicing the habit of briefly
looking over your prepared assign-
ments each morning before you go
to class, you can fix many additional
important details in your mind. By
increasing your reading speed and
periodically testing your ability to
extract information through reading,
you can enlarge still more your ca-
pacity for work. You should develop
your ability to take short, compre-
hensive notes, to make it easier for
you to study or to review for an ex-
amination. You must, above all,
conscientiously strive to reduce the
time that you waste each day through
day-dreaming, poorly-timed "bull
sessions" (ordinarily a valuable part
of your college experience), and other
distractions which crop up.
Students must always remember
that college is primarily a prepara-
tion for living a fuller, more enjoy-
able, more successful existence than
might otherwise be possible. Accord-
ingly, it is necessary to contact your
advisors in planning your program of
specialization. So many things are
crammed into four years' work that
it is necessary for you to study things
most pertinent to your personal life
and your business life. Many stu-
dents are helped toward the most
efficient use of their abilities by
studying the results of aptitude tests
available through the University and
the Health Service. Others find that
through intimate association with
their professors they are able to make
wise adjustments in their plans.
Since social life is very important
to success and well-being, students
will find it wise to engage in extra-
curricular activities on campus, time
and grades permitting. At Michigan
there are the technical societies which
broaden a person's social range by
making new contacts and by actively
engaging in discussions which help
to prepare him for the practical ap-
plications of his engineering knowl-
edge. The A.S.M.E., A.I.M.E., A.S.
C.E., A.I.Ch.E., I.Ae.S., and S.W.E.
all contribute greatly to college life.
In addition, there are such activities
as the Glee Club, the Engineering
Council, the staff of the MICHIGAN
TECHNIC, and various other organ-
izations. Each incoming student
should make it his business to learn
about these activities and to pursue
one or two which will afford him the
greatest satisfaction.
Last, but not least, each student
should endeavor to fulfill his respon-
sibility in upholding the Honor Sys-
tem of unproctored examinations in
the College of Engineering, by put-
ting himself above petty cheating.
Thus, he will have greatly improved
his moral calibre, in preparation for
the high degree of professional ethics
required of all successful engineers.
The Honor System is being practiced
in most Junior and Senior classes,
but to be fully effective it needs to
be endorsed and practiced by the
lower classes.
The Honor System, as it is sup-
posed to function, consists of each
student signing a pledge on his test
paper to the effect that he has neither
given nor received aid in that exam-
ination. The greatest difficulty in
successfully applying the Honor Sys-
tem is that students will not report
offending cheats, and the high ideals
of the system are not achieved.
Along with the responsibility of
refraining from cheating, each stu-
dent should feel that it is necessary
to report cases of cheating. When
this condition is achieved the Honor
System will be one hundred percent
operative. Consequently, each stu-
dent has a distinct opportunity to
render the college and his future pro-
fession a valuable service by seeking
to perpetuate the ideals of which we
engineers can be justly proud.

Launching a New Era...
Nearly half a century ago, George Westinghouse developed
a revolutionary steam turbine that supplanted the steam en-
gine as a driving force for central station generators.
Always vitally interested in better transportation, Westing-
house quickly realized that here was the ideal power source
for ship propulsion. Because of its compactness, the steam
turbine would permit more space for fuel. . . reduce weight
and vibration .. . assure far greater fuel economy.
But there was one difficult engineering problem that no
one had yet solved—an efficient means for coupling the rapidly
whirling turbine shaft with the ship's slow-moving propeller.
George Westinghouse supplied this missing link—with the
help of marine experts, Rear Admiral Melville and John H.
Mac Alpine—by developing the first practical gear-reduction
turbine drive.
After six long years of study and experiment, Westinghouse
built two 3250 horsepower geared turbines which were in-
stalled in the collier, U. S. S. Neptune — launched on June
21, 1912.
The trial run was a notable success. It was one of the great
achievements of George Westinghouse's remarkable career—
for it initiated a completely new epoch in marine propulsion.

TOD A Y — The world's greatest warships and maritime vessels
are powered by reduction-geared turbines, pioneered by George
Westinghouse in 1912. Many of them are driven by Westinghouse
propulsion equipment. Recently, the U. S. Aircraft carrier Lake
Champlain crossed the Atlantic at the record-breaking average
speed of 32.048 knots. The geared turbines in the Lake Champlain
— as well as in all other Essex class carriers — proudly bear the
nameplate of the Westinghouse Electric Corporation.

During the long war years, we were engaged in
war research work covering the vast fields of sciences.
The progress of our work definitely aided in the scien-
tific development needed to carry the war through to
a victorious ending.
Now we are as earnestly engaged in postwar re-
search, and indications are that it will surpass anything
of that character ever done heretofore. Through re-
search, our effort and thought is directed toward a bet-
ter world in which to live.
We are well equipped for sponsored projects in all
the sciences and branches of Engineering, and will be
glad to discuss your peace-time problems with you.

Views Nor Michigan's Surveying Omp: jenny Lake and the Tctons
Hoback River and Canyon.
Photgraphic Surveying began in this country about 50 years ago with the University of Michigan offering a fundamental
course for twenty years and an advanced course during the past 11 years. The camera has been a valuable aid to engineers
engaged in field surveys since photographs make the best record of physical conditions in the field and of the character and
quality of monuments. It is natural that the field engineers keep a record of the progress of construction by means of frequent
photographs. Today the availability of the airplane and special cameras for taking photographs from the air represent a
highly efficient and specialized technique of surveying. Students who complete the basic courses in our college, together
with a broad training in the fundamentals of surveying, may soon qualify as experts in particular fields as they complete the
necessary specialized training involved.

RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING KEEP GENERAL ELECTRIC YEARS AHEAD

HOW G.E. TRAINS DESIGN ENGINEERS
MOST college engineering grad-
uates hired by G.E. are
assigned to the Testing Depart-
ment for 12 to 15 months. At the
same time they may enroll in sec-
tions of the General Course or be
selected to follow one of the special-
ized training courses of the Design
Engineering Program.
ADVANCED ENGINEERING
Besides meeting in class one
morning each week, students spend
15 to 20 hours of outside time in
solving assigned problems. The
programs include a study of the
fundamentals of electric machinery,
electronics, and fluid mechanir-s.
Student engineers can continue this
course for as long as three years.
CREATIVE ENGINEERING
The intent of the Creative
Engineering Program is to give the
student with creative ability the
tools that will be helpful in future
work. Emphasis is placed on rotat-
ing assignment, as it has been found
more elT'-ctive, in developing crea-
tive ability, to place young men in
contact with several engineers of
proven ability. This program- last-
ing for about a year—also includes
some time spent in class.
GENERAL COURSES
The highly specialized sections
of the Design Engineering Pro-
gram are open to selected men —
the four engineering sections of the
General Course are open to every-
one. The sections include the Elec-
trical Section, a course in applica-
tion engineering; the Mechanical
Section, covering the materials
and processes used in the electrical
industry; the Electronics Section;
and the Engineering Fundamentals
Section.
The Engineering Fundamentals
Section includes a study of thermo-
dynamics, fluid mechanics, chem-
istry, and metallurgy as they relate
to Company products. The section
serves as a refresher course for
men who arc several years out of
school and emphasizes to recent
graduates the importance of funda-
mental principles. Experienced en-
gineers recommend that it be
taken before any of the other tech-
nical sections. General Electric Co.,
