THINK OF all the valves in this
power plant as one valve, and
your mind's eye will see something
like this photo-illusion. It empha-
sizes an important fact—that
valves, collectively, are a major in-
vestment in any plant, any commer-
cial or institutional huilding.
with wages and material costs the
highest ever, it is just as important
for alert management to keep a
sharp eye on valve maintenance
costs as it is to watch operating ex-
pense of larger plant units.
EXCESSIVE MAINTENANCE of one
inferior valve is insignificant, hut
multiplied hy thousands, it is a
serious drain on operating budgets.
JENKINS BROS, helps to meet this
problem two ways. First, by build-
ing extra endurance into Jenkins
Valves, making them the longest-
lasting, lowest-upkeep valves that
money can buy. Second, with advice
from Jenkins Engineers on any
question of proper

NON-FERROUS MELTING *
Production of Marine Hardware
at ELCHINGER FOUNDRY, NEW ORLEANS,
Demonstrates Efficiency of
TEMPERATURE CONTROL is one of the most
important factors in melting brass and bronze. And
the strict control of each heat is especially impor-
tant in the production of marine hardware which
is subjected to extreme service conditions.
At the Charles F. Elchinger foundry in New Orleans,
metallurgical supervision is facilitated by the use of
four Gas-fired crucible furnaces which are so precisely
regulated that any desired temperature can be main-
tained. This accurate control is necessary because
various alloys require temperatures varying from
1850° F. to 2300° F.
But controllability is just one of the features which
makes GAS the most desirable fuel for non-ferrous
foundries. The four Gas-fired furnaces in the Elchinger
foundry can be brought to heat in 2^-j hours from a
cold start or !]/£ hours in succeeding heats—a simple
demonstration of the speed of GAS.
The flexibility of GAS is important, whether it is
used in a small foundry specializing in certain alloys,
or in a large plant melting many types of non-ferrous
metals. That flexibility is emphasized in the produc-
tion control made possible in the Elchinger foundry
by the use of four small furnaces capable of economical
heating and reheating, at high speed, with GAS. In
addition, cores are baked in Gas-fired ovens.
In every non-ferrous foundry operation requiring
heat—for core-baking, melting, ladle heating—there's
a job for GAS and modern Gas Equipment worth
investigating.

Employees prepare one of the four cruci-
ble furnaces for charging. These Gas-
fired tilting furnaces are rated at 600
pounds each.

reconstruction of dutch
railways
Behind the headlines concerning Eu-
rope, the job of reconstruction is being
quietly and efficiently carried out. One of
the most completely destroyed railway
systems in the world is now back on its
feet. In the Netherlands, where retreat-
ing armies smashed bridges and destroyed
rails, the work of reconstructing trans-
portation facilities has almost been ac-
complished.
When Holland was overrun in May,
1940, there existed a completely modern
system of electric and Diesel-electric rail-
ways. Overhead cables electrically pow-
ered the main-line traffic at speeds up to
100 miles per hour. Other trains pow-
ered by Diesel-electric units were travel-
ing at 90 miles per hour.
The railroads system was left essen-
tially intact for over four years. Then
in September, 1944, when the first of the
Allied airborne troops landed in Holland,
a general railroad strike was called from
London.
In retaliation during their retreat, the
Nazi armies ruthlessly and systematically
destroyed the Netherlands railways. When
fighting was over in the land of the
Zuider Zee, 95 percent of the railroad
rolling stock was gone, 70 percent of the
bridges were destroyed, and 62 percent
of the roadbed was not usable.
A temporary rebuilding program was
begun at once. The idea was to put as
many miles of track into operating condi-
tion as rapidly as possible, and then to
raise the standards of operation above
pre-war levels.
The Moerdijk Bridge (the longest in
Holland) is a prime example of Dutch
resourcefulness. The bridge formerly
consisted of 14 arched spans, each 320
feet long. Trusses of various types were
substituted for the destroyed arches, and
in August, 1946, the bridge was again
in operation.
Initially only the main-line trains were
electrified. Most of the remainder were
Diesel-electric powered. The Diesel-
electric train sets usually consist of five-
car trains. The car bodies are construc-
ted throughout of steel and are fabricated
by electric welding. For the greater part,
the framing consists of hollow beams and
tubes of rectangular cross section.
With a view toward obtaining better
sound insulation, the floor, roof, and
walls of some cars are sprayed with fibre.
The windows on the Diesel-electric train
sets are in two sections. The bottom is
similar to the windows on American
trains, consisting of fixed double glass
with an air space in the middle. The
upper part of the window is of single

Reconstructed Dutch Railways
glass and can be raised or lowered. The
top speed of these Diesel-electric train-
sets is 100 miles per hour. When start-
ing on a level track, a speed of 75 miles
per hour can be attained in three min-
utes.
Plans are now in progress, nearing
completion, to replace the Diesel-electric
trains with all electric train-sets misilar to
the Illinois Central Electric near Chicago
or the Pennsylvania Electric on the east
coast. These electric trains will be similar
in construction to the Diesel-electric ex-
cept that they will be driven with electric
power transmitted from overhead cables.
In the near future Holland will again
have an efficient transportation system
built around modern railroads. w
new iron ore process
As soon as the late war ended, steel-
using industries attempted not only to
meet a huge demand for their product but
to build up depleted inventories of steel to
the pre-war level. The resulting demand
for steel has been the greatest in history
and, at the present time, the steel industry
cannot supply this tremendous tonnage.
The United States, however, now produces
more than one-half of the world's steel,
compared with 38% before the war.
While the steel industry is producing a
tremendous tonnage, it is not producing
the maximum possible tonnage which its
capacity would allow. The major reason
for this is the serious shortage of raw ma-
terials, iron scrap and iron ore. Iron scrap
is scarce mainly because of heavy exports
during the 1930's to Japan and other coun-
tries. This scarcity will adjust itself once
iron and steel-using industries have built
up their inventories to pre-war levels, but
what about the iron-ore scarcity?
The United States for the past half cen-
tury has been in the advantageous position
of mining far richer iron ore than all for-
eign countries put together. The gigantic
Hull-Rut-Mahoning group open-pit mine
at Hibbing, Minn., alone produced more
iron ore during World War II than any
foreign country could obtain from all its
sources. Even the richest mine on earth,
however, cannot produce a bountiful sup-
ply forever. This mine yielded 25,000,000
tons a year for the four most crucial years
of the war. It gave up only 16,000,000
tons in 1946, and less than 14,000,000
tons in 1947. The approaching exhaustion
of this mine forecasts the end of an era of
open pit mining on the Mesabi Range.
Based on these arguments how much
raw material, then, in the form of iron ore,

Why water gets better all the time
Most people take purified water for granted today. But
water now gets other scientific "treatments" as well... to
do highly specialized jobs.
New chemicals, for example, make hard water soft...
for a quicker, cleaner job of washing and laundering. And,
important to industry, are other chemicals that war on cor-
rosion . . . and lower the freezing point of water.
There is wetter-water, too . . . water chemically treated
so that it penetrates more quickly, spreads more evenly. It
helps do a better dyeing job on the clothes we wear. In
fire-fighting, wetter-water soaks in faster, quenches stub-
born blazes swiftly . . . and cuts fire and water damage.
To get the full benefits of water, we need today's engi-
neering advances and better materials. i\ew plastics now
used in our tough, long-lasting, lightweight garden hose.
Also, improved alloy steels in today's pumps, pipelines,
tanks . . . that bring water from reservoir to your home or
factory, where it's always on tap.
The people of Union Carbide produce these and many
other materials essential to the handling and treatment of
water. They also produce hundreds of other materials for
the use of science and industry, thus helping maintain.

FOR AIRCRAFT
by
ALLEN S. LANGE '45E
ntroduction
Amazing progress has been made in
the power, reliability and weight reduc-
tion of aircraft power plants in the past
45 years. However, the skill required to
operate a high-performance engine has
increased in almost the same ratio as the
power.
This is unfortunate, from the stand-
point of safety and efficient aircraft oper-
ation. From the viewpoint of safety, the
primary danger of the airplane control
system is the ease with which it permits
"pilot-error." The power plant control
system, combined with the flight control
system, presents the pilot with such a
myriad of dials, switches, levers, etc.,
that the miracle of modern flying is the
infrequency of "pilot-error" accidents.
This complexity (and the pilot fatigue
arising from this complexity) is the prin-
cipal cause of "pilot-error" accidents.
The second danger of a complex con-
trol system arises from excessive fuel con-
sumption, and excessive strain of power
plant components due to improper adjust-
ment of the dozen or more power plant
controls.
Furthermore, even if the improper ad-
justment of components does not create
a hazardous condition, it will lead to in-
creased operating costs in the form of
excessive wear and excessive fuel con-
sumption.
Operating technique may be broken
down into three divisions: 1. Flight con-
trol; 2. Navigation; 3. Power plant con-
trol. Obviously, as an aircraft moves
from one point to another, these three
groups are closely interdependent. (The
present experiments of the AAF in its
"robot" flights across the Atlantic illus-
trate the extent of this interdependence).
Flight control has already advanced to
a high degree of perfection, requiring
only infrequent settings of small knobs.
Navigation is in a state of flux, trying
to assimilate and classify the large num-
T of war-born electronic aids to naviga-
tion. One school would use these aids to
supplement the classical, or nautical,
Allen S. Lange
methods of navigation, and the other
school is striving to perfect, by means of
television, facsimile, radar, etc., a posi-
tion control system, wherein the location,
in space, of aircraft can be as positive as
the location of a freight train moving
through a traffic division.
Automatic power plant control offers
the aircraft designer the opportunity to
make a substantial contribution to in-
creased operating efficiency. This effi-
ciency may be achieved in the following
ways:
a) By reducing the number of power
plant controls from a dozen or more to
one, and combining this one control with
simplified instrumentation, "tell-tale"
lights, etc. Accidents due to "pilot-
error," and costs due to improper engine
operation may be reduced.
b) By facilitating the application of
power "cells," or "eggs," to aircraft, so
that power plants can be replaced in less
than an hour. This will eliminate the
detention of a large airplane for several
days while one engine is repaired; will
increase the aircraft's availability factor;
and may even allow for the use of fewer
aircraft.
c) By allowing ground personnel to
work at a bench or production line, with
tools and instruments readily available—
a consequence of power egg installations.
The increased efficiency of maintenance
technique, and the increased safety and
comfort of ground crews, should spell
large savings in this expensive item of
aircraft operation.
d) By eliminating the flight engineer
on large aircraft, and thus, possibly, be
instrumental in reversing the recent CAB
ruling requiring flight engineers on cer-
tain aircraft.
Attainment of increased safety and
operating efficiency is the chief responsi-
bility of the aircraft designer. Since auto-
matic power plant control is the keystone
to both cockpit and maintenance simpli-
fication, the designer must evaluate the
requirements of power plant control and
design a system meeting these require-
ments.
The scope of this paper is confined to
the investigation of power plants of the
reciprocating, internal-combustion en-
gine-and-propellor type, with multi-stage
superchargers. This excludes turbo-jets,
turbo-props, rockets, etc. Our limitations
cover power plants already in production,
which will probably be widely used by
airlines for some time. Power plants
smaller than those included probably can-
not justify the additional cost of auto-
matic control.
Power plant control requirements
The basic function of the power plant
is to provide thrust for the aircraft. The
controls by which the pilot governs the
operation of the power plant may be
separated into four groups: primary, sec-
ondary, tertiary, and auxiliary.
1. The primary group is composed of
those controls by which the pilot governs
the available thrust horsepower, namely,
the throttle- and propellor-pitch control.
2. The secondary group consists of
those controls which insure that required
performance is obtainable in response
to throttle movement, and includes mix-
ture, supercharger speed, ignition timing,

OCTOBER, 1948


and air-cleaner by-pass.
3. The tertiary group is made up of
those controls which are necessary for the
satisfactory running of an engine, includ-
ing carburetor heat, engine and oil cool-
ing, and inter- or after-cooling.
4. The auxiliary controls are those
used for starting and stopping the engine,
or for an emergency, and include prim-
At present, these controls overlap. A
change in power requires resetting of
both boost and engine speed. Since both
variables are usually changed in unison,
integration of both throttle and propellor
pitch into a "power" control seems to be
the first step in control simplification, and
the first requirement of a power plant
control.
Fig. 1 shows such an integrated system.
ing pumps, starting magneto (or booster
coil), tank selector, engine cut-out, oil
dilution, propellor feathering and revers-
ing, fire extinguishers, etc.
Throttle- and propellor-pitch control
are at present semi-automatic on many
power plants within the scope of this
paper.
Automatic propellor-pitch control is
designed to maintain constant engine
speed for any given setting by means of
a variable-datum flyball governor, geared
to the crankshaft. This governor con-
trols a servo-mechanism which increases
or decreases propellor pitch as the aero-
dynamic load changes.
Thrust and torque forces, and aero-
dynamic and centrifugal blade torque are
other possible control motivators, but the
centrifugal force system mentioned is
widely used.
Automatic throttle control is designed
to maintain a constant manifold pressure
for any given setting by a variable-datum
pressure-sensitive element which con-
trols a servo-mechanism, acting on the
throttle butterfly and supercharger speed.
This is a hydraulic system using engine
oil, which gives very satisfactory results
on installations of this sort. Moving the
power lever in the direction indicated by
the arrow opens the throttle. As the
power increases, the flyball governor in-
creases the propellor pitch. The tension
spring increases the centrifugal force re-
quired to increase the blade angle, allow-
ing the engine rpm to increase as the
throttle opens. This latter linkage might
require a cam to get low rpm for economy
cruise and high rpm for power cruise,
with approximately the same throttle
opening. (See Fig. 3.) It is interesting
to note that this cam may be shaped so
as to relate power and rpm in accordance
with the envelope of the curves of brake
mean specific fuel consumption versus
brake horsepower for different engine
speeds.
Mixture, supercharger speed, and igni-
tion timing are at present semi-automatic
on most power plants within the scope
of this paper.
On manual systems, mixture is changed
with changes in altitude or power, based
on indications of an exhaust-gas analyzer.
Semi-automatic mixture control uses a
temperature- and pressure-sensitive cap-
sule to eliminate altitude enrichment, and
manual selection for economy or power.
The latter control seems to be a simple
addition to the "power" control. This
would, by means of the cam arrangement
mentioned in the discussion of Fig. 1,
make mixture control completely auto-
matic and achieve a high degree of sim-
plification.
Supercharger speed is also varied with
altitude and power: increased speed for
higher altitude and more power; de-
creased speed for lower altitude and
economy. On some existing installations,
supercharger speed-ratio is controlled by
the automatic boost-control unit.
Supercharger speed control is usually
limited to two systems: 1. The two-speed
control, with a high- and low-blower
range, either in one or two stages, and
2. The infinite speed control, using
either a turbo-supercharger or a variable-
speed fluid coupling.
Both systems are already automatic in
many installations, so we may easily in-
clude supercharger speed in our "power"
control. It is important to note, how-
ever, that in a turbo installation, the
turbine overspeed control must override
the manifold pressure requirements. A
simple flyball governor, driven at turbine
speeds and controlling the waste-gate
opening, should be satisfactory for this


control. Fig. 2 illustrates this integration.
When the throttle is fully opened,
further motion of the power lever brings
the valve spool into contact with the body
of the pilot valve. This motion is trans-

HOWARD P. SEELYE
The Detroit Edison Company Chief Elec-
trical Engineer—Engineering Division
The liberal use of electric power in its
various applications has become such a
commonplace part of the daily life of
this country that it might be imagined
that the systems and equipment for pro-
ducing it and delivering it to its con-
sumers must have been fully matured—
that there are few important engineering
problems to be faced. This is definitely
far from the fact. There are many ques-
tions of major importance continually
arising, and many new developments in
progress. A brief review of some of the
current problems pertaining to the system
of The Detroit Edison Company may be
of interest as typical of what is going on
throughout this great industry.
Although the present use of power
and the electrical loads carried by the
power utilities seem large, they are still
growing rapidly. The Detroit Edison load
at its peak last December amounted to
approximately 1,300,000 kilowatts. This
is almost double what it was in 1938,
ten years ago. It is nearly 250,000 kilo-
watts more than the highest load during
the war period. It is approximately
100,000, or about 8y2 percent, more than
it was one year ago. New uses for power
are being found continually, and it is
being used more freely in older applica-
tions. The average kilowatt-hour con-
sumption of domestic customers has risen
steadily for the past 12 years. Such in-
creases bring new problems on how to
serve such demand efficiently and eco-
nomically.
Not the least of such problems is that
of how long, and in what proportions,
this load increase will continue. At pres-
ent, turbo-generators must be ordered
about four years before the time they
are expected to be put into service. De-
liveries on other major equipment are two
years or more from date of order in many
cases. The system must be planned and
commitments made for large investment
on the basis of the load which is expected
at that time. If the estimate of load is
too large, money is wasted; a single
generating unit installation may run to
15 million dollars, or more. If the esti-
mate is too small, the capacity provided
may not allow sufficient reserve margin

Howard P. Seelye
above the actual load to insure the supply
under all likely conditions. Although
forecasts of load increase are based on
the best information available, they are,
at best, very uncertain, and a great deal of
judgment must be exercised in determin-
ing the rate at which future system
capacity should be installed. A reliable
prophet with or without a crystal ball
could help greatly.
The Detroit Edison Company has on
order four large generating units, of
100,000 kilowatts each, scheduled for
service within the next four years. This
is an addition of over 30 percent gener-
ating capacity. Tentative plans for the
future provide for several more of such
units when needed. Both present and
future plans have to be made sufficiently
flexible so that actual installation can be
slowed down if the load should not de-
velop as rapidly as is now anticipated.
This 100,000-kilowatt size of gener-
ator is larger than any heretofore used
on the system, and naturally introduces
new problems in design and installation.
At one location, where two of these ma-
chines will be installed in an extension
to the present plant, the entire 120,000-
volt switching station, which handles the
outgoing power, will be revamped. It is
being spread out physically and will be
divided into three different bus groups,
separated by reactors and regulators; this
is done in order to keep the short circuit
duty on circuit breakers within permissi-
ble limits, and to allow proper control of
voltage level, power flow, and kilovar
flow for portions of the system fed by
these groups.
Elsewhere on the system a new
120,000-volt overhead line about 70
miles long is being built to reinforce the
transmission from another plant into the
Detroit area. The conductors on this line
will be of large size and of aluminum,
different from those previously used on
this system. Thus, changes from previous
standards will be involved.
At another location, a 120,000-volt
underground cable line is being built be-
tween two major switching stations to
reinforce the transmission system. This
cable has three 1,500,000 circular mil,
heavily insulated conductors in a steel
pipe filled with nitrogen under 200 psi
pressure. Another such cable, the first of
its kind used in this country, has been in
successful operation on the system for
the past six years. This new cable will
have a normal carrying capacity of 175,-
000 kva, which makes it a very sizeable
transmission channel.
The system growth in size and in
loading brings continuously new and more
intricate questions in connection with
the flow of power and flow of kilovars
(the so-called "wattless power" which
supplies the magnetic fields) over the
transmission network, control of voltages
at various points, system stability, short
circuit duties, etc. Network analyzer
studies take the place of calculations to
a large extent in solving operating prob-
lems and in studying the proper location
for new power sources, kilovar sources,
additional lines, rearrangement of exist-
ing facilities, and numerous other matters
concerning the functioning of the bulk
power system. Several such studies are
being made each year for Detroit Edison
problems. For example, as a result of
such a study, during the past two years,
100,000 kilovars in static capacitors have
been added to the system in small blocks
at various points to supply needed kilo-
vars and improve voltage regulation.
In the future, a large increase in gen-

Oliver J. Todd '08E
"River Tamer" aptly describes Oliver
J. Todd. In an amazing career of a
score of years in China, he has built hun-
dreds of roads where they would do the
most good, and developed great public
works to provide aid for famine victims.
But most important of all, he has fought
unceasingly against the never ending
floods of China's great transportation
highways.
Just recently he has completed one of
the largest reclamation projects China has
ever seen. Working with the UNRRA,
he repaired dikes blasted during the re-
cent war, along the banks of the great
Yellow River. This project, by reclaiming
two million acres of fertile farm lands
from the waters of the Yellow River, has
provided employment and food for thou-
sands of Chinese.
Todd's first introduction to China
came in 1919 when he went to China on
a short-term contract on a field investiga-
tion for the Grand Canal Improvement
Board of the Chinese Government. But
this temporary stay lengthened into a
period of 19 years before his return to
the United States.
After completing his project for the

ws
UNRRA last November, Mr. Todd re-
turned to his home at Palo Alto, Cali-
fornia, where he maintains an office as a
Consultant Engineer. n T Tsl

A new magnetic alloy known as Per-
menorm 5,000-Z has been reproduced for

consultant. The application of the new
alloy in the engineering field will make
possible revolutionary changes in the recti-
fication of electric power; therefore, the
history of its development merits further
consideration.
The new alloy was first synthesized in
Germany in 1943 by fusing nickel and
iron in an intricate heat-treating process.
Unfinished samples of the new alloy
were found by the allied technical mis-
sions after the war and were brought to
this country for duplication; however, the
attempts at reproduction failed to pro-
duce a material exhibiting the same mag-
netic properties. Gaugler and Elmer not
only solved the problem, but also im-
proved the alloy when they developed
modern mass-production techniques.
Application of Permenorm 5,000-Z in
the fabrication of magnetic amplifiers
makes possible the replacement of trouble-
some electronic tube amplifiers in guided
missiles, fire control equipment, and un-
derwater ordnance devices. The alloy
was immediately applied by Naval Ord-
nance, and Mr. Gaugler recently intro-
duced Permenorm 5,000-Z to the Ameri-
can Institute of Electrical Engineers at
a symposium on new materials.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


By
DAVID STEIN
Associate Editor
In recent years, the subject of Pro-
fessional Engineering has become more
widely publicized and discussed in en-
gineering circles. The Michigan Tech-
NIC, realizing that the acquisition of in-
formation concerning this vital subject
by the neophyte engineer is more by
chance and hearsay than by direct inquiry,
has projected an article (to be printed
in the near future) which will attempt to
describe in detail the various aspects of
this subject.
The title of "Slide Rule Plumber" is
a standard, tongue-in-cheek appellation
conferred by students upon themselves
when discussing their future roles as en-
gineers. This may, or may not, be dele-
terious to the engineering profession as
a whole; but it is indicative of a need
for a crystallization of concept (both
in the mind of the public and in the
mind of the engineer) of the true dig-
nity of the real engineer. And by a real
engineer is meant a professional engin-
eer, and not a "plumber" who "wields a
slide rule and works with metals and
stuff."
In order to help achieve the crystalli-
zation mentioned above, a professional
engineer would be one who has earned
the title. The necessary requirements,
qualifications, etc. will be fully discussed
in the article mentioned; they include
a series of three examinations, usually
taken over a span of several years.
The first examination is of a general
nature, and tests the applicant's knowl-
edge of basic engineering subjects. The
second examination deals with legal as-
pects of engineering ethics (conduct, re-
lationships, etc.), and engineering speci-
fications. Finally, after a specified mini-
mum time spent as a practicing engineer,
the applicant is eligible to take the pro-
fessional examination, which is based on
the individual's actual experience as an
engineer.
The Michigan Technic hopes that
the printing of one of the Part I exam-
inations recently given will prove to be of
aid, academically and morally, to engin-
eering students. The printing of Part II
and Part III for public dissemination is
forbidden. The following is a reproduc-
tion of the latest general examination
given in Michigan. We have decided to
print it exactly as it was presented to
the examinees; proofreading was con-
fined solely to the prevention of gross
errors, such as misprinting and misspell-
ing.

Morning First Day
Answer any five questions—books allowed
1. A steel rod whose cross section is an
equilateral triangle 1 inch on a side
is to be used as stock for a hook to
support a static load of 300 lbs. Al-
lowable compression = 20,00#/ sq.
in. and allowable tension = 12,000
#/sq. in. What maximum clearance
from center line of load to inside of
hook would be allowable?
2. A dam is built across a river to regu-
late the flow. What should be the
length and elevation of the crest of
a spillway in the dam so that the
discharge may vary from 3,000 to
1,000 c.f.s. while the water surface
in the pond upstream from the dam
changes from elevation 100* to eleva-
tion 98'? What should be the eleva-
tion of the crest of an emergency
spillway 5C long to be used when
the elevation of the pond rises to
102' and the discharge increases to
8,000 c.f.s.? Assume a reasonable
coefficient for a rounded concrete
crest.
3. A centrifugal compressor and air tur-
bine is driven by an electric motor.
Air is first compressed in the com-
pressor, then cooled to within 5°F
of the outside temperature and then
allowed to expand through the tur-
bine.
If the outside temperature is 90°F
and the machine handles 100 lbs. of
air per minute, how much power
must the electric motor supply when
the compressor requires 30 horse
power and the discharge temperature
is 65°F?
Assume Cp = .238BTU per pound
per degree F.
4. The rated current of a 20. H.P., 220
volt shunt motor is 79 amperes,
while no load current is 5 amperes.
The no load speed is 1,000 R.P.M.
The armature resistance is 0.14 ohms,
and the field resistance is 208 ohms.
It is desired that the starting torque
of the motor equal the rated load
torque:
(a) What should be the total resis-
tance of the starting box?
(b) Calculate the current taken by
the armature when the speed be-
comes 25% of the no load value
with the entire starting resistance
in the circuit.
5. The lower chord of a pin connected
roof truss is horizontal and divided
into six panels of 1C each. The up-
per chord is also divided into six
equal panels, but it slopes 1 foot in
10 feet. The depth of the truss is
10 feet at the left end and 16 feet
at the right end. The diagonal mem-
bers all slope downward toward the
right. The truss is supported at the
right end and at 20 feet from the
left end. The trusses are spaced 20
feet center to center and the roof
load is 80 lbs. per sq. foot of hori-
zontal projection.
There is a load of 20,000 lbs. applied
on the lower chord at 20 feet from
the right end.
Draw a force diagram for the truss
showing the forces in the various
members. What is the magnitude and
kind of force in the diagonal to the
right of the left support? Check this
result by finding this force algebra-
ically.
6. A railroad running due north is to
be built on a level grade over a piece
of ground which slopes downward
toward the north on a 2j% grade.
The sub-grade is to be 60 ft. wide
in both cut and fill and is to have
side slopes of 3 vertical to 2 hori-
zontal in cut and 2 vertical to 3
horizontal in fill. Over a length of
2,000 ft. the cut and fill are to bal-
ance allowing 15% for shrinkage in
fill. What part of the 2,000 ft. will
be in cut and how many cubic yards
of excavation will there be?

lated by a linkage to the waste-gate (or
to the hydraulic scoop in a fluid coupling)
and increases the supercharger speed.
Pressure- and temperature-sensitive bel-
lows, connected to the intake manifold,
provide constant altitude correction and
prevent detonation. Exhaust back-pressure
(Continued from page 10)
the following methods: 1. Centrifugal
governor advances spark, with interlock
from boost control to retard spark at
high power; 2. Mechanical linkage,
operated from a cam on the "power" con-
trol completely controls spark.
The latter method has the disadvantage
also may be incorporated as a control
parameter. The electrical contact, closed
in the "emergency-power" position, actu-
ates a solenoid, subject to an adjustable
time period, which locks out the over-
speed governor and pressure-temperature
bellows.
In connection with the exhaust turbo-
driven supercharger, it is interesting to
note that the power plant engineer is be-
ginning to exploit more fully the avail-
able energy given up by the exhaust.
Cooling air ejection, de-icing, and cabin
heating are becoming quite usual prac-
tice. Compounding, and the use of an
exhaust turbine to drive the accessories
are other possibilities.
Ignition timing, which is automatic on
most power plants within the scope of
this paper, requires retarded spark for
starting and low speed, increasing ad-
vance with increased speed. To prevent
detonation, this advance must be over-
ridden by a retardation due to increased
boost. Manifold temperature and back
pressure are additional control parameters.
Control can be achieved by either of
of not being flexible enough to handle
unusual conditions, such as "hot" day
requirements. Since timing is built into
most power plants under discussion here,
it will not be included in the example.
However, consolidation with the auto-
matic control unit might facilitate main--
tenance and reduce the number of parts
required.
To the knowledge of the writer, there
is no power plant in production or oper-
ation which incorporates a multiple-
speed, propellor-drive, gear box. Criteria
for the selectivity of such a device are
engine torque and speed, air density, and
speed.
Experimental power plants with such
an arrangement have been restricted to
very high power output, and future turbo-
prop power plants might make use of a
gear box that uses propeller thrust for
take-off, climbing, and landing, and jet
thrust for high altitude cruising. Such
an arrangement would require a gear box
to disengage the feathered propellor at
altitude.
Air filters are required on many air-
craft for take-offs and landings, and on
special purpose aircraft, such as low-
altitude attack airplanes, crop-dusting
airplanes, etc., for continuous operation.
Some aircraft which require filtering for
take-off only, use filtered air continuous-
ly. This involves some head loss in the
induction system and requires an anti-
icing system, preferably automatic, to
prevent formation of ice (and subsequent
flow restriction) under certain atmos-
pheric conditions. Such a device could
be controlled thermally or by means of a
pressure differential, and could use either
electric current or hot air for de-icing.
Although the continuous filtering re-
moves water droplets from the intake air,
the ducting weight and reduction of air
mass through the engine because of heat-
ing, or the alternate, electrical de-icing,
indicate an air-filter by-pass might be
desirable.
Such a by-pass could well be operated
by a servo-motor controlled by landing
gear position. It has the further advan-
tage, when combined with exhaust by--
pass, of increasing take-off power. One
such installation on a large aircraft
added 7 percent to the take-off power
available by by-passing air through an
8 inch duct, as contrasted with flow
through 15 feet of ducting super-
charger and inter-cooler in the normal
induction system. This installation also


uses an exhaust collector-ring-butterfly-
valve to dump exhaust gases directly into
the outside air.
A high-performance military airplane

cold, unfiltered air enters under the spin-
ner and is carried aft through a duct
built integrally with the engine mount.
Just forward of the mixing gate is a
"hairpin" icing screen. If this screen
becomes iced, the "suction" in the duct
aft of the screen causes the well-balanced
mixing-gate to open (which, of course, is
manually controlled also). This is a
very simple and easy way to obtain an
automatic ice-free induction system, but
the price in supercharger weight required
to regain the head is excessive.
On an installation where continuous
filtering is desired (except when maxi-
mum available boost is required), a
tumbler-switch operated by the boost-
control could open the by-pass when the
throttle is 90 percent open, and close it
when the throttle is 70 percent open,
provided the engine operates at less than
full throttle for take-off, or incorporates
an override with the landing gear tie-in
mentioned previously.
Carburetor icing (i.e., icing peculiar
to induction systems that use a venturi
to meter the air flow and vaporize the
fuel), is due to refrigeration cooling
caused by the latent heat of the vaporized
fuel. This category of icing can be elim-
inated by injecting the fuel into the in-
duction system at some warmer part of
the engine, such as the eye of the super-
charger, or into the cylinder itself.
A more general type of icing is that
similar to icing on aircraft wings, control-
surfaces, etc. This icing is generally be-
lieved to be of three types: 1. The freez-
ing of super-cooled water on striking
some surface; 2. Water freezing on strik-
ing some surface of the aircraft which
is below the freezing temperature, and
3. Freezing at the throttle, etc., because
of a pressure drop.
The latter is no source of trouble in
most of the induction system ducting.
Careful intake design, and a trim of
electrical-conducting rubber around the
intake to keep the temperature above
freezing eliminate danger from this type
of icing.
Icing due to super-cooled water occurs
at: 1. The air intake; 2. The back of
the elbow leading from the intake to
the induction duct proper; 3. Any pro-
jection into the duct in the upstream por-
tions, such as throttle valves, carburetor
Venturis, etc.
Such icing can be prevented by sup-
plying heat whenever the temperature is
critical. This will result in a power loss
even if no free moisture is present.
Perhaps a more efficient solution woul&lt;
be a careful intake design combined with
previously mentioned rubber surfaces,
and the elimination of projections in the
cooler upstream regions of the duct. This
elimination is greatly facilitated by speed-
density metering. Fig. 4 illustrates an
automatic induction system.
The principle and mechanism of speed-
3. Vary ignition timing. The same prin-
ciple of integrating detector units can be
applied to the pressure and sensitive ele-
ments, as shown in Fig 6.
Control of engine cooling in liquid-
cooled engines is accomplished by means
of two parameters: 1. The rate of cool-
ant to the radiator is automatically con-
trolled by a thermostatic-valve; 2. The

density metering is well adapted to auto-
matic power plant control. For example,
the same centrifugal governor that chang-
es propeller pitch control can also be
used to: 1. Meter fuel; 2. Establish a
variable-datum for the oil-cooling servo;
rate of airflow through the radiator is
controlled by the pilot.
Incorporating the latter into some
automatic controls is complicated by the
fact that too sensitive a control will

able to go to a higher voltage for back-
bone transmission in Detroit. The 120,-
000-volt cable mentioned above is a start
in this direction. Several more such
cables, tying major power sources togeth-
er, are projected. With these must go
plans for proper system rearrangement,
including subdivision by reactors and
regulators to restrict short circuits, and
to control voltages, power flow and
kilovar flow. Such a system has been
tentatively laid out, but a great deal of
careful engineering study will be re-
quired before it is finally realized. This
planning looks ahead to a system of more
than two million kilowatts, and will
(Continued from page 11)
serve as a guide to the development of
the system over the next decade and
longer.
Interconnection with neighboring pow-
er systems is also an important feature of
power supply. Substantial economies are
possible in the co-ordination of operation
of large systems. At present there is a
50,000-kilowatt tie between the Detroit
Edison Company and Consumers Power
Company. The capacity of this will be
increased to 100,000 kilowatts and a
second tie of similar capacity installed
during the next year. This change has in-
volved considerable engineering study,
not only on the design of the intercon-

Hand-insulating stators in large electric motors

nections but also on the contractual and
operating arrangements for best results.
On the 24,000-volt overhead sub-
transmission system, which serves the
territory outside of the metropolitan De-
troit area, the increasing load is requiring
increased capacity. Several years ago the
transmission capability in the "Thumb"
area was more than doubled, at relatively
low cost, by converting the 24,000-volt
system to 41,600 volts. Single phase sub-
station transformers were reconnected
from delta to wye. The lines themselves
were, for the most part, left unchanged.
A similar conversion is now projected for
a large part of the suburban territory of
the company.
Increased power supply in this outlying
area will be provided, as required, by
several 120,000-volt step-down stations
tapped off the 120,000-volt lines, at in-
termediate points between main power
sources on the system. This extends the
120,000-volt transmission closer to the
load, and shortens the 24,000- and
41,600-volt lines radial from these points
to sub-stations. These tap stations are
new developments for the Detroit Edison
Company.
Increased load requires more distribu-
tion sub-stations. Sixteen of these are
definitely planned for this year and about
the same number during the next year.
Although the design of such stations is
standardized to a considerable extent,
each one introduces its own individual
differences, and the planning for them
and for the necessary incoming and out-
going lines always requires the applica-
tion of competent engineering knowledge
and experience. Also, new developments
in equipment, and new ideas in design
lead to continuous improvement in the
standards.
The same may be said for the lines
and equipment which constitute the distri-
bution system between sub-station and
customers. For these, the degree of stan-
dardization of materials and construction
is high, but they are still subject to con-
tinuing development. Distribution lines
contain very large numbers of repetitions
of unit assemblies and of numerous small
parts. Economy lies in the simplification
of design of these units, reduction in
variety, reduction of maintenance re-
quired, improvement of quality and of

When plans to deepen the Kill Van Kull channel
in New York harbor were announced, telephone
engineers had to plan a new submarine crossing
for the important New York-Philadelphia long
distance route.
There were many problems. How far below the
floor of the new channel should cables be placed?
How could a trench be opened through tons of mud
and shelves of rock? In the fast-flowing tides, how
could cables be laid squarely in the bottom of the
trench? How many circuits, what kind of cables,
what size, and how many should be provided for
future needs? These questions demanded, and got,
many engineering skills.
Despite obstacles, the job was completed on
schedule. Eighteen new cables, capable of carrying
5,600 simultaneous conversations, are entrenched
safely between Staten Island, N. Y., and Bayonne,
N.J.
It's another example of telephone engineering
at work.
BELL TELEPHONE SYSTEM

OCTOBER, 1948


"hunt" excessively, and too coarse a
control will not respond quickly enough
for sudden changes in power.
Any automatic system requires an in-
terlock with the landing gear, to prevent
over-heating for ground operations, with
an additional interlock with the boost-
control. The latter should provide for:
1. A few minutes operation at higher
temperatures for emergency power re-
quirements; and 2. A variable datum for
the temperature differential which oper-
ates shutter or gill opening.
In an air-cooled engine, the pilot con-
trols the flow of air through the engine,
and also can provide for some degree of
cooling by means of mixture enrichment.
The problem of automatic control, then,
is similar to control of air through a
coolant radiator.
The control of the oil-cooling system
is similar to control of the engine-coolant
system. A peculiarity of this system is the
overheating of the oil due to excessive
airflow at high altitude. This paradoxical
condition may be explained by the high
(Continued from page 13)
pressure, due to a high viscosity at low
temperature, causing oil to by-pass the
cooler and to overheat.
Since oil temperature is a function of
friction horsepower, engine speed pro-
vides a good variable datum for the
shutter servo, with the same tie-in with
landing gear mentioned in connection
with engine cooling.
To reduce time lag in either oil- or
coolant-controls, temperature should be
measured just downstream of the cooler.
Fig. 5 shows an automatic cooling sys-
tem.
Losses due to inter- or after-cooling
are weight penalties, and internal and
external aerodynamic losses. Because
there is such a side variation between
"optimum" and "hot" day requirements,
some automatic airscoop control, posi-
tioned by manifold temperature (and
perhaps free-air temperature) could re-
duce external aerodynamic losses and
increase performance on a maximum re-
quirement installation.
Among the auxiliary controls, pro-
pellor-featuring control and fire-extin-
guishing apparatus lend themselves most
readily to an automatic system. Such a
system could have an "emergency" button,
which would feather the propellor, cut
off ignition, cross-feed, and fuel supply,
close the cowl flaps (if the engine were
air-cooled and "arm" the fire-extin-
guishing system. The actual operation of
the fire-extinguishing system should be
thermally controlled.
Automatic starting requirements (ex-
cluding extreme cold-weather starting)
vary widely with operating conditions.
Such equipment could be made available
if there were a standardization of ground
equipment and operators' technique.
Commercial operations are usually
made on the basis of large margins of
fuel reserve, and tank selection could
well be made automatic. Some military
operations, however, might demand more
critical tank-selector timing than can be
obtained with present fuel quantity indi-
cators.

LEATHER HAS THE GIFT OF "G
that puts power to work
When you wrap your hands around the
leather-covered handle of a golf club, you get
an idea of the natural gripping capacity of
leather.

That same grip or high coefficient of friction
makes leather an outstanding material for
modern power transmission. The full-grain,
pore-like surface of a leather belt provides a
positive, non-slip pulley grip that assures
continued maximum efficiency.
That's why leather belting is turning so
many wheels in today's industry.

Since ancient times, ever since the
discovery of soap, the making of this product
has been strictly a "batch" affair. Even today,
most factories still make soap in huge kettles.
Recently, however, technical men at Procter
&amp; Gamble have developed a revolutionary new
continuous process for making soap. It starts
in a hydrolyzer like the one pictured right.
The entire process, diagramed below,
takes only a few hours, instead of the many
days required by the old method. In addition
to obvious savings, it also means improved
products. To develop it, P and G chemists
had to pioneer uncharted fields—to solve
many problems in the fundamental reactions
of fats and oils; engineers had to design high-
pressure equipment, high vacuum distillation
and "flash" drying units, and lay out and
construct new equipment, and entire new plants.
Now the process is in operation in many
P and G plants, with additional chemists and
engineers supervising operation and personnel.
This is just one example of P and G
technical teamwork in action; similar
developments progressing in other fields call
for additional men with technical training.
That's why P and G representatives periodically
visit the country's top technical schools to
interview students. If you would like to talk to
a P and G representative, ask your faculty
adviser or placement bureau to arrange
a meeting.

Fig. 6 shows a "block diagram," illus-
trating the inter-relation of the various
elements. Although the example shown
utilizes a hydraulic servo system, the
high degree of control and sensitivity ob-
tained with electronic circuits may lead
to an electric, or electro-hydraulic, system.
Conclusions
The policy of the Air Force with re-
spect to power plants for military air-
craft indicates a questionable future for
the automatic control of power plants
herein discussed. The Air Force has
made the decision to abandon the devel-
opment of reciprocating engines in favor
of turbine engines. To date, the opera-
tion of turbine engines appears to be
comparatively simple. Therefore, the fu-
ture of automatic power plant control
seems to depend on the willingness and
ability of the NACA to carry out a de-
velopment program, since neither the air-
lines nor the manufacturers seem to be
able, financially, to undertake such a
program.
It is realistic to anticipate some of the
(Continued from page 20)
objections that will be raised against the
use of automatic power plant control.
Some principle objections probably will
be: 1. Increased cost; 2. Lack of oper-
ational flexibility; and 3. Less dependa-
bility than present installations.
Undoubtedly, development cost will be
high. However, it is important to realize
that most aircraft described in this paper,
using power plants, already use all the
elements mentioned in the automatic con-
trol example. In fact, the automatic sys-
tem would, by consolidation, eliminate
parts, as explained previously.
The charge that an automatic control
would not be flexible enough is enter-
tained principally by pilots. Probably the
example shown in this paper could be
subject to such a criticism. However, such
a criticism cannot be applied with validity
to a modern electronic autopilot. A study
of modern industrial practice brings out
a number of interesting points in con-
nection with this. Practically the entire
gamut of industrial processes, from the
manufacturing of steel to the production
of very pure chemicals, is controlled by
automatic methods. In most cases, the
number of variables is fewer, and the
inter-relation of variables is less complex.
Moreover, the accuracy required may be
as much as 1,000 times greater than that
required for a power plant output. How-
ever, the weight of the industrial system
is not a factor; the weights of the
servo-motors are in close relation to the
magnitude of the forces—the detector
units are small and light in either case.
Further refutation of this criticism
exists in the comparison of action between
the manual and automatic systems. In the
manual system, the pilot detects, by
means of his instruments that, for ex-
ample, the oil temperature is too high.
He may notice this as soon as it occurs,
or it may go unobserved for a long period
of time. In other words, if things are
going smoothly, and the pilot can devote
sufficient time to watching his instruments
while he flys and navigates the airplane,
make radio reports, and follow cruise
control procedure, nothing very likely
will happen to the airplane. But if the

Efficiency in many mechanical devices is
often a matter of high speeds and low weight.
The resultant stresses make heavy demands
on parts, whether they be in aircraft or
automotive engines, machine tools or loco-
motives.
Molybdenum is the only alloying element
that gives steel the two vital necessities for
meeting such requirements—good harden-
ability and freedom from temper brittleness.
Molybdenum steels will also meet the
requirements of production economy.

pilot decreases the power setting, and does
not watch the oil temperature gage, the
oil cools off, solidifies in the cooler, and
the open shutters cause fuel-consuming
drag. Unfortunately, the pilot is stressed
too often by his duties to the extent that
he neglects his instruments in just such
a manner. It is a tribute to the engine
manufacturers that such commonplace
abuses cause so few accidents.
Contrast ibis situation with that of the
same pilot flying a plane equipped with
an automatic system. Without adding to
the pilot's mental overload, the oil temper-
ature is controlled constantly, held to an
optimum value by a system that not only
responds to the engine's requirements,
but anticipates changes in these require-
ments.
The third criticism, dependability, can
also be met by examining the industrial
parallel. It is readily admitted that a
factory can shut down because of failure,
without loss of life or equipment but not
without loss of money. Consequently it
is vital that automatic processes do not
fail. There is no magic in their dependa-
(Coniinued from page 24)
bility; it is the result of sound design and
frequent, careful inspection. Furthermore,
as has been mentioned previously, most of
this equipment is already in use. There
is no reason to believe that integration
will cause heretofore dependable equip-
ment to fail, nor should it be necessary
to install stand-by equipment merely be-
cause of the integration.
Some of the principle benefits of auto-
matic power plant control are: 1. Safer
operation, due to increased pilot effi-
ciency and increased power plant effici-
ency; 2. Savings affected by the elimin-
ation of a crew member; 3. Savings due
to increased efficiency of ground opera-
tions; 4. Simplification of ground-con-
trolled flight.
It is difficult to evaluate, in dollars
and cents, the benefits of safer operation.
It is impossible to evaluate the price of a
human life. But the loss of an airplane,
which may cost from $300,000 to $2,000,-
000, the cost of insurance, the loss of
highly skilled and trained employees, the
public's awareness of the danger of air
travel, are all very real problems for the
commercial airline operator. Of course,
automatic power plant control will not
"cure" all these problems. Navigation
and traffic control are probably the most
urgent considerations of the operators.
But the number of known accidents caused
by mishandling of power plant controls
indicates a large saving because of simpli-
fied power plant control alone.
On trans-oceanic commercial opera-
tions, proper cruise control spells the
difference between profit and loss; on
military patrol operations, proper cruise
control spells the difference between suc-
cess or failure. Yet proper cruise con-
trol depends not so much on the elab-
orate calculations of the power plant
designers, as on the ease with which the
flight crew can put it into effect.
If the proper cruise control can not be
effected without resorting to a score of
gages, a dozen levers and switches, and
several square feet of charts, the fault
lies not with the flight engineer, but with
the aircraft designer. It is the aircraft
designer's job to see that minimum fuel

Nylon owes its origin to a Du Pont
fundamental research project begun
in 1928. A group of scientists set out
to find out how and why the mole-
cules of certain substances polymer-
ized to form giant chainlike mole-
cules. Hope of obtaining a new com-
mercial fiber was first aroused when,
two years later, a polymer was de-
veloped which could be drawn out
into a thin strand, like taffy candy.
The complex problems which fol-
lowed called for the services of over
200 Du Pont men and women, among
whom were some of America's most
competent scientists and engineers.
Research—a Major Du Pont Activity
Nylon is an excellent example of
modern research at work at Du Pont.
Young scientists joining the organi-
zation now may share in other dis-
coveries of outstanding importance.
They may find opportunities in such
challenging fields as finishes, coated
fabrics and various fibers; synthetic
organic chemicals, including fine
chemicals; synthetic rubber; electro
and agricultural chemicals; plastics;
pigments and photographic film; and
high pressure synthesis.
Each often manufacturing depart-
ments of Du Pont has its own staff
and is operated much like a separate
company. Within each, research
men work in groups small enough
to bring quick recognition of indi-
vidual talent and capabilities.
Year after year, young, inquiring
minds come from leading U.S. schools
of science and engineering to Du Pont
— where individual ambition is
matched with opportunity, coopera-
tion and the type of friendly support
that brings out the best in each
person.

consumption and minimum engine wear
are obtained with minimum effort on the
part of the flight crew; viz., movement of
a power lever, monitored with a few sen-
sitivity adjustments. Automatic power
plant controls give the designer the tool
with which to obtain this goal.
Some indication of the savings which
may be expected by eliminating the need
for a flight engineer may be found in a
recent article reporting a CAB ruling re-
quiring flight engineers on the Douglas
DC-6 and Boeing 377. This article listed
the following "... early estimates":
Chicago and Southern: $38,000—training
costs; $100,000—aircraft modification;
$159,000—annual salaries and expenses;
$9,600—instructors' salaries; $478,000—
loss of pay load. United Air Lines and
American Airlines, operating 90 DC-6's,
will require 270 flight engineers with an
added wage expense of $1,620,000 annu-
ally.
A quick estimate of the savings made
available through the replacement of
fight engineers by automatic power plant
control should give some indication of
the economic desirability of such a de-
vice: Assume that an airplane is used
320 hours per month. Four flight en-
gineers, each with a salary of $600 a
month (working 80 hours per month)
would cost $2400 per airplane-month.
Estimating the flight engineer with his
gear to weigh 200 pounds, and assuming
the weight of the flight engineer's station
equal to the weight of the automatic sys-
tem (a generous allowance favoring the
flight engineer), then, at five dollars per
aircraft-pound, this would cost $1,000 per
airplane-month, or a total of $70,000 per
airplane-year.
Then consider the initial cost of an
automatic system to be $1,000 per air-
plane, and neglect the maintenance cost.
The airplane earns about $300 per hour,
or $1,080,000 per airplane-year. If the
life of an airplane is six years, and the
initial soct is $400,000, a 0.25 percent in-
crease in initial cost gives an added in-
come of $425,000 for the life of the
plane, or 6.5 percent increase in earning
capacity. (The preceding figures were
graciously supplied by United Air Lines
and American Airlines.)
The principle items in the cost of an
automatic system will be: 1. Research,
consisting mainly of dependability tests,
finding elements sensitive to power plant
(Continued from page 26)
variables, and servo mechanisms; 2.
Design and adaptation of the unit to the
power plant; 3. Tooling.
While on this point, it is interesting
to note that, although airlines had ap-
proximately 360 airplanes on order at the
end of 1947, these airplanes required
about 1,000 engines, excluding spares.
This, together with the nature of engine
production (i.e., increasing the power out-
put of an engine without making basic
changes in engine size, etc.) allows the
design to take advantage of quantity pro-
duction methods.
Savings that can be attained through
power "egg" engine installations are of
two forms. First, more efficient engine
inspection and repair; and second, reduc-
tion of the number of idle aircraft and
time an airplane is idle.
It is easy to visualize the increased
efficiency of maintainance with power egg
installation. Consider a conventional air-
plane requiring engine work: for a con-
ventional installation, precarious plat-
forms, perhaps as high as 30 feet, are
wheeled up, with great care being taken
not to damage the propeller or plane
skin. If the weather is bad, a canvas
tent is hung over the nacelle. The cowl-
ing is removed. The mechanic goes back
to his bench to get a necessary tool.
Finally, he starts working on the engine
by making educated guesses as to which
of a dozen or so items is causing the
power failure of which the pilot com-
plained. Contrast this with the mainte-
nance procedure for the power egg in-
stallation: 1. Crane is hooked to engine;
2. Four to six bolts loosened; 3. One or
two cannon plugs disconnected; 4. A
"quick-disconnect" fuel line is broken;
5. The power plant control line (may
be mechanical, hydraulic or electrical) is
disconnected; 6. Air ducts are unzipped.
When this is done, the egg is removed
and a new one put in its place. The
whole procedure can be done probably in
one or two man-hours. By the time the
first engine is in the shop, the second
is being run up, and the airplane is ready
to roll.
As for the replaced engine, it is placed
on an overhead conveyor. If overhaul is
required the engine is systematically dis-
assembled in the reverse order of its
assembly at the factory. Each part is
carefully inspected with the proper in-
struments, etc., and replaced if necessary.
Then, the engine is re-assembled, thor-
oughly tested, and put back into service.
If some minor repairs are required, the
malfunctions of components are detected
with convenient built-in test equipment,
and the components replaced. The engine
is then placed back into service and the
components may be factory-serviced or
repaired on the spot.
Ground-controlled flight for commer-
cial aircraft has not yet been fully evalu-
ated with reference to its usefulness. GCA
has, by virtue of its record in military
operations, proved its superiority over the
pilot. If the future of commercial opera-
tions requires a dispatcher to control the
position of aircraft by watching indicator
lights on a large panel (as in railroad
practice), the dispatcher might benefit by
having the complete and simple control
over aircraft speed afforded by automatic
power plant control.
Webster defines engineering as "...
the art and science by which . . . the
sources of power in Nature are made
(more) useful to man." In the light
of the preceding paragraphs, it is appar-
ent that the aircraft designer is challenged
by the internal combustion engine to
make . . . "the sources of power in
Nature . . . (more) useful ..." Auto-
matic power plant control provides the
designer with a powerful weapon in his
everlasting struggle to make the most
efficient utilization of Nature's gifts. His
reward is two-fold: one, the priceless
satisfaction of having done a good job;
and two, the creation of a product which
will allow the airlines to achieve new
standards of safety and efficiency.

There's something here
no photograph could show
Pictures could convey a clear idea of the
buildings of Standard Oil's new research
laboratory at Whiting, Indiana. We
could also photograph the many new
types of equipment for up-to-date pe-
troleum research that are housed in the
laboratory, one of the largest projects
of its kind in the world.
Or we could photograph the men who
work here, many of whom have out-
standing reputations in their fields. For
many years, Standard Oil has looked
for and has welcomed researchers and
engineers of high professional compe-
tence. We have created an intellectual
climate which stimulates these men to
do their finest work.
But no photograph could show the
basic idea that motivates Standard Oil
research. It is simply this: our respon-
sibility to the public and to ourselves
makes it imperative that we keep mov-
ing steadily forward. The new Whiting
laboratory is but one evidence of Stand-
ard Oil's intention to remain in the front
rank of industrial research.

Norton Chairman of the Board George N. Jeppson pays tribute to the work of
development engineers Wallace L. Howe (left) and Edward Van der Pyl (right)
for their work in solving countless problems in building and equipping the world's
largest grinding wheel plant
New Era in Grinding Wheel Manufacture
A revolutionary new process in the manufacture of grinding wheels
is being carried out in the recently dedicated Norton Plant 7, the
largest of the eighty-six buildings that stretch for a distance of one
and one-half miles in the Greendale section of Worcester.
In this new Norton plant, with floor space of approximately five acres,
grinding wheels are being made at a speed and with a uniformity never
before known in the abrasive world.
Abrasive grain and bond, brought in one end of this six hundred
and two foot building by a modern conveyor system, moves down
the line for various processes, through continuous electric kilns, to
finally emerge at the shipping end ready for service in the industrial
world.
The new process envisioned through the more than half century
experience of George N. Jeppson and the mammoth new building
to house it have become realities by the co-operation of Norton engi-
neers—chemical, ceramic, mechanical, electrical, architectural, civil.

will be needed? It is estimated that the
normal future demand of the steel indus-
try will be around 80,000,000 tons of ore
annually. Of this, roughly 65,000,000 tons
must be supplied by the Lake Superior dis-
trict, with about 45,000,000 tons coming
from open-pit mines. When the open pits
no longer produce, the steel industry will
have to get this tonnage elsewhere—and
get it soon.
Just what are the possibilities of obtain-
ing iron ore in the future? The rich iron
ore in the deposits of the Central Mesabi
Range is called hematite. Originally, it
was taconite, a hard, iron-bearing rock.
Geologic ages ago, movements within the
earth caused this rock to crack open, al-
lowing water to enter. This water leached
away most of the silica from the taconite,
leaving a relatively pure substance, which
is principally iron oxide. Now that the
once-plentiful supply of this hematite is
dwindling, is there some means by which
the enormous reserve of taconite in the
Lake Superior region can be processed to
obtain hematite?
It can be done. Iron-mining and steel
companies have spent huge sums of money
for research to develop such processes. It
has been established that such iron recov-
ery will be expensive. To get a ton of blast
furnace feed, three tons of iron-bearing
taconite rock will have to be mined. Then,
this will have to be hauled to the concen-
trating plant, and the iron separated from
the silica. The job of producing the 45,-
000,000 annual tons needed to make up
for the exhausting resources of the open-
pit mines by this process is a staggering
one. Yet, two iron-mining companies al-
ready have begun concentrating magnetic
taconite. Meanwhile, other iron companies
doubtlessly will begin taconite processing.
Furthermore, other factors are tending to
promote a steady supply-and-demand situ-
ation in iron ore. An increase in produc-
tion of ore in under-ground mines is now
being carried on in Minnesota. Production
of ore from long-neglected iron deposits
in New York's Adirondacks has increased
in the last several years. Also, the steel
industry can reach out further to the
Labrador hematite field.
There is, then, plenty of iron. The task
of recovering it by new methods may cos!
a billion dollars, but the steel industry is
already accepting that challenge. Even
as the Mesabi's hematite supply is dwind-
ling, preparation for exploiting new sour-
ces are keeping pace with this depletion.

"TOOK AT THIS, Mr. Irvin!" said Joe
-»-* the salesman as he whisked a short
length of glass pipe out of his briefcase.
"This is one reason why our food prod-
ucts are pure and clean. Right up to final
inspection, they flow through Pyrex glass
piping. We can see them all the time!
"We can keep the pipes clean easily with-
out taking them down. And when they're
clean, we can see they're clean. And what's
more, food and fruit acids don't attack glass,
so there's no danger of spoiling the taste!"
Glass pipe to guard the purity and quality
of your product is only one of37,000 things
we make at Corning Class Works.
We make the glass bowls for five best-
selling coffee makers. We know the answers
to a lot of questions about television because
Corning has been making the glass parts
for television from the start. And if you
sold housewares, we could help you attract
new customers with our Pyrex Flameware
Double Boiler, made of the first glass ever
specially developed to stand die extra shock
of top-of-stove cooking.
In nearly a hundred years we've found
ways to make 50,000 different kinds of
glass. Some of them may someday help you
improve production or cut costs. Others
may suggest ways to make your product
more desirable or useful to the people who
buy it. Remember us when that day comes.

Is a cable covering flameproof? Will it resist high tem-
peratures when it comes to actual service?
Long before a cable is manufactured, questions like
these are answered in the Okonite laboratories, proving
ground and in various testing departments of the
Okonite plants. The picture above shows a flame test.
The measured current that makes the coils glow makes it
possible to reproduce test after test without variation.

A man sought medical aid because he had popped eyes and a
ringing in the ears. A doctor looked him over and suggested
removal of his tonsils. The operation resulted in no improvement,
so the patient consulted another doctor who suggested removal
of his teeth. The teeth were extracted, but still the man's eyes
popped and the ringing in his ears continued.
A third doctor told him bluntly, "You've got 6 months to
live." In that event, the doomed man decided he'd treat himself
right while he could. He bought a flashy car, hired a liveried
chauffeur, had the best tailor in town to make him 30 suits, and
decided even his shirts would be made to order.
"O'kay," said the shirtmaker, "let's get your measurement.
Hmmm, 34 sleeve, 16 collar—"
"Fifteen," the man said.
"Sixteen collar," the shirtmaker repeated, measuring again.
"But I've always worn a 15 collar," said the man.
"Listen," the shirtmaker said, "I'm warning you. You keep
on wearing a 15 collar and your eyes will pop and you'll have a
ringing in your ears."

the life of materials, and similar activities.
A small saving in one part is multiplied
many times on the system, becoming a
large saving, year after year, for the
whole. Since this local distribution sys-
tem is responsible for about one-third of
the total system investment, there are
always real opportunities here for good
engineering.
One of the current problems in dis-
tribution materials is that of suitable and
adequate preservative treatment of poles,
crossarms, and other timber used in line
construction, to prevent decay. High
prices for material and labor, together
with a developing scarcity of timber re-
sources, points to the necessity for treat-
ing all wood parts to obtain as long a
service life as possible. Creosote treat-
ment for poles is well tried and effec-
tive. A new preservative, pentachloro-
phenol, gives much promise of being
satisfactory and somewhat cleaner than
creosote for full length treatment of
poles, crossarms, and other parts ex-
posed to frequent handling. Techniques
for its application are still in the process
(Continued from page 16)
of development. Other preservatives are
continually being proposed, and it is ad-
visable for the distribution engineer to
keep in touch with this subject.
Overhead wires in urban territory have
been mostly of copper with a "weather-
proof" covering of cotton braid saturated
with asphalt. In recent years, improved
coverings with considerably more insulat-
ing value have been developed. These
make marked reduction in service inter-
ruptions due to wires burned down by
tree branches or other foreign material
across them. The Detroit Edison Company
has pioneered in the use of such wire
for a number of years, and has about 15
percent of its covered primaries of such
construction. Neoprene-covered wire is
one of the newer developments in the
field, although it is more or less experi-
mental at this writing. Other synthetic
materials are proposed or being tried, and
further developments may be expected.
Tree contacts of various kinds are
responsible for something over half of
the line trouble on overhead lines. In
addition to the improved wire covering
mentioned above, experimental installa-
tions of aerial cable are being made in
some lines in Detroit where the tree
hazard is bad. The type used consists of
three rubber-insulated conductors, each
covered by a bronze shielding tape, bound
together to a copperweld messenger by
means of a copper-binding strap. Such
cable is also being tried in congested alley
locations together with a new type of
steel cage transformer rack mounting,
making a completely metal-enclosed in-
stallation for all conductors and equip-
ment.
Many more examples could be given
of the engineering problems and devel-
opments which are going forward as the
power load grows and the system for
supplying it expands. As yet, there is no
limit in sight for such growth, nor for the
interesting problems which it occasions.
The power industry is still young and
vigorous, and will continue to be so as
long as American ingenuity continues to
devise more ways of making electricity
do the numerous and difficult jobs in the
home and factory.

Fastener Economy means making sure that every func-
tion involved in the use of bolts, nuts, screws, rivets and
other fasteners contributes to the desired fastening re-
sult — maximum holding power at the lowest possible
total cost for fastening.

METALLURGICAL ENGINEERING
The use of X-rays in chemical and metallurgical
engineering is steadily increasing because they
supplement and extend the present tools used as
chemical analysis and the metallographic micro-
scope. The two samples of X-ray diffraction appara-
tus shown will furnish information about the
chemical composition of a sample by the lattice
parameters of its constituents, (and even show which
crystallographic modifications are present of a cer-
tain compound).
X-ray diffraction diagrams of metal samples give
information regarding phases present, the strains
existing, and the mechanism of precipitation and
age hardening processes.
X-ray radiography reveals internal flaws in cast-
ings and welds and thus has become an important
tool of inspection.
CHEMICAL ENGINEERING
The tremendous wartime plants making butadiene for syn-
thetic rubber, iso-octane for aviation fuels, phenol for plas-
tics and a host of other materials, must purify their products.
A most common method is distillation; the rectifying column
in which this is done is frequently the heart of the plant.
The chemical engineer uses the laboratory distilling col-
umn shown to study this operation. He learns it as a Unit
Operation, and can apply the principle to any industry re-
quiring it. The accompanying problems of supplying heat
and condensing vapor are also studied as generally usable
operations. This training in fundamental operations fits the
Chemical Engineer for industries where similar operations
are combined into a wide variety of manufacturing pro-
cesses.

Once again we find ourselves at the be-
ginning of a new school year. To some
it is a new experience on the road of
life; to others, it is a continuation of a
youthful ambition; and to a few who
have had the determination and the
strength of mind and body to succeed, it
represents the rewards of fruitful years of
labor. As such, it is advisable for all of
us, educators and students, to pause for a
moment and consider our obligations and
responsibilities.

eers." These were the sentiments ex-
pressed by the late Dean Cooley, a man
admired and respected by those who knew
him and worked with him. We are not
so naive as to expect all educators to be
proponents of the philosophy established
and practiced by Dean Cooley but we do
believe it might be a goal to be sought
for by every individual who honestly and
sincerely deserves the title "professor."
We are cognizant of the problems under-
lying our present system of mass educa-
tion. We realize that classes are crowded,
that time is limited, that the scope of sub-
ject material has been widened, that per-
sonal contact between student and teacher
is, of necessity, limited to a certain degree.
However, these cannot be considered as
legitimate replies to mediocre instruction,
lack of course preparation, and the un-
bridged gap that exists at the present
between professor and student.
By accepting leadership in the field of
professional education you have assigned
yourselves a dual responsibility: legal
and moral. The legal responsibility,
which constitutes an infinitely small part
of your obligation, terminates with the
dismissal of classes and perhaps some
personal attention to those students in
need of it. This, by common law, you
are required to fulfill, since you are be-
ing reimbursed financially for your ser-
vices.
From a moral standpoint you are bound
in your own conscience—or you should
be—to do the utmost in helping the
student achieve the height of his ambi-
tion. The ideas and concepts which you
convey to the students, concerning engin-
eering problems or some philosophy of
life, are stepping stones to the sound
foundation most engineering students are
attempting to build. As such, your guid-
ance affects not only the present but also
the future. A word of hope, a word of
encouragement, may be repaid a hundred-
fold in the years to come. As professors,
part of your professional accomplishment
comes to you in the way of a realization
that you have done a good job, that you
have taught the young engineer as much
as is humanly possible, and are confident
that, as young men, they may take their
places in society with the leaders of their
profession.
The young men you are teaching to-
day will become the leaders of future
generations. You undoubtedly will be re-
placed by some of them. The leaders of
industry, be they technical or administra-
tive, do not have a lease on life. The
leaders of our nation can undergo the
trials of our somewhat chaotic and com-
plex world to a limited extent. Since the
young men before you will, of necessity,
accept some of the responsibility of the
future, you will directly share in their
success or failure. If the generation of
the future fails, you also will have failed
miserably.
As a final though we once again refer
to the words of Dean Cooley: "I spoke
to them from my heart. God pity the
educator who develops the reputation as
a wit at the expense of his students, and
God pity the one who does not know that
in the heart of every young man there
is plenty of room for real sentiment."
•Students: As students attending one
of the leading universities of the nation,
we also have our responsibilities and ob-
ligations. We certainly should not pass
through like goats to the slaughter: look-
ing forward but seeing only the rear of
the man ahead of us. We have within our
grasp opportunities which the sages of
old were able only to vaguely dream
about. The age has come upon us when
these dreams can be realities. It is for us
to make them so. The age-old aim to
help make this world a better place to
live in can now take on real meaning, and
presents us with a real challenge. How
can we help alleviate human want and
suffering? What can we do to eliminate
some of the dangers and hazards en-
countered in a great many of our indus-
tries? How can this nation's vast re-
sources be used to the furthering of
mankind—morally, mentally, and physic-
ally? These are questions that we might
give just a little of the thought and time
that we now spend in attempting to get
a copy of last semester's examination.
Many of us will probably say that these
things cannot be learned from text books.
Quite true. However, how many of us
have taken the pains to explore the op-
portunities that our university presents
for direct personal contact with leaders
in our respective professions and thereby
gain by their experiences and vast store
of knowledge. The acquisition of an all-
A record, although a very commendable
achievement, is not an end in itself, nor

does it distinguish the ignorant from the
educated.
Education is much broader than merely
so many words between two covers. The
story comes to mind of the Engineering
Mechanics major, with an all-A record,
who was asked to buy some nails with
which to assemble a rather simple struc-
ture made from two-by-four lumber. With
a complete knowledge of stress analysis
and beam deflection at his finger tips,
the bewildered student purchased some
six-penny nails with which to assemble
the structure. And he couldn't quite fig-
ure out just why the nails were of little
value. One would indeed think very
little of this incident if it befell anyone
other than an engineering student; how-
ever we are speaking of future "engin-
eers." We certainly cannot expect the
professor teaching "Strength of Ma-
terials" to bring a hammer and a pack-
age of nails to class and teach us how
to pound nails. We are given credit for
having a little more native intelligence
and "know how" than this. This is only
an example, and to many, perhaps, it
sounds exaggerated. However, an inspec-
tion tour into any of our many labora-
tories will show the complete lack of
mechanical ability displayed by our fu-
ture engineers. Perhaps it is lack of in-
terest, or perhaps only an "I don't give a
darn" attitude. But, as long as such
a condition is tolerated, too many of us
will continue to be just goats.
The engineering societies in our col-
lege offer us a wonderful opportunity to
display our leadership ability, and above
all afford us the ocassion to meet some
of our professors and fellow-students out-
side of the classroom. At the present
time all the engineering societies are in
need of ambitious, energetic young men
who are willing to accept the responsibil-
ity and carry out the plans of the various
organizations. The apathetic attitude
among our students on the Michigan
campus has rightfully labelled us as "slip-
stick-toting book-worms." Needless to say
this lack of interest leaves much to be
desired.
How many times have you heard the
statement: "Most profs don't even know
the names of the students in class." This
perhaps is one of the evils that is inher-
ent in our mass-education program. Not
to condone the attitude of the few pro-
fessors on the matter, but how many of
us students have made an honest attempt
to get acquainted with our professors? We
might think of the old adage, "If Mo-
hammed won't come to the mountain,
then the mountain will come to Mo-
hammed." If we at least attempt to make
an honest and sincere effort at better fel-
lowship with our professors, time is
bound to bring results. At least they, as
faculty members, will know that their
interest is desired.
From a purely selfish standpoint, for
our own sakes and for the higher ideal
of the good of society, we might devote
a little thought to how we can wake up
and dispel this lethargy. If we are to
take our rightful part in society let us at
least give these men a chance to teach
us what they know. Education is at least
a 50-50 basis. One teaches; the other
learns. All the professors in the world
cannot "learn" us a single iota.

After the fire, what can he tell THEM...?
NATURALLY THE OWNER IS THE
BIG LOSER when his business burns.
But ir people have trusted him and
have left managerial judgment up
to him, he will find that he has to
answer not only to himself but to a
whole community if he has been lax
about fire control.
For instance, what can he say to the
fire chief, one of whose men was
seriously injured in the fire? He has
been warned repeatedly that, al-
though buildings may be fireproof,
the contents may be virtually tinder.
How would he answer his cashier
who has told him time and again
that an indemnity check will not
cover re-building costs at today's
advanced prices? Or that statisti-
cally 2 out of 5 businesses with
records destroyed by fire never get
started again.
How would he explain to the skilled
men who have helped him build his
business and now must, for their
families' sakes, go elsewhere and get
established again?
THERE IS ONLY ONE ANSWER:
He must be prepared for fire before
it strikes. He can never hope to pre-
vent fire from starting. But he can
be prepared to prevent fire from
causing material damage. He can
successfully control fire, whenever
and wherever it strikes, night or day,
without fail, through Grinnell Pro-
tection by automatic sprinklers.
Competent authorities will attest
that Grinnell Protection by auto-
matic sprinklers is the surest way.
In addition, Grinnell Protection
usually pays for itself in reduced
insurance premiums in a few years.
So, if his property is insured, he is
paying for Grinnell Protection. . . .

PLATED WITH PURE GOLD...
developed by American Steel and Wire Company
Tenor banjo and tenor guitar players have long
been plagued by unsatisfactory "A" or first
strings. This string, when properly tuned, is
under such high strain that most wires barely
reach pitch. At the request of the Mapes Piano
String Company, the Metallurgical Department
of the Worcester Works of the American Steel
and Wire Company, a subsidiary of United
States Steel, created, after months of research, a
wire specifically for this purpose. This new wire
is made so strong that it possesses more than
twice the tensile strength, in pounds per square
inch, of cross sectional area, of the steel wire

which American Steel and Wire spun into cables
to suspend the 8V4 mile bridge across San Fran-
cisco Bay from San Francisco to Oakland, Cali-
fornia. This makes the new string the strongest
wire of its size of any kind known today.
This high quality super tensile wire is pro-
duced by a special combination of heat treat-
ments and exceptionally long and exacting cold
working. The result is a wire of 0.010 gauge with
a tensile strength of approximately 460,000
pounds per square inch. One pound of this wire
extends 3749 feet, or sufficient footage to pass
from nut to bridge on approximately 1500banjos
or guitars. This unusual wire is then plated with
pure gold in order to prevent rust and to impart
beautiful appearance.
Opportunities
This wire development is typical of the work
being done in United States Steel Laboratories.
But such research is only one kind of develop-
ment to be found within the United States Steel
industrial family.
United States Steel
and the steel indus-
try are famous for
development of men.

Here you see the Navy-Douglas D55H Skystreak—a dramatic demonstration of the structural advantage of
magnesium. Strong magnesium alloy sheet is literally "wrapped" around the Sky-streak's powerful jet engine
to form the entire fuselage skin aft of the pilot seat. This makes possible a monocoque structure which com-
pletely eliminates the usual stringers, except for frames carrying concentrated loads.
However, this is onlv one use of magnesium. It is also used for hinoculars, typewriters, pruning shears—in fact,
wherever flexible design properties as well as lightness and strength are desired, magnesium should be considered.
Dow produces, in addition to magnesium and plastics, more than five hundred
essential chemicals from plants strategically located in Michigan, Texas and „...
California. Among these are pharmaceutical chemicals such as chloroform,
iodine and aspirin; also insecticides like Dowklor and DDT, which aid greatly
in increased agricultural production. Dowtherm, the liquid heat transfer medium
for use in processing plants, is another of Dow's products, as is Methoccl, which
is used in many industries as a binder, thickener, and dispersing and emulsifying
agent.
This, in brief, is some indication of how Dow serves agriculture, as well as
industry and the public welfare in general; helping to maintain and raise still
higher, the American standard of living.

It has long been recognized that re-
irch is as important an activity in the
scheme of a really progressive company
or corporation as are the functions of
production or sales. Research is perhaps
more important because were it not for
constant inquiry into new and better ways
of doing things, a company would soon
hopelessly fall behind its competitors.
Oftentimes, in the search for a new
method, or investigation of an old one,
the resulting research may uncpver meth-
ods and processes which find application
in many fields entirely unrelated to the
original problem.
As industries came to realize the truth
of the above statements, they foresaw
immediately the assistance that univer-
sities and colleges could render in aiding
them in their research programs. Facili-
ties for education easily adaptable to
probing the problems of industry, were
readily available, and it was evident that
some problems required the attentions of
a group, rather than a single individual.
Universities were ideally set up for this
purpose.
In Michigan, the first manifestation of
the above line of reasoning came about
in February of 1919, when a committee
representing the Association of Michigan
Manufacturers approached the Board of
Regents of the University of Michigan
and proposed the setting up of some sort
of working agreement between the Uni-
versity and the Association, with a view
to cooperation in research. The Regents
looked upon the idea favorably, and ap-
pointed a committee consisting of Presi-
dent Hutchins as chairman, and Professors
Hanslett, Leland, Clements, Cooley, and
Enswiler to investigate cooperation be-
tween the University of Michigan and
the industries of the state for the pur-
pose of furthering technical and scientific
research. It was felt by the committee
that the benefits from such a program
would aid the University, the industries
of the state, and the people alike, and ac-
cordingly, the committee recommended
the establishment of a so-called Engineer-
ing Research Department, at the Univer-
sity.

A Triangle man and an A.S.C.E. mem-
ber, Rog hails from Milwaukee via the
United States Army. He is a Senior Civil
with a major in Traffic Engineering, and
his plans thus far include graduate work
at Yale. Rog and Bob Paul collaborated
on this article which also serves to intro-
duce a new Feature on Engineering Re-
search. This Feature will appear monthly
in the Technic.
The Regents then took definite action
in January, 1920, and created the machin-
ery for the establishment of such a de-
partment, and the following October
relieved Prof. Albert E. White of his
teaching duties and placed him in the
newly-created office of Director of Engi-
needing Research. A list of 100 manu-
facturers was selected at this time by the
Association of Michigan Manufacturers
to act as an advisory board. The original
funds were also approved at this time.
The operation of the Engineering Re-
search Department is such as to give the
sponsoring industry a free hand in de-
ciding what problem is to be studied. An
industry that wishes to make use of the
service contracts with the University to
perform any research which the company
desires and the University is agreed to.
The University is reimbursed for all
equipment and materials used in the
process plus a small percentage based on
the total cost of the undertaking. A
research project may be initiated by either
letter or personal interview, and progress
reports are published as requested by the
sponsoring concern. The service is no
longer limited to state industries only;
any company in the United States may
benefit from the service.
The University also maintains a pub-
lication service especially designed to
publish the results of research undertaken.
This is done only when agreed upon by
both the sponsoring concern and the Uni-
versity and when the research findings
are of such nature as to merit their gen-
eral circulation.
Within five years after its conception,
the Engineering Research Department had
produced many products and processes
of a patentable nature, and a need for a
definite patent policy was made increas-
ingly known. In 1925, such a policy
was put into effect. If, during the course
of a research project, anything that ap-
pears to be patentable is developed, such
fact is immediately made known to the
sponsor of the project. He has 60 days
in which to review the discovery and
decide whether or not he wishes to make
application for a patent, at his expense.
He has two alternatives in applying for
the patent: he may have the patent as-
signed to himself, after agreeing to re-
imburse the University after the patent is
granted, or he may elect to have the
patent placed with a trust company to be
administered under a contract approved
by the Regents of the University. If the
sponsor has no desire to do either, the
University then has the option of ap-
plying for control of the patent rights at
no expense to the sponsor. In the event
that the University does not wish to ap-
ply, the inventor himself, subject to the
approval of the University, may secure a
patent. In either of the above two cases,
the sponsor of the project enjoys full
shop rights without the payment of any
fee.
Some idea of the growth of research
following the new patent policy will be
gained when we look at the appropria-
tions of the years of 1925 and 1930.

by
WILLIAM H. HOBBS, Professor Emeritus of Geology
In 1945 the Congress of the United
States by resolution called upon a Com-
mittee of Engineers to make a two-year
study of how to increase the capacity and
the security of the Isthmian canal. After
considering thirty-one possible canal sites,
the Committee has recommended that
the present Panama Canal be converted to
a sea-level one. This project which will
require probably ten years for construc-
tion at an estimated cost of three and a
half billion dollars, was presented for
discussion by the American Society of
Civil Engineers in April, 1948. The sub-
joined article is a reprint of a contribu-
tion to that discussion and it appears in
the Proceedings of the Society for the
year, 1948.
A possible sea-level, ship canal across
the Tehuantepec Isthmus of Mexico does
not appear to have been very seriously
considered in these studies, inasmuch as
attention was given to that along the cir-
cuitous route proposed for a canal by
R. W. Schufeldt, a captain in the United
States Navy in 1870. This was for a
lock canal which would have been 165
miles long (see route in Fig. 1). The
Isthmus of Tehuantepec offers the best
possible location for an inter-ocean, com-
bined open ditch and tunnel ship canal at
sea level, which could be made largely
secure from successful attack.
In contrast to a canal which would fol-
low the Schufeldt route, the Tehuantepec
canal herein proposed would be on a
direct line from Puerto, Mexico, the
Atlantic Terminus, almost due south to
the Lower Lagoon on the Pacific front
(see Fig. 2). Its length is thus reduced
from 165 statute miles to 126 miles, and
of this distance one half, or 63 miles, is
across a featureless plain generally less
than 50 ft. above the sea. The subsur-
face rocks of this plain are soft Tertiary
sediments which would be easily exca-
vated by power shovel or bulldozer.
It is proposed to pierce the central
hardrock mountain, which is the back-
bone of the isthmus, by a tunnel 63 miles
in length. By reason of seven construc-
tional and ventilating shafts, it is, in
reality, a continuous succession of eight
tunnels between its two portals. The

PROF. HOBBS
Professor Hobbs has reached a position
of great eminence in the field of geology
since his appointment to the Geology De-
partment of the University of Michigan
in 1906.
In 1931 the Research Club presented its
greatest distinction to Professor Hobbs:
the Award of the Russell Lectureship. This
award goes each year to the professor
whose attainments in original investiga-
tion have been especially significant.
Many of Professor Hobbs' contempor-
aries have honored him. Five glaciers,
three in the Atlantic and two in Green-
land, bear his name. A mountain in Utah,
as well as a Cape in MacRobertson Land
will serve to perpetuate the name of Pro-
fesor Hobbs as a famed geologist and
explorer.
longest of these tunnels would be 14
miles, with five tunnels each less than 8
miles. The tunnel cross -section would
have a maximum height, which gives a
cross-section of 2,222 sq. yd. (see Fig.
3). This should accommodate the larg-
est proposed battleships and "flattops,"
and the present trend is toward increased
length, rather than beam, in the interest
of greater speed of both types and of
longer runways on aircraft carriers. The
very largest ships may find it necessary
to provide a knee joint in their lofty
radar masts for partial lowering when
making the passage through the canal.
From the proposed constructional shafts
of the tunnel, each only a few hundred
feet in depth, conveniently located can-
yons will permit the building of railways,
all with down-grades to the open ditch
sections of the canal, so the excavated
rock can be dumped to form high riprap
walls on both sides of the open ditch,
and to build harbor moles in addition.
This should protect the ditch from all but
direct bomb hits. For the tunnel itself
protection is complete, provided that the
portals are of thick, heavily reinforced
concrete. Behavior of the German sub-
marine pens so constructed proved them
to be almost indestructible, both during
World War II and after it as well.
To the east of three of the shifts (the
third, fifth, and sixth counting from the
north in Fig. 1), the dams erected in
canyons would provide large reservoirs
which, if combined with hydroelectric
plants, would furnish power for the oper-
ation of the hoists and railway, as well
as for electrification of the tunnel. These
reservoirs would provide water supply
for the workmen's villages high above the
unhealthy lowlands.
Three or more tunnel sidings, each two
miles in length would permit uninter-
rupted two-way traffic through the tun-
nel, and would also afford protection for
the fleet if the canal were to be under
attack from the air in wartime. The
seven shafts of the tunnel would permit
its construction, simultaneously, in two
directions from each shaft, and in one
direction from each portal. This would
reduce, considerably, the time required
to complete it, which is especially im-
portant in the event of an early national
emergency.
The open sections of the canal should
be separated into two waterways, each
for one-way traffic. Excavation should
thus be greatly reduced and danger of
collisions within a single narrow chan-
nel be obviated. Two ditches, each 175
feet wide, would serve as much traffic as
a single ditch very much wider than the
combined breadth of the two. Intercom-
municating passages would maintain the
normal surface level of the water when
disturbed by the bow waves of the mov-
ing vessels. The riprap wall separating
the two waterways would make it less

likely that both would be put out of
commission by a single bomb hit.
The advantages of this proposed
Tehuantepec canal over that recommend-
ed for conversion of the Panama Canal
to sea level, are many and convincing.
They are as follows:
1. The Panama project would provide
only a single inter-ocean canal, as it does
at present. The Tehuantepec project pro-
vides two, which are more than 1,000
miles apart.
2. During the period of construction
(possibly as much as ten years) the Pan-
ama Canal, in the case of the Tehuante-
pec project, would continue to be in
unobstructed use.
3. Throughout its length the Tehuan-
tepec canal would be almost invulnerable
to attack, the tunnel section completely
so. The converted Panama Canal would
be insecure under attack and the studies
have indicated that, if blocked, it would
require weeks to re-open it. The portals
of the proposed tunnel at Tehuantepec, if
constructed of heavily reinforced concrete
(as were the German submarine pens
during World War II), would be almost
completely indestructible.
4. In time of war with menace from
both ocean fronts, the fleet, when at the
canal, could have a fully protected two-
ocean base from which to move to either
front as might be required. Such pro-
tection for a fleet would be quite unique
anywhere in the world.
5. The proposed Tehuantepec canal
would cut 3,000 miles of sea lanes from
the Panama route between the naval base
at Norfolk, Virginia, and the San Diego
(California) or Pearl Harbor (Hawaii)
bases; and equal reductions would be se-
cured for commercial sea travel between

to the Tehuantepec canal could be guard-
ed on the Atlantic front by air patrols
and by radar operated from airfields at
Brownsville, and Houston, Texas, New
Orleans, Louisiana, Pensacola and Miami,
Florida, Guantanamo, Cuba, and Yuca-

thus guarded. The recent, enforced
withdrawal of air outposts from Pana-
manian territory, and the 1948 uprisings
at Bogota, Columbia, only 500 miles
from the Panama Canal, demonstrated
only too clearly the insecurity of the
Canal Zone.

The increase in the size of the Depart-
ment of Naval Architecture and Marine
Engineering was never more evident
than at the open meeting of the Quarter-
deck Society held at the Union on Sep-
tember 27. More than 50 people crowded
into the room to hear the welcoming ad-
dress of Professor L. A. Baier, head of
the department. Professor Spooner of the
department also delivered a short speech.
Twenty-eight men have become proba-
tionary members of the Society. Proba-
tionary members are required to submit a
2,000-word paper on some phase of naval
architecture or marine engineering, not
covered by the curriculum, before they
will be accepted as full members.
Officers of the Society for this year are:
Klemme Jones, Commodore, Diky Broad,
Vice Commodore, Robert Miller, Steward,
Alan McCIure, Purser, Ray Pearlson, Pro-
gram Chairman, and Robert Wernick,
Membership Chairman.
The primary purpose of the Society is
to provide an opportunity for, and to en-
courage members of the Society to give
and hear papers on topics of interest to
the members. Programs of the meetings
this semester will be designed for greater
student participation. Discussions of
small boat design, operation, and main-
tenance will be a feature of many of the
programs. The annual trip to a boat or
shipyard in the vicinity will be continued
this year.
ASHVE
An election of officers was the first
order of business at the meeting of the
American Society of Heating and Venti-
lating Engineers held on the 29th of
September. Alan Astrove was elected
president, Milton Karafils was elected
vice-president, and Ben Briskin was
elected secretary-treasurer. Stanley Jus-
wiak was selected to be the Engineering
Council representative.
Since this organization is comparatively
new on campus, the aims of the society
merit consideration. The A.S.H.V.E. pur-
poses to: (1) bring together all students

interested in the field of heating, refrig-
eration, and air-conditioning; (2) pre-
sent a program which will aid the stu-
dent in selecting a field of concentration.
The future plans of the organization
provide for discussions led by guest
speakers and many interesting field trips.
AIEE-IRE
This year, as before, the monthly meet-
ings of the A.I.E.E.-I.R.E. student branch
will give the entire membership an op-
portunity to investigate some of the many
and varied fields open to an electrical
engineer.
Our first meeting of the academic year
was held October 6, at which time Dr.
James T. Wilson discussed, "Applications
of Electrical Engineering to Geophysical
Prospecting for Mineral Resources."
On October 27, Mr. R. R. Barnes of
the Michigan Bell Telephone Company
spoke to us about "The Transistor" and
"Bell System Transmission of Televi-
sion by Wire and Microwave." There was
also a microwave demonstration.
All persons who are interested are
urged to join the organization and attend
our meetings.
Now is the time to begin preparations
for your entry in the student paper con-
test. Your choice of subjects is as broad
as the field of Electrical Engineering, and
a cash prize goes to the person who writes
the best paper. Complete information is
available in the A.I.E.E.-I.R.E. offices,
2514 East Engineering.
AlChE
Professor Emeritus W. H. Hobbs of
the Geology Department was the guest
speaker at the first monthly meeting of
the student chapter of the American In-
stitute of Chemical Engineers. Professor
Hobbs discussed the possibilities of the
development of the Arctic regions, and
directed attention to the many unclaimed
natural resources in Greenland.
A tentative program for the following
year was presented to the organization.
Second vice-president, Tom Heins; treas-
urer, Walt Peterson, and plant-trip com-
mittee chairman, Donald Kory, discussed
the future plans, which include provisions
for many guest speakers and various plant
trips. A national convention will be held
in New York, and in the Spring of the
year the A.I.ChE. will present its annual
banquet.
After John Whitcombe was elected to
fill the vacancy of the office of the first
vice-president, the date of the first series
of plant trips was announced. The E. I.
Dupont Corporation and the Sharpless
Chemical Corporation will open their
doors to the student members of the
A.I.Ch.E.
ASCE
The student chapter of ASCE has con-
tinued this semester its policy of present-
ing speakers from various fields of civil
engineering at its meetings. The opening
meeting of the semester featured Mr. Mc-
Namee of Drury, McNamee and Porter,
an Ann Arbor consultant engineering
firm. Mr. McNamee spoke on the scope
of the consulting engineer's work. Special
emphasis was placed on the subject of
ethics.
The officers of the student chapter:
Arthur Plant, president, Bruce Davidson,
treasurer, and LeRoy Weinstein, secre-
tary, attended a meeting of the Michigan
Section of ASCE on September 29. The
president of ASCE, Mr. R. E. Dougherty,
spoke on the future of transportation.
Student officers from Wayne, University
of Detroit, and Michigan State College
also attended. After the meeting the stu-
dent officers discussed plans for the com-
ing year. Each of the student chapters
expressed a desire to incorporate some
of the ideas of the others.
ASME
Three smoke-filled rooms at the Michi-
gan Union bore a strong resemblance to
a pre-convention party caucus, as more
than 200 members and guests of the
American Society of Mechanical Engi-
neers cut the ribbon on what promises to
be a banner year for the Society. Mem-
bers sat, stood, and virtually hung from
chandeliers as officers, committee heads
and noted guests outlined the advantages
of active participation in the organization.
The enthusiasm of the group was a por-
tent of great things to come for the
Michigan Chapter. The meeting was con-
ducted by A.S.M.E.'s new officers, Chair-
man Vincent Burns and Vice-chairman
Dell Asplund. Among the Society's
guests at the smoker were Mr. H. S.
Walker of Detroit Edison, Dean Em-

BRIQUETTING PROCESS
DAVID S. WISE '50E
Swarf Reclamation
Swarf is the term applied to the metal
shavings and chips that are produced by
machine tools in the manufacturing
process. Swarf handling in industry has
become a big problem, especially now
that we realize the need for reclaiming
all of our scrap metal. Justification for
the cost of any reclamation process lies in
the fact that from ten to 20 per cent of
the metal that is supplied to firms is lost
as scrap. The importance of utilizing
every bit of our scrap metal is apparent,
for it is a well known fact that our nat-
ural resources are approaching a danger-
ously low point after being drained by
two World Wars. Swarf accounts for a
large percentage of the scrap produced in
industry, and therefore a more efficient
and economical method of recovering it
should be welcomed.
Any method for the recovery of swarf
must contend with two main problems:
(1) The swarf is usually accompanied
by coolants and must be separated by
some suitable method, such as centrifug-
ing.
(2) Swarf occupies excessive space
and must be compressed to densities ap-
proaching that of solid metal to facilitate
handling and to avoid loss on refining.
Because of the large area of swarf com-
pared to its volume, it burns up when
ordinary methods of fusion are used.
At this point, it would be well to out-
line the present method of swarf reclama-
tion so that improvements may be set
forth. The method is as follows:
(1) The swarf is removed from the
machines and put on a screen to drain
off part of the coolants.
(2) The drained swarf is fed into a
chopper to be cut into uniform pieces.
(3) The remaining coolant is removed
by centrifuging.
(4) Chips are further dried in a gas-
heated, rotary drum to about one per cent
moisture.
(5) The swarf is softened for com-

A musical Engineer is David Wise, and
he operates a campus dance band to
prove it. Dave's article comes to us by
way of the Lincoln Arc Welding Founda-

College. He is planning more original ar-

pression by raising it to red heat in a
conveyor furnace.
(6) As the swarf comes out of the
furnace, it is compressed in a briquetting
press into two pound blocks.
(7) The hot blocks are charged into
an oil-fired, reverberatory furnace to be
melted and refined into ingots.
The first four operations in the process
which involves the separation of the turn-
ings from the coolant, seem to offer the
only practical solution to the problem of
swarf handling. However, the second
problem, that of decreasing the exposed
area of the turning, could be handled
much more efficiently by the use of elec-
tric welding. Instead of first heating the
swarf and then briquetting it, the same
result could be obtained in one operation
by incorporating arc- and resistance-weld-
ing in the briquetting press. By main-
taining the compressing surface of the
press at different potentials, the briquette
produced would be made up of small
shavings all welded together by the heat
produced from the arcing and high con-
tact-resistance in the shavings. The addi-
tional cost of welding equipment would
be more than offset by the savings ob-
tained from the elimination of the con-
veyor, furnace, and the reduction in the
size of the press needed. The same qual-
ity of briquette could be produced with
a smaller press because of the greater heat
produced at the place where it is needed.
A saving in production costs would also
result because two operations are com-
bined into one, thereby requiring less
labor.
A simplified sketch of the welding as-
sembly is shown in Fig. 1. The com-
pressing plates (A and B) of the briquet-
ting press are water-cooled electrodes
made of copper, or some suitable alloy,
which together form part of the secondary
coil. The moving plate (A) is connected
to the rest of the coil (C) through a flex-
ible band (D). The secondary circuit
is completed by arcing through the metal
shavings (E) which are being compressed
by the plates of the press. This arcing, to-
gether with the high contact resistance
between the shavings, produces the de-
sired welding heat. The current is sup-
plied to the primary coil through the heat
regulator (F) which accomplishes this
regulation through bypassing part of the
primary winding (G), and thus cutting
down the current produced by the sec-
ondary coil (C). The line relay (H) is
controlled by the timer (I) which gives
the proper time of current flow for eco-
nomical and efficient operation. The
timer is activated at the proper moment
in the stroke of the press by the initiating
switch (J) which is adjustable. This
switch should be adjusted to start the
current just after the movable electrode

Philip H. Mitchell '33E
Most of the news relating to alumni in
this section is that concerning their
achievements in the engineering field.
While Mr. Mitchell earned his Civil Engi-
neering degree in 1933, he eventually
rose to the post of Probate Judge of
Barry County, Michigan.
After receiving his engineering degree,
Mr. Mitchell attended the Harvard
School of Law for two years. In 1935
he transferred to Michigan where he ob-
tained his law degree in 1937. Soon after
graduation, Mr. Mitchell secured a posi-
tion with the Employees Mutual Insurance
Company in Milwaukee and in 1938 was
transferred to the Detroit offices of the
firm. Two years later he set up a law
office in Hastings, Michigan, where he
practiced until his entrance into the serv-
ice during World War II.
He rose to the rank of major in the
XIV Corps Artillery, participating in the
Philippine invasion. Upon his return to
civilian life, Mr. Mitchell was appointed
to the judgeship by Governor Kim Sigler
in June, 1945.
Edward R. Wolf erf '23 E
That new ideas pay off is an adage
well exemplified by Edward R. Wolfert.
He was among those recently designated
a "Modern Pioneer" by the National
Edward R. Wolfert
Association of Manufacturers on the
basis of his work in the laboratories of
the Westinghouse Eelctric and Manufac-
turing Company. This work resulted in
17 patents for the Company.
As a boy in Holland, Michigan, young
Wolfert was deeply interested in scientific
and electrical subjects. After being grad-
uated from Holland High School, he
came to Michigan, where he majored in
Electrical Engineering. While at Michi-
gan he was a member of Tau Beta Pi
and an associate of Sigma Xi. In his
Junior and Senior years he received all
A's and was graduated in 1923. Wolfert
then became a graduate student at the
Westinghouse School and took up work
as a designer of inductance regulators.
He developed a completely enclosed in-
ductance regulator, which was radical
in design. The entire machine was sub-
merged in oil. He also did some work
on electronic tubes for Westinghouse.
Wolfert became head of air-conditioning
design at Westinghouse in 1934. During
the recent war he engaged in the design
of war apparatus.
Rudolf C. Schulte '33E
Several months after receiving his de-
gree in Transportation (Aeronautical),
Mr. Schulte secured a supervisory posi-
tion with the Stinson Aircraft Corpora-
tion. His association with Stinson lasted
for eleven months. For a while he taught
school in Aeronautics, a field in which
his practical achievements were united
with his educational background.
In 1937, he was employed by the Ford
Motor Company, where he was connected
with the Experimental Engineering De-
partment. He remained with Ford
for two years and in 1939 he was
approached by the government with an
offer of a position with the Civil Aero-
nautics Authority. He held several posi-
tions with the C.A.A. in the Power Plant
in Washington, D.C. and at the branch
office of the Piper Airplane Factory in
Pennsylvania.
During the recent war, he was a captain
in the Air Force and was on duty with the
Materiel Command in the Experimental
Engineering Division. Mr. Schulte now
resides in Fort Worth, Texas.
Richard F. Gretsch '30E
Mr. Gretsch is one of the youngest
presidents of a major utility company
in the United States. He received this
honor a few months ago when he was
elected to head the Danbuty and Bethel

Richard F. Gretsch
(Connecticut) Gas and Electric Light
Company. Gretsch studied mechanical
engineering while at Michigan, and was
president of the engineering class when
he was graduated in 1930. He was also
a member of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers while in school.
Upon being graduated he became affi-
liated with the Boston Edison Company.
In 1934 Kliegl Brothers of New York
City sent him to California to introduce
a new development in high intensity
lighting to the motion picture industry.
Later he became engaged in the man-
agement of various public utility prop-
erties in the Mid-west. In 1936 he
served as management officer of the sub-
sidiaries of the Utilities Service Company.
Also in 1936 he received his Bachelor of
Law Degree from St. John's University
after many months of study at night
school. During the past war he was in
the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers,
where he was a captain in the Ordnance
Department. After his discharge he be-
came Assistant to the President of the
Danbury and Bethel Gas and Electric
Light Company.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


by
RALPH C. WALKER "47E
With the ever-increasing use of high
frequencies in the post-war development
of television, two-way radio for police,
ambulance, and transportation systems,
the problem of man-made interference
and its suppression is becoming more im-
portant. Radiation from automotive igni-
tion systems, appliances in the home, and
electrical machinery which formerly was
of minor importance to the owner of a
550-to-1600 kc broadcast receiver is now
a considerable source of annoyance to
him if it tears holes in his television pic-
ture reception.
From an engineering standpoint, ad-
vances have been made and are con-
tinuing to be made to suppress this inter-
ference. During the war, because of the
greatly increased use of mobile radio, as
well as high frequency channels, both the
Signal Corps Laboratories and private in-
dustry combined their efforts to remove
the hash and the static from radio recep-
tion. In England, where television had
a pre-war start on our own commercial
development, much has been done to in-
vestigate both the nature of the interfer-
ence and means of combating it.
Practical work in the installation and
operation of television receivers in this
country is extending the knowledge of
the radio serviceman in how to minimize
interference reception. Recently, an in-
ternational group of experts, the CISPR
(Committee International Special des
Perturbations Radiophoniques) met in
Zurich, Switzerland, to discuss and ex-
change ideas and developments in the
radio interference field. Standards as to
methods of measurements, types of inter-
ference, and noise sources were among
topics under consideration. As with all
engineering development, manufacturing
and commercial progress is soon to fol-
low.
Types of interference and
methods of propagation
Basically, man-made radio interference
can be classified under two major head-
ings: (1) the spark type, single definite
impulses from such sources as ignition
systems or vibrating contacts, and (2) the
whine, or hiss, type, resulting from rapid,
overlapping pulses (as characterized by
commutator ripple voltages).
The spark type consists of a wave with
a steep front, and extremely high ampli-
tude (Fig. 1). Because of its short dura-
tion, it requires a high amplitude in order
to have sufficient average energy to be an-
noying in radio reception. This same
characteristic also introduces difficulties
in measuring and defining tolerable limits
for the noise. Ordinary power output
measurements from a receiver can quite
often be misleadingly low while at the
same time, aural checking of the spark
signal reveals a very high audible level
of noise.

Extensive tests have been made, both in
this country and abroad by private indus-
try and government agencies, with the
result that gradually standards and gen-
eral interpretations are being made, al-
though more in a qualitative than a quan-
titative sense. A recent review of results
obtained in England on ignition inter-
ference over a period of time sums up
some of these ideas.
Most methods of measuring spark in-
terference employ a high frequency volt-
meter having a specified band-width
linear detector. With this set-up, the aim
is to measure the crest value, a procedure
which seems to best give a rating to the
"nuisance" or "annoyance" effect. The
British tolerance level, defined for fre-
quencies from 1.5 to 150 mc measured at
ground levels 30 feet from the source,
is 50 micro-volts per meter. Recent
American tests for vehicular ignition in-
terference used a 35 microvolt per meter
standard at a 50 foot distance over a
frequency range of 30 to 150 mc. Mini-
mum signal strengths for satisfactory re-
ception on commercial receivers are de-
fined as 50 microvolts per meter for
frequency modulation and 500 microvolts
per meter for television.
The usual theory of the action of the
spark discharge is that on breakdown at
the spark plug gap, oscillating currents
are set up in the LC circuit of the coil
inductance and the distributed capacitance
of the coil and high tension cables. The
time for voltage breakdown is on the
order of a tenth of a microsecond (Fig.
2). The oscillating currents cover a
wide band of frequencies, which band is
propagated from the high tension leads
(acting as aerials) and is picked up by
the nearby radio receiver. This idea is
advanced by most texts and authorities
and is widely accepted. (Recently, how-
ever, an English writer has offered a new
theory, developed from ignition circuits
but applicable to all similar spark trans-
mission. He states that as the frequency
spectrum is very wide and without detect-
able gaps, the usual theory would imply
that the high tension lead has a very
large number of resonances, closely
spaced. He regards this as improbable
and instead advocates the different pic-
ture that the radiation consists of a train
of impulses. Each impulse is of very
short period compared to that of carrier
frequencies up to hundreds of megacycles.
Then, what is heard on the receiver is the
impulse response of the receiver aerial
and the receiver itself. Supporting his
mathematical analysis is experimental
data, including some photograph records
of isolated impulse trains.)
Hiss type of interference, as contrast-
ed to the crashing peaks of the spark
type, consists of a steady, relatively low
amplitude whine. Probably the most fla-
grant offenders are commutator type
motors—usually the ac-dc style. "The

prof kessler
Have you ever looked over a time
schedule and wondered to yourself who
"created this monster?" The Technic has
the man! We wish to present to you As-
sociate Professor Clarence F. (Jack)
Kessler of the Mechanical Engineering
Department, who also functions as Chair-
man of the Classification and Rooms
Committee. In between times, Mr. Kess-
ler manages to find time to teach classes
in Conveying Machine Design and Heat
Power.

Professor Kessler
After graduating from the University
of Michigan in the class of '19, Mr.
Kessler then worked in the field for Per-
fection Stove Co., Packard Motor Co.,
and Buick. He came back to "dear Ann
Arbor town" in 1920, intending to take
his Masters Degree and then go back
into industry. During this time, however,
Mr. Kessler decided that he preferred
teaching to working, and to date hasn't
changed his mind. Mr. Kessler belongs
to the A. S. H. &amp; V. and has worked as
a consulting engineer for Brooklyn Edi-
son and Detroit Edison. But he too has
his problems.
You all undoubtedly think that it is
rough trying to make up a decent class
schedule. But think of being faced with
the prospect of trying to make up a sched-
ule for all of the Engineering College,
and, in addition to this, keeping peace
with the faculty and maintaining friend-
ship with the student body. Mr. Kessler
believes that in the Engineering College
there exists a good working agreement
between teacher and student. It is true
that, due to the increased enrollment of
the past few years, many more problems
have arisen. They are largely those of the
increased necessity for Saturday classes
and inverted programs. These problems
are greatly aggravated by the student re-
sistance to them, from which results the
situation of "section chiseling" and simi-
lar practices. Mr. Kessler wishes that the
students would realize that Saturday
classes and inverted programs are just
one of those ever-present "necessary
evils," created so that all students can be
accommodated. On this point, a little
more student cooperation is needed. Mr.
Kessler feels that if the student body
would realize that this situation exists,
cooperation would come naturally.
Therefore, the next time you have an
eight o'clock on the 19th floor of East
Engineering, don't transfer to Bus. Ad. or
try to shoot Mr. Kessler. Just bear your
cross cheerfully, stroke your slide rule
three times a day, and remember that the
rest of the section will be your com-
panions in distress.
R. A. H.
prof swinton
In an academic environment that is
generally acknowledged to include an
engineering faculty of the highest pro-
fessional distinction, Professor Roy S.
Swinton is right at home. In fact, his
record indicates that he would be at home
wherever the frontiers of his vocation
might be established.
A native of Calumet, Michigan, he be-
gan his career as a teacher of manual
training before coming to the University
of Michigan to take a degree in civil engi-
neering in 1910. A season with the
United States Lake Survey followed, then
a term as post-graduate assistant at the
University.
About that time, the University of
the Philippines was in the process of
establishing a college of engineering.

Professor Swinton, as the first teacher of
engineering was called upon to outline
a six-year, 172-hour curriculum in civil
engineering, an arrangement similar to
our medical or law programs. This as-
signment proved to be a formidable task,
since, he confesses, he knew "nothing but
'Michigan' "; and therefore simply trans-
lated all available engineering school
catalogs into terms used at Michigan.
Subsequently, the course was mildly re-
vised by another man from Michigan,
the late Professor C. G. Wrentmore, at
that time Director of Public Works for
the Islands.
Professor Swinton recalls with a smile
the system of promotion used at the
school, whereby both students and in-
structors were promoted each year. "There
was no escape," he says. "It was really
tough on the students." Recently,
through the efforts of Philippine politi-
cians, it has become even tougher. The
course has been reduced to four years, and

Professor Swinton
the "mortality" has been increased to 75
per cent by an over-conscientious faculty.
Returning to the United States, Pro-
fessor Swinton took the post of Inspector
on Ohio River Dam No. 29, then In-
spector-in-Charge of the Lincoln Me-

ROBERT D. PAUL, '50E
The bulletin of The Cooper Union
School of Engineering defines engineer-
ing as ". . . the art of transforming the
resources of Nature for the use of man,
by considering wisely all the factors enter-
ing into the operation." This definition
of engineering places the engineer
squarely between the scientist on one side
and the business-man on the other. Such
a central position has enabled the engi-
neer to apply the methods of science
to achieve the economic aims of the busi-
ness-man. The problem the student engi-
neer then faces is: what are those meth-
ods of science which are to be applied
when he becomes an engineer?
A thorough investigation of the bulle-
tins of various Engineering Colleges re-
veals no course titled, "The Scientific
Method." What we see instead are
courses such as Mathematics, Physics,
Chemistry, Mechanics, and the like.
When does the student engineer learn
what this mysterious scientific method is
all about? The answer is: he learns the
scientific method by using it, because the
courses he takes are sciences. This leads
us to the core of our problem. If an engi-
neering student learns the methods of
science by learning the principles of a
fundamental science, what is the method
of these fundamental sciences?
Science is classically defined as rea-
soned knowledge. Therefore a method
of science is a method of obtaining rea-
soned knowledge. With this definition
in mind, let us now examine carefully
the method of science which has enabled
the world's engineers to establish the
technology the world possesses.
As a method of inquiry science is
necessarily reflective. It is a method
which not only admits, but encourages,
doubts. The process of doubting estab-
lishes new evidence which in turn in-
creases the body of knowledge available.
It is an interesting experience to trace
the development of a scientific theory.
This will serve as a concrete example of
the workings of the method of science.
The first step is to establish concepts
and definitions. For example, the con-
cept of a point in Euclidean Geometry.

ROBERT D. PAUL
Any biography, short, long, or what
have you, will sooner or later get around
to Robert Paul's three favorite topics:
Gershwin's music, modern novelists, and of
course, ships. This may seem to be an
odd conglomeration of interests for a stu-
dent engineer, but he explains it thusly:
"My life-long interest in ships and naval
affairs is the result of a boyhood associa-
tion with a naval reserve officer.
The fanaticism about Gershwin's music
is the result of hearing the "Rhapsody in
Blue" at a particularly early and impres-
sionistic age; from that moment, I was
sold.
Thomas Wolfe's novels were my sum-
mer reading a few years back This type
of reading has almost reached the status
of a hobby."
Of the other vital statistics, perhaps it
should be mentioned that Bob was born
20 years ago in New York City. At the
present time he lives n a New Jersey sub-
urb. Bob entered the College of Engin-
eering in the Fall of 1946 and, "if all goes
well," he will be graduated in June of
1950.
This concept is not capable of proof but
is a point of departure; the beginnings
of a science.
Once concepts are established the next
step is to state hypotheses, or postulates.
A postulate is a relationship between con-
cepts. The function of a postulate is to
help us in our search for the order
among facts. The presentation of a prob-
lem often helps us to formulate a postu-
late. It is important for our postulates
to be relevant to the problem we are at-
tempting to solve.
From postulates we are able to make
deductions. These deductions are made
with the use of the two fundamental tools
of all sciences, mathematics and logic. It
is here in our process that the experi-
mental method steps in. Deductions we
are able to make must be capable of ex-
perimental verification. The results of an
experiment must produce results which
are in agreement with the hypothetical
deduction. A contradictory experimental
result forces us to revise our postulates,
or in extreme cases to even revise our
concepts.
This tough-minded approach to the flux
of things observable in the world about
us is the essence of the scientific method.
This single methodology runs as a single
brook throughout the realm of empirical
sciences, both physical and social, and
serves as the uniting idea which binds
all the sciences into a cohesive whole.
With our new understanding of the
methods of science we may now return
to the problem of the engineer as a user
of this method. As has been stated, the
engineering student receives a thorough
training in the principles of mathematics
and the physical sciences. This training,
as might be expected, develops a man
capable of applying the scientific method
to the problems of design, construction,
plant management, and other similar jobs
with which engineers are usually faced.
The engineer is capable of applying the
scientific method to his problems, but
economic pressures often force him to
abandon the scientifically correct solution
for the one which will make the most
money for his employer, while not vio-
lating scientific principles sufficiently to
cause any apparent harm. We cannot
expect an engineer to be interested pri-
marily in facts, their relationships, and
the results of these relationships, as is
the scientist. An engineer is mainly in-
terested in harnessing the powers of
Nature for the good of man. If an old
concept will serve for this purpose he has

000 on research in 1925. By 1930 this
figure had risen to $310,000. A few of
the companies which are responsible for
this early development of research are
the Detroit Edison Company, the Tim-
ken Roller Bearing Company, and Gen-
eral Motors. A more exhaustive list
would include almost all of the promin-
ent manufacturers of this state.
Even in the depression-ravaged
1930's a great deal of research was con-
ducted in the various laboratories on cam-
pus. The late 1930's saw a national
emergency which caused the United
States Government to call upon the uni-
versities of the nation to help develop
the tools of war. Our Engineering Re-
search Department became a coordinating

sor Albert White was appointed Director

We have attempted to give you a clear
picture of the history of Engineering Re-
search here at the University. It shall
now be our purpose to give you a picture
of the facilities available for research.

link in the diversified research carried on
during the war. The number of projects
was so large that at one time during the
war $4,500,000 was invested in research
here on campus. Today, more research
projects are in progress than at any time
during the war; the investment however
has shrunk to $2,500,000. Approximately
80 per cent of the research now being
conducted is government work of a classi-
fied nature.
Because the Engineering Research De-
partment served physical sciences outside
the Engineering College, the Board of
Regents changed the name of the Depart-
ment of Engineering Research to the
We will conclude our discussion by tell-
ing you some of the projects that have
been completed here in the past and also
present a kaleidoscope view of the proj-
ects which are now being carved out.
The Institute operates under a flexible
plan which utilizes not only members of
the faculty who, by virtue of their teach-
ing experience and technical training, are
well qualified to conduct research, but
makes provisions for the use of trained
specialists apart from the faculty. At the
present time there are a number of such
men who work full time on various proj-
ects under the direction of various de-
partment heads. As the occasion demands,
advanced students are employed as assis-
tants which assures that at any one time
several highly-trained specialists are
working on a single project.
It is evident that the most important
facilities required by any research organi-
zation are the various laboratories in
which the actual research is carried out.
The scope of the laboratory facilities at
Michigan permits the carrying on of
much research without the purchase of a
single piece of additional equipment.
Most of the departments in the College
of Engineering are equipped with labora-
tories. In addition to the instructional
value of these laboratories they are valu-
able for use in the specialized work of
research. The laboratories are supple-
mented by the departmental libraries
which are rich not only in text-book
material, but in periodical literature cov-
ering every phase of the engineering
science. This last source of reference
material makes an excellent starting point
for any research project.
Let us now take a closer look into
some of the departmental laboratories
which are the base operation for the re-
search now being conducted.
The Aeronautical Engineering Depart-
ment has three wind tunnels which are the
chief feature of the aeronautical labora-
tory. Two of the wind tunnels are here
in Ann Arbor; the third is at Willow
Run Airport. The two wind tunnels in
the East Engineering Building are of the
conventional open-throat type. The larger
of the tunnels is octagonal in cross-sec-
tion, with a throat diameter variable from
five to eight feet and produces wind
speeds of approximately 110 miles per
hour. A smaller wind tunnel, with a
three foot by four foot rectangular throat
and wind speeds of 60 miles per hour, is
used primarily for routine instruction.
With the realization of supersonic speeds
for aircraft it became necessary for the
Department to acquire a tunnel capable of
testing models of aircraft which were to
fly at these new high speeds. Willow
Run Airport has become the scene of this
new laboratory. Work done in this new
wind tunnel is almost entirely for the
government and it must remain secret at
the request of the government.
The laboratories of the Chemical and
Metallurgical Engineering Department are
divided into four main groups. The
Chemical Process group has facilities for

Red Light stops
trouble-makers
This girl is using a test set designed by Western Elec-
tric engineers to detect defective fuses which would
pass ordinary tests. X-ray studies of bad fuses showed
broken fuse wire as the usual cause of failure, but
that 90% of the time, the broken ends made suffi-
cient contact to test O.K. unless the fuse was vibrated.
In the new test set, the fuse is struck ten times a sec-
ond with a force of 250 grams causing the broken
ends to separate—an "open" for as little as ten micro
seconds, lights a red light—and the fuse gets no
chance to make trouble in telephone service.
Bumper crop of crystals

Here you see a tank-full of synthetic EOT (etbylene
diamine tartrate) crystals ready for harvesting at
Western Electric's Electronics Shop. These have
been held at a fairly constant temperature for several
weeks and have swished back and forth in the solu-
tion in the tank, growing from tiny seeds into chunks
the size of your fist. They will now be processed into
crystal plates to filter various voice channels—
nearly 500 separate conversations— traveling over
the same long distance telephone circuit. Setting up
equipment and working out precise controls re-
quired in growing crystals was an interesting prob-
lem for Western Electric engineers. This year's crop
will produce a million or more crystal plates.

"Sunspot" research, by RCA engineers, helps radio communications to dodge interference
from magnetic storms. RCA Laboratories is a center of radio and electronic research.
93,000,000 miles of laboratory space
A cyclonic spot erupts on the face of the
sun, and—here on earth—we feel it. Sun-
spots cause "magnetic storms," which
disrupt radio communications.
What can be done about it? Research,
during which RCA scientists and engineers
"worked" by instrument on the sun —
93,000,000 miles away— offers an answer.
For years, science related magnetic
storms to sunspots. Accurate forecasts of
disturbances were needed.
RCA scientists took a new tack. They noted
that interference was most intense when
sunspots were in a certain "critical area."
Location and activity were observed to be
more important than size.
Using this knowledge, RCA communi-
cations engineers accurately forecast the
beginning and end of magnetic storms.
They have established a daily magnetic
storm forecasting service which is distrib-
uted like weather reports throughout the
world. Transmission of messages can be
arranged over circuits or paths that will
dodge interference.
Such a pioneering spirit in research gives
efficiency of service and leadership to all
products and services bearing the names
RCA, and RCA Victor.

They said, "You can't do it!"
But Du Pont scientists
developed a synthetic rubber
with superior properties
"Synthetic rubber is an impossibility
at any price!" declared a noted Euro-
pean scientist a number of years ago.
And most people were inclined to
agree because for more than a century
chemists had been unable to dupli-
cate natural rubber.
Du Pont scientists knew that all
.rubber had bad qualities as well as
good. "Why struggle to duplicate its
faults?" they asked. "Why not find
a new chemical compound with all
the good qualities of rubber, but
none of the bad?"
They took as their starting point
a discovery by Dr. J. A. Nieuwland
of Notre Dame in connection with
the polymerization of acetylene. By
modifying this process, they made
monovinyl acetylene. Adding hydro-
gen chloride, they made a new chem-
ical compound called chloroprene—
a thin, clear liquid at low tempera-
tures. Like isoprene, it polymerized
to form a rubber-like substance. But
the new material, now known as neo-
prene, required no sulfur for vulcani-
zation and was superior to rubber
under many service conditions.

than natural rubber. Hardly an in-
dustry is not now using it, for such
good reasons as these: neoprene prod-
ucts resist deterioration by oils and
greases. They stand up under expo-
sure to direct sunlight. Their aging
and flame-retarding properties also
are superior to those of rubber.
Three types of Du Pont research
Modern research involves time,
money, manpower. To develop neo-
prene, for example, took six years of
laboratory study, a research and de-
velopment expenditure of millions of
dollars, plus the work of skilled re-
search chemists, physicists, engineers,
and other scientists.
At Du Pont, research is continuous.
Some of it is designed to develop new
products or processes; some to im-
prove existing products or processes;
and the balance is fundamental re-
search to uncover basic facts without
regard to immediate commercial use.
Each of ten manufacturing depart-
ments has its own research staff and is
operated much like a separate com-
pany. In addition, the Chemical and
Engineering Departments, which are
not engaged in manufacturing oper-
ations, conduct research in the in-

ases of evaporation, distil-
absorption, filtration, crystalli-
arring, and mixing. Evaporation
at high pressure and temperatures is
possible with a gas-fired diphenye
ooiler. The Metallurgical laboratories are
equipped for the study of heat treating,
melting, alloy development, effects of
gases in metals, metallographic investiga-
tions, photo-micrographic work, high
temperature properties, pyrometric work,
and X-ray investigations. Gas, fuels, and
combustion make up the third group of
laboratories. This group is equipped to
make test on motor fuels, both internal
combustion and Diesel. Studies can also
be made of anti-knock qualities, fuel
ratios, compression ratios, starting, accel-
eration, and the problems of lubrication.
A fourth group of laboratories is main-
tained for study and research on the
problems arising in the industries related
to ceramics, cement, electro-chemistry,
paint, varnish, petroleum, pulp, and
paper.
In the laboratories of the Civil Engi-
neering Department the problems of sani-
tary engineering, highway engineering,
hydraulic structures, and foundations may
be studied. The sanitary engineering
laboratory is equipped to study the puri-
fication of water, treatment of city sew-
age, and protection of streams from pollu-
tion. Argo Dam on the Huron River is
the scene of one of the flumes of the
hydraulic laboratory. The greater part
of the research conducted by the Civil
Engineering Department is located away
from the campus.
Professor Lovell, head of the Electrical
Engineering Department, and member of
the Executive Committee of the Engineer-
ing Research Institute, is fortunate in
having under his direction some of the
most complete and extensive laboratories
on campus. The communications labora-
tory is equipped to study all branches of
the complicated network of communica-
tions which unites the world today. The
University maintains its own short-wave
station which is used to keep in touch
with the University's summer camps as
well as for instruction and research.
Laboratories are also maintained in this
department to study high voltage, heat
transfer, and the newer field of Elec-
tronics.
Studies in strength of materials, fluid
mechanics, and dynamics, form the bulk
of the laboratory work in the Engineering
(Continued from page 16)
Mechanics Department. Some of the
most important research has been done in
the study of stress concentration. A
whole laboratory is devoted to photo-
elastic analysis through the use of polar-
ized light and bakelite models.
Basic research in ship resistance and
rolling effect is carried out in the naval
tank in the Naval Architecture and Ma-
rine Engineering Department. The tank
was lengthened 60 feet this fall. It
is now 360 feet long, 22 feet wide, and
ten feet deep. A false bottom can be used
to simulate shallow water conditions. The
ship models used in the tests are usually
made in the shop which is adjacent to
the tank.

It is quite natural for this University to
have a very close connection with the
automobile industry. A large automotive
laboratory is maintained to aid in the
research which has enabled the automo-
bile to reach its high state of refinement
in such a short time. The laboratory has
electric dynamometers which are capable
of measuring up to 300 horsepower.
The other branches of mechanical engi-
neering also have laboratory facilities.
Experimental work in connection with
engines, boilers, pumps, fans, air com-
pressors, hydraulic machinery, ventilat-
ing equipment, and heating plants can
be carried on. Power machines of all
kinds including turbines, pumps, recipro-
cating engines, condensers, a refrigerating
plant and all the necessary instruments
for conducting a wide variety of re-
searches in the mechanical engineering
field are available.
Under the leadership of Professor Bos-
ton the Metal Processing Department has
established a foundry laboratory and a
machine tool laboratory. All phases of
metal working and heat treating may be
studied and the art of welding may be
thoroughly investigated. The problem of
machinability has received extensive treat-
ment in the laboratories of this depart-
ment in past years.
The Engineering Research Institute is
fortunate in being able to draw on the
resources of the laboratories of the de-
partments of other colleges. The labora-
tories of the Physics and Chemistry De-
partments are especially useful. Both the
cyclotron and the soon-to-be-completed
synchrotron will play an important part
in the government research soon to be
conducted.
It will be interesting to discuss some of
the projects which the Institute has en-
gaged in during the past years.
Some of the largest contributions have
been made in the field of automotive
engineering. Advancements in body de-
sign have included sound deadening,
study of panel coatings, effects of rolling
and wind resistance, and the study of
body shapes for streamlining. In the en-
gine itself studies of bearings, special
valves, valve materials, and seats have
been made. There have been extensive
investigations of ignition systems includ-
ing development of a new circuit, elimi-
nating conventional breakers, heat flow in
spark plugs, effect of age on spark plug
performance, and the voltage necessary
for a spark gap. A hydraulic transmis-
sion was worked on here prior to 1938.
Work has also been done on the variable
speed transmission, clutch facings, and
brake drums.
One of the most important contribu-
tions to industry ever to come out of engi-
neering research was the development of
the 'capacitor-type single phase motor.
This motor was invented by Professor
Bailey, of the Electrical Engineering De-
partment.

proaches to the Tehuantepec canal could
be guarded in part by air patrols and
by radar operating from bases in the
Revilla Gigedo and the Galapagos island
groups and from Clipperton Island (see
Fig. 2).
8. A canal on the Isthmus of Tehuan-
tepec is much favored by its known im-
munity from destructive earthquakes
throughout the last three centuries, al-
though earthquakes have been disas-
trous for most of Mexico and Central
America.*
9. The northern third of the Tehuan-
tepec Isthmus is a highly productive oil
field, so that local fuel oil would be avail-
able for vessels transiting the canal. This
field, which was opened as late as 1921,
yielded 5,842,000 bbl. of oil in 1946.
10. The Pacific terminal of the pro-
posed Tehuantepec canal is within the
Lower Lagoon (see Fig. 1), and inas-
much as this lagoon has a narrow con-
nection with the sea, no tidal locks will
be required on this front, although they
are necessary for the Panama project.
11. The operational advantages of the
straight course of the proposed Tehuan-
tepec canal over the sinuous one at
Panama are considerable. Electrification
will be available not only for illumina-

tion, but also for the propulsion of ves-
sels; and thus it should obviate the wear
on the canal walls by the currents from
churning screws, and promote ventilation
of the tunnel.
Without unnecessary delay a precise
profile of the line of this proposal canal
should be surveyed, and drill borings
should be put down within the tunnel
section. Until this has been done, no
reliable estimate of costs is possible.
Purely tentative ones based on an as-
sumed average depth of 120 feet for the
open ditch sections (probably a liberal
estimate) are as follows: For 63 miles
of tunnel, plus six miles for three tunnel
sidings, 271,000,000 cubic yards; and,
for the two open ditch sections, 340,-
000,000 cubic yards, a total of
611,000,000 cubic yards. This is roughly
two thirds that estimated as necessary to
convert the existing canal at Panama to
a sea-level canal.
In conclusion, the writer would empha-
size, as the greatest of all advantages of
the Tehuantepec project over the Panama
one, its very much greater measure of
security. Colonel Stratton, for the com-
mittee, has admitted for the latter its vul-
nerability under bombing attack, but he
believes the blocked canal could probably
be reopened in a matter of weeks. In a
modern war, this period of weeks, dur-

ence between the ultimate victory and
crushing defeat, and if bombed once it

by the time repairs have been made.

Light weight and excellent fire-
resistant qualities are features of a new
laminated material called "Pyroply," de-
veloped by the Skydyne Corporation, of
Port Jervis, N. Y. Intended for use as
firewall material in airplanes, the panels
are made from specially treated Du Pont
"Strux" cellular cellulose acetate plastic
bonded between sheets of very thin car-
bon steel. While cellulose acetate is nor-
mally slow-burning, it is treated so that
it forms parchment-like layers under high
heat, and the material will stand 2,200
degrees Fahrenheit on one side for 30
minutes without transmitting enough
heat to burn a human hand held an inch
away on the other side. In addition, the

than a pound per square foot and is quite

No one has ever brought in a gusher in Whit-
ing, Indiana—
—yet some of the greatest discoveries in petro-
leum history have been made in Whiting, and
more will be made there. For at Whiting is
Standard Oil's research laboratory, now housed
in new buildings like the one above.
Standard Oil researchers, engineers, and other
technical men have worked for years on the
problems of getting more and better products
from crude oil. Results to date are equivalent
to the discovery in the laboratory of extra
billions of barrels of petroleum.
Now Standard's men of science are looking
beyond crude oil, as well as deeply into it.
Already they know how to make liquid fuels
and other products from natural gas and from
coal, by variations of the hydrocarbon-syn-
thesis process. The future will bring additional
progress on possible replacements for petro-
leum and particularly on more effective meth-
ods of using our present supply.
A good share of that progress will be made in
the Whiting laboratory. Standard Oil men of
the present and future will continue to dig for
oil in their own effective way.

comes into contact with the shavings, in
order to eliminate arcing between the
electrodes and the shavings. This will
reduce unnecessary pitting of the elec-
trode.
The correct sequence is illustrated in
matic screw machines. They use a proc-
ess similar to the first one described in
this paper except that they make the parts
directly from the briquettes instead of
first melting the briquettes into ingots.
The briquette is taken from the press and

FIGURE-!
far, this method of producing parts has
been given little attention but it has
good possibilities, and it probably won't
be long before it is widely used. The
incorporation of welding into the proc-
ess would help bring about its acceptance
because it would cut down the amount of
equipment required.
Certain parts, where porosity and
strength are unimportant, can be com-
pletely finished in the briquetting press.
A good example of this is the steel arches
that are put in houses before they are
pastered. Anyone who has seen them
will recall that they have to be stamped
with holes so that the plaster will stick
to them. If these arches were briquetted
in a specially designed die utilizing the
welding process set forth in this paper,
they would be ready for immediate use
after leaving the briquetting press. They
would be rough and strong enough to
hold the plaster and would not need
punching.
Powdered metallurgy
Another important application of the
process described in this paper could be
found in the field of powdered metal-
lurgy. Briquetting is the key operation
in this field, which means that the same
improvement that was previously out-
lined may be employed. The metal pow-
ders have the appearance and "feel" of
dust, and after they are compressed the
Fig. 2. The walls (K-Fig. 1) of the
briquette die must be made of a reason-
ably strong, non-conducting material that
will withstand high temperatures. A steel
case lined with a good quality refractory
brick or similar material should serve the
purpose. The die walls must fold down
to facilitate extraction of the briquettes.
If self-feeders and extractors are used,
the machine could be made fully auto-
matic.
Making parts directly from
briquettes
At first the process of making parts
directly from briquettes might seem to be
limited to making briquettes for melting
into ingots, but let us look into some
other applications. For the last few
years Chevrolet has been making bearing
lock-sleeves with the chips from auto-
is heated to 1850°F. for 15 minutes in
an electric furnace under a controlled at-
mosphere. After leaving the furnace it
undergoes forging and trimming opera-
tions which produce a finished part re-
quiring no machinery. Four hundred and
fifty-five parts per hour are produced
with 40 per cent saving to the company.
The physical tests indicate a good quality
part (Rockwell hardness 78 to 90 B
scale and fracture load of 2,500 lbs.).
The improvement set forth for swarf
reclamation could be applied equally
well to Chevrolet's bearing lock-sleeves,
with a resulting substantial saving. The
welding process would not only give the
previously discussed advantages in pro-
ducing the briquettes, but would also
eliminate the pre-heating required for
forging because of the tremendous heat
produced in forming the briquette. So

The skeleton where Volts are Housebroken
. . . with the help of
Alcoa Aluminum Structural Shapes
Electricity is transmitted in raging, sizzling, high-
tension currents that couldn't be allowed to enter a
home or factory. To "housebreak" this hot stuff—
step it down toward a useful 110 or 220-volt distribu-
tion stature—is the job of substations.
The "skeleton" of each substation—the frame-
work of beams and girders that support the trans-
formers and equipment—is prey to weather, corrosive
atmosphere, clinging dirt. Good maintenance has
always called for frequent painting, and that called
for shutdowns of electricity . . . until substation
builders heard about Alcoa Aluminum Structural
Shapes! Now the skeleton of a substation can be
built, and routine maintenance painting forgotten.
Among the standard shapes made by Alcoa, engi-
neers find sections exactly suited to their needs.
It gives a whole new concept to structures—this
building with Alcoa Aluminum Shapes. When they
are used for bridges, railroad enginehouses, indus-
trial equipment and similar structures, damaging red
rust will never be a menace, painters will be freed
from their frequent rounds! That's something to
remember when you start putting your degree to
work and are designing structures for industry
instead of for grades. ALUMINUM COMPANY OF
AMERICA, Gulf Building, Pittsburgh 19, Pennsylvania.
FIRST IN ALUMINUM
60 years ago aluminum was a novelty
metal, used only for trinkets such as
combs, watch fobs and napkin rings.
Then alone came a little company with
two ideas firmly in mind—making alumi-
num cheaper and better so it could be more
useful. Tnat was the start of Alcoa, the
start toward making aluminum so strong
that it can often replace structural steel.
Alcoa's 60 years of research and engineer-
ing development have swelled the uses of
aluminum from a handful of trinkets to
4,000 different applications in industry,
in homes, and on farms.

wide-spread use of these motors in such
household devices as vacuum cleaners and
food mixers, plus the many other modern
appliances from malted milk mixers to
beer pumps has resulted in (more and
more radio noise sources, especially in
metropolitan districts. Being of part-
time, or intermittent, duration only adds
to their annoyance.
The most apparent way for man-made
interference to affect reception is to enter
the receiver by the same path the de-
sired radio signals enter—via the antenna.
This is done either by direct radiation or,
more rarely, by re-radiation. For example,
in an automobile, it is possible for the
r-f radiation of the ignition leads to be
picked up and carried out from under
the shielding of the hood by either metal
rods (such as the choke cable) or by
primary circuit wiring, and then be re-
radiated into space.
A second, perhaps more insidious, man-
ner for interference pick-up is through
the power lines to the receiver. Good
examples of this method are home appli-
ances, either on the same circuit or the
same wiring system as the receiver. In
many cases, battery receivers will be
static-free when placed next to an a-c re-
ceiver that is badly affected by noise.
Methods of suppression
The cardinal rule of interference sup-
pression, whether voiced by the research
engineer or the local radio serviceman, is
very simple: In all possible cases, attack
the problem at its source. Secondary
methods in the form of antenna re-loca-
tion, filtering at the receiver, or noise-
limiter receiver circuits may clear up the
trouble for a particular receiver and, in
some instances, are the answer. But
basically, the best approach to the prob-
lem is to seek out the source and mini-
mize the interference there.
For prevention of radio noise pick-up
through power lines from motors and
appliance, a variety of filters have been
developed. Ranging from a simple unit
as a capacitor across the line terminals
to the more complex L, T, pi, and H
filters built up from coils and capacitors,
these devices can usually cure the most
stubborn case of man-made static. Cata-
logs or service literature of manufacturers
in this field offer a wide assortment of
(Continued from page 13)
filters and application notes. Such filters,
besides eliminating pick-up from power
lines, also act to prevent radiation in many
cases.
To suppress spark type of interference
presents a different problem. In the case
of vibrating contacts, it is often possible
to employ a by-pass capacitor to minimize
the spark, but in an ignition circuit, the
insertion of filters will upset the per-
formance of the engine. Therefore, other
means must be utilized.
One system would be to employ com-
plete shielding of the electrical circuit.
However, drawbacks to such a method
are: (1) high cost, (2) the capacitive
load reduces the output voltage of the
coil, (3) insulation problems, and (4)
maintenance problems. Airplanes com-
monly use complete shielding, but there,
other factors enter, such as mechanical
protection. Then, too, the cost question
and the type of maintenance employed
are different than for the automobile.
A simpler approach, which is very
effective to the problem, is the use of
resistors in the high tension circuit to
damp out the current oscillations. Fig.
3 as compared to Fig. 1 shows the damp-
ing effect of a resistor in an ignition lead.
Extensive tests with suppressor resistors
have shown that values from 5,000 to
15,000 ohms will attenuate the inter-
ference from 20 to 40 db in a receiver.
These results are somewhat variable, de-
pending on the layout of the wiring
system, the number of plugs, and other
factors. However, definite improvement
is usually accomplished.
The effect of suppressor resistors on
engine performance has long been a
topic of contention. Majority opinion is
that engine performance is affected. For
example, in marine work, where the en-
gine is usually run at or near top speed,
it is claimed that suppressors cause in-
complete combustion, thinning of the
lubricating oil by the unburned gasoline,
and possible engine damage. As a result,
other methods of suppression are used.
However, the Automobile Research Asso-
ciation in England in a recent series of
tests claim that resistors had no effect on
automobile engines at medium or high
speeds, and only slight effect at low
speeds. And in this country, one spark
plug manufacturer has announced that a
plug with a built-in 10,000-ohm resistor
will soon be available. Along with sev-
eral claims of improved engine per-
formance, he also emphasizes that it
"suppresses spark plug interference with
radio, radio-telephone, radar, and tele-
vision reception, within 35 mv/m from
540 kc to 150 mc at 50 feet."' Un-
doubtedly, the problem is still to be an-
swered.
Problems of control of interference
One of the most important and basic
aspects of the problem of controlling
man-made interference is that of stand-
ards. Still to be developed and agreed
upon are measurements, limits, and defi-
nitions. However, such work has pro-
gressed rapidly of late and is still going
forward.
Another major phase of the problem is
responsibility. With the broad variety* of
electrical apparatus now in use, and
daily coming into use, it is becoming in-
creasingly important that steps be made
to provide interference suppression. The
individual user of electrical equipment
is usually quite oblivious to the necessity
of minimizing interference effects from
his own apparatus, unless it happens to
affect his own radio or television receiver.
Many manufacturers are recognizing this
problem and are using suppression tech-
niques in their factory processes. Here.
in manufacturing methods, controls can
be developed and standardized.
Local legislation, as city ordinances, is
at best haphazard. Difficulties of deter-
mining what would constitute a nuisance
plus lack of facilities would make such
laws almost useless. Perhaps with the
development of the field, Underwriter's
Laboratories specifications of FCC control
may be incorporated.
An approach to the problem
A good example of the present trend of
thought on the part of manufacturers is
illustrated by the work of a Vehicular
Radiation Interference Committee of the
Society of Automotive Engineers and the
Radio Manufacturers Association. After
two years of testing and experimenting,
this committee declared that interference
from automobiles can be held to a toler-
able limit (35 microvolts per meter at
50 feet) if (1) electrical wiring sys-
tems were modified (relocating the igni-

These are the tasks for GAS—these and hundreds of other
industrial heat processing requirements. In fact, modern
Gas Equipment has proved its superiority in virtually every
industrial production-line heating application.
As a source of heat in the production and fabrication of
metals GAS combines characteristics found in no other
available fuel—
• SPEED—heat can be applied to any area or injected to any
depth at exactly the temperature and speed desired.
• CONTROLLABILITY—automatic controls maintain precise
temperatures, permit exacting cycles of heat processing on
continuous 24-hour schedules.
• FLEXIBILITY—equipment is applicable over a wide range,
performs many heat-treating and processing operations
without expensive accessory devices.
• ECONOMY—the fuel and the modern equipment are eco-
nomical, the production cost per piece amazingly low.
• CLEANLINESS—clean fuel facilitates good "shop housekeep-
ing," promotes morale and good health among workers,
eliminates many causes of rejects.
These are the characteristics of GAS you'll find useful in
any industrial heating application—these arc the reasons
why GAS is Universally accepted wherever heat is used
for processing.

We are of the opinion that Isaac New-
ton bit off more than he could chew
when he went to bat against Mother Na-
ture. She threw that "old apple" as she
had done numberless times before, but
this time the apple tried to occupy the
same space at the same time as Newton's
head. Immediately he was struck by a
thought (he must have had the swelling
to prove it) and proceeded to formulate
his Law of Gravity.
It didn't take Newton very long to
have his Law passed, because soon after-
wards a lot of people used it to clear up
the mysteries of the skies. It was shown
that the Sun controlled the movements of
the Earth, and the world was given a
new leash on life. Planets were discov-
ered before they were seen by observing
the erratic behavior of the known planets
and calculating the cause for such stumb-
lings. The phrase ". . . attraction of a
body . . ." crept into the language and
caused a certain amount of confusion
within the ranks of the laymen. This
confusion long since has been cleared up;
but the various connotations still exist
today—stronger than ever.
We started to say that Newton bit off
more than he could chew. With all due
respect to his greatness, we are disap-
pointed that no evidence exists that New-
ton ever considered the two problems of
gravitation that concern humanity most
vitally:
a) the pebble(s)-in-your-shoe-problem,
b) the ash-in-your-coffee-problem.

We might forgive him for overlooking
the (b) problem because it is possible
that he didn't smoke and/or drink coffee.
He certainly drank tea, but that is an-
other problem, of which we are not con-
cerned here. Certainly there is no ex-
cuse for his apparent lack of recognition
of the (a) problem; he is known to have
worn shoes. To us it appears that it was
simply a case of either too much success
or too much apple that went to his head.
We must conclude that he wilfully
avoided mentioning the Pebble Problem
in the "Principia" because he had no
solution to offer.
The Pebble (s) in your Shoe Problem
Unlike Newton, who used his head to
get ahead, we used our feet to perform
the feat of solving the problem which,
we are positive, made him throw up his
hands in defeat. (A pretty good stunt
of acrobatics for a man nearly 300 years
old). It took an apple on the head to
make Newton use his brain; it took a
pebble in our shoe to get our thought
processes started. This might be an indi-
cation that the human brain extends from
top to bottom (in our case only, dear
reader—not in yours).
It is a source of wonderment to us that
this everyday bane to our existence has
not been studied prior to our investiga-
tions. We first began our research when
we observed Einstein remove his shoe
and allow a pestilent pebble to return
to its earthly habitat with an acceleration
of one "g". He accompanied this act
with mumbled expletives, of which we
only understood one gutteral syllable,
"Gee!" That was it! Gravity!
With Einstein's intuitive notion that
gravity was the middleman between the
shoe and the pebble, we hastened to our
research laboratory to determine the
mathematical relationship that would ex-
plain the annoying phenomenon.
We assembled various sizes of feet
(owners attached), first making sure
that each foot was not au naturel. After
separating the sexes into distinct groups,
we found we had our subjects (to re-
peat) in two distinct groups. A hasty
glance at the female pedal adornments
assured us that we need not include these
in our study—unfortunately; it was
obvious that feminine foot attire offered
no problem whatever to even the largest
pebble.
Accordingly, only the male clodhopper
was used. The experiment itself was the
essence of simplicity. A standard test-
pebble was placed upon a smooth floor

and all the shoes were paraded past the
inanimate "mitey mountain." This con-
stituted one complete test-run. Test-runs
were conducted for each size of pebble
starting at a distance of one foot and de-
creasing one inch with each run.
For each size pebble, a minimum criti-
cal distance was recorded which caused
the pebble to tremor slightly. This tremor
was a movement not explainable by floor
deflection and cuff-breeze, these factors
having been calculated previously. We
called this minimum critical distance a
"shoopeb". With every combination of
shoe-size and pebble, there was a corres-
ponding shoopeb. It was found that a dis-
tance X0 = 0.2 shoopeb was the leaping-
distance factor.

It became apparent that the force which
caused the movement of a pebble from a
prone position on the ground to a shift-
ing existence in a shoe was directly pro-
portional to the product of the mass of
the pebble and the shoe-size, and inversely
proportional to some distance expressed
in shoopebs.
The constant of proportionality proved
to be the most elusive quantity to evalu-
ate. Exhaustive tests eliminated the con-
sideration of the color of the shoe and
its manufacturer; buckles, shoelaces, but-
tons, and zippers were found to be very
important. For the method of fastening
directly determined the ankle-gap aper-
ture. Another influencing factor was the
style of the shoe; investigation of this
variable produced astonishing results:
low-cut shoes, which were easily removed,
had a low coefficient of proportionality,
whereas high-walled shoes invariably
produced a force capable of attracting
more than one pebble!

Because of a unique combination of chemical, electrical,
and mechanical qualities, Synthane laminated plastics can
be applied to an endless number of practical purposes.
Moisture and corrosion resistant, light-weight and struc-
turally strong, Synthane has many collective advantages
not readily found in any other material. One of the best
electrical insulators known, Synthane is hard, dense, dur-
able . . . quickly and easily machined.
Among the interesting occupations of our type of tech-
nical plastics are the redraw bobbin and chuck (below)
used in winding fine denier nylon for women's hosiery.

Fine nylon filaments can be wound without pulling and
sticking because of the smoothness of the bobbin. Light
weight of bobbin and chuck allows the spindle to be started
and stopped faster and with less effort. Greater crushing
strength of tube permits larger amounts of nylon to be
wound. This is an appropriate job for Synthane, an inter ■
esting example of using plastics where plastics belong.

no need for a new concept.
This little example of the negative
approach to the problem of the engineer
as a user of the scientific method has
been employed only to illustrate the prac-
tical nature of engineering. A real
evaluation of engineering shows it as a
positive influence on the dogmatic, un-
scientific branches of our society rather
than a negative influence on the more
abstract, empirical sciences.
To sharpen our argument for engi-
neering as a positive influence on our
society we cite two examples: The social
sciences might discover that a woman
prefers a certain type of wheeled cart
to use when shopping in a super-market.
It would then be up to the engineer to
develop a cart of sufficient strength and
durability to meet both the needs of the
storekeeper and the pleasure of the house-
wife. A more striking point might be
made if we used the atomic bomb as an
example. The physicists developed the
ideas which formed the basis for the
bomb, but it was the engineers' job to
design a contrivance which would place
the critical mass at the right place at the
right time. These examples show us that
a science without a technology is a col-.
lection of facts that exists without any-
apparent purpose except, possibly, for the
verification of an excellent method which
increases the fund of human knowledge,
but which does not extend the control of
man over his environment.
We can now show the engineer as an
abstract user of the scientific method.
When an engineer is faced with the prob-
lem of designing a machine, he is faced
with a problem of making a composite,
working whole from a number of small
interconnected parts. This design prob-
lem is similar to the scientist's problem of
stating a postulate as the relationship of
concepts.
Thus, science has developed an excel-
lent methodology which has enabled it
to continue to advance. This method-
ology is learned by the student engineer
through the manipulation and study of
the principles of the physical sciences,
both in and out of the laboratory. The
graduate engineer takes his place in
society as the connecting rod between
science and business. In this intermediary
position he applies the methods of science
to problems of design, management, sales,
and the like, thus making the ideas sci-
ence has formulated useful in the physi-
cal world.

quired to separate the pebble from the
shoe after the shoe has been removed
and upturned. We are still investigating
why, in the case of a plural pebble-load,
there always remains at least one pebble
after the foot has been reinserted.
With this publishing of our scientific
investigation, we hope we have shown
that even a pebble may be a stepping-
stone to success. We still are conduct-
ing tests on the Ash-in-Your-Coffee-

something that said "Meow."
Up came his head. A relieved smile

resulting from compression. The strength
of these parts is obtained by sintering
the briquettes at a temperature well be-
low the melting point of the major con-
stituent. If the parts were briquetted in
a press utilizing the welding process as
described in connection with the reclama-
tion of swarf, they would require little
or no sintering, which would cut down
production costs. This would be accepted
gratefully by industry because the present
high cost of production has limited
powdered metallurgy to the production
of special-purpose parts that cannot be
produced by any other method.
In this paper a few applications of
welding in connection with briquetting
operations have been described. The
process can be applied to the briquetting
of any material that will conduct a cur-
rent well enough to produce uniform
arcing throughout the entire briquette.
The acceptance of this process will not
only produce savings in equipment and
production costs to its users, but will open
up a new field for the electric-welding in-
dustry.

When FASTENING becomes
your responsibility, remember
this important fact - - -
It costs more to specify, purchase, stock, inspect, req-
uisition and use fasteners than it does to buy them. True
Fastener Economy means making sure that every func-
tion involved in the use of bolts, nuts, screws, rivets and
other fasteners contributes to the desired fastening re-
sult — maximum holding power at the lowest possible
total cost for fastening.
You Get True fantrnrr Eronomy When You Cut fault These Wayt

1. Reduce assembly time with accu-
rate, uniform fasteners
2. Make satisfied workers by making
assembly work easier
3. Save receiving inspection through
supplier's quality control
4. Design assemblies for fewer,
stronger fasteners
5. Purchase maximum holding power
per dollar of initial cost
6. Lower inventory by standardizing
types and sizes of fasteners
7. Simplify purchasing by using one

Just plain Salt! But what wonders
it performs in the hands of expert
chemists and engineers. Its two
components play a big part in the
production of paper, soap, glue,
metals, metal products, textiles,
insecticides. They help to sanitize
water, launder clothing, kill
bacteria in dairies, restaurants,
food plants.
"Miracle-working" with Salt—as
well as other basic chemicals-
has been Pennsalt's business for
98 years. Starting with a modest
plant at Natrona, Pa., Pennsalt
has steadily grown, until today it
stands as one of America's impor-
tant chemical companies.
Big ? Yes . . . but not so big as to
swallow up its promising young
men. Old? Yes . . . but not too
old to adopt young ideas that are

high tension leads.
They pointed out that during the pro-
duction of cars was the easiest, and least
expensive time to do suppression work.
Also, with the present high rate of pro-
duction of new cars and retirement of
old, now was a good time to get a ma-
jority of the cars on the road installed
with suppression type equipment.
The Automobile Manufacturers Asso-
ciation in turn recommended that be-
ginning January 1, 1948, in all trucks,
passenger cars, and buses produced, the
first requirement be fulfilled. However,
on the question of the use of suppressors
on all cars, it was decided to defer action
until more information is available.
Thus, recognition of the problem keeps
apace with the growth of the problem,
and although actual positive steps to com-
bat the situation are still rudimentary in
application, manufacturers are increas-
ingly willing to accept responsibility for
the provision of static-free reception.

How to keep a power shovel
from digging its own grave
Power shovels and other heavy duty construction
equipment take a terrific beating. And this used to
wear them out at an early age. Today, engineers are
building longer and longer life into the construction
equipment they design by specifying Timken tapered
roller bearings in place of the friction bearings
formerly used.
Timken bearings make parts last longer by elimi-
nating friction, by keeping gears meshing properly
and by preventing vibration.
Why Timken bearings are first
choice for heavy shock loads
Notice how the load on a Timken bearing is spread
over the entire length of the roller instead of being
concentrated at a single point. This reduces the unit
pressure between the rolling elements.
This greater load area minimizes distortion of the
bearing. Load capacity is increased, the bearing wears
longer, and wheels and shafts are held rigidly in line.
It's another big reason why 9 out of 10 bearing appli-
cations can be handled more efficiently with Timken
bearings.

17. A body weighing 1,000# is sus-
pended from the end of a coil spring
which in turn is suspended from the
end of a cable. Under the dead
weight of the body the spring
stretches 6 inches and the cable .001
ft. per foot length. The body is
being lowered by means of a wind-
ing drum 4 feet in diameter from
which the cable is unwinding. The
velocity of the body is constant at
10 ft. per second. At the instant
1,000 ft. of cable is unwound from
the drum, the drum is stopped in
one more revolution at a uniform
rate of deceleration.
What will be the tension in the
cable during this time?
18. A train starts from rest with an ac-
celeration that varies uniformly with
time from zero to 10 ft. per sec.2 for
a period of 10 seconds. For the next
5 seconds the acceleration is constant
at 10 ft. per sec.2 For the next 100
(Continued from page 18)
seconds the acceleration is zero. In
the next 10 seconds the train comes
to rest with a deceleration that varies
uniformly with time from zero to a
maximum value at the end of the
tenth second.
How far does the train travel?
19. The diameter at the inlet of a Ven-
turi Meter is 12 inches and the
diameter at the throat is 6"; the co-
efficient of the meter is .975. At a
certain instant the difference be-
tween the readings of the mercury
surfaces in the two legs of a differ-
ential gage is 1.85 feet. What is the
discharge of the pipe in cu. ft. per
min. if the flow is assumed to re-
main constant?
20. A crane rail supports two equal con-
centrated moving loads of 5 kips
each, spaced 5'-0" apart. The sup-
ports for the beam carrying the crane
rail are 20'-0" apart. Disregarding
the crane rail, determine the size of
beam to carry this load, based on
maximum bending moment. Ex-
treme fiber stress in bending 18,000
pounds per sq. in.
21. The bus potential of a 60 cycle gen-
erating station is 5,000 volts. A new
25,000 KVA 120,000 volt line is to
be connected to the main bus. Using
single-phase transformers, specify
the voltage and KVA ratings.
22. A cable is suspended from two
points on the same level 1,000 feet
apart. The weight of the cable is
1,000 Ibs. which you may assume is
to be distributed uniformly per foot
horizontally. There is a concentrated
vertical load of 600 Ibs. at the mid-
point of the cable. If the cable sags
20 feet at the mid-point, what is the
maximum tension in the cable?
23. A boiler generates 3,500 pounds of
wet saturated steam per hour from
feed water at 80°F. The gage shows
a pressure of 150 pounds per sq. in.
If the quality of the steam is 98%,
find the boiler horsepower devel-
oped.

boiler working under the following
conditions:

"Improving" any machine really means
increasing its productive capacity. That
means tinkering with speeds and weights
and strength—ending up with alloy steels.
Which alloy steel?—the one that meets
physical requirements at the lowest cost.
Molybdenum steels fill that bill. Good
hardenability, plus freedom from temper
brittleness, plus reasonable price enable
them to do it.

research on high-temperature steels. Pro-
fessor White also developed a steel to
substitute for "1 and 8" stainless steel
in some of the places it is ordinarily used.
Other metals beside steel have been in-
vestigated with an eye to improvement
for a particular industrial purpose. A
quick-annealing type of malleable iron
was perfected; the causes and prevention
of shrinking in the melting of brass were
investigated; and special-purpose ferrous
alloys were devised.
Metallurgical engineering has produced
better metals so it became necessary for
industry to have better ways of machining
and using the metal. As a result the
Metal Processing Department was called
upon to make studies of the effect of
tool shape on cutting force, and studies of
cutting fluids, drills, and miller cutters.
Extensive research also became necessary
on sintered and stellite tools. The in-
creased use of welding presented prob-
lems in stress concentration and strength
of joints which were solved for industry
in the laboratories here on campus.
Even before the advent of supersonic
speeds and jet-propelled aircraft a great
D. N. Frey, research associate, working
with an early model gas type X-ray tube
deal of wind tunnel work was necessary.
Not only was the study of airplane struc-
tures conducted, but the modern stream-
lined train and the automobile of today
were developed as a result of wind tun-
nel testing. The flow of smoke from large
chimneys has also been studied through
the medium of the wind tunnel.
Men have compared engineering me-
chanics in the science of engineering with
that of pathology in the science of medi-
cine. It is not surprising then to view
the number of problems in mechanics
which modern industry faces. Many of
these elemental problems have been in-
vestigated here in our laboratories. It will
suffice just to mention a few: the fatigue
of railway-car wheel flanges and auto-
mobile leaf springs; study of fatigue com-
bined with bending and torsion; use of
the photoelectric method to study the
stress concentration ?.c the holes and fil-
lets of members in bending; and finally
the calculation of the elastic axis for
various shape aluminum alloy spars.
At the opposite ends of the line in a
thermodynamic process are heating and
refrigerating, but both are the concern of
the nation's various industries. The

de Maupassant's classic
about the Frenchman whose
mania for saving string brought
ruin upon him, is an object lesson
for wire rope users.
Courting trouble through a mis-
guided sense of economy applies to
wire rope, too.
The prevention of waste is a
commendable effort but, it should
be exercised before, not after the
rope has outlived its usefulness. It
should be exercised in the selection
of the right rope for the job, its
proper installation and care.
The man who roots through a
scrap pile for a short length of rope
that is "good enough" to serve as
a sling, should remember that a
wire rope, too, is only as strong as
its weakest link.
Our free enterprise system has
created markets that demand the
output of millions of workers.
Roebling slings were developed to
increase the efficiency of these
workers, and to insure their safety.

spread variety of requirements,
Roebling slings have won the con-
fidence of management and worker
alike . . . throughout the world.

ing plans wanted to know more exactly
than they were able to determine the effi-
ciency of their boilers, hot air registers,
and steam radiators. And so the manu-
facturers subsidized a research project to
find out. Kerosene stoves, stokers, and
water heaters also were subjected to the
pointing finger of investigation. In the
refrigeration field, new types of gaseous
refrigerants were tested, insulation studies
were made, and a compression-type re-
frigerator was evolved.
Of the work during the war we are
permitted to make only the barest men-
tion. It may be said that work was done
on the atomic bomb and the "VT" fuse.
We may also confirm your suspicions
that basic aerodynamic research on vari-
ous wartime aircraft was conducted in our
wind tunnels.
The latest project, just recently com-
pleted, is the perfection of the spectro-
graphic method of quantitive chemical
analysis. The original problem which
caused the development of this process
and the actual workings of the method
will be presented in a later article.
Before we close this discussion we
mention a few of the instruments which
were developed, as they became necessary,
in carrying out the primary research. An
accoustical stroboscope was made neces-
sary to aid in locating intermittent noises
and to determine at what part of the oper-
ating cycle the noise occurs. A profile-
graph was used to measure accurately to
a millionth of an inch the smoothness of
a finished surface. In connection with the
spectrographic chemical analysis men-
tioned earlier, an instrument was de-
veloped for rapid and accurate analysis
of ferrous and nickel alloys. This spectro-
graph is suitable for routine foundry
operations in both the ferrous and non-
ferrous fields.
We have endeavored to give you some
idea of the purpose, accomplishments,
and direction of the Engineering Research
Institute. We hope that we have suc-
ceeded in conveying to you some idea of
the vast scope of engineering research.
In this article we have been able to deal
only with results. In succeeding articles
you will be introduced to the methods
and techniques used in developing the
products we have chronicled.

With the assurance provided by this
encouraging opener the Society quickly
swung into its regular fall program with
a very interesting and enlightening talk
by Professor E. F. Barker, Head of the
Physics Department. Professor Barker
gave many of the engineers present their
first introduction to the field of atomic
energy, as he discussed the applications
and potentialities of uranium and its
derivatives in industry. For weeks to
come, Professor Barker may expect to be
besieged by the queries of members of
his enthusiastic audience, which, inciden-
tally, was sold on the future of the non-
military applications of atomic fission.
To put it in the vernacular, "this was
only the beginning" of an exciting pro-
gram for the school year. Included will
be movies, field trips to several industrial
plants in the area, an array of interesting
speakers, and a number of purely "social"
events. The program of the A.S.M.E. is
certain to provide its members and guests
with a most satisfying diversion from
their educational chores.

For many years, ADVERTISEMENTS SUCH AS
THIS ONE have appeared regularly in leading
business magazines. Their primary purpose is
to build acceptance for Square D Field Engineers,
practically all of whom come to us from
leading engineering schools such as yours.

A sample from every industry served by Square D
Field Engineers would make quite a load, indeed.
For these men serve as liaison between Square D
and every segment of industrial America. Their
full-time job is working with industries of every
kind and size—helping find that "better way
to do it."
Through these Field Engineers, located in more
than 50 offices in the United States, Canada and
Mexico, Square D does its three-fold job: Designs
and builds electrical distribution and control equip-
ment in pace with present needs—provides sound
counsel in the selection of the right equipment for
any given application—anticipates trends and new
methods and speeds their development.
If you have a problem in electrical distribution
or control, call in the nearby Field Engineer. He'll

cost the Swintons three years in the Jap-
anese prison camp at Santo Tomas. Pro-
fessor Swinton calls it a "rough course,"
and displays on his office wall a diploma
in "Camp Morals, Ethics, Applied Eco-
nomics, and Dietetics" for his excellent
work as professor. There are now sev-
eral engineers and others, who studied
(Continued from page 14)
engineering mechanics with him while
they were fellow prisoners.
Another item on the wall of Professor
Swinton's office might seem to many of
our co-eds an excerpt from the prison
regulations. This notice, however, was
posted in the corridors of the old uni-
versity:
University of Santo Tomas
Regulations Affecting
LADY STUDENTS
All the lady students are urged to ob-
serve the following regulations:
1. Respect and obey all authorities of
the University.
2. Attend special convocations and lec-
tures.
3. Participate in all scientific, civic, so-
cial and religious extracurricular ac-
tivities of the University when they
are requested to do so . . .
4. Dress modestly, never wear sleeve-
less or extravagant dresses; always
wear stockings and be dignified in
manner.
5. Avoid loitering, unnecessary noise
and loud conversation in the corri-
dors.
6. Avoid idle talks with male students.
7. Leave the classroom as soon as the
professor or instructor leaves it.
8. During the free periods stay in the
Library or in the Ladies Rest Room.
9. Maintain silence in the Library, and
in the classroom, even when the pro-
fessor is absent.
The Santo Tomas prison sojourn de-
veloped in Professor Swinton an acute
awareness of the threat to the personal
safety of innocent persons in troubled
areas of the world, and hence he feels
no little anxiety for his son who is in
just such a situation. Stan Swinton,
(1940 Editor of the Michigan Daily),
holds the post of Associated Press cor-
respondent in southeast Asia.
In gratitude for his liberation from
prison, Professor Swinton offers to pass
"any student who can prove he was a
member of the airborn mission of 180
airplanes that arrived over Manilta at
9:00 A.M. on September 21, 1944, re-
lieving the depressed spirits of some
3,900 emaciated 'students' in the oldest
university in American territory."

The Mathematics Department of the University of Michigan offers in the
College of Engineering an integrated program of study in applied mathe-
matics and specialized topics in engineering. The purpose of this program
is to satisfy the increasing demands of engineering industries and technical
schools for personnel with a training in mathematics and mechanics more
advanced than that normally obtained in the more specialized engineering
curriculums.
The list of courses in applied mathematics, which is offered to both un-
dergraduate and graduate students, is quite extensive. It includes courses
in Advanced Calculus, Statics and Dynamics, Modern Operational Mathe-
matics, Fourier Series and their Applications, Functions of a Complex Vari-
able and their Applications, Quality Control, Statistics, Heat Conduction and
Diffusion, Vector Analysis, Potential Theory, the Mathematical Theory of Elas-
ticity, Hydrodynamics, Topics in Mathematical Physics, Ordinary and Partial
Differential Equations, and Tensor Analysis.
Formal course work in the more advanced fields of applied mathematics
is supplemented by seminars. In these seminars both faculty and students
participate informally in a study of special problems.

GERARD H. GICZEWSKI
Editor-in-Chief
As engineers, we are consistently criti-
cized on our lethargic attitude toward
world affairs. Aside from being mem-
bers of an engineering college, we are
also part of the American society—a so-
ciety which knows no equal. The ma-
jority of us have been through World
War II, where supposedly our purpose
was the preservation of freedom of
speech—freedom of thought—freedom of
religion—freedom from want. This was
our purpose. We have obtained our free-
dom and do not realize the price we paid
for it—not money value, but in the loss
of 80,000,000 people during this past
conflict. We have seen the conditions
which exist in Europe and in parts of the
Pacific area.
Works of man, which in many in-
stances required years of hard labor and
self-sacrifice were destroyed without the
slightest provocation. More important
than the material destruction is the effect
of this conflict on society in general. The
loss of life, the starving people, the crip-
pled and handicapped are examples of the
results of war. The complete undermin-
ing and destruction of moral codes has
created many social problems which we
ourselves are not capable of controlling.
True—we have supposedly won the war,
but as a group of young engineers in one
of the leading colleges of this nation
what can we do to prevent another global
conflict, that would at once engulf the
whole world in chaos and confusion?
The answer to this question is quite
simple. The execution of the policies
underlying this simple answer is a task
requiring effort, initiative, perseverance,
and clear thinking and is a most difficult
problem.
We may attempt to aid in solving this
complex problem by becoming conscious
of the strained relations existing be-
tween nations, remaining honest with
ourselves and our fellow-men on all
phases of life, and by adopting a tolerant
attitude in dealings with people of other
races, colors, and religious beliefs. In
short, realize the fact that we are citizens
of the United States and as citizens we
have certain responsibilities to the com-
munities in which we live, and to the
Nation whose heritage we are proud to
proclaim.
This is not an easy task. No course in
the engineering curricula or as a matter
of fact, in any college curricula offers
the answers to these vital problems. How-
ever, because it is a difficult problem,
does not excuse us from attempting to
solve it. Most of the equations and prin-
ciples required in the solution of this
problem can be found by taking an ac-
tive part in community affairs. The best
place to begin acquiring the community
spirit is here at the University while you
are receiving your formal education.
Many of us will say that we have too
much school work to bother to take time
and actively participate in any campus
organization. This may be true. How-
ever, if the engineering student, after four
years of gruelling work, has only the
knowledge contained between the covers
of the books he used, his education is of
little value to society. This is one of the
reasons, why today, the engineer has not
taken his place side by side with mem-
bers of other professions. Acquisition of
an "all A" record is without a doubt a
commendable achievement; however, by
itself it means nothing. We may possess
the ability to work many complicated
problems; but if we continue our
lackadaisical attitude concerning existing
conditions and surroundings we ourselves
will eventually be failures. We must
learn to live with other people. "To
live" must not be misconstrued to mean
compromise of principles or ethical stand-
ards. For once compromise is made our
main purpose is defeated. The way we
learn to live is once again accomplished
by association with people of different
ideas and backgrounds, and attempting
to realize and respect their ideas, as if
they were our own. Our University offers
us many opportunities along these lines
especially in the way of extra-curricular
activities.
To be better engineers and more use-
ful citizens should be a goal all of us
should strive to attain. Being a good
engineer is relatively a simple task, com-
pared to being a good citizen. Our engi-
neering knowledge in the majority of
cases consists of practical experience plus
the fund of ideas we have received from
our textbook study. To be leaders in our
communities requires the untiring and
usually unrecognized effort on our part
plus the will and the desire to succeed.
The ability to become a leader in a com-
munity is not in the majority of cases a
natural gift. Today the leaders in many
communities are considered leaders only
because there is no one who is willing
to accept the responsibility. This situa-
tion affords the engineer (if he has an
open mind) an opportunity to make his
community more efficient and one of
which he will be proud to be a member.
The engineer, through his use of good
judgment, common sense attitude, de-
pendability and demonstrated initiative
can be an example not only to his own
social circle but to the whole community.
An engineer, who fluently speaks and
writes the English language, is an asset
to the community that he represents. An
engineer who is capable of discussing
national and international problems with
some degree of accuracy and forethought
is also an asset to his community. On the
other hand, the engineer who is only con-
scious of engineering problems might be
considered a liability because his useful-
ness is limited.
As a result of the existing conditions,
and recognizing the abilities of engineers
in regard to discharging their civic re-
sponsibility, it may be advisable for all
of us to resolve to do our utmost to be-
come conscious of present-day interna-
tional problems, to weigh the factors
leading up to our present-day chaotic
world, and, at all times, practice the high-
est principles of justice, equality, and
tolerance.
Where do we get our start? The an-
swer is in our campus organizations and
societies. All of the engineering societies
need capable and intelligent men to carry
on the present activities. Why not re-
serve a little of our brain power for mak-
ing the Engineering College of the Uni-
versity of Michigan a live organization.

• The Robena Coal Mine is currently
producing about 12,000 tons of coal a day.
And when the mine reaches full operation,
it will probably turn out 20,000 tons a day.
Robena is completely mechanized. A
flick of an electric switch starts cutters,
drillers, loaders, dumpers and conveyors.
Workers can stand erect. A powerful
blower furnishes them with fresh air. Steel
beams protect them from cave-ins. An
electric railway with an automatic signal
system transports the coal.
Above ground, too, Robena is operated
at top efficiency. Automatic blending
mixes coal into a uniform grade that will
be usable for steel making. At the tipple,
coal is loaded into barges on the Monon-

gahela River at the rate of a barge every
six minutes.
Engineering coal mines for efficiency and
safety has been a continual challenge to
the operating and engineering officials of
the H. C. Frick Coke Company. They have
met and are still meeting this challenge.

IF A camera could be constructed
with an eye to costs, this is the
picture you'd get of a synthetic rub-
ber plant. By showing all valves as
one valve it brings into proper per-
spective the valve investment in any
plant, any large building where
operation involves fluid control.
Collectively, valves represent a
major expenditure ... yet too often,
they are selected with "petty cash"
consideration.
IT WILL PAY MANAGEMENT to keep
this picture in mind. With wages
and material costs the highest ever,
valve maintenance costs must be
watched as carefully as operating
expense of larger plant units.
EXCESSIVE MAINTENANCE of one
inferior valve is insignificant, but
multiplied by thousands, it is a seri-
ous drain on operating budgets.
Jenkins BROS, helps to meet this
problem two ways. First, by build-
ing extra endurance into Jenkins
Valves, making them the longest-
lasting, lowest-upkeep valves that
money can buy. Second, with advice
from Jenkins Engi-
neers on any question
of proper selection,
installation, inspec-
tion or maintenance.
That's why, for all new installa-
tions, for all replacements, progres-
sive management relies on Jenkins
quality and engineering for lowest
valve costs in the long run. Sold

Year by year, month by month, oil industry chemists find new,
fascinating possibilities in the hydrocarbon molecules that make
up petroleum. They have learned many ways to convert them into
new and more valuable molecules.
One result of this experimentation has been a flexibility that
permits stepped-up output of whichever petroleum products are
most urgently required. When the primary need was for vast quan-
tities of aviation gasoline to help win the war, research showed how
it could be produced. In a peace-time summer, the great demand
is for an ocean of automobile gasoline; in winter, less gasoline and
more fuel oil are needed. Research tells the industry how to make
petroleum serve the public more efficiently.
Standard Oil is a leader in petroleum research. Many remark-
able developments have come from our laboratories; many more
are sure to come, in the future, if we continue to attract good men,
furnish them with the most modern equipment, and provide an
intellectual climate in which they can do their best work.
We are continuing.

Electrons, the sub-microscopic particles
found in all atoms, have now been uti-
lized in an instrument to study a surface
layer of metal less than a quarter-mil-
lionth of an inch thick, according to engi-
neers of the General Electric Company.
The instrument either shoots a beam of
electrons through the extremely thin sheet
of metal, or diverts the beam at an angle
to the surface of a block of metal en-
abling engineers to determine a variety
of surface conditions, including corrosion
and crystal structure of the molecules.
Known as the "electron diffraction in-
strument," the device was built by the
company's General Engineering and Con-
sulting Laboratory.
Dr. J. G. Hutton, who headed develop-
ment work on the instrument, explained
that frequently surface corrosion will ef-
fect performance of electrical contacts,
while on other pieces of equipment such
as bearings, absence of a lubricating layer
of metal will cause increased wear be-
tween metal surfaces. The diffraction in-
strument is expected to assist in the
development of longer-wearing metals
for aircraft engines, bearings, and a wide
number of industrial products, according
to Dr. Hutton. It will find additional use
in metallurgical studies for electrical
equipment, he said.

Electron Diffraction Instrument
In operation of the instrument, a beam
of electrons is "boiled off" a white-hot
tungsten filament, and focused by means
of a magnetic "lens", in much the same
manner as a beam of light is focused with
a glass lens.
For one type of work, this beam then
is passed through a two-millionths-inch-
thick section of metal and produces an
image on a fluorescent screen. A piece of
ordinary photographic film can be sub-
stituted for the fluorescent screen to ob-
tain a permanent record of the image.
In other applications of the instrument,
the beam is directed at a metal surface
at an angle, passes through tiny surface
projections which bend the beam and is
directed at the screen or film.
The image produced is a series of con-
centric 'circles, which differs for eacli
type of crystal structure. Engineers can
readily determine from the photographs
both the nature of the corrosion on the
surface and the crystal arrangement of the
molecules of metal, Dr. Hutton said.
The chamber in which the electrons
travel is evacuated to a high degree, since
electrons would quickly be dispersed by
molecules of air or dust. The pressure in-
side this chamber is approximately
1/8,000,000 the pressure of the atmo-
sphere, he declared.
Electricity at 30,000 cycles per second
is used to power the tungsten-filament
tube. The equipment to convert ordin-
ary house current to this high frequenq-,
the vacuum system and the vacuum cham-
ber are enclosed in a cabinet about the
size of an office desk.
A number of the instruments are now
in use in various industrial, government,
and university laboratories, it was said.
The "electron diffraction instrument"
is shown here ready for operation. Elec-
trons, shot from a tube housed in the
cabinet at the left, pass through the speci-
men, which is mounted inside the glass-
doored chamber. The electron beam after
diffraction then passes into the vertical
box at right, where photographs of the
pattern of the beam are taken.

Laboratory Assistant who worked on de-
velopment of the instrument, is seated

BARNET FROMMER, '51E
As Western civilization becomes more
and more highly technological, the ma-
chines, which are our servants, require
proportionately more maintenance. Thus
it behooves the engineer in the design
of a machine to bear in mind the main-
tenance that that machine will demand
in order to continue functioning, and to
keep such maintenance to a minimum.
The airplane is a machine so incredibly
complex that the problem of maintenance
is a major factor for consideration. The
more time an airplane must spend under-
going maintenance the less time can it
spend in flight. Thus, an airlines opera-
tor must keep more airplanes in service
in order to achieve a given number of
flying hours. Not only does consideration
of maintenance pay off in dollars, but one
must even bear in mind that a single mis-
take made in maintenance can well mean
failure in flight and subsequent death of
all on board. It is well to recall Ben
Franklin's proverb:
For want of a nail, the shoe was lost;
for want of a shoe, the horse was lost;
for want of a horse, the rider was lost;
for want of a rider, the battle was lost:
for want of a battle, the war was lost,
and all was lost for want of a nail.
Thus, we as designers are obliged first
to make certain that all "nails" are well-
driven, and second, that the mechanic can
as easily as possible have access to the
nails to make sure that they are secure.
Since in the colleges the engineering
curricula in general and the aeronautical
engineering curricula in particular are
so heavily burdened with subject matter
of a more basic nature, engineering stu-
dents receive at best a few brief caution-
mgs in the matter of allowance for main-
tenance. In general, subjects of design
detail are left to be dealt with after the
graduated engineer has taken his place
in industry. This delay is perhaps the
most desirable compromise. Nevertheless,
js future engineers, it is well to turn our
■Mention to the topic of allowance for
maintenance at least to acknowledge the
presence of this topic.
Principally, the problem is one of de-
tail design. Upon brief consideration,


Garnet Frommer
After graduation he hopes to teach
and to perform research on rocket and
jet propulsion.
Upon discharge, Barnet decided to re-
turn to school. He had to wait almost two
years to gain admittance to college; he
spent the intervening time holding odd
jobs and hitch-hiking around the north-
west.
"I was born in Brooklyn, but I'm literate
anyway," says this lower-soph transferee
from Champlain College, N. Y. Barnet is
an aero major whose interests—besides
airplanes—include literature, classical
music and fine food.
His interest in aviation began at the
age of six years, when he took his first
airplane flight. He graduated from the
Brooklyn Technical High School, where he
majored in airplane construction. Upon
graduation he enlisted in the AAF, where
he served first as airplane mechanic and
then as aerial engineer. His tour of duty
took him through more than 30 states in
the U. S. and through China, Burma, and
India.
the engineer is confronted with the prob-
lem of having to compromise accessibility
with other not-to-be-disregarded factors.
The aeronautical student soon learns that
the design of an airplane is one great
marriage of compromises; this is no less
true in detail design than in aerodynamic
layout. A few factors with which the
engineer is confronted are; cost of pro-
duction, space, and weight. It is the job
of the engineer to arrive at the most satis-
factory compromise of the above factors
together with other considered factors.
This is true in the design of all units of
the airplane; its engines instrument ar-
rangement as well as the structure itself.
Structural members as well as function-
units must be available for inspection and,
where needed, repair and/or replacement.
In brief, the routine maintenance in-
spections of aircraft are as follows:
Pre-flight inspection, in which the
aircraft is serviced and made certain to
be in such condition as to complete its
proposed flight in complete safety;
Twenty-five hour inspection, made at
the end of twenty-five hours of flying
time. In this and in the following two
periodic inspections the craft is ex-
amined for signs of possible failure.
Fastenings are inspected for security,
fluid-cleaners — oil, filters, hydraulic
fluid filters, air screens, etc.,—are
cleaned, structural members are check-
ed for signs of failure, et al;
Fifty-hour inspection, after fifty
hours of flying time. This inspection is
more thorough than the twenty-five,
but of the same nature; and the
Hundred-hour inspection. This is a
major inspection in which the wear and
tear of 100 hours of flying time
is alleviated. Spark plugs are changed,
all lines are checked for leak-
age, control cables are checked for
wear and for proper rigging, the entire
aircraft is checked for signs of possible
structural and organic failure.
In addition to the above routine in-
spections, the engines are changed after
a number of flying hours, the particular
number of hours depending on the in-
dividual airplane and engine.
Access to the interior of the airplane
often is gained through openings in the
"skin", the openings being covered by
doors which are faired to conform with
the contour of the surrounding surface.
The size of the opening depends on the
degree of accessibility required. Since the
inclusion in the design of the airplane of
inspection openings increases the cost of
production, as well as adding burdensome

You asked for it; we bow to your

thusiasm and eagerness would be display-
ed with the printing of those Part I
Examinations for Professional Engineers.
But first-day-sellouts and a steady stream
of inquiries directed at us across our desk
have disclosed the surprising conclusion
that engineering students want to know
more (indeed, all) about Professional
Engineering.
So be it! We are now in the process
of assembling our material so as to have
ready in our January, 1949 issue a de-
scriptive article which should answer
most of the questions you may have con-
cerning the topic. Included in this article-

Professional Engineers, and Land
Surveyors (Michigan);
2) Rules and Regulations
3) (Depending upon the mails . . . )
Information about Professional En-
gineering in other states, and the
relationships among states on the
subject in question.
As before, the examination is reprinted
as it was given to the examinees.
Proofreading was confined to the preven-
tion of gross errors of misspelling and

The main purpose of this examination
is to determine if the candidate has suffi-
cient knowledge of the basic engineering
subjects to enable him to analyze a prom-
lem and to set up the required equations.
The solution of the equations is of sec-
ondary importance, and any method of
solution which will give an answer with
reasonable accuracy is acceptable. A
mere description of how to work the prob-
lem without actually forming the neces-
sary equations will NOT be acceptable.
It is suggested that the solution of
the equations be left until all of the re-
quired problems have been analyzed.
Answer five—and only FIVE questions.

1. Ship "A" is sailing due north at 10
miles an hour.
Ship "B" is sailing due east at a con-
stant speed.
At a certain time a sight is taken on
B from A and it is found to be
N 5°45' E of A. Six minutes later
another reading is taken and B is
then 18°25' N.E. of A. Six minutes
later B is 32°01' N.E. of A.
What is the speed of B and how far
was it from A when the first read-
ing was taken?
2. What is the overall boiler efficiency
of a boiler which generates 4000 Ibs.
of superheated steam per hour from
feed water at 100° F. when 500 Ibs.
of coal are fired per hour? The
steam has a superheat of 140° F. at
a gage pressure of 200 Ibs. per sq.
inch, and the heating value of the
coal is 14,000 B.T.U. per pound?
3. A steel scow has vertical sides and
a flat bottom, the two ends being in-
clined 1 vertical to 2 horizontal. The
open top of the scow is 124 ft. long
and 25 ft. wide and the bottom is
100 ft. long and 25 ft. wide. The
height of the sides is 6 feet. The
sides, bottom, and ends, weigh 20
Ibs. per sq. ft. At what depth will
the scow float when empty and what
will be the magnitude of the right-
ing couple when the scow is tipped
sidewise through an angle of 6 de-
grees?
4. Twelve wires of equal electrical re-
sistance per unit length are joined
together to form the edges of a
rectangular parallelepiped whose
breadth is twice its height and whose
length is 3 times its height. A cur-
rent of 20 amperes is led into one
corner of the figure and out the
diagonally opposite corner. If the
resistance of the shortest wires is
5 ohms each, what is the drop in
potential thru the figure?
5. A beam with a rectangular cross sec-
tion 6 inches wide by 12 inches
deep, 18 feet long, is simply sup-
ported against vertical and lateral
displacement at the left end and at
6 feet from the right end. The beam
is subjected to a vertical downward
load of W at its right end and a
transverse horizontal load of W at
6 feet from its left end.
What is the magnitude of W if the
maximum tensile or compressive
stress is not to exceed 1200 pounds
per sq. inch?
6. A rectangular flume of smooth con-
crete, 10 feet wide, takes water from
a reservoir. The bottom of the flume
at entrance end is 3 feet lower in
elevation than the water surface in
the reservoir when the water is
static. What should be the slope of
the bottom of the flume so that the
maximum possible discharge may be
transported by the flume at a con-
stant depth and what is this dis-
charge?

the other one foot diameter, whose
centers are 4 feet apart are con-
nected by a belt so that the pulleys
revolve in the same direction. The
coefficient of friction between the
pulleys and the belt is 0.5. If the
tension in the slack side of the belt
is 100 Ibs. when the other tension is
a maximum, and the larger pulley
has a speed of 3000 R.P.M. what is
the maximum horse power that can
be transmitted?
What difference would it make if
the belt were crossed so that the
pulleys would revolve in opposite
directions, the other data remaining
the same?

LeROY WEINSTEIN, '49E
Since its inception in 1903 the Bureau
of Reclamation has become the best dam
engineering organization in the world.
The need for redistribution of water in
the western states has been apparent for
nearly a century. Originally local irri-
gation projects were financed by private
enterprise. As the technology and agri-
cultural significance of irrigation matured
the need for more extensive projects was
recognized. Small governmental bodies
were able to finance some of the projects
but it fell to the Federal Government to
organize and promote irrigation on its
present scale.
In the past 45 years the Bureau of
Reclamation has built more than 150
dams. The number of dams does not
truly indicate the magnitude of the work
done because there are incidental struc-
tures that must be built or replaced by
the Bureau whenever a dam is construct-
ed. Railroad tracks and highways have
to be replaced when the impounded
waters flood them out. Canals, pumping
plants, switching yards, and electric sub-
stations, all incidental to the dam, are
structure of large cost.
In many cases cableway towers and
other structures built to aid in the con-



LeRoy Weinstein
The article editor of the Technic, LeRoy
Weinstein, was first introduced to the
University of Michigan campus through
an Army Training Program in the summer
of 1944. After completing nine months in
the engineering curriculum Lee saw serv-
ice in the Pacific with the 1408 Engineers.
After his discharge from the army he re-
turned to the campus to continue his
specialization in civil engineering.
Last summer the Bureau of Reclamation
opened a student training program and
Lee was one of three U. of M. students
to accept positions with the Bureau. A
summer in the Denver design and con-
struction office of the Bureau has given
him first-hand knowledge of the organi-
zation.
Though his future plans are still in-
definite, Lee hopes to work in the vicinity
of Chicago.
Concrete Placement Operations
Shasta Dam
struction of the dam are dwarfed only by
the size of the dam itself. The cableway
headtower of Shasta Dam used in con-
crete placement was 460 feet high (about
the height of a 40 story building). Per-
haps the best way to illustrate the vast size
of the Bureau work is to quote from one
of their recent publications reviewing
the scope of the Columbia Basin Project:
"Ultimately, this project will bring
under irrigation about 1,000,000 acres of
land, as well as provide a generating
capacity of over 2,000,000 kilowatts of
much needed low-cost power.
"The key structure for the project is
Coulee Dam, which will conserve water
necessary for irrigation and power, as
well as regulate the river for improve-
ment of navigation and power generation
downstream. On the downstream face of
the dam, one on each side of the river,
are power plants, each capable of housing
nine generators rated at 108,000 kilo-
watts. The pumping plant, located just
upstream from the dam structure on the
west abutment, will lift water 20 feet
from the reservoir into the Grand Coulee
equalizing reservoir, from which the water
will flow by gravity through a vast sys-
tem of canals, siphons, tunnels, natural
water courses, and other features, on to
the farm-lands.
"The unprecedented proportions of
Coulee Dam intensified all of the usual
problems of design. The dam itself was
designed as a straight gravity-mass con-
crete structure. It is 550 feet high and
in excess of 4,500 feet in length at the
crest, and is the largest structure ever
built by man."
Projects of this size can be successfully
attempted only by an organization of
many specialists all working in very close
cooperation. With this in view the
Bureau has divided its design and con-

General View—

struction office in Denver, Colorado, into
various divisions, each of which is fur-
ther segregated into sections. The dam
engineering division, for example, is
broken down into seven sections. One of
them is responsible for the design of
spillways, another for the outlet works,
a third is concerned with contracts and
specifications, and so on.
The design work in any one of these
sections calls for communication and

code, what would you do if you were to
observe another student cheating on an
examination?
Asked of engineering students around
the campus.
Bob Lafferty, '5IE
"If I did catch anyone cheating on an
exam I would turn him in. He would
only be taking unfair advantage of the
honor code, and it just wouldn't be fair
to me or the other students. If I myself
were to cheat and be caught, I would ex-
pect whoever caught me to turn me in, so
the same goes for anyone else."
Ronald Wilcox, '50E
"Well, I wouldn't ever be looking for
anything like that, but if I should see it,
don't think I would
let him get away
with it. I wouldn't
turn him in, but I
would talk to him
myself. You're only
hurting yourself if
you let him get away
with it. If he is go-
ing to get a better
grade by cheating it
will only raise the average, and that
would be unfair to me."
Paul Fontana, '50E
"As far as I'm concerned, everything
here is based on competition. It is no true
sign of student's
abilty to get a better
grade on an examin-
ation if he gets it by
cheating. It just isn't
fair to the whole
group, what it is,
is unfair competi-
tion. If I did catch
someone cheating on
an examination I'd
tell him to stop, that's all. I don't think
I'd turn him in."
Herman Ulbrich, '5IE
"I believe that is something all up to
the individual. I know that I myself
would never cheat on an examination. If
another fellow is going to cheat, that is
strictly his own business. It certainly
by
Barnet Frommer '51E



wouldn't be doing me any good, since
grades are the standpoint from which we
are measured; but anyway, I wouldn't
turn him in.
A. H. Blessing
"After all, the students asked for the
honor code, and so
it's our job to make
it work. If a stu-
dent can cheat on an
examination and get
away with it the
whole system breaks
down. The honor
code is a good code,
we should try to
keep it. I would
be inclined to turn him in."
Don Joslyn, '50E
"Well, the first time I saw anybody
cheating I don't think I'd turn him in. I
certainly would speak to him, though.
If he kept on cheating I would turn him
in.
John Sundin, '50E
"I don't think I'd do anything at first.
I would talk to him
about it, but I
wouldn't turn him
in. If he kept right
on cheating through
other exams I think
I would turn him in.
But I don't believe
in crucifying a man
for making one mis-
take. We're all only
human, and everybody is entitled to one
chance anyway.
Louis Fotola, '5IE
"If I did catch anyone cheating I
wouldn't turn him in. If a fellow does
make a mistake it's too much to throw
him out of school. That would ruin his
whole future.
Question: Under the present honor
code, what course of action would you
advise a student to take should he observe
another student cheating on an examina-
tion?
Professor G. B. Gordy
"If a student observes another student
to be cheating on an examination he
shpuld report such student to the Student

Honor Committee. The students asked for
the honor system; it's up to them to make
it work. Furthermore, the students must
abide by the code. Because cheating was
so rampant during the war, the engineer-
ing college at the suggestion of the Stu-
dent Honor Committee chose to discard
temporarily the honor code. After the
termination of the war the code was re-
instated. However, if we are forced to
discard the code again it will likely be for
good."
Professor Axel Marin
"When a student observes some action
or behavior during a written quiz which
appears to be cheating, he announces,
"Things are not right in this exam, and
if they are not corrected I will do some-
think about it.' The ^^^^^^^^_
guilt)' party will be
indicted by his own
conscience; he won't
dare confront you
with any denials for
that would be an
admission of guil.
The honor code is
not designed to pre-
vent cheating. No
system can prevent cheating. The honor
code assures that a student is honest until
he proves himself to be dishonest. The
proctor system is quite otherwise.
W. C. Nelson
"My small children are in the lower
grades. In that stage they are watched
constantly, but here in college students are
not small children. If students who cheat
are to be graduated, then professional
ethics will break down right where we
should be instilling
in students a sense of
professional ethics.
Professional ethics
exist in our profes-
sion just as they do
in the medical pro-
fession. The faculty
is also under the
honor code. It is the
job of the members
of the faculty to help develop in students
a respect for the promises that men
live by.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


— METAL PROCESSING —
by
WILLIAM O. READING, '52E
Since the establishment nearly 30 years
ago of a department of the University of
Michigan devoted exclusively to indus-
trial-scientific research, the work of that
department, now the Engineering Re-
search Institute, has held through the
years an immediately practical aspect for-
eign to many research groups. This prac-
ticality is, in essence, the anticipated end
function of the Institute as a research
body serving industry.
A few years ago, the nation's industry
was emerging from the comparative calm
of manufacturing for a world at peace
to the mighty tempo of production for
war. A crucial obstacle to the attainment
of that incredible pace lay in the absence
of comprehensive data and standard for
the various factors involved in the ma-
chining of metals.
Realizing this lack, the War Produc-
tion Board brought the entire problem to
the attention of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers. With funds pro-
vided by WPB, the Engineering Manu-
facturing Committee of ASME placed
contracts with several university research
groups and other similar organizations to
find some of the answers to problems
arising in every war industry as the pres-
sure increased.
The University of Michigan was a logi-
cal choice for a large portion of this work,
and the Engineering Research Institute
was called upon specifically to establish
operating standards, and to determine
what constitutes good commercial practice
in the machining of cast iron and ferrous
metals using cutting tools in the three
major groups: 1) cast non-ferrous metals;
2) high-speed steels; 3) sintered car-
bides.
Presented with the problems outlined
above, the Institute's Department of Metal
Processing, headed by Professor O. W.
Boston, began an intensive and carefully
projected program of investigations. En-
countered and solved were such problems
as the conditions under which tools of the
three groups gave optimum performance,
and the range through which each type of
tool could maintain this performance in
machining various metals. The prepara-
tion of tools was studied, both in the
initial stages of welding, brazing, and
induction heating, and also in the critical
process of grinding to the correct angle.
The machines used in research occa-
sionally had to be adapted to the prob-
lem at hand. For example, in order to
promote the rigidity essential to good
required at varying speeds and depths
of cutting, and this factor was measured
very accurately by means of a recording
wattmeter. Surface finish was observed
during operations, with the aid of a
profilometer, a remarkable instrument
which makes possible measurements in
millionths of an inch.
Cutting fluids, or coolants, were also
studied, and in this connection the inter-

performance at high speeds with the sin-
tered carbides, a flywheel was installed
on the shaft of the milling machine used
in most of the tests.
Following methods of research devel-
oped on other Institute projects, and
evolving new techniques as the work pro-
gressed, Professor Boston and his research
team set up typical machining problems.
The questions of how tools fail, and at
what point they become inefficient were
investigated, and a criterion for tool fail-
ure was established. Another important
factor in milling operations is the power
csting fact was established that in work
with high-speed steels and cast non-fer-
rous tools, coolants are conducive to
longer tool life and a higher quality of
surface finish, but are a detriment to the
wearing qualities of sintered carbide tools.
The efforts of the Department of Metal
Processing produced a great wealth of in-
formation which then had to be analyzed,
interpreted, and presented in the form of
a report to industry. The typical report
usually consisted of graphs and photo-
graphic illustrations accompanied by dt-

IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
by
ROGER KUEHL '49E
Within the past quarter of a century,
engineering contracting has undergone a
vast change, both in number and type of
personnel required. This change has
occurred because the increase in engineer-
ing activities has developed to such an
extent that no longer is it possible for
one man to know all phases of contract-
ing well enough to conduct a successful
business. Twenty-five years ago, it was
possible for a qualified man to begin as
a laborer and eventually rise to the posi-
tion of a superintendent or possibly an
executive. At the present time, however,
various factors combine to make such
efforts impossible. Labor unions have re-
duced the likelihood of a man attaining
the necessary variety of experience to
become familiar with all phases of con-
tracting.
Recognizing this fact, contracting con-
cerns have in recent years been drawing
more and more of their superintendents
and executives from the ranks of young
graduate engineers. These men, of neces-
sity, have had little experience in any one
phase of contracting. Upon being grad-
uated, the most common procedure for
Roger Kuehl
the young engineer is to begin as an esti-
mator, or a field engineer, or possibly an
instrument man, and then rise to the posi-
tion of superintendent. This procedure is
unavoidable, considering the specializa-
tion to which the contracting industry is
subject today.
It has become increasingly evident that
a successful contractor must be not only
View of Shasta Dam Area Showing Excavation for River Diversion
an engineer, but also a trained business
man. Contracting is essentially a business,
and it follows that a contractor must be a
business man. The intense competition in
the contracting business demands that the
contractor be familiar with labor rela-
tions, cost analysis, legal aspects of engi-
neering, business administration and eco-
nomics. Because of the increased power
of labor unions, the contracting executive
must know labor relations and how to
deal with the unions; the desire to make
the lowest bid possible compels a knowl-
edge of cost analysis; legal questions arise
more frequently as the number and mag-
nitude of contracts grow larger, and the
desire to avoid unnecessary litigation de-
mands a working knowledge of engineer-
ing law; throughout the whole scheme
of things runs the question of the best
economic design. It should now be clear
that when a contractor hires a graduate
engineer, he wants to hire also a man
with considerable training in business and
economics. Such knowledge is necessary,
and it can be acquired in one of two
ways: either by experience, or by intelli-
gent formal education.
In the recent past, the civil engineering
curriculum in many universities has
stressed theory and design to a very great
extent, and little, if any, emphasis has
been put on the economic and business
facts of contracting. As a result, the
graduating civil engineer was just that
and nothing more—a qualified and com-
petent engineer, but lacking in formal
business training. Construction is, and
will remain, the most important single
function of a contracting organization,
but construction is not all there is to
contracting.
The University of Michigan has recog-
nized the need for and has designed a
new construction option in the Civil Engi-
neering curriculum which is intended not
only to give the engineer training in
theory and design, but to supplement
such knowledge with training in cost
analysis, construction methods, business
management, and labor relations. The

"Yes, it will. And that would be true of almost
any course you'd name.
"That's because varied abilities are required.
The telephone system has mechanical engi-
neers, electrical engineers, civil engineers, and
so forth. Some are in development or research,
and make contributions in these fields. More
are in the operating end. They deal with eco-
nomic as well as technical problems, handle
personnel, and assume other responsibilities
gained as their careers progress.
"In other words, telephony has many inter-
esting jobs. To prepare for one of them, learn
your particular branch of engineering and gain
as much all-around knowledge as you can."

Electron microscope, perfected at RCA Laboratories, reveals
hitherto hidden facts about the structure of bacteria.
Bacteria bigger than a Terrier
Once scientists, exploring the invisi-
ble, worked relatively "blind." Few
microscopes magnified more than
1500 diameters. Many bacteria, and
almost all viruses, remained invisible.
Then RCA scientists opened new windows
into a hidden world—with the first com-
mercially practical electron microscope. In
the laboratory this instrument has reached
magnifications of 200,000 diameters and
over. 100,000 is commonplace ...
To understand such figures, picture
this: A man magnified 200,000 times
could lie with his head in Washington,
D. C, and his feet in New York. ... A
hair similarly magnified would appear as
large as the Washington Monument.
Scientists not only see bacteria, but also
viruses—and have even photographed a mole-
cule! Specialists in other fields—such as
industry, mining, agriculture, forestry—have
learned unsuspected truths about natural
resources.
Development of the electron micro-
scope as a practical tool of science, medi-
cine, and industry is another example of
RCA research at work. This leadership is
part of all instruments bearing the names
RCA, and RCA Victor.

Whoever it was that first said, "You
can't keep a good thing down" must have
had the A.S.M.E. in mind. For during
this present semester this organization
has made tremendous strides in all of
its endeavors. Capacity crowds of "slide-
rule jockeys" turned out for every func-
tion from informal smokers to technical
movies. The distinguished speaker, Dr.
R. O. Fehr, research director of General
Electric, received an enthusiastic welcome
at his lecture on "Vibrations and Noise."
In addition an enlightening glimpse into
what the future has in store was given
to the A.S.M.E. members on a fascinat-
ing tour of the General Motors Diesel
plant.
The annual A.S.M.E. banquet and final
business meeting will climax this success-
ful semester. Our constantly growing
membership, which in the past six months
has increased from 230 to 299 members,
promises an even greater future for the

flight testing of the latest jets to the
study of air flow over airfoils by means
of smoke. The group will see engineer-
ing in action when it takes its planned
field trips to Detroit and to Wright Field,
Dayton, Ohio.
The program for the remainder of the

An interesting and informative group
of meetings and plant trips is being pro-
vided by the student chapter of the Amer-

ican Institute of Chemical Engineers this
year.
The second meeting was held on No-
vember 9, and presented Mr. W. M.
Yates of the Dow Chemical Patents De-
partment. He told the members of the
opportunities of the patents field in
Chemical Engineering.
The student AIChE chapter is plan-
ning one day of plant trips per month,
throughout the school year.
On the first plant trip, October 22,
these Chemical Engineers went through
Sharpies Chemical Corp. (manufacturers
of organic products) of Wyandotte,
Michigan, and DuPont's Grasselli sulfuric

Professional Practice in a
Difficult World
Most graduates find themselves in an
entirely new atmosphere when first start-
ing work as engineers for a company. In
view of this situation, the Engineering
College is attempting to acquaint its stu-
dents with the character of this atmo-
sphere prior to their graduation. In this
way, it is the hope of the University that
the graduate may so guide his profes-
sional career as to develop his talents to
the fullest extent and make the most
honorable use of them.
Information concerning all phases of
the Engineering Profession is made avail-
able to the student at weekly round-table
discussions. Once each week 20 to 25
Senior engineering students convene by
invitation to listen to, and discuss, the
experiences and observations of an out-
standing man in the engineering world,
who is invited to the discussion as guest
speaker. The number of invitations sent
for a particular meeting is controlled by
the Student Committee for Professional
Practice, and is purposely limited so as
to enable a more intense participation in
the discussion by each student than would
be possible in a larger meeting. These
panel discussions last for about 90
minutes, of which roughly the first third
speaker. The remainder of the time is
is devoted to an address by the guest
taken up with questions from the stu-
dents, and is the most productive and in-
teresting part of the meeting. The guest
speaker answers these questions in terms
of his wide experience. As a result a
highly informative opinion is rendered on
all subjects discussed.
A recent panel discussion considered
the following questions, among others:
"What are the important things an inter-
viewer looks for at a company interview
of graduating seniors?" The speaker
stressed the importance of personal ap-
pearance. Except for a brief look at the
student's grade record, and a few minutes
of conversation, the appearance of the
prospect is all the interviewer has as a
criterion for appraisal. Another import-
ant thing, to be avoided by the student,
"is the carefree "show me" attitude so
commonly displayed, for example, by
referring to some phase of the company's
work as a "game". These are little things,
it's true, but one who is careless about
little things is often a careless worker.
Another question was "What shall I do
if I feel that I am being 'pigeon-holed',
or passed-over for promotion in a com-
pany?" The speaker gave one approach
to the problem that he had seen work
many times, and it was this: go to the
highest possible man in the company, and
explain your feelings in the matter. Then
ask him what he thinks you should do to
correct your mistakes, so that you will be
ready for the next promotion. He will
gladly give you some good advice, and
also keep an eye on you to see if you are
carrying out this advice.
These are a few of the many topics
discussed in these meetings. All engi-
neers are strongly urged to accept the
invitation to attend one of these meetings
when one is offered.
Student moderators are William
Duerre, Jack Harrington, Karl Henion II,
Robert Justice, Bruce Paxton, and Phillip
Stemmer. Guest speakers for the first
two meetings of this year were A. F.
Plant, Vice-President of the Austin Com-
pany, and R. B. Schroeder, Personnel Di-
rector for Bell Telephone.

Science paints
the future
41 of every 1,000 U. S. chemists are
engaged in production of paints,
lacquers, varnishes and colors
Modern paint making is an outstand-
ing example of chemistry at work—
of the way the scientific approach
has replaced rule-of-thumb methods.
Today, paints are formulated by
chemists to meet specific needs. In
their search for better finishes, these
highly trained technical men are aided
by the electron microscope and infra-
red spectroscope. A variety of gonio-
Rust would quickly weaken thin structun: Be-
cause "Dulux" resists salt water and salt air,
it has for years protected many famous bridges,
photometric and spectrophotometric
devices are used by the physicist and
physical chemist in the study of gloss
and color.
Du Pont men have produced many
superior finishes. One of them,
"Dulux" nitrocellulose lacquer, made
mass production of automobiles pos-
sible by shortening paint drying time
from weeks to hours.
Finish failures — chipping and
scratching—were costing manufac-
turers of home refrigerators a million
dollars a year before Du Pont chem-
ists developed "Dulux" synthetic
resin enamels, based on alkyd resins.
A "Dulux" coating on metal or wood
dries into a film that even a hammer
blow won't break. Tests with me-
chanical scrubbers prove it outwears
old-style enamels by more than five
times. "Dulux" enamels now guard
boats, large and small, as well as
petroleum tank farms, machinery and
other industrial installations.
At Du Font's paint laboratories, a
wide ran ge of materials is under study.
Where the colloid chemist, the phys-
ical and organic chemist, the analyst,
physicist and other technically
trained men leave off, the chemical
engineer, mechanical engineer and
metallurgist stand ready to design
equipment to make better commer-
cial production possible.

The freshman turned to the young
engineer who was showing him through
the locomotive works.
"What's that big thing over there?"
"That's a locomotive boiler."
The frosh scratched his head. "Why do
they want to boil the locomotives?"
Without batting an eye, the engineer
fired the reply: "To make the locomotive
tender."

The stout lady on the scale was eagerly

dropped in her cent, but the machine was
out of order—it registered only 75

"Good night, Bill," gasped one of

The designer bent across his board;
wonderful things in his mind were
stored.
And he said as he rubbed his throbbing
bean,
"How can I make this tough to ma-

If this part here were only straight, I'm
sure the thing would work first rate.
But 'twould be so easy to machine and

It would never make the machinist sore.
I'd better put in a right angle there;
then watch those babies tear their hair.
Now I'll put the holes that hold the cap

This piece don't work, I'll bet a buck;
for it can't be held in a shoe or chuck.
It can't be drilled or it can't be ground!
In fact the design is exceedingly
sound!"
He looked again, and he cried, "At last!
Success is mine; it can't be cast!"
Once upon a time, so the story goes,
the fence between Heaven and Hell broke
down. St. Peter appeared at the broken
section and called out to the devil:
"Hey, Satan," he said, "since all the engi-
neers are over in your place, how about
getting them to fix this fence?"
"Sorry," replied Satan, "My men are
all too busy to go about fixing measly
fences."
"Well, then," replied St. Peter, "I'll
have to sue you if you don't."
"Oh yeah," countered the devil, "where
are you going to get a lawyer?"

We were skeptical ourselves when our
photographer ran up to us and breath-
lessly announced his "amazing inven-
tion." By choosing all the words between
the superlatives, we gathered that his in-
vention was amazing, indeed; he had per-
fected a camera which took pictures in
terms of analytical geometry!
Now we, the editors of the MICHIGAN
TECHNIC, are exemplary products of an
engineering education—we examine facts
and keep our feet planted solidly on our
desks. But one look at the print he
showed us convinced us of the existence
of the camera.
So it is, reader, that we present a nega-
tive of the TECHNIC'S favorite pin-up,
Anna Lyttlegal, who poses exclusively for
our pages. The negative, you will notice
is made up of points, lines, and curves.
Plotting these on the film, you will meet
our comely Anna.
Anna's lines are defined by their end-
points; her curves are well-defined—by
equations. The earring Anna wears was
given to her by her cousin, Paula—Paula
Coordinate, that is.
Well, dear reader, here is Anna Lyttle-
gal. Have as much fun developing her
as we did. For best results we recom-
mend the use of a light room.

sible one opening must do the work of

several. Perhaps a minor rearrangement
of the units within can help reduce the
number of openings required, but one
must at the same time take into account
loading and balancing of the aircraft.
Not only is the number of openings a
problem of design, but also is the design
of the covering, or door. The type of
fastening for the door may present factors
for compromise. It is most desirable to
fasten the door in such a manner as to
cause minimum expenditure of time in
removal and subsequent replacement.
There are in use several patent fastenings
which fulfill this requirement quite satis-
factorily. However, should the skin be-
under stress in that region, it might be
necessary to fasten down the door by
means of machine screws or by some other
means more capable of transmitting stress.
Another problem for consideration: is
the door to be hinged to the structure
proper or fastened throughout its
entire periphery? Again, other factors
tend to modify a decision. The door will
consist mainly of a section of sheet metal
to fair the opening to the contour. Re-
peated opening and closing will soon
warp the contour of what is only thin
sheet metal. The door may, however, be
reinforced by means of stiffeners on the
inner surface. Obviously, the addition of
stiffeners will multiply the cost of pro-
ducing the door—as well as adding that
burdensome extra ounce of weight.
Nevertheless, since the warping of the
door would disturb the smooth contour
of that region, and add to parasite drag,
some means of prevention of warping is
to be desired.
One must always bear in mind that the
repetition of maintenance operations
causes physical erosion of the metal parts.
Thus, resistance to wear is another factor
for consideration in the selection of ma-
terial for a part. Very often, in the mat-
ing of a threaded member to a soft part—
aluminum or magnesium alloy—the soft
part will be bushed with a collar of a
harder metal, the collar being threaded to
take the member. In this manner, the
parts may be taken apart time after time
with minimum danger of stripping the

HERE is a man who can put your name
in lights! In sign shops throughout
the country he makes the neon signs that
tell you where to buy the things you need
or want. The low cost and colorful eye-
appeal of these versatile signs give the
smallest storekeeper the same display op-
portunities as his biggest competitors.
The letters that spell "drugs" or "gro-
ceries", "beer" or "ice cream", are shaped
by skillful hands out of glass tubing made
by Corning. The tubing is made Iroui a
special glass developed by Corning research,
with many characteristics not found in
ordinary glass. With the help of skilled
operators, hundreds of miles of this tubing
are drawn by automatic machine everyday.
Out of this same research, born of nearly
a hundred years of glass-making experience,
has come the improved laboratory ware
that helped America win world leadership
in science. The gleaming Pyrex ware that
bakes pies like Mother used to make, and
saves dishwashing time because it can be
used for serving and storing too. And now
the many special tubes and other precision
glass parts that are speeding television to
your home.
Altogether, Corning makes over 37,000
glass products. Some day they may furnish
just what you need to improve your product
or make it more saleable. Remember us then.

sometimes compromises with other sec-
tions. In some dams the spillway and out-
let works are combined. Give and take is
essential on the part of both sections so
that the final product will have the fea-
tures that each section feels are essential.
Close contact must be kept with other
divisions of the design office as experts in
each field are called on to design small
parts of the dam, which must fit together
and work as a smooth-functioning struc-
ture.
The lack of precedent in most of the
Reclamation structures makes large re-
search laboratories essential. Tests must
be made on each important design in
order to be sure that the structure will
act in the manner anticipated. The usual
procedure in making tests is to carefully
make a scale model of the proposed struc-
ture. Then the model is subjected to con-
ditions similar to those expected. Careful
observations are made and designs are
modified on the basis of the experimental
results. The models are then changed to
conform with the new design and the
procedure is repeated.

Experiments in more basic research are also made by the Bureau's laboratories.
The paint and chemical section devotes much of its time to the development of new
paints and protective coatings needed for unusual conditions. An interesting develop-
ment of the electrical research section is a metal-detecting device.
The device was created in response to the problem of locating
reinforcing bars in completed structures. This information is
essential when drillings are necessary in reinforced concrete.
Working along the lines of the Army's detector a metal detector
was designed. This detector is only slightly larger than a cane
and its portable power unit can be carried by one person. The
detector sounds a loud tone when near metal and is sensitive
enough to pick out individual reinforcing bars when they are
spaced at intervals as close as three inches.
The Bureau's laboratories are often called upon to make tests
for other governmental agencies. Close cooperation with the
Corps of Engineers, TVA and other dam builders is maintained.
Whenever feasible a flood-control dam being built by the Corps
of Engineers is integrated as part of an irrigation project. Like-
wise, the Bureau of Reclamation considers flood control an
important design consideration.
The actual construction work is usually done by contractors.
Cooperation between the builder and designer is not hampered
by this situation. Both the contractor and the Bureau engineer
feel that they are working together on something of real im-
portance. The precision of construction is startling. For example,
the Alva B. Adams tunnel (13.03 miles long) was out of line
only 7/16 of an inch when completed.
The Bureau of Reclamation, in its vast irrigation program,
has not lost sight of the individual engineer. At the present
time, work and study programs for men interested in advanced
degrees and a student training program for undergraduates are
in operation.
The Bureau's task is fundamentally the same as the task of any
engineer— "developing and making wise use of our natural
resources."

Temperature Ranges Required for Pressure Vessels
at BLACK, SIVALLS &amp; BRYSON, Inc.
Demonstrate Controllability of
Safety codes govern many of the manufacturing and
testing methods for pressure vessels. One of the most
important processes, stress relieving, requires precise
control of temperatures throughout the cycle—just the
type of temperature control to be found in thousands
of industrial applications of GAS for heat treating.
Specialists in the manufacture of pressure vessels
depend on GAS for heat processing or all types. The
pioneering firm of Black, Sivalls and Bryson, Inc.,
Kansas City, uses GAS in the manufacture of tanks,
valves, pressure vessels and safety heads. President
A. J. Smith says,
"Throughout the past 25 years we have
depended on GAS to provide the exacting

temperatures for our work. In many of our
plants we have developed special GAS equip-
ment; our large stress-relieving furnace at
Oklahoma City is a typical example."
this large furnace the GAS control system is ar-
ranged to provide temperatures up to 1200° F. for any
time-cycle required. Automatic regulators and record-
ing pyrometers assure maximum fuel efficiency while
the flexibility of GAS is an important factor in main-
taining production schedules on vital equipment.
Stress-relieving is just one of the applications of
GAS for heat processing. You'll find hundreds of
other uses for the productive flames of GAS—they're
worth investigating.

its accessories must be arranged in the

the process of engine change, the unit, or

An excellent idea that was long over-
due was the code-coloring of wires and
tubing lines throughout the airplane.
Each line is provided near each junction
with a colored band which identifies
positively the line with respect to the sys-
tem to which it belongs. To each system
is assigned its own code color, for ex-
ample, red for fuel lines, yellow for
engine lubricating oil, etc. A tremendous
saving of time is made in not having to


trace arduously the line from its source—

When a piece of pipe gets hot, it "grows"

when cold. If this expansion should be
crowded back into the piping system, it
would cause destructive strains, lowering the
safety factor of the entire system. The pipe
must be allowed to rise.
A unique type of hanger to support the
pipe is needed. As the pipe rises the hangers
must maintain the same lift, because the pipe
weighs just as much hot as it does cold.
That hanger is the Grinnell Constant-

region under consideration. It is all very
well to design a bolted joint, having
made certain to allow ample clearance
around both heads for wrenches. But if
other members deny the mechanic easy
access to the nut and bolt, then the care-
ful planning of the engineer is nullified.
Indeed, the mechanic would be like the
motorist who strides up to his locked car,
bearing the ignition key but not the key
to the door of the car. Quite often suffi-
cient entry to a maintained member can
be achieved simply by rearranging adja-
cent structural members. By way of illus-
tration: the aileron of a certain experi-
mental fighter plane (never placed in
production, though doubtless not for this
reason) was hinged to the wing proper in
such a manner that while there was sur-
rounding the nut sufficient whench clear-
ance, the mechanic had to squeeze the
wrench through an opening barely wide
enough for the wrench and only long
enough to accommodate movement of
the wrench sufficient for a fraction of a
revolution of the nut per stroke. Re-
placement of the aileron took more than

ten man hours.. A cursory inspection of the meagre opening
showed that if the angle-sections at either end of the opening
had been placed on the other sides of the plate to which they
were rivetted, the space for tool travel would have been
doubled, thereby greatly reducing the excessive time consumed
in change of the aileron.
At this point it is well to make clear that the writer does
not mean to criticize engineers in general nor any engineer in
particular, either for the above example or for any other
seemingly flagrant violation of the principle of which he
writes. Upon encountering any maintenance operation made
more difficult by the nature of the design, it is next to impos-
sible to be able to visualize all factors which can not be dis-
regarded. Thus, one must tend to reserve judgment.
The engineer does well to bear in mind that maintenance
operations must be adapted to standard tools, rather than
requiring the acquisition of special tools. In many instances
this is virtually impossible. However, quite often the occa-
sion will arise in which the application of a little ingenuity
(which is the engineer's stock-in-trade) will mean that a
standard tool may be used instead of putting the operator
to the expense of a special tool.
In conclusion therefore, there are factors of design of an
airplane which may not be disregarded—not the least im-
portant of which is allowance for maintenance. At best, one
can effect only the most satisfactory compromise of all factors
in question. The engineer must draw from his ingenuity as
well as whatever knowledge of maintenance procedures he is
fortunate enough to possess. Ideally, the experience of a
few years as an airplane mechanic would be invaluable. This
however is seldom possible. The engineer must, then, rely-
on a three-dimensional imagination and on his ingenuity.
These qualities are the possessions of a better engineer.

READING
FOR ALUMNI

THEN YOU GRADUATE, your faithful slip-stick will go
with you—required reading throughout your working years.
You'll take some of your textbooks with you, too, to help
you go places in business. Many of these will undoubtedly
bear the McGraw-Hill name—since McGraw-Hill is head-
quarters for technical information.
To your reference shelf of reliable McGraw-Hill books, add
the McGraw-Hill magazine devoted to your particular field.
For example, if you're studying to be an electrical en-
gineer, you probably knowTerman's Radio Engineers'Hand-
book, Henny's Radio Engineering Handbook or Knowlton's
Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers. If you're going
to be a mechanical engineer, it's very likely that you've used
Marks'Mechanical Engineers' Handbook and other McGraw-
Hill books in this field.
When you're launched on your engineering career, get to
know your McGraw-Hill magazine — such as Electronics,
Electrical World, Electrical Construction &amp;: Maintenance,
American Machinist, or Power.
McGraw-Hill books and magazines cover practically every
conceivable phase of business and industry. They'll help you
do a better job.

diately enthusiastic. Many manufacturers
reported that the information had proved
to be of material aid in speeding produc-
tion and increasing operating efficiency.
The graphic form of presentation simpli-
fied and condensed much of the highly
technical data, and, in many cases, made
it possible to predict factors outside the
scope of the actual research work.
The Manufacturing Engineering Com-
mittee and WPB were much gratified by
the results of the project, and the Navy
considered the work of sufficient import-
ance to finance it for another year after
the expiration of the WPB contract.
Since then, equipment and personnel of
the Metal Processing Department have
been engaged continuously on similar
research for the Metal Cutting Tool In-
stitute, an organization of cutting tool
manufacturers.
The original reports of the Institute are
still gaining wide circulation and appre-
ciation. It is interesting to note here
that the same information which pro-
moted increased production in wartime,
when cost was a minor consideration,
serves as a guide to greater efficiency in
competitive industry today, where the
factor of cost can mean the difference be-
tween successful operation and failure.

basis for the new option was a report sub-
mitted on May 13, 1948 by Professors
Housel, Alt, and Sherlock. Letters from
graduates plus other data submitted by
contractors indicated that at least half of
the civil engineers graduating from
Michigan found positions in construction,
as distinguished from pure design work.
To meet the obvious needs of future grad-
uates who will be concerned with con-
tracting, the construction option was set
up. Invaluable aid was given by Mr.
Curt Bottum of the Michigan Chapter of
the Associated General Contractors of
America, through whose interest students
have been given opportunities for sum-
mer employment in connection with the
newly devised program. The new option
was first offered at the beginning of the
fall semester of 1948 at both under-
graduate and graduate levels. The under-
graduate program makes no alteration in
the basic preparatory, secondary, and
technical courses required of all civil
engineers. The option for undergraduates
includes the following courses:
CE131—Cost Analysis and Estimating
CE132—Construction Methods and
Equipment
Choice of a civil engineering design
course
One of the following courses:
CE135—Applied Soil Mechanics
Bus Ad 2—Introduction to Business
Management
CE181—Legal Aspects of Engineering
The graduate program leading to an
MSE with special concentration in con-
struction engineering consists of a 30-
hour course of study with emphasis on
both engineering and business.
This new option is devoted to the
same aim as all of the options in civil
engineering: to develop basically a civil
engineer. The courses in the construc-
tion option offer an opportunity for the
prospective civil engineer to do some
specialization.

How to keep a tandem roller
from doing the shimmy
The king pin bearings on tandem road rollers like
this take heavy thrust and radial loads. If wear and
looseness develop, shimmy is the result. Here's another
example of a difficult problem that engineers solve by
using Timken tapered roller bearings.
Timken bearings take both thrust and radial loads
in any combination. Their true rolling motion means
smooth, almost frictionless operation with negligible
wear. Easy, accurate steering and freedom from shimmy
are assured, even after years of hard service. The need
for frequent lubrication is eliminated and maintenance
is reduced to a minimum.
Here's why Timken rollers
stay in positive alignment
Accurate and constant roller alignment in Timken
tapered roller bearings is assured by their design. Wide
area contact between the roll ends and the rib of the cone
keeps the rollers stable. It prevents skewing, eliminates
the need for alignment by the cage, and increases load
capacity.
The Timken Roller Bearing Company developed the
principle of positive roller alignment—one more reason
why Timken bearings are the number one choice of
engineers everywhere.

ultra fax
A new system of television communi-
cation called Ultrafax has been presented
to the public. Ultrafax was developed by
RCA Laboratories in cooperation with
the Eastman Kodak Company and the
National Broadcasting Company. Ultra-
fax can transmit written or printed mes-
sages at the rate of a million words per
minute, and is also capable of transmit-
ting a wide variety of graphic material
including charts, fingerprints, news and
advertising layouts, and items ranging
from historical documents to complex
atomic formulae, technical drawings, and
battle maps. In a demonstration, "Gone
With the Wind" was transmitted word
for word in its entirety in about two min-
utes from transmitter to receiver.
This remarkable speed is possible be-
cause full pages of information are trans-
mitted as television pictures at the rate
of from 15 to 30 a second. The principle
steps in transmitting and receiving by
Ultrafax are:
1. Preparation of data to be trans-
mitted, to assure a continuous,

high-speed flow.
2. Scanning of this data by a "flying-
spot"

signals over a
micro-wave radio-relay system.
4. Reception on projection-type tele-
vision kinescope, or "picture tube,"
from which incoming messages are
recorded on motion picture film, or
ultimately directly onto photo-
graphic paper.
At the end of a transmission, the ex-
posed film can be transferred quickly to
a special processing unit developed by
Kodak Research Laboratories. The film
is passed through a miniature developing
tank, rinsed, and fixed in less than 15
seconds and dried in 25 seconds more.
The Ultrafax film may be enlarged to
full-sized copy by means of a high speed
continuous processing machine. There is
no limit to the number of Ultrafax
messages which may be printed from a
single film.

salt dilemma
Motorists alternately bless and curse
the salt used by many towns and cities
for ice and snow removal. They hate
getting stuck on an icy street or highway,
but fear the corrosive effects of salt on
their fenders and car underbodies.
Municipal, township, county and state
officials frequently express similar fears
with regard to what salt may do to
bridges, guard rails, and other metal road-
side structures.
Salt is preferable to other materials
because of its effectiveness as a melting
agent, and because it does not clog storm
sewerage. Result: Dilemma.
A Pittsburgh chemical firm now is
announcing a solution to the problem: A
pinch of a war-born chemical, added to
the salt, will stop this rust attack.

research completed this autumn that ad-
dition of the chemical "Banox" in small
amounts—one part Banox to 100 parts
salt—will create a protective film on
metal surfaces against which the street
brine is splashed.
A city official of Akron, Ohio, is
credited with having initiated the search
for a rust-inhibiting chemical to add to
salt. M. L. Davis, Service Director of
Akron, became concerned with the prob-
lem about 18 months ago. He estimated
that corrosion was costing motorists of
his city approximately $250,000 annually,
and asked Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Com-
pany chemists for help in investigating
the problem.
As a result of this first study, Akron
used a chemical with its salt last win-
ter, and Goodyear chemists reported fol-
lowing a check-up of 115 Akron automo-
biles during the past summer that it had
proved "partially effective."
Research in the problem then was taken
up by Calgon, Inc., in Pittsburgh, with
IN THE NEWS
(Continued jrom page 38)
the discovery of the effectiveness of
Banox as a result.
The Pittsburgh firm—which is widely
known to municipal authorities and other
public officials as a supplier of water-
conditioning materials for boilers, and
for its "threshold treatment" for muni-
cipal water systems—developed Banox
during the war for the treatment of mili-
tary equipment to be painted. Since the
war's end the chemical has been adopted
by a number of manufacturers of house-
hold appliances and other metal prod-
ucts and parts requiring rust prevention
and good paint adherence. Several auto-
mobile companies are testing it for new
cars.
Another fact brought out by the Pitts-
burgh chemists' study is that untreated
salt, lodged in fender and body joints—
or the joints or crevices of bridges and
steel roadside structures—will continue
to corrode the metal throughout the year,
each time the salt gets wet.
But the Calgon research men learned
that when Banox is present, mixed with
the salt, and the slush thus "treated" is
splashed onto metal surfaces, a microscop-
ically thin but protective film is formed
over both rusted and clean metal. This
film is tough and flexible and continuous,
they report, although invisible to the
naked eye, and it forms in the joints and
everywhere the salt reaches and continues
to give the protection. Furthermore it
has "carry-over." Once formed on the
underside of your car it will be there
protecting the metal when a warm rainy
spell comes along.
The chemical is non-toxic, odorless,
harmless to the skin, eyes, and clothing,
as well as to plants and trees, and will
not harm or discolor the auto paint
finish. In addition, the chemists report,
it is easy to use. The street or highway
maintenance crew simply mixes in a
pound of Banox—it comes in dry powder
form—with each hundred pounds of salt.
Some girls are like roads, lots of
curves, soft shoulders, and you can't tell
where they lead you.

Continuous Seamless Tube Mill
—National Tube Company
develops revolutionary new mill design

2,000 feet of seamless pipe a minute! That's
what the world's first continuous seamless pipe
mill will turn out upon completion.
Developed by National Tube Company —
U.S. Steel Subsidiary — at its Lorain, Ohio
Works, the mill has already been referred to as
"one of the greatest advances in the steel in-
dustry during the past SO years."
The new continuous process it features will
eliminate several steps in the conventional
method of making seamless pipe and will be
comparable to that of continuous strip and sheet
mills. Designed to produce sizes ranging from
2 inches to 4Yi inches OD, the mill not only will
provide quality products at lower cost, but
greater service to the consumer.
This revolutionary seamless mill design is an-
other demonstration of National Tube Com-
pany's position of leadership in providing indus-
try with both quality and quantity products.
Construction view showing 9-stand Rolling Mill and Inlet and Outlet Conveyors.

The spirit behind this latest National Tube Company development typifies
the spirit behind projects being conducted in all United States Steel Corpora-
tion Subsidiaries. It is a pioneering spirit—one that requires qualified men in
all branches of engineering. See your Placement Officer for a copy of "Paths

Recently the movie people filmed an oil
gusher scene, using Methocel (Dow Methyl-
cellulose). This unusual material thickens
water, giving a solution which, with the right
color added, resembles oil. Why go to such
lengths? Because, Methocel solutions are non-
inflammahlc, harmless to actors and are
readily washed off with water.
This, of course, is not a vital use of Methocel.
But it does indicate MethoceFs great variety
of applications. Countless industries, including
paper, paint, leather, textiles, drug and cos-
metics, utilize its widely applicable properties
as a dispersing, thickening, stabilizing, emulsi-
fying, binding and coating agent.

Today chimneys are elements of in-
creasing interest from both social and
economic considerations. Those living or
working in the vicinity of a chimney are
interested in the amount and nature of
its discharge. Engineers and owners are
keenly aware of the mounting cost and
operating expense of chimneys and of
the appurtances that will satisfy the re-
quirements of local smoke ordinances as
well as a plant's neighbors.
The prime purpose of a chimney is to
discharge the products of combustion, or
other gases, into the atmosphere at an
elevation sufficient to avoid causing a
nuisance. At the same time the chimney
develops some or all of the draft needed
for combustion. The amount of this draft
depends on the gas temperature in the
chimney (text books supplying formulas
for the computation of theoretical and
available draft from various types). Mod-
em boilers with economizers or air heat-
ers, or both, reduce flue gas temperatures
to a degree that the resultant draft is not
sufficient to overcome pressue losses be-
tween combustion chamber and chimney.
Consequently mechanical draft must sup-
plement chimney draft, and this ac-
counts for the increasing use of induced
draft fans.
Evidence is accumulating that some
communities are likely to place stress on
chimney designs that will satisfactorily
meet the social requirements regarding
nuisance discharges. In that connection
the ideal chimney has been defined as one
that will discharge to the atmosphere only
harmless gases, as free from dust and
obnoxious fumes as the air entering the
furnace. This would necessitate two
steps: (a) the removal of all solid mat-
ter, such as cinders, ash, metal oxides, and
similar substances; and (b) the absorp-
tion from the gases, before they leave the
chimney, of harmful compounds—name-
ly, the oxides and acids of sulfur, fluorine,
and chlorine.
Solids
Solids can be removed by dust traps,
cyclones, electrostatic precipitators, and
washers. All of these are in use and many
of them operate at high efficiency. Satis-
factory dust removal can be secured by
means of these devices or combinations of
them, provided owners are willing to pay
the cost of effective equipment. However,
this expense is becoming more apparent
as the price that society will require in-
dustry to pay for the privilege of using
Removal of obnoxious gases, fumes, or
odors is a more complex problem than
dust removal. Some of these products are
readily absorbed by water, but even then
gas washing does not end the problem.
The wash water may become acid, may
lose its oxygen content, or may contain

The title, "Professional Engineer," is
one that an engineering student becomes
aware of as he proceeds through the se-
mesters toward his chosen profession.
Despite the fact that an awareness of pro-
fessional engineering exists, many stu-
dents desire further information concern-
ing professional engineering. This
opinion is based on the number of in-
quiries received at the TECHNIC office
after the printing of several Part I Pro-
fessional Engineering Examinations (Oc-
tober, November, and December, 1948
issues).
Need for Registration
Few, if any, question the need for a
doctor to be licensed by the state before
he is permitted to practice. The concept
of human life and welfare being at stake
is so obvious as to be unquestioned. The
tremendous technological strides taken by
science and industry in this century have
altered the scale of values of most pro-
fessions; engineering is but one notable
example.
The complexities and inter-relation-
ships of practically all forms of industrial
endeavor eventually reached such a mag-
nitude that all of society became as inti-
mately connected with the engineer as is
the patient with a doctor. Life, health,
and property became dependent upon the
engineer to such an extent as to warrant
that the competency of an engineer be
fully as requisite as that of the doctor.
Accordingly, each state enacted legislation
in an attempt to secure and guarantee this
competency. At present, every state has
laws which require that those engineers
who practice for the public must be li-
censed by the state wherein they practice.
State Reciprocity
At first thought, it would appear that
the practice of a professional engineer is
restricted solely to the state wherein he
resides. Were this to be true, the result-
ing complications would become cumber-
somely manifold. There exists, therefore,
an agreement of reciprocity among the
states, said agreement being merely a
recognition (and acceptance) on the part
of the individual state of the standard of
This article was conceived, curiously,
at a Technic staff banquet. Professor
C. T. Olmsted's speech on professional
engineering brought the realization that
here was a subject of rich content for
our readers.
David refers to his studying at Michi-
gan as his "second time around"; he is
9 '41 graduate of Brooklyn College, where
he majored in mathematics and educa-
tion. He hopes to utilize his "Mechani-
:al" degree, some day, in his own business
of household gadgets and educational
toys.
the license granted to an engineer in an-
other state. It is generally conceded that
the license granted by New York State
is the criterion upon which all compari-
sons are made. In other words, the license
granted by New York State is acceptable
to every other state, and would allow
the possessor of that license to practice
in any state; but there are some states
whose standards for licensing engineers
are not acceptable to New York State.
Consequently, an engineer licensed in one
of these latter states may not practice for
the public in New York State. That is
not to say that he could not be employed
in an engineering capacity there.
In general, most states accept the regis-
tration licenses of the other «tates, and
the practice of reciprocity is the rule, not
the exception.

For the reader who desires more de-
tailed information about the registration
laws of a particular state, the following
sources are suggested:
T. Keith Legaree
Sec. of the National Council of State
Boards of Engineering Examiners
Columbia, S.C.
and, of course, the State Board of Regis-
tration of the particular state.
Qualifications for License
The qualifications required by law are
contained in the (Michigan) Registration
Act for Architects, Professional Engi-
neers, and Land Surveyors; Act 240, P. A.
1937 (as amended). However, those
qualifications based on the examinations
have acquired further interpretation. The
following information was acquired from
a personal interview with Mr. Watts A.
Shelley, former Executive Secretary of the
Michigan State Board of Registration; any
discrepancy is to be credited solely to the
author.
The examinations are divided into three
parts: Part I, to test the applicant's
knowledge of the basic engineering sub-
jects; Part II, dealing with contracts and
specifications, professional conduct and
ethics; Part III, which requires the appli-
cant to describe fully some portion of his
experience as an engineer. This descrip-
tion may be in the form of a report, in-
cluding sketches or drawings, and calcu-
lations of some particular engineering
problem encountered by the applicant in
his experience.
The Examinations
The Part I examinations apply to archi-
tects, engineers of all categories, and land
surveyors. That is, the one examination is
designed for all the groups. To be elig-
ible to take this examination, one must
be a graduate, or a graduating senior, of
a school recognized by the Engineering
Council of Professional Development
(ECPD). It is possible for an individual
with no college training to take the Part
I examination by presenting proof of
eight years of acceptable experience to the
Board.
Those who fail the examination may

month intervals. Further failure would
require proof of more study before the
examination could be taken again.
Each candidate who passes the Part I
examination receives a Certificate of En-
gineering Training. This certificate is re-
tained by the individual as proof that he
has successfully completed the Part I ex-
amination. With respect to these certifi-
cates, the agreements of reciprocity also
apply; a person possessing a Certificate of
Engineering Training from one state may
complete his examinations and be regis-
tered and licensed in another state.
In the event of failure of either the
Part II or Part III examinations, the can-
didate must produce proof of more ex-
perience before he may take the examina-
tion again.
The following is a reprint of the de-
scription of the various examinations
furnished each examinee by the Board:
Part I—Text books, tables, etc., permit-
ted. This examination shall consist of
questions in those fundamental basic sub-
jects which are common to all curricula in
a regular four-year course in an engi-
neering college. These are the subjects
generally given in the first two years, and
occasionally, in the third year. They are
as follows: Mathematics, Physics, Chem-
istry, Engineering Drawing, Mechanics,
Strength of Materials, Fluid Mechanics,
Direct and Alternating Current Electric
Apparatus and Circuits, Heating En-
gines, Machine Design, Thermodynamics,
Theory of Structures, Surveying and Map-
ping.
Part II—No books permitted. This
part of the examination shall consist of
questions of a professional engineering
nature which shall be common to all
branches of professional engineering, and
shall include questions on ethics; pro-
fessional practice; relations between engi-
neer and client, engineer and contractor,
and engineer and public; engineering law
and specification writing; report writing.
There may be included some questions re-
quiring a mathematical solution in which
the original data is in a subject unfamiliar
to the candidate but is of such a nature
that requires only the engineering ap-
proach and ability to analyze, which
should be common property to all pro-
fessional engineers. All candidates will
take the same examination and no one
will be excused from this part.
Part III Previous to taking any of
the examination, the candidate shall indi-
cate the branch or branches of profes-
sional engineering in which he has been
primarily engaged, and this part of the
examination shall consist of questions of
a purely professional nature in the
branches indicated. No candidate will be
excused from this part of the examination.
In order to convey, more emphatically,
the true spirit with which the Part I exam-
ination is offered, a paragraph taken from
a recent paper follows:
"The main purpose of this examination
is to determine if the candidate has suffi-
cient knowledge of the basic engineering
subjects to enable him to analyze a prob-
lem and to set up the required equations.
The solution of the equations is of sec-
ondary importance, and any method of
solution which will give an answer with
reasonable accuracy is acceptable. A mere
description of how to work the problem
without actually forming the necessary
equations will NOT be acceptable. It is
suggested that the solution of the equa-
tions be left until all of the required
problems have been analyzed."
It was found that no statistics relative
to the subject of registration were avail-
able, chiefly because of their non-exist-
ence. It was felt that a more comprehen-
sive view of the professional field could
be obtained with the aid of some com-
parative figures. Consequently, the writer
has compiled the following tables from
the "Roster of Architects, Professional
Engineers, Land Surveyors" dated Jan-
uary, 1947.

The reader may observe some apparent
duplications, as, for example, Civil-Mech.
and Mech.-Civil. The listings were cate-
gorized as they appeared in the Roster;
however, for purposes of consolidating
the list, the examples just cited could have
been combined and listed, properly, as
either one multiple category or the other.
In general, the order of listing for a par-
ticular categary may be conceded to deter-
mine the order of competency. (The
consideration of the time element—when
the license was granted—also may have
influenced the ordering of the various
titles for some individuals). In any case,
so long as a license has been granted,
competency in the subject has been recog-
nized and approved, regardless of any
other registrations a person may have.
It must be stressed that the granting of a
license by the state is a recognition of a
minimum standard of competency; it does
not imply that the possessors of a license
in a common field are of equal compe-
tency.
It may be of further interest to note the
number of licenses granted for the 14 dif-
ferent categories which comprise the field
of Professional Engineering. (This does
not imply that there are 14 categories
now, and that there will be no new cate-

—Aerodynamics—
by
DAVID STEIN, '49E
The original idea of this series, "Re-
search at the University of Michigan,"
was to describe a particular research
project in each issue. This month we veer
slightly from this intention; it was felt
that, instead of describing a particular
research project utilizing the University's
supersonic wind tunnel, the runnel itself
would provide a fascinating history of re-
search.
In June 1946, the Army Air Forces ap-
proved a proposal that the University of
Michigan, under the sponsorship of the
Air Forces, construct and operate an in-
termittent supersonic wind tunnel. The
tunnel was to operate at Mach Numbers
from 1.5 to approximately 5, with run
durations of about 20 seconds throughout
this range.
In that same month the design was be-
gun and the subsequent construction,
operation, and modification of the run-
nel during the past two years has revealed
many of the problems and possibilities of
this type of design. No other wind tun-
nel in this country used so brief a run
duration; the problem of a closed return
circuit was unique, and for many of the
problems there was little or no back-
ment of this program is still under way,
and the results of some of the modifica-
tions still remain to be determined.
However, much of what has been learned
thus far is of general interest in the field
of supersonic testing.
Description
Generally speaking, a workable wind
tunnel may be considered to comprise of
a circuit, a force-measuring apparatus,
and a flow-visualization apparatus. The
circuit (of the air) consists of a prime-
mover to move an air mass, a nozzle to
accelerate the air and establish the test
conditions, a test section to house the
model being tested, and, in this case, a
return passage to maintain a closed air
circuit. Each of the three categories
mentioned presented a host of problems,
not all of which have been solved satis-
factorily.
The University of Michigan supersonic
wind tunnel is a closed-return, intermit-
tent-operation tunnel utilizing the pres-
sure difference between atmospheric pres-
sure and the low pressure of an evacuated
system as the basic motivating force.
Nine railroad-car tanks (obtained from

rr mirs - rente niumr

ground. The first supersonic flow, at a
Mach Number of about 1.9 was obtained
in April 1947, but a survey of the first
tunnel results indicated that a rather ex-
tensive modification and development
program was necessary. The accomplish-
Russian lend-lease, and still bearing the
original Russian markings), which are
manifolded together to give 13,000 cubic
feet capacity, are evacuated by a pump,
the air removed being stored in a 24,000
cubic feet capacity balloon, or bag. When
the tanks are at a pressure sufficiently low
for operation, a valve is quickly opened.
The air from the bag flows through the
test channel into the tanks. As the run
progresses, the bag partially collapses, the
outside air maintaining a steady upstream
pressure equal to the barometric pressure.
At the end of the run, the valve is closed
and the recharging cycle begun.
In order to avoid condensation in the
test section, the air must be dried prior
to the first operation, and maintained at
extremely low humidity throughout the
successive runs. A drier was included in
the system for this purpose. Then, to
minimize pitting of the model by dust
particles in the airstream, a filter was
placed in the return circuit so that the
air could be cleaned during the charging
cycle.
The test channel is made up of four
main parts: (1) the subsonic converging
channel, which is the entrance duct sys-
tem; (2) the nozzle section, in which
supersonic flow is produced; (3) the test
section, in which the model is mounted
and the resulting phenomena observed;
and (4) the diffuser system, in which
pressure recovery occurs.
The testing chamber is 8 inches wide by
13 inches deep, capable of handling
models up to 13 inches in length and 4
inches wing span at angles of attack up to
13 degrees. The estimated Mach Number
range is 1.4 to 5.0, but the upper.range
has not, as yet, been achieved. The Rey-
nolds Number for a 12-inch long model
varies from about 4y2 million at M=
1.4 to about 3/4 million at M=5.0, the
decrease being caused by the decreasing
density in the test section with increas-
ing M.
Test runs up to 18 seconds can be
made, but it has been found that a short
run of 4 seconds, followed by a run of 8
seconds gives the best results in measur-
ing pressures. It requires a period of
about 15 minutes to re-evacuate the tanks
for an 18 second run, so that at least 4
runs an hour can be made.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


by
WILL R. MEESE
Since the beginning of World War II
the Federal Government has offered many
employment opportunities to graduat-
ing engineers. In an effort to acquaint
the students with the various possibilities
Mr. Meese reviews the many opportuni-
ties which are gained from this type of
work. Types of work available, locations,
methods employed by the Government
in carryng out development and research
projects, cooperative programs between
Industry and the Government, and the
salary and pension program are here
presented for your consideration and
evaluation.
At the present time Mr. Meese is asso-
ciated with the research and development
section of the Detroit Tank Arsenal.
The U. S. armed services have a defi-
nite need for engineers who are interested
in research work. From the personal
point of view, a position with the Army
is very interesting and instructive and the
salary is in line with industry. The gen-
eral public has been led to believe that
the armed services are interested mostly
in the development of atom bombs and
guided missiles. This is not true, since
new equipment is needed in all phases of

Will R. Meese
the defense program.
Research in the Army is conducted in
several ways, either by calling in an ap-
propriate committee from industry and
turning the problem over to them for so-
lution, or having this committee act as a
consulting agent with a particular Army

1,000,000-Volt Radiographic Machine Detects Flaws in Turret Casting
laboratory doing the actual work, or turn-
ing the whole problem over to a private
research agency, such as the University of
Michigan, with both the committee and
the Army acting as consultants and direct-
ing the projects. In this manner the
Army receives the best possible advice and
experience, since these committees are
made up of top industrial experts.
As an example of the various types of
research work, let us review a few ex-
amples of my own experience. In the
particular field of Fuels and Lubricants
there are unlimited possibilities for re-
search. The armed services have asked
that fuels, lubricants, greases, and allied
products be made so that one of each type
will be usable through a range of tem-
peratures from 135°F to —70°F. This
indeed is a large requirement and whether
it will be entirely fulfilled remains to be
seen. So far, some of these products have
been developed, others are now undergo-
ing tests and still others are in the design
or formula stage. It is anticipated that
products will be found to fulfill these re-
quirements. At the present time emphasis
is being placed on the cold weather per-
formance of these materials. The Army
is the leader in this phase of the work,
since it found it needed fuels and lubri-
cants that would operate in the extreme
temperatures of —70°F and — 80°F. Up
to now addition of a diluent to the engine
oil was thought to be sufficient. So the
Army started a program of research in
mineral and synthetic oils in an attempt
to find an oil that would be fluid at these
extremely low temperatures. Appropriate
industrial committees of the Society of
Automotive Engineers and the American
Petroleum Institute were called upon to
assist in this program. After two years
of intensified laboratory and field work
an oil has been found that is satisfactory.
Cooperation between industry and the
army has resulted in obtaining satisfac-
tory material very quickly. The emphasis
is now on producing a universal grease
which can be used in extreme high and
low temperatures. A few years ago this
was considered impossible, but now an
army test convoy has spent three months
in the desert testing several greases in the

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


V. DetSena
B. Humes
Question:
How do you feel about extending the
engineering curriculum from four to five
years for the B.S. degree?
Professor D. L. Katz
There are two procedures by which we
may meet the problem of ever-increasing
technical knowledge. One way is to en-
large the engineering curriculum with
time, expecting to teach the student more
facts as they become available. The sec-
ond procedure is to admit that college
training cannot present all the informa-
tion that becomes available but should
teach the student how to think, using lan-
guage and principles suitable for the
times. I prefer the latter method for the
following reasons:
1) Enlarging the curriculum because
there is more to teach does not en-
courage continual modernization of
the curriculum by substituting the
new for the old.
2) A large number of B.S. men do
not intend to lead strictly technical
careers but hope to enter the busi-
ness phase of industry. Four years
is the logical stopping point for
such men.
3) A larger number of men can af-
ford to go to college for four years
than for five years.
4) A graduate program after the B.S.
degree gives ample opportunity for
those interested and qualified to
pursue technical studies of a more
advanced stage.
Professor A. H. Lovell
I do not believe there is a necessity for
such an extension in our curriculum.
First of all, the increased time and finan-
cial outlay on the part of the student
would present an economical barrier to
some students. Where it might be said
there is more and more technical material
to learn, I would say that most industrial
concerns employing engineers prefer to
instruct the graduate engineer further
themselves. This specialized material can-
not be given in college. If the curriculum
were enlarged, the greater part of the
time would be consumed by the humani-
ties. Expanding would also present a
problem to the administration. Condi-
tions are abnormal now and there would
be many difficulties to overcome.
If the graduate engineer desires to
further his knowledge, he may always re-
turn to do graduate work. The most ef-
fective work done by candidates for a
master's degree is done by those students
who have experienced themselves in the
industrial world.
Edward Chempiel, '50E
If the curriculum were extended, I
think more social subjects should be
given. I believe there is a need for such
courses. The graduate engineers entering
the industrial field are at a handicap, so-
cially that is, and a more liberal curricu-
lum would relieve this.
Albert M. Shenlcman, '50E
I definitely feel that the curriculum
should be extended to five years. This
would, I believe, give future engineers a
chance for a much broader education so
that they would be equipped for the
social as well as the industrial positions
offered them. More humanities could be
offered and it wouldn't hurt to have a
"soft touch" once in a while. I believe
they call them "snap courses." This
would lift the drudgery engineering stu-
dents experience in their four years of
college.
G. Kenneth Turner, '5IE
I feel that the curriculum as it stands
is sufficient. The student receives the fun-
damental theory while in college and
learns the applications in the field. I be-
lieve a large part of your education in
engineering comes after graduation when
the academic theories are put to work.
But what's the difference? It's taking me
five years anyway. It's pretty hard to do
it all in four.
Edward Coleman, '5IE
I favor a five year course if, and only
if, there are no more technical courses
added to the curriculum. The course as it
is fills the engineer's mind with too much
technical matter and not enough cultural.
A college education, it must be remem-
bered, does not just consist of studying,
but it must consist of the finer points of
learning such as art, literature, and the
like. If a five year curriculum could en-
able the future engineer to obtain a more
liberal education, then I say by all means
install it.
Dick D. DeLine, '50E
Yes, I am very much in favor of the
proposed five year program for prospec-
tive engineers. It seems that the curricu-
lum set up for engineers under the pres-
ent system limits the electives to one or
two courses, where under a five year pro-
gram one would be able to include at least
an extra fifteen semester hours. Another
important factor is that most prospective
engineers can hardly find time for extra
curricular activities under the present sys-
tem. To me, extra curricular activities are
one of the highlights of my college career.
Harold Gibbons, '50E
The engineer is supposed to be a mem-
ber of one of the three traditional
"great" professions, namely, Law, Medi-
cine, and Engineering. A doctor goes to
school for 8 years to receive his M.D.,
and even then must enter an internship
where his practice is closely supervised.
A lawyer must go to school for 7 years
for his L.L.D. In opposition to this, the
engineer is only required to take a four
year education, and then immediately as-
sume a position in the community com-
parable to a doctor or lawyer. When he
is unable to do this, the entire profession
suffers by example. Thus I think that
at least a 5 year program should be in-
stituted, and the sooner, the better.
S. J. (Pat) Cina, '5IE
I believe that the question of increasing
the length of the engineering program can
be resolved into three factors.
1. For a great many, the extra year
would prove a great financial burden,
even too much in some cases.
2. The volume of technical learning
could be increased.
3. The volume of learning on the side
of a liberal education could also be in-
creased.
Therefore, I feel that the facts speak
for themselves, and they say: "Two to
one for a longer education."
David Cunnings, '50E
I am in favor of increasing the engi-
neering program to at least 5 years. If
one desires to be merely a technician of
some sort, there are many schools in
which he may gratify this desire in four
years or less, such as Case, R. P. I., Gen-
eral Motors Tech, or DeForest.

We are grateful to the Triangle So-
ciety for having done such a fine job of
washing the walk under the engine arch.
And when is the best time of day for
washing the walk? At high noon, of
course. That.is when the walk is getting
the dirtiest. We don't know what
prompted the Tri's to take upon them-
selves this responsibility, but we are
grateful. Also, we wonder why they took
a number of their members ten miles out
of town to give them the healthy exercise
of walking back. Would the fact that the
members who washed the walk and the
members who enjoyed all that exercise
have only recently joined the society have
anything to do with it?
New initiates include Prof. H. W.
Smith, Prof Nielsen, Stanford Wiggen,
Charles Rauner, Robert Paul, John Kist-
ler, and James Atchinson.
On a somewhat more prosaic level,
the Triangles are now considering the
possibility of introducing systems of
faculty evaluation in the engine schools
which have not yet instituted this system.
They are now studying the operation of
the system in other schools, and other
phases of this weighty question. It-might
be a good idea.
We may also thank the Triangle So-
ciety and the Engineering Council for
having produced the engine school hand-
book entitled, "What Every Young Engi-
neer Should Know."
ASME
Vincent P. Burns announces that the
American Society of Mechanical Engi-
neers has been moving along under full
sail.
November 3, the ME's were privi-
leged to hear an address by Dr. R. O.
Fehr, of General Electric. Dr. Fehr
spoke on The Fight Against Vibration
and Noise.
They've also been going out and see-
ing things. During November 16-19
members went to Detroit to the Gen-
eral Motors diesel plant. They visited the
school for diesel mechanics, and were
shown the diesel production and assembly
line.
November 17, a number of the offi-
cers and members attended a joint meet-
ing of the Engineering Society of Detroit
and the Detroit chapter of ASME.
Highlight of the meeting was the ban-
quet which included on its program a
speech by a noted research scientist from
the Batelle Memorial Institute.
Plans of the club for December in-
cluded a field trip to the Kaiser-Frazer
plant in Willow Run.
ASH &amp; VE
The Heat and Vent men enjoyed an
address by a renowned authority in
the field. Mr. Sterling Sanford, of De-
troit Edison spoke on the heat pump. He
discussed cost comparisons between the
heat pump and conventional heating sys-
tems, details of the heat pump, and the
future of the heat pump.
In the meeting on Wednesday, Decem-
ber 8, plans were discussed for a bigger
and better club for next term. They've
got some big plans.
ROTC—ORDNANCE
Future army-industry leaders in the
local Ordnance ROTC unit are taking full
advantage of campus opportunities to
develop into competent technical leaders.
Membership in the appropriate student
technical society (ASME, AIChE, SAE,
etc.) provides a "vertical" contact with
the technical field of their specific inter-
est while membership in the AOA pro-
vides a broad "horizontal" contact with
the scientific and industrial implications
of providing adequate Ordnance materiel
for the Armed Forces. In addition to
participation in such organizations (which
are primarily civilian in nature) the Ord-
nance ROTC student is eligible for the
following groups:
The Ordnance Film Hour: This is a
monthly showing of films of interest to
Ordnance ROTC students. As a matter
of policy the program consists of a film
or films of general manufacturing or tech-
nical interest, additional films showing
the construction or operation of an item
of Ordnance equipment not covered in
the student's ROTC course, and a film
which depicts the combat usage of Ord-
nance materiel. Of the films shown this
semester, "The Manufacture of Smoke-
less Powder" and "The Cathode Ray
Oscillograph" were outstanding in the
general interest field; "The Concrete-
Piercing Nose Fuse" and "Concentric Re-
coil Mechanisms" revealed the applica-
tion of new designs to old items which
resulted in more effective materiels;
"Task Force Frigid" and "Task Force
Frost" forcefully brought home the prob-
lems of the Automotive Engineer who
must create effective materiel for Arctic
operations.
Gaging Group: The gaging group is
representative of a new type of activity
available to a limited number of Ord-
nance ROTC students on a first-come,
first-served basis. This group meets for
about two hours once a month in the
University-Detroit Ordnance District gage
laboratories on the campus. Familiarity
with practical gage work is emphasized.
The first meeting (devoted to gage block
and comparator work as well as an intro-
duction to quality control) was thor-
oughly enjoyed by all participants—
Professors Colwell and Boston are mak-
ing large contributions to the success of
this activity.
Pending Groups: The additional
groups similar in purpose to the gage
group are under organization—the Auto-
motive Trouble-Shooting group and the
Armor Welding group. It is hoped that
both of these will be functioning the
early part of next semester.
Triangle
Although Triangle, Michigan's only
engineering social fraternity, returned to
campus in 1947, the year 1948 has proven
to all that the group is progressing into
one of the foremost engineering organi-
zations in the school.
The election of last April elevated Ken
Haynes, EE, and Edward Rich, ChE, to
the positions of President and Vice-Presi-
dent, under whose leadership Triangle ac-
quired a new house on East University.
A successful social program and lecture
series were also inaugurated with regularly
scheduled Monday night talks by promi-
nent engineers and members of the fac-
ulty of the Engineering College.
Professor Olmsted of the Engineering
Mechanics department opened the series

professional engineering licenses. He
further explained the procedure in the
taking of these exams and compared
the practices of the various state boards.
Recently Professor Legatski of the
Gvil Engineering department explain-
ed to the engineers of Triangle the
difference between the methods of teach-
ing used in theory and design courses.
This semester fifteen men were pledged
and five were initiated as actives. Those
initiated included Robert Hlavin, ChE,
Max Clyde, CE, George Luckett, IMe,
Lloyd Jorrisch, AE, and Les Canaan,
CE. With this enlarged membership,
Triangle finds itself represented in most
of the Engineering school's organizations
including the Engineering Council, Sigma
Rho Tau, and the Technic as well as the
various student professional societies.
Triangle expects further to increase its
activities in the Engineering College, not
only by social activities and engineering
lectures, but also by big participation in
such school activities as the Slide Rule
Ball and the Engineering School Open
House.
Distaff Engineers
Mrs. Dyer of the Chem and Met of-
fice announces that the Society of Women
Engineers will resume activities in the
spring semester, 1949. This should come
as welcome news to all you girls in the
engine school. The time, place, and date
of the first meeting will be announced
shortly, so watch this column, darlings.
Watch this column anyway,
SAE
December 9, the Society of Auto-
motive Engineers had an open meeting
which was really worth attending. Non-
members were invited to see for them-
selves the advantages of belonging to an
engineering organization. They also
heard Professor N. Clayton Hill of the
Business Ad school—former vice presi-
dent of the Murray Corporation and
president of the Dieterich Corporation.
Prof. Hill spoke on Utilization of Man-
power. Refreshments were served.
On Friday, December 17, members en-
gaged in a sortie to the Willow Run air-
port. The field trip was in conjunction
with students of the Lawrence Institute
of Technology. They were shown the
supersonic wind tunnel, as well as the
research activities in ramjet combustion.
For the future, SAE plans round table
discussion on gas turbines and on chas-
sis design.
AOA
A special meeting of the U. of M. Post
was held recently -for the sole purp"ose
of taking a second look at the policies of
this Post concerning its program. An
extensive discussion was carried out and
plans were formulated.
Due to the wide field of engineering in
Ordnance problems and because the mem-
bers of the Post represent most Depart-
ments of the Engineering College—in-
cluding men who are and who are not
in the ROTC—it was concluded that a
lateral program covering all phases of
engineering should be followed. As a
result of this, speakers have been invited
who will represent a cross section of in-
dustry and research in all branches of
engineering. In addition, a diversified se-
lection of topics has been made covering
subjects of technical information, specific
vocational advice, or general information
concerning problems engineers might en-
counter in ordnance and civilian indus-
try and research.
Plant trips also have been planned so
that chemical engineers can acquire a
greater knowledge of automotive engi-
neering, mechanical engineers can see a
plant producing optical instruments, and
aeronautical engineers can see the prob-
lems involved in maintenance of rough-
ridden tank parts at an arsenal.
As an example of the variety in the
A.O.A. program offered this Fall: Mr.
Robert L. Biggers, President of Chrysler's
Fargo Truck Division, told of his experi-
ences with a Navy task force; two trips
were made to the Detroit Tank Arsenal—
one at the invitation of the State of
Michigan Post, which included a special
dinner program and Col. William Call,
an Army Officer pursuing his Ph.D. at
the University, presented a practical dis-
cussion of how the engineer can help the
mechanic in "Ease of Maintenance of
Vehicles." Shortly after the Christmas
holidays, three men from the Detroit
Tank Arsenal—Mr. Reinke, chief of the
design branch, Major Thomas, chief of
the Components Laboratory, and Mr.
Jaegar, of the personnel division—will
present a discussion of engineering design
and research in the armed services. To
this closing meeting of the term, we wish
especially to extend an invitation to mem-
bers of ASME, AIChE, SAE, IAS, and
other organizations whose members might
be interested in learning of the oppor-
tunities for the civilian engineer in gov-
ernment service.
The spring program is now almost
complete and will be published and made
available to all engineering students.
AIA
The AIA is preparing to exchange,
with other institutions, exhibits made by
students in architectural design and
in allied subjects. Seven schools other
than Michigan will participate, including
Illinois Institute of Technology, Western
Reserve, Ohio State, U. of Illinois, and
U. of Minnesota.
Several field trips are being planned
for the near future. Of interest should be
one through a house designed by Frank
Lloyd Wright. Mr. Wright enjoys the
reputation of being the greatest designer
of homes in the country, and to go
through one of his brain-children would
be really worth while.
On Saturday, December 4 the AIA co-
operated with several arch classes in stag-
ing a field trip to Detroit. Among the
firms visited was Smith-Henchman-Gryllf.
AIChE
Paul Reger reports that the American
Institute of Chemical engineers has par-
ticipated in field trips to a number of
chemical firms. They visited the Goebel
Brewery (one of our leading chemical
firms) and enjoyed their hospitality.
(Hot dog). They have also been the
dinner-guests of the company of Parke,
Davis. This followed a trip through the
Parke, Davis plant. That's the way to
take field trips!
The Chems have also visited the plant
of the Penn Salt Company, in Wyandotte,
Michigan. They went through the auto-
matic synthetic ammonia plant, and wit-
nessed the production of electrolytic
caustic.
Sigma Rho Tau
enters national debates
The present resolution being debated
by SRT is: Resolved, The Taft-Hartley
Law should be repealed. They are engag-
ing in debates with chapters from other
schools. The chapter of the Detroit In-
stitute of Technology defeated our chap-
ter after a very eloquent display of
rhetoric. However, the Sigs are deter-
mined to prove themselves against the
U. of Toledo chapter, whom they are soon
to meet in verbal combat.
Smaller debates are being presented on
the same resolution amongst the members
themselves. This is in tune with the pur-
pose of the organization, which is to
develop speaking skill in engineers.—B.F.

water by neutralization, aeration, or sedi-
mentation. Plant additions for this pur-
pose call for expenditures that may yield
little or no direct return, and the washing
plant itself is generally difficult to build
and maintain. Furthermore, washing in
winter lowers the flue gas temperature to
a point where the chimney exerts little or
no draft and the gases must be pushed
out of the chimney by the induced draft
fan. The flue gases are highly humidified
and after they are discharged into the cold
atmosphere, condensation with resultant
rain drops may become a real nuisance.
Extensive gas washing and cooling has
led to some peculiar experiences. In one
instance abroad, the gases from a large
central station were being washed with
river water at a temperature around the
freezing point. No wind was blowing at
the time, and a relatively warm cloud
bank was over the city. As a result of
these conditions gases from the station's
chimney mushroomed down over the
neighborhood and caused an oxygen de-
ficiency that distressed individuals. Also
the discharged gases, partially diluted,
were drawn into the forced draft fan in-
takes in such amounts as to affect com-
bustion. Fires under the boilers were
deadened with an attendant loss of steam
pressure. The situation was remedied by
stopping the washing operation; then the
hot chimney gases penetrated the cloud
bank and proceeded upwards in the nor-
mal way.
velocities
Another consideration of chimneys,
from a social standpoint, is the nature of
the gas discharge at the top. The gas
velocities in a natural draft chimney are
usually low, i.e., about 20 feet per second.
When the gases reach the chimney top,
they will rise a short distance further, de-
pending on wind velocity, and will then
drift to leeward in a form known as a
plume. The plume spreads at right angles
to its drift. This dispersion causes the
gases to mix with the atmosphere and, by
diffusion, reduces the relative content of
obnoxious fumes and dusts. The farther
the plume travels, the greater is the de-
gree of dispersion. Also the higher the
chimney, the greater the distance the
plume will travel before its border reaches
the earth. Hence legislation in some in-
stances has placed minimum limits on
chimney heights. Plume travel has been
given much thought abroad and in one
European city chimneys must be two and
a half times the height of an adjoining
building. In another locality over there,
a minimum height of 300 feet is required
for certain types of chimneys.
In this country chimney discharges and
resultant plumes have been studied by
wind tunnel models, and some improved
practices have been developed. Compara-
tively high velocities of 50 to 60 ft. per
second are provided in many new chim-
neys and at least 100 ft. per sec. in a few
recent installations. Such velocities have a
tendency to eject the plume to a consid-
erable height above the top of the chim-
ney, even with moderate wind velocities.
Observation with wind of about 10 miles
per hour indicated that the plume is pro-
jected an additional height in feet equal
to the discharge velocity at the chimney
top in ft. per sec. In substance this is
equivalent to adding that height to the
chimney. Naturally greater height results
in more diffusion, as well as dispersion,
and the plume reaches the earth at more
distant points.
material
A chimney presents a number of struc-
tural problems to the designing engineer.
Shall it be of brick, reinforced concrete,
or steel?
(continued on page 18)

Modern Installation Using High-Velocity Chimneys
Many of the older chimneys were of
brick, either ordinary or, better still, radial
brick. These require little maintenance
and will last for a long time. However,
wind and temperature stresses tend to
open minute cracks in the mortar joints.
Infiltration of air through the cracks re-
sults in cooling of the gases and a de-
crease in effective draft.
Concrete chimneys with proper rein-
forcing steel remain airtight for years and
may be less expensive than brick. In addi-
tion concrete chimneys require little
maintenance.
Steel stacks can often be built at low-
est cost, but they require frequent paint-
ing to prevent rusting. Also rust may
attack the inside of the stack, particularly
during periods of outage or on the wind-
ward sides when operating at low loads.
An earlier practice was to line steel chim-
neys with fire brick, but different coeffi-
cients of expansion made difficult the
maintenance of a tight bond between
brick and steel. Corrosive gases would
then infiltrate the brickwork, corrode the
steel, and replacements become necessary.
With the lower gas temperatures from
modern plants, no significant gain results
from lining a chimney with refractories.
Protection with several inches of gunite
over heavy chicken wire, fastened to the
inside of the stack, is becoming the prac-
tice today. This covering has about the
same thermal coefficient of expansion as
the steel itself and appears to develop
few cracks. Where it is employed, the in-
side is protected and at the same time the
(continued from page 17)
chimney becomes a stiffer
column to withstand wind
forces.
Another question upon
which engineers do not agree
is the need of a refractory lin-
ing in a chimney and the
necessary height of such a
lining when used. Natural
draft, brick or concrete chim-
neys, with their hot gases,
make an inner refractory lin-
ing desirable. The need of
this lining with a gunite-pro-
tected steel stack, and low gas
temperature, is open to ques-
tion. No established practice
nor any experimental data on
the necessary height of inner
brick linings seem to exist,
and they are found to range
from 20 feet above the gas entrance to
the full chimney height. The lining
height is a matter of opinion or past prac-
tice and does not appear to be based on
scientific data.
Opinions differ as to the nature of
inner brick linings. In some cases second-
grade fire brick is used. Temperatures in
chimneys seldom exceed 700°F and are
generally much lower. Common brick
can successfully withstand average flue
gas temperatures not exceeding this figure
and are less costly than fire brick.
Some new power plants will be built
in the neighborhood of airports. Airport
authorities insist upon the lowest possible
height for neighboring chimney, as these
present hazards when planes are landing
in fog or at night when visibility is poor.
Wind-tunnel tests have shown that the
Chimney must project a certain height
above the boiler house roof to prevent
down-wash. The aspirating effect of the
wind over the roof pulls air and gases to-
wards the lee side of the boiler house and
causes the so-called "down-wash" of the
flue gases. Should the forced draft in-
take be located on this side, a partial re-
circulation of flue gases into the furnace
would take place and this would be un-
economical. Furthermore, due to this
back-wash effect, the plume reaches the
ground at a point near the power plant.
Concentration of dusts will be greater
with this lesser dispersion and may cause
a nuisance. The height necessary to avoid
this difficulty differs with local conditions
such as land contour, neighboring struc-
tures, and the direction of prevailing
winds. Tests indicate that the chimney
must project a distance of 40 to 60 feet
above the roof to keep the plume out of
a down-wash current. The employment
of high discharge velocities at the top of
the stack, which project the plume to a
still higher elevation, is also desirable for
power plants near airports.

In order to present a comprehensive
picture of the administration of the pro-
fessional field, the Rules and Regulations
of the Michigan State Board of Registra-
tion for Architects, Professional Engi-
neers, and Land Surveyors, as contained
in the Roster of January, 1947, is here-
with reprinted.
RULES AND REGULATIONS
Rule I—Definitions
The term "architect" in the Act shall
include the words "architecture" and
"architectural", and no person (landscape
architect excepted) shall use any of these
designations unless he is registered as an
architect. The single word "designer"
does not come within the confines of the
Act.
"Prejudicial interest" in connection
with architectural practice means that an
architect shall not engage in the busi-
ness of construction during his practice
as an architect; nor shall he be engaged
or interested during this time in buying
or selling building materials.
(continued from page 9)
Rule 2—Applications for Registration
(a) Form: Applications shall always
be made on printed forms furnished by
the Board. No application made other-
wise than on such forms will be accepted
for filing by the Board. In case there is
not sufficient room on the form to pre-
sent all the evidence necessary, an appli-
cant may attach additional sheets of the
same size as the application blanks.
(b) Information on Application: Ap-
plicants shall be required to submit the
following information: Name in full,
usual written signature, place and date of
birth, citizenship, residence address, busi-
ness address, occupation, membership in
technical and professional societies, edu-
cation, and a record of entire professional
career. The latter shall be concise but
comprehensive and shall contain inclu-
sive dates with names and addresses of
the employers or clients wherever pos-
sible. The applicant shall furnish the
names and addresses of at least five
people, three of whom should be regis-
tered architects, professional engineers
or land surveyors who are familiar with
his experience. No member of the Board
shall be included in the references. In
addition to the information given in his
application, an applicant from another
state seeking registration by "reciprocity"
may be required to submit exhibits of
his work. These may be plans, specifica-
tions, papers, reports or anything of a
like nature such as would be helpful to
the Board in determining the applicant's
qualifications. An affidavit shall accom-
pany each application and no application
shall be accepted that has not been at-
tested on oath before a notary public or
other qualified official.
(c) Fees: An application shall be ac-
companied by the proper fees as provided
for in the Act. Any application not so
accompanied shall be held on file and the
applicant promptly notified to forward
his fee before his application can be con-
sidered by the Board.
(d) Rejected Applications: In case an
applicant is rejected, a notification of such
action shall be promptly sent to the ap-
plicant, stating the reasons for the rejec-
tion. The applicant may then be per-
mitted to submit additional evidence to
substantiate his claims for registration and
the Board shall consider this evidence at
a subsequent meeting.
(e) Where request for hearing is
made, applicant's status shall remain as
before notification of rejection.
(f) After final rejection, an applicant
is prohibited from assuming in any capac-
ity the professional status for which he
applied.
(g) Investigation of Application: All
applications from candidates whether by
examination or without examination shall
be thoroughly investigated. The Secretary
shall inquire from the references concern-
ing the accuracy of the information sub-
mitted or by such other means as the
Board may deem expedient. If replies
from the references cited are not re-
ceived within a reasonable time, the Sec-
retary shall notify the applicant to that
effect, requesting additional references.
All information so obtained shall then be
filed with the candidate's application as
a permanent record which shall remain
the property of the Board.
Rule 3—Titles
Applicants shall be registered under
one or more of the following titles: Arch-
itects, Professional Engineers, and Land
Surveyors. Professional Engineers shall
be classified under one or more of the
following sub-titles: Aeronautical, Civil,
Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, Mining
and Marine Engineers.
Rule 4—The Seal and Its Use
(a) Form: Where a registrant files
plans, specifications and reports with pub-
lic authorities, he shall use a seal of
standard design approved by the Board.
No other design may be used. An im-
print of the initial seal of each registrant
shall be filed with the Board and the im-
print shall again be made on the renewal
application to determine its legibility for
continued use.
(b) Use: The seal shall be used only
by the registrant whose name appears
thereon, and just so long as that registra-
tion remains in effect.
All work sealed shall be done under
the direct supervision of the practitioner.
Direct supervision shall mean constant
supervision of the preparation or direct-
ing the preparation of plans, specifications
and drawings.
Seals shall only be used on drawings, in
the line of work for which the registrant
is qualified under the Act.
Any violation of this rule will be the
basis for revocation of registration.

PROBLEM:
How to put a new type of
covering on telephone cable
Make a new type of cable sheath no one has
ever made before—make it to rigid specifica-
tions— make it fast! That was the challenge
put up to Western Electric's manufacturing
engineers.
The new type of cable sheath — developed
through cooperative research at Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories and Western Electric-
Company—is a valuable alternative to the tradi-
tional lead covering for telephone cable. It is
called Alpeth. "Al" stands for an inner shield
of aluminum; "peth" for the outer coating of
the plastic, polyethlene.
To produce this new cable sheath, Western
Electric engineers developed the Alpeth pro-
duction line—a combination of new machines
and new manufacturing techniques — which
turns out finished cable in a fast-moving,
straight-line operation.
From the desert-dry 125O F "hot room" where thoroughly dried coble
cores ore stored, the core moves into this machine. An aluminum strip
is fed from a supply reel underneath. After being corrugated to pro-
vide flexibility and strength, the aluminum strip is wrapped arouno
the core and flooded with a sticky protective compound.

The aluminum-clad cable then passes into this machine and comes
out seconds later with an extruded coating of flexible, impervious,
gleaming black polyethylene. Finally, after a 100-foot bath in a
cooling trough, the finished cable is wound on reels and readied for
shipment to Bell Telephone companies.
Engineering problems are many and varied at Western Electric, where manufacturing tele-
phone and radio apparatus for the Bell System is the primary job. Engineers of many kinds —

Rule 5—Examinations
(a) Examinations, either written or
oral, or both, shall be held at least once
a year at some convenient place or places,
public notice of such examinations being
given at least eight weeks in advance of
the date of the examination.
Applications for examination shall be
made on forms provided by the Board
and shall be filed with the Board at least
five weeks prior to the date of the ex-
amination. In case the applicant has at-
tended a college or university, a complete
transcript of his scholastic record must
accompany his application. This shall be
done whether or not he has graduated
and received a degree.
All applications shall be considered by
the Board at a regular meeting, and if
in the opinion of the Board, the appli-
cant is eligible to take the examination
for which he has applied, he shall be so
notified. If he is not eligible, he shall
be advised as to what additional experi-
ence he must acquire before he shall be
eligible.
(b) Examination in Architecture: Can-
didates for registration as architects shall
be examined in the following subjects:
Structural design; specification writing;
supervision, counseling, and administra-
tion; mechanical equipment; history of
architecture; and architectural design.
(c) Examination in Professional Engi-
neering: Candidates for registration as
professional engineeres shall be examined
in fundamental engineering subjects such
as given in the regular four year course
of accredited engineering schools. In ad-
dition to this, the candidates shall be
examined in the particular -branches of
engineering in which they have gained
their practical experience. Primary em-
phasis is to be placed on determining the
candidates' professional engineering abil-
ity.
(d) Examination in Land Surveying:
Candidates for registration as land sur-
veyors shall be examined in the use and
adjustments of surveying instruments,
field methods, the making and reading of
maps, office and field computations, and
the law of land surveying.
Rule 6—Registration
(a) Disposal of Application: After
all the available evidence concerning the
candidate, together with the results of his
examination, in case he has taken one, has
(continued from page 19)
been brought together, the application
will be formally brought before the
Board. The application will then be con-
sidered and if, after the examination of
the evidence submitted, the Board is sat-
isfied that the applicant is eligible for
registration under one or more of the
classifications mentioned in Rule 3, he
shall be registered.
(b) Notification of Registration: As
soon as a candidate's application has been
favorably passed by the Board, he shall
be notified immediately. As soon as he
has paid the required registration fee he
shall be considered to be a registered
architect, professional engineer or land
surveyor, provided that in case an appli-
cation is considered when one or more
members of the Board are absent, notifi-
cation shall not be given until such mem-
bers have had an opportunity of review-
ing the minutes of the meeting. To facili-
tate this, a copy of the minutes of the
meeting shall be mailed to each member
of the Board as soon after the meeting as
possible, and the members of the Board
shall then be allowed six days in which to
submit any objections. After this period,
candidates to whom no objections have
been raised shall be notified of their
registration, and the applications of all
other candidates shall be held over until
the next meeting at which time the deci-
sion of the members present shall be final.
Rule 7—Certificates
(a) Issuance: As soon as possible
after a candidate has been favorably pass-
ed by the Board and notified, he shall be
issued a certificate as provided for in
Section 15 of the Act. Posting date of
the notice shall be considered as time of
issuance of certificate. Each certificate
shall bear on its face the title or titles
under which the candidate is registered.
(b) Registration Numbers: Each certi-
ficate shall bear on its face a number
which shall be the registration number of
the registrant. These numbers shall be
issued consecutively in the order in which
the applications are approved by the
Board.
Rule 8—Renewal
(a) Form: An application for renewal
of a certificate shall be made on a form
furnished by the Board. It shall contain
an outline of the applicant's experience
since his certificate was issued or since it
was last renewed.
An affidavit signed by the applicant
and attested to before a notary public
shall accompany the application. The re-
newal fee required by Section 16 of the
Act shall also accompany the application.
(b) Dual Registration: Although the
law requires separate registration to prac-
tice in the respective fields of architecture,
professional engineering and land sur-
veying, only one renewal fee will be
charged for each registrant coming under
the jurisdiction of the Board.
(c) Reinstatement of Former Regis-
trants: After the full renewal period has
elapsed, to regain his professional stand-
ing, the registrant must re-apply as a new
applicant.
Rule 9—Complaints
The Board, when possible, will con-
sider each complaint for violation of the
Act at the next meeting succeeding the
date of its filing. All complaints are to
be filed with the Executive Secretary and
should contain in detail accurate facts
which will enable the Board to properly
dispose of the matter, and have hearing
if necessary.
Rule 10—Letter Ballots
Between meetings, whenever any mem-
ber of the Board, the Executive Secretary
or the Secretary considers it expedient,
the Board may consider any matters that
require early action by means of a letter
ballot. The vote on such matters shall be
considered decisive only if it is unanim-
ous. Otherwise definite action shall be
postponed until the next regular or special
meeting of the Board.
Rule 11—Revocation Hearing

Making television history, first coverage of air-sea maneuvers demonstrates
value of research by RCA Laboratories to our armed forces.
Mow television "stands watch"at soa
Picture the advantage—in military oper-
ations—when commanding officers can
watch planes, troops, ships maneuver at
long range ...
This new use of television was seen by
millions when the aircraft carrier Leyte—as
Task Force TV—maneuvered at sea before
a "battery*' of 4 RCA Image Orthicon tele-
vision cameras.
Seventy planes — Bearcats, Avengers,
Corsairs—roared from Leyte's flight deck
and catapult... dived low in mock attack
... fired rockets. And an escorting de-
stroyer stood by for possible rescues.
Action was beamed by radio to shore,
then relayed over NBC's Eastern television
network. Reception was sharp and clear on
home television receivers...
Said high officials: "The strategic impor-
tance of television in naval, military, or
air operations was dramatically revealed"
. . ."There is no doubt that television will
serve in the fields of intelligence and
combat."
Use of television as a means of military
communications is only one way in which
radio and electronic research by RCA Lab-
oratories serves the nation. All facilities of
RCA and NBC are available for develop-
ment and application of science to national
security ... in peace as well as war.

The balance system is a 3-component
unit, measuring lift, drag, and pitching
moment. The system utilizes three small
beams to which wire strain gages are
fastened, the otuput of these gages pass-
ing through an amplifying system into
an oscillograph for continuous recording
on photographic paper.
Optical observations are made using a
Schlieren system with either vertical or
horizontal knife-edge, photographically re-
cording the results on a 4 X 5 negative.
A flash of about four micro-seconds is
ordinarily used, but a steady light source
is available for observation purposes.
Pressure measurements are made with
a 50-tube manometer, using tubes of iy2
mm inner diameter. These tubes are
punched off by a clamping mechanism
when the mercury levels have been stabi-
lized. In this way, the pressure readings
can be recorded after the air flow has
stopped.
The power required to operate the tun-
nel is a maximum of about 70 horse-
power, and the operating personnel,
which consists of three men at present,
will be reduced to two men when a tim-
ing relay for controlling the valve clos-
ing is installed.
Cutaway View Showing Tunnel Installation
Problems Encountered
Space limitations allow us only to
mention some of the difficulties encoun-
tered in designing the tunnel, and to
state, all to briefly, the solutions decided
upon.
Vacuum Tanks
The vacuum tanks represent the energy
storage of the system. As they are evac-
uated, the potential energy of the system
is gradually built up, and this energy is
very quickly converted to kinetic energy
when the operating valve is opened.
The original purpose of the tanks estab-
lished their design for 60 psi internal
pressure. Analysis showed these tanks to
be critical under 14.7 psi external pres-
sure. Evacuation tests of a spare full-
scale tank resulted in collapse at 14.5
psi external pressure. Experimental work
with scaled models was then carried out
and the results indicated that each tank
would require four reinforcing rings for
satisfactory strength. These were welded
to the tanks, but the heat of the cutting
and welding work caused separations in
the seams of the tanks, and serious leak-
age problems developed. Air leaking into
the system from the outer atmosphere
carries with it high vapor content, com-
plicating the problem of drying the air
to be used in successive runs. At the
same time, such leakage, by increasing
the absolute pressure in the tanks, de-
creases the length of each test run.
After trying several sealing methods,
with little success, standard auto "body
deadener" was sprayed on all seams and
joints with highly satisfactory results.
Vacuum Pump
The vacuum pump represents the power
input of the tunnel. The pump used is
water-cooled, and some difficulty with
water seepage was experienced when it
was first put into operation. A careful
check of the pump, tightening of the
head bolts, and good general maintenance
cleared up this problem.
Air Storage Bag
The bag has the specific purpose of
supplying clean, dry air for the run, main-
taining constant pressure and temperature
conditions throughout the run. Thus it is
basically a flexible segregating device to
keep the dry wind tunnel air from be-
coming contaminated by the high mois-
ture content external air. It must have

Grinding has a part in producing the alarm
clock that wakes you in the morning — and
it plays a part in producing almost everything
that you use throughout the whole day.
• Your morning newspaper is made of ground
wood pulp — your breakfast cereal was pro-
duced by steel rolls ground smooth and true.
• The furniture in your lecture and class rooms
is cut and shaped with ground tools and
finished with coated abrasives.
&gt;
• Grinding has much to do with making the
apparatus in your laboratories.
• The office machinery that keeps the volu-
minous college records is a product of grinding.
• Grinding has an important part in producing
the sporting equipment used by your college
teams and for your personal recreation.
• Thousands of grinding operations play a
vital part in producing your automobile.
• The midnight "oil" that you burn as you*
sweat out that lab report is generated anal
distributed by equipment produced to am
important extent by grinding.

sufficient capacity so that the bag does not
completely collapse by the end of the run.
The bag was obtained as war surplus ma-
terial, formerly being a model ZKA
barrage balloon.
The bag material, although waterproof,
is not impervious to water vapor. The
neoprened fabric proved to be as good
as any of several flexible materials tested
for segregating the dry air for the tun-
nel run, but some vapor leakage exists.
This vapor is continuously removed by
the drying equipment. In addition, a
special paint developed by the Univer-
sity's Chemical Engineering Department
was used to spray the bag and decrease the
permeability.
Nozzle Section
The nozzle section houses the contoured
blocks which form the converging-diverg-
ing channel in which the supersonic flow
is obtained. This channel is basically two-
dimensional, all changes in contour be-
ing made by varying the vertical dimen-
sion of the duct while the side walls of
the housing section form the channel
sides. Furthermore, the walls must be
removable so that the contoured blocks
may be replaced for each of the various
Mach Numbers.
Considerable time and effort were ex-
pended before proper fits were obtained
which allowed for rapid removal of parts
and still did not cause discontinuities in
the inner surfaces. At first 2-inch thick
Plexiglas windows were tried, but their
optical quality proved too poor for good
Schlieren photographs, so 1-inch com-
mercial plate glass windows were used.
The glass was picked for freedom from
striations and for reasonably parallel
faces, and proved to be quite satisfactory.
The window had to be redesigned to
avoid the chipping of a special cement
used to seal the glass in the frames when
the tunnel was in operation.
Test Section
The main channel of the test section is
8 inches wide by 13 inches deep and 48
inches long. Within this channel, a
model is fixed in the airstream and the
observational, force, and pressure meas-
urement means are employed.
The basic design of the test section is
determined to a large extent by the type
of force measurement system used. In
this tunnel, a mechanical force balance
occupies the volume about the test chan-

Reverberatory Furnace Operations
GERITY-MICHIGAN CORPORATION
Demonstrate High Temperature
REVERBERATORY FURNACES designed to in-
crease the production of zinc base die casting alloys
have expanded melting and alloying capacity almost
50% over conventional pot melting. At Gerity-
Michigan Corporation, Detroit, these Gas-fired
furnaces operate on practically continuous schedules
with savings of 35% to 40% based on time-saving
methods and more efficient fuel utilization.
This application demonstrates the flexibility of
GAS for industrial heating processes in high tem-
perature ranges. But it also emphasizes the role of
GAS in the development of production-line equip-
ment for non-ferrous metals.
R. L. Wilcox, metallurgical engineer and Vice
President of Gerity-Michigan Corporation describes
firing Technique
the furnace and its application—-"This 1 8-ton
Gas-fired reverberatory furnace has the advan-
tage of extended service life, more efficient fuel
utilization, closer temperature control, simplified
alloy analysis."
Regardless of the type of heating operation or
heat-treating process, GAS is the ideal fuel for
any temperature requirement, or any production-
line application. The characteristics of GAS—
speed, flexibility, economy, controllability—arc
useful features for every industrial heating need.
In view of rapid developments it's always worth-
while to keep your eye on what's new in Modern
Gas Equipment.

through the channel and to which the
model sting is attached. Since any air-
flow about this vertical strut would ad-
versely affect the balance measurements,
the force balance volume must operate at
zero pressure differential with the test
channel, and therefore, the who!e mechan-
ism is enclosed within a pressure box.
Visual observations and optical meas-
urements are made by means of two win-
dows placed in the vertical side walls of
the test channel and in line with the
model center position. While photo-
graphic results at Mach Numbers of
about two have been good, work at Mach
Numbers of four will require greater
Schlieren sensitivity due to low test chan-

Automotive terms differ in many parts
of the world. Here, for example, are
American and British terms that mean
the same thing:
A car horn is a footer. A valve-grind
job is a decoke job. The car transmission
is a gearbox, the wind-shield a wind-
screen. Gasoline is petrol, the generator
is the dynamo, and the old-time rumble
seat is a dickey seat.
The car hood is a bonnet, and when
you talk of the car top in England you
call that the hood. The trunk is a lug-
gage boot.
You don't have a tire blow-out, you
have a "burst." When you race the en-
gine, you "rev up." The side-walk is

the life you save may be your own

Standard Oil promotes this slogan of the
National Safety Council as a reminder to the
motoring public to drive carefully. In its own
affairs, Standard Oil works and lives by the
same slogan.
In the last twelve-month period reported
(1948), our accident rates per million man-
hours were 1.51 in the company's manufac-
turing department, 3.31 in our sales depart-
ment. This compares with an average of 13.16
accidents per million man-hours in the entire
petroleum industry, and 13.^6 in all industry.
It is a record we are at all times attempting
to improve.
Because of our great interest in safety, we
are glad to see the subject getting more and
more attention every year in engineering col-
leges. Many mechanical engineering curricula
now include courses in safety engineering.
We welcome the trend. We hope that stu-
dents now being trained in safety engineering
will soon be helping to make Standard Oil
and thousands of other American companies
better, safer places to work.

on its way to Alaska to complete the test
cycle in the North. Equipment inspec-

program indicates that the Army will
have a new grease for universal use since
these greases underwent preliminary tests

result of close cooperation between the

Another example of industry and ord-

had paid much attention to what hap-
pened at temperatures below — 40° F. In-
asmuch as vehicles may be required to
operate in temperatures of below — 40° F
materiel manufacturers had no notion of
the behavior of their equipment at such
depressed temperatures. Therefore, it
was necessary that manufacturers of auto
equipment, steel, rubber, heaters, and
other materials begin research on reactions
of cold on their equipment. Various com-

mittees were called in by the Ordnance
Department to assist in finding answers to
this problem. Cooperation between indus-

Another group at the Detroit Arsenal
was presented with the problem of de-
signing a new and better all-purpose en-
gine for military vehicles. A study was
made of the possibility of using the same
size cylinder in a group of engines and
only increasing the number of cylinders to
get more power. This engine has now
been successfully designed in coopera-
tion with a manufacturer, and the com-
pany is now building two series of air-
cooled engines using a varying number
of cylinders for various required horse
power for a number of different vehicles.
There will be only two sizes of cylinders
for a wide range of engines.
This is some of the basic research that
has been accomplished recently. These
three examples are only part of the entire
program at the Detroit Arsenal. Track-
laying vehicles as well as transport ve-
hicles must be designed from the ground
up for special Army requirements. This
means research on armor, guns, sighting
equipment, tracks, cross drives and elec-
trical equipment as well as various other
items which make up an Army vehicle.

How to help a press
keep punching
In a punch press, one of the engineering prob-
lems is to keep the flywheel and drive shaft in
alignment and rotating freely in spite of terrific
shock loads.
To solve this problem, engineers specify Timken*
tapered roller bearings.
Timken bearings hold the drive shaft and fly-
wheel of a punch press rigidly in line. There's no
deflection, wobble, or end-play. Friction and wear
are negligible.
Why TIMKEN® bearings hold
shafts in alignment
The line contact between rolls and races in a
Timken bearing means wider, more rigid support
for the shaft. Due to their tapered construction,
Timken bearings carry radial and thrust loads in
any combination, eliminating deflection and end-
movement. And since wear in Timken bearings is
negligible, shaft rigidity is retained for long years
of service.

a number of shops of which the Detroit
Arsenal is an example. Here tanks are
built and tested, and production drawings
are made so that these same tanks can be
produced in large quantities if necessary.
The Detroit Arsenal is now building
one of the largest laboratories in the
world devoted to automotive research.
A cold room of a size and scope that is
exceeded only by one other cold room,
will be completed by spring. A physical
and chemical laboratory is now being
completed. These will be followed by a
number of test cells for engine testing,
a carburetor laboratory and a" fuels and
lubricants laboratory. When these are
completed, the Detroit Arsenal will have
a laboratory set-up for automotive and
allied research second to none.
There are other such laboratories in
various parts of the country equipped to
handle other problems of Army research,
such as Rock Island Arsenal for grease
research, artillery and recoil mechanisms;
Aberdeen Proving Ground for firing data;
Frankford Arsenal for small arms ammu-
nition, fire control, fuses and instruments;
(continued from page 32)
Watervliet Arsenal for cannon manufac-
ture; Watertown Arsenal for anti-aircraft
defense, armor, steel and casting research
and development; Springfield Ordnance
Engine Dunked While Running
Depot for small aims; and Picatinny Ar-
senal for powder and explosives.
The other services also have a number
of laboratories for research. For example,
the Quartermaster Corps has Camp Lee
and Camp Philadelphia, the Signal Corps
has Fort Monmouth, the Engineer Corps
has Fort Belvoir, the Air Corps has Eglin
Field, Wright Field, and the Navy has the
Naval Bureau at Washington, D.C. and
Electronic Laboratory at San Diego, Cali-
fornia.
The Armed services do not play a lone
hand in research. Not only do they unite
with various technical committees whose
business it is to be familiar with the vari-
ous projects, but many universities and
laboratories are under contract for all
types and kinds of research work. The
University of Michigan is conducting a
number of research problems for various
departments of the armed services at the
present time.
There are sufficient laboratories cover-
ing all the fields of research to insure a
place for anyone who wishes to pursue
government research after he leaves
school. Contacts through committees of
all the various engineering societies en-
able the student to meet the top leaders
in any field, broadening his knowledge
and enabling him to develop acquaint-
ances which could help further his career.

Why surfaces now last longer
Small BOY'S BIKE or great ocean liner... there are finishes
for each so improved today that a one or two coat job holds
up longer than did dozens before.
Heat and cold, acids and gases, water or salt air just don't
crack and peel today's surface coatings as they once did. For
our homes and cars, our great bridges, our machinery for
farms and industry are now protected as never before.
Better materials—aided by research—bring us this better
protection. New plastics and chemicals, for example, that go
into quick-drying varnishes, lacquers, paints that keep a
like-new finish.
Industrial gases help us, too. In flame-cleaning structural
steel, the oxy-acetylene flame provides a clean, dry and
warm surface into which paint "bites" instantly and dries
quickly.
There's also stainless steel, the lustrous metal that needs
no surface protection... that withstands wear and corrosion
on equipment used outdoors or in... and keeps gleamingly
clean year after year.
The people of Union Carbide produce many materials
essential to today's superior surfaces and surface coalings.
They also produce hundreds of other materials for the use
of science and industry, to help maintain American leader-
ship in meeting the needs of mankind.

PROBLEM You're designing a radio broadcast trans-
mitter. The circuit includes condensers and other variable
elements which must be adjusted by the operator. You want
to place these elements for optimum circuit efficiency and
where they will be easy to assembly, wire, and service. At
the same time, you want to centralize the control knobs at a
point convenient to the operator. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER
Use S.S.Whlte remote control type flexible shafts to couple
the variable elements to their control knobs. This leaves you
free to place both the elements and the knobs anywhere you
want them. And you get control
that is as smooth and sensitive
as a direct connection because
S.S.White remote control flexible
shafts are engineered expressly
for this kind of service.
This Is just one of hundreds
of remote control and power
drive problems to which
S.S.White flexible shafts pro-
vide a simple answer. That's
why every engineer should be
familiar with the range and

GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT
OPPORTUNITIES
(continued from page 34)
Employment practices parallel industry although they may
vary slightly from agency to agency. A job evaluation pro-
gram, familiar to students of industrial management, character-
izes Federal government employment. The purpose of this
program is to pay equal ranges of rates for jobs comparable in
difficulty and responsibility in the same or different agencies.
The present beginning salary for engineering and scientific
graduates without advanced study or experience is $2,974
per year. In from three to five years after graduation, most
engineers find themselves making about $440 per month.
One of the aspects of Federal employment seemingly least
important to some young men but of actual concern to every-
one is the provision made for retirement. The government,
being unable to provide any system of profit sharing such as
some private industries do, offers the retirement plan as an
alternative. A young graduate entering Federal service at the
age of 25 would, at 60, and with an average salary level of
$7,000 over any consecutive five year period, retire with a
monthly income of $200 per month. Retirement at 55 would
also be possible, the monthly income being slightly less. This
retirement plan with automatic deductions of 6% from the
base pay often attracts many who do not see the career possi-
bilities.
Incentive plans and rewards for superior accomplishment
are not lacking in Federal service. Periodic increases through
a merit rating plan within each salary range offer employees
salary advancements, and for outstanding professional or ad-
ministrative accomplishments, most agencies provide further
salary or promotional advancements. In addition, suggestion
programs with substantial cash awards offer further incentives
to the ambitious professional employee..
Vacation and sick leave provisions of 26 and 15 working
days a year respectively provide opportunity for relaxation
and protection against income stoppages because of illness.
Political influences are not a factor in determining ad-
vancement in Federal service. Ability, initiative and hard
work are the measuring sticks of a man's success in any type
of employment.
Many industries now offer young engineers opportunity
to be trained in their particular methods. Government again
parallels industry. Characteristic of such a plan is the Detroit
Arsenal's six- to eight-month plan of training graduate engi-
neers. Work in each one of the sections of the Development
and Engineering Department branches including laboratory
work, board work, and simple design projects, plus familiari-
zation with shop practices and review of technical literature
relating to ordnance vehicle design and development, provides
an opportunity for a basic introduction to automotive engi-
neering and its allied fields as related to the work of the
Arsenal.
Opportunities for specialization include fields of Ordnance
Engineering, Automotive Research Engineering, Automotive
Design Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, Materials En-
gineering and Electrical Engineering. The Ordnance Engineer
concerns himself with fire control mechanisms and their use in
controlling gunfire of vehicles. The Automotive Research
Engineer conducts research in the laboratories with respect to

Products of the laboratory
are saving time, toil, money
for the American farmer
Through chemistry, farmers are gain-
ing control over many of nature's un-
certainties. Costly losses of crops and
livestock are being curtailed or pre-
vented. Efficiency is increasing. New
applications of chemistry to agricul-
ture are becoming more important
than ever as demands for more pro-
duction increase.
Today, new organic insecticides
and fungicides help control insects,
plant diseases and blights that threat-
en crops. Seed disinfectants and pro-
tectants help guarantee bountiful
harvests by protecting crops in the
critical period after planting. Plant
hormones hold fruit on trees until
fully ready for picking.
Days of labor saved
Du Pont weed killers and explosives
accomplish in minutes tasks that
used to take hours or days of back-
breaking labor. With 2,4-D farmers
can kill weeds without harming cer-
tain crops. Dynamite removes
stumps, digs ditches for draining and
irrigation, and loosens the soil to
forestall erosion.
New fertilizer formulations meet
the changing nutritional require-
ments of plants during the growing
season. Thus the farmer has better
control over crop development, and
he can utilize his materials, labor and
Du Pont agricultural specialist Dr. Arne Carl-
son, M.S., '40, Ph.D., U. of Minnesota, '48,
helps develop sprays and dusts to control
fungous diseases.
Phenolhiaiine kills more kinds of livestock
worms in more kinds of animals than any
other drug . . . promotes normal growth.
For growth insurance, farmers treat seeds with
disinfectants. "Ceresan" treated wheat gives up
to 20% better yields.
Spraying orchards controls infestations of in-
sects or plant diseases ... or holds fruit on
the trees until it is fully ready for picking!
equipment more efficiently.
Feed compounds, developed by
industry, are making poultry flocks
and livestock herds vastly more pro-
ductive. Research on chemicals to
control animal diseases and internal
parasites is making great progress.
Control of insect pests is already
changing livestock management
practices.
Turning Ideas Into products
Achievements such as these are the
result of Du Font's team research.
An idea may start with one or two
individuals. But many specialists—
chemists, physicists, biologists, plant
pathologists, and entomologists —
must contribute their skills before a
new product is ready for market.
Normally, engineers—chemical, me-
chanical, civil, and electrical — de-
velop the commercial processes and
plants for making the finished prod-
ucts.
The new Du Pont employee,
whether he holds a bachelor's, mas-
ter's, or doctor's degree, enters into
this cooperative effort. Yet the im-
mediate group with which he is asso-
ciated is small and congenial, offering
him every opportunity to display
individual talent and capabilities.

the performance of automotive compon-
ents. Metallurgical and Materials Engi-
neers engage in the applications and uses
of materials in vehicles. The Electrical
Engineer is the specialist on the mass of
electrical problems which characterize the
specialized automotive vehicle.
Other agencies have programs designed
to achieve the same aim. The variety of
work performed often gives the young
engineer a greater familiarity with all
phases of his field. The Civil Engineer
finds employment with such agencies as
the Corps of Engineers in supervising the
construction of airfields, dams, buildings
and other varied types of structures built
for Army purposes. This experience is of
great value whether his future lies in in-
dustry or government.
Other agencies as well as the Arsenal
have production facilities for further
evaluation of products. The Northern
Regional Research Laboratory of the De-
partment of Agriculture at Peoria, Illi-
nois, not only develops uses for farm
products but also engineers the completed
commercial process with pilot plant tech-
niques. Chemical Engineers play an im-
portant part in this phase. The Food and
Container Institute of the Armed Forces,
located in Chicago, Illinois, develops nu-
tritional and palate-satisfying diets for a
wide variety of climatic and energy poten-
tial conditions; in addition, mechanical
engineers design special food packaging
or food container fabricating machinery
to make such products commercially feas-
ible to produce. Constant contact with all
industry characterizes such projects.
In summary, I have found in my gov-
ernment career that I have more oppor-
tunity for research and contact with
industry as a whole than I found possible
in industry. The working conditions are
satisfactory and the pay while not com-
parable to the highest paid jobs in private
industry, is reasonably comparable to in-
dustry. Whether it is the Corps of Engi-
neers, the Navy Department, the Bureau
of Reclamation, or the Ordnance Branch
of the Department of the Army that one
enters, opportunities always exist to meet
challenging research problems, and con-
tact with industry is at a maximum.

stretches tin supply
-makes better, less expensive tin-plated products
•pioneered by Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corporation
p Before the war, almost all tin plate was made
by the hot-dip method in which a sheet of steel
was coated by dipping it into molten tin. In
the 1930's, Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corporation, a
member of the United States Steel family, played
an important role in the research work and the
technological development of the electrolytic
process—an improved tinning method in which a
strip of steel is given a thin, uniform coating of
tin by passing continuously and rapidly through
a bath of special plating solution. This process
necessitated the development, by Carnegie-
Illinois engineers, of complex mechanical equip-
ment completely revolutionary in the industry.
Since the electrolytic process covers a given
area of steel with only one-third the amount of
tin that the hot-dip method requires, it makes
the tin supply go 3 times as far.
Today, United States Steel Corporation has
nine electrolytic tin-plating lines producing U-S-S
1'errostan. These lines arc helping to lower the
cost of tin-plated steel . . . stretch the supply of
tin—and make better tin-plated products.

and development calls for corresponding progress in
processing, equipment design, and production
methods.
Long-range research leads naturally and logically
into practical production applications.
So now, as through 112 years of progress, the key-
note at P &amp; G is scientific teamwork—close coopera-
tion for continued progress.

Ann Arbor, Mich., Dec. 12, 1948—The
West Quad Radio Club has at last succeeded
in erecting its twenty-foot tower, with ro-
tary beam antenna attached, on the top of the
Williams House tower above the main entrance
to the West Quadrangle.
This news item is a masterpiece of
understatement, as it represents the cul-
mination of almost two years of intensive
preparation and work. The story begins
with the first few weeks of the fall semes-
ter of 1946, when two freshmen residents
of the West Quadrangle, Don Wheat and
Ward Cornelius, with the aid of Mr. E. B.
Holden, resident adviser of Adams
House, formed the West Quad Radio
Club.
Under the guidance of Mr. Holden the
student members wrote a constitution,
and elected officers, in the form of a non-
profit corporation. The Club then ob-
tained a license from the Federal Com-
munications Commission to operate on all
Amateur radio bands.
With this beginning the club was ready
to go on the air in a very limited fashion.
Only those members who held individual
Amateur licenses were allowed to broad-
cast. Since one of the aims of the club
is to increase the amount of radio com-
munication by University of Michigan
students, an effort was made to help in-
terested men obtain their licenses. To-
ward this end, the Club held classes deal-
ing in basic radio theory and the inter-
national Morse code.
For equipment, the Club leased a B.C.
610 transmitter from one member, and a
B.C. 348 receiver from another. These
are both pieces of Army surplus equip-
ment which are well suited to Amateur
use. The Club was also able to obtain a
fifth floor storage room from the Uni-
versity for a radio shack.
On May 8, 1947, the Club held an
inaugural banquet and demonstrated the
work of radio Amateurs to a number of
University officials. This, however, merely
accentuated the limitations of the existing
equipment, for it was then impossible to
communicate with anyone outside of
Michigan. This fact merely served to
amplify the old Amateur maxim that
"getting out is ninety per cent antenna
and ten per cent power." Here, the Club
was clearly faced with the need for some

other type of antenna hookup.
The original antenna was a folded
dipole. This is much like the ordinary
radio receiving aerial in that it radiates
power uniformly in all directions. To
replace this, the Club decided on a Yagi
parasitic array, commonly referred to as a
rotary beam. This "rig" makes use of
directors and a reflector to concentrate the
radiation in much the same way a para-
bolic reflector concentrates a light beam.
This four element array is theoretically
capable of increasing the effective power
out by a factor of ten in transmission
and increasing the rejection factor of un-
desired signals in reception by a factor
of thirty to fifty. With these advantages
in mind, Bruce Winert, President of the
Club, surveyed the situation during the
summer of 1947, and drew up the rough
plans. Thus, when the Club reassembled
for the first fall meeting, a set of plans
was ready for their approval, and the
main gearbox and spindle of the rotating
mechanism were completed. The plans
were approved by the Club, and then by
the Board of Governors of the Residence
Halls, and the way was clear for the final
design and construction.
The biggest part of this story for the
engineer in this project is not just the
design details, but the considerations and
sequence of events that made them as
they exist today. As mentioned, at the
beginning of the fall semester of 1947,
the rough plans of the tower and its re-
lationship to the building existed, but
that was all. Aside from the few plans
of the partially completed rotating mech-
anism, no details for any other part of
the project existed.
The problem was this:First; a beam set-
up was needed which could be readily
rotated, and second; be a visible and har-
monious part of the West Quad Architec-
ture. The second factor was ruled to be
the most important and everything else
was subordinated toward designing an
antenna installation which would fit these
conditions. This foremost consideration
ruled that regardless of mechanical diffi-
culties, length of feedline, of need for
complex controls, the position directly
over the radio shack would have to be
ignored if in favor of the desired sym-
metry with the building and a pleasing
effect to the eye. Therefore, the top of
the Williams House tower was chosen,
which is the central architectural feature
of the West Quad.
Another sales point to secure final Uni-
versity approval was a design which
would eliminate any permanent disfigure-
ment or damage to the building so that
during the tower's useful life there would
be no .antenna-connected maintenance,
and should this "rig" be no longer need-
ed, the tower and beam can be removed
with no trace of it's existence.
The most unique thing about the design
is the fact that the legs are not attached
to the roof of the building. All but verti-
cal support is furnished by eight guy
wires. This method was used to eliminate
leaks in the roof which might be attribu-
table to the tower mounting. And, as
mentioned, should the need for the tower
no longer exist it can be taken down by
removing the eight guy cables. This
method of anchorage determined the
character of the rest of the tower design.
Guying the tower top and bottom, as
was done in this method, served to lessen
the expected stresses, by changing the
tower from a cantilever pole with axial
compression and torsion to a simply sup-
ported pole with the same torsion but

ENGINEERING EDUCATION
by
The ail-important contribution of elec-
trical engineering education has been to
build up a professional group whose
technical ideology is that of analytical
thoroughness and correctness in detail,
all in one extremely significant, yet very
restricted, area of applied science. This
thoroughness of training has achieved
depth with great success. The advent of
electronics, however, demands a broader
outlook. Having achieved depth in the
past, the engineering schools will be
compelled by the impacts of electronics
to achieve breadth in the future, and they
must find a way to do so without sacri-
ficing the strength to be found in depth.
Twenty years of effort toward increas-
ing the vigor and influencing the direc-
tion of the impacts of electronics on
engineering education have crystallized
for me certain guiding philosophies
which it is the purpose of this article to
express. I present just my own thoughts;
I am not voicing the official points of
view of the professional and educational
organizations with which I have the
pleasure of being associated. Critical
comment will be welcomed.
Bear in mind that I am, by early train-
ing and present interest, a power and in-
dustrial electrical engineer, not a radio
and communications engineer. I have a
nostalgic memory for the abrupt roar of
the generators of a hydro-electric station
when lightning strikes on the high line;
the steady drone of the generators of a
metropolitan power station still gives me
a homelike sense of security.
Long ago the electrical engineering pro-
fession adopted as the cornerstone of its
educational structure a requirement that
all 4-year students in electrical engineering
must acquire a working mastery of 60-
cycle a-c power circuit principles and
practice. By this single requirement we
probably demand of our students greater
thoroughness in a difficult discipline of
applied mathematics than is required of
undergraduate students in any other
branch of science. Some years ago I
heard a very able theoretical physicist dis-
cuss with his class of advanced physics
students how electrical engineers have
PROFESSOR W. G. DOW
(Reprint—Electrical Engineering)
developed very powerful and mathemati-
cally elegant methods of electric circuit
analysis; he used much the same tone ot
respect, then, for our standard tools, that
might be used now for his own under-
standing of plutonium atom bombs.
We deserve his respect, for we have
achieved strength in depth, but to do so
we have limited our field severely. Thus
we have selected as our paramount mathe-
matical tool the linear second order dif-
ferential equation, with solutions in terms
of a-c vector diagrams and the imaginary-
number operator; relative to all of applied
mathematics this is a highly specialized
equation. We give primary attention only
to the steady-state solution for two stand-
ard frequencies, zero and 60 cycles per
second. We have had the pleasure of
working with a narrowly-selected set of
materials: copper, iron, and a few stand-
ard insulators, subjected to a very limit-
ed range of temperatures, perhaps 300
degrees Fahrenheit over-all. Within this
range our materials have almost constant
properties. We have worked toward a
rather limited set of objectives: of mak-
ing things go around, of delivering light
and heat wherever wanted, and of con-
veying intelligence. These various ele-
ments of narrowness permit mathematical
methods to become habitual; thus, there is
a point to a criticism once voiced by
Doctor C .F. Hirshfeld, while he was
director of research for the Detroit Edi-
son Company, that the typical electrical
engineer experiences a mental block if
faced with a problem not immediately
susceptible to mathematical expression.
Thus we have insisted, quite successfully,
that our students come to know a very
great deal about a very little bit of the
area of logical analysis as applied to
physical sciences. That little bit is very
difficult to master, is of immense economic
importance, and governs the activities of
the thousands of individuals who man
the electric power industry.
My theme is that having achieved depth
in the past, we will be compelled by the
impacts of electronics to incorporate
breadth in the future, and that we must
find ways to do so without sacrificing our
present strength in depth.
"Electronics—What does it mean?
Ten years ago the word "electronics"
implied the study of the internal be-
havior of electron tubes. As used today
in trade journals, it seems to encompass
all of electrical engineering except the
highly specialized study of d-c and 60-
cycle circuits and machinery. This all-em-
bracing usage as a sort of advertising
catch phrase may be unfortunate, but we
are having to live with it.
During the recent war the mental work
area we call electronics emerged from a
chrysalis period during which it had been
a segment of the communication arts. We
now think rather of communication as
one of the important work areas within
the electronic arts, but this also will
change. I anticipate that the eventual in-
tegration of "electronics" into electrical
engineering will be, not as a description
of an applicational field, but as a partner
with circuits, electromagnetic fields, and
the electrodynamics of machinery, as one
of the several major areas of electrical
subject matter. Thus it would seem to me
confusing to speak of a power option and
an electronics option in our curriculum,
because electronic apparatus is of major
importance in the electric power industry.
If we offer two options, one should em-
phasize communication, the other power
and industrial applications; both must
incorporate substantial work in electronics.
Motivation
Educationally, electronics is a sort ot
brilliant and ambitious problem child.
Electronics is at present a primary moti-
vation in some 60 to 95 per cent of the
very large 4-year student enrollment,
and in over 95 per cent of the very
popular fifth-year master's degree en-
rollment. This motivation is so strong
as to make it difficult to maintain a proper
balance in training.
Largely because of electronics, under-
graduate enrollment in electrical engineer-
ing in the United States is experiencing a
"traveling wave" of disturbingly high
crest value; the crest will be three to six

— MAGNETRON CONSTRUCTION
by
ALBERT J. FORMAN, '50E
The increased use and realization of
the great possibilities of microwaves have
encouraged the Engineering Research In-
stitute to probe into this comparatively
new field. To further the study of ultra-
high frequency generation, the Depart-
ment of Electrical Engineering has placed
its research facilities at the disposal of the
government and interested private com-
panies.
For the past two years, the United
States Army Signal Corps has sponsored
a project under the supervision of Prof.
William G. Dow to study the design, con-
struction and operation of the magnetron.
During this period, the research team,
directed by Mr. H. W. Welch who is
assisted by Mr. J. Black and aided by Mr.
Gunnar Hole as an expert consultant, has
made notable progress and stands out as
one of the most advanced groups in the
country insofar as certain phases of the
magnetron are concerned.
Before proceeding with a detailed de-
scription of the techniques employed in
the construction of the magnetron in this
project, it will be helpful briefly to re-
view some basic theoretical laws that gov-
ern design procedures. We are familiar
with the LC resonant tank circuit com-
monly used at ordinary radio frequencies.
At ultra-high frequencies, a short length
of conductor acts as an inductance, and
if the proper length conductor is bent in
a U shape, we have a distributed capaci-
tance between both sides of the wire, so
it therefore acts as a resonant circuit. If
we were to take a solid cylinder, drill a
hole along its axis and mill slots radiating
perpendicularly from the axis like spokes
on a wheel, we would essentially have a
series of resonant cavities.
In order for the cavities to oscillate,
energy must be supplied. This is done by
supplying electrons by means of a heated
filament inserted along the axis of the
cylinder and applying a high DC potential
to the hollowed cylinder acting as an
anode. A magnetic field is impressed
along the axis of the filament. As an
electron moves outward from the directly
heated cathode, it accumulates energy
from the DD field and is accelerated to-
ward the anode. The magnetic field exerts
a force on the electron causing it to move
in an essentially circular path. The ro-
tational motion transfers the DC field
energy to the RF field and this energy
conversion is continual until the electron
finally is collected by the anode.
The materials used in tube construction
must be chosen with great care in view
of certain vacuum considerations. The
metal must have low vapor pressures at
the operation temperatures in order to
prevent volatilizing of the metal which
would coat the inside of the tube. A hard
vacuum is required, so if we kept pump-
ing and heating the tube, substances in-
side with low vapor pressures would
evaporate. The materials must be dense
to prevent leaks at the crystalline bound-
aries. Not only do the parts have to be
clean, but we must use OFHC (Oxygen
Free High Conductivity) copper since the
regular commercial types have enough
oxide in them so that when they are
heated in a hydrogen atmosphere, the
oxide reduces to copper leaving the body
porous. Hot-rolled is the best type of
steel to use since it is almost free of axial
tubular holes or cracks.
Kovar, an alloy of nickel, cobalt,
manganese, and iron is used for glass-to-
metal seals. It melts at 1450°C, has low
heat conductivity, and is easily machined,
welded or soldered. The metal is usually
heat treated and oxidized to strengthen
the bond of glass blown on it. It is
usually soldered with a gold-copper alloy
because the latter doesn't alloy at the
Kovar crystalline boundaries. If used
with a solder that has a greater tendency
to wet at the crystalline boundaries, ther-
mal cycles will cause cracks in the Kovar.
Kovar has the unique property of possess-
ing the same coefficient of expansion as
Corning 7052 glass. Kovar seals replace
the old type of housekeepers seal ( copper
tapered down to a feather edge) which
was mechanically weak and difficult to
construct.
Joining components by brazing in a
hydrogen furnace is an important factor
in the construction of the tube. The parts
are brazed in oxygen-free atmosphere to
maintain accurate dimensions of the
pieces to keep them clean, and because no
flux is required. The laboratory has three
furnaces, two capable of attaining 1100°C
and one for small parts which will reach
over 1800°C. When we want to join
two parts, we clean them before brazing
so the solder will wet the surface when
molten. Next, we place a ring of solder
at the joint and mount it on a jig to
align the parts before soldering. The jig
is made of stained steel, pre-oxidized to
form a layer of chrome oxide to which
solder does not adhere. Thus, when we
place the jig and parts in the furnace,
they are not inadvertently brazed together.
Surface tension and adhesive forces pull
the solder into small cracks, making a
vacuum tight joint.
From experimental curves in a hand-
book we learn the characteristics of dif-
ferent types of solder at various tempera-
tures. For example, in using BT solder,
72% silver and 28% copper, we must
reduce the temperature as soon as it melts
or it will change to a crystalline phase by
dissolving copper into the solder, causing
leaks at the crystalline boundaries. When
using gold-copper solder (37% gold—
63% copper), the dissolving of copper
into the solder is advantageous because it
raises the melting point of the resulting
solution. This permits us to make suc-
cessive brazings without melting the
previous joint. Where high temperatures
and low vapor pressures are required,
platinum (melting point 1773°C) is
used. Pure copper solder is used to join
pieces having melting temperatures higher
than copper.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


England in 1872, the son of Frederick Charles and Christina
deWilde (Cater) Sadler. Although he was a lineal descendent
of Sir Ralph Sadler of the sixteenth century, he often referred
to himself as a full fledged cockney because he was born within
the sound of Bow Bells. His early training was in private
schools and at Dulwich College, London, following which he
entered Glasgow University in 1890 and received the Bachelor
of Science in 1893. After the next three years spent in ship-
building on the Clyde, he was appointed Assistant Professor
of Naval Architecture at his Alma Mater and served there for
four years. Glasgow honored her distinguished son with a
Doctor of Science in 1902 and a Doctor of Laws in 1927.
The scarlet gown, which signified these degrees, was a striking
feature of Michigan's academic processions in which Dean
Sadler customarily served as Parade Marshall.
Following the Spanish-American War, the creation of a
Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering in
the University of Michigan became a live question which re-
sulted in the Regents formally establishing such a Department.
After Dean Cooley exhausted the possibilities among Americans
educated in this field, he accepted the suggestion of some mem-
bers of our Corps of Construction in the United States Navy
who had studied under Professor Sadler at Glasgow. The pro-
fessorship was offered to him, he accepted and came here in
1900. He immediately became acquainted with our shipbuilding
industries and established himself as a consulting naval architect
and marine engineer. As such, in association with Mr. Kirby
of Detroit, he designed the great passenger ships for the Detroit
and Cleveland Navigation Co., the City of Detroit III, the City
of Cleveland, the City of Buffalo, the Greater Detroit, the
Eastern States and the Western States.
In 1903-1905 Professor Sadler designed and, working with
the model maker, installed our naval tank, 360 feet long and
22 feet wide with a depth of water of 10 feet, and the asso-
ciated model cutting machine and tank carriage, which had been
donated by a Detroit steel firm. Thus Michigan became the
first school in the country which could carry on researches
relating to ship resistance, shallow water effects, streamline flow,
wave profiles, wake and rolling in a full sized tank. This
astonished engineers in the East who, on meeting Professor
Sadler with his students on a Spring recess trip, expressed
astonishment at the establishment of such training and facilities
way out west in the prairies. When the prohibition era struck
the country, toastmasters invariably, when his tank was referred
to, queried as to whether it was his personal tank. He was
joined by Professor E. M. Bragg at this time and they did
much fundamental research on "fining" the ends of lake
freighters in the tank and a great deal of assistance was given
on lake transport problems. Professor Sadler had a rare gift
of being able to guess right on these situations, the results being
confirmed after long and arduous tests and computations by the
associated staff.
Dean Sadler was a frequent contributor to the scientific and
educational societies with which he was affiliated and presented
30 or more papers between 1897 and 1933. In 1920 he
served as expert for the French Government in an arbitration
case and in 1930, and later, was a member of the Consulting
Board on the proposal to establish four-day service of American
ships across the Atlantic. He was a member of the London
Institute of Naval Architects, the American Society of Naval
Architects and Marine Engineers, the Scottish Institute of Engi-
neers and Shipbuilders, the Royal Society of Great Britain and
the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
He was appointed Dean of the combined Colleges of Engi-
neering and Architecture in 1928 and served as chief adminis-
trator of engineering until his retirement on account of illness
in 1937. He was peculiarly fitted for this honor, being a man
of broad culture and education together with unfailing courtesy
and thoughtfulness. To work with him was a pleasure and in-
spiration and could not fail to engender hearty admiration and
sincere affection. His interest covered every member of the
engineering staff who, with their wives, were warmly welcomed
at his home. He also counted it a pleasure to accept the many
invitations to student functions which were given him.
In spite of such an intense professional life, Dean Sadler
led a full-rounded social life. He was a member of the Kathole-
pistemaid faculty dinner club and the Apostles, of the Phi
Gamma Delta fraternity and Michigamua, of Sigma Xi, Tau
Beta Pi, Phi Kappa Phi, Vulcans, Quarterdeck and Sigma Rho
Tau. His favorite sport was golf which he enjoyed at the Ann
Arbor Golf &amp; Outing Club. Other clubs in which he main-
tained membership were Rotary, University and the Engineers of
New York. Dean Sadler was also a member of the vestry
of St. Andrews Episcopal Church.
Professor Sadler married Margaret Wenley in 1919, a daugh-
ter of the late Professor Robert Mark Wenley. She and four
children survive him, a son, Robert, a graduate from the Uni-
versity—BS 1941, and three daughters, Christine, Winifred
and Margaret.

Perhaps the most necessary "luxury"
that the average American possesses to-
day is his private automobile. Within
the space of 30 years, the motor vehicle
has emerged from an oddity into an ac-
cepted and literally indispensible part of
American society. Not only have the
number of private cars increased enorm-
ously, but the advantages offered by the
motor vehicle were quickly seen by pub-
lic transit and commercial enterprises.
The tremendous growth of the trans-
portation industry during the 20th Cen-
tury has reached such proportions that
today, fully one-seventh of our popu-
lation is employed in the automotive or
allied fields.
The unprecedented growth for high-
way transportation brought about a
cry for roads and more roads, and in
1916 a national law was passed allo-
cating federal funds for the building and
improvement of rural highways, and in
connection with this act many of the
states set up their own highway com-
missions. However, the cities, as a rule,
did not fare so well. In many instances,
they were already built up to such an ex-
tent that the widening of old streets and
the construction of new ones was thought
Hazardous Intersection:
(a) before treatment
to be impracticable. In justice to those
many cities, it is only fair to say that no
one could have envisioned the extent
to which motor travel would eventually
develop. Nevertheless, streets which at
one time were sufficiently wide to permit
two buggies to pass with ease, were sud-
denly called upon to handle a vast influx
of high-speed cars. In short, just too
many automobiles were being built for the
capacities of then-existing city thorough-
fares. Everyone who has ever driven a
by

car is familiar with the result; terribly
congested streets, lack of parking space,
and immeasurably slow progress. It is
probably no understatement to say that
to drive six blocks through the central
business district of a large metropolitan
area is a nerve-wracking experience from
which one does not rapidly recover.
Perhaps 20 years ago, the problem
of street traffic control was fully de-
lineated, but even then it was far from
the beginnings of a solution, for these
reasons: every motorist was a self-styled
traffic expert and fantastic solutions were
many to be had; politics entered more
than necessary and the doctrine of "the
greatest good for the greatest number"
was lost sight of in the scramble of alder-
men and ward-bosses to have solved their
own small traffic difficulties; and perhaps
the greatest drawback of all was desire
for "false economy" on the part of many
city officials who failed to realize what a
few dollars spent for traffic improvements
would mean in increased property values,
increased retail trade, and reduction of
accidents. However, over a period of
years, out of this welter of confused
thought and action, emerged what is
now recognized as the true approach to
the problem: the establishment of a traf-
fic bureau within the government of each
city with full power and authority to
attack traffic problems in the way it feels
necessary, without political interferences
and with full cooperation from the police
department and the public safety commis-
sion. Granted, many cities still do not
have the ideal set-up, but nevertheless,
the right way has been at last pointed out.
The head of such a department and the
men under him are popularly called traffic
engineers, and it is their job to reduce
the two main stumbling blocks in urban
street travel, namely, congestion and acci-
dents. One is not the cause of the other;
rather both are the direct result of some
inherent difficulty in the street system. It
is the job of the traffic engineer to dis-
cover these inadequacies and remedy them
to the best of his ability.
There is no panacea for the solution
of all traffic problems; every un-
protected intersecttion, every grade cross-
ing, every narrow street is a problem
both in itself and in its relation to the
remainder of the streets in the city, and
the correction of these faults demands the
services of an expert, a trained traffic
engineer. The correction of, or installa-
tion of traffic control devices is essen-
tially an engineering problem, and as
such must be handled by an engineer, not
a politician. It is plain, though, that the
best type of geometric design, or the most
carefully through out system of traffic con-
trol is useless unless adequately overseen.
Consequently the close cooperation of the
police department is not only helpful, but
absolutely necessary if the traffic engineer
is to succeed. Education is likewise essen-
tial for complete success in a traffic pro-
gram. The public must know and appre-

Ship Course Recorder
new instrument, which automatically and
continuously records a ship's course, has
been developed by engineers of the Gen-
eral Electric Company.
The "Ship steering recorder" marks
the ship's rudder position and compass
direction, and calculates any deviation
from the set course on a moving roll of
paper. Nine of the instruments have been
delivered to the U.S. Navy for experi-
mental installation in several destroyer
and submarine chart rooms. The device
can detect an error in course as slight as
two-tenths of a degree.
Developed in the G-E General Engi-
neering and Consulting Laboratory, the
steering recorder takes up no more room
than a table-model radio-phonograph.
The record is kept on a 12-inch-wide roll
of waxed paper, passing beneath metal
points which are connected electrically
with the ship's rudder and compass.
Running at low speed, the instrument can
make a continuous eight-day record with-
out attention.
No permanent installations of the re-
corder have been made aboard ship as
yet. The Navy is using the instruments
at the present time to check the accuracy
of experimental "automatic pilots" for
ships.
Hi-Speed Escape
The pilot of the future may safely escape
his disabled supersonic craft at high alti-
tudes where an ordinary parachute would
be useless. He would be enclosed in a
bullet-shaped metal capsule with a
propeller on its tip, known as a "super-
sonic parachute" or rotochute.
Developed by G-E engineers, the de-
vice is designed for use in rocket research
and is capable of gently lowering delicate
research instruments to the ground from
rockets flying at altitudes as high as 100
miles. Released from a rocket, the device
slows gradually from supersonic speeds
to about 27 miles per hour by means of
its whirling propeller or vanes which
act as an air brake.
Although not intended now for use by
humans, the rotochute might be rede-
signed so that it could carry a pilot and
could be fired by an explosive charge from
a rocket. The pilot then could guide the
course of the rotochute by controlling the
pitch of its vanes and land with greater
accuracy than is possible with an ordi-
nary parachute.
It might even be possible to lower an
entire rocket by means of a rotochute,
while present research rockets are com-
pletely destroyed in landing.
Planes of the future, particularly long-
range transports and bombers, may find
use for the rotochute. Such planes, travel-
ing at extremely high altitudes, will neces-
sitate some type of escape capsule,
which can be expelled from the planes
and safely lower passengers.
Other possible future uses of the roto-
chute would be for supplying food and
medicine to isolated areas in flooded
regions, and for landing heavy equip-
ment, such as tanks and guns, at a pre-
selected spot. Great accuracy can be ob-
tained when the device is launched from
a helicopter or small plane. A package
can be dropped within a 10-foot circle.
Try it Sideways
Reflecting the widely held belief that
U.S. passenger cars since the war have
become longer and wider, many cartoon-
ists have humorously depicted the prob-
lems that result.
Of the 16 "large size" makes of cars
today, for which prewar models were

available, only two are longer from bump-
er to bumper, while two others are
shorter. Five cars are wider today—but
four others are narrower.
More interior room, and larger trunks,
have been added to postwar cars—but
without any significant changes in over-all
dimensions. It's been done in most cases
by moving the engine forward and by
moving the body out to the width form-
erly occupied only by fenders.
One of the largest selling passenger
cars, for example, was restyled this year,
to look longer and wider, and to provide
more interior and luggage space. But its
width of 71.7 inches is iy2 inches nar-
rower than before, and its length of 196.7
inches is a gain of just half an inch.
The nation's widest passenger car is
nearly 82 y2 inches wide. It was com-
pletely restyled last year. But it's no
wider than in 1941, and its 226-inch
length is shorter than in 1941.
The nation's longest car is nearly 235
inches long—and has not changed in
length since before the war.
The greatest postwar width increase
has been 4 inches, on one car that is not
among the industry's widest. iSmilarly,
the greatest length increase has been 4
inches, by a car in the medium-length
group.
Tunnel Lighting
The longest, continuous lighting in-
stallation in the w^rld, in which four
ribbons of fluorescent light will extend
almost two miles, has been designed by
New York City's Triborough Bridge and
Tunnel Authority in collaboration with
engineers of the General Electric Com-
pany.
First of its kind, the installation will
illuminate the new Brooklyn-Battery tun-
nel now being constructed under New
York Harbor by the Triborough Bridge
and Tunnel Authority.
Each of the tunnel's two tubes will
carry two lanes of traffic, and will be
lighted by twin rows of white fluorescent
lamps, the engineers said. A total of
5,776 individual lamps, each six feet
long, will comprise the entire installation.
The lamps will be housed in clear Pyrex
"pipe" near the top of the sidewalls of
the tubes.
The continuous lighting will prevent
a succession of bright spots and shadows
along the tunnel. Automobile drivers
will not be dazzled by the flashing effect
of intermittent lighting on other vehicles
and on their own hoods and dashboards,
it si claimed.
Astronomical clocks will turn on a
higher intensity of light in the portal sec-
tions of the tunnel during daylight hours.
This will make it safer for motorists to
drive from bright sunlight into the tunnel
at normal traffic speeds, by allowing the

We have been swamped with requests
from our readers to the effect that they
want to see more of I'il Anna. Perhaps
we misconstrued the meaning of these re-
quests; at any rate we had Anna pose for
our special camera and we think that this
picture of our heroine will appease even
the most frantic of you engineers.
RULES FOR DEVELOPING ANNA:
1) Anna's lines are denned by their
end-points, thus each pair of points de-
fines a line.
2) Each point is defined by an x-co-
ordinate and a y-coordinate. The con-
ventional system of giving the x-coordin-
ate first, and then the y, is used. To lo-
cate the point (5,7.5), for example,
merely do the following: OVER 5 spaces;
UP 7.5 spaces. There's the point!
3) All curves are given as equations
in standard forms (although Anna's
curves are well above standard). Only
circles and parabolas are used. The cir-
cles, or portions thereof may be drawn
immediately by noting the coordinates of
the center and the length of the radius.
This may be done merely after inspection
of the equation. Pay attention to the

All the parabolas have axes parallel tto
either the x or the y axis. An inspection
of the equation will allow for a more con-
venient plotting of the curve. (Hint: use
the limiting-values, and then sketch the
curve; thus, calculations are considerably
reduced ).
Remember, the best three solutions of
Anna's picture will reward the "develop-
er" with a free Technic (or cash equiva-
lent), and his prize picture will be dis-
played on our bulletin board.
If an original picture of Anna is
sent to us, complete with coordinates and

both as to interest and to good taste, the
sender will receive a free subscription to

Sigma Rho Tau
So you're going to be an engineer upon
your graduation from the University of
Michigan? You have ideas, hopes, ambi-
tions, a burning desire to get ahead. You
figure you're getting one of the finest
engineering educations obtainable any-
where. The next step is the acquisition

gling young engineers, sidestepping the
pitfalls and scaling the obstacles that be-
siege one on all sides in this grandiose
field of modern industry.
But will you be prepared for the
"break," the opportunity for advance-
ment, when it comes; or have you got the
stuff within you to make your own breaks
achieve it.
I do not claim that we have an organi-
zation on this campus that will assure you
of success in engineering, nor do I claim
that all the men in Sigma Rho Tau are
headed for executive positions. But you
can bet that last quarter with which you
purchased this issue that the boys pictured
on this page and their colleagues are de-
veloping and exploiting their potential-
ities to the hilt. They are not only de-
veloping their minds in the classroom,
but they are developing their personalities
by learning the valuable art of presenta-
tion from the speaking platform.
Under the able tutorage of Professor
Robert D. Brackett and his fine staff of
student assistants, these young engineers
and architects learn every type of speak-

High-strength wire whose use allows the

The problem, of course, is a continuing one for
telephone people. High-strength wire with re-
quired electrical qualities is only one of many
things they have developed to help solve the
problem in these days of high construction

In total, their developments are the reason
why telephone service here is the best in the

the downward component from the guy
cables. Furthermore, the fact that the
antenna overhangs the top guy anchors by
over five feet serves to lessen the bend-
ing moment from high velocity winds.
The anchorage for the guys consists of
internal expansion bolts, mounted directly
in the brick parapet of the Quad. The
weight of the tower is distributed by four
wood and brick holding pads. The bricks
serve the function of holding the
wooden part of the structure from the
moisture, and the wood, with the aid of
tire casing cushions, distributes the load
evenly.
The final design resulted from the
combination of all the aforementioned
considerations. The tower was made
square in order to match the base sup-
ports, and to achieve the desired symmetry
and ease of support. The sides are curved,
not for structural reasons, but again for
appearance. For the main stringers the
club used four twenty foot two by twos
of straight grained sitka spruce, which
were nailed and glued to notched spruce
crossbars whose number and spacing was
arranged to give a constant lacing wire
angle of about 45 degrees and a full
double wrap-around. The lacing cable is
a departure from the usual design. Each
cable is continuous from one corner of
the base to the same corner at the rotator
&lt;
WEST QUAD CALLING
(continued from page 7)
and is tensioned by a turnbuckle at each
end. There are also individual clamps at
each crossbar corner to keep the wire
from slipping. These wires are the cross-
bracing that provide the resistance to
bending and also the resistance to tor-
sional deflection. The ultimate strength
of the tower is unknown, and hopes are
high that it will remain so.
The next problem was the rotator.
Commercial rotators that are now avail-
able cost in the order of $250.00, which
was about twice as much as the Club
could afford for the whole project.
Furthermore, the opinion of the members
was that these commercial units are in-
flexible and are not proportioned to
handle large • beams or stacked arrays
(multiple beams). In the usual con-
struction the spindles are quite small and
the bearing center distances short, so that
even if a way was found to position the
beam some distance from the rotator, the
rotator would not be strong enough to
bear the load properly. Also, most of
the main worm or bull gears built into
these rotators are rather small when com-
pared to a twenty-meter bear which is
perhaps twenty feet across with thirty-
three feet elements. By designing and
building their own rotator the Club
would have a custom built job that would
not look like an afterthought stuck on the
end of the tower and further would have

a rotator with the flexibility and reserve
strength needed for possible future ex-
pansion.
The specifications were that the rotator
was to be able to use a shaft mount in-
stead of a flange mount, to be adaptable
to various beam heights above the rotator,
and have the spindle, bearings, and bull
gear extra strong. These specifications
were met with a hollow spindle that
had a two and one-half inch bore. The
very massiveness of this spindle made
antifriction bearings the more logical, and
due to the restricted dimensions of the
gear-housing that we used, ball bearings
were almost an absolute necessity. The
gearbox was the result of an intensive
search of the surplus market which finally
ended with a ten inch manganese bronze
circular gear which was bolted to a flange
arc-welded on the spindle, giving an 18-1
reduction ratio.
During the next year, every conceivable
type of drive was designed into the ro-
tator from 24 volt D.C. aircraft actuators
to hydraulic transmissions and washing
machine motors. Lightning damage to
one of the chimneys of the Quad brought
home the necessity for some sort of pro-
tection. Thus, a lightning rod was de-

He swung wide the massive portal and
strode briskly in. Instantly six uniformed
men sprang to attention. He fiercely tore
open his shirt collar and jerked off his
coat. His glaring eyes became narrow
slits as he turned and stood facing them.
Not a thing stirred in the tense silence.
Each of their anxious faces showed ex-
pectancy and suspense. He picked his
man and advanced two paces. His look
was keen, and his voice was stern—"I
want a shave and a haircut," he said.

Two intoxicated gentlemen wandered
into a public dance hall. One asked the
location of the cloak room and was told
to take the first door to the right and to
go down three steps. Due to the liquor-
logged condition of his brain, he got the
elevator door by mistake and fell five
stories to the basement. His friend watch-
ed his sudden departure and leaning
through the door called out:
"What are you doing down there?"
After a short pause the answer came
floating up the shaft:
"Hanging up my coat. Look out for
that first step—it's an awful one."
A doctor came up to a patient in an
insane asylum, slapped him on the back,
and said: "Well, old man, you're all
right. You can run along and write your
folks that you'll be back home in two
weeks as good as new."
The patient went off gayly to write his
letter. He had it finished and sealed, but
when he was licking the stamp it slipped
through his fingers to the floor, lighted
on the back of a cockroach that was pass-
ing, and stuck. The patient hadn't seen
the cockroach—what he did see was his
escaped postage stamp zigzagging aim-
lessly across the floor to the baseboard,
wavering up over the baseboard, and
following a crooked track up the wall
and across the ceiling. In depressed
silence he tore up the letter he had just
written and dropped the pieces on the
floor.
"Two weeks . . . Nuts," he said. "I
won't be out of here in three years."

The interviewer was asking questions
of the engineer applying for a position.
"Before I decide to hire you," he said,
"I would like to ask you one question."
"Go ahead," said the engineer.
"Do you ever partake of intoxicating
beverages?"
"Before I reply," said the applicant
cautiously, "Is this a question or an in-
vitation?"

Gus: "Give me a cigarette, Lex."
Lex: "I thought you had quit smok-

More and more... and better oil
Under the waters just off the Gulf Coast alone... lie vast
new oil fields that may almost double America's oil reserves.
This rich discovery is just one more phase of the better-
than-ever job the oil industry is now doing to meet our
soaring demands. And back of that job are today's supe-
rior skills, advanced engineering, and better materials.
Such hard metals as tungsten carbide, used in drills,
help make it possible to cut more than three miles into the
earth. Essential valves, pumps, and even fractionating tow-
ers made of carbon arc virtually 100% proof against highly
corrosive acids.
Such better materials as stainless steel defy heat, pres-
sure and corrosion in refinery operations. With the new
oxy-acetylene pressure welding, pipelines can be more
swiftly linked into single strong units that extend for hun-
dreds of miles.
Better chemicals, also! Solvents that purify our oil . . .
chemicals that draw offensive elements from our gasoline
and provide us with anti-knock compounds. All these are
helping bring us better medicines, waxes, cosmetics, paints
... to name only a handful of today's hundreds of superior
petroleum products.
The people of Union Carbide produce these and many
other materials that help supply us with more and belter
petroleum products. They also provide hundreds of other
materials to help science and industry maintain American
leadership . .. in meeting the needs of mankind.

times corresponding prewar figures. The
peak of the wave will hit the industrial
market for young engineers either in
June of 1949 or June of 1950.
Many young men given war service
training in radar and radio now come
to the universities for theory. Licensed
amateur radio operators ("hams"), study
with us; so do boys who have built home
voice recorders or radios; and boys who
have read about Superman, controlled
rockets to Mars, and death rays. These
things are obviously electronic in nature,
according to the advertisements. This
illustrates a relatively new problem in
educational motivation; the spread of
semiscientific hobbies, and the exposure
of boys to popular semitechnical writings,
seriously may impair the correlation be-
tween economic need and the enthusiasms
that bring boys into particular professions.
Fortunately there exist at present, in
electronics, both motivation and economic
need.
The economic need may not persist,
but the motivation will remain, and the
most important single ingredient in the
learning process still will be the enthu-
siasm of the learner. Therefore, it prob-
ably never will be right to destroy a
student's enthusiasm for electronics by
telling him, even if it becomes true, that
he is entering a profession that is over-
crowded and characterized by discourag-
ingly intense competition. Besides,
teachers who told students that about
electronics ten years ago were astronomi-
cally wrong, for reasons hidden by the
gray curtain that concealed the future.
The gray curtain will be before us always.
This motivation problem has a simple
solution. We can adhere to a firm policy
that each student be trained primarily as
an engineer, next as an electrical engineer,
including significant attention to elec-
tronics. Last, he may be permitted some
curriculum choice in his senior year. Prop-
erly handled, this can maintain enthu-
siasm, it will teach the meaning of spec-
ialization, and will permit balancing
depth and breadth. This policy not only
protects a radio ham against changes in
economic need; it also chokes down his
throat unpalatable items such as fluid
mechanics, the thermodynamics of tem-
perature-entropy diagrams, induction mo-
tor circle diagrams, and the like. Al-
though as a student he will not believe
it, he will need this nonelectronic knowl-
edge very much when earning his living
as an electronics engineer, because elec-
tronics is not what he thinks it is.
In general, as a student he will not
understand that electronics is now as
broad as all engineering practice; that it
crosses all interprofessional boundaries;
that it gives complete allegiance to no one
set of scientific tutors; and that it de-
mands of its adherents first of all a sound
grounding in broadly general engineering
principles.
Expansion of Areas of Utility
Electronics has exploded the boundaries
of utility and of measurement, and the
areas of use of our minds, relative to
electromagnetic phenomena. Our curric-
ulum content and our provisions for engi-
neering training must be adjusted ac-
cordingly.
The most violent impacts of electronics
on engineering practice are due to the
radical extensions of the electric circuit
frequency spectrum and of extremes of
usable power levels. Thus we use electric
circuits at frequencies from direct current
to 100,000 million cycles per second, and
at power levels from a millionth of a
microwatt to millions of kilowatts. These
and other electronic impacts call for cur-
riculum alterations, and sharply are in-
creasing the needs of industry for elec-
trically-trained men.
Circuits
The most obvious curriculum change
called for is that of strengthening, in
depth and breadth, in undergraduate and
graduate years, and for electrical engi-
neering students in all options, the study
of linear circuit theory, in all possible
ramifications as to frequency ranges, band
widths, pulse techniques, power levels,
transient analysis, equivalent circuits for
amplifiers, for acoustical networks, for
electromechanical servomechanisms, for
microwave cavities, and for what-have-
you. This strengthening in depth and
breadth we enjoy; we are pleased at hav-
ing a reason for it.
Electromagnetic Field Principles
We must strengthen our attention to
electromagnetic field theory, on which
both circuit and noncircuit electrical engi-
neering is based. Electrical engineers
should accept the responsibility of apply-
ing to human affairs all technical dis-
coveries in which the gross aspects of
electromagnetic field principles are pre-
dominant. I believe the advent of elec-
tronics, with its emphasis on microwave
circuits, wave propagation, and field
effects in electron tubes, will compel us
to accept this responsibility; we have not
hitherto done so.
The seven great commandments of
electromagnetic field theory are expressed
completely in the seven equations that
bear the prophet's name; of course, I
refer to Maxwell's equations. In a round-
table discussion at the AIEE winter gen-
eral meeting in Pittsburgh, Pa., last Janu-
ary, Dean Kouwenhoven of Johns Hop-
kins University supported the thesis, now
in effect in his institution, that the formal
study of Maxwell's equations be moved
from the graduate year to the senior year,
to form a required part of the standard
4-year electrical engineering curriculum
for students in all options. His sugges-
tion is not to be brushed off lightly; such
a change would make our standard pro-
gram terminate coherently with a study
of the fundamental tenets of electrical
engineering; it would add substantial
breadth and preserve depth. I believe it
is as inevitable as the rising of the sun to-
morrow morning.
Noncircuit Concepts
Quite aside from power level and fre-
quency changes, the impacts of electronics
have exploded the frontiers of noncircuit
electrical concepts available to inventive
genius. We have reaped a reward of
major human importance, if measured in
lives paid for national survival, for the
imaginations that understood Maxwell's
equations well enough to insist on ex-
perimenting with radar well before the
war. The micrawave radar magnetron was
a British invention which arose from
fruitful mental vision as to how electrons
exchange energy with ultrahigh-frequency
fields. Like all other electronic inventions,
radar is the outgrowth of noncircuit con-
cepts. Let me mention a few of these that
our electrical engineering curricula must
embrace.
To understand space-charge control of
current in vacuum tubes, and the focusing
of electron beams in cathode-ray tubes,
one must emphasize in Maxwell's equa-
tions the principles of ballistics, just as
used in considering the motion of a base-
ball in flight into the stands.

In order to understand electronic par-
ticle accelerators, many-ton tools of an
electrical engineering nature of import-
ance in nuclear transmutation of elements,
one must accept the relativistic concepts
that an electron's mass increases as its
velocity increases, and that the velocity
of light appears the same to all observers,
regardless of the motions of the observers.
The ultimate limit to sensitivity in any
delicate measurements, and in radio and
radar reception, lies in signal-to-noise
ratio. To understand the origins of noise,
whether caused by the raindrop patter of
electrons onto the plate of a vacuum tube,
or by the randomly-directed current flow
in a resistor due to thermal motions of
the conduction electrons, or by the gray-
body electromagnetic radiations from
ocean, land, or clouds, one must acquire
at least a little of the logic or random
probabilities, and a little knowledge of
the kinetic theories of particle motions.
In order to understand the very practi-
cal fact of the limits to color response of
photoelectric tubes, one must accept the
simpler principles of the quantum theory,
including the point of view that light
energy is received and delivered in
"chunks." Industrial spectroscopy, the
technology of recording the spectral lines
that identify atoms and molecules, is a
product of quantum mechanics and a
necessary metallurgical engineering skill.
Its tools are those of an electronics engi-
neer. The quantum mechanical ideas that
permit understanding of fluorescent lights,
of ignitrons, of corona, of high-line flash-
over, and of the new "transistors" are all
the same as those of spectroscopy. The
elementary quantum ideas are learned
much more easily than are a-c vector dia-
grams; I speak from 20 years of experi-
ence in teaching to undergraduates in
electrical engineering.
Heat transfer science is neither new
nor electronic, but electronics adds to its
importance for electrical engineers.
Of course, no one can learn all these
things well in the university, but any-
one can be taught in the university not
to fear trying to learn them later. While
our students are still subject to our gui-
dance, we should introduce them with rea-
sonable rigor to enough noncircuit mental
concepts to establish a pattern of familiar-
ity rather than strangeness.
Computer Technology
There is an important research activity
(continued from page 22)
in the field of electronic computers, of the
digital type, and of the analog type.
Digital computers count numbers as the
Chinese count on an abacus, while an
analog computer makes believe it is itself
the physical process to be studied. Both
types aid engineering ana ysis, and aid in
empirical evaluations that appear to defy
analysis. The important merits of the
relatively simple analog computers have
been obscured by the publicized wonder
and glo:y of the huge and expensive
ENIAC digital computer and its close
relatives, which might well have been
brought from Mars by Orson Welles.
However, one reasonably may hope that
before too long it will be possible to ob-
tain a computer that can be put off in one
corner of a room, its cost being modest
enough so that one can afford to use it
only part of the time, and that will solve
modestly complicated differential .equa-
tions with quite arbitrary boundary con-
ditions to slide rule accuracy and in a
few minutes.
The introduction of electronic com-
puters may be one of the most far-reach-
ing impacts of electrical engineering on
all orderly human endeavors, including
the natural sciences, the social sciences,
and perhaps even the stock market. Thus,
I can imagine a computer on which a
business researcher will set up the dif-
ferential equations of the business cycle,
plug into it the initial conditions of 1922,
and reproduce on the screen of an oscillo-
scope the economic boom and bust lead-
ing to the New Deal. Perhaps I may be
pardoned for suggesting that this is just
around the corner.
It is just possible that when the com-
puter business comes of age, there may
be more electrical engineers engaged in
creating and operating computers than
in the entire central station industry.
That would represent an extremely im-
portant impact on engineering education.
Intuition and Electronic Reflexes
On the circuit side, an important im-
pact of electronics has been an immense
extension of the use of intuitive, flexible
judgment, nonanalytical as to detail, in
the arranging and rearranging of blocks
in electric circuit block diagrams.
It Is impossibly laborious to predict
on paper the effects of specific changes
in a complex array of individually sim-
ple but variegated blocks. It is relatively
easy to discover by test the effects of such
changes. Therefore, a "bread-board"
model is built of any proposed complex
electronic circuit design, from which the
precise effects of changes are discerned
quickly and certainly. There exists in the
block-diagram and bread-board habit a
process beautifully suited for calibrating
objectively, rapidly, and surely, the intui-
tive notions of the engineer who designs
and tests the model. Some men's minds
respond to this type of calibration with
remarkable ease. Therefore, there has
appeared an important engineering per-
sonnel group in which the primary skill
is an almost completely intuitive under-
standing of the internal reflexes of de-
viously intricate electronic devices.
The appearance, as a typically electrical
mental tool, of this intuitive skill, in con-
trast with logical and rational insight
into detail function, is a little new, at
least in the university environment. It is
a good influence. It encourages electrical
engineering students and professors to
be more respectful than heretofore of
men who rely on quick and objective com-
prehension of facts, on approximate eval-
uations, and on judgments born of ex-
perience.
The Crystal Ball
A strikingly prominent circumstance
affecting engineering colleges today is
that the demand for electrical engineers
interested in electronics substantially ex-
ceeds the supply, at the bachelor's, mas-
ter's, and doctorate levels, even though
the supply is far greater than ever before.
The demand is for men thoroughly, yet
not narrowly, trained. There is, simul-
taneously, an urgent requirement for us
to teach instrumentation and control elec-
tronics to students in aeronautical, me-
chanical, and chemical engineering.
In view of the disturbed state of the
world, the importance of military and
political influences, and the rapid changes
in industrial technology, it is quite im-
possible for me to predict with any con-
fidence at all for how long or how short
a time the "seller's market" for electronic
engineers will endure, or at what level of
demand stabilization will occur—if it does
occur. Some recent attempts at such pre-
dictions have been given considerable
publicity. None of them command my
respect, for I consider the methods of
arriving at them unsound. They have
been surveys of opinion, I suspect uncon-

ciprocating steam engines.
. . . solving operating problems of equip-
ment that must work under extreme heat,
cold, moisture, or other adverse conditions.
. . . working with engine and machinery
manufacturers to set up instructions for
lubricating their equipment.
. . . analyzing problems for operators of

The parts are all cleaned and the fol-
lowing parts are brazed together with
gold-copper solder in the hydrogen fur-
nace; 5, 9, and 15; 4, 9, and 10; and 6, 7,
and 12. The Kovar cup is glassed inside
and out, and the lugs are joined with glass
on the glass lathe. The nickel wire is spot
welded to the 0.040 molybdenum wire.

Figure I
Parts 1, 3, and 14 are arc welded in
hydrogen atmosphere, and the upper
cathode is cleaned electrolytically. To
prevent inductive action, which would
modulate the magnetron output frequency,
the filament is wound bifilar. After being
stretched 15% on a jig, the filament is
welded to the molybdenum wire in the
hydrogen furnace.
The magnetron shown in the simplified
diagram and picture of Figs. 2 and 3 is
of the interdigital type 1, which has not
undergone the development devoted to
(continued from page 9)
the slot, slot-and-hole, and vane types 2
in past years. Variation of the shape of
the cavity structure is the main difference
between the four types mentioned. In the
interdigital type there is a multi-anode
single cavity, simplifying the mode struc-
ture, whereas the other types have multi-
anode, multi-cavity construction. In the
former, a monel diaphragm is used for
tuning, enabling us to produce mechanical
motion inside a vacuum.
Figure 2 shows the magnetron assembly
with the following list of parts:
1. Output Seal Iron and copper
2. Fingers Copper
3. Tuning Nut Steel
4. Thrust Ball Bearings Steel
5. Water Cooling Tube Copper
6. Diaphragm Monel
7. Tuner Screw and Anode
Assembly Iron and copper
8. Cavity Anode Pole
Assembly Iron
9. Tuner Pole Piece
Assembly Iron
10. Cavity Copper
11. Kovar Piece Kovar
The tube assembly is made in four steps,
all parts having been machined to a toler-
ance of ±.001". First the cavity body 10
fingers 2, cavity anode pole piece 8,
and the Kovar piece 11 and diaphragm
are brazed with gold-copper solder in one
step. The oxidized stainless steel jigs are
used to align these parts during the
brazing operation. Then the tuner screw
7 is brazed to the tube with gold-copper
solder. The coaxial output assembly and
coupling loop are then brazed to the
body using BT solder. This brazing is
done in a hydrogen brazing jar where it
is possible to heat the body of the tube
to the melting temperature of the solder
without melting or cracking the glass
on the output seal. The final assembly
step is the glassing of the cathode to
the tube body. This step is done in a
glass lathe where the cathode can be ac-
curately positioned to ±0.003".
To outgas the tube, the temperature of
the metal is raised to just below the melt-
ing point of the glass and then where
the glass is not brought to a higher
temperature, the metal parts are heated
further up to the melting point of the
solder. Heating increases the energy of
the dissolved and adsorbed gas particles
on the metal and glass surfaces, causing
them to break away and wander out of
the tube through the pump. The result
is a hard vacuum that will have the pres-
sure to support only 5 x 10 7mm. of

Figure 2
mercury. Many of the extraneous gas par-
ticles remaining in the tube after it is
tipped off the vacuum system at the base
of the cathode will be adsorbed on the
clean walls of the tube, making the use of
a special getter unnecessary. To check
the cathode alignment, an X-ray picture
is then taken. The finished product is
about nine inches high and weighs ap-
proximately two pounds.
We have endeavored to give you a
description of the constructional proce-
dure and the practical considerations of
magnetron construction. The discussion
has been of necessity somewhat limited
because of the early development stage of
the apparatus involved in the research
project. In a succeeding article we will
describe the methods of testing and oper-
ation, and some of the pioneer work with
frequency modulation of radio waves in
the range of 1,000 to 3,000 megacycles.

SH-H-H! A quieting thought
for compressors
Engineers design quiet operation into heavy duty
compressors by mounting the crankshafts on Tim-
ken® tapered roller bearings.
Timken bearings take the tough radial and thrust
loads in any combination. They hold the crankshaft
in rigid alignment, prevent deflection and end-play.
Wear is minimized, precision increased. And long,
quiet, trouble-free operation is assured.

What's new!
Two great developments have been announced
recently by The Timken Roller Bearing Company.
First, the capacity ratings of all Timken bearings
have been increased 2 5%, enabling engineers to use
smaller bearings, with savings in bearing cost,
material cost and weight.
Second, the new Timken "Double-Zero" bearing
—twice as accurate as any previously made—opens
the way to new, higher standards of precision. These
are the two latest examples of the Timken Company's
well-known leadership in bearing manufacture.

PROBLEM-You're designing a taxi-cab meter. You have
worked out the mechanism that clocks waiting time and
mileage and totals the charges. Your problem now Is to
provide a drive for the meter from some operating part of
the cab—bearing in mind that the meter must be located
where the driver can read it and work the flag. How would
you do It?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—Use an S.S.White power drive
flexible shaft. Connect one end to a take-off on the trans-
mission and the other to the meter. It's as simple as that—a
single mechanical element that is easy to install and will oper-
ate dependably regardless of vibration and tough usage.
That's the way a leading taximeter manufacturer does it
as shown below.
* * *
This is just one of hundreds
of power drive and remote
control problems to which
S.S.White flexible shafts are
the simple answer. That's why
every engineer should be
familiar with the range and
scope of these "Metal
Muscles'" for mechanical
bodies.

IMPACTS OF ELECTRONICS
ON ENGINEERING EDUCATION
(continued from page 24)
sciously weighted in accordance with wishful thinking, rather
than being critical, earnest efforts to measure the strength
of underlying causative forces. Surveys of opinion measure
the plausibleness and dissemination of the statements of
prominent men, rather than the soundness of the opinions
expressed. We badly need a carefully-organized objective sur-
vey of the economic, technological, social, biological, and
political forces affecting the responsibility of our engineering
colleges.
In the absence of such a survey, I do not see in my own
crystal ball, nor in the reportings of others, any trustworthy
indications as to what the demands for men trained in elec-
tronics will be, or what our student enrollments will be, in
1958 (or even in 1953). My crystal ball does tell me that
electronically induced forces will increase rather substantially
the proportion, relative to all engineers, of electrical engineers
needed by industry and government. Also I believe that many
more electrical students than in the 1920's and 1930's will
find resources to continue for a fifth year, and will profit
thereby. We may or may not call it a graduate year, and it
will not in all cases emphasize technology. I expect a con-
tinued increase in the financing of graduate work by means
of fellowships and part-time employment in technical work.
There will be an increase in "on-the-job" training of an
academic, graduate-level nature, in the large industrial and
governmental organizations. Instruction in such training will
come largely from the more able recognized scholars within
each organization. There will be more small industrial or-
ganizations needing well-trained electrical engineers than here-
tofore, partly because the investment and working capital re-
quirements for establishing successful small business units are
easier to meet in the electronic than in the nonelectronic areas
of the electrical industry. The needs of these small units for
men with thorough training will have to be provided by uni-
versities, because such units do not employ staffs of senior
scholars who can give advanced tutelage.
Please note that I mention changes that I believe are com-
ing, whether for the best or not I cannot be sure. There
may have to be many changes and counter-changes before
stability appears—if it ever does.
Demands of An Ever-Changing Technology
I have tried to illustrate what I mean by the statements
that electronics will create a strong urge toward our achiev-
ing breadth in electrical engineering education, and that we
must try to respond to this urge without losing our pre vnt
strength in depth. There will be many successful responses to
the electronically-induced altering forces, but no one-and-
only right response. I believe that to specialize toward or
away from electronics earlier in the curriculum than at pres-
ent would be violently wrong. On the other hand, failure to
respond to the demand for change would be absurdly wrong.
The one thing that is vividly clear to me is the simple
fact that the pleasant stability of the 1920's, as to enroll-
ment, curriculum, and placement, is gone, probably never to
return. Changes seems to be the order of the era, for our-
selves, for the men who come to us for training, and for the
industries our graduates hope to serve. The rewards will go
to those men and institutions that expect and accept change
gladly as an opportunity for new and greater service.

safe street system.
It is plainly not within the scope of
this article to give a full explanation of
all the things a traffic engineer may be
called upon to do, but certain large cate-
gories of activities suggest themselves.
These are: traffic surveys of all kinds,
the more efficient operation of already
existing facilities, localized structural
changes of minor cost but of major im-
portance, and development of large proj-
ects which may involve the outlay of
considerable funds of money.
Traffic surveys of many kinds have been
taken in the past and will be taken in
the future, since research in traffic, like
many other types of engineering, is of
vital importance. The soundest basis for
traffic decisions is adequate facts and sur-
veys and the way the facts are combined.
Perhaps the two types of traffic surveys
of the most value to the traffic engineer
are the origin-destination survey, and the
volume count. The origin-destination
study is used to determine the travel
habits of a representative percentage of

the population of a given area, and is
sometimes conducted in two parts, called
the external study and the internal study.
The external study consists of inter-
viewing a statistical sample of the drivers
using certain streets to determine the
beginning and ending points of a repre-
sentative number of trips, and the inter-
nal study consists of interviewing occu-
pants of dwelling units. The volume
count is used to determine the number
of motor vehicles passing any given point
in a particular time period. Automotive
traffic counters are usually used for this
purpose. Other types of surveys include
speed and delay counts, accident studies
to isolate accident-prone areas, law-ob-
servance and -enforcement studies, and
parking and loading studies.
When the findings are put together and
analyzed they form the basis for many
traffic policies. Under an efficient system
they should affect location and design of
streets and intersections, the operation of
existing facilities, the development of
parking facilities, and even the design
characteristics of new vehicles. Traffic
partners in creating
K &amp; E drafting instruments, equipment and materials
have been partners of leading engineers forfll years
in shaping the modern world. So extensively are these
products used by successful men, it is self-evident that
K &amp; E has played a part in the completion of nearly
every American engineering project of any magnitude.

research then, is the backbone upon
which the future development of traffic
engineering should stand.
The efficient operation of already exist-
ing facilities is a field in itself. The effi-
cient and intelligent use of one-way
thoroughfares, and the regulation of left
turns appear as particularly important in
this phase of the work. The bugaboo of
parking is receiving its share of attention
also. Another field in which much study
must still be done is that of signal-timing.
The correction of inherent traffic faults
through relatively inexpensive local treat-
ment is probably the most efficient use of
funds that traffic engineering can point to.
The efficient use of a few strategically
placed channelizing islands, or the correc-
tion of bridge and tunnel approaches, or
the elimination or control of hazardous
grade crossings represent dollars well
spent toward preventing accidents and
relieving congestion. The pedestrian too,
becomes a vital part of the traffic scheme
as foot traffic becomes heavy, and money
spent for his aid and protection is rerurn-

provided on one side of all the spindle
bearings, drive and indicator motors to
guard against stray lightning currents
through the bearing balls. Happily, a
ratio motor was finally found on the sur-
plus market, and though small, it proved
adequate in view of the ball bearings in
the unit. An old automotive timing gear,
some fiber board, some old phone motor
gears plus two gears from a Western
Union tuning fork finally completed the
two speed drive for the rotator.
Because of this drive problem, the first
frame design took a beating too. It ended
up as a combination of plywood and arc-
welded bed iron. It combined the orig-
inal purpose of a rotator mount with the
added features of built in guy and lacing
cable anchorage. In addition an inspec-
tion hatch was provided on the side and
a means of removing the mechanism from
the bottom for maintenance. The hous-
ing was built as it was originally planned,
with an eye to architectural harmony.
Though the design was complex it yield-
ed very nicely to the application of a

able size. The support for the elements
was made by taking a straight grained
two by four and splitting it on edge with
a table saw. These tapered beams were
then fitted together with some short
lengths from the tower crossbars, some
stray waterproof plywood, some marine
glue, and a handful of nails, resulting in
a weatherproof construction. For the ele-
ments Alcoa 24ST tubing was used. This
is an aircraft aluminum alloy that com-
bines aluminum's lightness and high con-
ductivity with the strength of soft steel.
These elements are mounted so that nat-
ural droop can be compensated for, while
the center joint is constructed to make the
critical length of the elements adjustable.
The driven element is matched to the
52 ohm coaxial transmission line by a
standard "T Match" section. The shield
of the coaxiail line is made hot to ground
by using the beam shaft as a quarter wave
length bazooka. At the bottom end of
this pipe shaft or bazooka are located the
sliprings that allow full 360 degree rota-
tion. This also makes it possible to effect
a direct electrical connection between
the lightning rod, which extends through
the center of the beam shaft, and a cop-
per cable that runs directly down the side
of the building to a special charcoal

The story of
A CHEMICAL ACHIEVEMENT
How Du Pont scientists
found a way to
Moistureproof Cellophane
There's no secret to Du Pont's suc-
cessful system for making chemical
discoveries. It is simply research
through teamwork.
As each new problem in research
arises, it is tackled by men and
women whose training and skill qual-
ify them to master it. Backed by
ample funds and facilities, they are
continuously extending the field of
scientific knowledge.
Take the case of moistureproof
Cellophane. Plain, transparent Cello-
phane was strong, clear and protec-
tive. As a packaging material it had
eye appeal. Its uses were limited,
however. Perishable foods wrapped
in this cellulose film were protected
from contamination and were good
to look at, but they did not retain
their freshness. They either lost or
absorbed moisture, depending on the
nature of the food and atmospheric
conditions.
That was a challenge to Du Pont
research people. They set out to find
materials that would moistureproof
Cellophane without materially af-
fecting its thinness or transparency.

ure moistureproofness, they tried
various procedures—adding ingredi-
ents to Cellophane dope before cast-
ing, impregnating sheets in baths
and coating the film.
Coating showed the most promise.
Had you been a member of the re-
search team on this job, you might
have helped mix and test several
hundred different coating formulae
over a 10 months' period. With suc-
cessful coatings in sight, a small
pilot operation was set up. Then—
to make sure the new Cellophane
was right—doughnuts, cookies and
cakes were wrapped in it and sent
to market. Finally, engineers were
called on to design machinery for
full-scale operation.
Now everything from chewing gum
to porterhouse steaks is being sold in
moistureproof Cellophane. Another
scientific achievement is helping
change the food packaging and food
buying habits of America!

as we could spare the time. We came to
the conclusion, however, that if work con-
tinued at its prevailing rate, we would
be confronted by the sleet and hail of
February and be delayed until late in the
spring. The only alternative was to exert
all effort and complete the work before
Christmas vacation thereby avoiding con-
flict with final examinations as well as
the weather. With this consideration we
scheduled the erection for Saturday De-
cember 11. This decision, though neces-
sary, led to a hectic, sleepless week and a
costly neglect of studies for most of us.
Mr. Holden came down from Lansing at
one o'clock expecting to share the joys
of the final ceremonies; but instead he
was even more delighted to find us far

cured the last guy at eleven-thirty that
night. It had been a long 15-hour
day for some of us, especially since we
had enjoyed only two hours sleep be-
tween starting work that morning and the

Wide to Narrow Street
(a) before treatment
The use of adequate street-lighting has
become more and more associated with a
truly progressive traffic program. Since
most fatal accidents occur at night, the
installation of lights which provide ade-
quate sight distances is of major concern
to traffic engineers.
However well the traffic engineer has
utilized existing streets there comes a
point when they become "saturated" with
cars, and small changes in their layout
and all the control measures possible are
unable to handle the flow of traffic. It is
TRAFFIC ENGINEERING
(continued from page 32)
then that large, major improvements are
discussed and the question of economic
feasibility arises. The modern high-speed,
limited-access expressway has many dis-
tinct advantages, and if properly designed,
is safer than most urban streets. How-
ever, cost is the limiting factor in most
instances and the traffic engineer must
then turn economist. In like manner,
the clover-leaf grade separation, and ele-
vated or depressed roadways have proven
themselves safe and efficient, but here
again, the large cost enters the picture.
In many cases, expressways are the only
solution, and their location, design and
construction is speeded to conclusion.
Throughout the entire field of traffic
engineering runs the problem of proper
and efficient signs, signals, and pavement
markings. Without adequate visual aids,
the city streets would become a hopeless
jumble of cars. A great deal of attention
is given to visual help for the motorist,
and contrary to the majority of motorists'
beliefs, much time is, or should be, given
to the proper design and installation of
even as simple a device as a stop-light
or a set of pavement markings. It
seems paradoxical, but as a rule the best
type of traffic control is that which goes
unnoticed by the average motorist. A
truly well-designed and -constructed traffic
system should be of such a nature as to
never cause the driver to have to make
more than one decision at a time.
In conclusion, it should be emphasized

that the traffic problem is far from com-
pletely solved in any locality, but the
problems have been stated, and full-time
experts are continually working to im-

Drop Forge Division Operations
WILLYS-OVERLAND MOTORS, INC.
Emphasize Speed of &amp;AS
SPEED HEATING of small billets for drop forging
demonstrates the speed of GAS for production-line
operations requiring a flexible, controllable fuel.
Drop Forge Division engineers and metallurgists,
working with the furnace manufacturers, devised a
simple Gas-fired, continuous-cycle billet furnace with
the following characteristics and capabilities:
• Billet Temperatures—2,200 °-2,300°F
• Billet Heating Time—4 minutes normal (can be regulated
as required in production schedules)
• Billet Discharge Rate—440 per hour, on 4-minute cycle
• Piece Dimensions (Average)—1"-2.5" thickness or diam-
eter for rounds, squares, or flats up to 10" in length
• Furnace Heat-up Time—2,500°F in 15 minutes after initial
lighting
Quite as important as the productive capacity of
the furnace are results of high-speed billet heating
with GAS—
• Uniform temperature of billets improves workability in
forge
• Reduced scale minimizes abrasion in dies
• Flexibility for different sizes and shapes without costly
equipment changes
• Economy of operation, of fuel costs, and of equipment
investment
This application of modern Gas Equipment in an
important production-line process is just one of the
contributions made by GAS to industrial progress.
There are many other heat-processing operations such
as annealing, normalizing, stress-relieving, case-hard-
ening, in which the productive flames of GAS have
established records for productioneering. They're
worth investigating.

driver's eyes to become gradually accus-
tomed to the lower light level inside.
The lighting level will be three to four
footcandles on the roadway, grading up
to 20 footcandles in the portals to com-
pensate for bright sunlight outside the
tunnel. This illumination is equivalent to
that of the nation's brightest-lighted
street.
Twelve separate lighting circuits, all in
continuous use, will serve each tube. The
supply of power to the lighting system is
so interspersed that loss of any part of
the power supply—including complete
loss at one end of the tunnel—will not
leave any section of the tunnel in dark-
ness.
The tunnel, which will be one of the
world's longest, is expected to be com-
pleted in 1950.
Moisture Detective
A new electronic instrument, which can
measure continuously the amount of
moisture in moving sheets of materials
such as paper and textiles, has been devel-
oped here by General Electric engineers.
The device can also be set up to moni-
tor the percentage of "volatile materials"
—easily vaporized fluids—in sheet plas-
tics. Materials to be checked are fed be-
tween two metal plates, and a dial on the
instrument's control panel registers the
moisture or volatile material content in
terms of percentage.
The "monitor" takes advantage of the
fact that moisture in sheet materials like
paper, textiles, rubber, rayons, nylons,
etc. makes them better conductors of elec-
tricity, so that their conductivity can be
used to indicate how much moisture they
contain.
In the case of testing plastics for vola-
tile materials, it has been found that the
"capacitance," the force between two
electrodes separated by a non-conductor
—like a plastic—varies with the volatile
material content. Hence, the instrument
monitors changes in the capacitance of
two plates separated by a moving sheet of
plastic to find how much volatile material
is present.
In the past, sheet materials being manu-
factured have had to be checked periodi-
cally by time-consuming methods, where
by samples have had to be torn from
the moving sheets, baked, and weighed.

One of the standout accomplishments
of Sigma Rho Tau is the conception and
development of the Conference Debate.
This conference-type of debating was
originated by Sigma Rho Tau in 1930. It
has been widely copied, but Sigma Rho
Tau is the only organized outfit that
achieves the full conference style, com-
plete with its deadly cross-examination
period, during which a man's well-laid
contentions can be torn to shreds by a
clever opponent! It is not the old high
school "cuff-shooting" type of debating,
but stresses smoothness, and the search
for truth, where principles rather than
personalities are involved. When a man
trains for the debate team, he learns to
think on his feet—to think fast, and must
present arguments not only convincingly
but also suavely and tactfully. This, we

HOW TO DIVIDE UP A DOLLAR
. . . the American Way
It may interest you to know the mistaken
notions most folks have about the profits of
American companies.
They tell interviewers that they think such
companies are entitled to make 12 to 15 cents
on every dollar of income, as a fair return.
Yet, they add, it's their guess that manu-
facturers actually do make about 25 cents!
The facts are that in normal years Ameri-
can companies average about nine cents
profit per income dollar.
Take Aluminum Company of America in
1947, for example. Out of each dollar re-
ceived last year by Alcoa and its subsidiaries,
the net profit amounted to less than eight
cents. We show above where the rest of that
dollar went. Nearly half of it in wages, sala-
ries, and employee benefits, to Alcoans. Al-
most another half for materials and services
we bought. Over six and a half cents for taxes.
The dollars-and-cents story of Aluminum
Company of America represents the kind
of facts you'll get from any typical Ameri-
can enterprise. Facts that show a fair return
for a good product.
By dividing up a dollar, the American
way, Alcoa has provided secure employment
for 46.000 aluminum workers and has helped
America to gain world leadership in alumi-
num production and research.

Sigma Rho Tau is a national organiza-

as the University of Michigan, University
of Detroit, University of Toledo, and
Detroit Institute of Technology. The

individual championships in other types of
speech contests during the National Invi-

Sigma Rho Tau, entering its twentieth
year, is beginning to flex its muscles
again as in days of old. This spring
SRT will field a special team composed of
three of its top debaters. They will issue
a standing challenge to the literary col.
lege debating teams of every University in

That's quite a chunk to bite off, but the
last time SRT talked so big was in 1931
when their unknown debate team chal-
lenged and defeated Adelphi, the U. of
M.'s oldest Liberal Arts debating organi-
zation. This provoked considerable com-
ment in newspapers and on campuses as.
far west as Nebraska, as far north as
Maine, and as far south as West Virginia.
Sigma Rho Tau wishes its three bold
young upstarts, Chuck Chadwick, Rog
Markle, and Ellsworth Renier lots of luck
in this tremendous undertaking.
There is a sample of what has gone on
in the past, and you are going to hear a

The Naval Tank of the University of Michigan has been extended this year sixty feet in length,
thereby permitting improved model tests on small high speed vessels.
This facility of the Engineering College has contributed, through extensive tank testing, basic
data of value in the design of modern commercial boats and pleasure yachts. Speeds have been
increased and power reduced for many hull forms with corresponding enlargement of the scope
of fishing boats, oil rig tenders, and other small vessel types. Attention also has been given to
the efficient design of simplified hull forms with a view to decreased construction costs.

of selecting a speaker to represent this
chapter at a meeting of all SAE student
branches in this area, to be held in De-
troit under the auspices of the National
Society of Automotive Engineers. Also
discussed at these meetings were: Mod-
ern Developments in Automotive Suspen-
sion and Future Utilization of Gas Tur-
bines as Automotive Power Plants.
Future plans include a field trip to an
automotive plant, and a showing of sev-
eral motion pictures of both aircraft and
automotive developments.
Several members of the student chap-
ter attended the National SAE convention
in Detroit between January 10 and 14.
ASME
The overwhelming success of the
A.S.M.E.'s fall program is a vivid expres-
sion of the importance of such profes-
sional organizations to student engineers.
This success, exemplified by overflow at-
tendance at nearly every meeting and full
participation in field trips, can be attrib-
uted to one simple fact: the A.S.M.E.
has captured the engineers interest by
SIDELIGHTS
(continued from page 42)
providing programs which give them what
they are looking for; facts about engineer-
ing—facts which cannot be gleaned from
classroom demagogy.
The programs have ranged from atomic
energy to noise. The increased import-
ance of diamonds in industrial progress
was brought home to the chapter by Dr.
Slawson. The group visited one of the
largest diesel plants in the country.
They got first hand facts about mass pro-
duction at Willow Run.
Of great interest has been a number
of films presented by ASME. They in-
clude a U. of M. film entitled Principles
of Lubrication, and four motion pictures
from the Aluminum Company of America.
The ALCOA films dealt with the spin-
ning, stretching, turning, and stamping
of aluminum. The working of aluminum
is of interest to engineers iri general
and to aeros in particular.
This is an indication of what the local
chapter of the A.S.M.E. is doing cur-
rently to build a larger, stronger, more
active organization. Plans for an even
more extensive program for the fall se-
mester of 1949 are already in the making.
The local organization is constantly grow-
ing and expanding its activities. It is
hoped that the membership of all me-
chanical engineers in the A.S.M.E. will
soon become as inevitable as death, taxes,
and M.E.-l.
The American Society of Mechanical
Engineers has held elections recently.
New officers elected are: John Bennett,
secretary, and Russell Parkinson, treasurer.
Headlining the program for the spring
semester is the annual A.S.M.E. Banquet.
The program will be rounded out with
field trips, student papers and movies.

Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company
plays important role in task
KR years, the devastating "one-
rop system" robbed vast acreages
of southern soil of the vital mineral ele-
ments which support plant growth. Cot-
ton or tobacco raised in the same fields
year after year had reduced the fertility
of many southern farms to the point
where the annual yield hardly paid for
the seed and labor that went into pro-
duction.
Among the things that agricultural
leaders found in their efforts to build up
southern agriculture was that Basic Slag
—a by-product of open hearth steel, as
manufactured at the Ensley (Alabama)
Works of the Tennessee Coal, Iron and
Railroad Company, a subsidiary of
United States Steel Corporation — con-
tained several important minerals, in-
cluding phosphorus and lime. These ele-
ments are needed to grow bountiful
crops and high beef and milk producing
pastures.
Today, Basic Slag is in wide use as a
convenient, economical soil builder. To-
gether with the other soil-building pro-
grams of the agricultural agencies, it has
helped the southern farmer to prosper.

I he ring test, shown above, is a scientific
method for determining the modulus of rupture
of pipe. It is not a required acceptance test but one
of the additional tests made by cast iron pipe manu-
facturers to ensure that the quality of the pipe
meets Or exceeds standard specifications.
A ring, cut from random pipe, is subjected to
progressively increased crushing load until failure
occurs. Standard 6-inch cast iron pipe, for example,
withstands a crushing weight of more than 14,000
Ibs. per foot. Such pipe meets severe service re-
quirements with an ample margin of safety.
Scientific progress in the laboratories of our
members has resulted in higher attainable stand-
ards of quality in the production processes. By
metallurgical controls and tests of materials, cast
iron pipe is produced today with precise knowl-
edge of the physical characteristics of the iron
before it is poured into the mold. Constant control
of cupola operation is maintained by metal analy-
sis. Rigid tests of the finished product, both ac-
ceptance tests and routine tests, complete the
quality control cycle. But with all the remarkable
improvements in cast iron pipe production, we do
not forget the achievements of the early pipe

Why greater strength weighs less and less
Can YOU MAKE three pounds of steel do the work of four...
and stay on the job longer? The answer is YES, with alloy
steels—steels that are combined with small amounts of other
metals, such as chromium, vanadium, and zirconium, to
develop or increase desired qualities. For example, it's the
element, chromium, that gives the stainless nature to steel.
So great is the improvement in steel, when alloy agents
are used, that a freight car of alloy steel can weigh 25% less,
haul heavier loads, yet stay in service much longer than
similar cars of ordinary steel. Alloy agents not only increase
the strength of steel, they also extend its life through reduc-
tion of destructive factors such as rust, corrosion, and wear.
The use of better materials to make steel go farther and
serve longer is especially vital to all of us .. . with steel
mills unable to catch up, and ore supplies dwindling.
Industrial gases have a big role in steel's better per-
formance, too. Compressed oxygen aids in cleansing the
molten steel .. . the oxy-acetylene torch cuts steel sections
to size —and welds them together if desired. Finished slcel
articles are given a harder, longer-wearing surface through
"flame-hardening." And carbon, in the form of electrodes,
makes modern electric furnaces possible .. . with their out-
put of high quality steels.
The people of Union Carbide produce these and related
materials for improving steel. They produce hundreds of
other materials for the use of science and industry —to the
benefit of mankind.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


'
Professor James Harlan Cissel died very suddenly on
January 29, 1949, after thirty-four years' service on the
faculty of the Department of Civil Engineering. His col-
leagues in the University of Michigan remember him as a
genial friend with broad interests in both the serious and
lighter sides of living. The staff in Civil Engineering knew
him as an engineer with a truly professional attitude
toward his work, a methodical analyst, a gifted designer,
and a serious teacher.
Professor Cissel was born in Goodland, Kansas, in 1889
and graduated from Purdue University in 1910 with the
degree of Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering.
Immediately after his graduation he went to Kansas
City where he worked as a designing and surveying engi-
neer for the Santa Fe Railroad and Kansas City Railways,
principally in connection with the very large program of
new terminals and grade separation. Soon afterwards he
also worked for the Detroit United Lines.
In 1915 he came to the University as an instructor in
Civil Engineering. During this time he also worked for
Dean Mortimer E. Cooley doing appraisal work on the
Michigan United Railways. In 1917 he was promoted
to the rank of Assistant Professor, and a year later to the
rank of Associate Professor. During the 1920's he also
served in a consulting capacity on the design of bridges
for the Wayne County Road Commission. In the latter
1920's he designed the Fuller Street Bridge in Ann Arbor.
In 1932 he was called upon by State Highway Com-
missioner Murray D. VanWagoner, later Governor of the
State, to come to Lansing to re-organize the Bridge Division
of the Michigan State Highway Department. He remained
on leave of absence from the University for three years,
during which time he supervised the design and construc-
tion of many million dollars' worth of bridge structures.
These included the famous Mortimer E. Cooley Bridge on
Highway M55 west of Cadillac, which was awarded first
prize by the American Institute of Steel Construction as
the outstanding American bridge of the year.
He was the designer of the proposed bridge across the
Straits of Mackinac, which involved pioneer work in the
height of the submerged piers and in the proportions of
the suspended span between the piers. He was a member
of the Mackinac Straits Bridge Authority, appointed by the
governor, and in this capacity was called upon to appear
before many civic bodies throughout the state to explain
the advantages and objectives of this very large project
which was so important to the Upper Peninsula.
Recently Professor Cissel had been acting as consultant
on the Stran-Steel Division of the Great Lakes Steel Cor-
poration, and in this connection supervised a program of
research on the use of thin steel sections for buildings.
In the field of recreational activities, Professor Cissel
took a keen interest in the athletic affairs of the Univer-
sity, and in 1944 was appointed to the University Board
in Control of Intercollegiate Athletics. Director H. O.
Crisler has stated that his death was "a serious loss to
Michigan athletics and to the Athletic Board." His in-
terest in athletics and sports involved also an active partici-
pation in these fields. He was a star golfer, being a runner-
up for the Ann Arbor City Golf Championship in 1928
and 1930, and was well known throughout the state for
his golfing ability.
In 1937 the public speaking fraternity, Sigma Rho Tau,
named him to receive the annual "Tung Oil" award as the
most "loquacious lubricator" in the college that year.
He was a member of the Ann Arbor Exchange Club
(1918-33), the Chamber of Commerce (1926-28), the
Ann Arbor Community Fund Board, the board of the
Red Cross, the Men's Club of the First Congregational
Church, the University Club and Theta Chi fraternity.
During 1930-31 he was chairman of the annual Red
Cross drive.
In the professional fields, his memberships included
the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Society for the
Promotion of Engineering Education, the American Con-
crete Institute, the Engineering Society of Detroit, the
Michigan Engineering Society, and the International Asso-
ciation for Bridge and Structural Engineering.
Among his publications were the text-book "Stress
Analysis and Design of Elementary Structures," and the
well-known papers, "Tacoma Bridge Failure," "Stiffness
as a Feature in Suspension Bridge Design," "Durability of
Light-Weight Steel Construction," and others.
Surviving are his wife, the former Elizabeth Rothrock
of Lafayette, Indiana; one son, James H. Cissel, jr., of
Roslyn Heights, New York; two daughters, Mrs. D. D.
Dayton of Manhasset, New York and Mrs. Fredrick Fogle-
song of Ann Arbor; and twelve grandchildren.

Kodachrome in Daylight Process


by
WILLIAM R. HARDENBERGH, '51ME
In 1939, photography celebrated its one
hundredth anniversary. In 1935, how-
ever, a new era in the photographic
world commenced with the introduction
of Kodachrome film by the Eastman
Kodak Company. For the first time, the
general public was offered a medium for
making pictures in full color. From the
date of its debut up until the turn of the
photographic century, so to speak, publfc
acceptance of the film was rather slow,
and this might largely be attributed to the
relatively high cost of the product along
with the requirement of greater precision
in its exposure.
During the past decade, however,
Kodachrome has withstood the tests of
both time and public use, and today it is
almost universally accepted as a common
and highly desirable type of photographic
film. While mass production and world-
wide distribution of the film may have
succeeded in lessening its cost somewhat,
the prime requirement of greater ac-
curacy of exposure still remains.
What Is Kodachrome
In actual appearance, Kodachrome
film has no visible characteristic which
enables detection from any of the other
various types of black and white film.
Actually, the construction of the film it-
self as well as the chemical processes
which revolve about it give the film its
name and significance in modern photog-
raphy.
Kodachrome is a normal, flexible-based
film emulsion from which natural color
transparencies are made. It is available
in various forms for miniature camera
work, movie enthusiasts, and professional
users. Kodachrome enables the amateur
user to produce pure color transparencies
with almost the same ease of han-
dling that regular film emulsions afford,
yet from these transparencies, black and
white prints also may be had. Basic ma-
terials required for this phase of color
photography are the film itself, a camera
whose lens is preferably faster than f 6.3
and reasonably well color-corrected, and
a relatively simple exposure guide such
as that which is supplied with the film. It
might be well to point out here and now
that those who are fortunate enough to


WILLIAM R. HARDENBERGH
possess an exposure meter of the photo-
electric cell type are at a definite ad-
vantage. While it is true that the expo-
sure guide which comes with the film will
yield excellent results under the average
conditions for which the guide has been
calculated, it is also fact that numerous
photographic situations which arise are
distinctly out of the "average" classifica-
tion.
Manufacture
Kodachrome is of a more highly com-
plicated nature and structure than black
and white film. It is composed of three
laminated emulsions, each coated above
the other, with a separative layer of clear
gelatin between, making five individual
layers in all. However, the entire com-
bination of all five sections is, in overall
thickness, only equivalent to that of
regular film beds, and, as a result, Koda-
chrome is not lacking in flexibility as
would normally be expected due to its
laminated structure.
Immediately above the film base is laid
the first dye coating of red-sensitive emul-
sion, that is, sensitive to red light. Next
follows a thin layer of transparent gela-
tin which in turn is followed by another
emulsion sensitive to green light. The
fourth layer is once again one of clear
gelatin and the final top coating is one of
blue-sensitive emulsion. The layers of
clear gelatin have two important func-
tions. Primarily, at the time of film
manufacture, these colorless layers serve
as partitions which prevent the sensitive
dyes from flowing out of their properly
designated areas. Secondarily, during the
actual processing or development of the
film, these same coatings insure protection
against unauthorized penetration of a
particular developing agent beyond its in-
tended depth within the master emulsion.
Since there are three individual layers
of color-sensitive materials, it is to be
expected that during exposure, those por-
tions of the visible spectrum photo-
graphed make their impressions in the
respective, corresponding layers provided.
Intermediate colors of the dye shades used
in the film are a blend or mixture of two
or more colors and consequently will
cause proportionate depth impressions on
each of the three layers. Therefore, any
one color photographed will either be re-
corded completely in one layer, or upon
any combination of the three.
Kodachrome Film Types
In order for Kodachrome film to ap-
proach the same versatility as black-and-
white film, it was essential that it be
constructed in such a manner as to render
it useful for indoor photography with arti-
ficial sources of illumination as well as for
normal outdoor work, since these are not
extreme demands by any means. Un-
fortunately, artificial sources of illumina-
tion are, in various ways, different from
the natural solar source of light. Any
color film requires a color-balance for the
type of light under which it is to carry out
its intended function. Therefore, Koda-
chrome is made in two distinct classifica-
tions, each of which possesses its own
reactionary characteristics toward the two
variable sources of illumination.
Daylight Film
This type of Kodachrome is exactly as
its name implies. It is intended for use
out-of-doors where the required illu-
mination is either supplied directly by
the sun, or by indirect reflections of its
rays. Because of the film's equal sensi-
tivity to all colors, it was necessary for a
so-called 'balance point' to be inserted at
the time of manufacture so as to insure

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


This subject—"The Mechanical Engi-
neer in the Process Industries"—suggests
certain questions that are often heard:
What would be the duties of a mechanical
engineer in such an industry? Would not
his work be incidental to the main line
activity and consequently lacking in op-
portunity? To what degree should me-
chanical engineering work in a process
industry be delegated to outside engineer-
ing firms specializing in the design and
construction of manufacturing facilities?
And what of the future?
In our company the mechanical engi-
neers are very busy people: They fill a
self-evident need, their responsibilities are
clearly defined, and their opportunities for
advance to top management seem to have
been at least as good as those of any other
of the technical groups. Our last three
vice presidents in charge of all manu-
facturing operations have been a chemical
engineer, a mechanical engineer, and pres-
ently, an electrical engineer.
Certain elements of this subject, I re-
alize, are somewhat controversial: Differ-
ent answers may have been found in
different equally successful organizations.
Let me start out, therefore, with the
understanding on your part that my com-
ments are not offered as the solution of
the several problems involved, but as a
solution that we have found to be reason-
ably successful in our own organization.
In order to simplify what can be a
complicated subject, let us roughly divide
the technical activities of a process com-
pany as follows:
1st The development of the product.
2nd The development of the process to
produce the product.
3rd The development of the equipment
to carry out the process.
4th The design and construction of
manufacturing facilities.
5th The operation of the manufacturing
facilities, including the maintenance
of the equipment.
The first two functions—the develop-
ment of the product, and the develop-
ment of the process to produce the prod-
uct—obviously present problems that
vary widely, depending upon the type of
goods to be made. In our company, these
two functions are handled largely by
chemical engineers. Because we here are
interested in mechanical engineers, I shall
not elaborate on these functions other
than to say that, in our plants ,they have
to do with the development of new prod-
ucts, improvement of existing products,
technical service in connection with the
product, and the development of the
process through the laboratory and pilot
plant stages.
The third function—The development
of the equipment to carry out the
process—we handle with a group consist-
ing largely of mechanical engineers. The
activities of this group represent by far
the greatest share of the purely mechani-
cal engineering work of the company:
Therefore I should like to discuss some-
what more fully the purposes of the
group and how it functions.
Briefly, this group is responsible for the
mechanical progress of the company. To
carry out this responsibility it is necessary
that the group have a detailed knowledge
of the equipment requirements of every
manufacturing process and that it follow
and properly apply to our business the
latest relevant developments throughout
the mechanical industry.
Fifty years ago, this assignment, no
doubt, represented a very simple organi-
zation problem. Then, the processes of
the company required relatively simple
equipment and developments in the me-
chanical engineering field succeeded one
another at a relatively slow tempo. It was
possible in those days for one man to
remain thoroughly in touch with the me-
chanical problems of the company and
at the same time to keep himself well
versed in new technical developments in
the mechanical industry.
In sharp contrast, consider this problem
today: On the one hand we find that our
chemical engineers seem to delight in
uncovering processes that stretch the re-
sources and abilities of the mechanical
engineers to the limit—processes involv-
ing higher pressures, higher temperatures,
new types of corrosive materials, and
more exacting requirements of proportion-
ing and control.
On the other hand, throughout the me-
chanical industry, at an ever-increasing
rate, new materials and equipment are
being created: new metals, new pumps,
new instruments, new heat exchangers—
any detail of which might offer an im-
portant solution to a difficult problem
within our company.
Our group of mechanical engineers,
charged with development of equipment,
must, therefore, be so organized and
trained that it is close to the mechanical
details of the complicated equipment
within the company, and at the same time
it must make sure that new outside de-
velopments in the mechanical field are be-
ing followed, properly evaluated and ap-
plied.
This, obviously, represents a problem of
ever-increasing complexity. Our answer
to it has been the development of me-
chanical specialists in the various types of
our operating equipment. By "specialists"
I mean engineers who have had concen-
trated experience with the equipment in
a specific area of our operations—includ-
ing, if possible, experience in designing,
fabricating, installing, testing, operating,
and trouble-shooting—and in addition, as
much contact as possible with the process
development work at the pilot plant stage.
These engineers become the company's
authorities in their field and they are
responsible for the company's mechanical
progress in it.
We believe that this practice of spec-
ialization, as we apply it, is a sound one
—good both for the company and for
the individual. It is good for the com-
pany because it permits a concentration
on detail not possible otherwise. It is
good for the individual because it gives
him the satisfaction, at a relatively early
stage, of becoming the authority on his
specialty and of having a clear responsi-
bility for the company in some field. Even
though in the beginning he may be
working in but a limited area of the com-
pany's operations, his activities are likely
to involve many interesting and stimu-
lating contacts, both inside and outside
the company. Here are a few random
examples:
—At one time he may be working with
the chemical engineer engaged in some
refinement of a process, wHo needs assis-
tance and guidance on the mechanical
engineering aspects of the problem;
—At another time he may be in con-
sultation with the engineering organiza-
tions of equipment suppliers, seeking a
solution of a mechanical problem, or
a better selection of equipment.

Any community contemplating a new
airport or the modernization of existing
facilities must analyze its own problems
with regard to present needs and also an-
ticipate the future expansion of those
needs according to probable growth. Any
airport built today must be liberally
planned, because its permanent facilities
will outlast the types of aircraft for which
it was designed.
The characteristics of good airfield de-
sign are:
a. Adequate runway length and separa-
tion when a parallel system is used.
b. Allowance for landing, take-off and
taxiing as independent operations
without interference.
c. Shortest possible taxi distance from
the aircraft loading apron to the
take-off point.
d. Safe approach zones with satisfac-
tory glide path ratios.
e. Land acreage sufficient for future
runway pattern expansion.
f. Lowest cost of construction.
data analyzing the peak traffic volume to
be accommodated in ratio to the total
traffic volume, as well as the timing of
such peaks during a 24-hour period for
each type of air traffic. This data, care-
fully considered, will determine the num-
ber and type of airports required to
handle the ultimate needs of the com-
munity as well as their respective loca-
tions.
There are eight specific requirements
which must be met to satisfy the de-
velopment of any sound airport. These
are:
Flexibility—Rapid changes in aircraft
design necessitate a close analysis of air-
port design trends to permit rapid expan-
sion of the landing areas. The buildings
should be simple and flexible, not monu-
mental. The final arrangement must al-
low modification or modernization in
keeping with the advances of aviation and
progress in aircraft utility.
Location—The necessity of locating
the airport as close as possible to the

Runway Lights As Seen By Pilot
The first step in planning an airport is
the preparation of a traffic survey showing
the present volume and type of air traffic
as well as the ultimate volume a com-
munity can reasonably expect to handle.
The survey should indicate the volume
of expected private flying, industrial air
activity, and commercial air passengers
and cargo which will be handled in any
given period. Also included should be
center of traffic generation is the second
most important requirement of an airport.
The usefulness of an airport depends
largely upon its location, since the time
required to travel from the home or
place of business to the airport must be
kept at a minimum for the sake of con-
venience.
Another important factor is the dis-
tance a passenger is required to walk to
the airplane from the place where he
alights from his car, or bus. This dis-
tance should be as short as possible. A
maximum of 700 feet has been recom-
mended for two reasons: convenience and
time saving.
Metropolitan areas need large airports
to accommodate their large volumes of air
traffic. Since large tracts of land are very
seldom found close to the center of a city,
the airport should be linked with indus-
trial and residential traffic arteries by ex-
pressways.
Size—It has frequently occurred in the
past that communities have built airports
in places where future expansion was eco-
nomically impossible because of sur-
rounding real estate developments. With
an increased volume of air traffic and
larger aircraft size, the airport soon be-
comes obsolete. A good rule to follow is
to acquire sufficient land or option it to
meet the requirements of the next largest
airport classification.
Elevation of the terrain above sea level
must also be considered. Air density de-
creases at higher altitude and this neces-
sitates longer runways in order to allow
proper take-off and landing runs.
Obstructions—Natural topographic fea-
tures and the artificial obstacles which
surround an area have an important bear-
ing on the usefulness of the section for
an airport. When these obstacles are close
to an airport they create both real and
mental hazards especially when they inter-
fere with the approach zones to the run-
way. If the approach zone obstacles pro-
ject through the imaginary approach slope-
line they reduce the effective length of the
runways and this will result in a need
for a larger landing area.
Zoning—Legal action must be taken to
prevent the future erection of obstructions
which would hamper the safe flight of
aircraft in and out of the airport at any
later date.
Efficient use of the land in this zoned
area should be the goal of the agency en-
trusted with the airport zoning problem.
In a residential area the land could be
used as parkways or for open-type recrea-
tional activities. Near an industrial air-
port, small commercial activities such as
stores, service and storage facilities, park-

Although material handling is but one
part of the over-all production scheme, the
prospective savings that can be obtained
from that phase of operations are current-
ly far greater than those possible from any
other source. Since the subject is so eco-
nomically important, engineers must have
more than the mere knowledge of ma-
terial handling equipment. They should
be adequately trained to help them reach
an economical, efficient solution for al-
most any production problem.
In this respect, production should be
regarded as being more inclusive than
just making a product; all the elements
required to produce a profit for the
company involved should be taken into
consideration. Receiving, warehousing,
shipping, and even distribution of goods
must be included in study.
In fact ,the following six fundamentals
must be considered in solving specific
situations:
1—Elements of work simplification
2—Plant layout as related to the flow
of material
3—Material handling equipment
4—Aspects of production control
5—Financial economy involved
6—Elements of cost accounting.
Brief study of each of these funda-
mentals emphasizes their need in the
training program.
Work Simplification
Material handling equipment in it-
self is one way of reducing the man-
hours required to do a job, and, in a
broad sense, is part of the simplifica-
tion program. However, neither the lay-
out nor the handling part of the problem
can be started until the various production
operations have been regarded as in-
dividual operations and an attempt made
to get the best possible method. For the
study of the individual job, operator and
process charts are tools that aid in the
analysis. The standard approach for
solving an operation involving material
handling is suggested by the following
questions:
1—Can it be eliminated?
2—If not, can it be combined with
other elements?
3—If not, can sequence of elements be
changed?
4—If not, then and only then can, the
method be improved?
Such an approach sets a foundation for
possible accomplishment. Elimination is
always better than improvement, and, of
course, the cheapest handling is no
handling at all.
best machine grouping can be easily ob-
tained. Proper machine grouping can be
defined as the most effective utilization of
a combination of men and machines so as
to reduce the idle time of both to the
economical minimum.

Therefore an understanding of motion
economy is important, both for the im-
provement of the individual job and for
best utilization of handling equipment,
For example, a conveyor can be helpful
in reducing the handling required on a
given job. But if the conveyor is placed
in back of the operator, so that for each
loading and unloading operation he must
turn 180°, the equipment is not the best
solution from a work simplification point
of view. Perhaps rearrangement of the
operator's machine can cut down the time
lost in revolving the 180° and back. Con-
veyor height must also be considered—it
can be too high or too low.
When individual operations have been
simplified—as in the above example—a
better approach to good layout can be
made. By means of the improved meth-
ods, the information needed for making
man-machine charts and to develop the
Layout
Flow of material in all forms—in,
through, and out of the plant—must be
related to the layout of machinery and
equipment within the plant. The hand-
ling problem is not separate and distinct,
but must be integrated with all other
operations. Tools used are operation and
flow process charts, as well as flow dia-
grams which suggest layout. The layout
that provides the most efficient solution is
one that contains the best engineering
compromise between (1) the efficient flow
of work or the minimum of travel (as
shown by a flow diagram) and (2) the
efficient utilization of man-power and
machines (as shown by man-machine
charts and machine groupings).

Question: Recently, students were re-
quested to grade the general effectiveness
of their instructors in the College of Lit-
erature, Science, and the Arts, using as a
guide a series of ten questions. What is
your opinion as to the advisability of a
survey of this subject in the College of
Engineering, and the validity of the re-
sults of such surveys in general?
Asked of engineering students and pro-
fessors around the campus.
Professor Ransom S. Hawley
"The validity of results obtained from
the rating of instructors by their students
in any one semester is very questionable.
This is particularly true at the present
time, due to the oversize sections in most
courses. However, in such a survey, many
comments and suggestions are received
which are of particular value to the in-
structor and to the department. It is my
opinion that if a survey were made once
in every four or five years, it would prove
very profitable."
Professor Alfred H. Lovell
"A recent survey on this subject in the
Department of Electrical Engineering,
sponsored by Eta Kappa Nu, was very
helpful. I think the particular value of
surveys of this subject lies in the means
which they afford to younger instructors
to discover the reactions of students to
their teaching efforts. Moreover, a source
of criticism is opened up whereby all
members of the engineering faculty are
enabled to improve their methods."
Professor Ernest Boyce
"An expression of student opinion with
regard to the effectiveness of a member of
the instructional staff could be very help-
ful to that instructor in re-evaluating and
possibly changing some of his methods
and techniques of teaching.
"This evaluation would mean much
more if it could be made by the student
after he became an alumnus of the Col-
lege, and had the perspective that comes
with a few years of engineering exper-
ience."
Horst M. Carioba, Grad E
"I don't think it would improve matters
materially, because the instructors are
supposed to know their own shortcom-
ings, without the need for anyone's telling
them."
16
T. R. Manryan, '5IE
"As I observed the survey, I found it
to have possibilities, if properly and hon-
estly regarded by the students. I person-
ally am convinced that the engine stu-
dents would exercise the privilege effec-
tively."
James L Dilworrh, '5IE
"For the first time in modern history,
the L. S. and A. school has blazed the
way for engineers with their faculty grad-
ing system. It would be only fair that we
should have a crack at separating the
real instructors from the quasi-instructors
in the engine school. There are a few
engineering instructors who are aloof, in-
different, and unconvincing. I feel we
should be permitted to point out just
who they are."
Henry Bucciero, '50E
"If it is done unbiasedly, I think it
would be a valuable guide in eliminating
those instructors who are a detriment
rather than an aid in learning. While
many instructors may be very learned in
their subjects, too often they are wholly
unqualified to teach."
David Stein, '49E
Who would argue the effectiveness of
the survey if (1) the rating sheet is
intelligently constructed (2) the rating is
performed without prejudice for or
against the educator, (3) the results of
the ratings over a reasonable period of
time culminate in some definite action:
1) rewarding the deserving educator,
2) penalizing the faulty educator.
On these considerations, I believe that
we can judge better, not the validity, but
the effectiveness of a faculty rating sys-
tem. Why be concerned with validity
when it is effectiveness that is the purpose
of the rating system?
Ralph E. Norman, '49E
"I feel that such a survey should be
made, both as an aid to the professors and
as a long range program to help im-
prove the general caliber of the instruc-
tion at Michigan. The surveys would
accomplish this by making the instructors
aware of what the students think of their
teaching methods, over a period of time.
This in turn should act as a prod on the
instructor who has become out of date in
his teaching to force him to reform. I
feel that most of our instructors have
enough interest in their teaching to try
to do their best, once their faults are
pointed out. And if they feel otherwise,
it should be up to the University to re-
move a man who gets bad reports over
a period of years and does nothing to
correct himself.
Carolyn Green, '49E
"I believe such an evaluation is advis-
able in the College of Engineering. Many
of my teachers have asked for written
criticisms at the end of a course. One of
the instructors, however, conducted an in-
formal class discussion in which students
commented on the methods of the course,
thus giving the instructor an opportunity
to explain why he had conducted the
course in such a manner. In this way, the
students realized more easily the problems
of a teacher in putting over a subject, and
the teacher could feel the opinion of the
class with greater accuracy."
Alben Carlson, '50E
I firmly believe that a teaching evalua-
tion in the Engineering College would be
a good thing, and that one is needed.
Many of our professors have been coast-
ing along on their reputations as research
men, of field designers, and as a result
the caliber of their teaching has slackened
off. The ability to teach comes naturally
to very few, and the rest must constantly
work at it, as most of the faculty do. A
well planned evaluation would show to
the professors which of them should, in
the opinion of their students, brush up on
teaching methods. I am in favor of it.
Gene Kiddon, '50E
A faculty evaluation survey can be of
great help to the school if the students
present intelligent reasons for condemn-
ing or lauding an instructor. The engi-
neering department can make the project
worthwhile if it carries out the recom-
mendations of the students. Insofar as
making the instructors aware of their
pedagogic shortcomings, the survey holds
some constructive possibilities. However,
I doubt whether such a survey will pro-
mote any substantial change because facul-
ties and students generally have an in-
ertia which requires more than a survey
to start them rolling.
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC
I


We have all been using slide rules of
various shapes, sizes, and forms for a
number of years, but how many of us
have ever given any thought to where
the slip stick came from, or who was re-
sponsible for the wonderful little animal?
While working an exceptionally long
thermo problem the other day I decided
to find out who was the person responsible
so that I could say a prayer for his soul.
It turned out that not one, but many per-
sons contributed to the development of
the slide rule, which extends over a long
period of time.
It all started about 340 years ago when
a philosopher from Merchiston, Scotland
by the handle of John Napier decided to
do something about long computations. It
was in the year 1614 that he first pub-
lished his "Canon of Logarithms". This
was the first of the three major steps that
led to the slide rule we know today.
His own introduction to his tables was
as follows: "Seeing there is nothing
(right well beloved students of Mathe-
matics) that is so troublesome to mathe-
matical practice, nor doth more molest
and hinder calculators than the multipli-
cations, divisions, square and cubical ex-
tractions of great numbers, which besides
the tedious expense of time are for the
most part subject to many slippery errors,
I began therefore to consider in my mind
by what certain and ready art I might
remove those hindrances."
Henry Briggs, a friend of John's, sug-
gested using ten as a base so that decimal
multiples of any number would have the
same mantissa. Hank had the right idea
and most of the log tables today use ten
as a base.
Only six years after Napier's develop-
ment of logarithms, Edmund Gunter, an
English professor of astronomy, took the
second big step when he designed a loga-
rithmic line of numbers called, logically
enough, a Gunter's line. It had two cycles
and looked just like the "A" scale on
your own silde rule. Calculations were
performed by stepping off distances with
dividers. Gunter's Scales, as these lines
were called when mounted on a wooden
rule, became popular with navigators and
were used for 200 years in spite of im-
proved slide rules, some built especially

David Peterson
for navigation.
In 1630, ten years after Gunter's con-
tribution, an English mathematician
named Edmund Wingate made the third
big step by putting two Gunter's Scales
together. He held them side by side in
his hand and used no runner or pointer
of any kind. However crude this might
have been, this was the first slide rule.
Ed was not the only man to conceive
the idea of using two Gunter's Scales to-
gether. William Oughtred, an English
theologian who was interested in mathe-
matics, invented a similar rule just two
years later without knowledge of Win-
gate's work. Willie was also responsible
for the first circular slide rule. His
circular job was very much like the pres-
ent models and it was used by a number
of astronomers and surveyors.
The next new type of calculating ma-
chine (I hesitate to call it a slide rule)
consisted of a row of twelve boxwood
cylinders, each covered with rows of num-
bers and rotating about its own axis. It
was designed by Gespard Schott in 1668
and is rumored to have done multiplica-
tion rather rapidly and accurately.
An indifferent surveyor and math
teacher named Seth Partridge is some-
times called the father of the modern slide
rule because he conceived the idea of
fastening two Gunter's Scales together
with brass strips and having a third
scale sliding between them.
These early slide rules were quite crude
and inaccurate. They were pretty fair
barometers, though, because they would
stick on wet days and rattle loosely when
the weather was dry. The scales were
made to any convenient length, depend-
ing how big a piece of wood was handy
and the logarithmic distances were fig-
ured separately for each rule. Markings
were scratched or stamped on and diffi-
cult to read. However, many scientists
used these rules. In 1675, Sir Isaac New-
ton solved the cubic equation by means
of three parallel Gunter's Scales. It was
then that he suggested the use of an indi-
cator, but since he didn't make one, the
idea was forgotten for 103 years.
It is of interest to note that the use of
wine and liquor in England led to im-
provement on the slide rule! In the 17th
century liquor was imported in many dif-
ferent shapes of containers. In order to
collect His Majesty's Royal Excise Taxes
on the booze, the collectors had to com-
pute the volume of the various shaped
vessels. Up to 1675, gauging, as this esti-
mating process was called, was done by
taking a few measurements and referring
to charts, or as we would say, a handbook.
Henry Coggeshall, a practical scientist,
designed a sliding rule in 1677 that was
especially adapted to figuring volumes.
It became very popular and was still in
use as late as 1874. In 1683, Thomas
Everard, an officer in the Excise, devel-
oped a rule similar to Coggeshall's. This
was a rather weird looking rule of square
cross-section with two slides on opposite
faces, making four pairs of adjacent
scales. Another tax collector, Charles
Leadbetter revised the scales and added
a third slider. All of this could have been
avoided by using a runner so that scales
that were not adjacent could be used.
Some of the tax collectors frowned
upon the use of these rules. One of them,
John Ward by name, preferred "to gauge
a vessel by the pen only; that is, without
the help of those lines of numbers upon
sliding rules, so much applauded, and
but too much practiced, which that at
best do but help to guess at the truth, and
may be justly called an idle ignorant way
of doing business as compared with that

Are you satisfied with present teaching
methods? Are you receiving adequate
help from the faculty? Do you believe
that our faculty should be rated? Do you
want an opportunity to air your opinions
on teaching effectiveness? On what
counts would you criticize faculty per-
formance?
How many suggestions can you make
to improve your own classes? Have you
had professors who have been particularly
effective in teaching you to become a
creative thinker? In what ways and with
what methods are they doing a good job?
In what ways are your instructors failing
to do their best job?
Do you feel that you are qualified to
do a constructive job of criticizing your
teachers? Can you be objective enough
in rating professors' performances with-
out allowing personalities to prejudice
your viewpoint?
We feel that you can be objective, that
you can criticize constructively present
faculty methods in such a manner that
both you and the faculty will profit there-
by. We feel also that you students are in
the best position to offer suggestions to
improve present teaching methods.
Accordingly, Tau Beta Pi, in coopera-
tion with Dean Ivan C. Crawford of the
Engineering College, has drawn up a
plan whereby the student body will be af-
forded the opportunity to criticize and
evaluate faculty performance. In this
way student opinion can be given a more
articulate voice in your college.
However, before this plan is put into
effect, we feel that the student body
should have a part in deciding upon what
important points the faculty should be
evaluated. To do this, Tau Beta Pi will
conduct a student "Gripes-Poll" of your
opinions. The poll will be held on Fri-
day, March 18. Poll stations will be
located on the second floor of the West
Engineering Building near the north and
south stairways. Another poll booth will
be located on the first floor of the new
East Engineering Building near the front
door. We urge you to take advantage of
this opportunity to express your opinions
on matters relating to faculty efficiency.
The purpose of this poll is to enable us
to find out what points, in your minds,
are most necessary to include on a fac-
ulty evaluation questionnaire. However,
you must feel free to criticize any aspect
of the present academic system that you
feel is in need of correction or of re-
appraisal.
As a stimulus to your ideas, here are a
few areas of thought to which you might
apply your experience. Consider the pro-
fessor: Does his background include ac-
tual experience in his field? Do his lec-
tures develop and expand the text
material, rather than merely rehash the
students reading assignments? Does he
bring in recent developments on the sub-
ject? Does his professional consulting
seriously restrict the time he owes to his
students? Is he willing to see the student
outside of class? Will he spend extra
time with a student in difficulty? Does
his own interest in the subject inspire in-
terest and enthusiasm in the students?
Does he speak clearly? Is his writing on
the blackboard legible? Does he plan his
lectures in advance? Does he explain
matters clearly? Can he bring an in-
volved topic down to the students' level
of understanding? Is he patient and
tactful with the student? Does he face
classroom issues squarely, or does he
evade the issue in order to avoid the
trouble of locating the answer?
Consider your class work and assign-
ments: Are the recitation periods reci-
tations or monologues? Does the in-
structor stimulate intelligent discussion?
Is he capable of guiding a discussion
without dominating it? What are the
possibilities for the increased use in engi-
neering classes of visual educational aids?
Are the instructors overlooking the profit-
able use of demonstrations, slides, and in-
dustrial films? What are the values of
unannounced quizzes? Of frequent short
quizzes? Does classroom work real y
prepare the student for bluebooks? Do
the bluebooks cover the course material?
Are a sufficient number of bluebooks
scheduled to give a representative picture
of your abilities and progress in the
course? Are the lengths of assignments
reasonable? Are they proportional to the
value of the course? Are the problems so
designed that they emphasize the basic
principles involved rather than obscure
them?
We hope that a few of the above ques-
tions will kindle at least a dozen better
criticisms of your own. Your ideas, de-
posited at the poll stations on March 18th,
will be analyzed carefully by the mem-
bers of Tau Beta Pi. Your pertinent re-
marks, based on your concrete experience,
will enable us to devise a faculty evalua-
tion questionnaire which will serve as a
yardstick in measuring the effectiveness of
each faculty member. The most important
and recurring suggestions will comprise
the questions appearing on the evaluation
sheet.
The actual rating of each faculty mem-
ber of the College of Engineering will
take place on Monday and Tuesday, May
9-10. The questionnaires will be machine-
tabulated on punched cards by the Uni-
versity Tabulation Service. Further in-
formation on the faculty rating plan will
appear in a subsequent issue of the
Michigan Technic.
We emphasize that the effectiveness of
this entire plan will depend on your en-
thusiasm and cooperation in contributing
sensible and constructive opinions about
your educational environment. March 18
is your chance to register your satisfaction
or dissatisfaction with the College of
Engineering.

the best average results within the time
limits of the normal photographic day.
(For color work these hours are consid-
ered to be between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
with a lesser period of from 10 a.m. until
3 p.m. during the winter months. This is
common as a result of the respective sea-
sonal positions of the earth with regard
to the sun). The Kodak Company estab-
lished a medium balance point with re-
spect to the noonday sun as a fixed day-
light standard. Color balance of the

Microscopic Cross Section View of
Daylight type film, therefore, is adjusted
to give the best rendition of the subject
in bright sunlight with a clear sky, that
is, in illumination which is the equivalent
of noon sunlight plus skylight, the color
temperature of which is approximately
6,100 degrees Kelvin. (Color tempera-
ture expressed in degrees Kelvin is the
temperature to which a black body must
be heated in order to emit light of a
specified color).
Type A Film
Kodachrome Type A is the second type
of color film which was designed speci-
fically for most work with tungsten lamps.
The 'A' in Type A indicates its intended
use with light from artificial sources.
Since photoflood lamps are considered
highly efficient, fairly inexpensive, and
almost universally available, their color
quality was selected as the ideal type of
artificial light to which the 'A' Film
should be balanced. Photoflood lamps are
in reality an over-volted type of tungsten
light, radiating considerably more light
than ordinary incandescent bulbs. Their
extreme brilliance, however, is compen-
(Continued from page 11)
sated for by their relatively short life as
compared to incandescent lamps. The
dominant color produced by these artificial
sources of illumination seems to be red,
considerably more than is present in sun-
light. The 'A' Type Film is therefore
balanced on this basis and the excessive
redness present in the light does not inter-
fere with the recording qualities of the
film.
Film Characteristics
As we have already seen, Kodachrome
differs mainly from regular films in its
ability to record the visible sector of the
spectrum and reproduce it in true colors,
rather than just to measure its intensity in
terms of shades of a monotone nature.
However, this characteristic in itself
forces a rather different approach to the
theory of exposure, deviating markedly
from that which applies to regular emul-
sions. Black-and-white film, when
over-exposed, yields excessive darkness
throughout the resulting print. As a
consequence, monotone shades are ex-
tremely contrasting. On the other hand,
under-exposure shows evidence of a light
overall hazy appearance, which in this
case, causes a complete lack of contrast,
reduced depth, and poor detail.
The exposure traits of Kodachrome are
the exact opposites of those just men-
tioned. The dyes used in the manufac-
ture of this film are fully representative
of the pure shade as each color title im-
plies. During film exposure, the rays of
light which are transmitted to the film
emulsion through the camera lens, cause a
reaction within the depth of the emulsion
itself. As long as light energy is per-
mitted to remain on the sensitive surface
of the film, the dyes in each of the three
color-sensitive layers continue to fade.
Ideal exposure, therefore, is such that the
time allotted for the light to act upon
the film emulsion, is sufficient only to
cause dye fade until the image result will
be identical in shade with the colors of
the original subject. Here, under-expo-
sure would render dark or over-colored
results due to insufficient fading of the
organic materials; logically, an excessive
period of exposure would have a ten-
dency to over-fade the dyes, and the re-
sulting transparency would appear weak,
washed out in color, and displeasing to
the eye.
The so-called brightness range or lati-
tude of this color film has a direct con-
sequence upon the theory of exposure.
The latitude of Kodachrome film is
represented by the numerical coefficient
'4'. Simply, this means that in order for
an entire scene to be correctly exposed,
the light intensity being emitted by the
brightest colored object in the scene may
not exceed four times the intensity of the
light being emitted from the darkest ob-
ject. It is here that we enter upon the
prime requirement for greater exposure
accuracy with this color film. The bright-
ness range of most black-and-white films
is considerably more liberal in its de-
viational allowances with regard to ex-
posure, its average latitude being four
times as great and represented by the
coefficient '16'. For purposes of illustra-
tion, let us assume that correct exposure
for a given scene, using a particular black-
and-white emulsion, is f 16. at l/10Oth

of a second shutter speed. Because of
the wide range of the film, one could
deviate largely from the ideal and still
get the picture. Perhaps the only conse-
quence might be an alteration in tonal
definition from the result obtained had
exactly f 16. been used. Photographing
the same scene in color with Kodachrome
would most likely require an exposure of
about f 8. at 1/100th of a second, due
to the slower recording ability of the
film to begin with. But the point is that

New electronics plant of Western Electric at Allentown, Pa
This new "controlled atmosphere" plant, which
produces electronic equipment for your telephone
service, posed many interesting problems for engi-
neers at Western Electric—manufacturing unit of

For example, a speck of dust or a trace of per-
spiration may seriously impair the efficiency of
vacuum tubes, thermistors, varistors and mercury
switches manufactured here. To meet these prob-
Assembling miniature electron tubes — typical of the high pre-

by a scientifically designed system containing over 13,000 fluo-
rescent tubei.
Over 40 miles of pipes deliver 13 needed services to working
locations. These are hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, city gas, city
water, deionized water, soft water (cold, hot, cooling) high pres-
sure air, low pressure air, process steam and condensate return.
lems, the new plant is completely air conditioned,
with strict control of temperature and humidity-
sealed except for doors, and slightly pressurized to
keep out dust.
Other "musts" in planning included proper illu-
mination for high precision work—a complex net-
work of piping to deliver 13 needed services—a
gas generating plant—a highly efficient chemical
waste disposal system.
But beyond the problems solved in helping to
design the plant itself, Western Electric engineers
met many a challenge in working out highly effi-
cient manufacturing layouts, machine design and
production techniques to assure a steady flow of
highest quality electronic devices of many types.
This new Western Electric Plant at Allentown
is a measure of the ingenuity and thoroughness of
Western Electric engineers—electrical, mechanical,
industrial, civil, structural, chemical, metallurgical
—who provide equipment that helps make Bell
telephone service the best on earth.

G E Research
"Whatever may be the equipment and
instruments and personnel of Soviet
science, it is certain that it carries a tre-
mendous handicap of ideology," Dr.
C. G. Suits, Vice President of the General
Electric Company and Director of Re-
search, declared.
"It has been announced by the Soviet
press recently,' Dr. Suits added, "that
certain concepts of physics, for example
the exclusion principle due to Pauli, were
renounced as degenerate capitalistic ideas
to be eliminated by Soviet scientists.
"Imagine the chaos that would be
created if American electrical engineers
were told: 'Ohm was a degenerate capi-
talist. Ohm's law is a reactionary concept
which must be eliminated from our tech-
nology. Not to do so shall be a crime
against the state.' In this country we have
recently gone a long way toward the left,
but fortunately, the repeal of the laws
of physics is not being contemplated."
Although efforts made in the last two
sessions of Congress failed to establish a
National Science Foundation with its
overall plan for the national support of
science in this country, he said, "great
progress has been made in developing
and extending our scientific strength. The
sponsorship and support of this progress
has come partly from industry, partly
from the great foundations, and partly
from governmental agencies such as the
Atomic Energy Commission and the
Office of Naval Research."
Dr. Suits praised the U. S. Navy for its
support of science. "The war-time suc-
cess of scientific weapons was so con-
vincing that the Navy's attitude has be-
come strongly sicentific," he stated. "Even
the support of basic science is now a mat-
ter of fundamental Navy policy. The
program of fundamental research sup-
port, initiated in the Office of Naval
Research under Admiral H. G. Bowen, is
being continued by Rear Admiral T. A.
Solberg at the current rate of about
$20,000,000 per year."
"This money, which is being spent
principally in universities," he continued,
"has been administered with outstanding
competence. In the continuing absence of
a National Science Foundation, ONR has
primed the pump of post-war research
with great effectiveness. The universities
were at first very apprehensive concerning
the motives behind this program, feeling
that the Navy would require some aspect
of the work to have direct application to
naval weapons. These fears were un-
founded, however, and at present ONR
funds are the most important source of
support for basic scientific research in this
country."
Dr. Suits said that some 600 research
projects are being supported by the ONR,
most of them for small fundamental in-
vestigations costing less than $20,000.
"At the recent meeting in New York of
the American Physical Society," he re-
marked, "45 per cent of the 276 papers
presented originated in government lab-
oratories or in government supported
projects, a statistic which shows the great
extent of government support in American
science today."
At the same time, he declared, "Ameri-
can industry, with its traditional enter-
prise, has been building some tremendous
new laboratories to house expanded pro-
grams of basic and applied research." In
addition to the new quarters of the Gen-
eral Electric Research Laboratory, Dr.
Suits cited other new industrial labora-
tories at Murray Hill, Bay way and Man-
ville, NJ.; Cleveland and Akron, Ohio;
Baton Rouge, La., and Wilmington, Dela-
ware. In addition, he said, many im-
pressive new research tools are being
built in this country at present.
"In the days of Daniel Boone," said the
G-E research director, "a good deal of
exploring could be done with a pack
horse, a rifle and some shot and dry pow-
der. The regions of the earth that can
be explored with simple equipment have
been mostly worked over, however, and
the modern Daniel Boone uses airplanes,
helicopters, magnetometers and seismo-
graphs to do his work.
"The same thing is true of the scien-
tific frontier today. Edison, one of the
Daniel Boones of sciences, was able to
make his remarkable inventions with the
simple facilities and equipment of the
laboratories I have been privileged to see
today. But the scientific frontier that can
be explored with such simple tools has
receded almost to infinity. To explore
today's great frontier areas in the nu-
cleus of the atom, the region of supersonic
fluid flow, the semi-conducting elements,
the constitution of complex matter, the
infrared-radio spectrum, the region of
absolute zero, and many others, requires
scientific tools and facilities that are cor-
respondingly complex."
Dr. Suits said that American science is
"acquiring tremendous momentum. The
next few years will certainly bring a flood
of new scientific facts to replenish the
stockpile from which we drew so heavily
for the defense of the nation a few years
ago. In spite of the tremendous efforts
which have gone, and are going, into
research, science still presents an endless
frontier to challenge future generations of
pioneers."
Scarecrow
One battered old farm helper is losing
out to machines produced by the genius
of manufacturers.
He is the time-honored scarecrow—
posted in corn patches and gardens to
keep birds away. Many have long be-
lieved scarecrows more effective in scaring
humans at night than birds in daytime.
And now the atomic age has a device
that probably will send him to the wood-
pile. It makes a noise like a shotgun, and
is said to terrify every feathered creature
within 400 yards.
Jet
Los Angeles—The Air Force F-86 jet
fighter, holder of the world's speed rec-
ord, travels so fast in a dive that a special
system of cameras used during the war
for tracking rockets has been found neces-
sary to check its speed.
Powered by a General Electric J-47 jet
engine, the F-86 holds the world's speed
record for level flight—a fraction under
671 miles per hour—but instruments for
measuring this level flight speed are not
accurate enough for the dive tests, accord-
ing to engineers of the North American
Aviation, Inc., builder of the swept-wing
fighter.
To measure the speed of the F-86 in
dives, the engineers plan to use a battery
of five Askania cameras. Developed dur-
ing the war in Germany, the cameras
"map" the sky and measure the absolute
height of a bomb, missile, or airplane at
any point in a dive with accuracy within
plus or minus 20 feet at altitudes as high
as 40,000 feet. Radar, the next best
known method of height measurement,
has an error of plus or minus 200 feet.
By determining absolute height and
using triangulation methods plus the in-
strumentation in the airplane itself, the
engineers expect to get exact air-speed
readings.

required, then exactly that or very close to
it must be used. Regardless of how small
a deviation is made from the ideal, wheth-
er toward over- or under-exposure, the
error becomes highly evident in the re-
sulting transparency due to the inaccur-
ate color renditions of the film dyes.
Upon viewing the slide, our reaction is
that the picture isn't natural. It is a very
wise practice, therefore, to record all
exposure data while one is becoming ac-
quainted with the film as such practice
will facilitate better understanding than
the reading of page after page in any
manual or book.
Perhaps one of the truly outstanding
and wholly desirable characteristics of
this film is that it is completely free from
graininess. The silver grains, (which are
present in all photographic emulsions),
after serving to record the image within
the film, are completely removed during
processing or developing. The final color
images of a Kodachrome transparency are
composed solely of purely dyed gelatin
layers so that grain detection is not pos-
sible. This affords almost unlimited en-
largement without sacrificing color bril-
liance or image clarity—a property some-
what uncommon to black and white emul-
sions. It is the reason why projection
of the slides to life-size can be done with
relative ease.
Processing
Processing
When the film is returned to the labora-
tory for processing, the three images
formed in the color layers are then re-
dyed with dyes complementary in color to
those used in original manufacture. After
development, the original bottom red-
sensitive layer has been dyed blue-green;
the central layer which was formerly sen-
sitive to green, is now dyed magenta, (a
brilliant dark red aniline dye), and the
blue layer turns out to be yellow. The
re-dying process converts the entire
emulsion to what is known as a color
positive. This positive is returned to the
sender in slide form and may be viewed
through a small eye-viewer with slight
magnification power, or may be pro-
jected on a regular movie screen for
audience approval.
The remarkable feat in the chemical
processing of the film lies in the fact that
throughout the entire process, the three
precisely formed and superimposed im-
ages in each of the three color layers are
neither separated nor disturbed. Process-
ing is accomplished by the use of a series
of dye-coupler developers, which accom-
plish their intended functions by depth
penetration into the film bed, being
guided by the intermediate clear gelatin
layers. As a result of this undisturbed
image alignment, the positive slide is
completely free from the common un-
desirable phenomenon called 'color fring-
ing'. Color fringing is given to mean an
overlapping of colors causing fuzzy out-
lines and hard-to-look-at projections. It
is a characteristic more common in in-
ferior imitative attempts of the Koda-
chrome process. Fringing is good evi-
dence, in other color processes, that the

PRODUCING METALLIC TITANIUM
FOR INDUSTRIAL EVALUATION
Du Pont group research
developed a pilot plant with
daily capacity of 1OO pounds
Du Pont research has just made
available to industry what may be-
come one of America's key structural
materials, titanium metal. Midway
in density between aluminum and
iron and with an especially high
melting point, silvery-white titanium
offers an extraordinary combination
of strength, lightness, corrosion re-
sistance and hardness.
Titanium is the ninth most com-
mon element. But it has been slow
in coming into its own as a metal be-
cause of the difficulty of separating
it in pure form from its ores.
Men pictured on this page were members of
titanium research team. E. L. Anderson,
A.B.Ch., Brigham Young '40; J. B. Button,
Ph.D.Phys.Ch., West Virginia '35; A. R.
Conklin, M.S.Phys.Ch., Georgia '40, are
shown inspecting 300 Ibs. of Du Pont titanium
metal sponge.
Du Pont scientists first began to
probe the possibilities of metallic ti-
tanium in the course of their long
experience with the titanium oxide
pigments. Their research was inter-
rupted by World War II. Meanwhile,
the U.S. Bureau of Mines laborato-
ries succeeded in producing the metal
for research purposes.
After the war, Du Pont scientists
developed a process for the produc-
tion of ductile titanium metal that
can be scaled up to meet commercial
demands. The research team that
mastered the complex problem con-
sisted of chemical engineers special-
izing in design and production, as
well as chemists and a metallurgist.
In September 1948, a pilot plant was
opened with a daily capacity of 100
pounds. Titanium metal is now being
produced in sponge and ingot form.
Samples are available to industrial
and college laboratories with research
projects in related fields. Studies of
methods for forming, machining and
alloying are under way.
Exhaustive studies will be neces-
sary before the many possibilities of
titanium metal can be known. Be-
cause of its high ratio of strength to
weight, early uses may be in airplane
power plants and structural parts.
Its hardness and rust-resistance rec-
ommend it for railroad transporta-
tion equipment, marine power plants
and propellers, and food packaging
equipment. Its high melting point
suggests use in pistons, and its re-
sistance to electric currents points to
electronics. Titanium wire may be
used for springs and titanium sheet
for such highly stressed parts as
microphone diaphragms.
Your Opportunity in Research
The commercial development of ti-
tanium metal is a typical example of
Du Pont research in action. How-
ever, the Pigments Department,
which worked out the process, is
but one of the ten Du Pont manu-
facturing departments. Each con-
ducts continuous research. Each is
operated much like a separate com-
pany. Within these "companies"—

Slide Rule
(Continued from page 10)
To determine whether the Askania camera would be suitable
for use in dive tests of the F-86, North American engineers
tracked an Air Force F-80 in dive tests from a height of 39,000
feet. The telescopic lenses of the camera gave a clear image of
the airplane at that height, it was said.
Radiation Slide Rule
The amount and wave lengths of energy coming from hot
objects can be computed with a new kind of slide rule de-
signed by engineers of the General Electric Company.
Engineers using the G-E radiation slide rule set one scale of
the device on the temperature of the hot object. This setting
brings other scales into line so as to indicate the total amount of
energy being radiated at that temperature, the wave lengths of
the energy, and the intensities of the radiations at the different
wave lengths. G-E General Engineering and Consulting Labora-
tory engineers who developed the device explained that calcu-
lations of these values have been tedious in the past.
The engineers expect the slide rule to be particularly use-
ful to persons working with problems in illumination, military
applications in infra-red, radiant heating, and heat transfer; in
short, in all work where it is important to know how much
energy is coming from a source and where it is going.

of the pen." Later, Jack had to qualify this blasphemous state-
ment by limiting it to the small rules when he was noticed
staggering around the docks, bowed under the weight of what
is probably the first six-foot slide rule in history.
As the years went by the slipstick was gradually improved
upon and made more accurate. Moisture-resistant woods were
used. Methods were developed to measure off the increments
more accurately. Many ways were tried to give a longer
effective length without actually lengthening the rule, until in
1755 some prodigy suddenly saw the light and noticed that
all operations could be performed with one logarithmic cycle
instead of two. This, of course, immediately doubled the effec-
tive length.
An English astronomer, William Pearson, conceived the idea
of reversing the slides for reciprocal operations and shortly
afterward, about 1750, inverted scales began to appear on slides.
In 1778, when the British soldiers were running from our
Colonial army, John Robertson, a mathematician, put a lunner
on his slide rule and everyone was saying, "Why didn't I think
of that?" His was a thirty-inch rule designed for navigational
use. The runner was a straight edge with an intricate system
of tangent screws for course and fine adjustment. However,
Navy tradition being what it is, the sailors continued to use
their Gunter's Scales and dividers.
At about the turn of' the century the slide rule was gaining
popularity in France. The French took to the rule readily

tem, so important in reading the scales.
In 1815, one M. Lenoir devised a machine
for dividing and engraving eight rules
simultaneously with great accuracy.
And, lest the reader have the idea that
scientists were entirely responsible for de-
veloping the slide rule, about this time
Peter Roget, a medical doctor, developed
the log-log scale. This scale was of great
use to musicians in calculating musical
chords and relationships.
The slide rule became widely known in
France. Its use was taught in all schools
of higher education. It was adopted by
the French army engineers, but a young
artillery officer, Lt. Amadee Mannheim
was dissatisfied with the arrangement of
the scales. In 1859, the lieutenant devised
a far superior arrangement which made
the rule more popular and which is still
used today.
Meanwhile the slide rule was faring
very poorly in the young United States.
A circular rule for business calculations
was popular for a short while in New
York and Massachusetts in 1844, but
Slide Rule
(Continued from page 26)
soon disappeared from use. After 1850,
Washington University offered a course
on the slide rule for engineering and
scientific students.
In 1881, Edwin Thatcher put forth his
famous cylindrical rule which is still on
the market. The scales were mounted as
elements of the cylinder, which lay on its
side on a frame that stood on a desk.
Ten years later, William Cox, an
American writer of scientific articles, be-
gan to boost the Mannheim rule. It be-
came known in this country and was soon
being manufactured in quantity.
As the years progresses the rule grew
better and more popular. Improved
manufacturing techniques made possible
lower costs and higher quality, enabling
the slide rule to become a standard scien-
tific instrument.
Today there are not only numerous
variations of the Mannheim rule, but also
many rules for highly specialized use.
There are special rules for photography,
chemistry, navigation, surveying, insur-
ance rates, vector analysis, air-condition-
ing, and even sewer design. A new metal

rule has come out with the log-log scales
to the base 10, making them easy to
use.
The history of the slide rule is not com-
plete, though. Probably it will never be
finished. Some day, rules might exist that
make our rules seem as crude as Gunter's
Scales. The greatest pages of this history
may well lie ahead of us, and who can
say but that the readers of this magazine
will make that history?
YOUR DAILY DRIVING
Motor vehicles in U. S. accounted for
about 650 billion passenger miles of
travel last year—which was an average of
about 5,000 miles for every individual in
the nation.
Assuming an average speed of 20
miles an hour (since half of all travel is
in urban areas), it means the average
person spent about 250 hours last year in
motor vehicles. Actually, the average
car is driven about 10,000 miles a year—
so the driver spends about 500 hours a
year in motoring or about 1 y2 hours daily.

from under the sea

/'"yjT of sight of land, miles offshore in the
^"&gt;^ Gulf of Mexico, oil is now being brought
from under the bottom of the sea.
Through its subsidiary, the Stanolind Oil and
Gas Company, Standard Oil undertook to de-
velop this new source of oil to help fill the grow-
ing need of Americans for petroleum products
of all kinds. Offshore drilling presented our
technical men with brand-new problems. These
were solved so successfully that oil hitherto
unavailable is beginning to flow to refineries,
and products made from that oil are helping
meet the public's huge demand.
This is important news to an oil-hungry na-
tion, now and for the future. It is also a tribute
to the ingenuity and skill of the Stanolind Oil
and Gas Company men who engineered the
project. There are places in Standard Oil for
other men who, in the research and operating
departments, can help find new ways to provide
more and better petroleum products.

PROBLEM — You are designing a diathermy unit. Included
In the electrical circuit are variable elements whicl. must be
adjusted during operation. The control knobs must be
located where they will be convenient to the operator. The
variable elements themselves must be located in the cabinet
where they will be easy to mount, to wire and to service.
How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER — Use an S.S.White remote control
type flexible shaft to couple each variable element to its
control knob. This simple arrangement makes It possible
to place the elements and their controls anywhere you want
them. And you will find, too, that operation with these
shafts Is as smooth and sensitive as a direct connection,
because S.S.White remote control flexible shafts are de-
signed and built especially for this type of duty.
This is just one of hundreds
of remote control and
power drive problems to
which S.S.White flexible
shafts provide a simple
answer. That's why every

Temperature Ranges Required for Pressure Vessels
at BLACK, SIVALLS &amp; BRYSON, Inc.
Demonstrate Controllability of
Safety codes govern many of the manufacturing and
testing methods for pressure vessels. One of the most
important processes, stress relieving, requires precise
control of temperatures throughout the cycle—just the
type of temperature control to be found in thousands
of industrial applications of GAS for heat treating.
Specialists in the manufacture of pressure vessels
depend on GAS for heat processing of all types. The
pioneering firm of Black, Sivalls and Bryson, Inc.,
Kansas City, uses GAS in the manufacture of tanks,
valves, pressure vessels and safety heads. President
A. J. Smith says,
"Throughout the past 25 years we have
depended on GAS to provide the exacting
temperatures for our work. In many of our
plants we have developed special GAS equip-
ment; our large stress-relieving furnace at
Oklahoma City is a typical example."
In this large furnace the GAS control system is ar-
ranged to provide temperatures up to 1200° F. for any
time-cycle required. Automatic regulators and record-
ing pyrometers assure maximum fuel efficiency while
the flexibility of GAS is an important factor in main-
taining production schedules on vital equipment.
Stress-relieving is just one of the applications of
GAS for heat processing. You'll find hundreds of
other uses for the productive flames of GAS—they're
worth investigating.

One of the largest stress-relieving ovens
in the United States, this installation at
Oklahoma City is 77' long, 12' wide, 18"
high—Gas-fired and equipped with record-
ing pyrometers.

Conclusion
For the most part, the processing of
Kodachrome film is still a controlled
laboratory proposition and should, there-
fore, be returned for processing to
one of the laboratories maintained and
operated for that purpose by the manu-
facturer of the film. For that reason,
some users or potential users tend to shy
away from color film on the basis that
they would prefer to do the dark room
work for their own interest. In the light
of the complications involved during the
processing of this film, it would seem to
be of particular advantage for the user
to submit it for laboratory handling, at
least until such time as the methods in-
volved are greatly simplified, making
amateur handling more practical.

Keeping stainless steel STAINLESS
... a typical problem in fabricating alloy piping
Heat a piece of stainless steel pipe to bend it and
right away you're up to your ears in metallurgical
complications. To begin with, stainless steel isn't just
one alloy. There are hundreds of different types of
stainless steel, each selected for its resistance to corro-
sion or its stability at high temperatures. To maintain
the metallurgical properties which dictate the choice
of a particular alloy steel, you have to know the tem-
perature range within which this steel may suffer
excessive metallurgical changes. And you have to
have specialized equipment to maintain the precise
control necessary to avoid these hazards.
Grinnell pipe fabrication equipment includes spe-
cially designed gas-fired radiant heat furnaces for this
precisely controlled heat treatment of stainless steels
and other alloy steels. Multiple burners are strategi-
cally located to distribute temperature uniformly and
to prevent harmful flame impingement. Precision in-
struments regulate temperature and time.
It's an intricate business . . . fabricating alloy
steel piping. It's a job for Grinnell prefabricating
plants because Grinnell has the equipment and mod-
ern methods, the interpretive engineering, the metal-
lurgical research facilities and the skilled personnel.

—Next, working with a construction
group which is proceeding with an in-
stallation involving his area of equipment,
he might be contributing the detailed
know-how that results from his associa-
tion with the development and operation
of that kind of equipment;
—And, finally, he may be called upon
by an operating group which is in diffi-
culty and wants the help of the mechani-
cal engineer who knows the most about
the particular equipment involved.
So much for the role of the mechanical
engineer in our company in the job of
equipment development. Let's go on to
the 4th function, the design and con-
struction of manufacturing facilities. Of
course, mechanical engineers are required
for the layout and construction drawings
of the equipment, as well as for its
proper fabrication and installation. Al-
though our specialists must outline the
specific company requirements, we find
it worthwhile to place as much of this
construction work as possible with outside
engineering and construction companies
for several reasons:
1—It relieves our engineers for work
on our own development problems.
2—It brings to our construction cer-
tain valuable general construction knowl-
edge that results from the broader ex-
perience of the engineering-construction
company in this field.
3—Because construction programs
are likely to come in surges, the use of
outside organizations avoids the instabil-
ity that would result from trying to handle
this work with our own forces.
In organizing construction operations,
we must continually decide to what de-
gree of detail our specialists should dic-
tate and supervise the design work and
to what extent we can satisfactorily leave
it in the hands of the outside engineering
organization. Although such decisions
would necessarily vary with problems in-
volved and with different companies being
employed, the fundamental principle that
best suits our particular situation is quite
clear: our specialists must devote as much
time to construction design as is necessary
to make sure that our new installations
have been given the full benefit of special-
ized company development experience.
This concentration by our specialists on
the construction details is sometimes pain-
ful to a construction organization and we
are constantly searching for ways to apply
it with a minimum of disturbance. Never-
theless, because correct detail is so im-
portant to the smooth operation of most

JAllis-Chalmers to
j. L. SINGLETON change their minds.
Here, opportunities have a way of seeking
out a man according to his ability. Some-
times these opportunities are in fields that
he had not fully understood or considered
before. There are so many kinds of work
to do here that a man is almost sure to
end up in work that will bring him the
most in personal satisfaction and ad-
vancement.
Opportunities in Selling
For example—sales. Not every engineer
is a salesman, but at Allis-Chalmers every
Rotary Kilns are the most gigantic of all
machines. Allis-Chalmers has designed
and built kilns up to 475 feet in length,
12 feel in diameter—supplies all basic
machinery Tor complete cement mills and
processing plants.
One of the three 80,000 kw Allis-Chalmers steam turbine generating units now in service
in a big mid-western power plant. A fourth unit is being built, and a fifth is on order.
salesman is an engineer. Engineering
plays a vital part in the sale of a big steam
turbine, a cement plant—or even a mul-
tiple V-belt drive.
There's a thrill in landing orders—
really big ones, such as two 115,000 HP
generators for Hoover Dam—all of the
rolls and purifiers for the world's newest
and most modern flour mill—the world's
largest axial compressor for use in a
supersonic wind tunnel, or volume sales
of small motors, pumps and drives. Orders
like these come through teamwork of en-
gineering, manufacturing skill, high-level
salesmanship and merchandising. It's
good to be a member of such a team.
If you have ability and a leaning toward
sales work, you'll have plenty of chance
to test and develop it at Allis-Chalmers
during your Graduate Training Course.
Then you take your place in a Coast-to-
Coast sales organization—perhaps even
in a foreign office.
Many Fields Are Open
Or, maybe you'll change your mind. Re-
search and development—or manufac-
turing—or design engineering may prove
your field. The point I want to make is,
all of these things are open to you at
Allis-Chalmers. This company is in in-
timate touch with every basic industry:
mining and ore processing, electric power,
pulp and wood products, flour milling,
steel, agriculture, public works.
The Graduate Training Course here
doesn't hold you down. You help plan it
yourself, and are free to change as you go
along. You work with engineers of na-
tional reputation—divide your time be-
tween shops and offices—can earn ad-
vanced degrees in engineering at the
same time.
Those are some of the things that ap-
pealed to me 23 years ago. They're still
good.

sitions of this kind represent opportunity
for large numbers of engineers.
However, because these functions in an
operating organization are so clearly
understood by an audience such as this
one, detailed discussion of them seems un-
necessary.
By way of conclusion, it seems plain
that the mechanical engineer is playing a
prominent part in the development of
process industry today and that his work
is clearly defined and interesting.
As to the future, it would seem that his
opportunities in the industry should in-
crease in proportion to the increasing
tempo of research and development, both
in the process industry itself and in the
fields of related mechanical equipment.
This increasing tempo of research is
significant.
Certainly the new processes that will
emerge from the laboratories in the years
before us will be useless unless they are"
properly implemented by sound mechani-
cal development.
That will be the challenge to the me-
chanical engineer in the process industries.
Airports
(Continued
ing lots, etc., could be established in this
restricted zone.
Meteorology—Favorable weather con-
ditions are desirable since the frequent
occurrence of bad weather may reduce the
amount of usability to such a low point
as to make the project uneconomical. A
study of weather conditions for at least
two to three years preceding the site in-
vestigation should be made to determine
the prevalence or recurrence of smoke,
dust, or fog; also the directions and ve-
locities of the wind, rainfall, and degree
of precipitation. Wind direction and
velocity will affect runway direction and
length.
Utilities—Careful consideration must
be given to the availability of the utilities.
If water is not available, and wells must
be drilled to provide an adequate supply
to fill the normal needs of the airport and
the emergency requirements involved in
fire protection, considerable expense may
be required to meet this important factor.
The same problem must be considered for
the power supply, gas, and sewage facili-
ties of the proposed airport.
from page 14)
Balance—When the proposed plan ha&lt;
been reasonably well worked out, a proper
"balance" must be achieved between the
runway pattern and the ground facilities
comprising the administration building,
passenger station, ramps, and hangars.
Balance correlates all of the parts of an
airport to provide a smooth flow of traffic,
holds taxi distance to a minimum, require-
least passenger-walking distances, least
handling of cargo, and efficient adminis-
tration of all airport functions.
Any discussion of the "airport prob-
lem" would not be complete without
some mention of the fly-in-the-ointment
in a problem of this type, namely, financ-
ing the project.
Financing is usually accomplished by
the issuance of bonds. However, most
communities, when told of the amount
necessary for the construction of the air-
port, usually shelve the whole idea be-
cause of the high cost involved. But,
when the facts are known, the residents of
the community often will back the issue.

How TIMKEN bearings pave the way
for long life in a concrete mixer
Keeping concrete mixers from growing old too soon is
the aim of construction equipment builders. That's why
they use Timken'" tapered roller bearings on drum shafts,
driving pinions, and in the road wheels. Because Timken
bearings practically eliminate friction and keep parts in
rigid alignment, wear is reduced to a minimum.

TIMKEN bearings
keep gears meshing smoothly
This drawing illustrates how Timken bearings are
used to insure smooth operation in a concrete mixer.
Because of the tapered design, Timken bearings take
thrust as well as radial loads. End-movement of shafts
is eliminated and parts are held in rigid alignment.
Timken bearings carry the heaviest loads with mini-
mum shaft deflection. Gears wear longer—work better.

Angeles passed a $12,500,000 airport
bond issue with a five to one vote. Civic
and business organizations which were
seeking a new airport put on a six-week
advertising campaign and presented both
sides of the situation to the public. They
stated that if Los Angeles was to have no
future because of the lack of adequate
airport facilities, then the community and
the people themselves would have none
either. Thus, by presenting all sides of
the problem in a clear and understandable
manner and with the aid of an "all out"
advertising campaign, the bond issue was
passed by an overwhelming margin.
The Federal Airport Act of May, 1946,
provides for federal assistance to com-
munities for the construction of 3,000
new airports and the modernization and
enlargement of approximately 1,600 of
the existing fields.
Public financial burden can be lighten-
ed considerably by placing more emphasis
on private income sources at the airport.
The usual sources, hangar and office space,
repair services, fuel supplies, cigar and
taxi stands, and ticket counters and bag-
jrom page 38)
gage rooms must not be forgotten, of
course. There are other sources which w&lt;ll
provide a substantial added income.
Some of these are presented below:
a. A movie theater of the news-reel
type would be very useful since time
can pass quite slowly even while
waiting at an airport.
b. A men's haberdashery shop and a
women's apparel shop would be of
assistance to many of the travelers.
c. Rest rooms which incorporate show-
er and massage facilities would be a
boon to the tired air traveler.
d. Restaurant facilities at most airports
are quite poor. A large and prop-
erly managed cafeteria offers a good
opportunity for profit making.
A bowling alley and other game
facilities sould be provided which
would offer relaxation,
haphazard and disordered airport
growth is replaced by order, resulting
from planning, instead of being a costly
liability the airport will become an asset
and will gradually be transformed to the
showplace of the community.

ment is essential. But this knowledge has
to be more than the superficial one of
knowing the physical aspects of con-
veyors, hoists, trucks, and their termin-
ology. An appreciation of what can be
done with good material handling must
be developed.
Every plant has a handling problem.
Unfortunately much of it—from force
of habit—goes unnoticed. The presence
of a few trucks, some conveyors, and
perhaps hoists installed in the most ob-
vious places tends to bring on compla-
cency. Real savings in time and space, the
increased production, and the reduction in
overall operating costs that might be
achieved are easily overlooked.
Production Control
Since material handling is such an
integral part of the production plant, an
understanding of the fundamentals of
good production control is needed.
Amount of work in process, the stock
required for inventories, and the turn-
over of goods are functions of produc-
tion control which have a direct bearing

material handling simplify the production
control problems. Where they accomplish
this, a definite saving is effected.
Various methods and types of handling
equipment have a bearing on costs. In
a large measure the final choice will de-
termine the net productivity per man
or per hour for a given plant. Bottlenecks
will either occur or be relieved almost in
direct relation to the methods of material
handling employed.
Financial-Economy
Progress is made by replacing obsolete
methods or machines. Obsolescence is
not measured necessarily in years of life.
Decisions of management are apt to be
based on the potential savings and profit
that might accrue from any suggested
change or improvement. The engineer's
job is to show in dollars and cents why
his plan or method is good. With vari-
ous alternate solutions possible, the econ-
omy in each case must be considered; in
no instance is just one solution possible.
The engineer constantly asks the ques-
Training
(continued from page 40)
tion, "Will it pay?" For this season,
the study of any material handling prob-
lem calls for an understanding of financial
mathematics and a clear conception of
what is meant by depreciation, present
worth, and book value.
Cost Accounting
Industry is constantly expanding every
effort to reduce costs. The mere handling
of goods, which in itself does not add
value except when it puts them in a place
where they then have value, increases
costs. Since handling in one form or
another is unavoidable, the goal is to-
ward more efficient handling. A knowl-
edge of costs and how they are obtained
is an important asset in knowing where
to begin the study.
A knowledge of a plant's costs systems
is necessary in order to predict what effect
any new method will have on the over-all
cost picture. Such questions as:
"Will it require any increase or change
in overhead rates?"; "Will it require any
organization changes in departments or
cost centers to properly collect costs to
control them?"; or "Will it require addi-
tional accounting records or will the new
method come within the frame-work of
the present system?" These and more
may have to be answered.
Summary
An outline of the elements required in
training engineers to help solve handling
problems may seem to indicate that every
problem is a major operation and be-
comes a time consuming, costly procedure.
This is not true. The elements are funda-
mental points to be considered and eval-
uated on any job. The magnitude of the
job under consideration dictates the scope
but not the procedures to be followed.
Elaborate handling problems involving
design of special equipment is beyond the
area of general training.
Over-lapping of special purpose and
standard handling equipment will always
be present. To hold down installation
costs, ways and means of adopting stand-
ard units should be stressed. Flexibility
for the average concern is best in the
long run.

A Portion of one of the Electrical Measurements Laboratories
Electrical measurements represent in a very real sense the meeting ground of theory and
practice. The basic electrical units have been specified in terms of definitions, but it is only
as these expressions of theory are realized in practice that the units are of use in actual
engineering work. All branches of electrical work are thus dependent on measurement tech-
niques. Engineers are constantly required to determine electrical quantities, sometimes ap-
proximately, sometimes with high precision, but in either case it is essential that they have
thorough training in the methods by which such determinations are made.
The Electrical Engineering Department has two laboratories devoted entirely to instruction
in the principles of measurement and in the application of the methods to the calibration of
meters and other equipment needed in the various branches of electrical work. The labora-
tories are equipped with bridges, potentiometers and standard cells for direct-current mea-
surements, and a variety of bridges for measurements with alternating currents of frequen-
cies from the low values used in power systems, through the audio range, and into the radio
region.

JAMES M. CHANDLER
Editor-in-Chief
Many students who enter college as
engineering students soon find themselves
struggling to keep up with their work,
failing courses, and eventually dropping
out of college or transferring to another
school of the university. A somewhat
smaller number transfer each year from
other schools to the engineering school.
In the greater percentage of cases in-
volving transfer from one school to the
other, the individuals involved were un-
certain as to exactly what they wanted to
study while at college, and were not given
adequate counselling and advice when in
high school to enable them to make the
proper choice. Hence we have the cur-
rent attitude on campus that the engineers
are somewhat akin to being geniuses,
while "anyone" can obtain a liberal arts
degree.
For the benefit of the non-engineering
students, let it here be known that the Lit
School is not necessarily considered as the
easy way out after failure in another
school. The average student, who is look-
ing for more from his college training
than a diploma, will find that a Lit School
degree can be the end result of a very
comprehensive study of many different
and varied subjects; he will also find that
some of these courses are extremely diffi-
cult to master. The mistake that is made
—the item that is omitted when compari-
son is usually made between the Lit
School and the Engineering School—is
the matter of aptitude. It is our conten-
tion that a student possessing the proper
aptitude and necessary interest will have
little difficulty in obtaining a degree from
either school.
Why, then do we have so many low
grades and failures in the Engineering
School? Why is it such a joke among
engineers that if they're asked to with-
draw from the Engineering College they
can always do so, and almost effortlessly,
to hear them talk, transfer to Lit School
and do very well? And why are they so
worried about flunking out of Engineer-
ing School? Too many students begin
the study of engineering who have neither
the necessary aptitude nor the interest in
engineering in order for them to finish
the work required for a degree. Too many
students are taking up valuable space,
wasting the time of professors, wasting
money, and, most important of all, wast-
ing a year or more of their lives, in dis-
covering that they do not belong in engi-
neering.
There will be many objections to what
has just been said. Certainly, people have
trouble finding their fields in any school,
not just engineering. -However, by con-
sidering the problem in the engineering
field we might be able to find the overall
solution. In the matter of aptitude, for
example, considerable progress has been
made in the past few years with aptitude
tests which are designed to predict success
in any chosen field based upon an indi-
vidual's mental ability to do the work.
If the individual professes a desire to
study a certain subject rather intensively,
and is found, by careful testing, to be in-
capable of doing the required work, he is
very carefully and strongly advised to
choose another line of endeavor. The
unfortunate part of this university's test-
ing program is that // comes too late; the
student is already enrolled in college and
is part way through his first term before
the results of the tests are known. Thus
the student, if shown incapable of con-
tinuing in his particular field, loses at
least one term of school before he can
make a change.
Before considering a solution to one
half of the proposed problem, let us look
at the other half: interest. How many
students who arrive at this university en-
rolled as engineers have any real concept
of what it is all about? Or how many
freshmen, in general, know what to ex-
pect? They think they know: they might
have enjoyed high school physics, or liked
to tinker with radios or automobiles. So
immediately they assume that they are
born engineers. The fallacies in such
thinking are pointed out in Freshman As-
sembly, and then become concrete in the
first semester grades. But again, just as
with the aptitude results, the information
arrives too late. The student is already en-
rolled, already struggling, already won-
dering if he has made the right choice.
How, then, can the university alter its
admissions program so that prospective
students can be channeled into a course
of study which they can approach posi-
tively, with the conviction that they are
going to finish because they possess both
the ability and necessary interest? The ap-
proach, as we have shown, must be
preventive—start the student in the right
field, keep him from entering the wrong
field. Since the student should know his
professional goal before arriving at col-
lege, the logical place to test his aptitudes
and give him the necessary vocational
guidance is in high school. General apti-
tude tests, along with psychological in-
terest tests, could be given to all high
school students. An interview with the
student would quickly determine his per-
sonal preferences, and the test results
would indicate whether or not it would be
advisable for him to follow his original
choice. For that student who had nothing
definite in mind, no definite goal, the
test results would at least indicate his
possible ability and basic interests, and
thus might help him make a decision by
indicating fields he had not considered.
Thus, the student would be given all the
tests while still in high school, and be
guided before he arrives at college. Any
such program could be guided by those
interested universities, with the ultimate
hope in mind that more students will
come to college knowing what they want
and what they can do. Thus, the student
can direct all of his energy towards one
goal from the beginning of his college
career, and thereby minimize the pre-
vailing situation of changing horses in
the middle of the stream.

Plastics where plastics belong
for high dielectric and structural strength,
light weight and ease of machining

In the RCA television camera, for example, Synthane was
selected for coil forms, tubes, flanges and other components
because of its electrical insulating properties, especially at high
frequencies and high voltages. Its ease of machining, light
weight and structural strength were other factors that led
RCA's design engineers to select Synthane as the best possible
material for this job.
Synthane, laminated phenolic plastic, is at its best in appli-
cations requiring unusual combinations of characteristics. Its
excellent electrical insulating ability, combined with ease of
machining, light weight, rigidity and many other properties,
such as moisture and corrosion resistance, make Synthane a
valuable material for many industries.

How a group off American pioneers
has held the price of Aluminum down
Charles Martin Hall, founder of America's alumi-
num industry, had a special kind of gleam in his
eye. Every one of us has it too.
He was bound and determined to find a way
to make aluminum cheaply. The schoolbooks all
tell how he did it, where the world's greatest
scientists failed.
Bluntly speaking, Charles Martin Hall set out
to cut the world price of aluminum.
He was the first of the men and women of
Aluminum Company of America. He licked a
process. We who followed him—engineers, chem-
ists, metallurgists, physicists, production experts
—have been at it ever since.
But the gleam is the same. It's bumping elbows
in the research lab with men who, in fifty years,
have accomplished most of the finding-out that
took fifty centuries, with the age-old metals.
It's working in the mill and having it seem that
every shining sheet racing over the rolls is your own.
It's typing a letter in answer to a simple query,
and having the deep-down feeling that you may
be in at the birth of a new business, taking root
in aluminum.
We propose to keep on being pioneers in
broadening the usefulness of aluminum. Alcoa
Aluminum sold in 1939 for 20 cents a pound.
It sells today for 16 cents.
We are pioneering with microscopes and calipers
and rolling mills. We'll stack them against axes
and squirrel rifles and spinning wheels, for a place
of importance in the history of our America.

THE OPEN HOUSE
The West Engineering Building was
referred to as the "new" engineering
building and the aura of its infancy had
not worn off when the first Engineering
Open House was held in 1913. The An-
nual Exhibit, as it was called, displayed
the comparatively few facilities of the
college. Among the more prominent ex-
hibits was the naval tank, which still at-
tracts the largest crowds on Open House
days. Though the magnitude of the ex-
hibit, compared with today's achieve-
ments, was small, its success was evident,
for the next year a similar project was
held.
These first two consecutive exhibits es-
tablished the tradition of the Engineering
Open House. It soon became evident
however, that because of the imensity of
the project the affair could not be staged
each year. Since that time, the Open
House has had a sporadic growth. Dur-
ing the First World War, and during the
recent conflict, they were discontinued.
The intervening years witnessed eight
such pageants, and today we are present-
ing the eleventh.
The most recent Open House, held in
1947, was the first one following the
War. The post-war influx of men and
women caused an expansion of Engineer-
ing College facilities, and new processes
and techniques developed as a result of
war activity were incorporated as part of
the curriculum. Michigan's contribution
to engineering science and research were
an important part of the Open House
program that year.
In recent years the Open Houses have
assumed a new purpose in addition to
their original one; the display of techni-
cal laboratories. This year our aims are
threefold; first, to provide an opportunity
for students to acquaint themselves with
departments other than their own; second,
to display our equipment and buildings;
and third, to show how research has bene-
fited not only the faculty and students
but how it has provided a medium
through which the government and in-
dustries can advance technically at a mini-
8

mum of expense with a maximum of suc-
cess.
The Open House in accomplishing
these goals will show a cross section of
the Engineering College. It will show the
functions of the college, the opportuni-
ties it affords to the student, and the place
it has in today's scientific advancement.
The recent construction of the East Engi-
neering Building addition, the enlarge-
ment of the naval tank, and the comple-
tion of the synchrotron, are external evi-
dence of the college's expansion. The
laboratories will be open and demonstra-
tions will be a part of the exposition.
Each department will contribute to the
success of the program by organizing ex-
hibits and displays which will be under
the supervision of the Open House Com-
mittee.
THE COLLEGE
In the Spring of I860 two men left
the Michigan campus with Engineering
degrees—the first two men to complete
the newly founded Civil Engineering
course in the College of Literature,
Science, and the Arts. The University
thereby became the sixth institution in
the nation to grant degrees in the field
of engineering. From this comparatively
insignificant beginning, the College of
Engineering has risen to assume a role of
major importance in education and re-
search in today's dynamic society.
Through its ninety years of history, it has
progressed as an integral part of our so-
ciety, keeping pace with an increasing
technological demand.
The history of the Engineering College
is closely allied with the work of five
men: Deans Greene, Cooley, Sadler, An-
derson, and Crawford, the successive
heads of the school. Under their guid-
ance the college has experienced a steady
expansion into one of the country's lead-
ing technical institutions. Provision had
been made in the original article setting
up the University for a chair in Physics
and Civil Engineering, but there was not
very much emphasis on engineering sub-
jects for the first thirty-five years. In
1851 the Civil Engineering course was
made a reality; the next eighteen years
brought the introduction of curricula in
the fields of Military, Mining, and Me-
chanical Engineering, but by 1872 the
Civil course was the only surviving
branch.
With the appointment of C. E. Greene,
Harvard '62, as professor in 1872, the
College of Engineering began its embry-
onic development. Working together
with J. B. Davis, '68 E, C. S. Dennison,
Vermont '70, and DeVolson Wood,
Rensselaer, '51, Greene laid the founda-
tions for the school. The far sighted an-
ticipations of a separate college for engi-
neers, however, did not materialize until
1895. In 1881 a course in Mechanical
Engineering was re-established with Mor-
timer E. Cooley, Annapolis '78, as the
first professor, and in the same year, the
first exclusively engineering building was
constructed. It was not an elaborate
shop, as it was built with an expenditure
of only $250,000 given to Cooley for
the purpose. The structure was designed
by Davis, the laboratory equipment con-
sisting mostly of whatever could be found
around the campus; a broken down lathe
salvaged from the basement of University
Hall and a used 2 horsepower steam en-
gine were representative of the type of
machinery employed.
An account of the way the first shop
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Professor Cooley now had his shops, and
was ready to start the first forge class.
Not being a very proficient demonstrator
on the anvil, he wondered what to do for
the class. He then hit upon the scheme
of sending the class to the scrap box with
instructions that each man should pick up
a piece of wrought iron, one of cast iron,
and one of steel. Failure was perfect, so
Professor Cooley had something to lec-
ture on for the rest of the period.
The advent of the West Engineering
Annex in 1885, brought together all of
the shops. (The clock in the tower of
the Annex came from the old library.)
When the Electrical Department was or-
ganized in 1889, however, the Physics
building basement was used for labora-
tories. A dental lab, which stood on the
site of the present Clements Library, was
acquired in 1891 but did not prove very
adaptable to engineering needs.
Then in 1895 came the "Declaration of
Independence"; the Engineering College
with its 331 students began to function
as an independent unit. The requirements
for a degree were the completion of 120
credit hours and a thesis, in any of the
three courses offered. Since the range of
engineering subjects available was very
limited, the curriculum contained a large
proportion of non-technical requirements.
Within four years, courses in Chemical
Engineering and Naval Architecture were
added. Professor H. C. Sadler, Glasgow
'93, headed the Naval Architecture De-
partment.
The fundamental work started by Dean
Greene was carried on by Mortimer E.
Cooley, after Greene's death in 1903.
During Dean Cooley's term there was
marked expansion in both facilities and
enrollment. The cramped conditions were
first alleviated by erection of the West
Engineering building in 1904. The orig-
inal building was not as it appears today;
it was only half as long, with the naval
tank protruding beyond the northern end.
Professor Dennison's suggestion for the
arch over the diagonal was carried out,
and today the arch bears his name. The
naval tank was built under the supervi-
sion of H. C. Sadler. Since it was one of
the two tanks in the country, it played an
important part in research and develop-
ment during the First World War. Dur-
ing 1922 East Hall, formerly the Tappan
School which was condemned by the De-
partment of Education, was remodeled
and opened to Engineering classes. The
next year East Engineering was com-
pleted and occupied.
Of course activity on the eastern realm
of campus was not limited to physical
construction. In 1912 the Mentor System
was inaugurated to aid beginning stu-
dents. Four years later the Engineering
Council adopted the Honor System which,
except for the period during the last war,
has been in effect ever since. Aeronautical
Engineering was instituted in 1917, and
in 1922 a course in Geodesy was initiated.
The Engineering Research Department
also began to function in this year. The
year 1928 saw the addition of five more
courses: Physics, Math, and Industrial
Engineering combined with either Chemi-
cal, Mechanical, or Electrical Engineering.
Several engineering societies were ac-
tivated during Dean Cooley's administra-
tion. Vulcans, senior honor society, was
established in 1904, and in 1906, the
junior class honorary, Triangles, was be-
gun. Tau Beta Pi was organized in the
Michigan College in the same year.
What was an all time high for enrollment
was reached in 1920—2,029 students.
In 1927 the requirements for gradua-
tion were raised to 130 hours of class
work, and a thesis. English occupied four
of these hours and foreign language made
up another sixteen.
Because of illness, Dean Sadler retired
in 1937, and Henry Clay Anderson took
the reins of the College. National de-
fense activity placed an increasing re-
sponsibility on the research work at the
College, for that department had now
gained a position of renown in its own
right. With Dean Anderson's death the
job of leading a war-time College of
Engineering was given to our present
Dean, Ivan C. Crawford.
Dean Crawford faced the two-fold task
of putting the College on a war basis and
then reconverting after the end of hostili-
ties. The facilities and staff of the Uni-
versity were able to contribute immeasur-
ably to the war effort during the second
world conflict. The National Defense
Courses integrated the College with the
defense machinery of the country. The
training of both civilian and military per-
sonnel in war related subjects was in full
swing in 1943; the engineers were in uni-
form and assigned to "barracks" in the
East Quad, military discipline pervading.
After the end of the war the College
experienced an unprecedented influx of
new students. Once again facilities were
overcrowded and it is only now that the
school is maneuvering into a position

First Engineering Building
When Mortimer E. Cooley retired in
1928, his successor was H. C. Sadler, who
served in the capacity of dean for nine
years. Engineering Mechanics and Engi-
neering Law were introduced during his
second year as head of the College. In
1930, students could elect the Transporta-
tion course which had just been inau-
gurated. The honoray research society,
Sigma Xi, was chartered in the same year
and the engineering forensics group,
Sigma Rho Tau, the Stump Speakers Club
became active.
where it can effectively accommodate the
increased enrollment. The addition to the
East Engineering building provided such
needed laboratory and class room space.
Another major construction project re-
cently completed was the redesign and en-
largement of the naval tank in West Engi-
neering. The Cooley Foundation, origin-
ated to finance engineering projects
through endowments, has played an im-
portant part in the development of many
of the facilities in the various depart-
ments, (continued on page 46)

GUIDE SERVICE
Compiled and Edited
by
DAVID PETERSON. '49 Aero.
Because of the large area to be covered
in visiting all of the Open House dis-
plays, it was deemed advisable to have
guides in order that visitors may find the
particular displays in which they are
interested. As in previous years, the
guide service' will be conducted by the
Society of Women Engineers, which in-
cludes all of the women engineering stu-
dents on the campus.
I
exhibits will be the responsibility of the
students in charge. High school students
on campus for University Day will be led
through the exhibits, but guide service
will also be available to others who may
desire it.
The tours will begin at the booth in
front of the East Engineering building.
For the convenience of the visitors, the
groups will be small and will start at
frequent intervals. For those visitors
whose time is limited, or who, for other
reasons, wish to visit only certain exhibits,
the guides can be of assistance in map-
ping out special tours.
Test Model in the Large Wind Tunnel
The S.W.E. will be assisted by mem-
bers of the Triangle fraternity, who will
guide visitors to Engineering Research,
and by volunteers from the engineering
college as a whole. Each will have a gen-
eral knowledge of all the exhibits.
However, the guides' main duty will be
to conduct visitors through the displays,

The Aeronautical Department has been
working energetically for the last two
months setting up displays for the open
house which should be of interest to
laymen, technical men, and students of
10
all levels. The exhibits give a general
cross-section of the work carried on by the
students and a picture of the equipment
they have at their disposal. The whole
department has co-operated in making this
the most interesting open house since the
war.
Wind Tunnel
Your tour probably begins in the base-
ment of the old part of East Engineering
where the department was confined for
some time before construction on the new
building began. Here is the oldest and
largest wind tunnel on the campus. It has
a 5' x 8' octagonal test cell, and is of the
closed throat, double-return type. As an
example of the versatility of this tunnel,
it has tested everything from different
aeronautical configurations down to the
"which - way - is - it - going" Studebaker.
Speeds up to 150 mph are obtained for
testing purposes. The fan is driven by a
200 hp. motor. This tunnel will be set
up with a model mounted in the test sec-
tion. Visitors will see the six com-
ponent balance system which measures
the forces on the model while the tunnel
is in operation, and how important data
is taken from these tests.
Structures
The structures laboratory has prepared
some unusual demonstrations, which, it is
hoped, will catch the spectators' interest.
A cantilever channel will illustrate the
principle of shear center. A built-up
panel will be tested in compression, and
the waves which spring up prior to failure
of the panel may be observed. Of great
interest will be a large metal bar
equipped with an electric strain gage.
This will enable the visitor to "see" the
deflection in the bar produced by hold-
ing the bar. Also shown will be the
Analog Computer, a machine used to solve
difficult and tedious problems. The prob-
lem of a vibrating mass on the end of a
spring will be demonstrated and calcu-
lated.
Here, too, will be displayed one of the
first radial engines developed. It is of
the rotary type in which the crankcase,
cylinder head, and spark plugs rotate with
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


the propeller. Other articles, like drones
used for radio controlled target models,
and the pulse jets developed during the
war are on display there.
Aero. Lab.
From the basement visitors climb to the
upper stories of the building, not stopping
until they reach the fourth floor. On this
floor is the aerodynamics laboratory. In
it there is a supersonic blow-down tun-
nel, a smoke tunnel, and another small
wind tunnel.
The supersonic tunnel delivers a jet
of air which travels at a mach number of
1.5, or li/2 times the speed of sound.
Its purpose is purely for experimental
work in the supersonic region. A Laval
convergent and divergent supersonic
nozzle is used and it contains a small test
section. The nozzle is made of transpar-
ent plastic and has a three inch visible
section in which bodies of different shapes
are placed for testing. The large tank
which holds the supply of air used is
filled from the University 100 psi com-
pressed air line. The ratio of the pies-
sure in the tank to the atmospheric pres-
sure is such that when the valve to the
nozzle is opened the jet of air shoots out
and past the test body at iy2 times the
speed of sound. This supersonic blast of
air has a duration of about 50 seconds.
With the aid of a Schlieren system
which is based on this phenomena, shock
waves can readily be seen and photo-
graphed. In the accompanying photo-
graph, which was made in this nozzle,
the dark oblique lines are the shock waves.
With the Schlieren system setup, the
image of the body and the shock waves
can be cast on a screen and enlarged. This
device is in action periodically during the
day for the benefit of the guests.
Also in this room is the smoke tunnel
which shows the distribution of airflow
over a body. This device is a miniature
runnel about the size of a stove pipe with
a glass section. A body is suspended in
the glass section and stream lines, made
visible by white smoke, are passed through
the tunnel in the air stream. These lines
split up as they pass over the body and in
this way they show the streamlined flow
over a body in an air stream.
Also in operation is the small sub-
sonic wind tunnel use for student instruc-
tion. This is a single return, continuous
tunnel. The test section is closed and it is
are the two miniature jet engines that are
being run. One is a ram jet which is
basically just a hollow tube, and the other
is a pulse jet, or intermittant jet, which
has valves that open and close very rapid-
ly due to the pressures acting on them.

Wright Cyclone 1000 h.p. Radial Engine and Allison V-12 In Line Engine
approximately 2 feet by 3 feet in size.
Thirty-five horsepower is required to at-
tain a maximum velocity of 100 feet per
second.
The tunnel experiment on display is
one which determines the pressure dis-
tribution on an airfoil. A wing section
placed in the wind tunnel has small ori-
fices along both the top and bottom
chord of the wing. Each orifice is con-
nected by a separate tube to a multiple
tube manometer. The static pressure at
the orifice causes a change in the height
of the fluid column within the mano-
meter tube. This change in the fluid
height is proportional to the pressure on
the airfoil at the particular orifice con-
nected to the manometer column. The
airfoil lifting characteristics are deter-
mined by the pressure distribution.
Propulsion Lab.
The last stop in East Engineering Build-
ing is the propulsion laboratory which is
only a few doors away.
Perhaps the most interesting displays there
Visitors will also see the various
methods of measuring the high tempera-
tures in the combustion chambers of jet
engines. The principle methods are
shielded and bare thermocouples, optical
pyrometers, and the resistance type of
thermal element. The behavior of flame
holders in jet engines is also being shown.
Open flame and V-flame equipment is on
display and should be of interest to all
aeronautical students. Visitors will also
see the different methods used in aircraft
to measure fluid flow.
Power Plants
After seeing the many displays in East
Engineering Building the tour moves on
to the West Engineering Annex where
there is much that is of interest to all who
visit there. This building houses the
equipment and test facilities for power
plant courses, both aeronautical and auto-
motive.
Among the various assembled engines
on stands in the lab are several of the
types which powered many of our air-
APRIL, 1949


model of the famous Pratt &amp; Whitney
"2800" series, the engine used in Navy's
"Corsairs" and "Hellcats" and the Army's
"Thunderbolts." There is also a Wright
"Cyclone" 1820, the type which powered
the famous "Flying Forts" and the Navy's
Douglas "Dauntless" dive bombers. Of
special interest is a Pratt &amp; Whitney
"Twin Wasp" 1830 which has been cut
away, exposing the internal parts of the
engine. The engine may be turned over
by hand, allowing observation of the mov-
ing parts.
Supersonic Shock Wave Formation
More familiar to the auto owner is the
liquid cooled, in-line type, of which there
are two in the lab: an Allison V-1710,
and a Packard-built Rolls Royce "Mer-
lin." The Allison powered the Curtiss
"Warhawks," which the Flying Tigers
flew to fame and the "Merlin," a British
design, was used, in the P-51 "Mustang"
and the British "Spitfire." Both engines
are V-12's, and are very similar in de-
sign and rating. The "Merlin" has been
disassembled, allowing inspection of its
components.
In actual operation is the Continental
C-85, a comparatively small light plane
engine located in the south end of the
laboratory. The testing apparatus on this
engine is valuable in determining the
various losses involved in an engine of
this type. Flight conditions are simulated
by blowing air in the front of the cowl
and collecting and recording the tempera-
hires of the air as it leaves the system.
In this manner the losses resulting from
the air flow over the engine may be
computed. Other losses such as exhaust
gas and cooling water loss can also be
found in a similar manner.
Under high power conditions, such as
one would encounter in a steep climb, the
engine heats rapidly. The amount of over-
heating can be seen by looking through
the glass in the top of the engine mount-
ing and observing the exhaust pipe and
surrounding parts. A dull red color is
noticed at first and becomes more notice-
able as the engine is progressively loaded.
To find the exact amount of overheating
one may refer to the temperature record-
ing instruments on the table at the left
of the engine.
While all the large production type
jet propulsion (gas turbine) devices are
located at Willow Run, the power plant
lab has several small gas turbines which
illustrate the principles very well. They
are single combustor units, utilizing a
turbo-supercharger as compressor and tur-
bine. One was developed by the Army
to power small target aircraft and oper-
ates at a speed of 20,000 rpm. The other
was built here at the University by
graduate students in order to study the gas
turbine cycle.
As for novelty, how about a radial en-
gine using neither connecting rods nor
crankshaft? Such an engine is the Cam-
inez-Fairchild "cam" engine, designed and
built for production in the late 1920's.
To transform the reciprocating motion of
the pistons to rotary motion of the pro-
pellor shaft, this engine utilizes a large
cam which bears on rollers in the pis-
tons and is fixed to the shaft.
This completes the Aeronautical De-
partment's displays in Ann Arbor. How-
ever, those visitors who care to take a bus
to the Willow Run laboratories find much
that is of interest there.
Willow Run
Many problems arise in the design of
either a reciprocating engine or a jet
engine. The purpose of the engine labs
at Willow Run Airport is to study inde-
pendently various problems of combus-
tion, both contained in an engine cylinder
and flow as in a jet engine. Ram jets with
their high velocities present still another
type of problem. Often, because the
speed of flow is higher than the flame
speed, the fire will be blown out.
During open house the lab and equip-
ment is on display with demonstrations
taking place throughout the day. There is
a Packard Rolls-Royce Merlin V1650 En-
gine, an 1-16 jet engine and some high
speed flow equipment on display.
The 1-16 is one of the first American
built jet engines. It was taken largely
from designs by Sir Frank Whittle, an
outstanding pioneer in the jet engine
field, and was used in the Bell P-59, the
first American jet plane.
The equipment used in the high
speed flow section consists mainly of a
long tube four inches in diameter with
several quartz viewing ports located along
its length, numerous pressure taps, and
thermocouples as well as injection nozzles
located at predetermined points. The
tube is supplied with high velocity air
and when fuel is injected and successfully
ignited, a study can be made of the re-
sulting fire. The flame set up is studied
through the ports and conclusions made
as to changes in nozzle, ignition, and
pressure.

The Unit Operations laboratory will be
open for inspection on the day of Open
House. A number of semi-industrial units
will be on display, as well as laboratory
units. The following is a partial listing.
1. Fractionating Column
The fractionating column on display
is a 7 plate, 18.5" rectifying section of
an ethanol-water column. It is a con-


Fractionating Column
tinuous bubble-cap column, in which a
30% solution of ethanol and water (30%
ethanol, 70% water) is concentrated to
approximately 95% ethanol. The "feed,"
or 30% solution, enters the column in
the bottom "plate," or level. Heat sup-
plied by a steam boiler vaporizes part of
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


plate will be richer in ethanol than the
liquid on that plate. This vapor rises to
the next higher plate, is partially con-
densed, vaporized, and moves on up the
column; each succeeding step enriching
the vapor until the vapor reaches a con-
centration of 95% on the top plate. At
this point it is drawn off and condensed.
The fractionating plate column is used
widely in industry for concentrating
liquids. It affords an efficient means of
separating volatile liquids.
2. Drying and Evaporation Research
The equipment in room 2206 was built
for a research project sponsored by in-
dustry. It is intended for two purposes;
to study transfer of heat to superheated
steam, and to study drying of solids in
superheated steam.
It operates as follows: a blower cir-
culates steam through the dryer through
the annulus of a double-tube heat ex-
changer and back to the dryer. At the
dryer the steam flows over the sample
being dried. Molten salts are pumped
from a reservoir (near the windows)
through the center tube of the heat ex-
changer, and back to the reservoir. The
molten salts are heated electrically; salt
is used to obtain a uniform flow of heat
to the steam. Complete instrumentation
permits close control of variable factors
and greatly facilitates collection of data.
The equipment is heavily insulated be-
cause of temperatures of 300 - 700 de-
grees Fahrenheit.
Other types of evaporators are solar
evaporators which utilize heat from the
sun to evaporate liquid, and evaporation
towers in which the liquid is removed by
convection currents, gases, and wind.
3. Freon Condenser
A horizontal shell-and-tube condenser
will also be in operation in the laboratory.
This condenser utilizes a new develop-
ment in heat transfer—finned tubes
through which condensing water passes.
Vapor to be condensed enters the shell
at the top, is condensed on the surface of
the tubes, and leaves at the bottom. The
area of condensing surface per foot of
tube is increased by the addition of fins
to the tubes.
On the third floor of East Engineering
are laboratories in which research is be-
ing conducted on plastics, paints and
varnishes. Organic chemistry equipment
will be in operation in rooms 3219 and
3227. Research on paints and oils is be-
ing conducted by graduate students, who
will be on hand to explain their work. A
paint-grinding mill and other apparatus,
including a paint sprayer, will be located
in room 3230.
4. Research on Fin Tube Heat Transfer
The principle part of the apparatus con-
sists of two concentric tubes; the outer
tube being transparent plastic, and the
inner tube being a copper transverse-
finned tube. Cold water passes through
the space between the tubes, hot water
passes through the inner tube, and meas-
urements are taken of temperature change
monoxide from the gas. The remaining
CH4, hydrogen and nitrogen can be de-
termined by ignition in the explosive
pipette.
Opposite the Orsat apparatus is the
equipment used to determine the heating
value of natural gas. It consists of a wet
test meter which measures the volume
of gas passing through, and a gas calori-
meter, in which the gas is burned heating
a measured amount of water. From the
temperature to which the water is raised,
and the volume of gas and water, the
heating value of the gas is determined.

Continuous Rotary, High-Concentration Vacuum Filter
and flow rates. The heat transferred by
the finned tube may be calculated from
the experimental data.
The fins serve the purpose of increas-
ing the heat-transfer area. Tubes with
fins of varying sizes are tested.
The purpose of the transparent outer
tube is to observe the patterns of fluid
flow over the finned tube.
5. Measurement Laboratories
The Measurement laboratories are lo-
cated in rooms 4214 and 4223. These
laboratories are equipped to illustrate the
principles of physics and chemistry that
pertain to problems in chemical engineer-
ing.
To analyze a gas the Orsat portable gas
analyzer and explosive pipette is demon-
strated. The Orsat apparatus consists of a
burette into which is passed the gas to he
analyzed, and four pipettes containing
liquids which absorb carbon dioxide,
C H2 compounds, oxygen, and carbon
On the long table in the middle of the
laboratory is the equipment for carrying
out determinations of the heat of com-
bustion of a solid or liquid fuel, and its
carbon content. It consists of a bomb
calorimeter into which is loaded the
sample of fuel. The bomb is sealed and
completely immersed in water. By ignit-
ing the fuel electrically and measuring
the rise in temperature of the water, the
heat of combustion may be calculated.
Another important property of a fluid
is its viscosity. The constant-temperature
bath and Ostwald viscosimeter are used
for determination of viscosity. The baths
contain oil, and are kept at temperatures
of 100 degrees Centigrade and 180 de-
grees Centigrade by thermostats. The
viscosity of the unknown liquid is deter-
mined by placing the liquid in the viscosi-
meter which is in turn placed in the baths.
In the bottom of the viscosimeter is an
orifice of known size. The viscosity is
determined from the time taken for a
APRIL, 1949

known orifice.
Vapor pressure of liquids can be meas-
ured by a modified Ramsay-Young
method. This consists of evacuating a
flask until the liquid in the flask begins
to boil. This is the vapor pressure of
the liquid at room temperature. Subse-

Ammonia Absorbtion Unit
quent vapor pressures at higher tempera-
tures may be determined by increasing
the pressure by increments and heating
the liquid to the boiling point.
Vapor density of a liquid is determined
by means of the Victor Meyer method.
A small sample containing the liquid is
dropped into a vaporization tube which is
heated by a steam jacket. The liquid is
vaporized and the air displaced by the
vapor is collected in a eudiometer tube.
The density can be determined from the
volume of air collected and the original
weight of the liquid.
Surface tension is another property of
liquids which can be determined ex-
perimentally. The Du Nuoy tensiometer
is employed to determine this property,
and operates as follows; a platinum ring
is lifted from the surface of the tested
liquid by applying torsion to a wire
connected to a beam from which the ring
is suspended. A scale indicates the magni-
tude of torsion applied.
The distillation of a binary mixture en-
ables the student to use the Abbe refracto-
meter. Two liquids are mixed and heated
to the boiling point. Samples of the dis-
tillate and residue are placed in the re-
fractometer and their exact compositions
may be determined by measuring the re-
fractive index. By this method it is pos-
sible to plot a curve of liquid-vapor
equilibrium for all compositions of the
mixture.
The rate of reaction of chemical com-
pounds can be determined by means ct
the Fischer conductivity bridge. This in-
strument measures the conductivity of the
reacting substances. From the conductiv-
ity it is possible to determine the volume
of substances completely reacted, as well
as the specific reaction rate.
Colorimeter analysis is becoming in-
creasingly important in industry. The
intensity of coloration of a solution is a
function of its concentration. The color
intensity of a solution may be bauged
with a Fisher electrophotometer. This
device consists of two photoelectric celis
in a Wheatstone bridge circuit. The dif-
ference in intensity between the light fall-
ing directly on a photoelectric cell and
the light passing through the solution to
the other cell is a measure of the solution
concentration.
The hydrogen electrode is used to de-
termine the precise neutralization point in
a titration process. The electrode is meas-
ured against a calomel electrode. The
hydrogen electrode consists of a platinum
wire coated with gaseous hydrogen. The
hydrogen is kept bubbling through the
electrode constantly. The calomel elec-
trode consists of mercury covered with a
mercuric-chloride-and-mercury layer and
potassium chloride solution. These elec-
trodes are connected to a potentiometer,
and the voltage across each is measured.
With this reading the neutralization
point may be determined.
The glass electrode serves the same
purpose as the hydrogen electrode. It is,
however, a more compact and portable in-
strument. It is composed of a pH sensi-
tive glass within which is a standard
solution of hydrochloric acid and a silver-
chloride electrode. The pH of the un-
known solution is measured directly when
an electric potential difference is set up
between the solutions inside and outside.
Room 4223 is equipped with optical
pyrometers, as well as total-radiation pyro-
meters. Three optical pyrometers are
available; two Leeds &amp; Northrup, and
a Pyro optical machine. These instru-
ments operate on the principle of change
in color of a body from black to white
with increase in temperature. The tem-
perature of a body is determined by
matching the body against the color scale
within the pyrometer.
Two radiation pyrometers are available;
a Leeds &amp; Northrup instrument and a
Pyro Perfect. These measure the tempera-
ture of a body by measuring the radiation
emanating from the body.

The foundry of the University of
Michigan is a complete jobbing type foun-
type furnace, crucible furnace, and an in-
duction furnace equipped with four melt-
ing stations. The foundry is further
equipped with molding machines of all
types, pattern-making equipment, equip-
ment for cleaning castings, and testing
laboratories.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


during the morning of Open House.
Melting and pouring of non-ferrous
metals will be demonstrated: the labora-
tories also will be in operation. During
the afternoon cast iron will be melted in
the cupola furnace and poured.
The cupola furnace is a fuel-burning
unit used for melting cast iron. Metal
and coke are "charged," or loaded into
the oven, through a door twelve feet
above the ground. As the mixture de-
scends the metal is melted by the heat
of the combustion of the coke. The mol-
ten metal collects in a pool at the bot-
tom, and is tapped from the front of the
cupola into a large "bull" ladle. From
this ladle the metal is poured into smaller
ladles for conveyance to the molds.
The crucible furnace is a gas-fired fur-
nace in which the metal is contained in a
glazed crucible. It is employed principally
for melting non-ferrous metals.
The induction furnace operates on the
principle of induced electric current. The
primary circuit of the furnace consists of
hollow copper tubing through which flows
cooling water to prevent the tubes from
melting themselves. Current is supplied
by a 40 hp. motor-generator set, located
in the center of the foundry, on the right.
The 400-volt, 3000-cycle current which
flows in the primary circuit induces a cur-
rent in the secondary circuit, the second-
ary circuit being the metal charge. The
secondary current induced against the re-
sistance of the metal produces the heat for
melting. This furnace can melt 70 pounds
of cold metal in 20 minutes.
Cores are employed in foundry practice
to produce holes and interior forms in
castings. They are composed of sand held
together by an oil or cereal binder, and
are hardened by baking in a core furnace.
The core furnace is gas-fired, and operates
at 450 degrees Fahrenheit.
The molding machines in the foundry
are of the "jolt", "jolt-squeeze", and other
types. One best can appreciate the signifi-
cance of the names when one sees the
machines in operation.
Sand-testing laboratories constantly are
performing tests on core- and molding-
sands. Sand-testing is an essential part
of the operation of a foundry, since many
properties of castings directly depend on
the condition of the sand.
The crystal structure of cast metals is
studied in the adjacent metallographic
laboratory. The laboratory is equipped
with polishing equipment and microscopes
for the study of crystal structure.
X-Ray Lab.
The Chemical and Metallurgical Engi-
neering x-ray laboratory is located in
rooms 4046 and 4048, East Engineering
building.
In room 4046 is the radiography equip-
ment. Lead-lined for the protection of
personnel, the installation consists of a
stationary Westinghouse 150 kilovolt
unit and a portable Picker 100-kilovolt
machine. These x-ray machines are used

for non-destructive examination of cast-
ings, forgings, sheet, bar and other metal
products.
X-ray diffraction equipment located in
room 4048 is used to determine the crys-
tal structure and chemical composition of
materials. The three units in operation
are; a North American Philips, 38 kilo-
volt, two-window generator used in con-

Pouring Molten Metal from the Induction Melting Unit

junction with a Geiger-Muller counter
and recorder; a North American Philips,
60 kilovolt, four-window vertical-tube
generator; and a cold cathode unit which
enables the use of a wide variety of tar-
gets. The Geiger-Muller counter and re-
corder will be in operation to demon-
strate the determination of diffraction
characteristics of metals. The 60 kilovolt
unit cameras will be in position for high-
precision determination of lattice para-
meter by the back-reflection method.
The electric furnaces are of the resis-
tance and induction types. The vacuum-
fusion apparatus will be in operation; this
device is employed to remove gases from
metals, and to determine the gas con-
tent in metals.
Jominy equipment will also be on dis-
play. This equipment is used in determin-
ing the hardenability of steel.
High-frequency induction equipment
will be operated to display the method
of surface-hardening steel and malleable
iron.

The Civil Engineering Open House
displays are being sponsored by the Stu-
dent Chapter of the American Society
of Civil Engineers and are being shown
in conjunction with Chi Epsilon, the
APRIL, 1949
15


The displays are divided into three gen-
eral groups. Group I is in East Engineer-
ing Building and includes the concrete
and the Soil Mechanics Laboratories and
the Transportation displays. Group II is
on the second and third floors of the
South wing of West Engineering Building
and includes the Structures, Construc-
tion, and the Geodesy and Surveying
displays. Group III consists of displays
in the new Hydraulics and Sanitary Engi-
neering Laboratory in the basement of the
North wing of West Engineering Build-
ing.
Group I
The Transportation branch of the Civil
Engineering Department, located on the
first floor of East Engineering Building
will have displays illustrating various
phases of Railway, Highway, and High-
way Traffic Engineering. In the center of
one classroom there is a working model
railroad with miniature HO gauge rolling
stock. On exhibit in other parts of the
room are additional models and full sized
pieces of railroad track and equipment
of importance to the engineer.
Appropriately placed at the dangerous
intersection of "Main Hall and North
Wing" there is a real traffic signal. On
this signal there is a controller box so that
anyone caring to try his hand at being
a traffic cop may do so.
In the Transportation Library, which is,
incidentally, the most complete library of
its kind in the country, there are numer-
sent ocean travel throughout the world.
In the Concrete Laboratory the group
is shown the first successfully analyzed
concrete beams. Designed and built by
Dr. Ala E. Fatin of Alexandria, Egypt,
these beams are tested accurately for in-
ternal and external stresses by means of
over two hundred electric strain gages,
most of which are buried inside the beam,
and the latest recording equipment. While
the group is in the Concrete Laboratory
sample concrete test cylinders will be
taken from the "moist room" and tested.
Some of these have been designed and
mixed to break at predetermined loads;
others are cylinders actually cut from dif-
ferent concrete highways throughout
Michigan.
The group next goes through the
Bituminous Testing Laboratories where
analyses are made of the various tars and
asphalts used on Michigan highways. The
Cement Laboratory has on display both
tension and compression briquettes used
for testing cements. The Aggregates
Laboratory will show how different quan-
tities of sand and gravel are derived for
the design of gravel roads and for mix-
tures for high control concrete.
The Soils Laboratory is displaying
Proctor Tests, California Bearing Ratio
testing equipment, and the equipment
used for Field Density determination of
soils. Vibration compaction and uncon-
fined compression-shear tests are being
run, and the Davis Peat Sampler and
other universally used soil sampling
1/40 Scale Aluminum Model of a New Type Hipped Structure
ous pictures and models showing some
of the historical development of transpor-
tation facilities. Several large ship models
will be on display in the library to repre-
equipment is being shown. These in-
clude the Plunger Core Barrel and the
Open Core Barrel soil sampling spoons,
which were developed by the Soil Mech-
anics department here at the University of
Michigan.
The next stop is the Soil Mechanics
Laboratory where the field samples that
have been taken are tested and analyzed.
Here sieve analyses, plastic limits, liquid
limits, hydrometer analyses and organic
contents are actually found for those
interested.
Group II
In Room 204 the Geodesy and Sur-
veying branches are displaying surveying

Colloidal Filter
instruments and equipment used by the
students. There are several transits of
different sizes, wye and dumpy levels, and
the different types of level rods. A plane
table and alidade are set up just as the
students use them in the field for map
making. A map in the various stages of
completion is shown so that the visitor
can follow the work as it progresses.
There are aerial photographs and a dis-
play of how the students are coordinating
them into a map. Records and typical stu-
dent problems are on display and there is
a student on hand to answer questions.
The Structures display is located in
Room 302 and consists largely of
models actually built and used by students
for stress analysis, as seen in the pic-
ture. There are multi-colored plastic
models of structural sections so that one
may see how the connections are riveted
together. A scale model of the Ambassa-
dor Bridge and models of some of the
proposed Straits of Mackinac Bridge de-
tails are also on display.
Also in the Structure display is the
"Preview Showing" in the United States
of an entirely new type of roof structure
called Hipped Plate Construction. It
was first proposed in Germany and is
being further developed in the United
States by Cornell University and the

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


time the American Society of Civil Engi-
neers have a special committee set up to
analyze the work being done on Hipped
Plate Construction in the United States.
The Construction display occupies
Room 201 and consists of working
models of graders, loaders, shovels and
various other machinery. Some of these
models are electrically operated and show
grading and digging equipment in opera-
tion. Pictures and cut-away detailed
charts of large tractors, full tracks, clams,
draglines and cranes are also on display.
There is a display of large equipment in
the South Engineering Parking Lot.
Group III
In the Sanitary Laboratory may be
found working displays of sedimentation
tanks and sand filters. There is a cut-
away model of an Artesian Well showing
how many of our water sources operate.
Also, one may view microscope slides of
organisms found in tap water and treat-
ed sewage. Placards are mounted around
the walls showing, in simple cut-away
illustrations, the various methods used to
treat both drinking water and sewage
wastes.
The Hydraulic display is in the new
Hydraulics Laboratory in the basement
by the North door of West Engineering
Building. Here, there is a model of
Hoover Dam and models of its piping
and the flow through them. Also on dis-
play are various hydraulic phenomena
including laboratory flow through water
gates and hydraulic jump.
At Willow Run Airport in Building 42
the Civil Engineering Department is
operating the new Lake Hydraulics Lab-
oratory. This laboratory has been espec-
ially designed for making hydraulic model
studies of harbors, breakwaters, beach ero-
sion, sedimentation and the similar prob-
lems that may arise along the shores of
the Great Lakes and other waters. The
laboratory is provided with large tanks,
wave machines and all necessary measur-
ing equipment.
On display in Building 42 is a large
model of the harbor at Port Sanilac,
Michigan. This will be in operation and
will demonstrate the laboratory facilities
in an interesting presentation of wave ac-
tion on the breakwaters and harbor facili-
ties of this Lake Huron port.

The Automobile Ignition Display will
be made up of several sections, starting
with the assumption that you know prac-
tically nothing about electricity and pro-
gressing to show transient behavior in this
common circuit. Components will be
arranged so that you can vary the "car"
speed and see what happens. An oscillo-
scope will automatically draw graphs to
illustrate what is happening. Charts and
engineers will be on hand to explain the
ignition system.
Dynamic Demonstrator
The Dynamic Demonstrator is a mod-
ern superheterodyne radio receiver set
up in "breadboard" fashion for the pur-
pose of teaching radio principles to stu-
dents in understandable form. Anyone
on looking inside a radio set for the first
time is naturally confused by the seeming
disorder of wires and tubes. It is a great
help to the student to straighten out the
circuit into recognizable form. To ac-
complish this task, a circuit diagram is
printed on the "breadboard" and the
actual circuit is built so that the terminals
of the circuit elements appear at their
proper places on the diagram. The ar-
radio and finally emerges as sound from
the loudspeaker.
Microwaves
The recent development of radar and
microwave technology gave a great im-
pact to scientific progress. Electromag-
netic waves pump endlessly into space to
bounce back upon the unsleeping screen.
Today, the application of microwave
technology is as effective as it was in the
past. Microwave techniques that were
learned from the experiences with radar
are now applied successfully to television.
Already established are several important
links that utilize microwaves for the trans-
mission of the television signal. Ultra-
high frequency oscillators, coaxial lines,
waveguides, and measuring devices are
built to operate at frequencies ranging
up to the thousands of megacycles.
Induction Heating
Ordinarily electrical engineers are con-
cerned with elimination of heat losses
associated with rapidly fluctuating cur-
rent. Some time ago, however, engineers
began to try to put this heat to a practical

Hydraulic Research Project
rangement of the circuit in this manner
makes it easy to identify each functioning
group—the radio frequency stages, the
local oscillator, the intermediate frequency
stages, the audio stages, and the loud
speaker at the end. The functions and
adjustments of the radio are easily
demonstrated with the Dynamic Demon-
strator since the problem of identification
is solved. One most interesting experi-
ment on the device is to connect an oscil-
lograph to the circuit in various stages
and see the operations performed upon
the signal as it progresses through the
use. The result was the introduction of
high frequency heating. Induction heat-
ing is one important phase of this type of
heat generation.
The working part of an induction heat-
er is a coil of wire logically enough
called the work coil. The piece of
metal to be heated is called the work.
A high frequency alternating current is
brought in close proximity to the coil as
efficiency is then maximized. The current
in the work coil of the heater induces a
high current in the work. This induced
current circulates against the resistance of

resistivity of the work material in accord-
ance with Ohm's Law. This heat can be
made so intense as to actually melt the

W8AX2 has a 50 watt radiotelephone
transmitter operating in the 10 meter
band. It uses two 807 tubes in parallel in
U of M Radio Club Equipment W8AXZ
work and several designs of induction
furnaces for this purpose are in use today.
The automotive industry has also made
use of induction heating to surface-harden
bearing parts in a relatively thin layer by
applying the skin effect theory of alternat-
ing current. This theory states that as the
frequency of a current is increased, the
current will follow in a thinner layer close
to the surface of the conductor.
The advantages of induction heating
are its speed in heating most metal
pieces; the fact that heat can be con-
fined to any desired area may be a small
part of the total; and heating starts and
stops instantly with the application and
removal of radio-frequency power. The
restriction of its use lies in its high cost
due to high initial cost, cost of tube re-
placement, and higher cost of electric
energy because of its over-all lower effi-
ciency.
The Hydrocal
The Hydrocal is a hydrodynamic cal-
culating machine for solving unsteady-
state problems in heat transfer and other
types of diffusion. The machine consists
of a number of standpipes which act as
storage reservoirs for "heat" or whatever
is considered to be diffusing. Flow tubes
which act as resistance to flow are attached
to the standpipes by means of rubber
tubing. By proper selection of standpipes,
flow tubes, "resistors," and connections
between flow tubes and standpipes, a
solution to a problem may be obtained.
the final amplifier stage; a Dumont oscil-
loscope is used for monitoring (checking
signal and modulation) ; and the antenna
system consists of a dipole made from
two whip antennas fed by a 150 ohm
indicator selsyn motors. It is expected
to improve the antenna gain and provide
high directivity of transmission. Second
is the 1000 watt continuous wave trans-
mitter for 40 meter use. The VFO
(variable frequency oscillator) controlled
Navy aircraft transmitter GO-9, and the
Army transmitter BC-375, and Army Re-
ceiver BC-312 are being converted to
amateur use.
It is the custom of "Hams" to ex-
change Q S L cards (cards of acknowl-
edgement) when they have contacted each
other. The U. of M. Radio Club has
Q S L cards on display from many states
and foreign countries.
Stroboscopic Effect
The effect that is experienced when a
revolving wheel or disc appears to be
standing still is the Stroboscopic effect.
This can be observed in the movies when
the spokes of a rotating wagon wheel
seem to be motionless.
The effect is sometimes achieved by
putting a contact point on the moving
wheel, and allowing a brush to touch the
contact. Every time the brush and the
contact on the wheel touch, a circuit is
closed that turns on the light that illumi-

ceiver is a R. M. E. 69 short wave re-
ceiver.
The club has several projects now
under way. Almost complete is the new

stant, the disc moves on, breaking the

server momentarily can not see the disc.

revolving disc appears to be standing still,
because each revolution is visible at the
same position at which it was seen when
the light flashed on a moment ago, and
Photoelastic Stress Pattern of Quenched
Hollow Glass Cylinder
the observer does not see the very rapid
flashes because the eye retains an impres-
sion for a period of about one tenth of a
second of any object viewed.
Photoelectric Cell
A photoelectric cell usually consists of
two electrodes in an evacuated glass en-
velope. The cathode, a specially treated
surface, will give off electrons when ex-
posed to light. These electrons are then
drawn to the anode by applying a posi-
tive potential to it. The number of elec-
trons released from the surface depends
not only upon the intensity of the inci-
dent light, but also upon its wave length.
The usual way of utilizing this current
is to pass it through a series resistance,
and to impress the voltage drop obtained
upon the grid circuit of a suitable ampli-
fier tube. The output voltage of the am-
plifier will then be large enough to oper-
ate a magnetic relay or a thyratron
vacuum tube. By this means, almost any
mechanical actions such as opening a
door, ringing a doorbell, may be obtained.
A frequent application of the photo-
tube occurs in industry where a sorting
arrangement by color is desired. In this
case, a light may be reflected off the sur-
face to be inspected, and into a color sen-
sitive tube. As long as objects of the cor-
rect color pass through the light, a con-
stant current is maintained through the
tube. However, when an object of a dif-
ferent color passes by, a change occurs
in the incident light, causing a current
change, and the relay circuit will cause
the object to be rejected.
Semi-Conductors
By the oxidation of one face of a cop-
per sheet to cuprous oxide, a semicon-
ductor results which has much higher re-
sistance to current flow in one direction
than in the opposite direction. This prin-
ciple is used in the copper oxide rectifier
to convert alternating current to direct
current. Other familiar semiconductors
are those used in photographic light
meters and in photoelectric cells. The
conductivity of these materials increases
when light impinges upon them. The
conductivity of most semiconductors in-
creases with higher temperatures, and
certain materials which exhibit this prop-
erty to a marked degree are used in ther-
mistors, which find many useful applica-
tions. Perhaps the most recent applica-
tion of semiconductors is the transistor, a
Pig. I
small cylindrically shaped device less than
half an inch long, which uses this effect
to change mechanical vibrations to elec-
trical impulses.
Tcsla Coil
In 1891, Nikola Tesla dazzled the
British Institution of Electrical Engineers
with his experiments on alternating cur-
rents of high potential and high fre-
quency. To this day the crackling dis-
charges produced by Tesla coils continue
to delight both amateur and professional
experimenters. Of practical importance,
Tesla coils have often been used on
vacuum equipment. The luminescence
resulting from the spark discharge of the
coil gives a good indication of the degree
of vacuum. In another field the automo-
bile ignition system is a direct application
of Tesla's spark-producing technique.
Even Tesla himself would be surprised by
the modern magic his high-voltage, high-
frequency experiments have produced.

Photoelasticity
Two demonstrations will be carried on
continuously during the Open House. In
Room 108, West Engineering Building, a
variety of experiments will be shown
which are for your entertainment and in-
struction. Color bands and fringe pictures
will show how stresses occur in beams,
discs, and curved bars used in structures
and machines.
Another photoelastic demonstration
will be given in Room 312, West Engi-
neering Annex. Three-dimensional pho-
toelastic patterns produced by quenching
stresses in glass will be shown. The use
of the Babinet Compensator and the
Saleil Compensator in photoelastic stress
analysis will be demonstrated.
The Photoelastic method is a powerful
tool for studying stress distribution in
both simple and complicated shapes which
are subjected to loading. Design can
often be improved by observing the pat-
terns shown in the polariscope when a
transparent model made of plastic or glass
is loaded as it is in practice.
Fluid Mechanics
The Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of the
Department of Engineering Mechanics
will exhibit numerous demonstrations in
fluid flow, featuring one apparatus which
is not to be seen in any other American
laboratory.



Universal Testing Machine

Fig. 2
Shown in Figure 1, is the device, which
projects actual flow of fluids on a beaded
screen so that one may observe the mo-
tion of fluids through or around a model
of any object.
Visualizing flow is emphasized through-
out the exhibit. This is done not only
with the apparatus shown, but with the
help of the smoke tunnel shown in Figure
2, a Hele-Shaw apparatus, and a strobo-
scopic light. The smoke tunnel shown in
Figure 2 is capable of indicating the flow
pattern around any object, for example, a
building or an airfoil.
The Hele-Shaw apparatus makes use of
dyed streams and produces the picture
shown in Figure 3. This is laminar flow,
popularly known as stream line flow.
Flow of an entirely different kind around
an object of the same shape is often pro-
duced. That a jet of water is not what
it seems to the naked eye is clearly shown
by a stroboscopic view of the streams
shown in Figure 4. At the left the stream
appears to be headed by a mushroom
formation. Under stroboscopic light this
will be seen to be an actual water ring
resembling the better known smoke ring.
These water rings are being discharged
in rapid succession from the hose and one
just being formed is shown in Figure
4.
Water does not always flow downhill
This interesting phenomenon, known as
hydraulic jump, is demonstrated in the
plexiglass flume.
In various other pieces of apparatus
one may see the actual onset of secondary
motion and of turbulence within the
fluid. While the exhibit is intended to be
educational and to demonstrate the
principles of fluid flow, its sponsors have
introduced some non-practical displays for
the observer's enjoyment.
Materials Testing
The materials testing laboratory in
room 102 West Engineering holds the
testing machines used in testing and
classifying mechanical parts. The term
Engineering Mechanics Materials Testing
is applied, in this case, to those materials
which the engineer will use in designing
parts and machinery for the industry in
which he is to be employed. One of the
most common tests run on a material is
the determination of its tensile strength,
which is a measure of the maximum pull
a given size member can carry. Tensile
Fig. 3
tests are usually run to failure and by
such a destructive test, the material's duc-
tility can be determined. Although a ma-
terial's tensile strength is of great im-
portance, it is useless if the material is
not isotropic when its particular applica-
tion calls for its use as a compressive
member.
A quick look at the methods of me-
chanical power transmission will show the
prominent role played by rotating shafts.
A prime requisite of such a shaft is that
in the process of transmitting a torque, it
must not deform appreciably. However,
we know from experience that ductile ma-
terials are prone to "wind up" under even
moderate torques. This lack of rigidity
is also found in low carbon steel and this
fact will be vividly demonstrated during
Open House when a one inch diameter
specimen will be given twenty or more
complete twists before it fractures.
Numerous gages and apparatus have
been developed for the purpose of deter-
mining how materials under load deform.
One of the most recent developments is
the Tate-Emery Electric Strain Recorder
which automatically plots a stress-strain
curve while the material is being tested,
doing away with the tedious practice of
plotting points and "fairing the curve."
Also on display will be the latest electric
strain gages and recorders by which unit
deformation can be observed. This ap-
paratus will be set up in connection with
a weighing platform. As weights are ap-
plied to the platform a steel strap which
suspends it will be stretched. If known
loads are placed on the platform and the
corresponding deformation readings
taken, it will be possible to determine
any unknown load within the range of
calibration by simply noting the de-
formation of the strap with the electric
strain recorder. In this manner, any
visitor will be weighed free of charge.
Floating Beam Model
A ship is essentially a floating beam
made of elastic materials. If excited, as by
propeller forces, at special frequencies it
will vibrate very violently causing dis-
comfort to personnel and disrupting nor-
mal ship activities such as gun control.!
The general elastic motion due to near
misses of explosives and other loading
conditions may be shown to consist of the

motion. Theory will predict the means of
combining these components, but will not
determine the actual individual wave com-
ponents.
In attempting to learn better means of
calculating these components, it was de-
cided to build a model which could sim-
ulate the vibratory action of elastic ship
motion. The model acts as a check on
theoretical analysis. We create a vibration
of the beam by applying an alternating
force at particularly frequencies, thus ex-
citing the various components one by one.
A mechanism is provided to record these
motions.

Glass Block
An Open-House exhibit relating to
glass block will be presented in Room
1042 of the East Engineering Bldg. This
exhibit will include the showing of a
motion-picture, "Walls of Daylight," on
the development, manufacture and use
of glass block.
: A prismatic glass block is a material,
for use in all exterior walls of buildings,
that effectively admits light, from the sun
and sky, for the illumination of the in-
Floating Beam Model
terior without the introduction of high
observer brightnesses.
Many light-transmitting materials used
for the day-lighting of interiors admit
light primarily in downward directions
thus subjecting the occupants to disturb-
ing brightnesses of the sun or sky, out-
door objects or of the fenestration ma-
terial itself. Also, the admission of light
in this manner is inefficient in that the
light is absorbed by the floor, furniture
and occupants, which in most cases are of
necessity dark in color, before it can be
scattered by the higher reflecting surfaces
in the room, such as walls and ceiling,
for the provision of a well-lighted in-
terior.
The Synchroton
The major portions of the light trans-
mitted into an interior by prismatic glass
block is initially directed toward the ceil-
ing and the upper portions of the walls
for all exterior illumination conditions.
In this way the brightness of the fenestra-
tion wall, from the point of view of the
occupant, is substantially reduced and the
light is scattered from the upper portion
of the room thus providing a well lighted
interior free from high brightness areas.
Prismatic glass block possessing these
characteristics are usually used in an ex-
terior wall above eye-level. The portions
of the wall between eye-level and the
masonry sill can either consist of a flat
glass vision strip or a functional glass
block that has a low surface brightness by
virtue of its high light diffusion proper-
ties.
Synchrotron
The synchrotron is the latest and most
powerful type of atom smashing machine,
designed for the study of the fundamental
constitution of matter. The "bullets" used
are ordinary electrons. After first being
injected into the machine by a 400,000
volt electron gun, the tiny projectiles are
speeded up to the equivalent of
300,000,000 volts. They then strike a
target of more heavy material such as
tungsten. This collision results in the pro-
duction of extremely penetrating radia-
tion, which will be used to disnipt
atomic nuclei and to produce and study
the new cosmic ray particles called
mesons.
The visitor will see a ring shaped
electro-magnet about 10 feet in diameter
and weighing about 15 tons. The glass
tube about 8 feet tall and two feet in
diameter which stands on the magnet is
the 400,000 volt gun which gives the elec-
trons their start. The pair of triangular

condenser-rectifier stack which furnishes
a d.c. potential of 400,000 volts to the
gun. Lining the opposite (south) wall is
a bank of condensers (720 microfarads at
12,000 volts) which is used to bring the
power factor of the magnet to unity. It is
operated at 20 cycles per second. Inside
the circular magnet there is a doughnut
shaped glass tube which is evacuated.
After injection the electrons race around
this tube several hundred thousand times,

400,000 Volt Electron Gun and Power
Supply
gaining speed with every lap. This syn-
chrotron differs from all others in that
the path for the electrons is broken up
into four 90 degree curves and four con-
necting "straightaway" sections. For that
reason it is called a racetrack synchrotron.
Shock Tube
The shock tube is a device for produc-
ing shock waves and flows, in the labora-
tory. It consists of two long, rectangu-
lar chambers—a compression chamber
and an expansion chamber—separated by
a cellophane diaphragm. The pressure in
the compression chamber is initially
higher than in the expansion chamber.
When the diaphragm is ruptured, a shock
wave is produced which moves into the
expansion chamber at supersonic speed,
producing a gas flow behind it. The
speed, or the gas flow is a function of
the initial pressures.
A two-dimensional model in this flow
produces disturbances which vary with
time. These disturbances can be photo-
graphed, since they deflect beams of par-
allel light passing through the tube at
right angles to the flow.
The velocity of the shock for a given
initial pressure is determined from its
time of transmit between two stations in
the tube. Its velocity determines its
strength, which in turn determines the
duration and speed of the flow behind it.
Photographs are taken at one station of
the tube by triggering a spark at prede-
termined intervals. The spark is located
at the focal point of a lens from which
the parallel light beams then pass through
the glass section where the model is lo-
cated.
A photographic plate placed on the op-
posite side of the tube records the flow
disturbances. Photographs have been
made at Mach numbers up to 2.4 in air,
and at Mach numbers over 4 in other
gases.
Hi-Atmosphere Composition
This room holds equipment especially
devoted to a study of the composition of
the high atmosphere. In an adjoining
room steel bottles which were originally
used as oxygen "carry-around" bottles are
fitted with specially designed seals so that

High Gas Micro Analysis Equipment
samples of the upper atmosphere at a
height of approximately 40 miles can be
obtained. These bottles are mounted in
rockets which are fired at the White
Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico.
In this room there are also special
pumping systems to evacuate the bottles
before and after the rocket flight. The
first pumping system is built around a
mass spectrometer which enables one to
detect small leaks in the solder joints of
the bottles so the leaks can be eliminated.
The second pumping system is an all
glass-mercury pumping system which is
used to extract the sample of air from

Shock Tube
the bottle after it is recovered from the
rocket flight. Since the pressure inside the
bottle is only about one-thousandth of the
normal air pressure, a special mercury
pump had to be designed. A second
glass-mercury system is used to prepare
standard blends so that the analyses may
be checked. A third glass-mercury system
is one of two of its kind in the world.
It is designed to detect and measure the
amount of helium in the atmospheric
sample and represents probably the most
accurate gas micro-analytical method
known. This is readily realized since it is
capable of measuring the amount of
helium in ordinary surface air which con-
tains two parts of helium in about ten
million parts of air. This analysis system
works basically on the selective adsorption
of activated charcoal. Such an analysis en-
ables one to compute the amount of dif-
fusive separation of the lighter gases

Electrochemical Lab.
Today it is almost mandatory that every
consumer article have an attractive finish.
Electroplating is one important method by
which this finish may be obtained. How-
ever, electroplating is not used only as an
external finish for appearance and eye ap-
peal, it is used for many other reasons
such as corrosion resistance and electrical
conductivity.
In this laboratory, the student learns the
preparation of plating baths and their
operation. He learns to plate such metals
as copper, nickel, chromium and silver.
He learns commercial procedures and
applications as well as their theory. For
the benefit of those who will visit the
laboratory there will be several plating
baths in operation to demonstrate elec-
troplating.
Elevated Temperatures
Prominent among the activities of the
Engineering Research Institute are the
research programs carried on in the field
of high temperature properties of metals.
The widely publicized development and
use of turbo-jet engines for aircraft was
in large measure dependent upon specially
developed alloys able to withstand stress
and corrosion conditions at temperatures
of 1200°F and higher over long periods
of time. Other less dramatic but just as

turbines, cracking stills in the petroleum
process equipment in general. This pro-
gram of research in high temperature
metallurgy is an integrated program in
the sense that alloys are melted, cast,
forged, heat-treated and subjected to a
myriad of physical tests all within the
confines of the laboratories.
Chemical Service
The Chemical Service Laboratory is at
the present time engaged mainly in
analytical work on both ferrous and non-
ferrous materials.
The standard method for determining
carbon in alloys for the past several de-
cades has been to oxidize the carbon to
carbon dioxide, then to absorb and weigh
the CO2 thus getting percent composition.
In 1948 this laboratory acquired a new
piece of equipment which measures the
volume of the carbon dioxide gas, thus
giving a rapid and accurate carbon analy-
sis on alloys that run as low as 0.01%
carbon.
In addition to the two pieces of equip-
ment for determining nitrogen and carbon
already mentioned, the laboratory has a
refrigerator, two electric muffle ovens,
one drying oven, two microscopes, a
Duboscq calorimeter, and a sulfur-by-
combustion determinator. The laboratory
has on hand, or can obtain, all available
chemicals and reagents, including some
not readily available to the general public.

neering Research Institute to probe into
this comparatively new field. A machine
shop and two laboratories have been
equipped to design, construct, and test an
ultra-high frequency generator, the mag-
netron.
Unlike ordinary radio frequency cir-
cuits, the resonant circuit is inside the
tube. If we take a solid cylinder, drill a
hole along its axis and mill slots radiating
perpendicularly from the axis like spokes
on a wheel, each slot could act as a re-
sonant cavity at microwave frequencies;
the space across the slot would act as a
capacitance and the length around the
slot in the metal would act as an induct-
ance. In order for the cavities to oscillate,
a high DC potential is applied between
QQQ-'QQQQ
the filament acting as a cathode and the
hollowed cylinder acting as the anode in
which the cathode is inserted axially. A
magnetic field is impressed along the axis
of the filament and anode. As an elec-
tron moves outward from the heated
cathode, it accumulates energy from the
DC field and is accelerated toward the
anode. The magnetic field exerts a force
on the electron causing it to move in an
essentially circular path. The rotational
motion past the cavities transfers the DC
field energy to the RF field and this
energy conversion is continual until the
electron finally is collected by the anode.
Vacuum, heating, frequency, physical
strength, and tuning are a few of the con-
siderations governing magnetron construc-
tion. Component parts are joined to-
gether by brazing in a hydrogen fur-
tube is operating. Frequency is
by a wave-meter and the power output is
computed from the rise in temperature of
a water column acting as the load.

Aerial cable gets pro-
tective wrapping before
going underground.

A highway near Ann Arbor, Michigan, was being
widened. This meant that a telephone pole line
had to come down. But the cables it carried were
too busy and too important to be cut. They had
to remain in constant use.
Telephone engineers got busy.
Within two months, cables along the five mile
stretch were "buried alive"—with every circuit
in service all the time. Every inch of cable was
given a protective wrapping to make it suitable
for underground use. Streets, highways and rail-
road tracks were crossed. Work was done at
night to avoid busy-hour traffic. Yet not a single
telephone call was interrupted.
The skill and initiative of the telephone en-
gineer are important reasons why America has
the finest telephone service in the world—at the
lowest possible cost.

better mind her skirts, new look or not.
To illustrate to the visitors what a fun
house the lab really is, one of the power-
ful fans from the auto lab will be rigged
up to tussle with my lady's dress as she

Stroboscopes will be used on some
of the equipment to make the wheels
and cogs look as though they are
not moving and aid the newcomers in
examining them. Some of the machines
will not need stroboscopes since they
have not been capable of motion in years
but are only of antique interest.

screen
The screen on which you are accustomed
to seeing television is the face of an elec-
tron tube —on which electrons "paint"
pictures in motion.
And the size of the picture, unless pro-
jected, is determined by the size of the tube.
Working to give you bigger, brighter
pictures, RCA engineers and scientists
developed a new way to make large,
direct-view television tubes. They found
a method of "welding" large areas of
glass and metal. . . while keeping a vac-
uum-tight seal!
Using this development—ideally suited to
mass production—RCA can now build tele-
vision tubes of light, tough metal... using
polished glass for the face, or "screen."
An achievement of research
Development of this new way of making
television tubes is a continuation of basic
television research which began at RCA
Laboratories. Such leadership in science
and engineering adds value beyond price
to any product or service of RCA and
RCA Victor.

the designer can predict quite accurately
the characteristics that his ship will have.
The facilities of the tank are open to
any concern, either government or private.
One of the ships developed here is the
Wilfred Sikes, now under construction in
Lorraine, Ohio. When completed, it will
be the largest and the fastest of the bulk
freighters on the Great Lakes. It will
carry almost twice the tonnage of the
average freighter and will be 30% faster.
Another type for which research was done
in this tank is the Harry Truman inte-
grated tow barge, now in operation on the
Mississippi. With an entire fleet of these
vessels operating, shipping costs can be
reduced over 50%. These are just a few
of the many examples which show the
importance of the research work carried
on here.
One of the features of the exhibit in
this Open House is a ride on the tank
car while towing a model. This will be
accompanied by an explanation of the
various functions which must be per-
formed in making a test. Hanging along
the sides of the tank are models of vessels
which have been tested in the past. You
will undoubtedly recognize the names of
many of them.
Floating in the water at the near end of
the tank is a model for demonstrating
stability and free surface effects in a ves-
engine running on compressed air. It
demonstrates clearly the working parts of
a Stevenson linkage which controls the
speed and reversing of the engine.

ceiling are hung demonstration models
showing the flow of water around the
hull, the lines of the ship at different

examples of marine boilers, showing the
arrangement of the tubing and the gen-
eral construction. The remaining space is
filled with photographs and paintings of
famous ships.
Another important but relatively un-
known part of the department is the Ma-

izing in this work with the design and
construction of the power plant rather
than with the hull. Layout drawings of
the engine and fireroom can be seen on
several of the boards.
For students interested in small boats,
a course in small boat design is given.
Drawings of this type of boat are of in-
terest to most people because the vessels
that we come in contact with most are,
after all, small boats.

The physics display illustrates not so
much the engineering aspects of physics,
but, rather, engineering applied to make
possible phases of experimental physics.
The "glamor girls" of the display are
the much publicized cyclotron and syncho-
tron. These "atom-smashers" accelerate to
extremely high velocities fundamental
material particles, such as electrons, pro-
tons, etc., giving the physicist high-
energy bullets with which to probe the
interior of the atom and to bring about
fundamental changes in its structure.
Another feature of the display is a ma-
chine for ruling diffraction gratings. This
precision machine rules up to 30,000
parallel lines per inch on a glass surface;
the gratings produced are used in the
study of light.
In the first basement of Randall Lab-
oratory is the electron microscope. This
is basically much like the conventional
light microscope, except that a stream of
high-velocity electrons is substituted for

How to get a good
steer from a grader
To make motor graders easy to steer, and to carry
the weight of the front end, leading construction
equipment manufacturers use Timken® tapered roller
bearings in the king pin yokes. Timken bearings
carry the heaviest radial and thrust loads in any
combination, no matter bow tough the going gets.
TIMKEN bearings carry
both radial and thrust loads
From whatever direction loads may come, Timken
bearings can carry them. That's because Timken
bearings are tapered in design. There's no need for
special thrust bearings or washers. All combinations
of radial and thrust loads are carried with frictionless
ease. Shafts are held in perfect alignment, deflection
and end-play are eliminated.

JnL good mystery story is wonderful en-
tertainment, fine for relaxation. But for
downright imagination-stirring interest,
you can't beat the confidential progress
reports from Standard Oil's research cen-
ters.
For example, here's an excerpt about
one of the many products with which
we're now working:
"These new alkanesulfonic acids are un-
usually effective catalysts for a variety of
organic reactions, particularly where con-
ventional catalysts cause degradation of sen-
sitive reactants. They are non-oxidizing and
non-sulfonating, and are recoverable from
many reactions."
What does that suggest to you? Con-
densation? Polymerization? Dehydra-
tion? Alkylation? Acylation? Esterifica-
tion?
Yes, Standard's alkanesulfonic* acids
are of value in all these processes. We're
sure we'll discover other uses, just as
countless uses have already been discov-
ered for the hundreds of other products
we make from petroleum.

tactics in the past and recent wars, the
mission of the Infantry has not changed.
The Infantry Section is displaying
charts showing the recent changes in the
organization of the infantry division, the
various weapons employed by the in-
fantry, and charts and sand-table displays
of tactics, and the employment of troops
and weapons. Among the weapons in the
exhibit are the Garand rifle, carbine, mor-
ters, hand grenades, rifle grenades, light
and heavy machine guns, and pistols.
Ordnance
One of the ROTC units that draws
most of its students from the Engineering
School is the Ordnance branch. The
theme of the Ordnance exhibit is dual in
nature, one purpose being to display their
campus activities and the other is to in-
dicate their responsibilities as a member
of the armed forces team.
Artillery is represented by several of
the newer types of weapons used by this
group including a trench mortar and the
105 mm airborne howitzer. Representa-
things, equipment utilized in the inspec-
tion of gun tube interiors both during
manufacture and after firing. The latter
is to determine deterioration due to firing.
A portion of the automotive exhibit
consists of cutaway engine components.
Students from the trouble shooting project
recently initiated are demonstrating tech-
niques used in finding why engines fail to
start.
Quartermaster Corps
The job of the Quartermaster Corps is
to keep all units of the United States
Army all over the world supplied with
food, commissary equipment, and the uni-
forms especially suited to the climate and
the job to be done. The Quartermaster
Corps is exhibiting, as part of its dis-
play, not only the uniforms used by the
ROTC unit, but also various uniforms
and items of special clothing used in dif-
ferent theaters of operation.
Other phases of the wide field of Quar-

PROBLEM: You are designing a valve grinding
machine. You have to provide a drive for the chuck
that holds the valve stem. This chuck must be adjust-
able in three different directions. Your problem
now is to devise a method of driving the chuck which
permits these adjustments. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER: Use an S.S.White power
drive flexible shaft to transmit power to the chuck.
The shaft provides a positive, dependable drive
that permits free movement of the chuck in any
direction.
* * *
This is just one of hundreds of remote control and
power drive problems to which S.S.White flexible
shafts provide a simple answer. That's why every
engineer should be familiar with the wide range
and scope of these useful "Metal Muscles"* for
mechanical bodies.

It is charged with the receipt, transmission and delivery of
official messages by the means at its disposal. A Signal Center
organization is normally composed of a message center section,
a cryptographic section, and one or more operating sections such
as messenger, telephone, radio, teletype, and fascimile. A Sig-

any echelon of a headquarters, post, camp, or station, one or
more service installations, or troop units located in an area, or
any combination thereof. A Signal Center may be relatively
fixed or it may be mobile.

Variety of Equipment used by
SUPERIOR METAL TREATERS, INC.
Emphasizes the Versatility of &amp;/%$
VARIETY is one of the most characteristic features
of a commercial heat treating shop—variety of cus-
tomer demands and variety of equipment required to
fulfill them.
With a background of 22 years experience, Evan D.
Ehmann, President of Superior Metal Treaters, Inc.,
knew just what to look for when he established his
Newark, New Jersey, shop. This modern plant has
the productive capacity to cope with the miscellaneous
requirements of many customers.
Key feature of the installation is the versatility of
the equipment. Each unit was chosen for its ability
to perform under a number of different conditions. In
selecting this equipment Mr. Ehmann determined to
use GAS because, as he expresses it, "During my
years in this business I discovered that Gas Equip-
ment provided the accurate control, economical
operation, and versatility we needed. The precise
temperatures and speed of heating we obtain with
GAS mean a lot of extra production in our
shop."
Whether the heat treating process is a production-
line application, or a commercial shop operation, the
flexibility of GAS and the versatility ofmodern Gas
Equipment are important economic factors. The char-
acteristics of GAS make it stand out in any comparison
with other available fuels for heat processing.

of heat treating units, including 2 pot furnaces,
7 salt bath furnaces and 3 ovens.

Through the courtesy of Argus In-
corporated of Ann Arbor, a mock-up of
military optical instrument production is
being shown in contrast to their civilian
production. Optics used in time of war
are absolutely essential, for if you can't
see your enemy you can't kill him. Such
optical instruments as are used in time of
war are telescopes, binoculars, range and
height finders, and optical fire control in-
struments of all sorts.
During the war King Seeley Corpora-

Demonstration of Waterproof
Truck Engine Model
tion of Ann Arbor was engaged in the
production of the VT Fuze. This article
was second only to the atomic bomb in
secrecy. The fuze consists of a tiny radio
that is continually sending out radio sig-
nals. When an object enters this radio
field the signals bound back, activating
the fuze, and the projectile explodes. As
an example of its effectiveness, the anti-
aircraft artillery on the English coast
brought down 100 of 104 V-l Rockets
that came over the last day that the Ger-
mans sent them across. At the time the
fuze had been in operation only four days.
This fuze will be on display, and as
much of it will be shown as present se-
curity measures permit.
Another ingenious article on display
that grew out of the war was the space
heater. This heater functions on the
principle of the jet motor and is used to
supply heat to certain vehicles. It is also
used on some of the newer tanks to great
advantage. However, this heater has one
disadvantage—it is very noisy.
One of the very interesting exhibits is
the new sealed Continental engine that
can ran submerged in water. This is
accomplished by having everything seal-
ed watertight and extending the air in-
take and exhaust above the surface of the
water on the principle of the Snorkel.
Another feature of this engine is the fact
that most of its parts are interchangeable
with those of engines of different sizes.
The engine is being run in a tank of
water at frequent intervals.

The University of Michigan NROTC
Unit was established in 1940. It is one
of 52 similar units throughout the coun-
try, all with the same mission, namely;
"to provide by a permanent system of
training and instruction in essential naval
subjects at civil educational institutions
a source from which qualified officers may
be obtained for the Navy and the Ma-
rine Corps, and the Naval Reserve and
the Marine Corp Reserve."
North Hall, the home of the NROTC,
is easily recognized by the 5 inch naval
gun taken from the destroyer U.S.S. Endi-
cott, located in front of North Hall, and
the gun director mounted on the top of
the entry way. Inside the building are
located other naval equipment, pictures
of traditional navy subjects and the offices
and classroom for instruction.
For University Day and Engineering
Open House, North Hall is open for in-
spection and guided tours from 0900 to
1800 (6 p.m.). Student members of the
NROTC are conducting the tours.
Equipment will be operated by students
and officers.

guarded by the 5" naval gun.
Climb the accommodation ladder and
be greeted by the Officer of the deck.
Meet the messenger who will be your
guide.
Pass down the passageway viewing
medals, plane models, cruiser model, pic-
tures of old sailing vessels and into the
navigator's cabin. On display here are
Naval charts of various parts of the
world, a magnetic compass, sextants and
astronomy models. Return by the same
route and pass to the second deck. Watch
your step on the ladder.
On the second deck turn to starboard
(right) to Room 229 where you will see
flag hoists, 40 mm and 20 mm AA guns,
machine gun models and an array of
ships of your Navy. In an adjacent room
you can actually shoot at moving planes
projected on a screen from the gunnery
trainer. Retrace your steps to the central
passageway, then down to room 200
where you may view the intricate fire con-
trol mechanisms that control the director,
and the gun, and delivers the proper gun
ranges to the 5" gun. Mock-ups and
models will show the mechanical opera-
tion of various component parts of the
operating equipment.
From the fire control tower you pro-
ceed to the room containing equipment
used in the anti-submarine warfare.

Finish Exams?
The answer, of course, is never—not as long as he continues to
be an engineer. As an engineer, every problem put to you, in school
and out, will always test your professional skill and ingenuity.
The next step, then, is to make sure you'll always pass.
Today you're passing those exams with the information you're
getting out of books, lectures and the laboratory. Tomorrow, when
you are out on the job, the lectures and the laboratory will be
gone. But your engineering books will always be there, and to
them you will add the business and technical magazines devoted
to your special branch of work.
Many of the books you are using now and will use throughout
your career bear the McGraw-Hill imprint, for McGraw-Hill is
the world's leading publisher of technical and scientific works.
Pick up the writings of an authority in your branch of engineering
and there's a good chance they were published by McGraw-Hill,
for McGraw-Hill books are the works of the leaders in
technology and science.
In the McGraw-Hill magazine covering the industry you're
preparing for, you will find the news and reports on current
developments in your profession that every engineer and
businessman needs to keep posted. Editors of McGraw-Hill
magazines, for example, travel over 2 million miles a year to
probe for the facts and news they bring their readers.
For the exams you'll always have to pass—keep yourself posted
with McGraw-Hill books and magazines.

Another NORTON "FIRST"
THIS time it's a ceramic surface plate—an entirely new
type of plate for toolmakers and inspectors to use in
making their precise measurements. This Norton-developed
ceramic plate has distinct advantages over previous types
of surface plates including: (1) a longer-lived surface,
(2) a smoother surface, (3) a flatter surface and one that
stays flat. It will not warp nor deform, not sweat nor cor-
rode, not deflect under load.
The development of this unique surface plate is typical of
the progressive research that has made Norton an acknowl-
edged leader—not only in abrasives and grinding wheels
but also in the development of grinding and lapping ma-
chines, high temperature refractories and a wide variety
of wear-resistant materials.
In the Norton laboratories at Worcester, Chippawa and
Troy, there are 195 scientists, engineers and technicians
constantly at work on new or improved Norton products.

OUR HERITAGE
(continued from page 9)
Fifty-four years of development of the
College of Engineering as a separate
school in the University, have brought
the College into a position where it is
recognized as one of the leading engineer-
ing institutions in the nation; this fact is
exemplified by the breakdown of enroll-
ment which shows that about half of the
students are out of state residents. The
Graduate School of Engineering is the
second largest group of its kind in the
nation. There exist on the campus today
for the benefit of the students, chapters of
all the major professional societies as
well as honorary societies in the respec-
tive departments. The history of our
College does not end here, for it is con-
tinuing today to improve the standard of
education administered.
The College of Engineering today
seeks to fulfill its part in the responsi-
bility in the training of the engineer for
his position in society. The education of
an individual is a life-long process, only
part of which is acquired in college. In
the words of Dean Crawford: "Many
factors determine the position in society
of a professional man. Among these are
general education, breadth and depth of
a man's interests, and personality. The
College of Engineering lays emphasis
upon Economics, English language, and,
in addition, permits the student to select
general subjects to the extent of 1/3 of a
semester's work. The student is thus af-
forded the opportunity to continue to
build his general education which has
been started in high school, and if he is
ever to become well educated must be
continued throughout the years after leav-
ing college.
University graduates are supposed to be
leaders. Unless however, a graduate has
the desire to take the place of a leader in
a community, he probably will not do so,
although he may be a leader in his pro-
fession. Leadership in community better-
ment is found to about the same extent
among engineers that it is among other
University people. By such leadership I
mean governmental, educational activities,
etc. j|
The young engineer is, of course,
trained in the theoretical aspects of his
profession but lacks experience when he
leaves the University. This he gains as
he progresses from one position to an-
other in his chosen field. His University
has given him a firm foundation on which
to build."

The Gripes Poll which was held on
Friday, March 18 is to be followed on
May 9th and 10th by a Faculty Evalua-
tion Poll; the entire program being spon-
sored by Tau Beta Pi. The purpose of the
Gripes Poll was to aid in obtaining suit-
able questions for, and to stimulate inter-
est in, the Faculty Evaluation Poll, which
will be executed as follows:
During the last half hour of classes
on May 9th and 10th, a member
of Tau Beta Pi will distribute ballots to
each classroom, where they will be passed
out for your serious consideration in
rating your professors and making general
comments. They will be collected at the
end of the hour and sent to the Univer-
sity Tabulation Service for compilation
of results. The comments which you
make at the bottom of the sheet will be
detached and retained to give to each pro-
fessor and instructor along with the re-
sults of the tabulations, after final ex-
amination are completed.
Many excellent and justifiable criti-
cisms of the Engineering School in its (1)
LEE STEWART, '49E
methods of instruction, (2) policies, and
(3) facilities were disclosed as a result
of the "Gripes Poll" of Friday, March 18.
A summary of the general school crit-
icisms which are not applicable to a fac-
ulty evaluation poll is listed below:
(a) Too much emphasis on research,
rather than teaching ability in hiring and
promoting instructors, (b) not high
enough standard of teaching fellows
(should be given a course in teaching
methods), (c) honor system not given
enough emphasis and consideration, (d)
great lack of qualified advisors for fresh-
men, (e) serious deficiency of library
and study space, (f) not enough electives
provided for inclusion of cultural courses,
(g) some departments not up to date on
subject matter, (h) sections of one course
not standardized, and (i) undergraduates
and graduates not separated.
Gripes pertaining to courses and in-
structors have been incorporated into a
tentative list of faculty evaluation ques-
tions which are listed below.
Knowledge of teaching methods
Interest shown in subject
Interest stimulated in students
Logical presentation of subject
General conscientiousness
Consideration for students in class
Availability and willingness to
give individual attention
Value of course to engineering cur-
riculum
Extent to which exams measure
knowledge of subject matter
Adequacy of textbook
Promptness of arrival and dismis-
sal
Amount of work commensurate
with hours of credit
Fairness in grading
These or similar questions will be
used on May 9th and 10th, and each
question will be graded A, B, C, D, or E.
Please give these sample questions serious
consideration so that you will be able fo
vote intelligently when the ballots are
distributed in your classes.

OIL WELL SUPPLY COMPANY
PLAYS IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROJECT
m
\
^ "More than 4 billion barrel*"—that's what one person has estimated
as the amount of oil in one 30 mile strip in the Gulf of Mexico—scene
of one of the biggest oil exploration projects in history. More than 20
million dollars has been spent by several companies in leasing properties
on this newest oil province.
Oil Well Supply Company—a subsidiary of United States Steel Corp-
oration—is supplying many of the oil companies with complete drilling
rigs, including rotary drilling units, slush pumps, derricks, swivels,
blocks, rotary feed controls and other important parts of rigs.
Since 1862, when it was founded, "Oilwell" has been one of the lead-
ing suppliers of oilfield equipment. Not only has it pioneered many
improvements in equipment, but it has introduced many new types of
machinery and equipment.
This pioneering of more efficient and more economical equipment is
a most significant phase of "Oilwell's" progress. For back of all the de-
velopment work are the objectives to drill cheaper and to produce more
economically from any depth.
Opportunities
The fascinating work being done by Oil Well Supply Com-
pany, as well as projects being carried on by other U. S.
Steel Subsidiaries, requires qualified men in just about
every branch of engineering. If you would like to take part,
why not see your Placement Officer and talk it over with
him. And be sure to ask him for a copy of the book "Paths
of Opportunity in U. S. Steel."

JNIobody can buy a length of cast iron pipe
unless it has passed the Hydrostatic Test at the foundry.
Every full length of cast iron pipe is subjected to this
test under water pressures considerably higher than
rated working pressures. It must pass the test or go
to the scrap pile.
The Hydrostatic Test is the final one of a series of
routine tests made by pipe manufacturers to assure
that the quality of the pipe meets or exceeds the re-
quirements of standard specifications for cast iron
pressure pipe.
Few engineers realize the extent of the inspections,
analyses and tests involved in the quality-control of
cast iron pipe. Production controls start almost liter-
ally from the ground up with the inspection, analysis
and checking of raw materials—continue with con-
stant control of cupola operation and analysis of the
melt—and end with inspections and a series of accept-
ance and routine tests of the finished product.
Members of the Cast Iron Pipe Research Associa-
tion have established and attained scientific standards
resulting in a superior product. These standards, as
well as the physical and metallurgical controls by
which they are maintained, provide assurance that

new

where it will lead nobody knows
Soon it will be possible for you to step into
your home or office and turn on a light
that's different from any you've ever used
before.
From a panel in the ceiling will come
even, glareless rays to shine on your desk,
your chair, your table—but never with un-
comfortable brightness, never in your eyes.
The light itself will come from electric
bulbs or tubes like those you use now. But
it will behave far differently because it will
shine through a '/8-inch sheet of a new kind
of glass—Fota-lite—a recent development
of Corning Glass Works.
Formed inside this sheet is a crisscross
pattern of strips of white glass extending
through the full thickness of the glass. The
squares enclosed by the white strips are
crystal clear.
Light from the bulb above—shining
through this patterned glass at slantwise
angles—is diffused and causes no glare.You
get an even, soft light through the entire
room—as well as light channeled directly
downward through the clear squares to the
objects you need to see closely.
This new glass is made by mixing small
amounts of rare metals in with the sand
before it is melted to form glass. These ma-
terials make the whole sheet of glass photo-
sensitive—through and through—so that
any desired design (such as the one men-
tioned) may be formed inside the glass by
a special process.
In fact, similar photo-sensitive glass is cur-
rently being used to print photographs in
glass—pictures that can last for thousands
of years.
Use of Fota-lite for indoor lighting is its
first industrial application. Many other ap-
plications—such as its use in instrument
panels for cars, in street lighting, and in il-
luminated signs—are being thoroughly ex-
plored.
In 98 years of glass-making Corning has
developed glass into one of the most versa-
tile engineering materials there is. There are
more than 50,000 glass formulas on file at
Corning, and the number is growing con-
tinually as new developments such as this
photo-sensitive glass come out of the labo-
ratory.
That's a good thing for you to remember.
For some day, when you've picked the
business you want to work in, one of these
glass developments—or one now in the re-
search stage—may be just the material
you'll be looking for to improve a product
or a process.

by
DAVID PETERSON, '49Aero.
There has been much said and written
in the last three years about the possibility
of utilizing the vast amount of energy re-
leased by nuclear fission to operate the
engines of powerplants, ships and loco-
motives. The reason for the selection of
large engines is the belief that the heavy
shielding required by an atomic powered
engine would limit it to very large install-
ations.
However, due to the high cost of both
the fuel and the operation of an atomic
engine as compared with current fuels and
engines, it is at present impractical to use
atomic power for these purposes. Let us
look, then, to applications which have a
high premium on performance rather than
expense. Let us look especially toward
accomplishments of which conventional
engines are incapable, rather than merely
duplicating results now obtainable. The
application to high speed aircraft fits these
requirements very well.
I
%

RANGE
Figure I
The airplanes that are now capable of
supersonic speeds can fly at those speeds
for only a very few minutes because of
the very high fuel consumption. Figure l
shows how the range of an airplane de-
creases as speed increases. For a given
flight speed, the gross weight increases
more and more rapidly as the range in-
creases until the curve becomes practically
vertical. This means that there is a very
definite limit on the range of an airplane
using conventional engines and fuel at
any given speed, no matter how large the
airplane is.
An atomic powered airplane would be
represented in Figure l by a horizontal
AUTHOR'S NOTE
The most extensive research being
done toward harnessing the mighty
atom for non-destructive purposes is
probably that being carried out at
Oak Ridge, Tennessee by the NEPA
(Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of
Aircraft) Division of the Fairchild
Engine and Airplane corporation.
Because of the almost unlimited pos-
sibilities of aircraft powered by nu-
clear fission, the Air Force has given
the NEPA project top priority.
Although most of the findings of
this project are top secret, there has
been some material released by Dr.
Andrew Kolitinsky, Chief Engineer on
this project. In this article I have
attempted to include all of interest
that has been released to date.

line because the gross weight is not af-
fected by range. To the right of the point
where this horizontal line intersects the
curve for a conventional airplane of the
same speed, the atomic plane will be
lighter than the other. More important
yet is the fact that for ranges greater than
those where the curve for the conven-
tionally powered airplane becomes verti-
cal, the atomic-powered aircraft is the only
possible one. It is in this region that the
atomic-powered airplane will come into
its own. With a heating value of forty
billion BTU per pound (two million times
that of gasoline), a few pounds of uran-
ium will be able to carry a large airplane
on almost unlimited distance at supersonic
speeds.
Several basic types of powerplants lend
themselves rather well to conversion to
atomic fuel. Since fission energy is re-
leased predominantly in the form of heat
they are all thermal engines. They are the
closed-cycle tubine, turbojet, ramjet and
rocket. Some thought has been given to
the direct production of electricity from
the fission process, but at present, there is
no known practical way of achieving this.
Jet Engines
A likely engine for aircraft is the
turbojet, shown schematically in Figure 2,
in which the combustion chamber has
been replaced by a nuclear reactor. Air is
taken in, compressed in the compressor
and forced through the reactor, where it
is heated by convection. It then expands
partially in the turbine, imparting enough
work to drive the compressor, and is
finally directed out the jet nozzle, impart-
ing the propulsive thrust.
Figure 3 shows the application to a
ramjet. This engine is probably the
simplest of all engines ever built because
it has no moving parts. Its principle of
operation is the same as that of a turbojet,
but since the compression is accomplished
by ram pressure no compressor or turbine
is needed. The main disadvantage of the
ramjet is that it requires a high speed to
operate at all. However, other methods of
propulsion could be used to get the air-
plane up to speed. The ramjet is very
effective at high speeds. Its maximum
thrust coefficient is at a Mach Number of
three, or three times the speed of sound.
It can operate up to a Mach Number of
around seven (about 5000 miles per hour
at sea level).
The air temperatures required by the
ramjet are very high and at the same time
it is very sensitive to pressure drops caused
by the internal flow resistance of the com-
bustion chamber or reactor. Then, since
good heat-transfer conditions must be
paid for by appreciable pressure drops,
the atomic-powered ramjet is not as sim-
ple as it appears to be at first glance.
Rockets
The rocket engine is the only method
of aircraft propulsion that does not re-
quire air as a medium. The conventional
rocket carries both a fuel and an oxidizer,
which are burned in the combustion
chamber. The hot gases of combustion are
jetted out of a nozzle, producing thrust. A
fission-powered rocket would require a
gaseous propellant, but, as shown in
Figure 4, instead of having combustion.

actor from a liquid to a gas at a very high
temperature and jetted out the nozzle.
It is logical to ask where the advantage
lies in using nuclear energy for a rocket,
since its endurance is limited by the sup-
ply of propellant, regardless of the prac-
tically unlimited supply of energy in the
reactor. The answer lies in the fact that
the specific impulse, that is, the pounds of
T=&amp;

thrust per pound of fuel per second, is
proportional to the square root of the
absolute propellant temperature divided
by the square root of the molecular weight
of the propellant. Thus the maximum
thrust is obtained by combining the high-
est possible temperature and the lowest
possible molecular weight of the fuel.
In a chemical rocket the high tempera-
tures are obtained by the combustion of a
fuel and an oxidizer, the resulting gases
being used as the propellant. The molecu-
lar weight of this propellant is necessarily
high because at least two atoms combine
to make a molecule of the propellant.
Thus if hydrogen and oxygen are used,
the resulting propellant is water vapor
with a molecular weight of 18. If nu-
clear energy is used to provide the high
temperature instead of combustion a very
light propellant, such as hydrogen, with a
molecular weight of two can be used. The
specific impulse of pure hydrogen at the
same temperature is three times that of
water vapor.
Temperature Problems
Many of the problems which lie in the
path of the practical realization of atomic
engines for aircraft are connected with the
high temperatures involved. Unlike the
conventional aircraft engine, high thermal
efficiency is not the primary reason for
wanting high temperature in a nuclear
engine. High performance is, however,
and high performance requires high oper-
ating temperatures. For instance, in a jet
engine a high thrust per pound of airflow
per second is required for high speeds.
This necessitates a high energy input per
pound of air, and therefore a high tem-
perature.
The temperatures required in this type
of power plant are not unreasonable from
the metallurgical standpoint, but they do
give rise to a number of other difficult
problems. One of these is protecting the
uranium in the reactor against corrosion
by the working fluid. Also, the radio-
active fission products must be kept from
escaping into the working fluid. One of
the major problems, then, is the develop-
ment of adequate canning for the high-
temperature reactor.
Radiation Problems
Heavy shielding is, of course, necessary
to stop the deadly radiations emitted dur-
ing the fission process. This means that
much of the weight saved in fuel must be
lost to shielding if men are to fly in the
airplane. In comparing the weights of
atomic-powered aircraft, the "engine"
component of the nuclear installation
would approximately balance a conven-
tional engine of the same output. The
weight of the reactor and shielding can
therefore be the same as the weight of
the fuel and tanks of the chemically pow-
ered aircraft without increasing the gross
weight. In some present-day long-range
airplanes this is well in excess of fifty
tons.
Shielding weight is influenced about
equally by two principle variables. One is
the size of the reactor which must be
shielded from the rest of the airplane
and the other is the thickness of the
shielding or more precisely, the mass-
thickness, which is the product of shield-
thickness and shield-density.
As far as the mass-thickness of the
shield is concerned, the amount and type
of material required to stop a given type
of radiation are known. However, the
best material for stopping gamma rays is
not necessarily the best when both gamma
rays and neutrons are considered together.
Also, as the rays pass through the shield
their character often changes. The gamma
rays are absorbed by electrons, which in
turn emit x-rays, and so forth. Therefore,
a material which is good for the inner
part of the shielding may not be the best
for the outer part.
Since the shielding is relatively thick
compared to the size of the reactor, the
apparent paradox holds true that, for any
mass thickness, the greater the density of
the shielding material, the lighter the
shield may be. If the density of the shield-
ing material is doubled and the thickness
of the shielding is cut in half, it is easy to
see that the volume is decreased by more
than a factor of two.
Some of the aspects of nuclear engi-
neering are rather unusual. The absorp-
tion of radiation follows an exponential
law, which means that a given thickness
of shielding reduces the radiation inten-
sity by a factor instead of subtracting a
fixed amount. That is, if two inches of
shielding will reduce certain radiations to
one-tenth of their original density, four
inches will reduce them to one-hundredth,
and so forth. Radiations encountered in
nuclear reactors must be reduced by fac-
tors of many billion before they are safe
for humans, so the shield has to be very
heavy.
A good neutron reflector may turn 90
per cent of the neutrons escaping from

the reactor, but this only does about 10
per cent of the job of reducing the neu-
tron escape to a tolerable level. Similarly,
a leakage of one per cent, which at first
seems negligible, might be a million times
enough to kill a human.
In spite of the many problems in de-
veloping an atomic-powered aircraft, one
should not take a dim view towards its
future. Although it may still be a few
years away, its possibilities and applica-
tions are tremendous. With an atomic-
powered rocket, flights to the moon and
even farther may be possible in a few
years. As to the military applications, the
possibilities are almost beyond the scope
of the imagination.
Although an atomic power plant for
aircraft has not yet been perfected, it can
be said that its development calls not so
much for new discoveries as it does for
engineering development. The chemists
and physicists done their part of the job.
It is now up to us, the engineers, to carry
on and develop this power plant and an
airplane that can utilize it.

TV Synchronizer
Practical use of a newly developed
method of extending television coverage
by reducing interference between stations
on the same channel is under way on a
full-time basis between the New York
and Washington television stations of the
National Broadcasting Company, and be-
tween NBC stations in Cleveland and
Detroit.
The new method, known as television
carrier synchronization, was described
in a paper on "The Synchronization
of Television Stations" by Ray D. Kell,
head of the Television Section of the RCA
Laboratories, Princeton, N.J., at the con-
vention of the Institute of Radio Engi-
neers at the Hotel Commodore, New
York.
Facilities of the Laboratories in Prince-
ton were used to inaugurate this syn-
chronization scheme, Mr. Kell said, and
the effect of these operations has been to
extend interference-free service to thous-
ands of additional viewing families in
the "fringe," or outlying service areas.
Permanent synchronization equipment
has been installed in Wilmington, Del.,
to reduce interference between WNBT,
New York, and WNBW, Washington,
and in Sandusky, Ohio, to cut down co-
channel interference between WNBK,
Cleveland, and WWJ-TV, Detroit. View-
ers in Trenton, N.J., have reported great
improvement in reception of WNBT, Mr.
Kell reported, and inquiries are being
made concerning the possibility of syn-
chronization of stations on other channels.
These operations, therefore, can be re-
garded as highly successful and point the
way to application of synchronization to
stations in other parts of the country
where the co-channel interference has be-
come a problem.
Use of synchronization permits a closer
spacing of television stations on the same
channel than is possible without this
method of reducing interference between
stations. It also enlarges the service area
of television stations, thus enabling tele-
vision to reach out and serve many more
people than otherwise could be served.
This is of particular importance to rural
sections since it makes possible service to
such sections which could not otherwise
be obtained.
The use of synchronization, he said,
will soon be extended to other areas which
are troubled with the problem of inter-
ference where two stations or more are on
the same channel.
Reduction of tropospheric interference
between television stations on the same
channel became an urgent objective of in-
dustry engineers after the decision of the
FCC last September to impose a freeze on
processing of applications for the con-
struction of television stations.
The interference, which occurs for the
most part in fringe areas of television cov-
erage, shows up on the screen of television
home receivers as moving horizontal black
bars, which may be described as a "Vene-
tian blind" effect. The interference is due
to characteristics of the troposphere, or
upper air masses, which cause television
signals to be refracted over long distances
with signals from several transmitting
stations being received simultaneously in
certain localities. The extent of inter-
ference depends on the strength of the
interfering signal and the difference in
carrier frequencies of the stations in-
volved.
The idea of synchronizing the carrier
frequencies to reduce the cross-bar inter-
ference was conceived. As the difference
in carrier frequencies is reduced, the num-
ber of interference bars diminishes when
there is no difference in frequencies, there
are no bars. ,
The equipment now in use between
New York and Washington stations of
NBC consists of two units. The first is
at Wilmington, the second at television
station WNBT in New York.
When the system is in operation, sig-
nals from New York and Washington
stations are compared electronically at the
output of two radio receivers located in
Wilmington.
Information regarding frequency dif-
ferences of the two distant transmitters is
carried as frequency modulation of a
1,000-cycle tone by telephone line to New
York. The frequency shift of this tone is
utilized to change the frequency of the
New York transmitter to maintain it on
exactly the same frequency as the Wash-
ington transmitter. The operation of the
system is entirely automatic and will
require little or no attention.
It was pointed out that a similar sys-
tem could be established, when equipment
is available, to synchronize any two or
more television stations operating on the
same assigned channel. There are 12
channels assigned to television in the
country at the present time with a total of
55 television stations using them. Sixty-
seven applications for construction permits
have been granted by the FCC, and 317
applications are on file with the Commis-
sion awaiting the end of the freeze.
Thickness Gage
Schenectady, N.Y., April 1—A new in-
strument which uses radio-activity to
measure the thickness of sheet materials
moving along a conveyor has been de-
veloped here by the General Electric Com-
pany, it was revealed today.
Known as the "beta-ray thickness
gage," the instrument bombards the ma-
terial with "beta-rays." They are high-
speed electrons which come from certain
radio-active substances. Source of the rays
used in the gage is the radio-active sub-
stance "strontium-90." The instrument
measures the number of high-speed elec-
trons passing through the sheet material
being checked. This measurement is trans-
lated, by means of a complex electronic
circuit, into terms of how much the sheets
being checked by the gage vary from the
desired thickness.
The gage does not come in contact with
the material it checks. Hence, engineers
explained, it can be used to monitor the
thickness of rubber, plastics, textiles, and
paper, as well as metal, without damaging
the sheets in any way.
The strontium-90 beta-ray source has a
surface of about one-half inch, and is en-
closed in a brass cartridge four inches
long. On one side of the cartridge is an
opening through which the rays pass.
The cartridge wall is thick enough to stop
the radiation, and the opening can be
closed when the instrument is not in use,
so that persons handling it are in no dan-
ger. Beta-rays have a very low penetra-
tion, compared with x-rays for instance,
and the radiation from the strontium-90
is slight, hence operators of the new de-
vice are easily protected, the engineers
said.
The thickness gage is capable of check-
ing metal strips moving along conveyors
from a rolling mill as fast as 1000 feet
per minute, and is said to be accurate to
within two per cent.
The detector for the rays passing
through the material is called an "ioniza-
tion chamber," and works on the same
principle as certain types of radiation de-
tectors used by the Armed Forces in

ANNOTATED BY
DAVID STEIN, '49ME

Professor Van den Broelc divides his
time between his faculty position in
the Engineering Mechanics Depart-
ment at the University of Michigan
and his widening of Man's horizon of
knowledge. His Theory of Limit De-
sign champions a new sense of value
in the theory of strength.
Formula IX (page 26) represents
the culmination of a lifetime of work
along a somewhat unconventional
path in the development of strength.
His latest contribution to the Duc-
tile Equilibrium Column Theory was
a lecture presented before the Royal
Engineering Institute of the Nether-
lands at the Hague. It is being
printed in English in the Institute's
journal, "De Ingenieur".

PROF. VAN DEN BROEK
[Annotator's note: — For years, the Euler column formula
has been criticized severely on two scores. One, P/A approaches
infinity as 1/i approaches zero — an obviously absurd result.
Two, the direct compression effect is not countenanced in its
development.
The Euler formula applied to a column having pivoted ends
(see Fig. 2) is _ ir2EI

where Pcr is the critical load (i.e. the maximum load) a slender
column can resist without jailing by sudden bending, E is the
modulus of elasticity, I the moment of inertia of the cross-
sectional area with respect to an axis through the center of
gravity of the area which makes I the least moment of inertia,
and 1 the length of the column.
Since I = Ai2 (where A is the cross-sectional area, and i
the radius of gyration), then the Euler formula may be written
as

, , „cr (critical compressive stress).
In this form, it is seen readily that the critical stress for
columns of a given material (i.e., a given E) depends on two
factors: the length, 1, and the cross-sectional characteristics ex-
pressed by the radius of gyration, i. The 1/i term is referred
to as the slenderness ratio.
The concept of an ideal column as treated here assumes it
to be prismatic, to be made of homogeneous material free from
initial stresses and eccentricities, and to be subjected to an
axial end-load only (the weight of the column is neglected).
Returning to the criticisms of the Euler formula, it is believed
by Professor Van den Broek that his development of the formula
presented below (Formula V) obviates both of the objections.
A first glance at these pages may tempt the reader to raise
his hands in helplessness; fortunately, there is no valid reason
for the engineering student to overlook this paper. Professor
Van den Broek has developed his material so that it is within
DAVID STEIN
the scope of the engineering student who has studied both ele-
mentary strength of materials and elementary integral calculus.
We have been given permission to insert material into the
text to facilitate the reader's comprehension of the develop-
ment. These insertions are in the form of remarks and proofs
(i.e., derivations) of statements given by Professor Van den
Broek. They will be enclosed by brackets which will serve to set
them apart from the original text.]
For eccentrically loaded posts (Fig. 1), the following formula
applies to the right of the neutral axis:

and thus we obtain

For a maximum value of P/A corresponding to the elastic limit

In Figure 1 the principle of superposition is assumed to be
operative, and thus e is regarded as a constant. In a flexible
column with an initial eccentricity e = O, another eccentricity,
A, develops at the mid-section resulting from the curvature
assumed by the column (Fig. 2). For such a column, Formula
I is written as
P s
A = I+%p (Formula II)
j The principle of superposition states that the effect on an
elastic body caused by any one of several loads does not influ-
ence the effect caused by another load, and hence the resultant
effect can be found by summing the individual effects caused by
each load as if acting alone. The principle is applicable to most
members provided that only small (elastic) strains are involved.
The application of the principle of superposition to Figure 1
is seen readily enough from Figure A, which treats the upper

forces, P, along the neutral axis (at the centroid of the cross-
sectional area) alters nothing, for their resultant effect is zero.
But now there is a direct compressive force acting axially pro-
ducing a compressive stress P/ A, and a couple Pe=M producing

a bending stress, — . The total stress is the sum of these two
stresses. By considering the two stress-producing effects sepa-

The Engineering Research Institute,
using the facilities of the Electrical Engi-
neering Department, has been carrying
out a magnetron research project for the
United States Army Signal Corps during
the past two years. In a previous article,
we reviewed the basic theory of magne-
tron operation and gave a detailed descrip-
tion of how the magnetron is constructed
in this project. In this concluding article
about the project, we will look at the
magnetron in operation, note the im-
portant characteristics, and see how
measurements are made.
Efficiency and Frequency Stability
Like other generators of radio waves,
it is desirable to attain high frequency
stability and efficiency with varying con-
ditions of load and input. The efficiency,
77, of a magnetron, excluding the cathode
loss, is expressed as the product of trie
electronic efficiency, 77,, and circuit effi-
ciency, T;r. These efficiencies are defined
below.
input power converted to r-f power
in anode block
Input power
r-f power transmitted to load
r-f power generated
Electronic losses are caused by electron
bombardment of the anode and cathode,
and circuit losses arise from the PR of
circulating r-f currents. Efficiency is af-
fected when the r-f voltage is varied by
varying the resonator impedance. Elec-
ALBERT FORMAN
tronic efficiency has an optimum value at
a moderately high value of resonator im-
pedance. A high impedance oscillator
raises the circuit efficiency since the cir-
culating currents are small. To obtain the
maximum total efficiency, a compromise
is usually reached between a high and low
impedance oscillator, producing the maxi-
mum value of y^. It is possible to
realize values of T/,, over &lt;)Q%, ?;, over
80%, and therefore an overall efficiency
over 70% in magnetron operation.
The magnetron efficiency is generally
increased when the load is increased, so
long as the r-f voltage is not reduced be-
Figure I
low the optimum value by excessive load-
ing. However, with heavy loading and
close coupling, the magnetron becomes
more sensitive to load changes, reducing
the frequency stability. A high impe-
dance oscillator is less stable than one
with low impedance as the load changes.
Due to the inconsistency of high efficiency
and high frequency stability, another load
and impedance compromise must be made
to satisfy given requirements.
Output
Power is fed into the resonant system
of the magnetron by the interaction of a
magnetically controlled electron stream
with the field of the resonant system. In
effect, this interaction transfers power
from the DC field to the r-f field. Part of
this r-f energy is dissipated in the form
of copper losses and the remainder is
coupled to the load by means of the out-
put circuit.
The output must have the two follow-
ing properties. First, it must act satisfac-
torily as a circuit element and transform
the load impedance into the proper value
inside the tube to give optimum efficiency
and frequency stability. Since the size of
the output element is comparable to the
wave length of the microwaves generated,
it acts to a certain extent as a part of the
resonant system in determining the fre-
quency of oscillation. Second, the vacuum
sealed output of the magnetron acts as the
link between the tube and the transmis-
sion line and must be capable of transmit-
ting the power generated.
Coaxial and wageguide outputs are the
two main types of output circuits used.
The former consists of a length of tapered
coaxial line, with the end of the center
conductor formed into a loop and con-
nected to the outer sheath. The loop is
then inductively coupled by inserting it in
the high frequency field inside the magne-
tron. Coaxial output is generally used for
the transmission of wavelengths over 10
cm. at low and medium power levels.
Waveguide outputs are usually used at
high power ratings and wavelengths less
than 10cm. The large sizes of wave-
guides that would be required at lower
frequencies limit their use. A waveguide
in the output opens directly into one

of the resonators and transfers the r-f
energy through a y4 wave or tapered
transformer section.
Modes
A series of coupled resonators, such as
those in the vane magnetron, may oscillate
in a number of modes, each characterized
by a different configuration or phase of
the electric fields. Another way of
looking at it is that the variations of
r-f potential, (the DC potential remains
constant) from one segment to the next
depends on the mode of oscillation of
the system. The importance of modes can
most simply be understood when we re-
alize that the electron motion past the
resonators transfers some of the DC field
energy to the r-f field, and this energy
transfer will be affected by the variations
of potential of adjacent sectors that the
electron must pass. The problem is to
obtain sufficient separation of the modes
so that the desired mode is the one ex-
cited by the electrons. Thus, we see the
advantage of the simplified mode struc-
ture of the single oscillating cavity in the
interdigital magnetron.
Cold Measurements
Cold measurements are made in a non-
operating magnetron to determine circuit
characteristics such as terminal impedance,
resonant frequency, and internal field
pattern.
Impedence cannot be measured at
microwave frequencies by voltmeters and
ammeters. It is a property of transmis-
sion lines that the standing wave pattern
on the line is determined by the terminal
impedance. The pattern is characterized
by two easily measured quantities: the
standing wave ratio and the position of
the minimum voltage point. The impe-
dance can be determined from the rela-
tionship of the two measured quantities by
using proper formulae or charts. As
shown in Figures 1 and 2 (Fig. 2 is a

Figure 3
movement of the wave, that is, it stands
still on the line. The minimum points, a
half wavelength apart, may not be of
zero amplitude, and the ratio of the maxi-
mum to minimum amplitudes is called the
standing wave ratio.
Field pattern measurements are made
with a rotating probe mounted axially on
a cylinder that occupies the space in the
magnetron normally filled by the cathode.
The current in the probe varies as the
motor-driven cylinder rotates, being pro-
portional at every point to the intensity
of the electric field at that point, and pro-
viding a picture of the electric field in-

Helmholtz Faranite, like many other
great men of our time, had a unique
family background which could hardly
presage the great contributions to civili-
zation he would make one day. His father
had worked for many years on an auto-
matic pushbutton slide rule with which
the user would be able to tell the correct
decimal place at the touch of a finger.
Toward this goal he strived with all the
energy of life, applying Newton's laws,
Hooke's laws, Boyle's laws, and his wife's
garter as an indicator snap-back mechan-
ism. Mrs. Faranite, a woman with a very
practical nature, didn't mind the appro-
priation of the garter, but she could never
learn to tolerate her husband's habit of
taking a cathode ray tube to bed to warm
his feet on wintery nights. Perhaps a
reasonable income would have made her
feel more kindly toward her husband, but
sad to relate, she was doomed to the mere
subsistence provided by Mr. Faranite's en-
dorsement of Lucky Gold cigarettes,
which he never smoked. The luckless
wife became embittered and plagued her
marriage partner constantly. This daily
bickering finally ended when Faranite the
Elder was laid to rest six feet beneath his
crossed slide rules.
In this happy home, Helmholtz was
born and raised. My friends who once
read a book by Sigmund Freud will tell
you that our prodigy's frustrating at-
tempts to find a harmless outlet, like tying
a charged condenser on a cat's tail or
sticking a snake across a spark coil, were
merely the symptoms of a complex neuro-
sis caused by childhood environment.
Helmholtz turned to scientific study in an
attempt to free himself from the cares of
civilization.
As a complement to his scholastic work,
Helmholtz became interested in amateur
radio. His greatest pleasure did not come
from the radio contacts he made with
fellow hams in foreign lands, but from
the Picasso-type interference patterns he
painted on neighboring television receiv-
ers with his transmitter during boxing
matches. Needless to say, our hero rapid-
ly became the pride of the community.
Helmholtz Faranite made three im-
portant discoveries and developments in
the field of science upon the completion of
his freshman year at college. These were

Editor's note: Mr. Faranite, the
world renowned scientist, is the inven-
tor of many devices that have played
an important role in raising the tech-
nological field to the eminent place
it occupies today. The author has
unearthed numerous revealing facts,
hitherto unknown, which should prove
interesting to engineers, physicists,
professors, high school students, in-
fants and lawyers.
slip-proof soap, dehydrated water, and the
Clozray lens. A few explanatory words
concerning the lens will be helpful to the
reader. It seems that our budding genius
used to become very annoyed when he
forgot which pocket in which pair of
pants he had placed his beer money. The
thought of losing precious moments
searching for a few measly coins prompted
him to seek a method whereby he could
tell at a glance where his money was
hidden. Helmholtz briefly reviewed the
works on light by Huygens, Maxwell,
Zeeman, and Hertz, concocted a few ad-
ditional theories, and proceeded to invent
a lens that would see through clothing but
nothing else. Not only was Helmholtz
able to find his beer money, but like other
great scientific inventors, he found many
additional practical applications for the
lens.
After the completion of his sophomore
year, the bright lad took up the struggle
of developing the automatic decimal-place-
finding slide rule. Whereas his father had
tried in vain for many years to perfect the
instrument, Helmholtz successfully solved
the problem in a few weeks. Two other
notable advancements were made in the
electrical field at the same time by the
boy wonder. First, there was the AC
battery, which was soon followed by the
DC transformer. The sage professors
beamed with pride upon this up and com-
ing young man.
The end of the junior year brought
about an avid interest in mathematics and
nuclear physics. In the latter field, he
worked tirelessly over a hot bangotron,
smashing protons and electrons. In do-
ing so, he discovered the true basic par-
ticle which constitutes all matter. It is
called the gremlino. Its charge is plus,
minus, or neutral, and has a varying mass
and density. All matter can be broken
down to this particle with the proper ap-
plication of 69 x 1015 electron volts. In
the field of mathematics, Helmholtz be-
came weary of conventional thinking. He
started asking himself questions. Why is
a straight line the shortest distance be-
tween two points? Why is the product
of any number multiplied by zero equal to
zero? Why is one plus one equal to two
instead of eleven? Tentatively rejecting
these possible fallacious concepts, lie
started an original analysis of how Alice,
of Alice in Wonderland, stepped through
the looking glass. The result was the
Faranite equation containing the octuple
integral. Essentially, the equation shows
the relationship between the eight di-
mensions; they are pinpoint, length,
width, depth ,and their looking glass con-
jugate equivalents.
Senior year was flying by. Graduation
was approaching. The university (he
affectionately referred to it as the "old
diploma factory") would officially recog-
nize his scholastic achievements in three
weeks. The senior class unanimously
voted that Helmholtz would be class cal-
lousdectorian because he had bigger and
harder callouses on his hands from his
loglogdecitrigpolyphasevector slide rule
than anyone else. Recognition would be
scratching at his door in three short

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

DONALD FORMAN, '47 E
As graduation approaches and the
young engineer begins to look for his
position, he may suddenly realize that he
feels hesitant about stepping directly into
a definite place in the engineering world.
He feels as if he would prefer to have a
gradual transition period from school life
to industry which will help him deter-
mine his best abilities. Industry seems to
agree with the student in this view, and
many of the leading manufacturers have
prepared training programs to fill this
need. It has been proved that an invest-
ment in youth today will pay dividends to-
morrow by furnishing well-adjusted and
more capable personnel.
I have taken part in such a program,
and so I should like to pass along my
experience in order that you may get an
idea of what one corporation is doing in
training its young engineers.
After being graduated from Michigan
last August, I went to work for Chrysler
Corporation as a graduate student in the
Company's Chrysler Institute of Engineer-
ing. There the program consists of two
years of varied work assignments plus
classroom studies. During this period the
student must write an acceptable thesis on
a subject of his own choosing. The re-
ward is a Master's Degree in Automotive
Engineering.
An advantage of this program is the
sponsor system. Each student is assigned
to a senior engineer in the corporation
who follows the reports of the student's
work assignments and academic studies.
Through regular contacts with his sponsor,
the student may discover his strong points
and also his shortcomings. He may find
out which fields he might prefer.
Incidentally, the sponsor system of-
fers an unusual chance for the student to
become a friend of one of the top engi-
neers.
The Chrysler School, preceded by a
two-week period of indoctrination tours
through various plants, begins in October
and continues until June. An hour and a
half is spent each day in class, while the
rest of the day is spent on the work assign-
ment. The classwork is composed of a
variety of subjects including corporation
management, advanced thermodynamics,
vibrations, statistics, and courses which
cover the design and development of
every part of the automobile. The text-
books are reprinted each year in order that
the latest developments may be included.
The lectures are usually given by the de-
partment head or senior project engineers
of the studied activity. At the end of
each lecture, questions and comments are
encouraged, giving the student a chance
to express his ideas as well as to learn the
reasons for past engineering decisions.
Field trips to the laboratories and manu-
facturing plants are also given in con-
junction with the classwork to give the

student an opportunity to view the practi-
cal side of his studies.
The work assignment is for a period of
three months. Assignments are available
in all phases of engineering from ad-
vanced research to the liaison and contact
work of the resident engineer. This gives
the student an opportunity to try all types
of engineering work and find out which
he prefers while giving the corporation a
chance to view the student's best abilities.
At the completion of each work assign-
ment the student is thoroughly rated by
his seniors. This rating is sent to the stu-
dent's sponsor in order that he may use it
in counseling the student. The student
also expresses himself on the work as-
signment. He must write a one-page re-
port covering his duties in the department
and giving his opinions of the assign-
ment. This report is also sent to the spon-
sor to allow him to compare the two
ratings. In order that the student may feel
at liberty to speak freely in giving his
opinions of the assignment, this report is
kept confidential.
I have found that after a variety of
work assignments I am better able to de-
cide which field of engineering presents
the greatest future. The experience gained
through these assignments has changed
my mind covering the type of work I
would like to follow. At least, after a
year and a half, the work-assignment re-
ports, class grades, and psychological tests
all add up to definite evaluation of the
student's abilities. It is about this time
that the job openings are surveyed and
every effort is made to furnish a perman-
ent assignment that will be satisfactory to
both the student and the corporation.
It seems to me that from the corpora-
tion's standpoint this program has proved
to be a profitable investment in youth.
From the student's viewpoint, I can say
that the combination of adequate pay,
varied work, and continued education has
made me feel much better prepared for a
future in engineering. When interview-
ing for your jobs, I recommend that you
give serious consideration to work which
can offer a program of this type.

PROF. A. O. FLINDT
Many designing engineers understand
the technical reasons behind the answer
to the question, "Why surface in surface
coolers?" We would like though, to give
you a satisfactory answer to this question.
We will endeavor to state in simple,
understandable terms why it is necessary
to put considerable air, or hydrogen,
scrubbed surface in contact with the fluid
passing over the outside of finned tubes
while water is the heat removal agent
flowing through these tubes.
First, let us take up the reason for de-
velopment of fin-wound seamless-tube
type air coolers applied to the aircraft
carrier USS Saratoga's propulsion equip-
ment, generators and motors. The U. S.
Navy's Bureau of Engineering was ex-
tremely anxious to develop, or rather
have manufacturing concerns develop for
them, closed ventilating systems for the
electrical machines which were placed
aboard the Saratoga when she was con-
verted from her former service. In the
first place, salt air is not good for the in-
sulation used on the windings of such
machinery, and in the second place, it is
highly desirable to keep all oil laden
vapors, dirt and other unwanted impuri-
ties, out of a closed ventilating system en-
closing an important piece of machinery.

PROF. A. O. FLINDT
After the expenditure of considerable
time, money and developmental effort, a
suitable fin winding machine was develop-
ed for the production of the extended-
surface tubes used in these air coolers.
Today, these surface air coolers are used
for Central station power plant generators,
Navy propulsion equipment and sub-

MA&amp;S AIR FLOW-KXXJS P0UND3/H0UR-5Q.FT FREE AREA

marines, cruisers, aircraft carriers, and
battleships.
A later development has been the
double-tube surface cooler which was
primarily developed for submarine pro-
pulsion equipment service. This was done
again at Navy instigation to provide "leak
proof" surface air coolers to avoid the
possibility of sea water getting into the
air stream being recirculated by the motor
and generator fans of this type of vessel.
It is believed that many of the industrial
users who are purchasing hydrogen-cooled
turbine-generators will in the future insist
on this type of construction, particularly
where poor quality circulating water has
to be used.
It is known that for forced convection
cooling where heat must flow through sev-
eral substances in series, that the follow-
ing equation holds:
1111 1
- = - + — + — +...+-
H h, h2 h3 h„
This means that the overall heat transfer
coefficient H, in Btu's per hour per square
foot per degree F—Logarithmic mean
temperature difference, can be no larger
than the smallest of the individual heat
transfer coefficients. For that reason it be-
comes desirable to increase the amount
of surface in contact with the gas on the
outside of the tubes over that in contact
with the coolant (usually water) carrying
away the heat from the inside of the tubes.
The surface cooler as now manufac-
tured by various concerns, usually has a
ratio of air-to-water-side-surface, of
roughly ten to one. The reason is that
heat transfer from a gas to a metal sur-
face is relatively poor compared to heat
transfer from a metal surface to a liquid.
Therefore, it is clear that by increasing
the amount of surface in contact with the
gas, we can reduce the size of the tube
bundle; we can make the cubical contents
of the radiator smaller, more compact, and
cheaper to do a certain cooling job.
Getting more into the details of what
an air cooler or a surface hydrogen cooler
does, in the last analysis, we find that a
coolant (usually water) is circulated
through groups of these tubes while a gas
is passed over them. As the cool water
heats up, the warm gas cools down as all

degree of cooling depends, of course,
upon three or four factors, namely:
(1) Temperature differences at inlet
and outlet.
(2) Amount of surface contacted by
gas and water.
(3) Velocity of gas over the tube bank.
(4) Velocity of water, or other cool-
ant, inside the tubes.
Tests showing the mass velocity of gas
through the tube bank vs. water velocity
in the tubes give heat transfer coefficients
in the neighborhood of 2 to 17 Btu's per
hour per square foot (of gas side surface)
per degree F.—logarithmic mean tempera-
ture difference, as can be seen in Figure
1. These tests were run on %" O.D. No.
18 BWG fin-tube bundles over a mass
velocity range of 0 to 13,000 Ibs. per hr.
per sq. ft. of free area (between the stag-
gered tubes of any row or plane) for
water velocities inside the tubes of from
1 to 4 fps.
A great deal of work has been done by
practical engineers in trying to correlate
test data. It is the author's experience that
at the start of the game one is apt to
make up his own empirical curves for
design purposes but will later attempt to
justify his designs by making accurate
tests. A typical design of a fin-
tube surface cooler requires that one
know some of the pertinent facts before
starting to plan the actual cooler. For in-
stance, let us take the case of a 4000 kilo-
watt, O.Spf, 3600 rpm turbine generator.
The generator engineer will advise the
surface cooler engineers that the friction
and windage, load losses and others, add
up to a total of 158 kw, which will be
rejected to the recirculated ventilating air,
thence to the surface cooler circulating
water. The required 10,500 cu. ft. per
minute of re-circulated air and the tem-
perature (104°F = 40°C) at which this
air is to be delivered to the machine after
cooling will likewise be stated. Further-
more, the generator engineer will permit
the cooler engineer to use a small fraction
(about 0.7" of water gage) of total dis-
charge head produced by the fans (about
3.7" of water) on the rotor of his ma-
chine for pushing air through the tube
bundle. The customer may in turn state
that the temperature of the circulating
water available for the proposed installa-
tion is 70 degrees F; for instance, and
that he wishes to use not more than 60
gallons per minute, and that the quality
of the cooling water is such that 10%
margin for tube fouling should be al-
lowed. Furthermore, the cooler designer
must fit his apparatus into the space
underneath the generator, inside the
foundation, or inside the generator, al-
lotted to him by circumstances. He there-
fore makes a study of what the particu-
lar customer has used in the past and then
decides he will provide a cooler with
either i/2" O.D., %", ft" or 1" O.D.
fin-wound internally cleanable tubes.
Proceeding with his design he will de-
those previously supplied this particular
customer and will fit his requirements,
suitably fulfill all the requirements of the
turbine and generator (or motor-genera-
tor) designing engineers or customer's
consulting engineers. It should be an inte-
grated design to suit the job at hand.
See Figures 7 and 8 for such designs.
In the case of a hydrogen-cooled ma-
chine, after a few designs have been
made, it becomes easier to design such
a surface cooler than the air cooler for an

Figure 8
cide that the allowable size of the cooler
is approximately thirty-two feet volume
and will be of one or more sections; and
further that the desirable active length
of the tubes is between 4'-0" and 5'-0",
and then he will make a tentative design.
Should this design not prove to have suffi-
cient margin, that is, excess of included
surface over that actually required, he will
try over again. Thus by a "cut-and-try"
system he will arrive at the size of cooler
he wishes the commercial people to quote
in his company's proposition to the cus-
tomer. Frequently this is not the final
design supplied when the machine is
placed on order, due to factors unknown
at the start of the proposition.
It can therefore easily be seen that
whether the heat transfer coefficient is 9.6
Btu per sq. ft per hour per degree logar-
ithmic mean temperature difference, or
10.1, will not be as important as making
a design that will fit into the overall
scheme so that a well-balanced size of
cooler for the turbine-generator and air
cooler arrangement is sold to the custo-
mer. Note that by well-balanced, it is
meant that the sizes of the various parts
making up the set shall be in line with
equivalent rated machine. This is because
the hydrogen cooler is included within the
pressure tight shell surrounding the gen-
erator so design problems are more often
than not settled within the organization
building the machine, i.e., the customer's
engineers usually do not have much to say
about it. Figure 9 indicates how a typical
hydrogen cooler was installed in a turbine-
generator set.
Looking at Figure 2 we see curves of
typical turbine-generator losses to the
cooler versus the machine rating in KW
of the driven element. The loss may vary
5% depending on the generator design.
Most of these electrical machines are run-
ning at 3600 rpm in order to reduce the
size, although some of the larger ones
are still 1800 rpm because of other con-
ditions such as are dictated by turbine de-
sign and station. Even though the peri-
pheral velocity at 3600 rpm is relatively
high when operating in hydrogen, the
windage losses are considerably less than
an air cooled machine. Hence, the heat
rejected to the surface cooler is much
lower and a higher overall efficiency is
obtainable.

Tear Shape
Contrary to popular conception, rain-
drops are not tear-shaped, and for that
matter neither would be tears if they fell
very far, General Electric Company
weather scientists said recently.
Instead of being symmetrically stream-
lined like a tear, large raindrops can
change into a "new look" as often as 50
times per second and can resemble a
variety of things, including pancakes,
gourds, peanuts, telephone receivers,
ducks, jelly beans, dumbbells, hot dogs,
caterpillars, and even human feet. Smaller
raindrops on the other hand often assume
the shape of marbles and footballs. These
resemblances are only a few of the mark-
ed deformations from the traditional tear
shape that raindrops undergo periodically
as they fall, the scientists said.
In a special study simulating raindrop
behavior, the G-E scientists developed an
instrument known as a "drop controller,"
in which air resistance was produced simi-
lar to that falling raindrops encounter.
Reversing the natural order, however,
the instrument caused a rush of air to
move upward against a drop of water, in-
stead of the drop falling against the air.
By regulating the upward air current,
a drop of water could be actually suspend-
ed for short periods of time, and the same
wind resistance conditions could be pro-
duced as occur when raindrops fall, the
scientists found.
In this manner, water drops were ob-
served visually, and more than 70 strobo-
scopic pictures were taken of their move-
ments.
The study was conducted and the in-
strument developed by Duncan C. Blan-
chard, new member of General Elertric's
weather research team, under direction of
Dr. Irving Langmuir, associate director
of the G-E Research Laboratory.
The study is a part of general investi-
gations into weather phenomena currently
being conducted under Project Cirrus,
joint cloud study program of the U.S.
Army Signal Corps and the Office of
Naval Research, in consultation with the
G-E Research Laboratory.
Blanchard, 24, a 1947 engineering
graduate of Tufts College, undertook the
special study as part of his training in the
G-E Physics Program for engineering
graduates. As a result of the study, he
became assigned to Dr. Langmuir's staff.
Periodic deformations of drops are ac-
tually oscillations, in each of which the
drop takes a new shape and then returns
to its original shape, Blanchard said. The
oscillations are caused by a combination
of the pressures exerted by the surround-
ing air and the surface tension of the
drop.
In larger drops, deformations are more
pronounced sometimes enough so to make
a drop resemble a pancake or a flattened
sausage. In cases such as this, the drop
may actually rotate as it falls in much the
same way as do the blades of a helicopter.
According to Blanchard, a drop about
one-third of an inch in diameter will oscil-
late seven times per second, while a drop
one-fourth of an inch in diameter will
oscillate 16 times per second. At one-
fifth of an inch in diameter, a drop will
oscillate as rapidly as 44 times per second,
he said. Smaller drops will oscillate 50
and more times per second.
Raindrops which eventually break up
apparently progress through various shapes
or stages of deformation until they assume
a shape similar to that of a telephone re-
ceiver with a narrow neck separating two
bulging ends.
In 89 per cent of tests made on such
drops, they eventually took this shape and
then broke at the neck, the bulging ends
becoming separate drops and the narrow
joining neck transforming itself into a
single small drop.
In eight per cent of the tests, the drops
exploded or shattered of their own accord,
and in three per cent of the tests, the
drops split into three equal size drops
plus one or two smaller ones, which orig-
inated from the narrow neck.
In a few instances, two drops joined
but almost immediately parted, suggesting
that when raindrops strike one another
and join to form a single drop, oscilla-
tions may cause it to break apart again.
Blanchard described his drop controller
as principally a wind tunnel producing a
vertical flow of air, The air stream is chan-
neled and controlled in such a manner
that drops injected by an eye dropper into
the air stream just above the instrument
will remain "floating" long enough to be
observed and photographed.
In order to determine drop sizes, cali-
brated eye-droppers were used in the ex-
periments, Blanchard said.
Onc-Way Antenna
Like a traffic policeman in a one-way
street, a new television antenna has been
developed which will receive signals from
only one direction at a time and will
greatly improve reception of set owners in
fringe areas which lie between stations on
the same channel.
Development of the antenna was re-
ported today by O. M. Woodward, Jr.,
research engineer of RCA Laboratories,
Princeton, N.J., at the convention of the
Institute of Radio Engineers in the Hotel
Commodore.
Consisting of an array of four eight-
foot dipoles in the form of a square,
with the opposite members eight feet
apart, the direction from which the an-
tenna receives can be changed by flipping
a switch placed near the receiver. Inter-
connection of the dipoles through a
duplexing network makes this one-way
effect possible.
The Woodward antenna is not an an-
swer to any and all antenna difficulties,
it was emphasized, but is designed to cut
down co-channel interference when the
receiver is located between two stations
and on the fringe of their transmission
areas and to reduce interference of adja-
cent channel stations where the receiver
is insufficiently selective.
Interference experienced in Princeton
between Channel 2 stations in New York
and Baltimore and between Channel 4
transmitters in New York and Washing-
ton has been largely eliminated by the
new array.
Many antennas now in use are not
equally effective in. receiving signals on
the low frequency band, 54 to 8 mega-
cycles, and the higher frequency band,
174 to 216 megacycles, Mr. Woodward
pointed out. Unless the low and high-
band stations happen to be ideally located
in relation to the receiver, conventional
antennas represent no better than a com-
promise and will not operate with com-
plete satisfaction on all channels.
Efficient reception on high and low
bands is achieved with the new device,
Mr. Woodward explained, by attaching
open-wire "V's" to each leg of the four
dipoles. This, in effect, "shortens" the
dipole, which is designed for low fre-
quency reception, and permits optimum
reception of high frequency signals.

It is evident that if the deflection, Y, of the column is allowed
to become smaller and smaller, the value of P required to main-
tain the deflection also decreases. The limiting value for P —
that is to say, the minimum value for P — is approached as Y
approaches zero. But then the column is virtually straight, and
the vertical distance between the ends of the column may be
assumed to be equal to 1. Thus, to find the limiting value for

Ingenuity scores with "Ping Pong Balls
//
Yoke Lifter
Important among recent additions to Bell telephone
apparatus is the V-3 Repeater—a combination of two
amplifiers used to give weakened voice currents a
lift" on long distance telephone circuits.
When the development of an improved amplifier
was initiated by Bell Telephone Laboratories, engineers
at Western Electric were asked to help perfect the
design for economical production in large quantities.
They contributed much to simplified design, planned a
new production line, new tools and techniques, new
testing equipment. Result: an amplifier 1/6 the size of
its predecessor, costing considerably less, and one that—
in case of failure—can be replaced in a matter of seconds.
This is another example of how Western Electric
engineers help make Bell telephone service the world's
best at low cost.
A novel use of plastic spheres, looking for all the
world like ping pong balls, has been made by
engineers at Western Electric — manufacturing
unit of the Bell Telephone System.
Formerly, when piece parts were immersed in
this 45-foot tank to receive protective coats of
chromium, the surface of the liquid foamed up—
gasses were given off—the solution was dissipated.
How to conserve the expensive chromic acid
plating solution was the question.
An ingenious answer was found by Western's
engineers—special ping pong balls" made of an
almost non-inflammable plastic. With some 10,000
of them crowding the surface, the solution gets
little chance to weaken itself by foaming up.

Engineering problems are many and varied at Western Electric, where manufacturing tele-
phone and radio apparatus for the Bell System is the primary job. Engineers of many kinds—
electrical, mechanical, industrial, chemical, metallurgical—are constantly working to devise and
improve machines and processes for production of highest quality communications equipment.

Why construction gets better all the time
Where roads were once built a shovelful at a time...
today mammoth earth-movers handle a ton of earth at a
time. Mobile cranes swing 20 tons at the flick of a switch.
Giant crushers grind 150 tons of rock an hour. Traveling
concrete mixers place entire batches as they go.
These are just a few of our improved powered tools of
today that do a better job of construction faster and easier.
They help provide us with critically needed new housing
and business buildings... with super-highways and air-
fields for safer, smoother travel. And these tools are ours
today because of better materials . . . and continuing re-
search.
Alloy steels, for example, give them greater strength to
resist shock and abrasive action .. . stamina to overcome
the strain of day-by-day speed-up demands. And modern
oxy-acetylene processes for welding and flame-cutting speed
production of these better products of better steel.
Carbon is in the picture, too. In the form of electrodes,
it's essential both to the production of alloy steels and the
making of calcium carbide . . . from which comes acetylene
gas for welding. Also, a chemical known as an amine pro-
vides a wetting agent for asphalt. . . speeding construction
by making the asphalt stick more easily and firmly to its
crushed rock base.
The people of Union Carbide produce these and many
other materials essential to today's belter building and con-
struction. They also produce hundreds of other materials
for the use of science and industry, to help meet the needs
of mankind.

THE RANKINE FORMULA
The most popular of present day column design formulas
is the Rankine formula. In his "Applied Mechanics", 1870,
he gave the formula as
__
al2
^2
(Formula VI)
In this formula the letter a represents a constant to be deter-
mined experimentally, and h represents the thickness of the
column.
In modern times the formula has become streamlined, and
the h is replaced by the radius of gyration /. This, of course,
requires a constant b which differs from a, but which is still
to be experimentally determined. As a result, a great variety
of Rankine formulas are in vogue at the present time.
P=_s,_
A~ blP (Formula VII)
The one thing to recommend the Rankine formula is its
correct form, since it resembles formula I, which is a rational
formula. This partial rationality of the Rankine formula is
sacrificed, however, by the fact that no matter what arbitrary
constant is substituted for b, the formula, for large values of
1/i, yields values greater than the Euler value ^ = j\-T\2- ^e~
A ('•• ')
strkting the formula by means of specifications to relatively
small values of 1/i, as is generally done, does not dispel this

A graph of this modified Rankine formula is shown in Fig. 3.
LIMIT DESIGN COLUMN FORMULA
Another column formula is the ductile equilibrium column
formula:
(Formula IX)

| Formula V is not new. It was published first in the Journal
of the Engineering Institute of Canada in December, 1941. Since
then, Professor Van den Broek has extended his investigations,
and in his book, "Theory of Limit Design", published by John
Wiley and Sons, 1948, he first presented formula IX. He
believes that, next to Formula V, IX is the most rational
(logical) column design formula in existence. For the present
it is untried and little known.
In formula IX, s2 = upper limit yield stress (see Fig. 4);

as used before.

Formula V is the most rational of the column formulas here
discussed, but even so, it is rarely used as a design formula.
Formula VIII is the most rational form of any of the Rankine
formulas. Yet, formula VII is the one most commonly used.
Formulas V, VI, VII, and VIII are all restricted to elastic
behavior of material. The elastic limit stress, s,, is their gov-
erning stress.
Formula IX is somewhat less rational than formula V, but
is definitely more so than either formula VI, VII, or VIII. One
of its good points is that it applies to columns made of semi-
elastic materials such as aluminum or magnesium, as well as to
steel columns. A graph of formula IX is shown in Fig. 3.
Figure 4 represents the initial portion of stress-strain curves
of mild steel and aluminum alloy. In mild steel, the stress s,
and the stress under which the material yields excessively are
substantially equal, and are of an order of magnitude of
36,000 psi. In 24 S.T. aluminum alloy, the elastic limit stress,
Sj, is about 30,000 psi; the upper limit yield stress s2 at which
the excessive yield of material occurs is about 53,000 psi.

Now the identity of "Madame X", the
unknown in a long search for tone per-
fection, has been revealed. From this
quest emerges a completely integrated
record-playing system —the first to be
entirely free of distortion to the trained
musical ear .. .
The research began 11 years ago at RCA
Laboratories. First, basic (actors were de-
termined—minimum diameters, at different
speeds, of the groove spiral in the record —
beyond which distortion would occur; size
of stylus to be used; desired length of play-
ing time. From these came the mathematical
answer to the record's speed — 45 turns a
minute —and to the record's size, only 6%
inches in diameter.
The record itself is non-breakable vinyl
plastic, wafer-thin. Yet it plays as long as
a conventional 12-inch record. The new
RCA Victor automatic record changer ac-
commodates up to 10 of the new records
— 1 hour and 40 minutes of playing time —
and can be attached to almost any radio,
phonograph, or television combination.
The record player ends faulty operation,
noise, and cumbersome size. Records are
quickly changed . . . RCA Victor will still
supply 78 rpm instruments and records.
This advance is one of hundreds grow-
ing from RCA research. Such leadersliip

Tuning
Tuning microwave magnetrons poses a
special problem. Unlike ordinary radio
frequency oscillators, the magnetron's re-
sonant circuit is inside the vacuum enve-
lope. Variation of the resonant frequency
is produced either mechanically or elec-
tronically. With the first method, tuning
is slow, but the range of tuning may be
large.
Mechanical tuning may be divided into
symmetrical and unsymmetrical classifi-
cations. The former method preserves the
angular symmetry of the operating mode,
maintaining a reasonably constant elec-
tronic efficiency at wavelengths remov;-d
from the original wavelength.
The project under consideration uses 3
method of mechanical tuning which con-
sists of varying the capacitance between
the elements of the resonant circuit. The
interdigital type magnetron has a single
resonant cavity consisting of two sets of
interspaced "fingers," one of which is sup-
ported from a semi-flexible monel dia-

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK
How to keep a hold cold
Both time and tuna are lost if the refrigeration
unit breaks down while a fishing boat is at sea. En-
gineers insure dependability in sea-going ice ma-
chine compressors by specifying Timken® tapered
roller bearings on crankshafts. Because of their
tapered design, Timken bearings carry any combi-
nation of radial and thrust loads. With Timken
bearings on the crankshafts, friction and lateral
play are minimized. Shafts are held in rigid align-
ment. Wear and maintenance are reduced.

Why does TIMKEN9 lead in
bearing design?
The tapered roller bearing was pioneered by
Timken and every important tapered roller bearing
improvement since has been introduced by Timken.
For example, Timken developed the one-piece
multiple perforated cage to insure exact spacing of
the rollers. And to provide positive roller alignment,
Timken introduced wide area contact between the
roll ends and the ribs. For almost fifty years this
leadership in design has helped make Timken
bearings first choice with engineers in every field.

capacitance of the r-f circuit.
Electronic tuning permits rapid fre-
quency change over a small range, lend-
ing itself conveniently to frequency modu-
lation. The University of Michigan
electron tube laboratory is conducting re-
search on the use of a magnetron diode
with sharp cut-off to modulate the r-f
oscillations. The diode, which develops
negligible r-f energy, is employed as a
reactance tube and incorporated in the
resonant circuit of the oscillating inter-
digital magnetron, as shown in Fig. 6.
A modulated increase of plate voltage on
the diode changes the reactance coupled
to the oscillating magnetron by increasing
the diameter of the cathode space charge.
The result is a change in the radio fre-
quency of oscillation. The magnitude of
frequency deviation expected is about
20 mc.

weeks. And then it happened. The event
that would affect the lives of millions of
people.
He fell in love. The girl, Dyne, was
extraordinarily well polished. At the uni-
versity, she became learned in the cultures
of Etruria, Mandan, Inca and Nootka.
And she was attractive. I would even have
called her beautiful had she had teeth.
Helmholtz loved her madly, and one day
in a fit of passion, he told her that if she
didn't return his love, he would end it
all in a torsion testing machine. But Dyne
loved him too, and with a few tender
words, gently set his mind at ease.
Our hero went to bed that night with a
glowing love for humanity. He thought
of Dyne and thought of humanity. What
misery did his fellow human beings suffer
that he alone could alleviate? Helmholtz
wanted to do something for humanity, but
the problem was to choose the greatest
misery to obliterate.
When he awoke the next morning, the
solution was well in hand. How could
he have been so blind? Obviously, the
greatest misery of all was homework. Very
well then, he would invent a homework
machine.
He slaved feverishly at the project. Not
for one moment did he take his mind off
the problem. When he drank coffee, he
mentally computed the rate of liquid flow.
Even when our busy man went to see
Dyne, he didn't take his mind off the
problem for one second. When he held
her hand, he thought of eccentric gears.
When he hugged her, he thought of
fourth order fifth degree differential equa-
tions. When he kissed her, he thought
of free body diagrams. I repeat, not for
one moment did he take his mind off the
problem.
After one week, his labors began to
show results. The machine could make
fine drafting plates, write concise book
reports, and compute all calculus prob-
lems and chemical reactions. Another
week passed, and now the machine was
able to compute the equation of any
mechanical action, the numerical value of
any component in an electrical circuit, the

graduation day, one week later, the ma-

"A" work on any homework the instruc-
tors could possibly assign.
Thousands of these machines were
manufactured at a reasonable cost. The
students pressed a button, their homework
was done, and they had all the free time
they wanted to drink beer. The profes-

read books or work on a pet research
problem. Factories opened to produce
the greatest machine ever invented. Busi-
ness boomed. All workers had good jobs.
The millenium! Utopia!
But alas! There was a vital flaw. After
two years of operation, strange rays
started to emanate from the machines.
The rays proved fatal to all who came in
contact with them. All the machines had
to be destroyed to save civilization.
Helmholtz never learned of this sad
turn of events. The strain of excessive
work had taken its toll the previous year,

OF THE BASIC INDUSTRY
OF YOUR CHOICE!
by R. S. FLESHIEM
Manager Electrical Department
ALLIS-CHALMERS MANUFACTURING CO.
(Graduate Training Course—1904)

R. S. FLESHIEM
When you get into daily working
contact with an industry, you may
find it offers specialized opportunites that
you hadn't known
about before. That's
why it's not always
possible—or wise—
to pick your final spot
in industry until
you've had some all
around first-hand
experience.
I want to suggest
a good way to get a
close-up of the industries that appeal
to you.
Naturally, I can talk with most assur-
ance about the electric power industry.
But the same principles apply to others.
When I got my engineering degree
from the University of Michigan, the
electric power industry was a fast-grow-
ing youngster. I decided to go to Allis-
Chalmers, where I joined the company's
first Graduate Training Course in 1904.
I was sent to Cincinnati and started in the
old Bullock Electric Mfg. Co. plant that
Allis-Chalmers had purchased that same
year. Bullock, incidentally, started in
1884—one of the real old-timers in the
electric industry. It was the start of the
present Allis-Chalmers Electrical
Department.
Opportunities Are Increasing
The industry was growing fast at the turn
of the century, but it's growing even
faster now. Opportunities were never
greater—or more varied.

Studying power and capacity factors in
ore crushing, in Allis-Chalmers' complete
basic industries laboratory. Camera-re-
corded data will be applied to commercial
mining operations.

Inside View of a hydrogen-cooled steam-turbine generator. A-C Graduate Training Course
students may follow important electric power equipment from blueprint to installation.
Today we have Graduate Training
Course engineers applying their ability
and training to the problems of machine
design—research and development—
manufacturing and production—sales-
application engineering. Here we're
working with electric power generation,
control and utilization—with advanced
industrial uses of electronics—with re-
search in D. C. transmission. We're in
intimate touch with the electric power
industries—with transportation—with
steel, metal working and other big power
users. And I know that the field is just as
broad in the other major industry depart-
ments here at Allis-Chalmers.
What Industry Interests You?
I firmly believe that Graduate Training
Course engineers have a unique oppor-
tunity at Allis-Chalmers. They have the
opportunity here to explore thoroughly
not one, but many basic industries if
they choose. This company produces the
world's widest range of major industrial
equipment, and every department is open
to the graduate engineer. That includes
electric power, mining and ore reduc-
tion, cement making, public works,
steam turbines, pulp and wood process-
ing. It also includes the full range of
activities within each industry: design,
manufacturing, sales, research, applica-
tion, advertising.
Graduate students help plan their own
courses at Allis-Chalmers, and they move
around a good deal. It's possible for a
man to come here with the idea of de-
signing electrical equipment—later be-
come interested in manufacturing—and
finally find his greatest satisfaction and
success in sales work. Men move from
department to department, getting a
practical working knowledge of each.
And—the departments get to know the
men. Opportunities present themselves
according to ability.
At the completion of the Graduate
Training Course, you've had a close-up
of many industries. You're ready to take
your place in the work of your choice.
Write for details of the Allis-Chalmers Graduate Training Course—requirements,
salary, advantages. Representatives may visit your school. Watch for date.

Another reason that a hydrogen cooler
can be made smaller than an air cooler is
that we obtain much better overall heat
transfer coefficients in passing hydrogen
gas over a fin-tube bundle. Customers
are, of course, willing to pay extra to get
the more efficient machine as the fixed
charges for the power plant will not vary
greatly. Incidentally, the hydrogen cooler
comes as an integral part of the machine.
A great deal of developmental testing
was done during the years of 1936 to
1940 to ascertain comparative heat trans-
fer coefficients between an "air blown"
bundle of fin tubes and a "hydrogen-
blown" bundle of fin tubes. It was deem-
ed necessary to place the apparatus for re-
circulating hydrogen over a cooler section
in a testing pit for safety. At first the
system was run with room ambient air
and rather muddy Mohawk River cooling
water. Heat transfer coefficients were ob-
tained using 1" O.D. No. 18 BWG tube
wound with 9 fins per lineal inch. The
water velocities were varied from y2 to 6
or 7 fps. Then the same commercial size
cooler section was tested with hydrogen
in the tightly closed recirculating duct

Hydrogen Cooled Turbine Generator
work system where a fan pushed varying
amounts of gas over the surface cooler
section and "Calrod" sheathed electric
heating elements were used to provide the
"load." Considerable care was used to
calibrate the instruments to maintain al-
most 99% hydrogen purity and to regu-
late the velocity of water in the cooler
tubes over a range in order to show the
effect of this velocity on overall heat
transfer. Later similar tests were made on
24" and %" O.D. fin-wound tubes, some
of which had 7 fins per inch, others 8 fins
per inch and others 9 to 10 fins per lineal
inch of tube. The results of these tests
were very carefully calculated, coefficients
were cross-plotted on curve sheets and a

PROBLEM—You have an aircraft radio receiver.
To operate it, the band selector and tuning elements
must be adjusted. You want to arrange it so that
these adjustments can be made right at the receiver
or from a remote point. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—Use S.S.White remote
control flexible shafts to connect the tuning dials
on the receiver to tuning cranks on a remote control
unit. This arrangement leaves you free to mount the
control unit anywhere you want, and assures you
of smooth, sensitive tuning from any distance up
to 50 feet or more. The shafts can be readily run
around turns, along walls, under flooring as condi-
tions in different aircraft may require. Any required
degree of sensitivity can be obtained by connecting
the shaft through simple gearing.

This is just one of hundreds of
remote control and power drive
problems to which S.S.White
flexible shafts provide a simple
answer. That's why every engi-
neer should be familiar with the
range and scope of these "Metal

transfer coefficients were obtainable when
cooling hydrogen instead of air in the
same testing "set-up." The results of
these tests can be easily verified.
Until recently the problem of heat
transfer to fluids in streamline flow has
received little attention because in most
industrial applications the flow is turbu-
lent. Within the past few years we have
seen reports of theoretical and experimen-
tal studies of heat transfer to viscous
liquids in tubes. It has been shown that
the purely theoretical formulae are not
verified quantitatively by the experimen-
tal data. Further, no method has been
developed for satisfactorily correlating the
results obtained by all of these investiga-
tors. It is known that the heat transfer is
affected by the length and the diameter
of the pipe and specific heat and conduc-
tivity of the liquid and the mass rate of
flow, but the proper grouping of these
variables apparently has not been found.
The indications are that the effect of the
temperature difference in producing veloc-
ity gradients and in setting up free-con-
vection currents should be taken into ac-
count in some way.
It is necessary to refer to the dimension-
less units giving the Reynolds' number
for the velocity which obtains in our
cooler in order to determine whether we
have turbulent flow or streamline flow of
the coolant inside the tubes, and similarly
whether we have turbulent flow of fluid
passing over the fins on the outside of the
tubes.

For Students of Science and

Engineering
TEN UNIVERSITIES TO BENEFIT BY GRANTS
FOR UNRESTRICTED FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH
With a view to stock-piling basic
knowledge, the Du Pont Company
has announced a program of grants-
in-aid for the college year 1949-50 to
10 universities for unrestricted
use in the field of fundamental re-
search in chemistry.
The grants-in-aid of $10,000 each
are to be used for research that has
no immediate commercial goal. The
universities themselves are to select
the projects in which the grants will
be employed, and results of the re-
search are to be freely available for
publication.
HOW FUNDS WILL BE USED
Du Pont's purpose in offering the
grants is to help insure the flow of
fundamental knowledge in science
upon which the future industrial de-
velopment of our country is so de-
pendent. It is intended that the funds
be utilized for such expenses as em-
ploying additional research personnel
or lightening the teaching load of a
professor who is eminently capable
of research of a high order. They
may also be expended for the pur-
pose of obtaining supplies, appara-
tus or equipment.
GRANTS ARE EXPERIMENTAL
This program of grants-in-aid is
largely experimental. However, it is
Du Pont's hope, should the program
work out -satisfactorily, to continue
each grant for a period of five years.

MADE AVAILABLE
TO GRADUATE STUDENTS
Again in the academic year 1949-50,
the Du Pont Company is awarding
post-graduate and post-doctorate fel-
lowships to universities throughout
the country.
This is a continuation of the com-
pany's 30-year-old plan to encourage
advanced studies in the fields of chem-
istry, physics, metallurgy, and engi-
neering.

them, as in past years, may come to
work for Du Pont when they finish
their studies, but there is no obligation
to do so; fellowship holders are free to
enter any field of activity they choose.
The students and their research
subjects will be selected by authori-
ties of the 47 universities participating.
In this year's program, 45 of the post-
graduate fellowships are in chemistry,
4 in physics, 15 in chemical engineer-
ing, 5 in mechanical engineering and 2
in metallurgy. There will be 6 post-
doctoral fellowships as an incentive to
those who would prefer to remain in
academic work in order to obtain addi-
tional advanced training in chemistry.

cooler fin-tubes. Reynolds' number is a
dimensionless unit. For high mass velocity
turbulence will exist, and for high Rey-
nolds' number we get high heat transfer,
relatively speaking.
Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 indicate how to
determine the Logarithmic Mean Differ-
ence (-) in degrees F. which effects the heat
transfer with cooler terminal temperature
difference of 0, and f-)..,. These are for
the cases usually encountered in heat
transfer work. This 0 is "heat-head" to
effect heat transfer.
For some machines special designs have
to be made. For instance, for synchronous
condensers, water wheel generators, steel
mill motors, submarine propulsion motors,
and generators and allied equipment,
special air cooler designs are usually made
and quoted with the main apparatus to
the individual customers. A great num-
ber of the TVA water wheel generators
are equipped with vertical tube multi-sec-
tion surface air coolers made by producers
of water-wheel generators. Invariably the
number of sections required was made to
suit the generator design, and of course,
the cooling water temperatures at the sta-
tion sites.
In the case of the patented double-tube
surface air cooler (originally designed for
the U. S. Navy submarine propulsion mo-
tors and generators) allowance had to be
made in the overall heat transfer coeffi-

mitted "closer" designs than the first
employed. Then tools were developed for
assuring a positive contact between the
lands and the inner tube periphery, such
that the overall heat transfer coefficient
was only slightly below that obtainable
with a plain single fin-wound tube for
given air mass flow and water velocity.
There must be adequate "force-fit" con-
tact between the two tubes to obtain good

duction machinery to these highly technical processes,
utilizing flexible GAS for all heating requirements.
As large users of fuel, Kopp executives are concerned
with the operating economies made possible by effective
utilization of GAS in modern Gas-fired Equipment. But
equally important is the automatic controllability of
GAS for the varying temperatures used for melting, an-
nealing, tempering, mould heating, in this specialized
glass business. The importance of GAS in the Kopp
plants is stressed by the wide range of equipment using
this efficient fuel—

type of operation. That's why we use every device for
effective utilization of GAS."
You'll find it worthwhile to investigate modern Gas

MANY thousands of the products which serve us so faithfully in our
home lives, in college and in business — such as the refrigerator,
the automobile, the airplane, the machines in office, laboratory and
plant —owe their dependability and long life to the accuracy of
grinding. Many have parts ground to limits as fine as a tenih of a
thousandth of an inch (one thirtieth the thickness of this magazine
page) by Norton grinding machines and Norton grinding wheels.
And many parts are still further refined, both for accuracy and
surface finish, by Norton lapping machines. The work turned out on
a production basis by these unique Norton machines is measured in
millionths of an inch — must be gauged by complicated optical instru-
ments making use of light rays.
When industry has a production

or both, it turns to Norton . .. for
Norton has a large and capable

For many years, ADVERTISEMENTS SUCH
THIS ONE have appeared regularly in leading
business magazines. Their primary purpose is
fo build acceptance for Square D Field Engineers,
practically all of whom come fo us from
leading engineering schools such as yours.
A sample from every industry served by Square D
Field Engineers would make quite a load, indeed.
For these men serve as liaison between Square D
and every segment of industrial America. Their
full-time job is working with industries of every
kind and size—helping find that "better way
to do It."
Through these Field Engineers, located in more
than 50 offices in the United States, Canada and
Mexico, Square D does its three-fold job: Designs
and builds electrical distribution and control equip-
ment in pace with present needs—provides sound
counsel in the selection of the right equipment for
any given application—anticipates trends and new
methods and speeds their development.
If you have a problem in electrical distribution
or control, call in the nearby Field Engineer. He'll
help a lot in finding a "better way to do it."

and theoretical side of technical studies.
A complaint that I have heard many times
is the lack of practical courses—the lack
of something that would bring about a
closer relationship with the engineering
field. We do have bi-monthly engineer-
ing lectures, engineering societies whose
purpose is to circulate technical informa-
tion, and certain classes and labs. But
these means all lack the direct contact of
visiting factories and seeing manufactur-
ing processes. Some societies have a pro-
gram of inspection trips but most stu-
dents are not able to participate because
of conflicting classes and activities.
"If a definite course, call it Engineering
500, would be established with a planned
program of inspection trips, the deficit of
practical knowledge would be remedied.

". . . . The engineer should secure more
control in engineering activities just as the
medical and law professions have done,
and the basis for this control should be
the best interest of society. By organiz-
ing active professional societies he can
best hope to achieve this control. The
strength of the present day labor organi-
zations illustrate the power of a unified
group with a common aim. Engineers
properly organized can make their influ-
ence felt in all matters of public policies
where their technical ability is needed."

". . . . The majority of complaints of
students is not the difficulty of the subject
material or the lack of knowledge of the
material on the part of the instructor.
Engineering College instructors as a rule
know their material well. The basic cause
of the majority of the perennial student
gripes toward instructors is in the pre-
sentation of the material."

observance, but as a set of dynamic prin-
ciples guiding his conduct and way of life.

The propulsion of aircraft and missiles at speeds greater than that of sound leads to
many problems connected with shock waves. The shock tube illustrated above has been
developed in the Department of Physics for the study of these problems, supplementing
the experimental program at the wind tunnel.
The far end of the tube contains air or some other gas at atmospheric or higher pres-
sure, confined by a diaphragm of cellophane. The spool of cellophane tape may be seen
seated upon the tube. The near end of the tube is exacuated. When the diaphragm is
broken, the gas rushes down the tube reaching supersonic speeds. As the gas passes the
stationary projectile, shock waves are produced and recorded photographically.

ROBERT PAUL, '50 NA
There has been some talk about length-
ening the engineering curricula. Objec-
tions to this proposal are usually based on
the increased cost to each student. With
this objection we do not argue. However,
there are changes in the curricula that can
be made even within the structure of a
four year program. We feel that time is
wasted and educational experiences are
lost by overemphasizing the development
of the engineer as a tool of industry, and
underemphasizing the development of the
engineer as a human being in a society of
other human beings.
Many of us have unpleasant memories
of the Freshman Assemblies which all
embryo engineers attend. We remem-
ber boring hours of lectures on such pro-
found subjects as the favorable psycho-
logical implications of staying awake all
night studying for an examination.
This disillusioning introduction to an
engineering education was soon followed
by disheartening experiences in other
classes. We particularly remember our
freshman engineering English class, be-
cause it was there that we received an in-
troduction to the dispassionate presenta-
tion of facts through the media of the
English language. Any conceptions of
writing, primarily to entertain the reader,
were thrown overboard after reading the
instructor's comments at the bottom of
our themes. One instructor's comment
which we have heard contained such bit-
ing sentiment as, "We don't want your
personality, we want only the facts."
A subjugation of the personality is
necessary if the uniformity of presenta-
tion demanded by the engineering pro-
fession is to be obtained. Still, we ques-
tion the validity of the premise that an
engineer's personality must be so totally
submerged that he tends to look at all of
life in the third person. An objective and
analytical view of the physical world is
the stock and trade of the engineer; but if
this view pervades his daily life he be-
comes a cautious, life-less companion who
seldom expresses his personal reactions to
life around him. Many engineers are just
that kind of companion.
We know men, who are nearing the
end of their stay in the Engineering Col-
lege, who tell us how disturbed they are
by their inability to think easily in terms
of human values. These men are steeped
in a scientific methodology, but they have
little knowledge of how, or by whom, that
scientific method was developed. They
are scientists; yet they are unsure of the
role which science should play in our
society. What is even more tragic is
their lack of knowledge of human rela-
tionships. They live in a society and yet
they don't quite understand either what
the society is doing to them, or what they
are doing to the society.
The engineering student often fails to
realize the social significance of the work
he will do when he graduates. He learns
to design machines, but he seldom con-
siders the effect his machine may have on
his environment. Often he fails to realize
that his invention might cause one of his
neighbors to lose his job! An engineer
seldom thinks of his relationships to his
society. Often the engineer's view of so-
cial affairs is so introverted that he refuses
to take part in any of the activities of
his community. He serves his society by
doing his share of the constructive work,
but he will not, and often cannot, voice
his opinions on governing and improving
his society.
To achieve this more diversified educa-
tion, the engineering curricula must be
revised. Liberal arts colleges are begin-
ning to stress more and more a general
rather than a specialized education. If the
engineering colleges were to proceed with
the same purpose, the engineering gradu-
ate would be more of a man and less of a
machine.
One possible revision in the curricula of
this Engineering College would follow
these lines: Replace the inane Freshman
Assembly with a weekly lecture on the
philosophy of science. Include in this
course outside reading, which would
be made compulsory by testing the stu-
dents at regular intervals. Offer two sur-
vey courses, one in history and one in
political science, which would be compul-
sory for all engineering students. These
courses should stress the methods of his-
torical and governmental enquiry. They
should not be designed to teach the engi-
neer easily forgotten facts, but instead to
develop a workable basis for future read-
ing and discussion in the history and
government of our country. Lastly, we
suggest an amalgamation of the English
departments of the Literary and Engineer-
ing Colleges. The freshman engineering
student would not be immediately ini-
tiated to the rigors of report writing; in-
stead he would be permitted to grow as a
person before his personality were cut to
fit the pattern of an industrial America.

"just drive straight ahead
for 37,681 miles''
THOSE beautiful, wide, straight, smooth roads you've been
wishing for, are really on their way. The magnificent plan of
interstate highways, greatest road program in U. S. history, is
already taking form at the rate of 700 million dollars worth of con-
struction per year.
37,681 miles of swell driving . . . direct travel from any part of
the country to any other part... routes north and south, cast and
west, and diagonal routes as well... big highways directly serving
practically all cities of 50,000 population or more . . .
This is part of the better America that our generation is build-
ing. It's taking plenty of brains. Plenty of manpower. Lots of
Cement. And lots of steel.
United States Steel has always played an important part in
building the nation's highways. We've supplied steel reinforcing
bars and wire fabric to make roads stronger, smoother, longer-last-
ing. We've made the steel for road-building machinery, the steel
pipe and culverts for proper drainage. We've built bridges to
carry highways over rivers and canyons. We've furnished steel and
cement to help drill highway tunnels.
United States Steel is ready to help with any job the nation
has in the building of a better America. That's one reason why
United States Steel is a good place to work.

Optional Illusion
— but industries save if
they see valves this way
fTIHERE ARE TWO WAYS of regarding
A the valves in any plant. Man-
agement can think of the relatively
small cost of a single valve, and dis-
miss it as a minor, "petty cash"
investment. Or, they can think of
all valves in the plant as one valve,
as pictured, by photo-magic, in this
pharmaceutical plant,—and see
valves in proper perspective.
THEY FIND IT PAYS to take the lat-
ter view, for in any plant, any
building where fluid control is in-
volved, valves, collectively, are as
important, in terms of investment
and operating expense, as larger
plant units, and should be selected
with the same sharp eye to quality
and economy.
EXCESSIVE MAINTENANCE of one in-
ferior valve is insignificant, but
multiplied by thousands, it is a
serious drain on operating budgets.

"To make traveling more fun. The idea is to give people more to see and do while riding faster and safer. That
means more passengers for the railroads so that they can keep fares down and still add more comfort to long trips."



"Railroad comfort comes from many
things, son. Smooth-fitting parts are
important. Parts like Diesel engine
crankshafts, pistons and wheels. That's
why so many railroad shops use
Norton grinders and Alundum grind-
ing wheels to make parts smooth.
"Take those side rods on steam loco-
motives. They get farther over on the
smooth side thanks to Norton internal
grinding wheels. And parts are fin-
ished so accurately with Norton
quality controlled wheels that they
last for thousands of miles, Paul.
"Getting back to comfort. . . modern
trains travel over 60 miles an hour.
So, they need smooth rail joints.
Those joints are welded for safety.
Then, they're ground smooth and
slotted with Norton grinding and cut-
off wheels."
"Hundreds of other parts
of modern railroad trains and tracks

DAVID PETERSON, '49Aero

Since the advent of jet propulsion it has
been said that the propeller "was a nice
thing while it lasted." Of course this
statement is true only of high speed air-
craft requiring large amounts of power
which the conventional propeller is incap-
able of absorbing. It is doubtful that the
jet will replace the reciprocating engine
and propeller for airplanes of low and
medium power. At the present stage of
development, it is not economically feas-
ible to produce a low power jet engine
for any commercial purpose.
Then, since the duty of the jet engine
is to produce large amounts of power, it is
the job of the engine designer to maximize
this power, even at the expense of other
desirable characteristics. The range of jet
airplanes is one thing that cannot be en-
tirely sacrificed to obtain high speed, so it
appears that more power must be develop-
ed without a proportional increase in fuel
consumption.
Although substantial increases in the
power and economy of turbojets can be
realized from improvements in the flow
capacity and efficiency, the largest and
most significant benefits may be derived
from increasing the temperature of the
gases at the turbine inlet. For a given
capacity or airflow quantity it can be
shown from turbine theory that the power
per pound of air is proportional to the tur-
bine inlet temperature. This is verified by
National Advisory Committee for Aero-
nautics experimental data which is plotted
in Fig. 1. This graph also shows that at
higher temperatures the specific fuel con-
sumption decreases.
The limit in top temperature exists be-
cause there is an optimum blade tempera-
ture of about 1500° Fahrenheit beyond
which the allowable wheel speed is re-
duced—due to a decrease in permissible
blade stresses—which in turn reduces the
velocity ratio and causes a drop in turbine
efficiency. Therefore the problem is to
increase the temperature that the turbine
blades can withstand.
Besides increasing the power and effi-
ciency of the engine there is another
smaller gain to be attained by using higher
turbine inlet temperatures. This is that
DAVID PETERSON
the power required can be reduced. Pres-
ent day turbojets use approximately 70
pounds of air for every pound of fuel al-
though only 15 pounds are necessary for
combustion. The other 55 pounds are
used to cool the gases to a temperature that
will not damage the turbine wherel. If,
however, the turbine blades could with-
stand higher temperatures, smaller ducts
could be used, reducing the duct losses and
drag and thus lower the power required
to a certain degree. It is true that this ex-
cess air adds thrust, but at higher operat-
ing temperatures the same thrust could be
obtained with a smaller air flow.
There are two approaches toward de-
veloping turbine blades that will with-
stand high temperatures. One is to de-
velop alloys that have certain properties
at elevated temperatures. These properties
are: high tensile strength at high tempera-
tures, low creep at the maximum operating
temperature, high fatigue resistance, corro-
sion resistance, and machinability. Some
of these characteristics are contradictory
and therefore a compromise must be made.
There are three general groups of alloys
that are in use now for turbine blades.
They are: austenitic work-hardening steels,
the same metals with added stabilizers,
and age-hardening or precipitation-hard-
ening steels; the latter group includes
Inconel X, one of the most commonly
used high-temperature alloys.
While it is probable that these alloys
will be improved or other alloys will be
developed eventually, the more immediate
means of realizing the remarkable per-
formance possible at higher gas tempera-
tures is by cooling turbine blades made of
the present alloys. The principle methods
of doing this are: boundary layer cooling,
rim cooling, air cooling, liquid cooling,
and the combination of one of these
methods with a heat resistant ceramic coat-
ing on the blades.
Boundary Layer Cooling
Boundary layer cooling is accomplished
by directing a supply of cold air over the
root of the blade whereupon the centri-
fugal force draws it out radially along the
blade in a thin boundary layer. Although
very little has been released on this method
it is known that various methods of in-
ducing cold air into the boundary layer are
being experimented with.
Skyhawk Motors, Incorporated has de-
veloped a turbojet that, from existing in-
formation, is probably cooled this way.
It was demonstrated before representatives
of the NACA and the Navy that although
the turbine blades of their engine turned
to a cherry red after starting, they cooled
until they turned black when the speed
was increased to 20,000 r.p.m. The com-
pany claims that this engine also elimi-
nates, to a large degree, the pressure loss

Picatinny Arsenal, operated by Civil
Service employees under military adminis-
tration, is one of the specialized Arsenals
of the Ordnance Department. Its mission
embraces basic and applied research, de-
velopment and production in connection
with explosives, propellants, artillery am-
munition, bombs, pyrotechnic assemblies,
special devices and rockets.
As this requires the technical services
of chemists and physicists as well as chem-
ical, mechanical, metallurgical, electrical
and ordnance engineers, its activities and
opportunities should be of interest to all
graduates in these fields of science and
engineering. This is particularly true
since academic training in Ordnance is
not generally available, industrial experi-
ence opportunities for the individual are
limited, and positions of increasing re-
sponsibility and remuneration generally
must be filled by individuals who have
acquired the necessary specialized training
and experience within the organization.
Because of these conditions, careers in the
specialized applications of science and
engineering to ammunition offer greater
prospects of continued progression with
commensurate ability than are probable in
other fields.
Publicity given to rockets, guided mis-
siles and the atomic bomb during the past
three years has gone far to disabuse the
general impression of the pre-war years
that ammunition is a stodgy business of
few technical attractions. Nevertheless,
relatively few technical and scientific per-
sonnel are acquainted with the technologi-
cal problems which should make the field
interesting to the most capable.
Each major war sees the feverish de-
velopment and use of new materials, de-
signs and devices to meet new tactical re-
quirements. World War I witnessed the
introduction of new propellants and ex-
plosives as well as mortars land-mines
and bombs. World War II exigencies re-
sulted in the development of "tailor-
made" explosives, rockets, VT-fuses,
shaped charges, incendiary bullets, and
other ordnance equipment. The stand-
ardization of such materials and devices
under the pressure of war necessity gen-
erally results in a host of new technical

problems for the post-war period. These
problems arise from the necessity for
"taking out the bugs" almost always pres-
ent in hasty designs, meeting the inevit-
able requirements for improved perform-
ance, and broadening the scope of appli-
cation of the new materials or design.
Add to these, the requirements of new
tactics of war and its changing economic
aspects, and a multiplicity of problems
is assured.
To specialist in the field these prob-
lems are both intriguing and exacting,
since the requirements usually are more
extreme thran those for a comparable com-
mercial article. Examples of such extreme
requirements are ability to withstand
storage unchanged during long periods
of peace, functioning at extremes of tem-
perature such as —65° and 160°F, and
compatibility of the various metals, explo-
sives, plastics, textiles, propellants, seal-
ers, etc, involved in and end item. How-
ever, all problems are not directly con-
nected with such end items; the research
development of a new material, such as a
new explosive, giving rise to chemical
engineering problems of production and
ordnance engineering problems of ap-
plication.
The organization of research and engi-
neering work in the directions mentioned
is shown by the following simplified table:
Materials Research and Development
Chemical Research—Explosives, pro-
pellant ingredients, etc.
Physical Research—Flash radiography,
thermochemistry, interior ballistics
Plastics Research—Evaluation of plas-
tics, compatibility
Propellants and Explosives—Develop-
ment of propellants, application and
loading of explosives
Ammunition Design
Artillery Ammunition -- Projectiles,
boosters, fuses, detonators
Bombs—Bomb cases, fuzes, land mines
Rockets—Motors, igniters, JATOS, etc.
Pyrotechnics—Signals, tracers, flares,
photoflash bombs, etc.
Packing — Protection for complete
rounds, components and materials
Testing—Supra-laboratory tests of mater-
ials and designs.
While work along all the lines shown
above is carried out at the Arsenal, a very
considerable amount is done under con-
tract by various academic institutions (of
which the University of Michigan is one),
private research organizations and indus-
trial corporations. Such contracts are ad-
ministered by the appropriate Ordnance
District Offices and the work is super-
vised and coordinated by Arsenal person-
nel having specialized experience in the
fields covered by the contracts. Such con-
tracts may vary from the extremes of basic
research in organic chemistry to the de-
sign and development of a complete
round of ammunition.
The personnel required for the work
shown above consists essentially of chem-
ists, physicists, metallurgists and engi-
neers but the very considerable degree of
specialization required leads to a wide
variety of designations. The research work
is done by organic, inorganic and physical
chemists who in the course of their work
acquire a specialized experience in ex-
plosives propellant ingredients and pyro-
technic compositions; electronic, x-ray and
heat physicists who develop instruments
for and make studies of the physical
characteristics and behavior of explosives
and propellants; and materials engineers

tics. The development of propellants and
work on the application of explosives is
done chiefly by chemical engineers and
chemists who have acquired a background
of experience in explosives and propel-
lants through laboratory work. Ammu-
nition design and development require
the services of mechanical, electrical,
chemical, materials, and ordnance engi-
neers; the last classification consisting of
conventionally trained engineers who have
had experience in Ordnance work of a
technical nature. Testing work on a

Sensitive Materials
larger-than-laboratory scale is extremely
varied and utilizes the services of physic-
ists, materials engineers, metallurgists,
mathematicians, and ordnance engineers.
It would be desirable to give examples
of the problems assigned to and attacked
in each of the above organizational sub-
divisions, but this would not be practic-
able in an article of limited length and
because of strictly defined areas of confi-
dentiality. Suffice it to say that the inter-
World Yar period saw the development
of non-exuding TNT, non-strategic sub-
stitutes for silk cartridge bag-cloth, non-
flashing and -hygroscopic artillery powder
and the explosive Haleite, and the perfec-
tion of the relatively crude mortar am-
munition, fuzes, land-mines and bombs
inherited from World War I. From the
preceding table of organization, the types
of existing problems can be visualized to
some extent; and it is to be emphasized
that the problems of today are more com-
plex and exacting than those of which the
outcomes have just been cited.
I am aware that the foregoing, by im-
plication at least, may convey the erron-
eous impression that a scientific or engi-
neering career in Ordnance ammunition
is one of anonymous and perhaps unre-
warding to the individual. This raises the
question as to whether such a career is
sufficiently attractive to warrant deliberate
selection by the new graduate in engi-
neering or one of the physical sciences.
Let us consider the major advantages and
disadvantages of a Civil Service career of
this type.
The technologists and scientist must ap-
proach the practice of his vocation with a
double-barreled viewpoint, unless he is
enabled by inheritance to disregard the
economic problems which most individ-
uals must face regardless of occupation.
In other words, a possible career in Ord-
nance ammunition as well as other fields
must be assayed on the basis of the an-
swers to the question: "What can it mean
to me professionally and economically?"
As all occupations involved in our com-
plex economy have their disadvantages, it
is well to concede and identify these be-
fore enumerating the more numerous ad-
vantages accruing from a competitive,
basically free-enterprise system of politi-
cal and economic organization.
The disadvantages of a Civil Service ca-
reer in ammunition are chiefly those of
probable limitations, both professional
and economic. It is undeniable that be-
cause of the nature of the problems, op-
portunities for publication of original
work are more limited than are those in
academic and industrial organizations.
Furthermore, the ammunition technologist
and scientist generally has less opportun-
ity to take an active part in scientific and
professional society activities and so be-
come generally recognized in his special
field. All this adds up to some limita-
tion in the opportunity to develop general
professional prestige. Similarly, the cur-
rent legal ceiling on Civil Service salaries
imposes a limitation on the economic op-
portunities of the employee. Since this
ceiling is well above the mean of salaries
obtained by academic and industrial tech-
nical employees having comparable train-
ing and experience, and is exceeded only
by those exceptionally successful in indus-
try, this limitation is real only to such few
individuals as are confident of exceptional
success in industry. Finally, there is the
disadvantage to an ammunition career
that such specialized experience, after a
few years, has less market value than
many other types, if and when the indi-
vidual desired to enter another type of
work in his general field.
By many of those who have the per-
spective of long years of Civil Service ex-
perience, it is believed that the advantages
of such a career far outweigh the disad-
vantages disclosed and—from the long-
range viewpoint—are greater than those
offered, by industry to the better-than-
average individual. That these advant-
ages are very real and cumulative will be
recognized from the following:
The newly-graduated engineer, chem-
ist or physicist can enter upon an ammu-
nition career at salaries of $2975, $3727,
and $4480, if he has a bachelor's, master's
or doctor's degree, respectively. After
passing through the probationary period
of one year with a satisfactory record, he
becomes eligible for periodic within-grade
promotions which provide a prospect of
steady progress for several years. If he
displays the ability to undertake more
difficult and responsible work and can
meet the formal requirements, he can be
promoted to a higher designation based
on an evaluation of the new position.
This automatically opens to him a new
salary range to be encompassed by periodic
within grade promotions. Another op-
portunity for professional and salary ad-
vancement can be realized by the indi-

vidual taking Civil Service examinations
for higher designations and accepting em-
ployment in another Government organi-
zation. Such an opportunity to change
positions within Civil Service represents
a major advantage, since many industrial
organizations have employment policies

tion of five year courses at R.P.I. The De-
partment of Agriculture is the first to
change. Will other departments follow in
its footsteps?
There is a growing trend towards this
lengthened period of study in many of the
leading engineering schools in the country.
To cite three examples: Cornell has in-
stituted a five year course in Chemical
Engineering; Ohio State University in sev-
eral courses and Dartmouth in all Engi-
neering courses. These are only a few of
the many schools who have altered their
curriculum.
What are the reasons for this change
in a pattern of education that has existed
for decades? The main reason will be
found in the increasing complexity of
modern scientific and engineering sub-
jects. Developments have increased so
rapidly that many new, different and spec-
ialized fields have been born.
In some of today's fields it is impossible
for the student to learn much more than
the fundamentals of a course in the nor-
mal four year curriculum. Compare this
with fifty years ago and you will see the
enormous changes that have taken place.
At that time it was possible to learn all
that was necessary in four years because
our modern age with all its complexities
was still in its infancy.

However, soon we will be the potential
in our engineering organization and the
success of any program to elevate our pro-
fessional status will depend upon our will
to sever tradition and effect corrective
measures.
Such corrective measures will probably
incorporate such suggestions as licensing,
unionization, and an adaptation of the
methods employed in the recognized pro-
fessions.

The days of the office boy rising to the
top and becoming president of the firm
are gone. Procedures, methods in busi-
ness, manufacturing, marketing, sales, dis-
tribution, and design are so involved it
takes specialists to fill the needs of our
present industrial system. To provide
these technicians, colleges and technical
schools are hard pressed and working
overtime to turn out graduates fitted for
industry. The student's training does not
end when he leaves the ivy covered halls.
Invariably his employer must train him
for the position he is to hold; this train-
ing often lasting a year or more. Study
does not end here; refresher courses, ad-
vanced training, and experiment go on for
the rest of his life.

"There are indications that a wave of
discontent is mounting among the profes-
sional employees in industry. The C.I.O.
and the A.F. of L. are laying the ground-
work for intensive campaigns. In a large
Chicago plant, in less than three months,
a unit that was being formed had signed
up more than one third of the eligible
engineers. These men certainly must have
many concrete grievances to prompt them
to act so swiftly.
"It is interesting to note that most of
the grievances felt by these engineers are
not primarily concerned with money. Or-
ganizational literature shows a preoccupa-
tion first with attempts to improve the
standards of the profession and second
with drives for higher pay.
"If management is willing to call its
engineers "professional people," is it also
ready to treat them in a professional man-
ner? Is it, for instance, necessary that these
"professional people" punch a time
clock?"
To which I may add: and it is necessary
that they fill out application blanks which
are apt to offend their personal dignity
and professional pride?
—Illinois Tech Engineer, May, '49
Does engineering education put enough
emphasis on the practical approach to
problems? The answer, in light of prev-
ious experience, must be an emphatic
"No." The ratio of time spent on theory
to the time spent on application of theory
to practice must be about ten to one at
most engineering schools. Then, as the
engineer graduates and steps out into in-
dustry, he finds the ratio reversed. His
use of the theoretical is minimized and he
must learn the practical approach he did
not learn in school.
What is the solution? Should the pres-
ent ratio of the theoretical to the practical
be reversed or even approach reversal.
Certainly not, for several reasons. The
teaching of theory helps the student
understand the evolution of formulas he
will use. It helps develop an inquiring
attitude. It integrates important relation-
ships in his mind. Theory, then, is in-
valuable. It has a dynamic place in engi-
neering education. But when time spent
on theory encroaches on time which right-
fully belongs to practicality, an objection
must be registered.
—Georgia Tech Engineer, May, 1949
Such a simple thing is recognition, and
yet so easily overlooked by us in our mad
scramble for personal advancement. It is
a powerful tool if properly employed but
deadly if neglected. Its proper use, then,
should be cultivated now, not later, for it
is no spur of the moment proposition. It
takes a good deal of time and practice, yes,
and will power to give credit to others
when you might as easily take it upon
yourself, but, in the long run, you will
gain for it. So a little thought and reflec-
tion on the question is in order for us all,
to make us understand the importance of
giving proper recognition to the efforts of
others, of giving credit where credit is
due.
—Marquette Engineer, June, 1949
We are now actively embracing the
philosophy that it is much more desirable
to know a great amount about a single
field than an equal amount about several
varied fields. This trend towards speciali-
zation is nowhere more in evidence than in
our scientific colleges. In the medical pro-
fession there exists an acute need for gen-
eral practitioners, but the young medical
graduate much prefers to be a specialist
believing that the specialist is of a higher
professional status than the general prac-
titioner. However, by far the greatest em-
phasis on specialization is to be found in
our engineering schools. Here the phil-
osophy of the day fits with the tradition of
the past, and as a result, the student is
given little or no choice but to specialize
in a particular field of engineering. The
natural outcome of this intense speciali-
zation is by its very nature the de-empha-
sis of all other subjects and particularly
those cultural and intellectually broaden-
ing courses.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


OF CIVILIZATION
by
PROF. LESLIE A. WHITE

We feel that the engineer's limited
contact with non-technical subjects has
a narrowing effect on his understanding
of our culture. To meet the need of in-
troducing broader horizons to the tech-
nical student, the MICHIGAN TECHNIC
is presenting a series of brief articles on
topics outside of the engineering cur-
riculum.
The first of these faculty written ar-
ticles is by Prof. White, who has gained
widespread recognition for his study of
man and his development. Ed.
"The laws expressing the relations be-
tween energy and matter are, however, not
solely of importance in pure science. They
necessarily come first in order ... in the
whole record of human experience, and
they control, in the last resort, the rise or
fall of political systems, the freedom or
bondage of nations, the movements of
commerce and industry, the origin of
wealth and poverty, and the general
physical welfare of the race."—Frederick
Soddy, Matter and Energy, pp. 10-11
(New York, 1912).
All biological organisms must capture
and utilize energy in order to live, and
man is no exception to this rule. He does,
however, differ from all other species in
the means with which energy is controlled.
Man's means are cultural; those of other
species are not. By culture the anthropol-
ogist means the organization of tools, im-
plements, customs, institutions, languages,
philosophies and forms of art that all
peoples have by virtue of an ability pos-
sessed by man alone: the ability to use
symbols in general and articulate speech in
particular. Culture is a generic term for
all of the civilizations of the human
species, regardless of time, place, or race,
and irrespective of degree of development.
The function of culture is to effect a
life-sustaining adjustment between man
and his habitats on the one hand, and to
organize and regulate social relations be-
tween human beings on the other. In
short, the function of culture is to make
life secure and continuous for mankind.
Since all life is dependent upon the acqui-
sition and utilization of energy, it follows
that the basic function of culture is to har-
ness energy and to expend it in the service
of a particular animal species, Homo
sapiens.
PROF. LESLIE A. WHITE
The culture of mankind may be regard-
ed as a continuous, cumulative and pro-
gressive system. Among the lower species,
each generation begins where the preced-
ing one began—except for the infinitesi-
mal change, if any, due to biological evo-
lution. In the human species, however,
each generation begins where the preced-
ing one left off. As a consequence of in-
ventions and discoveries, culture has de-
veloped from the most primitive, even
anthropoid, levels to the highest civiliza-
tions of the present day.
The growth of culture, the development
of civilization, is best understood from the
standpoint of harnessing energy and of
putting it to work. Culture grows when
and as the amount of energy harnessed
and put to work per capita per year in-
creases, other factors remaining constant.
The degree of development of culture
is proportional to the amount of energy
harnessed: if the amount is small the cul-
ture will be low and crude; if it is great,
the culture will be high and complex—
other factors remaining constant.
Man and culture began about a million
years ago. In the beginning, and for
about the first 985,000 years of man's ca-
reer so far, cultural systems had only the
energy of the human organism to draw
upon. This means that they could gen-
erate and use only about l/20th horse-
power—about 1/2 manpower—per capita.
Wind, water and fire have been insignifi-
cant as sources of energy for culture build-
ing until relatively recent times.
The extent to which culture could de-
velop upon such meager energy resources
was, of course, extremely limited. And, it
is significant to note, man could never
have evaluated himself above the level of
savagery had he not been able to augment
his energy resources for culture building.
It is no more possible to do work and
achieve results without energy in the realm
of culture than in any other.
The first great advance in cultural de-
velopment came as a consequence of the
domestication of animals and the cultiva-
tion of plants. Plants and animals are, of
course, terrestrial forms and magnitudes
of solar energy. And animal husbandry
and agriculture are means of harnessing
these energies, just as water wheels or
hydroelectric plants are means or har-
nessing the energies of rivers.
During the long era of the Paleolithic,
or Old Stone Age, for hundreds of
thousands of years, progress in cultural
development was exceedingly slow and
meager. We can form a good idea of the
limits of cultural development on a human
energy basis from a consideration of
primitive tribes of the modern world, such
as the aborigines of Australia or some pre-
agricultural American Indian tribes.
With the origin of agriculture some
twelve or fifteen thousand years ago, cul-
ture took a great step forward. With the
increase in food supply the population in-
creased; tiny settlements grew into towns
and these into great cities; tribes grew
into nations and empires. Society became
differentiated into occupational groups
and stratified classes. The industrial and
esthetic arts made great and rapid prog-
ress. Astronomy, mathematics, medicine,
and engineering became distinct profes-
sions. The whole life of man was trans-
formed.
But culture had developed about as far
as it could with its new energy resources
by about the beginning of the Christian
era. In some respects, the culture of
northwestern Europe in A.D. 1500 was
inferior to that of the Graeco-Roman
world, or even of ancient Mesopotamia or

Most people view suspiciously the
mathematical description of the world
about us. "Common sense" description
within the realm of human experience is
much more appealing. However, a mo-
ment's reflection makes one realize how
limited and feeble man's perception really
is. Man's knowledge of the universe is
the subjective impression of imperfect
senses.
Order is the keynote of nature, not chao-
tic individual impressions. It is this
mathematical orthodoxy of the universe
that enables theorists to discover natural
laws by the use of equations.
We must understand that the use of
scientific words such as electron, photon,
or electromagnetic wave are only guide-
posts, not accurate descriptions. They are
simple symbols useful in explaining the
mathematical relationship of the micro-
cosm. For example, for many practical
purposes we picture the electron as a small
rigid sphere with a negative charge. This
simple description is convenient, but
mathematical equations are necessary to
explain as much as is known about the
true complex construction of the electron.
Detailed mathematical proof of the
Principle of Relativity would prove too
complicated for most of us. Therefore,
we will resort mainly to the previously
mentioned symbols, aided by some analo-
gies, to present the basic concepts of rela-
tivity.
Light and Space
According to the Newtonian or Gali-
lean Relativity principle, mechanical laws
valid in one place are valid in any other
place which moves uniformly relative to
the first. Newton was troubled with rela-
tive and absolute motion. He regarded
space as a stationary reality on theological
grounds. It had to be assumed that space
had certain mechanical properties.
When the wave character of light was
shown, together with light's ability to pass
through a vacuum, scientists evolved a
hypothetical ether which was supposed to
pervade all space and matter.
Newton pointed out that the movement
of a ship moving through a calm sea can
not be detected from inside the ship. If a
log were thrown overboard, then the
ship's motion can be noted by observ-

ALBERT FORMAN
ing the change of the distance between
ship and log.
Similarly, if light is propagated through
the ether in the same way as a ship
through the sea, its velocity should be
affected by the ether streams caused by the
earth's movement. In 1881, Michelson
and Morley reasoned that if they sent a
light ray against the stream, the light's ve-
locity would be decreased, like a swimmer
opposing a current. Oppositely, the veloc-
ity should increase if sent with the current.
Using a delicate interferometer, the two
men tried the experiment. There was no
difference in velocity! The apparent vo-
locity of the earth through the ether was
zero. The dilemma required the scrapping
of the concept of the ether or the theory
that the earth is in absolute motion.
Special Theory of Relativity
In 1905, at the age of 26, Albert Ein-
stein published a paper rejecting the ether
and fixed-space-at-rest concept. If the ve-
locity of light is constant regardless of the
earth's motion, he postulated it would be
constant for any moving system in the
universe. In Einstein's Special Theory of
Relativity, he drew a comprehensive gener-
alization incorporating the Galilean Rela-
tivity principle. He stated that the laws of
nature are the same for all uniformly
moving systems.
Light could not be used as a measuring
rod because its velocity is constant, un-
affected by any motion of the observer.
Further, there are no absolute standards of
comparison in nature. Two centuries be-
fore Einstein, Leibnitz saw that space is
"the order or relation of things among
themselves." Without things occupying it.
it is nothing.
Time
Man is reluctant to recognize that time,
like the sense of color, is a form of per-
ception. As space is an order of possible
material objects, time is a possible order
of events. To the individual, events can
be remembered as earlier or later. Sub-
jectively, events can be associated with the
events of numbers on a clock or calendar.
We refer our own experiences to a clock
and try to make time an objective concept.
Yet time intervals on a clock are not abso-
lute quantities imposed on the universe.
To illustrate, let us look at a hypotheti-
cal experiment basically similar to one
actually performed to show that time can
not be independent of the system to which
it is referred. Assume a racing car is a
distance x from a source of light. When
the car is not moving, the driver would
measure the speed of light, c, as 186, 284
miles per second. According to classical
physics, when the car is approaching the
source of light with a velocity, v, the ap-
parent speed of light should measure 186,
284 plus v in the car. As previously sug-
gested, such is not the case. The measured
speed of approach of light and car is still
c. With c constant, only x or the time
could have varied to produce the correct
velocity of light. In other words, the time
in a car standing still may not be the same
as in one moving down the road.
Space
Once we digest this revolutionary con-
cept of time, we will not be surprised to
learn that space depends on the motion of
the system of reference. The difference
between relativistic time and space and
classical time and space accounts for the
constant speed of light and the discrepancy
in velocities previously noted.
According to the old principle of the
addition of velocities, the distance x', to
an arbitrary origin, measured with respect
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


of motion, is related to the distance x,
measured with respect to a relatively sta-
tionary point by the equation x' = x ±
vt, where v is the velocity of the moving
system and t is the time. Y' and z' per-
pendicular to x* are equal to y and z re-
spectively. The time interval f, clocked
with respect to the moving system equals
t, clocked with respect to the stationary
system.
The Lorentz transformation used by
Einstein in his special theory, surmounts
the paradoxical problems presented by
these equalities by taking into account a
modifying factor, the motion of the sys-
tem relative to the speed of light. The
values on the moving systems are reduced
to the conditions of the stationary observer
as follows:

x' = -
x —vt
z' =
t —
./
Observe that when v is much smaller
than c, as it is in everyday experience, the
Lorenlz transformation reduces to the
classical values. Only when v approaches
c do the relativistic values of time and
space change significantly.
Rods and Clocks
Consistent with the Lorentz transforma-
tion, motion affects measuring instruments
in such a way as to explain the phenome-
non of the constant velocity of light.
Clocks slow down and measuring rods
shrink when moving as observed from a
stationary point with respect to the mov-
ing system. The moving observer does not
notice these changes which are not me-
chanical phenomena.
Suppose we stand on the ground and
measure a rocket with a yardstick. Then
an observer boards the rocket with the
measuring rod and a clock. The projec-
tile is fired into the air at a high velocity.
The rocket and the yardstick shrink pro-
portionately, so when the moving ob-
server measures the length of the rocket it
will appear to him to be the same length
as it was before being fired. At the same
time, his clock will take longer to tick off a
second than the clock held by someone
remaining on the ground.
An interesting problem illustrating the idea of simultaneous action is shown
above. Suppose an observer is standing at a position equidistant from A and B
on a straight track and sees two lightning bolts strike these two points at
the same moment. A train speeds down the track toward A. A second observer
atop one of the cars moves through the plane which is perpendicular to AB and
passes through the first observer at the instant when the first man saw the two
bolts strike. However, at that moment, the second observer sees only the bolt
at A! This is easily understood if we imagine the train moving at the speed of
light—the light flash of the bolt striking B could never catch up to the moving
observer. Of course, this extreme speed is actually impossible and is intended
only to make the contradictory situation of the two observers more under-
standable.
The important concept to grasp from this paradoxical problem is this: When
a fraction of time is expressed as "now", that unit of time is not necessarily
identical or simultaneous with the "now" of a different moving system. Time,
like space, is a relative concept that must be referred to the state of motion
of the reference system.
Limiting Speed
If a body were to move at the speed of
light, it would shrink to nothing and a
clock moving at this same speed would
stop. Now we can conclude a fundamen-
tal law of nature. The speed of light is
the maximum speed in the universe.
Mass
To describe the universe, three quan-
tities are required: time, distance and
mass. Like the first two, the mass of a
body varies with its state of motion. The
following equation gives the value of m,
the mass of a body in motion in relation
to the mass, m0, of a body relatively at rest.
m =
m0
This equality is substantiated by the ex-
perimental findings of atomic physicists.
It does not seem to be "common sense"
for a moving body to increase its mass,
but once again we note that the change is
radical only at velocities approaching c.
The concept of mass in motion does not
contradict the relativistic contraction of
length which is only in the direction of
motion. It should be remembered that
mass in the scientific sense is not weight or
heaviness, but inertial resistance to motion.
Mass and Energy
Einstein's reasoning ran somewhat as
follows: since the mass of a moving body
increases as its motion increases, and since
motion is a form of energy, then the in-
creased mass of a moving body comes
from its increased energy. This equiva-
lence of mass and energy is expressed
as E = me2 and is the fundamental de-
scription of the energy liberated in atomic
fission. To understand the magnitude of

Look! No Hands!
An automatic tube cartonist at a Gen-
eral Electric warehouse in Owensboro,
Kentucky, is doing with lightning speed
what was once a painstaking manual job.
Thrs machine feeds flat folding car-
tons from a magazine, makes up the car-
ton, inserts the electronic tube, closes the
top and bottom flaps, and imprints the
tube type on the top panel. It's all in one
continuous operation, and at a rate of 160
cartons a minute.
Optic Topics
Here's a new ray of hope for those who
suffer from lamp glare: A new inside
finish for incandescent lamps, developed
by General Electric, has been described as
ly small cracks, which act as nuclei and
grow into a large split when enough
tension is applied.
Prior to this investigation, it was usually
assumed that the break in the metal oc-
curred simultaneously through the sample,
the scientists explained.
The nuclei which may result in fracture
form along the boundaries between the
grains or crystals of metal where the atoms
in the grains are most active. The minute
cracks tend to grow under tension, and if
a nucleus reaches a certain critical size, it
will form a complete split between grains.
Enough rapidly-growing nuclei in a sam-
ple will eventually cause the sample to
break. However, nothing will happen if
only nuclei smaller than the critical size
are present, according to the scientists.

Magnified View of Metal Grains
"the most outstanding improvement in
filament lamps since the introduction of
the first successful inside-frosted lamp in
1925."
This special white finish, a silica sub-
stance, acts as a nearly perfect diffuser of
light. But it permits high light transmis-
sion.
Metal Fracture Theory
New theories as to why and how metals
break were announced recently by scient-
ists of the General Electric Research Lab-
oratory. Their investigations show that
the fracture of metals begins with extreme-
The smaller the nucleius, the bigger the
force needed to expand it into a break,
they said.
Dr. J. H. Hollomon of the G-E Re-
search Laboratory at chenectady has pre-
dicted metals five to ten times stronger
than they are at the present time. "If we
can find ways of preventing crack forma-
tions along the boundaries, and make the
only possible break occur through the
much stronger grains, we can increase the
metals' strength at high temperatures,"
Hollomon said.
The over-all theoretical picture is best
summarized in diagrams (see figure).
Each of the three circles represents a mag-
nified view of the meeting of four metal
grains, the curved lines being their bound-
aries. In the first circle, the metal is
under tension to make them grow into
major cracks are present. In the second
circle, chance atomic activity along the
grain boundaries has caused a super-criti-
cal bubble to form. The tension can make
bubbles that size grow, and, as shown in
the third circle, the crack grows rapidly
along the grain boundaries, and the metal
breaks. This theory, which began with an
investigation of fluids, can account mathe-
matically for the many discrepancies be-
tween previous theories as to how and why
metals break, and actual metallurgical ex-
perience.
Hoisting in Montana
To help recover low grade copper ore,
General Electric is building complete elec-
tric hoist drive equipment for the Ana-
conda Copper Mining Company. It will be
installed at Kelley Shaft at Butte, Mon-
tana, and will include one of the most
powerful hoist motors in the country.
According to engineers, this General
Electric drive will be able to lift 12 tons of
ore each trip at a rate of 2300 feet per
minute, or about 26 miles per hour.
It will be used in the Greater Butte Pro-
ject for the recovery of ore by the caving
method.
Kiss the Hiss Goodbye
We never thought General Electrics
pistol-shaped leak detector would be sniff-
ing for leads in footballs, but it is. The
Collette Manufacturing Company of Am-
sterdam, New York, is using the instru-
ment to spot leaks in footballs.,as they
come bounding off the production line.
Formerly, Collette tested the pigskins
by inflating them and allowing .them to
stand for ten days. This meant an "in
process" stock of approximately 200,000
balls.
Now, a small amount of freon is intro-
duced into the ball at the time of infla-
tion. Next, a sample of the atmosphere
around the ball is sniffed by the detector,
and if there is any trace of freon in the
air, the instrument's indicator makes it
known.

OCTOBER. 1949


The author wishes to express his grati-
tude to Lieutenant Colonel William A.
Call, Ordnance Department, U. S. Army
for having provided him with material for
this article. Colonel Call during the past
two years has been assigned as a student
in the Graduate School working for a
doctorate in Mechanical Engineering. He
is presently on duty at the Detroit Ar-
senal.
The following is by nature a report of
a report and for that reason the writer
generously has borrowed from the Report
of Ease and Maintenance Conference,
Army Ground Forces, Board No. 2, 14-15
November 1946 and from the pamphlet
"Why Ease of Maintenance?" prepared
by the Maintenance and Supply Section
of the same Board.
The writer has omitted punctuating
direct quotations for smoothness except
where length of excerpts warranted
recognition as such.
The writer has tried to withhold from
editorializing, but being a past Army
mechanic, he could not refrain from
cheering from the grandstands.
Like our American economy in general,
-the United States Army is heavily de-
pendent upon motor transportation for its
very existence. The wartime Red Ball Ex-
press of the European theatre was the life-
line of the advancing second front. The
jeep became as familiar as the G. I.
himself to people in countries all over the
world; the steady flow of trucks over the
Burma Road was like an umbilical chord

vehicles. In importance equal to a ve-
hicle's performance is its ability to keep
going, and in the event of breakdown, to
be restored to use with a minimum of time
and effort. For, to paraphrase General
H. H. Arnold, "A truck in the mainten-
ance shop is the most useless thing in the
world."
Accepting as inevitable the propensity
of a vehicle to break down, what about
reducing the time and effort required to
restore it to service?
In peacetime the problem of mainten-
ance is costly enough. In wartime, how-
ever, the problem takes on a more urgent
complexion. Unlike the civilian situation
wherein one expects his automobile to
be repaired by thoroughly competent spec-
ialized mechanics using up-to-date meth-
ods and facilities in an adequately heated

Figure I
Figure 2
and lighted shop building, the military
mechanic is often semiskilled and is ex-
pected to perform his work under all sorts
of environmental conditions, such as, deep
mud, snow, freezing winds, sandstorms,
extreme heat, darkness, and rain, with
little or no shelter. Furthermore, replace-
ment vehicles are not to be had and the
user is constantly screaming for his ve-
hicle.
Experience has shown that if a vehicle
is so designed that repairs are frequent,
lengthy, and difficult, then the burden is
felt not only by the organization using the
vehicle, but by the whole army. More
vehicles are required to achieve a given
transportation, the flow of necessary spare
Figure 3
parts strains supply lines from the fabri
eating plant up to the maintenance eche-
lons, and manpower must be reserved to
perform the needed maintenance.
With this idea in mind the Army Field
Forces has conducted an Ease of Mainten-
ance test program, with a mission to sur-
vey certain military vehicles from the
mechanic's point of view—to look for
essential repairs made more difficult by
design features, and to make recommenda-
tions concerning modification thereof.
This program was inaugurated at Fort
Knox, Kentucky in 1946. Among the
vehicles surveyed were: the Truck, 1/4-ton,
4x4; the Truck, %-ton, 4x4, Weapons
Carrier; the Truck 2^-ton, 6 x 6; the
Light Tank, M24; and the Medium Tank,
M26. The results of the program were
most valuable as well as highly interesting.
Within a few months after the program
was initiated, sufficient data was obtained
to warrant a conference between Army-
Field Forces representatives, civilian de-
signers, and development personnel. The
purpose of this conference was to point
out the problems involved in field main-
tenance. Emphasis to be placed on ease-
of maintenance features of the new light
tank was a result of this conference.
The program was concerned principally
with replacement of major assemblies
which are commonly replaced by field
maintenance units, e.g. engine, clutch,
transmission, axle assemblies, etc. The
initial phases of the program according to
army-approved procedure and sequence

justment of each assembly until a fairly
constant average time requirement was
established. During this part of the pro-
gram, detailed information concerning
time, tool, and mechanic requirements was
compiled together with a detailed account
of any difficulty encountered. This in-

Figure 4
Extension places head of screw in
convenient position
formation was then evaluated with respect
to those features causing trouble. Alter-
nate procedure and experimental modifica-
tions were prepared and tested as far as
possible.
A complete account of the defects found
and modifications suggested could not be
given in this article. Here, however, are
some typical examples:
Light Tank, M24
This vehicle is powered by two engines.
A single engine installation would re-
quire approximately half the time then
required for engine servicing and tune-
up. Time required for engine change
would also be reduced with a single en-
gine installation.
Medium Tank, M26
Accessibility to many components is un-
satisfactory. For instance, the cooling
unit, which weighs approximately 1600
pounds, must be removed before the main
power plant can be removed.
With the wiring system in existence
the mechanic was required to strip at
least half of the wiring system from the
power plant in order to separate the en-
gine from the flywheel and planetary gears
housing. This was necessary in order to
remove the engine. It was suggested that
a line disconnect be incorporated in the
system at the tee adjacent to the flywheel
and gears housing to permit the wiring
system to be broken at that point. The
estimated time saving in this operation
alone would be thirty minutes. (Figs 1
&amp; 2)
Truck, 2'/s-Ton, 6x6
The present engine sling for lifting the
engine is so designed that the spark plugs
must be removed from the engine before
the sling can be attached. Furthermore,
the sling is a special tool, which is an un-
desirable feature. It was suggested that all
general-purpose vehicle engines be fitted
with permanent lifting eyes mounted
either on the cylinder heads or on the cyl-
inder blocks, so that a universal sling can
be used. Estimated saving in time would
be fifteen minutes, and one special tool
less would be needed.
Truck, lA-Ton, 4x4
The fuel pump is fastened to the cylin-
der block by two studs. The stud on the

Figure 5
left of the pump is particularly inacces-
sible. Clearances prohibit the use of either
an open end or a socket wrench. A thin-
walled box wrench must be used, and the
nut can be rotated through only thirty de-
grees before repositioning the wrench.
In addition, the mechanic must work by
feel because of an interrupted line of
vision. A double-headed cap screw with a
head extending clear of the fuel pump
body would permit easy removal (figs. 3
&amp; 4). Replacement of the present nut
is even more serious because of difficulty
in starting the nut on the stud. The sug-
gested modification would permit quick
and easy removal of the fuel pump. Esti-
mated time saving is twenty minutes.
In its then-present location the oil-can
bracket denies clear access to the carbure-
tor mounting bolts, foot throttle linkage,
and oil gauge lines, all of which must be
disconnected before engine removal. The
bracket is also a frequent cause of injury
to mechanics' hands. Repositioning the
bracket would remove a source of frequent
minor injury to mechanics' hands and
would provide easier access to the above-
mentioned lines.
It was suggested to install a sub-frame
for supporting independently the radiator
during power plant removal, test, and
installation, the sub-frame to be welded
to the front engine support. The purpose
of this modification would be to provide
means for removing, transporting, and in-
stalling the cooling system, engine, clutch,
transmission, and transfer case in one
assembly. It is desirable to be able to
remove either the engine and cooling sys-
tem together, or the cooling system, en-
gine, clutch, transmission, and transfer
case in one assembly for the following
reasons: (1) permits easy testing of a like
assembly before installing; (2) provides
ideal accessibility to all power plant major
assemblies and sub-assemblies for repair,
adjustment, or replacement; and (3) the
entire assembly can be moved inside the
shop if necessary for complete check and
overhaul of all or any of the units com-
prising the assembly. Experience under
conditions existing in theatres of opera-

Figure 6
tions has shown that mechanics often will
incorrectly diagnose defects in regard to
the exact location. Overheating often is
attributed to the radiator, whereas it may

between the compressor and turbine. This
pressure loss, present in all turbojet en-
gines now in use, increases the entropy of
the gases, or the amount of heat that can-
not be converted to work. This not only
• increases the specific fuel consumption of
the engine, but also increases the tem-
peratures throughout the hot portion of
the engine.
Rim Cooling
The effectiveness of rim cooling—that
is cooling the rim of the turbine wheel so
that the heat flows through the blades to
the rim—has been investigated recently
by the NACA. Since this method of cool-
ing depends largely on the thermal con-
ductivity of the blade metal, the low con-
ductivity of currently used metals limits
the effectiveness of rim cooling quite se-
verely. The increase in allowable gas
temperature rarely exceeds 300° F. Al-
though this temperature increase causes a
significant gain in performance, it is not
nearly enough to permit the 3500° tem-
perature the fuel is capable of producing.
The principle value of this form of cool-
ing is that it is very easy to accomplish
and can appreciably extend the life of the
turbine blades.
Air Cooling
Tests made by the NACA have shown
that the more direct method1 of passing
cooling air through the center of hollow
blades is much more effective than rim
cooling. Fig. 2, drawn from experimental
data, shows that for a hollow blade, in
which the speed of cooling air flow is
limited to a Mach Number of slightly less
than one to prevent choking of the flow,
the permissible increase in gas tempera-
/OOO
to
COOLWO MS
MACH NO.
(Continued from page 9)
ture is approximately 600° F. The
amount of cooling air required is about
16% by weight of the hot-gas flow.
The analyses showed that only the cool-
ing air immediately adjacent to the inter-
nal blade surface is effectively utilized for
cooling the blade in the critical region
near the root. It also showed that the
necessary high cooling air velocities could
be maintained, and the quantity reduced
by using an insert in the hollow blade.
From Fig. 3 it can be seen that with a
coolant flow of only 5%, about 1/3 of the
flow required without the insert, the per-
missible increase in gas temperature is
750° F. This makes a turbine-inlet tem-
perature of about 2300° F. possible.
A point in favor of air cooling is the
availability of cold air and the ease with
which it can be directed to the inside of
the blades. Also, the losses are very small
because the cooling air is put back into the
jet in the discharge nozzle. In fact, it is
theoretically possible that cooling air,
whose pressure is greatly increased not
only because of the heat absorbed, but also
because of the centrifugal force, can more
than nullify the work done in compress-
ing it by being directed in such a way as
to impart a reaction to the wheel.
Liquid Cooling
Since liquids conduct heat much faster
than air, it is logical to investigate the pos-
sibilities of liquid cooling. Several prob-
lems present themselves, however, which
make this method difficult. First, a closed
cooling system would probably be neces-
sary to prevent waste of the fluid, in which
case coolant consumption would be of the
same vital interest as fuel consumption.
The fluid would probably flow radially
outward through one passage in each blade
and inward through another. Secondly,
there would have to be a radiator some-
where in the system to cool the fluid for
reuse. Not only would this present a
problem of passing fluid from a station-
ary radiator to a rapidly rotating wheel,
but also would incur large losses from the
radiator.
The NACA found that the coolant
passages in the blades should be circular
in cross section to minimize bending
stresses, and that the metal surrounding
the passages should have a considerable
thickness. This indicates a relatively thick
blade.
It is to be expected that the parts of
the blade farthest from the coolant pas-
sages, usually the trailing edge, will be at a
higher temperature than other parts.
/OOO

DILUTION, COOLANT
F/G. 3
When blades with a conductivity of 15,
typical of high temperature alloys, was
used in a static test with a gas flow at
2000°F. the trailing edge temperature was
1700° F. When blades with a conductiv-
ity of 100, about that of aluminum, were
used the trailing edge temperature was
1100°. This makes it appear that liquid
cooling is not very practical. However,
the blades in this test were stationary and
there is evidence that the gas temperature
cools in the boundary layer of rotating
blades as the gas proceeds along the
blades. Consequently, these trailing edge
temperatures probably correspond more
nearly to turbine inlet temperatures of
3000° F. than the 2000° F. used in the
analysis.
The losses mentioned earlier, that are
incurred in liquid cooling, would seem-
ingly detract from the desirability of this
method. However, even when these losses
are considered, the effect of increasing the
turbine inlet temperature from 1500° F.
(with no cooling losses) to 3000° (with
cooling losses) is to double the specific
output, measured in pounds thrust per
pound of air per second. At the same
time, the specific fuel consumption is
actually decreased. Therefore, the ad-
vantages may, by far, overshadow the diffi-
culties and disadvantages of this method.

which limit the opportunities of employees
of other companies to change their posi-
tions.
Civil Service technical work and ammu-
nition research and development in par-
ticular utilize the theoretical, experimental,
inventor and technical-administrator types
of individuals; and therein is to be found
an opportunity for the employee to de-
velop his natural bent on the basis of
experience and performance. Through the
experience and background gained by ex-
perimental work, the individual can gravi-
tate toward the theoretical, inventive or
administrative work which will satisfy his
personal urges and utilize his optimum
capacity for service to the organization.
It is against such a background that the
ammunition engineer and scientist can de-
vote himself to his work with a feeling of
long-range certainty greater than is
generally practicable in industrial em-
ployment. This often permits the indi-
vidual to plan and consummate part-time,
additional training along professional
lines as well as personal economic plans.
In addition to the salary received by a
Civil Service employ there are other re-

or death, such an accumulation of leave
can be considered a very valuable insur-
ance policy available to the employee
without cost. Opportunity to purchase
insurance at less cost than that of commer-
cial insurance also is available to Civil
Service employees.
Civil Service employees can obtain
patents without cost under certain condi-
tions and are entitled to the commercial
rights inherent on these, the Government
and its agents being entitled to free use
of such patents. While patents generally
are not financially remunerative, there
have been instances of employees being
able to dispose of or receive royalties for
the commercial rights of patents obtained
on the basis of work done for the Gov-
ernment. The opportunity to obtain pat-
ents represents the possibility of acquiring
professional recognition and prestige addi-
tional to that received for the publication
of technical papers.

quires the contribution by the employee of

turns which must be considered as addi-
tional compensation for services. Each
employee is entitled to 26 working days of
annual leave and 15 days sick leave;
and these are cumulative to 60 and 90
days, respectively. The employee there-
fore accumulate a backlog of 30 weeks of
leave available for use in a major emer-
gency. As accumulated annual leave is
paid for in case of resignation, retirement
An employee with 30 years of service can
retire at age 60 with a pension of 45 per
cent of the average for his highest salary
for five consecutive years. Any addi-
tional service increases the annual pension
by 1.5 per cent of the average salary for
each year. If the employee has at least 30
years of service, he can elect to retire at
the minimum age of 55 and receive a pen-
sion of 85 per cent of that he would re-
ceive if aged 60. It is believed that this
pension system is superior with respect to
pensions and flexibility to any offered by
industry or universities. Should an em-
ployee leave the Civil Service prior to be-
coming eligible for retirement, he can
elect to leave his deductions on deposit
and receive a deferred pension based on
his salary and length of service. The pen-
sion system therefore must be considered
a major advantage and actually a form of
additional compensation.
To enter upon a career in ammunition
technology it is necessary to establish
eligibility for appointment by passing a
Civil Service examination. Information
concerning these examinations is available
from the Civil Service Commission at
Washington, D.C. and the Civil Service
Board at Picatinny Arsenal, the require-
ments being given in the announcements
of the examinations. Those for the low-
est professional designation correspond
roughly with those for a bachelor's degree
in a physical science or one of the
branches of engineering.
Added training or experience is eval-
uated and contributes to the grades given
on examinations taken, particularly when
these are non-assembled. Special training
which is an asset to those contemplating a
career in ammunition technology is ob-
tainable by taking courses which are avail-
able in Ordnance units of ROTC organi-
zations. The passing of such courses is of
distinct advantage to those desiring to
qualify for a position and of value after
entering upon the position. Even if not
followed by a career in ordnance, the pos-
session of such training may be of value
to the technologist in time of emergency,
and special Ordnance training should be
taken if available.
In closing, it should be mentioned that
in addition to the professional and eco-
nomic rewards accruing to the engineer
and scientist during a career as an Ord-
nance technologist, there is a purely per-
sonal reward in the feeling that one has
contributed to the welfare of his nation
by his efforts toward its defense. This
contribution is as real and onerous as
that of the front-line man and calls for
his qualities of training, skill, initiative
and leadership.

"How fasti"
That speedometer on your car's instru-
ment panel is a result of many centuries
of attempts by men to find ways to meas-
ure speed and distance covered by a mov-
ing vehicle.
The attempts go back long before the
Christian era. Horse-drawn vehicles once
had revolving drums geared to one wheel.
The drums contained pebbles, which fell
into a basin at fixed intervals. Men count-
ed the pebbles to see how far they'd gone.
Before the turn of the present century,
trains, street cars and bicycles had crude
speed and distance indicators. But not
until automobiles became popular were
speedometers perfected.
Joseph W. Jones of New York City is
credited with inventing the first U. S.
automobile speedometer in 1901. In 1908
Jones also invented the first taxi meters
used in U. S.
As late as 1925, speedometers were
extra-cost items on a large portion of all
new cars. Today they're standard equip-
ment—and the firms that make them have
so improved them and cut their cost that
they'r used, with minor adjustments, as
tachometers that count the number, speed
and hours of revolutions in all sorts of
machinery.
Today's speedometers are built with
the precision of fine timepieces. Nearly
all assembly work is done by women, for
they excel men in this skilled work. Some
parts are so small that they're assembled
by a sense of touch, then checked with
microscopes.
The speedometer has a flexible drive
cable geared to the car's transmission.
Each 1,000 turns of the cable register one
mile on the mileage indicator.
But the speed indicator has no gears.
It's moved by magnetic currents that in-
crease in force as the cable spins faster.
The magnetic pull is adjusted to a finely
calibrated hairspring that seeks constantly
to pull the speed indicator back to zero.
The factory sets the speedometer to
read, at high speeds, a few miles faster
than actual speed. This is done because
as car speeds increase, tires expand and
fewer turns cover more distance.
"Bifocal Radar"
Mobility is the keynote of a two-screen
radar set which has been tested recently
aboard the Great Lakes ore carrier Leon
Fraser you've read about here before.
(Continued from page 16)
This set, developed at General Electric,
is the result of a search for radar which
could cope with the narrow channels and
harbors of the Great Lakes, as well as
open waters of the oceans of the world.
The set is versatile: it may be lowered
or raised at will for perfect eye-level ad-
justment, and may be trained in any for-
ward position to afford better viewing by
personnel of the moving shop.
The "bifocal" appellation stems from
the use of seven- and twelve-inch scopes.
The former, a "safety" scope, gives a radar
picture of a two-mile radius at all times.
The larger screen, a "working" scope, is
adjustable to one-half, one, three, eight,
20, or 40 miles in any direction.
Film Fan's Note
Brighter and surer screening of motion
pictures is possible now for users of 8-
mm and 16-mm projectors as a result of a
major improvement in the construction of
movie projection lamps.
After years of effort, General Electric
engineers have devised a method of form-
ing mechanically the complex filament
used in those projection lamps. Formerly,
even after many months' experience, a
skilled girl could only form filaments for
about 80 projection lamps a day.
Poised for Poison
Although it was designed primarily to
indicate poisonous mercury-vapor concen-
trations, General Electric's instantaneous
electronic mercury-vapor detector can whiff
and report such vapors as ozone, illu-
minating gas, benzene, and pyridine.
Guardians of workers' safety in manu-
facturing plants and shops where certain
dangerous vapors may lurk, these detectors
are now owned and used by governments
of at least 16 states.
A Buss with Design
The American Brake Shoe Company,
with 10,000 employees working in 60
plants in 23 states and Canada, believes
firmly and strongly in the value of periodic
chest x-rays.
First the company used a station wagon
to haul its mobile film x-ray unit. Then,
just recently, it went all the way and ac-
quired a G-E photo-roentgen bus that's
especially designed for mobile survey
work.
Where the company formerly felt lucky
if it could survey 10 plants' employees in
a year, it's now in a position to cover
least half the 60 plants and all their em-
ployees in that period. The eventual aim,
however, is to survey each plant 100 per
cent once a year.
Incidentally, the task of conducting the
surveys is handled by one technician who
drives the bus and takes and develops the
films. He's assisted by nurses stationed at
the various plants.
* * *
An experimental type of radio receiver,
designed at General Electric, has picked
up Australian short-wave broadcasts that
are as free of static and fading as those
from local stations. The receiver has also
picked up clear signals from "hams" in
the Caribbean area. However, short-wave
fans are warned that this experimental de-
vice still has a long way to go on the road
to development, and that, for the time
being, anyway, they will have to grin and
bear the static.
Junior's A Character
"Junior" is a General Electric demon-
stration refrigerator. He might be said to
resemble a wooden soldier, complete with
shako and epaulets. Furthermore, he walks
and talks.
On tour, "Junior" was wowing the
crowds in one midwestern store with his
un-refrigerator-like activity, when an alert
salesman asked a woman in the audience
if she wouldn't like one "just like that."
"Mercy no," she squealed. "I don't
want any refrigerator running around my
kitchen."
Man-Made Gale
The world's largest supersonic wind-
tunnel in which winds of about 1500-
mile-per-hour velocity can be produced,
has been unveiled in Cleveland by the Na-
tional Advisory Committee for Aeronau-
tics. The tunnel's drive system was de-
signed and built by General Electric.
This man-made gale is created by an air
compressor with over a thousand blades,
driven by three 29,000-hp electric motors
hooked in tandem to a single drive shaft
—the most mechanical power ever placed
on a single shaft by electric motor drive.
Because of the great size of the motors,
General Electric found it necessary to
build regulators that are physically the
largest, carry the highest electric current
power, and dissipate the greatest amount
of energy of any regulators ever designed.

Xenon. Occurring in the atmosphere in concentration of one part per million for
Krypton, and one part per twelve million for Xenon, their very scarcity gave them
the status of "scientific curiosities" for a long time.
But now, these gases arc available in quantity in refined, compressed form.
As these gases assume the different role of "new" materials, their individual physi-
cal and electrical properties are finding interesting uses.
The increased efficiency of hot cathode (fluorescent) lights is a direct result
of using Krypton as the gas filler. The brightest light ever made by man is pro-
duced by an electrical discharge through a column of Krypton ... these lights are
used to penetrate fog at airports.
Xenon is replacing mercury vapor in industrial (thyratron) tubes, to avoid
low temperature condensation troubles. It is Xenon that makes practical the
"repeater" (gas discharge) photographic flash lamp—the low resistance and good
spectral range of the gas both being important. In the fast-growing field of atomic
energy, the rare gases become increasingly important. The use of such gases in
Geiger Mueller counter tubes is well familiar.
Chemists and physicists on many types of projects will want to study the
possible value of these gases in their fields. Others may desire to work with the
rare gases as such, contributing to further information in this expanding subject.
Graduate students especially may find rare gages a fascinating, challenging, and
wide open field for doctoral thesis.
In whatever connection, scientists who may want more information on Kryp-
ton, Xenon, Argon, etc., are invited to write us fully. Please write Dept. LAP,

Glass that you can twist, bend, roll...
This is a ribbon of glass so thin that it
takes about one thousand thicknesses of it
to make a stack an inch high.
It is so flexible that you can roll it on a
reel, twist it into a spiral, wrap it around
your arm.
If you should test it electrically, as
Corning scientists have done thousands
upon thousands of times, you'd find that
it has superior electrical insulating and
dielectric properties—equal to high-grade
mica.
One of the first experimental uses of
Corning ribbon glass has been to alternate
strips of it with metal foil and fuse them
together to make electrical capacitors—or
condensers—similar to those made of
mica for television, radio, and other elec-
tronic equipment.
Ribbon glass capacitors, which can be
uniformly produced by machine, have al-
ready shown many advantages over those
made with other materials.
Being hermetically sealed, they need no
enclosing case. They can operate at tem-
peratures which are too high for other
capacitors to withstand. They do not de-
teriorate with age or continued use. Small
ones can do the job of conventional capac-
itors of larger size. And for certain instal-
lations only a ribbon glass capacitor will
serve.
And Corning research indicates that mak-
ing capacitors is not the only problem that
ribbon glass may solve. It can be laminated
with resin and then cut, formed, shaped
and used for other electrical purposes.
Because ribbon glass is uniformly thin,
it has already been considered for such
other uses as microphone diaphragms and
windows for Geiger counters that measure
radio-activity.
Glass ribbon is another striking example
of how Corning, noted for its Pyrex brand
products, has developed glass into a most
versatile engineering material.
That's why we invite you—when you've
finished school and started work—to call
in Corning before your product planning
reaches the blueprint stage. Corning Glass

this mass-energy relationship, note that if one kilogram of a
substance were entirely converted to energy, 25 billion kw.
would be produced. It also explains the continual light radiated
from the stars.
The two classical laws of the conservation of mass and energy
are not independent of one another because matter and energy
are interchangeable. Since mass is a form of energy, conserva-
tion of energy alone is retained.
The above concepts comprise the Special Theory of Relativity.
General Theory of Relativity
The limitations of the Special Theory of Relativity encour-
aged Einstein to probe further into the laws of nature in order
to derive a more comprehensive description of the universe.
Most of the Special Theory has been verified by extensive ex-
perimentation, but proof of some of the principles involved in
General Relativity can not be obtained with any degree of cer-
tainty. Because of this limited support, the validity of General
Relativity is still being questioned.
Space-Time Continuum
A continuum is a continuous thing. For example, the position
of a train on a track can be described as a one dimensional con-
tinuum by an observer at the station. The longitude and latitude
of a ship at sea would be a two dimensional continuum, while
the position of an airplane would be three dimensional, ie.,
longitude, latitude and altitude. In order to describe a physical

event involving motion, not only must position in three dimen-
sional space be indicated, but we must also state how position
changes in time. This concept is called a four dimensional space-
time continuum. The fourth dimension is not a quantity that can
be physically illustrated, but is an inseparable part of the space-
time continuum in which we live.
Because of our narrow subjectivity, we tend to separate space
and time, but objectively, one can not be detached from the other
any more than height can be separated from width and depth in
describing a building. For example, what we call noontime is
nothing more than a certain position of the earth and sun in
space.
Contemplating the stars, we might say a galaxy is seen "now."
However, we can not ascertain where the stars are at this moment
because the light that strikes the eye left the stars millions of
years ago. If we break down the picture to three subjective
space dimensions and one of local time, these galaxies have
little objective existence. They attain physical reality only in
their proper frame of reference, which is the four dimensional
space-time continuum.
Motion
If all the objects in the universe were removed save one, no
one could say whether that one remaining object was at rest or
hurtling through the void. Motion is a relative state; unless there
is some system to which it may be compared, it is meaningless to
speak of the motion of a single body.
An observer in a smothly running train can not tell by experi-
ments performed inside the train whether he is in motion or
at rest. Only when the train's velocity is changed can he be made
aware of his motion. This suggests that nonuniform motion,
such as that produced by forces and acceleration, may be absolute
after all. It also suggests that empty space can serve as a system
of reference within which it is possible to distinguish a certain
type of absolute motion.
This apparently unique character of nonuniform motion is not
in agreement with the universal harmony of nature. The Special
Theory referred only to systems moving uniformly. The basic
premise of the General Theory of Relativity states that the laws
of nature are the same for all systems regardless of their states of
motion.
Gravitation
According to Newton's Law of Inertia, every body continues
in its state of rest or uniform motion unless acted upon by some
force. A second law states that the amount of force necessary
to accelerate a body depends on the mass of the body. However,
as Galileo discovered, two bodies of different mass will fall at
the same rate of acceleration, neglecting air resistance. New-
ton's solution to this phenomenon was his Law of Gravitation
which states that the force of attraction between two bodies in-
creases with the mass of the attracted body in the degree neces-
sary to overcome the inertia of the object.
This remarkable balance was accepted on faith for 300 years.
Einstein's inherent distrust of dogma led him to question some
of Newton's assumptions. Out of his objections, he evolved a
new theory of gravitation which, experience has shown, gives a
more accurate picture of nature than Newton's classic law.

Of course not! Even if the "falling apple" myth
were true, it would have merely been a
meaningless annoyance to Sir Isaac Newton
without his extensive background of reading and
research. But he was able to apply principles
learned in years of study to an apparently accidental
phenomenon, and to come up with a whole new theory of
physical relationships.
You too will find that your progress in business, practice
or research will depend on the background of knowledge
and techniques learned while you are in school. The books you
use today will never be discarded—they will go with
you as long as you are active in your chosen field. Of course,
many of them will bear the McGraw-Hill imprint because
McGraw-Hill is the world's leading publisher of scientific and
technical works both for learning and for reference.
After graduation, with school behind you, you will find
that constant advances in your field emphasize
the importance of continual reading and the value
of keeping a close check on new products
resulting from new and improved techniques.
Keep up by studying both the editorial
and advertising content of the McGraw-Hill
magazine devoted to your field.
Today in school and tomorrow in
business or practice, you will
find that your progress depends on
your up-to-the-minute knowledge
of your field. And, McGraw-Hill

elevator car that is falling. These men
do not know what is happening so they
perform some experiments within the car.
When they take keys out of their pockets
and release them from their grasp, the re-
leased objects fall at the same speed as the
elevator, so they appear poised in midair.
To the men within the car it seems they
have been transported outside of the
gravitational field. An object pushed in
any direction will continue to move in a
straight line. Most important, the men
can not be certain whether they are falling
in a graviatational field or are floating in
empty space, free of external forces.
Taking another hypothetical situation,
the physicists in the elevator really are
suspended in empty space. A cable attach-
ed to the roof of the car is mysteriously
pulling the elevator up. When they re-
lease an object, it will seem to fall to the
floor. Objects thrown horizontally will
describe a parabolic curve in falling. Once
again, there is no way for the men to tell
whether they are at rest in a gravitational
field or ascending through gravity-free
space.
RELATIVITY
(Continued from page 28)
If the car were attached to the outside
of a revolving wheel, the side of the car
furthest from the center of the wheel
would seem to be the floor to the men in-
side. The outside observer would quickly
recognize this not as gravity, but as cen-
trifugal force. Again the physicists can
not be sure they are at rest in a gravita-
tional field. In empty space, "up" or
"down" does not exist.
From these fanciful occurrences, Ein-
stein formulated the Principle of Equiva-
lence of Gravitation and Inertia. It states
that there is no way to distinguish the
motion produced by inertial forces from
motion produced by gravitational force.
This is illustrated in the similar effect of
inertia and gravity produced on an aviator
when making a sharp bank turn or pulling
out of a dive.
This principle solves the riddle of "ab-
solute" nonuniform motion. It shows that
the effects of nonuniform motion, which
can supposedly reveal the state of motion
of a body even if it exists alone in space,
are indistinguishable from the effects of
gravitation.
Newton described gravitation as an at-
tracting force between bodies. This illu-
sion has grown out of erroneous mechani-
cal concepts of nature. Einstein's Law of
Gravitation describes the behavior of ob-
jects in a gravitational field in terms of
the paths they follow, their inherent in-
ertia, and the properties of the space-time
continuum. This becomes plausible when
one dismisses the notion that bodies can
exert a force of attraction on one another
across millions of miles of empty space.
For instance, in describing the action of
magnets, the scientist does not say at-
traction. He describes the magnetic field
structure and the properties of the sur-
rounding medium. Similarly, Einstein set
forth a group of laws describing the mass
of a gravitating body and the structure of
the field around it. A second group of
laws analyzes the paths described by mov-
ing bodies in gravitational fields.
According to the Special Theory of
Relativity, light, which is a form of en-
ergy, has mass and should therefore be
affected by a gravitational field. By ob-
serving the deflection of a distant star's

UNIT HEATING...
its uses and advantages
Where it is used Unit heating is widely used in in-
dustrial plants and warehouses, garages, stores and
public buildings where the following advantages are
important.
Low first cost Unit heaters are so efficient and so
compact thai their heating capacity is often equivalent
to the capacity of cast iron radiation or pipe coils of
twice the cost. Additional savings are effected because
the system requires a proportionately smaller amount
of pipe, fittings and accessories.
Economy of operation Heat is forced down to the
working level... not banked uselessly at the ceiling
level. Heat is turned on and off merely by throwing a
switch either manually or automatically by simple
thermostatic controls. The rapid response means that
heat is furnished only when and where it is wanted ...
no heat is wasted.
Heating comfort Unit heaters provide quick heating
from a cold start. Desired temperatures are easily main-
tained within a close range. Heat is uniformly distrib-
uted in the working zone by forced air circulation. It
is a very flexible system because different or changing
heating requirements are easily satisfied by means of
different models, a range of capacities, single- or two-
speed motors and individual thermostatic controls.
Adaptability to equipment and floor layout The
units and the simple piping are overhead where they
do not interfere with arrangement of operating machin-
ery or equipment and do not take up valuable floor or
wall space. Units are easily relocated at any time to
meet changes in plant layout or heating requirements.
Thermolier unit heaters have important construc-
tion advantages The design of Thermolior unit heat-
ers is the product of Grinnell Company's ninety-nine
years of beating experience. Those responsible for
heating like Thermolier's durability, freedom from
maintenance troubles and dependable operation. Typ-
ical of its construction features is the patented internal
cooling leg which permits the use of a plain thermo-
static trap, the simplest, least expensive kind of trap.
Other features are built-in drainage, continuous rated
capacity and provision for expansion of U-tubes.

light passing through the sun's gravita-
tional field, this theory was experimentally
verified.
Another Einstein prediction borne out
by the stars concludes that if a clock or
active atom were transported from the
earth to the sun, it would run or radiate
at a slower frequency because of the
change in the gravitational field.
The Universe
The most remarkable of Einstein's as-
sumptions is that the universe is not a
rigid and immutable edifice where inde-
pendent matter is housed in independent
space and time. It is on the contrary an
amorphous continuum, constantly subject
to change and distortion. Just as a fish
swimming in the sea agitates the water
around it, so a star distorts the geometry
of the space-time continuum through
which it moves.
The validity of General Relativity is
supported by the solution of astronomical
problems which were solved incorrectly
with Newtonian law.
As shown by the action of light in a
gravitational field, Euclidean geometry
does not hold true. Because of the geom-
(Continued from page 30)
etry of this field, the shortest distance a
light ray can travel is a great circle. Each
celestial body creates a distortion or local
irregularity in the space-time continuum.
The greater the concentration of matter,
the greater is the resulting curvature of
space-time. The combined distortions
cause the continuum to bend back on its-
self in a great cosmic curve.
The Einstein universe is non-Euclidean
and finite. Space, though finite, is
unbounded in its three dimensions of
space and one of time just as the two
dimensional surface of a sphere is. The
universe cannot be physically visualized,
but can be described mathematically.
Einstein showed that material content
determines the curvature of space. After
years of study, astronomer Edwin Hubble
concluded that the density of the universe
as a whole is 1C)-30 gm/cc. The Einstein
field equations yielded a positive curvature
which in turn reveals the radius of the
universe to be 35 billion light years or
21 x 1022 miles.
At first, Einstein was unaware of the
unity in the seemingly random motion of
stars and galaxies. Most astronomers now
agree that outlying galaxies are receding
from us and from one another. The result
is an expanding universe. Calculations
based on the velocities of receding
galaxies show that they must have separ-
ated and started their flight from the
originally dense center of this universe
about two billion years ago. This figure
is in agreement with the calculations of
geophysicists studying rocks and radio-
active materials.
The principle of Relativity has contrib-
uted much to the understanding of na-
ture's functions. Nevertheless, when we
wonder where the original essence of the
universe came from, we run into the limi-
tations and indeterminacy so often found
in nuclear physics. The creation of the
universe is a sort of line of demarcation
between physics and philosophy. Theoret-
ical physicists continue probing into the
abyss of ignorance and misconception with
the hope that someday they might be able
to tell us all about the how, when and
where of the universe.

YOUNG SCIENTISTS ARE BUILDING
CAREERS WITH DU PONT FROM
CONNECTICUT TO TEXAS
When you think of Du Pont research,
you may think first of Wilmington,
Delaware. Actually, only eight of the
Company's 36 research groups are
located there. Du Pont scientists now
pursue their studies in 11 states scat-
tered from Connecticut to Texas.
Each of these laboratories is a self-
contained operation. It may be de-
voted in part to fundamental re-
search and applied research, or to
investigations looking to the devel-
opment of new products—sometimes
a combination of these activities.
An unusual Du Pont laboratory
is one opened last year at Newburgh,
New York.
Inside the Laboratory
In the three-story building at New-
burgh, scientists have at their dis-
posal the most modern equipment
for study of coated fabrics and plas-
tic sheetings under all sorts of con-
ditions. For example, a new product
can be tested in a room maintained
at a temperature of -20° F. In other
rooms, the effects of high tempera-
ture and humidity can be studied.
Equipment is available for testing
tensile strength, tear resistance, fad-
ing, flex and flame resistance, and
many other characteristics. One of
Du Font's 33 libraries has quarters
in the building; there is a photo-
graphic darkroom, as well as offices,
conference and work rooms.
The Newburgh Laboratory works
closely with the adjacent plant, which
makes "Fabrikoid" pyroxylin coated
fabrics, "Fabrilite" vinyl resin coated
fabrics and plastic sheetings, "Ton-
tine" washable window shade cloth,
bookbinding materials, and other
coated and impregnated fabrics and
plastic sheetings for many uses.
Research at Du Pont
Research has long been a major ac-
tivity at Du Pont, and it flourishes
in an atmosphere of appreciation,
encouragement and patience. The
new products, the new plants, and
the new and better jobs of the years
to come will develop from the pains-
taking research programs being car-
ried on today in the laboratories.

Choice of Careers
Each of the Du Pont manufacturing
departments conducts continuous
research. They operate much like
separate companies, with interests
ranging from heavy chemicals to
plastics and textile fibers. Each hokb
challenging opportunities for college-
trained chemists and physicists, as
well as chemical, civil, electrical, in-
dustrial and mechanical engineers,
also those specializing in production,
sales and many other fields.
In this alert, ever-growing organi-
zation, young graduates can choose
from a variety of careers the one
that suits them best as their ability
and interests develop.

Egypt. And again, it seems unlikely that civilization would
have progressed appreciably beyond levels reached prior to A.D.
1500 had not a way been found to harness additional amounts
of energy per capita per year by exploiting the resources of
nature in a new form.
Such a way was, of course, found in the invention of steam
and internal combustion engines. By means of these devices a
vast reservoir of energy was tapped and made available for
culture building. And, again, as in the case of the Agricultural
Revolution, the consequences of the use of fuels have been
enormous and significant. As technologies change, so will
political, economic and social systems change. And as modern
technology transforms our social systems, new philosophies are
engendered. Thus our whole cultural life is profoundly altered
by the revolution in technology.
It is difficult to realize that we are in the midst of a great
cultural revolution for the reason that it began so recently and
has moved so swiftly. Western civilization in A.D. 1800 was
more like the cultures of ancient Greece and Rome than it is
like our own today. And look at the technological changes that
have taken place since 1900—or since World War I! These
profound and rapid changes are due directly to the harnessing
of fuel energies. Seventy-five percent of all the coal, and 97
percent of all oil production and consumption in history has
taken place since 1900—within the lifetime of the present
writer! The great world wars of this century and their after-
math of revolutionary political and economic change are merely
the social consequences of technological change and progress.
It is not conflicting ideologies that cause wars between nations.
It is technological and social change that finds expression in
new and conflicting ideologies.
Modern civilization is of course parasitic upon the past.
When the deposits of coal and oil have been consumed, culture
will suffer a tremendous regression unless the present energy
supply can be maintained by harnessing natural forces in some
new form. Already in the present decade we have witnessed
the inauguration of a new era in technological development: the
harnessing of nuclear energy. Whether this new technique is to
be a builder or a restroyer of culture remains to be seen. And in
any event, the earth's supply of fissionable materials seems to
be rather limited so that civilization, if it is to survive the next
war and continue to progress in the future as it has in the past,
will ultimately be thrown upon the radiation of the sun as its
chief, and perhaps its direct, source of energy for the continua-
tion and further development of culture.
Many critical questions about the future confront us today.
We can do little more than speculate about the specific and par-
ticular course of ecents of the future. But of one thing we may
be quite sure: technology will determine and shape the future
of civilization as it has its past. From the stone axe and spear,
the hoe and the plow, the ox and the wheel, the steam engine
and dynamo, to uranium piles and whatever devices to harness
energy the future may bring, the course of civilization, of man's
social systems and his philosophies, has been and will be deter-
mined by technology.
For a fuller treatment of this theme see the chapter "Energy and
the Evolution of Culture" in The Science of Culture: a Study of Man
and Civilization, by Leslie A. White (New York, Farrar, Straus &amp;
Co., 1949).

For many years, ADVERTISEMENTS SUCH AS
THIS ONE have appeared regularly in leading
business magazines. Their primary purpose is
to build acceptance for Square D Field Engineers,
practically all of whom come to us from
leading engineering schools such as yours.
Picture a Square D Field Engineer
trying to run fi/w/i&lt; Business
• What he doesn't know about your busi-

including yours.
Square D Field Engineers throughout
this country, in Canada and Mexico, are
constantly working with industries of every
type and size, helping find that "better
way to do It"—electrically.
If you have a problem in electrical dis-

satisfactory ceramic coating to protect the
turbine blades from the intense heat, none
has yet been evolved that meets all require-
ments. Such a material would not only be
required to withstand high temperatures
and have a high resistance to thermal
shock, but also the bonding between the
ceramic and the blade would have to with-
stand the high tensile stresses imparted by
the centrifugal stresses. It is possible that
the gas turbine may benefit along this line
from research being done in rocket de-
sign, in which temperatures up to 5500°
F. must be resisted. The NACA found,
in tests with non-rotating blades, that a
coating 1/100 of an inch thick, with a
conductivity of 2.5 (about that of thorium
oxide), would allow an increase of
450° F. in effective gas temperature. Cera-
mic coatings also protect the metal from
the erosive effects of the gases.
The ceramic coatings are applied in the
form of water suspensions to cleaned
specimens by either dipping or spraying.
After drying, the pieces are fired at a tem-
perature of 2150° F. in oxygen-free at-
mosphere. Some coatings have high re-
sistance to thermal shock while others have
good resistance to high temperatures.
One coating consists of (1) a base coat
of a low-expansion frit with 20% zirconia
added, (2) a cover coat containing 95%
zirconia and (3) a seal coat consisting of
a thin application of the same composition
as the base coat.
In drawing a conclusion, the methods
considered may be limited to air cooling
and liquid cooling since rim cooling was
found to be relatively ineffective towards
increasing the available power. Boundary
layer cooling should be included, also, but
very little has been released on it.
Since ceramic coatings can increase the
allowable gas temperatures 450° F., the
allowable inlet temperature can be in-
creased to about 2750° F. with air cool-
ing and 3450° F. with liquid cooling. The
latter is about the maximum temperature
present day fuels are capable of producing.
This means that, with the use of these
cooling methods, more than three times as
much power can be obtained from a
lighter engine with a lower specific fuel
consumption.

of an industrial world!

by CARL MALMBERG
Superintendent, Tank and Plate Shop
ALLIS-CHALMERS MANUFACTURING CO.
WEST ALLIS WORKS
(Graduate Training Course—1930)
PRODUCTION METHODS have become a
good deal more technical and compli-
cated in the last few years. There is a big
difference between the way we do things
now and the way we
did them when I left
the Allis-Chalmers
Graduate Training
Course to work in the
machine shop in 1930.
That is \vhy there are
more and more op-
portunities in the
manufacturing end
of the business for
CARL MALMBERG yOung engineers who
get a thrill from watching a project grow
from a roll of blueprints to a big electric
power installation or machinery for a
giant processing plant.
Close Coordination
In my section of the shop we specialize in
fabricating machines and parts from sheet
and plate steel. We work closely with the
design engineers to develop the most eco-
nomical way of producing their designs
and we do much designing on our own.
We work closely with every other manu-
facturing department, because more and
more Allis-Chalmers products are being
designed to replace cast members with
welded members, and in my work we do

Welding stator yoke on 38,889 kva

Machining speed ring for a 55,000 hp turbine on a 40' boring mill, one of
the largest in the country. Many A-C machines and methods are unique
because of the tremendous size of work pieces and wide variety of operations
required in building the world's greatest range of industrial equipment.
the welding for the whole plant.
One recent interesting project was the
fabrication of stainless steel buckets for
impulse-type hydraulic turbines to replace
the old cast-type buckets. Working with
design engineers and hydraulic engineers,
our tank and plate specialists developed a
design and method of manufacturing that
produced buckets with several times the
life of the old type.
Opportunities Everywhere
New developments in every department
mean almost endless opportunities for
young engineers. Right now, the erection
shop is building a big crusher for process-
ing taconite in the Mesabi range, and we
are supplying most of the other ore proc-
essing equipment for this gigantic plant,
too. At our Norwood plant, engineers
have completely rebuilt the production
system on motors and small pumps for
greater efficiency and lower costs.
In fact, here at Allis-Chalmers there are
big opportunities for young engineers in
all phases of engineering work—design,
research and development, manufactur-
ing, sales and erection—in nearly any in-
dustry you can name. For Allis-Chalmers
builds primary equipment for electric
power... mining and ore processing ...
pulp and wood products . . . flour mill-
ing . . . steel. . . agriculture . . . public
works ... for every basic industry.
The thing that influenced me most when
I left the University cf Illinois to join
Allis-Chalmers, was the tremendous
breadth of opportunity. Some of my
friends from that GTC class of 1930 are
sales engineers now, some are design en-
gineers, some have traveled around the
world with erection crews. I chose manu-
facturing because I like to see things take
shape before my eyes. I tried a good many
things before I made my choice and my
choice has been good.

PROBLEM — You are designing an automobile
service car with a crane on the back end. You
are going to take power from the transmission
to drive the crane drum. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE SOLUTION — Use an S.S.White
power drive flexible shaft. Connect one end to
a take-off on the transmission and the other end
to the clutch which operates the crane drum—
simple, easy to install, good for positive, de-
pendable operation.

Here't how on* manufacturer did it on
o 3'/i-'on capacity crane. Shaft runs
of engine ipeed with gear reduction

This is just one of hundreds of remote control and
power drive problems to which S.S.White flexible
shafts provide a simple answer. Engineers will find
it helpful to be familiar with the range and scope of
these useful "Metal Muscles"* for mechanical bodies.

THE MECHANIC'S POINT OF VIEW
(Continued from page 19)
be due either to the radiator, engine block, or a combination of
these with other defects. Noises and knocks may be trans-
mitted through various routes and masses of metal with the
result that engine defects often are incorrectly diagnosed as
originating in the transmission or transfer case. This proposed
modification would enable the power plant and cooling system
easily to be checked, and any necessary repairs, corrections or
adjustments made before installation. The time saved would
be that spent in installing and then removing a faulty replace-
ment assembly. This time is estimated to be one and one-half
hours. The time of a vehicle in the shop for engine replace-
ment would be reduced by twenty-five to fifty per cent.
Accessibility to components located under the floor of the
cab is very unsatisfactory. It was suggested that a much larger
opening in the floor would greatly facilitate repairs on the
transmission and transfer case, steering gear, engine, and
clutch, (figs. 5 &amp; 6). Approximate reduction in man-hours
would be: transmission and transfer case, eighty percent;
steering gear, eighty-two percent; engine, fifty percent; and
clutch, sixty percent.
At this point the author wishes to bring to the attention of
the reader a truck on the civilian market the cab of which
swings forward and upward to expose the entire chassis. It
is power operated and lifts in thirty seconds on the turn of a
key. The entire front end, including radiator, engine, trans-
mission, front wheels and brakes, are exposed, and are ex-
tremely convenient for servicing, (figs. 7 &amp; 8). This innova-
tion greatly simplifies maintenance and has been greeted with
enthusiasm by many who have seen it.
There were other more general recommendations made to
make vehicle maintenance, less arduous. Some of them are
as follows:
Consideration must be given to the accessibility of not only
assemblies which are commonly replaced by field . . . main-
tenance personnel, but also to those which require periodic
adjustment, cleaning, and inspection. This accessibility must be
afforded by the minimum removal of other assemblies or struc-
tures. If such removal is found necessary, then the possibilities
of either relocation or redesign to facilitate removal must be
investigated. Quick-release fastening devices show considerable
promise for use in lightweight structures, such as access holes
covers, floor boards, and hood panels. Where possible, hoods
should be hinged to permit engine removal without prior re-
moval of the hood.
Where possible, accessories not organic to an essembly and
which require transfer from an unserviceable to a replacement
assembly should be relocated to preclude need for such transfer,
nuts often may be caged or welded in position to reduce need
for accessibility and to reduce the number of tools required to
remove a fastening.
Periodic inspection on vehicles used under arctic winter
conditions must be possible by personnel wearing heavy arctic
mittens. Fuel filters must be drainable without spillage of gaso-
line on the hands.
To aid mechanics unfamiliar with a particular vehicle,
points which require disconnection for power plant removal
should be clearly indicated by color marking.
Where necessery, aligning devices, such as dowels and guides,
must be used to aid in positioning heavy, bulky assemblies.

Efficiency in many mechanical devices is
often a matter of high speeds and low weight.
The resultant stresses make heavy demands
on parts, whether they be in aircraft or
automotive engines, machine tools or loco-
motives.
Molybdenum is the only alloying element
that gives steel the two vital necessities for
meeting such requirements—good harden-
ability and freedom from temper brittleness.
Molybdenum steels will also meet the
requirements of production economy.

All drain plugs for engines and gear
boxes must be identical in size and type
for a given vehicle with no special tools
required for their removal. Fastening de-
vices, such as bolts, nuts, and screws,
should be interchangeable where practic-
able. The use of lock washers permanently
attached to small screws will insure the
presence of the lock washers with the
screws. Too much time is now being
wasted in replacing lost or displaced lock
washers.
Certain designs of drive shaft's univer-
sal joints permit the needle bearing caps to
fall off upon disconnection of the univer-
sal joint from the companion flange. The
rescue, cleaning, and reassembly of small,
greasy needle bearings which have fallen
into dirt is an experience not soon forgot-
ten. The manufacturer can, and in some
instances does, avoid this deficiency by
spot welding a small retaining wire to the
caps.
A blank spline on splined shaft will
make impossible an incorrect alignment
of the universal joints with respect to each
other. Initial alignment for engagement
Figures 7 &amp; 8
of splined members can be made easier by
shallow counterboring of the female mem-
ber to provide a guide.
If the bolts used to attach an exhaust
pipe to an exhaust manifold are in bad
condition due to high temperature and
climatic conditions, their removal time is
excessive. The situation is aggravated
when the bolts have poor accessibility.
It is not unusual for the bolts to twist
two during removal. If the bolt happens
to be a cap screw, then a screw extractor
must be used to remove the broken part re-
maining in the flange. There is reason
to believe that a quick-release, over-center
lever type of clamp installed in the ex-
haust pipe near the exhaust manifold is
entirely practicable.
Special tools are always a problem. It
is highly desirable to replace any vehicle
component with only those tools found in
the general mechanic's tool box.
Special materials or special treatments
provide resistance to rust and corrosion.
Quick-disconnect, polarized wiring
junctions reduce time required for dis-
connections, and preclude possibility of
erroneous connections. Self-sealing hy-
draulic quick-disconnects save time and
avoid loss of fluids.
The conception of a power package is
especially noteworthy. (Fig. 9) It con-
sists of the cooling system, engine, clutch,
transmission, and transfer case all replace-
able in one assembly. It represents an ad-

vancement of the unit replacement method
of field maintenance. If the vehicle is
designed with this conception in mind
the power package assembly can be re-
placed more quickly and easily than the
engine itself. Less skill likewise is re-
quired on the part of the mechanic for its
replacement. The time required for its
replacement is reasonably constant, there-
fore, is predictable within close limits.
Its use lessens the need for evacuation of
the complete vehicle to a higher category
of maintenance. It can be assembled, ad-
justed serviced, and tested on a stand or
bench prior to installation. This overall
testing and replacement will insure
trouble-free operation for a longer period
of time and reduce the down-time requir-
ed for the repair of the complete vehicle.
The recommendations of this program
are hailed by all mechanics, soldier and
civilian, professional and amateur. The
degree of effort required for maintaining a
vehicle has been increasing in direct
proportion with the complexity. It is high
time that design engineers took action to
reverse this trend. Often only a half hour

Every day, America's engineers
are performing miracles with
water ... creating vast, crystal lakes
where valleys were before .. . trans-
porting entire rivers across moun-
tains in steel pipe. But there's still
a big job to be done. For 108 million
Americans still lack adequate water
supplies, and 17 million acres could
be made into fertile farms with proper
irrigation.
The jobs at hand and the jobs
ahead will require steel in tremen-
dous quantities ... for pipe of large
diameter and small ... to reinforce
massive concrete dams ... for bridges
that carry pipe across broad streams
... for cables that suspend it across
yawning chasms.
It adds up to a tremendous task
for America s steelmakers. And it's
only one of steel's many tasks that
will utilize the services of thousands
of trained men, for steelmaking to-
day is a precision operation. Chemi-
cal and metallurgical laboratories
have assumed an importance equal
to that of roaring blast furnaces and
open hearths.
Preparing men for key positions
in the great steel industry is big
business at United States Steel. To-
day U.S. Steel has more people in
training than all but a few of Amer-
ica's greatest universities.

y(*»0t OF 85'000 YEARS OF K**^
If you had been born 85,000 years ago and were
still alive, think of all you would know about
what happened on earth.
And if you had devoted all those years to work-
ing with one particular material found on earth
. . . say aluminum . . . think what you would
know about that.
Actually, man has known of aluminum for less
than 150 years and didn't really start to use it
commercially until 1888 when Alcoa started pro-
ducing it. Yet in Alcoa's employ today is a group
of men and women who possess a total of 85,000
years of aluminum working knowledge.
These people, 2,900 of them, proudly wear this
button as members of the Alcoa 25-Year Service
Club. Many have been in the family longer than
25 years. Their jobs range all the way from mill
hand to president, from engineer to chairman of
the board. They are a fourth of all the employees
Alcoa had 25 years ago, pretty good indication
that it's "a good company to work for".
But here's the most significant point: Sixty-one
years ago, when Alcoa started, only five men
were employed. Today about a million people
have jobs in the aluminum industry, an industry
comprised of: companies who produce aluminum
from ore; companies who smelt aluminum scrap;
others who make semi-finished aluminum prod-
ucts; and hundreds of companies who manufac-
ture useful articles in which aluminum plays an
essential part.
Today the same pioneering spirit that marked
the founding of this industry is evident in
Alcoa's laboratories, mills and foundries. Here
men are developing new uses, new techniques
that promise even more for the future of alumi-

AND SERVO MECHANISMS
BY
ALVIN WEINSTEIN, '51ME
Forword
There are those skeptics outside of the
engineering profession who, in a rather
uncomplimentary manner, refer to engi-
neering as the "safety-factor profession."
The safety factor—the engineers' means
of adequate protection against unforsee-
able situations—is an integral part of our
lives both in and out of practice of engi-
neering. But the engineers' importance
lies not in the discriminate or indiscrim-
inate use, as the case may be, of the safety
factor. One of the engineers' major func-
tions is the determination of the quantity
or quantities to which the safety factor
may be applied. These quantities—the
characteristics of materials—are most
often found experimentally. Thus there
arises a branch of engineering that is fun-
damental to all engineering work: ma-
terials testing.
The testing of materials, though, is not
confined to structural devices alone. The
increasing postwar demand for synthetic
textiles and plastics has opened a new era
in materials testing. With this era has
come new problems—the most basic of
AUTHOR'S NOTE
This article is written as a technical
report; an attempt has been made, how-
ever, to supplement the technical matter
with a general discussion as to the func-
tion and design of the instrument. In
addition, the article reports certain
arrangements that have adequately ac-
complished the fundamental needs of
precision tensile testing.
The equipment described is a product
of the Instron Engineering Corp., Ouincy,
Mass. This corporation is the first to enter
the field of precision tensile testing with
a machine designed especially for this
purpose. Thus, the difficulties encounter-
ed by the co-inventors George S. Burr
and Harold Hindmarf may readily be
appreciated.
The inventors, the Instron Corp., and
the McGraw-Hill Publishing Co. are to
be thanked for supplying the necessary
data and for their patience in response
to inquiries by the author.
Introduction
In order to utilize materials of a plastic,

determine those quantities which are of
fundamental importance in the most effi-
cient and safe use of these products—
quantities such as modulus of elasticity,

yield point, tensile strength, and ultimate
strength.
These materials present difficulties,
however, in the determination of basic
characteristics. This is due to the com-
plexity of their physical properties. Un-
like metals, there are many characteristics
of textiles and plastics to be evaluated,
which are inter-related and are a function
of time.
Instrument Requirements
The more or less fragile nature of tex-
tiles and their susceptibility to light
changes of environmental conditions has
created the need for refined techniques in
measurement in the fields of research and
commercial development. Simple ultimate
strength measurements are of diminished
importance, for adequate description re-
quires other measurements such as in-
stantaneous elastic modulus, creep, relaxa-
tion and recovery—all with respect to
time as well as temperature and humidity.
In the design of a tensile test apparatus
to meet as many requirements as possible,
three major conditions were to be satis-
fied:
1. Considerable versatility of control
incorporated to provide methods for
varied load history.
2. The dynamic characteristics of the
machine should not obscure the proper-
ties to be measured.
3. There should be a wide range of
load sensitivies in order that accurate test-
ing can be performed on single fibers as
well as materials having relatively high
ultimate strength.
In this instrument, electronic principles
have been utilized in both the load weigh-
ing system and the drive mechanism to
achieve these results.
Design Principles
The weighing system for detecting and
recording the tensile load applied to the
test sample is based upon the use of elec-
tric strain gages. These gages, incorpor-
ated into interchangeable load cells to
cover the prescribed ranges, are arranged
in a Wheatstone bridge circuit, the out-
put of which is amplified to operate a re-
corder. The pulling jaw is mounted on a
moving crosshead (see fig. 1) motivated
by two vertical drive screws and an am-
plidyne-controlled positional servo-mech-
anism. The chart of the recorder is
driven synchronously at various speed
ratios with respect to the crosshead, so

tained with a wide choice of scale factors
for both load and extension.
The Load Weighing System
The circuit of the oscillator and ampli-
fier (fig. 2) is the integral part of the
load-weighing system. As will be shown,
the oscillator is 180° out of phase with
the grid voltage, the feedback voltage has
to be shifted the same amount in order
to supply voltage of the correct phase.
This is accomplished through the con-
denser-resistor arrangement in the circuit.
The output of the oscillator is set at 390
cycles and is fed to the phase discrimina-

the electronic control affords a very sensi-
tive system for measurement.
The line voltage, 115 v. AC, is rectified
via the conventional fullwave rectifier
diode "A" (in the lower right of fig. 2).
The two gas filled vacuum tubes "VR" act
as voltage regulators in order to obtain a
constant D.C. voltage by permitting a
drop in potential across them (in this
case 255 volts) less than in the maximum
rectified voltage, thus shearing off the
slightly fluctuating peak of the voltage
wave. This D.C. voltage from the recti-
fier is used to supply positive potential for
all tube plates in the circuit excepting the
ones in the phase discriminator.
The oscillator tube "B" starts function-
ing with the initial surge of D.C. current
through the inductance "L" of the trans-
former and the capacitors "C." The grid
voltage oscillates through the "LC" circuit
by alternate building up and discharging
of the condensers through the inductance.
The unavoidable loss due to resistance in
this circuit is replenished by the feedback
"F" from the plate. The D.C. voltage is
converted to A.C., whose frequency may
be varied by the variable capacitors. Since

tor via the amplifier "D" and the trans-
former "E." The out-put of the oscillator
is also fed to the load cell (through lines
network consisting of a 10-turn potentio
meter and a 10-step switch. These balance
controls allow large initial loads to be
balanced out without sacrificing sensitivity
of control.
A bending-beam arrangement is used
as the strain sensitive element in the load
cell. The actual load is transmitted to a
cantilever through a spindle supported
axially by means of diaphragms.
Before the load is applied, the zero is
adjusted on the recorder by means of the
balance controls. When a load is applied,
the bridge circuit gives out an A.C. signal
due to the resistance change of one of its
components. This causes an unbalanced
circuit, and current will now flow through
"O." The strain-sensitive element which
causes the unbalancing is attached to the
bending-beam element.
This signal output is supplied to the
pre-amplifier (I) through "O" and trans-
former "G." From the pre-amplifier (1),
the signal is sent through the attenuator
to amplifier II. The attenuator has a series
of stepped resistances as shown (fig. 2).
This selection is provided to vary the in-
put to amplifier II in order to obtain maxi-
mum selectivity for different loads. By
increasing the resistance for large loads,
when the output of the load cell is large,
the recorded load can be made a fraction
of the true load—thus providing a wide
range of sensitivity for a given load cell.
With the proper range selected the out-
put from the attenuator is directed
through amplifier II. From this second am-

provided with a constant source of positive

LUBRICATING OILS
The basic principles of refining crude
oil into fuels and lubricants are universal.
Stated simply, the procedure calls for the
separation of the crude petroleum into
certain constituent parts by distillation.
This method is practicable because each of
the products derived from crude oil has a
different boiling point.
The second step taken in the prepara-
tion of petroleum products for market
is specific processing. This processing is
dependent upon the physical nature of
each product and the purpose it is to
serve, either as a fuel, or as a lubricant.
Several of the processing methods will be
discussed later.
In the separation of a mixture of two

of continuous process. This has been sup-
plied by the development of the fraction-
ating column.
Fractionation, as we have seen, is a
process of continuous multiple distillation.
It makes possible the separation of ma-
terials of different degrees of volatility.
While one distillation effects only a par-
tial separation, repeated distillations result
in a more complete division of the differ-
ent materials desired. For the most part,
bubble towers are used to accomplish
fractionation in a continuous process.
Bubble Tower Operation
What happens inside a bubble tower
may be described as a washing process in
WEia.

hydrocarbon fractions of nearly the same
boiling point, with simple laboratory
equipment, the distillation of nearly the
same boiling point, with simple laboratory
equipment, the distillation must be re-
peated many times to obtain products simi-
lar to the two original materials. If such
a method were to be followed in the
treatment of thousands of barrels of crude
oil daily the cost would be prohibitive.
What is needed, obviously, is some sort
which a rising stream of vapor is washed
by a descending stream of liquid called
reflux. Two essential considerations are
necessary to get effective separation in a
bubble tower: (a) The greater the pro-
portion of falling liquid, or reflux, to ris-
ing vapor, the more thoroughly the vapors
are washed free of their heavier fractions;
(b) The effectiveness of the washing de-
pends upon the degree of contact between
the vapors rising from the crude oil and
the descending reflux. Without thorough
contact, effective separation is not pos-
sible.
Figure I shows an isometric sketch
of two bubble trays, showing the details of
construction. A cross section of one tray
illustrates how the reflux lies on the trays
and the manner in which vapors bubble
through it.
For all practical purposes, a bubble
cap is simply an inverted cap, of any
shape, with slotted edges. It is fixed to
a metal tray directly over a collar or vapor
nozzle which rises from a hole in the
bubble tray. When the reflux flows in the
tray its level is maintained at a height
greater than that of the alotted openings
in the bubble cap, but below the top of
the vapor nozzle. The rising vapor enters
the vapor nozzle in the tray from below.
Because of the covering cap and the level
of the reflux it can only escape by pass-
ing through the surrounding reflux. This
action can be seen clearly in the cross
section drawing. Here the reflux trickling
down the sides of the overflow pipe A
from the tray above has accumulated be-
hind the weir on that side until it runs
over onto the main surface of the tray.
The surface level of the reflux on the tray
is above the slots cut in the bottom edge
of each bubble cap, but is lower than the
top of the vapor nozzles. This forces the
rising vapors to pass through the reflux
before escaping to undergo the same
process on the tray above. The reflux
flows over the weir on the right where it
runs down overflow pipe B to the tray
below. There, the same process is re-
peated.
Our study of the drawing reveals that
the reflux moves down the tower and
from one side to the other while the ris-
ing vapors, indicated by the arrows, pass
through the vapor nozzles. The vapors
are then deflected downward by the top
of each bubble cap and are forced through
the reflux. Finally, they leave through the
bubble cap slots below the surface of the
reflux. As the vapors are released from
the reflux, they rise to the next tray above,
and go through the same process again.
In a bubble tower there are a large
number of these perforated trays, one

on from above, covers the top tray, over-
flows down to the next tray, and so on,
until a layer of liquid is formed on' each.
The vapors, on the other hand, enter the
bottom of the tower and have sufficient
pressure to force their way over the edges
of the vapor nozzles. Once through the
nozzles, the vapors bubbles through the
liquid to the surface. This intimate con-
tact between vapor and reflux is what is
described as scrubbing. As the vapors
come in contact with the liquid their
heavier, or higher boiling, fractions are
condensed in the liquid and are washed
down the tower.
The Distillation Process
As the heavier fraction condenses, it
gives off heat. This heat, in turn, is
used to vaporize an equivalent amount of
the lighter fraction. Hence, the vapors
formed from the reflux are richer in the
more volatile fractions than the reflux
itself. Likewise, the condensation of the
heavier fractions from the rising vapors
as they come in contact with the descent-
ing reflux serves to increase the volatility
of the vapor as it rises in the tower. The
overall result of this operation is that the
lighter vapors accumulate at the top and
the heavier vapors are left below.
In the refining of crude petroleum, the
first step comprised the distillation of the
crude oil in efficient fractionating towers
of the type just described. If the crude
oil, which has first passed through a tube
furnace and has been heated to about 777
degrees F., is fed into such a tower at
some point between the top and bottom,
then it will continuously be separated into
materials of different boiling points. The
light vapors at the top can be drawn off
constantly and be condensed as gasoline.
Kerosene, whose vapors boil at a tempera-
ture below that of gasoline, will con-
dense next. At a point somewhat lower
in the tower a continuous stream of
kerosene can be drawn off. Next to boil
off are gas oil and light fuel oil. A con-
tinuous stream of these materials can be
collected further down in the tower. By
the time the gas oil and fuel oil fractions
are vaporized the temperature has reached
500-600 degrees F.
Gasoline, kerosene and gas oil can be
distilled at atmospheric pressure without
being decomposed. This is not true of the
remaining heavy fractions: wax distillates
and cylinder stocks. The vapor pressures
of these fractions are so low that they can-
not be heated to their normal boiling
points without different ways by which
bottoms, as they are called, can be distilled
without damage.
These methods are known as vacuum
and steam distillation. Vacuum distilla-
tion requires that the pressure within the
still be reduced. This is accomplished by
means of vacuum pumps. At this low
pressure the oil can be distilled at sub-
stantially lower temperatures, depending
on the degree of vacuum obtained. Under
these conditions the danger of cracking
and decomposition are eliminated.
Steam distillation requires that steam
be forced into the still which is operating
at atmospheric conditions. The steam is
introduced at the bottom of the still and
properties in controlling oil consumption.
Finally, they are filtered to color. The
finished products are called neutrals. In
the second step of the process the cylinder
stock is also filtered, dewaxed and then
filtered again to produce the finished
product called bright stock. Neutrals and
bright stock are blended in varying pro-
portions to form different S. A. E. oils.
Refinery Operations
Since this article is concerned primar-
ily with the consideration of the lubri-
cating products of crude oil, more detailed
description will be given of the refinery
operations employed in the production of

bubbled up through the oil. Its effect is to
aid the vaporization by carrying the vapors
over into the condensers where the steam
(water) is readily separated from the oil.
Also, to a certain extent, it has the same
effect as vacuum in reducing the pres-
sure at which the oil may be vaporized.
In some cases, the combination of steam
and vacuum are used. In this combina-
tion, it is not necessary to create so high a
vacuum nor to utilize so much steam as if
either process were used alone. This com-
bined process is used in the fractionation
of wax distillate from 600 steam refined
cylinder stock.
These wax distillates and cylinder stock
contain the materials which, after further
refining, are used in the manufacture of
lubricating oils. In processing, the wax
distillates are dewaxed to insure good
flow characteristics at low temperatures.
Following this they are redistilled to con-
trol the viscosity and volatility, important
neutrals and bright stocks from wax dis-
tillate and cylinder stock, respectively.
The first step in the removal of the
wax is to chill the distillate. The tempera-
tures used vary, depending upon the de-
sired pour point of the neutrals produced.
Pour point may be denned as the lowest
temperature at which an oil has become so
chilled that it will barely pour when tilted
in a container of a design standardized by
the American Society for Testing Ma-
terials.
A common chilling machine consists of
a number of 6 inch pipes in series, each
jacketed by an outer 8 inch pipe. Inside
the 6 inch pipe is a screw conveyor driven,
by chain sprockets. The conveyor is neces-
sary to force the congealed wax along
with the oil. Sometimes brine, which can
be reduced to low temperatures without
freezing, is circulated in the outer pipe,
surrounding the inner pipe in which the

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


BY
GEORGE A. PEEK JR.
A POLITICAL SCIENCE
This is the second in a series of articles by
faculty members intended to acquaint the tech-
nical student with subjects outside of the Engi-
neering curriculum.
A recent cartoon in The New Yorker
magazine showed a small boy gazing wist-
fully at a top store window. On display
in the window were costumes—costumes
for cowboys, for sailors, for soldiers, and
a plain coat, brief case and eye-glasses—
indicative tools of the atomic scientist.
Thus does the scientist of the atomic age
become a hero in the minds of small boys.
But if we look more deeply into this sub-
tle commentary on our life, we find that
for most Americans, science—even the
very term itself—somehow has a halo of
authenticity, exactness, and finality.
It is in a sense unfortunate that those
who study various aspects of man in so-
ciety are called "scientists," more particu-
larly that those who study man and po-
litical society are called "political scient-
ists." This is not meant to agree with
purists who would deny the use of this
term "science" to all disciplines but the
so-called exact sciences. It is simply to
suggest that "political science" is, depend-
ing upon the point of view, both more
than and less than a science, as the purists
are wont to use the term. That discipline
which devotes its attention to political so-
ciety or the state may properly be called
political science, or better, simply politics.
For Aristotle politics (ta politica) was
the master science and encompassed all
those activities which we today classify
generally as the social sciences; however,
the discipline of politics is not usually em-
ployed in such a broad context by mod-
ern students. When we use the term
politics, it is not in the sometimes unsav-
ory connotation of illegal or unethical
manipulation of votes and elections, but
rather to mean that study which treats sys-
tematically of man and the state.
Politics, using that term in the sense
that we have defined it, is difficult to de-
limit as a discipline. It is so intimately re-
lated to other studies of social man, that
there have been those who deny that it has
a field of inquiry specifically its own.
These people would say that, the field is
either so broad and so all inclusive that it
cannot be encompassed in one discipline,
or else that it is but an aspect or phase of
GEORGE A. PEEK, JR.
Department of Political Science
other social sciences. However, present
day scholars recognize, and this recogni-
tion is sanctioned by long usage, that there
is a manageable field of inquiry concern-
ing man and the state which is primarily
"political" in approach, and this we shall
examine. This does not mean that politics
differs in kind from the other social sci-
ences, for it does not. It differs only in
approach, or point of view. The social
sciences as a whole are concerned with
man and society; they all survey in a gen-
eral way the same terrain, but each dis-
cipline employs different compasses,
guides, and maps.
Now study of politics is not merely de-
scriptive, it is also normative—it is
concerned both with "what is," and
"what ought to be." It is concerned
with the description of the structure and
operation of governmental organizations
from the local to the international level,
and with a comparative study of these or-
ganizations. This is a study of "what is,"
and a study of "what is," must be largely
empirical. But politics goes further and
inquires into the functions of these or-
ganizations. It is then possible to view
the purposes for which the organ exists.
And finally the question arises, what
ought this particular entity to do, thus
plunging us into the realm of "ought."
Politics also concerns itself with the
legal relationship of the individual to the
state and of states to one another; hence
the student finds himself inquiring into
public law at the local, national, and in-
ternational level. This is not an impinge-
ment on the field of law; it is an effort
to understand one phase of the state in its
national and international aspect. When
inquiry into politics poses the questions:
For what purpose does the state exist? or,
How can we justify the existence of the
state? We find ourselves asking questions
with which philosophers and theologians
have struggled for years. If the nature of
the state is said to be determined by the
nature of man, what then is the nature of
man? Philosophy and theology continue
to pose this question and to answer it in
some fashion with only partial success.
Or we might attack the problem of man in
political society by the observation of man
in that society, and thus help might be
had in solving some of the major issues.
Psychologists, and more particularly social
psychologists, provide a wealth of data
which the student of politics cannot afford
to ignore. Furthermore, it is a truism that
in order to understand what a thing is,
one must inquire what it was and ask how
it got to be as it is now. Thus does the
historian provide the facts from which the
political thinker erects the foundation for
his work. Or as Sir John Seeley phrased
it:
"Political Science without history has no
root,
History without political science has no
fruit."
Our point is now sufficiently made.
Politics is in a sense a hybrid, for it is con-
cerned with the "what is" and "what
ought to be"; it borrows from and avails
itself of the fields of philosophy, sociol-
ogy, psychology, social psychology, law,
history, economics, and anthropology.
This does not exhaust the field, but it lets
us see in general what is involved.
Granting, therefore, that politics, which
is the science of the state, is also inti-
mately related to a number of other disci-
plines, how does the political thinker pro-
ceed to arrive at results? Which is to say,
in what sense is politics "scientific?" The
value of a science is said to depend upon
its usefulness in predicting occurrences
and the science becomes more exact as its
"dependable predictability" increases.

tunity to make extensive social contacts,
to extend the field of human relationships,
to make lasting friendships. But does it
afford all these things? I feel it does. To
the men who are interested in more than
merely pushing a slide-rule for four years
of college, there are many outside activi-
ties. Every student engineer should take
on at least one extra-curricular activity;
he has the time if only he would make
time in his daily schedule.
Denver "Engineer"
January, 1949
Webster's Collegiate Dictionary tells us
that an automaton is "a person who be-
haves mechanically, especially one follow-
ing a routine without active intelligence."
To be considered an automaton, then, is
hardly complimentary, especially if the
one under consideration happens to be an
engineer.
At Georgia Tech, and doubtless at many
other engineering schools, the first two or
three years of schooling seem to be pro-
ducing more automatons than original
thinkers. Almost any Tech professor who
specializes in third or fourth year courses
will agree that somewhere along the line
students do not acquire the knack of
thinking a problem through. Creative
thinking and logical analysis do not ap-
pear where they might reasonably be ex-
pected. By the time a prospective engineer
becomes a senior he should be past the
"plug it in a formula and slide it out"
stage. The fact that many upperclassmen
are not past this stage soon becomes evi-
dent in senior design courses and other
higher courses where real thinking is a
must.
It is perhaps natural during the first
part of our engineering training that we
are not aware of the bad habits being in-
stilled. In our effort to make the grade at
a difficult school we fall victim to what
might be called "formula-mania." The
responsibility for correcting this malady
lies not only with instructors but also with
students who must become aware of the
existence of this malady.
Before it's too late—refuse to be auto-
matons and start to think!
The Georgia Tech Engineer
January, 1949
The humorous contempt with which the
average engineering student regards the
"humanities" is somewhat justified. It
is to his credit that he has a distrust of
politics and a distaste for the sort of shen-
anigans that quite frequently are the mark
of a successful business man. The justi-
fication for the humanity courses is les-
sened because of the extreme general na-
ture of the courses, and the limited amount
of actual information that is presented.
All too often, however, an engineer is
catapulted into a position where more
than technical skill is required. Fully forty
per cent of the engineers today are en-
gaged in administration and management.
It seems to me that an engineer in this
condition is just about like an adolescent
learning about sex. If his parents don't
start from the beginning and explain it
to him, he will learn it from the big boys
and he might not get a full appreciation
of the social significance of what he is
doing.
Oregon State Tech Record

Engineering colleges teach much theory
because sound theory is the most funda-
mental, basic and durable knowledge—
hence the best foundation for a useful
professional life in a changing world.
Learn young how to meet people, sell
things, handle tools, do the everyday
chores of business and industry.
Formulas are useful engineering tools,
but poison to education—a substitute for
thinking.
It's only half true that you don't need
knowledge in the head if you know where
to look it up. Knowing where to look is a
great asset, but mere ownership of a good
handbook never made a man an engineer.
Much knowledge may be left to the ref-
erence books, but some should always be
kept 'on the hip" like a six-shooter, ready
for a quick draw.
Purdue Engineer
March, 1948
The engineer has always been tagged as
the campus isolationist and will continue
to maintain that unenviable reputation
until he begins to realize that there is
something fundamentally wrong with his
attitude.
Most Wharton or College students will
tell you that Penn engineers are easy to
recognize. All of them, it seems, have a
rather narrow outlook on life: they are in-
terested in their slide rules, their formulas,
their textbooks and themselves—the rest
of the world doesn't count. Psychologists
have found that this characterization is ap-
plicable not only to engineering students
but to a great many graduate engineers as
well. Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect
of this situation is the fact that everyone
seems to recognize it except the engineer.
Engineers are notorious for their insis-
tence upon practicality. They frequently
dismiss as intangibles which have little
practical value the opportunities for "in-
tellectual development" which college or-
ganizations offer to students. But they
overlook the fact that their future em-
ployers will often be just as greatly in-
fluenced by their records of participation
in undergraduate affairs as by their scho-
lastic achievement records.
Unless the engineering student realizes
the many advantages which may be his
through participation in campus activities,
and that he is fooling no one but himself
by remaining curled up in his academic
shell, he will remain just another "narrow
engineer."

Was it Da Vinci who said that perfec-
tion is made of an infinity of small details?
Very few things are perfect, or likely to be
so. Nevertheless, it becomes an engineer
to be meticulous about his work as a part
of his professional attitude. He should
always retain in his outlook a little skep-
ticism. If he can school himself to a rea-
soning dissatisfaction about his work, he
need have no fear of ceasing to progress
in it. A great amount of the advancement
of human life has resulted from the dis-
satisfactions of men, who, having thought
them through, were then able to direct
their minds toward betterment. So, if the
engineer can say to himself, "This is a
compromise of that bad feature and that
good one," he has progressed.

Airplanes vs. Grasshoppers
It took a fleet of 40 airplanes last sum-
mer to save a vast expanse of Western
range lands from devastation. The "res-
cue" was spectacular in the Western tra-
dition, but it also was a well-planned,
scientific operation, utilizing the full po-
tential of aviation for the first time in suc-
cessful combat against one of man's most
historic enemies—a grasshopper plague.
Using bran treated with the new in-
secticides, chlordane and toxaphene, the
planes sprayed poison 'hopper bait over
2,700,000 acres in a little more than two
weeks.
Government entomologists estimated
that 522,000,000,000 grasshoppers were
killed during the "campaign" from June
15 to Aug. 3- To emphasize the amazing
extent of this accomplishment, they reck-
oned that the dead grasshoppers weighed
175,000 tons and would have made a pile
filling the average city block to a height of
more than 400 feet.
David Hall, entomologist in charge of
the program, said the treatment savevd
approximately half the grass in the area—
enough to provide forage for livestock
producing 16,000,000 pounds of beef. No
range was so severely damaged that it will
not recover by the spring of 1950.
A G.M. Research Story
A supersensitive instrument that can
measure minute changes in the blood's
oxygen content or the cooling rate of steel
during quenching has been developed by
General Motors Research Laboratories.
The research objective was to perfect a
device that would measure direct current
signals as faint as a few hundredths of a
microvolt, a task ordinarily performed by
a sensitive galvanometer.
The galvanometer's biggest drawback
was its extreme sensitivity to vibration
which confined its use to sub-basements or
other vibration-free locations. The GM
Research amplifier can be handled virtu-
ally like a portable radio and operates al-
most anywhere with undisturbed stability,
even in an automobile or airplane.
Already the amplifier has become a ser-
vant of the operating room anesthestist,
as a result of collaboration between GM
Research, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit,
and other medical research groups.
The amplifier is linked with the photo-
cells of an instrument known as the
oxyhemograph.
This instrument records directly the per
cent oxygen saturation of the hemoglobin
of the blood stream. Its operating prin-
ciple is based on the fact that there is a
change in light transmission between oxy-
dizcd and reduced hemoglobin.
Light from a small lamp is directed
through a thin section of flesh, the pinna
(external part) of the ear, and falls on
two photocells in opposition. There is a
red filter in front of one cell and a green
cell in front of the other.
The cell back of the green filter re-
sponds to changes in tissue thickness and
changes in total volume of blood responds
to changes in tissue thickness and changes
in total volume of blood; while the cell
back of the red filter responds to these
volume variables, as they are called, as
well as to changes in oxygen saturation of
the blood.
Thus, the different signal developed
here and applied to the amplifier is pro-
portional to the blood oxygen saturation.
It warns the anesthestist when the pa-
tient's blood ration drops or rises and en-
ables him to control it by glancing at a
recording graph next to the operating
table. Already tested on Ford Hospital
surgical patients, this technique automati-
cally informs the anesthestist what he
formerly learned by watching a patient's
color, pulse, breathing rate and blood pres-
sure.
To the surgeon operating on a hospital
patient, the signal on the amplifier indi-
cates instantly how well the patient re-
sponds to certain types of heart surgery.
In fact, hospital experts have found the
amplifier especially effective in treatment
of heart cases or during long operations
extending over periods of several hours.
Its use can save lives and speed the pa-
tient's recovery.
The amplifier has been applied to re-
search on the process of steel quench-
ing, or the hardening of steel for
industrial uses. Here the amplifier is
linked with thermocouples to a test bar
of steel. Instantly it records the cooling
rate which always is extremely fast in the
initial moment of the quench, This aids
metallurgists in classifying steels accord-
ing to their hardness or hardenability.
In GM Research Laboratories the am-
plifier is coupled with the electrical con-
trols of a spectrophotometer, which is
used in the infra-red analysis of automo-
tive fuels.
Shooting the 'Chute
Time was when parachutes were tested
by loading them with weights and Top-
ping them from airplanes. However, early
in 1950 the Air Force base at Murac,
California, will have a new method of
testing chutes.
Parachutes will be mounted in a tear-
shaped container attached to a revolving
boom atop a 120-foot-high tower. As a
2800-horsepower General Electric motor
whirls the boom at a present speed, a
firing device will "shoot the chute" open.
The tests will determine the strength,
design, and reliability of the parachutes.
Newest Jet Job
General Electrics powerful J-47 jet en-
gine is the power behind the Air Force's
newest jet fighter, the Republic XF-91-
This speedy interceptor will also be equip-
ped with rocket motors for use in accel-
erated take-off and climb and in opera-
tion at high altitudes.
The XF-91 is the second J-47 powered
plane to be announced by the Air Force
this year. The other is the B-45 four-jet
bomber, built by North American, maker
of the F-86, holder of the official world's
speed record.
The Republic interceptor is 45 feet
long, and the inversely tapered, swept-
back wings have a span of about 30 feet.
Slow but Very Sure
The heaviest single piece of electric
equipment ever shipped from General
Electric's Schenectady Works was a
388,000-pound stator for a steam turbine-
generator, delivered to the Fisk Station
of the Commonwealth Edison Company
of Chicago.
The stator, great stationary part of the
150,000-kilowatt generator, was hoisted
to a flatcar by two 100-ton cranes. Four
railroads hauled the 46-foot flatcar, one of
only 10 such cars in the country capable
of carrying the stator.

World's fastest automatic changer —in RCA 45 rpm system-
changes records in 5 seconds.
Hundreds of thousands are now enjoying
RCA's thrilling new way of playing rec-
ords .. . they marvel at its wonderful tone
. . . and the speed with which it changes
records.
Prolonged research is behind this achieve-
ment, research which sought —for the first
time in 70 years of phonograph history—a
record and automatic player designed for
each other.
Revolutionary is its record-changing
principle, with mechanism inside the cen-
tral spindle post on which records are
so easily stacked. Result: a simplified
machine, that automatically changes rec-
ords in 5 seconds.
Remarkable, too, are the new records —
only 6% inches in diameter—yet giving the
playing time of conventional 12-inch rec-
ords. Unbreakable, these compact vinyl plas-
tic discs use only the distortion-free "quality
zone". . . for unbelievable beauty of tone.
Value of the research behind RCA's 45
rpm system — which was started 11 years
ago at RCA Laboratories—is seen in the
instant acceptance, by the public, of this
better way of playing records. Music
lovers may now have both the 45 rpm
system, and the conventional "78."
Development of an entirely new record-play-
ing principle is just one of hundreds of ways

The Dean Speaks
(Bill Gripman In rear)

ENGINEERING
The Engineering Council, in coopera-
tion with campus organizations, presented
Engineering Night, intended to acquaint
the student with the various engineering
organizations. For the first time, under
one roof, engineers had the opportunity
to get a brief view of the scope of extra-
curricular activities.
Dean Ivan C. Crawford spoke to the
400 engineers who were gathered in the
Union Ballroom. He described the Uni-
versity's expansion and plans to provide
increased facilities for engineering stu-
dents. Dean Crawford also expressed his
views on education, at the same time tak-
ing a good natured swing at some of the
editorials in the Michigan Technic, which
he described as "the best engineering
magazine in the country."
The booths constructed by the indi-
vidual organizations proved interesting
and informative. The American Institute
of Electrical Engineers and the Institute of
Radio Engineers demonstrated sound
transmission by light waves. The tele-
vision exhibit enabled students to see their
own images on a television receiver while
Jack Kruse operated the camera.

plate potential, the functioning of the
tubes is dependent upon the voltages
channeled from the oscillator through
transformer "E" and the signal from the
load cell through transformer "H."
The action of the load cell depends
upon a change in resistance only, thus the
phase from the unbalanced cell to the dis-
criminator is in phase with the voltage
supplied by the oscillator. Now,because
there is no change in phase, the action of
the discriminator depends only upon the
magnitude of the potentials supplied.
For the sake of simplicity, the sign of
the potentials at a time "t" has been arbi-
trarily chosen as shown (fig. 3) in order
to show the action of the discriminator.
Voltage "E" is the constant potential sup-
plied by the oscillator. "H" is the variable
voltage from the load cell when a load is
applied. The action of the tubes will be
considered at time "t."
The signs indicated at the plates and
cathodes are those that would exist at the
time and conditions assumed. Tube "J"
has a positive potential on both cathode
and plate, and since the cathode has a
higher plus value because it is supplied
by "E," this tube will not function. Tube
"K" has a positive cathode and a negative
plate—thus prohibiting operation.
Tube "L," however, with a positive
plate and a negative cathode will operate,
giving a current to the recorder in the di-
rection shown.
The remaining tube,"M", has a nega-
tive supply to both the plate and cathode
—but the plate is supplied from "H"
which is less negative (due to the lower
potential) than the cathode. Hence there
is a difference in potential with the ca-
thode more negative than the plate—this
is one of the major requirements for
operation—and current will flow through
the tube. This current from tube "M",
though, opposes the current from "L", but
the magnitude of the flow from "M" is
less than that of "L". This condition
gives a resultant current which will flow
to the recorder.
That the magnitude of current "M" is
less than that of "L" may be shown by as-
suming values for the voltage potentials.
If "e" equals 100 and "h", 50 volts, then
the drop across tube "L" is 100—(—50),
or 150 volts, since the cathode is negative
at this instant. The corresponding drop
across tube "M" will be equal to e—h,
also, but will only be 50 volts (100—50)
for both the plate and cathode have the
(Continued from page 7)
same sign. The quantity of current flow is
proportional to the magnitude of the po-
tential gradient between the plate and the
cathode, thus tube "L", because it has the
higher potential, will deliver a larger cur-
rent.
Increasing the load on the material test-
ed will cause the load cell to be further
unbalanced (an additional change in re-
sistance) and a correspondingly larger
signal will be introduced to the phase dis-
criminator—still in the same phase as the
oscillator voltage. The potential will now
be "H'"—assuming 75 volts at instant
"h'." The potential across tube "L" under
these new conditions will be (100—
(—75) 175 volts, while the drop across
"M" will be less, (100—15 = 85v), since
the tubes are closer to the same potential.
Current will still flow, however, through
"L", but will have less retarding effect
on the current from "M". Thus there will
be an absolute increase in current supplied
to the recorder—accounting for the in-
crease in load. This larger current, of
course, will cause the recorder to describe
a larger load on the indicator.
When the potential output from the
load cell equals that supplied by the os-
cillator, the current to the recorder will be
a maximum, for no current will flow
through tube "M"—the plate and cathode
will be at the same potential with respect
to each other, i.e., e will equal h. The
current.then, from tube "L" will be unre-
tarded.
If the voltage from the bridge circuit
tends to go above the potential of the
oscillator, the attenuator is shifted to a less
sensitive range and the voltage remains
within that of the oscillator. If the bridge
signal is zero, tubes '"L" and "M" are at
the same potential,and thus the opposing
current cancel each other making the
resultant current zero, as should be ex-
pected.
During the next half-cycle, the signs of
the voltages on the transformers (H and
E) will be reversed. This causes tubes "J"
and "K" to operate in the same manner as
"L" and "M", and will provide a resultant
current to the recorder in the same direc-
tion as was given by "L" and "M". The
phase discriminator, then, acts as a recti-
fier, supplying D.C. voltage to the re-
corder.
The recorder gives immediate results of
tests, by a stylus arrangement moving on a
strip-chart. The stylus movement is pro-
portional to the current input to the re-
corder which, in turn, is proportional to
the magnitude of the load. The careful
calibration of all the units gives direct
readings of the load from 2 grams to
5,000 lbs.
The weighing element deflects a maxi-
mum of .003 inches upon application of its
top rated load. This feature is of impor-
tance in that the action of the pulling jaw
alone will determine the rate of extension
of the sample, thereby enabling the time-
dependent properties of the sample to be
correctly evaluated. The disintegration
during rupture of inextensible materials
may be investigated without sudden load
fluctuations- causing deflections of the
weighing jaw that would interrupt the
continuity of the sample extension.
Also, on account of their low deforma-
tion under load, the load cell exhibits
none of the effects of mechanical inert a
that might cause premature rupture of
similar distortion of its stress-strain char-
acteristics.
Servo Controlled Drive
The controlled drive for the pulling
jaws is an example of an applied servo-
mechanism. Servo mechanisms are a class
of automatic regulators "whose purpose is
to keep a regulated quantity matched to
a reference quantity. Usually some dis-
tance intervenes between the initiating de-
vice and the thing regulated. Moreover,
in this matching process some amplifica-
tion is involved."
The quantities to be regulated in this
particular system are speed and position.
The mechanism is a combination of elec-
tronic and electric controls. The integra-
tion of these controls for the regulation of
speed requires the incorporation of four
important characteristics:
1. Fast response.
2. High accuracy.
3. Unattended control.
4. Remote operation.
The operator manually selects a desired
function of the machine i.e., "up",
"down", "traverse", or "stop"; and he
also selects the speed at which any of
these operations are to occur. The syn-
chronous motor operates at a constant
speed, but through the gear arrangement
connected to the motor, speeds from 0.2
to 20.0 inches per minute may be selected.
The power output at the selected speed
is transmitted mechanically to the mag-
netic clutches. The clutches sponsor the
direction of travel of the head. The oper-

Let's get down to earth...
Imagine stealing three billion tons of earth every year!
That's what soil erosion has been doing. And this gigantic
theft has cost farmers billions of dollars. For good earth is
not dirt cheap.
"Stop erosion!" has become the farmers' war cry. Agri-
cultural agencies have joined the farmers. Together, they
have turned to the farm machinery makers. They've asked
for bigger and better bulldozers, tractors, graders for neces-
sary ditching and terracing. But to build this super farm
machinery takes tougher steel, new alloys.
Here is where UCC enters the allied offensive against
erosion. Drawing on its vast engineering experience, UCC
contributes modern metallurgical techniques and alloys.
This co-operation with steel manufacturers helps the farm
machinery makers .. . who then are able to give the farmers
the equipment they need.
How is the "war" going? The farmers are winning. Dust
bowls are vanishing. Sterile lands show signs of life. Yes, the
farmers are winning their fight against soil erosion with a
combination of new equipment, rcvegetation and crop
rotation.
Union Carbide is proud of its part in this effort. And the
people of UCC stand ready to help solve other problems ...
wherever better materials and processes are needed.

The selsyn operated by the drive motor
is the generator, while the error sensing
selsyn is the control transformer. The
rotor of the selsyn generator turns at the
actual speed of the moving crosshead. If
A.C. voltage is now supplied to its rotor,
a voltage will be induced in the three
phase winding on the surrounding stator.
The three voltages induced in these phases
are unequal in magnitude and are deter-
mined by the position (of rotation) of the
rotor field. This flux pattern that is set
up is transmitted via the three wires to the

The rotor of the selsyn control transform-
er is driven at the desired speed of the

Now, if the rotor of the transformer sel-
syn is not in the same relative position as

the two rotors.

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK

New head with a good idea
Designers of a new milling head had a precision
problem. They had to give the head a high degree
of accuracy that would last even under the toughest
loads. They answered the poser with Timken®
tapered roller bearings — on spindle, pinion and
gear shafts.
Timken bearings keep the shafts rigid and accurate
under heavy radial, thrust and combination loads,
eliminate deflection and end-play, reduce wear on
moving parts.
TIMKEN" bearings do
9 out of 10 jobs better
Nine out of ten bearing applications can be handled
more efficiently by Timken bearings. Some of the
reasons why: they carry radial and thrust and com-
bination loads; line contact between rolls and races
means greater load capacity; positive roller align-
ment, true rolling motion, and microscopic accuracy
make them almost 100% frictionless; they permit
pre-loading to any desired degree.

a voltage induced in the rotor. This vol-
tage, is proportional to the difference in
relative speeds of the two rotors, and this
is the desired error for correction since
the selsyn generator turns at the actual
speed and the transformer selsyn turns at
the desired speed.
The amplidyne generator (driven by
the induction motor) amplifies the er-
ror signal to a voltage large enough to
supply to the armature of the D.C. motor
which drives the moving crosshead.
Thus the error signal is supplied to the
motor controlling the speed and position
of the crosshead and is in a direction so as
to cause the error to approach zero. When
the desired speed and the actual speed are
the same, no error signal will be induced
in the rotor of the transformer selsyn and
the crosshead will continue in the same
direction or will stop, depending upon the
condition imposed by the operator.
Because the reference system has very
low mechanical inertia, it is started,
stopped, and reversed almost instantan-
eously under the action of the magnetic
clutches. The main drive cannot of course
respond as fast to a sudden change, but

because the servo operates on positional
error it must very quickly get in step
again.
Typical Application
In the report of this tensile tester, em-
phasis has been placed on the need for
sensitivity of control and response. As
an example of the type of testing that
may be accomplished, a record for repeat-
ed loading of paper is illustrated.
Figure 5
In this case, high grade paper was sub-
jected to testing under tension. The speci-
men was stretched until the load reached
a number of successively increased values,
with the tension being released each time
by reversing the jaw motion. The record
shows that a form of work-hardening
takes place in paper, since the flow region
for each loading cycle begins at the maxi-
mum previously applied load. By slightly
modifying the technique, the amount of
permanent deformation could be readily-
determined as a function of varying
amounts of load or extension.
Conclusion
This tensile tester, because of its special
characteristics, has potential application in
a large variety of fields. Its utility has al-
ready been mentioned in the research and
development of textiles, plastics, and simi-
lar materials in which a complex physical
structure predominates. There are other
fields of application such as paper or fine
wire and foils, in which either the low in-
herent extensibility or the low strength of
the material has made inadequate any
previous techniques.
It is the engineer, however, whose in-
genuity and skill are responsible for these
developments. And it is the engineer who
will use the results of his machines to
further a dynamic society—he and his
safety factor.

A DU PONT PROCESS CONVERTS
FURFURAL INTO A CHEMICAL
FOR MAKING NYLON
One of the fascinating things about
nylon is the unlikely sounding raw
materials that go into it. Popu-
larly, nylon is said to be made from
coal, air and water. This is because
originally, in developing its chemi-
cal intermediates, chemists used ben-
zene (from coal), ammonia (from air
and water), and oxygen (from air).
But Du Pont is always looking for
new ways of doing things. After the
discovery of nylon in 1934, research
men immediately began looking for
alternative ways of making the two
main intermediates—adipic acid and
hexamethylenediamine. In 1935,
when nylon was still in the labora-
tory stage and three years before its
commercial debut, they started work
on the possibility of using furfural
in the process.

Furfural has been used in the chem-
ical industry for 25 years, but it is
little known to the layman. A tan-
colored liquid with a faint bitter-
almond odor, it is made from a wide
variety of agricultural by-products.
Among these are corncobs and hulls
of cottonseed, oats, rice—all available
in practically unlimited quantities
from America's farms.

A. G. Sveinbjornsson, Ph.D., Organic Chem-
istry, University of Kansas, 1948, and H. B.
Cope/in, M. S., Organic Chemistry, Cornell,
1941, studying new furfural derivatives.
C. R. Dewey, B. S. Chem., Niagara Univer-
sity, 1941, and J. M. Estes, B.S. Ch.E., Uni-
versity of Missouri, 1937, engaged in produc-
tion of adiponitrile at the Du Pont Electro-
chemicals plant in Niagara Falls, New York.
14 Years of Research
and Development
It seems a far cry from corncobs to
nylon, and it was. The development
from the first small-scale laboratory
experiments to the present full-scale
plant cost 14 years of time and about
five million dollars. But it enabled
chemists to produce large quantities
of adiponitrile, the compound from
which hexamethylenediamine is
made, by an economical process
which uses natural materials that
are in continuous supply.
In the new process, furfural is con-
verted by a series of steps to 1,4-di-
chlorobutane. The next step explains
in part why Du Pont undertook the
project in the first place. As pro-
ducers of cyanides, they had sodium

trile plant at Niagara Falls. Here furfural, an

cyanide available for converting the
1,4-dichlorobutane into adiponitrile.
The final product, hexamethylene-
diamine, is then reacted with adipic
acid to make nylon "salt." Still more
processing and the salt becomes yarn,
and the nylon flake used by the
plastics industry.
Opportunities at Du Pont
in many scientific fields
This is an excellent example of the
interesting work in industrial organic
chemistry carried on at Du Pont. It
required the technical knowledge and
skill of highly trained research and
development men, including organic
and physical chemists; chemical, me-
chanical, civil and electrical engi-
neers, and others.
Only a large company with ample
resources in men and money could
afford to engage in research of such
magnitude. To the young college
graduate, Du Pont offers the broad-
est of opportunities in many scientific
fields, along with the advantages of
working directly with a small group
of associates.
Keynote of Du Pont personnel
policy is promotion from within on
a competitive merit basis. A con-
scientious effort is made not only
to choose college-trained people of
promise, but to develop each indi-
vidual as rapidly as possible.

distillate is carried. Some refiners use
ammonia instead of brine, expanding it
directly into the chiller.
When the wax distillate has been
brought down to the desired temperature
it is pumped through a filter press. This
machine consists of a number of canvas
covered, perforated plates separated by
steel rings. The chilled oil is pumped
through the canvas blankets and the wax
collects on the fabric. The oil, now called
pressed distillate, drips out at the bottom
of the press into a pan. While contained
in a pan the pressed distillate is put
through another distillation unit. Here it
is fractionated for the proper neutrals,
and the undesirable light ends are taken
out of the lubricating oils. The wax, on
the other hand, is removed periodically
from the press in the form of cakes and
separated by a sweating process into fools
oil and white wax.
The next step is to filter the reduced
pressed distillate through fuller's earth,
or bauxite, to remove impurities and col-
ored materials. Through the use of the
(Continued from page 9)
filter, it is possible to control the color of
the neutral over a wide range from a nat-
ural yellow-brown to a transparent yellow.
This filtration completes the treatment of
the reduced pressed distillate now classi-
fied as viscous neutral. It is transferred
to storage from which it will be drawn
for blending with bright stock to finished
motor oil.
While the wax found in the lighter wax
distillate is crystalline wax, the wax on the
cylinder stock is amorphous. It does not
separate readily from the oil. Two proc-
esses are used to accomplish separation.
One is cold settling, the other centrifug-
ing.
Wax Separation
In either process the first step is to mix
the oil with naptha in the proportion of
30 to 40 per cent of stock to 60 to 70 per
cent of naptha. Next, it is filtered through
fuller's earth to improve the color and to
remove any materials which might inter-
fere with wax removal. In cold settling,
the naptha-oil mixture is permitted to cool
slowly in large tanks. After a period of
time, the wax settles out. This wax after
color treatment is called pretrolatum or
in commercial form, vaseline.
In cold settling the force which effects
the separation of wax is gravity. This
force can be multiplied many times by
means of a centrifuging machine. In cen-
trifuging, the diluted filtered stock is cool-
ed down to the temperature desired to
give the proper pour test to the finished
oil and then is passed through the centri-
fuge which operates at 16,000-17,000
r.p.m. The high speed throws the heavier
petrolatum to the outer edge where it is
removed.
The dewaxed cylinder stock must no
go through another distillation process to
remove the naptha dilutant which was
added to permit effective centrifuging. It
is then refiltered for the removal of mois-
ture and to restore its color. The finished
oil is now known as bright stock.
The trend of modern dewaxing meth-
ods is toward an operation which can be

PROBLEM — You are designing a machine for
doing finishing operations on the production line,
such as grinding, polishing, buffing, etc. Your prob-
lem is to provide a drive that permits the grinding
or polishing wheel to be moved around freely while
it is running. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE SOLUTION — Use an S.S.White
power drive flexible shaft to transmit rotary power
from a suspended or pedestal-mounted electric
motor to the handpiece which holds the finishing
wheel. This gives you a portable unit that permits
the wheel to be readily manipulated to reach all
points.
This is just one of hun-
dreds of power drive and
remote control problems
to which S.S.White flex-

A NOTE ON POLITICAL SCIEN
(Continued from page 11)
Eytomologically of course, science (scientia) means knowledge.
Politics also is a kind of knowledge. Therefore politics is, at
least partially, a science. But this does not get us very far.
More particularly, science may be defined as '"critical, syste-
matized, and generalized knowledge. From this definition we
may conclude that the student of science takes more pains than
the man in the street does to ge at the facts. In this he ob-
serves certain logical processes, certain orders of inference, and
we call this "scientific method." We may divide this sys-
tematization very roughly into three processes or phrases.
First and foremost there is a careful observation of facts re-
sulting in accurate description and systematic observation.
Second, is a tentative explanation of these facts, a linking
together in some sort of casual relationship. And third, in so
far as the causal relationship is known, is the possibility to
predict occurrences and to arrange the conditions to bring
about calculated results.
This method has proved invaluable to the chemist and
physicist who employ it to test their hypotheses, using particu-
larly the controlled experiment. In the laboratory a problem
may be set up, and a process repeated over and over again,
one factor being changed at a time. By the simple logical
method of agreement and difference, hypotheses may be verified
or rejected. But in politics experiment of a similar kind is
extremely difficult, if not impossible. On the other hand, it
should be pointed out that astronomy cannot employ the con-
trolled experiment yet the astronomer can predict occurrences
with what to the layman is amazing exactness. For the political
observer, however, it is impossible to know all the facts and
sometimes when an hypothesis is put forward informed readers
detect a twisting of interpretation here and there to make
the hypothesis fit.
In many of its aspects, politics is concerned with value judg-
ments and judgments about value depend upon the assump-
tions and preconceptions of the observer. The techniques of
bridge building are relatively independent of the value im-
pregnated beliefs of the bridge builder; but the business of
governing is inextricably bound up with the value judgments
and beliefs of governors and governed, about man, society and
the state. Yet politics is more than mere guess-work, devoid
of any body of systematized knowledge. To take a concrete
example, in that aspect of politics which is concerned with
political behavior, the inquirer collects data and makes careful
and systematic observation. From these data, he may draw
tentative conclusions to explain what factors were influential
in, let us say, determining why a particular district voted a
particular way, and he will continue to collect data to test his
conclusions, not in order to predict what will happen in the
future, because the same situation can never, as in the labora-
tory, be again reconstructed, but to help explain particular
political behavior. In the collection of his data and the cautious
drawing of tentative conclusions, the student of politics is
using the scientific method. But for the reasons we have
mentioned it is highly improbable, if not impossible, for
politics to be able to predict, as do the natural sciences.
It is no accident that the findings of the scientists regarding
fissionable materials now create a problem for society and that
social scientists are struggling to create organizations and con-
trols with regard to the use of atomic energy.

Mr. Workhoven worked 41 years

Among the things that make it
so is Standard Oil's employee bene-
fit program, one of the finest and
broadest in any industry. This pro-
gram includes group hospital and
surgical operation insurance, cov-
ering employees and members of
their immediate families. It in-
cludes sickness and disability bene-
fits, group life insurance and vaca-

plan sends monthly checks to re-
tired Standard Oilers.
Peace of mind and pride of ac-

ees. That is why so many of them
stay with us through the years.
Their long service is an endorse-

Super Cooling
Teacher deserves a big, fat zero if she
says flatly that at a given pressure:
Water always freezes at 32 degrees
Fahrenheit;
Mercury always freezes at minus 37.7
degrees;
Tin always freezes at 449.4 degrees;
Gallium always freezes at 85.5 degrees.
General Electric Research Laboratory
scientists here have cooled all four sub-
stances far below their so-called "freez-
ing points" without having them freeze.
They have "super-cooled" water 71
degrees Fahrenheit below its freezing
point; tin 198 degrees, and gallium, 12?
degrees.
Not only must the temperature and
pressure be right for a substance to freeze,
but particles about which material freezes,
called "nuclei," must also be present, G-E
scientists explain. They have been able to
super-cool water, mercury, tin, and gal-
lium by ridding their samples of nuclei,
which are usually present in most fluids.
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 14)
If there are nuclei in a given material,
then "Teacher" is 100 per cent right about
the freezing points.
Water below its freezing point is often
found in nature, particularly in the form
of clouds. The water in super-cooled
clouds is without nuclei, points where the
freezing can begin, so it does not turn to
ice. G-E discoveries of methods to pro-
duce snow from super-cooled clouds are
based on putting nuclei into such clouds,
resulting in transformation of water drop-
lets in the cloud to snow crystals.
Research Laboratory metallurgists have
made "clouds" of super-cooled gallium,
tin and mercury, by dispersing those
metals in their fluid form as minute drop-
lets suspended in oil. Some of the drop-
lets may contain nuclei, but the freezing
that begins in them cannot spread to the
others through the oil, so that those with-
out nuclei can be reduced in temperature
far below their freezing point without
freezing.
G-E scientists explain that in some
cases there are limits beyond which sub-
stances cannot be cooled without freezing.
They believe that they have super-cooled
water and possibly mercury, tin and gal-
lium as much as possible, as nuclei seem
to form spontaneously below the tempera-
tures reached.
Rockets
Developing a man-carrying rocket capa-
ble of being flown to the Moon and back
would be an engineering task roughly
equivalent to designing a super aircraft
carrier, and would probably require a
rocket about 500 feet long and weighing
about 2000 tons, a General Electric engi-
neer said.
Warning that the prospect of an inter-
planetary rocket is "highly improbable be-
cause of the fantastic cost and the engi-
neering problems," he asserted that if the
national security depends upon it, the job
could probably be done.
The engineer, Dr. R. W. Porter, of the
G-E Aeronautic and Ordnance Systems
Divisions here, said that to escape the
gravity pull of the earth, the rocket would
have to streak away from the earth's at-
mosphere at about seven miles' per second,
or roughly 25,200 miles per hour.

as the V-2 which has attained an altitude of 114 miles, would
lack the necessary push to free it from the earth's pull, Dr.
Porter said.
A two-stage rocket, however, could probably break free of
gravity, he added. He described a two-stage rocket as a sort
of "duplex" in which a smaller rocket is carried by a larger one
until the larger has used all its fuel. It then drops off and
the smaller one continues under its own power.
A man-carrying two-stage rocket able to reach the Moon
and return would stand as high as a 35-story building and
would weigh about 2000 tons about 140 times as much as the
current V-2 rockets, he said. Fuel alone would account for
about six-sevenths of the rocket's total weight, he explained.
A more probable development, though still not in the im-
mediate future, according to Dr. Porter, is a pilotless rocket-
camera which could photograph the other side of the Moon.
Such a missile might weigh less than 100 tons.
He discounted the commercial use of rockets, explaining that
it would probably cost at least ten thousand dollars to trans-
port one passenger from New York to Cairo.

will permit rocketeers to go back to studies of space ships

employed satisfactorily for the dewaxing
of either wax distillates or cylinder stock.
This dual process eliminates the expense
of pressing and centrifuging. Nearly all
of the new processes employ special sol-
vents in which oil is preferentially more
soluble than wax as the temperature is
lowered. Two such processes are the pro-
pane self-refrigeration and the methyl
ethyl ketone processes.
In the propane process, liquid propane
is mixed with wax distillate or cylinder
stock at about 130 degrees F. Some of the
propane is then allowed to evaporate and,
since the heat required to vaporize the
propane is withdrawn from the solution,
the mixture becomes chilled, thereby
causing wax to come out of the solution.
The slurry is then pumped into a continu-
ous rotary vacuum filter, which consists
of a covered vat where a constant level of
slurry is maintained. A drum covered
with filter canvas is rotated inside the vat.
Through a series of pipes and compart-
ments inside the rotating drum, a vacuum
is applied to the bottom of the drum as it
passes through the slurry. The oil fil-
trate is drawn through the canvas pipes to
(Continued from page 24)
a filtrate receiver outside the filter. The
wax sticking to the outside of the drum is
separated from the slurry by centrifuge.
The wax is then washed with the solvent,
dried by suction, loosened with a blow-
back of flue gas, and removed from the
cloth by a scraper blade. Both the sep-
arated wax and oil are then subjected to
distillation in order to remove propane,
which is returned to the process.
In the foregoing discussion, frequent
reference has been made to the blending
of bright stock and neutral to form a
finished motor oil. Combination of these
bright and heavy stocks on varying pro-
portions is the usual method by which
motor oils of several grades are obtained.
Thus, an S.A.E. 10 is either straight
neutral or neutral blended with these to
five per cent bright stock. The propor-
tions of the two blends vary through the
S.A.E. range of numbers up to S.A.E. 70
where the ratio is reversed, with from
three to five per cent neutral and the re-
mainder bright stock.
In the manufacture of special lubricants,
or heavy duty oils, small amounts of cer-
tain chemical compounds are sometimes
added to the finished oils in order to sup-
plement such properties as load-carrying
capacity, oxidation stability, or detergency
characteristics. Such materials are often
called e. p. (extreme pressure) agents,
antioxidants, inhibitors, detergents or just
additives. They are usually employed only
in the production of gear lubricants, the
load carrying capacity of mineral oil alone
being sufficiently high to afford ample
protection for automative-type engines.
Similarity, additives are usually not re-
quired, but are sometimes used, to give
a margin of safety in ordinary passenger
car service. In certain truck, bus, and
tractor engine operation, where extremely
high crankcase oil temperatures may be
encountered, the natural stability of the
mineral oil can be increased by the addi-
tion of antioridants or inhibitors. For
very severe service, detergents may also
be incorporated in the blend to insure
engine cleanliness. The proportions of
these materials employed even for ex-
tremely heavy duty service is usually
less than three per cent of the mineral oil

Some twenty-five years ago Robert An-
gell, a Professor in the Sociology Depart-
ment, submitted a report to the President
of the University in which he recom-
mended—among other things— a com-
mon first year curricula for all the students
of the University. President Little asked
for this report because he realized that
the student body was beginning to separ-
ate into esoteric groups. The educational
experience offered in the various colleges
vas becoming so diverse that the common
rea of intellectual activity had almost
disappeared, and what was once a well
integrated growth of intellectual abilities
ad become a separate, compartmentalized,
experience.
In the report Professor Angell specifi-
cally asked that a course in Critical Think-
ing be required for all first year students.
The purpose of this course would be to
provide a useful framework for thinking
about problems in the many areas of hu-
man experience. For its content books,
which have become the backbone of west-
ern culture, would be chosen. Its value to
the engineering student would be inestim-
able because, in such a course, he would
become familiar with the ethical, social
and political problems of the human race.
From that familiarity might grow the in-
terest that is needed if the engineer is to
assume an active role in his society.
But Professor Angell was not content
to stop there; he knew another method of
establishing a common educational ex-
perience for the Literary and Engineering
Colleges. In asking for a common first
year curricula he implied the question we
would ask: Why is it necessary, on a
freshman level, to teach the engineering
student English composition in separate
classes?
Loud will be the calls that the engi-
neering student is not so capable a writer
as his fellow student in the Literary Col-
lege. Even granting such a premise does
not alter the fact that the superior disci-
pline invoked by stiffer competition would
increase the engineer's efforts and as a re-
sult would increase his rewards. The Lit-
erary student is required to take twelve
hours of science because it is realized that
only through discipline in many areas does
the mind receive the liberation necessary
for independent thinking.

It does not make sense to take fresh-
man engineering students, who have often
had the same high school background as
the freshman literary students, and put
them in separate classes where their minds
stagnate while reading essays about only
science, religion, and art. In not meeting
the literary student on his own ground
the engineer's thinking begins to assume
a static pattern, and his imagination be-
comes stultified. Thus his ability for sub-
jective expression becomes a blunted probe
and he learns to understand only objec-
tive truth while forgetting that there is
also imaginative truth.
The responsibilities which the engineer
must undertake are constantly becoming
more diverse. Gradually they are extend-
ing into the territory where knowledge
about human relationships is a requisite.
We feel that to meet this challenge the
undergraduate engineer should have more
interest and discipline in the humanistic
studies. It's about time that Professor
Angell's report was dusted off and put
to use!

DIRECTLY and indirectly, the average
family in America consumes more
electricity yearly than families in any
other country in the world. The demand
for more "juice" has grown with un-
believable rapidity, and it's still grow-
ing. By 19SS, the electrical generating
capacity of our nation is expected to
reach 90 million kilowatts!
Steel is a vital material in the pro-
duction of electricity. Central power
stations and great power dams are made
of steel and concrete. Special steels are
required for turbines and other genera-
ting machinery. Steel towers carry
steel-reinforced transmission lines across
mountain and prairie alike.
Helping to meet America's constantly
growing demands for more "juice" is
only one of the big jobs ahead for United
States Steel. There are many others.
And they all call for the services of
thousands of carefully-trained, technical
specialists. For steelmaking today is a
precision operation, as dependent for
success on the knowledge of metallurgi-
cal, mechanical, chemical, electrical, min-
ing, civil and ceramic engineers, as upon
the plant workers themselves.
To assure employees opportunity for
maximum personal development and
provide a sound foundation for advance-
ment in the organization are fundamen-
tal objectives of U. S. Steel. Employees
participating in educational activities of
U. S. Steel comprise a group exceeded
in size only by the student bodies of a
few of the nation's largest universities.
In these educational programs, partic-
ular attention is given to the develop-
ment »f college graduates and other
technically trained men.
For men who can qualify, a career
with United States Steel offers a prom-
ising future.

LUCKY!

MOtntny went to a school in the middle west, with
hundreds of other bright-eyed youngsters.
One day there was a fire in Tommy's school . . . from
defective electric wiring. The schoolhouse was "fire-
prooF, but the contents weren't So the flames spread,
until the whole school was ablaze like a roaring "fire-
prooP furnace.
Tommy managed to get out. He was badly burned,
but he was far more fortunate than some.
That fire was one of five school fires that occur each
day, and will continue to occur as long as there are worn
and faulty equipment and human carelessness. Regard-
less of whether a school is constructed of "fireproof"
materials, there seems to be no sure way to prevent
some fires from starting.
But there is a practical and absolutely dependable
way to control fires before they do material damage.
A Grinnell Automatic Sprinkler System stops fire
immediately, automatically, wherever and whenever
it strikes. Seventy years' experience shows that this
protection is close to 100% effective.
LOOK FOR THE GRINNELL SPRINKLER HEADS ON GUARD!
In schools, hotels, theatres, factories and hospitals there
is a moral obligation upon management for the utmost
in protection of life and property. For your own sake
ask about it in the schools you attend, the hotels where
you stop, the theatres to which you go. Everywhere
you go, look for the famous Grinnell Sprinkler Heads
—your assurance of dependable fire protection.

of American Military Aviation
BY
W. STUART SYMINGTON,
Secretary of the Air Corps
(Reprinted by Permission of Sperryscope Magazine)
Few of us today can recall the two his-
toric flights made by Orville Wright in
1909, six years after the Wright brothers'
immortal achievement at Kill Devil Hill.
The first of these flights was made on
July 29, over a five-mile course from Fort
Myer, Virginia, to Alexandria, Virginia,
and return. Wright was accompanied on
this flight by Lieutenant B. D. Foulois of
the U. S. Army, and the airplane reached
a speed of 42 miles per hour. The second
flight was made shortly thereafter with
Lieutenant Frank P. Lahm as a passenger.
Wright took the airplane aloft for one
hour and 20 minutes to establish a world's
endurance record.
These two flights represented the suc-
cessful flight tests of America's first mili-
tary airplane for which specifications had
been issued by the Signal Corps in De-
cember, 1907. The specifications called
for a plane that could carry two occupants,
fly for one hour, and attain a speed of 40
miles per hour. A number of bids had
been received and three accepted, but the
Wright brothers were the only ones to de-
liver an airplane.
The plane was officially approved and
accepted by the Signal Corps on August
2, 1909. The price was $25,000 plus a
$5,000 bonus for the extra speed.
It was two years later, in 1911, that the
first appropriation specifically for aviation
purposes was made by the Congress in the
sum of $125,000. This money made pos-
sible the purchase of new equipment and
the opening of the first military aviation
school at College Park, Maryland. De-
velopments came rapidly. The Air Service
began experiments with airborne radio
and aerial photography. The newly-in-
vented Riley-Scott bombsite and dropping
device was tested, and a Lewis machine
gun was fired from an airplane for the
first time. By the summer of 1911 Amer-

W. Stuart Symington became the first Secre-
tary of the Air Force on September 18, 1947.
To this office he brought a background of wide
industrial and engineering experience. In World
War I he enlisted as a private and, at 17, had
earned promotion to second lieutenant—one of
the youngest in the service. A member of the
class of 1923 at Yale, he was president of a
large corporation producng stainless steel just
nine years after completing his education. By
1939 he was head of the Emerson Manufactur-
ing Co. While consultant for the Army, he built
the world's largest airplane armament plant in
1941. Appointed Chairman of the Surplus Prop-
erty Board in 1945, he was made Assistant
Secretary of War for Air the following year.
His record in the newly-created high office of
Secretary of the Air Force has been resolutely
progressive and farsighted in all matters per-
taining to the air defense of our country.
ica's new military air arm boasted a force
of eight officers with pilot certificates and
five airplanes. By 1912, Army doctors,
forerunners of the Air Force's highly spec-
ialized flight surgeons, had established
"physical standards for pilots."
America's pioneer tactical aviation unit
—the First Aero Squadron—was organ-
ized at San Diego, California, in Decem-
ber, 1913, with a strength of 16 officers,
77 enlisted men, and six airplanes. It was
later to be the first U. S. air unit to see
combat action in World War I.
During 1914 and 1915, the develop-
ment of military aviation continued as the
Air Service devoted considerable time to
the testing and balancing of propellers,
to experimenting with lubricating oils,
and to research on automatic stabilizers.
Other experiments were carried out on
bombing techniques, spotting of subma-
rine mines, and signalling from aircraf/
by "Very" pistols and smoke bombs. A
portable airport complete with tent-type
hangar, machine shops, reserve fuel, and
extra equipment was developed for field
use.
Of especial significance to aviation was
the creation on March 3, 1915, of the
National Advisory Committee for Aero-
nautics to supervise and direct the scien-
tific study of flight problems.
The first operational assignment at-
tempted by America's military air service
was carried out by the First Aero Squad-
ron in 1916 during the Punitive Expedi-
tion on the Mexican border. The "results
were discouraging, to say the least. Equip-
ped with eight airplanes—approximately
one-half of our air strength at that time—
the squadron was ordered to the Mexican
city of Casas Grandes for immediate oper-
ations. One plane was forced to turn back
to its base at Columbus, New Mexico,
with a faulty engine; three became lost
and were forced to land in Mexico; and
the remaining four were forced down by
darkness. A reconnaissance mission the
following day encountered additional diffi-
culty. One plane was unable to gain
enough altitude to cross the Sierra Mad re
mountains; another, caught in wind gusts,
cracked up while landing.

FOR USE IN JET PROPULSION ENGINES
BY
STANLEY M. GAVERN, '50ChE
The metallurgist is faced with definite
consideration and problems in the design
of rocket motors. The engineer may sit
down and dream of the simplest or most
complicated rocket, but the metallurgist
must provide the materials necessary to
transpose the ideas of the designer into
the reality of the rocket. His problem is
real. He is limited by nature itself to the
elements; but by his own ingenuity he can
combine and alloy these elements to pro-
duce a metal suitable for the purpose at
hand.
It can be expected that materials operat-
ing at very high temperatures will deform
and deteriorate progressively from corro-
sion and structural instability. However,
the usefulness of any material will depend
upon the rate of deformation and de-
terioration being sufficiently slow so that
service loads can be carried for a definite
expected life of the unit without failure.
In addition, the consideration of mater-
ials which can be formed, welded, and
worked by the usual fabrication methods,

Stress and Rupture Machine
and which are economically available, is
important.
As yet aircraft jet propulsion engines
are of relatively short life application.
Operating stresses and temperature are
kept high for efficiency and to save
weight. The corrosion problem is not too

STANLEY M. GAVERN
difficult because the materials used, on the
basis of strength considerations, generally
have a suffifficient corrosion resistance.
The main problem has been to develop al-
loys with high strength at high tempera-
tures for a relatively short time and to be
able to produce them in quantity with high
quality and uniform properties.
The recent war has greatly accelerated
the development of these heat resistant
alloys. However, up to 1941 the back-
ground for the development of alloys with
high strength at high temperatures was
limited almost entirely to experience in
the steam power, oil, chemical, and fur-
nace construction industries. These appli-
cations were, almost invariably, for long
life at relatively low stresses and since
aircraft turbosuperchargers have a short
life requirement with high stresses not
too much information was available. The
known alloys at this time included carbon
steel, y2 per cent Molybdenum steel, with
Chromium contents up to 9%, and stain-
less steels of the 12% Chromium, 18%
Chromium—8% Nickel, 25% Chromium
—20% Nickel, and 15% Chromium—
35% Nickel types. Some experience with
65% Nickel—15% Chromium, 80%
Nickel—20% Chromium, and Inconel al-
loys was available.
Metallurgists working with the alloys
began to realize that precipitation reac-
tions of complex carbides and intermetal-
lic compounds were probable controlling
factors in the high temperature strength
of the more complex alloys. There were
other considerations available for use: re-
fractory metals with stable structures were
needed; austenitic base alloys were in-
herently stronger at high temperatures
than the ferritic alloys; Molybdenum,
Tungsten, Columbium, and Titanium
would improve the strength of steel at
elevated temperatures.
With these considerations in mind a
number of metallurgical organizations
started to develop alloys which would
have better high temperature, high
strength properties than known alloys.
A large number of compositions were
made up on an empirical basis and tested.
Some of these showed unusual properties
in the temperature region of 1200-1500
degrees F. These alloys eventually became
known as super alloys. Among the more
commonly known super alloys today are
Tinken alloy, Histalloy B, Vitallum, 19-9
DL, low carbon N 155, 5495, S 590,
S 816, Inconel X, 422-19, K 42-B, and
Refractalloy 26. This is not a complete
list, but it mentions some of the alloys
that have been used to some extent.

Problems in Fabrication
The development of these alloys for
large scale production has been a tedious
and expensive affair. In the process of
fabrication many difficulties are encoun-
tered. The metals are difficult to hot work
because of their high strength at elevated
temperatures; machining is difficult; in-
spection is difficult and critical; their
strength and ductility at high temperatures
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Creep testing materials at elevated temperatures
are erratic; and it is quite a task to repro-
duce commercially the quality of the ex-
perimental alloys.
Problems In Application
Not only does the fabrication of these
alloys present problems, but the picture is
further complicated by the actual appli-
cation of a metal to a particular engine
part. Every part of the engine involves
special considerations unique to its par-
ticular operating condition, frictional
characteristics, and design. A few of the
more important parts under consideration
are rotor blades, flame tubes, tail pipes,
and nozzle assembly.
Rotor Discs
In the rotor discs the materials of con-
struction must meet the requirements of
critical service at two locations: (1) the
high stresses in the hub due to rotation
of the rotor; (2) and the high stresses in
the rim due to the pull of the blades on
their fastenings. Usually in airplane tur-
bines the hub is cool but the stresses are
high. The operating temperature of the
rim has been estimated to be about 1200
degrees F. Yield strengths, at room tem-
perature, of 80,000 to 100,000 pounds
per square inch have been the criterion
given to the metallurgist for hub services.
Creep strength, for rim services, has
been the major consideration. Rupture
strength is sometimes used as a criterion
of service performance with the tendency
to force the stress for rupture in 100 and
1000 hours as high as possible. In order
to receive consideration, a new alloy has
to have rupture strength at 1200 degrees
F. in excess of 40,000 pounds per square
inch for fracture in 1000 hours.
The main criteria in rotor blade service
have been creep strength and ductility at
high temperatures. There is also some in-
dication that fatigue strength at high tem-
peratures should be considered. While in
service, the blade is subjected to tensile
TANKS
clearly understood. The service is classed
as extremely high temperature low stress
application and the usual source of failure
is the direct impingement of the flame
upon the metal. The reasons for this
flame impingement seem to be warpage of
the metal and unsteady flame characteris-
tics. Thus, the metallurgist is faced with
the problem of providing a material capa-
ble of adequate oxidation resistance at
temperatures of 1650-1900 degrees F.
The metal must have good formability and
good weldability to permit fabrication of
the complicated shapes of flame tubes and
it must have resistance to warpage to pre-
vent buckling and the formation of hot
spots. The resistance to heat shock with-
out cracking and the fatigue strength may
also be considered.
Tail Pipe and Cones
The materials required for the tail pipes
and cones are similar to those needed for
the flame tubes. Usually, though, that
temperatures of operation are a little
lower. But, again the main problem is
preventing warpage during the rapid heat-
ing and cooling which takes place while
the turbine is in service.
Nozzle Assembly
In the nozzle assembly we have a variety
of requirements which include oxidation,
distortion, creep, and erosion resistance.
Main airflow diagram
stresses due to rotation, steady gas bend-
ing stresses, and alternating gas bending
stresses, as the blades pass nozzles. Ex-
cessive vibrations at natural frequencies
of the blades may present a problem. The
temperature of service will range upwards
from 1300 degrees F. with the upper
limit, at maximum efficiency, being very
high.
Alloys for Flame Tubes
In providing an alloy for the flame
tubes of the combustion chamber quite a
bit of trouble has been encountered be-
cause property requirements are not too

of a turbo jet engine
Scaling at temperatures up to that of the
gas stream must be prevented to provide
good service. Creep strength must be
sufficient to withstand gas bending stresses
and is important in distortion resistance.
The alloy selected must not pit and erode
under the action of the gas stream be-
cause it is important to engine perform-
ance for the throat area and finish of the
nozzle blades to be maintained.

Magicians rely on the fact that "the
hand is quicker than the eye" in perform-
ing many mystifying tricks. But the in-
ability of the human eye to follow rapid
motions is a serious matter in automotive
research work.
To meet this problem, automotive firms
use special high-speed motion picture
cameras. They're constantly finding new
ways to improve and expand the useful-
ness of these cameras in research projects.
Where ordinary motion picture cameras
take 16 pictures per second, portable high-
speed cameras used by car firms can take
up to 10,000 pictures in a single second.
sually, though, a speed of 3,000 pictures
a second is fast enough for most research.
By projecting these pictures at the nor-
mal speed of 16 per second, researchers
can show in slow motion an operation that
actually took place in just a few thous-
andths of a second.
By putting special windows in engine
combustion chambers, they photograph
gasoline explosions. High-compression
engines were born in this way.
The camera shows how a car's springs
are depressed under sudden road shock,
and thus reveals places where engineers
must guard against destructive strains.
Special devices let the camera study
electrical equipment in operation, photo-
graph the flow of air over the surface of a
speeding car, and show the operation of
engine valves and vibrator points. From
such research comes more durability and
comfort in cars.
The cameras show how cutting tools
do their job, and check the performance
of other mechanisms that move at high
speeds in production work.
For example, one car firm had trouble
ith its "cold heading" machines—those
automatic wonders that gobble up metal
rods and spit out a steady stream of com-
pleted rivets, at a rate of three per second.
High-speed camera pictures of the
operations showed several places where
stock wasn't feeding properly into the ma-
chines, and showed that scrap metal wasn't
falling away as it should.
Engineers familiar with the cold-head-
ers had no trouble making adjustments
once they saw the operation in slow mo-
tion.
Most pictures of high-speed op-
erations are meaningless except
to experts. But here are seven
pictures, from a total of ISO taken
in one-twentieth of a second, that
reveal what high-speed cameras
can do. They show a housefly "tak-
ing off." The fly makes a complete
up-and-down stroke of his wings
154 times a second.
Ductile Cast Iron
Industry now has available to it a new
cast iron which, unlike ordinary cast iron,
is not brittle but can be bent or twisted.
This astounding new material can be made
readily and economically and can be used
in a myriad of applications, thus affording
countless economies throughout the in-
dustrial world. The novel product popu-
larly known as ductile cast iron, has sev-
eral times greater strength than ordinary
cast iron with greatly increased ductility
and shock-resistance.
This new ductile cast iron combines
processing advantages of cast iron, such as
fluidity, castability and machinability, with
many of the product advantages of steel.
The essential feature of the inventions is
the introduction into and retention by the
molten iron under treatment of a small
but effective amount of magnesium. The
presence of critical amounts of magnesium
in the novel cast iron produces a new
graphite structure which is in the form of
spheroids or compacted particles. Due to
the elimination of a substantial amount of
the usual weakening flake graphite, the
new magnesium-treated cast iron possesses
excellent engineering properties, particu-
larly high tensile strength, elastic modulus,
yield strength, toughness and ductility.
Under stress, it behaves elastically like
steel rather than like cast iron, having
proportionality of strain to stress up to
high loads with a modulus of elasticity of
about 25 million pounds per square inch.
Electronic Torch
Hot enough to cut holes in firebrick
and to melt tungsten, hardest to melt of
all the elements, an "electronic torch" has
been developed by scientists of the Gen-
eral Electric Company's Research Labora-
tory.
Dr. J. D. Cobine, G-E scientist, told the
Conference on Gaseous Electronics meet-
ing in Pittsburgh of combining high-
frequency radio signals and certain gases
to produce temperatures considerably
higher than the melting point of tungsten,
which is 3370 degrees Centigrade.
He emphasized that the electronic torch
is still at the laboratory stage, and that its
commercial possibilities have yet to be ex-
plored.

Mighty Midget
of Microwaves
This little electron tube is called the 416A.
It's the very heart of the latest radio relay
repeater equipment for telephone and tele-
vision transmission over long distances. Bell
Telephone Laboratories scientists designed
it—with elements spaced five times closer
than in any previous microwave tube—and
made the first samples under laboratory
conditions.
Could such a tube ever be factory-produced
in quantity? It seemed almost impossible—
but Western Electric engineers tackled the
ticklish problem. Here's the sort of thing
they had to deal with.
Between the grid, which controls the flow
of power in the tube, and the cathode, which
for rL
n
gineers
produces the electrons, must be a space 6/10
thousandths of an inch. The oxide coating
on the cathode must be 5/10 thousandths of
an inch — no more, no less. The grid wires
— 3/10 thousandths of an inch in diameter
— must be wound around the grid frame
one thousand times to an inch!
The tiny parts would have to be made with
laboratory precision. Much of the work would
have to be done under microscopes. All parts
would have to be kept surgically clean —for
a speck of lint or a trace of perspiration could
mar the efficiency of such sensitive tubes. New
machines would have to be designed —new
techniques developed—people trained to as-
semble the minute parts with utmost accuracy.
Could it be done? Well, Western Electric
is making 416A tubes in quantity today—and
with an amazingly low percentage of rejects.

This machine winds wire 1/8 the thickness of a human
hair around the grid (arrow) —1000 turns per inch —
maintains tension of 60% of wire's breaking strength.

BY
DR. ROBERT C. ANGELL
Professor of Sociology: Chairman, Dept. of Sociology
To engineers, who are accustomed to
thinking of science as applying to definite
objects like steam engines, airfoils,
bridges, buildings and electric generators,
it may seem strange to speak of a science
of human groups. We are all so conscious
of the shifting character of our own rela-
tions to other people that it is hard to
conceive that a science of group phenom-
ena is possible. Yet that is what sociology
aspires to be, and is, in fact, already be-
coming.
As can easily be imagined, the discovery
of the key variables for the analysis of the
structure and functioning of groups is
tremendously difficult. And this is just the
beginning. For sociologists have to meas-
ure the effect of changes in each variable
just as the physicist measures the effect of
changes of temperature on the length of
metallic rods.
Let us take a simple illustration of the
problems that confront the sociologist.
Some communities are marked by order,
others by disorder. In an ordered com-
munity crime rates are low, juvenile de-
linquency is rare, friction among sub-
groups like capital and labor is slight.
But in the disordered community, the con-
verse is true. What lies back of this con-
trast? What are the causes of the dif-
ference?
Naively, one might suppose that hered-
ity or geography had something to do
with the matter. Research proves, how-
ever, that these factors are of negligible
importance. There are both orderly and
disorderly communities of all races and
in all climates. Communities that are
equated for hereditary and geographical
factors will still show great variation in
their orderliness. Evidently the important
causal factors have to do with the social
situation itself. For instance, a significant
item is the degree of homogeneity of cul-
tural background among the residents.
If there are large numbers of immigrants
from various lands among them, then,
that will be an obstacle to well ordered
living because of differences in customs
and tradition. Another factor of im-
portance is the relative stability of the
population in terms of residence. If the
community has a high "turnover"—people
moving into it and others leaving it all
the time—there will be confusion. And

DR. ROBERT C. ANGELL
this confusion spells a lack of guidance
and discipline for many, especially the
young. One other variable of proven sig-
nificance is the leadership of the commu-
nity. We know that the degree to which
the leaders really understand the prob-
lems of the local residents makes a signifi-
cant difference in the orderliness of the
community.
Population processes and problems
form one focus of theory and research.
The industrial revolution, coupled with
advances in medicine and sanitation, and
improvement in farming techniques, has
completely changed the world population
picture since 1800. The trends in births
and deaths, the influence of migration
from country to country, the internal re-
distribution of population within coun-
tries—all these are studied and the at-
tempt is made to arrive at generalizations
or principles.
At the other extreme of the sociological
field is the interest in social psychology.
Here the concern is to understand the
interconnections between persons and
groups. Every person plays a role in
many groups. One problem is how the
individual accommodates himself to the
several demands of these roles. Another
is how a group trains persons for the vari-
ous roles that are necessary to its success-
ful functioning. Still a further one is the
mechanism of adjustment and cooperation
among those holding different roles in the
same group. Much of present-day indus-
trial sociology concerns itself with this
last problem.
Between population problems on the
one hand and social psychology on the
other lies the heart of the field of sociol-
ogy. Here we find a concern with social
groups and institutions, studied as wholes.
Above we gave an example showing one
method of studying communities. Fami-
lies, play groups, schools, churches, clubs,
charitable associations, business enter-
prises, and governmental units represent
relatively small-scale units. These can be
studied for the purpose of understanding
their present nature and function and the
typical processes of their change. There
are sociologists who specialize on the fam-
ily, on religious institutions, on educa-
tion and the like. Others investigate
groups that extend beyond the local com-
munity. The region is frequently treated
as a sociological unit, though there is some
disagreement about how best to define it.
Sociologists employ a larger number of
techniques in their research. Data are
gathered through census-type schedules,
interviews, questionnaires, personal docu-
ments, and by personal observation. Vari-
ous rating-forms have been devised which
help to determine a family's social class
by noting the contents of its living-room.
Once the data are gathered they are pro-
cessed whenever possible by statistical
methods. Where this is impossible, be-
cause the data are not in quantitative form,
the method of logical analysis is used.
For the person who wants a general ac-
quaintance with the subject of sociology,
but who does not have time to take
couTses in the field, Middletown and Mid-
dlelown in Transition by Robert and
Helen Lynd will serve as a good intro-
duction. They give an analysis of an
Indiana town at two periods in its de-
velopment.
Clifford Shaw has written a number of
fascinating case studies of juvenile delin-
quents, and Thrasher's, The Gang is a
standard work in this field. The classic
work on the problems of immigrants is
Thomas and Znanieski's, The Polish Peas-
ant in Europe and America, though the
general reader will want to omit the
lengthy methodological introduction.
Warren J. Thompson's books on popula-
tion are authoritative and readable.

Do YOU REMEMBER when winter meant storing the family
car till spring? Not so many years ago, a car owner's fear
of an ice-shattered motor was a dread reality ... if he didn't
drain his radiator and store his car once cold weather hit!
What was needed—acutely—was an automobile anti-freeze
that would prove always dependable yet economical. One
that would hold up under any operating temperature. That
wouldn't foam and boil away. That would resist rust and
corrosion to the nth degree.
That's where Union Carbide research entered the picture.
The result? "Preslone" anti-freeze. Since then this product
—the first all-winter anti-freeze—has assured millions upon
millions of motorists of ever-improved driving performance,
with assured safety . . . throughout the bitterest weather.
This is but one example of the way the people of Union

The Slide Rule Ball, presented annually
by the Michigan Technic, was held on
Saturday, November 19 at the Masonic
Temple.
Entering the lobby each couple was pre-
sented with a unique souvenir of the
dance, a miniature silver slide rule bear-
ing the names of the patrons and pa-
tronesses.
The engineers and their guests were
brought back to the "good ole days" when
they went into the ballroom. In keeping
with the theme of by-gone days the dance
floor was decorated with scenes of the
early 1900's. False fronts of stores typical
of the times were set up around the room
and featured such notable establishments
as "Emmons Iron Works," "Edmonson's
Pump Handle Saloon," and "Crawford's
Meat Market," specializing in "baloney
of all kinds." Also, a special section of
the dance floor, plus a booth, were set
aside for the use of the "Graybeards,"
which term applied to both faculty and
older students.
Equally as colorful as the dance itself
was the stupendous publicity campaign
carried on prior. In the words of Volt I.
Ohmist, interviewed on this subject as a
typical engineer, "It was without doubt
the most live-wire publicity campaign that
Michigan experienced during the month
of November, 1949."
The first shot of the move to make
Engineers social conscious was a group of
cartoon posters—each with an announce-
ment of Slide Rule Ball surmounted by an
individual cartoon in keeping with the
idea of interesting the Engineers in the
"other half's" way of life. This was fol-
lowed up by a group of baloons released
at the Indiana game, each enclosing a no-
tice about the dance. A contest was also
held in which free tickets to the Ball were
given for the five best reasons as to why
anyone should get a free ticket.
Climax of the campaign came with the
trial and "eggsecution" of two lawyers
caught trying to incite Engineers to boy-
cott the Slide Rule Ball, and instead
devote their semesters dating tine (one
night) to Crease Ball (an annual brawl
thrown by the Law Club). The lawyers
were tried in secret session by a group of
their peers, and then marched, at high
noon on Wednesday, November 16, to the
middle of the Diag, in chains, and fasten-
ed to trees, after their indictment and
sentence was read off, the sentence was
duly "eggsecuted" by the appointed
"eggsecutioner." After this, all passers-by
were invited to try their luck at ten paces
with tomatoes and eggs provided for the
purpose. The audience participation was,
to say the least, invigorating. As one of
the hapless victims put it, "Everyone on
the campus must have just flunked an
eleven o'clock Bluebook, and needed some
sort of 'Kigmy.'" Pictures of this event
went out on Associated Press wire-photo
to the state newspapers, spreading further
the name of Michigan.

Paying the Penalty
The Lawyers attempted to retaliate by
an attempted theft of the Engineers "Big"
Slide Rule. However, when the guests
arrived at Slide Rule Ball, the truth was
known, for on hand to cheer the the tech-
nicians was their mammoth slide rule
which was reportedly stolen earlier in the
week by a group of improperly oriented
lawyers. However, the clever engineers
thwarted this attempted abduction by sub-
stituting an imitation slide rule for the
original copy in the Technic office. The ill-
informed lawyers presented the "fake slip-
stick" to Governor G. Mennen Williams.
There have been no repercussions from
Lansing, as yet, so possibly Governor Wil-
liams, a former U. of M. law student, also
believes the false slide rule is the original
copy.
The entertainment at intermission was
in keeping with the theme. Beverly
Olezynski did some excellent novelty tunes
remindful of the days when "pa was
courtin' ma," and also a fine interpreta-
tion of George Gershwin's "Somebody
Loves Me."
The comedy was handled wonderfully
by Master of Ceremonies Joe Chestnut
and comedian Bill Gerson. Joe pleased
the audience with his conception of sev-
eral types of masters of ceremonies includ-
ing, "the card playing master of cere-
monies," the "sneaky M. C," and finally
a master of ceremonies who seemed to
have distinct feminine characteristics. Bill
Gerson did a clever pantomine dance
with the recording, "A Lovely Bunch ot
Coconuts" as background, and finished an
excellent barrage of gags with his version
of "I Never See Maggie Alone."
The program was completed with some
old time barbershop quartet harmonizing
by the "Four Horsemen," four fellows
attending Michigan Normal College.
Their singing was so fine that orchestra
leader Paul LaVoie asked the boys to
make an appearance on radio station
WJR later in the week.
Refreshments of all kinds were avail-
able downstairs and a photographer was
on hand to take snapshots of those couples
who wanted a pictorial souvenir of the
evening.
Music for dancing was adequately
handled by Paul LaVoie and his WJR
orchestra. There was plenty of variety in
the music, swing, fox trot, smooth
waltzes, and for the Latin American fans,
a number of good rhumbas and tangos.
Ample room for dancing made the eve-
ning very enjoyable. The orchestra con-
cluded the evening with a fine program of
all request tunes including such old fav-
orites as "Star Dust," "Sleepy Lagoon,"
"Body and Soul," and "Begin the Be-
guine."
Lexie E. Herrin, II, was general chair-
man of Slide Rule Ball, aided by co-
chairmen of decorations Paul Fromm and
Jim Graham, Al Forman, publicity, Har-
vey Schatz, programs and patrons, R A.
Humes, music; Walter Oberreit, intermis-
sion entertainment; Tom Bassert, tickets,
and last, but far from least, was finance,
headed by Bob Giglio. The staff was fill-
ed by members of the Michigan Technic
and by volunteers from the professional
societies.

throwing away a book? You never did.
You never will. Do you realize what this
means?
In nature the fecundity of plants and
animals is counteracted by mortality from
predatory beings, diseases and such, other-
wise any organism no matter how small
would in time fill the earth.
In the case of libraries, however, there
is no death—only birth. The number of
books in the world doubles six times a
century in spite of an occasional fire
either accidental or premeditated, as in
Germany during the world wars.
It seems likely therefore that if atomic
energy doesn't destroy civilization man-
kind will eventually be crowded off the
earth by his own libraries. Let's examine
some cases.
In the year 2040 Yale Library, at its
present rate of growth, will contain 200
million volumes occupying 6,000 miles
of shelves. It will require a staff of 6,000
librarians to do the cataloging alone to
say nothing of the rest of the hired hands.
In two more centuries a staff of 23 million
cataloguers will be required and the library
will contain 820 billion volumes. Suppose
these were stored in a three-story building
each floor occupied by stacks ten shelves
high with allowance for access and other
facilities. The building would occupy 400
solid square miles of ground space of
which about 10 square miles would be
taken up with card indexes. If each build-
ing were built on 200 ft blocks with 80 ft.
streets, the area occupied would be 750
square miles—21/2 times the present area
of New York City.
There are 700 principal colleges and
universities in the United States. If they
all had equivalent libraries, by the year
ilOO the entire area of the United States
—3 million square miles—would be oc-
cupied by libraries and we will then in-
deed be suffocated in our own intellectual
excreta.
The L.S.U. Engineer
Nov. 1949
The engineering profession stands to-
day upon the threshold of an almost en-
tirely new era in the course of human
affairs. No longer is the engineer chained
to his slide rule and drawing board, nor
is he limited to his technical education.
Gradually over the past two decades the
owners of business and industry have
grown to rely upon the engineer for top
levels of industrial management and co-
ordination. It is now realized that the
logical and dispassionate analysis of a
problem, coupled with a methodical ap-
proach to the solution as employed by
the engineer, is the most effective way to
realize progress in any field. This is not
to say that one can rule out the element of
humanity present in all problems of busi-
ness and industry. In fact the human
element will be emphasized as we proceed
further. During the decades mentioned,
engineers have been coming to the front
in many of the business and industrial
enterprises of America. On every hand
we find engineers assuming the manage-
ment of giant corporations as well as
smaller concerns. Even more significantly,
we find them speaking out upon the press-
ing issues of our day, taking part in the
life of their communities and country as
never before.
The future for the engineering profes-
sion seems to be one of ever-expanding
horizons. It is being called upon to fur-
nish many of the men who are to be active
in world leadership, and the only limit on
participation seems to be the adequately
qualified men that it can furnish. If the
student is to be equipped to take his
part in this movement, he must begin to
prepare now. He must decide how to in-
tegrate all of the complex problems that
are his by virtue of his vocation and his
responsibility to others. In the future,
he will be, to a great extent just what he
makes himself today.

We are again approaching the time of
year at which we celebrate the birth of
one who has done more than any other
single individual to awaken in men the
realization that the right way of life is
the life of good, truth, and love. No other
man, before or since, has been able to
produce such a profound and lasting re-
form of man's thinking in the few short
years of a lifetime.
As we approach, then, this Christi
time let us stop and see just what it shouli
mean to us as individuals. Let's think for
a moment on the significance which
Christmas should really have.
Christmas in the last few years has
taken on an ultra-commercialism which is
anything but in keeping with the true
spirit behind this important event. The
commercialism is not so bad in itself, but
only as it causes us to forget the real
meaning of Christmas. Where did this
business of giving gifts begin anyway?
The first ones were brought, of course,
by the prophets on the first Christmxs,
but the giving of gifts has grown to mean
even more than that first token of homage
to a new king. It has become a symbol
of men's desire to live in peace together
and the recognition of the importance of
the other man as an individual in the
sight of God. This is the true meaning
of giving gifts, and we would all do well
to remember it when we are caught up in
the rush of Christmas shoppers. It is not
the material gift that is important, but
the spirit in which it is given and the
principle for which it stands.
Nebraska Blue Print
Dec. 1948
In the last four or five years we have
heard much of the movement to expand
all curricula in engineering to five years
in length for the joint purpose of en-
larging on the humanistic education of
the engineer, as well as to provide for
more extensive technical education. At
least four prominent engineering schools
have gone over to the five-year plan. Five
years means a 25 percent increase in cost
to the student or his parents. To the col-
lege administration it means increased
dormitory capacity, increased numbers of
teachers, classrooms, laboratories, and
equipment. Not many engineering schools
have the resources to finance such an in-
crease in plant and in operating expenses.
The alternative seems clear—to retain the
four-year curricula with a strong stem of
humanistic and social studies common to
all, with a core of general engineering;
fundamentals and specialized technical
programs to round out the total.

Why we know this wax carton will stand up
Cartons and wrapping papers coated with
paraffin wax have been used in food packag-
ing for many years. They must be able to
withstand rough treatment. Their ability to
stand up depends largely on the strength and
sealing qualities of the coating agent. Yet
until a few months ago, there was no accu-
rate way to measure these qualities in paraf-
fin wax.
Recent experimental work in Standard
Oil's laboratories has resulted in a new elec-
trically controlled quantitative test. Ex-
pressed as Indiana Coating Index, this test
gives, for the first time, an accurate yard-
stick of wax qualities which may be corre-
lated with performance in service. It makes
possible the production of uniformly high
quality coating agents.
The Indiana Coating Index is only one of
many scientific tests developed in Standard
Oil laboratories. Standard pioneered in qual-
ity-testing, as it did in developing many
petroleum products that have contributed to
better living. There is no ceiling on what can
be accomplished by Standard Oil researchers,
present and future.

New Frontiers of Industry!
By EDWIN H. BROWN, Vice President. Engineering Development Division
Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company (Graduate Training Course 1908 j
WILL IT WORK? Is it prac-
tical? Is there a belter
way to do it? If you feel the
challenge in questions like these
and get a thrill out of finding
the answers — perhaps you're
cut out for research.
There are a lot of us like that
hereat Allis-Chalmers. Pio-
neering beyond the immediate
frontiers of industry has been one of the
major factors in the growth of this com-
pany for over 100 years. Yet today we're
finding more exciting frontiers to explore
than ever before.
My part in this work started back in
1906 when I joined the Allis-Chalmers
EDWIN H. BROWN
Measuring cavitation resistance of
various materials for pumps and hy-
draulic turbines. Material under test is
electronically vibrated at a high rate
while submerged in water.
Graduate Training Course, from the Uni-
versity of Nebraska. During my two years
in the course, I spent a good deal of time
on the test floor. That's the spot where
original thinking, new designs, and new
methods pay off in results. It's a great
vantage-point from which to watch in-
dustrial development at work.
After completing my GTC, I worked
as a test engineer ... as development
and sales engineer on steam turbines.. .
as a chief engineer and department
manager... and into my present work in
research and development.
Unusual Range of Activities
Research here at A-C covers a
tremendous range of industrial
fields. I might point out that
product development is con-
sidered a responsibility of each
product department, while the
central research and develop-
ment organization works with
the many departments in a staff
capacity. Since Allis-Chalmers produces
important machinery for every basic in-
dustry, you can see that our develop-
ment work is extremely varied.
It includes such things as methods of
burning coal deposits underground, to
produce power without the intermediate
steps of mining, processing and transport-

front, the squadron returned to Columbus,
its first war service completed. Six of its
original eight aircraft had been abandoned
or destroyed; the other two had to be
condemned.
This tactical failure demonstrated that
additional funds were needed to develop
our air arm, and an emergency appropria-
tion of $500,000 was made by the U. S.
Congress in March.
The year 1917 was one of expansion
for the Army air arm, known then as the
Aviation Section. It was a year of tre-'
mendous problems for there were many
obstacles in the path of aviation progress.
Limited government support and general
public apathy had produced very little
aeronautical achievements from the first
Wright plane up to the end of 1916. In
eight years, less than 200 planes had
been delivered to the Aviation Section.
Not only was our aviation industry wholly
inadequate, but, between 1908 and 1917,
only 139 men had been trained to fly.
None had enough experience for combat.
On April 16, 1917, the date of our
entry into World War I, the Air Service
had a strength of 65 officers, 35 of whom
were flyers, and 1,087 enlisted men. They
were equipped with 55 aircraft, all obso-
lete. In terms of aviation the United
States ranked fourteenth among the na-
tions of the world. And the Premier of
France was urging us to have 5,000 pilots
and 4,500 planes at the front by the
spring of 1918. It was a big order, but
we went right to work trying to fill it.
Although our accomplishments fell short
of the very optimistic program to which
we were committed. American air strength
grew greater with each passing day, and
had the war continued, it would have
been but a short time before this country
assumed the leading position in world
aeronautics.
On October 9, 1918, in an operation
which foreshadowed the historic air
mission bombs were released electrically
from mounts under the bomber's fuselage,
a decided improvement over earlier meth-
ods when bombardiers carried their mis-
siles in a basket and literally "threw"
them at their targets.
One month before, a fleet of nearly
1,500 planes—American, British, and
French—had carried out highly successful
strategic operations under the command
of Colonel "Billy" Mitchell in support of
the large-scale drive against St. Mihiel.
It has been computed that the net cost
of our World War I military air effort
was $608,100,671.17. This was less than
the cost of artillery shells and other high
explosives used by the American Army on
a 19-mile front during seven weeks of the
Argonne offensive.
Between wars, the United States had 23
years to build and strengthen her Air
Power. A need for it had been definitely
established, but just what its place should
be and how it should fit into the overall
military establishment were to be debated
through the years.
However, despite its organizational
growing pains and a consistent lack of
financial support, the Air Service con-


Major H. A. Dargue after his plane had been forced to land at Chihuahua City
during the Punitive Expedition into Mexico. Rocks scattered on the ground were
hurled by the angry Mexican mob
battles of World War II, more than 200
American bombers, escorted by about 100
pursuit planes and 53 three-place aircraft,
broke up a German counter-assault by
dropping 22 tons of bombs and destroy-
ing a dozen enemy fighter planes. On this
tinued to progress. During the ten years
that followed 1918, Army flyers were the
fisr to refuel in mid-air, the first to fly
non-stop across the country, the first to fly
from the United States to Hawaii, and

the first to fly around the world. Aerial
forest fire patrols were flown, starting in
1919; and some 4,000 forest fires were
discovered and reported over a four-year
period by the aerial rangers, saving mil-
lions of dollars of valuable timber.
One of the first real tests of the effec-
tiveness of air power against naval forces
was carried out by the Air Service in 1921
under the direction of General Billy
Mitchell. On July 13, 11 pursuit planes
bombed the German destroyer G-102 with
300-pound bombs. It sank in 19 minutes.
Five days later a group of Martin bomb-
ers sent a German light cruiser to the bot-
tom in 35 minutes.
The most important operation was con-
ducted on July 21. The target this timet
was the heavily-armored Gerrran battle-
ship, Ostfriedland. Seven Martin bomb-
ers attacked the ship, each dropping one
2,000-pound bomb. Seven minutes later
she sank.
Army airmen proved to be good diplo-
mats as well as flyers during the 22,000
Good Will Tour of Central and South
America that began on December 21,
1926, and ended on May 2, 1927. When
the expedition, commanded by Major
Herbert A. Dargue, returned to Wash-
ington, the flyers were decorated by Presi-
dent Coolidge, and an ambassador re-
ported that the flight had accomplished
"more good than ten years of diplomatic
correspondence."
During this ten-year period between
1918 and 1928, the Air Service continued
its research and development program
and many notable technical achievements
were announced. Among the new de-
velopments were the leak-proof gasoline
tank, the free parachute pack, and the
supercharger. A 37 mm cannon was
mounted and fired from a Martin bomber,
important developments in Aircraft de-
sign. The first all-metal bomber, the Boe-
ing B-9, a mid-wing monoplane with re-
tractable landing gear, was built in 1931.
The following year Martin delivered the
famous B-10 bomber to the Air Corps.
At that time the B-10, capable of a speed
of over 200 miles per hour, was the fast-
est and heaviest bomber in the world.
By 1935, the 15-year transition from
wood and fabric to metal for aircraft
construction was completed. All military
aircraft procured that year were of all-
metal construction, and by year-end Air
Corps technicians had made considerable
progress in eliminating destructive vibra-
tion "bugs" from aircraft structures.
February, 1936, marked the introduc-
tion of the plane that was later to become
the backbone of the Air Force—the Boe-
ing B-17 Flying Fortress. The first B-17
was delivered to Langley Field, Virginia,
on March 1, 1937, where the Second
Bombardment Group had been set up to
train Flying Fortress pilots and crews.
However, only 13 B-17s were delivered
up to the outbreak of war in Europe in
1939.
The record of the AAF in World War
II is well-known. In sharp contrast to
World War I, America took the lead in
military aviation. Almost overnight we
became the world's greatest power in the
air. The Aeronautical Division of 1916,

The Fairchild C-82 Packet, with its ingenious capacity for cubic footage and its self-
contained loading ramp, is one reason for the gratifying success of the "Opera-
tion Vittles" into Berlin
and reversible and variable pitch propel-
lers were developed. Also during this
period came the development of racks to
accommodate 4,000-pound bombs.

How to improve
a wood hog's appetite
The wood hog shown here chews up logs for paper
pulp like a giant pencil sharpener. As they chip away
at the logs, the revolving cutter knives impose heavy
shock loads on the bearings. To carry these shock
loads, engineers specified that the cutter shaft be
mounted on Timken® tapered roller bearings. Due
to the line contact between the rolls and races,
Timken bearings have extra load carrying capacity
—take the heaviest shock loads.
Here's how engineers use
TIMKEN bearings (or heavy
shock loads
To give extra support to the wood hog's main shaft,
double-row Timken bearings are used. The tapered
construction of the rolls and races enables Timken
bearings to carry both radial and thrust loads in any
combination. Shafts are held in rigid alignment, end
movement eliminated. Because Timken bearings
permit the use of effective closures, lubricant stays
in and dirt and moisture are kept out.

Piloted by Capt. C. E. Yeager, the Bell X-l experimental plans has exceeded
the speed of sound
strument of modern warfare. This fact
was recognized by the American people
when Congress passed the National Se-
curity Act of 1947 which separated the
Air Force from the Army and established
it as a co-equal member of the National
Military Establishment.
Today, as we move forward into the
Air Age, the U. S. Air Force continues
to erect new milestones along the road of
aeronautical progress. New developments
in the field of jet propulsion, rocket pro-
pulsion, atomic energy, guided missiles,
automatic flight, and radar are being care-
fully evaluated and exploited as we build
for the future.
It is significant that the post-war period
has brought about what is generally con-
sidered to be the greatest aeronautical
achievement since the Wright brothers'
memorable flight at Kitty Hawk more
than 45 years ago; the flight by man at
speeds faster than that of sound. This
epic accomplishment first achieved by Air
Force Captain Charles E. Yeager in the
Bell X-l research plane is truly repre-
sentative of the Air Force and of those
men who have guided the destiny of
aviation.
It is truly characteristic also of those
aviation pioneers who, starting with the
Wright brothers, have always refused to
concede that what has not been done
cannot be done.

News photo of crowds watching television on Boston Common.
WHAT MAKES TELEVISION SO CLEAR?
"Lots of things, Jackie! But mostly brains. The brains of men who know how to make electrons behave in
tubes. Electrons are tiny particles of electricity. They're boiled out of metal wires by heating units. Much
the same way as an electric stove boils water. But if the heating unit isn't right, everything goes wrong."



"The tube people are smart, son. They
make sure the heating units give off the
right heat and last longer by coating
them with a fine Norton refractory.
Alundum 38900 grain, we call it. It's
so fine that ten grains end to end equal
the thickness of a piece of paper.
'Alundum refractory grain is great stuff.
Its melting point is 2015°C. That's real
hot! Made into corrugated baffle plates,
it doubles the efficiency of enameling
ovens. That's why the surfaces of such
things as refrigerators and electric stoves
come so hard and smooth.
"Some people know Norton only as the
world's largest maker of grinding wheels
and machines, Jackie. But refractories
in many sizes, shapes and materials are
important Norton products, too. They're
used in kilns, furnaces and ovens when-
ever industry wants to get the most out
of high temperatures... safely."


"So, you see, son, from
television tubes to re-
frigerators, Norton Products help make
all kinds of products better. That's why
the experienced heads and willing hands
that make up the Norton team try a little
harder to make Norton products better."

has been primarily limited to four main
classes; (1) hardenable ferritic steels,
(2) austenitic base alloys, (3) age-hard-
enable alloys, and (4) precision cast co-
balt base alloys.
Hardenable Ferritic Steels
The first of these, the hardenable fer-
ritic steels, have not been used extensively
in this country, but they have met with
considerable success in England and Ger-
many. These alloys are used in Europe
because of their low cost and good fabri-
cation characteristics. The main drawback
to the use of ferritic steel is that they are
not suitable for performance at high tem-
perature. But there is no doubt that these
alloys would be suitable if the temperature
was limited to 1000 degrees F. The best
steels for use in this range are the Cr-Mo-
Va type with 0.2-0.4 percent carbon and
experience indicates that better high tem-
perature properties are obtained by nor-
malizing from 1700-1750 degrees F. and
tempering, rather than oil quenching, back
to the desired physical properties. The
low expansion of these steels decreases the
thermal stresses and the low cost and ease
Creep measurement at elevated
temperatures
of fabrication will certainly make these
alloys important in the future.
Austenitic Base Alloys
The austenitic base alloys include ma-
terials that contain sufficient nickel and
chromium to develop stable austenite,
have various combinations of molyb-
denum, tungsten, cobalt, columbium, and
titantum added to enhance the strength at
high temperatures, and do not harden
substantially without cold work. These
alloys will withstand high temperatures
up to 1350 degrees F. with high strength
and are therefore, very useful for aircraft
turbines. After 1350 degrees F. there is a
drop in strength properties presumable
due to structural instability. The reason
for the strength of these alloys at high
temperature is not too clearly understood.
A theory has been developed which states
that strength, at either low or high tem-
peratures, is dependent upon strain hard-
ening and the composition, size, and
distribution of carbides, nitrates, and in-
termetallic compounds. The relative im-
portance of these effects is not known
except that the changes in the high tem-
perature properties of plain Chromium-
Nickel austentic steels, as a result of hot-
cold work, is negligible compared with
the changes in alloys containing Mo, W,
Cb, and Ni which are strong formers of (Continued on page )0)

carbides and other compounds. In addi-
tion to strength consideration of these
alloys it is important to note other charac-
teristics that are important to their use:
high cost; difficulty in fabrication due to
their high strength at elevated tempera-
tures; and difficulty in machining and
welding. Welding is particularly impor-
tant in any proposed high volume pro-
duction.
Age Hardening Alloys
The age hardening alloys are important
for gas turbine service because they pro-
vide high yield strength at room tempera-
ture as well as high rupture strength at
elevated temperatures. An additional ad-
vantage of these alloys is that they can be
machined while in the soft-solution condi-
tion prior to aging. These alloys have an
austenitic base, and usually contain
titanium and aluminum to furnish the pre-
cipitation phase. Columbium and molyb-
denum also act as aging elements in some
alloys. A discussion of the properties,
composition, and service conditions of
these alloys is too complex in nature to
take up in this article, however, there are
several important principles which may be

the use of many alloys with excellent
properties, which are impossible or diffi-
cult to fabricate by forging, or whose
properties would be destroyed by the forg-
ing process. In many cases, especially for
use in turbine blades, the cast alloys are
more suitable for service than are the
wrought metals. Another very important
point to note is that at temperatures some-
where between 1350-1500 degrees F. the
high temperature strength of the cast form
becomes superior to that of the wrought
metal. However, it is common knowledge
that casting processes involve numerous
problems. The properties of the materials
may be influenced by pouring tempera-
tures, mold temperature, and casting size
and shape. In addition, large grain size,
which is believed to be associated with
fatigue strength, may be encountered in
numerous casting applications.
As the rocket industry advances, it
brings with it many challenges to the
metallurgist. Most of the work is en-
tirely new and cannot be compared with
past experience in metallurgy. The future
of rockets and aircraft turbsuperchargers
depends upon the materials which can be
developed, and upon their correct applica-
tion by the metallurgist.

a "magnetron," which produces radio
waves with the extremely high frequency
of one billion cycles per second. Leading
from the tube is an antenna made of two
short metal cylinders, one within the
other. A high-frequency arc can be made
to form on the end of the antenna. If
certain gases, among them nitrogen and
carbon dioxide, are fed past the arc, the
electronic torch results, resembling a jet
of flame about nine inches long.
The high temperature produced on any
surface placed in the jet are caused almost
entirely by the heat generated by atoms
joining together to form molecules, Co-
bine said. The molecules of certain gases
are broken up into atoms by the high-
frequency arc. These atoms join together
again on surfaces placed in the torch.
The jet itself is not necessarily hot.
The arc can break up nitrogen mole-
cules, which are ordinarily composed of
two nitrogen atoms, into two separate
atoms. When these two atoms strike a
surface, they reunite and give off heat, he
said. Argon, helium, and other gases
that exist normally as single atoms give a

they cannot be broken into two atoms and
rejoined. An electronic torch composed
of one of these gases gives off light, due
to motion of the electrons caused by the
radio waves, but a hand can be inserted
in it without ill effects.
Atomic Education
The nation's engineering schools will
probably be able to meet all the demands
likely to be made on them with the de-
velopment of the atomic power industry,
declared Dr. Kenneth H. Kingdon, as-
sistant director of the General Electric Re-
search Laboratory.
Dr. Kingdon, who heads the Knolls
Atomic Power Laboratory operated by
the G-E Research Laboratory for the
Atomic Energy Commission, said that the
great majority of the technical people
needed in the atomic power field in the
future will require the same sort of train-
ing now being given in chemistry, physics,
engineering and metallurgy. Perhaps, he
added, not more than 10 per cent will re-
quire more specialized knowledge of nu-
clear physics.
Most of this will have to be obtained
on the job, rather than in the universities,
he said, because security and expense con-
siderations will prevent colleges from in-
stalling the experimental atomic reactors
or "furnaces" and other equipment and
materials needed for such training.
Even a larger group than the 10 per
cent with specialized knowledge in nu-
clear physics, Dr. Kingdon said, will need
practical knowledge on the handling of
radioactive materials in bulk. This group
will consist of chemists, chemical engi-
neers and health physicists, and their
knowledge, too, will probably have to be
obtained on the job.
The G-E scientist stated that security
regulations, concerning access to the lab-
oratory and the safeguarding of confiden-
tial materials and documents, have been
less troublesome than originally antici-
pated.
Dr. Kingdon warned the educators that
the men required for atomic energy de-
velopment will be concerned with radi-
cally new developments, and there will be
none of the type of engineering which

CARBON MONOXIDE...
FRIEND OF MAN
Thanks to high-pressure synthesis, it now leads a useful life
To the man on the street, carbon
monoxide is just a poisonous gas that
sometimes causes tragic deaths when
it escapes from the exhaust of an
automobile or from a poorly tended
furnace.
Outside of the chemical field, few
people are aware that, properly used,
it is a very real friend of man. In the
last 25 years, during which catalytic

make 3,5,5-trimethylhexanol.
and high-pressure chemical tech-
niques have been highly developed,
carbon monoxide has become a key-
stone of industrial synthesis.
Scientists have found that under
the proper conditions of high press-
ure and temperature, carbon mon-
oxide, in combination with other
substances, can be converted to a
variety of useful products. These or
their derivatives range from an acid
used in tanning hides to the spar-
kling plastics in milady's boudoir.
You'd hardly associate carbon mon-
oxide with anti-freeze. But at tem-
peratures from 300 to 450°C. and
under pressures of 1500 to 15,000
pounds per square inch, carbon mon-
oxide and hydrogen unite to form
methanol—a colorless liquid from
which is made "Zerone" anti-rust
anti-freeze for automobiles. From
methanol and carbon monoxide as
raw materials, ethylene glycol for
"Zerex" anti-freeze is produced.
Plastics and Antl-Freeze
Methanol is used also to make a
large number of compounds such as
formaldehyde and methyl metha-
crylate. The former goes into urea-
and phenol-formaldehyde plastics for
light fixtures, radio cabinets, hard-
ware, utensils, and electrical equip-
ment. The latter is the basic mate-
rial for "Lucite" acrylic resin with
its many uses.

The reaction of methanol with
carbon monoxide leads to acetic acid,
which is a well-known industrial
chemical. By the same synthesis but
substituting ethanol for methanol,
propionic acid is obtained. From it
come the "Mycoban" sodium and
calcium propionates that retard
mold and rope in bakery products.

pressures. However, the possibilities
have by no means been exhausted.
Just recently, for example, chemists
have been learning how to use car-
bon monoxide in "up-grading" cer-
tain petroleum hydrocarbons to give
interesting alcohols. One of these,
3,5,5-trimethylhexanol, is prepared
from diisobutylene by reaction with
carbon monoxide and hydrogen.
College-trained men and women
interested in working in this field at
Du Pont may share in discoveries as
outstanding as any yet achieved.
Because of the wide scope of
Du Font's activities, young graduates
in many different fields have oppor-
tunities to select the careers that
prove to suit them best as their abili-
ties and interests develop.

Improved Fire Trucks
Better fire trucks are being built today—and at double the
rate at which they were made before the war.
Pictured below is one new type with a steel extension ladder
that shoots up 100 feet into the air with the flick of an auto-
matic control.
Outrigger jacks on the truck let the ladder be tilted at
angles that once would have upset the truck. A gage at the
base shows exactly what load the ladder can take relative to
angle and height.
Today's pumper trucks can pour out up to 2,000 gallons of
water a minute through four hoses—at a force that would
break a man's leg if the stream of water hit him.
Last year, an estimated 2,000 fire trucks were produced in
U. S., or about double the prewar rate. This year, output re-
mains at the 1948 level, with some 27 firms making fire trucks
that range in price from $4,5500 to $30,000 depending on
size and equipment.

1 he ring test, shown above, is a scientific
method for determining the modulus of rupture
of pipe. It is not a required acceptance test but one
of the additional tests made by cast iron pipe manu-
facturers to ensure that the quality of the pipe
meets or exceeds standard specifications.
A ring, cut from random pipe, is subjected to
progressively increased crushing load until failure
occurs. Standard 6-inch cast iron pipe, for example,
withstands a crushing weight of more than 14,000
Ibs. per foot. Such pipe meets severe service re-
quirements with an ample margin of safety.
Scientific progress in the laboratories of our
members has resulted in higher attainable stand-
ards of quality in the production processes. By
metallurgical controls and tests of materials, cast
iron pipe is produced today with precise knowl-
edge of the physical characteristics of the iron
before it is poured into the mold. Constant control
of cupola operation is maintained by metal analy-
sis. Rigid tests of the finished product, both ac-
ceptance tests and routine tests, complete the
quality control cycle. But with all the remarkable
improvements in cast iron pipe production, we do
not forget the achievements of the early pipe

PROBLEM — Every so often, as the commutator segments
of large motors wear down, the mica between them must
be cut down. Your problem is to work out a tool which
permits the undercutting to be done without removing the
armatures from the motors.
THE SIMPLE ANSWER— An S.S.White power drive flex}.
ble shaft hooked up to an electric motor gives you the basis
of a portable power unit for driving small rotary saws. A
handpiece designed for mounting the saws finishes the tool.
The Illustration below shows such a unit made by the Martin-
dale Electric Co., of Cleveland, Ohio.
The time and labor-saving advantages of having an
easily manipulated power tool which can be brought to
the work, can be readily appreciated. S.S.White flexible
shafts make practicable the development of such tools for
many purposes.
This is just one of hun-
dreds of power drive

U. S. has 27,000 fire departments, of which over 20,000
are in rural areas or towns below 1,000 population. Fire Engi-
neering magazine estimates there are nearly 32,000 fire vehicles
on towns of 1,000 or more population, and one large equip-
ment manufacturer estimates there are even more fire trucks
in smaller towns and rural districts.
Much of this equipment is 20 years old or more. Replace-
ments were hard to get during the war and for several years
afterward. Also, postwar growth of urban areas has brought
demands for more fire equipment.
Another reason for the rising demand is that costs of replac-
ing burned homes and buildings have soared, making more in-
insurance coverage necessary. Since insurance rates depend
largely on the amount of fire-fighting equipment in the area,
many communities and rural districts have found it's cheaper
to buy more fire trucks than to pay the penalty of heavy in-
surance rates.
Since the war, many states also have created fire districts for
the whole state, with standards of fire protection calling for
more fire trucks.

Through a research project for the investigation of internal stresses in reinforced concrete,
not only did a graduate student in Civil Engineering complete work for his doctoral disser-
tation, but further, he developed data that will be of value in advancing the economical and
effective use of this construction material.
Instruction in the techniques of applied research and problem analysis is an important
part of engineering education.
Structural Engineering is one of the major electives in the Civil Engineering curriculum

Philip Dawson, in his didactic editorial
in the December 8 issue of The Michigan
Daily, states that Michigan Engineers
merely exist on an animal level. He lacks
polish. He infers that this elusive polish
is attainable in other colleges of the Uni-
versity. But it is interesting to note that
when an engineer finally decides that he
can not or should not continue studying
engineering, that generally he is advanced
several classes ahead when he transfers to
another college.
Is this because he lacks polish? No, it
is not. It is because the Engineer has had

his advance to knowledge guided in a
manner that will encourage logical and
concise thinking. He does not use fifty
words where five will suffice. The Engi
neer marshalls his facts, studies them in
an orderly manner and then makes his
conclusions. He does not, as is so often
the case in the so-called broader educa-
tions, make his conclusions, study them,
then gather his facts.
It was mentioned that the Engineer is
not able to discuss anything but sine func-
tions, electron beams and the like. In
many cases this may be true. However, let
us draw a parallel with the broader edu-
cations. Is it not true that many times
these people who are able to engage in
delightful light conversation, are not
capable of serious discussion.
It has often been said that Engir
usually belong to the conservative group
because they do not know enough to be-
long to the "enlightened" groups. Ratl
the opposite is true because the Engine
has his feet on the ground. He thinks in
logical patterns. He does not feel that I
world owes him a living but rather
he must do constructive work that
merit reward.
I do not say that engineering colleg
are perfect—not by any means; but
fact remains that the scientific approach i
taught in the present engineering

Du Pont's Newest Fiber

In bringing benefits of Orion* acrylic fiber to you
Strong sunlight will damage most
fibers—but not "Orion" acrylic fiber,
the latest synthetic yarn to come
from the Du Pont laboratories. This
remarkable fiber, which took eight
years of intensive research to de-
velop, has a lasting resistance to sun-
light, mildew, high temperatures and
even sulfuric acid. Experts say that
it is the best fiber yet found for out-
door use.
In 1940, Du Pont scientists began
work on a new fiber that seemed to
have unusual properties. Develop-
ment continued during the war when,
under the name "Fiber A," the out-
put went for military use in the hot,
humid South Pacific. Recently the
Du Pont Company decided to build
a plant at Camden, South Carolina,
for full-scale production. This new
plant will cost about twenty-two
million dollars.
While samples of "Orion" fiber are
now in the hands of knitters, weavers

of clothing.
In developing the uses of "Orion,"

only new and better products, but
more jobs, more business activity and

EDITOR'S NOTE:
A study of this battle reveals, more vividly
than a thousand congressional investigations,
the limitations inherent in a system of divided
command. Kincaid's Seventh Fleet was under
General MacArthur's command while Halsey's
Third Fleet was under Admiral Nimlti's com-
mand. Much of the confusion in Kincaid's
mind was a result of this division.
It is interesting to note that Admiral Sher-
man, the present Chief of Naval Operations,
was in command of Task Force 38.3, a part of
Halsey's Third Fleet. Both Sherman, and the
late Admiral Mitcher, were in disagreement with
Halsey when he decided to take the whole Third
Fleet north to meet Admiral Ozawa's decoy.

By midsummer of 1944 Japan's posi-
tion in the Pacific war was almost unten-
able. Her capacity for making war had
been steadily reduced by the loss of im-
portant weapons in her land campaigns
and the long sought for fleet action had
been prevented by the wily Americans
who kept punching at the Japanese peri-
meter of defense. Shipping losses from
submarine and air attacks were slowly
severing the ties between the homeland
and the vital Southern Resources Area.
The fall of the Marianas left only the
Philippine-Formoso-Ryukyu island screen
to protect the thin trickle of commerce
still possible. If any of the three island
groups forming this protective screen
were to be lost, even this trickle of com-
merce would be cut off. Without the raw
materials supplied by the Southern Re-
sources Area the Japanese war effort
would collapse. To the Japanese military
and naval commanders it was obvious
that these islands, which protected the
homeland, must be defended no matter
what the cost.
Optimistic Japanese leaders called their
defense plans Sho (to conquer) Opera-
tions. The pitiful shortage of fuel and
'he lack of carrier aircraft made this title
a mere mockery. Any defense of the is-
land screen could be little more than a
desperate attempt to slow the American
advance. In desperation, Japan gathered
her fleet to meet the next American thrust.

ROBERT PAUL
Admiral Halsey did not keep them
waiting very long. On the 12th of Sep-
tember, Halsey took his Third Fleet to the
waters of the Central Philippines for a
three day aerial barrage. American pilots
shot down 173 planes, destroyed 305 on
the ground, and sank 59 ships. The
Third Fleet lost 8 planes.
Halsey was surprised to find the Philip-
pines so poorly defended. With his
characteristic aggressiveness, he quickly
advised Admiral Nimitz that he thought
it would be wise to advance the date of
invasion of the Philippines from Novem-
ber 15 to October 20. Roosevelt and
Churchill, in conference at Quebec, gave
the final authority for Nimitz and Mac-
Arthur to invade Leyte Island on Octo-
ber 20.
But Halsey had other jobs to do before
the Philippine invasion. The Third Fleet
continued marauding across the Pacific
finally striking Formosa early in October.
In the Operations at Formosa Halsey's
fliers shot down 685 planes and destroyed
540 on the ground. The severe aircraft
losses at Formosa, and earlier in the
Philippines, did much to hinder the op-
erations of the Japanese Fleet. In the
words of an official Navy publication,
"The importance of Japan's losses in land-
based planes to our carrier forces in
September and early October is difficult to
over-estimate and their cumulative im-
pact on enemy striking power was de-
cisive."
After battering Formosa, Halsey took
his Third Fleet to Ulithi for refueling
and a rest before covering the invasion of
Leyte. Nimitz's memorandum of Septem-
ber 20 gave Halsey his next job. "The
Third Fleet will cover and support the
occupation of Leyte by destroying enemy
naval and air forces in or threatening
the Philippines area." This meant that
effectively, Halsey was given a free hand
in what he wished to do, and Halsey was
then afloat.
The Setting for the Battle
Look now at the map. There is Leyte
in the very center of the Philippine Archi-
pelago. Entrance to the Gulf is possible
through two deep water channels: San
Bernardino Strait to the north of Samar
and Surigao Strait at the southern tip of
Leyte. To protect the beachhead on
Leyte these two entrances must be block-
ed. If the Jap Fleet got through these
channels and into the gulf it could raise
havoc with the transports and supply ships
which had brought MacArthur's army
back to the Philippines.
Within the gulf itself, MacArthur had
under his direct command Admiral Kin-
caid's Seventh Fleet. Kincaid planned
to use the battleships and cruisers of his
fleet to block Surigao Strait, the southern
approach. To the north, off the island of
Samar, were eighteen escort crusiers. Any
Japanese force coming through San Ber-
nardino Strait would meet these carriers
before reaching the transports and sup-
ply ships unloading onto the beaches of
Leyte. On the day of the invasion, Hal-
sey's Third fleet was cruising off Samar
looking for trouble from any direction.
This, in very simple terms, was the dis-
position of the American naval forces.
Japan's Sho Operation for the defense
of the Philippines was launched as soon
as it became obvious that an American
invasion was on its way. The Japanese
too, knew their geography; and so they
split their defending fleet into three ele-
ments. A central force under the com-
mand of Admiral Kurita was to sneak

More Power for B-47
The Boeing XB-47 Stratojet, holder of
the all-type transcontinental record at an
average speed of 607 miles per hour, is
now equipped with even more powerful
jet engines.

turbojets in one of two experimental
XB-47's will service test the new, higher

jets a total power potential of more than
48,000 pounds of thrust, when using six
J-47 turbojets and assisted take-off rockets.
Top speed of the Stratojet is placed by
the Air Force "in the 600 miles-per-hour
class." Its gross weight is 125,000
pounds, and it can carry a normal bomb
load of more than 20,000 pounds.
Designed and built by General Elec-
tric's Aircraft Gas Turbine Divisions at
Lynn, Mass., the new engines are also
being mass produced at the company's
new turbojet plant at Lockland, near Cin-
cinnati, Ohio.

Increasing the Power of a B-47
Use of the new G-E J-47's increases
total power of the Stratojet more than 25
per cent. Each of the new engines has a
basic thrust rating of 5200 pounds, com-
pared with 4000 pounds of earlier J-35
turbojets. The J-47, described as the
most powerful jet engine in production in
this country, is an extended development
of the J-35 and has approximately the
same general dimensions and shape.
Higher performance has been achieved
with little external change or weight in-
crease. The new engines will give Strato-
Strip Tester
A device which works like a harmonica,
vibrating metal strips in a path of rush-
ing air, is now being used to test the
strength of metals in the General Electric
Company's Schenectady Works Labora-
tory.
Called the "pneumatic strip tester," the
device vibrates metal in strip or sheet
form at its natural frequency, until the
specimen fails. The number of vibrations
needed to cause failure indicates the
metal's strength.
In order to set up vibrations in metal
strips, G-E engineers used the principle
of the harmonica. A "mouth organ" pro-
duces its tones when metal strips of dif-
ferent natural frequencies are made to
vibrate by air blown through the instru-
ment, when it is .played. In the pneu-
matic tester, compressed air vibrates the
test strip.
While the test is in progress, the strip
intercepts a beam of light once during
each vibration. Since the light beam is
focused on a photoelectric cell, or "elec-
tric eye," the vibrations can be counted
electronically, and the exact frequency, or
number of vibrations per second, can be
found.
When a test strip begins to crack, it
ceases to vibrate as fast, and the testing
device automatically stops. Engineers
then multiply, the frequency at which the
test was run, by the time needed to cause
failure, to find the number of vibrations
the metal strip could stand before it
cracked.
Because of the high frequencies which
can be produced on the pneumatic strip
tester—tests are often run at 1000 vibra-
tions per second—metal strips can be
vibrated enough times in 24 hours to
equal two or three weeks' testing on
mechanically operated devices.
The Latest Yarn
We imagine even Madame de Farge,
the grim and determined knitter in Dick-
ens' Tale of Two Cities, knew the value
of holding her yarn "just right." Even
in her day, it wasn't considered "good
form" to draw yarn out too tightly.
Knowledge of yarn tension is important
not only to fireside knitters, but to the
operators of spinning mills. Now, a new
device, the G-E "yarn tensionmeter," will
enable mill operators to get accurate meas-
urements of yarn tension on spinning
frames during actual operation. Armed
with such data, mills should be able to
improve their spinning operations.
In principle, the tensiometer is quite
simple. An armature strip is attached to
a shaft and flanked by two coils, forming
a balanced circuit. As the yarn passes
through the yarn guides atop the shaft,
any variation in tension causes the arma-
ture strip to bend, pulling the armature

BY
RICHARD A. HUMES, '51EE

It has been well said that "one picture
is worth a thousand words", and our
newspapers and magazines would be dull
indeed without illustration. But it must
be recognized that much technical "know-
how" plus years of research is responsible
for these pictures that we take so much
for granted.
Printing, as such, dates from the first
use of movable wooden type by Guten-
berg, in 1446, but this work was ante-
dated some forty or fifty years by the use
of type cut into blocks of wood. Along
with this came the use of illustrations,
likewise cut into a wooden block. These
"wood-cuts" were done by the intaglio
"cut-in" method, where the block was
heavily inked, then wiped on the surface,
leaving ink in the grooves. The next, and
natural, step was to use a metal plate,
and acid etch the desired design in in-
taglio, or relief, by painting some acid
resist on the plate, and then simply
scratching the design through the resist,
and etching. This was more satisfactory
than the wood forms, but the accuracy of
reproduction was largely dependent on
the combined personal interpretation of
the artist, who drew on the printing sur-
face, and the engraver who cut them.
Thus the need was keenly felt for both
a more accurate method, and a cheaper
and faster one.
RICHARD A. HUMES
After much research and experiment, a
Frenchman, Joseph Nicephore Niepce,
discovered the process which is the heart
of photo-engraving. This process, in
brief, consists of coating a plate with an
acid-resisting, light-sensitive compound.
Then, after making a "photo" on the
plate, the portion of the resist which has
been shielded by the dark parts of the
"negative" is washed away, and exposed
surface is acid-etched. This process, as is,
is obviously very crude, and the results
are nearly devoid of any shading or tone.
The demand for illustrations with the
same realistic tone as a photograph led
to the development of the screen process,
by Fox Talbot, an English physicist. This
consisted of exposing the sensitized plate
with a screen of gauze between the plate
and negative. This was followed by the
development (by Louis and Knox Levy),
of the sensitized zinc plate and an im-
proved screen.
With this brief historical sketch be-
hind us, let us now look into the process
and methods by which photo-engravings
are produced.
Photo-engraving is the art of photo-
graphically printing an acid resist on a
metal plate and then etching the unpro-
tected parts. The etched parts become
lower than the protected parts, which re-
main in relief and become the printing
surface of the plate. The depth of the
low areas depends upon many conditions,
and varies to some extent, but they must
be deep enough so that when the plate
is pressed upon the paper, there will be no
possibility of the bottom of the etched
parts printing up.
There are but two kinds of photo-
engravings: line plates and half tones.
If the original is in the form of lines,
dots, or larger areas of distinct concen-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


BY
DR. CHARLES L. STEVENSON
If we go far enough back into the his-
tory of any special science, we find that it
overlaps the history of philosophy. In
mathematics and physics we have to go
back pretty far; in psychology not even a
century; but for every science we find
somewhere a period when it was a branch
of philosophy, and not an independent
discipline.
That is easily understood. A philoso-
pher, roughly speaking, is a man who
won't run the risk of specializing. In
other words he prefers the risk of not
specializing, for there is a risk either way.
But in the early stages of any inquiry the
latter risk is always less severe.
A physicist-philosopher of ancient
Greece, for instance, could not know how
to satisfy the wonder out of which his
still half-formulated question arose. For
all he could see, he might need a knowl-
edge of the gods, the physical world be-
ing intelligible only in the light of their
purposes. Or he might need a knowledge
of the arts, for the physical world might
be striving to realize the most beautiful
forms. Perhaps he had suspicions that
experiments would help him, as they had
helped Pythagoras in studying the counds
produced by a vibrating string. But even
there, he could easily have thought that
the experiments were no more than a
prod to pure reasoning, like drawings in
the sand for geometry; for he did not
have to measure his drawing, or even
make a careful one, to discover that the
side of a square is incommensurable with
its diagonal. So if he specialized, limit-
ing himself to just this sort of study of
that, he might miss what he was most in
need of. In his quandry about how to
proceed, he virtually had to be a philoso-
pher.
I have been speaking of a purpose
which philosophy once served. But what
of present-day philosophy; what can /'/
hope to do? Must it attempt to give birth
to still other special sciences, nurturing
them only until they become adults and
can shift for themselves? Or has it other
purposes—purposes which also have at-
tended it, perhaps, throughout its long
history, but which are now acquiring
greater importance?
To a limited extent its old birth-giv-
ing, nurturing tendency is still being real-
DR. CHARLES L STEVENSON
ized. Formal logic, for instance, has been
a part of philosophy for two thousand
years. The methods at its disposal, how-
ever, have proved to be similar to those
of mathematics; and logicians are now so
confident about how to proceed that they
are in a position to specialize. So within
a century or less it is quite possible that
logic will become a separate discipline.
My point is simply this: The questions
that have migrated to the special sciences
were philosophical only by accident. Their
philosophical stage involved a human
process of learning how to specialize. But
there are other questions which cannot
migrate, since they are philosophical by
necessity. There can be no such thing as
learning how to specialize in answering
them, the questions themselves being of a
nature that forbids it.
Those who emphasize the latter ques-
tions, to be sure, will not have time to
give detailed treatment to all other ques-
tions. So you may say, if you like, that
specialization is inevitable, its only al-
ternative being omniscience, and that
philosophers simply specialize on ques-
tions that are not specialized. Very well;
but they specialize (broad sense) on ques-
tions that are not specialized (narrow
sense). And it is only in the narrow
sense that my remarks are intended to
hold true.
Just what, then, do the peculiarly philo-
sophical questions amount to? When
philosophers attempt to explain this, they
usually make use of the term "integra-
tion." The main task of philosophy, they
say, is to integrate the special sciences
with each other and with the trustworthy
aspects of common sense, and perhaps,
more generally, to integrate all such
knowledge with our practical aims and
our aesthetic sensibilities. This task pre-
sents problems, they add, that have an
unusual status. They are not distinguish-
ed from other problems in the way that
those of physics, for instance, are dis-
tinguished from those of anthropology.
They are on a different classificatory
plane: they relate their subject-matter
horizontally, whereas the special sciences
relate it vertically. So they cannot be
delegated to any existing special science,
nor can they become a new special science
that takes its place beside the old ones.
Newton is sometimes said to have "in-
tegrated' 'knowledge within physics: he
showed that seemingly diverse phenom-
ena, like the falling of an apple (never
mind about the authenticity of the story)
and the motion of the planets, could be
explained with reference to the same
general law. Now consider a man who
is attempting this on a much broader
scale, trying to relate, by comprehensive,
empirically established laws, not only the
phenomena of some one science but the
phenomena of a number of sciences—of
physics, chemistry, biology, and psychol-
ogy, for instance. Would the integration
he is seeking be the same as that of the
philosophers?
I think not. Philosophers often specu-
late about this possibility; and should
anyone succeed in establishing the laws in
question, they would doubtless join in
applauding his work. But if they are any-
thing like the men I have met in the
American Philosophical Association, they
would applaud as spectators. The de-
tailed work would have to be done by
someone else—by a man successively
trained in physics, chemistry, biology, and
psychology. He would do well to read
over the history of philosophy in his lei-
sure time; but I am afraid he would find
that his leisure time was short.
So if we conceive of a philosopher as
a non-specialist, attempting to integrate
knowledge, we must not forget that our
conception is rough, and subject to a

fessional engineer, it is necessary to pass
a series of three examinations.
The first examination is of a general
nature, and tests the applicant's knowl-
edge of basic engineering subjects. The
second examination deals with legal as-
pects of engineering ethics (conduct, re-
lationships, etc.), and engineering speci-
fications. Finally, after a specified mini-
mum time spent as a practicing engineer,
the applicant is eligible to take the pro-
fessional examination, which is based on
the individual's actual experience as an
engineer.
The Michigan Technic hopes that
the printing of one of the Part I exam-
inations recently given will prove to be of
aid, academically and morally, to engin-
eering students. The printing of Part II
and Part III for public dissemination is
forbidden. The following is a reproduc-
tion of one of the latest general examin-
ation given in Michigan.

EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
THE ROLE OF FACULTY EVALUATION
At a recent CIO convention a
Mr. Blank stated that students
ought to have the privilege to
strike for their rights. This is
just a little far fetched, how-
ever there seems to be a bar-
rier between the student and the
instructor. There are notable ex-
ceptions. These instructors have
found their classes so crowded
that in some departments a cloak
and dagger secrecy shrouds the
hours that certain instructors
teach their subjects. Granted
that perfection is seemingly im-
possible to attain, but something
can and must be done about the
situation. A case in point might
well be the instructor who said,
'No one in my class need ex-
pect an A because I do not be-
lieve college students are capable
of doing that grade of work."
This man has admitted failure!
He has admitted that he is not
qualified to lead the student's
thoughts into the proper chan-
nels conductive to advanced
thinking.
Although the Faculty Evaluation
Program carried out by Tau
BBeta Pi last year was ridiculed
by some, feared by others, and
abused by a few, is one of the
most forward steps in bringing
the student closer to the in-
structor.
The main objection to the stu-
dents' grading of the instructors
was that the students would let
their emotions over a bad blue-
book or a frustrated 'might be-
fore' be the guide to a good or
bad criticism. Happily this was
not the case. True the malcon-
tents had their day but their criti-
cisms could be recognized in-
stantly.
After talking with a represen-
tative number of professors and
instructors to gather their re-
actions to the Faculty Grading
Program, I found that they had
varying emotions. One professor
who strenuously opposed the
Faculty Grading Program at the
time it was carried out, admitted
that he had gotten a much fresher
view of students' likes and dis-
likes than he had ever had. This
man has been teaching on a col-
lege level for the last fifteen
years. Several of the professors
admitted that they were in a rut
but didn't know how to get out
of it. At first this seemed to be
quite a lethargic view, as per-
haps it is, but you as a student
try to put yourself in the position
of one who has a job to perform
and having tried several different
methods to get the best results,
find one that seems to work bet-
ter than the others. You repeat
this method over and over until
it becomes second nature. You
get what you feel is a good view
of students likes, dislikes and
what performances to expect
from them. Then when some-
thing like this Faculty Grading
Program comes along that threat-
ens your view which have ac-
cumulated over years of teach-
ing, naturally it's only human
nature to resist it. The faults
that have been repeated ten or
fifteen years no longer seem like
faults. This points to the cry-
ing need for this Grading Pro-
gram.
This Faculty Grading Program
is not something to be drug out
of the desk every four or five
years and glanced at it, but it
should be carried out at least
once a year. This will give refer-
ence points to check progress. If
the same faults are pointed out
time and again with out changes,
necessary steps can and should
be taken to insure better instruc-
tion, by changes in personnel if
necessary. On the brighter side,
some of the excellent instructors
can and should be rewarded for
consistently good performances.
This would not turn into a race
between instructors to see which
could curry the most favor of the
students.
What can you as an individual
student do about this? Simply
write a postcard or a letter to
the MICHIGAN TECHNIC so we
can express your opinions. For
your own good, for the good of
your kid brother or sister who
may attend school here, and for
the good of Michigan, let us
keep the Faculty Grading Pro-
gram.

have been well established and the tech-
nical achievements of the engineering
graduate of today surpass those of his
predecessors. However, the engineer is
not completely satisfied with the manner
in which the fruits of endeavor are being
used. He has become increasingly aware
that society is not keeping pace with the
continuous advancements in technology.
He is well aware that more logic has gone
into the design of a microphone than has
ever passed through it during normal use.
He has seen the principles of engineering
applied to machines that are capable of
destroying mankind—yet the human race
cannot develop a cure for a common head
cold. He sees his well-designed machines
that are capable of producing useful
goods standing idle while labor and man-
agement argue over terms of employment.
He has learned to solve the problems of
science and engineering with great ac-
curacies, but the human equation remains
unsolved. The world today is in a greater
need of a mental reconstruction than a
physical reconstruction.

Our deepest sympathies go to the 15
gallant Spartans who had such mighty
plans to wall off a portion of the U or M
campus just before the MSC-M game last
September. As we see it, nothing but the
ill-timed paint brush act earlier in the eve-
ning loused up their plans.
Seems to us, some sort of suitable
award is in order—a citation at the very
least. Had their carefully laid plan suc-
ceeded, it would have gone down in his-
tory as a clever climax to a long-standing
rivalry.
Of course it's only a wild idea, but
maybe next year one of our more capable
C. E. majors could rig us something simi-
lar for his senior problem.

The young engineer can develop lead-
ership if he aims toward developing tech-
niques in handling the people who will
be forevermore crossing his path. The
odd part of the whole story of leadership
is that the most natural thing for a person
to do is to perform in his own way. Un-
less the leadership characteristics of per-
sons are stimulated, the natural turn of
events will cause a search for leadership
in someone else—anyone who has what
appears to be the logical solution. He,
who may have been a leader, has turned
follower. Another type of citizen who
eventually becomes a follower is the per-
son who does his work, perhaps most
conscientiously, but who refuses to recog-
nize the importance of outside interests.
It is evident that outside interests aid in
more fully "rounding-out" the life of any
person. Very often we meet people who
add to life nothing beyond the perform-
ance of the duties of their work. It is to
these people that the influence of external
psychological forces should be applied.
Although proficiency in wielding the in-
fluence is important, it is necessary to ar-
rive at conclusions on which may be based
further study. With the recognition of in-
dividual elements, human values in engi-
neering are becoming increasingly im-
portant.

During your course you are acquiring
the basis of making a good living. Few
of you will be rich, but with very few ex-
ceptions you will all be able to live com-
fortably, by any reasonable standards; for
example, you will be able to have your
children go to college as you have gone.
I think you need not regret that on the
average you will merely earn a comfort-
able living instead of an affluent one. Ex-
pressed in today's terms, yours will be a
one-car family, but I venture to say that,
in comparison with many of the rich, it
will be a happy one. This will be so be-
cause, among other things, your life will
be lived with a sense of doing something
useful for the rest of the world.

Insurance statistics indicate that an
average American male, age 20 years, will
probably live to retire on his 65th birth-
day. Assuming graduation from college
by age 25, most of us have 40 years of
work after graduation.
Specialization for those 40 working
years takes place primarily in four college
years. And, improper specialization train-
ing can cause one to labor unsuccessfully
and unhappily for 40 long years.
Therefore, a proper course of study in
the University is more than superficially
important. Discovery of a mistake in
one's original choice of course should by
all means be corrected. Early curriculum
changes seldom penalize a student more
than a year of total college time—seldom
as much. Even one year is a good invest-
ment to insure 39 happy future years.
But as curriculum changes are delayed,
greater time and monetary investments are
required to correct the initial mistakes.
Thus, it is important to determine early
in one's college career which curriculum
is most likely to train one for 40 years of
enjoyable work.

An engineering education is, of neces-
sity, a period of intensive study. There-
fore, the results depend on the individual.
It is important that the student takes a
serious interest in his work from the start.
A half-hearted attempt only -wastes the
time of the student and his instructors.
In a university, many extracurricular ac-
tivities are offered to the students. It is
equally important to engage in a few of
these activities to make the most of your
college stay. The rewards are many. In
addition to performing a useful service to
the school community, the active student
lives a happier and better rounded college
life.

A man is measured by the mark he
makes, whether it is the shadow that falls
from his person or the character of the
signature that depicts his individual na-
ture. We at school are being educated in
scientific approach, but greater, we are
educating ourselves to the way of life
which will shape a destiny not only for
ourselves, but also for the generations that
follow in our professional dealings. A
life is measured not by its length, but by
its fullness. Enter into the spirit, learn
to make your mark, but make it a strong
substantial one. Treat all associates with
respect. Their convictions may be better
founded than your own.

MARRY NOT AN ENGINEER
Verily, I say unto you, marry not an
engineer for the engineer is a strange be-
ing, possessed of many devils; year he
speaketh eternally in paiables which he
calleth "formulas," and he hath but one
Bible—a hand book.
He talketh always of stresses and strains
and without end of thermodynamics. He
showeth always a serious aspect and seem-
eth not to know how to smile: and he
picketh his seat in the car by the springs
therein and not by the damsel by his
side; neither does he know a waterfall
save for it's power nor the sun except for
her absorption spectrum.
Always he carrieth his slide rule with
him and he entertaineth his maiden with
steam tables. Verily, though his damsel
expecteth chocolates when he calleth he
brings samples of iron.
THE SUBSTITUTE
Yea, he holdeth his damsel's hand, but
only to measure the heat content thereof,
and kisses her only to test the viscosity.
In his eyes shineth a faraway look which
is neither love nor longing, but a vain
attempt to recall a formula.
There is but one key to his heart, and
that is a Tau Beta Pi key; and one love
letter for which he yearneth and that an
"A" and when his damsel he writeth of
love and signeth with crosses, take not
these symbols for kisses but rather for
unknown quantities.
Even as a youth, he pulleth a girls hair
to test its elasticity, but as a man he dis-
covereth different devices; for he would
count the vibrations of her heartstrings
and reckon her strength of materials; for
he seeketh ever to pursue scientific investi-
gations, and inscribeth his passion in a
formula; and his marriage is an equation
involving two unknown and yielding
diverse answers.
And then there was the widow who
told the bachelor: "Take it from me—
don't get married."
"We are now passing the most famous
brewery in Berlin," explained the guide.
"We are not," replied the visiting
American contractor as he hopped off the

Do YOU REMEMBER when winter meant storing the family
car till spring? Not so many years ago, a car owner's fear
of an ice-shattered motor was a dread reality ... if he didn't
drain his radiator and store his car once cold weather hit!
What was needed—acutely—was an automobile anti-freeze
that would prove always dependable yet economical. One
that would hold up under any operating temperature. That
wouldn't foam and boil away. That would resist rust and
corrosion to the nth degree.
That's where Union Carbide research entered the picture.
The result? "Prestone" anti-freeze. Since then this product
—the first all-winter anti-freeze—has assured millions upon
millions of motorists of ever-improved driving performance,
with assured safety . . . throughout the bitterest weather.
This is but one example of the way the people of Union
Carbide are helping to better our daily living. And UCC
stands ready to help solve other problems . . . wherever
better materials and processes are needed.

through San Bernardino Strait at night
and arrive at the mouth of Leyte Gulf at
dawn on October 25. A southern force,
split into two smaller groups under Ad-

through Surigao Strait to the south and
arrive in the gulf at the same time as the
(Continued from page 7)
The Action of Kurita's Central Force
Kurita left Brunei Harbor for Borneo
on the morning of October 22. His cen-
tral force fleet consisted of five battle-
ships, ten heavy cruisers, two light cruis-
ers and fifteen destroyers. This armada
was to advance along the west side of
The Scene of the Battle
central force. And finally a northern
decoy force, under Admiral Ozawa, was
to approach from Cape Engano, at the
northern tip of Luzon.
This was the cast of characters for the
most dramatic play in modern naval his-
tory.
Palawan Island, turn eastward and circle
to the south of Mindoro and then arrive
at the east entrance of San Bernardino
Strait at sundown on the 24th of October.
Two American submarines, the Darter
and the Dace, found Kurita's force on
the morning of the 23rd as it was pass-
ing through Palawan Passage. In twenty-
three minutes the two submarines had
sunk the heavy cruisers Atago and Maya
and so badly damaged the heavy cruiser
Takao that she had to be escorted back
to Brunei by two destroyers. Unfortun-
ately the Darter went aground while pur-
suing the damaged Japanese cruiser. By
that evening Halsey and Kincaid were
aware of the existence of only this one
of the three Japanese forces.
With this information about the move-
ments of the Japanese, Halsey acted
quickly. The three Task Groups remain-
ing with the Third Fleet made high speed
runs toward the Philippine coast; and
McCain's Task Group 38.1, which had
been sent to Utithi to rearm, was ordered
to put about and join the fight. At dawn
on the 24th search planes from the three
carrier groups were sent to find Kurita's
force. Soon after the planes left, Halsey
received the dispatch, "Four battleships,
eight cruisers, thirteen destroyers off the
southern tip of Mindoro Island, course
050, speed 10 to 12 knots . . ."
At 0750 on the 24th Japanese air-
craft based on Luzon attacked Sherman's
Task Group 38.3. The incessant attacks
did little damage until a lone Jap bomber
sneaked in to unload his cargo on the
deck of the light carrier Princeton, A
fire was started on the hanger deck of the
ship, and by later afternoon it became im-
possible to save her.
In the meantime American carrier
planes were taking a grim toll of Kurita's
fleet. Without the protection of aircraft,
Kurita was badly handicapped. The
cruiser Myoko was damaged in an early
attack and she had to be sent back to
Brunei Harbor without an accompanying
destroyer. The battleship Musashi was
damaged severely in a late morning at-
tack. At four o'clock in the afternoon,
Kurita had had enough. He decided "to
withdraw westward temporarily to await
results of the attack by friendly forces."
American fliers chased Kurita westward.
They would give him no peace until they
had sunk the giant Musasbi. Admiral
Toyoda, at fleet headquarters in Tokyo,
was angered to hear that Kurita had
turned around and he penned a short dis-
patch to Kurita, "With confidence in
Heavenly guidance the entire force will
attack!" Kurita again put about and
headed for San Bernardino Strait. How-
ever, this particular phase of the action

tive helplessness of a capital ship, when
control of the air is so uncertain.
Halsey's Devision
Aboard Halsey's flagship the reports
of damage were slightly overestimated:
"At least 4 and probably 5 BB tor-
pedoed and bombed; one probably
sunk; a minimum of C heavy cruisers
torpedoed and others bombed; 1 CL
sunk; 1 DD sunk; 1 probably sung and
4damaged—flash reports indicated be-
yond doubt that the center force had
been badly mauled with all of its BB
and most of its CA tremendously re-
duced in fighting power and life."
Other events on the 24th had made it
necessary for Halsey to make a decision
on the basis of the report of the damage
to the central force which has just been
quoted. Both the southern and northern
forces had been discovered and it be-
came necessary for Halsey to decide
whether he should steam northward to
meet the Japanese carriers coming from
that direction or stay to protect the ap-
proach the San Bernardino Strait. On the
basis of the damage reports he had in
his possession, Halsey decided to steam
northward. He did not know that he was
falling into a Japanese trap. It began to
look as though the Japanese Sho Opera-
tion had some chance for success.
Oldendorf Crosses the "T"
On the night of the 24th as Halsey was
steaming northward to attack the Jap
carriers, the Japanese southern force was
attempting to force its way through Suri-
gao Strait. Admiral Nishimura was under
orders to break through to the anchorage
at Leyte Gulf at dawn on October 25.
For some unknown reason, he arrived at
the entrance to Surigao Strait a full hour
and one half ahead of schedule. At the
head of the strait waited Admiral Olden-
dorf with his force of six battleships.
American destroyers first made contact
with the Japanese force at 0300. Torpedo
attacks launched by the destroyers dis-
rupted Nichimura's battle-line, but he
kept lumbering up the strait right into
the full fury of all the guns aboard the
American battleships. Oldendorf had suc-
ceeded in the text-book tactic of crossing
the "T".
By 0400 the Japanese battleships Yama-
shiro and Fuso had been sunk, the cruiser
Mogami badly damaged. Admiral Shima,
who had followed 40 miles behind Nishi-
mura, brought his small cruiser force into
the action. One of his cruisers, the Nachi,
slammed into the damaged Mogami at
about 1420. Here was a supreme example
of divided command. If the Japanese
southern force had been under a single
command they might have been able to
afffford a more effffective diversion for
Kurita's force, which was to enter the
northern end of the gulf. At it was, Shima
took his force into Surigao Strait and
then out again. He suffered severe dam-
age to the light cruiser Abukuma and did
nothing to aid Nishimura's stricken ships.
The southern force had failed completely
in its attempt to force its way into Leyte
Gulf. At 1500 on October 25 the Leyte
beachhead was still safe. Admiral Kin-
caid's Seventh Fleet was doing its job
well.
On board Kincaid's flagship there was
restrained jubilation. The crushing of
the Japanese southern force had sheared
off one prong of the pincers the Japanese
admirals had prepared for the ships in
Leyte Gulf. Kincaid also had reason to
believe that the entrance to San Bernar-
dino Strait was adequately defended. His
radio operators had intercepted a message
which Halsey had sent to the Third Fleet
organizing a Task Force 34. This task
force was to form if a surface action de-
veloped. In this order Halsey had not
separated the battleships in Task Force 34
from the main body of the fleet, he had
merely set up the organization so that the
task force could separate itself when ord-
ered to do so. Kincaid took this dispatch
to mean that Task Force 34 was protect-
ing the northern entrance to Leyte Gulf.
At 0412, to be sure of no mistake, Kin-
caid sent a dispatch to Halsey asking, "Is
TF 34 guarding San Bernardino Strait?"
Kincaid was soon to learn that only the
eighteen escort carriers and their accom-
panying destroyers and destroyer escorts
were between the Japanese central force
and the transports in the gulf. History
perhaps will never know why Kincaid
misunderstood Halsey in the light of
the very excellent communications system
existing. But this he did, and only great
good fortune prevented this slip from
being the indirect cause of the American
Fleet's near destruction. This luck,
coupled with the uncertainty of the Jap-
anese reconnaisance, made the action
against Admiral Kurita very successful
from the U. S. view point.
Tinclads Versus Titans
By the time Admiral Kurita had taken
his force through San Bernardino Strait
he already knew of the destruction of the
Southern force. At 0650, on the 25th of
October, Kurita sighted the American es-
cort carriers which he reported as "a
gigantic enemy task force including six or
seven carriers accompanied by many cruis-
ers and destroyers." When Kurita had
narrowed the range to 35,000 yards he
was able to open fire on the unarmored
escort carriers with the 18.1 inch guns of
the Yamato. The battle between the
giant sluggers of the Jap fleet and the
midget escort carriers of the American
fleet had begun.
In Kurita's fleet there were still four
battleships, six heavy cruisers, two light
cruisers and eleven destroyers. Hidden
behind the rapidly moving rain squalls
were the six American escort carriers of
the northern group with three destroyers
and four destroyer escorts to protect them.
Further down the coast of Samar were
two similar groups of American escort
carriers with the same kind of meager pro-
tection. The die were heavily loaded in
favor of the Japanese.
The cruisers in Kurita's fleet were sent
ahead to crowd the American ships
against the island of Samar and prevent
their escape to the south. By 0750 the
Jap fleet was spread out over fifteen miles
of ocean in rapid pursuit of the fleeing
Americans. American destroyer torpe-
does had already crippled the cruiser
Kumano and she was fleeing westward ac-
companied by the cruiser Suzuya. Far to
the south-east the battleship Kongo was
leading the cruisers which were attempt-
ing to back the American ships up onto
the beach. The Japanese fleet was form-
ing a semi-circle around the northern
group of American carriers. Kurita was
not fully aware of the effectiveness of his
maneuvers because he had no aircraft to
do his scouting for him.
American Aircraft Kept Busy
During this time the American pilots
had not been idle. They were constantly
attacking Kurita's fleet, and together with
the destroyers they had caused the Jap-
anese to maneuver violently to avoid their
torpedoes and bombs. All this maneuver-
ing delayed Kurita considerable and
caused confusion that almost resulted in
a collision between the battleship Haruna
and the light cruiser Noshiro. Kurita
was holding the reins of his command a
little too loosely. Likewise, this incident
served again to point out the weakness of
the Japanese war machine in the respect
of newer technical devices. In this cate-
gory are included radar, a good wireless
communications setup.
(Continued on page 20)

By 0810 the battleships Yatnato and
Nagalo had successfully evaded torpedo
attacks and they were again in rapid pur-
suit of the fleeing American ships now
hidden behind a heavy screen of smoke.
In the half hour from 0800 to 0830 the
American ships were being badly hacked
by shells from Kurita's ships. But by
0842 the carriers had launched a new
wave of planes to strike back at the Jap-
anese. By 0900 the cruisers Chikuma and
Chokai, which had followed the battleship
Kongo in a close chase of the carriers,
were crippled. Twenty minutes later the
other cruisers in the advanced element of
the fleet were but 10,000 yards from the
American carriers. Kurita continued to
receive exaggerated reports of the dam-
age to the carriers. American destroyers
were taken for cruisers and the destroyer
escorts were reported as destroyers. The
Japanese admiral had also intercepted
American broadcasts that convinced him
that another American fleet was on the
way. At 0911 the order went out for all
units to assemble on a northerly course.
Kurita pulled out just when victory was
in his grasp.
The carriers and destroyers had fought
a valiant fight. They had saved the ships
inside the gulf. Despite the overwhelm-
ing odds their losses had been light.
Kurita's big guns had managed to sink
one escort carrier, two destroyers, and
one destroyer escort. Even without Task
Force 34 the beachhead had been pro-
tected.
Halsey Fights the Decoy
But what of Admiral Ozawa's mission
of sacrifice? Ozawa's job was to lure as
much of the American fleet away from
the Leyte area as possible. Throughout
the morning of the 24th Ozawa waited
for a report that the American fleet had
taken the bait. Finally at 1145, 76 planes
were sent to attack the carriers of the
Third Fleet. The planes were not to re-
turn to the carriers, but were to land off
the island of Luzon. With this attack
Ozawa stripped his carriers of all but 29
planes. Ozawa's command was now a
hollow fleet without any real means of
protection. This statement is made be-
cause, as mentioned before, and as reinter-
ated below, without control of the air, a
modern capital ship has little chance.
At dawn of the 25 th the battle in the
north began. Perhaps massacre is a better
(Continued from page 19)
word, because before the battle was finish-
ed all the Japanese carriers had been
sunk. The screening force too, was badly
mauled. Only the hybrid battleship-air-
craft carriers he and Nyuga, one light
cruiser, and one destroyer escaped de-
struction.
Throughout the morning Halsey had
received messages from Kincaid in Leyte
Gulf telling of the desperate plight of the
escort carriers struggling with the Japan-
ese main fleet off the island of Samar.
Most of these dispatches had been ar-
riving late and even at the time the first
one was received it was too late to send
ships of the Third Fleet back to Leyte.
At about 1045 Halsey received a message
from Nimitz, "The whole world wants to
know where is TF 34.'" This message so
infuriated Halsey that, although he was
only 40 miles away from the remnants of
the northern force, he took the six bat-
tleships of Task Force 34 and steamed at
full speed toward San Bernardino Strait.
Admiral Mitcher's pleas to Halsey, to
leave two battleships to finish off the he
and Hyuga, were ignored. Both of these
ships escaped. It was here that Halsey
made his mistake, or one of his greater
mistakes, whichever your opinion may
wish to choose.
In the race for San Bernardino Strait,
Halsey came out second best. Kurita got
his four remaining battleships and at-
tendent escorts through the treacherous
waters of the strait before Halsey arrived
at 0100 on the 25th of October. Halsey's
battleships then swung south to search
for stragglers. The other elements of the
Third Fleet also spent the 26th in search
of damaged Japanese warships in Philip-
pine waters. By nightfall the struggle for
control of Leyte Gulf was ended.
An Evaluation
In the execution of a plan the success
or failure is almost always dependent
upon the executors. So it was with the
Sho Operation for the defense of the
That Admiral Kurita understood the pur-
pose of the operation seems clear when
he has said, "It was then a limited ob-
jective, to delay that particular landing."
It then appears that Kurita knew that he
was to be a sacrificial lamb for the pro-
tection of the Japanese homeland, but
somehow he could not throw himself into
the fire with the abandon necessary for
success. Kurita fought a clumsy battle
off the coast of Samar. His final decision
to reform his forces on a northerly course,
when the chase of the American escort
was about to end with the carriers trapped
against the coast of Samar, was certainly
one of the costliest blunders of the entire
action. Nishimura's reasons for arriving
at the entrance to Leyte Gulf an hour and
one half early must remain a mystery,
since Nishimura is not alive to defend
himself. But when Kurita learned that
Nishimura was disregarding the carefully
balanced timing of the operation it was
up to him to order Nishimura to slow
down and obey his original orders. Kurita
never discharged that responsibility.
Shima was a non-entity in the action. He
took his fleet into Surigao Strait, and he
managed to get most of it out again;
and that was all he did. Again we see a
possible lack of reliable devices for com-
munication in just such a circumstance.
Neither was the American defense of
Leyte flawless. Certainly Halsey's turn
away from San Bernardino Strait to chase
Ozawa's well disciplined decoy is an ac-
tion that may be questioned. To Halsey's
defense has sprung Fletcher Pratt:
"Halsey's action in turning from
the Sibuyan Sea force (the key point
of the battle and the one that will
be debated as long as Jellicoe's turn-
away at Jutland) was fully justified
. . . Whether he was so justified in
taking all the fast battleships with
him on the run south is another
question."
Other Pacific war correspondents have
taken the opposite view. Gilbert Cant felt
that, "In short he accepted the bait, fall-
ing in completely with the Japanese
strategy." Such arguments as this will
continue for years to come, but as Walter
Karig has said, "In spite of differences of
opinion as to what the best course of ac-
tion would have been, the fact remains
that action had been taken and the Battle
for Leyte Gulf had been won.'"
It is difficult to draw any conclusions
from a study of this action. Halsey was
lauded in the majority of circles, because
he won. Had he lost, he would without
doubt have been the "goat" of the war.
Thus it is senseless to say that HaJsey won
the battle due to superior generalship, or
to say that he won in spite of his mis-
takes. The correct answer will never be
known, only a variety of opinions, so let
us be glad that the battle was won.

lar to await the coming of spring—but
fishing paraphernalia is another thing.
Somehow it doesn't get "put away" quite
as readily. Although you probably use
your fly tackle only when the snow is
gone and the weather's warm, we'll bet
you nurse it through the winter with an
occasional rub down and oiling.
So, if you have your tackle out on the
hobby bench and will be sorting your
wet and dry flies during the long winter
evenings, you may be interested in G.E.'s
new fly-box, produced for the Charles F.

Metal Skin Best
In extensive tests at the Company's new
High Voltage Engineering Laboratory,
scientists have found that airplanes with
all-metal "skins" are practically immune
to lightning strokes. Lightning strokes
contacting the metal skin will not pene-
trate the interior. Damage would be con-
fined principally to the places hit by the
stroke and would consist of small holes
burned in the metal skin.
Non-metallic planes are found to be less
safe—subject to damage from even minor
strokes of about 20,000 amperes crest.
The reason for this is that strokes must
penetrate the non-metallic skin before
reaching engines and control wires within
these planes. The explosive force of the
stroke tends to disrupt violently the non-
metallic skin.
Bump Recorder
Impact-O-Graph is a small-size, self-
contained recording device that tells the
kind, intensity, and time of bumps or
jolts given to goods in transit.
The unit is packed into the crate or
carton with the goods to be shipped. For
28 days, the recorder prints conditions of
handling in transit on a 60-ft roll of
specially treated paper. Three recording
needles, for horizontal, vertical, and long-
itudinal shocks, do the printing as the
paper moves at an inch an hour. If the
shipping crate containing the recorder is
dropped vertically for several feet the
vertical needle will register a high inten-
sity of shock. A small bump on top of
the crate will register a slight intensity.

Straight From the Heart
A small but powerful weapon has en-
tered the fight against the nation's Num-
ber One killer, heart disease.
It is the new G-E Cardioscribe, an in-
strument which can "put the finger" on
many abnormal heart conditions with a
direct, on-the-spot tracing of the heart's
action. With it, there is no film to expose
or develop. A complete record of the
heart's beat is made on a waxed paper
tape with a heated element.
Entirely self-contained in a wood cabi-
net, the 38-pound Cardioscribe can easily
be moved from room to room in a hospi-
tal, or shifted with little effort for the
observation of special cases where drugs
are being administered.
Principal value of this new instrument
is that, without delay, it reveals minute
deviations from the pattern characteristic
of the normal heart, thus enabling the
physician to nip heart diseases in the bud
by spotting them in their early stages.
Portable Drafting Board
A lightweight structural material de-
veloped during the war is turning up as a
drafting board. The material, called
honeycomb laminate, has a core of paper
glued in honeycomb fashion; outer layers
are plywood. It has both high strength
and stiffness. And, because it's light, it
makes a drafting board that is easy to
handle and tote around. The board is
bonded with waterproof glue, sealed with
a waterproofing agent that prevents warp-
ing. A straight-edged gear rack that fits
along each side eliminates the conven-
tional T-square.
New Air Restorer
Grandmother used to have a sachet

was calculated to give her favorite hand-
kerchiefs a whiff of outdoor freshness.
A strictly modern "sachet," an electric-
powered deodorizer, has recently been de-
veloped by the Y and Y Deodorizer Com-
pany of Philadelphia. It is believed to be
IN THE NEWS
(Continued from page 21)
the first electric-powered deodorizer em-
ploying the dry-cake method. Its design
was worked out with the G-E Ft. Wayne
plant whose fractional-horsepower motor
is used to power the device.
The new deodorizer, only seven inches
high and four and one-half inches in
diameter, is designed to "scent condi-
tion" lavatories, theaters, railway coaches,
restaurants, offices, department stores,
and other places where folks congregate—
even at home.
Noiseless and light-weight, the device
can be mounted on almost any wall or
ceiling.
Bounce Kills Jounce
Bouncing putty, now widely used in
golf balls and in devices which automati-
cally level furniture, has been put to work
in a new job. This time it's protecting
the delicate instruments of V-2 rockets
fired at White Sands.
Wrapped in a half-inch coating of
bouncing putty, motion picture cameras
hardly mind the crash of the huge rocket
after their hundred-mile plunge back to
earth.
This silicone "putty" flows like ordi-
nary soft glazing putty. Rolled in a ball,
however, it has a lively bounce. It's so
bouncy, in fact, that in several instances
putty-wrapped instruments have survived
to tell their stories when V-2's have come
apart 50 miles up, on the return trip to
earth, upon entrance into the uper-thin
air of the stratosphere.
Point with No Solvent
Each year in the U. S., some $5.5-bil-
lion is lost through corrosion of struc-
tural steelwork and building surfaces.
This loss includes outlays for rather in-
effective efforts to control the corrosion.
To help beat this waste problem, An-
tros, A. B., Swedish manufacturer of paint
and painting equipment, is now setting
up a licensing agreement in the U. S.
to market a painting technique said to
have three times the life of existing pro-
tective painting methods. Ontros' process,
called Antropahl, combines an anticorro-
sive paint and a radical method of appli-
cation to form a protective coating that
has been tested under conditions equal
to 15 years' wear.
Bonds With Surface—The system uses
a paint made of resins, oils, and waxes
but contains no solvents. When cold, the
mixture forms a waxy mass. The paint
is first melted in a spray gun by a he
Then it's sprayed through flame ont
surface. The mixture bonds with
metal or material to form a hard

Surface pores that develop in ord
paints as solvents evaporate don't h
chance to form in the Antropahl pro
And, unlike other systems, it can be
plied with the same results in any clii
ate or season. On damp or wet surfaces.
Antropahl's flame dries the receiving sur-
face as the mixture is applied. If the
paint becomes chipped or damaged, the
rust that forms on the bared metal can't
expand and extend under the rest of the
protected surface.
Antropahl has already been tested on
ships in northern waters. It has replaced
the initial coating (usually red lead),
the anticorrosive coating, and the anti-
fouling layer ordinarily used in marine
painting.
Inaudible Sounds
In experiments with a new device which
generates sound inaudible to human ears,
scientists have scrambled eggs, homogen-
ized milk, shattered glass tubes, and mix-
ed paint. With it, they might even be
able to call your dog.
This new device, called the "ultrasonic
generator," has been developed at General
Electric for work in determining practical
application for ultrasonics. It looks much
like a small floor-model radio, topped by
an oil-filled transparent cylinder, and it
can produce sound waves with frequencies
ranging up to one million impulses per
second.
Heart of the generator is a quartz crys-
tal, roughly the size and shape of a
hockey puck, which is mounted in the
oil-filled cylinder. The high-frequency
waves are produced when an •electric volt-
age is applied across the crystal.
Surgical Radio Receiver
A tiny radio receiver which can be
placed beneath a dog's skin surgically has
been developed for use by medical sci-
entists in nerve stimulation experiments.
Dr. James M. Lafferty of the General
Electric Research Laboratory developed
the device for Dr. John J. Farrell of Al-
bany Medical College, Albany, N. Y.
Minute insulated wires run from the re-
ceiver, about the size of a ping-pong ball,
to whatever nerve is being stimulated. The
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Skin of Dogs
receiver picks up the radio impulses which are transmitted
to the nerve.
The surgery involved is performed while the dog is anes-
thetized, and the experiments are painless. The incision soon
heals, leaving the dog normal in every respect, save for having
a radio receiver under his coat.
Most nerve stimulation experiments in the past have neces-
sitated electrical connections running through incisions in the
dog's skin and into the nerve. Dr. Lafferty's apparatus trans-
mits the stimuli by radio waves, making connections unneces-
sary. For experiments, the dog is placed in a large cage, which
is connected to a radio transmitter. When a nerve is to be
stimulated, a signal is sent from the cage to the receiver.
The unique radio application is said to make possible the
study of nerve reactions to stimuli with the laboratory animal
in a normal physiological state. Other stimulation experiments
have necessarily been performed with the dog under anesthetic,
with the nerve laid bare, or with electrical leads running
through the skin. In every case, the dog has been in an ab-
normal state, which would have an effect on the scientists'
findings.
The receiver is spherical, inclosed in a plastic substance
which is not irritating. The wire running to the nerve is also
inclosed in plastic, and is connected to the nerve by a small
silver foil electrode, which fits sleeve-fashion around a section
of the nerve. The nerve tissue does not seem to be harmed.
Dr. Farrell broadcasts to his dogs on a 1000 kilocycle fre-
quency, which is in the commercial broadcast band, but his
signals are kept within the laboratory by means of special
shields.

Tone subjects such as photographs and

"halftone dots", which are mechanically

duced by photographing the original
through a mesh or grating called a "half-
tone screen." Each dot, when photo-
graphically printed on the metal and pro-
tected by the resist, stands in relief when
the surrounding metal is etched. This
produces the effect of tones when the
plate is inked and printed on paper,
because these halftone dots are small
enough in most instances to be beyond
the resolving power of the eye, and offer
a quite satisfactory substitute for the
grains which produced the tones in the

Your problem Is to work out a drive for the blade that
permits this three-way adjustment. How would you do It?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER — Use an S.S.White flexible shaft
to bring power from the counter-shaft or motor to the blade.
There is no simpler mechanical means than a flexible shaft
for driving parts which must be adjustable. And simplicity
in design means economy in production.

graphic plate. This is in the form of a reverse or nega-
tive picture of the copy. The negative film is then stripped off
the glass and turned over on another glass, so that it becomes
a positive of the copy. The piece of metal to be used is then
coated with a light-sensitive, acid resistant material, and ex-
posed to a light source through the positive of the copy, and in
the case of halftone reproduction, through a screen between
the positive and the metal plate. This renders a positive im-
pression on the plate, which is then washed to remove unex-
posed resist, and etched. The etching is now in the form of a
negative, which will then print as a positive of the original.
At this stage the etched plate, or "cut" is in a very rough
form, having an irregular low area and usually incomplete
definition at the edges of outlines and in shaded areas. The
excess low metal is first cut away by means of a process
called "routing", in which the metal in all low spots is cut
away very close to the outline edges by either hand tool or
machine in one process. The objection to doing this by etch-
ing lies in the fact that the acid has a tendency to undercut the
raised areas if the etching is too deep, making several shallow
operations necessary in order to obtain the necessary depth by
the action of the acid alone. The detail finishing is done by
hand etching, and requires a highly skilled craftsman to ac-
quire the necessary definition of outline and tone.
After this, the remaining steps are the relatively mechanical
ones of finishing the edges so the cut will be square, and
mounting the cut on a wooden block so that it can be read
locked in a type form.
To give you a better idea of what a "screen" consists
picture it as a perfect glass plate, highly polished on one side,
and inscribed with a grid of lines, in which the area of the
"holes" in the screen is equal to the area of the solid portion
at the intersection of two lines. The screens vary in size from
55 lines per inch, used for coarse paper such as newsprint, to
400 lines per inch, which is only used on the finest smooth-
coated paper. The screens are also revolved, in relation to the
copy, at a 45 degree angle, to avoid the optical illusion of lines
which occurs if the screen has its mesh set up horizontal and
vertical to the copy.
Color Printing
Multi-color illustrations are usually done by the "four-color"
process, using the three primary colors of Red, Yellow, and
Blue, and the addition of a black shaded plate. In theory, the
combination of the three primary colors should produce black,
but in practice this frequently comes out grey or dark brown,
thus making it more convenient in the long run to use a separ-
ate black plate. Color printing is thus accomplished by print-
ing each color separately, the second being printed over the
first, and so forth. With four cuts to be made, and four
printing operations to go through, it may readily be seen
that this is an expensive process, thus accounting for its com-
parative rarity.
This has not been intended as a guide to photo-engraving,
but rather as an attempt to give the reader an idea of one
phase of the work which goes into making a magazine, news-
paper, or book. The additional ramifications of these processes,
such as lithoprinting, electrotyping, and such, are merely cost-
saving variations on this process, and would be deserving of
further research by the interested reader.

A fluid catalytic cracker is the realiza-
tion of the plans and the work of many
men. It costs many millions of dollars
—but it owes its efficiency to catalyst
studies that begin in beakers that cost
only thirty cents each.
The "cat" and the beaker symbolize
the enormous range of our research
work, which draws on nearly every
phase of chemistry, physics and engi-
neering in its effort to make petroleum
products more useful. And every new
fact we discover about oil opens up
new avenues of inquiry, new possibili-
ties, new jobs.
Many scientists, technical men and
engineers work for Standard Oil. We
choose them carefully, provide them
with the finest equipment, and try to
create an intellectual climate that will
stimulate their best work.
From their beakers and pilot plants
comes the impetus that keeps Standard
Oil in the forefront of industrial re-
search, that provides thousands of bet-
ter products so that millions of people
can enjoy better living.

highly important exception. A customary
philosopher, who cannot, like Aristotle,
master all the knowledge of his age, must
be at pains to keep his aspirations within
sight of his abilities. If he should seek to
formulate comprehensive law of nature—
which require a study that is both "verti-
cal" and "horizontal," being intimately
dependent on the details of each science
—he would have no time for his other
objectives, and would be attempting
something for which his tradition affords
him an inadequate preparation. He must
hope, then, that the comprehensive laws
will grow out of the special sciences them-
selves, with the assistance of some future
universal genius.
There are no less than three other
ways, however, in which philosophers do
attempt to achieve an integration. The
first of these is called "metaphysical," and
it is so hard to explain that I must be
content to use an analogy:
Compare the sum total of our knowl-
edge with a cast map. Certain parts of it,
representing the accessible regions, can be
checked by a survey; and these corre-
spond to the scope of the special sciences,
as well as to the laws, previously men-
tioned that they have in common. But
when they are drawn in, the map seems
incomplete and although the other lines
that are needed cannot be checked by a
survey, they can at least be sketched in,
free hand, in a way that makes them join
the others together. These latter lines
correspond to the scope of metaphysics.
Such an integration was attempted,
for instance, by Immanuel Kant. By
recognizing certain entities which were
not open to scientific investigation, and
which in the nature of the case never
could be, he hoped to explain why mathe-
matics, developed without experiment, is
nevertheless applicable to experimental
inquiry; and he hoped, in the same peta-
physical framework, to find a place for
moral principles, and for the "postulates"
of God and immortality.
Another sort of integration to which
philosophers aspire, and an all-pervasive
one, takes the form of cultivating a bal-
anced scheme of values—a sense of pro-
portion in judging what is worth having
and worth doing. At the present time,
when a division of labor requires most
men to know much about one subject and
little about all the others, a correct per-
spective on evaluative questions is hard
to maintain: an economist will tend to
(Continued from page 11)
magnify our economic needs, a general
our need of preparing for war, an artist
our aesthetic needs, and so on. The in-
fallible remedy for this, as usual, is om-
niscience. But perhaps philosophy,
though written and taught by those who,
at times, seem more than usually human
in their frailties, can provide a partial
remedy. It can at least, surveying the
scene, contrast one scheme of values with
another, hoping, negatively, to let the
pancreas cancel one another out, and
positively, to reveal aims that lie beyond
the horizon of any specialized field.
The last way in which philosophy at-
tempts to integrate—or rather, the last I
shall have space to discuss—is one that
proceeds by a careful analysis of concepts
and methods. Since integration is a men-
tal putting-together and analysis a men-
tal taking-apart, the attempt seems self-
contradictory. But in fact one can often
put together because he takes apart; and
the reason is simply this: So much of the
difficulty in relating the parts of our
knowledge is one of our own creation.
We first raise a dust, as Berkeley put it,
and then complain that we cannot see.
So if, by analysis, and hence by a care-
ful separation of problems, we can obtain
a deafer vision, we may presume that we
shall also obtain a more comprehensive
one.
Many have asked, for instance, whether
an acceptance of contemporary science is
compatible with a belief in God. One can
best answer this question with another:
"Which conception of God do you have
in mind?" For there are many concep-
tions of God—from an old man with a
white beard to an intangible force—and
hence many senses of that word. How
can one answer "a" question when it
is really a multitude of questions, im-
perfectly distinguished?
It may be (and since I must here dog-
matic, I need to call the word "may"
to my rescue) that an attentive analysis
of our conception, when we speak of
God, will show that religion is closer to
poetry than to science. And it may show
that the seeming opposition between sci-
ence, on the one hand, and poetry or re-
ligion, on the other, arises from a hope-
less confusion. Having learned from sci-
ence what events in the world we must
expect, we get the curious idea that we
have nothing else to do but expect them.
But our constant need, which poetry and
religion help to satisfy, is one of de-
veloping an emotional orientation to what
we must expect—an orientation that can
bring with it the richness of wonder and
humility.
There are innumerable concepts that
virtually cry out for philosophical analy-
sis; tut we may not see this at first,
simply because we inherit our concepts
with out language, and permit their
familiarity to deceive us into supposing
that they are clear. As a further example
take the old issue about determinism and
freedom:
Psychology and the social sciences us-
ually make the deterministic assumption
that every event has a cause. But that
seems to have a curious result; since every
human action or choice, if caused, "could
not have been otherwise" (in some
sense), it seems absurd ever to blame a
man. To blame would be to protest
against the inevitable. So for common-
sense morality we seem to need a doc-
trine of "free will" that repudiates de-
terminism.
It is a familiar contention of con-
temporary philosophy, however, and one
that has its origins in the traditional writ-
ings of Spinoza, Hobbes, and Hume, that
both determinism and free will hold true
—that for some voluntary action, that is
to say, both may hold true at once and
completely. You may object, saying that
the views are logically incompatible. But
how can you be sure that they are in-
compatible until you ask yourself precisely
what your concept of freedom amounts
to? Once you have analyzed it (and here
again I am forced to dogmatize) you may
very well find that you had in mind a
number of concepts all fused together:
and, you may discover that the only "free-
dom" your common sense ever needed or
cherished is one that, so far from being
opposed to determination, is really a
special kind of determinism.
Such, in brief, are the ways in which
philosophy can hope to interrelate the
various parts of our knowledge, and to
connect our knowledge with our aims and
sensibilities. At the present time the last
way that I have mentioned—the integra-
tion that depends on analysis—has been
attended by highly encouraging results.
But I do think that it is entirely a matter
of emphasis. All three sorts of integra-
tion—metaphysical, evaluative, and ana-
lytical—are essential to philosophy, and
are likely to be among its aims in the
future, as they have been in the past.

How to help a coal loader
throw its weight around!
The constant pushing, swinging, scooping action
of a mechanical coal loader places heavy shock
loads on the bearings. To carry these tough loads,
engineers for leading mining equipment manufac-
turers specify Timken® tapered roller bearings.
Why TIIWKEN bearings can
take the tough loads
Due to their tapered design, Timken bearings take
radial and thrust loads in any combination. Made of
Timken fine alloy steel, rolls and races are case-
carburized to give a hard, wear-resistant surface
with a tough inner core to withstand shock. Because
the load is carried on a line of contact between rolls
and races, instead of being concentrated at a single
point, stress is minimized.

Extreme accuracy of measurement, required in modern manufacture, is now demon-
strated on equipment in the Metal Processing Department. This picture of the joint Army and
University of Michigan Measuring and Gaging Laboratory shows the most accurate measuring
machines available today. The Pratt and Whitney machine at the rear registers to ten
millionths of an inch, and the Vinco optical dividing head at the right measures angles to
one second of arc.
This equipment is demonstrated to students studying machine tools, and used by, those in
the course, Measuring, Gaging and Inspection. This is one of seventeen graduate courses
devoted to the study of principles and practice of metal processing and manufacture. Spec-
ialization is possible in applied metallurgy, welding, and design and use of manufacturing
equipment.

is a trapezoid, top width 3 feet, base
width 21 feet, up-stream face having
a batter of 1 horizontal to 5 vertical.
The height of the dam is 30 feet. If
the water level upstream from the
dam is at the top of the dam and
there is no water downstream from
the dam, and the specific gravity of
the material in the dam is 2, where
does the resultant of the water pres-

tersect the base of the dam, if there
is no upward water pressure on the
base of the dam.
27. The inside diameter of a hollow
shaft is .9 of the outside diameter.
What should be the ratio of the
diameters of a solid and a hollow
shaft if they are equally strong in
torque? Which shaft would twist
the more per unit length?
28. A spring is required to support a
pipe which when hot moves down 1"
from the cold position. Design the
spring so that when the pipe is cold
the spring will carry a load of 1,000
pounds, and when the pipe is hot
the spring will carry approximately

opening is covered by a gate of ap-
proximately the same size, which is
hinged at the top. A horizontal
chain is attached to the bottom of
the gate for purpose of opening the
gate. In the compartment on the
same side of the wall to which the
gate is hinged, the water stands at a

gate, and 5 ft. lower in the other
compartment. Find the force in the
chain to open the gate.
The following questions were selected
from other examinations for engineering
candidates given in previous years.

at the rate of 3000 (X) i/2 dollars per
year where x=number of years from
date of purchase, what is the long-
est period the man can hold thre
property without losing money on
it? At what time should he sell the
property to realize the greatest profit
and what would be that profit? Give
answer to the nearest year.

be increased by pumping it from
atmospheric pressure to 100 lbs. per
sq. inch? Assume temperature to re-
main constant.

cient of friction, either static or kin-
etic, between the cylinder and the
plane is .2, will the cylinder roll,
slide, or roll and slip? Why? How
far will it go in ten seconds from
rest? Neglect Rolling Resistance.

THERE are enough miles of oil and nat-
ural gas pipe lines in the U. S. A. to
circle the world at the equator 16 times!
This vast, 402.000-mile network is
made up of crude oil lines, oil products
pipe lines and natural gas lines. This
network has helped to make the benefits
of gasoline, fuel oil and oil products
readily available to everybody ... it has
helped to bring gas heating to many
parts of the country.
But this constantly-expanding under-
ground network is far from complete.
It will require thousands more miles of
pipe in the near future. To help meet
this demand, United States Steel will
put two more large-diameter pipe mills
into operation in the next few months.
The steel industry is a growing indus-
try, not only in terms of physical plants
and facilities, but in terms of personnel,
too. At the present time, the number of
United States Steel employees partici-
pating in educational programs is ex-
ceeded in size only by the student bodies
of a few of our largest universities.
The fundamental objectives of these
programs are to assure employees maxi-
mum opportunity for personal develop-
ment and to provide them with a sound
foundation for advancement within the
organization.
The training programs in United
States Steel have become the "pipe line"
to successful careers for hundreds of
capable young men.

That's right, for today, chemistry plays an indispensable

recognized the nutritional importance of amino acids,
the building block of proteins. Several of these amino
acids are essential to the diet, for without them man and

of these essential amino acids.
Dow's continuing research, along with that of other
investigators, has proved that critical deficiencies of
Methionine can be corrected by supplementing chicken
feed with this amino acid, produced synthetically. Chickens
fed fortified diets grew ten per cent faster and consumed
less feed for every pound gained. Such new developments
make it possible for poultry raisers to market better

Introduction
Much has been said and written about
concrete ships; some of the statements
made are based on experience, but un-
fortunately some are not even fully based
on facts. An attempt will be made in
this paper to discuss the merits and de-
fects of concrete vessels.
History
Reinforced concrete is not a new build-
ing material; it has been in land use for
many years. In marine work it was used
to a very limited extent. From the his-
torical point of view, it is interesting to
mention that small concrete craft were
built even before steel shipbuilding was
the general practice. However, it was
only a few years before the first World
War that serious attempts were made to
build concrete vessels on a large scale.
The attempts were mainly concentrated
in the U.S.A., England, and to a lesser
extent in Norway.
In this country the first serious attempt
to build concrete ships was made by a San
Francisco firm in 1918. The first ship
(named "FAITH") had the following
particulars:
320'-0"
44'-6"
30'-0"
6'-0"
8150 tons
0.835
1700 I.H.P.
10 Knots
L.B.P.
Breadth
Depth
Freeboard

Speed
The ship was designed for deadweight
of 5000 tons, but as will be explained
later, she finally had a deadweight ca-
pacity of 4185-4500 tons. A word of
praise should be said in favor of the
builders and enterprisers for their cour-
age to build a concrete ship which at
that time was the largest afloat. The
"FAITH" proved to be satisfactory as far
as strength and seaworthiness is concern-
ed, and she was the first concrete ship to
cross the Atlantic Ocean.
The largest concrete tonnage in this
country was built by the United States
Shipping Board in 1918. The Board was
confronted with a shortage of steel for
steel shipbuilding and as a result it in-
vestigated the possibilities of building
About the Author:
Jacob Recanati is a serior in the school
of Naval Architecture, and will receive
his BS (NA) in August of this year.
His previous experience in this field
consists of employment in a ship yard in
Newcastle, England before he entered
the U. of M.
Mr. Recanati became interested in the
subject of concrete ships through contact
with several articles written on the sub-
ject during both World Wars.
After graduation, he has tentative
plans of employment in the ship repair
line.

terdeck Society.
concrete ships. A special "Concrete Ship
Section" was formed; this committee was
staffed by concrete engineers and other
experts of related fields who made exten-
sive laboratory experiments. They came to
the conclusion that it was advisable to
use concrete for shipbuilding, and at the
beginning of 1918 a program to build
about half a million tons deadweight of
concrete ships was started. The standard
"United States Shipping Board" ship had
the following particulars:
L.B.P. 268'-0"
Breadth 46'-0"
Depth 28'-3"
Draft 23'-6"
Weight of Hull (without
equipment) 2500 tons
Deadweight 3203 tons
Dwt/Displacement ratio .520
Besides the above standard ship, stand-
ard tankers of the dimensions 420* x 54'
x 36' and deadweight of 6380 tons were
built. Due to the lack of experience they
were not produced as fast as anticipated
and when the armistice came, it brought
this emergency ship-building problem to
a sudden termination, leaving only about
ten ships actually completed. These ships,
in service, did not show any notable weak-
ness and behaved satisfactorily. Besides
the above-mentioned vessels built for the
United States Shipping Board, a number
of oil barges were built for service in
New York harbor. The capacity of these
barges was 400-1200 tons deadweight.
The barges gave satisfactory service, but
had the disadvantage that they were sub-
ject to minor damage caused by bumping
against wharves and other barges.
Because these ships gave satisfactory
service the U. S. Shipping Board under-
took the construction of concrete ships
on a regular basis. The British Govern-
ment also launched an extensive program
of concrete shipbuilding. The vessels
were mainly coasters of the following
dimensions:
L.B.P.
Breadth
Depth
Dwt.
205'
32'
19'-6"
1150 tons
Here too, the vessels were sound and no
major structural defects were reported.
However, the program was discontinued
for reasons which will become clear later
when discussing the economical aspects
of concrete ships. In Norway, also,
a certain number of concrete ships
were built, mainly by private enterprises.
The vessels were smaller than those built
in the U.S.A. and England. In Norway,
besides sea-going ships and barges, other
types of vessels, such as tugs, light-ships,
floating docks, etc. were built.
The three above-mentioned countries
are the main ones where concrete ships
were built to an extent worth mention-
ing. There are other countries in Europe
where a limited number of concrete ships
were also built; mainly Denmark, Ger-
many, France, Holland and Italy. In most
of these cases the reason for using con-
crete was the shortage of steel caused by
war-time conditions; but it should be
borne in mind that there are many of
these countries which do not produce steel
at all, so that adoption of concrete ship-
building could solve a very important
problem, and can have great influence on
the economy of a country. Thus, concrete
ships can be built in many parts of the
world where steel shipbulding is imprac-
tical.
At the beginning of the Nineteen-
twenties, a severe slump hit the ship-
building industry in general. The infant
concrete shipbuilding industry suffered
because of this and was not given a chance
to develop.

concrete ship construction between the
two wars. In 1942, similar conditions to
those in World War I prevailed in the
shipbuilding industry, and for the same
reasons some concrete vessels were built.
In this country some unpropelled barges,
floating warehouses, and other special
purpose craft were built on the West
Coast, and the Maritime Commission
ordered 24 ships, each about 360 ft. long
with a dead-weight capacity of 50,000 Ibs.
In England, too, a certain number of
barges, having a new design were built.
Unlike the common method of rein-
forcing concrete by means of steel rods,
perforated transverse steel joists were
used through which steel rods making an
angle of 45 degrees with the deck were
passed. The steel joists are of the same
width as the thickness of the shell, so
that the molds for pouring the concrete
could be fastened efficiently to the joists.
This avoids the enlargement of the walls
which happened frequently in previous
cases. The steel joists act as shock ab-
sorbers and so no timber shock absorb-
ers were required. The deadweight esti-
mates of these barges were very accurate
and two thirds of the steel was saved in
the construction of the ships, as compared
to previous methods.
In Germany also, a certain number of
concrete vessels were built. Among others
it included some 3000 tons deadweight
tankers, 3700 tons deadweight motorships,
barges and lighters.
The vessels built in World War II are
not basically different from those built
during and immediately after the First
War. Some of the builders learned from
the First War experience and as a result
better and quicker methods of construc-
tion were used so that the time for build-
ing a ship was considerably reduced.
Barges were even mass-produced with no
structural defects reported. Methods of
launching were also improved, and build-
ers experienced less difficulties than those
met in the First World War.
Concrete is strong in compression, but
has almost a negligible tensile strength. By
embedding steel rods in concrete the
structure can take a tensile load also.
Thus, reinforced concrete can be a suit-
able material for shipbuilding provided it
satisfies other requirements which are of
equal importance to strength. One of the
advantages which concrete has is that it
resists corrosion so well that no margin
for corrosion has to be allowed. This
factor is of great importance and can
partially offset some of the drawbacks

concrete ships have. Concrete has a longer
life than steel so that the yearly depre-
ciation of 5%, as used in the case of steel
ships can be reduced considerably. Ex-
perience proved that even if small cracks
develop in the concrete hull, they are of
minor importance, and the embedded
steel rods are still fully protected from
corrosion. Obviously, in the case of larger
cracks, water will find access to the steel
and corrosion will take place. The water-
tight characteristics of the concrete are of
major importance to the naval architect.
Water tightness can be secured either by
adding a water-proofing compound to the
concrete during mixing or treatment of
the finished surface with a suitable non-
porous material. The first method, it is
believed, reduces the strength of the con-
crete. It was found that there is a certain
leakage when the vessel is first subjected
to the pressure of the water, but this grad-
ually disappears. It is worth mentioning
that the concrete is oiltight also, and has
a great advantage of resisting the de-
teriorating effect of mineral oil. After the
first concrete ships entered service, it was
noticed that vibrations due to machinery
were less than in steel ships; but, even if
such vibrations exist it was found that the
strength of the structure is hardly affected.
There is no standard practice in the mix-
ture of concrete used in shipbuilding; the
variations depend on the location and
builders. A mixture used in England
consists of the following:
Cement 1 Volume
Sand iy&amp; Volume
Coarse Material iy2 Volume
The direct allowable compressive stress
for concrete is 700-750 psi. and the al-
lowable shear stress is 73 psi. As for the
tensile strength of concrete, text books
and regulations agree in placing it at
zero for practical purposes. The modulus
elasticity of steel is taken as 30,000,000
psi.; the modulus elasticity of concrete
appears to vary with the richness of the
mixture, and it is about 2,400,000 psi.
Further the modulus of elasticity of con-
crete is not constant for the same speci-
men at different stresses. However, cer-
tain authorities are convinced that con-
crete is elastic and follows Hooke's Law
to the point of fracture. Thus, to produce
the same strain in the concrete and the
steel, the ratio of the stresses in the ma-
terials should be the same as their modu-
lus of elasticity:
Sc Es 30,000,000
Sc EC 2-»3,000,000
Thus taking a mean value of 12.5 the
maximum compressive stress in the steel
should not exceed a value of about 9,000
psi., a value which is lower than that used
in steel shipbuilding. Further, if it is as-
sumed that the concrete does not take any
or only negligible tension, concrete ship-
building will be an impractical proposition

W. W. HAGERTY
Associate Professor of Engineering Mechanics
The purpose of this paper is to describe
a method of sealing a rotating shaft
against leakage caused by an axial pres-
sure gradient. The sealing element was
developed by applying principles of fluid
mechanics to the problem. The result
was a hydraulic seal which seals by
hydraulic means. The essential features
of this method of sealing will be describ-
ed, but the mechanical details, which are
a part of the problem, will not be treated
in a complete manner.
In the first part of this paper the gen-
eral theory of the fluid motion encount-
ered will be presented. In the second
part, the manner in which the theory is
applied to the problem will be demon-
strated and some general examples of
seal design will be given.
Review of Theory of Fluid Motion in
an Annulus
It is known that there are three modes
of viscous fluid motion which can exist
within an annulus which has the inner
wall rotating and the outer wall station-
ary. The modes are:
1. Couette motion, a purely viscous,
laminar flow which exists at low
rotational speeds.
2. Taylor vortex motion, a stable form
of motion which exists at interme-
diate speeds.
3. Turbulent motion, a highly irregu-
lar motion which exists at high
speeds.
In the first of these modes, when the
annulus has infinite axial length, the paths
of all moving particles are simply circles
concentric with the axis of rotation.
When the annulus is of finite axial length,
a rotary motion exists in the corners,
but the central portion of the fluid moves
with Couette motion. In the third mode,
that of turbulent motion, there is no
regular pattern of any kind. Neither of
these modes has any known application
to the sealing problem.
In the Taylor vortex motion, the fluid
within the annulus divides itself into pairs
of vortex rings in which particles of
fluid rotate simultaneously both about the
axis of the shaft and the core of the vor-
tex.
If the outer wall of the annulus is also

free to rotate, there are variations in the
modes of motion, but these will not be
considered here, except to state that it is
undesirable for sealing purposes to have
the outer wall rotating.
Probably the first theoretical work per-
taining to the solution of this problem was
that of Rayleigh, who developed a cri-
terion for the stability of an inviscid fluid
in an annulus of infinite length in 1916
while investigating the dynamics of
cyclones and anti-cyclones. Briefly stated,
Rayleigh found that:
When the product of the local
fluid velocity, v, and the radial dis-
tance to the axis of the annulus, r,
is a constant throughout the fluid,
i.e., it = constant, the pressure
gradient of the fluid is in equilibrium
with the centrifugal force.
When the product, vr, decreases as
r increases, the motion is unstable;
and
When the product, vr, increases
with increasing r, the motion is sure
to be stable.
Therefore, from Rayleigh's criterion, in
the case where the inner wall of the an-
nulus is rotating and the outer wall is
stationary, the motion of an inviscid fluid
is always unstable.
In a viscous fluid, small disturbances are
damped out for certain values of the dis-
turbance. In 1922, G. I. Taylor developed
a criterion which shows the effect of vis-
cosity on such disturbed motion in an
annulus of infinite length. The results
of Taylor's work are the following:
1. He developed a formula which pre-
dicts the initial speed at which the
fluid motion is unstable. For the case
where the thickness of annulus, a,

is small compared to the radius of
the outer cylinder, R, and where
only the inner cylinder is rotating,
the angular velocity, &lt;«, is given
by Taylor as
. t / X
'" _ *~v y 0.057l&lt;r*R
where v is the kinematic viscosity.
2. Assuming a periodic disturbance,
Taylor found that the wave length
of this disturbance is equal to 2j
at the onset of instability.
3. Taylor plotted the streamlines of the
disturbed mode of motion and
found them to be symmetrical ring
vortices of square cross-section. All
of the vortices were found to rotate
about the axis of the annulus, and
at the same time the vortices rotated
about their individual cores as
though geared together. This means
that adjacent vortices rotated in
opposite directions with respect to
their cores.
Experimental Apparatus
Since in practice, all annuli are of finite
length, an experimental apparatus was
devised at the University of Michigan
with the object of determining the extent
to which Taylor's criterion is valid for
annuli of finite length, and to determine
the effect of fixed end plates on the size,
formation and stability of the vortex sys-
tems that are to be formed in the annu-
lus.
In this machine the inner cylin-
der is driven by an infinitely var-
iable speed drive with good control from
12 to 400 rpm. The outer fixed cylinder
of the annulus isa Lucite tube. A Plexi-
glas box surrounds the tube and is filled
with water to minimize optical distortion.
The bottom plane ring of the annulus is
fixed while the top ring can be adjusted.
Lighting was provided by a beam of
parallel light which was directed through
a slit as shown in Fig. 1. A two-dimen-
sional effect was obtained and the lighted
area could then be viewed or photo-
graphed. The fluid motion was made

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


BY
JAMES P. ADAMS
Provost of the University of Michigan
There is probably no word in common
usage today which suggests to the lay
mind more of the tangible accomplish-
ments of our society than the word engi-
neering. It suggests a great host of
achievements which represent the material
fruits of the times in which we have been
living. Our mind's eye sees a great net-
work of highways, vast irrigation projects,
elaborate provisions for flood control,
huge bridges, immense power plants with
their transmission facilities, the mechani-
cal means of mass production, new ve-
hicles of transportation, novel agencies of
communication, and a great host of other
things, large and small. These things
remind us of the engineer, and they are
part of the evidence of an ever-enlarging
reliance upon the profession of engi-
neering for the translation of ideas into
the tangible things which our society
demands as a part of its program.
All of these developments have their
roots in the basic sciences of mathematics
and physics and chemistry and some
others, but it is the function of the engi-
neer to translate the data of science into
the language of workable things. It is his
job to give scientific truth practical appli-
cation in terms of things which men can
use. Given the properties of steel and
the established facts regarding mass and
pressure and stress, he must give these
things expression in the specifications of a
piece of steel which is capable of serving
as a structural member of a specific sus-
pension bridge. Given the known scien-
tific facts regarding combustion and ex-
pansion of gases, and transmission of
force, and the properties of materials in
use, he must give them application in
terms of an engine that will do the work
for which it is designed.
This is the essence of engineering, but
it is not all of it. The engineer is not
concerned alone with the phenomena of
physical science. He does not deal alone
with the principles involving the relation-
ships of physical force. He must also con-
cern himself with economic values. He
must search for the ways and means by

JAMES P. ADAMS
which he can accomplish the result he
seeks at a cost which makes it a feasible
choice among the alternatives to which
society can afford to devote its resources.
This confronts him with some of his most
difficult problems. It also provides him
one of his most compelling incentives.
Moreover, the engineer must also con-
cern himself with the problems of hu-
man nature. He may develop great
mechanisms of production, but at some
point he must take into account that they
are operated, or if not operated then con-
trolled, by men. I believe that it is an
axiom of engineering that, in the case
of any complex operation, simplicity in
control can be achieved only by elabora-
tion of mechanism and that simplicity in
mechanism requires elaboration of con-
trol. The engineer must find a nice bal-
ance between these factors, keeping in
mind the economic considerations of cost
and the capacities and frailities of human
beings.
Moreover, the engineer faces another
problem in many areas of his experience.
Despite the vast array of knowledge at
his disposal, he finds many points at
which he could easily utilize more. There
are many things regarding the properties
of matter and the nature of physical
forces which we do not yet know. They
may be commanding the research inter-
est and effort of physicists and chemists,
and in due course we may have the an-
swers. But the engineer cannot wait.
Face to face with a concrete purpose, he
must proceed and make the best of all
the knowledge at his command. His is
the job of getting something done by the
best means now available or by the best
means which his own initiative, imagina-
tion, and profession ingenuity can con-
trive.
All of these things then must be taken
into account in the shaping of our plans
and programs in engineering education.
The engineer must be not only a person
who knows but also a person who can do.
His equipment must include an under-
standing of the basic scientific facts which
are the raw-materials of his engineering
ideas. But it must also include an ability
to set up his problem in the face of an
objective and then select the factual tools
by which he gives it practical solution. In
so far as possible, he should be given op-
portunities to try his hand at this as a part
of his educational experience.
I need not point out that, in addition to
the distinctly professional aspects of engi-
neering education, the prospective engi-
neer should also include within his pro-
gram of study experiences which are
related to the nonprofessional aspects of
his life. As a member of a respected pro-
fession, he should be a responsible citizen
in the community, and, as an individual,
his interests will encompass areas of hu-
man experience which lie out beyond his
professional concerns. In building the
structure of his professional education, he
must see to it that it is substantial enough
to meet his professional needs, but he
should also attempt to landscape it with
some courses in other fields which will ex-
tend the boundaries of his intellectual and
spiritual domain.

Sensitive Brake Device
Automobile drivers will want to borrow
a new gadget developed by airplane
builders.
One of the biggest aircraft companies
has developed an airplane brake attach-
ment which automatically prevents wheel
skidding.
The device acts as a regulator on the
airplane's normal hydraulic brakes. Skid
detectors in the "hubs" of the landing
wheels consists of small flywheels in
which electrical contacts act to cut off,
by solenoid operated valves, the brake
pressure just short of a skid, and re-apply
it when a near-skid condition ends.
A valuable safety device, the anti-
skid mechanism also minimizes wear on
tires.
A New Answer to High Voltage
Transmission
Keep high-voltage current inside a
cable? . . . Keep Houdini in a strait
jacket! Somewhere about 5,000 volts, cur-
rent gets so potent it can ionize the air
around the cable. The corona of ionized
air cuts through rubber or plastic insula-
tion like a hot knife going through butter.
In a bare cnductor, the first sign of
trouble is a bluish haze—the "corona ef-
fect." The stronger this corona, the more
power is lost, dissipating into heat around
the cable.
Fortunately, electrical engineers have
a way to put a high-voltage current in an
insulated cable of moderate size and elim-
inate the corona effect. Between the con-
ductor and the insulation, they wind a
thin ribbon of non-magnetic metal. This
metal shielding grounds the surface dis-
charge that establishes the power-sapping
corona.
The only trouble with shielded cables is
that the shielding often has a tough time
coping with attack from the outside.
When corrosion or abrasion destroys
the shielding tape, the current goes for
the spot like water breaking through a
dike. Soon a corona is glowing merrily
at the spot where the shielding and insu-
lation have given out.
The short life of metal shielding has
been especially troublesome in submarine
and underground cables, and in indus-
tries like mining and petroleum refining.
Now, however, the makers of high-vol-
tage cable believe they have an answer
even to this problef. It is shielding tape
made of "326" Monel, a new alloy that
costs no more than conventional shielding
materials, but has far greater strength
and resistance to corrosion and wear. Sub-
stantially non-magnetic at room tempera-
ture, "326" Monel is more than twice as
strong as tinned copper. Thus, it can be
used in lighter gauges. Above all, "326"
Monel is so much more resistant to cor-
rosion than other shielding materials, that
it gives high-voltage cables greatly in-
creased life expectancy under harsh con-
ditions.
Marine Shaft Energy
How much energy a ship expends on a
given trip can be measured by a new elec-
tric instrument described by a General
Electric engineer.
Called a "marine shaft horsepower-
hour meter," the instrument is expected
to prove valuable in keeping a continuous
check on the performance of ships' power
plants, enabling operators to select the
most economical speeds for the plants,
and indicating when the ships should be
dry-docked because of drag caused by
fouled hulls.
The meter indicates both the power be-
ing transmitted to the propellers at any
instant, and the total energy expended
over a period of time. The energy meas-
urement is registered in terms of horse-
power-hours, and is said to be accurate to
within two per cent.
Heart of the device, developed by the
company's General Engineering and Con-
sulting Laboratory, is a small, self-
contained unit which is mounted on the
ship's propeller shaft. It measures the
speed of the shaft, and the amount of
twisting the shaft is subpected to. The
product of these two quantities, calcu-
lated automatically, gives the horsepower,
and, when multiplied by time, gives the
total energy, it was explained.
That part of the equipment which reg-
isters the information and contains the
instrument's controls can be mounted any-
where aboard ship, in the engine room, at
the engineer's desk, or on the bridge.
X Ray Spectrogoniometer
Scientists can now explore unknown
substances with X-rays, and determine in
a few minutes what elements the sub-
stance contain and how the atoms in
them are arranged, by means of a new.
automatic instrument announced here re-
cently.
Called an X-ray spectrogoniometer, the
instrument makes its analyses by means of
X-rays, an especially sensitive "Geiger
counter," and a system of gears machined
to the accuracy of those used to guide
major astronomical telescopes.
A Geiger counter is a type of tube, used
widely in the atomic energy field, which
gives minute electrical signals when cer-
tain rays—X-rays and cosmic rays-
strike it, scientists explained.
A sample to be analyzed is mounted in
the center of a large table. An X-ray
beam is passed through it, and the Geiger
counter moved by precision gears, ro-
tates around it slowly, measuring the in-
tensity of X-rays scattered by the sample
at every angle.
The manner in which a substance scat-
ters X-rays is governed by the type of
atoms it contains and the way in which
they are arranged with respect to each
other, it was explained.
Intensities of the X-rays and the an-
gles at which they are scattered are re-
corded automatically on a moving strip
of paper in the form of a graph. The
record is marked off in the degrees of a
circle through which the Geiger counter
moves, and the X-ray intensities are indi-
cated by the height of the line drawn hy
the recorder.
The principal method of making X-ray
analyses of structure in the past has in-

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


BY
PROFESSOR GLENN D. McGEOCH
Among the arts, Music is perhaps the
most widely enjoyed and the least under-
stood. Because it addresses itself for the
most part directly to the feelings through
a medium that is evasive and ephemeral,
revealing through its system of symbols
only patterns of sound that have no com-
monly accepted or conventional meanings
associated with them, music can mean all
things to all men. Knowing no bound-
aries of language, race, color, or creed, its
appeal is more universal than that of any
of the other arts. For these reasons it is
often referred to as the "universal lan-
guage", the "language of the emotions,"
the 'evoker of spiritual and universal
truths," or described poetically as the Art
that "leads us to the brink of the in-
finite," and that "sets us in immediate
touch with the universe." While all
of this might in a sense be true, such
airy panegyrics bring little satisfaction to
one who desires to know something more
definite about the nature of music and the
scope of its expression.
The major arts, Architecture, Sculpture,
Painting, Literature, and Music undoubt-
edly have many points in common. They
all manifest personal expressions, made
permanent through the use of some kind
of material or medium upon which an ar-
tist's creative imagination works, giving
to it a meaningful form and an artistic
value that can be communicated to others
and returned to at will: Basically all of
the arts raise creatively into the realm of
beauty the materials through which they
work.
Architecture, the most real and prac-
tical of the arts, uses a great variety of
tangible materials: wood, stone, steel,
glass, etc. Each presents its own aesthetic
as well as practical problem to the artist-
architect who is as concerned with the
ultimate beauty of his building as he is
with its functional construction. Archi-
tecture, unlike the other tangible arts,
achieves both its practical and artistic
purpose in forms not copied from nature,
but invented or created by the architect,
which he disposes under laws of gravity
and rules of balance. Having nothing in
the world of reality to refer to outside of
itself, we cannot speak about the "subject
matter" or "meaning" of architecture ex-

cept in architectural terms, therefore it is
considered to be a purely abstract Art.
Sculpture, like the other arts except
Architecture, need serve no utilitarian
end. It uses a single tangible medium, the
most usual being either bronze, stone,
gold, or marble, each presenting its own
artistic problem to be solved by the ar-
tist. But Sculpture, unlike Architecture,
does refer itself to the world of physical
reality where it finds a limited field of
models in human and animal forms.
Although its medium has been organized
non-representationally as in the modern
idiom, it does and always has throughout
its history invite representation and imi-
tation. All are of course must transcend
reality through the imagination of the ar-
tist, but the medium of sculpture lends
itself so effectively to the representation
of visible objects that the expressive po-
tentialities of the art cannot be said to
have been adequately exploited in pure
abstraction, i.e., when the artist deliberate-
ly separates the closely associated quali-
ties from the object. When a sculptor
does so, he loses recognizable form and
his art tends to become "unintelligible."
By removing the "subject matter" or
"meaning" he enters, with his abstract
forms, the expressive sphere of architec-
ture.
Painting, the last of the tangible arts,
uses as its medium pigment in a so-called
vehicle, usually of oil or water, and ap-
plied it to a flat surface. The painter's
artistic purpose is achieved through the
manipulation of line, color, and space
distribution, and although as a creative
artist these are his chief concern, he has
an unlimited sphere of subject matter to
draw from, for anything seen can be
painted. Even though mere imitation is
no more his aim than it is of the sculp-
tor, he refers constantly to the real world
with its physical objects for his models.
What has been said about abstraction in
sculpture is also true of painting. It too
incurs the dangers of "unintelligibility"
when it enters the realm of the abstract
and loses its identity as an object.
With Literature and Music we cross
the border-line into the intangible arts.
Literature uses as its medium words—
symbols in meaningful relation, that is to
say, language. For its subject matter it
uses the actions, ideas, motives, aspira-
tions, and conflicts found in human re-
lationships. From one point of view its
medium is more complex than that of
any of the other arts, for words them-
selves have an intricate nature. They can
have a sensuous, emotive quality like
sounds in music, but these sounds and
their symbols have ideas and concepts
associated with them. The relation of the
sensory symbol (the word) and the idea-
tional meaning is, of course, quite arbi-
trary, since meanings become attached to
words by convention. Word-symbols,
however, have had conventionally accept-
ed meanings long before they were used
as the medium of literature. Their sounds,
whether actually heard as in speech, or
mentally heard as in reading, immediately
evoke a whole world of definite and spe-
cific imagery. When we use them as a
means of daily communication, we do so
in a practical and informative way. The
literary artist, like the artist-architect,
sculptor, arid painter has a concern for his
medium for beyond this. By permeating
it with emotive meaning he raises it above
the level of everyday speech into the
realm of art expression.
Music, like literature, is an art of sound
also designated by symbols (lines, bars,

of Tau Beta Pi are required to submit a paper
as a prerequisite to their initiation. This paper
was awarded first prize in the fall semester
competition.
No problem exists more fundamental
than that of satisfying human needs. Yet
the basic solution is extremely simple. It
is education.
This is a problem which has gone
unsettled since the stone age. Since
then man has settled many disputes
with sword, gun, and atom bomb. But
the problem of the needs of the society of
man, and how to meet them, is still un-
settled. Perhaps it is beneficial to further
examine human needs.
The needs and desires of a society are
often mistaken for the desires of the in-
dividual members. Let us define social
needs as those whose fulfillment benefits
all individuals in substantially equal
amounts. Moreover, let us call personal,
or individual, needs those which benefit
individuals or groups as distinguished
from the entirety. Then among the social
needs of a group as large as the United
States, for example, are military services,
public education, birth control, police
forces, codes of laws, international pros-
perity, soil conservation, and forest re-
clamation. Yet were we to satisfy our
combined individual desires we would
dispense with our army and police
through non-payment of taxes, overwhelm
the world with our progeny, eat all our
food, and grow it as cheaply and waste-
fully as possible.
Thus when we speak of the needs of
society we have cause to consider carefully
whether we mean the needs of "society"
as a whole, or the combined individual
needs of various members.
In comparing communism to capitalism
the easy path would lead to the conclusion
that a communal organization would best
satisfy the needs of "society" as an en-
tirety while a capitalistic system would
serve better to fulfill combined individual
desires as distinguished from •community
needs. At first glance this seems logical.
Capitalism provides for individual incen-
tive, private property ownership, produc-
tion of what people want because of their
willingness to pay, and distribution of in-
come according to the value of the prod-
uct of the income-producing unit. Com-
THE NEEDS OF SOCIETY
BY
SELIG GERTZIS, "50EE
munism entails production of what is
socially most desired, control and use of
resources by decision rather than to sat-
isfy demand for goods. Its autocratic na-
ture provides military and police forces
readily. All the needs of the state are
achieved conveniently under communism.
Continuing the easy path of analysis,
one could say that if one set of needs is
to be chosen rather than another, those
desires could be met by properly changing
the economic (and political) system; by
"changing the rules of the game." Thus
for many years radicals, who believe in
social rather than individual needs, have
urged the change to a form of socialism in
the opinion that the change will be the
one and only method to obtain the de-
sired results.
But this line of thought is in error.
Who cares for social needs? The answer
is—individuals! When many individuals
concern themselves, the social needs be-
come individual desires as well. The ful-
fillment of those needs can be met by the
individual (or combination of individual)
efforts in a capitalistic type enterprise.
Surely it is agreed that individual needs
are solvable in that manner. Individuals
in the United States desired automobiles.
Capitalistic enterprise provides them. If
they desire social security, capitalistic-
type pensions through union activity may
be the answer. What about reclamation,
conservation, education, medicine? The
problem, of course is the establishment
of an awareness in the population of the
social needs, thus making them individual
needs, subject to action under normal
democratic processes.
One could now ask, "Why bother with
educating an awareness of social needs?
These needs are vital and if they can be
fulfilled through communism, let's have
it." Again the answer is basic. Commun-
ism may be better able to satisfy certain
social requirements than capitalism. It
may do so only at the expense of in-
dividual satisfactions—freedom and in-
centive. Moreover, if capitalism falls
short nothing guarantees that communism
will succeed. This "changing the rules of
the game" may produce slight improve-
ment. It is at the risk of creating other,
more harmful, evils. James H. Robinson,
noted educator, has said, "What we need
is a change of attitude, and without this
our new regulations often leave the old
old situation unaltered." Just as Prohibi-
tion cannot be legislated, neither can so-
cial security, conservation, or minimum
wage be assured unless the populace is
sufficiently aroused to insist upon the en-
forcement of these social requirements.
We have seen that our social problems
can be solved not by changing our eco-
nomic or political system, but by a demo-
cratic process resulting from an increased
awareness of social needs. Thus the true
social need is apparent—education. This
education should not be an extension of
most present day training. Social and
political awareness does not result from
education aimed at increasing the in-
dividual's personal worldly success. Nor
does it come from an increased personal
culture. Instead the need is for a knowl-
edge of economics, sociology, political
science, and most important of all, for
logical thought.
Above everything, education should
strive to create logical thought. Without
it our social sciences become meaningless
or hopelessly misleading, the alchemies,
astrologies, and pseudo-sciences of our
time. But aided by rational thought the
studies of economics or psychology ap-
proach the clarity of thought formerly as-
sociated only with the physical sciences.
It is the lucid, scientific attack that is so
sorely needed in developing a social
awareness.
Yet education for wisdom is most diffi-
cult of all. For even our educators are
not all wise. How many thousands of
engineering students graduate from our
leading universities with small minds and
large handbooks? Nevertheless, if we are
to succeed at all, the goal must be to
create the ability to think clearly, to draw-
logical conclusions from established facts.
The responsibility of education is
enormous. Public opinion, the social
awareness, grows from it. Whether in the
home, school, press, or radio, education is
creating our world of tomorrow. With a
public enlightenment of social require-
ments and a trained ability to draw ra-
tional conclusions, that tomorrow may be
our "brave, new world."

so dead, that never to himself hath said,
"now why wouldn't it be a good idea to
do it like this . . . .?" All of us, from
time to time, have flights of fancy in
which we envision a better method, or a
new gadget of some type, and a few of
us even go ahead and design this thing,
and forget it. Then when someone else
does likewise, but proceeds to market it,
we mentally kick ourselves for discarding
our original idea. So why not get a patent
on the next one—it might pay off!
Authority for the granting of patents is
derived from the Constitution of the
United States which provides that
"The Congress shall have power . . .
to promote the progress of science and
useful arts, by securing for limited times
to authors and inventors the exclusive
right to their respective writings and dis-
coveries" (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8).
The basis of our present patent system
was laid by the Patent Act of 1836, which
established the Patent Office and the
present system of examining claims as
they are presented, rather than merely re-
cording the claim and depending upon
subsequent court proceedings to establish
or disprove it. This act also defined the
following catagorys of original or new
items as patentable:
1. An art; as designating a process or
method.
2. A machine or device.
3. An article of manufacture.
4. A composition of matter.
5. Improvements in processes, devices,
articles of manufacture or compositions of
matter.
Not every new process, machine, etc.,
listed under these satagorys is patentable.
The courts have held that such new item
must come under the legal terms of an
invention, that the mere idea is not suffi-
cient to constitute patentable material.
The conception of an invention, further,
must include more than the day to day
improvements made in some existing art
or process. The United States Supreme
Court defined this by the statement that
an invention "must reveal the flash of
genius" (Cuno Engineering Corp. vs. The
Automatic Devices Corp., 314 U.S. 84,
USSC, 1941.) The Patent Office has,
SECURING A PATENT
BY
RICHARD A. HUMES, '51EE
however, followed a much more liberal
practice in granting patents than have the
courts in sustaining them.
The idea, also, must be followed by its
embodiment in practical form, as in a
drawing, a workable model, or some like
tangible proof that this invention exists.
Revised Statutes have further specified
that the subject matter of a patentable in-
vention must be new and useful. In
other words, a device must not only be
capable of accomplishing the purpose for
which it was intended but this purpose
must be a useful one. To illustrate: a
machine designed to produce synthetic
salt water would probably not be patent-
able. Likewise, patents will not be grant-
ed on devices which claim to operate as
perpetual motion. As to novelty of the
invention, it must not have been publi-
cally known or used, or used commercially
prior to application. For example, in the
cases of some traditional or ancient proc-
ess which has had public use, or where the
inventor has used the process in secret for
more than one year, and then files for
protection when a competitor discovers
the secret, no patent will be issued, and
the invention must be considered public
property.
Any person is eligible to file for a pat-
ent, except employees of the Patent Office,
regardless of age, citizenship, or race.
The only restriction is that the person ap-
plying must be the original inventor, with
the only exceptions being made in the
case of death or insanity of the inventor.
An inventor may assign his patent to
another person or corporation, but he
alone must file the original papers. When
several persons have jointly developed a
patentable item, they may file as joint in-
ventors, but each such person must have
been instrumental in the actual inventing.
This excludes one who may have financed
the inventor, or contributed in some like
manner.
The old question of "who was first,"
in the case of duplicate applications does
not rest solely upon the time of filing the
application, but depends upon many fac-
tors, and each case is determined on its
own merits, through hearings of the
Patent Board. In the event that one of
the parties does not feel that the decision
was just, he may appeal to the courts.
A complete patent application filed at
the Patent Office consists of the follow-
ing:
1. Petition to the Commissioner re-
questing the grant of a patent.
2. Power of attorney for persons
(usually a registered Patent attorney) rep-
resenting you.
3. Specification and claims describing
and claiming the invention.
4. Oath that all the above are correct.
5. Drawings, whenever the subject-
matter of the invention is capable of be-
ing illustrated.
6. Government filing fee of $30.
The terms of the petition and the
specification and claims must follow a
standard procedure, within rather strict
bounds. Any slight deviation from the
established forms or method is cause for
the patent applications to be refused
pending correction. For the average citi-
zen who desires a patent on some gadget
he has invented, the method that will be
best in the long run, in all ways, be it
time, cost, or just convenience, is for the
person to hire a reputable registered
Patent Attorney to prepare and process
his claim for him. This method will also
practically insure against possible rejec-
tion of the original application on the
grounds of incorrectness or incomplete-,
ness, and also guard against final rejec-
tion due to the specification being too
vague or general. The Patent Attorney is
usually a man with both technical and
legal training, and as such can give you
maximum aid in processing your ap-
plication.
When the preliminary examination
shows the papers in acceptable form, a
filing certificate is sent to the applicant.
This entitles the inventor to market his
product under the seal of "patent pend-
ing," which will protect him from any
infringement even though the patent has
not yet been granted.
From here the application is forwarded
to one of the sixty-nine divisions of the
Patent Office for examination according
to the criteria set forth at the beginning
of this article. Its further process through
the mystic halls of government "red tape"
is another story in itself.

who has held a job for a period of time
and, during that time, has built up a false
notion regarding his own importance. He
resents the fact that a new employee is
brought in over him. He is the type of
individual who believes the position
should be given to the man having the
greatest amount of service—provided, of
course, that he is that man. He fails to
ask himself, "Why am I more valuable
now than I was twenty years ago—What
have I done that should make me more
valuable to my employer?" He fails to
realize that he may have been in a rut
for twenty years. He may never have
had the ability that the younger man
possesses.
The man who is inclined to overrate
his own ability may very likely build up a
case for himself. He tells his fellow em-
ployees his troubles and of his own im-
portance. He may even tell his employer
these things. He brags about the jobs
he could get at higher salaries. In fact,
eventually, he comes to believe these
stories. He may even tell his employer
that unless he is promoted or receives an
increase in pay he will quit. The time
may come when, although the employer
does not discharge him, he has to quit to
save his face. Almost invariably, the man
then finds himself in a position of lesser
importance, and with a salary less than
he received before.

Not so many years ago, a moderately
successful contractor in Peoria, Illinois,
decided to retire. During his long busi-
ness career, he had managed to accumu-
late a sizable sum of money, and hence,
could afford to be a little generous.
Now, for many years, two of his fore-
men had been with him and had stood
faithfully by him through good times and
bad. As his time for retirement grew
near, this contractor, being a good soul,
wanted to show his appreciation for their
seadfast loyalty. After considerable
thought he hit upon a plan to reward
them.
Calling them into his office one day, he
said, "Boys, I have one more job I want
you to do before I retire. I've secured
two fine lots in the new addition on the
west side of town, and I'd like you to
build a large six-room house on each."
As on previous assignments, one
foreman undertook the construction of
one home, while the other foreman pro-
ceeded to build the other.
The first foreman was always anxious
to "get the job over with." In his haste,
he would take unnecessary short-cuts.
Where three nails should be driven, he
would drive two, and where four support-
ing boards were required, he would use
three. Thus, he constructed his house
carelessly, hastily, and shoddily.
The other foreman, however, went
about the construction of his house in an
entirely different manner. Where three
nails were needed, he used three; where
four supporting boards wre called for, he
used four. His house throughout was con-
structed carefully and judiciously, as if he
himself were to live in it.
Finally, the two houses were completed.
The contractor again called his two fore-
men into his office. "Boys," he began,
"You've been with me a good many years.
Through good times and bad you have
stuck with me, always doing the tasks as-
signed you. Such loyalty certainly de-
serves some sort of a reward, so I've de-
cided to give you something for your
faithfulness. The house that each of
you recently completed is yours. Yes,
boys, the house and the lot are both yours.
You have each built your own home, and
it hasn't cost you a cent.
Well, it doesn't take much figuring to
decide which of the two men was over-
joyed and which was bitterly repentent.
How often have we ourselves been
guilty of such action—of doing a job in
a careless but passable manner, when only
a little more care would have resulted in a
much better job? The moral of this tale
can be summed up very nearly by the
axiom, "Anything worth doing is worth
doing well."

The fact that a man has a high IQ does
not necessarily guarantee that he will get
along well in engineering. It is in his
favor, yes, but there are other factors that
should be considered. The Army learned
during the war that the AGGT (Army
General Classification Test) was not a
satisfactory measure of success in the
Army Specialized Training Program, a
program which was essentially engineer-
ing. One of the students in our AST
program had an AGCT score of 143, far
above the 115 required for entrance and
the 110 required for officer's candidate
school. In spite of this he was among
those who were not getting along well.
Why? In this instance the answer was
easily found. He was a professional mu-
sician. He was not interested in engi-
neering. To have the mentality without
the interest is not enough.

If American industry were wide awake,
it would look into the future grimly, for
in not too distant years scientists and
engineers will be so scarce that our highly
revered tycoons will have difficulty keep-
ing production lines creaking, much less
finding trained men to improve the tech-
nological state of their enterprises. That
this statement is not exaggerated is borne
out by the fact that more and more grad-
uates of the nation's leading technical
schools are turning to positions in sales.
The number has reached eighty percent of
the total in some schools.
The reasons are painfully obvious. In-
dustry insists on offering absurdly low
salaries to men of science while it offers
tremendous opportunities to the glib
priests of the sales god. And the man in
the street daily learns through favorite
periodicals of the heroism of the country
doctor but hears little (except in war) of
the toiling men of the drawing board
who have every right to recognition and
to a high measure of security.
It takes little imagination to envision
the advent of the day when the United
States can no longer depend on huge re-
serves of natural resources to make it an
economically competitive entity. And it
takes little thought to conceive of the ar-
rival of this disaster concurrently with a
dearth of scientists and engineers so
stringent that we shall not be able tol look
to technology for salvation. The present
situation is not serious; it is alarming!

HAROLD A.TAYLOR, 'I7e
Harold A. Taylor, '\le earlier this year
embarked upon new and important re-
sponsibilities after four years of service
in key military government posts in Land
Bavaria. In June, he accepted appoint-
ment as Chief of the Bipartite Commerce
&amp; Industry Group, an Anglo-American
organization in Frankfurt, Germany,
which is guiding the postwar industrial re-
construction of Bizonal Germany. Born
in 1894 in Rochester, Michigan, he enter-
ed the University in 1913 and became one
of the most active students on Campus.
As a Freshman, he played on the baseball
team and on his class football eleven.
Later in his academic career, he became
a member of Tau Beta Pi, Vulcans, Tri-
angles, Theta Delta Chi fraternity, the
Engineer Society, and Treasurer of the
Student Council.
He served as Business Manager of The
Michigan Technic and Chairman of his
Class Memorial Fund, and also was a
member of the now-defunct Owls, Griffins
and Web &amp; Flange organizations. Shortly
after graduation, he entered the United
States Army as a Private and rose through
the ranks to become a First Lieutenant in
World War I. After service in France
and Germany, he studied at the University
of Touloune in France before returning to
the United States.
He takes to his new post a background
of twenty-seven years' experience in the
commerce and industry field. From 1922
to 1925 he was District Manager of the

HAROLD TAYLOR

waukee, Wisconsin. Then, for fifteen
years, he served as District Manager for
the Concrete Steel Company of New York
City, and from 1940 to 1942, he was
Product Manager of the Truscon Steel
Company, New York City. With the out-
break of World War II, he returned to
the United States Army, serving as a

New RCA electron tube gives today's amazing computing machines an indispensable memory.
memory keeps answers on
So complex are present scientific
studies—such as in atomic research
—that working out the "arithmetic"
could take all of our scientists' time.
Short cut through this drudgery is
found in huge electronic computers, able
to add or multiply numbers as large as a
thousand billion in milliontlis of a second.
But such speed is valueless unless—with
comparable speed—the results of count-
less computations can be kept "on file"
and taken out again.
Such a "file" now exists in a "memory"
tube, developed at RCA Laboratories. It re-
tains figures fed into calculating machines,
stores them, memorizes new ones—speeds
solutions through mazes of mathematics.
Uses of RCA's "memory" tube are many.
It will help atomic scientists acquire new
knowledge . . . provide new information
on supersonic flight . . . even help make
rapid weather predictions! It is an in-
valuable instrument in the scientist's cam-
paign to penetrate the unknown.
For your benefit: Development of the
"memory" tube is another basic advance
pioneered at RCA Laboratories. Contin-
ued leadership in science and engineering

tensile stress will exist in the concrete.
Some experts think that concrete can take
a tensile load of 300 psi., and they claim
that fracture will occur only at a point
where this stress is exceeded by 45%.
The equivalent stress in the steel will,
therefore, be 300 x 1.45 x —1.45 = 5580
psi. or about iy2 tons/sq. in. If this value
is adopted, the steel will not be used to its
full extent. However, higher values have
been used, and other concrete experts
from their land experience point out that
stresses in the concrete equivalent to
12,000-16,000 psi. in the steel reinforce-
ment of water tanks have been used.
It should be assumed that concrete takes
some tension, otherwise reinforced con-
crete vessels are an impossibility. As to
the allowable stress at which concrete will
not fracture, or fractures slightly, but does
not lose its watertightness, it is difficult
to state any definite values, since experts
disagree considerably. It should be noted
that when allowable tensile stress in the
steel is 16,000 psi., the concrete exhibits
elastic properties.
Thus, the designer has a choice of two
methods in determining scantlings of
concrete ships:
(1) Application of first principles.
(2) Attempting to provide the same
strength as found in equivalent elements
in steel ships.
Application of first principles does not
mean that previous experience and prac-
tice from other fields such as land work
should not be taken. Obviously, care must
be taken to see if the basic assumptions
made for land use will apply for concrete
shipbuilding also. The calculation of
bending moments is basically the same as
for steel ships, and a description can be
CONCRETE SHIPS

found in various naval architecture text
books. The procedure is more difficult in
computing the section modulus of the
midship section, since there are two ma-
terials present. It is customary to make
some assumptions such as omitting the
side shell and taking only the top flanges
and thus simplifying the calculation of
the section modulus.
Methods of Construction
There are two main methods of con-
struction of concrete ships:
(a) Monolithic Method.
(b) Section Method.
The monolithic method consists of
pouring of concrete continuously, avoid-
ing cleavage lines. This method has the
disadvantages of requiring many workers
and favorable weather conditions for the
construction of the ship. In practice a
purely monolithic method can be used
only in the case of small vessels. In large
vessels, when the operation of poring
concrete is not continuous, care should
be taken to secure perfect adhesion (by
staggering the junctions in a similar man-
ner as in steel shell plating, etc.) be-
tween adjacent sections. In the sectional
method various parts are cast separately
from reusable molds. These sections are
then assembled in place, and care should
be taken to provide continuity in the rein-
forcing material. Those who favor the
section method claim that watertightness
can be attained easily and that cracks due
to the contraction of concrete on setting
are unlikely to be developed. Since the
weight of the ship must be kept low, care-
ful workmanship is necessary to insure
that the rods are placed in their exact
position. Likewise, the steel rods should
be fully embedded in the concrete. If they

protrude they are subject to sea and at-
mospheric corrosion, thus reducing the
strength and life of the metal consider-
ably.
Concrete Ship "Economics" and Design
The same basic principles of steel ship
"economics" apply to concrete ships as
well. Thus, besides satisfactory strength
requirements, a concrete ship should prove
to be economical in the matter of relative
cost.
As mentioned, in order to provide
strength in a structural member which
will take a certain load, sufficient ma-
terial should be supplied. It is clear that
if reinforced concrete is used, a greater
weight of material will have to be used,
as compared with steel is made. This
means an increase in weight and cost.
As the weight is increased, the dead-
weight capacity is reduced. Thus when
comparing steel and concrete ships they
can be compared on the basis of dead
weight capacity. For an equal dead
weight a concrete ship will be larger,
thus having increased draft and requiring
larger motors to propel the concrete ship
at the same speed as the steel ship.
Comparing for example a concrete and
a steel ship, both of 300 tons dead weight.
Concrete Steel
Wt. of bare hull 290 tons 120 tons
Steel Deight 28^ tons 110 tons
Cubic Capacity 17,320 cu. ft. 12,500 cu ft.
Length 125 ft. 105 ft.
Breadth 25 ft. 21 ft.
Depth ll'-9" ll'-4"
Displacement 640 tons 455 tons
For this example it is seen that a con-
crete vessel will be considerably heavier
than a steel ship according to the size of
the vessel. The weight of steel reinforce-
ment will increase with the size as well,
and there are practical limits to the size
of a concrete ship; the larger the ship, the
greater the amount of steel reinforcement
required. It is difficult to state any defi-
nite value, but from land experience, civil
engineers are in agreement that there
comes a point where the amount of steel
required to take up the stresses in a rein-
forced concrete beam is so large that the
reinforced concrete can no longer be
used economically.
A comparison between steel and rein-
forced concrete ships on a basis of length
can be made: a concrete ship of 375 ft.

Fingers of flame that pierce solid rock
Yes, through a dramatic new process known as jet-piercing
. . . holes can now be burned straight and true through
solid rock! The harder the rock the more efficient the oper-
ation! A special combination of oxygen, fuel, and water
does the job . . . and in a fraction of the time required by
the old drill attack.
This process is of particular significance to the steel in-
dustry today. Why? Because government surveys show that
America's reserves of top-grade iron ore—source of steel-
are fast being reduced. But there remain almost inexhaust-
ible beds of the once scorned low-grade iron ore called
taconile.
The extremely hard and dense nature of taconite makes
usual mining methods too costlv and impractical. But the
jet-piercing process—with 1/10 the equipment and at a
reasonable cost—will burn holes straight into the solid taco-
nite so that it can be blasted into lumps of usable size.
Also, destructive abrasion from the sharp-edged rock on
loading and crushing equipment is being better controlled
by machine parts made from extra-hard alloy steels. And
to concentrate the iron content of the ore, new chemical
processes can flush away much of the "waste" matter —thus
leaving an ore 30% richer, for more efficient smelting.
The people of Union Carbide created the jet-piercing
flame process as well as many of the alloys, chemicals, and
other materials essential to today's mining efficiency. And
FCC stands ready to help solve problems in other fields of
American enterprise . . . wherever better basic materials
and better processes are needed.

weight a steel ship of the same length
will carry. Thus, for the ship to be eco-
nomical, the loss of dead weight should
be compensated by lower first costs of
ship and lower maintenance. Major M.
Denny (I.N.A. Transactions 1918 — "A
Preliminary Survey of the Possibility of
Reinforced Concrete as a Material for
Ship Construction") gives an eypression
for maximum cost of bare hull (x) of
concrete ship assuming a certain profit
(y) per annum as % of total cost and
general expenses per annum (z):
x == 68 -- 17z
(assuming the concrete ship dead weight
is 83% of the steel ship dead weight)
It is suggested that this expression should
be taken as a guide only, showing only
relative values.
Unless a lighter concrete is used in
shipbuilding (the standard concrete
weighs 150 Ibs. per cu. ft.), the concrete
ship will be at a serious disadvantage.
Though a great number of ships are built
on the basis of dead weight, there are
CONCRETE SHIPS
(Continued from page 18)
many ships whose cubic capacity is of
greater importance. When a ship is de-
signed on a basis of cubic capacity, con-
crete is not at a disadvantage, since for a
certain dead weight it has a larger capac-
ity as compared to a steel ship.
Concrete ships have the disadvantage
that for a certain dead weight they have a
larger net tonnage and consequently an
increase in harbor dues. When consider-
ing the problem of repairs, experience has
shown that repair costs are considerably
lower for concrete ships. Where main
structural parts of the ship are involved,
the repair costs may be cheaper than in
steel ships, but the vessel cannot be put to
sea before concrete in the repaired part
has "weathered."
It is difficult to state definitely that con-
crete ships are cheaper than steel ships.
The cost is a function of material used,
and experience shows that different build-
ers used varying amounts of steel rein-
forcement. The saving in steel varies
from about 30%-65%, depending on the
type, size of vessel and allowable stresses
used. The cost varies also with the
amount of labor required, which in turn
depends on the method of construction
and number of ships built to same de-
sign. If builders use replaceable molds for
pouring the concrete, the cost can be re-
duced. Concrete ships will also depend
on the relative cost of concrete and steel.
for when the price of steel is high,
chances are that concrete will be more
economical. So in countries where con-
crete is cheap, it can be an economical
proposition, but each case has to be
studied individually. In most cases a con-
crete ship is larger than a steel ship (for
same deadweight), but this factor should
be offset by the advantages of a cheaper
hull and lower depreciation. Although
sufficient data is lacking for an accurate
life expectancy of a concrete ship, esti-
mates have been made as high as 50
years. Lower repair and maintenance cost
are also offsetting factors to reduced dead
weight.
Let us consider the speed of construc-
tion of concrete vessels. Experience has
shown that the first concrete vessels built
did not show any saving in time of con-
struction, and occasionally it took even

equivalent steel ship. This was due to
many unexpected difficulties encountered
during construction. On the other hand,
during this war, a considerable number of
barges and similar unpropelled craft were
built in this country and in England to
the satisfaction of the builders and oper-
ators, and were completed with consid-
erable speed. Thus, the speed of con-
struction varies with the design of the
vessel and the experience of the build-
ers. During this war, as mentioned prev-
iouesly, the Germans built a number of
concrete ships and barges. The vessels
were built by inexperienced engineers
and, therefore, innumerable difficulties
were encountered. The time taken to
build these vessels was considerably longer
than that to build equivalent steel ves-
sels. In England, a number of floating
docks were built at an average time of
four weeks each, without using skilled

due to lack of experience. No account
was taken of the fact that when concrete
is poured the holds become larger as a
result of the weight of concrete. Through
experience an allowance can be made,
and a practical deadweight displacement
coefficient can be assumed.
The following table (taken from The
North-East Coast Institution of Engineers
and Shipbuilders Transactions, 1918,
Paper by T. J. Gueritte) gives values for
dead weight displacement coefficients:
Dear Weight 1000 2000 4000 6000
Steel .625 .688 .721 .728
Fero-Concrete .450 .546 .619 .652

ment of concrete ships over steel ships

labor from other industries. It may be
concluded that in case of emergency, if a
number of ships of same type and size are
required concrete ships can be built at a
considerable speed.
The determination of dimensions of
concrete ships does not differ basically
from steel ship design. Unfortunately,
when the first concrete ships were built,
a great disappointment was caused by
poor estimate of dead weight. This was
used. In the design of lines, the naval
architect has to make a compromise be-
tween an efficient hull form, having mini-
mum resistance, and a form having curva-
ture only in one direction. The parts of
the hull having curvature in two direc-
tions are difficult to construct and thus
make the vessel expensive. From tank
test it was proved that refining the block
coefficient by .01 had a considerable effect
on resistance. The curve of sectional areas
is generally regarded as the determining
feature of resistance. This also applies to
concrete ships, but by adoption of straight
lines in design increased resistance oc-
curs. For example when a knuckle was
eliminated with the waterline unaltered
and practically the same curve of cross
sectional areas maintained, the resistance
was reduced 40%. (I.N.A. Transactions,
1918—T. G. Owens Thurston—Concrete
Ships).
Conclusion
Some naval architects may consider
concrete ships as a subject belonging to
history, and it is true that concrete ships
have certain disadvantages. However, ex-
perience shows that they can be built to
satisfy strength requirements, and can be
mass-produced. Where dead weight is
not the main consideration, concrete ships
are advantageous. Thus for certain type
of craft, especially at locations where steel
is expensive, it can be a substitute for
steel. Unfortunately, the attempt made
to build concrete ships was done by engi-
neers not having sufficient experience in
marine work, or by naval architects with
little experience in concrete design and,
therefore, some ships had defects. In re-
cent years, new methods were used in con-
crete structures, and very encouraging re-
sults were obtained by using pre-stressed
concrete. By this method, compressive
stress in the compression side of a beam
reaches its maximum, while little or no
tensile stress is experienced by the ten-
sion side. Though no experiments were
done to apply this method in sh'pbuilding&gt;
the results obtained in construction of
bridges is encouraging, and the field has
still not been fully explored. It is very
likely that by the use of this method,
a better use of concrete will be made, and
a new phase will start in concrete ship-
building. It should be remembered that
whenever any large number of concrete
ships were built, they were built under ab-
normal conditions such as war emer-
gencies, when the main object was to ob-
tain a ship quickly. Then only little
time could be spent on experiments and
economical considerations were not of
first importance. For these reasons no
attempts were made to make better use of
concrete. The field is unlimited, and
there are good reasons to believe that by
application of the new methods mention-
ed, and the possible future use of light-
weight concrete, concrete shipbuilding
can assume greater importance.

How to help a bread slicer
carve a name for itself
Designers of a new, 75-loaves-a-minute bread slicer
were looking for a way to insure long-term accuracy
and minimum maintenance. They found the answer
in Timken* tapered roller bearings.
Timken bearings keep the knife drum shafts in
rigid alignment, maintain precision movement of
parts. They require minimum attention, normally
last the life of the machine. And they permit tighter
closures that keep the lubricant on the bearings
. . . off the bread.
Why they all look alike
to a TIMKEN bearing
Loads from any direction—radial, thrust or combi-
nations of both—are carried by Timken bearings,
thanks to their tapered design. Timken tapered
roller bearings make auxiliary thrust bearings and
thrust plates unnecessary . . . simplify design, save

Billion Dollar Industry
Television's spectacular rise as a new
service cf mass corrmuiication is without
precedent in the industrial history of the
United States, Frank M. Folson, President
of the Radio Corporation of America,
declared in a year-end statement.
"During October, after only three years
of production, television achieved the go-
ing rate of a billion-dollar-a-year indus-
try," Mr. Folsom reported. "No other
new enterprise of the past has moved
ahead so far in so short a time.
"At the erd of 1949, the wholesale
value of all television sets purchased by
the American public exceeds one billion
dollars—another unequalled record. The
automobile industry, opsrating in a much
higher price bracket, required more than
ten years to achieve a similar status.
"So great was the public demand for
television receivers, particularly in the
last half of 1949, that some of the major
producers were from two to eight weeks
late in deliveries. The total number of
sets produced and sold during the year
amounted to 2,500,000, or 500,000 more
than had been predicted. In New York
City alone, the number of television sets
in use rose to 1,000,000."
The outlook for television in 1950 is
exceptionally good, said Mr. Folsom, as-
serting that industry may be expected to
produce and sell between 3,500,000 and
4,000,000 video receivers, bringing the
total number of sets in use by the begin-
ning of 1951 to more than 7,000,000. The
potential audience will then number at
least 25,000,000 persons.
"To achieve new production records in
1950," he continued, "industry reports
indicate that capacity will be increased
by nearly 50 percent. This will be ac-
complished through the addition of new
manufacturing facilities. The only limit-
ing factor that can be forseen at this time
will be, as it was in 1949, the ability of
component parts manufacturers to keep
pace with demand.

siles moving many times faster than sound
and even making pictures of sound waves
themselves.
William R. Plant, speaking before a
meeting of the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers, described methods
for making pictures with exposures of a
few millionths of a second. He also said
that techniques have been devised for
making sound waves visible as they pass
through air.
Such pictures are proving invaluable in
research into the behavior of missiles in
flight and wind-tunnel models of faster-
than-sound airc aft, he said.
"High-speed photography is often the
only way to gather information on action
thousands of times quicker than the eye
can follow," according to the G-E engi-
neer.
The fastest camera shutter can only cut
exposure time down to one-thousandths
of a second, which is long enough for an
Army rifle bullet to travel almost two
feet. Hence, exposures in the millionth-
of-a-second range must be made with
quick flashes of light rather than by means
cf fast shutters, he told the meeting.
Plant described a special photolight.
which gives a brilliant flash of light
lasting only two-millionths of a sec-
ond. He showed pictures of bullets and
shells in flight which were taken with an
ordinary camera and the high-speed
photolight.
Photographing sound waves, which
move at about 700 miles per hour, re-
quires a high-speed flash and a special
optical system, which can cast into sharp
relief varying densities of air. This
method is known as "Schlieren techni-
que," and produces photographic images
of sound waves, which are areas of high
compression in air.
Crickets are Annoying
Engineers are just beginning to learn
to measure what it is about the noise of
crickets that can disturb a conversation,
and what the difference is between the
tone of a Stradivarius violin and a moun-
taineer's fiddle.
For many years there have been in-
struments for measuring the loudness and
frequency of sounds, but that engineers
have onily recently begun to measure cer-
tain other important qualities.
Cricket noises and the sound of violins
are examples of sounds that cannot be

The world is tuned to pipes like these
PETROLEUM, as a fuel and as a lubricant,
has become the basic material of progress
—and petroleum products could not be
made available in great quantities at low
cost if it were not for pipelines.
Oil transporters pioneered low-cost,
long-haul methods of handling liquids in
large quantities. Today the users of oil
(which includes just about everybody),
and of many other products as well, live
better because petroleum research men and
engineers found ways to get the job done.
Here at Standard Oil we are developing
new methods to increase the efficiency and
economy of pipelines. Externally, our
lines now have cathodic protection; an
electric current is imposed on the line to
prevent dissolving the metal of the pipe
at points where it is in direct contact with
soil. Internally, corrosion is inhibited by
the injection of sodium chromate solutions
that form a protective film. Both meth-
ods minimize costly shutdowns of our
pipelines. Even more improved methods
are now being sought.
From their work with pipelines, as from
their work with all other phases of our
business, Standard Oil scientists can feel
the satisfaction of accomplishment and
the challenge of all that remains to be done.

PROBLEM — Your company manufactures gas
burners of varying number and spacing of gas
ports. You want to develop a drilling machine
which can be changed over with a minimum of
time and effort to drill the holes in the different
burner castings. How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—The illustration shows
how one manufacturer solved this problem by
using S.S.White flexible shafts as spindles.
This arrangement makes possible quick changes
of spindle groupings to meet different require-
ments. As here, S.S.White flexible shafts make
ideal power drives for almost any machine part
which must be adjustable.
This is just one of the
hundreds of remote
control and power drive
problems to which S. S.
White flexible shafts
provide a simple ans-
wer. Engineers will find
it worthwhile to be famil-
iar with the range and

completely understood in terms of conventional measurements
of loudness and frequency alone.
Sound measurements in the past have taken into considera-
tion the frequency and loudness, but not the constantly chang-
ing quality of sound. It is quite possible that it is this tiny
wavering that accounts for characteristics of certain sounds
that the ear can detect but which instruments have not been
able to measure.
Cricket noises coming through a window aren't ordinarily
loud enough to register on most sound-measuring instruments,
but there is something about them that has an effect on human
ears far out of proportion to their energy, which is probably
something like .000000001 of a watt.
Engineers are now beginning to study sounds in terms of
their changing quality as well as in terms of loudness and
frequency at a given point in time. This approach promises
new understanding of sound problems, and new advances in
sound engineering should result.
Health and Wealth Go Up in Smoke
....// you live in an industrial community General Electrics
photoelectric smoke control device could help you reduce your
laundry bills, your house-cleaning time, and let your garden
grow. Better health and spirits could result for you, too.
It isn't a miracle-worker this smoke control device, but it
does assure cleaner air for many.
Recent news stories from Donora, Pennsylvania, focused
attention on a much-ignored subject atmospheric pollution.
Particles of tar, ash, sulphur, and other air-borne substances
can cause untold damage, within a short time or over a span
of years. ..^
Surveys show that cities with the highest rate of air pollu-
tion also rate highest in pneumonia deaths. But no one has at-
tempted to measure human discomfort, waning vitality, and de-
pression of spirit. Nor can the damage to property begin to
be estimated.
General Electric's photoelectric smoke control device em-
ploys a simple and effective principle in subduing and routing
the wind-carried enemy. A light source and a light sensitive
phototube are installed, facing each other, in a smoke duct be
tween the furnace and stack. Elsewhere, perhaps in the office
of the firing superintendent, is installed the smoke density
indicator, a compact instrument which registers smoke density
at all times. If the smoke's density rises above a predeter-
mined level—at which light from the light source does not
reach the phototube—a red warning light flashes on.
From that point, either the fire tender or an automatic
smoke-combustion device takes over.

New Steak Stocking
The owner of a Washington restau-
rant gives his General Electric home
freezer a grateful vote of thanks. It has,
he says, proved its worth in several ways—
saves him 10 per cent on his meat bill,
and assures fresher tastier steaks for his
gourmet patrons.
Before this freezer was installed, a
walkin freezer was used for meat storage.
Cooks had become carelessly accustomed
to putting newly-arrived meats on the top
of the pile. Older cuts stayed on the bot-
tom. Spoilage resulted from this system.
With the new freezer, however, smaller
stocks of meat are kept, turnover is
quicker, and both proprietor and custo-
mers are happier about the whole thing.
Not long ago a fire in the restaurant's
basement damaged all the food in the
walk-in freezer. But the General Electric
home freezer survived both fire and par-
tial submersion with no ill effects upon
its tasty hoard.

Glass that picks fire out of a light beam
The electric lamps you see between the boxes
on the table are exactly alike—they generate
both powerful light and intense heat.
If you should concentrate the beam of one
of them with a reflector and plug it into an
ordinary socket, you'd be practically blinded
by its glare and your clothes scorched by
the heat—unless you turned away fast!
But look what happens when you put them
into the fixtures in the foreground, so their
beams are covered by two different kinds of
Corning glass.
The beam from the bulb on the left is
cooled down so sharply that you can hold a
wisp of newspaper in it for hours without
its catching fire. Yet the light is almost as
dazzling as ever.
Notice now that no light apparently shines
from the bulb in the fixture on the right. But
if you hold a piece of newspaper over it—
in a matter of seconds you have fire in your
hands!
The explanation is: One of the glass plates
transmits the comparatively cool, visible rays
generated by the bulb, blocking off most of
the invisible heat rays. The other allows only
the invisible heat rays to pass.
These pieces of glass are only two of the
dozens of ray-transmitting or ray-blocking
glasses that Corning makes—glasses that
can pick out any segment of the light spec-
trum and put it where it's needed.
For example, a lamp shielded with a Corn-
ing glass which transmits only near ultravio-
let rays lights automobile instrument panels
without glare. Another kind of Corning glass
transmits only invisible infrared rays and
is used in electronically controlled burglar
alarm systems.
Throughout industry, Corning means re-
search in glass—and these ray-blocking, ray-
transmitting glasses represent only one of a
multitude of outstanding developments that
have earned Corning this reputation.
We hope you'll keep in mind that Corning
research and technical skill have made glass
one of the most versatile engineering mate-
rials there is.
for when you're out of school and are
concerned with product and process plan-
ning, you'll find it to your advantage to call
on Corning before your plans reach the blue-
print stage. Corning Glass Works, Corning,

evident in two different ways. In the first
method, aluminum paint powder was
suspended in the fluid. The powder was
brightly lighted as the individual particles
passed through the illuminated region.
In the second method, a glycerine solu-
tion which exhibited high, double refrac-
tive properties when in a state of shear
was used in the annulus. The planes of
equal shear then appeared as streamlines
when polarized light was directed through
the fluid. Thus the formation of the
streamlines could be observed.
Results of Experimental Study
A number of interesting and useful
results were obtained in the course of
the experimental work. These will be de-
scribed and the significance of each will

1. Vortices always existed in pairs.
This result was to be expected
since no momentum is supplied or

SEALING BY VORTICES
3. Taylor's speed criterion was found
to be correct even with the con-
dition of finite length of the an-
nulus. In every case for which
computation was made, it was
found that the predicted speed, ac-
cording to Taylor, was a value in-
termediate between the speed at
which the Couette flow pattern was
observed to break down and the
speed at which the vortex systems
were fully developed throughout
the annulus.
4. When the top and bottom boundary
planes of the individual vortex rings
first became visible, the vortex ring
cross-sections were very nearly
square. This confirmed the work
of Taylor who made his computa-
tions for the instant at which the
instability was first manifested.
5. Data was obtained which made it
possible to compute the number of
vortex pairs that will form in any
annulus when the dimension of the
annulus are given. This makes it
possible to design annuli in which
a predetermined number of vor-
(Continued from page 30)
tices will form naturally.
6. At the first instant of visibility, the
vortex cores were found to be sym-
metrically located and centered in
each individual vortex. As the ro-
tational speed was increased, the
cores were observed to move so that
they appeared to be in pairs, as
shown in Fig. 2.
7. It was observed that the size of the
vortices is flexible within certain
limits. When the length of the
annulus is increased while the ro-
tational speed is constant, the vor-
tices become elongated to account
for this increase in length although
all vortices still are of equal size.
The reverse is true when the length
of the annulus is decreased.
Applications
Vortex systems such as those described
will be formed in any case of fluid flow
over a concave surface. An example is the
flow over an airfoil with a concave trail-
ing surface, such as is used with slotted
wings. Another case is that of flow in
curved channels which are deep com-
pared to their width. Flow in rotary mix-
ers, curved pipes and conduits

The particular application to

seal
a multi-pair system. Such designs are
shown in Figs. 3a, 3b, and 3c. med
The seal shown in Fig. 3a is the simpl- surface \
est. It consists merely of a rectangular v^rtex^ i
groove cut into a rotating shaft which is
enclosed by a fixed, cylindrical housing.
The direction of rotation of the vortex
pair is shown in the figure.
The effectiveness of this seal is in-
creased appreciably if it is arranged as in
Fig. 3b. Here the groove is cut deeper
and a collar or ring of some kind is placed
as shown. In this way there appears to
be less likelihood of oil by-passing the
vortex seal and its resistance to a pres-
sure gradient is increased.
A useful variation in the design is that
shown by Fig. 3c. In this case the collar
is fastened to the rotating shaft.
The research on this seal has not yet
been completed and the pressure gradient
which one pair of rings of a given size
will withstand is not known. It is cer-
tain that this pressure increment is limited
so that for higher pressure it will be
necessary to use several such seals in
series as in the case of labyrinth seals.
The correct ratio "d/a" to be used de-
pends on experimental results; but for

very high speeds, the ratio appears to ap-
proach a limit of 2.73. If the clearance
"a" is too small according to this ratio,
a slight, steady leakage will result. When
"a" is too large, the leakage becomes
j . heavier with greater values of "a."
The results of this seal are:
1. A great reduction in maintenance
since there is no rubbing or wear
of any of the parts.
2. A reduction of power consumption.
3. Simpler construction. It is not
necessary to use rubber, leather,
spring, bellows, carbide blocks, etc.
4. Less space is required. In each case
for which seals have been designed,
less space has been required than
for the previous seal.
The principle disadvantage is that the
seal is not operative below the initial
sealing speed. If there is a static pressure
acting on the seal some mechanical seal
which released, perhaps by centrifugal ac-
tion, would have to be used in conjunc-
tion with the vortex seal. In cases where
the oil or other fluid flows back into a
sump or crankcase under static conditions,
this type of seal is effective.

which there is an affinity between each

Rummaging into his living, the poet
fetches
The images out that hurt and connect.
From life to art by painstaking adap-
tion,
Relying on us to cover the rift;
Only your notes are pure contraption,
Only your song is an absolute gift.'' 3
When in his "AnthenaeunV Schlegel
called music "Architecture in a fluid
state" and architecture "frozen Music" he
may have stretched a point, but his state-
ment is more than a trivial play with anti-
theses. In truth, Music, with its balanced
repetition of parts, with its tonal members
harmonizing and standing in relation each
to the other, with its continuity of growth,
where every bar, phrase or section is what
it is because of what came before, offers
the most decided analogy with architec-
ture. Both are manifestations of man's
supreme gift for creating form—one to
be seen, the other to be heard—both to
be felt.
This being the essential nature of music,
the chief responsibility of the composer
to his art is to reveal his unusual sen-
sitivity to all the sensuous aspects of tone,
and to exploit his medium with all the
imagination and skill at his command.
It is not, as many believe, to create a
world of ideas, concepts, and images—
to offer the listener an incarnation or
representation of the world, communi-
cated by means of music, but not identical
with it. Music is an end in itself, not a
means to one.
The chief responsibility of the re-
creator or performer of a musical score
is to grasp the inner musical meanings
and to reveal them to the listener by the
quality and nuance of the tone elicited
from his instrument, by his sensitive

phrasing, by his intuitive sense of divining
what any group of notes should or could
mean. He must be impelled by a kind
of inner necessity to fully realize the ex-
pressive potentialities of any and every
movement in the score in terms of sheer
sound. A great interpretation is only in
a small part due to any particular intensity
of feeling or emotion on the part of the
performer himself. What he does to the
sound patterns established by the com-
poser, whether under the stimulation of
an emotion or not, determines the validity
of his performance. Everything that is
conveyed from him to the listener is
conveyed as tone and tone alone. The
artist's emotions, feeling, and theories of
beauty may of course definitely condition
the quality of that tone, but they cannot
be transmitted by it.
Since the material, form, content, sub-
ject matter, and expression in music are
entirely of a musical nature, it becomes
apparent to an intelligent listener that
this invisible and dynamic art can only be
experienced for itself alone in the con-
sciousness of the formal sequences es-
tablished by its creator, the composer.
(Continued from page 56)
Thus music demands in a degree that no
other art does, the exertion of an active
and retentive memory. Hearing music is
merely involuntary sufferance; listening
to it is active participation and involves
volitation and the exercise of intelligence.
To retain, even to a degree, what has been
heard, to recognize it when it reappears,
to be aware of its absence and to note the
appearance of new or the modification of
old material demands and rewards com-
plete concentrated attention.
For the serious listener, the value of a
purely musical idea is as profound and
concrete in its significance as any associa-
tion which it could conceivably suggest.
Unfortunately, however, the average lis-
tener is concerned only with the affective
or emotive powers of music and is able
to grasp none of the purely musical mean-
ings of a composition. He often labors
under the illusion that the composer ac-
tually translates into sound his own feel-
ings and emotions and that these same
feelings should be stimulated in him.
When he attempts to express what the
music "means" he descries what it has
done to him. Quite unconsciously he
comes to elieve that the ideas, emotions,
and images evoked by the music are
actually in the music itself, transformed
by some miraculous process into sound.
The music begins to sound to him the
way his emotions make him feel, and so
he identifies the one with the other. Thus
he is led into a world of illusion where
he can spend the moments pleasantly
enough to be sure, but remain utterly un-
aware of the musical experience that is
available to him.
For the composer, the performer, and
the listener, music is a creation, not a
recreation; it is a reality, not a signifying
symbol of one; it is a fulfillment, not a
mere incitement. The experience it of-
fers is unique among the arts and tran-
scends any that reality can provide, for in
the contemplation of the absolute the
mind is freed from all that is mundane.
It is the inestimable gift of music to man-
kind that it can lead us whenever we
desire, out of this world of chaos and dis-
order, into one where reason, law and
order, logic and beauty hold everlasting
sway.

EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
LET'S STOP SOCIALISM
Communists in this country at
the present time are feeling the
full weight of public wrath. It
would seem that they constitute
the greatest threat to our way of
life. It is true that they con-
stitute a traitorous bloc, but if
every Communist in America
were exterminated, the greatest
threat to our present mode of
living would still be with us.
We here in America tend to
overlook the lessons that have
been learned in Europe. While
trying to mold a better way of
living we tend to forget the heart
break and disappointment that
have followed certain so-called
reforms of disappointment is
that of the English people. For
the last 40 years the Socialists
have been working their propa-
ganda into Labor newspapers
and broadcasting their promises
of the good life. Through this
slow creeping, parasitic manner
they have made the English
working people think more and
more of state assured housing,
incomes and security. They have
destroyed to a great extent, in-
centive and initiation in Eng-
land.
Our most dangerous enemy is
not the Communist group, but
the insidious growth of the de-
sire of security at all cost. The
Socialists are at work in this
country. They are working
either knowingly or as dupes to
destroy the very thing that has
made this country great. It
would do no good to have a great
flag waving campaign to rid the
country of Socialists. That would
be pure folly. But let us take a
look at Socialism in action.
World War II left England in
dismal straits. Their whole econ-
omy was geared to production
of war equipment and the main-
tenance of a large military estab-
lishment. All the capitalistic pro-
grams were of hard work and
short rations for at least ten to
fiften years. The Socialists, how-
ever, were ready with their prom-
ises of free hospitalization, free
lunches for school children, jobs
for all, and general promises of
the good life for all. The Eng-
lish people, tired of heavy restric-
tions and delayed plans, fell for
the bait hook, line and sinker.
The Socialists immediately began
to carry out their program.
They nationalized the Bank of
England which gave them control
of credit, the transportation
systems, the communications sys-
tems and the public utilities.
This control gave the Socialites a
direct say in every phase of Eng-
lish living. They set up bu-
reaus who determined production
quotas, priorities, prices on raw
materials and finally wage scales.
This rise to power took place in
1945. Now some five years later
let us examine their record.
The rosy dream of an abund-
ant life is becoming a bit tar-
nished. The promises of jobs for
all has not been met. The aboli-
tion of poverty has not been ac-
complished. It has, however been
distributed. The industries are
operating only under tremendous
substitutes. The working people
despite the fact that they are
now "owners" of the giant in-
dustries find that they receive
orders from cold impersonal
bureaus. The workers are pro-
ducing less than under private
owners. The railroads are being
operated at great losses. Con-
struction of housing has failed
to meet expectatons. Socialized
medicine has proven to be a
great disappointment. In short
the whole experiment has failed
miserably.
What has this to do with us?
There are those among us that
would subject us to the exact
replica of England's dilemna.
How can we as young engi-
neers entering the business world
recognize and stop Socialism.
We can examine our own per-
spectives and objectives. We
must not sacrifice one of our
basic human rights. We must
stop apologizing for our capital-
istic system. We must stop plan-
ning to make our economy in-
efficient. We must stop this
spending orgy. We must elect
responsible government officials
who will rebuild integrity in our
government.
We as engineers must keep
our feet on the ground while
some of our more broadly edu-
cated individuals build pink
castles in the air.

One of the biggest single housing de-
velopments ever undertaken has
taken its place in the panorama of New
York City's lower East Side. It is the
result of cooperation between private
enterprise, the State, and the City.
The rise of Peter Cooper Village and
adjacent Stuyvesant Town has changed
the face of this 80-acre section of Man-
hattan . . . has transformed a slum area
of tenements and factories into modern,
roomy living quarters for 31,000 people.
Many similar projects . . . some per-
haps not so large, some even larger . . .
must take form before America licks its
housing problem. And they'll all require
vast quantities of steel, for steel is the
backbone of modern construction.
Today the steel industry is looking
ahead toward tomorrow's big projects.
At United States Steel, a vast training
program is going forward continually,
preparing men to handle the many
highly-technical jobs that modern steel-
making involves. Many of these jobs are
far removed physically from the roaring
blast furnaces and glowing open hearths
—at the same time, they are absolutely es-
sential to today's precision steelmaking.
Through its training program. United
States Steel is laying the foundations for
promising futures for young men who
meet its qualifications.

Strength factors of Long Life!
'ithout shock strength—or, for that
matter—without all oi the strength factors
listed opposite—no pipe laid 100 years
ago in city streets would be in service
today. But, in spite of the evolution of
traffic from horse-drawn vehicles to heavy
trucks and buses—and today's vast
complexity of subway and underground
utility services — cast iron gas and water
mains, laid over a century ago, are
serving in the streets of more than 30
cities in the United States and Canada.
Such service records prove that cast iron
pipe combines all the strength factors of
long life with ample margins of safety. No
pipe that is provably deficient in any of
these strength factors should ever be laid
in city streets. Cast Iron Pipe Research

The toughness of cast iron pipe which enables
it to withstand impact and traffic shocks, as
well as the hazards in handling, is demon-
strated by the Impact Test. While under hydro-
static pressure and the heavy blows from a
SO pound hammer, standard 6-inch cast iron
pipe does not crack until the hammer is
dropped 6 times on the same spot from pro-
gressively increased heights of 6 inches.
The ability of cast iron pipe to withstand ex-
ternal loads imposed by heavy fill and un-
usual traffic loads is proved by the Ring
Compression Test. Standard 6-inch cast iron
pipe withstands a crushing weight of more
than 14.000 Ibs. per foot
When cast .iron pipe is subjected to beam
stress caused by soil settlement, or disturbance
of soil by other utilities, or resting on an ob-
struction, tests prove that standard 6-inch cast
iron pipe in 10-foot span sustains a load of
15.000 Ibs.
In full length bursting tests standard 6-inch
cast iron pipe withstands more than 2500 Ibs.

We have good news to
report for the journals
SOME JOURNALS are technical publications.
Some journals are the parts of rotating shafts
that turn in bearings.
For both kinds of journals, there's good news
in Standard Oil's performance testing program.
One result is a new testing device for mill and
locomotive driving-journal grease that enables
us to tell more accurately than ever before what
our greases will do under actual conditions of
use. That, in turn, enables us to proceed more
directly with the job of making our greases
still better.
Standard Oil took the lead in performance
testing, and is a leader today. During the war
our tests furnished information that enabled
the Army to procure certain products with
greatly increased reliability of performance.
Some of our tests have become a part of govern-
ment specifications. Many users of our prod-
ucts are benefiting, both from better products
and from more accurate information.
As time goes on, we are doing more and more
performance testing. In some cases, we have to
develop not only the tests but also the testing
equipment. But to Standard Oil researchers
and engineers, any effort is worth while if it
will help make better, more useful petroleum
products.

TO SOCIETY
Although the engineer is not wholly
responsible for the solutions of social
problems which he, through technology,
has created, he is unjustified in disregard-
ing them.
In the past century, and particularly in
the past fifty years, we have been exposed
to a tremendous amount of technological
development brought about largely by the
engineer. Only recently, however, have
we come to fully realize some of the social
problems which have resulted from these
developments. Since it was the engineer
who at least indirectly caused many of
these existing faults in our society, and
since he may continue to do so, it seems
reasonable that we should investigate as
closely as possible his ensuing obligation
to his fellow man in the solutions of the
problems.
As an initial step in this investigation,
we should naturally determine at least the
major social problems which the engineer
through technology has created. A partial
list of the problems would read as fol-
lows: unemployment, the reduction of the
worker to a machine, the problems of
urbanism caused by a rise of the so-called
"metropolitan areas," decentralization of
the family group, ugliness and filth in our
material environment, excessive speciali-
zation, labor-management relations, and
the problem of public health. This list is
by no means complete; however, it does
illustrate a few of the most important
technologically-caused problems which
face society today. The effects of these
problems, that is their derivative influ-
ences and convergent effects, can best be
exemplified by the examination of one or
two specific problems.
For example, television is a "brain-
child" of the engineer, and it has the
obvious effect of bringing both education
and amusement into the home. Here we
see the derivative influence on the schools,
as television gives us education in the
home which might otherwise require at-
tendance at a school. Also, the presence
of the television set in the home would
seem to decrease the attendance at mov-
ing-picture theaters, since the amusements
the two afford are very similar. We also
can observe that these derivative influ-
ences "fan out," and decrease in their

importance in the process. For example,
television holds the possibility that the
choice of political candidates in the future
may depend somewhat on their physical
appearance. Thus the effect on politics.
Continuing further, if television empha-
sizes personal appearance, this will affect
those who concern themselves with per-
sonal appearance such as beauticians,
barbers, or dieticians.
Further, the social problems seem to
have a convergent effect, that is they add,
one upon the other, totaling a marked ef-
fect on our social behavior. In exemplify-
ing this, let us consider the development
of suburban residences. The automobile,
helicopter, and the super-highway, each a
product of the engineer, all contribute to
this suburban development. These in turn
cause the necessary introduction of tele-
phones, motion pictures, and chain stores,
for example, to the suburban area. The
rise in accident toll, disrupting forms of
competing transportation, excessive real
estate booms, public health, and housing
are but some of the problems which this
technologically caused suburban develop-
ment has brought about.
The previous examples only begin to
show in what way, or ways, the engineer
creates the social problems. In a more
general consideration, we can see that he
causes the problems either by inventing
a new article or by developing a new
process, thus usually changing our ma-
terial environment. These changes in
environment, however, are merely the
forces which start the ball rolling, as it
were. It is the necessary adaption of so-
ciety to this new environment which di-
rectly causes the social problems. We
know that it is not the product or proc-
ess itself, but the uses to which it is put
that determines its effects on society.
Correlating this, the manufacture of the
product also introduces varied problems.
Consider, for example, the health prob-
lems alone which have been initiated by
the use of atomic energy, new metallic
alloys, radioactivity, and supersonic vibra-
tions. Or note the vast social influence
which the use of electricity has made in
the manufacturing processes alone. Here
we can see clearly how such electrical de-
vices and processes as the electric motor,
electric generator, induction heating,
electrolytic plating, electronic control,
photoelectric cell, and the electromagnet
have revolutionized the social aspects of
labor and management. The worker is
faced with such problems as were men-
tioned earlier; that is, unemployment and
his reduction to a machine. If he main-
tains his position of employment, it means
that he must become a specialist—a cog in
the great machine. Also, he will undoubt-
edly have more leisure time on his hands
without being prepared for its use. The
effects on management, on the other hand,
of the use of electricity no doubt include
greater profits and the increase of avail-
able leisure time. These two effects are
certainly filled with serious social prob-
lems. As an illustration, James Douglas
relates this incident in connection with
the social problems caused by the use of
electricity:
... I met an American manufacturer
who told me that by introducing
electricity as a motive power from a
central station he had been able to
discharge five hundred workmen. I
asked him what had become of the
five hundred. His reply was that
there is plenty of vacant land in
America as well as vacant employ-
ment for them. Their future gave
him no concern, nor perhaps need it
have done so.1

In order that shorter landings may be
made on small airfields in advanced
combat areas, the U. S. Air Force's new
Martin XB-51 three-jet ground support
bomber, is equipped with a ribbon-type
parachute to speed deceleration. The
chute, 24 feet in diameter and extending
55 feet from its anchor hook at the rear
of the XB-51 's fuselage, is made of nylon,
with shrouds and risers, capable of with-
standing a pull of 52,200 pounds, of the
same material. A small pilot chute is re-
leased manually by the pilot after the jet
engine in the fuselage of the XB-51 is
stopped, and this pilot chute in turn pulls
the braking chute out of the special stow-
age compartment in the airplane.
smoothness and is best lubricated by
water, it has been shown to be an ideal
surface for skis," he explained.
"By actual tests, the Micarta-bottomed
skis—the first laminated plastic-bottomed
skis produced in this country—have
proved to be faster than the finest skis
made entirely of hickory."
Westinghouse plastics engineers at
Pittsburgh who recommended the material
for this newest application report that
Micarta is as strong as structural steel for
equal weights of cross-section and will
add greater strength to the natural hickory
to which it is bonded. The plastic is
lighter than aluminum for equal strength.
"It was the use of Micarta for ship pro-
peller shaft bearings that brought the ski
application to light," Mr. Davis said.
Faster Stops and Starts for the Air Force's newest bomber, the Martin XB-51,
give it great versatility for operations to and from smaller combat area fields or
landing strips. Two important design features are responsible. For take-offs in short
space, the XB-51 is equipped to use JATO (Jet-Assisted Take-Off) bottles, like the
two shown near the tail above. For landings, the new Martin bomber has a para-
chute stowed aft which may be released at the pilot's discretion for rapid deceleration.

"Made of layers of cloth saturated with a
synthetic resin and pressed under heat, the
plastic is lubricated by water—which
means a ski in constant contact with snow
and moisture becomes self-lubricating.
"This means not only more speed, but
also no necessity for waxing, except in
very wet snow conditions where snow
clings. The Micarta-bottomed skis, be-
cause of their toughness, need not be
sanded, regrooved, refinished or relac-
quered over years of normal service."
New Self-Lubricating Ski
Micarta, the same tough plastic used in
Army helmet liners during the war, now
promises to enable American ski cham-
pions to set new speed records.
Tyler B. Davis, president of the Ban-
croft Racket Company at Pawtucket, R. I.,
recently announced that his firm is mak-
ing a new "self-lubricating" ski with
bottoms made of Micarta, the laminated
plastic.
"Since Micarta has a high gloss and
Michigan Take Note
Despite unseasonably mild weather in
many industrial areas, several firms oper-
ating plants in the Middle 'West and New
England began use this winter of rust
inhibitor in conjunction with de-icing salt
spread on factory parking areas, intra-
plant roads, access roads and other priv-
ately maintained traffic ways.
A number of North American cities,
state, county and township highway and
street departments, and other public au-
thorities have employed the rust-inhibiting
material "Banox" with de-icing salt this
winter and last, according to field service
representatives of Calgon, Inc., Pitts-
burgh, which manufactures this additive.
However, a check of their records for the
current winter shows that several indus-
trial firms have joined the movement, ap-
parently on the theory that company-own-
ed vehicles operating entirely on plant
property, and employees cars, need this
rust protection.
Among industrial purchasers are an
aircraft-parts manufacturer, a textile ITU-
chinery firm, the operators of a stockyards
(18 miles of roads) and a variety of
others.
In the form of a dry powder, Banox is
added in a proportion of one part to 100
parts of de-icing salt (either calcium or
sodium chloride) and forms a thin, in-
visible yet flexible and protective rust-in-
hibitive film on auto fenders and under-
bodies when the melting snow and ice,
combined with the salt, form brine that is
splashed against the metal surfaces. Muni-
cipal users report that the Banox film
practically eliminates corrosive attack, al-
though it is harmless to tires, clothing, the
eyes and skin, and plant and animal life.

valuable research tool capable of meas-
uring the distance between atoms to an
accuracy of l/100th of a millionth of an
inch. By shooting radar waves through a
substance and measuring the remaining
power, it's possible to get results 1000
times more accurate than are possible with
the best optical instruments.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC

DEAN IVAN C. CRAWFORD
College of Engineering
University of Michigan
A centennial celebration for engineering at Michigan? Yes,
and in the relatively near future.
Civil engineering appears in the University catalogue for
1852-53, but no provision was made to give instruction. It
was not until 1854 that a professor was employed to teach the
subject—and he taught it in addition to several other more or
less unrelated subjects, such as zoology and geology. Neverthe-
less, this was the beginning of engineering instruction in state
universities of America.
On account of this approaching event it is not out of
place to review a few statistics that indicate how fully engi-
neering has achieved maturity at the University of Michigan
This may be judged to some extent by the ability of the school
to handle the heavy load of veterans following the end of
World War II. Under the abnormal conditions of the past few
years all schools opened their doors to the widest possible extent
with the result that extraordinary large classes have graduated in
the past two years. The College of Engineering has carried a
full load, and so doing has offered opportunity to hundreds of
veterans.
From the standpoint of Bachelor's Degrees alone, the
institutions granting the largest number of such degrees in
1947-48 were as follows:
Purdue 1,383 California University 943
M.I.T. 958 Illinois University 833
Michigan University 786
In Master's Degrees, institutions were ranked as follows:
M.I.T. 418 Michigan University 377
Editor's Note—Dean Crawford is » graduate of the
University of Colorado; he received a B.S. in C.E. de-
gree in 1912 and a C.E. degree in 1915. In 1944 he
received an honorary D.Sc. degree from the University
of Colorado. Dean Crawford has been at the University
of Michigan since July, 1940.
Harvard

In enrollment of undergraduate students, Michigan ranked
tenth in the nation for a number of years. It is interesting to
compare this enrollment situation with the number of Bachelor's
Degrees and Master's Degrees given above.
The total number of engineering degrees, Bachelors', Mas-
ters' and Doctors', granted for the academic year 1947-48 by the
University of Michigan totaled 1171. Purdue headed the
country with 1452, M.I.T. came second with 1410, leaving
Michigan in third place.
The number of students enrolled is another method by
which the College may be appraised. Prior to World War II
the maximum numbers in attendance were 2250 undergraduates
and 250 graduates. Following the war the enrollment ran to a
total of 4693, 4178 undergraduates, and 575 graduate students.
Enrollments are now shrinking and will continue to do so for
the next two or three years. This situation is to be expected
because the veterans are graduating in large numbers.
But the real measure of the College's stature is the profes-
sional records of the approximately fifteen thousand Michigan
alumni and faculty members from the days of DeVolson Wood
to the present.
Measured by any appropriate yard stick, the answer is the
same: the College of Engineering at the University of Michi-
gan has completed a century of achievement which justifies an
extensive celebration.

OF MOTOR OIL
From the standpoint of the consumer,
oil consumption tends to be the chief
"yardstick" by which oil quality is judged.
The amount of oil added between cus-
tomary crankcase drains is the most read-
ily apparent performance standard insofar
as the average user is concerned. Oils hav-
ing low consumption are popularly re-
garded as more desirable and superior to
oils having high consumption tendencies.
For this reason, Pennsylvania motor oils
are so highly regarded by motorists be-
cause they inherently possess low con-
sumption characteristics in all types of
engines. The problems concerning oil
consumption are quite complex and in-
volve a number of factors which are re-
viewed here briefly.
Causes of Oil Consumption
The amount or rate of oil consumption
in any given engine may depend on a
variety of factors as itemized in Table I.
Excessive oil consumption is very often
caused by wear or mechanical defects in
the engine which cannot be affected ap-
preciably by oil, regardless of what oil
might be used. In many instances high
oil consumption is not from loss of oil by
burning in the combustion chambers, but
results from simple leakage. Defective
gaskets or worn crankshaft seals are good
examples. Another cause of oil loss,
which is often manifested by a sudden
apparent jump in consumption, is a crack-
ed or leaking diaphragm in the fuel
vacuum booster pump. In some instances
oil loss is so rapid that the crankcase is
depleted of oil and engine damage occurs
before the condition is noticed. Where
an engine suddenly develops very high oil
consumption, an immediate check of the
fuel pump is suggested. Overfilling of
engine crankcase is another prevalent
cause of high oil consumption.
However, engine or vehicle speed prob-
ably has a greater effect on oil consump-
tion tendencies than any other single
factor. Increasing the average driving
speed from 20 to 60 miles per hour may
cause consumption increases from 2 to 10
fold. As a typical example, the shop
manual of one car manufacturer mentions
that increasing average driving speed
from 30 to 60 miles per hour may increase
BY
EMIL EBNER, '50ChE
oil consumption some 2y2 times; and in
going from 20 to 80 miles per hour, con-
sumption may be 5 times as great. But, as
is illustrated later, the increase in con-
sumption due to high speeds will be less
with Pennsylvania oils than with non-
Pennsylvania oils.
Yet high oil consumption may result
from physical deficiencies in the oil. These
deficiencies are more readily noticed in
engines which are in good mechanical
condition where in oil losses from me-
chanical defects do not tend to mask out
possible differences between oils. The
properties of motor oils which have the
greatest effect on consumption tendencies
(volatility, viscosity, and Viscosity In-
dex) are very difficult to isolate and study
separately, since they are to a very large
extent interdependent. Oils of high nat-
ural Viscosity Index possess superior en-
gine lubrication and consumption proper-
ties because they thin out less and retain
their body better at the very high operat-
ing temperatures developed at the pistons,
rings, valves and bearings of engines.
Table I
Causes of Oil Consumption
Mechanical Defects
Pis/on Conditions: Worn ring grooves,
collapsed skirts.
Piston Ring Condition: Worn, loss of
tension, excessively tight or loose fit in
grooves, compression rings stuck, or
oil rings plugged.
Cylinder Wall Condition: Worn, dis-
torted, or scored.
Valve Condition: Worn valve guides or
stems. Excessive oil supply to valve
mechanism.
Bearing Condition: Worn or loose
bearings allowing excessive oil throw-
off to cylinder walls.
Leaks: Gaskets improperly seated, defec-
tive or broken. Worn or defective shaft
seals. Loose plumbing on oil filter and
exterior oil lines. Excessive crankcase
pressure. Excessive crankcase ventila-
tion or defective vent pipe.
Fuel Pump: Leaking diaphragm in fuel-
vacuum booster pump. Defective fuel
pump-drive arm seal.
Maintenance Defects
Overfilling of Crankcase: Too high oil
level, causing excessive splashing and
throw-off on cylinder walls.
Excessive Fuel Dilution of Crankcase Oil:
Low engine jacket and crankcase tem-
peratures.
Operating Conditions
Engine Speeds High engine or vehicle
speeds oil properties.
Volatility: Oil containing excessive por-
tion of volatile constituents.
Viscosity: Oil of inadequate viscosity for
the engine operating speeds and tem-
peratures.
Viscosity Index: Excessive "thinning out'
of the oil on exposure to elevated tem-
peratures.
Oil Consumption Tests
In order to present factual evidence of
the superior consumption characteristics
of Pennsylvania motor oils, typical con-
sumption data from a variety of engines
under different types of test and service
conditions are summarized and reviewed
briefly in the tables that follow. Con-
sumption figures are reported as Con-
sumption Ratios rather than in miles per
quart, since different engines as well as
different types of operating conditions de-
velop quite different basic consumption
patterns. In all of the work the reference
test oil was a Pennsylvania SAE 10
grade having a viscosity of 48 seconds
Saybolt at 210 F. The consumption of
this test oil in each engine was regarded
as the basic consumption value, and the
consumption of other oils in the same
engine was then related thereto in terms
of Consumption Ratio.
Oil Viscosity and Consumption
Table II summarizes typical results of
engine and road tests to evaluate the effect
of oil viscosity on consumption tendencies.
All of the oils were high quality Penn-
sylvania so that the factors of Viscosity
Index and volatility were substantially
similar. The only major differences were
in their respective viscosities. As shown,
oil consumption decreases with increase
of viscosity. Thus the SAE 20 grade con-

Three goals of an engineering educa-
tion are (1) a sound theoretical and
mathematical understanding of the physi-
cal sciences, (2) a broad cultural back-
ground, and (3) a realistic knowledge of
industry. With the aid of university class-
rooms individual effort may accomplish
the first two objectives, but the achieve-
ment of the third is usually beyond indi-
vidual academic endeavor. Unless the 4-
year engineering student obtains summer
employment or has had pre-scholastic ex-
perience, his practical industrial knowl-
edge may not exist.
To remedy this deficiency student engi-
neering groups organize field trips to local
industries and invite speakers from the
outside industrial world. To further its
goal of introducing the student to the
practical side of engineering, the U of M
Branch of the AIEE-IRE has organized
an extended field trip through the heart
of the industrial eastern United States.
Seven carefully chosen plants will be
visited, diversely covering the entire elec-
tric manufacturing, communication, and
power-generating industries . The trip is
scheduled to coincide with the Spring

SELIG GERTZIS
Vacation and has been planned for rec-
reational as well as educational purposes
in keeping with the vacation mood.
Moreover, the cost of the trip is so low
as to be within every budget. Total bus
fare will be $25. Eight night's lodging at
$15 will limit expenses to $40, exclud-
ing food and entertainment. It is expect-

ed that total costs including meals and
relaxation will not exceed $70, a nominal
figure indeed for an eight day trip in-
cluding two days in New York.
The vacation and education-bound elec-
trical students are scheduled to leave Ann
Arbor Friday afternoon, April 7. Arriv-
ing at Niagara Falls, Ontario that eve-
ning, they will visit the hydro plant of the
Hydro-Electric Power Commission of
Ontario on Saturday. This is the first
day of the spring recess. After an evening
free to gaze at the splendors of the Falls,

officials declared that they have so much
to show that two days would be required.

INTRODUCTION
The sound laboratory of the University
of Michigan is well equipped to measure
the operating noise of mechanical devices.
The equipment is used as an aid in the
process of reducing or eliminating ob-
jectionable noises in such articles as wash-
ing machines, vacuum cleaners and adding
machines. It is the purpose of this article
to describe the equipment for this work,
and to illustrate its use.
The important components of sound
measuring equipment are (1) anechoic
chamber, so constructed that no external
noise can penetrate it, (2) a very stable
microphone, connected to (3) a calibrated
amplifier whose frequency response is
comparable to that of the human ear.
Necessary auxiliary equipment includes
an oscillograph and camera, used for de-
tailed study of the noise waveform.
The solution of a typical noise problem
requires that (1) reference sound level
readings be taken, (2) that, with the aid
of oscillating tape, the machine be
modified in such a way as to reduce its
loudness, and (3) that the loudness be re-
evaluated to determine the amount of the
reduction. Finally, the results must then
be checked by restoring the machine to its
original condition and rechecking the
reference loudness.
It is hoped that this discussion will
make clear both the makeup and the
capabilities of the sound measuring equip-
ment, and also the procedures followed in
its use.
The sound measuring equipment in
use at the University of Michigan will
be described in the first section of this
report. This will include comments on
the test chamber, microphone, sound
level meter and oscillographic camera.
Finally, the application of the equipment
to a typical noise problem will be con-
sidered. All basic steps will be covered,
including the establishment of a refer-
ence, modification of the mechanism and
evaluation and verification of the results.
DESCRIPTION OF NOISE
MEASURING EQUIPMENT
The Anechoic Chamber
Two requirements must be met by the
test chamber if accurate sound analyses
EDITORS NOTE
The elimination of noise from machin-
ery is of major importance to industry
today not only from the viewpoint of
more harmonious interoperation of ma-
chine parts but also for the psychological
comfort of the operating personnel. The
terms "quiet" and "efficient" have be-
come practically synonymous as applied
to machinery. Noise distracts the worker,
prevents him from concentrating on his
task, and by hastening fatigue reduces
output.
The Randall Sound Laboratory, under
the supervision of Dr. Paul H. Geiger, is
one of the few laboratories in the nation
where acoustic analyses are conducted
and specifications for correction made.
One of the results of the laboratory's
work familiar to all of us is the relative
quietness of the postwar automobile as
compared to earlier models. Specifica-
tions for the design of an automobile
suspension system to reduce noise were
drawn up in the Randall Sound Labora-
tory.
are to be made: (1) no external noises
must be allowed to penetrate the cham-
ber, and (2) the wall, floor and ceiling
surfaces must reflect as little as possible of
the sound energy that strikes them.
The first requirement is best satisfied
by constructing an isolated building to
house the test room. The location chosen
should be well removed from all sources
of vibration such as truck routes, railroads
and heavy machinery whose vibrations
might be conducted through the earth to
the foundation of the test room. Ex-
ternal airborne sounds may be eliminated
by constructing the chamber with double
walls and roof of brick or concrete; the
inner and outer shells being separated
by an air space.
Lining the inner surfaces of the test
room with a sound absorbing blanket of
fiberglass or heavy felt, will satisfy the
second requirement mentioned. Thus
lined, the characteristics of the room
boundaries will approach those of free
space in that only a very small portion
of incident sound energy will be re-
flected back into the room.
The necessity for eliminating external
noises from the test chamber is clear
when it is realized that any sound in the
room will be registered as coming from
the device under test. In connection with
the "dead" room boundaries, it may be
said that reflection of incident sound
would result in the establishment of a
standing wave pattern in the room. Under
these conditions the position of the meas-
uring microphone would be extremely
critical, as the sound pressure at any given
point might vary at a point a few feet
away. It would be very difficult to repro-
duce measurements if this situation
existed.
The Microphone
While making sound level measure-
ments, it is desirable that no personnel
should remain in the test chamber, lest
they create some extraneous noises. There-
fore a microphone is used to pick up the
sounds under investigation and the cable
from this unit is led to an adjacent area
where the rest of the measuring equip-
ment is located.
The microphone used has very stable
characteristics of sensitivity and frequency
response with varying temperature, hu-
midity and age. It is essential that its
frequency response be known with con-
siderable accuracy as will be shown.
The Sound Level Meter
The output of the test microphone is
fed to a special amplifier, known as a
sound level meter. This unit is so con-
structed that its frequency response, in
conjunction with the frequency response
of the microphone, closely corresponds to
that of the human ear. It is known from
experiment that the ear judges tones of
unequal pitch as unequal in loudness even
when their sound pressure levels are alike.
For example, this difference in response
is particularly obvious for sounds of low
frequency, where it takes a much greater
sound pressure level to produce a sensa-
tion of a given loudness than is required
at higher frequencies. It is clear, then,
that weighting networks must be built
into the sound level meter (hereafter re-
ferred to as the SLM) which will cause
its output to drop off toward both the
upper and lower limits of human audi-
bility.
The output of the SLM is registered
on a meter calibrated in decibels. By
American standards, the reference sound
level (zero db indication) is taken as
.0002 dynes per square centimeter at the
microphone. This figure corresponds to
12
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


human ear, and the gain of the SLM is
adjusted accordingly. The indication of
the output meter represents an average
sound pressure over a period of time, be-
cause the inertia of the meter movement
prevents it from following rapid varia-
tions in noise. Thus a series of impulsive
sounds would yield an indication corre-
sponding to their average and not their
maximum amplitude. When a true indi-
cation of such impulsive sounds is desired,
it is necessary to resort to auxiliary equip-
ment, which will now be described.
The Oscillographic Camera
It is possible to bypass the output meter
of the SLM, and feed the output signal
through a second amplifier and thence to
the horizontal plates of a cathode ray
tube. This second amplifier is necessary
only for voltage gain, and must have a flat
frequency response. The frequency
weighting networks of the SLM are, of
course, still effective.
This equipment, will cause the weight-
less beam of the cathode ray tube to trace
a spot of light on the tube screen which
shifts horizontally in exact compliance
with the variations in sound pressure at
the microphone. If now the moving spot
is focused on photographic film and the
film is moved in a vertical direction a
record is obtained on which the shape and
relative amplitude of the various noise
pulses are clearly indicated. Their dura-
tion and repetition rate may be calculated
if the speed at which the film is moved
is known.
It must be stressed that with the photo-
graphic method of noise analysis, no ac-
curate quantitative measure of loudness
is obtainable. However, when a specific
loudness peak on the photographic trace
is reduced, a check can be made with the
SLM to determine the effect on the over-
all loudness of the mechanism under test.
The second part of this report describes
the application of the equipment men-
tioned above to the solution of a practical
noise problem. This discussion should
make clear the procedures to be followed,
and also the capabilities and limitation of
the equipment.
APPLICATION OF EOUIPMENT TO A
TYPICAL NOISE PROBLEM
One problem brought to the sound
laboratory at the University of Michigan
has involved quieting the adding ma-
chines of a certain manufacturer. The
following is a discussion of one phase of
this investigation, including the steps
taken in the use of the equipment de-
scribed earlier in this report.
Establishing a Reference
At the beginning of each phase of the
work, the following steps are taken:
Warmup: The machine is placed on a
table in the center of the test chamber,
and operated until it reaches its full speed
and temperature. At the same time all
measuring equipment (SLM, auxiliary am-
plifier and cathode ray tube) is turned
on and allowed to reach a stable tem-
perature.
Calibration: Next the SLM is cali-
brated by injecting a test signal (from a
standard oscillator) whose amplitude is
exactly equal to the output of the micro-
phone at the "O db" level of .0002 dynes/
cm2 sound pressure. With this signal
applied, the SLM gain is adjusted until
the output meter reads "O db." This ad-
justment, periodically repeated, prevents
any slow drift in SLM sensitivity due to
aging of its power supply batteries, and
serves as an over-all check on the opera-
tion of the equipment. Calibration of the
scope amplifier is unnecessary as it is not
intended for use as a quantitative meas-
uring device.
First Sound Level Readings: The next
step is to take a preliminary set of sound
level readings. A "set" of readings con-
sists of 2 groups of 8 readings each. Be-
tween each reading, the microphone is
advanced 45 degrees around a horizontal
circle at whose center the adding machine
is situated. The purpose of this procedure
is threefold:
1. To include, by measuring the noise
of the adding machine from a number of
angles, any directional characteristics of
the sound.
2. To average, by taking a total of 16
readings, the human error in reading the
output meter.
3. To eliminate a loudness drift, un-
less corresponding readings of the first
and second groups of 8 measurements are
nearly equal.
First Oscillographic Tape: The last pre-
liminary step is to feed the output of the
SLM through the auxiliary amplifier to
the oscillographic tube and photograph
the moving spot.
A complete set of data has now been
obtained on the noise of the adding ma-
chine in its present condition, both pic-
torially on the photographic tape, and
quantitatively in the average sound level
reading figure.
Modification of the Mechanism
The oscillographic tape shows a high
amplitude "thump" at "A." It is plan-
ned to reduce this thump in an attemp to
eliminate excessive noise from the ma-
chine.
Correlation of Tape with Machine Mo-
tion: By watching the tape while operat-
ing the adding machine slowly and ob-
serving the motion of its various parts,
it is possible to determine what piece of
mechanism is responsible for the noise
at "A."
Modification Procedure: The next step
is to find some means of eliminating or
reducing the noise caused by the trouble-
some moving part. (For example, a rub-
ber pad can be placed so as to absorb the
impact of the moving part.) As a check
on progress while various corrective meas-
ures are being tried, more oscillographic
tapes are taken and compared with the
first. Success will be indicated by the
reduction or disappearance of the noise
clump at "A" on these later tapes.
This part of the work, the actual modi-
fication of the mechanism to obtain a
noise reduction, often requires consider-
able time. Perhaps a dozen or more alter-
ations will be made before good results
are obtained, and ingenuity and perse-
verence are the keys to success. The
method of attack depends entirely on the
mechanism in question.
Measuring the Noise Reduction
Suppose that a certain successful altera-
tion has resulted in the elimination of the
noise club at "A." Results can be eval-
uated. The quantitative measuring device,
the sound level meter, is used for this
purpose.
Preliminary Steps: The previously de-
scribed routine of positioning the adding
machine on the table and of warmup and
calibration of the SLM must now be re-
peated. Extreme accuracy is important in
making these preparations, because the
first and second sets of sound level read-
ings must vary only by an amount equal
to the actual reduction in noise output of
the adding machine.
Second Sound Level Reading: A new
set of sound level readings is next taken,
exactly as described above. The noise re-
duction due to our modification may now
be isolated by subtracting the second from
the first, or reference, sound level read-
ing. This difference figure is the measure
of success.
Checking the Results
On a project of this kind, it is never
safe to stop work at this point. Thus
there has been no check on the accuracy

BEN R. MARSH, '08E
Owosso, Michigan finally scores, as
native son Ben Marsh becomes the new
president of the Detroit Athletic Club.
Ben was an Owossoan through his high
school days, punctuating the latter with
summers spent "smashing baggage" at the
Lakeview Hotel on Mackinac Island.
Graduating from the U. of M. with
a B.S. in electrical engineering in 1908,
Ben bowed into the telephone business
that same year as a subscribers' represen-
tative with the Michigan State Telephone
Company. Back in those days, the system
boasted 32,000 telephones; today more
than 900,000 instruments are busy con-
necting Detroit with points all over the
world. Ben Marsh today is vice-president
and general manager of Michigan Bell.
In the intervening years, with the ex-
ception of one spent in South Bend, he
has been with the company continuously
both in Detroit and other parts of the
state.
Ben's main hobby is his job, but for
occasional contrast you're apt to find him
fly-fishing, hunting or golfing. In addi-
tion, he's a director of the Standard Acci-
dent Insurance Company, the Boy Scouts
of America, and the Detroit Board of
Commerce; chairman of the Detroit board
of the Federal Reserve System of Chicago;
and a member of Rotary, Detroit Club,
Lochmoor, and the Pere Marquette Rod
and Gun Club.
HERSCHEL C. SMITH,
'13, 'I5E, M.S.E.'21
Herschel C. Smith has twofold reason
to remember December of 1949. On the
eighteenth of that month he observed his
sixtieth anniversary of birth in Jackson
County, Missouri, and twenty-four hours
later he was elected President of a group
of firms which represent one of the na-
tion's most important petroleum enter-
prises. On December 19 he became Presi-
dent of the American Oil Company, the
Mexican Petroleum Corporation, and
Lord Baltimore Filling Stations, Inc. The
companies market a complete line of pe-
troleum products, manufactured by asso-
ciated companies with refineries in Mary-
land, Georgia and Texas, in the area cov-
ering the states on the Atlantic Seaboard
from Maine to Florida. The new presi-
dent took a circuitious route to the class-
rooms of the University which he later re-
visited in different capacities. He at-
tended high school in Independence,
Missouri, long before that community
achieved its present prominence in the na-
tional news spotlight, then moved to
Phoenix, Arizona, where he completed
his high school work. Following gradua-
tion he enrolled in the University with
the Literary Class of 1913 and attained his
Bachelor of Arts degree. Then he
promptly turned to the engineering cur-
riculum and two years later took a degree
HERSCHEL C. SMITH
from the College of Engineering. During
both phases of his campus academic life,
he was active in student activities, par-
ticipating in the first period as a member
of the varsity track team (threw the shot,
discus and hammer and his class football
teams, and later as a member of Web and
Flange, Vulcans, and Tau Beta Pi. He
left the University with his two degrees
in 1915 and accepted an appointment as
Instructor of Engineering at the Univer-
sity of Oklahoma. After one year he be-
came Oklahoma's Deputy State Engineer,
then later entered the consulting engi-
neer's business in Oklahoma City. In
1920 he returned to Ann Arbor to study
for a Master's Degree and the following
year accepted an appointment as Assis-
tant Professor of Engineering on the
University faculty. He engaged in educa-
tional work with the Asphalt Association
from 1923 to 1926 and then joined the
group of companies which he now heads
as President. In 1932 he was elevated to
Manager of Asphalt Division with re-
sponsibility for the direction of sale\
research, technical development, crude
selection and general distribution of the
heavy petroleum products in the area the
companies serve. Two-and-a-half yean
ago he was elected to the post of Vice-
President in Charge of Sales and Director
of the American Oil Company and its two
subsidiaries. His office is in the Chanin
Building, 122 East 42nd Street, New
York City, and his home address is 41
Calumet Avenue, Hastings-on-the-Hud
son, New York.
RICHARD M. ADAMS, '49E
Richard M. Adams, '49E, has joined
the technical staff of the Langley Aero-
nautical Laboratory at Langley Field near
Hampton, Virginia. The Langley Labora-
tory, operated by the federal government s
National Advisory Committee for Aero-
nautics, is one of the largest aeronautical
research centers in the world. Mr. Adams,
an aeronautical engineer, will be engaged
in scientific research relating to loads im-
posed on aircraft in flight, which has an
important bearing on the safe operation
of transport aircraft and very high speed
aircraft capable of supersonic flight.
During the war, Mr. Adams served in
the Air Force as a multi-engine pilot and
aerial navigator in the European Theater
of Operations. He attained the rank of
First Lieutenant. After the war, he at-
tended the U. of M. where he received a
Bachelor of Science degree in aeronautical
engineering in August of 1949. While in
school, he was a member of the Sigma
Alpha Epsilon social fraternity and the
student chapter of the Institute of Aero-
nautical Sciences.
MARSHALL ANDERSON,

Coming cleaner
Such quick easy CLEANING . . . practically no scrubbing
... no fading of colors ... no irritation for tender skins-
sounds like a new and better soap, doesn't it? But it isn't
soap at all!
Now you can have a modern cleaner that removes dirt
with unbelievable speed, yet is completelv mild to the skin
and to the sheerest fabrics. Modern cleaners carrv the dirt
j
away with them, and form no ring in the dishpan or tub.
These new cleaners are made from organic chemicals.
They are scientifically prepared to work cquallv well in
soft, hard, even salt water.
For washing dishes or clothes, for housecleaning, for in-
dustrial uses, better cleaners are here right now—and thev
are improving every dav.
Today's modern synthetic detergents are not soaps . . .
they are entirely different chemically, and work in a dif-
ferent manner.
The people of Union Carbide have a hand in making
many of the organic chemicals that go into these modern,
efficient cleaners. Producing better materials for science and
industrv—to aid in meeting the demand for better things
and better performance—is the work of Union Carbide.

the idea that the engineer has little or no
need for a library, teach and practice the
principle that if the student of Engineer-
ing masters only his text book and class
work he will be successful in his profes-
sion. Moreover, history can show that
such a principle has been successful in
many instances. Successful engineers have
been produced from mere text book edu-
cation, yet the truly thoughtful student
and administrator of Engineering edu-
cation is tempted to say, "How much
more helpful they would have been if
they had consulted the library and its
records of civilization's progress." Many
times men have worked secretly and pa-
tiently on ideas they considered original
only to find on the completion of their
plans, that others before them had al-
ready solved their problem. There are a
great many reasons why engineers and all
people should use a library; these may be
summed up in the following: to learn
what has been accomplished, what is be-
ing accomplished, what objectives the na-
tion's engineers have in the immediate
offing, and how they intend to accomplish
them.

Along about this time of the semester,
with a rough one behind us and a similar
one ahead, it is only natural for one to
stop and "take stock" of what he has
accomplished and what he has yet to do.
The trouble with most of us is that we
attempt to fool ourselves, as well as
others. It is an old game. The trouble
with that, in turn, is that we are often
better at fooling ourselves than we are at
fooling others. This makes us feel that
justice has died an emphatic death—in
our own case.
Well, before we get all excited about
this thing, suppose we stop and figure out
just what the purpose of all this mathe-
matical and theoretical treadmill is. Cor-
rect me if I am wrong.
Primarily, we are attempting to in-
crease our value to others. Specifically,
those "others" are our future employers
and the ones who will be dependent upon
us for the niceties and necessities of life.
Ultimately, of course, we are attempting
to increase our value to ourselves—but
that primary step must come first. In the
field of work which most of you readers
have chosen, it is essential that basic
theory be understood, not memorized.
That is the difference between the me-
chanic and the engineer. Further, it is es-
sential that mathematics be understood if
these basic theories are to be of any real
value. Therein lies the difference betwen
the good engineer and the engineer.

Have you ever watched a column of
soldiers marching on a long hike? Sel-
dom do they know their destination. And
always their eyes are cast downward.
They only see what is directly ahead and
plot their progress by the cloud-slow pas-

How much are you facing life like a
hiking soldier? Do you see only the exam
tomorrow, dance next week-end, vacation
approaching? Are your eyes looking
down on the steadily passing days, weeks,
months?
It is about time you looked up. See
what you desire in the way of a job.
Plan avocations to add spice to your liv-
ing. Guess at the family life you would
enjoy. For if you provide no destination
for your life, how will your downcast eyes
see it when you arrive?
Perhaps a company presidency would
no more bring you happiness than a day
laborer's job. But the independence and
variation of a consulting engineer's work
might seem ideal. Then find out the
steps to climb in reaching a consultant's

Co-operative education affords the best
technical training obtainable, for co-oper-
ation bridges the gap between engineering
practice and the requirements of sound
engineering education. Industry, primar-
ily concerned with results, often criticizes
the colleges for graduating men with an
unduly theoretical approach. However, a
four-year college program must necessarily
emphasize theory in order that the student
receive a sufficiently broad and funda-
mental professional background. College
laboratory experiments can but imper-
fectly co-ordinate the conflicting demands
of practical application and theoretioi
education, for experiments tend to be
weak and somewhat artificial shadows of
industrial processes. In addition, college
laboratories cannot keep pace with the
rapid advances of industrial technology.
The college graduate must therefore ex-
pect to serve an engineering apprentice-
ship in order that he become accustomed
to the pace and methods of industry. Un-
fortunately, during this acclimatizing
period much of the abstract theory may
slip from his grasp through lack of use
and imperfect assimilation, for a funda-
mental principle of the learning process is
that abstractions must be applied if they
are to be understood and retained. Al-
though industry, the college, and the stu-
dent are apparently faced with a formid-
able dilemma, co-operative education
makes possible having the educational
cake as well as eating it.

$2,500,000 a year!
Both hands hold terminations used in tele-
phone dial switching equipment. They look
pretty much alike — but let's see about that!
The termination at left is made by the old
method. Insulation is stripped off the wire.
The wire is twisted around the brass terminal,
then fastened to it with a soldering iron. That
had to be done on millions and millions of
connections each year.
The termination at right is made by a new
machine process developed by engineers at
Western Electric—manufacturing unit of the
igmeers
Western
Bell System. One type of machine separates
the brass connectors from a "strip" and accu-
rately positions each on an insulator to which
groups of 10 are fastened by eyeleting. An-
other machine places 20 wires in the proper
position on two sets of 10 connectors, drives
two small pyramidal shaped points through
the insulation into the wire and crimps the
brass around the wire, making a good, solid
electrical connection. The whole job now is
done in one-tenth the time.
This improvement will add $2,500,000 a
year to the vast amount Western Electric
engineers are saving the Bell Telephone Sys-
tem through manufacturing economies. Year
after year they look for — and find — ways to
make telephone equipment better and at lower
cost. Their savings help Bell Telephone com-
panies to keep rates as low as they are.

Engine Block Cleaning
Through the application of a special
process for the internal cleaning of engine
blocks, Ford Motor Company has practi-
cally ruled out the possibility of engine
trouble developing due to inadequate
block cleaning, Logan Miller, general
manager, Rouge Division, said.
The process employs a new shot blast
cleaning machine that is the first of its
kind in the automotive industry. It
guarantees additional protection against
core sand remaining in the internal cylin-
der block water passages.

New Method for Cleaning Engine Blocks.
The new pressure blast machine supple-

to remove burnt core and molding sand
and scale from interior and exterior sur-
faces of the motor block casting.
Ford ultimately plans to equip each of
the production foundry's motor block
cleaning systems with the new compressed
air blast cabinets.
The installation provides the latest
known means of insuring removal of core
and foreign material left inside the block
following casting.
Possibility of obstructions developing
in water circulation, thereby creating
faulty or broken cylinder blocks in cars
during operation is minimized.
The new blasting technique works this
way: Motor blocks to be blasted are
cooling water circulated from the radiator.
The material used in the blast process
consists of iron or steel shot and grit.
The air blast equipment operates automati-
cally, the blast period being controlled by
an automatic timer.
As a result of this efficient internal
cleaning, water passages in the block are
smooth and free from flow interferences
and result in cooler operation of the
engine, particularly at heavy loads.
Engineering in Hospitals
A supersensitive instrument that can
measure minute changes in the blood's
oxygen content or the cooling rate of steel
during quenching has been developed by
General Motors Research Laboratories.
The research objective was to perfect a
device that would measure direct current
signals as faint as a few hundredths of i.
microvolt, as task ordinarily performed by
a sensitive galvanometer.
The galvanometer's biggest drawback
was its extreme sensitivity to vibration
which confined its use to sub-basements or
other vibration-free locations. The GM
Research amplifier can be handled virtu-
ally like a portable radio and operates al-
most anywhere with undisturbed stability,
even in an automobile or airplane.
Already the amplifier has become a ser-
vant of the operating room anesthestist.
as a result of collaboration between GM
Research, Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit,
and other medical research groups.
The amplifier is linked with the photo-
cells of an instrument known as the
oxyhemograph.
This instrument records directly the per
cent oxygen saturation of the hemoglobin
of the blood stream. Its operating prin-
ciple is based on the fact that there is a
change in light transmission between oxy-
dized and reduced hemoglobin.
Light from a small lamp is directed
through a thin section of flesh, the pinna
(external part) of the ear, and falls on
two photocells in opposition. There is a
red filter in front of one cell and a green
cell in front of the other.
The cell back of the green filter re-
sponds to changes in tissue thickness and
changes in total volume of blood; while
the cell back of the red filter responds to
these volume variables, as they are called,
as well as to changes in oxygen saturation
of the blood.
Thus, the different signal developed
here and applied to the amplifier is pro-
portional to the blood oxygen saturation.
It warns the anesthestist when the pa-
tient's blood ration drops or rises and en-
ables him to control it by glancing at a
recording graph next to the operating
table. Already tested on Ford Hospital
surgical patients, this technique automati-
cally informs the anesthestist what he
formerly learned by watching a patient's
color, pulse, breathing rate and blood
pressure.
To the surgeon operating on a hospital
patient, the signal on the amplifier indi-
cates instantly how well the patient re-
sponds to certain types of heart surgery.

Some rooms accommodate grand
pianos; a small spinet is right for
others. Until recently, much the same
rule held true for television receivers.
Your choice of screen sizes was largely
governed by room space.
Now the space problem has been
whipped by RCA scientists, who have
shortened the length of 16-inch television
"picture tubes" more than 20%! All the
complex inner works—such as the sensi-
tive electron gun that "paints" pictures on
the screen —have been redesigned to op-
erate at shorter focus, wider angle. Even
a new type of faceplate glass, Filterglass,
has been developed for RCA's 16-inch
picture tubes—on principles first investi-
gated for television by RCA.
Filterglass, incorporating a light-absorbing
material, improves picture quality by cut-
ting down reflected room light .. . and by re-
ducing reflections inside the glass faceplate
of the kinescope tube itself. Result: richer,
deeper black areas and greater contrast in
the television picture!

This last statement by Mr. Douglas
gives rise to an important question which
now faces us. Why must the engineer
concern himself with the solutions of
these social problems which he has
created? In the first place, we see that
the engineer, as no other, holds an inti-
mate knowledge of the primary cause of
the problem. That is, he alone knows
thoroughly the technical development he
has created. Perhaps Colonel Prout ex-
pressed this aspect of the engineer's re-
sponsibility best when he made the fol-
lowing statement: "My proposition is
that the engineer, more than all other
men, will guide humanity forward until
we come to some other period of a dif-
ferent kind." 2
Secondly, the engineer must maintain
his own social and professional status. In
this connection, he should prepare himself
for the public's ultimate realization that
his is not a completely beneficial agency,
but that it has been an important factor in
building the social complexities of today.
In addition, his professional status is
greatly endangered by his disregard for
the problems which he has created. For,
as M. L. Cooke said, "... the prominence
of the public interest may well be a domi-
nant test [as to what justifies professional
status,] for professional status is apt to
be quite meaningless unless accompanied
by a recognition of social obligation." 3
The engineer should also realize, as a
third reason for his interest, that techno-
logical progress must be accompanied by
social progress. Dr. Jackson illustrates
this problem by the use of the following
analogy:
However perfect a coin may appear
on one face, if it is suffering from
corrosion on the other face it is de-
fective and needs reminting. Social
reminting in an engineering world
with its democratic qualities, how-
ever, requires a depth of considera-
tion and range of cautious adjust-
ment which immeasurably transcend
the requirements for the machine-
reminting of coins.4
The problem of equal advancement of
technology and society is chiefly a problem
of efficiency, a term with which the engi-
neer, perhaps more than any other man,
is familiar.
Lastly, in viewing the situation with a
broader outlook, we find that not only
(Continued from page 7)
the engineer's future, but indeed the fu-
ture security and welfare of the world
may depend on the success of his attempts
in solving the problems. He must realize
the facts put forth by Dr. Jackson when
he said, "Engineering plays a strong part
in meeting fundamental human aspira-
tions. It is a human and intellectual af-
fair. It deals with forces and materials
provided by nature, and adapts them to
human service for the satisfaction of hu-
man needs and aspirations as they are felt
manufacturer puts the excess profits he
derives as a result of technological im-
provements in his company's manufactur-
ing processes. Nor can the engineer de-
cide for the worker exactly how his lei-
sure time should be spent. Obviously
these are problems of the sociologist and
the economist. As Flanders points out.
the selfish and doctrinaire political econ-
omy, the darker side of our general hu-
man nature, and the apathy of the public
which could protect itself if it would.

Photo Courtcny of Better Road* Magazi
Super-highways, such as the Edsel B. Ford Expressway shown above, contribute to
the decentralization of population.
in each particular period, and in our
period all commerce depends deeply on
engineering." 5 In this connection, Mr.
Flanders quotes the editor of the London
Engineer on this aspect of the problem,
in saying, ". . . the benefits which the
works of the engineer confer will be over-
shadowed by the nuisances that accom-
pany them, unless . . . engineers them-
selves are the fir'st to recognize the defects
and the first and most eager to remove
them." 6
We cannot help but realize, in consid-
ering the foregoing reasons for the engi-
neer's interest, that there are certain im-
portant limitations on his ability to solve
the problems. Certainly we should con-
clude that not all of the social effects of
the engineer's work are really his fault.
For example, the engineer cannot deter-
mine in any way the use to which the
all must share the blame for the existing
social evils.
In general, these limitations are forced
upon the engineer by the complex factors
of human will and spirit, so that these
also must be reckoned with in the so-
lutions. Consider, along this line, the
influences, positive and negative, on the
decentralization of residences and indus-
tries. The positive factors are chiefly
direct effects of engineering develop-
ments, such as the helicopter, automobile,
and super-highway, all of which tend to
bring the individual away from the urban
areas. Another positive factor, however,
is the threat of bombing. The engineer is
responsible for the bomber, to be sure,
but he cannot control the factors of hu-
man will which may or may not drive-
people from cities in event of a bombing
threat. (Continued on page 22)

We have now reached the point where
several concrete conclusions can be drawn
from the facts presented. We now can
at least suggest just what the engineer
can accomplish toward the ultimate solu-
tions of the technologically created social
problems.
His first consideration must be, as
has been pointed out, that engineering is
not a purely beneficial agency. He must
assume the responsibilities, as Pendred
determines them, of such things as the
noise which accompanies automobiles and
railways; of the filth and ugliness caused
by steel and coal; and of the poison of
fumes from the smokestacks as cheap elec-
tricity is produced. Pendred is convinced
that the engineer can give us a pure at-
mosphere and noiseless streets; that he
can give us wholesome factories and re-
move the slums; and that he can make a
fair country out of a desolate waste—
"all these, and a thousand more without
robbing us of a single one of the bene-
fits and advantages which his work con-
fers."'
Secondly—and here is an immensely
important step—the engineer should fur-
ther both his own education and that of
his successors in the fields of sociology,
ethics, and economics. Naturally, to do
this, he must cooperate closely with the
educators, both in the technical and cul-
tural fields. Several engineers, sociolog-
ists, economists, and ethics analysts bear
out this view. Cooke, for example, states
that, "In the light of the current world
situation, ethics become the rules of con-
duct for effective action looking toward
socially desirable ends." * Jackson also
maintains that, ". . . we engineers have
an obligation to ourselves and our fellow
citizens to encourage the highest practic-
able development of these ethical aspects
of engineering."" Similarly, Prout says,
"On the engineer and on those who are
making engineers rests a responsibility
such as men have never before been called
upon to face." 10 As early as 1904,
Douglas, in anticipating technical prog-
ress in the twentieth century, realized
that, ". . . the lead will be taken by the
nation whose technical managers possess
skill, stimulated and not stunted by edu-
cation. . . ." n Continuing, Hugh Farrell
rather tersely points out the value of edu-
cation in saying, "The fact is that only
the men who know what happened yester-
day know the present state of progress." 12
It seems that Farrell could have extended
(Continued from page 20)
this to say that only men who know what
is happening about them can hope to aid
progress in the future.
Closely connected to the need of further
education is the need for intercommuni-
cation of ideas between fellow technolog-
ists. The engineer must acknowledge the
advantages which he will derive from
eliminating trade secrets; for then, as
Douglas says, ". . . while society will be
the gainer, he himself will be able to

Should the research engineer be held
responsible for technological unemploy-
ment resulting from his discoveries?
draw from a larger capital of facts than
now stands to his credit." 13 The engineer
must also realize that for wholesome
progress, the more universal the knowl-
edge becomes, the more universal becomes
the correct social adaptions to this knowl-
edge.
Lastly, the engineer must organize so-
cieties in his profession, preferably on a
national or even international scale, to
study these social problems of a tech-
nological age. Through these societies, he
and his fellow technologists can intelli-
gently determine the cause of the prob-
lems, and in so doing, can at least recom-
mend their solutions. An interesting ex-
periment was attempted in this direction
shortly after World War I when several
engineering societies organized the Ameri-
can Engineering Council of the Federated
Engineering Societies. This council at-
tempted to study and report on techno-
logically caused social problems. The
experiment proved a failure, largely be-
cause of the reactions it caused from the
employer groups. Whether or not these
societies should be governmentally con-
trolled is beyond the problem of this
analysis, but the existence of such organi-
zation would prove to be a powerful
forward step on a road so often detoured.
In summarizing, we can see that the
engineer must recognize the existence of
three main constituents of the situation.
First, he must acknowledge the problems,
and the fact that they require ultimate
solutions. Second, he must realize that he
has a definite, although not complete,
share of the responsibility of solution, for,
as Lewis Mumford analogizes, ". . . the
instrument only in part determines the
character of the symphony or the response
of the audience: the composer and musi-
cian have also to be considered.""
Finally, the engineer, realizing that the
solution is not impossible, must educate
both himself and his fellow technologists
in order to make possible a rational and
sustained attack upon the social problems
which technology has introduced into the
life of the nation and of the world. With
these three factors well in mind, then, and
only then, can the engineer undertake the
actual solution of the problems and there-
by take his rightful place in society as one
who controls men and the forces and ma-
terials of nature for the benefit of the
human race.

It rewards us with some really amazing
success stories, and with abundant oppor-
tunity. The field has hardly been touched.
New Field
This field of industrial electronics was
completely unknown, of course, when I
received my degree in Electrical Engi-
neering from Illinois and entered the
Graduate Training Course at Allis-
Chalmers in 1925. During the 2-year
course I stuck pretty close to electrical
work — and at its completion, I was on the
electrical test floor helping run tests on
some of the first big blooming mill motors
the company ever built.
Next, I worked in the Basic Industries
Massive castings for a 60-inch Superior-
McCully crusher being assembled in the
A-C West Allis plant. Machine will reduce
5-foot boulders to crushed rock—bundle
2500 tons of ore per hour!
Hardening 2200 trimmer blades per hour, this Allis-Chalmcrs Induction Heater

Department on electric mine hoists. In
1931, I moved back to the Electrical De-
partment, doing sales application work
for the Motor and Generator Section. I
worked, successively, on unit sub-stations,
had charge of the Mixed Apparatus Sec-
tion, was in Industrial Sales, handled
contract negotiations and sales liaison
work during the war, and in 1947 took
charge of the company's growing Elec-
tronics Section.
Here we develop and apply four main
classes of industrial electronic equipment:
Rectifiers, Induction Heaters, Dielectric
Heaters and Metal Detectors. With the
exception of Rectifiers, this equipment is
relatively new to industry. We're turning
up new uses and applications every day.
It's an absorbing line of work, and pio-
neers an entirely new frontier of indus-
trial methods.
Wide Choice of Interests
I've traced this brief personal history to
illustrate the widely varied opportunities
a young engineer finds at Allis-Chalmers
even within a single field such as electricity.
I never got far from the Electrical De-
partment, because I found what 1 wanted
right there. But I wouldn't be giving a
true picture of Allis-Chalmers if I didn't
touch on the other great departments,
covering just about every major industry.
Many GTC students find their greatest
interest and opportunity in the Basic In-
dustries Department. There they design,
build and install the machinery for min-
ing, smelting, cement making, flour mill-
ing, oil extraction, food and chemical
processing. Others become interested in
hydraulic or steam turbines, the com-
plexities of centrifugal pumps and the
engineering problems of small motors or
V-belt drives.
Some fit into engineering and design.
Some find themselves most interested in
manufacturing or in field work such as
service and erection. Many like selling,
and find their engineering training pays
off best in a District Sales Office.
Whatever a man may eventually find
most to his liking and advantage, the
Allis-ChalmersGraduateTrainingCourse
is a wonderful vantage point from which
to start. It offers contact with all major
industries, and a chance at many types of
work: design, manufacture, research, test-
ing, installation, selling, advertising, ex-
port. There is no other organization that
can offer a graduate engineer such a wide
range of activities.

sumed only 75% as much as the SAE
10 grade, while the SAE 50 consumed
only 45% as much as the SAE 10. The
relation of oil viscosity to consumption
is well recognized and it is the common
practice of motorists to go to a heavier
oil when consumption becomes objec-
tionably high with lighter oils. The data
in Table II thus merely confirm the ex-
perience and practice of many years.

Oil Volatility and Consumption
Table III summarizes the results of a
series of engine tests to evaluate the rela-
tion of oil volatility to consumption. The
test oils were all of SAE 10 grade, 48
seconds Saybolt viscosity at 210 F., and
had Viscosity Indexes of 100 or higher.
The reference oil and oils A and B con-
tained neutrals meeting or exceeding the
viscosity and volatility requirements for
Insigne quality oils. Oils C, D and E
contained lower viscosity, more volatile
neutrals.
As shown by the consumption ratios,
the SAE 10 Pennsylvania reference oil
and oils A and B had substantially iden-
tical consumption characteristics; whereas
oils C, D and E were consumed at much
higher rates because of their poor vola-
tility characteristics. Thus the very vola-
tile oil E was consumed 2.4 times as fast
as the reference oil, although both had
practically the same viscosity and Vis-
cosity Index.
A fundamental reason why Pennsyl-
vania oils have low volatility and low
consumption tendencies lies in the fact
that for any given viscosity, Pennsylvania
oils have a materially higher distillation
curve than oils from other crudes. This
fact is illustrated by Table IV which
shows vacuum distillation curves of typi-
cal neutral oils of similar viscosity, and
of Pennsylvania, Mid-Continent, and
Coastal origin. These curves illustrate
better than words why it is so difficult for
non-Pennsylvania oils to equal the low
volatility and consumption characteristics

Science Makes a Better Mop
Cleaning tasks lightened by new
Du Pont cellulose sponge yarn

An ordinary mop has a bad habit of
unraveling. It often leaves a trail of
lint. And it wears out fast. A man
who sold yarn to mop manufacturers
decided to do something about these
nuisances. Perhaps some reinforcing
material might be combined with the
yarn. He did some experimental work
of his own but more and more he
wondered if it might be possible to
use a cellulose sponge coating.
THREE YEARS OF RESEARCH
So the man called on Du Pont, the
company that had introduced the
cellulose sponge to America in 1936.
The suggestion of a sponge yarn pre-
sented a challenging problem.
Some way would have to be found
to extrude a tightly fitting cellulose
sponge jacket around each strand of
the yarn. The whole sponge process
would have to be adjusted for use
in an especially designed machine.
Du Pont chemists and engineers
tackled these problems.
Even the very first cellulose sponge
yarn produced experimentally made
mops that were strong, absorbent
and durable. But the process had to
be changed and improved time and
time again. Then the mops were
tested in places where they would
get the hardest usage—railroad sta-
tions, for example.
The mops performed so well that
Du Pont built a pilot plant near
Buffalo and, under a license from
the man who had the original idea,
manufactured the yarn on a small
scale. Only after three years of study
and testing was Du Pont able to

CROSS-SECTION of the new mop yarn. Each
cotton fiber strand is jacketed with cellulose
sponge material.
offer mop manufacturers the yarn
in commercial quantities.
FASTER AND CLEANER
Mops made with cellulose sponge
yarn pick up and retain so much
water they need wringing less often.
You can mop a floor with them in
far less time than it formerly took.
They dry quickly, leave no lint. They
outwear other mops three to five
times. Best of all, perhaps, they stay
dirt-free longer than ordinary mops.
Here is something women will ap-
preciate—a clean mop!
The introduction of these new
cleaning tools is another example of
how business firms of all sizes depend
on each other. The Du Pont Com-
pany had facilities for specialized re-
search on cellulose sponge. Because
Du Pont could supply sponge yarn
economically, some twenty mop man-
ufacturers today have a better prod-
uct that saves maintenance people
and the American housewife time,
labor and money.

tility characteristics. High Flash and Fire
Points alone do not necessarily indicate
low over-all volatility. Crude source, de-
gree of refining, and actual vacuum dis-
tillation characteristics must be consid-
ered.
Viscosity Index and Consumption
Table V summarizes typical results of
engine tests to evaluate the effect of Vis-
cosity Index (V.I.) on oil consumption
tendencies. Although all of the test oils
had identical viscosities at 210 F., con-
sumption increased markedly with de-
creasing V.I. Oils of low V.I. may thus
have from 30 to 50% higher consumption
tendencies compared to high V.I. Penn-
sylvania oils. This difference may be at-
tributed to the fact that a naturally high
V.I. will be from 1 to 3 Saybolt seconds
higher in viscosity than a low V.I. oil
at the temperatures existing in the ring
zones of running engines (300 to
500°F.), although both oils have the
same viscosity at 210°F. Since all motor
oils thin out to very light viscosities at
temperatures of 300 to 500°F., a differ-
ence of only one or two seconds in vis-
cosity within this range, due to differ-
ence in Viscosity Index, has a very signifi-
cant effect on consumption.
Table V

93 V.I. Oil 1.1
76 V.I. Oil 1.25
60 V.I. Oil 1.3
38 V.I. Oil 1.45
Although a difference of a few Saybolt
seconds in viscosity at temperatures in the
range of 300 to 500°F. may not seem of
much significance, a typical SAE 30 Penn-
sylvania oil of 100 V.I. will have a work-
ing viscosity from 50 to 90% higher at
400°F. than that of an SAE 30 non-
Pennsylvania oil of 50 V.I.
Viscosity Index Improvers
Viscosity Index-improving additives
have become widely used in many motor
oils of non-Pennsylvania origin during re-
cent years. The addition of a small per-
cent of a V.I.-improver to a low V.I. oil
can raise its apparent V.I. to 100, while
addition of improver additives to oils of
quite high natural V.I. can readily pro-
duce oils having apparent Viscosity In-
dexes of 120 to 130 or higher.
Very high Viscosity Index oils are ob-
viously desirable as engine lubricants,
but the chief question is whether "syn-
thetic" V.I.'s are the same as natural
V.I.'s. As a partial answer to this ques-
tion, Table VI summarizes in very con-
densed form typical results of engine tests
conducted to study the effect of V.I. im-
provers on oil consumption tendencies.
As shown, the SAE 10 Pennsylvania refer-
ence oil was treated with sufficient V.I.
improver additive to increase its viscosity
to 57 seconds at 210°F., and its Vis-
cosity Index to 130, yet this oil had the
same consumption characteristics as the
original oil. In other words, as far as the
engine and consumption were concerned,
the "doped" oil behaved just as if the
V.I. improver was not present at all. By
contrast the addition of sufficient Penn-
sylvania bright stock to the SAE 10 refer-
ence oil to increase its viscosity to 57
seconds at 210°F., with a V.I. of 103,
had a consumption ratio of 0.7, or only
70% as much consumption as the 48
seconds at 210°F. reference oil.
This agrees closely with the viscosity-

consumption relation shown in Table II.
Considerable evidence is accumulating
to cast a question on the value of V.I.
improving additives in motor oils. This
evidence points to the fact that a large
part of the so-called viscosity increases
and high V.I.'s attained with improper
additives may be false values in terms of
actual performance in engines. In the
case of "doped" oils the customary vis-
cosity values determined by Saybolt or
glass tube kinematic viscosimeters may
be quite different from the true or per-
formance viscosities in engines. This
may be explained by the fact that labora-
tory viscosity determinations are made
while the oil is flowing in a thick stream
and at very low rates of flow or shear.
In engines, the oil is in extremely thin
films and is subjected to very high rates of
flow or shear by the rapid motion of the
engine surface being lubricated. These
very high rates of flow or shear imposed
on the oil films in running engines are
largely responsible for the limited effec-
tiveness of V.I. improving additives in
engines, compared to the viscosity and
V.I. values indicated by laboratory vis-
cosity determinations.
Viscosity Index improvers are com-
plex polymers of very high molecular
weight, characterized by an extremely
long straight chain structure.
To provide a ready-made analogy, a
blend of V.I. improver and lubricating
oil might be likened to a mixture of
spaghetti and peas, the former represent-
ing the V.I. improver and latter, oil. At
very low rates of flow, such as pouring
the mixture from a cup, which may be
considered the equivalent of low rates of
shear in a laboratory viscosimeter, the
spaghetti is evenly mixed with the peas
and forms a criss-cross pattern to hold up
the flow of the peas. This hindrance to
flow is equivalent to an apparent increase
in viscosity. At very high rates of flow,
such as forcing the spaghetti-pea mixture
through a pipe at high speed, which cor-
responds to high rates of shear that pre-
vail in engines, the strings of spaghetti
will tend to become straightened out
parallel to the direction of flow, and will
thus offer less resistance to the flow of the
peas. This greater flowability is then the
equal of an apparent decrease in vis-
cosity, brought about by a change in
the mixture pattern due to the rate of
motion, the composition and the tem-
perature remaining unaltered.
In Saybolt or glass tube kinematic
viscosimeters, rates of flow and shear are
very low, so that these customary labora-
tory viscosity methods indicate the maxi-
mum change of apparent viscosity capable
of being caused by V.I. improvers. At the
very high rate of flow and shearing action
developed in engines, essentially the op-
posite prevails, and the V.I. improvers
cause a minimum of change in the base
oil. Consequently the customary labora-
tory viscosity increases and high V.I.'s
imparted to petroleum oils by these ma-
terials are rather theoretical figures which
may have limited practical value in actual
use in motor oils.

Rock Drill
The unique idea of applying high ten-
sile wire to form a "live-spiral" flute on
the shank of a carbide masonry drill
promises to alter, simplify and reduce
time and cost in the drilling of holes in
masonry, brick, tile, concrete and similar
materials.
Announced by the Carboloy Company,
Inc., the new drill development is claim-
ed to represent the greatest single ad-
vance ever seen in carbide tipped masonry
drills.
Not only does the new drill cut faster,
but it keeps right on going deeper with
greater ease than with conventional types
of drills. There is no necessity for with-
drawing the drill to remove dust from the
hole because the "live-spiral" flute cleans
the hole while the hole is being drilled.
While carbide drills long ago demon-
strated their ability to cut holes cleaner
and faster than conventional types, the
drills were open to the same objections
as were steel drills. Dust accumulated in
the bottom of the hole and gradually
packed almost solid. Gradually the 'bite"

of the drill would decrease until a point
was reached where even heavily increased
pressure on the drill would not result in
further cutting but would only cause the
drill to slow down—or even stall—due
to the ecjcessive load on the drill motor.
At this point—usually equal to about 3
times the diameter of the drill—it would
be necessary to withdraw the drill, clean
out the hole, and start drilling again.
This operation usually had to be repeated
several times if the hole were of any
depth.
With the new Carboloy wire "live-
spiral" masonry drill, the wire, solidly at-
tached to the shank at lower and upper
end, is wound around the shank in a
low-spiral helix.
The striking effect of this unique idea
has to be experienced or seen to be ap-
preciated. Dust cut loose by the tip in
any type of masonry "marches" right up
around the spiral and out of the top on
the hole, accumulating in a neat circu-
lar mound around the O.D. of the hole.
Pressure required on the drill is no greater
at the end of a deep hole than at the start.

How to help a gearmotor
take care of its teeth
To minimize wear on the teeth and to insure
smooth, quiet operation, reduction gears in motors
like this must be held in perfect mesh, no matter
what the load. That's one reason why engineers
mount the gear shafts on Timken® tapered roller
bearings. Timken bearings hold the shafts in accu-
rate alignment. Gears are kept perfectly positioned,
with each tooth meshing smoothly and carrying
its full share of the load.
Gears mesh smoothly,
wear longer, with shafts
on TIMKEN bearings
Here is a typical gear-case countershaft showing
a common method of mounting Timken bearings.
Due to the line contact between the rolls and races,
Timken bearings give the shaft maximum support.
There's less chance of deflection under load. The
tapered bearing design takes both radial and thrust
loads in any combination. End-movement of the
shaft is kept to a minimum. Gears wear longer-
work better.

PROBLEM—You are designing an electric clock for auto-
mobiles. The clock itself is completed. To set the clock,
the spindle which turns the hands must be pushed in against
a spring pressure and then turned—and, of course, when
the clock is installed, this spindle is back under the dash-
board. You want to provide a means for pushing and
turning the spindle from a point that is easy to get at.
How would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—Use an S.S.White flexible shaft.
The illustrations show how one manufacturer does It. Re-
gardless of where the clock is mounted, the flexible shaft,

Synthane is light as a mouse. But that's not
all—for it has a combination of valuable me-
chanical, electrical and chemical properties
useful in many applications, in almost
every industry. Electrically, Synthane
combines high dielectric strength with
low power factor and low moisture ab-
sorption. Mechanically, it is hard, dense,
highly resistant to impact fatigue, abrasion
and wear. Chemically, it stoutly resists
corrosive liquids and atmospheres. Yet with
all this, Synthane is easily machined on
standard equipment. Synthane rods and tubes
are excellent for high-speed production on auto-
matic screw machines.
These and many other properties—combined

several reasons. Principally, it must be
made certain that, during the modifica-
tion procedure the loudness of other parts
had not been increased.
Restoring the Adding Machine: The
best check that can be obtained will be to
remeasure the loudness of the machine
in its reference condition. This, of course,
necessitates the removal of the modifica-
tion to the part causing noise clump "A."
Rechecking the Reference: The steps
described under "Establishing a Refer-
ence," should be repeated at this point.
The oscillographic trace and average
sound level figure so obtained should
match those of the initial tests. If they
do not, and if the SLM is in calibration, a
complete revaluation of the modification
must be made. If they do, there is a high
probability that the results are accurate,
and this phase of the work can be called
complete.
Imperceptible Noise Reductions
In conclusion, it should be pointed out
that an average noise reduction of less
than 1 db. will not be perceived by the
human ear. This fact emphasizes the im-
NOISE AT U OF M
(Continued from page 13)
portance of accurate measuring equipment
in sound reduction work. On the above
discussed adding machine project, for
example, in 80 percent of the cases the
individual noise reductions amounted to
less than 1 db. These small gains are
cumulative, however, and the work was
continued until the test adding machine
was 50 percent quieter than production
models.
CONCLUSION
In reviewing the points brought out in
this report, it may be noted that the con-
struction of sound measuring equipment
is both complex and costly. Unless the
test chamber is heavily built and its
walls are carefully treated with sound
absorbing material, the test results will
be worthless due to the penetration of
external noise or to reflections from the
room boundaries. Both the microphone
and the sound level meter must be of the
highest quality so that their gain and
frequency response will be stable over
long periods of time. They must meet
American Standards Association design
specifications so that results obtained will
be comparable to those obtained by other
laboratories throughout the country. The
requirements for the oscilloscope ampli-
fier are less exacting, since it is used only
for qualitative checks.
It is important that the initial loudness
of the test machine be determined ac-
curately, and that initial test conditions be
reproduced exactly during subsequent
evaluations.
Oscillographic tapes furnish an invalu-
able visual guide to progress in altering
the machine mechanism. During modifica-
tion, the necessity of later restoring the
machine to its reference condition must
be kept in mind. Sometimes this requires
that duplicate parts be provided.
In sound work, the chances for meas-
urement errors are numerous. The danger
lies in the fact that the ear cannot per-
ceive small changes in loudness, so any
incidental changes in machine noise out-
put may pass unnoticed or be falsely at-
tributed to the modification made. The
only safe check on results is based on
the prompt and careful restoration of the
machine to its reference condition, and
the attempted duplication of the original
reference measurements.

Chemical engineering is concerned with the
manufacturing processes in which chemical or
certain physical changes of materials take
place. Any manufacturing process of this kind
is made up of a sequence of operations such as
heat transfer or distillation. By designing, con-
structing and operating equipment for conduct-
ing these various operations, the student can
better contribute to the development of new
processes as required by modern industry.

MARCH, 1950

At the close of World War II our
country decided to make broad education
available to large numbers of veterans
under the G. I. Bill of Rights, and it be-
came inevitable that the engineering
schools in the United States would soon
be taxed to capacity. The American So-
ciety for Engineering Education, in the
prewar days, had been constantly aware
of the numbers of young men who were
entering the engineering colleges, and
especially during the early 1930's there
was much discussion concerning the so-
called "lost generation," those young
people who had finished their engineering
education and had difficulty finding em-
ployment because of the depressed busi-
ness situation. It has been felt that an
engineering education is an ideal prepara-
tion for life and if the young man, having
finished his engineering education, does
not find a specific place in an engineering
company, he can perform other types ot
work better than he could without the
formal training, even though they arc-
only remotely related to what is normally
called engineering.
It was interesting to note that a survey
conducted in 1935 of 35,000 engineering
graduates of the depressive years, indi-
cated that 80% of this group were satis-
factorily placed at that time, not necessar-
ily in specific engineering jobs, but suffi-
ciently well placed so that they indicated
they did not wish to make a change.
Study Conducted
Enrollments in engineering, of course,
dropped materially during the war period
and created a large gap in the number of
available engineers. But as soon as the
war ended, it was apparent that the num-
bers were going to grow beyond all ex-
pectations and that the gap made by the
war might be filled in a relatively short
time. For this reason the American So-
ciety for Engineering Education appoint-
ed a committee (the Manpower Commit-
tee) under the leadership of Dr. Karl
Compton, at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, to study the situation as it
developed. After an exhaustive study, it
was decided that the Committee should
continue on a permanent basis, and in
1946 the writer was asked to head this
Committee to continue the studies. In
1946 this Committee, working closely
BY
MAYNARD M. BORING
with the U. S. Office of Education, made
an attempt to cover the field even more
broadly than it had been before, and con-
tacted every company that visited any of
the engineering colleges in the United
States in connection with employment of
engineering graduates. At the same time
the U. S. Office of Education made a most
comprehensive study in connection with
the enrollment statistics. The results of
this survey—covering all 1800 colleges
in America, together with the demand pic-
ture covering over 4000 industrial organi-
zations, all of the state governments, and
all branches of the federal government—
indicated that we should strike a surplus
of engineers in 1949-
Predictions of the Manpower Commit-
tee, started even before the end of the last
war, have developed with a remarkable
degree of accuracy. Studies and predic-
tions of this Committee, concerning the
number of graduates who would take
advantage of the G. I. Bill of Rights,
have been excellent both as to the num-
bers and to their timing.
82% Placed Satisfactorily
However, the predictions regarding
placement of these men in 1950 (even
though theoretical numbers seem to corre-
late very well) have not resulted in large
unemployment as clearly expected and
predicted by the Manpower Committee.
The engineering training is versatile
enough so that despite the fact that there
has been some business recession during
the last year, and survey figures indicated
considerable surplus of engineers during
1949, a recent survey indicates that as of
November 1949, 82% of the engineering
graduates of the classes of 1949 were
satisfactorily placed.
Further studies in connection with the
situation, involving those who are not re-
ported as placed, indicate that the major-
ity should be classified as unknown rather
than unplaced, tl is also clear that many
of these people have found positions on
their own and merely have not reported
so to their schools. During the early part
of the fall, General Electric Company had
an excessively large number of engineer-
ing applicants. It has been interesting to
note how this has decreased. Even though
present indications are that the midyear
classes of 1949-1950 are having more
than normal difficulty in finding suitable
placement, the versatile engineering grad-
uate finds a job, whether or not in his
particular field, and seems to have satis-
fied his desires for a position.
Some Shortages Still
Previous to the war, in 1939, there
was a total of slightly over 17,000 engi-
neering graduates and the law of supply
and demand had kept the various cur-
ricula in reasonable balance. Following
the war it was evident that surpluses
would develop much faster in some areas
of engineering than in others and it was
clear that even in 1947 there was a slight
surplus in electrical and aeronautical en-
gineers. Even though in 1950 we antici-
pate the largest surplus of all, there still
will be a slight shortage in the fields of
civil and chemical engineering. It is not
anticipated that there will develop too
much of a surplus in mechanical engi-
neering, primarily because the mechani-
cal engineer is unquestionably the most
versatile and can find employment most
readily in any of the other fields.
Recent figures just developed by the
U. S. Office of Education indicate that
the 1950 class will be even larger than
has been anticipated. By actual count, in-
cluding both those colleges accredited by
the Engineering Council for Professional
Development and by the other colleges
giving engineering degrees, the United
States alone will produce approximately
60,000 B.S. graduates in 1950. A similar
increase is shown in the graduate schools,
and it is anticipated during 1950 that at
least 7500 M.S. degrees will be conferred
as compared to 4798 conferred in 19-19:
and at least 800 Ph.D degrees as com-
pared with 417 in 1949.
Individual, College and Industry
Considering our past experience, the
fore, even though the above figures ind
cate our largest surplus of engineers in I
year 1950, we are thoroughly convin
that if the young men from the colle
really put on a good sales campaign,
they leave no stones unturned, that
three of us, namely, the new gradu
the schools, and industry, will be able I
turn up satisfactory placement for
these men who should enter the en
neering profession.

Dy plane, train, truck ... by boat and barge ... by
nearly every type of transportation, Dow chemicals move
across the nation. There are weed killers for the prairies,
insecticides for the almond and fruit growers in California,
epsom salt for the tanneries in Massachusetts, caustic
soda for the paper mills of Washington and soil fumigants
for the truck gardens of Florida. These are but a few of
more than five hundred Dow chemicals serving American
industry and agriculture.
A well-organized sales and distribution system is required
to move so varied an output of chemicals into a multitude
of major industries from coast to coast. At Dow, this com-
plex distribution problem is solved by strategically locating
plants, branch offices, and warehouses near the nation's
production centers. In many instances, the much-needed
material can be shipped overnight from Dow to processing
plants in the vicinity.
This close relationship to industry results from Dow's
progress throughout the years in production, sales and
distribution of chemicals "indispensable to industry and

BY
PROFESSOR LEO GOLDBERG
Chairman of the Department of Astronomy; Director of the University Observatory
Cartoonists frequently portray the
astronomer as a somewhat eccentric indi-
vidual, who wears a long beard and spec-
tacles, lives on a mountain top and peers
nearsightedly through his telescope at the
doings of the Martians. This represen-
tation is in line with the popular notion
of astronomy as an interesting, even fasci-
nating occupation, but one that is com-
pletely divorced from the facts of every-
day life.
It is of course true that astronomy is
one of the "purest" of sciences, in the
sense that observations this evening of a
planet, a comet or a galaxy of stars one
hundred million light years away will not
lead to the development of new-model
automobiles, refrigerators or giant-size
television screens by tomorrow afternoon
nor even by next month or a year from
now. On the other hand, it is conceiv-
able that such observations might well
set off a chain reaction of further discov-
eries during the next 50 or 100 years that
could result in enormous practical bene-
fits.
Each and every technological advance
that is made represents a conquest by
man over nature. To conquer nature we
must understand her, or rather we must
understand the operation of her laws. One
of the major tasks of the astronomer is
the study and discovery of the laws of
nature. In this respect the aims of as-
tronomy and physics are identical. The
physicist has the advantage that he may
control the conditions of his experiments.
The astronomer must work with whatever
he finds in the heavens, but can choose
from among countless billions of stellar
"laboratories," offering a fantastic variety
of physical conditions.
Because of the tremendous time lag
that is usually involved, it is difficult to
link a specific astronomical discovery
with the later invention of a piece of ma-
chinery that contributes to human welfare.
It is interesting to note, however, that the
mathematical foundation of engineering
is the calculus, and that Newton found

it necessary to invent the calculus in order
to explain the motions of the planets as a
consequence of the law of gravitation.
Even more dramatic has been the contri-
bution of astronomical research to the dis-
covery and release of atomic energy, with
all of its potentialities for both advancing
and destroying civilization. The first
chain-reacting release of atomic energy by
man, which took place at the University
of Chicago in 1942, represented the cul-
mination of about 40 years of nuclear re-
search by physicists, following Einstein's
announcement in 1905 of the equivalence
of mass and energy in the form of his
now-famous equation: energy = mass
times the square of the velocity of light.
The equality between mass and energy
could be predicted directly as a conse-
quence of Einstein's Special Theory of
Relativity, which in turn was based on ex-
periments showing that the measured
speed of light in a vacuum is always an
immutable constant, no matter what the
frame of reference of the observer. But
what does the constancy of the speed of
light have to do with star-gazing? The
answer is that the finiteness of the speed
of light was first discovered and measured
by astronomical observation, and that it
was not measured terrestrially until 175
years later.
The story of the first determination of
the speed of light provides an exciting
demonstration of the importance of pure
research. In 1675, a Danish astronomer,
Roemer by name, was studying the eclipses
of Jupiter's moons by their parent planet.
Now these moons, of which eleven have
now been found (only four were known
in Roemer's time) revolve about Jupiter
in perfectly regular orbits. Once the orbits
have been determined, it should be pos-
sible to predict the times of eclipses to the
nearest fraction of a second, just as we
predict eclipses of the sun and moon cen-
turies in advance. Quite unexpectedly,
however, Roemer found that the times of
eclipse depended on the distance between
Jupiter and the Earth. That is to say,
when the two planets were both on the
same side of the Sun or at minimum dis-
tance, the times of the eclipses were ob-
served relatively about l6'/2 minutes
earlier than when Jupiter and the Earth
were on opposite sides of the Sun, or
about 186,000,000 miles further apart.
Roemer's explanation, bold for his
time, was that the phenomenon was due
to the time taken by light to travel
through space, in this case from Jupiter to
the Earth. His resulting measured value
of the speed of light is in fair agreement
with the currently accepted value of
186,273 miles per second, measured ex-
perimentally with high precision.

In a. recent bulletin issued by the Department of Labor there
is a statement to the effect that an engineering education fits
the recipient for a number of vocations besides the engineering
profession.
The report of the President's Commission on Higher Edu-
cation says: "One other factor contributing to large engineering
enrollment is that engineering education has long been recog-
nized as having great value as general education, and as a good
foundation for work in almost any profession."
J
"*^
We naturally expect that engineers will occupy the profes-
sional positions in design, operation, and research; also, that
sales work will claim a fair percentage. Less commonly known
is the fact that a large percentage will become executives.
Engineering is an important gateway to administrative posi-
tions. In fact, probably no other profession provides as many
managers to the larger corporations as does engineering. One
reason for this situation is that many American corporations
are devoted to industries in which engineering plays a leading
part. Engineering education itself is another reason. Emphasis
has been placed on analysis, realistic problems, and strict atten-
tion to work on the part of the student.
It should be noted, however, that progress to such positions
is made through a chain of engineering experience and not
because the individual has had academic education in manage-
ment. At this point, some statistics are necessary.
Thirty-one percent of American railroad companies have
presidents who came up through engineering. In the electric
light and power industry, thirty-eight percent of the presidents
have an engineering background as have thirty-two percent of
gas company presidents. These data are from large corporations
in which the chief executive might have come from law, finance,
or other sub-divisions of the organization. Outstanding ex-
amples from the industrial field are the presidents of U. S.
Steel, General Motors Corporation, and American Telephone
and Telegraph Company.
Reliable surveys show that at least 65 percent of all engineers
of 20 years or more experience are in administrative positions,
usually in connection with industrial work. A casual survey of
the long roll of Michigan graduates shows that even a higher
percentage will in all probability come from this group.
With the facts in mind the young engineer must give
thought to the possibilities which will in time face him. He
must be prepared to decide whether he will find his greatest
happiness in the strictly technical phases of engineering practice
or in related administrative work.

OF SUPERSONIC SPEEDS
BY
JOSEPH E. ROWE '51EE
The advent of supersonic flight has
necessitated the development of radically
different means for measuring air speeds,
since the old devices do not operate satis-
factorily under the extreme conditions im-
posed in the supersonic range. Instrumen-
tation engineers have met this new chal-
lenge just as they have met others
throughout the history of aviation.
The first airplanes'were equipped with
a minimum of instruments, all simple in
concept and design. Since those early days
the problems of instrumentation have be-
come increasingly more complex and sig-
nificant to the development of modern
aircraft. Accurate and reliable instru-
ments permit the pilot to operate his
plane safely at marginal conditions, and
thus to take full advantage of its poten-
tialities. As the speed, range, and power
available were increased, instrumentation
engineers were forced to devise new
means to measure such variables at higher
and higher levels of operation.
Basically, the purpose of all aircraft in-
struments is to provide accurate indica-
tion of conditions in and around the
plane. Maximum reliability is required,
for blind flying depends solely on the
consistent accuracy of the instruments.
Accuracy also becomes more vital as in-
creased speeds complicate the problems
of safety and navigation. Weight and
space available are also limiting factors in
the design of aircraft instruments.
The air speed indicator, in particular,
enables the pilot to obtain maximum per-
formance from his plane, for this valuable
instrument warns him when the plane is
approaching stalling speed or exceeding
the maximum safe operating speed. In
planes flying in the ordinary speed ranges,
this function is performed by a mechani-
cal device, the diaphragm-type indicator.
I. The Diaphragm-Type Indicator
The conventional type of air speed indi-
cator, used on standard aircraft, utilizes
the principles of the pitot pressure tube.
The various forms of this indicator may
be classified as (a) mechanical, (b) ther-
mal or hot wire, and (c) differential pres-
sure. The differential pressure type has

JOSEPH E. ROWE
been used most extensively; it will there-
fore be described in detail here.
This type of instrument is divided
readily into (1) the operating element
exposed to the airstream flowing past the
aircraft and (2) the indicating element
mounted on the instrument panel of the
plane. The pitot pressure tubes must
be mounted so that they are in an un-
disturbed portion of the air outside the
plane; otherwise the system will not give
an accurate reading of air speed. One
tube is open at one end, receiving the full
impact of the airstream and transmitting
the corresponding pressure through the
other end to the interior of the diaphragm.
The second tube presents a closed end to
the airstream, but has small holes along
its sides through which the prevailing
atmospheric pressure is transmitted to
the interior of the air-tight case surround-
ing the diaphragm.
The indicating element measures the
difference between the head pressure built
up by the plane rushing through the air
and the pressure of the static air around
it. Through a chain of gears and levers
the linear motion of the diaphragm is
changed to rotary motion to deflect the
pointer.
This type of air speed indicator is a
very sensitive instrument, well suited to
the speed ranges of conventional planes.
The diaphragm responds to minute differ-
ences in pressures in the pitot tube lines.
These pressures, however, depend not
only on air speed but also on the density
of the air, which in turn varies with tem-
perature and pressure, and therefore alti-
tude. The magnitude of this error may be
computed on a circular slide rule, and a
correction applied when very accurate
measurements are necessary.
A second source of error is the align-
ment of the pitot pressure tubes in the
airstream, which must be constant for
perfect results. The magnitude of this
error is negligible at moderate speeds, but
begins to become appreciable at high
speeds.
Since the outbreak of World War II,
considerable work has been done in the
fields of guided missiles, rockets, and
supersonics. Eventually these develop-
ments pushed the upper limit, as the speed
of sound was approached, beyond the
effective range of the diaphragm-type in-
dicator; for at these speeds the pitot tube
alignment error became too large to be
ignored. The indicator can be recali-
brated and used in supersonic wind tun-
nels, where the airstream flows past the
tubes in a constant direction. But ordin-
ary operating conditions cannot be ex-
pected to present a constant angle of at-
tack on the pitot tubes, so that this indi-
cator is impractical for free supersonic
flight.
In the past, instrumentation engineers
have occasionally turned to electronics for
measurements too difficult or too incon-
venient to be made by mechanical means.
Engine temperature, for example, is com-
monly measured with appropriately placed
thermocouples. Electronically operated
gyroscopes are favored because they can
be sealed completely within the case and
thus protected from external contamina-
tion. The problems of supersonic speed
measurement have also been solved with
electronics.
2. Electronic Systems for Guided
Missiles
Before the end of World War II we
were exploring the field of guided missiles
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


The Germans did much work in this field,
and had they been given a little more
time would certainly have used guided
missiles quite extensively. At present,
aircraft manufacturers are showing a great
deal of interest in electronic means of re-
cording flight test data remotely. Such a
system would permit relaying to the
ground flight data from pilotless radio-
controlled airplanes or guided missiles,
and would also simplify installation prob-
lems by transferring oscillographs and
other delicate equipment to the ground.
Since it is usually necessary to measure
several variables simultaneously and a
separate transmitter and receiver for each
variable would be impractical, some sys-
tem of multiplexing is needed. At present
the two basic systems are frequency sep-
aration and time separation; a great many
combinations and varieties of these sys-
tems are used in radio telemetering.
One of the simplest of these systems
employs frequency separation with a num-
ber of amplitude-modulated subcarriers.
With this system the sending equipment
consists of a number of audio frequency
oscillators supplying power to an equal
number of pick-up instruments which am-
plitude modulate these subcarriers in ac-
cordance with the variable to be measured.
The sub-carriers are mixed in a master
amplifier and in turn modulate a radio
transmitter which is usually frequency-
modulated. At the receiving end the
radio signal is demodulated; the channels
are separated by a set of band-pass filters,
and the individual sub-carriers are de-
modulated and recorded.
In the design of such a system, several
effects may cause trouble. Cross modula-
tion effects resulting from nonlinearity in
the transmission system as well as adja-
cent channel cross talk effects will inter-
fere and must be minimized. The signal
to noise ratio must be kept high. Con-
ventional criteria for choice of oscillator
frequencies and filter design must also be
considered.
An example of this type of system is
the Beacon Doppler System for the deter-
mination of velocities and positions of
guided missiles, usually called DOVAP.
In this system, a radio frequency wave is
transmitted back to the ground as a signal
bearing a constant phase relationship to
the original signal. Heterodyning of the
transmitted and received signals yields the
magnitude of the radio frequency doppler
effect. In this system, instead of depend-
ing upon energy reflected from the missile
body as the so-called reflection doppler
systems do, a signal of many times
greater amplitude is radiated by a beacon
in the missile, thus greatly extending the
range of the system.
DOVAP provides for transmitting a
stabilized continuous radio frequency wave
from a fixed ground station to the missile,
doubling the frequency of this trans-
mitted wave in the missile receiver, and
transmitting the doubled frequency from
the missible to three or more fixed ground
receivers. The purpose of doubling the
frequency is to eliminate technical diffi-
culties encountered in attempting to re-
reference frequency. From the differ-
ences in the change of path length to
three or more receivers, the spatial co-
ordinates of the missile at any instant may
be computed by solving a group of equa-
tions representing the intersection of three
or more ellipsoids (spheres if the trans-
mitter is coincident with one of the re-
ceivers). To solve the equations necessary
to determine the coordinates of a 100-
point trajectory would take weeks, but the
ENIAC electronic computing machine can
compute an 800-point trajectory in seven
minutes. This machine prints coordinate

roughly twice the speed of sound.
ceive and transmit on a common fre-
quency.
The frequency of the missile signal as
received at each ground station is hetero-
dyned with twice the frequency of the
original transmitted ground signal. This
is accomplished by receiving this reference
frequency on a separate receiver at each
ground station and doubling the fre-
quency by the same method used in the
missile receiver. The beat or doppler
frequency is produced by mixing the
radio frequency output from the two re-
ceivers. Land wires are used to transmit
the doppler signals to a common point
for the purpose of making permanent and
continuous records on 35 mm. film.
Each doppler frequency cycle represents
a change in path length from the trans-
mitter to the missile to the ground re-
ceiver of one-half wave length of the
data in tabular form and will also tabu-
late the first and second differences be-
tween successive points, from which the
velocity and acceleration may be com-
puted.
3. Electronic Measurement over
a Fixed Course
Another technique for measuring air
speed is the fixed-course method. This
system is, of course, limited to test runs
and cannot be applied to normal flight,
but the method is of interest because it
gives very accurate results and finds wide
application in research and development
programs.
The Army Air Force has developed an
all-altitude speed course, which is defined
by two parallel radio beams a fixed dis-
tance apart. The test plane flies at the

ment of modern industry has fostered the
combination of activities dealing with
plant facilities and services into a separate
plant engineering department which offers
a real opportunity for versatile engineers
who do not wish to specialize and who
dislike the monotony of routine engi-
neering.
YOUR JOB
Plant Engineer
YOUR OUTLOOK
Approximately 30,000 industrial plants,
large institutions and service establish-
ments have plant engineering and main-
tenance departments ranging from 5 to
2000 employees each. Qualified plant
engineers are in demand at present, due
to the curtailment of engineering students
during the war, post-war industrial activ-
ity and comparatively recent recognition
of the major importance of the plant engi-
neering function in industry. Current rec-
ord engineering college enrollment may
result in a surplus of engineers within 5
years. The effects will probably not be
felt as soon in plant engineering as in
other fields due to the greater importance
of, and the longer period required to
gain, the necessary and varied practical
experience. Best opportunities in the in-
dustrial centers: approximately 60 per
cent in the triangle formed by the states
of Illinois, Delaware and Massachusetts.
You Need
Bachelor's degree in engineering is
desirable; knowledge of the fundamentals
of structures, mechanics, thermodynamics
and electricity is essential; a professional
engineer's license is an asset. Major prac-
tical requirements, a working knowledge
of construction methods; equipment in-
stallation; heat, light, water, and power
supply; plumbing; sheet metal work;
carpentry; welding; pipe fitting; paint-
ing; electrical work; etc. Knowledge of
the following is necessary in some degree
depending upon the type and size of or-
ganization: production and process meth-
ods; metallurgy and heat treating; man-
agement organization and cost account-

law; building, safety and insurance codes;
labor contracts; personnel, public and

chanical aptitude, ingenuity, versatility and
adaptability, initiative and common sense;
the ability to cooperate with others under
difficult conditions; and the physical stam-
ina and temperament to work long, irreg-
ular hours in emergencies and under
pressure.
You Do
Design and construct or contract for
and supervise buildings, grounds, and
facility additions and alterations; make
and carry out plant and equipment lay-
outs; install equipment. Design, install
and operate light, heat, power, water, sew-
age communication and transport facili-

convenience provisions necessary for per-
sonnel and property. Organize, train per-
sonnel and manage all repair and main-
tenance activities on buildings, grounds
and equipment; operate all housekeeping
and service facilities essential to, but not
directly concerned with, production ma-
chinery; and select, control, store and
distribute related equipment and supplies.
In short, the plant engineer is responsible
for all physical aspects of overall plant
operation except for product design and
production.
You Get
As a graduate engineer without practi-
cal experience a salary comparable to
other branches of engineering, starting at
from $2500 to $3300 per year with more
or less uniform increases of from $150 to
$200 a year for the first 10 years. Be-
yond that, increases are less regular.
Median salary of engineers with 20 to 40
years experience is from $5000 to $7000
a year. The range for the upper 25 per
cent with the same experience is from
$7000 to $10,000. After about 15 years,
graduate engineers' salaries begin to top
non-graduates' by $1000 to $2000 an-
nually. A graduate engineer with no prac-
tical experience would probably start as a
junior or assistant engineer and gain the
necessary practical knowledge through
contact, observation and study. A non-
graduate or graduate engineer with prac-
tical experience would probably start in
the maintenance department and gain
knowledge of engineering organization
and administration through contact, study
and observation. Advantages: lack of
monotony; constantly changing conditions
offer broad scope for versatile, energetic
man; close association and cooperation
with others; opportunity to demonstrate
management and organization ability with
his own far-flung "business within a
business." Broad knowledge of overall
operation offers better than average op-
portunity for advancement to manage-
ment positions. Disadvantages: often
long, irregular hours under pressure;
need for rapid decisions with limited data
available; must accept blame for acci-
dents; touches every activity of plant and
requires tact, diplomacy and salesmanship.

Adventure, romance and the urge to
cope with nature in foreign lands among
strange people has undoubtedly been a
factor in attracting men to the engineer-
ing profession. Perhaps it still is, even
though current world conditions tend to
limit the opportunity for foreign service
and the war showed millions that coping
with nature and man in foreign lands
sometimes leaves a great deal to be de-
sired.
The war did, however, emphasize the
dependence of our modern, and essen-
tially mechanized economic system upon
engineering. Furthermore, circumstances
and the shortage of engineers brought
many into close contact with a profession
to which normally they might have paid
scant attention.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


demands a combination of natural apti-
tudes or abilities which not all indi-
viduals possess. Over the years a large
proportion of the starters will find that
engineering offers the elements of pro-
fessional happiness; a congenial occupa-
tion adequate as both a vocation and
avocation; an income sufficient for a
reasonable living standard; recognition of
work and ability and the opportunity for
advancement.
From one-third to one-half of the start-
ers will decide sooner or later that engi-
neering is not for them, or that their
engineering background will pay bigger
dividends when used in that indefinite
zone between engineering and business.
Perhaps a straight engineering career ap-
pears monotonous and prosaic, the road
ahead too long and rocky, or the scope for
full range of imagination and ability too
limited.
To many of this latter group plant
engineering, as a profession, offers a
great deal. It also demands a great deal.
Probably no other branch of engineering
offers the bitter-sweet contrasts, more op-
portunity for individualism, or enjoys such
strong animosities and loyalties. There
appears to be no middle ground prob-
ably because of the combination of tech-
nical, physical, and temperamental quali-
ties necessary for success.
Make no mistake, however, plant engi-
neering is not a sinecure nor a haven for
those that lack engineering aptitude. It
demands natural engineering ability, a
love of engineering, the type of man who
could force himself to be a successful
engineer in any field, a man of wide in-
terests, well grounded in fundamentals,
mentally alert but happier with diversified
work than with routine engineering. He
should be a combination engineer, busi-
nessman and executive, temperamentally
stable, able to work well under pressure
and to co-operate with others.
For this type of man, plant engineering
offers: A wide diversification of work and
interests demanding imagination and ver-
satility; the satisfaction of accomplish-
ment; opportunity to develop executive
and administrative ability in what amounts
to a business within a business; and close
personal contact with all operating activi-
ties of an organization.
Because of the wide range of activities
and the opportunity for demonstrating
ability, it also offers unusual opportunities
for advancement into the management
group. For certain "fiddle-footed" indi-
viduals with an urge to travel, there is the
further advantage of a more or less hori-
zontal occupation. That is, the major ac-
tivities are common to all industrial or-
ganizations, thus offering the maximum
opportunity to transfer from one industry
to another with a minimum waste of past
experience.
Again, as a profession, it is relatively
new and the opportunities proportionate-
ly great. Functionally it is as old as in-
dustry itself, a combination of artisan
activities which for generations have kept
the wheels of industry turning smoothly.
Richard H. Morris, A.B. in Math-
ematics and B.S. in Mechanical En-
gineering, University of California
'20 and Massachusetts Institute of
Technology '21 was a marine ma-
chinist before entering college.
Upon graduation he completed the
student engineer's course with Wor-
thington Pump and Machine Cor-
poration and spent two years in
sales and service in the Southwest
and Mexico. He has had wide in-
dustrial experience including Ma-
rine engineer with Red Star Line
of the I.M.M. between New York
and Antwerp; electrical engineer on
control cable for submarines with
the Fore River Yard at Bethlehem
Shipbuilding Corporation; transit-
man U. S. Bureau of Public Roads
in the Southwest; Assistant Chief
Engineer of United Verde Copper
Co. at Clarkdale, Arizona and as-
sociated services with the Chevrolet
Motor Division of General Motors
Corporation and Wright Aeronauti-
cal Corporation.
He became Engineering Editor of
Power Plant Engineering in
1938 and Editor of Plant Engi-
neering upon release from active
duty with the Air Force in the fall
of 1947.
With the deve'opment of modern indus-
trial organization and the rapid increase
in the use of power for mass production
following World War I, services and
facilities increased in importance until
they are now an integral and essential part
of the production process.
During this transition period there was
a trend toward grouping the artisan activi-
ties under one head. Technological de-
velopments and the growing complexity
of modern industrial problems rapidly
raised the requirements to professional
level on a par with other departments.
Fundamentally, plant engineering is a
service function supplying: the physical
framework upon which operating depart-
ments are hung; and the net work neces-
sary for the organization to operate as a
co-ordinated unit. While plant engineer-
ing as a function is now widely used and
universally recognized in industry, many
different titles are still used. Aside from
plant engineer, the most common are:
Works Engineer; Maintenance Engineer;
Master Mechanic; Superintendent of
Maintenance; Superintendent of Buildings
and Grounds; and Superintendent of
Power and Maintenance.
By and large, however, plant engi-
neering is not widely known among engi-
neering students. The outlook, require-
ments, and duties were covered concisely
in the Job Barometer feature of the July
1948 issue of Pic Magazine. The essen-
tial features of this review are reprinted in
this article. This concise treatment, how-
ever, does not touch on such pertinent
points as: The relation of plant engi-
neering to industry as a whole; its relation
to other engineering functions; its place
in the organizational setup; the relative
opportunities in large and small plants;
and the effect of industrial concentration
on possible job locations.
Industry in its broad economic sense is
"human exertion employed for the crea-
tion of value." Elements essential to com-
mercial success may be grouped in many
ways but must always include such basic
functions as: (1) Management, for the
direction of co-ordination of effort; (2)
design, for the basic details of the prod-
uct; (3) supply, for the facilities and ma-
terials necessary for operation; (4) pro-
duction, for the actual accomplishment;
and (5) sales, for merchandising and
distribution of the product.
While the relative importance of these
five functions will vary with each case,
each element will be present in some de-
gree in every business. This is true
whether it be a construction, consulting,
or manufacturing company, a laundry,
bakery, or university. In every case some-
one must decide: what to do; how to do
it; provide the facilities; take care of the
actual operation; and market the output.
Of these basic requirements, that of
providing (or providing and maintain-
ing) the facilities is always engineering.
It is in fact plant engineering. In some
cases, such as a college for instance, it

Anyone who has been fortunate enough
to have Keith Hall for a design course can
be sure that they get the "straight dope"
on things as they are done in the field.
When Keith came to Michigan last fall to
join the faculty of the Engineering Col-
lege, he brought with him seventeen years
of industrial experience to pass along to
the students in M.E. 82 and M.E. 86.
KEITH HALL
Hailing from nearby Blissfield, Mich.,
where he was quite an athlete—football,
tennis, baseball, track, and basketball, no
less—Keith entered the University of
Illinois in 1928. After completing two
years of studies in mechanical engineer-
ing, he took a position as Junior Engi-
neer with Detroit Edison for a year. De-
ciding to continue his studies, Keith then
entered the engineering college of the
University of Alabama, from which he re-
ceived his B.S. degree in mechanical engi-
neering in 1933.
While in college, Keith belonged to the
Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, Beta chapter of
Tau Beta Pi (sponsors of the 'Bama
Beam), and he played some varsity soc-
cer. His main activity, outside of studies,
was his position as co-operator of a room-
ing house.
Shortly after graduation, taking a posi-
tion with the Toledo Scale Company,
Keith found himself doing research, de-
velopment, and design work—but none of
it directly on scales. He also held posi-
tions with Tolco and the Defiance Ma-
chine Works, both subsidiaries of the To-
ledo Scale Company, at one time, until,
in 1949, he took up consultant engineer-
ing with Delos M. Palmer and Associates
of Toledo.
Always one to grasp any good oppor-
tunity (he joined his high school track
team of seniors as a freshman, assuring
himself the position of captain the fol-
lowing year), Keith decided to become
an instructor here at the U. of M. while
continuing his consultant work on the
side.
Keith says his other interests are divided
between the Society of Plastics Engineers,
one wife, one daughter (age 12), one
dog, and one cat. Athletic-wise, he shoots
an 80 game of golf and likes to skate.
Since he believes the one thing a stu-
dent should get out of college is the abil-
ity to think for himself, Keith thinks the
honor system is a fine means to this end.
Although he has yet to be subjected to the
faculty evaluation by students, he likes the
idea and believes it is a great help to in-
structors.
We hope to see Keith stay here at the
U. of M. for many-a-year to give the
students his rare combination of good
humor, clear instruction, and emphasis
on the practical side of engineering.
. . . JOHN DAVIES, chairman of the U.
of M. chapter of AIEE-IRE.
Once in a great while there graduates
from the U. of M. an engineering student
with such a combination of intelligence,
personality, and ambition that success is
the only possible result. John Davies is
one of these.
Entering the U. of M. from Grand-
ville, Mich, in September, 1946, John set
out to get the best possible education in
the line of electronics engineering. This
interest in electricity was seated early in
John's life, as evidenced by the fact that
he blew his first fuse at the age of four.
During high school John branched out
and participated in band, orchestra, track,
football and drama. Graduating from
Grandville High School in 1944, he then
enlisted in the Navy and entered radio
tech school. After thirteen months of
schooling at Chicago, 111., Gulfport, Miss.,
and M. I. T., John was assigned to re-
search work in "Operation Cadillac" on
San Clemente Island off the California
coast, Here he tested new radar methods
and instructed radar operators in the use
of new ship-to-plane radar equipment.
John has been a staff assistant in the
East Quad since 1947, and recently be-
came assistant advisor of Strauss House.
He held the position of vice-president of
the local Tau Bate chapter last semester
and was a Student Assistant last fall and
summer to Prof. Cannon of the E. E.
department. John is also a member of the
honorary electrical engineering society.

Upon receiving his B. S. degree in

terns, and ceramics. Balancing these, he
pursues his interests in instrumental music
and swimming.
His paper on "Quantitative Measure-
ments of the Reproduction of Sound" won
the local award in the AIEE-IRE report
contest and will be entered in the district
contest to be held at Jackson, Mich., later
this year.
The AIEE-IRE can well be proud of
its chairman—an excellent student and a
top-notch, all-round fellow.

It Takes Big Machines To
Make Big Machines
Reprinted with photon an permi/mion of
BuHiness Week Magazine
Press making is big business—literally.
Presses themselves are usually big items,
even when they are used to form small
parts, and you have to have big planers,
millers, boring machines, and lathes to
build them.
Hydraulic Press Mfg. Co., Mt. Gilead,
Ohio, has been making big ones for years,

One of the three 6000 ton sections gets
a preliminary assembly check.
but its latest is a real giant, an 18,000-
ton press for high pressure steel pipe.
HPM engineers spent five months design-
ing the first model for National Tube Co.
Recently HPM got an order for another

one, from Consolidated Western Steel
Co. Hydraulic's engineers figure it will
take about 17 weeks to turn it out.
Actually this 18,000-ton job is three
presses in one, an in-line arrangement of
three 6,000-ton models. It will take 40-
ft. lengths of steel, shape them into high
pressure pipe on its 54 in. by 492 in. die
surface mounting.
Here's what happens: First a steel
plate, 113 in. wide, 40 ft. long, and y2 in.
thick is fed into a 2000-ton press where it
is shaped into a long "U". Then the U-
shape is placed around a mandrel, a sta-
tionary die for forming pipe in HPM's
18,000-ton giant, and the press ram
forms the U into a pipe 36 in. across.
Forming, which is done while the metal is
cold, takes about 47 seconds. Once the
pipe is formed, it is carried to an auto-
matic welder which completes the process
by welding up the seam.
The stamping monster itself weighs
more than a million pounds, and stands
on a heavy concrete foundation below the
plant floor.
The electrically driven hydraulic system
of the press uses more than 5,000 gallons
of oil to operate the ram.
Twelve strain rods connect the cylinder
and ram assembly to its 20-ton welded
base. These rods are 297^ in. long, 17
in. thick, and weigh 19,000 pounds each.

Turning the strain rods for the big press takes one two-shift, 40 hour week for each rod. The rods are 297V2 inches long,
weigh 19,000 pounds each. Work requires threading both ends, machining journal diameter to 0.001 inch tolerance, and
cutting ring slots. Nuts that fasten rod in press weigh about half a ton each.

PROFESSOR A. D. MOORE
Department of Electrical Engineering
Editors Note: "Good Morning, Sir"
is the second of two articles which were
first published in the Technic in 1935
and is now being reprinted because of
popular demand.
Some interviews are easy to obtain. An
employer's representative comes to the
campus, you sign up for an interview, and
that's that. At the other end of the scale
is an interview you seek, and which takes
place in the employer's office. Let us talk
about that kind. Assume that the em-
ployer has written to me, asking for can-
didates. I dip into my file of available
men and select four names. Maybe I
really found six who might qualify, but
only four have complied with the well-
publicized request for filing personal rec-
ords; two others have not, and are often
passed by for that reason. Why? If a man
will not go to a small amount of trouble
to participate in a plan erected entirely for
his own benefit, how can I believe he
will take care of an employer's interests
in any better style?
Next, having the typed record at hand,
I can make sure the four are qualified,
with no loss of time. Duplicate letters
are now sent to the men, apprising them
of the opening, and giving the essential
facts of the case. At the same time, I
write to the employer and at least tell him
the names of the men he may expect to
hear from. If I have time—and often I
don't—and if the occasion may warrant, I
may also discuss each man in the letter
to the employer.
It is now up to each man to telephone
the employer for an interview date; or, to
write a request for that privilege. If the
request is by letter, the candidate includes
a copy of his personal record.
Assuming you are granted an interview,
you get there ahead of time. In the next
twenty minutes you decide your fate. I
assume you have already learned (forgive
these personal details) that pants look
better when pressed; that a recent shave
improves any male of college age or over;
that finger nails need cleaning as well as
cutting; that there is at least once when
it is well to sit up straight and favor the
other fellow with a few direct looks—
which is right now. The employer has

PROF. A. D. MOORE
usually had some practice at interviewing,
and he will probably lead the conversa-
tion. To any questions, give direct and
clear replies. If he dangles an opportunity
for you to run off at length on some tan-
gent, be wary. Perhaps he is looking for
that very trait. You came here about this
job, and not to issue a half-hour alibi for
the football team. Of course, if it appears
that he really wants to take time out to
discuss football, skeet shooting, or the
soy bean crisis, let him have his way and
even contribute to the sin. But be careful.
Don't ever make the mistake of assum-
ing that all employers are interview ex-
perts. Some certainly must find interview-
ing quite a trial. When the poor man
seems hesitant about prying into your
qualifications, he may need help. Take
the lead and tell your story to the best of
your ability—keeping your twenty min-
utes in mind. He is a busy man, but kind-
ly and courteous. He may make it easy
for you to overstay, but will take sharp
and secret objection to any serious trans-
gression. If you err on the safe side by
attempting to leave too soon, he will hold
you; don't worry about that. If he keeps
you all morning and then takes you out to
luncheon, it is a safe assumption that mat-
ters are going rather well. But look out
for luncheons. It will then be too late for
anything but regrets, if you do not al-
ready know how to handle yourself at
table. This does not finish our discus-
sion of interviews; we will have to come
back to it later on.
How You Can Fit In
You are about to graduate; it is cus-
tomary for graduates to secure employ-
ment and make a living; therefore, you
propose to follow custom. Well, no grad-
uate is ever handed a job on that basis.
The hard cold world doesn't care a
whoop whether you, individually, get a
job or not. The only reason you ■will
ever be hired is because you have con-
vinced some employer that it will pay to
take you on. Now, it is true that a few
large companies recruit a large group of
men each year, the only immediate con-
cern being that each man be desirable.
The company is big enough to use any one
man later, in almost any line along which
he may develop. That is campus recruit-
ing; you can learn of it here, first-hand. It
is quite a different story when you ap-
proach an employer who has no jobs open.
You make such an approach because
this is one company you would like to
be with. You secure an interview. The
employer is glad to look you over, at
least. Now get this picture: that morn-
ing, he, the chief engineer, has had a
dozen telephone calls, a third of which
call for decisions. His patent expert was
in a while ago to raise a question he will
have to settle, and he doesn't know the
answer. Nobody knows the answer.
Shortly before you arrive, a report is
dumped on his desk, calling for a close
decision as to whether to spend fifty
thousand for scrapping old machinery
and buying new. His wife is on the
telephone, asking him to help guess
whether little Philbert's temperature is
due to scarlet fever, indigestion, or cuss-
edness inherited from the father's side.
And then you walk in. He didn't ask
for you in the first place. He cannot
use you now. Unaided, he can't see
where he might use you six months hence.
If you simply appear as a large, blushing
graduate who wants to work for him, all
you are doing is to hand him one more
vexing problem he won't find the answer
to.
Doesn't it become rather clear that
under such circumstances, you had better

problem? It is possible for you to come to
the interview knowing a great deal about
the company's products; advertisements,
trade journal articles, gossip, friends—-
there are many possible leads. You learn
that certain products have not switched
over to welding—which is one of your
preferential interests. You are prepared
to suggest that you might be taken on in
any capacity whatever, just so you could
learn still more of welding problems and
needs, and could soon be of value in the
application of welding.
Some of his Company's products are
intricately shaped. You have learned
that diecasting is used to the limit, but
that apparently plastics have been left
alone. You learned something about
plastics in college, and have picked up
a good deal more from recent publica-
tions. You do not rudely take the gen-
tleman to task for not having lost his
head over plastics, but you do find a
chance to say how fascinating it would
be to have a job where such adaptations
might work well and save money.
Of course, all such preparation may
usually miss the mark. As long as you
are an outsider, you may never be able
to smoke out a thing the company isn't
already alive to and worried about. The
point is, that the employer will be pleas-
antly astounded to interview a recent
graduate who is thinking more of the
employer's problems than his own. You
will not be hired that day; he can think
of no excuse for wedging you in. Two
weeks or three months later, that man
may call you long distance (provided
you include your telephone number in
your record) and ask if you can go to
work next Monday.
On Knowing Your Way About
Ann Arbor, population 25,000, four
bookstores. Largetown, population 250,-
000, forty bookstores. Would you be-
lieve it? Of course not. Unless Large-
town has a college or two, probably the
only bookstore it ever had went to the
wall in 1933. You know something about
bookstores and where to look for them.
Why not be equally acute about some
of the simpler, more accessible factors
that will affect your job-finding prob-
lem? Two states have equal areas, equal
populations. Therefore, equal engineer-
ing opportunity? Certainly not. That
depends on industrial development. Some
simple measures of states, their develop-
ment, their share in national income,
can be found in the World Almanac. Or
you might borrow the most recent na-
tional membership list for your profes-
sional society, to count up the proportion
of national membership represented by a
state or region in which you wish to lo-
cate. Why? Isn't it fair to assume that
roughly, engineering opportunity is in
proportion to the degree in which a city's
engineers are found in your society?
dred electrical manufacturing companies
in the United States. Why do great num-
bers of electrical graduates concentrate
their attention on the few? And isn't it
too bad, when at a given time, energy
directed towards getting into these few
may be almost entirely wasted?
While this article was being written,
Mr. Clifford A. Faust of Transit Journal,

Engineers usually find themselves in thorough training programs after having been
accepted in some branch of industry.
Often your line of preference will lead
you to special questions not answerable
by those who are convenient to your per-
sonal approach. If you wish to work
at improving leather processing, you have
to know where the leather business is.
McRae's Blue Book is a register of
American industry. There is undoubtedly
a national leather association, anxious to
answer letters. You pay taxes to support
bureaus in Washington that know the
answers to such questions. Use the privi-
lege. The Polk people publish a guide to
Detroit's business and industry.
In the job conference with E. E.
seniors last year, the seniors were asked
to name some companies they had thought
of tackling. About ten companies—all
large—were rapidly nominated. I had
with me a January trade journal which
was filled with annual survey reports. One
such listed about thirty leading manufac-
turers, and showed whether they had
made or lost money in the preceding two
years. Eight of the ten companies named
had lost money. A number of firms that
had already climbed out of the red were
not mentioned. There are about six hun-
and vice-president of Eta Kappa Nu Asso-
ciation, dropped in. He has been in
charge of the association's placement work
in New York. In a large share of cases
in which unemployed engineers came to
him, he found they had religiously hound-
ed eight or ten companies, and had culti-
vated few, if any other contacts.
The Bulletin Board
In order to make a point later on, the
bulletin board should be mentioned. In
the writer's department the bulletin board
is made to serve a variety of educational
functions. Routine matters are, of course,
posted there. In addition, a rather con-
tinuous parade of items is run through-
out the year. Many of the features de-
scribed in these articles are presented in
one form or another. The senior is given
plenty of opportunity to inform himself
as to what is expected of him in partici-
pating in our particular placement scheme.

of astronomical research. The release of
atomic energy in the sun and stars was
recognized as an accepted fact by scient-
ists twenty-five years before the successful
splitting of the uranium atom on the
Earth. The process by which the Sun gen-
erates its prodigious energy output (about
70,000 horsepower per square yard of sur-
face) is one of jusion, as distinguished
from the fission involved in the uranium
process. Four atoms of hydrogen come
together deep in the solar interior to form
one atom of helium. Since a helium atom

weighs less, by a tiny fraction of an ounce,
than four atoms of hydrogen, each fusion
process is accompanied by the conversion
of the excess mass into radiant energy.
It is impossible to forecast in advance
the types of astronomical observations that
are likely to have an important human im-
pact in the future. That is why investiga-
tions in most of the important fields of
astronomy are carried on by the Univer-
sity of Michigan at five research observa-
tories, in Michigan, California and South
Africa. At Ann Arbor, the 37 y2 inch re-
flector is rounding out forty years of serv-
ice in the photography of stellar and
nebular spectra. A regular and systematic
patrol has been maintained to record the
antics of peculiar stars, the celestial freaks
that are few in number but weigh impor-
tantly in theories dealing with the evo-
lution and structure of the much more
numerous normal stars. At Portage Lake,
sixteen miles northwest of Ann Arbor, a
new and powerful telescope of the so-
(Continued from page 7)
called Schmidt type has just gone into
operation to probe into the structure of
the Milky Way and to make studies of the
distant galaxies, or "island universes."
The University also maintains an astrono-
mical outpost in the southern hemisphere
at the Lamont-Hussey Observatory at
Bloemfontein, South Africa. There ob-
servations are made of the southern por-
tion of the sky that is not visible from the
northern latitudes. Over a period of more
than 20 years, about 8,000 double stars
have been discovered in South Africa with
the 27-inch refractor, and a second tele-
scope has recently been added to survey
the spectra of the southern stars.
At Lake Angelus, 52 miles northeast of
Ann Arbor, the University operates the
McMath-Hulbert Observatory, one of the
largest solar observatories in existence
and probably the best equipped. Research
at Lake Angelus is carried on in the gen-
eral fields of solar and atmospheric
physics, and is concerned with the com-
position, structure, and mechanics of the
ready been put to very practical use. As
is well known, the transmission of radio
waves over great distances on the earth
is possible only because of the existence
of electrically-charged layers of atmo-
sphere 50 miles or more above the earth's
surface. The charged condition of the
atmosphere is created by the action of
ultra-violet radiation from the sun, and
ordinarily makes possible easy communi-
cation by radio anywhere on the globe.
Occasionally, however, transmission on
certain radio frequencies suffers sudden
and complete fadeouts, sometimes for
periods of several hours. The radio fade-
outs appear to be due to sudden outbursts
of ultra-violet radiation and of charged
particles from the surface of the sun. The
onslaught of the solar radiation and cor-
puscles against the earth's atmosphere dis-
turbs and alters the condition of the
radio-reflecting layer—hence, the fade-
outs.
The origin of the solar storms is not
known, but they can be observed with

atmospheres of the sun and earth. An off-
shoot of the solar observatory has been
established in California, where a tem-
porary auxiliary station for observing
the sun has been set up at the Mount
Wilson Observatory.
Although I have been emphasizing the
importance of pure research in astronomy,
I should also like to point out the exis-
tence of certain areas of investigation,
especially in the solar field, that have al-
solar telescopes and their effects on ter-
restial radio communications forecast sev-
eral days in advance. The importance of
radio communications in war time is ob-
vious and it is therefore not surprising
that publication of solar observations from
the McMath-Hulbert Observatory was
forbidden during the war. The sun was
patrolled constantly, however, and reports
of solar disturbances telegraphed daily to

To improve the accuracy of testing
Bell telephone switching equipment and
to speed up tests during manufacture,
Western Electric engineers designed
and built a unique test set — known as
the Tape-O-Matic—which has a paper
tape "brain."
Controlled by a narrow paper tape,
punched with coded information, the
machine automatically performs compli-
cated series of tests. If there is a fault in
the equipment under test, the Tape-O-
Matic stops, rings a bell and indicates
the source of trouble on a lighted panel.
Some 1200 different tapes, varying in
length from one to thirty feet, are used
for testing various assemblies. Formerly
an operator, in testing an average size
assembly, had to make 41 individual
connections. With the Tape-O-Matic,
one multiple plug connection does the
job. And 28 preliminary tests, 81 lamp
observations and 71 key operations are
replaced by one tape insertion and the
push of a button.
The Tape-O-Matic can cut testing
time as much as 80%—practically elimi-
nates the possibility of human error—
and helps to assure equipment of highest
quality. It is a good example of the
ingenuity, skill and thor-
oughness which Western
Electric engineers put in-
to making Bell telephone
equipment.
The 1500-pound Tape-O-Matic is one
of the largest, most complex and most
versatile test sets that Western Electric
engineers have ever devised.

Washington. There the data was an-
alyzed together with reports from other
solar observatories to yield forecasts of
radio communication conditions for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. These forecasts were
of course invaluable to the successful plan-
ning of allied bombing missions. The
service continues in peace time under the
sponsorship of the National Bureau of
Standards.
Other exciting developments of solar
research appear to be just over the hori-
zon. It was discovered during the war
that the sun is a powerful emitter of
radio waves in the short-wave length re-
gion between 1 centimeter and 15 meters.
The volume of the solar radio "noise"
sometimes increases enormously during
the solar storms. It is tempting to specu-
late that the bombarding radio waves may
affect profoundly the growth and activity
of plant and animal life in our planet.
The possible biological and medical impli-
cations of solar radiation have hardly be-
gun to be explored.
Before solar radiation can reach the

earth's surface, it must first traverse our
atmosphere, where it is partially absorbed
by molecules of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon
dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other
atmospheric constituents. Most of these
molecules prefer to absorb infra-red ra-
diation rather than visible light and there-
fore study of solar infra-red radiation
contributes information on the composi-
tion and physical states of the earth's
atmosphere. New techniques for explor-
ing infra-red solar radiation, developed
since the war at the McMath-Hulbert Ob-
servatory, promise to open up new fields
of research in the border line area be-
tween solar physics and meteorology.
These cited examples of the practic-
ability of astronomy may be multiplied
many-fold, as other fields of science and
other groups of observatories are consid-
ered. The astronomer is, to be sure, much
more of a pure observer than a physicist,
for example, but he does not, on the other
hand, need to create his experiments. A
vast multitude of phenomena are ready at
hand. He does not just idly gaze; but
rather observes with a purpose, as does
any scientist, and this purpose is to aid
or create some other branch of terrestrial
science. Thus, I say again—Astronomy is
practical!

desired altitude and on a heading perpen-
dicular to the two beams. True ground
speed is obtained by measuring the
elapsed time required to fly this known
course.
The ground radio transmitting equip-
ment consists of two radio transmitting
sets similar to Instrument Landing Sys-
tem (ILS) beam transmitters. Each set is
essentially a radio transmitter and a radio
frequency radiating system. The desired
frequency is obtained on these sets by
inserting the proper crystal and retuning
the transmitted circuits. The airborn
equipment consists of a timing station,
the output of which is fed to a very high
frequency (vhf) radio set ARC-3. The
radio receiver used (BC-733-D) is a ten-
tube superheterodyne.
A modulated 90 and 150 c.p.s. signal
transmitted from the test plane is received
by the time recorder set located at Station
2. Radio receiver B-733-D here is identi
cal with the airborne beam receiver except
that it operates on a frequency corre-
sponding to the carrier frequency of the
airborne vhf transmitter. This combina-
tion of transmitter and receiver serves as
a means of telemetering the radio beam
signal from the test plane to the ground.
Sensitivity of the visual output stages of
both receivers is set at near maximum in
order to obtain an overall course width of
two degrees. This corresponds to a re-
ceiver output of -\- 150, 0, — 150 micro-
amperes. A sensitive relay that makes
contact at ± 2 micro-amperes is placed
across the indicator. When the test plane
passes through the oncourse position, this
relay operates and momentarily ungrounds
the output of an oscillator, thereby serv-
ing to trigger the electronic chronograph.
The chronograph records on a paper tape
impulses which serve to indicate the
elapsed time required for the test plane
to traverse the distance between the two
beams.
At the beginning of the test run, the
pilot sets the channel selector on the con-
trol box to correspond with the frequency
of the first beam to be crossed. After he
has reached the desired altitude, he com-
municates with the ground operator at Sta-
tion 2 to announce the first run. He then
flips the control box from communica-
tion to speed course. As he crosses the
first beam at a 90-degree angle, the
ground chronograph will be triggered
automatically and the recorders at both
stations will indicate that the beam has
been crossed. Then he flips to the fre-
quency of the second beam, so that the
end of the run will be recorded in the
same way. The elapsed time for the flight
is read from the chronograph. Two passes
are made in opposite directions to com-
pensate for wind velocity.
The course is controlled by a monitor
receiver, a vhf crystal controlled ten-
tube superheterodyne, placed on the sur-
veyed azimuth line at a distance of 400
feet from the transmitters. If the signal
received from the transmitters contain
equal amounts of 90 and 150 c.p.s. modu-
lation, corresponding to equi-signal locus,
the output from the two filters will be
balanced and the d.c. output of the re-
ceiver will be zero. Any shifting of the
course will cause an unbalance in the sys-
tem, result in unequal amounts of 90 and
150 c.p.s. modulation being received,
and thus produce a d.c. output from the
course monitor receiver. This output is
fed to an amplifier which converts it to
a.c. and energizes a two-phase induction
motor. This motor in turn drives a slid-
ing arm which shifts the position of the
equi-signal locus. The direction of the
motor is to reduce the unbalance to ± 1
microampere, or to ± 1/150 degree
course width. This is sufficiently accurate
to maintain the oncourse position to with-
in ± 8 feet at a distance of 12 miles
from the transmitter. The total error in
this system is less than 0.5 percent; the
direction of the plane may be held to less
than a 3-degree variation.
An overall picture of accuracy may
be obtained by using the maximum errors
that can be assumed. These are a 3-degree
variation in heading, 2 100-foot error in
beam alignment (two beams off in oppo-
site directions), and an 0.008-second tim-
ing error; on the basis of 600 mph and a
run of ten miles, the error is 0.340 per-
cent. The probable error encountered is,
of course, much less than this.
4. Direct-Reading Electronic Indicator
For practical operation of a plane, how-
ever, neither the guided missile nor fixed-
course technique is applicable. A device
is needed which will measure the air speed
accurately at supersonic levels and indi-
cate the result immediately on a dial
mounted on the plane's instrument panel.
Electronics were applied to this problem,
and such a device is now being developed.
The basic principle of this instrument is
the measurement of the transit time of an
ionized column of air between two elec-
trodes a fixed distance apart. Ionization
may be produced by breakdown of a spark
gap or from alpha particles. The former
method is more practical because the latter
requires mechanical pulsing and does not
produce sufficient signal to allow steady
detection, particularly at higher speeds.
Laboratory units have been constructed
embodying the above principles; they are
built around a spark gap controlled in
breakdown frequency by a combination of
a master oscillator, a spark integrating cir-
cuit, and a spark source. Such a system
—

is diagrammed in Figure 1. The spark
gap is positioned in a region of relatively
undisturbed air, while an ion detector is
located a fixed distance downstream from
the spark gap. The detected signal is am-
plified and shaped by this combination.
The synchroscope speed indicator is es-
sentially a time measuring device; the
circular sweep frequency is determined by
combination of a master oscillator and the
sweep generator in such a way that one
complete circular sweep corresponds to
one milli-second of time. During opera-
tion, a pip appears on the oscilloscope
trace which indicates the instant of spark
gap breakdown. A second pip registers
the presence of a detected signal from the
iondetector. The angular deviation of the
second pip will indicate the elapsed time
interval between breakdown and receiving
a signal at the ion detector. This instru-
ment measures the differential time re-
quired by the vehicle to traverse a distance
through air equal to that between the
spark gap and the ion detector. Since this
distance is fixed, the above measurement
gives directly an air speed measurement.
The indicator element is divided into
two main elements, the control chassis
and the synchroscope indicator chassis.
The main control chassis is composed of
the main power supply, which supplies +
150 volts regulated to the pulse-amplifier
shaper circuit, a + 6.3-volt a.c. filament

When agriculturists want to learn
what nourishment a plant is getting,
they inject radioactive materials into
the soil and trace their absorption
with sensitive instruments. Industry
and medicine also use this ingenious
technique to gain needed knowledge.
Until recently, scientists literally heard
what was happening, for they followed
the passage of atomic materials through
plants or machines, or even the human
body, with a clicking Geiger counter.
Now a more sensitive instrument—a new
scintillation counter made possible by a
development of RCA Laboratories—can
do the job more efficiently.
Heart of this counter is a new multiplier
phototube, so sensitive that it can react to
the light of a firefly 250 feet away! In the
scintillation counter, tiny flashes, set off by
the impact of atomic particles on a fluores-
cent crystal, are converted into pulses of
electrical current and multiplied as much as
a million times by this tube.

power to the shaper circuit and the spark
source, and — 150-volt regulated bias for
the spark source; the spark source power
supply, which supplies + 600-00 volts
plate voltage to the spark source; and the
pulse amplifier shaper, which takes the
received ion pulse, amplifies it, and shapes
it into a short pulse which is fed to the
synchroscope.
The synchroscope indicator chassis
generates a 100 c.p.s. circular sweep of
200-microsecond duration initiated by the
spark gap trigger pulse, and a 100 c.p.s.
pulse of 5-microsecond duration to trigger
the sparkling circuit; it also indicates
elapsed time between spark gap break-
down and ion collection on the circular
sweep. If the distance between gap and
detector is kept constant, the circular
sweep of the indicator can be calibrated
directly in air speed.
The spark source and detector ampli-
fier generate a high voltage pulse of
around 1-microsecond duration which,
when applied to a 1/16-inch point elec-
trode spark gap, is sufficient to fire the
gap. It detects the passing ion pulse by
electrostatic induction and amplifies it be-
fore sending it to the amplifier shaper cir-
cuit. Tests on the instrument have shown
that the ion pulse was spread out consider-
ably at low air velocities and was very
narrow at high velocities. A certain level
of the leading edge of the pulse was
chosen as the basis of measurement. To
select this level consistently it is necessary
to have sufficient amplitude of signal to
insure saturation of the amplifier and
shaper circuits. This instrument can be
used in high speed aircraft, but such work
must be done to reduce the weight.
Another factor which must be consid-
ered in the design of electronic indicators
is the possibility of corona discharge and
arc-over. Corona discharge occurs when
the intensity of the field around a piece of
electronic equipment exceeds the strength
of the surrounding dielectric. Since the
dielectric strength of air decreases with
decreasing temperature and pressure, ap-
paratus is more vulnerable to this dis-
turbance at high altitudes. Corona dis-
charge might be minimized by working
with lower voltages, but this would re-
quire redesign of other elements in the
circuit.
5. Conclusions
Supersonic flight has produced major
changes in the field of aircraft instrumen-
tation. The measurement of air speed in
particular has required the development
of entirely new techniques at supersonic
levels. To meet these new demands, in-
strumentation engineers have turned to
electronics. The compactness and light-
ness of electronic equipment make it
readily adaptable to aircraft instrumenta-
tion it also lends itself well to remote
measurement of conditions in guided mis-
siles and pilotless aircraft. The fixed-
course technique is well suited to the high-
accuracy requirements of research. The
direct-reading indicator is adversely af-
fected by corona discharge at high alti-
tudes, but will serve nicely if this diffi-
culty can be overcome. Further develop-
ments are to be expected, and new de-
vices will be conceived, but electronics
are sure to play an important role in the
future of aircraft instrumentation.
Modern power applications call for leather, too
There was something mighty
impressive about those old-
time woodshed sessions with
Dad's leather razor strop. Dad
had a very effective way of put-
ting power to work via leather.
Here's the modern way to
transmit power by leather in
industry. The tension-control
motor base puts the inherent
power-carrying advantage of
leather to work in compact
space. The base plus the "sin-
gle-pull" leather belt make a
drive package that is "right"
for many vital spots in today's
industry.

THE TECHNIC PRESENTS
(Continued from page 14)
... DAVID ENGIBOUS, president of the
local chapter of AlChE.
The day of June 19, 1927 saw the
population of Norway, Mich., enlarged
by one David Engibous, destined to be a
person of whom the little town of Nor-
way could be very proud.

DAVID ENGIBOUS
For example, Dave was president of
his senior class in high school, and, as
Dave puts it ". . . Oh yes, I was valedic-
torian, too."
After graduation in June, 1945, Dave,
following the pattern of the times, joined
the armed services—the Navy to be ex-
act. He served as a radio technician,
spending most of his service time at
Corpus Christi, Texas. (Incidentally,
Dave thinks Texas is a fine state—for
Texans.)
It was his contact with the electrical
field in the Navy that decided Dave on
the career of a chemical engineer, he says.
At any rate, he began study in this field
at the U. of M. in September, 1946.
In addition to his membership in
AIChE, Dave is also a member of Alpha
Chi Sigma, the professional chemical en-
gineers and chemists fraternity, Phi
Lambda Upsilon, the honorary chemical
fraternity, Phi Eta Sigma, and Tau Beta
Pi. As if this weren't enough, Dave has
also been a Student Assistant in C. M. 2
since Fall, 1948.
As far as hobbies are concerned, Dave
likes to play bridge, but, given the chance,
would rather hunt or fish in his native
Upper Peninsula.
.. . GEORGE S. MATSON, commodore
of the Quarterdeck Society.
Among those receiving their B.S. de-
gree in Naval Architecture in August of
this year will be a 29 year old student
from Jackson, Mich.—George S. Matson.
Although it seems like a long time ago,
George remembers playing baseball and
basketball during his years at Jackson
High School. A little clearer to his mem-
ory, however, is the four years service in
the Navy as a quartermaster in China and
the Philippines.
Leaving the Navy in 1946, George en-
tered Jackson Junior College and took
basic engineering courses there for two
years before entering the U. of M. in the
Summer of 1948.
George brought a great deal of techni-
cal experience to Michigan with him since
he served a five-year apprenticeship to the
Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry-
dock Company of Newport News, Vir-
ginia from 1939 to 1944. His drafting
work there helped decide George on en-
tering the naval architecture and marine
engineering field, and he hopes to go into
ship design after graduation.

GEORGE S. MATSON
Besides his position in the Quarterdeck
Society, George is a member of the Engi-
neering Council and is presently engaged
in placing pencil sharpeners in strategic
locations about the engineering buildings
under the sponsorship of the Engineering
Council.
George's main hobby is sailing, which
he pursued while at Newport News, hav-
ing a twenty-five foot yawl on Chesapeake
Bay.

industry and education has been develop-
ed by RCA Laboratories, Princeton, N.J.
Described as the smallest and simplest
system ever devised for non-broadcast,
industrial television operations, the new
RCA system is based on a remarkably
small and sensitive pickup tube known as
the Vidicon. The system consists solely
of two units—a television camera approxi-
mating the size of a personal 16 milli-
meter movie camera and a master control
monitor that can be carried as easily as a
suitcase.
Two separate phases were involved in
the development of this system. First
came the building of the Vidicon pickup
tube, which operates on the principle of
photoconductivity, rather than employing
photoemissive cells as used by the image
orthicon, the orthicon and other pickup
tubes serving as the electronic "eyes" of
conventional television cameras. The sec-
ond phase consisted of engineering and
designing the camera and monitoring-con-
trol unit.

The Vidicon tube, less than a tenth of
the size of the image orthicon, is able to
transmit black-and-white pictures at nor-
mal lighting levels and to attain a resolu-
tion of more than 500 lines. The system
can be adapted to produce pictures in
natural colors.
The camera tube contains only an elec-

(Continued from page 15)
tron gun and a target, as constrasted with
gun, two-sided target, image section and
electron multipliers of the image orthicon
tube. Ordinary 16 mm. motion uicture
lenses will work satisfactorily with the
Vidicon, which is only one inch in diam-
eter and six inches long.
The operation of the new tube is as
follows:
In the Vidicon, light—representing ele-
ments in the picture being picked up—
passes through the glass face of the tube,
then through a transparent coating on the
inside of the tube which forms the signal
plate. The light then strikes the photo-
conductive target which, on the side next
to the signal plate, carried a positive
charge of from 10 to 30 volts.
The inside surface of the photocon-
ductive target is maintained at ground
potential, or zero voltage, by electrons de-
posited on it by the scanning beam. Be-
cause the target material is an insulator,
very little current flows while it remains
dark.
When light strikes the target, it in-
creases the conductivity of the material
sufficiently to permit a charge to flow
across the target and to charge the light-
struck area a volt or two positive in the
l/30th of a second between successive
scans.
As the scanning beam deposits enough
electrons to neutralize this accumulated
charge, it generates the video signal,
which is taken off the metal lead ring at-
tached to the signal plate. Finally, this
signal passes by cable to the monitor-
control unit, where the image is viewed.
The RCA industrial television camera
is 10 inches long, 3 inches wide and 5
inches high and has a remote focusing
mount, which permits the operator to ad-
just optical focus by remote control from
the master unit.
The master control unit of the system
is 26]/2 inches long, 17 inches high, 8l/2
inches wide and weighs 60 pounds. It
contains a regulated power supply, small
synchronizing signal generator, a video
amplifier strip, and all the scanning de-
flection equipment for both the camera
and its own 7-inch monitoring kinescope.
All controls for the operation of the
system are within the monitor. Three
knobs control the brightness, contrast and
blanking (black level) of the monitor
itself. Controls for the television cam-
era's beam intensity, electronic focus and
optical focus are also included on the
monitor panel.
The monitor will drive a 71-ohm line
at approximately 2 volts for distances up
to 300 feet. Since the scanning frequency
of 525 lines, 60 frames interlaced, is the
same as that employed for broadcast tele-
vision, it is possible to use standard tele-
vision receivers as additional monitors by
adding a one-tube amplifier.

bilities for utilizing the new RCA system.
In a laboratory, details of dangerous oper-
ations and experiments are brought closer
to observers without endangering life, but
with an increase in efficiency through more
precise control. One man at the monitor
may watch a number of indicators on
widely separated equipments in order
properly to synchronize operations or to
regulate processing and output. Indus-
trial television offers further usefulness
in the inspection of the interior of cylin-
ders, cannon bores and tanks, as well as
oil-well casings, factory chimneys and
grain elevators. In addition, it may be
used to observe conditions in furnaces, de-
struction tests or to analyze combustion
products of jet engines and rockets.

YOUR BEARING NOTEBOOK

Crankshafts stay rigid
• • • foods stay frigid
Designers of a compressor for refrigeration plants
were looking for a way to insure smooth, depend-
able crankshaft operation. They couldn't risk the
chance of breakdowns—and the food spoilage that
might result.
They stopped possible trouble at the design stage
—by mounting the crankshafts on Timken® tapered
roller bearings. Timken bearings take the heavy
radial, thrust and combination loads, prevent shaft
wobble, insure trouble-free service with minimum
maintenance.
Q: Short on space?
A: TIMKEN® bearings!
Because Timken bearings have a tapered design,
they carry loads from all directions. No separate
thrust devices needed. Also, Timken bearings have
line contact between rolls and races. This gives
them greater load capacity, permits use of smaller
bearings. The space-saving feature is another reason
why 9 out of 10 bearing applications can be handled
more efficiently by Timken bearings.

PROBLEM — You are designing a machine which
includes a number of electrical accessories any one
of which can be turned on by means of a rotary
switch. For reasons of assembly and wiring this
switch has to be centrally located inside the machine.
Your problem is to provide a means of operating the
switch from a convenient outside point. How would
you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER — Use an S.S.White re-
mote control type flexible shaft to connect the switch
to its control knob. This arrangement gives you com-
plete freedom in placing both the switch and the
control knob anywhere you want them. That's the
way one manufacturer does it in the view below of
part of the equipment with cover removed.

This is just one of hundreds of remote control and power
drive problems to which S.S.White flexible shafts provide
a simple answer. That's why every engineer should be
familiar with these "Metal Muscles"* for mechanical bodies.

twist has been added recently, however, with the announcement
of the Durant model PVR Stroke Printing Counter. As in the
conventional counter, there is a reading line on which the total
number of cycles appears as on an automobile speedometer.
In addition, there is a slot into which a time or production card
may be inserted, and a printing lever. When the lever is de-
pressed, a second set of recording drums prints the number of
cycles completed on the card, which may then be used to deter-
mine production, compute costs, or whatever may be desired.
A lock clutch is provided on the reset mechanism to prevent
enterprising operators from fulfilling their quotas by tampering
with the counter.
Energy "Store"
The flywheel principle, one of the first to satisfy man's need
for ways to "store" energy, is still finding clever and unusual ap-
plication. For example, a motor-generator set recently built for
a leading coal company utilies this age-old principle to allow
more reliable service for a coal-mine man hoist.
The m-g, which consists of a 125-kw d-c generator, a 7^2*^*'
exciter, and a 200-hp wound-rotor motor, has attached to its
shaft a five-ton flywheel that will store 18,400 hp-seconds of
energy. The flywheel is so designed that in case of a-c power
failure, the dc- power can be maintained long enough for the
hoist to complete its trip. According to engineering calculations,
this flywheel will store enough energy at full speed to allow ap-

Varnish paints a grim picture inside an engine.
Oxidation of motor oil under operating condi-
tions is largely responsible for varnish accumu-
lations which result in sticking rings and valves,
sluggish pistons, loss of power.
The varnish problem, however, has been all
but conquered by Standard Oil lubricants. To-
day our heavy-duty and premium-type oils
contain additives—oxidation inhibitors plus
detergents that keep engines cleaner, keep them
running longer and enable them to deliver
more power.
We learn about these additives and what they
will do by subjecting our oils to a variety of
tests. For example, we devised the Indiana
Stirring Oxidation Test (which is performed on
the machine in the picture) to provide data
that would help solve the varnish problem. It
is helping solve that problem. Other tests are
leading to other improvements.
Behind all the tests are the men of Standard
Oil. It is their obligation never to be satisfied
—to believe that improvements are not only
possible but necessary. Thus they maintain
this company's leadership in research, and help
provide our customers with products that stead-
ily increase in quality and usefulness.

proximately one and a half round trips of
the hoist. This means that if a-c power
failed immediately when a full cage load
of men was started to the surface from
the bottom of the shaft, the energy stored
in the flywheel would be sufficient to
bring the hoist to the top, lower the
empty cage, and bring up another load
before the flywheel dropped to half speed.
The exciter on the flywheel set is controll-
ed by a voltage regulator designed to
maintain full voltage at all speeds be-
tween 1200 and 600 rpm.
As an indication that the same flywheel
principle applied to the coal-mine man
hoist has many other applications, con-
sider its use as a "landing strip" by Air
Force engineers.
In trying to learn what happens to air-
plane tires when a plane lands, these engi-
neers decided that the logical way to do
this would be to simulate a landing, but
with a moving landing strip instead of a
moving plane. A huge flywheel, driven
by a 150-hp motor, will replace the run-
way. When an airplane tire is pushed
against the flywheel it will get the same
initial shock that it would experience in a
real-life landing. Applying the brakes
will be accomplished by slowing down the
flywheel—the tire gets the same wear.
And by varying the speed of the motor,
engineers can compensate for such things
as wind resistance and rolling friction.
This ingenious solution to what could be
a major testing problem will enable the
Air Force to test the reaction of tires at
speeds up to at least 250 mph.
DuPont Makes Scents
One major objection to rubber goods,
particularly in such applications as foam
rubber mattresses and pillows, has been
that they smell like rubber. This can cut
sales sharply if, as is generally the case,
the customers don't like the smell of rub-
ber. All attempts to de-odorize the ma-
terial have failed, but now Du Pont has
developed an "odorant" which can be
added to the rubber before processing and
will replace the well known aroma with
the scene of "Mountain air after a sum-
mer shower." It is claimed that these
odorants can also be used successfully
with some plastics.

A new member has been added recently
to the cellophane family of films. The
newcomer is a transparent thermoplastic
called polyphene, and is now available to
manufacturers in both cut-to-size sheets
and rolls.
This lightest of all the plastic films is
very tough and strong, which makes it
particularly adaptable for wrapping heavy
textiles, such as bolts and cloth, blankets
and sheets. It is also waterproof. One of
the first "wet packaging" uses, outside of
the food field, to which polyphene was
put was in pouches for sachets—oil-im-
pregnated pads—for applying permanent
waves by the machine method. Because
it is chemically inert, the material has
proven equally successful for packaging
fertilizers, dyes, washing powers, and
acid and alkaline compounds that are
harmful to most other films.
Furthermore, it combines moisture-
proofness and strength at very low tem-
peratures for the packaging of frozen
foods for the Armed Forces at very low
arctic temperatures. It also protects metal
parts from rusting in damp atmospheres.

Industrial Photography
Photography in industry accounts for
more than two-thirds of the photographic
materials used today, W. F. Swann, a
member of Eastman Kodak Company's in-
dustrial sales division, reports in the first
issue of Photographic Science and Tech-
nique. The other third is used by amateur
photographers.
Industrial photography is of three
kinds: data-recording, photo-analysis and
photo-reproduction.
The ability of an ordinary camera and
camera technique to estimate the volume
of pulpwood in stock piles is an unusual
industrial use cited by Swann.
By using a high-contrast photographic
material, a flat car full of wood is photo-
graphed. Spaces between the logs are
produced as black areas. The faces of the
logs become white areas. A special photo-
electric scanning machine is then used to
evaluate the [ratio] of light areas to dark
areas and, assuming the length of the logs
to be standard, an accurate estimate of
the total volume of wood may be ob-
tained.
Largest Circular Film
Seventy dozen of the largest circular
photographic plates ever used by astron-
omers were rushed to completion by East-
man Kodak research scientists. The infra-
red and -blue sensitive plates will be used
on the "Hub of the Universe" expedition
of Harvard University astronomers, which
sailed for South Africa in February.
A team of Harvard astronomers will
use the plates with a new-type telescope
and the world's largest objective prism
to study more than one million stars and
other interstellar bodies in the Milky
Way.
The astronomers will use the new
telescope to photograph the center por-
tion of the Milky Way, more than 30,000
light years from the earth. Present tele-
scopes have been limited to detailed
explorations of stars less than 10,000 light
years distant.
The special plates are IQi/^ inches in
diameter. Largest present circular plates
used are 7% inches in diameter.
The plates are coated with emulsion
especially sensitive to light of different
colors and long exposure to faint light.

the study of actual exposure to weather in proving
ground and in the field, they have a definite place in

may be the only engineering operation in-
volved. Modern industry is, however,
highly mechanized so by and large indus-
try and engineering are for practical pur-
poses synonomous.
The relation of plant engineering to
other branches of engineering in industry
is best shown by reference to a typical
manufacturing plant which will involve
in some degree:
1. Research or Experimental Engineering
concerned with finding better ways to
do things. This may be further sub-
divided into two parts: First, basic re-
search concerned with pure science
and which may have or may not have
an immediate commercial value; sec-
ond, applied or industrial research
concerned with some commercial
product, development or improvement.
2. Product Engineering concerned with
the design of products or processes
for production or commercial exploi-
tation.
3. Industrial Engineering concerned with
equipment and methods of commercial
(Continued from page 13)
production. This is sometimes sub-
divided into: Manufacturing Engi-
neering concerned with the planning
and improvements of processes, meth-
ods and equipment; and, Industrial
Engineering proper concerned with
the analysis and standardization of
labor, material and overhead.
4. Plant Engineering concerned with the
planning, installation and mainten-
ance of utility services, machines,
tools, equipment, buildings and
grounds, in fact, all physical aspects
of overall plant operation, except
product design and production.
5. Management Engineering concerned
with the application of engineering
principles and analysis to the handling
of men, materials, machines and
money. Practically, this is primarily a
consulting function of considerable
importance in industry.
While the above classifications definite-
ly place a plant engineer in the industrial
setup, it does not outline too fully his
duties. The Dictionary of Occupational
Titles, used by the United States Em-
ployment Service, lists these duties as:
"PLANT ENGINEER (profess. &amp; kin.).
A MECHANICAL ENGINEER. Designs
new equipment or improvements to old;
makes plant layouts and changes in proc-
essing methods; supervises, directly or
through subordinates, the maintenance of
plant buildings, and equipment, ref.
CARPENTER, MAINTENANCE; MA-
CHINIST; MAINTENANCE ME-
CHANIC; MASTER MECHANIC,
MAINTENANCE; contracts for the
building of additions to the plant, or for
the installation of new machines and
equipment and supervises the execution of
the contracts; tests newly installed ma-
chines and equipment to insure fulfillment
of contract specifications."
This job specification is not as com-
plete nor as comprehensive as that shown
under the "You Do" column in Pic Maga-
zine, and is somewhat narrower in con-
cept than general industrial practice today
indicates.

With the development of Neoprene Type W
Science Again Outpoints Mure

Motor mountings, wiro and cable, tponge, gaskets, swim caps
among possible uses for Du Pont't now Nooprono Typo W.
NEOPRENE —the chloroprene rub-
ber produced by Du Pont research-
has long outpointed natural rubber
on many counts. Because of its greater
resistance to chemicals, flame, heat,
sunlight, weathering, oxidation, oils,
grease and abrasion, it is widely used
in such products as industrial hose,
conveyor and transmission belts, in-
sulated wire and cable, hospital sheet-
ing, gloves and automotive parts.
Until recently, however, certain
natural rubber compositions couldn't
be beaten when it came to "perma-
nent set" characteristics. Released
from the pressure of prolonged de-
formation, they returned more nearly
to their original shape.
This recovery factor is important
to some manufacturers, particularly
the people who make gaskets, seals,
diaphragms, sheet packing, soft rolls
and vibration-dampening devices.
NEW PRODUCT NEEDED
Much as they wanted to use neo-
prene because of its other superiori-
ties, they often needed more resist-
ance to permanent deformation than
it afforded. So they used natural rub-
ber, but were never quite satisfied
with the way it resisted deteriora-
tion in severe service.
Du Pont scientists went to work
to solve the problem. Skilled research
chemists, physicists, engineers and
others pooled their efforts. The re-
sult was a new polymer named Neo-
prene Type W.
NEOPRENE TYPE W INTRODUCED
Chemically, the new neoprene !••
quite similar to previous types. But

Du Pont't laboratories which participated in tho
development of Nooprono Typo W.
its molecular structure has been
changed so that the mechanical prop-
erties of its compositions are more
nearly like those of rubber. With
Neoprene Type W, it is possible to
producevibration-dampeningdevices
that are not only highly resistant to
oils, heat, grease and sunlight, but
recover better than rubber from pro-
longed pressure.
Neoprene Type W also provides
the basis for compositions that have
a low modulus of elasticity—are easy
to stretch. More attractive colors are
possible. Soon it may appear in such
articles as swim caps, where bright
colors and head comfort are impor-
tant. The brighter-colored composi-
tions should also appeal to makers
of appliance cords, coasters, sink
mats, stove mats and toys.
In developing the uses of Neoprene
Type W, Du Pont is working with
hundreds of manufacturers and dis-
tributors. Once again a "partner-
ship" of big and small businesses will
cooperate to give Americans the
benefits of an advance in science.

Design, construction and maintenance
of buildings and grounds is, of course, a
matter of primary concern, not only from
the standpoint of shelter but from the
standpoint of production costs, industrial
health, public relations and safety. Mater-
ials handling alone may range from 10 to
over 50 per cent of production costs and
in certain industries dominates the build-
ing design problem. Heating, ventilating,
air conditioning and the control of smoke
and fumes is of ever increasing import-
ance. Parking lots, cafeterias, sanitary
and convenience provisions for personnel,
security and the guard force and fire pro-
tection are essential and increasing in
importance as the necessity for industrial
relations is more fully recognized.
Because of the large amount of power
used in modern industry, utility design,
installation and operation is of prime im-
portance. This includes electric light and
power, steam, compressed air, water and
sewer service. These often involve con-
tact with outside concerns and very fre-
quently with municipalities.
Repair services must be provided and
machinery planned, installed, repaired
and lubricated. Instruments and controls
must be provided. Traffic inside and
outside the plants planned for.
To minimize production delays, preven-
tive maintenance programs must be ini-
tiated and an adequate stock of repair
parts ordered and stored ready for use.
Elevators must be operated and house-
keeping carefully watched. The im-
portance of housekeeping in the modern
plant is indicated by the fact that the
janitor force in industry averages ap-
proximately 3 per cent of the total em-
ployment and runs to 12 per cent in some
industries.
The plant engineer thus has respon-
sibility for the multitude of details neces-
sary to keep the plant operating efficiently.
He operates "a business within a busi-
ness" and his work covers every depart-
ment and every activity so he must have a
working knowledge of all processes. Much
of his work is covered by various state
and municipal codes and he deals in in-
surance and labor relations so he must
know some law and be a diplomat. He
must be a good manager and keep costs
down so he must know something of
economics, cost accounting, and sound in-
dustrial organization. He is the original
trouble shooter, the eternal fixer of other
people's difficulties.
Organizationwise the plant engineer
fits into the large industrial unit as a staff
member of the general manager on a par
with the controller, sales manager, etc. In
a single plant unit he will fit into the
plant manager's organization as a de-
partment head on par with the produc-
tion superintendent, quality control mana-
ger, industrial engineer, purchasing agent,
etc. The size of a plant engineering de-
partment will vary from a half dozen in
a small organization up to over 2000 in
large organizations.
Many individuals have an aversion to
large organizations. Numerically, how-
ever, large operating units are compara-
tively few. In the 21 groups classified as

He uses yg of the earth's elements in his cooking
If you've always thought of glass simply as a
substance made of sand, soda, and lime,
we believe this will surprise you:
Corning scientists, such as the one you
see here cooking up a batch of experimental
glass, have actually made glass using 84 of
the earth's presently known 96 elements.
Nearly 3000 of these experimental glass
compositions are turned out every year, as
Corning scientists search for new and use-
ful ways to combine nature's elements.
Already Corning has developed more
than 50,000 formulas for glass. Just as al-
loys make metals more useful, these 50,000
formulas make glass more useful—enlarg-
ing its applications in untold and sometimes
surprising ways.
Corning makes glass so strong that it can
be used as piping in a steel mill. Corning
makes glass so soft that it can be melted
with a match—and glass so resistant to
thermal shock that it can be heated to a
cherry red, then plunged into ice water with-
out its breaking.
Today, throughout industry. Corning
means research in glass—research which,
along with a multitude of other develop-
ments, has made glass one of today's most
versatile engineering materials.
Corning is constantly turning up new kinds
of glass, new uses for existing ones. So when
you're out of college, and concerned with
product or process improvement, it will pay
you to call on Corning before your plan-
ning reaches the blueprint stage. Corning

manufacturing industries, the Social Se-
curity Board lists 216,610 reporting units.
Only 22,416 units employ over 100, how-
ever, and of these but 2207 have over
1000 employees. Approximately half of
these 2207 are in four industry groups:
(1) Transportation Equipment (except
automobiles); (2) Iron and Steel and
their Products; (3) Machinery (except
electrical) ; and (4) Electrical machinery.
Thus the number of large units is ex-
tremely limited, for even 1000 employees
is not what might be considered an unduly
large plant. The larger organizations, of
course, employ more engineers, frequently
recruit vigorously and usually provide
some training. That is, they have the re-
sources to look ahead, plan ahead and
train an organization. Many of the smaller
organizations find it expedient to go out-
side their own organization, when neces-
sary, and employ experienced men.
For a student or recent graduate, a
large organization may therefore, be ad-
vantageous, especially to start. Better
training, experience in a large organiza-
tion and the possible opportunities of a
wider experience offer certain advantages.
Again these organizations usually have a
policy of upgrading or promotion within
their own organization. At the same time,
a large organization will tend toward
specialization and give less all-around ex-
perience. This may lead into a cul-de-sac
from which it is difficult to escape, for a
man with specialized and limited experi-
ence may have difficulty in locating a suit-
able opening in another concern.
Many individuals have decided geo-
graphical likes and dislikes. This is a fac-
tor which must be considered when choos-
ing a career, for roughly 60 per cent of
American industry is concentrated in the
triangle formed roughly by Chicago, Bal-
timore and Boston. While industry, espe-
cially small industry, is well scattered over
the 48 states, those who insist on certain
locations will have less choice.
Industrial plants, however, are not the
only field for the plant engineer. Many
service industries such as hospitals, hotels,
office buildings, laundries, bakeries, ware-
houses, colleges, universities and other
institutions offer a field of endeavor
nearly as large.
Finally, while the basic elements of
engineering may be learned in colleges,
plant engineers are made on the job.
There is no substitute for varied practical
experience, a certain degree of manual
skill and some knowledge of the artisan
trades. Little of a plant engineer's work
is routine—much of it depends upon the
"feel" of materials and forces. This
"feel" or "instinct" comes through doing
things, it helps avoid blunders when
faced with new conditions; helps the boss
sense what his men are doing; and builds
their confidence in him. A few months
spent in varied construction and industrial
maintenance work will pay dividends in
later years.

Facts like that should hearten you, when you wonder

days of electrical transmission.
Today, nearly half the high-tension lines that feed those
appliances are made of Alcoa Aluminum. Nearly two
million miles of ACSR (aluminum cable steel reinforced).
Although it was light, and corrosion resistant, and con-
ductive, nobody wanted to make aluminum into cable,
at the beginning. All right, we said—we'd do it. We
launched a long research project to produce purer metal,
and made the basic changes in our reduction processes
that the research finally indicated. We built a cable-
testing laboratory long enough to mount whole spans of
cable, and vibrate them as the wind does, to check
fatigue strength. This was hard, discouraging work, and
it took most of the lifetimes of a good many Alcoa people.
But today aluminum high-lines cross the Great Bear in
Canada, and funnel Grand Coulee's power into millions

it ends at 11:00 because we have to go
home sometime. It is an open forum,
devoted entirely to rapid-fire questions
and answers about the very things these
articles are trying to cover. Should one
return for graduate work? Should he do
so right away, or get some experience
first? Does a rolling stone gather any
moss, or anything else? What about these
training programs? What are present
starting rates? What to do when an
outside offer comes to a man already em-
ployed: These are lengthy matters. This
article has no room for discussing them.
If you want to hear them talked about,
you are welcome to attend the conference.

readers will let me know their wishes.

about it at the same time. It would be
up to him, you know.
Seniors—Live and Otherwise

begin. A large share of the things he
wants to know are common to the whole
senior class. It is out of the question for
any faculty member to find time to dish
out the answers to individual seniors.
Hence bulletin board service. And then
comes the test. When a senior drops in
along about May and innocently asks some
question that reveals he has not kept
himself posted, and when discussion re-
veals the fact that he first heard of the
job conference the day after it was over,
we know we are dealing with a man who
has been sound asleep. If he does not
promptly come to life and catch onto
things in a hurry, we fear he may be in
for a series of disappointments for some
time to come.
Keep In Touch
Soon after graduating, send a copy of
your personal record back to your faculty
placement officer. As soon as you get
that job, let him know. Get out of the
way, and let him concentrate on your un-
employed classmate. Once a year or so,
drop him a letter, bringing yourself up
to date. (Ask him to file your letter
without bothering to answer it: maybe,
if he has a spare moment, he'll answer it
anyway.) In a few years he will have a
complete file on you. Since you will be
one of the few who really do this, he will
reach for you first when something nice
shows up.
While on one job, if you ever decide
that you want to make a change, you must
be particularly sure to inform your faculty
member about it. He does not, for sev-
eral reasons, wish to bother you with
offers in the usual case. He should and
will let you alone when your present op-
portunities are as good where you are as
it seems they would be elsewhere. More-
over, your company will properly resent it
if we or anyone else are continually bring-
ing offers to your attention. Experienced
men know that a good share of a year's
productive effort can be seriously upset, if
full consideration is given to but two or
three good offers a year. When you really
wish to make a change, tell somebody
about it.

EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
It has come to the attention
of the TECHNIC editors that
some false and misleading infor-
mation is being circulated in the
offices of the Michigan Daily
and in other dens of iniquity.
The story is being told that the
TECHNIC editors wouldn't let the
Engineering Council censor their
editorials and are going to peti-
tion to come under the Board of
Publication. Further that the
joke page, which was deleted for
the last three issues of this year,
caused a major crisis in the
Technic offices. Nothing could
be further from the truth.
In the first place, the Engi-
neering Council has NO CON-
TROL WHATEVER over the ac-
tivities of the TECHNIC. Second-
ly, we have not and do not in-
tend to petition to come under
the control of the Board of Pub-
lications. We could want noth-
ing less. The joke page, while
causing a stir in our offices, was
not of the proportions which
have been so vividly described
by some of the Daily's top brass.
So, it all boils down to the fact
of poor reporting. We feel that
if the Board of Publications is
going to be told that we want to
come under its control, we want
to do the telling. Again we state
that we have no intention of do-
ing so.
We on the staff of the TECH-
NIC feel proud of our magazine
since we are self-supporting and
even manage to put something in
the pot for a rainy day. We have
had a minimum of control over
our editorial content. The only
censoring done has been that of
FALSE RUMOR
the joke page. The rest of our
copy including editorials has not
and is not being censored.
We would like to say to the
Daily personnel who so glibly
discuss our problems—find out
what you are talking about.
HONOR CODE
Many freshmen and transfer
students coming to the University
for the first time are skeptical of
this "Honor System." The old
cliche that "the profs have the
honor and the students have the
system" is brought out by the
skeptics to discredit the Honor
Code.
We admit that the Honor
Code has faults, but these faults
are human faults which can only
be eliminated as the human being
becomes perfect.
One of the most distasteful
jobs that has to be performed by
the Honor Council is that of
recommending that a fellow stu-
dent be dropped from the Uni-
versity because he cheated on an
examination. Also this phase of
the Honor Council's activity is
the least publicized.
The Honor Code is working.
In a recent poll conducted by the
staff of the MICHIGAN TECHNIC,
it was found that approximately
85% of the students questioned
felt that they were honestly liv-
ing up to the Honor Code. Sev-
eral of the people who said they
did not feel that they were com-
plying because they felt the pro-
fessors made unfair demands
under the Honor Code.
Even with its inherent faults,
the Honor Code is still on the
credit side of the ledger. To be
able to take examinations with-
out proctors and in a state of
comparative relaxation is a privi-
lege not to be taken lightly.
FACULTY EVALUATION
In a previous editorial in the
TECHNIC we brought to your at-
tention several of the comments
of professors regarding the Fac-
ulty Evaluation Program. Since
that time several faculty mem-
bers and students have volunteer-
ed their opinions. Two opposite
views are held on the matter.
The student view is that the
faculty should be graded as often
as practicable. The faculty view
is to have the evaluations not
oftener than every five years if at
all.
We were pleased to find the
objectivity with which the stu-
dents discussed grading their
professors. There will be a few
disgruntled individuals who will
let their emotions guide their
comments, but on the whole the
students will give honest and
sincere criticism. We do not
wish to hire or fire anyone by
this evaluation, nor do we pro-
pose to turn teaching into a
popularity contest. We do, how-
ever, ask for the faculty evalua-
tion to be instituted as a regular
yearly program. The actual work
of distribution can be done by
the various honoraries.
The Faculty Evaluation Pro-
gram fills a real need and should
be welcomed by the faculty. The
members of the faculty who have
done a good job need have no
fear of it and the ones who did
not do a good job should fear it.

*TPHE automobile industry smashed
records again in 1949 as it produced
6,250,000 new passenger cars and trucks
—more than in any other year in history.
This terrific output of the finest cars ever
made climaxed a phenomenal rise in
production that began at the war's end.
These new cars by the millions are a
tribute to the American way of life.
Their production is the result of the de-
mands of people working under the
American system of free enterprise,
which has produced the highest living
standard the world has ever known.
Millions of tons of steel of almost
every type and form helped America's
auto makers boost their production so
amazingly high . . . helped the quality of
today's automobiles keep pace with the
quantity. In fact, many new steels have
been developed just to meet the exacting
requirements of present-day production.
In spite of record-breaking production,
the automobile industry's job is far from
finished—the average age of the cars on
America's highways today is 8.4 years.
Continuing demands for vast quanti-
ties of steel from the automobile indus-
try and from countless other sources
mean a big job for the steel industry in
coming years . . . mean a promising
future for men who make steel their
career. To assure itself management men
of the highest caliber, United States
Steel maintains a continuous training
program that prepares young men with
suitable backgrounds for places in this
great industry.

In case of fire, your chances might not be too good in
many hospitals today.
Each day there are three fires of record in hospitals
and institutions, and in those where fatalities occur
an average of five lives are lost per fire! Isn't this proof
positive that many trusted precautions are not ade-
quate protection at all?
Unfortunately, too many people responsible for pro-
tection rely completely upon the elimination of ordi-
nary fire hazards, important as this is. All too many
more depend upon "fireproof construction. Two facts
show this to be false confidence: "Carelessness with
matches and in smoking" continues to be the greatest
cause of fires . . . and so-called "fireproof buildings
continue to become furnaces for flammable contents.
What most people ignore is that, regardless of the
cause of fire, regardless of the building construction,
it is the proper control of fire from the first spark that
constitutes full and adequate protection against fire.
Needless loss of life and property can be prevented by
checking fire at its source, whenever and wherever it
starts, night or day, automatically, with a Grinnell
Automatic Sprinkler System. Seventy years experi-
ence shows that practically 100% of fires starting in
buildings protected by Grinnell Automatic Sprinkler
Systems are extinguished before doing material dam-
age. Fire experts will tell you that your best protec-
tion against fire in any building is automatic sprinklers.
flOOK FOR THE CRINNELL SPRINKLER HEADS ON GUARD
In hospitals, as well as in hotels, theaters and factories,
there is a moral obligation upon management for the ut-
most in protection of life. For your own sake ask about
it in your hospital or the hotel where you stop, the schools
your youngsters attend, the plant in which you work.
Everywhere, look for the famous Grinnell Sprinkler
heads — your assurance of positive fire protection.

SHOULD AN OIL COMPANY BE?
HERE IS A STRAIGHT ANSWER FROM ONE OF THE OLDEST
COMPANIES IN THE INDUSTRY:
Socony-Vacuum is the size that it is — neither the biggest nor the
smallest in the Petroleum Industry — because it is an efficient size
for the kind of business we do.
Efficiency is the key to a company's size — for it is the key to what
the American public wants, the most for its petroleum dollar.
Under the American system of business, a company that operates
inefficiently soon loses business to other companies able to offer the
public more value at lower cost. That's how American competition
works — and if any company gets so big that efficiencies inherent in
mass operation are more than offset by increasing costs — competition
will cut that company to a proper size.
To put it another way:
A company is as strong as its competitive efficiency —
In turn, an industry is as strong as its companies —
And in turn, a nation is as strong as its industries.
Thus, every company, big or little, must be
"big" enough to serve the best interests of the
people in the area it covers! \

All life depends either directly or in-
directly upon sunlight. This fact has long
been realized since the time of the early
Egyptians who worshiped the sun to the
present day as engineers attempt to pro-
duce the solar radiations artificially. These
present efforts are the result of years of
research by scientists in learning about
the radiations of the sun. This research
has paved the way for work in recent
years to promote the development of
these radiations under controlled condi-
tions, conveniently and economically so
as to make the phrase "twenty-four hours
of sunshine" a reality.
The research in this field has shown
that sunlight is a form of electromagnetic
energy, and therefore has wave motion.
The effects of sunlight can thus be studied
in terms of the wavelength which pro-
duce them. Their study is facilitated by
the use of prisms and diffraction gratings
which analyze the solar spectrum that
ranges from the low frequency, invisible
infrared or heat rays, through the visible
range—red, orange, yellow, green, blue,
and violet—to the high frequency, in-
visible ultraviolet radiations.
By studying the effect of each wave-
length of sunlight, it has been found that
light of 5200 Angstroms wavelength, for
example, produces a sensation of green to
the human eye while other wavelengths
provoke different responses. (Fig. 1) As
a standard of measurement, the wave-
length of the radiation is used and is
measured in Angstrom units, one Ang-
strom being equal to 1 x 10~8 centimeters
or 1/254,000,000 of an inch.

JAMES A. BURNS
Ultraviolet Radiation
One of the most important radiations
from the sun, and one which has received
considerable attention in recent years, is
the ultraviolet radiation. It has been
found that exposure of the skin to suffi-
cient amounts of this energy, between
2800 and 3200 Angstroms, will produce
several reactions. The most apparent of
these reactions is called erythema, or red-
dening of the exposed skin. This reaction
develops a few hours after exposure and
may last for several days. (Fig. 2) By
using greater amounts of ultraviolet en-
ergy than necessary to produce erythema,
the pigmentation of the skin is affected
and tanning results. Since both of these
effects depend upon the absorption of
energy by the skin, the results will vary
with individual skin sensitivity.

EYE SENSITIVITY
ERYTHT-MAi EFFECTIVENESS
ANTflACMiTJC EFFECTIVENESS
One result of ultraviolet energy ab-
sorption that is not visible, but neverthe-
less extremely important, is the produc-
tion of vitamin D (antirachitic produc-
tion). (Fig. 1) Vitamin D is required
for normal calcium metabolism and
strong, healthy bones and teeth. It is the
only vitamin which the body is able to
produce and has long been recognized as
necessary for the prevention and cure of
rickets. Recently experiments have been
conducted on large numbers of school
children showing that exposure to ultra-
violet radiations during the day has in-
creased their work capacity. Other experi-
ments on hundreds of miners, especially
in Europe, where exposure is made in
their "change" houses, show that ultra-
violet energy may help resistance to colds
and other respiratory diseases. Thus the
beneficial effects of ultraviolet energy are
much broader in scope than at first be-
lieved.
Erythema and Tan
Returning to the more obvious effects
of exposure to ultraviolet radiation, it
has been found that erythema is caused
by the dilation of very small blood vessels
in the lower levels of the skin. Since the
radiations penetrate the skin only slightly,
they do not cause the reddening directly,
but rather, it is believed, activate an or-
ganic compound near the skin surface,
probably histamine, which migrates to the

It is deplorable that the mention of
atomic energy should immediately call to
mind the atomic bomb and visions of
great destructive power, rather than the
potentialities of nuclear energy in con-
structive uses. That this condition should
exist is in some measure due to the wide-
spread publicity accorded to the bomb as a
part of the nation's defenses. However,
little has been said of the usefulness of
radio isotopes in peacetime industry or of
the even greater usefulness that an increas-
ing knowledge of their properties prom-
ises. It is the purpose of this article to
describe briefly some of the characteristics
of radio isotopes which make them useful,
a few of the uses to which they have been
put, and some possible future uses.
It has been said, not without reason,
that science is that process by which na-
ture is measured. In studies of the struc-
ture and composition of matter the investi-
gator, not being able to see individual
atoms, must collect enough of them to
handle in his analysis. If he is using the
most sensitive balance obtainable, he must
collect, in order to weigh them, about a
million billion atoms. Contrast this with
the ten million radiophosphorus atoms
which can be readily measured on elec-
tronic devices built for such measurement.
In other words the actual amount of ma-
terial required for measurement may be
reduced 100 million fold. Another way
of stating this is that our perception,
with regards to this element, is increased
100 million fold.
Other Advantages of Radio Isotopes
In addition to the above mentioned
factor of sensitivity, radio isotopes are
possessed of several other unique advant-
ages. Being radioactive and being detect-
able by virtue of their radioactivity, these
materials may be detected at a distance.
Therefore, samples need not be purified
to the extent usually necessary in physical
and chemical analysis. The fact that radia-
tion from radio isotopes penetrates matter
to a practical degree and may thus be
detected at a distance is more than a sim-
ple convenience, for it makes possible in-
vestigations which could not be achieved
in any other way. Inaccessibility some-

times makes it impossible to obtain a
sample of the substance to analyze, or
removal of the sample may alter the proc-
ess or system being studied. The use of a
form of the element which will "radio"
its presence through the intervening ma-
terial obviates the first type of objection
and in addition permits continuous meas-
urement of the process without alteration
of it in any detail. Furthermore, each
radio isotopes having a specific and unique
type of radiation permits the exact identi-
fication of the source to be derived from
the characteristics of the radiation.
One field where radiometrical analysis
offers great advantages is medicine. Con-
sider for example the problem of investi-
gating malfunctions of the thyroid gland.
A biochemist cannot take a sample of the
thyroid from a human being with the
same abandon that he can from a dog.
In addition, the amount of iodine (the ele-
ment sought in the thyroid) may be very
minute and thus present difficulties in an-
alysis. Finally, taking a gland or a por-
tion of it for analysis means surgery, inter-
ference with the organism, and the end
of the tissue in question as a functioning
entity; in other words, only one analysis
may be made and the investigator cannot
follow the iodine content of the thyroid
as a function of time.
Now suppose that iodine with a harm-
less amount of radioactivity be intro-
duced into the body. This radioactive
iodine has the advantage of greater sen-
sitivity previously mentioned. Also, since
the radiation penetrates to the outside of
the body, it may be detected by external
instruments placed on appropriate parts of
the body (on the front of the neck for
thyroid measurements). Finally, since the
gland functioning is not affected, the rate
at which the radioactive iodine enters and
leaves the thyroid may be measured con-
tinuously. Results of measurements of this
type led to the use of large quantities of
radioactive iodine as a therapeutic agent
in certain types of goiter and smaller
quantities in the diagnosis of thyroid ail-
ments.
Engineering Uses of Radio Isotopes
Radio isotopes also find use in solving
engineering problems. A prosaic but im-
portant use of the ionizing properties of
radioactive materials is the removal of
static electricity generated in moving ma-
chinery, particularly belts. When static
charges build up to a potential of several
thousand volts, a spark results which may
cause an explosion if organic dust or
vapor is in the air (for example in grain
mills). Less dangerous, but economically
equally important, is the effect of static
charges in causing the sticking together
and fouling of such things as textile fibers
and paper. Polonium plated onto metal
parts and covered thinly with gold to
prevent evaporation ionizes the air about
it and prevents the accumulation of a
dangerous charge.
Radioactive isotopes have been used in
process control. For example, sodium
oleate is being used in coating fibers.
Fibers which have a diameter of 0.0004
inches must be coated uniformly to avoid
nonuniform dying and snarling in the
knitting process. It is obvious that the
amount of oleate used is very small. By
using Na24 in the sodium oleate, the coat-
ing process can be checked so that the
distribution of the oleate can be deter-
mined within 2% on a one millimeter
length fiber.
Chemical and physical reactions occur-
ring on lubricated surfaces have been
studied by adding radioactive iron as a
bearing surface. Any iron which reacted
with the oil or its derivatives could be
measured with the sensitivity of one part
in ten million in as little as 20 milli-
grams of oil.
Radioactive tracers are also very suit-
able for the determination of wear. Either
one metal can be irradiated while the other
one is inactive and the amount of activity
transferred to the inactive one measured,

recipient of the Harold DeWitt Smith
Memorial Medal, given in recognition of
outstanding achievement in the science of
utilizing textile fibers. Since 1929, when
he first went to the Bureau of Standards,
Dr. Schieffer has invented and developed
many devices for testing the strength and
wear-resistance of textiles; his compresso-
meter, flexometer, and hosiery testing
machines are standard instruments now
widely used in the textile industry. His
most recent work has been the calculation
of a mathematical solution to the problem
of producing uniform wear over a plane
area of a textile specimen by abrading it
from every direction, and the construction
of a practical machine based on the mathe-
matical solution. During 1945 he was
granted leave from the Bureau to serve
as a member of the Technical Intelligence
Committee for the Office of the Quarter-
master General. As a member of this
committee he acted as a scientific con-
sultant surveying German textile research
and the condition of the German textile
industry at the close of World War II.
A former member of the faculty here at
the University, Dr. Schieffer received the
Award for Meritorious Service from the

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC



DEAN IVAN C. CRAWFORD
College of Engineering
University of Michigan
On many occasions, during the past five years, we have heard
it said that the College of Engineering was entirely too large,
that it had lost, to a very considerable degree, the feeling of
intimacy which had existed among the students and faculty prior
to World War II.
Before that time the maximum enrollment had been 2250
undergraduate students, and some 250 graduate students. The
maximum post-war enrollment was 4178 undergraduate students
and 575 graduate students, an increase of approximately 871/2
percent. The enrollment for the second semester of the present
academic year is 2895 undergraduate students and 519 grad-
uate students.
Immediate Post War Situation
The great bulge in enrollment which followed World War
II had been anticipated because relatively few students, even
in engineering, had been permitted to attend college during
the War. Consequently there came to the colleges the accumu-
lated enrollment of several years. Without doubt, for a brief
period of time, a couple of years perhaps, there was a most
decided overload in every accredited engineering college. And
this was as it should be, because the veteran, on account of his
sacrifices, was entitled to preferred attention. However, despite
this large influx of veterans, no qualified Michigan student was
turned away from this College.
The Present
Now the enrollment is dropping. As noted above, this
semester we have a total of 3414 students, and we know that
the enrollment for next fall will probably be less than it is now,
although it is not likely that we will again see as small a
College of Engineering as we had prior to World War II.
Everyone would agree that following World War II we
were overcrowded, and that the college probably was too large.
One should remember, however, that here numbers alone do
not make an institution too large, provided that individual
attention is given to the members of the student body. It is
entirely possible for an engineering college with 4000 students
to devote more attention to the individual than an engineering
college with one-half or one-quarter of that enrollment. It all
depends upon the student-faculty ratio, and the physical facilities
in the way of class rooms and laboratory space. Prior to the
War, recitation classes were kept down to between 20 and 25
students. During the bulge period, these classes ran as high
as 35 or even more. Now they are approaching the pre-war
standard.
Importance of Extracurricular Activities
Extracurricular activities play a large part in the life of the
engineering student of today. They afford a laboratory wherein
the student may learn something of the art of leadership and
demonstrate his proficiency therein. For this reason there
should be the opportunity for all students to participate in an
activity of his choosing. In the College of Engineering we
immediately think of the student chapters of the national
societies, the Technic, the Engineering Council, the honorary
scholastic fraternities, and athletics. Of course, a school should
not be so large that the student will find it impossible to par-
ticipate in such activities. Here in the College of Engineering
of the University of Michigan, organizations are generally
soliciting students to help carry on their work.
All such experiences have very real value because they
indicate to the prospective employer the possession of desirable
attitudes and abilities on the part of the young engineer.
Yardsticks
The total number of students enrolled in an engineering
college will not be an indication of whether the college is too
large or not. In order to evaluate this subject intelligently, one
must know the number of students and the number of full
time faculty members. Also, it will be necessary to have some
knowledge regarding the accomplishments of the faculty mem-
bers. The amount of space devoted to laboratories and class
rooms is a factor of very great importance. Finally, the pros-
pective student should know something about the opportunities
for extracurricular activities, the living conditions in the dormi-
tories, and the living quarters about the town in which the
college is located.

THE STRENGTH OF STEEL
BY
CHARLES S. SINCLAIR, '50NA
There'll be the loco-boiler next an' thirty
miles an hour!
Thirty an' more. What I hd seen since
ocean-steam began
Leaves me na doot for the machine: but
what about the man?
Kipling
Dirty and sweating, a feed pump sighs
and sobs, delivering full rated load with
measured beat and stroke. This greasy
steel is a beautiful creation, fulfilling its
appointed task of feeding the thirsty
boiler for a dynamo, or slogging in the
bowels of a ship steaming in the guano
trade or carrying lovers on a moonlight
excursion.
This same pump can be a machine or
horror. Each stroke carrying a war vessel
a calculated distance further into enemy
waters. Its valves open and shut with
pulsing rhythm like the valves of a giant
heart, and like the human heart they
quicken at the sight of the foe. This
simple pump, now part of a death dealing
machine, seeks to kill and to destroy.
Why is it that these simple foundry
products, can have such a Jekyll-Hyde ex-
istence? Certainly it is not their fault for
they are soulless things void of feelings.
They were torn from the earth by man,
smelted and cast by man, machined and
assembled by man, and it is man that
directs their use.
The human mind has created wonder-
ous things: the time escapement and the
turret lathe. Why can not this same
mind direct these bits of metal toward
human betterment instead of human de-
struction? Surely the want and poverty
that saturate the earth offer the greatest
challenge to those who desire to build and
create the weapons to fight this suffering
—but this challenge is rarely accepted. In
place of weapons to fight poverty, men
have been led to believe it is better to
have the weapons to fight other men.
The cycle repeats with deadly regular-
ity. War rules the limelight decade after
decade, and the interims of so-called peace
merely serve to mark the rounds in a
gigantic boxing match. They are rest
periods where the nations can stagger to
their respective corners to build anew and

CHARLES S. SINCLAIR
scheme to wreak more deadly havoc on
their enemy in the coming round.
Why is this folly? Why do men refine
their instruments of terror in preference
to their implements of peace? Why can
man be made to believe that a thousand
cannons are of more value than a million
simple nails?
On one hand we have created machines,
wonderful structures and mechanisms
capable of performing the most arduous
tasks with ease and dexterity. On the
other hand they can render death with
speed and precision. We must arrive at
the inevitable conclusion that the horror
is not in the mere creation of these de-
vices, but it is in their direction. Yes, the
fault lies with those men responsible for
directing the use of these mechanical
masterpieces.
How can a mind which patiently
weighs the delicate factors of stress, time,
and distance in the design of machanisms
be the same mind which schemes to use
the finished product for the ill of his own
kind? The answer is in the fact that the
mind which creates is not the mind which
directs. Though the two may spring from
the same womb, they are as different as
the night is from the day.
The mind which dares to build from
raw material must be daring yet conserva-
tive; it must balance cost and strength
with a careful eye. The man behind this
mind cannot be a dreamer, but he must
be able to picture the intangible. He
cannot be a speculator, yet he must con-
stantly take considered chances. Training
in such a mode of thought gives rise to a
definite type of person. A man of sound
judgment, capable of dealing with the un-
known, yet with a fearful respect for that
which is labeled an assumption.
Unfortunately the interests of such
men are too often cloaked in their work,
and they fail to perceive the events of the
world about them. They fail to note the
subtle methods by which they and their
products are mis-used by their so-called
leaders, until it is too late. It is indeed a
pitiful situation. Those responsible for
developing and refining the physical
products of the world seem to care little
how the shabby men with shabby minds
make use of their efforts. The engineer
rarely seeks to serve in positions where
his calculated logic will apply toward
helping in the relations of nation with
nation.
Those most capable of aiding man and
his use of machines are those who have
conceived and created the machine; those
who have patient intellect and will not
be led afield by prejudice and hasty deci-
sion. However, such thought is foreign
to the leaders, the politicians, be they
Russian, Pole, Spaniard, or American.
Each politico is engined for the sole pur-
pose of enlarging and concentrating his
own power by force or flattery, the
method is incidental—to him.
The little people that want and need to
build must usurp the terrible power now
wielded by the petty men who foster fear
and further their personal gain by destruc-
tion.
The world is reeling toward another
drunken war and the hand of the engi-
neer is being used to shove it down the
path. The engineer must not be an accom-
plice in this heinous crime. He must ap-
ply his logic on the subject of human
weakness as well as the strength of steel.
His mind can be of greatest service not
only by creating physical servants for
mankind, but by directing the use of these
mechanical wonders as well.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


BLOW-DOWN WIND TUNNEL
BY
CECIL V. CARTER, '50Aero
The desire for faster aircraft has created
a need for more information on that
range of flight where the velocity exceeds
that of sound. In order to obtain that in-
formation, wind tunnels of various test
section sizes have been built in many
countries capable of providing air flows
above sonic speed. However, the high
power requirements of supersonic tunnels
precludes the use of tunnels having mod-
erately large test sections as instructional
facilities. Investigation has shown that
tunnels of small test sectional areas may
be used to advantage in this field.
The necessity of providing laboratory
facilities at the University of Michigan
for instruction in the field of supersonic
aerodynamics led to the construction of
the present intermittent, supersonic, blow-
down wind tunnel which has a small test
section area.
Intermittent wind tunnels are charac-
terized by the periodic interruptions
necessary for recharging the system. The
blow-down tunnel differs from the
vacuum type in that a pressurized tank
exhausts to the atmosphere; whereas, in
the vacuum type the tank is evacuated and
atmospheric pressure used to force air
through the test section.
This report presents a detailed descrip-
tion of the components of the tunnel.
Some performance data are presented and
experimental results correlated with
theory. Several examples of schlieren
photographs made in the tunnel are in-
cluded, and the advantages and disadvant-
ages of the blow-down type of tunnel are
discussed.
The tunnel, designed for a Mach num-
ber of 2.82 in the one square inch test
section, actually reaches a Mach number
of approximately 2.67.
The magnitude of Reynolds number
obtained in the test section is approxi-
mately 9.7 x 10r' per inch of length.
Maintaining the settling chamber at
a constant value increases the length of
run over that of a simple blow-down for
the same decrement of main tank pres-
sure.
Experimental results show that the
location of the normal shock wave, with
no model in the test section, is usually

upstream from the theoretically predicted
position.
Experimentally obtained nozzle pres-
sure distributions deviate most from the
theoretical distributions in the proximity
of the throat.
In general, experimental results agree
with those predicted by the one dimen-
sional equations of motion to a de-
gree which is sufficiently close for the
purpose for which the tunnel is intended.
COMPONENTS OF THE TUNNEL
Air Source
Air under 90 to 100 pounds per square
inch pressure is obtained from the Uni-
versity compressed air supply.
Dryer
An electrically operated type AAC-150
dryer made by the Lectrodryer Corpora-
tion, Pittsburgh, with a maximum work-
ing pressure of 100 pounds per square
inch is used. The power used with a con-
nected load is 2.8 KW, and the average
energy used per reactivation is 11 KWH.
The dryer adsorbs approximately 6 pounds
of water per reactivation based on a dew
point of —40 degrees Fahrenheit which
should be attained according to the manu-
facturer's specifications. The motor is Y\
hp and operates on a 110 volt, single
phase, 60 cycle power supply. Up to
1500 cubic feet of air per hour may be
passed through the dryer. Reactivation is
accomplished by reversing the air flow
through the dryer and by heating coils
embedded in the drying agent, activated
alumina. Reactivation is completed in
approximately hours and must be done
after 8 to 10 hours of intermittent use.
Storage Tank
Air is stored at 90 to 100 pounds per
square inch pressure in a cylindrical tank
of 100 cubic feet capacity. The tank is
approximately 4 feet in diameter and 8
feet high. A safety blowoff valve is pro-
vided on top, and a water drain is pro-
vided on the bottom.
Quick Opening Valve
The quick opening valve is manually
operated and is designed to provide a
rapid means of establishing the aid flow
in the pipe leading from the storage to
the nozzle.
Pressure Control System
Throttling Valve: The throttling valve
controls the pressure downstream of its
position by throttling the flow. A con-
stant pressure may be maintained down-
stream of this valve by continual adjust-
ment of the size of the opening while the
tank is exhausting.
Settling Chamber: The settling cham-
ber is an enlarged, cylindrical portion of
the exhaust tube, approximately 18 inches
in diameter by 24 inches long. It is de-
signed to provide a section of relatively
low velocity where the pressure will be
approximately that of the main tank pres-
sure in the absence of throttling. The
cylinder contains three fine mesh wire
screens, one inch apart, intended to re-
duce turbulence.
Automatic Pressure Control System:
As shown in Fig. 2, an electric pressure
transmitter located on the settling chamber
transmits the settling chamber pressure
to the control units. The dial on the con-
trol unit may be set to any desired pres-
sure from zero to 100 pounds per square
inch. Any deviation from this preset pres-
sure within the settling chamber is de-
tected by the electric pressure transmitter

Electronic Detective
Short circuits and other defects in
electrical wiring can be easily located by
use of an electronic tracing device called
the Electracer. Developed by Special
Products Company, Silver Spring, Mary-
land, the Electracer consists of a signal
generator, portable probe, receiver, and
headphones. The generated signal will
follow any chosen conductor, even if it is
buried in the ground, imbedded in a wall,
incased in a conduit, or merely surround-

ed by other wires and pipes. As the con-
ductor is followed with the probe the am-
plified signal may be heard in the head-
phones, and the route of the conductor
and position of defect can be quickly de-
termined. The device can also be used for
tracing buried piping.
Bladeless Centrifugal Pump
When a centrifugal pump is fouled by
trash caught in the blades, it isn't news.
Since, however, it is expensive and annoy-
ing, and can be dangerous, the problem
demands a solution. There are two pos-
sible approaches. Some means may be
devised to eliminate the trash from the
liquid being pumped, and this has been
done, but the process is expensive and
cumbersome. In some cases, where a
material being processed is pumped in
suspension, "trash" elimination would
destroy the process. The other possible
solution to the clogging problem is—
eliminate the impeller blades on the
pump.
Such a pump was developed by engi-
neer Bob Glazebrook of the Fairbanks-
Morse Co. He demonstrated it recently
to a group of about two hundred consul-
tant engineers from all parts of the
country. The inherent superiority of the
bladeless design was indicated when con-
ventional trash pumps clogged on foot
square pieces of canvas which passed the
bladeless pump easily. This was only the
beginning; a lab coat was fed into the
new pump and came out undamaged.
Finally, pieces of canvas six feet long and
three feet wide were run through the
pump without fouling it.
Having shown the difficulty of clogging
this pump with anything small enough
to pass through the inlet, the demonstra-
tion turned from trash disposal to food
processing. Oranges, apples, and hard

will also pass the casing.
boiled eggs were fed into the pump. A
conventional pump would have produced
orange juice, applesauce, and egg salad,
respectively, but the bladeless pump
brought them through undamaged except
for some cracked eggshells.
In considering the reasons for the de-
velopment of the new type of pump, it
should be noted that minimum require-
ments for a pump to handle raw sewerage
are a four inch inlet and the ability to pass
three inch solids. A conventional centri-
fugal pump capable of passing three inch
solids also has a rather large capacity, and

for small installations the efficiency in
normal operation is likely to be low. In
addition, the first cost and upkeep of the
larger pump is high, and a larger motor
is required to drive it than the pumping
work would justify. Finally, even the best
designed impeller blades are susceptible to
clogging. This last is the biggest problem.
The solution was an impeller consisting
of a single spiral channel without con-
strictions. The impeller is unsymmetrical,
and is subject to an unbalanced hydraulic
thrust due to the jet of water being pump-
ed, but cored voids in the impeller casting
partly compensate this natural unbalance.
Final balance is achieved by means of
streamlined counterweights fastened to
the back side of the impeller. In addi-
tion to the balancing function, the coun-
terweight also effectively serves to prevent
stringy trash from wrapping around the
impeller shaft.
These pumps are made in sizes from

New Uuo-Couc loudspeaker, developed at RCA Laboratories, achieves the illusion of "living presence.'
Music /ok&amp;s' "jhi
For years, working toward the ulti-
mate in sound reproduction, scientists
have sought for living presence—the
illusion that a musician or speaker is
talking, singing, playing in your home.
Now, with RCA's Duo-Cone loud-
speaker, the goal is achieved. Two sound-
cones in acoustical alignment reproduce
sound without distortion, and give you
every tonal value from a frequency of 30
on to 15,000 cycles. It is in the area above
a frequency of 4,000—seldom touched
by conventional speakers—that most of
the all-important "overtones" lie. RCA*s
Duo-Cone loudspeaker reproduces every
overtone—to the very peak of a violin's
range—and faithfully gives you the deep
low notes of a bass drum!
In addition, the RCA Duo-Cone loud-
speaker's wide angle of sound pervades every
comer of a room without sharply directed
blast or blare. Its response to tones of every
frequency is smooth, flowing, and even.

JAMES T. GRAHAM
ABOUT THE ARTIST: Although he was born in Alliance, Ohio, Jim has spent most of his 26 years in Detroit. Jim doesn't know
exactly when he began his art career, for it seems that he just grew up into it. It all may have started back in grade school when
he painted the scenery for the Christmas pageant or when he designed the cover for the commencement issue. His formal art
education consisted merely of a course or two in drawing and water colors at the age of 13.
His famous "Sad Beta Sacka" was created at Highland Park Junior College, and went over so well that he continued it in
the "MICHIGAN TECHNIC" when he started school at the University. His more recent work also includes the excellent decorations
used at the Slide Rule Ball, last December.
Jim's cartooning career will probably be terminated after graduation, since he has already accepted a position with the
Mechanical Handling Systems Corporation in Detroit.

RESEARCH DECENTRALMZED
Du Pont scientists pursue their studies
from Buffalo, N. Y., to Orange, Texas

The du pont company is a large
company. Its many manufactur-
ing plants are now located from
Maine to California. Likewise, the
Company's research activities are
spread over a wide area. From the
Founder's informal scientific experi-
ments on the Brandywine have
sprung 42 research and development
laboratories in ten states.
Each manufacturing department*
has its own research director and
maintains facilities for studies in its
specialized fields. Thus, research hav-
ing to do with dyes, neoprene and
fine chemicals is centered at Deep-
water, N. J.; research on cellophane
and other transparent wrapping films
at Buffalo, N. Y.; research on viscose
rayon at Richmond, Va.; and re-
search on coated and impregnated
fabrics at Newburgh, N. Y. These
are only a few of the places where
Du Pont scientists are now at work.
Each manufacturing department
does fundamental research as well as
applied research on new processes
and products.
Many types of training
At any one time, many hundreds of
different projects are under way in
these laboratories. Though a rela-
tively large number of Du Pont tech-
nical people are chemists and chem-
ical engineers, other fields of training
are strongly represented.
Among the scientists working with
Du Pont are mechanical, electrical,
civil, industrial, mining, petroleum,
textile, architectural and safety en-
gineers, physicists, metallurgists, bi-
ologists and mathematicians. About

Interchange of thinking
All manufacturing departments may
draw on the services of the chem-
ical, engineering and toxicological
laboratories of the company in Wil-
mington. In addition, the Chemical
Department's library at the Wil-
mington Experimental Station cir-
culates reference material, conducts
literature and patent searches and
issues a weekly abstract of pertinent
articles found in the important chem-
ical journals of the world. This sup-
plements normal work of this kind
done by the various manufacturing
departments.
No matter where a Du Pont re-
search man may work, he has every
opportunity to use his best talents,
to advance as his abilities develop,
and to profit by interchange of think-
ing with scientists whose minds com-
plement his own.

level of the blood vessels causing the
dilation and reddening. This migration
explains the time interval between expo-
sure and reddening.
Evidence from the large number of
tests conducted on erythema and tan seem
to indicate that the two processes may be
entirely separate. Since there are many
variables in the production of tan—such
as natural skin color, race, sex, body func-
tions, constitution, wave length of ultra-
violet used, and time of exposure—it is
quite difficult to determine the exact cause
of tanning. For example, exposure to the
shorter wavelengths of ultraviolet (2500-
2800 Angstroms) produces erythema most
readily but is not accompanied by tan.
On the other hand, exposure to the radia-
(Continued from page 6)
of ultraviolet is, of course, the sun.
While it produces energy at a tremendous
rate, the sun's production of ultraviolet is
but a small part of its total radiation. In
addition, the earth receives less than one
two-billionth of the total radiation of
the sun. There are other important limi-
tations on this source including the varia-
tion of the solar spectrum over the sea-
sons, atmospheric conditions, latitude of
the observer, and even the time of day.
Also, there are interferences between the
sun and the earth, such as atmospheric
refraction or filtering by smoke and dust,
which reduce the amount of ultraviolet
energy available for exposure. It is inter-
esting to note in mentioning these inter-
ferences that, contrary to common belief,

tions around 2970 Angstroms produces
erythema followed by some tan, while
radiations in the 3800-Angstrom range
will produce tan without erythema, al-
though nearly one-thousand times as much
energy must be used at this wavelength
than at 2967 Angstroms for the same de-
gree of tan. It is presently believed that
the tanning process is probably due to
photochemical reactions in the skin.
Ultraviolet Sources
From this brief background in the
nature of ultraviolet energy and its effects,
we turn to the sources of this health giv-
ing radiation and compare them mainly as
to efficiency and economy.
Solar Radiation
The most obvious and generous source
clouds or haze seem to have very little ef-
fect on the radiations which produce
sunburn. Due to these obstructions in
obtaining solar radiation, science has
looked elsewhere for sources of ultraviolet
which are reliable, available at all times,
convenient, economical, and easy to con-
trol.
The Carbon-Arc Lamp
A leader in this search for artificial
sources was Professor Niels Finsen who,
in 1897, developed the carbon-arc lamp
for use in his work in heliotherapy. In
this type of sun lamp, the carbon elec-
trodes are heated to incandescence by the
passage of electric current. The electrodes
vaporize at this high temperature produc-
ing a gas which is ionized by the heat,
releasing strong radiations, the intensity
and quality of which are controlled by the
type of electrodes used and the amount of
current passed. Although the carbon-arc
lamp is a prolific source of ultraviolet
radiations, it has several serious defects
which limit its application. The elec-
trodes must be adjusted continually and
replaced quite frequently. Also, the lamp
gives off obnoxious fumes during its
operation and presents a fire hazard.
A second type of lamp which was con-
sidered a source of ultraviolet energy is
the tungsten filament (CX) lamp. (Fig.
3) Although the quantity of ultraviolet
energy produced by this type of lamp is
quite small in comparison with the sun or
other types of lamps, it does produce some
radiations of the longer wavelengths with
some therapeutic value.
The Gaseous-Discharge Lamp
Another type of sun lamp—one which
is in the widest usage today—is the gas-
eous-discharge lamp. Although there are
many kinds of gaseous-discharge lamps,
the principle upon which they all operate
is the same. The radiant energy is pro-
duced by passing electric current through
a combination of mercury-vapor and an
inert gas. Application of an electric po-
tential causes ionization of the gas per-
mitting the flow of current. The electrons
which comprise the current stream are ac-
celerated to very high velocities and travel
until they collide with atoms of mercury-
vapor. The collisions cause alteration of
the atomic structure of the mercury by
temporarily displacing one of the plane-
tary electrons from its orbit in the mer-
cury atom. When this displaced electron
snaps back into its original location in the
atom, ultraviolet energy is released.
The several types of gaseous-discharge
lamps differ mainly in the materials used
to obtain the discharge and in the type of
filter used. The latter is important since
ordinary glass, such as is used in win-
dows and spectacles, will not transmit
ultraviolet radiation. (Fig. 3)
In the mercury-vapor lamp, two elec-
trodes are sealed into an airtight glass or
quartz tube containing a small amount of
mercury. The intensity of this source is
then controlled by varying the mercury
vapor pressure in the lamp and by proper
choice of the glass used in the bulb.
Of the two mercury vapor sun lamps
used today, only one is recognized by the
American Medical Association as a sun

lamp. The other, which produces radia-
tion down to 2537 Angstroms, is a single
quartz bulb type and may be used only
under the supervision of a physician since
the short wave radiations are likely to be
harmful unless the exposure is carefully
controlled. The lamp recognized by the
A.M.A. is equipped with special glass to
filter out the short wavelengths, emits
radiation above 2800 Angstrom range and
is suitable for general home use.
The first sun lamp of the latter type to
be produced was called the S-l lamp (Fig.
4) and was developed in 1929. In this
lamp a tungsten filament, operating in
parallel with a mercury arc between tung-
sten electrodes, serves merely to heat and
vaporize a nearby pool of mercury forming
the mercury arc. The glass used in this
lamp, and in its smaller companion, the
S-2, effectively filters out all radiation
below 2800 Angstroms.
Two other sun lamps of the gaseous-
discharge type were developed about this
time, but in spite of their high efficiency,
never gained wide acceptance because of
their low output. Designated the G-l
and G-5, these operated at a low current
density with a glow rather than arc dis-
charge.
In 1939 a modification of the S-l lamp
was introduced. This lamp, designated
the S-4, used two bulbs, an inner quartz
tube containing the arc discharge, and an
outer glass bulb partially evacuated con-
taining some inert gas. (Fig. 5) This
outer bulb protected the inner tube from

temperature changes and filtered the short
wave radiations. The main improvement
of the S-4 was its increased efficiency al-
lowing it to consume less wattage than
the S-l for the same ultraviolet output.
The R-S Sunlamp
Shortly before the war a great improve-
ment in sun lamps appeared under the
title of the RS Sun Lamp. Unlike its pre-
decessors, the RS requires no external bal-
lasts or reflectors but is a self-contained
unit. The lamp is constructed with an
inner quartz tube and an outer filtering
bulb. (Fig. 6)
In operation, current first flows through
the series combination of the resistance
filament, the small starting filament in the
arc tube, and through the bimetal starting
switch. This current generates heat which
vapories some of the mercury in the
quartz tube and causes the bimetal switch
to open. With this switch open, the full
line voltage is impressed across the arc
tube thus initiating the discharge. The
current, limited by the filament resistance,
now flows through the series combination
of the tungsten filament and arc tube.
The RS lamp has several advantages
over its predecessors. It can be screwed
into any ordinary AC household lighting
socket and thus requires no special fix-
tures. Its ballast and reflector are self-
contained allowing the removal of auxil-
iary equipment. It is small and light in
weight, efficient, and is relatively inexpen-
sive to buy and operate.
Despite its many advantages, the RS
lamp has some drawbacks which prohibit
its use in some applications. It operates
only on 50-60 cycle, 110-115 volt, AC
outlets. The radiation is not entirely ultra-
violet since the tungsten filament gener-
ates infra-red heat rays undesirable in
some industrial uses. Its radiation pattern
is limited to 30 percent of the axial in-
tensity in 40 degrees divergence, which
means that the beam effectively covers
a circle only 20 inches in diameter at the
normal operating distance of two feet.
The starting and restarting characteristics
of the lamp also are a nuisance in some

Strength factors of Long Life!
No pipe that is provably deficient in any of these
strength factors should ever be laid in city streets
w«
rithout beam strength—or, for that
matter—without all of the strength factors
listed opposite—no pipe laid 100 years
ago in city streets would be in service
today. But, in spite of the evolution of
traffic from horse-drawn vehicles to heavy
trucks and buses—and today's vast
complexity of subway and underground
utility services—cast iron gas and water
mains, laid over a century ago, are
serving in the streets of more than 30
cities in the United States and Canada.
Such service records prove that cast iron

The toughness of cast iron pipe which enables
it to withstand impact and traffic shocks, as

for the lamp to reach its full ultraviolet
output, and once turned off the RS lamp
must be allowed to cool for approximately
five minutes before restarting. In spite of
these defects, the RS sun lamp is prob-
ably the most popular type of sun lamp

The Fluorescent Sun Lamp
The most recent and most promising
development in the field of sun lamps has
been the introduction of the fluorescent
sun lamp by the Westinghouse Electric
Corporation. Differing essentially from
the other types of sun lamps only in the
method of controlling the radiations, the
fluorescent sun lamp is radically different
both in performance and application.

ordinary fluorescent lamp used for light-
ing purposes. Its principle, form, con-
struction, details, and operation are the
same. It differs from the ordinary fluores-
cent lamp, however, in that the ultraviolet
energy emitted from the mercury-arc dis-
charge is converted by a newly developed
phosphor coating to the erythemal wave-
lengths rather than to the visible wave-
lengths. The fluorescent sun lamp uses an
outer tube of special ultraviolet-transmit-
ting glass rather than the ordinary glass
used in the regular fluorescent lamp. Due
to this similarity, the fluorescent sun lamp
will operate in the same fixtures used for
the regular fluorescent lamp and thus re-
quires no special auxiliary equipment.
lar shape allowing the subject to achieve
a more uniform tan. The fluorescent sun
lamp gives off very little heat during oper-
ation and can even come in contact with
the skin directly without heat burns. This
feature is important in considering appli-
cation in air-conditioned rooms and in
certain industrial processes. The fluores-
cent sun lamp has a life many times as
long as other sun lamps. Although the
erythemal output drops to 80 percent of
the initial value after approximately 150
hours of use, the lamp produces about 68
percent of initial output at 1,000 hours
and 59 percent after 2,000 hours. It is
easily started and restarted requiring no
warmup or cooling-off periods as do

This is not the main advantage of the
new type of sun lamp, however, since it
also represents improved performance in
nearly all phases of its operation over
previously used sun lamps. For example,
the fluorescent is twenty times more effi-
cient than the S-l and seven times more
efficient than the S-4. In fact the fluores-
sent sun lamp produces much more ery-
themal energy per watt of electrical input
than any other lamp ever devised. (Fig. 9)
Its radiation pattern is broad, covering a
large area uniformly due to its long, tubu-
other lamps. This lamp more closely ap-
proximates the sun since each gives off a
continuous spectrum. (Fig. 10) The lamp
is available in 20- and 40-watt sizes and
the 20-watt lamp may be used satisfac-
torily on a direct current circuit.

tics of the fluorescent sun lamp make it

lamp, however, is in the new fields of
application which its characteristics make
possible. In physical therapy treatments
the lamp can be used where heat may be
undesirable. In solaria, which many
hotels, athletic clubs , and hospitals pro-
vide, fewer units are needed to bathe the
surroundings in the healthful ultraviolet
radiations, the intensity of the radiations
may be more easily controlled, and the
general flexibility of design is greater.

is finding application in solaria for
miners and similarly employed workers
who are kept from sunlight during their
usual working day. Here, the fluorescent
lamp may be adjusted to give a high in-
tensity radiation which will enable the
workers to absorb the ultraviolet energy
in a relatively short time while washing
or changing clothes.
Another promising application of the
fluorescent sun lamp is in the field of
animal husbandry. Having conducted ex-
periments at several research institutions
and agricultural colleges, scientists have
long appreciated that exposure of poultry
and animals to mid-ultraviolet radiation
has produced desirable results from the
increased vitamin D production made
possible. Previously hampered by the in-
convenience of using concentrates and
fish oils and by the low efficiency, short
life, narrow distribution, and high initial
and operating costs of other types of sun
lamps in aiding the production of vitamin
D, poultrymen have found the use of
fluorescent sun lamps both practical and
advisable. Recent tests made on poultry
farms using fluorescent sun lamps indi-
cate that their use is conductive to in-
creased egg production, increased hatch-
ability, stronger shells, and other im-
portant benefits. It has also been found
that enough ultraviolet radiation may be
supplied for adequate production of vita-
min D in poultry at the low cost of about
two cents per chicken per year.
Fluorescent sun lamps have also found
a home in industry where they can be used
in industrial processes in which ultra-
violet radiations must be of a cool, uni-
form, and economical source. For ex-
ample, in the plastics industry the radia-
tions are used as a catalyst in the setting
of certain monomer cements used in bind-
ing transparent methyl microlite laminates
together. These laminates are used in
forming the clear pilot compartment
molds and transparent wind screens in the
aircraft industry. Since heat in this proc-
ess causes expansion of the cementing ma-
terial forming bubbles and resulting in an
imperfect semi-transparent line where the
several laminates are joined, a cool ultra-
violet source producing ultraviolet energy
in the 2950 to 3150 Angstrom band is
needed. The fluorescent sun lamp is the
only ultraviolet generator which has been
found satisfactory in the process.
The lamp has also found application
in the paint industry where it is used with
other lamps in reproducing the entire
solar spectrum for testing the effect of
sunlight on various types of paints. Here
the continuous spectrum and broad radia-
tion pattern of the fluorescent sun lamp
gives it the advantage over other sun
lamps.
Many other industries, such as rubber,
chemical, petroleum, and photographic,
may find the use of the fluorescent sun
lamp profitable in applying the radiations

WHY POES ITHAVB AN UPSTAIRS?
"To make traveling more fun. The idea is to give people more to see and do while riding faster and safer. That
means more passengers for the railroads so that they can keep fares down and still add more comfort to long trips."



"Railroad comfort comes from many
things, son. Smooth-fitting parts are
important. Parts like Diesel engine
crankshafts, pistons and wheels. That's
why so many railroad shops use
Norton grinders and Alundum grind-
ing wheels to make parts smooth.
"Take those side rods on steam loco-
motives. They get farther over on the
smooth side thanks to Norton internal
grinding wheels. And parts arc fin-
ished so accurately with Norton
quality controlled wheels that they
last for thousands of miles, Paul.
"Getting back to comfort... modern
trains travel over 60 miles an hour.
So, they need smooth rail joints.
Those joints are welded for safety.
Then, they're ground smooth and
slotted with Norton grinding and cut-
off wheels."

"Hundreds of other parts
of modern railroad trains and tracks
also get a lift from the sure touch of
Norton Products. So does just about
any other product you can name.
That's why I'm not boasting when I
say that Norton makes better products

PROBLEM—You are designing a cabinet-type oil
heater. The oil and air metering valve has to be
placed at the bottom. You now want to provide a
manual control for the valve located on the cabinet
front where it is easy to see and to operate. How
would you do it?
THE SIMPLE ANSWER—Use an S.S.White remote
control flexible shaft to connect the dial to the valve
or to a rod running to the valve. The latter method
was used in the heater illustrated below. The flexible
shaft will provide smooth, sensitive control and will
allow you to put the dial anywhere you want it.
This is just one of hun-
dreds of power drive and
remote control problems
to.which S.S.White flex-
ible shafts are the simple
answer. That's why every
engineer should be fa-
miliar with the range and
scope of these "Metal
Muscles"* for mechani-
cal bodies.

to solutions, gases, films, and mixtures, for the creation of new
products and the improvement of chemical processes.
To take one of these industrial advantages as an example—
the fluorescent sun lamp is the only source of radiant energy
which produces a continuous spectrum concentrated in the
middle of the ultraviolet band. (Fig. 1). All other artificial
sources of mid-ultraviolet energy develop line spectra, the
wavelengths of which are established by an arc discharge and
cannot be altered. As a result, other sources develop a much
greater percentage of their radiated energy beyond the ultra-
violet band in the visible infrared regions. This additional
energy is often completely unnecessary and, in some cases, is
even detrimental to the reaction.
Space Irradiation
In addition to the many other applications of the fluorescent
sun lamp heretofore pointed out, the prospect of using these
lamps for "space irradiation" is quite promising. Space irra-
diation is the process of providing mid-ultraviolet rays of low
intensity evenly distributed throughout a room in a school,
office, factory, or hospital, for example. This hygienic lighting,
made possible by the introduction of the fluorescent sun lamp,
completes the dream of those who would "bring sunlight
indoors" since light and radiant heat are already available.
(Fig. 12) A low intensity of radiation means that average
exposure can be kept at a level just below that it which red-
dening of the untanned skin will occur. Thus all those ex-
posed, regardless of individual skin sensitivity, will receive an
amount of ultraviolet energy conductive to the production of
vitamin D and other health giving benefits without any other
inconvenience. Extensive research on school children, as men-
tioned before, has shown this type of exposure not only pro-
motes greater mineral metabolism in building stronger bones
and teeth, but also improves working capacity and resistance
to colds.
Although ease in installing fluorescent sun lamps is facili-
tated by the use of existing fixtures, there are enough of these
fixtures in use at present that the problem is not serious,
especially in factories, schools, and offices. An improvement
in the use of these has been found in employing special re-
flectors in the fixtures. Although the bare lamp output is
sufficient to produce erythema in 10 to 15 minutes at a distance
of two feet with a 40-watt lamp, and in 20 to 25 minutes
with a 20-watt lamp, the use of an Alzak reflector, for example,
will increase the bare lamp output by 300 percent.
Thus, the story of the development of the sun lamp is one
of typical engineering advancement and improvement based on
a great deal of research and study. The biological benefits of
its use has long been realized. At present, we are enjoying im-
provements in old uses and new applications never before
possible. What the future will bring in this field is, of course,
indeterminate, but we have every reason to expect further
broadening of the health horizon through more universal use
of existing and future models of sun lamps to the benefit of all.

the lubricating system, if such a system
is employed, can be determined. By using
such methods, the wear on piston rings
has been tested successfully.
A gage utilizing radioactivity to indi-
cate liquid level in tanks has recently been
developed. This gage is particularly use-
ful where it is desired that the tank have
no openings through which gas or vapor
can leak. A float containing a long half-
life gamma emitter and restrained to
vertical movement is placed inside the
tank. A Geiger counter coupled to a count-
ing rate meter which is calibrated in liquid
depth is mounted directly above the float
and outside the tank. As the distance be-
tween the radioactive float and the Geiger
counter changes, there is a corresponding
change in the counting rate, and this is
indicated on the calibrated meter. The
output of the Geiger counter can be used
to open a filling valve when the liquid
falls below a predetermined level.
Atomic Power Production
All the above-mentioned uses of atomic

energy are secondary to the prospective
use of nuclear ssion in the production
of power. The fact that atomic chain
reaction units are operating in Illinois,
Tennessee, Washington, and New Mex-
ico show that the energy of the atomic
nuclear is effectively harnessed. The con-
trolled release of atomic energy is a mat-
ter of present-day importance.
While there may be other possibilities,
the most obvious method of producing
power from atomic fission is to heat a
cooling agent in the chain reaction unit
and pass this heated coolant through a
heat exchanger, which heats steam for
driving a turbine. Beyond the heat ex-
changer, design would involve the same
practice used in present power plants.
Up to the heat exchanger, design would
involve many new features, most promin-
ent of which is protection against danger-
ous radiation. The shielding needed to
protect against dangerous radiation is
on the order of tons and therefore the use
of atomic energy for driving automobiles
and ordinary sized airplanes is not as yet
in sight. Work, however, is at present
being done on the development of an
atomic power plant for a battleship and
it is to be expected that conversion of
such a mobile plant to a fixed plant serv-
ing a city with power would not be diffi-
cult.
It is difficult at present to say whether
the cost of atomic energy is comparable
to the cost of present energy sources. A
chain-reacting pile is more than a heat
source. Plutonium and other fission prod-
ucts have a value by themselves and may
be expected to carry some share of the
operating costs. Present estimates indicate
that the cost of atomic energy is at least
on a competing basis with conventional
methods of energy production.
Not so very long ago, it became evident
that x-rays were useful for "seeing"
through the body. It was not imagined
that research done with x-rays would re-
veal the electron and so lead to the inven-
tion of radio and many other electronic
devices. It would, therefore, not be sur-
prising if the most important consequences
of the discovery of atomic energy will
come along lines hitherto unknown.

How to keep a rock crusher
from minding the grind
In a hammermill rock crusher, every revolution of
the rotor shaft puts a heavy shock load on its bear-
ings. Engineers have solved this problem by using
Timken® tapered roller bearings. Timken bearings
take the heaviest loads—both radial and thrust.
They require a minimum of maintenance and
normally last the life of the crusher.
Why TIMKEN® bearings can
take the tough loads
In Timken bearings, the load is carried on a line
of contact between the rolls and races, instead of
being concentrated at a single point. Made of
Timken fine alloy steel, rolls and races are case-
carburized to give a hard, wear-resistant surface
with a tough inner core to withstand shock.

and an impulse sent to the control unit.
There the impulse is transferred into an
increment of pressure on the top side of
the control diaphragm by a complicated
system of bellows and diaphragms. The
increment of pressure on the control dia-
phragm changes the size of the throttling
valve opening and permits the pressure
in the settling chamber to conform to the
desired setting. Air from the University
compressed air supply is fed to the con-
trol diaphragm to provide the force neces-
sary to operate the throttling valve. A
period of 15 to 20 seconds is usually
needed to open or close the valve com-
pletely. Because of this comparatively
long length of time, the pressure in the
settling chamber is not held at a constant
value and the automatic control system
has proved unsatisfactory.
Manual Pressure Control System: A
valve on the control unit may be man-
ually operated to control the supply of air
to the control diaphragm and thereby
operate the throttling valve. The opera-
tion of this valve necessitates an operator
who must make continual adjustments
during a test run if a constant settling
chamber pressure is to be maintained.
Nozzle
The nozzle consists of a rigid frame
with removable nozzle blocks and glass
side plates. It is of the assymetrical type,
i.e., the upper block is designed as one
half of a Laval nozzle, whereas the lower
block is a flat plate. An alternate brass
side plate, perforated to provide static
pressure measuring orifices, is provided.
The % inch glass side plates have shown
a tendency to chip when the side screws
are tightened. Seals are of 1/g inch rubber
tubing compressed between the side walls
and the upper and lower blocks. The
tubes are not pneumatically inflated. The
width of the nozzle is constant at one
inch throughout its length. The area of
the throat is .28 square inches and that of
the test section is 1 square inch. The test
section extends upstream from the end of
the nozzle a distance of 3 inches. The
overall length of the nozzle is approxi-
mately 13.5 inches.
Diffuser
A simple diverging diffuser, made of
% inch plexiglass and approximately 18
inches in overall length, is attached to the
exit end of the nozzle. The included
angle between the upper and lower faces
(Continued fram page 11)
is 6 degrees. The side walls do not di-
verge.
Optical System
A standard two lens schlieren system is
used. The light sources are a 50 watt con-
centrated arc lamp for continuous opera-
tion and a B-H6 GE mercury vapor lamp
for both continuous and flash operation.
A 35 millimeter Kine Exakta camera with
the lens removed is used as a film holder.
For exposures of l/100th second the
shutter is used, whereas for exposures of
6 microseconds an electronic flash unit is
synchronized with the shutter.
Instrumentation
Pressure Measuring System: Fifteen
mercury manometers, each with a length
of travel of approximately 320 centi-
meters, permit measurement of pressure
differentials up to about 60 pounds per
square inch. Fifteen shorter mercury
manometers, each with a length of travel
of about 163 centimeters, permit measure-
ment of pressure differentials up to about
31 pounds per square inch. A Bourdon
type gage is provided to indicate the tank
pressure, and a dial gage on the control
unit indicates the pressure in the settling
chamber. Atmospheric pressure is read
from a conventional mercury barometer.
Temperature Measuring System: At the
present time no temperature measuring
devices are provided; however, the in-
stallation of a storage tank temperature
indicator is being considered.
Test Models
A sting mount for models which may
be injected into the test section through
the diffuser is available. A selection of
the following models is provided:
Wedges: 10-60 degrees
Cones: 10-90 degrees
Hemispherical nosed models
Flat nosed models
A probe, consisting of two hypodermic
needles mounted on the end of the sting
and perforated to provide static and stag-
nation pressure measuring orifices, may be
used. The openings were designed for
minimum interference from the shock
waves formed. The air speed may be
computed from the measured pressures.
The air speed may also be computed by
use of the static pressure measurements
(made at the nozzle with orifices) in the
applicable equations.
Assumptions Made Regarding Air Flow
The following assumptions are made
regarding the flow to permit use of the
one-dimensional equations of motion:
1. The flow is assumed to be adiabatic
throughout its path from the tank to the
atmosphere.
2. Isentropic flow is assumed from the
tank to the throttling valve, but not
through the throttling process.
3. Isentropy is assumed from the throt-
tling valve to the shock, but not through
it.
4. Isentropy is assumed from the shock
to the exit.
5. The pressure in the settling chamber,
which is used as the reservoir pressure, is
assumed to remain constant if it is being
controlled.

tion Used to Calculate Theoretical Flow*

Time Necessary for Recharging Tank:
Approximately nine minutes are required
for recharging the tank from zero gage
pressure. If a test run is made with a con-
trolled settling chamber pressure of 50
pounds per square inch, the storage tank
will retain approximately 50 pounds per
square inch pressure at the end of the run.
In this case the tank may be recharged
in about five minutes.
Lengths of Run: For a simple blow-
down, i.e., when the settling chamber
pressure is assumed to correspond to the
main tank pressure at all times, and on
the basis of the assumptions made re-
garding the flow, the following equation

television show is a delight to see and hear—and it
makes him one of Standard Oil's best salesmen.
More than sweet music
comes from this horn
Let's assume that Standard Oil researchers and
engineers have fully developed and tested a new,
outstandingly improved petroleum product. Let's
assume that the product has been made and dis-
tributed to Standard Oil dealer stations.
What happens then?
That's where Wayne King and all our other sales-
men take over. They inform the public about this
new product. And when the public buys, there's
work for people to do all down the line: work for the
service station man, for the refiner, the pipeline
man, the driller. The more we sell, the more people
we need to make new products. Our present em-
ployees become more secure in their jobs, and new

Good salesmanship, you see, is vital to all of us.
But good salesmen must have good products to sell
—and that is why research and product engineer-

making use of the basic assumptions re-
garding the flok, the following equation
may be derived for the theoretical length
of run:
where t = length of run in seconds
Ti = initial tank temperature
(OR)
pi = initial tank static pressure
po = constant settling chamber
static pressure
p = final tank static pressure
Curves of theoretical and actual lengths
of run for a simple blow-down are shown
in Fig. 3, and curves for the length of
run for different ratios of initial to
throttling pressure are shown in Fig. 4.
Maintenance of a constant settling
chamber pressure increases the length of
run over that obtained if there is no such
pressure control. For example, the length
of run for a simple blow-down from 95
pounds per square inch to 50 pounds per
square inch in the main tank is approxi-
mately 32 seconds. However, if the set-
tling chamber pressure is held at 50
pounds per square inch, the length of run
for the same decrement of main tank
pressure is increased to approximately 40
seconds.
It will be noted that the actual run is
generally longer than the theoretical run.
This may be explained to some extent by
considering the assumption of adiabatic
conditions in the main tank. When the
reservoir pressure decreases, the tempera-
ture also decreases. Since the enclosed
air is not insulated from the walls, there
is probably a transfer of heat from the
walls to the enclosed air. This is essen-
tially an addition of energy to the air and
would give a longer length of run.
Mach Number in the Test Section
Theoretical Mach Number: The nozzle
was designed** to give a Mach number of
2.82 in the test section with uniform flow.
Experimentally Determined.. Mach
Ntimber: By measuring the static pres-
sure in the test section, using the per-
forated side plate, the Mach number was
determined to be approximately 2.67 at
station C as shown on Fig. 5, for an exit
pressure ratio of .07.
Using the probe, the results of five tests
when averaged determined the Mach
number to be approximately 2.69. The
computations were made using the meas-
ured stagnation pressure ratio across the
shock. Again using the probe, and mak-
ing use of the ratio of the measured static
pressure to the main tank pressure, the
results of five tests when averaged deter-
mined the Mach number to be approxi-
mately 2.70.
R*»re*i«&gt;J »r p*nBi*lM t
The experimental results obtained from
these runs agree very well; however, the
number of test runs was small and it re-
mains to be seen whether future data will
indicate the same degree of prevision.
Correlation of Experimental and Theo-
retical Results: The variation between the
theoretical and experimentally determined
Mach numbers may be partially explained
by the fact that corrections for boundary
payer effects were not included in the co-
ordinates of the nozzle when it was de-
signed.
Pressure Distribution in the Nozzle
It will be noted that the regions of
maximum difference between theoretical
and experimental results occur in the
proximity of the throat. This is probably
because the nozzle was designed to give
uniform flow in the test section so that
the best agreement between one-dimen-
sional theory and experiment should be
found in the test section, and because the
flow near the throat is probably three-
dimensional rather than one-dimensional
as assumed.
The upswing in the isentropic super-
sonic flow line near the exit is probably
caused by the propagation of the high
pressure (which exists behind the shock
wave at the exit) upstream through the
boundary layer. The pressures shown
were measured in the boundary layer.
ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANT-
AGES OF THE PRESSURIZED TANK
TYPE OF SUPERSONIC WIND TUNNEL
Advantages
1. The space necessary to enclose the
entire assembly is small.
2. Both initial and operating costs are
low compared with those tunnels having
large test sections.
3. The necessary volume of the tank is
small compared with that of the vacuum
tunnel for the same length of run.
Disadvantages
1. The small size of the test section,
one square inch, necessitates the use of
comparatively small models with attend-
ant difficulties of fabrication and opera-
tion.
2. The noise produced during a test
run is appreciable. Reduction of this
noise would require the installation of
special apparatus.

two to five inches, and are so constructed
that they will fit installations originally
planned for conventional Fairbanks-Morse
trash pumps. The bladeless pumps have
the same general characteristics as ordin-
ary centrifugal pumps, but for a specific
solid size the bladeless pump delivers only
half the volume of liquid delivered by
the conventional pump, but at essentially
the same dynamic head. This is illustrated
on the accompanying performance curves.
The saving in initial cost and operational
expenses in applications where flows are
relatively low will be substantial. Most
important, the extreme non-clog charac-
teristics of the design reduce the require-
ments for attention, maintenance, and
stand-by equipment to a minimum.
In general, the Fairbanks-Morse blade-
less centrifugal pump is an excellent ex-
ample of a design improved by simplifica-
tion. The advantages over conventional
bladed trash pumps have been illustrated,
and the low product damage in food
handling should lead to the solution of
many problems considered impossible.

TO A CAREER IN
ENGINEERING
by J. F. ROBERTS
Manager, Hydraulic Department
General Machinery Division
ALUS-CHALMERS MANUFACTURING COMPANY
(Graduate Training Course 1919)
You have to start somewhere—and as
far as I know, flagpole painting is the
only job where you start at the top. Next
best thing is to get in where there are
many opportunities,
and many interesting,
worthwhile paths to fol-
low—particularly if you
are not entirely sure
just what type of work
you want to do. You
then have a chance to
try more than one field,
and eventually find the
work that will give you
the most in satisfaction and success.

J. F. ROBERTS
Growth of Hydraulics
The field I'm best qualified to discuss is
hydraulic engineering. Crude waterwheels
were man's first mechanical source of
power. Today, in highly perfected modern
form, they're still a major source of abun-
dant, low-cost electric power. The field is
constantly expanding and holds a world
of opportunity. Hydraulic power becomes
increasingly important to the nation as
the need for low-cost power steadily in-
creases. Moreover, a hydraulic plant once
installed produces energy with a mini-
mum of manpower. There's no fuel to
mine, prepare, ship, unload and burn—
small operating personnel is required.
Right now at Allis-Chalmers we're de-
signing and building turbines for vast new
hydro-power projects, not only for the
U.S.A. and Canada, but also for Mexico,
South America, Norway, New Zealand

and the Philippine Islands. We're also
restoring many veteran turbines to bet-
ter-than-original efficiency and capacity
after long years of faithful performance.
Hydraulics was a field that I hadn't
seriously considered as an undergraduate
at the University of Wisconsin. I gradu-
ated as a Mechanical Engineer in 1918,
and entered the Allis-Chalmers Graduate
Training Course in January 1919. It was
there that I got interested in the big
waterwheels.
My first assignment was in steam tur-
bine erection. Then I moved over on the
hydraulic turbine test floor. In May 1919
I was sent to North Carolina on the ac-
ceptance tests of a big hydro-electric
power installation. I continued with hy-
draulic field work such as tests and trouble
shooting until 1925, when I went into the
sales end of the work. Two years later I
left the manufacturing side and became
Hydraulic Engineer for the Power Cor-
poration of Canada, supervising the de-
sign and installation of some 15 plants.
In 1936 I became Hydraulic Engineer
for the U. S. Government TVA, involving
12 projects and 30 large units. I returned
to Allis-Chalmers in 1942 as Manager of
the Hydraulic Department—and had the
unique experience of building some of
the same turbines that I had purchased
for TVA.
Vantage Point for All Industries
These personal notes serve to illustrate
two interesting facts about the Allis-
Chalmers Graduate Training Course.
First, it's tailor-made for each student.
Since 1904, graduate students here have
been helping plan their own courses—
making changes as they went along and
new interests developed. They've had an
opportunity to divide their time between
shop and office—follow important
projects through from drafting board to
installation.
Second, the organization is in close
contact with virtually all phases of indus-
try: hydraulic or steam electric power
plants and utilities; mining, smelting and
rock products; public works; steel and
metal working; textiles; food processing;
flour milling. Allis-Chalmers builds basic
machinery for all these industries and
many more. Its engineers, executives,
salesmen and production experts have a
ringside seat for industry in action.
Graduate students conduct performance
tests of centrifugal pump units.

Electric contacts or "brushes," made of
graphite and used to feed current to mov-
ing parts in motors or generators on high-
altitude aircraft, may have their useful
life increased many thousands of times as
the result of new lubrication methods de-
vised by Robert H. Savage, in the General
Electric Research Laboratory at Schenec-
tady, N. Y.
His discovery about water, in the form
of vapor, for the lubrication of graphite
has changed accepted ideas that this solid
and "slippery" material was a good lubri-
cant in itself. Graphite consists of layers
of atoms which can slide easily over each
other, and it was formerly supposed that
this property was inherent in the graphite
alone.
He has shown, however, that an invis-
ibly thin film of moisture on graphite is
required for its lubrication. Testing the
wear against a revolving copper disk in a
vacuum chamber, he found that dry
graphite brushes were worn as fast as an
inch within one hour. When a small
amount of water vapor was admitted to
INJTHE NEWS
(Continued from page 32)
the chamber, the wear rate was reduced
to less than a thousandth as much.
For electric motors and generators
working on the ground, the wear of
brushes is no great problem, since there is
generally enough water vapor in the air to
provide the lubricating film of moisture.
But modern aircraft, such as jet aircraft,
fly at great altitudes in rarefied air at such
a low temperature that water vapor is al-
most completely absent. Many motors
and generators are required in such
planes. Various methods of treating
brushes chemically to prolong their lives
have been tried, but still further improve-
ment is needed.
Mr. Savage has devised a means of
shielding the parts of electric equipment
where the brushes are used, and supply-
ing water vapor to the space around them.
In tests with this equipment he has found
that brushes which wear out in an hour
without water vapor will last from 2000
to 8000 hours. Certain organic vapors
are more effective than water by a factor
as large as 1000, so that extremely small
concentrations (in the order of parts per
million) provide lubrication.
Automatic Humidity Control
An instrument which records and auto-
matically controls humidity has been an-
nounced by the Western Electrical In-
strument Corporation of Newark, N. J.
Utilizing the psychometric wet and dry
bulb principle, the controller automatically
regulates the wet-bulb (relative-humidity)
depression for which it is set, regardless
of any fluctuations in the dry-bulb tem-
perature.
Two pens operate on a circular 10-inch
chart, simultaneously recording the dry-
bulb temperature and the wet-bulb depres-
sion. The flow of the humidifying agent,
moisture, steam or oil, is regulated by
a valve which is operated by the control
instrument. Tagliabue developed this
control system for all process industries
and utilities, such as textile, chemical, to-
bacco, food, natural gas and many others
which require precise humidity control
during the processing of a product or
material. For applications involving gas,
such as the saturation of natural gas in
the main, bars can be clamped on the case
of the instrument, to make it gas-tight.

LEXIE E. HERRIN II
EDITOR-IN-CHIEF
MICHIGAN SPIRIT
How many times have you
heard someone say to a young
fellow just out of high school,
"Aw you don't want to come
here! All they got here is a
factory."? Every time I hear
this, it makes my blood boil.
If some of these self appoint-
ed dispensers of information
would stop to analyze what
they are saying, they would
realize how silly they are. Or
on the other hand perhaps
they wouldn't.
If the University is such a
factory, and if it is such an
impersonal place, and if it is
too big why in the blazes
don't the gripers do some-
thing about it? There is
ample opportunity. It may be
done through the Engineering
Council, Engineering News,
the professional society and
last, in the TECHNIC.
We on the TECHNIC are
proud of our school! First,
we are proud of the University
of Michigan and secondly, we
are proud of the Engineering
College. This may come as a
HUMAN NATURE
shock to some in the Uni-
versity. To praise the Uni-
versity? Heavens! The man is
out of his head! It is the
fashionable thing to see
how the errors that the ad-
ministration makes can be
magnified. The University is
on its last legs. The Engineer-
ing School exists on an animal
level. This is what some of
the malcontents would have
you believe. Hogwash!!
This editor for one, fully
expects that the University
will still be here when he
graduates—if and when. Ap-
parently, from some of the
criticisms, others do not feel
the same way.
Before you knock the Uni-
versity to a prospective stu-
dent, remember that he is
making a vital decision in his
life and you through irrespon-
sible action can influence that
decision. WEIGH WELL
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!!
HUMAN NATURE
Last month the MICHIGAN
TECHNIC went on sale with-
out the aid of salesmen. The
magazine was placed on tables
in the halls of the Engineer-
ing College with small boxes
nearby for coins. While the
experiment was being carried
out the atmosphere in the
Technic office was one of sus-
pense and tension. Would
or would not the student pay
for the magazines which they
took? Would there be any
money missing?
We are happy to report
that not ONE magazine was
taken without payment. We
are also happy to report that
we had a sellout on our hands.
The engineers are a rare breed
of men and women who can
be trusted. It seems to indi-
cate also that the high pres-
sure type of salesmanship has
the negative effect on the en-
gineers.
The type of sales campaign
that was carried out last
month was just about as in-
offensive as is possible. We
plan to continue this p!an for
as long as is possible. This
little experiment renews our
faith in human nature.

With the speed of a flick of light, photog-
raphy can reduce or enlarge accurately
to scale, and without missing the tiniest detail.
And that's not all.
It can magnify time with the high speed
motion-picture camera so that the fastest mo-
tion can be slowed down for study. It can
record the penetrating x-ray and reveal inter-
nal conditions of materials and products. With
movies and stills, it can repeat a story, time
and again, without the loss of a single detail.
Yes, photography serves business and in-
dustry in many important and valuable ways.
It can work for you, too. If you would like to
know how, please feel free to write for litera-
ture, or for specific information which could
be helpful to you. Eastman Kodak Company,

NOTHING IS STRONGER
... given the facts
NOTHING IS WISER
On Bigness
We are today a much larger country than we were
short years ago. Comparing 1930 with 1948, Federal
government expenditures have grown from $3.6
billion to $40 billion. National income has grown
from $75 billion to $226 billion.
Is small business holding its own with big business
in this growth? Or being driven from the American
scene, concentrating business into a few hands?
In 1900, there were 15 firms for each 1000 people.
Today there are 18. (Apparently small business is
not losing ground.) The average firm has the same
number of employees as at the beginning of the
century.
did large concerns. In 1948, there were in operation
one-third more business units than in 1944.
Can new businesses crowd in and climb to the top?
In 1935, to take the electrical business as an ex-
ample, only 153 companies did over $500,000 busi-
ness. By 1947, there were over 342 companies with
sales in that higher bracket.
General Electric, in spite of its growth during the
past 20 years, has only been able to keep pace with
the growth of industry and of the country. We esti-
mate that our percentage of production in the elec-
trical industry was about 23% in 1930, 25% in 1940,
and is today approximately 24%.
According to a survey by the Federal Reserve Board
covering approximately 2,000 concerns, during the
war, the small and medium-sized firms in total in-
creased their profits, assets and net worth faster than
It is the job of all business and all industry to sup-
ply the ever-expanding needs of people. Big jobs
require big tools. No company and no industry in
the American economy is yet big enough to bring
enough goods to enough people.
