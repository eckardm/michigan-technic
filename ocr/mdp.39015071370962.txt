for a Machine Tool Spindle?



Suppose you were designing a heavy-duty lathe for
precision work—where tolerances as close as one
ten-thousandth of an inch had to be held; where
heavy cuts would be the rule. How would you mount
the work spindle?
If you knew your bearings you would mount the
spindle on TIMKEN Bearings front and rear. Then
you would be assured of permanent spindle rigidity;
freedom from chatter under any cutting load; any
spindle speed; any rate of feed. In other words,
accuracy. The spindle would turn smoothly because
there would be no friction to hamper its movement.
Power demands would be lower. Radial, thrust and
combined loads would be carried safely under all
operating conditions.
By following the above procedure you would be
doing what an overwhelming majority of the lead-
ing heavy-duty machine manufacturers have been
doing for a long time.
If you would like to know more about the application
of TIMKEN Bearings in all kinds of machine tools as
well as in many other kinds of equipment write for
a free copy of the Timken Reference Manual. Know
your bearings—be a better engineer.

ALLOYS
FOR
DEFENSE
In this period when
industry is striving to
meet the needs of
National Defense, re-
searches directed toward
the development of new
alloys are bound to be
undertaken to meet new
but urgent demands.
The high-frequency in-
duction melting equip-
ment housed in the Uni-
versity's metallurgical
laboratories forms an
important part of the
facilities which are available at
Ann Arbor for such work. The pic-
ture shows a heat of steel being
melted in the induction furnace
preparatory to being poured into
the small ingot mold.

The University of Michigan,
in its laboratories, has extensive
research facilities, such as the
high-frequency converter, which
it is prepared to use in connection
with sponsored research.

PROGRESS
OF POWER
Here are some of the major developments in the history
of steam generation since 1867:
Water-tube boiler • Pulverized coal firing • Welded
drums • Stud-tube, water-cooled furnace walls •
Open-pass boiler • Two-stage furnace • Slag-tap
furnace • Advances in working pressures, from
650 lb. in 1922 to 2500 lb. in 1940.
Each of these developments was either originated by
B&amp;W or first made commercially acceptable by B&amp;W,
the oldest and largest manu-
facturer of steam boilers in
this country.
Much of the knowledge of
steam generation that is now
incorporated in your own
textbooks has been given to
the world by B&amp;W engineers.

Pa*t
By
HERBERT J. COULDINC, '93E
Associate Professor Emeritus
of Mechanism and Engineering Drawing
IT was my very good fortune to be
connected with the University of
Michigan for fifty years. Four of these
years were spent in undergraduate work,
a fifth year in advance study, and forty-
five years on the teaching staff of the
College of Engineering.
At the beginning of this period, which
started in the Fall of 1889 and ended
in June 1940, the campus was bounded
by North, East and South University
Avenues and State Street. The only
building off this area was the Astronom-
ical Observatory across from the pres-
ent University Hospital.
The College of Literature, Science
and the Arts occupied the main building
on the campus, which stands back of
Angell Hall. The recitation rooms were
in the north and south wings of this
building. On the lower floor of the
central part were the offices of the
President, Secretary and Treasurer, the
room where chapel services were held,
and one or two class rooms. On the
second floor was the hall where the con-
certs and public lectures were given,
and at least two class rooms. Above
the central section was a dome like that
on the Capitol Building in Washington,
D.C. In time the dome was condemned
and reduced to its present size and
form.
The building to the north, now called
Haven Hall, housed the Law School and
was much smaller than at present.
Around on North University about
where the Chemistry Building now
stands were the two wooden hospital
buildings. On East University stood
the Medical Building with its stately
columns. It was directly east of the
present Economics Building, which at
that time was the Chemistry Building.
The clock which is in the tower of the
West Engineering Annex came from the
library which stood on a part of the site
now occupied by the present library.
The building now known as West Phy-
sics was the original Physics Building.
On the present site of the Clements
Library was a building occupied by the
Dental School. The President's home
was the same as it is today. The
Museum Building is now being used by
the Romance Language Department,
and the heating and lighting plant was
in the building at present used by the
R.O.T.C. unit. A survey of the campus
today will give a good idea of the
growth that has taken place in the last
forty-five years, and should cause the
hearts of the loyal sons and daughters
of Michigan to swell with pride.
There was no Gymnasium. Ferry
Field did not have its Field House,
Intramural Building and tennis courts
which afford the present-day student
such excellent opportunity for physical
development. There were no motion
picture theaters, no dormitories, and no
Union.
The students of this period found
exercise in dancing, swimming in the
Huron River, canoeing and long hikes
over the hills surrounding Ann Arbor.
On Halloween a few indulged in the
sport of hanging gates in tree-tops,
overturning stretches of wooden side-
walks, and moving horseblocks across
the city.
The annual football rush between
the Frosh and Sophs afforded another
bit of exercise. This took place in the
open area bounded by North Univer-
sity, East University, an East and West
line just north of the present Economics
Building, and a North and South line
just east of the present Chemistry
Building.
Male members of each class, number-
ing about two hundred on a side, were
lined up facing north and south with a
stated space between them. The coeds
were on the sidelines to cheer the mem-
bers of their respective classes. The
class facing north was to rush its op-
ponents across the North University
line and the class facing south was to
rush its opponents across the East and
West line just north of the Economics
Building.
The Juniors backed up the Freshmen
and the Seniors the Sophomores. Their
duty was to rush back into the fray any
duffer who had wiggled out for a bit of
relief from the crushing pressure which
had reduced him to half his normal
size. It often took hours to decide the
contest and it is a wonder that there
were so few cracked ribs and broken
legs.
On the Fair Grounds, which were
just south of Hill Street and east of
OCTOBER, 1941


and wrestling contests, the tug-of-war,
and running hop, step, and jump games.
There were two or three tennis courts
on the site of the Alumni Memorial Hall
where Jimmie Angell, son of the Presi-
dent, Professor Louis P. Joscelyn of the
Ann Arbor High School, and a few
other experts played. Later a few
courts were provided for the faculty on
the corner where the South University
portion of the present West Engineering
Building now stands.
fessor Mortimer E. Cooley was ap-
pointed Dean. Within a few years
after the College of Engineering was
established it became evident that in
the near future there would be as many
as five hundred students and provisions
were made for a new building.
Dean Green had blueprints made of
a U-shaped building to cost about $70,-
000. At about this time Professor
Mortimer E. Cooley, then Head of the
Mechanical Engineering Department,
attended a Founder's Day Meeting held

The Campus About 1920
Class football and baseball games
were first played on the corner where
the Frosh-Soph rush was held. Later
they were played on the north end of
Ferry Field which had been donated to
the University.
In the Fall of 1895 the Engineering
College came into being. Previous to
this time the courses leading to the
degrees of Bachelor of Science in Civil,
Mechanical, Electrical and Mining En-
gineering were offered in the College
of Literature, Science and the Arts.
The building which stood on the
present site of the Clements Library
had been vacated by the Dental School
and became the first home of the Col-
lege. The present West Engineering
Building was first occupied in the Fall
of 1904.
Chemical Engineering was given in
the Fall of 1898, Marine Engineering in
1901, and Architecture and Architec-
tural Engineering in 1906. Professor
Charles E. Green, Head of the Civil
Engineering Department, was the first
Dean of the College and the writer was
its first Secretary.
In 1901 Dean Green died and Pro-
on the campus. At the close of the
exercises he was approached by one of
the Regents of the University who
asked him what he thought should be
appropriated for the new building. Pro-
fessor Cooley said that if the Regents
would study the provisions made for
Engineering in the other colleges of our
rank they would give us no less than a
quarter of a million dollars. This they
did and within a year of occupancy the
new building had to be enlarged.
All students entering the University
went to University Hall where they
paid their fees and were enrolled in the
several schools. Before enrolling each
student had to present his credentials
to President James B. Angell, who had
such a retentive memory that he could
call each student by name and tell the
name of the city and the school from
which each came.
In the early years of his Deanship,
it was a pleasure to accompany Dean
Cooley to the Secretary's Office for a
check-up of enrollment. His eyes
would twinkle and he chuckled as each
year the Engineering School attendance
passed that of first one and then another
of the older schools until it became
second to that of the College of Litera-
ture, Science and the Arts, which it
nearly equaled at one time.
As one looks over the faculty list of
the early days it becomes evident that
the College of Engineering never can
have men of a higher caliber. A volume
could be written on each of them but it
will suffice to tell a yarn or two on but
a few.
Professor Ziwet, whom the students
called "Zippy" had a great amount of
trouble in pronouncing his r's, in fact
they all had the w sound. When he
lectured we copied his words as they
sounded. In defining a cycloid he said
it was the path of a point on the 'wim'
of a wheel, and he spoke to us of 'wota-
tion' and 'twanslation'. Between classes
he retired to a room off the classroom
and when he returned he was dabbing
his lips with his handkerchief. We
never investigated.
When a student for the first time
appeared before Assistant Dean Davis
for an excuse, he was scared out of a
year's growth by the deep voice which
asked, "What is your trouble, young
man? Laid up with a cold, were you?
Better wear your rubbers and you will
not get your feet wet." Then followed
a visit and the student left, loving the
man whose heart was as big as all out-
doors. Another bit of advice given by
him was, "Young man, when theory and
practice differ, use your horse sense."
Professor Charles S. Denison, known
to the students as "Denny" and to his
intimates as little Lord Chesterfield,
would go around the free-hand drawing
room inspecting the drawings. He would
stop at a desk, look the work over, and
say in a voice to be heard by all, "Very
good, very good." He would then take
the student's pencil and begin changing
a line here and there, calling out the
changes as they were made, until the
drawing had taken on an entirely new
and correct form. When plans were being
drawn for the new Engineering Build-
ing, he suggested that the East and
South University portions be connected
by an arch over the diagonal walk. This
was done and the archway thus formed
has been called The Denison Archway.
Dean Mortimer E. Cooley did so
much to bring the College of Engineer-
ing to its high standing that it seems a
pity that he could not be kept in control
forever and ever. Many of you who
are here know him. The thousands of
students who knew him during his ac-
tive regime rate him "tops."

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


JUST how is the present condition of
a college of engineering to be mea-
sured? To begin with, we must recog-
nize that this standing or condition will
be a variable quantity depending to a
very considerable extent upon the person
or organization attempting to make the
evaluation. Among the students and
faculty of the College of Engineering
and among the students and faculties of
other divisions on the campus, the repu-
tation may be measured by general
report, and a certain rating may be
determined such as good, very good, or
excellent. Among Michigan graduates
generally a different rating may exist;
and still a third value might be estab-
lished by graduates of the College itself.
But the standing or status in which we
are chiefly interested is the reputation
by which the College of Engineering is
known throughout the United States.
Such a reputation is, of course, produced
to some extent by a melting together of
the opinions held by the various groups
mentioned above, but more especially it
is the result of records made by grad-
uates of the College, and the reputations
of the faculty members, past and present.
Usually, the characteristics of a col-
lege of engineering which cause the
public to regard it highly, or to be in-
different toward it, are influenced by
the following factors: records of alumni,
professional standing of faculty mem-
bers, entrance requirements, curricula,
size of student body, graduate programs
offered, research work in progress, and
equipment.
Alumni and Faculty
Michigan engineering graduates of
the past have made their College known
in every corner of the United States and
in most countries of the world. More
recent alumni are dispersed as widely as
those of previous classes. The College
By
IVAN C. CRAWFORD
Dean, College of Engineering
draws approximately 50 per cent of its
enrollment from outside of the State,
a fact which in itself is an indication of
the place held by the College in the
popular estimation.
For a number of years the announce-
ments of the College laid emphasis on
the professional qualifications of faculty
members. They were men with en-
gineering experience in addition to their
educational qualifications. Recent an-
nouncements do not elaborate on this
point. However, the faculty members
of today occupy distinguished places in
almost any kind of work taken by the
student in high school. He was advised
by the announcements of that time to
present trigonometry, free-hand draw-
ing, chemistry, and manual training.
Recent announcements of the College
of Engineering show that there has not
been any considerable change in admis-
sion requirements. The same amount
of English, foreign language, and mathe-
matics is required. In science, however,
the candidate must now present 2 units
rather than 1 as formerly demanded; of
these 2, 1 must be physics as previously.

West and East Engineering Buildings
their professional fields as did their
predecessors. Many of them are authors
of widely used textbooks and the services
of a number are in demand as con-
sultants.
Entrance Requirements
In the early twenties, a student enter-
ing the College of Engineering from
high school was required to present 3
units of English, 3 of mathematics, 1 of
physics, 1 of history, and 2 of foreign
language. The remaining 5 of the 15
units necessary for entrance might be
It is recommended that the other be
chemistry. As before, the remaining 5
units may be selected from almost any
other subjects which are counted toward
graduation by the accredited high school.
Worthy of note is the fact that the an-
nouncement nowadays advises the stu-
dent to present 4 units of English when-
ever possible.
Many engineering colleges have
dropped the requirement of foreign
language from entrance. Michigan,
following a well-founded tradition of
requiring cultural studies, has retained
this requirement.
OCTOBER, 1941

A comparison of curricula offered 20
years ago with those prepared for the
student of today brings to light im-
mediately one significant difference be-
tween what are otherwise quite similar
programs. Today modern foreign
language is not noted as a required
subject in any of the engineering curri-
cula. In the old days completion of the
Bachelor of Science in Engineering de-
gree called for a stated number of hours
of credit in foreign language and cultural
electives, a total of 16 credit hours. The
languages were definitely specified—
namely, French, German, or Spanish.
Students whose language was other than
English were permitted to substitute
English for the foreign language require-
ment.
The announcements of that time
designated the cultural subjects as
economics, English, fine arts, foreign
language, history, mathematics (ad-
vanced), military science and tactics
(not to exceed 4 hours), music, philoso-
phy, political science, psychology, soci-
ology, and speech.
In current bulletins the term "cultural
studies" has been eliminated and in
place thereof we find the expression
"non-technical electives". Students of
this day are required to complete not
fewer than 5 hours of non-technical elec-
tives and these, as in other days, may
be selected from a rather wide field.
The absence of foreign language from
engineering curricula does not mean that
engineering students no longer enroll in
these courses. A study made last year
shows that nearly one-quarter of the
graduating class had elected French, and
about the same ratio of the class had
elected German. Other favorite non-
technical electives of engineering stu-
dents are astronomy, English, history,
military science, political science, phi-
losophy, Spanish, and psychology.
Enrollment
Admittedly, size is no criterion by
which to judge the effectiveness of an
engineering college. Nevertheless, en-
rollment figures are always of interest.
For the year 1940-41 the Journal of
Engineering Education shows that
among approximately 15O engineering
schools, the College of Engineering of
the University of Michigan stood in
sixth place so far as undergraduate en-
rollment was concerned, with 2052 such
students. Purdue, Texas A. &amp; M.,
Illinois, Georgia Tech., Minnesota,
Michigan, and M.I.T. is the order in
which schools came when ranked accord-
ing to full-time undergraduate enroll-
ment.
Graduate enrollments present quite a
different picture. A ranking of en-
gineering colleges on this basis finds
Michigan in second place and M.I.T.
first.
When undergraduate and graduate

The Arch—A Symbol of The College
of Engineering
enrollments are considered together, we
find Michigan in fifth place, with Pur-
due, Texas A. &amp; M., M.I.T., and Illinois
leading in the order named.
Graduate Work
The year 1921 witnessed a very con-
siderable enrollment for the time in
graduate engineering work at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, a total of SS in all.
Undergraduate enrollment of engineer-
ing students for that year was 2029.
Twenty years later, with almost an
equal enrollment of undergraduate stu-
dents, 2052, there were 209 full-time
graduate students in engineering. This
was the second largest group of full-time
graduate engineering students to be
found in the United States. In the
country at that time—that is, in 1941—
there was a total of 2407 full-time resi-
dent graduate students. Thus Michigan
had approximately 11.4% of the total
enrollment of full-time graduate en-
gineers in this country. The comparison
is made on the basis of full-time resident
students because the University of
Michigan does not conduct graduate
work on a part-time evening basis as is
done in several institutions in the large
industrial centers.
Research
The Engineering Research Depart-
ment was organized in 1920. Prior to
that time research had been carried on
to a considerable extent, but not through
a definitely organized channel. In the
twenty-one years of its existence, this
Department has amply demonstrated its
value through service to industry. Of
course, in addition to the service rend-
ered industry, the Department helps to
develop and nurture the spirit of research
throughout the College of Engineering,
and thus is an important factor both in
graduate and undergraduate instruction.
There probably never was a time in
the history of the College when as much
research was going on in an organized
manner as at the present time. Part of
the volume is due to the war. Immedi-
ately prior to 1940, however, the activi-
ties of the Department of Engineering
Research had been increasing for a
number of years.
Primary Objectives
Consistently, the College of Engineer-
ing of the University of Michigan, al-
though recognizing the well-known fields
of engineering, has been opposed to ex-
treme specialization. All of its engineer-
ing curricula are so designed that the
student, in addition to receiving a broad
fundamental training in engineering, is
given the opportunity and is required to
spend a considerable portion of his time
in the study of English, economics, and
free electives. These may be selected
from a wide variety of courses offered
in the University. Primarily, the Col-
lege is anxious to have its graduates
thoroughly grounded in engineering
fundamentals, but also to have them
receive training in written and vocal
expression and in other so-called lib-
eralizing subjects which the student
may select. This broad undergraduate
training has long been a primary ob-
jective at the University of Michigan.
At times the curricula of engineering
colleges have been criticized by educa-
tors as being too narrowly technical
and therefore lacking in understanding
of the humanities. Occasionally it is
said that these curricula are too spe-
cialized, and it is worth noting that
criticism on this score comes now and
then from teachers and practicing en-
gineers.
Many educators apparently are not
aware that there is considerable differ-

engineering professions. Some of them
have very little in common outside of
the fundamental courses in English,
mathematics, physics, chemistry, and
mechanics. To these educators, divid-
ing the engineering field into civil,
aeronautical, electrical, mechanical,
chemical, and mining and metallurgical
engineering, and naval architecture and
marine engineering is specialization.
Other educators, familiar with the sub-
ject matter, will define specialization
as the breaking down of one of the
engineering professions, such as me-
chanical engineering, into power plant
engineering, automotive engineering,
heating and ventilating engineering, or
refrigeration engineering. The tendency
of twenty-five or thirty years ago to
introduce such specialization into un-
dergraduate programs has disappeared.
Graduate study and experience in the
tion may be given to youth in the
several engineering professions. We all
realize, however, that during the four
or more years spent in gaining the rudi-
ments of engineering, the student also
accumulates much other knowledge and
experience which fit him to live more
effectively and to become a valuable
citizen. We know, too, that each in-
stitution has its own outstanding char-
acteristics, although in general it will
resemble other institutions of a similar
nature.
For its students, the College of En-
gineering of the University of Michigan
provides many advantages, among which
are: the opportunity to work in rela-
tively small classes under mature, quali-
fied instructors who have had the ad-
vantage of practical experience in their
respective fields; to enroll in curricula
which thoroughly cover the fundamen-
tals of the field in which the student is
lege enjoys today—a reputation which
means so much to the recent graduate.
In addition to the advantages enu-
merated above which the College has to
offer, there is present at Michigan the
very real advantage of spending four
years in the atmosphere of a great
University, one drawing students from
the entire nation and from foreign lands.
Reverting now to the topic with
which this article started, the present
status or condition of the College of
Engineering, it is quite clear that the
College has continued to forge ahead.
Room space is lacking to some extent
at the present time, and some labora-
tories are in need of additional modern
equipment. Generally speaking, how-
ever, there can be no doubt that the
present status of the College of En-
gineering compares quite favorably with
conditions which existed at variou?

field are now recognized as the proper
channels through which detailed knowl-
edge of sub-divisions of a general field
may be gained.
What Michigan Offers to its
Engineering Students
Fundamentally, a college of engineer-
ing comes into existence so that instruc-
interested, and which at the same time
contain a fair amount of non-technical
electives; the opportunity to enjoy as-
sociations with graduate students from
all parts of the United States and to
become acquainted with engineering re-
search; and, finally, the privilege to
join the alumni of the College—a group
which for over eighty years has been
helping to build the reputation the Col-
times in its past history. It is also
equally clear that if this status is to be
kept on a satisfactory basis, there must
be continual improvement year by year.
Engineering education is dynamic. A
place in the front rank of American
technical schools can only be assured
to those who keep abreast of the modern
developments in the field of education,
in research, and in professional practice.

announced last spring, there has
been much speculation regarding its
object and purpose. This article is
written to explain these matters.
When Dean Emeritus Mortimer E.
Cooley joined the University of Michi-
gan faculty in 1881, no Engineering
College at the University was in exis-
tence. It was not until 1895 that an
Engineering College was established.
Little aid for expansion has been
possible from the State through these
trying years, for the grants made to the
University by the Legislature are al-
ready of considerable magnitude and
the extent to which they can be expanded
is questionable. Yet the University as
a whole has gone forward through pri-
vate bequests and P.W.A. grants. Thus
substantial support was given to the
Graduate School through grants from
COLLEGE OF
ENGINEERING:
rutute
By
ALBERT E. WHITE
Chairman, Cooley Foundation Committee
When Mortimer E. Cooley was made
Dean of the College in 1904, it was a
relatively small unit. The building
commonly spoken of as Engineering
Shops housed its activities. Under his
guidance the College grew until it be-
came one of the leading engineering
schools in the country. New buildings
were added, such as the West Engineer-
ing Building in 1904 and the East
Engineering Building in 1923. Large
expenditures were made for equipment
and the Dean surrounded himself with a
large and able faculty.
No funds have been available for new
engineering buildings since 1923 and the
grants for new equipment have been
limited. The facilities in most fields
were quite adequate through 1933, but
since that time there has been a growing
need for funds for expansion. For
example, the enrollment in 1931 was
about 1400 and by 1940 it had grown
to about 2400. Yet the budget for the
College was approximately the same as
it was in 1931 and the number of the
faculty had undergone little change.
the Rackham Foundation, to the Dental
School through grants from the Kellogg
Foundation, and to the School of Public
Health from the Kellogg and Rockefeller
Foundations. Through bond issues and
P.W.A. grants, it has been possible to
provide excellent and adequate dormi-
tory facilities for the student body.
These are some of the outstanding de-
velopments of a physical nature which
have taken place at the University dur-
ing the past few years under the regime
of President Ruthven.
It is the vision of those who have
sponsored the Cooley Foundation that
friends of the University interested in
engineering or alumni of the Univer-
sity—Michigan has approximately 16,-
000 living engineering alumni—will
catch this vision and through their
efforts further amplify the facilities in
the Engineering College, so that the
College may continue to hold its place
among the leaders in the field of instruc-
tion and research.
One is frequently asked "What are
the needs of the Engineering College?"
Frankly, they are many. Among the
outstanding ones, are added facilities
for the Automotive Laboratory, the
Electrical Engineering Laboratories, and
the Engineering Mechanics Laboratory.
In addition, valuable additional instruc-
tional work could be given if there were
hydraulic and sanitation laboratories.
The Department of Aeronautics needs
laboratory space and equipment badly.
The Department of Mechanical En-
gineering could use added facilities
advantageously, and the Department of
Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering
is not only badly cramped for space but
needs much more equipment.
Again, funds could be used to ad-
vantage for the further building up of
the Engineering Library and to provide
space, not only for the Library in gen-
eral, but specifically for the Transporta-
tion Library, which already is the out-
standing library in this field in the
country.
Funds could also be used for the
support of professorships over and above
those provided by the State, as well as
for the establishment of scholarships in
addition to those which are already
available to a small number of the
student body.
Although a program might be laid out
on the basis of an intensive drive, as-
surance can be given that the Founda-
tion will not be established in that
manner. Foundations, after all, are not
the result of many small gifts, but are
the result of one or more sizeable be-
quests. The Foundation is established
so that a person who may be interested
in providing funds for a given field can
give the funds for that field. One donor,
for instance, may be interested in spon-
soring an automotive laboratory, an-
other, equipment for chemical engineer-
ing, a third, added library facilities, a
fourth, a hydraulic laboratory.
By acquainting the alumni and others
with the needs of the Engineering Col-
lege, it is expected there will be some
who will catch the vision so that they
will freely and willingly give either of
their time or money for the further
proper expansion of the Engineering
College. This is the hope of Dean Ivan
C. Crawford, who is so ably filling the
position left vacant by the retirement
of Dean M. E. Cooley and his successors.
Already, three groups are working in
the interests of the Foundation. Three
meetings were held with prominent
alumni last year in Detroit, Cleveland,
and New York, and a number of meet-
ings are being planned for this year.

good; the pay of the engineer is
fairly good; the political ability of the
engineer is very poor.
We must admit that his prestige is
good. Witness the mania on the part of
those who have no business with the ti-
tle, for calling themselves engineers. The
dough mixer is a Baking Engineer;
the oyster grower a Biological Engi-
neer; the perfume blender an Odor En-
gineer; the undertaker a Mortuary
Engineer. State registration laws are
beginning to put an end to these self-
bestowed accolades, but they show that
the Engineer has prestige, and that his
title is coveted.
Now as to the pay, there are pub-
lished studies on the pay of engineers
in comparison with the pay of other
professional men. The engineers are
making a living, and quite a good one.
However, no engineer will admit that he
is paid as much as he should be. Let us
say that engineers are paid what they
are worth, and they are worth what they
can get, which puts it up to the indi-
vidual himself.
We now come to the political ability
of the Engineer. This may be denned
as his ability to sell himself, to sell his

ENGINEER
AS A
POLITICIAN
By
DALE W. KAUFMANN, '20E
Chief Engineer

The curse of the engineer is that he
is intensely interested in things, and not
in the least interested in people. This
leads to trouble. The engineer is com-
petent in his dealings with other engi-
neers, on purely professional matters,
but he is often almost hopelessly inept
on matters which we can call political,
as opposed to technical. In other words,
matters involving personalities rather
than things.
Let me again repeat: this leads to
trouble. The purely professional activi-

his fellow men, and in general to take
his place in the scene social and scene
politic to which his industrial achieve-
ments entitle him. It is along these lines
that engineers as a group seem to fail.
ties of the engineer, on which he is in-
variably competent, and often brilliant,
as a rule do not end in themselves.
More often than not, after the engineer
is entirely through with the technical
phase of a matter, it passes to a non-
technical man for final disposition. Ideas
which could be seen and appreciated at
a glance by a brother technologist now
have to be stripped to a-b-c essentials,
and explained in non-technical language.
The idea itself usually has to be sold by
stressing the profit motive, and some-
times the pride motive. At this time a
pleasant and persuasive personality will
often accomplish more than tons of tech-
nology. A recent article in Chemical
and Metallurgical Engineering said in
effect, that during the development of
every engineering project, an answer
must be found to three questions—first,
"Why do it at all?"—second, "Why do
it now?"—and third, "Why do it this
way?" These questions have a political
side even more important than the tech-
nical side.
Let us dig a bit further into the engi-
neer's ineptitude on political matters.
He is repeatedly accused of being self-
centered, immersed in technical matters
to the exclusion of all else, and intol-
erant of lay opinion—in short, an intro-
vert.
Now, there is no use saying engineers
are introverts, and dismissing the mat-
ter with a shrug, as if nothing could b?
done about it. Unfortunately, during
the engineer's schooling and his early
years of practice, much time is needed
for mastering the tools of his profession,
and he often has little time left for
cultivating any dormant gregarious in-
stincts. The final result is definitely
not good. This all-consuming interest in
technical matters, to the exclusion of
interest in people—this obliviousness to
the humanities—is the greatest danger
the engineer must face, and the greatest
obstacle to his success.
This danger is recognized in many
quarters. Witness the urge toward six

1797, beryllium, the metal that is
lighter than aluminum and almost as
strong as steel, was nothing more than

American producers. When Gahagan
tried to obtain licensing rights for him-

ever, when he threatened to take his
information to the French, the Nazis
thought twice. They apparently wanted
to restrict French production even more
than they did American. (In this re-
spect they succeeded admirably, for as
late as 1939 the French were producing
BERYLLIUM,
THE WONDER METAL
By
KEITH SMITH, '43E
During the sky-rocket German infla-
tion following World War I, the great
engineering combine of Siemens Halske
sought to bury its shrinking currency in
industrial research. One of the fruits
of this endeavor was the first commercial
production of beryllium in 1922. That
year a total of less than a pound of the
metal was produced at a cost of $5000
per pound. By 1929, however, Siemens
Halske had boosted production to 2.200
pounds per year, with corresponding re-
ductions in price.
The German process for refining
beryllium is very similar to the Hall
process for aluminum. A mixture of
beryllium oxy-fluoride and barium fluo-
ride is refined by electrolysis in a graph-
ite crucible which serves as an anode.
The process is carried out at a tempera-
ture of 1300°-1400° C, using a water-
cooled iron cathode. This method
produces metal of 99.5% to 99.9f/&gt;
purity.
As the news of German success be-
came known, America became interested
in producing the metal. In 1928 Andrew
H. Gahagan investigated American pat-
ents on the manufacture of the metal.
He discovered that Siemen's patents
had been "assigned" to a mythical
American subsidiary created for the
express purpose of discouraging potential
only about one fifth of one per cent of a
world production of about 500 tons.)
American production restrictions were
by no means ended with the granting of
the license, however. As was the case
in U.S.-Nazi trade relations in optical
goods, aluminum, carboloy and magne-
sium, the Nazis had succeeded in obtain-
ing an agreement dividing world trade
between their respective companies for
the purpose of price stabilization, with
the result, in the case of beryllium, that
England was left out in the cold. In
1938, the British firm of Vickers sought
to buy American beryllium from Gaha-
gan, but Siemens Halske refused to
modify his contract so they could do so.
After threats from Vickers to have Sie-
men's British patents revoked, England
got her beryllium, despite the fact that
the threats seemed idle at the time.
When war broke in 1939, Siemens,
backed by a threat of reprisals after the
war was over, tried to get Gahagan to
cease selling to England. He ignored
the threats.
Another company had simultaneously
made its appearance upon the American
industrial scene, employing patents of
their own invention. This method em-
ploys the electrolysis of beryllium
chloride at 700 C. They had also
pioneered in the production of beryllium-
copper alloys directly from the ore with
blast furnace methods. This company
also was not immune to the Nazi
economic blitz. Using as an example
five British firms who had increased
profit 30% by monopolistic price rais-
ing, "European Interests"—presumably
German—tried to persuade the inde-
pendent manufacturer to "play ball"
with his only competitor. He refused.
Until rumors of German production
of beryllium-nickel alloys put in their
appearance, this Nazi economic skul-
duggery went silently on its way without
the benefit of a Washington investiga-
tion.
With the coming of Be-Ni alloys,
together with the American development
of beryllium-copper alloys, some of the
fantastic possibilities predicted for the
metal began to materialize. An alloy,
developed in Germany, consisting of 2%
beryllium and 98% nickel was shown to
have a tensile strength of 260,000-
300,000 pounds per square inch. This
is as good or better than the best stain-
less steels produced to date. In addition,
whereas the best grade of phosphor
bronze is capable of 400,000 flexes before
becoming useless, and the best alloy
steels are rated at 3,000,000 vibrations;
the Be-Cu alloy was capable of 15,000,-
000,000 flexes and Be-Ni alloy was rated
as high as 20 billion flexes before per-
manent distortion resulted. Beginning
in 1938, the Germans had used a Be-Ni
airplane propeller bushing that was
capable of 40 times the wear of other
bushings; and airplane engine valve
springs made of the material had worn
indefinitely in German Messerschmitts
and Heinkels, while the valve springs
used in other countries' aircraft, with
the exception of our Be-Cu alloy springs,
had to be replaced at frequent intervals.
In 1939 a TNEC monopoly investi-
gation brought to light the facts of the
German development of this metal. In
the face of the story presented, however,
a representative of the German Beryl-
lium Industry took the stand and stated
flatly that the Nazis considered the
metal of very little importance. This
was followed up by a rumor—very pos-
sibly started by the Nazis themselves,
to the effect that the Germans had an
even better metal than Be-Ni in their
bag of tricks. The resulting confusion
caused a somewhat indifferent view of
the metal, and as late as October, 1940,
no move had been made to introduce
Be-Ni into airplane parts. In fact, it
probably could not have been accom-

2. Saw man tearing up old roofing so
he could put on new shingles. Harmless

the man who climbed out on limb and
sawed ditto off.

possibility that he lost a bet, he prob-
ably liked the taste of it.

Engineers are supposed to be con-
structive. Most of them are, but this
summer we saw one poor devil whose
mind had become warped, probably from
trying to explain to a freshman why
you can't add on a slide rule. Anyhow
he had a definitely destructive streak
in his character. Usually his fits were
confined to turpentining dogs and break-
ing windows but at a county fair late
in August something snapped inside his
brain(?) and he went hogwild. The
carnage began when he dropped a fire-
cracker on a pitch-penny board and blew
the coppers all over half a township.
While evading the local gendarmes (who
evidently didn't believe in communism)
he took refuge behind the girl show tent.
There our Mr. Hyde hatched the piece
de resistance, as the Frenchmen, Vichy
and otherwise, are wont to say. So di-
rectly the main avenue of the carnival

was strewn with an assortment of
squealing girls, grass skirts, and musi-
cal instruments. Dynamite? No, the
v'llain had merely looped one of the
ropes supporting the tent around the
rear bumper of a passing car and let na-
ture take its course.

Several fellows were taking life easy
in the living room when the Railway

Quoth he, "Will one of you guys come
here and put your John Henry on this
delivery ticket?" A brother complied.
One look at the signature and the R. E.

committing manslaughter while John
Henry convinced him that John Henry
was John Henry's legal name and be-
sides it wasn't John Henry's fault that
John Henry was named John Henry.

councilman
This year's president of the Engineer-
ing Council will answer to either Bob
or Summy. However, his registration
card would show that he was born in

Bob Summerhays
1920 in Rochester, New York, and was
christened Robert L. Summerhays.
Bob's entire pre-college training was
secured in Rochester. After graduating
from West High School in the spring of
1938, Bob packed his bags and headed
for Michigan. When he entered the Col-
lege of Engineering, Bob brought with
him a bass voice and a capacity to do a
lot of work well.
Shortly after entering Michigan, Bob
pledged Chi Psi fraternity. That spring
he tried out for the Technic and spent
some time working on the advertising
staff. At the end of his freshman year
Bob was elected by his classmates to
represent them on the Engineering
Council. Council activities immediately
claimed a major portion of Bob's time
and he found himself too busy to con-
tinue his work on the Technic.
However, his Technic training was
put to good use for Bob was made Edi-
tor of the Arch, freshman handbook, in
the spring of his sophomore year. Tri-
angles tapped him in the fall of his
junior year and he was treasurer of Tri-
angles during the second semester.
After doing an excellent job as co-
chairman of the Engineering Open
House last spring, Bob was tapped by
Vulcans. Just to top everything off, his
associates on the Engineering Council
selected Bob as their president for the
coming year.
Bob's recreation includes tennis,
squash, sailing, and skiing. While on
the subject of skiing we might mention
that Bob's biggest regret is the size of
Michigan's hills. His sailing ability paid
dividends one summer when he was of-
fered the position of counselor of sailing
at a scout camp.
Technically, Bob is a Mechanical
Engineer with definite leanings toward

first ditch-digger
Professor Hawley was born in Lud-
ington, Michigan, the son of a fruit
farmer in that locality. Even in his
early days an active interest in engineer-
ing was displayed when he built work-
ing models of his father's mowing
machine, threshing machine and wind-
mill. After attending the Ludington
High School he taught in the district
school a short time to help himself get
a start in college.
Professor Hawley's connection with
higher education has been mainly in a
teaching capacity. He began teaching
mathematics in a public school and then
by gradually combining with and chang-
ing over to Mechanical Engineering he
progressed through Grinnell College,
Colorado School of Mines and finally,
the University of Michigan where he is
now a full professor and acting head of
the Mechanical Engineering Depart-
ment. While at Grinnell he organized
two-year pre-engineering courses so that
students could enter the University of
Iowa as junior engineers—very similar
to the situation which exists between
Albion and the University of Michigan.
At the Colorado School of Mines Pro-
fessor Hawley gained much favor for
his work in power plant engineering in
that district. During his stay at the
University of Michigan, Professor Haw-
ley has done much toward the advance-
ment of engineering in his own field. He
designed the first ditch-digger in 1907
followed by other various power plant,
boiler, and flue gas systems of special
design. Recently, he worked as consult-

A new V12, 1800 H.P. airplane motor
developed by Ford has a cast instead
of forged crankshaft, and a cast, one-
piece cylinder block, which features are
said to lend the motor much more ad-
mirably to mass production methods
than previous designs. . . . Lend-lease in
reverse: Arrangements are being made
to sell Brazilian made machine tools to
U. S., Britain. . . . Scarcity of local nat-
ural gas in the East has resulted in drill-
ing of horizontal wells in virgin coal
deposits which result in recovery of
75%-90% of the 500,000,000 cu. ft. of
natural gas lost every 24 hrs. by seep-
age. (As much as 2,000 cu. ft. of gas
per ton of coal in some cases.) Using
recently developed oil drilling methods,
horizontal wells, curved in places to fol-
low the natural contour of the coal beds
can be drilled a mile long. Partial vac-
uum applied in the holes tears the
methane from an intermolecular rela-
tionship with carbon at distances of 400
ft. from the hole. The process results in
untold millions saved in ventilating sys-
tems to carry away the gas, known in
the mines as firedamp, cause of many
deadly mine explosions every year

Germans are still collecting retribution
from World War I. Scrap metal har-
vested from old World War battlefields
have contained some unexploded shells
and "potato mashers," which have
caused extensive damage in German
factories. . . . The government may be
considering reverting to a World War I
brainchild—concrete ships. A builder
claims he can build ships up to 5000

3,400 powder mines and 380 aerial mines
were exploded in making the current
movie, "Sergeant York". Dynamite, char-
coal, balsa wood, cork and artificially
generated powder smoke were used to
give amazing realism to the battle scenes.
Seven tons of dynamite were used to
make shell holes for the battlefield....
Trucking restrictions on petroleum have
been lifted in some states when experi-
ence in England showed it was the only
reliable, flexible method of wartime
transportation. Railroads are bombed
and pipe lines are ruined when you need
them.. . . Planned production of mag-
nesium in 1942 will be 400 million
pounds—13 times 1941 production. Ger-
man power politics have kept down pro-
duction of the metal in the U. S. for
years.... An eastern tool company's
production was exactly doubled in nine
weeks when a three acre plant was re-
cently put up in that record time. . . .
Dope on pipeline vs. tankers transporta-
tion of oil to east coast: 12 in. pipeline
can move 60,000 bbls. per day. Tank-
ship 150,000 bbls. 'day. Discontinuous
service reduces tanker capacity to an
average 4000 bbls. day. 12 in. pipe-
line »= 15 tankships; 20 in. pipeline =
60 tankships; proposed pipeline has to-
tal capacity of 250,000 bbls/day = 61
tankships. Disadvantage of pipeline is
in the 400,000 tons of steel necessary to
build it. . . . Germans are proclaiming
the invention of a new brilliant blue dye,
alizarin chrome blue FFG. It makes
ersatz clothing made of wood look better
anyway—so they say. . . . The Hansgrig
process for making metallic magnesium
went into commercial production August
15. Basic idea of the new process is the
reduction of MgO with carbon in the
2000° C. temperature of an electric arc
furnace. The reversible reaction, which
in past attempts has rendered the proc-
ess useless, is prevented by the high
temperature and by quick cooling in an
inert gas. . . . When a manufacturer of
sealed-beam headlamps found that as-
bestos gloves were insufficient protection
against burns when they were handled
after heat treatment, he solved the prob-
lem by air conditioning the gloves. A
hose connection circulates compressed
air through the gloves, not only protect-
ing the workers, but permitting higher
operating temperatures. ... A new Ger-
man rivet alloy of Al-Cu-Mg can be
worked without previous heat treatment.
The rivets, after the cold working pro-
duced in fastening, have a shear strength
of 34,000 psi. ... A new airscrew devel-
oped by British engineers specifically for
the new 2,000 h.p. airplane engines has
a total weight of but 0.22 lbs. per h.p.
. . . American technical advertising in
its less sane moments, has produced some
amazing proclamations of their client's
loyalty to the National Defense Effort.
Example: Midst action drawings of
charging tanks, diving Airacobras, speed-
ing torpedo boats, bursting shot and
shell and all the acouterments, is the
caption, "Ships for Defense! Tanks for
Defense! Bolts and Nuts for Defense!
Which Comes First?" . . . Details on ex-
plosive rivets: The rivet, containing ex-
plosive in a hole bored in the shank, is
put in place and exploded by heating
the rivet with a special electric iron.
The explosion is controllable within
0.020 in. There are 800 fastenings on
a pursuit plane, and 10,000 on a bomber,
that must be fastened in this manner
because they are accessible from one
side only. ... A new German hydro-
chloric acid resisting alloy is composed
of 11-18% antimony, 0.1%-0.3% beryl-
lium, 5c/( molybdenum and up to 5%
tungsten. Joker in the deck is that steel
with but 0.3% sulfur and phosphorus
content is necessary, something in a
class with hen's teeth in anything but
Swedish and American ores. . . . On the
assumption that what a person under-
stands he is not afraid of, a famous
physicist was asked by the British to
explain what happened when a bomb
exploded. His explanation went some-
thing like this: "As a bomb explodes, a
single wave pulse or sound of very high
frequency is generated. If sounds of all
frequencies and intensities traveled at
the same speed, this high intensity pulse
would retain its shape as it is propa-
gated outward. However, since the elas-
ticity of the medium increases consider-
ably under enormous compression in-
volved in explosions the high pressure
phase breaks away from the center of
the pulse just as the tops of water waves
break ahead near the shore. Thus the
sharp wave of the explosion is smoothed
out at relatively short distances from the
source." That's fine; now nobody's
scared—much.

THE FORGED /STEEL BEARING
OCTOBER, 1941

carbon control
The percentage of carbon in steel can
now be controlled to within 0.05% by
an ingenious instrument developed in
the laboratory of a large manufacturing
company.
A fine iron wire, of known carbon con-
tent, is suspended in an air-tight glass
tube and heated by an electric current
at a predetermined power input. When
the wire reaches 1800° F. a stream of
the test gas is passed through the tube.
After 10 minutes the electric current
is shut off. Because the wire is so small
it "quenches'' by normal cooling, thus
freezing the carbon in solution. The
electrical resistance of the treated sec-
tion is then measured, which gives a pre-
cise, direct indication of the amount of
carbon in the wire. Precision comes
from a peculiar electrical characteristic
of steel. Normal carbon content varies
from zero to about 2'/4 per cent in com-
mercial steels, but this slight chemical
variation produces a change of more
than 330 per cent in electrical resistivity
of the metal. A calibration curve was
made by heat treating two pieces of
steel—one with no carbon and one with
a known carbon content.
In practice the wire is heated and the
gas is varied until the resistance of the
wire corresponds to the desired carbon
content of the steel; then no further
change in the gas is necessary.
The hot-wire instrument will be par-
ticularly valuable in these days of high-
speed metal fabrication. Its original use
was for control of atmospheres for steel-
hardening furnaces, but it can be used
for controlling special atmospheres, as
in sintering metal powders.
production drying
Drying and baking jobs that formerly
took hours are now done in minutes with
infra-red rays produced by incandescent
lamps. These lamps also offer other rich
industrial advantages, including econ-
omy of much-needed floor space, re-
duced spoilage, and lowered costs.
A bottleneck at one plant was the
drying room where freshly painted auto-
mobile heater parts were stored on racks
to air-dry overnight. Drying took a
long time, the racks occupied valuable
factory area, and it was difficult to
maintain uniform quality of finish be-
cause of varying temperature and hu-
midity in the storage room.
Now, painted heater parts are con-
veyed through a tunnel of infra-red
lamps. In 15 minutes they are assem-
bled, ready to be packed and shipped.
While the use of infra-red by indus-
try is not yet very extensive, present
applications and new ones being discov-
ered every day indicate its tremendous
possibilities. Used principally at the mo-
ment for baking industrial finishes, the
process also gives remarkable results on
other heating jobs such as drying, de-
hydrating, and preheating.
The success of heating objects with
infra-red rays lies largely in the fact
that energy is transferred from the heat
source to the work much faster than with
convection or conduction methods. The
penetrating characteristic of the rays is
also an advantage. Part of the radiant
energy is absorbed by the finish, but
more passes through to the material to
which the finish has been applied. That
means there is a heating effect which
proceeds from the base material to the
surface of the paint, thus helping to
eliminate formation of a hard surface
film that would slow up drying.
THE ENGINEER AS A POLITICIAN
year courses in engineering, so that more
studies in the humanities and the fine
arts can be taken. Witness the advice
a few years ago by a prominent educa-
tor that the best way to succeed was to
marry the daughter of the boss. This
advice need not be taken too literally,
but the idea is there—to supplement
technology by politics.
The more painful and distasteful and
against-the-grain it is, the more surely
the engineer needs to get out and mix
with people, until he gets the reputation
of being a good mixer and a friendly
fellow. He need not call himself a hypo-
crite in the process. The engineer has to
deal with human materials as well as
inanimate materials.
Possibly a prerequisite for every engi-
(Continued from page 15)
neering degree should be one year of
work selling household articles from
door to door, so the budding engineer
would either starve to death, or emerge
with a polished, imperturbable, and per-
suasive personality. The introvert can-
not change his essential nature, but he
can at least develop any latent extrovert
tendencies, and acquire a superficial
skill which will at least pass muster.
Some years ago Technocracy was pro-
posed as a form of social structure which
would make Utopia indeed a reality, but
hardly necessary. Technocracy implied
a type of government by technically
trained men, who based every action on
scientifically determined and correlated
facts, rather than political expediency.
Many engineers thought this a splendid
idea, and wondered in just what way
the Technological Revolution could be
brought about. Let it be remembered
by all such, and in fact by all engineers
who are dissatisfied with the way the
world is run, the part they play in it,
and the perversions to which their crea-
tions are put, that the Technological
Revolution will not be brought about
by legal edict.
If and when engineers are able to
hold political power, they will just natu-
rally grab it and hold it. If they are
really able to lead and govern, they will
just naturally become leaders and gov-
ernors. If they are as good as they think
they are, the laws proclaiming Technoc-
racy will be passed only to proclaim the
accomplished fact.

What holds a dive bomber
together at 500 M.P.H.?

The answer is design and con-
struction and materials and
craftsmanship. But accuracy
and finish of parts are also
important in building a plane
to withstand terrific speeds
and that depends on grinding.
Vibration is minimized by
grinding all moving parts of
the power unit to extreme
accuracy. Safer and stronger
threaded parts are ground
with special grinding wheels
such as are made by The
Carborundum Company.
Grinding of threads from the
blank is a comparatively new
development. Threads that are
ground to an almost unbeliev-
able accuracy, free from micro-
scopic checks and cracks! Grind-
ing wheels for airplane manu-
facture constitute only one of
many contributions made to in-
dustry by Carborundum during
its fifty-year existence.


In fact there isn't an industry that has
not been benefited by grinding. No matter
what industry you go into after graduation,
you may run into a grinding problem. And
Carborundum Engineering Service will be
ready to help you solve it! The Carborundum

plished even if they had wanted to, for
Germany held the patents on the ma-
chinery necessary to produce the alloy.
(American producers had difficulty in
preventing excessive oxidation.) This
barrier may have since been removed,
as enemy patents are fair game in war.
Efforts to utilize the extremely light
weight of beryllium (% the weight of
aluminum, ]/4 the weight of iron, ap-
proximately the weight of magnesium)
have thus far produced little results.
The high price of the metal ($15 per
pound), together with the lack of duc-
tility as it is now produced, have tended
to prevent the unalloyed beryllium from
being used for structural purposes. The
metal produced in the laboratory is quite
ductile, but impurities in amounts as
small as 0.2% reduce the ductility to
zero. The discovery of ductile beryllium
would truly be a metallurgical revolu-
tion. The only use of the pure metal to
date has been in X-ray windows, where
it has an X-ray transparency 17 times
that of aluminum.
The most valuable concrete results to
date have been in the field of beryllium
alloys with heavy metals. Although the
ancient Egyptians probably did not use
beryllium in the lost art of producing
their famous tempered copper, the same
result has finally been achieved in beryl-
lium-copper "master" alloys. Beryllium
in varying percentages in the neighbor-
hood of 2% has produced a tempered
copper with tensile strength of 70,000
lbs./sq. in. when untempered, and 190,-
000 lbs./sq. in. after heat treatment.
Alloy steels cannot do much better. In
addition, it is one of the best casting
alloys known. It has a low melting
point, good flow properties, high com-
pressive strength during heat treating
and a thermal conductivity twice that
of steel. The casting properties of Be-
Cu were strikingly demonstrated some
months ago, when the barrel of a Gar-
and rifle, a part generally requiring con-
siderable precision machining, was cast
of the material. The cast was taken
directly from the sand mold, assembled,
and was fired with excellent results. In
addition, the material is non-magnetic
and consequently non-sparking, and is
used extensively in machine tools for
explosives factories, etc. In its tempered
state it has a wear resistance five times
that of phosphor bronze, and can cut
steel plate with ease. Its extreme non-
fatigue properties find use in a wide
variety of springs.
An alloy of 0.4% beryllium, 2.6%
cobalt and the remainder copper has a
tensile strength in wire form of 137,000
lbs. per sq. in. and a conductivity 50%.
that of copper. It is used as electrode
material in welding stainless and other
steels.
The problem of lack of ductility in
the case of pure beryllium may be cir-
cumvented without extreme increase in
weight by alloying it with large amounts
of aluminum. An alloy of 67.5% beryl-
lium and 30.5% aluminum has a tensile
strength of 25,000 lbs./sq. in.
Yield strength .. 19,000 lbs./sq. in.
Elongation 3%/2" specimen
Brinnell hardness No. 86
Specific gravity 2.03
(Specific gravity of aluminum is 2.7,
iron is 7.86)
The properties of this alloy are said
to be very good at operating tempera-
tures of 500°-600°F. This seems to
indicate that the material may prove
extremely useful in airplane motor pis-
tons.
Beryllium added to magnesium base
alloys containing 8% aluminum de-
creases grain size, hinders oxidation
while melting and increases resistance
to corrosion by sea water. In the case
of the latter effect improvements are
noticed with amounts of beryllium as
low as 0.005%.
When it comes to the matter of
alloying magnesium with beryllium base
alloys, conventional alloying methods
break down. Trouble maker is the high
melting point of beryllium, 1300° C, as
compared with 1110°C. for magnesium.
Great promise for the Be-Mg-Al group
of alloys may be found in powder
metallurgy. Although significant de-
velopments in this field may be a long
time in the future, it is entirely possible
that these metals may be nearing per-
fection inside Germany today.
More and more World War II is
becoming a war of scientists and en-
gineers. But, however that may be,
American technologists can continue
their efforts with the knowledge that
Nazi Germany almost gave them the
well-known runaround.

Quite some time ago in Saginaw,
Michigan, a certain young man turned
twenty-one. The first thing he did with
the power of his signature was to cross
ticing on the piano. Music didn't prove
to be only a passing interest, for he be-
came interested in the pipe organ and
today plays both the piano and organ.
When not doing M.E. problems, Ted
listens to his record collection and tries
to decide whether he likes Brahms or
Beethoven best. Still hasn't made up
his mind.
Several cups have been given to Ted,
but he has had trouble getting them. He
cut junior high for the first time and
then discovered he was to have been
awarded a cup that day. Basketball,
tennis, and captaincy of the football
team helped to make Ted the Outstand-
ing Graduating Senior in high school
and gave him another cup. The night
before getting this one, he painted a
large '38, his graduation year, on the
roof of the gym. Ted wasn't expelled
because he and all his companions were
prominent in school activities, and oh,
yes—he happened to be president of his
class!
Ted came to Michigan with a Rack-
ham Undergraduate Scholarship, but
only intended to stay for one year; then
he planned to go to the Naval Academy
at Annapolis. However, his vision wasn't
quite up to snuff, so Michigan has had
him for three years as a Mechanical
Engineer. Ted isn't sorry about these
three years either.
Being a husky fellow, Ted spent one
summer shoveling clay for the State
Highway Department. Last summer he
was in Chicago working for Carnegie
Steel.
Football occupies most of his time
during the pigskin season—Ted is one
of the few engineers on the squad. Last
year he was given the Fielding H. Yost
Honor Award. A.S.M.E., Vulcans, Tri-
angles, and Phi Kappa Psi have him en-
rolled in their memberships. He was
president of Triangles during the second
semester of his Junior year . . . managed
to fall off their truck in last year's tap-
ping.
Incidentally, you will see two Ken-
nedys on the football field this season.
During the game Ted's 3i may be seen

Thirteen years later the engineers of

"engineering age." In 1895 aeronauti-
cal engineering was merely a vague im-

The Engineering Building in 1882
the University of Michigan broke away
from the College of Literature, Science,
and Arts and formed the College of
Engineering. In the years that have
passed since that first step our College
has grown beyond the wildest dreams
of its founders.
In that same period of time the field
of engineering has developed to such an
age in the minds of a few progressive
men. Chemical, metallurgical, and auto-
motive engineering, as we know them
today, were practically non-existent. To-
day, these and the other branches of
engineering play an increasingly impor-
tant part in our civilization.
All these developments in engineer-
ing have placed a heavy responsibility
on the shoulders of those men who have
the job of educating youth for service
in engineering. Our College has, time
and again, met the changing require-
ments of engineering education and has
emerged as one of the leading engineer-
ing schools in the country.
However, we of Michigan—alumni,
faculty, and students—must not rest on
our laurels. There is an old saying that
"good work merits more work." The
good work done in the past by the
College of Engineering has created a
reputation which draws more freshmen
every year. This increased enrollment
places a tax on the College instructors
and College facilities.
It is evident, therefore, that a pro-
gram of expansion is constantly re-
quired. More classrooms, laboratories
and equipment are needed. It was for
this purpose of expansion that the
Cooley Foundation, named in honor of
Dean Cooley, was formed. To fulfill
these plans of expansion it will be neces-
sary for Michigan men and friends of
Michigan to devote both their moral and
financial support to this project. The
Foundation, under the chairmanship of
Professor A. E. White, is making plans
for this expansion, but we must cooper-
ate if these plans are to be realized.
Naturally, we cannot look into the
future with any degree of certainty.
However, we are sure of one thing. In
the future, as in the past, the College of
Engineering of the University of Michi-
gan will move forward as one of the
leading exponents of engineering educa-
tion.

With the aircraft industry stepping up production, more engineers are needed to fill
the jobs created by the resulting expansion. The College of Engineering of the Uni-
versity of Michigan has extensive facilities for the instruction of student engineers in
the design and testing of aircraft engines. Classes are held to acquaint the student
with the elements of aircraft engine design, while the Automotive Engineering Labora-
tory is equipped to give the student an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of
aircraft engine testing.

I KNOW/
IF THE steel for an automobile travelling
between Chicago and Los Angeles at 60 mph
was cold-rolled at a speed of 4.2 mph, how far
is it from Bangor, Maine, to Bankok?
So far as we know there's no answer to this
problem. But then, a few years ago there was
no answer to the problem of cold-rolling steel
strip at these speeds either.
G-E amplidyne control solved this problem,
enabling a Pennsylvania steel plant, the largest,
highest-powered cold-rolling mill for tin-mill
products in the world, to roll out strip at
speeds up to 3850 feet per second, or more
than 43 miles per hour!
G-E motors to the tune of 11,400 hp
respond to the precision control of G-E ampli-
dyne circuits in driving the rolls of the mill at
this speed.

TELE80X
WHEN Dame Nature goes to work on a
television antenna with rain, sleet, and
snow, she can cause no end of transmission
trouble.
G-E television engineers, however, circum-
vent weather changes by housing the antenna
within an electrically heated box. This prevents
seeping moisture from freezing on the antenna
during cold weather and interfering with the
normal patch of high-frequency current flow.
The antenna, at the top of a 128-foot trans-
mitting tower in the heart of Schenectady,
relays the picture waves to G.E.'s main trans-
mitting station in the Helderberg hills 12 miles
away.
On top of the box for relaying the accompany-
ing FM sound is another antenna which also
acts as a lightning rod to protect the tower
and relay equipment.

RESEARCH INC.
HOW a heavy English bulldog and a brawny
Irish washerwoman substantiated the
findings of years of research is described with
an order for fifty miles of Formex wire recently
received by General Electric.
The customer was considering the use of
Formex wire as a substitute for wire whose
insulation had rotted after two or three years of
use, exposing the bare copper. The railroad's
signal engineer was "from Missouri" and wanted
to see for himself whether Formex wire insu-
lation could "take it."
Two 50-foot lengths were strung up. One was
equipped with a metal ring, to which a bulldog
was attached on a leash. The other became a
washerwoman's clothesline. Several weeks
later, after the bulldog had tugged against every
inch of his wire and the washerwoman had
pinched her wire with clothespins from end to
end, the insulation of both lengths was still in
perfect condition.

YOU SPECIFY FOR THE
CRANK SHAFT OF AN OIL
FIELD ENGINE?

If you were called upon to design a
gas, Diesel or steam engine for oil
field work how would you support the
crank shaft? If you knew your bear-
ings you wouldn't have to think twice.
You would do as most of the leading
engine builders do; you would mount
the crank shaft on TIMKEN Tapered
Roller Bearings—single or double,
according to the length of the shaft
and the H.P. of the engine.
This would assure a smoothly-
operating engine that would transmit
its maximum power rating to the job,
for main bearing friction would be
eliminated. Full protection against
both radial and thrust loads would be
assured. Wear on the ends of the crank
shaft would be prevented because all move-
ment takes place within the TIMKEN Bearing
itself. Main bearings would seldom, if ever, have
to be replaced on account of wear. Crank shaft
alignment would be maintained indefinitely.
You can learn a lot more about crank shaft
bearings and many other applications by study-
ing the Timken Reference Manual. We will
gladly send you a copy. Write for it. Know
your bearings—be a better engineer.

The piece of equipment shown was developed as a part of a sponsored research
and determined the correlated cushion contour and spring pressure distribution
which was in each case most comfortable for the person being tested. The most
desirable position and angle of the seat and back in relation to the floor, pedals and
steering wheel position were also determined for over a thousand subjects. This
study permitted the determination of the best condition for the average as well as
the best conditions for all of the wide variations of proportions in humans.

A TAP LOOKS QUITE SIMPLE
BUT...
To make a good tap for a particular job
may require a special kind of steel, expen-
sive automatic machines, milling machines,
accurate grinders that will finish threads to
dimensions much less than a human hair,
and years of experience in heat treatment.
These are some of the reasons why it pays
to look for the "G.T.D. Greenfield" trade
mark on taps and other threading tools —
the mark of the oldest and largest company
in the business.

ST. LAWRENCE SEAWAY
By
FERDINAND N. MENEFEE
Professor of Engineering Mechanics
TF THE St. Lawrence Seaway Treaty
*• between United States and Canada,
which was rejected by the United States
Senate in March 1934, had been rati-
fied and Canada had also approved, the
seaway at the present time would pro-
vide a valuable outlet for much needed
cargoes being manufactured in the Great
Lakes area for use overseas. In addition
to this, any type of naval fighting craft
except battleships and aircraft carriers
could be built and launched on the
Great Lakes, thus relieving the conges-
tion in shipyards on the Atlantic Coast.
While it may not be of great impor-
tance at the present time to have our
defense industries at remote points from
the Atlantic Seaboard the very fact that
the Army has located many of its im-
portant manufacturing units inland indi-
cates that the trend is in that direction
and it is undoubtedly a wise move. Lo-
cation of war industries at points remote
from the seaboard provides protection
against the new types of warfare and
prevents undue strain on industry in the
great industrial areas when the rush
incident to war is on.
Let us make a short survey of the
project as a whole before further dis-
cussing it. The extreme western point
on the Great Lakes is at the city of
Duluth, 1164 miles by boat routes to
the entrance of the St. Lawrence River
at the foot of Lake Ontario. The St.
Lawrence and the Gulf of St. Lawrence
extend 1186 miles from Lake Ontario to
the Atlantic. Thus about one-half of the
route is on the Lakes or connecting
channels and the other half in the St.
Lawrence River itself.
The surface of Lake Superior is 601.5
feet above sea level. Saulte Ste. Marie
Locks lower the boats 21V2 feet into the
St. Mary's River which flows into Lake
Huron. From Lake Huron there is a
drop of 8 feet in the Detroit River to
Lake Erie. Near the eastern end of
Lake Erie the Welland Canal, in a series
of seven locks, lowers the boats 326 feet
to Lake Ontario in a distance of 25
miles. Lake Ontario, 244 feet above sea
level, flows out through the St. Law-
rence River and through the scenic
Thousand Islands portion of the river
between Kingston, Ontario, and Ogdens-
burg, New York. For 67 miles the river
flows along peacefully, after which in
the next 48 miles it drops about 93 feet
in a series of rapids which terminate at
Massena, New York, and Cornwall,
Ontario. It is in this 48-mile stretch
of the river with a 93-foot drop that
the United States is interested. The
northern boundary of New York passes
between Massena and Cornwall and the
river is completely in Canadian territory
from there on. It first flows through
Lake St. Francis with a 1-foot drop, then
in the next 18 miles the river in its
natural course drops 83 feet in the Sou-
langes Rapids and the next 22 miles it
drops 48 feet in the Lachine Rapids, just
above Montreal, at which point its sur-
face is about 20 feet above main sea
level and where the effect of the ocean
tides is felt.
Going back over the route in more de-
tail, we find that there are four parallel
locks at Saulte Ste. Marie, the largest
of which is capable of taking boats of
25-foot draft and the down bound chan-
nels between Saulte Ste. Marie and To-
ledo are likewise dredged to 25 feet.
The present Welland Canal is the
fourth canal built on the Welland site
and was completed in 1934 at a cost of
about 135 million dollars to Canada. It
was built to the specifications of the
proposed seaway with locks 80 feet wide
and 27 feet of water over the sills. Power
for operating the locks is generated by
water power taken from Lake Erie. The
1385 foot guard lock at Fort Colburne
on Lake Erie is the longest lock in the
world.
Thus from Duluth or Chicago or De-
troit down bound boats of 25-foot draft
can go as far as Oswego, New York, or
Toronto, and Hamilton, Ontario. They
cannot at the present time move on
down the St. Lawrence because the locks
in the International Section of the river
above Massena, New York, will accom-
modate boats with a maximum draft of
14 feet. Below Massena the Canadian
Government is building power dams and
locks which will accommodate 25-foot
draft boats. When the rapids in the
93-foot drop of the river above Massena
are drowned out by means of dams with
properly designed locks built to the same
specifications as the Welland Canal, 25-
foot draft boats may come and go from
anywhere on the Great Lakes to any
seaport in the world.
The proposal before the House and
Senate of the United States at the pres-
ent time calls not only for dams and
locks at Massena, New York, but power
plants capable of generating 2 million
horsepower of electrical energy as well,
one-half of which will belong to the
United States.
The proponents of the seaway believe
that its construction will stimulate busi-
ness both industrial and agricultural in
the seaway area of the United States.
This area is composed of 17 states or
parts of states with a population of
about 40 million people. They also
point out the need for the one million
horsepower of electrical energy which
will come to the United States as a re-
sult of the power development.
From all of the studies which have
been made and from the testimony
which has been recorded in the Senate
NOVEMBER, 1941


about the use of the seaway. It is being
used to its capacity today. Even though
the locks and channels will only accom-
modate boats of 14-foot draft or less,
nine million tons of traffic make use of
it during the seven months open season.
The capacity of the proposed im-
proved seaway would be 26 million tons.
Consequently the permissible increase is
only about 17 million tons.
Surveys by the Department of Com-
merce indicate that there is little ques-
tion about there being enough bulk
freight to more than absorb the 13 mil-
lion tons which would constitute the
United States' share. Further surveys
indicate that the savings in transporta-
tion from Chicago to the Atlantic Sea-
board would amount to 4 or 5 dol-
lars per ton. If these estimates are
correct there should be a saving to in-
dustry and agriculture of between SO
and 65 million dollars annually in trans-
portation charges.
If this saving in transportation
charges was accompanied by a corre-
sponding loss to the existing transpor-
roads will have to add to their 1929
capacities regardless of the seaway if
the studies and estimates above-men-
tioned are correct. So it would seem
that looking at the seaway from a trans-
portation standpoint, if savings to in-
dustry can be accomplished and, by
proper coordination of rail and water
facilities, actual financial damage to the
railroads can be averted, a point should
be registered in favor of the project.
Saving of 50 to 65 million dollars,
even though realized, should not be con-
sidered cash across the counter. It is
not a cash income such as is taken in on
the Suez and Panama Canals from tolls.
Furthermore there will have to be an
appropriation each year of from 15 to
20 million dollars to cover costs of inter-
est, operation, maintenance and amor-
tization of the improvement. The figures
quoted are general for the reason that
the United States spends several million
each year in improving channels in the
Great Lakes and probably will continue
to do so regardless of whether the sea-
way is built or not. Under such a con-
dition it is difficult to determine whether

■ I ■
.
iiii'jjif

. capable of generating two million horsepower.
tat ion systems some reason other than
cheaper transportation on 13 million
tons of agricultural and manufacturing
products would have to be found. Stud-
ies of the railroad situation indicate that
at the normal rate of increase in freight
traffic the railroads will have exceeded
their 1929 capacity by about 40'/c. The
13 million tons carried by the seaway
is such a small proportion of the total
carried by the railroads that the rail-
or not such money should be charged
against the estimated costs of the pres-
ent proposed improvement.
Leaving the navigational features for
the time being, it should be pointed out
that the State of New York has agreed
to pay approximately 90 million dollars
for the power which amounts to about
90 dollars a horsepower. Since the first
cost of water power plants is generally
placed at 100 dollars per horsepower, the
price which New York has agreed to
pay is not open to any great amount of
criticism although the New York power
authority has plans for expanding their
public and private power generating
capacity and transmission systems
whereby they expect to save the people
of the State of New York 20 million
dollars a year on their power bill. Some-
one is sure to think of this as a reason
why New York should pay more.
Since official New York City has de-
cided that the seaway will not injure
the business of the Port of New York,
it would seem that with improved trans-
portation facilities for northern New
York and with the benefits which the
New York power authority openly
claims will be theirs, that the State of
New York derives the greatest benefit
from the project. This may reconcile
Senator Wagner who voted against the
project in 1934 for the reason that New
York State would be paying a larger
proportion for the seaway than any
other state because their corporation
and private income tax to the Federal
Government was greater than that of
any other state. Those who oppose the
seaway say that it would be a gateway
through which will pass products and
raw materials originating from other
nations and priced well below their
American equivalents because of lower
wage levels; that it will contribute to
the sort of competition which will in-
evitably cut into the profits of both
industry and agriculture in the seaway
area; that the railroads are in a bad
financial state now and the seaway will
increase their difficulties; that the water-
way will be peculiarly vulnerable to
enemy attack; and that it would border
upon the foolhardy to undertake con-
struction of large ocean ships, either
naval or commercial, on the Great
Lakes.
No one knows the answer, but the
Panama Canal is paying handsomely
and the Southwest railroads are, and
were, prosperous all through the depres-
sion. If other nations have products
and raw materials, priced well below
the American equivalent, which they ex-
pect to dump into the Linked States via
the Seaway, one wonders why they hesi-
tate to enter at our many Atlantic, Gulf,
and Pacific ports now. Can it be that
they do not now come into the Seaway
Area because of the high cost of trans-
portation from the coast and that
coastal state business has an advantage
over Seaway Area business in buying
such goods?

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


By
RUDOLPH A. AXELSON, '42E
TAST year a small group of R.O.T.C.
*-* ordnance students, desiring to find
out more about the ordnance field, got
together to form some sort of organiza-
tion. Upon investigation they learned
that such an organization was already
in existence, in the form of a national
engineering society, the Army Ordnance
Association. It had been founded at
the close of World War I as "a nation-
wide membership society of American
citizens dedicated to industrial pre-
paredness for the national defense of
the United States," and has been prac-
tically the sole bond since then between
the Army Ordnance Service, and the
ever so important link of national
defense, the industrial manufacturer.
Students who were attending technical
schools were eligible for membership,
and already three large engineering
schools had such organizations. On
February 20, 1941 the University of
Michigan Post was presented its charter
by Lieut. Col. L. A. Codd, executive
vice-president of the Association. At
the inaugural dinner to honor the oc-
casion, Brig. Gen. G. M. Barnes, dis-
tinguished alumnus of the University
and assistant chief, Industrial Service,
of the Ordnance Department, spoke to
nearly two hundred Association mem-
bers on "Ordnance Engineering."
The purposes of the Association may
best be summed up as "Pledged to
Industrial Preparedness as Our Strong-
est Guaranty of Peace." It aims to keep
alive an interest in Ordnance material
in a country normally dedicated to
peace. Today's big defense efforts
would undoubtedly be many months, if
not years, behind schedule if it had not
been for the interest and knowledge
exchanged between the Ordnance De-
partment and the civilian manufac-
turers during the past two decades. It
is a purely patriotic organization having
no political, religious, or commercial
affiliations. The only requirements for
membership are that a person be an
American citizen and interested in in-
dustrial preparedness, particularly in
design, procurement, production, manu-
facture, inspection, testing, or supply of
Ordnance material. Today it offers the
engineer and the student a chance to
keep in first hand contact with national
defense work, both through its meetings
and the bi-monthly magazine Army
Ordnance. Student membership costs
three dollars and twenty-five cents
($3.25) a year, which entitles the stu-
dent to a year's subscription to Army
Ordnance besides the regular member-
ship privileges.
At the present date there are about
forty student members of the local post,
This is the first of a series of articles
on Engineering College organizations. Next
month articles on the Engineering Coun-
cil and the American Society of Mechani-
cal Engineers will appear. Articles on the
American Institute of Metallurgical En-
gineers and the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers are scheduled for
January.
and this does not include the regular
members , that are engineers in the
various factories in Ann Arbor, who
also attend the meetings. The officers
of the local post are: president, Ray-
mond Gauthier; vice-president, Douglas
Knight; secretary, Harry Imming; re-
cording secretary and treasurer, Larry
Shipman; publicity committee chair-
man, Rudolph Axelson; Engineering
Council representative, Robert Voss;
and arrangements committee chairman,
Wesley Swift. Also acting as a govern-
ing body, mostly in the capacity of
advisors, is the Executive Committee
consisting of Prof. A. H. White, Major
William E. Renner, and Mr. Arthur
Burgan of the American Broach and
Machine Co.
Already this year the members of
the organization have gone on an in-
spection trip through the new Detroit
Tank Arsenal which was a feature of
the annual meeting of the Association
in Detroit last month. More inspection
trips are planned for the coming year
as well as a visit through the Detroit
Ordnance District Office to see how it
operates in the procuring of the vital
Ordnance supplies for our army. The
Michigan Post is very fortunate in
being situated so close to one of the
industrial centers of the country, for it
affords excellent chances for the mem-
bers to see the latest in plant design
and manufacturing processes on these
inspection trips.
At the first meeting of the current
school year the local post was proud to
be able to present Mr. Francis La-
pointe, General Manager of one of the
leading concerns in Ann Arbor, who
gave an extremely interesting and en-
lightening talk on broaching and its
application to national defense. Mr.
Lapointe has been in the broaching
field all his life, his father being one of
the founders of the industry in this
country about forty years ago. He
explained that although broaching is a
fairly new method of machining metals
it is fast becoming one of the most
sought after, due to its speed and fine
machining characteristics. Such talks
as these by prominent men in Ordnance
work are planned as a regular feature
of the organization's program this year.
It should be emphasized, lest the
wrong impression be given to some stu-
dents, that a member of the organiza-
tion does not have to be an R.O.T.C.
student or connected with the army in
any way. Membership is open to all
students of technical schools who are
American citizens.
During the present time the Associa-
tion feels that it has a very definite part
to play in national defense which was
the purpose of founding it. All en-
gineers are urged and welcome to come
to the local post's meetings to learn
more about the relation between na-
tional defense and the engineering field
that they will undoubtedly be stepping
into during the next few years.

a City Engineer. Some drift into the
job through promotion and some have
it thrust upon them. It certainly re-
quires a considerable amount of knowl-
edge and experience to do the job well,
and unless one has a good staff with di-
versified training I do not believe he
will get along without a lot of headaches.
It is difficult to say whether the City
Engineer is an executive or a technical
expert. He is probably a little of both,
and both are equally important. I have
often thought it took a Jack-of-all-
trades for the job because of the variety
of jobs that need to be done, but unlike
Jack he must be an expert at all of them.
In some cities the City Engineer
sticks pretty well to the technical side,
confining his work principally to prepar-
ing plans and specifications and having
the work constructed on competitive
bidding by contractors. In others, in
addition to the aforementioned, the City
Engineer is in charge of all maintenance
work, and other housekeeping jobs such
as keeping the city clean by the removal
of tons of rubbish and garbage every
day, and keeping the snow and ice off
the city streets in the winter. Regard-
less of which it is there is plenty to
do and it does not lack for excitement,
because the jobs that are undertaken by
a city increase every year.
It wasn't long ago, in the year 1932,
I believe, when the depression became
worse and worse, that the C.W.A., the

jobs, and furnish them quickly. The
City Engineer didn't have much time to
think what he was going to have for
them to do. He was told that the C.W.A.
wanted five hundred, one thousand, two
thousand, or even five thousand men,
depending upon the relief roll in that
city, at work within a week. It wasn't
an easy job to find useful work that
would absorb that many men in a hurry,
but it was done, and this is just an ex-
ample of some of the emergency jobs
that just pop up.
No two jobs are alike, and when one
thinks that everything is under control,
an emergency may arise which calls for
a different solution and the application
of new techniques in the fundamentals

Buffalo's sewage treatment plant
grandfather of the now famous W.P.A.,
was born. The purpose of the C.W.A.
was to furnish jobs for those who had
been thrown out of work because of the
depression. I mean just that, furnish
of the job. Most important, I think, is
engineering common sense. Common
sense, because when you understand the
fundamental engineering principles, it
seems that they are only common sense.
Not less important, the City Engineer
must know his city very well. By that
I mean he has to know the fundamentals
as to why the city exists, and to analyze
those fundamentals in the light of deter-
mining whether those same things will
continue to be the influencing factors in
the continued existence and growth of
the city.
Factors are always changing. Most
notable of which are the changes made
by the automobile. Some cities have
declined because of it. Others have gone
ahead. The automobile has made it pos-
sible for people to live out of the cities
and still have no more inconvenience
than they did when they lived within
the city limits near their place of em-
ployment. Factories have been affected
by the automobile because so much raw
material is shipped by truck transporta-
tion that water and railroad frontage is
not the most important factor.
No doubt after the present war is fin-
ished we will see many other changes in
methods of transportation. The greatly
increased productive capacity of our
airplane plants must find a market and
it is entirely probable that the carrying
of freight by air will be as commonplace
as carrying it by any other means of
transportation.
Trends in retail business are chang-
ing. The automobile has brought this
about. Street cars used to deposit cus-
tomers at a street corner in groups, and
the wise merchant, in seeking a location,
would go where the greatest number of
people unloaded. Street cars are not do-
ing that any more. Instead the customers
come singly or in pairs and park their
cars. This means that what might have
been a good corner before may not be
one now. So the progressive merchants
have, when it was possible, relocated
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


They have relocated where land prices
are less, and they can afford to provide
space for these customers who come
singly or in pairs by automobile. Will
this trend continue or should it be ar-
rested before the entire central business
district has changed?
Even in residential locations there
are big changes. The Federal Housing
Administration insuring mortgages on
homes is relatively new. Before the
F.H.A., people didn't pay much atten-
tion to the locations of their buildings.
Now they find that they can't get a
mortgage on their newly constructed
homes unless the district in which they
live is fairly well protected from bad
influences such as the encroachment of
business uses or small industries. That
changes the picture in so far as where
people are going to live and what utili-
ties they are going to need. Knowing
your city can be pretty important, and
I don't say that you're going to be one
hundred percent correct. Some cities
have city planners to make some of
these guesses, but the majority of them
don't because they figure they can't
spend the extra money for planning for
the future, and that is why it is neces-
sary for the City Engineer to do so. But
after you have analyzed your city in this
manner you are then in a fair position
to proceed to design sewers, water
mains, the widths and types of surfaces
for pavements, location of the principal
traffic arteries, street lighting, grade
separations for railroads and highways,
locations of playgrounds, playfields and
parks, the locations of community cen-
ters, swimming pools, libraries, public
works yards, and a host of things too
numerous to mention.
There is no set of text books that will
tell you how to become a City Engineer.
In the first place there is not a City
Engineer in every cross roads in the
country. A lot of you may start to work
in the office of a City Engineer and
remain a subordinate in the office all
your lives. More City Engineers are
chosen from the ranks of the subordi-
nates than from any other way, and if
you aspire to hold that position some
day, it is good practice to acquaint your-
self with the different jobs that all the
engineers in the office are doing.
Ordinarily the average City Engi-
neer's office is not large enough to have
experts in all the different branches of
engineering. One may know more about
hydraulics. Perhaps another is well
versed in structural work, and maybe a
third may be able to take the worry
off your mind about mechanical equip-
ment, but for the most part, except for
a few instances, no two jobs are alike
which occur in rotation, and research
for each one is necessary.
Some City Engineers, in addition to
having the work aforementioned, must
operate gas plants, or a municipal elec-
trical power system, sewage treatment
plants, water purification plants, all of
which are mighty essential and can't be
shut down. They can't go out of busi-
ness because most of them are operated
as a monopoly, and it is pretty hard to
raise rates after they have once been
established.
than many City Engineers have to con-
tend with. I know of men in subordinate
positions of the City Engineer's office
who have worked continuously for more
than thirty years. I know of many City
Engineers themselves who have spent
their lifetimes at it and it is not uncom-
mon to find men who have held their
positions for twenty years or more.
Many City Managers are chosen from
the ranks of City Engineers, probably
because of the fact that the greatest
problems that confront a city require
engineering knowledge to solve.
Salaries are never at the top of those
in the profession, and in some places
they are miserably inadequate. Tn some
ri*NE.Si!

Cleveland's incinerators
No doubt the present war is going to
have a considerable influence on the
City Engineer's job. If there is to be
actual combat in the United States it
will be a tough job to keep those essen-
tial services operating and to protect
them from sabotage, which by the way,
has been done in the past year and
a half in many cities that I know of.
Thought will have to be given to the
construction of bomb-proof shelters and
their location, where they will be acces-
sible to masses of the population.
Plans are already being made to pro-
vide for unemployment which we antici-
pate will follow the demobilization of
the armed forces, and demobilization of
the forces employed in defense produc-
tion.
A number of people think the City
Engineer is in politics. Quite a large
number of cities have civil service, and
in most of these the City Engineer is
considered a technical man and enjoys
the protection offered by civil service.
As consolation for those who do not
have the protection offered by civil serv-
ice, I can say that I have seen more
politics in different private businesses
instances, with which I am familiar, it is
due to the fact that the city has not
been progressive. It has lost valuation
in assessments, and if we are charitably
inclined, we can excuse the governing
body for paying inadequate salaries. The
job does offer compensation other than
the kind that comes in the pay envelope.
I don't know of any better opportunity
to serve a great number of people, un-
less one becomes president of the United
States. There is a great deal of satis-
faction in making life a little more worth
while for those whom you serve. This
may explain why so many men stick
to the job when they probably could
obtain better remuneration in the em-
ploy of a privately owned industry.
There is never a dull moment even
though no one calls you on the telephone
to give you praise. The only time the
average citizen knows the City Engineer
is when he has done a job in a way that
they think is wrong. And this never
happens on a big job, where really
skilled judgment and technical knowl-
edge were required, but on the little
jobs where everyone considers himself
a curbstone engineer.

Snow, '43E; and I drove up in
front of the administration building of
the River Rouge Plant of the Ford Mo-
tor Company. Here we met Mr. Camp-
bell of the advertising department and
had lunch with him in the executive din-
ing room. We then went across the
street to the Rotunda, a beautiful super-
showroom, where a special guide waited
to show us through the "Rouge," as the
Ford employees call the huge mass of
industrial genius.
As we came up over the railroad
bridge next to the plant, we could see
the 1200 acres of big buildings, smoke-
stacks, coke ovens, furnaces, bridges,
railroad cars, and men. To our left was
the parking lot fdled with employees'
cars, and on our right was the receiving
entrance, with trucks coming and going
every minute of the c'ay. We drove
down the road a quarter of a mile and
turned right at Gate 4, where the guide
showed a pass to admit us.
We then drove to the other side of
the plant to the Rouge River, where big
freighters ply their trade. The company
owns twenty-nine boats and has one and

one-third miles of docks. We stopped
and watched one boat unloading coal.
The loader was a huge framework of
steel which ran the entire length of the
Blast furnace

massive coal yard. The scoop, which
picks up from twelve to seventeen tons
at one bite, is controlled by a man in a
compartment on the scoop itself, and he
rides right down into the hold of the
ship with it.
On the other side of the coal yard is
the "Hi-Line," an elevated railroad
which runs the entire length of the
plant. It is sometimes called the "back-
bone of the Rouge." We saw coal being
loaded onto the hi-line to be distributed
to the various parts of the plant and
to the coke ovens.
The coke ovens, 183 in number, pro-
duce 2400 tons a day plus by-products.
The main by-product is producer gas
which is stored in a tank having a
capacity of ten million cubic feet. Other
by-products from the coke ovens are
coal tar, ammonium sulfate, light motor
oil, motor benzol, and naphthalene. We
watched the men open up one of the
ovens. The white-hot charge was pushed
out into a car which took it down a
track to a house where water was
sprayed on it, sending billows of steam
into the air.
N'ext we went past the power house
where no visitors are allowed. The guide
told us that the power plant produces
470,000 horsepower, enough for the city
of Chicago. Here are housed two of the
biggest generators in the world—power
to run thousands of machines and to
turn the wheels on railroad locomotives.
There are one hundred miles of rail-
road track in the Rouge, and the loco-
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Diesel-electric, and eleven steam. We
saw the row on row of freight cars, for
there are about a thousand on the
grounds at all times.
We next drove past the two blast fur-
naces. They are built so that the iron
from them is poured into kettles on flat
cars and taken in the molten state to
the steel mill. The furnaces are tapped
about every six hours, and together they
produce about 1500 tons of iron per
day.
Xext, we went to the steel mill, a
large building about a quarter of a mile
long, where forty-seven different kinds
of steel are made. The ten open-hearth
furnaces are lined up along one side.
Each furnace holds a charge of 185 tons
of steel, and the entire bank can pro-
duce as much as three thousand tons
a day.
The furnaces are heated with vapor-
ized oil produced in the coke ovens.
Each run takes from twelve to fourteen
hours, and during this time ten test
samples are taken out. The heat from
these furnaces is used to heat the whole
plant.
We stood on a bridge overlooking the
rolling mills and watched the white-hot
ingots being taken from one of the
twenty-seven soaking pits to be rolled
into shape. The pits are kept at 2400
degrees F. The ten-ton ingot is then
run back and forth through the rollers
until it has reached the desired shape.
Some of the ingots are rolled into
sheets and sent to the body building,
which is attached to the steel mill. Here
we watched huge hydraulic presses exert
a pressure of six hundred tons on the
sheet steel, shaping fenders, doors, sides,
and tops. This is done cold, and care
must be taken so that the sheet will not
crack. All around us were piles of body
parts waiting to be picked up.
The final assembly line closed down
at four o'clock, so we hurried to the
assembly building. Here we saw three
assembly lines in operation: one for
Ford cars, one for trucks and station
wagons, and one for Mercuries. Each
line is one thousand feet long. It takes
an hour to assemble a car, and they
come off the line at the rate of one per
minute. We walked down the Ford line
and watched the cars "grow."
First came the frames and under-
carriages. Next the steering column,
followed by the brake and clutch pedals.
The motor was then let down on the
motor mount. In between the assembly
lines were conveyor belts carrying the

Motor assembly and power plant
various parts. The rear bumper came
next, and then the headlamp wiring and
the radiator. After this the hydraulic
system was filled with oil. The battery
was put in place and the rubber body
mounts glued. Then the front end was
let down from the "merry-go-round," an
overhead conveyor. All along men were
checking and tightening bolts. The front
bumper was put in place and then the
body was taken from the body line,
which is an overhead assembly line at
right angles to the final assembly. The
hood was then put in place, followed by
the wheels and tires. Gasoline and wa-
ter were put in, and the cars were
cleaned out.
The cars were then driven through
a water spray where ten fans pour on
seven hundred pounds of water per min-
ute. We went through the spray in a
club coupe. The door leaked in one
place, and the driver drove it back to
be fixed.
We left the assembly building for the
plastic building where we watched them
make parts from soy-bean plastics. Some
plastics are cast into rough molds,
placed under pressure and heated to
form the finished product. In other
parts, the plastic is put in the machines
in the form of coarse grains and the heat
and pressure is applied. No polishing
is needed, for the finish is smooth and
shiny as it comes from the machines.
We saw the new aircraft-engine build-
ing which had been built inside a huge
heated wooden shed so that it would be
ready for use this fall.
Just before we came out, we saw a
"blitz buggy" or "jeep" being put
through its paces—they sure can take it.
A person can't imagine the size of
the "Rouge" until he has seen it. As
we drove out Gate 4 and up over the
bridge, we looked back. Behind us were
the same buildings that we had seen
before, but this time we felt that we
knew a little more about what went on
inside those walls—production for the
pleasure of mankind, and production for
the defense of America.

PIPING: 4-inch glass, 10-foot lengths,
working pressure 100 lbs. per sq. in.
Such a material of construction is
likely to be a surprise to the engineer
whose only professional contact with
glass has been the use of beakers and
test tubes in a Freshman chemistry lab-
oratory. It is one of the newer members
of the remarkable "Pyrex" family.
The industrial members of the "Py-
rex" family are less spectacular than
mammoth telescope lenses, and the like,
but none the less important to engineers
who must maintain purity of corrosive
materials in manufacture. Chemical in-
activity of the retainer is essential to
satisfactory quality; mechanical rugged-
ness is necessary for economical produc-
tion; resistance to thermal shock is a
requirement in many manufacturing
processes. The favorable balance of
these three properties has earned for
borosilicate glass an important place in
the list of materials of construction.
Glass is the generic name for a large
number of fused vitreous materials, most
of which are siliceous. They do not have
a definite crystalline structure; their
molecular arrangement has been com-
pared to " a basket of shrimp." Of the
unlimited number which are theoreti-
cally possible, several hundred are im-
portant for definite uses. This article is
primarily concerned with the borosilicate
type of glass because its very low coef-
ficient thermal expansion makes it re-
markably resistant to sudden changes in
temperature—thermal shock. The type
name, borosilicate, tells its major con-
stituents: borax and silica; there are
small amounts of other oxides present.
The brand name "Pyrex" under which
the great bulk of borosilicate glass is
sold in America is far better known
than its type.
The permanently smooth surface of
glass piping eliminates most of the diffi-
culties of fouling which are encountered
with materials having minute irregulari-
ties of surface in which scale can begin
to collect. Its transparency simplifies
inspection of product; any discoloration
is immediately evident. A glance tells
the whole story of sediment, crystalliza-
tion, condensation or evaporation, which
may be important. The fragile appear-
ance of glass makes workmen naturally
more cautious with it than they would
be with stoneware, carbon or some of
the brittle corrosion-resistant ferrous
alloys. In fact, it is about as rugged as
any of these, but mortality is lessened
by the care its appearance invites.
In addition to the 4-inch pipe, which
was mentioned above, sizes up to three
inches and recommended for 100 lbs.
working pressure are available. The
lengths of joints also go up to 10 feet;
these may be joined by a rather simple
flanged joint. The end of the glass is
thickened to flare it slightly giving a
conical exterior against which a split
metal ring may be clamped to hold the
ends of the glass against a gasket which
seals the joint. The gasket, of course,
must be adapted to the material being
handled, but with the wide variety of
gasket materials which are now avail-
able it is possible to select one which is
satisfactory for almost any liquid over
a rather wide temperature range.
This glass piping presents a slightly
greater problem of support than in the
case of steel piping. However, there is
a lesser problem in the allowance for
expansion with temperature changes,
since the coefficient of expansion for
"Pyrex" piping is about 1/3 that of
steel. About the most unfavorable con-
dition in regard to support is the case
of glass piping handling concentrated
sulfuric acid in which case the maximum
distance between points of support
should be 7 feet. Expansion joints must
be-provided.
In addition to this type of flanged
piping for fluids under pressure, there
is available larger pipe having bell and
spigot joints which is usable for low
pressures. This so-called socket pipe is
available up to 18 inches in diameter.
One of the most surprising of the ad-
ditions to the list of glass mechanical
parts is a centrifugal pump developed
jointly by Nash Engineering Company
and Corning Glass Works.
This pump was especially designed
for corrosive service; it has a capacity
of 6 thousand gallons per hour against
a 65 foot head. The surfaces of the glass
impeller, volute, head plate, and the me-
chanical seal rings are all finished by
grinding to close dimensional tolerances.
One interesting feature of this pump

shaft. With the impeller a hollow stub
shaft is integrally molded, and into this
a grooved metal plug or quill is placed
with sufficient clearance to receive a
molten alloy bonding material. Upon
cooling of the alloy the quill is perma-
nently locked into place so that the im-
peller can be keyed on to the drive shaft
in the conventional manner. The
strength of this type of joint is entirely
adequate for the torque loads encoun-
tered in service of the pump even at the
high temperatures encountered in the
processing of some fluids.
For the fractionation of corrosive
liquids, distilling columns are available
built completely of glass. The construc-
tion is in spool-like sections which are
joined with gasketed joints in approxi-
mately the same manner as the flanged
pipe.
Two sizes have been found to meet
most requirements, these being approxi-
mately 9 and 24 inches in diameter.
They can be assembled to whatever
height is required by using as many sec-
tional spools as demanded for the ma-
terial being distilled. A supporting
framework with multiple points of sup-
port to the glass, individually counter-
poised makes this glass distilling column
extremely rugged. Some have withstood
mechanical stresses which destroyed
surrounding equipment without a break
of any section in the distilling column.
A photograph of one such column is
shown at the right.
We have wandered at some length
from the original subject of heat trans-
fer through glass into the maze of inter-
esting glass mechanical parts. We will
return to the primary subject of this
paper. The construction most frequently
satisfactory for a glass heat interchanger
is the double-pipe type using thin-walled
"Pyrex" piping as the inner member,
jacketing this with a length of standard
iron pipe of appropriate size. Such a
unit can be constructed of any neces-
sary size by connecting in series or
parallel, or both, the required number
of such unit sections. Connections be-
tween the glass inner members are most
satisfactorily accomplished by U-bends
which are joined to straight lengths of
pipe by the flanged end, gasket con-
struction described above. For any spe-
cial shape it is possible to fabricate the
glass tubing into a unit which will per-
mit connection in any reasonable man-
ner. The outside jackets—whether they
contain a heating or cooling medium—
are closed at each end by a stuffing box

Class fractionating column
which may be packed with rubber or
asbestos to seal its joint with the glass.
Interconnections between the metal
jackets are usually a simple problem of
close pipe fitting or rubber hose connec-
tion.
This heat exchanger tubing, which
is identical in most respects with flanged
piping except for the thinner wall, is
available in sizes from 1 to 3 inches in
diameter and up to ten feet in length.
The reason for the thinner wall is that
glass has a relatively low thermal con-
ductivity and thicker sections of glass
are more susceptible to cracking on sud-
den temperature change.
This construction has proven quite
resistant to thermal shock and with units
so built it is possible to flush out the
equipment with steam or hot acid for
cleaning or sterilizing purposes. Such

MALPRACTICES
By
TROY R. YOUNG, '42E
THE casual photographer of today is
a person standing in need of some
missionary work, and I should like to
try to convert a few of you readers from
certain pagan practices in the art of
photography.
The best illustration of the grounds
for my argument lies in the photographs
of such publications as Life. In such
periodicals you may observe the ex-
tremes of technique in the production
of photographic records. At one end of
the scale of photographic excellence are
the war front prints made by small
cameras under poor lighting conditions
and under stress of time and hasty proc-
essing. This type of print records the
fact but commonly displays little photo-
graphic quality, i.e., good tone and a
full use of the emulsion's capabilities.
At the other end of the order of excel-
lence one may observe the thoughtfully
executed print made in this country with
considerable care taken with details of
the exposure and production of the
print. Now, although the making of
prints of the highest quality is arduous
and frequently beyond the equipment
and ability of the casual amateur, by the
elimination of a relatively few, common
malpractices of the photographic proc-
ess, the average photographer can re-
move his prints some distance from the
"war front" category and bring them a
little nearer the satisfying level of the
best of which the art is capable.
Considering first the problem of secur-
ing good definition with the small cam-
era—it should be realized at the outset
by anyone contemplating the purchase
of a small camera, with the intention of
having prints made by projection, that
in no case will he be able to secure as
well denned prints as he would be in
using a larger camera and having
contact prints made from the larger
negatives. The greater the degree of
enlargement, the higher will be the loss
in definition in the final print. It is for
this reason that a majority of technical
photographs such as photomicrographs,
clinical photographs, and photographs
intended for commercial reproduction
are made by large cameras. The per-
• tinent statement here, for the average
picture taker, is that the miniature
camera is fully capable of making ac-
ceptable prints when the camera itself
is a first class instrument and the proc-
essing is carried out in an approved
manner. The malpractice in this connec-
tion lies chiefly in the use of cheap cam-
eras of the 35 mm. type in which less
than the best materials, design, and
methods of fabrication have been used.
The manufacture of a good miniature
camera requires the ability of a first
class instrument maker, and a buyer
should not be misled by the first appear-
ances of values in such cameras of dif-
ferent price ranges. A range finder or
high speed shutter, incorrectly cali-
brated, or a fast lens with uneliminated
aberration is worth less than less pre-
tentious equipment whose calibrations
are accurate and whose optical qualities
are unexaggerated. One nationally ad-
vertised camera manufacturer sells a
camera carrying a lens with an adver-
tised maximum aberration of 1/2000
of an inch circle of confusion—"on the
axis." This correction to 1/2000 inch
is superior to the advertised correction
of lenses made by Leitz, one of the
world's leading optical manufacturers.
However, upon investigation it was re-
vealed that the manufacturer of the in-
expensive American lens "corrected" to
1/2000 did not claim this correction for
the entire field of his lens, just for "the
axis," leaving the most important and
suspect portion of the lens diameter, the
margin, open to free guess as to the
quality of the optical properties. As a
matter of fact, the manufacturer did not
know himself, by his own statement,
what condition the complete field of his
wonder lens was in when it left his plant
on a flashy chassis of chrome and plas-
tic. Here, in my mind, is a clear case of
prostitution of technical specification,
and a common device for the sale of in-
ferior products. "Let the buyer beware!"
Continuing with malpractices, the
next general problem is that of the selec-
tion and use of the film emulsion type.
Jn general there are two types of color
sensitive negative material on the mar-
ket today, orthochromatic and pan-
chromatic. Verichrome and Plus X
Panchromatic are of those types respec-
tively. The panchromatic type is usually
considered to be the emulsion with the
superior response characterises to sub-
ject color. In the panchromatic type
there is a further division of emulsion
types. Using the products of Eastman
Kodak, with which I happen to be most
familiar, as illustrations of these types,
there are three principal emulsions. Pan-
atomic X, Plus X Panchromatic, and
Super XX Panchromatic.
Now, as a matter of photochemical
fact, it is characteristic of light sensitive
emulsions that as their sensitivity to
light, i.e., their "speed," is increased,
there is a corresponding increase in the
size, after development, of the silver
conglomerations that constitute the sil-
ver image. The size of these conglomer-
ations can become large enough to be
objectionable, and even to destroy the
definition or resolving power of the film.
Generally, this grain size increase does
not become excessive until the negative
material is used to make projection
prints of several diameters magnifica-
tion. When fast, grainy materials are
enlarged to any considerable magnifica-
tion in the projection printing process,
the grain size itself is enlarged and in
many instances is apparent enough to
destroy the worth of the picture.
Summarizing then, the case of grain
size and speed: As you select a faster
emulsion for use, you are irrevocably-
cutting down the quality of the prints
you will ultimately be able to make from
your negatives due to the inherent
grainy characteristic of the fast films.
In addition to the increase in grain
size of the emulsion another undesirable
phenomenon occurs when the emulsion

devices; For he counteth the vibra-

flutterings he counteth as a vision of

And his marriage is a simultaneous equa-

It's three o'clock in the morning.
Somebody has turned off the heat and
what we need is a couple of those rac-

dents of a generation ago. We have two
bluebooks waiting for us this morning
and if our minds (sometimes we doubt
the existence of these assets) weren't so
numb they would be yelling for just a
couple of hours rest before the crucial
test. Just to complete the vicious cycle,
we are trying to think of some true
(they must be true) stories of the lighter
side of campus life. Unfortunately, our

trusty bloodhound, who usually smells
out the news for us, got into the Gar-
goyle office by mistake and came out
with such a perverted sense of humor
that we're afraid we are going to have
to put him out of his misery.
Anyway, we are going to resort to
desperate measures. Our resistance is
low and we're going to reprint some old

that we are only going back five years
for this month's reflections (reliable

While trying to make a graceful exit,
we leave this thought with you:

The printer gets all the money,
And the staff gets all the blame.

For an engineer is a strange being, and
is possessed of many evils.
Yea, he speaketh eternally in parables
which he calleth formulae,
And he wieldeth a big stick which he
calleth a slide-rule,
And he hath only one bible, a handbook.
He thinketh only of stresses and strains,
and without end of thermodynamics.
He showeth always a serious aspect, and
picketh his seat in a car by the
springs therein and not by the damsel.
He does not know a waterfall except by
its horsepower, nor a sunset except
that he must turn on the light, nor
a damsel except by her live weight.
Always he carrieth his books with him,
and he entertaineth his sweetheart
with steam tables.
Verily, though his sweetheart expecteth
chocolates when he calleth.
She openth the package but to disclose
samples of iron ore.
And he kisseth her only to test the vis-
cosity of her lips.
For in his eyes there shineth a faraway
look that is neither love nor longing—
rather a vain attempt to recall a for-
mula.
There is but one way to his heart, and
that is Tau Beta Pi and
When his damsel writeth of love and

Taketh these symbols not for kisses, but
rather for unknown quantities.

honor student
We still don't have enough copy to
fill a respectable page so we will have to
delve into our experiences this summer.
We were working in an aircraft en-
gine factory this summer. The hand of
fate had placed us in the experimental
engineering department along with some
other equally inexperienced student en-
gineers.
There we had an opportunity to ob-
serve the truth of the old maxim,
''There's a sucker born every minute."
This one was an honor student from—
well, another Big Ten school. We were
working on an engine setup in an alti-
tude chamber when one of the mechanics
found that several bolts were about a
half inch too short. The immediate an-
swer was a "bolt stretcher" and our
willing novice was sent to the stock
room for the required tool. Straight
faces were maintained until the student
had left the test chamber but the chorus
that rose upon his return would have
put to shame a crowd of Michigan stu-
dents following a cheerleader at a foot-
ball game.
Unfortunately, our hero didn't learn
by experience. A few days later an en-
gine prop was consistently failing to
hold its pitch. On the theory that the
prop was dirty, the student was sent to
the Ex stores for some "prop wash." Of
course, the storeroom was "fresh out"
and our naive honor student returned
to the stand empty handed.

is rendered "faster" in manufacture. The
range of brightnesses of the subject,
which the emulsion is capable of render-
ing accurately, is diminished. That is
to say, if you are photographing a sub-
ject with bright highlights and deep
shadows, the faster the film is, the
shorter a range of brightnesses will the
film be able to reproduce faithfully, and
you will find that in the dark areas, in
the light areas, or in both, the subject
will be flat or lacking in proper con-
trast, and hence of inferior quality.
Looking at the slower emulsions, the
scale length or range of brightnesses
which the emulsion can successfully re-
produce is increased, and the result with
such an emulsion will be a print showing
accurately proportional, realistic grada-
tion from deep shadow to highlight. The
latter makes the superior print.
We have discussed three character-
istics of sensitive emulsions, film speed,
grain size, and scale length. These three
properties are interrelated as shown
above. In general, an increase in the
quality of the emulsion due to control
of one of these properties means a cor-
responding compromise with either or
both of the other characteristics. It is
for this reason that film suppliers mar-
ket more than one panchromatic emul-
sion for amateur use. Panatomic X is
the slowest and finest grained and Super
XX Panchromatic is the fastest and the
film showing the grainiest characteris-
tics. The second emulsion, Plus X Pan-
chromatic, is a compromise emulsion
exhibiting properties intermediate be-
tween the other two films. Plus X Pan-
chromatic film is recommended for
general use when no extreme demand is
to be placed on any one of the film
properties.
The malpractice found in the use of
these three emulsion types lies in the
all too frequent selection of the fastest
emulsion available in the belief that
speed is the only significant character-
istic of the emulsion; we have seen that
two equally important qualities are sac-
rificed when one increases the speed of
the film. In general principle then, in
?electing your panchromatic film, choose
the top speed film only when its supe-
rior speed is actually demanded by light-
ing conditions. It will be found that
with a moderately fast lens, f 3.S, there
is little use for a film as fast as Super
XX Panchromatic except for artificial
lighting conditions where hand-help ex-
posures must be made. For common
use you have a choice between the fine
grain emulsion such as Panatomic X
or Plus X Panchromatic. For outdoor
photography the speed of Panatomic X
is ample and you are providing yourself
with a superior monochromatic rendition
of your subject material as well as a
technically superior negative for enlarg-
ing purposes. The finest emulsion capa-
bilities will be found in such an emul-
sion as Panatomic X as far as the pro-
duction of high quality negative prints
is concerned. If, however, the additional
margin of speed available in the com-
promise emulsion of Plus X Panchro-
matic appeals to you, you may use such
a film with confidence in its grain and
scale characteristics.
As a final word to all who would like
to improve their efforts; above every-
thing else, the one who knows most
about your equipment and materials is
the one who makes them. Follow the di-
rections of the manufacturer in expos-
ing your film, selecting the film, and
processing it, and you will get optimum
results. Photography under artificial
lighting conditions and other special
types of work can be easily carried out,
providing the cameraman will read and
use the knowledge in his directions.
HEAT TRANSFER THROUGH GLASS
(Continued from page 15)
a sudden change in temperature without
damage is made possible by the very
low coefficient of thermal expansion of
borosilicate glass.
With a properly designed installation
it is possible to cool with ordinary cool-
ing water a hot gas at a temperature of
quite a few hundred degrees Fahren-
heit. The construction of such a unit
should not be recommended to one who
is not experienced in the designing of
glass equipment.
In the theoretical aspects of heat
transfer through retaining walls, the
major resistance to heat transmission
most commonly occurs in a semi-stag-
nant film of the material which adheres
to the retaining wall. Since this film
most commonly offers the greater part
of the resistance it is possible to secure
operating capacities with glass equip-
ment which in some cases approach
rather closely those which can be ob-
tained in metal equipment. To the heat
transfer man this would be expressed by
a statement that if the case involves a
film having a low film coefficient, its
resistance is likely to control heat trans-
fer regardless of the resistance of the
retaining wall.
The permanently smooth surface of
glass holds less of such a stagnant film
of liquid and collects much less of scale
than is the case of metal heat exchange
apparatus. This means that the glass
equipment will retain its normal ca-
pacity over a much longer period of
time than would a metal installation.
In many cases the fouling resistance is
the major resistance which must be al-
lowed for in the design of heat transfer
equipment.
Glass piping and heat exchange ap-
paratus finds one of its best utilizations
for corrosion resistance in the industries
handling hot halogens and halogen acids
either pure or along with other sub-
stances. In the case of cooling wet
chlorine from electrolytic cells, glass
equipment is ideal since it is not affected
by the corrosive mixture of warm wet
chlorine and air. The temperatures of
a mixture evolved from electrolytic cells
is likely to be high enough that it would
be extremely corrosive to any metal ex-
posed to it. Wet hydrochloric acid gas
is another material to which glass is
entirely inert. The processing of each
of these materials is concerned to a very
considerable degree with the elimination
of heat and for this the glass heat inter-
changers have very desirable character-
istics.

AS OUR country moves through
^'^ perilous world events, national
defense is uppermost in our minds.
Is defense production fast enough?
Is American industry turning out
the goods? How are American en-
gineers and production men meet-
ing defense problems?
Here's how matters stand at
Westinghouse:
We are engaged in building more
than $300,000,000 worth of equip-
ment for the national defense pro-
gram. On our books are more than
3,600 defense orders. To meet sched-
ules, we must produce $960,000
worth of apparatus every day—
$40,000 every hour—between now
and the end of 1941.
Every one of the Company's 26
manufacturing divisions is working
on national defense projects; most
of them on a three-shift basis.
Employment is at an all-time
peak of 75,000, a gain of more than
25,000 since a year ago. One in three
Westinghouse employees is new.
To avoid delays due to shortages
in materials and to release metals
needed for other defense projects,
substitute materials committees
have been organized in every West-
inghouse plant to find ways to make
use of new materials wherever pos-
sible. One result: our Merchandis-
ing Division alone has found ways
to save 1,500,000 pounds of alumi-
num out of next year's manufac-
turing schedule. That's enough to
build 130 Army bombers.
Many things we are making for
the Navy, Army, and defense in-
dustries are military secrets, but
we can mention:
Parts for control units on anti-
aircraft guns.
Special land, sea, and air radio
equipment for the Army and Navy.
High-speed X-ray equipment, ca-
pable of examining soldiers at the
rate of one a minute.
Army binoculars.
Fluorescent lamps for "blackout"
plants and others.
Secondary networks for defense
plants. These are systems of power
circuits and equipment so arranged
that if one part of the factory is de-
stroyed, current will continue to be
available in all undamaged sections.
Some of the things we're making
for air defense are:
Special meters and instruments
for Army airplanes.
Lightweight generators and volt-
age regulators to supply and control
electric power in Army planes.
Bomb fuses, now being turned
out at a high rate. Production will
be doubled again in a few weeks.
Plastic parts for aircraft, includ-
ing Micarta pulleys and fair leads
to guide the control wires inside
planes.
Radio sending and receiving ap-
paratus.
Lighting systems for airports and
seadrome lights capable of convert-
ing open waterways into landing
bases for seaplanes.
Now at work on propulsion
equipment for more than 100
Navy ships is the Westinghouse
Steam Division plant at South
Philadelphia.
Driving gear for 80 merchant ves-
sels also is being made at this plant.
Besides helping to build our first
lines of defense Westinghouse
is supplying power equipment
urgently needed for the speed-
up of its own and other defense
Industries.
Our East Pittsburgh Works this
year will double its 1940 produc-
tion of generating equipment.
The Generator Division com-
pleted this year the three largest
water-wheel generators in the world
—108,000 kilovolt-ampere giants
for Grand Coulee.
The Motor Division will produce
enough motors in 1941 to develop
2,660,000 horsepower; enough pow-
er to drive all the machinery in 50
steel mills. Majority of these motors
will be driving machinery for defense.
This, in outline, is the way the
Westinghouse Company and
Westinghouse engineers are do-
ing their share in national
defense.

fast feed
Until recently the application of elec-
tric power for directly driving sawmill
carriages has not proven successful in
meeting the high acceleration and re-
tardation requirements. In order to meet
faster production schedules, a new fast
feed log carriage was recently installed
in a South Dakota sawmill. The ap-
plication of the principle of amplidyne
excitation made the installation possible.
Sixteen foot logs are driven back and
forth through a headsaw in less than
six seconds, making more than ten cuts
per minute. One cycle of the carriage,
covering 50 feet is completed in 5.2
seconds. The carriage is hauled back and
forth by '/» inch steel ropes attached
to the ends. The ropes pass over sheave
wheels and are attached to the ends
of a drum located between two 80-
hp motors in such a way that one rope
winds on the drum while the other winds
off. These two motors speed the car-
riage forward through the headsaw at
600 feet per minute and snap it back at
800. Acceleration reaches 10.5 feet per
second. A 125-kw motor-generator set
with amplidyne excitation furnishes
power under adjustable-voltage control.
Electrically tripped emergency brakes
connected to the shafts of the motors
will stop the carriage within six feet.
The stored energy in the carriage is
returned to the electrical system by re-
generative braking; thus the power con-
sumed is only that required to supply
the losses due to heat and resistance.
The regeneration also produces a cush-
ioning action at the end of travel.
plastic body
After twelve years of research with
the purpose in mind of building automo-
biles from the products of the soil,
Henry Ford, through the efforts of Rob-
ert A. Boyer, was able to present a
plastic motor car at a recent celebration
in Dearborn, Michigan. Many versions
of the plastic body have already been
tried by others who were less successful
in their efforts. The main reason for
failure up to the present time has been
that designers have tried to replace
metal parts in characteristic metal
shapes with a plastic material whose
physical properties are not comparable
to metal.
Mr. Ford's version of the plastic body
was designed from the ground up: the
I-beam frame replaced by a more suit-
able tubular one, the deep drawn fend-
ers eliminated to mere flat, body-flush,
wheel coverings, and finally, as a result
of the other new design, the reduction
in total weight allows lighter running

The Mercedes-Benz DB-601A motor
set a world's speed record in 1939. It
was a souped-up version in a Messer-
schmitt Mel09 that traveled 469.2
mph. Now, the standard motor is in-
stalled in the various Messerschmitt and
Heinkel fighters and bombers with com-
parable performance.
The motor compares with the Allison
and Rolls-Royce engines used in Brit-
ish and American fighters. The main
difference in construction being the in-
version of the vee from its position in
the aforementioned motors, providing an
excellent degree of visibility for the pilot
in a single-engine plane.
Comparing the DB-601A with the
Allison and Rolls-Royce, it is found to
have a crankshaft speed of 2400 against
the others' 3000 rpm. This means that
the piston displacement is larger for the
DB-601A. All three motors are 12
cylinder, liquid-cooled, having about the
same dry weight. The Allison takes up
the most room while the Rolls-Royce is
the most compact. Direct fuel injection
is used on the DB-601A, but a more
unique and perhaps the most interesting
feature of the motor is the supercharger

Robert Sibley, President of the Michi-
gan Union was born in a suburb of Ann
Arbor, commonly known as Detroit.
However, his home residence is in Pon-
tiac, Michigan where in his earlier high
school days, he made quite a name for
himself as a journalist. In fact, Bob was
himself on the staff of the Michigan
Technic until he decided that his inter-
est in his fellow men was greater than
his journalistic sense.
As the Union president, his desire is
to make the Union the men's club on
the campus and to make the Student
Offices the focal point of activities. In-
deed, Bob has gone far in this respect,
for the Student Offices are the busiest

Bob Sibley
place on campus. Bob showed us the
list of officers each of which takes part
in five or six activities within the Union.
Sibley is enrolled in the Chemical
Engineering Department, and intends
to remain with it until he receives his
Master's Degree. He worked in indus-
try as an inspector in the Pontiac Divi-
sion of General Motors and in the
metallurgical laboratory, running cor-
rosive tests on chrome plate, previous
to entering college. One thing that Bob
is especially proud of is that he has
worked for his board throughout his
college career. Beginning with the lowly
position of dish-washer at the Michigan
Wolverine, he has worked himself up to
the Vice-President and Secretary on the
Board of Directors. Bob's other achieve-
ments include membership in Triangles
(of which he was president the first se-
mester in 1940), Vulcans, Mimes, Toast-
master Club and Michigamua.
There is one thing that "the busiest
man on campus" makes no bones about,
and that is women. Pertinent to this
subject, he spent one summer "gain-
fully" employed as a milkman. His
route covered a lake resort. He would
rise at three or four in the morning to
"save the babies for the summer." Be-
ing naturally curious as all milkmen,
Bob would survey the lawns as he
passed by, and boy, the scenes!
In his platform for the attainment of
his ambitions, Bob stresses two planks.
First, he wishes to become a Chemical
Engineer (some fellows' wishes are bet-
ter than their work, but not Bob's).
Second, he hopes for a very natural oc-
currence; marriage and children. Three
subordinate desires which he hopes to
accommodate before graduation are:
(1) Tall fellows can not walk down the
street without an awning or two hanging
in their faces; and so, Bob would like
to go down the principal Ann Arbor
streets at four in the morning and cut
off all the awning fringes; (2) Next, he
would like to "bang hell" out of the old
set of chimes in the West Engineering
Annex Tower, that formerly took the
place of the Carillon; and (3) his last
ambition is to pose as an electrician or
or a plumber and thereby gain admit-
tance to a girls' dormitory. (Notice to
Gargoyle: This interview had gone to
press before your rag went on sale.)
Bob is devoting most of his time right
now in the preparations for one of the
big events of the year, the Union For-
mal. All that this busy man needs now
is for someone to call him up for an
interview appointment.

the modern American car.
The use of man-made abrasives made it possible
to finish parts to uniformly close limits of
accuracy. Interchangeable crankshafts, cams,
cylinders, pistons, gears could be produced
in quantity for instant assembly. Better-
built cars became available at new low prices.
And the same mass production methods extended
to other products have helped bring us a new
standard of living.

nois, where he served as a Professor at
Carthage College for four years, was
Miss Olga Olson who has become Mrs.
Peter Field. In 1903, he first came to
the University of Michigan as an in-
structor in mathematics. Obtaining a
leave of absence in 1907, he left for Ger-
many where he studied at the University
of Gottingen. It was here that he first
became acquainted with Stephen Timo-
shenko, a Russian student. (Timoshenko
was destined to become a Professor at
the University of Michigan from 1927
to 1936 and to be later acclaimed by
Professor E. L. Eriksen as the inspira-
tion to the Department of Engineering
Mechanics.)
Returning in 1908 as an Assistant
Professor, he formed a close companion-
ship with Professor Alexander Ziwet
(who during his life was chosen as one
of the 1000 most brilliant men in the
United States). Ziwet and Field to-
gether wrote a text, An Introduction to
Analytical Mechanics, in 1912. In 1914,
they collaborated again on "A Note in
Plane Kinematics," which appeared in
The American Mathematical Monthly.
The friendship was terminated by Pro-
fessor Ziwet's death in 1928.
After serving on the faculty staff as
Associate Professor from 1913 to 1917,
Field's career was interrupted by the
declaration of war with Germany. He
left for Fort Sheridan Training Camp
where three months later he earned the
rank of Captain in the Coast Artillery.
Following a short period at Fort Mon-
roe in the same capacity, he was trans-
ferred to Sandy Hook Proving Ground.
As Major Peter Field in the Ordnance
Division of the Army, he made extensive
ballistic computations.
He has established a recognized repu-
tation as a mathematician and scientist
in many societies among which are The
American Mathematical Society, Mathe-
matical Association of America, Ameri-
can Association for the Advancement of
Science, Society for the Promotion of
Engineering Education and The Army
Ordnance Association. These organiza-
tions have published his articles on vari-
ous subjects like Unicursal Quintic
Curves, Transformation of the Plane
Into Itself, Reciprocal Figures in Space,
Motion of a Disc with Three Supports
on a Rough Plane and The Affect of the
Earth's Rotation on Range.
With a very genial smile, Professor
Field will say that he didn't take school
too seriously, but sincerely advises the
students of today to be ambitious about
their work.

Strictly according to the books, the
smiling face of Robert Wallace, '42E,
should have been seen no more in the
vicinity of Ann Arbor after February,
1939. On the basis of the freshman
scholastic aptitude tests in which Bob
was third from the bottom of his class,
he should have flunked out. Contrarily

Bob Wallace
enough, Bob is going strong at the be-
ginning of his senior year as one of the
top-notch men of his class—and with a
•3.86 average for his three years here.
Bob's extra-curricular activity at
Michigan has been just as outstanding
as his scholastic achievements. As a
freshman, he was a member of Phi Eta
Sigma. In his second year, Bob became
president of that freshman honorary so-
ciety, and last year he served in the
capacity of advisor to the group. For a
while as a freshman, Bob dabbled with
the Union student staff but gave that
up the next year in favor of being a
basketball manager. This year he is
senior manager of the team. At the
present time, in addition to this, Bob
occupies his spare moments functioning
as president of Tau Beta Pi, president
of Theta Delta Chi, his fraternity, and
a member of Vulcans and Michigamua.
In his Junior year, Bob served on the
Engineering Council, was treasurer of
26
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


and was awarded both the A.I.Ch.E.
student award and the Phi Lambda Up-
silon award for having the highest scho-
lastic average in his class.
When asked how he found time for
his many activities outside of studying,
Bob explained that he plans a definite
schedule each day, trying to make each
minute count, and sticking to it. He
attributes this characteristic to a me-
thodical bringing-up which taught him
the value of an arranged program rather
than the hit-or-miss system.
Each year Bob totes his long frame
back to school from Rochester, N.Y.,
where he was born in 1920. He has al-
ways wanted to be an engineer. His
father is a civil engineer, his older
brother a mechanical. Perhaps he didn't
stand much chance of being anything
else. Bob, himself, is a chemical engi-
neer, interested primarily in plastics.
Having refuted the statisticians who
predicted his early removal from col-
lege and feeling fairly confident of escap-
ing the draft, he is planning on graduate
work first in his chosen field. However,
it will most likely be at some other
school. It is quite safe to say that
Michigan's loss will be that school's
sain.

operators and efficient inspection per-
sonnel. Handiwork in polishing of
stressed parts is of the highest order.
The DB-601A general design is
characteristic of the ruggedness and re-
liability of Mercedes-Benz products.
Conservative rating of the motor indi-
cates that performance has been slightly
lessened to improve reliability and in-
creased service life. The power plant is
designed so that modern mass produc-
tion methods with the use of specific
operation tools may be applied.
Materials used in the motor are of
high quality and comparable to Ameri-
can standards. The sparse use of nickel
seems to indicate a shortage at the time
this particular motor was built, but there
was no evident shortage of other alloy-
ing metals. The one exception is the
almost total lack of magnesium alloys;
it seems the fire-bomb industry has pri-
ority over aircraft.
Automatic controls simplify operation
of the motor and leave the pilot free to
fly the plane. Design of the motor
permits take-off with a stone cold mo-
tor. A priming mixture of ether and
gasoline is first used; then another mix-
ture of gasoline and a small quantity of
oil is used until normal operating tem-
peratures are reached when straight
gasoline is finally fed to the engine.
High-output requirement from a cold
motor may be the reason for the use of
so many antifriction bearings in the con-
necting rods and accessory drives. The
performance of the DB-601A motor at
different altitudes, the fuel consumption
and weight seem to be on a par with
other power plants of the same general
type-
By increasing the degree of super-
charging and making other improve-
ments, aircraft power plants usually
undergo an increase in power output.
Estimates in the increase of power from
this 1939 model raise the power output
to a probable rating of 1400 hp of the
current 1941 model.
With heavier planes and larger bomb
and armament loads demanding more
horsepower, it is not at all unlikely that
the basic design of the DB-601A has
been incorporated into an X-type en-
gine. Such a set-up may be the 2400
hp motor reported under construction
in Germany.

ROOM WANTED
FOR some time it has been apparent
that one of the greatest present needs
of the various professional societies of
the College of Engineering is a room
where they could have their headquar-
ters. Many people object because, with
so many students, it would be difficult to
find a room that was not being used for
classwork at some time during the day.
However, there is a great need for
such a room for the professional socie-
ties should have a place to keep their
records and correspondence, to prepare
their publicity material, and to have
their officers' meetings. It would not
take a large room—just big enough for
a table and a dozen chairs, a filing cabi-
net for each society and a typewriter.
Last year the University provided a
good sized room for the Glider Club.
Perhaps this year they could find one
for the professional societies.
In fact it would be better to have two
rooms—one in each engineering build-
ing. The room in West Engine could
be used by A.S.M.E., S.A.E., A.I.E.E.,
A.O.A., and the Engineering Council.
The room in East Engine could be used
by I.Ae.S., A.I.M.E., and A.I.Ch.E
The professional societies of this col-
lege are large—their memberships num-
ber from forty to better than a hundred
—and with the records for so many
members to keep it is difficult to live out
of a drawer in the desk of the faculty
advisor's office. Some of them have been
preparing their publicity in the Tech-
nic office—not that we begrudge them
the use of our office—but they do get
under foot sometimes. The most impor-
tant thing is a place for the society of-
ficers to have their meetings. With such
a place, planning could be done much
more efficiently, which would be of con-
siderable advantage to the societies.
We hope that in the near future the
University can see its way to giving the
professional societies of the college a
"home" of their own.
YOU'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE
IS engineering a profession? This ques-
tion has been bothering engineers for
a good while and is now more important
than ever, since the defense effort has
made such a demand for engineers that
three year men and trade school engi-
neers are not turned away. This trend
towards the recognition of engineers has
long been under the guidance of the
Engineering Council for Professional
Development which is endorsed by all
the leading national professional socie-
ties such as the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers, the Society of
Automotive Engineers and others.
Some say the question of profession-
alism turns on whether engineering is
humanitarian or utilitarian. Admittedly,
the medical and legal professions are
humanitarian. The doctors keep a man
well in mind and body and the lawyers
keep him out of trouble. The poor en-
gineer just sits around designing ma-
chines that couldn't get sick or in jail
if they wanted to. Not so. The engineer
designs his machines to comfort man-
kind. Why was the closed car built?
So a man could drive his girl around
in the rain and not catch double pneu-
monia. Why are shiftless transmissions
put in automobiles? So man won't wear
out his already much bent elbow. Why
are safety factors put in the design of
bridge cables? So man won't break out
in a cold sweat worrying about whether
or not he'll get across the river without
a free bath. In other words just about
everything that engineers do (with the
unfortunate exception of the military
engineers) is to make life more com-
fortable, easier, and more secure for his
fellow men.
We feel this automatically puts the
gold star after the engineer's name with-
out state legislators passing bills pro-
claiming him a professional man.

construction. Though it sounds more compli-
cated, a double-flow turbine operates at higher
speed, weighs less, and occupies less space than
a single-flow one. All these are distinct advan-
tages when the equipment has to be installed
in a ship, where space is at a premium. And in
times like these, when turbines must be turned
out in a hurry, the smaller metal parts required
represent an advantage in manufacture, too.
General Electric, which has probably built
as many naval and marine turbines as any
other single manufacturer, is right now making
more of them than at any time in its history.
And by raking advantage of every engineering
and manufacturing advance, it is turning them
out on what approaches a mass-production
basis.

specify for a Steel Rolling Mill?

Let's assume that you were asked to design
a 4-high continuous strip steel rolling mill to
operate at a rolling speed of 2,000 feet per
minute. What bearings would you select for
the necks of the back-up and work rolls?
If you knew your bearings you would specify
Timken Roll Neck Bearings. Then you would
be sure of smooth mill performance at a
speeds; steel rolled true to gauge at all times;
simplified lubrication; long bearing life (Timken
Roll Neck Bearings hold all records for ton-
nage rolled); easy roll changing (no delicate
parts to handle); fewer involuntary produc-
tion interruptions.
This is but one of thousands of bearing appli-
cations in industrial machinery where Timken
Bearings have proved their supremacy. When
you have gained a thorough knowledge of
Timken Bearings you will be in position to solve
any bearing problem you may ever encounter.

In spite of this apparently authentic reproduction, there is not,
there never has been, and there probably never will be a wom-

TO DIVERT THE
COLORADO
Imperial Dam


By
ALBERT E. WHITE
Director of Department of Engineering Research
UHPHE Romance of Research" is a
*. phrase with which to conjure. It
brings to mind the picture of a 17-year-
old boy watching a lamp set swinging
in the beautiful Cathedral of Pisa, little
realizing that fifty years later he would
apply the theory based on this observa-
tion to an astronomical clock.
Then memory shows us a youth sit-
ting in a small kitchen watching and
thinking about the force of steam as
the lid of the old teakettle goes up and
down. Little did this boy, who was fas-
cinated by the action of the steam,
dream of the use to be made of its
power in 1941, in driving our newest
and mightiest battleship at a speed of
nearly forty miles per hour, or in ro-
tating the shafts in modern turbines
which are used in creating electricity
to light entire cities and provide the
motive power for great factories.
Or we see another man, toiling into
the morning hours, trying first one and
then another of his thousands of ma-
terials to find the one which would make
a suitable filament for the electric light.
So great are the ramifications of re-
search that it is difficult to define it.
According to Mr. C. F. Hirshfeld in his
recent paper on "Research in Industry,"
it is "an orderly scientifically conducted
search for the nearest approach to the
absolute truth that is at the time dis-
coverable." Although scientific work,
particularly in mathematics and astron-
omy, was done by the Hindus, Arabs,
and others before the sixth century
B. C, the early outstanding contri-
butions were made in the Grecian pe-
riod by such well-known men as Aris-
totle, Euclid, and Archimedes. In the
next 10 or 12 centuries little scientific
work was done. In fact, not until the
13 th century did the renaissance of
science begin. Starting with the contri-
butions of Roger Bacon, we find those
of Gutenberg in printing, Copernicus
and Galileo in astronomy, Isaac New-
ton in mechanics, and others, as mile-
stones in the progress of research. The
late 18th and early 19th centuries are
rich in the memory of those who laid the
foundations of much of our modern
science. This period included such per-
sons as Priestley, Rumford, Carnot,
Dalton, Ampere, Davey, Faraday, and
Pasteur. From then on, scientific re-
search has steadily progressed.
Science honors the work of such per-
sons as Morse, Bessemer, Kelvin, Max-
well, Roentgen, Bell, Edison, Gibbs,
Michelson, the Curies, Einstein, and
many others.
Only during about the past 100 years,
however, has our method of life been
so affected by scientific findings as to
make material changes in our civiliza-
tion. The use of steam for industrial
purposes has been one of the great fac-
tors in this change. Its influence was
particularly pronounced during the first
70 to 80 years of this period and it is
still a great factor. During the first
half of this period, Sir Henry Bessemer
revolutionized steel making through de-
velopment of the Bessemer process,
making it possible to obtain steel at
such a price that it could take its place
in the developing of transportation and
in the construction needs of the world.
Also, this period produced the cotton
gin, so important to the agricultural in-
terests of the South, and the reaper that
has proved such a boon to farmers, as
well as Morse's outstanding invention of
the telegraph. It is well stated, that, if
Napoleon had had available telegraphic
communication on his advance into Rus-
sia, the tragedy of his empty victory—
at least from his standpoint—with the
resultant loss of 450,000 men, would
never have occurred.
Yet modern life as we know it today
has substantially existed only since the
period of Thomas A. Edison's activities
from about 1870 to the present time. In
this period, the physical aspects of our
civilization have undergone the pro-
foundest change. Thomas A. Edison,
through his research contributions,
played a dynamic part in these changes.
To him we owe the carbon filament
lamp—though others would have
brought out such a lamp had he not
done so—which first made possible the
use of electricity for the illumination
of our homes. He laid the foundations
for our phonographic reproductions of
the present day, and he also materially
contributed to the moving picture in-
dustry.
To be sure, these great contributions
have undergone a material change. For
instance, the vacuum carbon filament
lamp has been replaced by an argon-
filled tungsten filament lamp as a re-
sult of research developments emanat-
ing from the General Electric Research
Laboratories. This one development has
saved the general public at least two
billion dollars annually.
As a result of sound studies by the
research laboratories of the American
Telephone and Telegraph Company and
the General Electric Research Labora-
tories, the phonograph has made great
advances. It is now possible to obtain
distortionless reproductions that make
the records of yesterday obsolete. The
phonograph and the electric lamp, of
course, are only two of the many Edison
inventions, yet they serve as illustrations
of the tremendous impact which one in-
dividual can have upon civilization.
One of our earlier economists has
stated that the three fundamental re-
quirements for life are food, clothing,
and shelter. Though there has been little
change through the centuries in the
types of food used for human consump-

place in making various foods available
at all seasons. The development of tin
plate has played a large part in the
growth and expansion of the canning
industry. The part it has played is so
large that ours is sometimes spoken of
as the "tin can age." Within the past
decade, methods have been developed

Core drilling
for the freezing of meat, fish, fruits, and
vegetables which make these products
available at all times, with a flavor ap-
proximating, if not identical to, that of
the fresh products themselves.
There is a romance to these develop-
ments which we frequently lose sight
of as we step into the store and buy
out-of-season delicacies. Again going
back to the farm, which is the source of
our foods, research has played an all-
important part through the development
of cream separators, tractors, fertilizers,
insecticides, and many other develop-
ments which have increased the produc-
tivity of the soil, saved the crops from
the ravages of insects, and multiplied
many-fold, through the use of machin-
ery, the available man-power on the
farm.
The use of cotton, wool, and silk as
articles for clothing has been known
for centuries. The developments which
have taken place in the clothing field,
until about 20 years ago, were mainly
related to the methods which were used
for the production of the fabrics. The
power-operated loom was probably the
greatest single contribution in this field,
for previously the fabrics were made by
hand under the most laborious of condi-
tions. Within the past 20 years, rayon
has taken its place as one of the impor-
tant fabrics. This is commonly known
as artificial silk and by many it may be
viewed as a relatively recent invention.
Yet, as a matter of fact, the basis for
this industry was laid in 1846 by Schon-
bein and the first samples of this ma-
terial were exhibited by Count Char-
donnet in 1889. Probably the latest de-
velopment of moment in the clothing
field relates to the use of glass. This is
normally viewed as a product exceed-
ingly brittle and absolutely valueless
for the production of fabrics. Yet glass
fibres are now produced so fine and with
such ductility that many of the fabrics
and draperies in our homes are now of
glass, and we even find neckties on sale
which are advertised as half glass.
Vast changes have been going on in
provisions for shelter. Many of these
changes do not pertain to the basic ma-
terials which have been used for cen-
turies, namely, stone, wood, and brick,
though changes have taken place in
some of these fields, such, for example,
as the development of synthetic woods
or wood substitutes and glass blocks.
Many of the changes may be described
as luxury appointments in the house.
Modern plumbing is one example.
Though the appointments in the bath
houses in the era of the Roman Empire
were most luxurious, it was not until
1846 that consideration first began to
be given to what is now the modern
bathroom. In that year the first bath
tub was installed in the city of Bos-
ton. It is interesting to note that as bath
tubs began to be used to a greater ex-
tent, considerable opposition against
them developed; so much, in fact, that
the city of Boston nearly passed an
ordinance prohibiting their use.
The heating of homes has passed
from the use of fireplaces to stoves, and
finally to central units. Developments
have not stopped there, as investiga-
tions are now under way in the field of
air conditioning and air cooling. Work of
this type and that of many of the de-
velopments previously mentioned may
be construed as resulting from applied
research, although their applications are
based upon fundamental scientific laws,
and some of the developments, espe-
cially in the field of heating, require a
thorough understanding of thermody-
namics.
In spite of the statements made by
early economists that the three funda-
mental requirements for life are food,
clothing, and shelter, it would seem as
if communication has forced itself into
this trinity of requirements, for with-
out it there would be no such thing as
the modern life of today. Communica-
tion has become a part of us and has
had a marked effect upon our habits
and methods of living. The two great
agencies of communication are those
which pertain to transportation and the
transference of thought. In this latter,
we have our postal service, the tele-
graph, the telephone, and the radio,
with the last three based on fundamen-
tal science.
During this period, we have had the
beginning and the development of the
telephone, which was first demonstrated
only 63 years ago and has now grown
to one of America's foremost industries,
expanding from one telephone to over
fifteen million, from two telephone em-
ployees to several hundred thousand,
and from a few messages per year to
over twenty billion communications.
The radio has also brought about pro-
nounced changes in our civilization. It
is a major factor in providing enter-
tainment for millions of persons, as well
as in developing public opinion. It was
just twenty-one years ago that the
writer was shown some vacuum tubes
which had been developed to improve
long-distance telephone communication.
It was expected that 500 of these tubes
would be required annually. Since then
the radio industry has grown to such
proportions that, because these tubes
form an integral part of radio sets, in-
stead of the production of 500 tubes
annually, the world requirements for
these tubes now run into the millions.
In the field of transportation, we
have as contributing factors, railroads,
steamships, automobiles, and airplanes.
Railroads and steamships had the be-
ginning of their development in the
first half of the 19th century. Their
greatest development has been since
1870 and they are still playing a lead-
ing part in our civilization. It is only
within the past ten years that we have
had our streamlined trains, in many of
which the steam locomotive has been
replaced by the Diesel engine.
The automobile, which started out in
a serious way about 40 years ago, has
profoundly changed the aspects of mod-
ern civilization. Although many of us
may view the automobile as a recent
development, the first power-driven unit
was developed by Captain Cugnot in
1769 to drive an artillery carriage. It
used steam as its motive power rather
than gasoline. Beauderochas is credited
with being the first individual who
thought of the cycle used in our present-
10
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


built the first engine. Benz and Demmler
used the Otto engine about 1885. The
first American car is said to have been
produced by Charles Duryea in 1892,
followed closely by Haynes, Ford, and
others.
The growth of the automotive indus-
try has been accompanied by the devel-
opment of good roads and these two
factors have greatly affected methods
of living; so much so that the sale of
house furnishings has been affected and
rail transportation has felt the impact.
Many summer hotels have passed out
of the picture and have been replaced
by overnight cabins and trailer camps.
The concentration of workers around
the plants in which they are employed
has been decreased, as many of them
are now able to go to their work in
their own cars and are enabled thereby
to live several miles from their place
of employment.
The gas and Diesel engines have af-
fected agricultural life, making it possi-
ble for farmers to cultivate hundreds
of acres whereas previously they were

Testing sound with vibrating plate
able to cultivate only one or two hun-
dred acres. These engines have changed
the mode of warfare. There is nothing
new in blitzkrieg warfare. It was the
method used by Jackson in the Civil
War and by Napoleon in his campaigns.
What these engines have done is to in-
crease the tempo with which activities
can be conducted. They have made pos-
sible the rapid transportation of large
units; they have made possible the pro-
visioning of these units at long distances
from their base of supplies. When these
engines are placed in a vehicle covered
with armor plate in which guns are in-
stalled, we have moving fortresses
known as tanks, which are being used
in such large numbers in this present
war.
The airplane has been undergoing a
vast development in the past decade. In
the previous World War, it was used
mainly for scout and reconnaissance. Its
size, speed, and flying altitude have been
developed and increased to such an ex-
tent that it is now not only a vital factor
in transportation, but also in warfare.
These developments have all been the
result of thousands of improvements in
engine and plane design which would
make a book in itself if each one were
described in detail.
Some of the other outstanding devel-
opments are in the fields of plastics and
the colored and moving picture indus-
tries. No one realizes at this moment
how far the plastic industry will go.
There is every reason to believe, how-
ever, that it will develop to an extent
greater than our most optimistic expec-
tations. Its applications in house build-
ing, in house furnishing, and in the re-
placement of wood or steel in automobile
parts has already proceeded to a con-
siderable extent. There has to be in the
development of this, as in all other
products, a vitalizing force; someone
with imagination and persistence and
drive. This is well brought out by the
work of a man who was responsible for
the development of one type of plastic.
He was the president of a company.
He requested his Board of Directors to
support research work in the field of
plastics. He met with an unsympathetic
response from his associates, but he be-
lieved so firmly in his ideas that he
sponsored an investigation running into
nearly $100,000 and was ready to pay
for it out of his own pocket if neces-
sary. As a result of the expenditure
made, a successful plastic was developed
and a plant was equipped to produce it.
The returns from the operation of the
plant within a few years paid for it
and its equipment and likewise resulted
in the payment of substantial dividends
on the investment. The person who told
me this story was the president of the
company, himself, and it was almost
with tears in his eyes that he stated
that he was having difficulty in getting
those who were associated with him out
to the plant to see its operation and
products.
To me, there is a romance in this
story. It is due to the driving force of
individuals such as this president that
America has become industrially great.
The development of the picture indus-
try has only been within the last 50
years and yet what transformations
have taken place during this period, es-
pecially in the moving picture field and
in colored photography! Some of us can
still remember the old nickelodeons of
30 years ago in which the entertainment
was essentially of a slap-stick variety
and the technique of reproduction was
none too good. Today the moving pic-
ture industry provides employment to
thousands, if not millions, and provides
a source of entertainment for almost
the entire civilized world. Many of the
pictures are of a high order from the
standpoint of theme and technique and
there is a rapid change from the black
and white to the technicolored repro-
ductions. Not only has the camera en-
tered into the moving picture industry,
but it has become an integral part of
practically every home and many indi-
viduals now produce not only black and
white reproductions but also colored
stills and colored movies.
There is a story to tell about the
colored movies which is interesting. It
relates the responsibility of a director
of research as to when to say "yes"
and when to say "no" with regard to
the sponsorship of investigations. It was
but a few years ago that two young men
brought to the attention of the Eastman
Kodak Company the possibility of col-
ored photography. They were given sup-
port by this company for a number of
years without any marked progress.
The director of this company was al-
most prepared to stop the investigation,
but after deliberating on the matter
with his associates he felt it advisable
to continue it for another two-year pe-
riod. In that time, such progress was
made that we now have available not
only colored stills but also colored
movies. This director said "What would
have happened had I stopped the work
at the time we thought it might be ad-
visable to do so?" Of course, you can't
stop science and development; this de-
velopment would just have been held
back for a number of years, but in due
time someone would have solved the
problem and made it available to the
world.
Up to this point, the research ac-

OF
MECHANICAL ENGINEERS
By
JOHN A. TEMPLER, '42E
Photos by E. Robinson
I' F there is one engineering society
•*. that has done more for the engineer-
ing profession than any other one organ-
ization, it is undoubtedly the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers.
Through a well-rounded program of pro-
fessional development this influential so-
city has instituted many standards and
codes, the most outstanding of which
is the A.S.M.E. Boiler Code. Not only
has the Society been prominent in ad-
vancing safety construction codes but
it has taken many steps to place the en-
gineering profession on a higher level
than was heretofore known. Realizing
that engineering deserves a more im-
portant position in relation to the many
other professions, the A.S.M.E. has con-
stantly been striving to elevate the engi-
neer to his just and due place in society.
The A.S.M.E. functions as three dis-
tinct divisions. These are the Student,
Junior, and Senior groups. The college
undergraduate is primarily concerned
with the student section of the Society
which is composed of those prospective
Mechanical Engineers enrolled in under-
graduate technical schools. Here at the
University of Michigan the student
branch of the A.S.M.E. holds a prom-
inent place among the engineering so-
cieties and the annual membership regu-
larly exceeds one hundred students. Not
only does the student branch enable the
student engineer to become connected
with his chosen profession but it affords
an activity for students during under-
graduate years.
The student branch endeavors in
three ways to provide the engineering
student with more intimate contacts in
the field of engineering which some-
times seems far distant from the actual
classroom. One of these means is to
offer the student many opportunities to
listen to and talk with prominent men
in engineering—men who are experienced
in their field and are fully competent to
speak on practical matters. Through
these speakers and the many valuable
films presented during the year, the
Student Society is able to provide a con-
necting link between the theory of the
classroom and the practical aspects of
industry.
A second of the three points in the
undergraduate A.S.M.E. program is that
of plant inspection trips. This phase of
the program is perhaps the most prac-
tical of all as it affords the student
many opportunities to observe engi-
neering methods as they are applied to
actual industrial problems. These field
trips are usually of such scope to in-
clude both the small manufacturing es-
tablishment and the larger companies.
A third feature in Student Branch ac-
tivities is the presentation and discus-
sion of papers prepared by members of
the local student branch. Each year
one or two meetings are held for the
purpose of presenting several student
papers. The presentation is then fol-
lowed by a discussion and criticism of
the student's work and out of the group
of papers presented during the school
year, one is selected by society members
and faculty as the one that they think
is deserving of a cash prize. After selec-
tion as the best among local competi-
tion, the student is given the opportu-
nity to present his paper at the annual
student section meeting of the engineer-
ing colleges in the middle west, held
during spring vacation. At this group
meeting the paper is eligible for several
cash prizes and the competing students
are considered representatives of their
respective Student Branches.
The student branches need manage-
ment, as does every functioning organi-
zation. This year the University of
Michigan branch has at its head five
students handling the many tasks and
problems confronting a student group.
The officers for the year 1941-1942 are.
President, John A. Templer; Vice-Presi-
dent, William K. Koffel; Secretary,
George D. Cameron; Treasurer, Leon-
ard P. Shelley and Engineering Council
Representative, Donald R. Whitney, all
members of the class of '42. Supple-
menting and aiding the officers are sev-
eral important committees handling spe-
cific problems such as publicity, mem-
bership, and student papers. These com-
mittees give every interested member a
fine opportunity to take an active part
in society affairs.
The question might be raised as to
what the A.S.M.E. has done and is
planning to do on the campus this year.
As for past accomplishments, the So-

A. M. Selvey, chairman of the Detroit section, J. W. Parker, national

relationship that has done much to
break down the barrier between student
and instructor, caused mainly by the
size of the Engineering College, if noth-
ing else. Members of Engineering Col-
lege faculty are urged to attend the
various functions of the society and to
participate in the discussion periods fol-
lowing the speaker's talk. If the stu-
dent only learns that the professor or
instructor that stands before him in the
classroom has more to offer him than
pedagogical facts and theories, then one
of the major aims of the A.S.M.E. stu-
dent branch is well accomplished.
The student branch of the A.S.M.E.
has presented several programs so far
this year that have not only proven suc-
cessful from the standpoint of the speak-
ers themselves but the subjects discussed
were pertinent to every prospective engi-
neer. Following the opening rally of the
Society at the beginning of the semester,
the A.S.M.E. and the Society of Auto-
motive Engineers student branch held a
joint meeting on October 23. All those
attending this important meeting were
fortunate indeed. Not only was there a
splendid speaker on the program but in
addition to this a new film on the build-
ing of Wright Whirlwind and Cyclone
engines was shown. The speaker, Mr.
Clyde Paton, Chief Engineer of Packard
Motor Car Co., presented a fine talk on
the work Packard is doing for defense.
Following the meeting of the 23rd,
members of the student branch jour-
neyed over to Jackson on the fifth of
November to visit the Macklin Grinding
Wheel Company.
Two weeks later, on November 19,
the student branch of the A.S.M.E. was
fortunate in having as a speaker Mr. O.
Rugg, Chief Chemist of the Ford Motor
Company glass plant. Mr. Rugg pre-
sented a very interesting talk on "Safety
Glass and Modern Developments in the
Glass Industry" and was able to show
actual samples of the many new safety
glass developments, including the bullet-
proof glass used in the Consolidated
bombers to be produced by Ford at Yp-
silanti.
In keeping with the policy set by the
officers of this year's organization, that
of presenting prominent and worthwhile
speakers, the student branch at the Uni-
versity of Michigan, in co-operation
with the Detroit section of the parent
Society, had as their guest speaker at
the November 25 meeting, Mr. A. R.
Smith of the General Electric Company.
This fine program, presented in the
Rackham Amphitheater before a gather-
ing of two hundred and fifty people, not
only from Ann Arbor but from all of
southeastern Michigan, certainly gave
the students attending a fine opportu-
nity to observe how a parent society
meeting is carried on. Mr. Smith, who is
prominent in the field of turbine de-
sign, gave a fine talk on "The Future of
Power Generation." Since this type of
meeting was so successful it may prove
to be a forerunner of many similar
meetings to be held in the future. For
the December 3 meeting the members

ner.
Last year Professor Ben Dushnik of
the Mathematics Department walked off
with the coveted award, to cherish and
to polish. Then last Tuesday night
four men who were on the block to do
or die for the dear old Spoofuncup,
gave their all in battle of wits and
wisecracks. Queried and controlled by

ical Engineering Department acting as

Mr. Donald Hastie of the Carborundum
Company present a film on abrasives
and abrasive manufacture.
Perhaps one of the best known tradi-
tions in the Engineering College is the
Annual A.S.M.E. Student-Faculty
"Roast." The Roast, so called because
of the roasting or ribbing that the fac-
ulty men take on the occasion, is held
every year in the early part of Decem-
ber. Known for its laugh-provoking and
side-splitting fun this outstanding din-
ner meeting casts to the winds any allu-
sions to seriousness and gives the stu-
dents and professors alike a chance to
wisecrack and spin yarns to their heart's
content. The whole point of the Roast
is to discover what faculty member
among a pre-selected group can best
retaliate to the various questions shot
at him during the course of the eve-
ning. As a reward to the "man who can
take it, as well as give it," the Student
Branch presents the "Spoofuncup," a
symbol of quick wit and genuine good
sportsmanship. The winner holds posses-
sion of the trophy, which is essentially
Roastmaster, Professors John Nickelsen
and C. F. Kessler of the M. E. Depart-
ment together with Professors Gilbert
and Van den Broek of the Metal Proc-
essing and Engineering Mechanics De-
partments respectively, took their stand
against a barrage of questions. Out of
these four men there came one to take
his place with the seven previous win-
ners. Professor Kessler was adjudged
the winner of the famous Spoofuncup.
Thus a fine spirit of fellowship continues
among the students and faculty of the
Engineering College, and the A.S.M.E.
has maintained a real tradition on the
campus.
With the Annual Roast for 1941 a
thing of the past, this years student
branch looks forward to an interesting
and varied program for the remainder of
the year. With William Koffel, Vice
President and Chairman of the Program
Committee, hard at work scheduling
speakers and trips, the members can ex-
pect many meetings of real interest to
be presented in the forthcoming months.
Among the future programs is a talk

STOKER COALS
By
RANSOM S. HAWLEY
Professor of Mechanical Engineering
THE rapid development of the do-
mestic stoker during the past few
years and its wide acceptance as a new
firing device for hard fuels created at
once a demand for reliable information
on the characteristics of a satisfactory
stoker coal. In its simplest and most
common form the domestic stoker con-
sists of a coal hopper having a capacity
of 200 to 500 pounds of coal, a motor
driven worm which conveys the coal
from the hopper through a tube and
into the furnace, a blower which forces
air for combustion through the fuel
bed, and thermostatic controls. Built on
the underfeed principle it is designed to
burn soft coals without objectionable
smoke. The blast of air through the fuel
bed is expected to create a temperature
sufficiently high to fuse the ash into
clinker which may be removed with
c inker tongs through the furnace door.
The stoker itself is rather a simple
mechanical device but complications
arose in the attempt to adapt it to all
grades of coal. Many research agencies
have been engaged in making studies of
the behavior of different coals in the do-
mestic stoker, and for the past five years
the Department of Mechanical Engi-
neering has carried out a rather ex-
haustive series of tests in this field.
The equipment used in this investiga-
tion consisted of a conventional hopper-
fed clinkering type stoker installed
under a cast iron boiler, together with
the necessary measuring instruments
and control devices. For most of the
tests an effort was made to follow closely
the usual operating periods in an actual
home installation under both mild and
severe weather conditions. The stoker
used was equipped with a gear box to
give firing rates of 10, 20, and 30 pounds
per hour as desired. This is a standard
arrangement on most domestic stokers
and is done to adapt more readily one
size of stoker to the heating requirements
of different houses. It is not expected,
however, that the owner will make ad-
justments from day to day. Usually a
low rate of feed will be used for mild
weather and a heavier rate for severe
weather, although in some installations
the same rate may be used to advantage
throughout the heating season. The pur-
pose of these tests was to determine, if
possible, what were the controlling fac-
tors in the specifications for a satisfac-
tory domestic stoker coal.
In such an investigation consideration
must be given not only to the behavior
of coal in the stoker and furnace but
also to satisfaction from the consumer's
standpoint. For example, a coal may
burn satisfactorily but its cost may
make it prohibitive. Again a coal may
be low in price and burn satisfactorily
but because of dust or dirt may not be
desirable from the user's point of view.
In these investigations the following
points were considered:
1. Size.
2. Freedom from Foreign Matter.
3. Treatment for Dust.
4. Proximate Analysis.
5. Calorific Value.
6. Ash Fusion Temperature and
Clinkering Properties.
7. Tendency to Smoke.
8. Fly Ash.
9. Cost.
Coal Size
Specifications for the best size of coal
have changed materially since these
tests were begun in 1936. At that time
most domestic stoker coals were
screened to a top size of 1V&amp;" with some
as large as lM&gt;". The amount of the top
size would usually be 15 to 20 per cent
of the total and the remainder was made
up of fairly uniform gradations down to
fines, but with little or no fines in the
consist. Early in our investigation it be-
came evident that a top size of 1" or
even %." gave much more satisfactory
results than the larger sizes.
The consensus of opinion at the pres-
ent time seems to favor a top size of
not over 1", although uniformity of
mixture and size consist is of much
greater importance than the actual top
size if the latter is but a small percent-
age of the total. Coal containing 15 to
20 per cent fines can be burned very
satisfactorily provided it is carefully
mixed with larger sizes, but the idea of
buying slack coal is frowned on by
many householders.
Since the sizing of coal is governed
by mechanical screen—at the mine, it
is not, of course, a characteristic of any
region or vein. It should be mentioned,
however, that a correct top size and uni-
form mixture at the mine is no guar-
antee of the uniformity in the consum-
er's coal bin. Segregation will occur at
the yard or in delivery unless precau-
tions are taken, and many complaints
have arisen because of this separation
of fines from coarse in the consumer's
bin.
Freedom from Foreign Matter
Picking and washing of coal at the
mine will generally insure against pieces
of slate, tramp iron, wood or wire that
might interfere with the operation of the
stoker worm. The consumer should take
precautions, however, to see that his
coal bin is clean and that refuse is not
thrown into the bin or the stoker hop-
per. In more than 30 lots of well-known
stoker coals received at our laboratory
only one contained any objectionable
foreign matter.
Treatment for Dust
All except one lot of coal tested in
our laboratory had been previously
treated with oil or calcium chloride for
dust proofing. While the treatment does
not change the burning characteristics
nor add to its heating value, neverthe-
less it is very essential from the con-
sumer's standpoint. It should be men-
tioned that anthracite and pocahontas
coals are practically dustless and require
no treatment. Dust proofing of bitumi-
nous coals should be sufficient to render
them practically dustless when handled
after a period of at least 3 or 4 months.
14
THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Coals are frequently ranked accord-
ing to the ratio of fixed carbon to
volatile combustible matter and are
commonly classed as anthracite, semi-
anthracite, bituminous, sub-bituminous,
and lignite. In this ranking the anthra-
cite coal is highest and the lignite is
lowest. However, the heating value of
coals does not necessarily follow this
classification. High grade bituminous
coals often have a higher heating value
than the anthracite. The percentages of
ash and moisture necessarily influence
to a large extent the net heating value
of coal as received. The higher these
percentages the lower will be the avail-
able heat per pound of coal. Low mois-
ture and low ash content are therefore
desirable.
Moisture in coal to the consumer may
be present as inherent moisture or as
surface moisture. The inherent moisture
is present in the coal seam and can-
not be reduced except by artificial dry-
ing. Surface moisture is the result of
washing, exposure to rain or snow dur-
requires more frequent attention on the
part of the operator. Unless it fuses
readily and forms clinker there will be
a larger amount of fly ash in the. chim-
ney gas, and this is unsatisfactory from
the user's standpoint.
Fusion Temperature oj Ash
Ash fusion temperatures of coals from
different fields vary from 1950° to over
3000 Fahr. Low ash fusion tempera-
ture is characteristic of a satisfactory
domestic coal for the clinkering type
stoker in which it is expected that the
ash will fuse into clinker and be re-
moved by clinker tongs. This is quite
different from the requirements of large
industrial stokers where a high ash fu-
sion temperature is essential for best
results.
If the stoker is in continuous oper-
ation only two to four hours in a 24
hour period, it is apparent that sufficient
temperature will not usually be created
to form clinker. In this respect, the
coals that have a low ash fusion temper-
ature will form clinker more readily
than those with a high ash fusion tern-

Equipment used in testing domestic coals
ing transportation or to standing in ex-
posed piles in retail coal yards. Mois-
ture has little effect on the burning
characteristics except to reduce the net
available heat.
A satisfactory domestic stoker coal
should have a relatively low total ash
content. An upper limit of 6 per cent
is usually specified and some of the high
grade coals have an ash content of less
than 4 per cent. High ash content pro-
duces more clinker to be removed and
perature and would therefore appear to
be more desirable. Coals which have an
ash fusion temperature above 2500
form almost no clinker in intermittent
operation and in our tests to date, we
have had difficulty in securing a clinker
even in continuous operation except by
constantly raking the fire back over the
retort. It would appear that a fusion
temperature of about 2450 Fahr. is the
upper limit for domestic stoker coals
when used in the clinkering type stoker.
Tendency to Smoke in Stoker Hopper
Coals containing a high ratio of vola-
tile matter to fixed carbon will in g3n-
eral have a greater tendency to smcke
back than do the low volatile coals. Our
tests indicate, however, that this is more
a function of coal size, draft and dis-
turbance of the fire bed during oper-
ation than to the actual percentage of
volatile matter. Reducing the top sizs
and keeping a uniform mixture in ths
stoker is good insurance against hopper
smoke.
Fly Ash
Fly ash consists of very finely divided
particles of ash that are carried along
with the combustion gases and lodge on
the heating surfaces of the boiler or
furnace or pass out the chimney. Up to
the present time no effective method has
been devised to eliminate this objection-
able condition. Most heating equipment
is built with horizontal gas passages and
these are natural settling chambers for
fly ash. Best results are obtained by
careful control of the stoker fan and the
draft dampers so as to prevent too
heavy a blast of air through the fuel
bed. A new design of furnace to elimin-
ate most of the horizontal surfaces will
likely be most effective in eliminating
fly ash.
Cost
The cost of retail coal to the con-
sumer is made up of cost at the mine,
freight to destination, delivery charges,
tax, and retailer's profit. This, of course,
applies to any grade of coal. Stoker
coal carries a lower mine cost than the
larger sizes such as egg or nut and the
retail price is, therefore, correspondingly
lower. As compared with the hand fired
furnace using from 8 to 15 tons of coal
per year, there is no appreciable reduc-
tion in tonnage in the average case if
a stoker is installed. The gain lies in
the lower cost per ton and in the added
comfort and convenience of the stoker
fired job. In large buildings the deduc-
tion in tonnage with stoker firing be-
comes noticeable.
Conclusions
From the results of our studies the
following conclusions can be drawn:
First—There is no great variation in
the overall efficiencies with different
coals under similar operating conditions
of the furnace and stoker.
Second—All coals having an ash fu-
sion temperature of 2450 Fahr. or be-
low clinkered satisfactorily under heavy
firing.
Third—Under light loads such as

COUNCIL
By
ROBERT L. SUMMERHAYS, '42E
'I 'HE Engineering Council dates back
.*- to the days of its predecessor, the En-
gineering Society, which was formed in
1881. The old Engineering Society was
open to all students of the Engineering
Department. Meetings were held
monthly to present research papers,
hold discussions on topics of interest,
and listen to "imported" speakers.
The Engineering Society functioned
actively on the campus until the early
1920's when interest began to decline.
Much of the credit for the existence of
the Engineering Council today must go
to Perry Shoemaker, '28E, who played
a major role in the organization of the
Engineering Council from the "ashes"
of the Engineering Society in the spring
Senior Class, and the Editor of the
Technic.
One of the purposes of this early edi-
tion of the Engineering Council was to
provide for such activities as "All-En-
gineering Smokers, All-Engineering Con-
vocations, the Engineering Open House,
and other things that demand a well
organized executive committee in charge
of them." In 1939 the Council setup was
changed so that some class representa-
tives received longer terms than others.
This provided for a greater stability in
the personnel of the Council and at the
same time permitted the infusion of
"new blood" in the Council for short
terms. At the same time the Council
took charge of the Honor Council and

of 1928. The membership of this first
Council consisted of representatives of
the senior and junior clases, A.S.C.E.,
A.S.M.E., A.I.E.E., A.I.Ch.E., Trans-
portation Club, the President of the
members of the Council were appointed
to serve on the Honor Council.
In the fall of 1939 the Engineering
Council made still another advancement
when, under the guidance of Bob Mor-
rison, '41E, the first Arch (freshman en-
gineering handbook) was published.
Today, the Engineering Council con-
sists of representatives of all the pro-
fessional and honor societies, all the
classes, the President of the Senior Class,
and the Editor of the Technic.
With its growth in personnel, the En-
gineering Council has also undertaken
more activities. Not the least of these
is the coordination of various student
activities in the College of Engineering.
Along this line, the Council has set up
a committee to avoid conflicts in the
meeting dates of the various societies.
In addition to the Honor Council
mentioned before, the Engineering Coun-
cil takes charge of the biennial Engi-
neering Open House. This event is
usually held in the spring and consists
of a general "throwing open" of the
doors of the College of Engineering with
exhibits by the various departments and
industrial companies.
The Council also holds Engineering
Smokers during the year at which time
the students and the "profs" get to-
gether on a more equal footing. An-
other such occasion is the Engineering
Banquet held each spring.
Just to give the engineer a well-
rounded college life, the Council spon-
sors the Engineering Ball each year. A
comparatively recent institution, the
Ball is enjoying increasing popularity.
However, probably the biggest single
enterprise undertaken by the Council is
the Arch. The Arch is the freshman's
"bible" of the College of Engineering.
It contains a picture of each freshman
as well as articles on the College of En-
gineering, the professional and honor so-
cieties, engineering activities, and the
Honor System.
Thus the Engineering Council has de-
veloped over a period of years into a
organization actively engaged in the fur-
thering of the interests of the College of
Engineering and its students.

students and strangers alike, the naval
tank is visited almost daily by inquisi-
tive people who would like to know
more about the actual use of a model-
testing tank. The tank itself is a basin
of water 300 feet long, 22 feet wide, and
10 feet deep. Incidentally, because of
its half-million gallon capacity, the
water has not been changed since 1923.
The tank has a false bottom making
it possible to change the depth from zero
to ten feet. By this means, actual work-
ing conditions are simulated in the tank
for specific cases.
Straddling the tank is the car to
which the model is attached during a
run and on which the control table is
mounted. The model is towed through
the water by the movement of this car
over the length of
the tank. The scale-
beam, a first-class
lever with the model
attached to one end
and a scribing pen
for charting water
resistance to the
other, is the means
by which data is
compiled from the
boat's action. A new
periscope system is
being developed at
present for deter-
mining the planing
angle of the boat in
the water at vari-
ous velocities. Spe-
cifically the naval
tank is used for test-
ing scale models of
actual designed hulls.
This amounts to
building a model
to the specifications
of some shipbuild-
ing concern and run-
ning a test in the
tank. The work of
interpreting results
and adding sugges-
tions for improve-
ment is allotted to
the Marine Engineering Department.
Secondly, the large water volume of the
tank makes it possible to use as a reser-
voir for the University firefighting de-
partment.
Some of the completed projects of the
tank include: fresh-water, river-barge
design, racing hydroplane hulls, fire
boat hulls, and a large amount of work

for the United States Navy. Many re-
sults have been published in Naval and
Marine Journals of the work accom-
plished here giving the tank a world-
wide reputation. The Michigan naval
tank is no longer the largest testing
tank even in the United States but its

reputation and efficient operation con-
tinues with "business as usual", and this
is due, as with all inanimate objects, to
the work of an individual.
The Naval tank is not without its
personal element. Synonomous with the
words, naval tank, one unconsciously
associates the name, Arthur Limpert, al-
though many do not actually know his
name. He is the gentleman who con-
structs all the models which are tested.
Born in Kalkaska County, Michigan,
near the shore of Lake Michigan, he be-
came interested in boats at an early age,
especially when he saw a sidewheeler at
the Straits of Mackinac. At the age of
fourteen he built his first real boat, a
rowboat, though his grandfather claimed
it was a waste of good wood. Soon after
he began to serve his time as an ap-
prentice to a boat builder in Petosky.
Many important positions came to
Arthur Limpert as time went on, includ-
ing foremanships in the Fay and Bowen
Engine and Boat Works, and the Amer-
ican Blower Company. He had the fore-
manship in charge of construction of the
University heating tunnels while work-
ing for the Buildings and Grounds Com-
mission.
While working for Fay &amp; Bowen,
Mr. Limpert personally built an all-
teak boat for Victor Herbert and an-
other for Hudson Maxim. Also while
there he was helping design flying boat
hulls for the coast guard service. A
Curtiss inspector who was boarding with
Mr. Limpert and working on this same
job, was riding one of the test planes
over the Potomac river when it crashed
sending him into six feet of mud at
the bottom.
Since his initiation as model maker
he has completed numerous jobs, each
as they were assigned to him. Professors
Baier and Bragg are his chief coordi-
nators in this. Mr. Limpert claims that
his work here at the tank has been hum-
drum except for the occasions when he
gets mad at his coordinators. At times
like these he gets behind a post and tells
the boys what he thinks of them. Im-
measurably modest as far as talking
about himself, Arthur Limpert is one of
those men for whom you hold much
respect, not only because of his ability
but also his experience. Without him,
those familiar with the naval tank
would assure you that an important link
in the naval tank chain was missing.

IN
GUN BARRELS
By
JOHN S. BURNHAM, '42E
Illustrations courtesy American Broach &amp; Machine Company
O TRANGE as it seems, rifling was in-
*^ vented before guns were invented.
Ever since man has been killing his
brother with missiles it has been evident
to him that spin steadies the flight and
increases the accuracy of the missile. For
centuries feathers have been set on ar-
row shafts at an angle to make them
spin. When the gun was invented it
was natural to transfer from the arrow
to the bullet the idea of spinning for
accuracy.
when it emerges from the muzzle. Since
the latter is obviously mechanically im-
possible only the helical groove or rifling
is left.
However, much was to be desired. In
order to be effective, the rifling should
grip the ball firmly. To ensure this, the
ball must be forced into the grooves of
the rifling. In the early days this was
done by making the bullet slightly larg-
er than the bore and driving it down the
barrel with a rod and mallet. (All guns

Figure 1. Machine for rifling the Bofors anti-aircraft barrel
There are two methods to make a
bullet spin in flight—one is to spin the
bullet in the barrel by means of helical
grooves and the other is to rotate the
barrel with the bullet in it at a sufficient
speed that the bullet will be spinning
were then muzzle-loaders, for no suitable
method had been devised to prevent the
escape of gases past the breechblock.)
This method was at fault because it was
too slow to be used on the battlefield
and it defeated the purpose of the rifling
for the ball was so misshapen by the
time it had been beaten into place that
it wabbled all over the field of fire.
Rifling also fell into disrepute, for the
range of a rifled piece was much less
than that of a smoothbore, since the
rifling offers considerable friction be-
tween the ball and the barrel, and the
black powder then in use was not very
powerful. Consequently the smoothbore
was the more popular of the two well
into the middle of the nineteenth cen-
tury. Then came two inventions which
changed the picture entirely—the brass
cartridge case and smokeless powder.
The brass cartridge case made breech-
loading practicable and thus did away
with the mauling of the ball. Smokeless
powder was so much stronger than black
powder that the difference in ranges be-
tween rifled and unrifled guns was not
noticeable. As a result, rifling came to
be used in all guns.
At present, rifling falls into two classi-
fications—uniform twist and increasing
or accelerated twist. In the uniform
twist rifling the helix angle is constant.
In the increasing twist rifling the helix
angle at the breech has a small value
(usually zero) and increases according
to the semi-cubic parabola x- 3=2py as
it progresses toward the muzzle. Accel-
erated rifling is supposed to be superior
to constant twist rifling because the ini-
tial friction is low on account of the
small helix angle. However, this advan-
tage is offset by the fact that as the
helix angle increases, the groove pressed
in the rotating band is obliged to change

Data from actual firing tests show that
the two types of rifling give exactly the
same range, all other conditions being
constant.
finishes it, the last few teeth on the end
of No. 4 cutting the groove to its proper
depth.
The broaches can be sharpened like
ordinary ones without any special equip-

Figure 2. Sections of 20 and 105 mm. barrels
Rifling grooves are cut by pushing
and turning, to get the proper helix
angle, a two or four toothed cutter
through the bore until the grooves are
the proper depth, then indexing the cut-
er and repeating the process. This pro-
cess takes considerable time, for guns
like the 105 mm and the 155 mm have
36 and 48 grooves respectively.
However, early this year the Amer-
ican Broach &amp; Machine Company
brought out a machine which is revolu-
tionizing the rifling of gun barrels. It
is a broaching machine which can be
adapted to rifle any barrel from 20 to
105 mm, either constant or accelerated
twist.
The big advantage of the broaching
machine over the old fashioned rifling
machine is the increase in speed of pro-
duction due to the fact that the broach
cuts all the grooves at the same time in-
stead of only two or four. For example,
by using these new broaching machines
the time for rifling the 105 mm howit-
zer has been decreased from 9XA hours
to 50 minutes and the rate of rifling the
new 20 mm cannon is now 10 minutes
instead of 2*4 hours.
The 20 mm constant twist barrel is
rifled with a set of four solid, spiral
broaches. The first broach cuts one
quarter of the width of the groove and
also the full diameter, less a few tenths
of a thousandth. The second broach in-
creases the width of the groove to one
half the width of the finished groove,
taking equal amounts off each side of
the groove cut by the first broach. The
third broach cuts the groove to three
quarter width and the fourth broach
ment. The broaches have three oil chan-
nels their full length and oil is forced
through them at a high pressure at all
times when they are cutting. The
broaches are carried on the machine in
a rack which travels with the pull head
so as to always be handy to the operator.
This machine is shown in Figure 3. The
fifth broach which is seen in the rack is
used only when it is discovered that
broach No. 4 needs sharpening.
The machine for rifling the 40 mm in-
creasing twist Bofors barrel, which has
become so popular for anti - aircraft
work, is shown in Figure 1. Since it is
obvious that a barrel with increasing
twist rifling cannot be rifled with a one
piece broach, this machine is equipped
with a set of thirty cutters (which can
be seen on the rack above the machine
in the illustration) that are pushed
through the barrel in their proper se-
quence. The broaches cut 16 grooves
.020" deep and 90" long at the rate of
one barrel per hour.
The 105 mm howitzer barrel is also
rifled with a set of individual cutters
even though it has constant twist rifling.
The small cutters are used because a
one piece broach to do this work would
be as large as a railroad car axle and
consequently too awkward to handle.
The broaches cut 36 grooves 93" long
and .030" deep at a speed of 15 feet per
minute. The production rate, as men-
tioned before, is one barrel per 50
minutes.
Now that we have been forced into
war with Japan, the advantages of rapid
rifling are obvious. But these broaching
machines have the added advantage of
being designed so that when (if?) the
war ends they can be used as normal
broaching machines, for commercial
broaching of all shapes of holes and
splines.

Because of the work of the Ordnance
Department of the United States Army
and of the Watertown Arsenal, the
United States now leads the world in
the science of gun-making. This leader-
ship has been attained because of three
revolutionary developments pioneered at
the Watertown Arsenal. These develop-
ments are: (1) the casting of cannon
by the centrifugal process—superseding
forging; (2) cold working by the auto-
frettage method; and (3) the creation
of stronger and tougher gun steels. To-
gether, these three factors constitute the
greatest advancement in gunmaking
since the invention of rifling and the
breech-lock.
The making of guns has been greatly
speeded by the use of centrifugal cast-
ing, for a single casting machine can
turn out several gun barrels in the time
it takes to forge one. In addition to
this advantage, the process also reduces
subsequent machining.
All guns from 1.1 inch to 5.5 inch are
now centrifugally cast at the Watertown
Arsenal, and plans are now being made
for the casting of larger ones.
The molding machines used in this
process are long horizontal tubes, weigh-
ing from five to ten tons, which can be
rotated at a high rate of speed by a
motor. In these machines are put molds
weighing from three to five tons each;
then the charge is poured in. During the
casting process, the centrifugal force of
rotation forces the slag and inclusions
in the metal to the center of the mold.
Only a small center hole is left in the
mold, and consequently all of the dirty
steel is eliminated when the gun is
bored.
The new method of cold working im-
proves the physical characteristics so
much that the former process of using
built-up sections of separately forged
jackets and hoops shrunk onto the tubes
has become obsolete for small guns. In-
stead, a single tube is used. This is
known as the monobloc type of gun, and
is the standard type of anti-aircraft gun
used today.
industrial x-ray
Million volt X-ray machines today
are being used not only in hospitals for
medical treatment but also in industry.
The giant machines are used to inspect
heavy castings, thick welds and other
bulky pieces of equipment.
The apparatus being used consists of
the X-ray equipment and enclosed in a
tank three feet in diameter and four
feet long. It weighs 1500 pounds alto-
gether. No pump is required to keep the
interior of the tank at the specified va-
cuum. Freon gas is used for insulation
in the tank. 100 pounds of it has an in-
sulation value equal to 12,000 pounds
of oil.
The special building which contains
the X-ray equipment has protective
walls of 12 inches of brick and 14 inches
of concrete. This is to provide safety
from stray radiations. Castings up to 40
tons can be handled in the inspecting
room.
A large saving of time and labor has
been obtained by using the million-volt
X-ray rather than the earlier 200 and
400 kilovolt. As an example, the million
volt equipment will X-ray six castings
at one time, while for the same sizes the
400 kilovolt machine requires six ex-
posures per casting.
This new process also has great flexi-
bility in control of the amount of in-
tensity of radiation. Objects can be
X-rayed at a distance of 24 feet with
full power or at a three inch distance
with %oooo of the power of the equip-
ment.
color blindness
There has been circulating within the
last year an untrue rumor that color
blind men will be in great demand as
aerial observers because of their pre-
scribed ability to discover camouflaged
objects. However, it has been proven
that a person with normal vision,
equipped artificially with some sort of
color filter, the color of which is depend-
ent upon the nature of the object to be
observed, is much more efficient at fer-
reting out normally obscured details in
the landscape. Camouflage revealing
cameras, equipped with similar color fil-
ters can produce the same result for
permanent record. The camoufleur, who
up to this time has depended upon the
color of his work to blend with the sur-
roundings in normal light, must now
employ means to blend colors to secrete
his objective under infra-red and color
filtered light as well.
no tail
For the past twenty years inventors
and designers have been interested in
the subject of the flying wing. The basic
concept of a flying wing is that all the
functions of an airplane are combined in
one large airfoil. Up to the present time
no one had built a true flying wing, but
Northrop Aircraft now has designed and
constructed the first successful one.
Other types of tailless craft have flown
in the past, but all have embodied some
auxiliary control surfaces which were
not part of the wing itself. Adequate
controllability and stability about all
three axes have been obtained in the
Northrop airfoil through the shape of
the wing rather than through the use
of external fins, rudders, or stabilizers.
The engineering of the present flying
wing was begun in July, 1939 and less
than a year later, it was first flight
tested by Vance Breese at the Muroc
Lake Army Base in Southern California.
Now, after eighteen months of test fly-
ing by several pilots, the Northrop Fly-
ing Wing has been pronounced "success-
fur' by its designer and builder.
The flying wing consists of a single
airfoil which houses the pilot's compart-
ment, engines, and controls. Only the
small propeller drive shaft housings ex-
tending above and to the rear of the
wing do not contribute directly to the
lift of the airfoil. The flying wing has a
span of about 38 feet and is powered
by two 120 horse-power aircooled en-

gines. The engines are buried in the
wing on either side of the pilot's cock-
pit, driving pusher propellers through
extension shafts about ten feet long.
The first experimental craft was de-
signed as a one-half to one-third scale
model of a twin-engined transport plane
input. They should be of the type which
permit control by the furnace operator
and also preserve a record of both fuel
performance and fuel consumption.
Draft control is necessary in the
modern open-hearth. It can maintain
balanced pressure conditions within the
furnace and reduce waste gas volumes

and uses twin motors in order to deter-
mine its behaviour with one engine
idling and the other operating at full
output.
No details of the performance of the
flying wing have been released, but it
is believed that by its use substantial
increases in range and economy of pro-
duction and operation may be readily
obtained in the future.
draft control
The defense program, requiring the
speeding up of production processes for
all vital defense materials has drawn at-
tention to more accurate control of the
open-hearth furnace as a means of maxi-
mum production with no loss in quality.
Flow meters could be used to accur-
ately measure the liquid and gas fuel
which shorten the life of the furnace
brickwork. Automatic equipment should
be utilized for this problem since it is
most effective.
Forced air fans will also be found
most advantageous. In the melting-down
stage the temperature is at its lowest in
the furnace system and therefore the
amount of fuel burned is limited by the
reduced amount of air in the furnace.
As the furnace ages, the resistance in
the flues becomes greater and the
amount of air is further reduced. By
use of forced air fans, the air and con-
sequently the fuel burned in the furnace,
is independent of the temperature and
resistance to ingress.
The measurement and recording of
temperatures in the furnace system is
also essential to the correct operation of
the open-hearth. Furnaces equipped in
the above manner will make for a
greater production rate with decrease in
fuel consumption.
substitute
The auto industry, not only faced
with a fifty per cent reduction in yearly
output, but also a depletion of certain
metals formerly used on models, has not
been idle in planning substitutions for
materials which eventually may not be
available. The auto development engi-
neers have been doing research in plastic
materials for six years, not realizing
when they started the significance their
work would have at a later date. At
present they are prepared to make dras-
tic substitutions in new automobile con-
struction should their waning supply of
essential metals be cut off.
1942 models of one car now have sev-
enty plastic parts compared to thirty-
nine for 1941. This change was most
evident in interior finishings and certain
functioning parts where plastic materials
were adaptable. Radio grills, door ha-
dles, steering wheels, dash trim, control
knobs, external light reflectors, radiator
ornaments, and manufacturer's emblems,
are a few specific examples of parts
which are completely redesigned for to-
tal or partial use of acrylic resins, the
principal group used at present. One
manufacturer completely redesigned the
distributor head in order that plastic
could be used and as a result saved a
half-pound of phenolic molding com-
pound plus 0.4 pound of cast aluminum.
This replacement was not effected
without design or adaptation problems,
however. The use of bright colors, pos-
sible with these resins, was not applic-
able to interior panel decoration. In-
stead soft neutral colors were used to
blend with new, brighter colored uphol-
stery. At other places, the variegated
color combinations had to be blended
and contrasted suitably to give pleasing
effects. Raymond Loewy, foremost in-
dustrial designer, supports the import-
ance of satisfying design in stating that,
"A survey of the 1942 line of automo-
biles proves that styling is still the most
saleable single feature of automobile de-
sign."
At present, costs are running about
15^ higher than for the old die-castings
which are being replaced, but new de-
velopments should even this up. Al-
together, these new models mark the be-
ginning of an interesting year for plastic
development application. The major
changes, if they come, will depend on
the availability of present material.

How a Westinghouse Distribution System
Foils Lightning, Accidents, and Saboteurs
Behind America's urgent defense pro-
duction, stands electric power. It
runs the machines that turn out the
weapons for the defense of America. It
must not fail, must not even falter.
In the first World War, this vital
power could be cut off, and cut off
easily ... by saboteurs, by accidents, or
by lightning.

► For, in those days, the only means
of distributing electricity was through
radial systems, in which the power lines
radiated like the spokes of a wheel with
the power station as the hub. So, if any
part of a power line were damaged, no
electricity could be delivered to users
all along the line.
No way was known to reduce the vul-
nerability of power distribution until the
early '20's, when engineers of a large
power company conceived the idea of
the secondary network system.
► The idea was to connect low voltage
secondary lines in a network, with the
main power (primary) lines joined to the
network at several places. Thus, with
power being sent along several different
routes, a line could be damaged and
electricity would continue to flow to its
users along the other routes.
It was a great idea ... if it could be
made to work on large and complicated
city systems. That was the problem,
a problem which the power company
brought to Westinghouse engineers.

► The secondary network system
wouldn't work at all until some pump-
proof method was found to keep power
from flowing backwards into a damaged
section of the line. Westinghouse engi-
neer John S. Parsons (a member of
Georgia Tech's class of '21, a graduate
of the Westinghouse Training Course,
and the holder of 30 of the 150 patents
on secondary networks) found the way
... a pump-proof relay which, when
power is flowing in the wrong direction,
closes its contacts and causes a network
protector (automatic air circuit breaker)
to trip and cut the feeder off the line.
Then, there was the question of where
to put the transformers, relays, and pro-
tectors that secondary networks needed.
The amount of space this equipment
would take up would be tremendously
expensive in crowded cities.
v&amp;
es'.
/
&amp;*

► The obvious way to overcome this
obstacle was to put this secondary net-
work equipment underground. But trans-
formers, relays, and protectors wouldn't
perform properly in damp underground
atmosphere. Westinghouse engineers
went to work and developed a trans-
former-relay-protector unit that could
fight off dampness and perform as well
underground as above ground! Now,
there are network units that do their
job even though submerged under salt
water, twice a day!
To make doubly sure that they had the
space problem licked, Westinghouse en-
gineers cut down the size and stepped
up the power capacity of these network
units. They made it possible for a unit
that was one-third smaller to do the
same electrical jobs!
► Secondary networks raised all sorts of
new problems. And Westinghouse engi-
neers had to find a lot of new answers
before they were able to bring secondary
networks from an idea to a working
distribution system.

Today, Westinghouse engineers have
brought secondary network systems to
164 cities. They've adapted these sys-
tems to the specialized needs of defense
plants, army camps, airports, and power
houses. Their work has contributed tre-
mendously to today's ability to distrib-
ute unfailing electric power . . . despite
lightning, accidents, and sabotage.
• * *
► This story illustrates how Westing-
house engineers work. More than that,
it shows how the Westinghouse Company
works. For there are 1,500 engineers in
Westinghouse ... in service, in manage-
ment; in design, in sales, in every single
branch of the business. These engineers
give the company its point of view.
Westinghouse takes pride in the engi-
neering behind its products. Its engineers
are always analyzing its products, work-
ing over them, making them better. It
has the engineer's impatience with the
old and his eagerness to create the new.
► Engineers founded and built Westing-
house. Engineers will carry it on.

tivities to which reference has been
made have been those in which the Uni-
versity of Michigan has had little part,
or at least no direct part. It might be
interesting, therefore, for us to note a
few of the things which have been done
in the field of industrial research dur-
ing the past 20 years which we view as
valuable contributions. In this connec-
tion no reference will be made to the
many important phases of work which
have been carried on in the medical
and dental fields, nor to the vast amount
of important ground work in fundamen-
tals which has been carried forward
through all of the science activities in
the University. Reference will be made
to but a few of the 1500 odd investiga-
tions which have been conducted by
means of sponsored research.
The first of such investigations re-
lated to the development of an improved
type of single-phase motor, which work
was done under the direction of Pro-
fessor B. F. Bailey, of the Department
of Electrical Engineering. The single-
phase motor, as its name indicates, is
operated from a single-phase circuit,
which is the type of circuit used in our
homes. The three-phase circuit is the
type commonly used in our factories.
With the great development which has
taken place in the use of electricity in
our homes, numerous motors are found
in the various appliances, so that in the
average home two or three such motors
are used; such, for example, as in sew-
ing machines, vacuum sweepers, wash-
ing machines, fans, and other units. The
single-phase motor which was developed
by Professor Bailey is now almost uni-
versally accepted, so that there are mil-
lions of such motors now in use.
There is a story in this connection.
At the time the matter was referred to
the University by Mr. Dow, President
of The Detroit Edison Company, Pro-
fessor Bailey was approached to under-
take the investigation. He was very
modest regarding his ability to make
certain of the improvements in the
motor which were desired. Mr. Dow's
reply was, in my judgment, a classic.
He said "I would like to see this investi-
gation undertaken and, if you can prove
to me that no improvement can be
made, I will be satisfied." That is the
spirit which should be back of every
investigation; a willingness to sponsor
and satisfaction with the outcome, if
work is well done, whatever it may be.
(Continued from page 11)
We have also done a great deal of
work in the field of acoustics. Practi-
cally every one of the roller bearings
used in the United States is now in-
spected through sound-measuring instru-
ments developed at the University of
Michigan. This work has been extended
into many other fields in which the re-
duction of noise is a factor; as in drive
chains, washing machines, vacuum
cleaners, and in complete automobile
units. In this latter connection, exten-
sive work has been done for three of
the large automobile companies in the
country. Though the work was started
by Professor D. L. Rich, it has, in the

main, been carried forward by Professor
F. A. Firestone and Dr. P. H. Geiger.
Work has been done relating to the
determination of stresses in aerial line
structures for the utility interests. This
is a problem affecting all of us who use
electricity, for the investigation, under
the direction of Professor Sherlock of
the Civil Engineering Department, and
Professor M. B. Stout of the Electrical
Engineering Department, was under-
taken for the purpose of so designing
aerial line structures that, no matter
what the wind or storm conditions were,
the public would be assured of continu-
ity of service. Think, therefore, of the
work which has been done at the Uni-
versity in this field when there are high
winds or heavy incrustations of ice form-
ing on the wires and you still have con-
tinuity of service in your homes.
A continued investigation, sponsored
by various interests, has been going on
at the University in the field of soil
stabilization. Possibly one of the great-
est unknown factors in the construction
of buildings relates to the bearing power
of soils. The investigations which have
been carried on under the direction of
Professor W. S. Housel, of the Depart-
ment of Civil Engineering, throw much
light on this subject. In the construction
of a large hotel in Detroit, over $200,-
000 was spent for its foundations over
and above that which many people
thought necessary, only because at that
time there was uncertainty as to the
bearing power of the soils on which
these foundations were built. This work
is also proving of great value in the
construction of runways which are being
built in such increasing numbers for our
airplanes.
An extensive investigation has also
been carried out in the matter of preser-
vation of foods, under the direction of
Professor D. W. McCready of the De-
partment of Chemical and Metallurgi-
cal Engineering. To many, the preserva-
tion of foods is a matter of degree of
cold. Dean Thomson of the University
of Liverpool felt that the control of at-
mosphere was a major factor in the pres-
ervation of fruits and vegetables. His
work was extended through investiga-
tions carried on at the University of
Michigan with the result that oranges,
which have dried or rotted within a rela-
tively short time, have been kept in per-
fect condition at 70°F. for a period of
three months, merely through controlled
atmosphere. Although this work has not,
to date, found any great application be-
cause of a number of factors, it is one
which has great potentialities.
Investigations dealing with the de-
velopment and properties of metals for
high temperature service, especially for
power plants and oil refineries, have
been in progress for over 20 years. This
work has been under the direction of
the writer and Dr. C. L. Clark. Investi-
gations in this field touch every one of
us, for we all use electricity and most
of us use gasoline. Through the ability
to use steam at higher operating tem-
peratures, pronounced economies result
with lower prices for electricity. The oil
refineries depend on high temperatures
for the various cracking processes and
therefore have great need for metals
which will withstand these high temper-
atures. An attempt has been made to
find suitable alloy compositions of lower

alloy content which will show improved
life over ordinary steel at the tempera-
tures in question. A number of alloys
have been developed at the University
which have shown this improved life
and these alloys are being used today
quite extensively in these fields.
A major investigation has been in the
field of quantitative spectrographic
analysis. This work started about 14
years ago, though at that time with no
then interested in developing a quanti-
tative spectrographic method for the de-
termination of this metal.
Similar work was done with respect to
another metal. The possibilities for work
in this field were then brought to the
attention of a large foundry which spon-
sored work in this field with the result
that they today control their melting
practice by means of quantitative spec-
trographic analysis. The work has been
continued so that today a number of

Spectrograph used for metal analysis
thought of developing work in this field.
The problem presented was to determine
the reason why nickel electrodes used
in spark plugs functioned in some in-
stances and failed to give satisfactory
life performance in others. Chemical and
metallographic examinations failed to
disclose the reasons. The spectroscope
was turned to. It found a metal present,
in those spark plugs which functioned
satisfactorily, though in minute quanti-
ties. The company was asked if they
had added any metal to the nickel and
they said "No." When they were in-
formed that such a metal was found
in the spark plugs which functioned sat-
isfactorily, they were surprised, but
after thought they realized that they
used a flux during the melting of the
nickel which carried this metal. It be-
came evident that under certain condi-
tions of melting practice small quanti-
ties of this metal were introduced into
the metal, whereas in other conditions it
failed to combine. The company was
foundries and steel mills are using this
method. One automobile company oper-
ating its own foundry holds its heats in
the furnace until they have the results
from the laboratory as to the composi-
tion of the metal. These results are ob-
tained in less than 15 minutes, whereas
by normal methods of chemical control
a complete chemical analysis is not pos-
sible for several hours' time.
Several other steel companies have
under consideration the use of this
method. It has also been applied in
many other fields, essentially those pro-
ducing inorganic chemicals. This phase
of the work has been a boon to the
rayon industry, for by its means the
control of chemicals vital to the proper
quality of rayon is easily and quickly
possible. These programs have been car-
ried forward by Professors Sawyer and
Duffendack of the Physics Department,
and by Doctors R. A. Wolfe and H. B.
Vincent, Research Physicists.
Another important investigation has
dealt with the proper design of seat
cushions, especially as applied to auto-
mobiles. This work has been under the
direction of Professor W. E. Lay, of the
Department of Mechanical Engineer-
ing The work was sponsored by one of
the large suppliers of automobile parts
and has resulted in important findings
in this field. The results of the investi-
gation as applied will add materially to
the riding comfort of the many millions
of people who use automobiles for busi-
ness and pleasure.
These are but a few of the many in-
vestigations which have been carried out
at the University. In this work last
year, 172 young men were given train-
ing in helping to solve these and other
problems, as well as financial aid which
enabled them to continue their studies.
The approach to research has, within
the past decade or two, undergone a
great change. It is no longer essentially
the result of individual effort and
achievement but it is team work in which
many individuals contribute to a com-
mon accomplishment. The importance of
this activity has become so great that
many large companies maintain their
own research laboratories besides plac-
ing research work on special problems
with organizations such as those that
exist at the University of Michigan.
Yet, in spite of that change, there still
remains a romance about research to
which we are apt to be blind in these
busy days. Whenever we push a button
to start our car to purr along at 50 or
more miles per hour, we little realize
the thought and inventive genius,
backed by research organizations, which
have made possible this type of trans-
portation. As we enjoy the luxury of
modern train travel, we little think of
energies which entered into making such
forms of transportation possible. As we
turn on our radios, we may think of
the wonders of receiving messages
through sound waves, but back of this
development is a vast amount of scien-
tific work in the field of physics. As we
turn on our electric lights, our thoughts
may go back to the power plants and
the transmission systems which have
made light so readily available to us.
As we sit in the theatre or enjoy our
home movies, we may remember that
our enjoyment in these fields is the re-
sult of scientific research.
So the field of research continues to
grow and expand with results that out-
distance our greatest dreams as more
people catch the vision of the romance
of research.

George comes from Cleveland Heights,
Ohio. In the local high school, he showed
proficiency in a general course of study
and was prominent in activities. He was
a field sergeant in the high school band

George D. Cotschall
and a member of the concert band. A
summer was spent at the Ohio Band
Camp in Cedar Point, Ohio.
What turned his attention to elec-
trical engineering? The main influence
was his desire to tinker which started
with a home workshop. In high school,
he helped to install an R.C.A. system
by which loud speakers conveyed mes-
sages to classrooms. Just lately his Dad,
Harvey A. Gotschall, and he (a power-
ful combination) helped his Mother in a
difficult situation. Because the doorbell
couldn't be heard on the second floor,
the fixer-uppers went through a maze of
rewiring. Now there are bells all over
their home.
George is finishing an interesting ca-
reer at college. For in addition to main-
taining a high scholarship, he has been
outstanding in campus activities. In his
freshman year, he pledged Theta Xi, be-
came a member of the marching and
concert bands, A.I.E.E., the Technic
staff and to consume spare time, earned
his board at a league house.
His sophomore year found him a
member of Kappa Kappa Psi. The hon-
or was merited for his service under
Major Walter B. Fariss (the drillmaster
of the marching band) in his freshman
year. After two years of planning se-
quences for band formations, he earned
a staff position in the band as formation
chairman and in his junior year was as-
sistant drillmaster (which he still is).
But his sophomore year also found him
helping as assistant photographer for the
Tfxhnic and publicity chairman for
Theta Xi; he also graduated to a soror-
ity for his board job.
As a junior, he was elected secretary
of the A.I.E.E., took student pictures for
"The Technic Presents" and was house
manager for Theta Xi. In the fall, he
was chosen for membership in Triangles,
Scabbard and Blade, and Eta Kappa Nu
(all at the same time). Spring brought
academic honor with his initiation into
Tau Beta Pi and he later became the
Engineering Council Representative for
this society.
Last summer George motorcycled to
Fort Custer to receive the required train-
ing for an R.O.T.C. commission in the
Signal Corps. For six weeks preceding
the current year, he worked under Pro-
fessor W. G. Dow in an electronic re-
search project for the national defense.
He has just been initiated into Vul-
cans. Adding to his other positions are
Vice-President of Theta Xi, Chairman
of the A.I.E.E., and Engineering Coun-
cil committeeman for society collabora-
tion. He is also doing research work in
vacuum tube construction. Because of
his many interests, he is only taking 21
hours of work in the college this semes-
ter.
George likes to visit Miss Lorraine
Judson, who resides at Martha Cook
dormitory. After graduation, George
plans to tinker with ultra high frequen-
cy electronics, if active duty as an offi-
cer for Uncle Sam does not change his
mind.

Next semester, Prof. George G.
Brown will succeed Prof. A. H. White
as head of the Chemical Engineering
Department. Prof. Brown joined the
faculty of the Engineering College in
1920 and since that time he has risen
from the position of instructor in the
Chemical Engineering Department. If
we look at the record of Prof. Brown
in his field, we can see that New York
University made a proper choice when
it awarded George Granger Brown, '17E,
the Vernon Damerel Fellowship for gen-
eral excellence and promise.
Prof. Brown received his public and
high school education in Brooklyn, but
we hasten to make it clear that he is
not a "Brooklynite." In 1917. he gradu-

Professor Brown
ated from N.Y.U. with a B.S. in chemi-
cal engineering. After graduating, he

tained a job as chemical engineer in the

Massena, New York. When World War
I broke out, Prof. Brown joined the

FOR YOUR CAR!
THE NEWEST STYLE note in
motor cars is seat covers of
smooth, lustrous plastic—cus-
tom made and woven from the
remarkable Dow plastic,
SARAN. This innovation in car
slip covers offers light, attrac-
tive pastel shades—or, perhaps,
transparency to actually reveal
tints of the upholstery—in every
way lending new smartness and
distinction to the car's interior.
Now, for the first time, seat
covers in light colors are prac-
tical because SARAN is quickly
and easily cleaned with just a
damp cloth. There is no danger
of the colors running. You can
ride on these seat covers in wet
bathing suits, if you like. If
windows are left open, have no
fear of damage from summer
showers. For, SARAN is water-
proof plastic.
There is plenty of ventilation
with SARAN seat covers—
they're cool! The smooth sur-
face permits you to slide easily
into modern low cars without
difficulty or the slightest danger
of catching clothes or hose. The
value in these new seat covers is
exceptional because SARAN will
out-wear the life of the car.
While, currently, seat covers of
SARAN are custom made only,
they are significant of a marked
trend. They provide a striking
example of the constant efforts
of manufacturers to adapt plas-
tics to numerous new products.

Chemical Warfare Service and he served
in that branch of the army until the
Armistice.
After the war, Prof. Brown was con-
fronted with the problem of finding a
job in spite of the post-war depression.
He found that he had to have a doc-
tor's degree in order to get anywhere in
his field. Consequently, he came to
Michigan as an instructor in chemical
engineering in 1920 and at the same time
he did his graduate work. Teaching was
to Prof. Brown's liking, so after getting
his doctor's degree he remained on the
faculty of the Engineering College. As
Prof. Brown puts it, "I kinda stayed on
after getting my degree."
A large part of Prof. Brown's time is
taken up by his work, but he does find
time to play tennis now and then. He
has voluntarily curtailed his tennis, be-
cause, as he contends, "I am getting old,
and everyone beats me." But one should
not get the impression that Prof. Brown
just barely totters around the East En-
gineering Building; for he is a fairly
tall, well-built man of forty-five. He has
three sons. His eldest son graduated
from Michigan in 1940, the second son
is now a sophomore at Michigan, while

the youngest is still in preparatory
school.
In addition to his work on the faculty,
Prof. Brown does a great deal of con-
sultation work in petroleum and allied
fields. During the summer and at var-
ious times during the school year he
acts as consulting engineer for a num-
ber of companies; among them are the
Universal Oil Products Co., Phillips
Petroleum Co., and Socony-Vacuum Oil
Co. Prof. Brown also has found time
to work for the Michigan Geological
Survey, and in connection with this
work he has published two books, Mich-
igan Sands and Michigan Clays.
His latest research work has been in
connection with the petroleum field. For
quite some time he has been working
with Asst. Prof. Katz, who is also of
the Chemical Engineering Department,
on a book, "The Thermodynamic Prop-
erties of the Light Fractions Of Petrol-
eum." This book is almost complete and
will be published in a short time. It will
constitute another noteworthy addition
to chemical engineering literature.

From his room facing State Street, in
the Zeta Psi house, Bill Collamore has
an excellent panorama of campus life on
parade before him. While listening to
the strains of band music from next
door and watching the passing parade,
Bill agreed that the feminine portion
has improved since his freshman year.
Born ten days after Flag Day, on the
24th of June, 1920, William G. Colla-
more opened his eyes on Brooklyn. Sur-
viving the shock (only kidding, Dodger
fans) Brooklyn is still "home" to him.
When Bill came to Michigan, he had
to decide between Chemistry and Chem-
ical Engineering. The Lit School's loss
was the Engine School's gain, for he
chose Chemical Engineering. Bill is glad
of his choice, because after graduation
he would like to start out in develop-
ment and later switch to production,
rather than teach or do research. How-
ever, he doesn't expect to have any
choice of work immediately after gradu-
ating—thinks the army will probably
claim his services in June.
Last summer Bill was in the Chemi-
cal Warfare R.O.T.C. Camp, Edgewood
Arsenal, Maryland. If you are bothered
with relatives visiting you, Bill can tell
you how to smoke them out. He will
probably be in the Chemical Warfare
division of the army, if it claims him.
Summer school the year before was
great fun for Bill, except for one thing.
His four eight o'clocks were on the
third floor of Angell Hall, and his nine
o'clocks were on the fourth floor of
East Engineering. Trying to make those
nines on time kept him in fine condition
all summer.
Bill doesn't spend all his time pound-
ing the books. While pursuing his social
life, he left Detroit one morning at 3:00
A.M. to return to Ann Arbor via the
thumb system. One ride lasted for a
half mile. Another dumped him at the

gates of Eloise—it was even harder to
get a ride from there at that hour. After
a half-dozen rides he finally pulled in
at 6:30 A.M. However, on the campus,
Bill prefers house parties to the campus
dances. Says one can accomplish more.
Starting out early, Bill was taken into
Phi Eta Sigma as a freshman. He
worked on the Features staff of the
Technic for two and a half years. At
present, he is President of A.I.Ch.E.,
Vice-president of the Senior Class, and
a member of Scabbard and Blade, Tau
Beta Pi, and Vulcans. In addition to the
time claimed by these and school work,
he finds enough left to grade Physical
Chemistry papers for Prof. Case through
an Assistantship in the Chemistry De-
partment.
Professor Williams, who recently re-
tired, cured Bill of sleeping in the
Physics lecture by delivering a lecture
to him about wooing sweet Morpheus
in class. Bill decided there and then that
it pays to stay awake. His major philo-
sophy toward school, though, is that it
is better to have a little knowledge and
thoroughly understand it, than to know
a lot but none of it completely.

THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


Did you ever stop to think what
would happen to the Empire State
Building if it were bombed? New York
defense authorities wondered too, until
they dug up some information on bombs
and bombing: The standard demolition
bomb, containing about 300 pounds of
explosives, hits the ground at a velocity
of 1,000 ft. per second and at an angle
of 16 to 19° with the vertical, when
dropped from a bomber at 15,000 feet.
When a bomb explodes, the steel case
expands to twice its normal size and
then flys off in millions of fragments,
each traveling at a speed of about 50,-
000 miles per hour. The bomb frag-
ments decelerate so fast, however, that
they are capable of killing a man only
up to distances of 500 ft., and can do
damage to buildings at a maximum
height of 60 feet at 1,200 yards distance.
Moral: No, don't "Insure with The
Traveler's"—be practical and quick like
a bunny. Get to the very center of a

skyscraper when the air-raid siren blows.
Reason: Indirect hits are damaging on-
ly three stories up and direct hits are
effective, whether made on the roof or
the side of the building, only about 6
stories down.
By using carbide in connection with a
broaching tool it has been found possible
to rifle the spiral grooves in the barrels
of small caliber machine guns and M-l
rifles at a rate of 200 ft. per minute in-
stead of the 60 ft. per minute under
former conditions. . . . One more treas-
ured American institution that has been
with us since the days of Ben Franklin
has been sacrificed to the whims of prog-
ress—OPM has called a halt to com-
munity competition for the gaudiest fire
fighting equipment. Priorities have
sounded the death knell to fire engine
bells, enclosed cabs, quintuple combina-
tions and all other unessential or spe-
cialized equipment ... The scarcity of
aluminum has forced automobile manu-
facturers to substitute welded bumpers
for the deep drawn steel bumpers used
to date .. . Million-volt portable X-ray
machines are now in production for in-
dustrial use. The unit, while not exceed-
ing world's largest X-ray machine at the
Bureau of Standards (which operates at
1,400,000 volts) still has a voltage 2M&gt;
times that commercially available here-
tofore. The machines can X-ray 5-inch
plates in 5 minutes, where previous
equipment took 21/-, hours ... When air-
plane manufacturers found an aluminum
rivet alloy that was soft and workable
at low temperatures but hard at room
temperature, they also got to work and
devised a novel method for utilizing the
metal for construction. Portable refrig-
erators were placed on the assembly line
and the rivets packed in dry ice ... U.
S. in the very near future will be manu-
facturing explosives at a rate of 3,000,-
000 lbs. per day. Two new plants alone
will make almost 1,000,000 lbs. per day.
Present-day explosives are pretty well
standardized, with mercury fulminate
and lead azide used almost exclusively
for primer explosives, smokeless powder
for propellants, TNT as the bursting or
high explosive material, and tetryl as a

POWER FOR DEFENSE
On a ship of the U. S. Navy in
1932, Babcock &amp; Wilcox, the
nation's oldest and largest manu-
facturer of steam boilers, first
proved the safety and practicability
of welding high-pressure boilers.
This advance eliminated the former
riveted boiler and led the way to
higher pressures and efficiencies
every where—more power at less cost.
Today, even while B&amp;W is work-
ing on an unprecedented volume of
defense orders for steam generat-
ing equipment, the Company's
physical, metallurgical and chemi-
cal laboratories are energetically
evolving new developments. Thus,
because of B&amp;W leadership, a ton
of coal, a barrel of oil, a cubic foot
of gas, or even a cord of wood, pro-
duces still more power for defense
and for industry as a whole.

AMERICAN SOCIETY OF
MECHANICAL ENGINEERS
(Continued from page 13)
by Professor Menefee of the Engineer-
ing Mechanics Department who will
speak on the "St. Lawrence Seaway
Project." A meeting for the presentation
of student papers is arranged for Jan-
uary and in March a representative of
Vickers, Inc. of Detroit will present a
talk on "Hydraulic Controls." In addi-
tion to these, several plant inspection
trips have been arranged for the spring.
Following the election of officers for
1942-1943 at the last meeting in April,
the Society will hold the second annual
baseball game and picnic with the S.A.E.
student branch the second or third week
in May. To wind up the year's activities,
a final meeting will be held the latter
part of May.
As previously stated in this article the
A.S.M.E. is divided into three main
divisions; the student, junior and senior
groups. As undergraduates in an Engi-
neering College most students are im-
mediately concerned with the student
branch it is true but in three or four
short years it becomes necessary for
them to think about changing their
status and becoming affiliated with the
junior section of the Society. For gradu-
ating seniors the procedure is simple. A
list of all members eligible for a degree is
submitted to the honorary chairman of
the student branch who, in collabora-
tion with several faculty members de-
termines who among the candidates are
deserving and qualified for such trans-
fer. Those names recommended for
transfer, are forwarded to the national
headquarters where they are acted upon
and following acceptance are notified of
the completed transfer.
Within these few paragraphs have
been presented the past, present and fu-
ture of the A.S.M.E. at Michigan. How-
ever, when the real future is considered
one must go further than several months
or even a year. What the A.S.M.E. does
after this year's organization relin-
quishes the reins, remains for the jun-
iors and sophomores to decide. Through
the years, a fine organization and a real
enthusiasm has been built up in the En-
gineering College for the Student Branch
of the A.S.M.E. To continue this activ-
ity and liveliness the Society needs new
men—men who will take an active part
in Society affairs and who will endeavor
to keep alive what has already been
given strength and prestige.

booster explosive ... Metallurgical engi-
neers have developed a new stainless
steel for structural use in the human
body. The metal, used by surgeons in
the form of plates, screws, nails and
wires, especially in the treatment of
fractures, is fatigue proof, and does not
corrode, forming poisonous substances.
In the past, auto manufacturers have
endeavored to produce as smooth a fin-
ish as possible on all bearings surfaces.
Surface roughness, as shown by the Pro-
filometer, has been reduced to as low as
1.5-2 micro-inches. Manufacturers sud-
denly woke up to the fact that they
were headed in the wrong direction when
tests showed that crankpins, main bear-
ing journals and other lubricated metal-
to-metal contacts actually wore longer
when they were slightly roughened. As
a result, one of the 1942 cars came out
with bearing surfaces which are first
given a high finish, and then artificially
scratched to a depth of 40-70 micro-
inches. Theory seems to be that the
scratches hold the lubricant by capillary
action. ... A new secret armor plate al-
loy for airplanes weighs SQ'/c less than
steel, and has a much greater surface
hardness than ordinary armor plate. It
is used for propellors, gas tanks, wings,
etc. In addition, it is corrosion resistant.

Garg to the contrary, engineers do
have a sense of humor. One advertiser
in a technical magazine displayed a pic-
ture of one of those shapely things in a
class with the four that don't go to
Michigan, attractively displayed in a
bathing suit. A footnote read in effect,
"If you would rather see a photo-micro-
graph, a bunch of gears, or a flock of
furnaces, let us know and we'll fix it."

would be experienced during late spring
and early fall weather, clinker forma-
tion was poor and a large amount of
fine ash resulted.
Fourth—Coals of sizes from %"
down, in general produced the best
results.
Fifth—Uniformity of coal consist is
of major importance in securing good
daily results.
Sixth—Coals containing 15 to 20 per
cent fines can be used satisfactorily pro-
vided the fines are uniformly mixed with
larger sizes.
Seventh—Coals having high ratio of
fixed carbon to volatile matter produce
a minimum of hopper smoke.
Eighth—Hopper smoke is likely to be
caused by poor draft, dirty fuel bed,
partially filled hopper and disturbance
of the fire during operation.
Ninth—The formation of coke trees
is largely a function of the rate of fir-
ing and the air blast. It may occur with
any coal but does not present serious
difficulties.
Tenth—More attention should be
given to damper and air control than
has been the case in many installations.
A balanced breeching damper to stabi-
lize the draft over the fire will reduce the
amount of fly ash.
Eleventh—The highest grade of coal
in B.t.u.'s per pound is not necessarily
the best coal for a given installation,
either from an operating or an economic
standpoint. The purchaser should try
out several coals and select the one most
suitable for his plant.
Twelfth—C o a 1 s for domestic use
should be dustless. Soft coals should be
treated to render them dustless for a
period of at least three or four months.
Hard coals require no treatment for
dust.
Thirteenth—Michigan and other
Middle West coals when properly
cleaned, sized and treated are particu-
larly well adapted to domestic stoker fir-
ing because of their low ash fusion tem-
perature, but are sometimes objection-
able because of their high ash content.
Fourteenth—Fly ash is one of the se-
rious problems in stoker firing. A new
line of furnaces and boilers should be
developed with baffles and with vertical
gas passages to prevent the accumula-
tion of ash on the heating surfaces.
Fifteenth—Customers in general pre-
fer cleanliness and convenience to slight
advantage in the cost of coal.

OUR OBLIGATION
WAR!! Up until a week and a
half ago war was something in
a distant land. Of course, it affected us
to a certain extent. Long range defense
plans had raised the cost of living. The
price of haircuts had gone up to 65
cents. But our only personal experience
25 years ago that the Armistice was
concluded.
At this time the most important ques-
tion is "What are we going to do?" Some
students have expressed the sentiment
that there is no point in going on with
their studies. "After all, we only get our

. silver spoon in his mouth
with war was this economic pinch on
our pocketbooks.
Today, we face an entirely different
situation. The god of war has finally
reached out to involve us in this Second
World War. Very few of us here in
the College of Engineering have ever
lived in a period when the United States
was at war for it was just a little over
brains blown out. The world is going to
the dogs and if we live through it there
will be no jobs, anyway." We've thought
a lot about this and we can't agree with
such a sentiment. We heartily agree with
Dean Crawford when he stated the
other day that the youth of today is
living in one of the most interesting
periods in recent history. This is a pe-
riod designed not for fatalism and pes-
simism but for a realization of the op-
portunities available for a wide awake
engineer.
At probably no other time in the his-
tory of the engineering profession has
the student engineer been presented with
the opportunities that he has today. In
a highly mechanized world the services
of an engineer are at a premium. Just
a short ten years ago the graduating en-
gineer was lucky to get a job as a me-
chanic in the local garage. Now, the
student engineer has unusual opportuni-
ties of securing an "engineering" posi-
tion along his chosen line of study. Jun-
ior engineers are receiving summer jobs
as engineers—a practically unheard of
thing a few years ago. They are receiv-
ing practical engineering experience
which will better fit them for a career as
engineers. Thus, the engineer is being
graduated today with the proverbial
silver spoon in his mcuth. It is his own
problem as to hew well he will use these
opportunities.
However, in all this rush of oppor-
tunities the student must not get the
impression that he is an all-important
cog in the industrial machinery. Just as
some students expressed a pessimistic
outlook, we have heard others express
the idea that all they had to do was sit
around and take their pick of the big
engineering jobs in the country. Such an
attitude is as off color as the pessimist's
viewpoint. There are jobs available for
the student engineer but the one who
will step out in the front rank will be
the fellow who goes out and sell himself
and his ability rather than the one who
sits back and waits for the companies to
come and sell themselves to him.

The Mechanical Engineering Department puts special emphasis on its belief that the func-
tion of the laboratory is to provide actual contact, for the student, in the study of power plant
machinery. He sees how the equipment is constructed, he operates it, and is given instruction
and practice in the technique of testing such machinery. The laboratory also provides the facili-
ties necessary for research by the more advanced students when they seek to design new and
better machines.
The Mechanical Laboratory contains steam engines and turbines and their auxiliary equip-
ment, steam boilers, internal combustion engines, air compressors and fans, water turbines and
other hydraulic machinery, and a refrigeration plant. In connection with the laboratory there
is a machine shop for maintenance work and an instrument and tool room.

The aircraft use of Chromium-Molybdenum (X4130)
steel has established its effectiveness in parts requir-
ing high strength and toughness in light sections.
The steel is meeting similar requirements in drag-
bit blades. They are normalized from 1650 F., oil
quenched from 1550 F., and tempered at 900 F.
The allowable high temper, with a retained hard-
ness of 363 B.H.N., provides good wear resistance in
addition to the required impact and tensile strength.
Technical details concerning X4130 steel and its ap-
plications will be found in our booklet, "Molybdenum
in Steel". A copy of this informative technical booklet
will gladly be sent to technical students and any
others who may be interested.

When the war is over, machinery
of all kinds will be closely scrutinized for its
ability to meet the changed conditions.
Thousands of machines will be redesigned to
give them higher speed, greater precision
and lower operating costs in order that their
users will be able to compete at a profit.
The greatly increased use of Timken Tapered
Roller Bearings will be one of the most im-
portant factors in securing these results. In
many machines—previously only partially
Timken Equipped—Timken Bearing advan-
tages will be extended to every rotating
member. Many other machines will be
given new and higher standards of perform-
ance through the use of Timken Bearings
for the first time.
When you have gained a thorough under-
standing of Timken Bearings and their
application you will be able to solve any
bearing problem you may encounter
and get 100% results. Begin to acquire
that knowledge now; send for a free

RESEARCH TOOL
One of the recent additions to the
research facilities of the University is
the Electron Microscope. This piece of
equipment, housed in the Randall
Laboratory of Physics, makes possible
another order of magnitude in micro-
scopy as compared with instruments
using glass lenses.
The picture below is a one-half size
reproduction of a photograph having
a magnification of 115,000 times.
The large particle is a speck of dust
which got onto the slide inadvert-
ently, while the mottled portion sur-
rounding the dust particle, as well as
the mottled portions showing where
the dust had sufficient transparency
to let some of the electrons through, is
condensed aluminum vapor. The light
portions along two sides of the par-


ticle of dust represent the shadow ef-
fect produced by the aluminum vapor
molecules approaching the surface at
an angle.
This instrument offers a new tool
for research and is now being used
practically continuously in connec-
tion with researches in Medicine,
Physics, Chemistry, and Metallurgy.

How Westinghouse Engineers Made Vi-
brating Turbine Generators Calm Down
A*EP-HET&gt;.
WHEN the two-pole turbine gener-
ator came along, it was hailed as
a great thing. And it was. It delivered
enormous amounts of amps and volts,
did a titanic electrical job. But. . .
Its rotor vibrated and endangered the
alignment of the bearings, collector rings,
and brushes. Its stator vibrated and
made the foundations tremble. And, to
make bad things worse, the vibrations
were different from those found in the
four-pole 1800-rpm machines—and they
couldn't be eliminated by the usual bal-
ancing methods. Engineers had a tough
problem on their hands.
► Westinghouse engineers studied the
rotor and found that it was acting like a
two-by-four piece of wood. A two-by-
four sags more lying flat than lying on
its edge. It was the same with the long,
slender, two-pole rotor. It sagged more
lying one way than another.
%-eooKe^ He(?e
.-v=f : ;^ w\\\V1^-I| )


This was why: Along two sides of the
rotor, deep lengthwise slots were cut for
the field windings. Naturally, the rotor
had more give on the slotted sides than
the solid sides. So, as the rotor turned,
the give in the slotted sides made the
downward force on the rotor supports
change twice each revolution. The result:
the rotor made the machine vibrate 120
cycles a second.
► What to do?
Dummy slots in the solid sections of
the rotor would have equalized its rigid-
ity. But Westinghouse engineers did
something better. They cut several
grooves across the solid sections. These
grooves made the rotor's rigidity equal
on all sides, without disturbing the
magnetic flux. The turbine generator
worked at top efficiency, the vibration
at the supports was reduced 88%, the
rings, brushes, and collector rings didn't
take such a shaking-up.
GUoa/E Jot .

► That took care of the rotor. But West-
inghouse engineers also had to figure out
what to do about the stator vibration.
Massive as it is, the stator was being
pulled out of shape, first on top and
bottom, then on the two sides. The
400,000-pound magnetic force of the
two-pole rotor was doing the pulling as
it turned.
► Of course, the change in the stator's
shape was too minute to be seen. But it
could certainly be heard. For this change
in shape was transmitted to the stator
foundation as a 120 cycle vibration.
From the foundation this vibration
travels to floor and walls, making them
hum.
To put a stop to it, Westinghouse en-
gineers developed a special, flexible
mounting for the stator. It is as though
the stator were supported on two sets of
links. One set goes along with the stator
when it vibrates horizontally, but doesn't
budge when the stator vibrates vertically.

The other set goes along with vertical
but not with horizontal vibrations.
► The effect of this ingenious arrange-
men is that there is no motion at all
where the links are attached to the stator
foundation! The vibration at the sup-
ports is reduced by 75%, the noise low-
ered to less than ordinary power station
noise levels!
The job was done. Stator vibration
was absorbed. Rotor vibration was
calmed down. Westinghouse engineers
had 3600-rpm, two-pole turbine gene-
rators pouring out great electric power,
and making no more vibration than
machines running at half their speed.

► The electrical industry was through
with that vibration trouble for good.
This is a typical Westinghouse story. It's
typical because it's a story about en-
gineers.
► There are 3500 engineers in Westing-
house. They're in all branches of the
business . . . management, research,
sales, design, service, testing. They shape
the company's attitude toward its work.
Engineering is the heart of our busi-
ness. Engineers create our products.
Engineers solve our problems. Engineers
determine our success.

By
COLONEL HENRY W. MILLER
Chairman of the Department of
Mechanism and Engineering Drawing
In view of the recent attacks on the
Hawaiian and Philippine Islands by
Japanese tanks, submarines, and air-
planes, we reprint this article which first
appeared in the autumn issue of the
Quarterly Review of the Michigan
Alumnus. The jact that this article was
written several months before Decem-
ber 7th makes Colonel Miller seem
almost clairvoyant in his predictions.
TN ROMAN times a device which
-*• would project a stone over or against
the wall of a city was known as a piece
of siege artillery. The energy to accom-
plish this was stored up in bent staves
like halves of very heavy bows, in twisted
ropes of hair or in weights elevated by
pulling the projecting lever back to the
loading position by means of a winch or
the tug of war efforts of a score of men.
Such was the only form of artillery until
1200 A.D.; it was sufficient, however, to
breach the walls of Carthage, Rome,
Syracuse, Athens, Alexandria and scores
of lesser fortified cities.
The First Revolution
Just how it was discovered that the
explosive force of the combination of
sulphur, charcoal and raw saltpeter could
be used to project a missile from a pot-
like mortar or tube is not recorded. Salt-
peter was probably discovered in India
and the combination of sulphur, char-
coal and saltpeter is said to have been
used at Chinese courts in Roman candle
fashion for entertainment. That the mix-
ture was used to mine and destroy walls
is certain; some charges may have blown
out the hole rather than fractured the
wall, for this happens frequently in blast-
ing with powder. This may have sug-
gested the crude beginning of a new
from of artillery in which the energy is
released in chemical fashion.
A small Arabian firing vessel, made of
wood and called a "madfu," may have
been the first cannon. Once recognized
as a practical method of projecting mis-
siles, the new devices were developed in
two centuries to the point where in 1453
the Turkish forces of Mahomet II be-
sieging Byzantium set up some huge cast
bronze cannon called bombards within
a hundred yards and proceeded to bat-
ter down the triple walls which had suc-
cessfully withstood sieges of mechanical
forms of artillery for ten centuries.
The cannon used against Byzantium
weighed about nineteen tons and were
transported on heavy timber skids, with
some sixty oxen and 200 men required
to transport one bombard. For service a
cannon and its heavy timber carriage or
base were set on an inclined mound of
earth and backed against recoil by heavy
timbers set vertically in the earth.
The projectile was a crudely fashioned
sphere of stone weighing about 600
pounds and was rolled up the mound in
front and down the bore of the cannon.
distances that the destination of the mis-
siles is many miles beyond the vision of
the gunners. Weight increased from a
few hundred pounds to hundred ton cast
cannon, and hundred and fifty ton steel
ones; in length they have increased from
one foot mortars to one hundred and
twenty foot guns.
In 1500 it was accidentally discovered
that the provision of spiral grooves in a
hand gun would project a spherical bul-
let more accurately than a tube that was
smooth. Such tubes were said to be
"rifled" and the gun itself became
known as a "rifle." The early develop-
ment of a light, long barreled "rifle" by
Lancaster gunsmiths for use of hunters
and backwoods colonists who needed

The powder was mixed on the field by
the master gunner from casks of the in-
gredients. The value of this crude can-
non lay in the fact that enough energy
was stored up in the missile so that its
impact with the walls battered them
down more rapidly than the defenders
could repair the breach. When the triple
walls of Byzantium were breached, the
defenders were too few for the besieging
forces and the city was taken. Since
then, 1453, it has been Constantinople,
more recently Istanbul; and soon what?
Specialization in Cannon
In the past six centuries chemical
artillery has been developed in a multi-
tude of forms designed to carry tremen-
dous destructive power to such great
light, accurate weapons to protect them-
selves is probably the answer as to how
and why the colonial American levies
defeated British forces.
The American Colonial soldiers pro-
vided their own weapons, mostly light-
weight rifles, while British soldiers had
only smooth bore Brown Bess muskets.
When a buck-shirted Colonial stepped
from the shelter of a tree, aimed his
rifle and fired at ranges of a hundred
yards, he invariably hit his man. That
is, he aimed at a man and hit that man
at distances at which it was useless to
fire a musket. That performance was
hard on British soldier morale. In the
battle of Waterloo where British soldiers
were still armed with Brown Bess mus-
JANUARY, 1942


kets it was estimated that 450 rounds
were fired for each man hit.
Curiously such performances did not
result in the introduction of the rifle
into any army until 1865 nor the adop-
tion of the principle of rifling in cannon
until about 1870, although practically
all hunting and sporting small arms
made throughout the nineteenth century
were rifled. The dis-
covery of a method
of making steel
cheaply and in quan-
tity by Henry Bes-
semer in 1857 made
rifled cannon pos-
sible. The pressures,
forces and stresses
in rifled cast cannon
had usually burst
them with the effect
of prejudicing the
idea of rifling for
cannon.
The discovery of
guncotton in 1870 and the colloiding of
it into smokeless powder in 1885, to-
gether with the availability of steel and
improved machining methods, served as
the foundation for the development of
huge built-up cannon for use in seacoast
fortification and on board steel ships.
They served as the basis for the develop-
ment of rapid-firing field cannon, inter-
mediate calibers of field cannon for the
destruction of roads, railways and sup-
ply depots, and great siege weapons such
as the famous German 42-centimeter
(17-inch) mortars firing 1700 pounds
projectiles and the still larger French
520 mm. (21-inch) mortars on railway
carriages firing 3000 pound shells.
Artillery Defined
In the thirty centuries of mechanical
and chemical artillery, a piece of artil-
lery had always been a device for pro-
jecting a destructive missile against a
distant objective with a predictable de-
gree of accuracy. On the discovery of
the chemical principle it became possible
not only to project the missile by the
stored energy in the mixture called
gunpowder, but eventually to make the
missile hollow and place some of the
powder in it, first to break the missile
into fragments on the way, creating
shrapnel, and later to delay the bursting
of the hollow missile or shell until
embedded in the fortification, under it,
or inside buildings.
The discovery of high explosives and
steel and the adoption of the principle
of rifling provided the opportunity to
make an elongated, pointed hard-nosed
shell with intricate fuses so that such a
shell could be driven through heavy
armor, and carry destructive power in-
side the most formidable fortifications
obsolete in the World War and made a
naval engagement a slugging contest in
which lucky blows, thin skin, rate of
slugging, and accurate hitting became
telling factors.
i'

In all of the thirty centuries of such
mechanical and chemical artillery land
targets were plane, two dimensional, and
were stationary. The artillery problem
of operation against them was relatively
simple. When the cannon was regis-
tered on the target a sufficient number
of shots could drop shells in a pattern
over it to the end of destroying it if the
destructive power of the shells were
sufficient. Calibers of guns, weights of
shells and high explosive content were
gauged to the targets and the problem
seemed merely one of placing the proper
artillery in position and of operating it
for a sufficient length of time; not much
unlike the problems of placer mining.
Transportation problems, such as the.
hauling of a heavy battery of two
German 42-centimeter mortars on nine
vehicles with large tractors and over
hard-surfaced highways, or of 14-inch
naval cannon mounted on specially de-
signed railway gun carriage, were ac-
cepted as a matter of course. The
tempo of war and the technique of
warfare were such as to permit this.
The Second Revolution
The Second Revolution began in the
First World War. Accepting the defi-
nition already set up for a piece of
artillery, we find that in the four-year
period of the 1914-18 war we extended
artillery to the air and under the surface
of the sea. Quite obviously, in view of
our present world predicament, few if
any nations appreciated the terrible im-
port of the World War extension to
the extent of preparing to meet the new
forms of warfare, if employed by any
formidable group of people led by capa-
ble and ruthless leaders bent on partial
or total world conquest. World conquest
seemed too fantastic to be entertained;
and the qualities of the new weapons,
the new expanded scope of artillery,
were not appreciated by very many.
Very early in the World War, the
destructive power of a missile projected
from an under surface or submersible
ship gave promise of giving those the
mastery of the oceans who had sufficient
number of these projecting devices, and
used them skillfully and ruthlessly.
Neither the ability nor the inability to
accomplish this had been demonstrated
when the war ended. But without ques-
tion a new and very terrible form of
artillery had been introduced, submarine
ships and submarine torpedoes. Its
targets were always ships. The design
of the devices were obviously far from
their ultimate effectiveness; but even
so their accomplishments were such that
with those alone it appeared at one time
that Britain and France would be de-
feated. No perfect answer was found
for these new pieces of artillery and
they were certain to appear (vastly im-
proved over the previous designs) if and
when another war began. It has ap-
peared and again we are not certain of
the answer nor even if there is one
except the complete destruction of the
sources and their bases. That is a more
than difficult solution to bring about.
A second device which appeared in
warfare for the first time in 1914 as
merely a reconnaissance device has be-
come artillery. A powered device to
traverse the air; taking off at prepared
places, landing at prepared places, soar-
ing at any desired height, maneuvering
rapidly and at will and traveling to ever
greater distances. Given time for de-
velopment this device was certain to
become one for projecting a destructive
missile upon an objective with a pre-
dictable degree of accuracy. Before the
end of the war it had become that.
For the first time in history it had
become possible to drop a half ton of
high explosive on a fairly large target
from takeoff distances across which
nothing had ever been projected. A de-
vice which had appeared as merely a
novel but tremendously valuable recon-
naissance instrument became a trans-
porting and projecting device with pros-
pects as a new form of artillery for
which there literally appeared no answer.
Ruthlessness could have its way given
sufficient preparation and corresponding

be the intended victims.
Intervening years have seen this de-
vice developed to one of great carrying
capacity, tremendous speed and uncanny
accuracy as a piece of artillery. Sight-
ing devices, streamlined projectiles, and
split-second releasing mechanisms have
kept pace with the development of the
carrying and projecting device, to the
end that there is still doubt as to
whether and how the most heavily
armored battleship can withstand bom-
bardment from a heavy concentration of
such artillery manned by competent and
daring operators. The British aircraft
carrier Illustrious suffered seven direct
hits on its flight deck in the air bom-
bardment which it suffered in an all-day
battle in the Mediterranean. One of
the bomb projectiles passed through and
blew out a hole in the side of the ship.
She survived by a miracle.
And the answer? It is not in sight.
Such an instrument naturally becomes
a target which must be destroyed. Here
for the first time we have a three dimen-
sional target, a space problem. And the
target about which we are most con-
cerned, heavy projectors, travel at the
rate of 300 miles an hour or 440 feet a
second, and can change position in any
direction.
This same air artillery is being em-
ployed to project submarine projectiles
against ships and with highly destruc-
tive effects. Descending at steep angles
and tremendous velocities they are pro-
jecting the destructive missiles with fine
accuracy upon the decks of ships, on
land fortifications, railways, city utili-
ties, factories, in short upon anything
that forms a profitable target in total
warfare.
It may be that the only even partial
answer to this new air artillery is other
air artillery, fast and armed with auto-
matic cannon. This at least is one upon
which all nations are concentrating. Be-
fore the end of development is reached
we may be arming the self-propelled
anti-devices with 75-millimeter cannon;
37-and 40-millimeter cannon are already
in routine use firing high explosive
projectiles with fuses so sensitive that
they burst the shell on impact even with
large-sized raindrops.
The other partial answer to air artil-
lery is in an uncanny development of
land artillery. With instruments so in-
tricate that their use in warfare seems
impossible, we predict two miles in ad-
vance of the instantaneous position of a
piece of air artillery just where it will
be in thirty seconds when the projectile
from the land cannon bursts at that
rendezvous. The talent, money and
painstaking labor spent in perfecting
these devices indicates our full present
appreciation of the deadly peril to the
existence of nations from the ruthless
use of great concentrations of the new
artillery. Given time and full appre-
ciation of the peril by all, a rich nation
may answer that peril with great quan-
tities of the new artillery and equally
great quantities of modern special land
artillery for use against air targets.
Given time!
Mobile Armored Land Artillery
A third device appeared in 1915 as a
powered and armored battering ram to
destroy machine gun shelters and breach
trench lines. It had the inappropriate
name "tank." As designed and built
then it was slow, clumsy, unwieldy,
vulnerable, and more than faulty in
construction. It was not taken very
seriously. The writer saw a group of
nineteen of them destroyed within a
twenty-acre area, each by one shot from
a concealed German 77mm. field gun.
They were the victims of a crawling
speed, thin skin and poor gun power.
But astute observers saw their possi-
bilities. Given reliability, speed, armor,
gun power, large numbers, and the as-
sistance of air artillery
to clear out centers of
resistance by perfectly
coordinated action, they
would be terrifyingly
formidable. Those who
would conduct research
to develop powerful
types, construct suffi-
cient quantities and
build the necessary
manufacturing facilities
for the replacement of
casualties would have
their neighbors at their
mercy. Ruthlessness in
the use of this new, highly mobile, arm-
ored form of land artillery would be all-
important.
There would be need for costly de-
velopment of specialized types of this
as well as of the air form of artillery:
and for a staggering outlay for the
building of the manufacturing facilities
alone and a greater outlay for the artil-
lery itself. But given a grandiose plan,
sufficient capacity for management, cor-
responding qualities of ruthlessness and
deception, and a horde of fanatical
followers, what could not be done! And
suppose that same group of ruthless
leaders were to employ all three of the
new forms of artillery, having had a
dozen years to conduct research, plan
and build facilities, manufacture the
artillery in vast quantities, train the
fanatical followers into skillful spe-
cialists in the high speed or blitz use of
it, perfectly co-ordinated, and with utter
disregard to all of the accepted usages
of humane beings; what then?
We have seen and continue to see
what. The second revolution in artillery
in the hands of capable, ruthless men
has well nigh overturned the world. We
hope it will not, but the end is not yet
in sight.
Effects of the Second Revolution
Since the effect of the second revolu-
tion in artillery is to keep things boil-
ing, to render stationary warfare impos-
sible and to put a high premium on ex-
treme mobility, one might have pre-
dicted that the effect on the equipment
of previous wars would certainly be pro-
found.
The World War saw the development
of great quantities of the heaviest types
of artillery. Difficulties in transportation
were not regarded as reasons why it
should not be built and methods were
suited to the weights involved. That is,
the huge wheeled artillery was broken
down into loads that vehicles could carry

on surfaced roads. Still more powerful
cannon were mounted on railway car-
riages and were employed for long range
destruction service. Now air artillery
has supplanted both of these and it is
not probable any army will build much
if any siege artillery in the future.
Every conceivable variety of inter-
mediate caliber artillery was employed
in the World War for shorter range des-
truction service. The intermediate and
heavy artillery have relatively little di-
rect effect upon personnel. They are em-

BOMBER PLANT
By
KEITH L SMITH,'43E
"p1 VENTS of the past few weeks have
." suddenly brought to the United
States the realization that, more impor-
tant even than ships, guns, and tanks
in our war against the Axis is the urgent
need for a vastly greater number of air-
planes, and in particular, long range
bombers, which can effectively deal with
a quick striking, hasty retreating enemy.
Unfortunately, long range bombers
are not built simply by telegraphing
your Congressman; they are realized
only after months and years of hard
work by researchers, engineers, produc-
tion experts, draftsmen, tool makers and
countless others. In the case of the Wil-
low Run Bomber Plant, which was the
subject of an A.S.C.E. inspection trip
December 2, two hundred fifty engi-
neers, designers and draftsmen poured
over 14,000 blueprints for nearly six
months, to come out with plans for the
largest one and one-half story building,
and the largest bomber plant, anywhere
in the world. Plans are still being
worked out for the vast plant. Ford engi-
neers and machinists are at the present
time building by hand ten of the bom-
bers which Willow Run will manufac-
ture; this in an attempt to work out
production "bugs" before the plane hits
the assembly line late this spring.
As this is written, the forty seven mil-
lion dollar giant, which incidentally rep-
resents the lion's share of the Army's
heavy bomber program at the present
time, is nearing completion on what was
but a cornfield a few short months ago.
But first, a word concerning the off-
spring from this biggest of warbird
brooders. The plane to be produced at
Willow Run is the Consolidated B-24D.
It has a 110 ft. wingspread, weighs 24
tons empty and 56,000 pounds loaded.
Powered by four 1,200 h.p. engines, it
is capable of carrying a bomb load of
almost 4 tons at a cruising speed of
more than 300 miles per hour and over
a range of 3000 miles. Ford has con-
tracted to build them at a quarter mil-
lion dollars each.
Plans for a factory to build these air
battleships were first evolved exactly a
year ago. Ground was broken on the
project in April 1941, and from that
time to the present the existing roads
around Willow Run have been jammed
with a steady stream of trucks hauling
sand, gravel and concrete to the project
24 hours a day.
Because of the expected multiplica-
tion of an already serious traffic prob-
lem in the neighborhood of the plant, a
whole new system of highways is being
built, and existing roads are being wid-
ened and improved. All traffic not di-
rectly concerned with the bomber plant
•is being rerouted.
The plant building itself has been laid
out in the form of a giant L. The smaller
branch of the L is to be used for the
machine shop, while the other branch
contains the mile-long assembly line.
To gain some idea of the comparable
size of the plant's 3,700,000 square feet
of floor space, imagine a one story build-
ing covering an area between State
Street and Forest Avenue, and between
East Washington and South University,
and you will have some idea of an area
substantially smaller than this! Fifty-
two football fields could be laid out on
its floor, or it could enclose an eighty
acre farm with room to spare.
On the day the A.S.C.E. Inspection
Trip visited the bomber plant, it had
been raining for a few hours, and the
mud and clay of Willow Run, already
churned and sloshed about by a mechan-
ized army of several hundred trucks,
bulldozers, graders and steam shovels,
contrived to make life miserable for all.
Safely inside, we could appreciate the
vastness of the structure. The machine
shop where we first entered, is 320 ft.
wide and 1,280 ft. long (roughly, three
square blocks,and nearlycomplete). Like
the entire plant, the main floor will be
used for plant operations while half-
stories on either side are to be utilized
for lunch rooms, offices, tool cribs and
lavatories. In tunnels 20 feet below the
floor levels, welders were joining con-
duits which distributed power from one
of the fourteen electrical substations
under the building. A main voltage of
14,000 volts is stepped down to 440 and
220 volts. Chance for sabotage in these
substations is greatly reduced by mak-
ing them so inaccessable. At the time we
visited the plant a large portion of the
machine shop had been boarded off,
heated, machines moved in and small
scale manufacture begun.
Although a large portion of the floor
space in the machine shop is nothing
but a sand heap, a number of the larger
machines, notably four 25 foot high
drop hammers were already in place,
and more were being unloaded at the
shipping docks at the far end of the ma-
chine shop.
The immensity of the assembly-line
branch of the plant cannot be compre-
hended. Standing at one end of the
building it is impossible to see the steel
beams at the far end, except on a clear
day, yet the last 400 feet of steel super-
structure was yet to be erected! All told,

feet wide and six-tenths of a mile long
when complete. Work on this part of the
project is considerably behind the rest,
and is not scheduled to open 'til late
this spring. At the time we visited the
plant, work on the brick sidewalls and
on the roof was about one-third com-
plete, and the steel frame work about
three fourths complete. The concrete
subfloor in both the assembly line and
machine shop is to be covered with 37,-
000,000 chemically treated wood blocks.
The two assembly lines, the master
and the main assemblies, will be fed by
140 sub-assembly lines, the sub-assem-
blies emanating from the sides and
working toward one of the two big as-
sembly lines running down the center.
When we came to the power plant we
received the strongest suggestion yet of
the work being done to prevent sabot-
age. The building housing the four
steam boilers which is to furnish heat
and electric power to the huge plant is
completely without windows, an air con-
ditioning system furnishing all the ven-
tilation. It will be able to produce elec-
tricity at 120,000 volts. This coupled
with varying amounts from a 120,000
volt outside line will bring the current
up to the required 130,000 volts oper-
6250 feet long, the shortest 2300 feet.
Except for leveling off the surrounding
ground, the airport is complete. Best
example of mass production a la Wil-
low Run: one of the runways starts
precisely where the floor of the assembly
line leaves off—finished planes can get
a running start from the assembly line
to take off.
An airplane hanger the size of a city
block, which among other functions will
house the six hundred Army personnel
connected with the plant, is yet to be
built.
How is the problem of constructing
Willow Run being tackled? There were
roughly 2500 men working on the proj-
ect when we inspected it, yet nowhere
did we find the multitude of bosses, big
and small, usually present on a project
such as this. Upon questioning our guide
we learned the reason. The Willow Run
project has been sub-let to dozens upon
dozens of small contractors, each with
the responsibiliy of getting a small part
of the job done.
What about the chances of air raids
on Willow Run? Except for the power
plant, it cannot be blacked out, without
utilizing temporary measures. However,
blackouts or no blackouts, the building
and nearby airport are so huge, (one of
On December 15 of last year a school
to train workers for the plant was set
up at Willow Run. Since large numbers
of highly skilled workers will not be
needed on the project in comparison to
other types, this school, together with
OPM-unemployed autoworkers would
not conceivably make the labor procure-
ment problem too difficult.
As for the plant, parking space for
15,000 employee cars will be provided
after filling in some waste land in back
of the plant. Employees will enter the
building on six overpasses and will come
onto the work floor through a system
of stairways so designed that no em-
ployee will have to walk more than
twenty feet to reach his place of work.
This will both relieve congestion and
localize possible sabotage. Largely for
these same reasons, no employee will be
allowed to carry his lunch, but will be
served his meals from kitchens and in
dining rooms inside the building.
The big problem remains, however.
Land for miles around has been bought
up by speculators, and a tough housing
problem is in the offing.
All this is forty seven million dollars
on the red side of the ledger. What is
Willow Run capable of producing? Up
until the last few weeks, plans called for

1943: one 24-ton bomber per hour
ating current. Oil and coke will be used
for fuel in the boilers.
The plant has a sewage disposal sys-
tem of its own, large enough for a city
of 20,000.
The 629 acre airport that has been
built in connection with the plant is a
colossus in itself. It contains the equiva-
lent of 78 miles of four lane, concrete
highway on its runways, and the turn-
table in the center of the field is a solid
concrete slab, six acres in area. The
longest single runway on the airport is
the "pot-bellied ducklings" it produces
could land on the roof with ease) that
the plant would be a perfect target on
a moonlight night. Since no apparatus
for blacking out the moon has been re-
vealed as yet, Willow Run's principal
protection seems to be its geographical
and military remoteness from an enemy.
The problem of labor for Willow Run
has been a knotty one. Going full blast,
Willow Run will employ 60,000 men—
twice the population of Ann Arbor and
six times the population of Ypsilanti.
75 completed planes per month, plus
100 sub-assembled planes to be shipped
to other parts of the country for final
assembly. In the present crisis we would
very much like to know just what Wil-
low Run could produce—however, we're
no different from Mr. Tojo in this re-
spect. It is safe to say, however, that
Willow Run, going at emergency capac-
ity, could be capable of turning out close
to one 24-ton bomber per hour.
Adolf, have some Willow Run mud in
your eye.

WILLIAM O. JACOBS/44E
AGES ago, a finger of the great Coril-
- leran Ice Cap lodged itself in the
path of the mighty Columbia River,
there to remain for countless centuries
forcing the Columbia to change its
course and gouge out a chasm at right
angles to its original path. When the
glacial sheet retreated into the Arctic,
the savage river returned to its original
canyon, leaving the second Columbia
River bed, known as Grand Coulee, a
deep, useless gorge surrounded by a
million acres of arid, but usable, land.
Eight years ago the Bureau of Re-
clamation of the United States Depart-
ment of the Interior undertook to imi-
tate Nature's work and erect a struc-
ture which would replace the great ice
man. On its crest four ocean liners could
be placed end to end. The spillway is
half again as long as the American
Niagara Falls and twice as high. Its base
covers thirty-five acres. Enough concrete
was poured to pave a standard highway
from Jersey City to Seattle and back by
way of Los Angeles. Enough water will
flow through the dam in one year to
supply the City of New York for a cen-
tury. The man-made lake behind the
dam will be large enough to supply
every person on earth with 2,000 gallons
of water. Each of a dozen irrigation
pumps is large enough to accommodate
two cities the size of Chicago. The dam
has more than three times the bulk of
Boulder Dam and will produce more

. . . largest edifice ever reared by man
sheet and force water back into Grand
Coulee. This superhuman undertaking
resulted in the construction of Grand
Coulee Dam, realization of a professed
impossibility. Begun eight years ago un-
der the severest conditions, today it is
virtually completed; only the leveling of
the parapet remains.
Grand Coulee Dam is, without ques-
tion, the largest edifice ever reared by
kilowatts than all seven dams of the
T. V. A.
The primary purpose of Grand Coulee
Dam is to reclaim 1,000,000 acres of
land in the Pacific Northwest, but
equally important is the hydroelectric
power produced which is double the com-
bined output of Muscle Shoals and the
late Dnieperstroy Dam in Russia.
On March 22, 1941, two years ahead
of schedule, a pair of 20,000 kilowatt
power units was turned on, and electri-
cal energy poured onto a 220,000 volt
line as the first step in supplying defense
factories throughout the West with vital
electric power. Following this first power
distribution, four months later the first
of eighteen 108,000 kilowatt generators
was hooked up. These generators, each
of which required transportation by a
fifty car frefght train, will produce a
total of 10,708,000,000 kilowatt hours
of electricity annually.
Because the construction of Grand
Coulee Dam presented manifold prob-
lems which had to be considered before
actual building began, extensive techni-
cal and model investigations were con-
ducted until a suitable structure had
been designed to meet every conceivable
condition which might arise. Since the
abutments on either side of the river are
not suitable for an arch structure, the
dam is the straight-gravity type, 4500
feet long with a 1650-foot central over-
flow section. The downstream face is
vertical between the top and elevation
1275.0, below which the slope is 0.80.
The upstream face is vertical down to
elevation 1,023.1, after which the slope
becomes 0.15. This results in a base
thickness of 482 feet.
A major problem in building a con-
crete structure of this size (approxi-
mately 10,200,00 cubic yards) was the
dissipation of setting heat. To reduce
the interior temperature which would
cause shrinkage stresses sufficient to pro-
duce cracks if allowed to cool naturally,
2,200 miles of 1-inch metal tubing were
permanently imbedded in the concrete.
Through this tubing is circulated river
water which cools and contracts the con-
crete in a fraction of the time otherwise
required.
Another problem which must neces-
sarily be present in the construction of
a dam the size of Grand Coulee was that
of foundation percolation or seepage. In
order to overcome this difficulty, an ex-
tensive grouting program was introduced
which consisted of filling in the seams

glow worm paint
Luminescence is an essentially old but
still novel phenomenon. Because of that,
luminescent pigments have bobbed up
in uses as strange and varied as London
blackouts and Broadway shows, golf
tees and costume jewelry.
Luminescent pigments have not be-
come entirely an article of commerce.
Actually it is closer to the truth to state
that research is still trying to bridge the
gap that lies between luminescent pig-
ments as essentially laboratory products
and as materials commercially useful
and successful in any large scale way.
The fluorescent pigments glow in the
dark—that is, respond by giving forth
a light of their own—only when ir-
radiated continuously by near-ultravio-
let radiation. To date the most generally
accepted light source developed for pro-
viding this "black-light" is a mercury
vapor lamp equipped with a filter for
removing most of the visible light, and a
reflector for concentrating the rays.
The phosphorescent pigments also
emit light in the dark under exposure to
near-ultraviolet radiation, but differ
from the fluorescent pigments by con-
tinuing to glow for appreciable intervals
after the exciting light source is ex-
tinguished. As in the case of the fluor-
escent pigments, they may be excited
by "black-light" and also by visible
radiation present in daylight, and in the
light of Mazda or blue fluorescent lamps.
Zinc sulfide and zinc sulfide-cadmium
sulfide phosphors are generally useful
for either interior or exterior paint ap-
plications. The only limitation on ex-
terior use has been a tendency for these
paints, under certain conditions and
with certain vehicles, to light darken.
Paints made from fluorescent pigments
are generally comparable to conventional
paints in such properties as packaging
stability and brushing. Phosphorescent
pigments, however, because of their ex-
treme coarseness generally yield paints
that are poor in texture and are charac-
terized by hard setting and poor brush-
ing.
Purity in manufacture is essential
since small amounts of certain materials
impair luminescence or alter the lumines-
cent color. Variations in the manufac-
turing procedure make it possible to
modify the luminescent color and bright-
ness. Further development work is now
aimed at improving the stability of the
pigments, intensifying their response to
irradiation, and increasing the duration
of after-glow in phosphorescent pig-
ments.
steel

After announcing last month that
there would be an increase in steel pro-
duction of at least 10,000,000 tons, the
government proceeded to investigate the
five essential considerations involved in
steel making to ascertain that no part
of the program would fail. The five
necessary parts are pig iron production,
scrap, coal and coke, manganese, and
steel plant facilities.
All of the major steel companies of the
United States have been granted per-
mission to expand the part of produc-
tion in which they are most equipped.
New blast furnaces, plate mills, coke
ovens, and steel furnaces are being con-
structed to comply with the need. Ex-
pansion is being carried forward with
foresight because the administrators of
the movement are trying to make East
and West independent in steel produc-
tion should they be separated force-
fully. Blast furnaces are being con-
structed in Utah to furnish the pig for
Western steel-making furnaces.
However, scrap is the greatest prob-
lem at present. An increased collection
total of three and one-half million tons
is needed to satisfy the steel maker's
new demand. It may mean rationing
scrap, even above the priority control
established on October 9, 1941. If the
scrap demand cannot be fulfilled, and it
is expected that it shall not, the defi-
ciency will mean a greater drain on the
pig supply. Whether or not any one of
these live considerations of steel produc-
tion lags, depends on the time and sup-
ply planning efficiency.
ice box
As a part of the research at the Doug-
las Aircraft Company in Santa Monica,
California, a new cold-room has been
built. This is really a scientific ice-box
in which the temperature can be made
as low as 104° below zero. The "ice-
box" is an 8x14x16 foot room which is
thoroughly insulated. For insulation, 12
inches of fire and corrosion proof spun
glass is used.
This room simulates the conditions
and effects of extremely low tempera-
tures on the various components of high-
flying aircraft. Already Flying For-
tresses are operating at the 7-mile level,
and tests are now being made for opera-
tions above the 40,000 foot level.
This "ice-box" is an important part of
research for even at 35,000 feet the
troposphere presents a near constant
temperature of 67° below zero and men,
motors, and materials must be thor-
oughly pre-tested at such conditions.
Even today, British flyers occasionally
report temperatures reaching 90° below
zero.
Under such conditions, the metal skin
of a bomber may shrink from its paint,
or the controls may freeze and lubri-
cants congeal. The tests carried on in-
clude a study under polar conditions of
fuel, oil, and hydraulic systems, controls,
insulation, heating, and countless other
subjects. It has been found that ordin-
ary rubber hose connections are practi-
cally useless at such low temperatures.
They first stiffen, become brittle, and
then crack wide open longitudinally or
snap in two with very little stress or
vibration. Such problems as these,
which are brought up by the testing pro-
gram, are now being solved by manufac-
turers in the different allied fields.

LEADING the attack on the production
backlog by shaping steel and build-
ing it into ships, tanks, armored trucks
any many other defense items, is in-
dustry's modern production tool — the
Airco Oxyacetylene Flame. It slices its
way through steel of any thickness up
to 30" and more, cutting it to the de-
sired contour with unrivalled speed and
accuracy. This versatile tool flame ma-
chines metal with astonishing speed;
hardens steel to any desired degree
and depth; cleans metal surfaces for
quicker and longer lasting paint jobs
and welds metal into a homogeneous
lastingly strong structure.
To assure the maximum efficiency
from this modern production tool, Airco
REDUCTION
has developed a complete line of ma-
chines and apparatus. Airco has in-
creased its manufacturing of oxygen
and acetylene and distributing facilities
to meet the accelerating demand. So
that the Airco Oxyacetylene Flame
may be used most efficiently and eco-
nomically, Air Reduction offers industry
the cooperation of a staff of experi-
enced engineers, skilled in the use of
this modern tool.
An interesting booklet, "Airco in the

neers, into these jungles, trained them
for map reading, and sketching, and pro-
duced a group of trained men who at
the end of three years under him, com-
pleted the map work on forty square
miles of the territory bounding the
canal. Col. Riley says that there is no
better training for an army officer than
to take his company away from the base
of supplies and have all these men de-
pendent on his ability to manage for
their well-being. His only orders on this
assignment were to "go out and map
the forty square miles and come back
when you are through." This demon-
strates one of the attributes which Col.
Riley believes is a necessary ability of
prospective army officers: versatility
and adaptability.
While at Michigan, Col. Riley was in-
strumental in having the Ann Arbor area
photographed from the air by an Army
Observation Squadron. These aerial
photographs were made into a mosaic
and rephotographed to give a composite,
which is now used by sophomore R.O.-
T.C. students in their map reading and
tactical problems.
Col. Riley has two sons, Lt. Harrie
Riley II now a U. S. Army Air Corps
pilot, and DeMott Riley a junior at the
University of Michigan, both of whom
are following in their father's lead into
the service.
Army officers are not authorized by
the government to express opinions or
to make statements concerning War De-
partment action until these measures
are made public. But Col. Riley offers a
word of advice to those of us who have
become concerned about our status
since the recent outbreak of war for the
United States. He says, "The govern-
ment has planned expeditiously to uti-
lize its man power and resources; thus,
all who have the opportunity of further-
ing their education, especially engineers,
should continue their studies, so that
they may best prepare themselves. Until
the War Department sets up and an-
nounces a definite plan as to draft age,
size of the army, and methods of train-
ing, no one can make a statement as to
how the student will be affected."

Meet Henry T. Fielding Jr., '42E.
"Hank" is a New Jersey boy; he was
born in Plainfield, New Jersey on Sept.
30, 1920. He learned his A, B, C's, etc.,
in Plainfield and then he came on to
Michigan where he enrolled in the En-
gineering College. He choose U. of M.
because of its excellent Engineering Col-
lege (ahem!) and also because he
thought it would be preferable to go to
school in another section of the country.
"Hank's" particular field is aeronauti-
cal engineering. He has been interested
in aviation and airplanes for a long
time; so he didn't have any difficulty in
choosing his profession. He has special-
ized in airplane design rather than in
aero motor design and he hopes to get
a job in the aircraft industry after he
graduates this May. "Hank" has had
experience in his field, for last summer

a summer spent as a housepainter. As
he says, "It's anything but the most in-
teresting work in the world." When
asked if he was a "typical" engineer, he
said that the Lit School impression of
an engineer was definitely "off the
beam." He refuted the rumor that engi-
neers were shrivelled up masses of for-
mulae who sat in corners chuckling over
their slide-rules.
In his sophomore year, "Hank" was
tapped by Mimes; in his junior year he
made Triangles and was secretary of
that society; while in his senior year he
was initiated into Vulcans and is their
vice-president. He is also a member of

M-M-M-M I-I-I-I C-C-C-C H! On
autumn Saturday afternoons this and
other cheers would echo and boom
across the Michigan Stadium and down
in front in a maize colored sweater di-
recting the yell would be the high po-
tentate of the Michigan cheerleader's
squad, Bud Keetch.
This tall, lanky fellow with close
cropped hair is one of the prominent men
in the Engineering College Class of '42.
Bud is in the mechanical engineering de-
partment and is quite interested in air-
craft engine research. He is planning to

Robert C. Keetch
work in this field upon graduation, pro-
vided, of course, that the war does not
snatch him away. Bud says that, in this
eventuality, he will seek a Naval Com-
mission. Right now his thoughts are
turned toward the N.A.C.A. and experi-
mental testing of engines.
Bud was born in Buffalo, New York,
twenty-one years ago. It seems as though
mechanical engineering runs in the fam-
ily. His father is an engineer from Case
and his brother a mechanical, Michigan
'37. Bud states that the primary reason
for coming to Michigan was his brother
who showed him what a fine school it is.
Not only as a cheerleader has Bud
"stood out" in school, but he has been
recognized as outstanding in other fields.
He has been elected to Vulcans, senior
honorary engineering society; he be-
longs to Gamma Sigma, national cheer-
leading fraternity; is a member of
Sigma Phi Epsilon on the Michigan
campus; and, in his freshman year, was
President of Allen-Rumsey dormitory.
While interviewing Bud, we told him
that not only did we like to hear of
accomplishments in school, but the
Technic was also interested in the man
himself in his private life, so to speak.
At this point, Bud's roommate gave
forth a sinister chuckle and suggested
"You should speak to me on the sub-
ject." But he quickly told him to stop,
and on reflection, we have decided that
we had better stop, too.
MIRACLE IN CONCRETE

and crevices in the foundation area. The
grout used was a rich cement mixed in
different ratios according to the recep-
tion of the mixture by the rock. The
pressures under which grouting took
place varied from 100 to 600 pounds
per square inch.
Following preliminary grouting, which
consisted of low-pressure grouting to
consolidate surface rock in preparation
for high-pressure grouting, initial forms
for placing concrete were constructed to
fit the irregular rock surface. The forms,
each of which enclosed a block SO feet
square, were placed in position and pro-
visions for future grouting were made.
When interior cooling was complete and
the blocks had contracted leaving larger
joints between blocks, grout was intro-
duced in the block abutments to insure
against any seepage.
The spillway of Grand Coulee Dam is
designed to discharge 1,000,000 second-
feet with a head of 30.S feet. It consists
of eleven 135-foot openings separated
by ten 15-foot concrete piers. Each gate
weighs 1,000,000 pounds plus 187,000
pounds for hinged parts. Regulation of
these massive gates is effected hydraul-
ically by a water chamber, the mechan-
ism of which adds another 180,000
pounds per gate, resulting in a total
weight of 1,467,000 pounds for each
gate and 16,137,000 for all eleven.
To obtain a crest with a high coeffi-
cient of discharge, many experiments
and tests had to be conducted and the
spillway designed to dissipate the energy
of the descending sheet of water in or-
der to avoid the effects of scouring at
the toe. These tests eliminated the den-
tated or toothed sill which has been suc-
cessfully used on smaller dams. This
type of sill was replaced by a continu-
ous sill which forms the lip of the spill-
way bucket. The tests also showed a de-
cided advantage in using a 50-foot
rather than a 30-foot radius bucket in
governing the dissipation of energy.
Grand Coulee begins a short distance
upstream from the dam and extends 50
miles southwest varying from two to five
miles in width. When the advancing gla-
cier diverted the river from its natural
course, it cut a new outlet 600 feet
above the Coulee floor. After the glacier
receded and the Columbia returned to
its original bed, the dry channel was
left 600 feet above water level.
Consequently, as a prerequisite for rec-
lamation of the Columbia Basin, twelve
Herculean pumping units have been in-
stalled to throw water back into Grand
Coulee. Each of these centrifugal type
pumps, which is driven by a 62,500
horse-power motor has a capacity of
1600 second-feet when operating against
a head of 295 feet, lifting water at the
rate of 50 tons per second. The dis-
charge is conveyed through 12-foot dia-
meter pages to the high level feeder
which supplies Grand Coulee reservoir.
These few short paragraphs give only
a hint of the importance and signifi-
cance of Grand Coulee Dam. It means
homes and new lives for thousands of
people in the Pacific Northwest. It means
speeded up defense production which, in
these critical times, is all important to
America and the future of the Amer-
ican people. It is a lasting monument
which in future years will rank with the
pyramids of Egypt and the Great Wall
of China.

and confusion, and scare hell outa the

pick it up and shake vigorously—maybe
the firing pin is stuck. If that doesn't
work, heave it in the furnace. (What

knock your wife in the head when she
starts asking stupid questions like:
"Why don't the bombs drop straight
down from the planes?"
7. Keep a first-aid kit handy. Who
knows, your rich Aunt Phoebe might
get a scratch on her neck and you could
put a tourniquet on it.
8. If you find an incendiary bomb
burning throw some gasoline on it. (You
can't put it out anyhow, and you might
as well have a little fun.) If no gasoline
is available throw a bucket of water on
the bomb and lie down—you're dead.
9. Take the distributor out of your
car to keep the parachutists from using
it. Better yet, take the whole motor out,

you know damn well you've always
wanted to.
10. Always carry a loaded revolver in
your pocket—your mother-in-law might
get caught by falling timbers and you
could put her out of her misery.

an anti-aircraft gun on the roof of your
house. It can always be used in later
years to chase away the hordes of post-
war flivver planes which will fill the sky.

LUMP OF ZINC ORE—unattractive, insignificant, common-
place!
But with the light of science shining upon it, let your
imagination visualize the reflections which emanate from itl
In defense: on land, on sea, in the air. Zinc is an essential
in the construction of ammunition/ armament, battleships, air-
planes. In industry. Zinc enters vitally into the construction of
engines, tools and machinery. In agriculture. Zinc in one form
or another protects homes, crops, orchards, animals. In ways
almost infinite in variety. Zinc is used to effect economy, increase
efficiency, improve safety, augment profits.
It pays to KNOW about Zinc. It is essential in defense. In
the period of America's greatest industrial development. Zinc
has rendered indispensable service; it is reason-
able to expect that it will be utilized even more
extensively in the greater developments yet
to come.
An interesting mine-to-market story of Zinc
is told in "The Zinc Industry," a booklet that will
be sent free to any teacher or student who asks
for it and gives the name of the school with
which he is connected.

Those of you who perhaps are of the
more observant vintage of engineering
students, that is, those who more closely
approach what is termed "the scientist"
have noticed at various spots in campus
buildings where research is being con-
ducted in various species of oddly shaped
glassware. You have also noticed on oc-
casion the extreme intricacy of design
of this glass equipment and have won-
dered just who possessed the necessary
skill to construct it. There are two men
on campus at present who do this type
of work and we are going to introduce
one of them to you here.
Gunther Kessler, a native son of Ger-
many, brought his skill with him
through many years and nations until
it finally reached the University of
Michigan. His initial training in the II-
menau Trade School for Machinists and
Glassblowers began soon after he com-
pleted eight years of grammar school.
From Ilmenau he traveled over various
parts of Germany following the demand
of his trade. At Berlin, he made ther-
mometers and other scientific equipment
in the laboratory of Heat and Pressure
of the Physikalische Technische Reich-
sanstralt or the Bureau of Standards.
In Hamburg he worked on X-ray tubes
for a manufactur r and in Frankfort for
Professor Dessaur, a German scientist.
Here he met a Japanese scientist who
had worked both with Professor Des-
saur and Dr. Millikan and who offered
him a better position in Japan which
Mr. Kessler accepted.
He moved his family completely to
Tokyo, Japan, to begin a household
there. His oldest son Karl was six but
he did not start him in a German school
there because of inconvenience and ex-
pense. Not long after, however, Dr.
Randall of the University of Michigan
offered him a position here and because
he said, "the Japanese moved too
slowly," he accepted the later offer.
Since that time, October, 1926, Gunther
Kessler has been the glassblower for the
Michigan Physics Department with no
future change yet in view. He said he
was not especially interested in travel-
ling but the continued chance to do bet-
ter has caused him to move about. Even
following the World War I when the
economic condition of Germany was
very bad, he retained his personal confi-
dence and never was without some em-
ployment and income.
In his workshop on the first floor of
the West Physics Laboratory you can
find innumerable articles of interest
which lead to some phase of Mr. Kess-
ler's work. He has developed the glass
vacuum pump used in research work to
a much higher efficiency rating than he
found it when he came here. In one
corner of his shop he can produce light
by touching a high frequency coil to
some confined gas in one of his tubes.
Or he can show you a box full of Christ-
mast tree ornaments, almost unbreak-
able, which he has been making in his
;pare time. Or better yet, you can watch
him at work on one of his many jobs of
construction for some professor's re-
search equipment.
A few years ago, the Physics Depart-
ment had a Christmas banquet and Mr.
Kessler was asked if he couldn't make
some table favors for the guests. He pro-
ceeded in this task by constructing an
article of glass, characteristic of each
guest's work. For example, a few of his
table favors were: a thermopile for Ran-
dall: a spectral discharge tube for Saw-
yer: a screen grid tube for Williams,
who incidentally invented the tube; and
a formula in glass for Laporte. On other
occasions of a more serious nature, Mr.
Kessler has proved himself immediately
capable of giving advice on the glass
apparatus sent to him to construct de-
spite his limited amount of advance
schooling. His previous experience and
training brings much respect to him
from his associates.

The engineer from the Chemical Works
had one of his usual headaches.
"We're pumping hot corrosive acids
through your glass pipe, and it lasts for
years," he moaned, "and the works bogs
down because the pumps can't take it!
Can't you people build a glass pump?"
It sounded impossible. Pump makers said
it couldn't be done. Such a pump required
not only highly resistant glass but also in-
tricate parts, accurate to thousandths of an

inch! Even Corning had doubts but decided
to tackle the problem.
Pooling its ideas with Nash Engineering
Company's knowledge of pumps, Corning
devised new methods of glass manufacture,
even a new type of glass for certain parts.
And today chemical, food and beverage
plants, and other industries handling cor-
rosive solutions have a glass pump that
works like a charm. Resistant to corrosion,
it eliminates a cause of product contami-

nation and undesirable chemical reactions.
Resistant to heat shock, it may be cleaned
with hot acids. Transparent, it permits con-
stant visual inspection for cleanliness,
color, sedimentation.
In the same way, Corning research for
three quarters of a century has licked such
glass problems as the bulb for Edison's first
lamp, cooking ware for housewives, and
tiny glass springs for chemical equipment.
And in these days of metal-conservation,
Corning ability has reached a new high in
usefulness as engineers and produc-
tion men use glass to solve their

ployed to prevent movement of supplies,
evacuation of wounded, to destroy sup-
plies, to harass the headquarters of army
administration. The great 14-inch Amer-
ican guns on railway carriages, used to
destroy railways, kept the vital Sedan-
Metz railway continuously out of com-
mission in the last month of the last
war. Six-inch long range guns on wheeled
carriages were used to make roads ap-
proaching a front unusable. But in both
cases it is clear that the use of each in-
volved the existence of a relatively sta-
bilized condition of warfare and an abil-
ity to conceal or protect the artillery it-
self from destruction. A prime function
of such artillery on both sides was to
destroy that of the other army.
With the rapid, efficient and enormous
development of air artillery, the static
condition of warfare on which both in-
termediate and heavy artillery depended
has disappeared. Furthermore the func-
tion of each can be better performed by
the new artillery which makes their use
nearly impossible. And since the new
artillery always has the added and un-
usual quality of direct fire, that is, self-
observance of action on the target, con-
cealment is well nigh impossible where
motions of men or supply vehicles may
be observed.
One more point is important. Having
ruled out the heaviest of artillery, heavy
siege and heavy intermediate guns, what
remains? The blanket answer is, what-
ever the field forces clearly need, and
can profitably incorporate into their
transportation systems. The Army will
haul along almost anything that will
destroy the two new forms of army ar-
tillery, the mobile armored form called
tanks and the air form, because they
must defend themselves against these
or be destroyed. They have seen it done
so many times. But what more? Prob-
ably any heavier form, up to six inches
but not much beyond, that is so highly
mobile its transportation will not inter-
fere with rapid movement of such large
army units as divisions and corps. They
may not be sure of just what their tar-
gets will be and may feel that in any
event they can best destroy those tar-
gets by air artillery provided they have
it and can use it. But they will cling to
the belief and logically so, that they
may tear up roads over which enemy
tank artillery will have to advance, may
conceal themselves and may operate
more continuously and longer with this
form than with the air form. They may
(Continued from page 11)
change their views by the end of this
war. Even the 6-inch longer range guns
may have gone in the next two years.
Mobility will be the urge to the point
of obsession and rightly so; for he who
can move himself and all of his equip-
ment most rapidly, dependably and for
the greatest distances has the best
chance of avoiding destruction and of
being the victor. It bodes ill for the com-
fort of men, for problems of supply;
but such is certainly the product of the
revolution in artillery.
Our Dilemma
And what might have been done to
prevent all this? We have said that
those who have gone so far in the des-
truction and looting of nations and the
enslaving of peoples conducted years of
research and development in the perfect-

ing of the devices they have built in
such great numbers. There is no magi-
cal road to the achievement of any in-
strument of destruction or defense.
Those leaders compelled their people to
build vast facilities for the quantity pro-
duction of the developed artillery de-
vices and all additional war equipment
on a scale we thought fantastic. But
they did; fantastic or not, they did.
And it is now costing us a complete dis-
location of our accustomed way of liv-
ing, and so many billions of our wealth
that we cannot comprehend it.
In view of all that we must now ac-
cept as a reality what should we have
done? The nation is terribly concerned
and is taking the Army and Navy to
task for not being prepared, for not
having every device necessary to meet
the second revolution in artillery devel-
oped, ready for production, the produc-
tion facilities ready, and the products
available.
At the time of Munich how many
Americans were ready to face all that
we have done since? And had they been
as ready then as now, how much more
progress could have been made, not only
in preparing to meet the threat but of
meeting and disposing of it? In every
one of our great national emergencies
some lucky break, fortunate change, has
come to our aid. In the revolution, our
men used rifles, the British soldiers
worthless muskets, and Britain did not
support her colonial army. In the war
of 1812 England was preoccupied with
a war with France. In 1863 General Lee
chose to fight it out with Mead at Get-
tysburg against the urging of some of
his ablest generals and the Confederacy
missed out on European recognition. In
1917 England and France still had a
year's stiff fighting resistance and an
ample supply of artillery for our use.
Now Hitler has blundered in attacking
Russia and Russian resistance and mor-
ale have surprised everyone.
But in the history of every past em-
pire there came a time when blind
chance failed the easy-going, careless,
blind people who were the descendants
of one-time lean, hungry, hard-working,
hard-fighting, migrants or perhaps con-
querors of a previous empire. What a
bill we are paying for our easy-going
blindness! And will we mend our ways?
Will those who fill the newspapers with
condemnation of our sluggish pace in
finishing development, creating facilities
for production, training men to produce
and then produce in months what should
be done in years remember why?
Research and development dare never
stop. A generous allotment need always
be made for it. Most of the equipment
in our arsenals needs to be scrapped
every ten years. Housing for production
needs to stand perpetually ready. Ob-
solete war equipment needs to be scrap-
ped and replaced as soon as a better
variety appears. Perhaps the engineering
divisions of our military departments
can profitably be associated with indus-
try in times of peace for design, devel-
opment, and peacetime replacement of
war equipment. And a free, easy-going
people needs to remember, if there will
be any remembering, that anything can
happen, because we've seen it happen.
The new land, sea, and air artillery in
the hands of capable, ruthless people
are well-nigh irresistable. Only eternal
alertness and preparation can checkmate
the fanatical dictators. The greatest of
talent, the utmost of energy and the best
of intentions on the part of scientists,
Army and Navy Ordnance and Ameri-
can industry cannot perform miracles at
the eleventh hour, not now or ever.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


THE SECOND DISCOVERY OF AMERICA
In America, science is discovering a vast new world—a
stupendous world that Columbus never dreamed of. This
new America is boundless. Its riches are infinite, thanks in
large measure to the magic of synthetic organic chemistry.
One of the discoveries in this field is an amazing series of
synthetic plastics—"Vinylite" resins.
In one form or another, these astounding materials appear
in such diverse essentials as food-can linings ... and tank-car
linings; as airplane cockpit covers ... and non-flammable in-
sulation for vital electrical wiring; as corrosion-resistant
wrappings for cross-continental pipe lines . . . and welders'
goggles; as the thin film on paper which is put inside bottle
caps . . . and as the invisible interlayer in the sandwich of
safety glass.
"Vinylite" resins can be formed, drawn, laminated, and bonded.
In basic form, they are odorless, tasteless, and non-toxic, and range from
non-flammable to slow-burning. They can be made stiff or flexible . . .
hard or soft . . . colorless or almost any color under the sun . . . trans-
parent, translucent, or opaque. And the result is resistant to oxidation ...
waterproof . . . alcohol-, alkali-, and acid-resistant.
These unusual properties have created a heavy demand for "Vinylite"
resins, particularly to meet defense needs. This is why it is not possible,
at present, to supply all manufacturers of articles for personal and home
use with all the "Vinylite" resins needed. Against the return of more
normal times, when larger quantities for normal uses will again be avail-
able, manufacturers are invited to test these new plastics ... to develop
new and improved things to be made from them ... so that all can benefit
from the discovery of "Vinylite" resins.
• • •
"Vinylite" resins and plastics are supplemented by the well-known prod-
ucts of Bakelite Corporation. The resins themselves are produced by
Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation. Certain elastic sheetings and
films are made from these resins and marketed by National Carbon Com-
pany, Inc., under the trade-mark "Krene," while other compounded forms
useful in electrical insulation are marketed by Halowax Corporation.
The manufacture of all these products has been greatly facilitated by the
metallurgical experience of Electro Metallurgical Company and Haynes
Stellite Company and by the metal-fabricating knowledge of The Linde
Air Products Company. All of these companies are Units of Union Car-
bide and Carbon Corporation.

bor" is now a by-line in the forty-eight
states.
With the realization that our country
was at war there came a determination
into high gear, industries picked up the
slack, and within a few short weeks we
have made rapid progress toward "all
out defense work."
Civilians all over the country have
enlisted themselves in a rapidly expand-
ing civilian defense program. Many have
put their money in United States De-
fense Stamps and United States Defense
Savings Bonds.
And it was this same American spirit
that caused the formation of the Student
Defense Committee for 1942. This com-
mittee—composed of fifty two campus
leaders—is designed to coordinate the
student body of the University of Mich-
igan with the nation-wide defense effort.
One of the biggest problems in civilian
defense work is the placing of the right
person on the right job. To aid in the
cataloging of student talents a defense
survey committee was established by the
university under the chairmanship of
Dean Bursley. The Student Defense
Committee proceeded to cooperate by
aiding in the makeup and distribution of
defense survey sheets to all men stu-
dents in the University of Michigan. As
all male students now know, these sur-
vey sheets were set up to determine the
abilities and interests of the students in
fields and subjects necessary to national
defense. Through this survey the Uni-
versity of Michigan can determine the
abilities of its students in anything from
pigeon fancying to truck driving.
With the defense survey out of the
way, the Student Defense Committee
has turned its attention to a drive for
the sale of Defense Savings Stamps to
the student body. This drive for student
financial aid in the defense program will
start on January 23. A Defense Savings
Stamp will be sold in a savings book
during the drive. Personal contact will
be made in the various fraternities,
sororities, cooperatives, dormitories, etc.
on the campus.
Needless to say, the University of
Michigan may well be proud of the part
its students have elected to play in the
aid of national defense.

Research setup in a corner of the Electrical Machinery Laboratory

Oscillogram of Rotor Bar Current showing various frequency components
Among its other functions, the Department of Electrical Engineering conducts extensive research work. Above is shown apparatus
which has been developed to find out what is happening inside the rotating element of an induction motor.
The induction motor is the simplest form of electric motor, and the rotating part in these motors is usually a "squirrel cage."
This consists merely of a rotating body of laminated steel sheets with copper bars passing through punched holes. These bars are not
insulated; they are in direct contact with the iron and they are connected together by circular copper rings at both ends of the rotor.
In spite of the extremely simple construction of this rotor, what was really happening in it was a mystery until recently. This
came about through the obvious difficulty of placing a measuring instrument in a circuit consisting of heavy copper bars and rings. However,
a method has been developed by which we can determine what happens in any part of the rotor bar; and incidentally, the currents differ
markedly depending upon what part of the bar is considered. The oscillogram shown above will indicate the intricate nature of the
currents. For the first time a designer of these motors is given an accurate picture of what is really happening inside.

The first successful jet propulsion air-
plane in the world has been announced
by Italy. Air enters an expansion cham-
ber through a large hole in the nose of
the ship when the air velocity is de-
creased and pressure increased. It then
is heated and compressed by a motor,
passed through the plane (at the same
time further heated by the exhaust) and
finally shot out at increased temperature
and velocity (but at atmospheric pres-
sure) through a jet in the tail.
. . . Dope on Japanese aircraft pro-
duction: American engineers who were
in Japan almost to the outbreak of the
war report that the eight aircraft com-
panies in Japan have a plane produc-
tion capacity of 10,000 planes per year
—20,000 short of their expected goal
because of tool and aluminum shortage.
At the outbreak of the war Japan had
5,000 first-line planes, the bulk of them
produced in the large aircraft factories
in the suburbs of Tokyo. (Hint.) As
evidence of the assertion that Jap planes
• • •

are 40% below American standards of
quality the following story is told: In
an effort to design a heavy bomber su-
perior to the American Flying Fortress
the Japs bought a Douglas DC-4 trans-
port complete with blueprints and engi-
neering aid. When efforts to produce
even the DC-4 failed, and after Jap fliers
wrecked their only model, the Japs in
desperation invited the American engi-
neers to an elaborate Geisha party hop-
ing for some military secrets to flow
along with the liquor. But the Ameri-
can engineers had been on parties before
(P-Bell maybe?), and held their tongues
as well as their liquor.
. . . The recent development of a do-
mestic source of metallic calcium has
averted a serious shortage of the metal
in this country, inasmuch as calcium was
formerly imported entirely from Ger-
many and France. Calcium is used as a
grain refiner in magnesium, a deoxidizer
in electrical copper, a dispersion sta-
bilizer in high leaded bronze, a hardener
in lead, and a scavenger in ferrous and
non-ferrous metallurgy.
... A sort of practical application of
an electrical hot-foot, a newly perfected
electrically-heated flying suit has been
put into mass production for the U. S.
Army and Navy. Many pounds lighter
than the present sheepskin suits, the out-
fit can be electrically controlled to pro-
vide comfort at temperatures from +70°
to—60° F. The garment, consisting of a
wire meshed wool cloth with cotton lin-
ing, costs less than the old sheepskin suit.
. . . Aluminum as a deoxidizer in the
production of steel is being replaced, due
to shortages, by calcium-manganese-
silicon and silicon-zirconium alloys.
. . . The largest amount of iron ore
ever to leave the Lake Superior region
was shipped through the Sault locks this
past season. The figure was 80,111,866
gross tons, or about 15 million tons more
than the previous high, set in 1929.
... A new source of the vitally im-
portant metal tungsten is believed to
have been found by geologists in the
Yellowknife-Beaulieu River area in the
Northwest Territories of Canada. Tung-
sten supply has been hampered ever
since the China "incident" began in
1931, but China still produces 65% of
the world's supply.

Science Shoulders Arms
What science in the past has done for peacetime
America needs no recounting.
But science today tackles a grimmer job. Re-
search now must give America at war the fighting
weapons she needs.
That's why Westinghouse Research Engineers—
working in one of the world's leading laboratories—
are devoting their full time to the nation's defense
requirements.
We wish we could tell you about some of the
remarkable things they've done already.
We shall—later.
Ever since its inception, Westinghouse has
sought out and trained engineering talent,
encouraged engineers to develop and work out
new ideas, made itself an engineer's company.
We're proud of the way our engineers have
adapted themselves to creating and producing
wartime equipment.

SCULPTURE
By
AVARD FAIRBANKS
Associate Professor of Sculpture
Photos by A. Fairbanks
NUMEROUS persons on the campus
of the University of Michigan have
had an unusual opportunity to watch th;
progress and development of a heroic
size statue of Abraham Lincoln. Of par-
ticular interest to those who follow engi-
neering has been the construction proc-
esses involved in its set-up and the
reproduction of this work into a perma-
nent medium. From irons, wood, wire
mesh, and clay it was worked to a high
state of completion and was then cast
into the harder medium of plaster prior
to its being shipped to New York for
the final foundry work, where it is now
in the process of becoming a bronze
statue.
In Hawaii an obscure plantation
school teacher (similar to a country
school teacher in the States) left her en-
tire savings to be devoted to the concepts
she had been implanting in the minds of
the many young people of the varied
races in the Pacific area. To continue her
messages of racial tolerance and oppor-
tunities for even the most lowly, she felt
that a monument of Abraham Lincoln
would most nearly carry out her inten-
tions.
After a search for a sculptor, the
trustees of the Catherine Burke estate
commissioned the University of Michi-
gan sculptor to undertake the task. Dr.
Avard Fairbanks was brought to the
University in 1929 as a creative sculptor
through a grant from the Carnegie Foun-
dation. He has erected a number of he-
roic monuments throughout the United
States, but his latest one is of America's
great hero of the frontier, whose ideals

Applying the blue plaster
and spirit of democracy permeate the
souls of all freedom-loving peoples.
Preliminary models of Lincoln were
made in a small size about 12 inches
high. After many trials of one study and
another, finally the subject as a rail
splitter and as a frontiersman seemed to
be the most effective and appropriate.
When the general position was set-
tled, a larger 30 inch size was then de-
veloped. As this one was perfected, a
half heroic size was made. This one be-
came the experimental study for the
making of the large model 9 feet high;
of the size known as heroic. Four models
in all were constructed and carried to
completion.
Throughout the development of all
these sizes, the actual size of Lincoln's
form and the life mask made of his face
and castings of his hands were measured
accurately and the models were made to
conform to the real Lincoln measure-
ments and features.
The Armatures
The wire, iron pipe and wooden frame-
work of the models are called armatures.
They are very different, of course, to an
armature found in a motor. However,
the technical term in sculpture for the
rigid supports of the softer plastic ma-
terials is known as the armature.
In the first model only a slight support
is required. A stiff quarter inch bar iron
is used somewhat in the shap of the let-
ter L. This iron is so shaped and is used
upside down. What we think of the upper
part of the L is twisted around to fasten
onto a board so that the rest of the L
can go upward and inward towards the
FEBRUARY, 1942


tical part of this supporting member ex-
tends from the board about eight or nine
inches. Then that which we think of the
base of the letter L extends horizontally
and parallel to the board to near the cen-
tral area. The final upturned foot of the
letter L, or serif, is turned about on the
armature, and it forms the rigid part for
the body of the model to be made. It
is sort of the backbone upon which the
rest of the wire skeleton is to be fastened.
Onto this member is added solder wire
stretching from the base board twelve
inches upward and back again. These
wires form the skeletons for the legs,
body, and head. Then, additional solder
wires are wrapped securely to the quar-
ter inch iron, forming the backbone. The
solder wire is used because of its flexi-
bility. The legs and arms, and head can
move about in various positions while
the body remains firmly in position. Any
type of standing figure can be built upon
such a framework.
The solder wires are put into position
and then on them p'.astelina is added in
rolls until the form of the miniature
statue takes shape. The plastelina is con-
structed anatomically to get the human
form into the proper shape and propor-
tions. Afterwards the draperies are ad-
ded. Finally the face and features and
other details are made to express the con-
cepts of the sculptor.
There is one difficulty in such an arma-
ture, which is the iron framework or sup-
porting member that sticks out from the
side of the plastelina model. This is
inevitable since the legs must be made
to be able to change positions and shapes.
When the position is finally decided
upon, the sketch is worked towards per-
fection and the cast made, then this is
eliminated. In the mould where the pro-
truding structure was, the space left is
plugged up with plaster or clay. In the
final casting it is retouched away. The
reinforcing in the plaster is accomplished
by irons being cast inside the legs.
The second size 30 inch study was
made from the first model to gain fur-
ther details which could not be attained
in the 12 inch size. The armature was
built in much the same manner, but in-
stead of using quarter inch irons and
solder wire, one-half inch gas pipes and
two wire lead cables were employed.
The third model, half heroic size (4)4
foot study), was developed as an experi-
ment in the construction of the larger
nine foot statue. While the smaller mod-
els were made in plastelina the next two
larger ones had to be completed in water
clay, it being less costly. Furthermore,
instead of using an armature which ex-
tended from the outside in towards the
body, the armature for the clay studies
had to be built inside.
Accurate measurements had to be
made in the enlarging process and, in

Cutting away the mold
order to do this, an angle frame was made
like two picture frames fastened at right
angles to each other. They were carefully
ruled on the upright and horizontal mem-
bers. All measurements were computed
in scale to each other.
Half inch gas pipes were constructed
in the legs of the experimental model
bending at the various joints such as
feet, knees, and hips. The pipes extended
further on up into the shoulders and
head. At the shoulders, T joints and nip-
ples were arranged to fasten the pipes
together. Through these was placed a
% inch iron which extended from the
extremity of one arm to the extremity of
the other one. This iron was bent in the
actual position of the arms according to
the smaller model, and its measurements
were found by using the angle frames.
Further building of the armature in
addition to the pipes was done with quar-
ter inch wire mesh. This was constructed
to give more nearly the form of the
statue. Wire mesh over wooden supports
was used to make the shape of the logs
and tree trunk. All of these constructions
had to be made and measured one inch
less than the surface of the clay model
to be.
After the final development of the
armature, the water clay, which had been
mixed and prepared, was put on in rolls,
making first the anatomical construction
and later the clothing and further de-
tails. Finally the character and likeness
had to be accomplished.
One of the reasons for a thoroughly
constructed armature is the fact that clay
does not stand up very well. A very
difficult problem of the sculptor is to
keep the clay from falling; particularly
in large studies.
Another problem is to keep the clay
wet. Soaked cloths may be kept over the
study but such often take away the good
work of the sculptor by rubbing the sur-
face. A tent of flannel cloth and oil cloth
were made to cover the study when not
working on it. This tent had to be kept
wet every night.
In calculating the larger heroic size
from the half-heroic, the difference be-
tween lineal measure and bulk measure
had to be considered. The nine foot
model was just eight times the size in
bulk. Thus the armature had to be more
rigid as the amount of clay would be
eight times as great. One ton of powdered
clay was calculated to be used and add-
ing one-third more water this would
compute the large Lincoln statue to
weigh about three thousand pounds.
Further adding to this the weight of the
armature and also the weight of the plas-
ter when casting it, a possible five or six
thousand pounds had to be anticipated.
The problem of weight necessitated
the use of a large two inch supporting pipe
which came through the tree trunk and
on up into the body. This was welded
to a piece of quarter inch sheet iron,
twenty inches square with braces welded
from the pipe to the sheet iron. This was
bolted to the boards used for the base.
Instead of one pipe in each leg two were
arranged and bent at the joints. In be-
tween these pipes were fastened boards
of 1 by 2 and 1 by 3 inch widths and
of lengths as needed. In the construc-
tion of the body part larger boards were
used in between pipe construction. Into
the T joints at the shoulders were ar-
ranged three % inch iron bars ex-
tending from the extremity of the right
arm to that of the left. Each of these
bars could be bent rather easily but
when fastened together by the boards
they became very firm and were capable
of fully holding up the clay to be put
on them. Onto the iron and wooden parts
of the armature were fastened wire net-

They were constructed to form the shape
of the Lincoln statue less a measure of
one to one and one-half inches. All
these measurements were computed by
means of angle frames gaining depths,
heights, and widths from the experimen-
tal model. The logs and tree stump at
the base of the statue were constructed
as explained in the experimental model.
It is rather interesting to note that the
measuring was so well done that the
armature construction did not interfere
with the clay modeling of the statue in
any way.
Clay Modeling
The preparing of a ton of clay is a con-
siderable undertaking. When it was
mixed and made to the right consistency
it was formed into large rolls. The large
rolls were made into smaller ones and
then added to the large armature. The
body part was made first, then the legs
and arms, and finally the head and the
base. All the skill and artistic training
comes into play at this part of the work.
The body has to be made anatomically
correct. The costume has to be made ac-
cording to the period, which, of course,
necessitates research, and to gain the
true spirit and character of the person to
be made, research at museums and with
individuals have to be carried on, so that
the true impression of Lincoln and the
ideals for which he stood could be ade-
quately and correctly portrayed.
One bit of research might be interest-
ing to state here. The axe is the rail
splitter's axe and not the wood chopper's
type. Material on this axe was obtained
at the Lincoln Life Insurance Company
museum at Fort Wayne, Indiana. A veri-
fication of it was found in axe specimens
in the Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich-
igan.
Casting in Plaster
After the model was fully developed
and after a member of the committee
from Honolulu visited the sculptor's
studio and approved of its execution, it
was ready to be cast into plaster—to get
it into a hard medium—so that it could
be sent to the bronze foundry.
There are a number of processes for
plaster castings: the piece mould, the
glue mould, and the waste mould. The
glue mould was used for the smaller sizes
but for the experimental model and the
heroic one, the waste mould process was
used. This means that the mould is
wasted in making the casting; or, in
other words, it is chiseled away. The
moulds have to be made in sections, then
taken apart and cleaned, shellacked,
greased, and put back together. Then
the plaster is poured into the mould.
It is impossible to handle a large nine
foot mould so that it can be poured, so
it has to be cast section by section.
In the making of the heroic Lincoln
statue, a large section was arranged so
as to cast a mould of the entire front of
the statue. Strips of sheet tin were cut
two inches in width and of various
lengths to be stuck into the clay. These
were placed up one side, over the head,
and down the other side. The arms and
axe were cut off and cast separately.
plished, then the entire front portion
was made into a mould. Moulding plas-
ter was mixed into a tub about one-half
full of water with household bluing
added to give it color. Plaster is stirred
until about the consistency of cream.
Then it is thrown onto the figure until
it gives about one-eighth inch coating
all over one section. This is repeated
with another coat of blue plaster, then a
further coat of white plaster and then,
later plaster reinforced with strips of
burlap. Finally reinforcing with iron
bars and pipes is added. On this par-
ticular piece, two large two by four

Strips of tin were then arranged around
the back in a horizontal manner to make
sections every twelve to fifteen inches.
When the section forming was accom-
boards were arranged with the consider-
ation that the mould would be laid down
for cleaning and refilling of the same for
the casting.

was made, then each section was done in
the same manner, starting at the base
at the back. Each section had to be
reinforced well. Upon the completion
of all sections the mould was taken apart
and the clay and armature removed. The
cleaning was begun by clearing away the
clay from the mould, digging bits from
indentations and undercuts and the
washing with a sponge that which stuck
to the surface of the moulds. All surfaces
were then prepared with two or three
done as soon as the plaster was made
the proper thickness with adequate re-
inforcing.
After the base sections were added to
the front one, plaster ties were added to
the sides on the outside. On the inside,
large gaps occurred where the plaster was
not fully brought to the edge, or where
the trimming was done. These gaps were
filled with liquid plaster and further irons
added to securely fasten the sections to
make the casting whole. The large front
section, then, wnth the base sections

The moulds laid out for shellacking
coats of orange shellac. After this, greas-
ing was done with stearic acid and kero-
sene mixed to a paste-like consistency.
It was brushed well over the surface to
be cast and then wiped evenly and clean
with a grease brush.
Instead of pouring plaster into the
mould, the large front section, which was
lying face down, was cast by first throw-
ing the liquid white plaster by small
handfuls into it to give a coating about
one-half inch thick. It was then rein-
forced with plaster and burlap. Then
large pipes and irons were arranged up
and down through the legs and about
the base and every portion that required
strengthening. They were fastened with
burlap. The irons were shellacked to
keep them from rusting. Then liquid
plaster was thrown by small handfuls
into the sections of the base, and after
a coating of one-half inch was accumu-
lated, they were reinforced by burlap
and irons.
The side portions were trimmed so
as not to affect the fitting, which was
added was lifted into an upright posi-
tion. Then the various sections were cast
and added to the lower portion, pre-
viously cast, until the very top section
was finally finished. Mould and cast
were both firmly fastened together.
The next procedure was to remove
the mould. This was first done by cut-
ting away the irons and iron reinforcing,
by means of hatchets. The second proc-
ess was to remove the burlap reinforcing.
Then came the white plaster coating;
and as one came to the blue plaster, it
was a warning that the surface of the
statue was near. Careful chiseling and
cutting away of the blue plaster revealed
the white statue exactly as it was in clay
save for the fins which occurred between
the sections. After cutting away the fins
and the retouching of some bubble holes
and occasional places where the chisel
slipped through the blue plaster into the
white, the plaster statue was finished.
With this work done the plaster positive
was ready for crating and shipping to
the bronze foundry.
The Casting in Bronze
This work was done by men who have
spent a lifetime in the particular me-
chanics of reproducing sculpture in
bronze. Two processes for sculpture are
generally used. The sand process and
the cire perdu or lost wax process. The
means that the wax is lost while making
the casting. The Lincoln statue was done
by the lost wax process. To get a wax
casting, glue moulds are made of sections
of the plaster model. Into the glue
moulds wax is brushed over the surface,
then later poured to make the thickness
of the bronze which is about three-
eighths of an inch. The glue is then re-
moved and the wax is the same as the
original clay and also the original plas-
ter. Into the hollow of the wax is poured
composition material to form the core.
Nails to support the mould are driven
through the wax into the core on very
flat surfaces which can be easily re-
touched. Then on the outside of the wax,
composition is added to form the mould.
This mould is made into a barrel shape.
When it is completed it is placed into a
kiln for drying which takes weeks to
accomplish. At the time the drying oc-
curs the wax melts out or evaporates as
a gas leaving a hollow where the wax was.
The large barrel-shaped composition
mould is placed in a pit and packed
about with earth and into the spru, ar-
ranged to receive the metal, the molten
bronze is poured.
Numerous sections of the statue fol-
low this same procedure.
Upon the cooling of the bronze sec-
tions the composition is removed, the
nails are knocked out, the bronze is
welded in spots and retouched (or
chased), and finally put together. It is
then ready for the patina or the color-
ing by acids. The coloring is done to
give the effect of aging or weathering
which would occur in nature but which
is hastened in the foundry. Men have
spent many years in arriving at this spe-
cialty of doing patinas for bronze cast-
ings.
The Lincoln statue was the last of the
large monuments to be made in bronze
before the government restricted the
uses of copper. It is now completed and
will be sent to Hawaii as soon as pos-
sible.
As Lincoln was the great spirit which
maintained a unity of the North and
South in a crisis, it is to be hoped that
his spirit in bronze may be a factor in
the unity of the East and the West; the
cultures of the Orient and the Occident.

THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


FAILED
By
CHARLES B. CORDY
Professor of Mechanical Engineering
Chairman of the Committee on Scholastic Standing

TN the school year of 1940, 433 fresh-
.■. men entered the College of Engineer-
ing, and 317 transfer students came
from other institutions. The year 1940
may be considered fairly representative,
and it will be used since figures to be
quoted later are also for this year. We
are concerned in the initial stages of
this discussion primarily with the enter-
ing freshmen group, for it may be as-
sumed that a transfer student has been
exposed to an engineering curriculum for
some period of time and that, in general,
his scholastic standing is satisfactory or
he would not have been admitted.
The reasons for the entering freshman
selecting engineering rather than some
other activity are various, some of them
good and some not so good. The in-
fluence of parents and friends is a strong
motivating force. It frequently happens
that a father graduated here in engi-
neering and is very ambitious to have
his son follow in his footsteps irrespec-
tive of the fact that his son's interests
and abilities may have little connection
with scientific work. Frequently, too, a
student selects engineering because he
happens to be good in mathematics and
physics in high school and assumes,
therefore, that this is an inevitable indi-
cation that engineering is the line of en-
deavour which he should follow. This
ignores the question of the degree of
rigorousness required in the high school
courses and the further fact that al-
though mathematics is basic to an en-
gineering course, there are other contri-
buting lines of study which may be very
distasteful to the student when he en-
counters them. Many students select en-
gineering because they developed an in-
terest sometime during their high school
career in building a radio set or in re-
pairing an old automobile. Skill-of-hand
and hand and eye coordination are ad-
mirable qualities and display talents,
which if rightly used, can form the basis
of a very happy and successful life.
There is, however, a vast difference be-
tween skill in hand execution and abil-
ity to grasp mentally scientific concep-
tions which may be back of the moves
which the skilled hand may make. It is
unquestionably true that the romance
attached to such things as large recla-
mation projects or large pieces of power
equipment influences students in the se-
lection of an engineering career.
These reasons may form an adequate
basis for the selection of engineering as
a career if the requisite ability to grasp
mathematical and physical conceptions
is present. Such is not always the case,
however, as exemplified by the record of
scholastic difficulties from semester to
semester. I am speaking of scholastic
difficulties in terms of the student being
required to withdraw because of the
rules of the faculty. In February of
1940, at the end of the first semester,
185 students or approximately one in
twelve of those registered in the college,
were required to withdraw because of
poor scholarship. In June of the same
year, at the end of the second semester,
242 were required to withdraw, or one
in eight of those registered in college.
These figures would seem to imply that
many of the students have selected en-
gineering on the basis of an inadequate
appraisal of their interests, abilities and,
perhaps, an ignorance of the content of
an engineering course, for when they
came in contact with it, they find that
it does not suit their desires. •
These figures for scholastic failure do
not, however, adequately cover the situ-
ation. We have found that self-support
work carried during the regular school
year and immaturity of attitude are
very potent factors in scholastic failure.
It may well be, therefore, that basically
the choice of engineering is a correct
one; but that because of the necessity
for working long hours or at inconven-
ient hours during the school year, in-
sufficient time is available to devote to
study. Furthermore, fatigue accumulated
during successive or inconvenient hours
may be such as to prevent effective use
of what time is available in study. Fre-
quently a number of entering freshmen
come to college too soon. That is, they
are still wrestling with that demon of
youth, adolescence, and have not devel-
oped a mature attitude toward their
work. Ordinarily these two factors do
not work in combination; either may
be the primary cause of poor scholastic
work rather than lack of ability or lack
of proper interest.
When the 185 students were placed
on the home list in February 1940, they
ceased to become students of the college
by rules of the faculty. The only way
in which they could again become mem-
bers of the engineering family and pur-
sue their work is by application for re-
instatement to the Committee on Scho-
lastic Standing. Of this number, 168
made this request immediately and the
remainder accepted the rule at face
value and left the campus. Many of this
latter group may have requested per-
mission to return after a period, usually
a year, of absence from the campus.
The rules of the faculty regarding
scholarship are very precise and def-
inite; but the fact that the faculty saw
fit to establish a committee to which
students who are on the required-to-
withdraw list might appeal, is a recogni-
tion that there are many individual rea-
sons for failure and that there are many
ways in which failure may be rectified.
It would be unfair, therefore, to guide
the policy of the college in regard to
scholastic matters in the light of an iron-
clad rule without the right of appeal and
of individual consideration.
When the student requests to be per-
mitted to continue, as he must, this com-
mittee is already in possession of con-
siderable objective data concerning the
student. In the first place, we have a
complete record of his high school activ-
FEBRUARY, 1942
13


class, his course records, and appraisals
by his high school teachers. Included in
this record, also, are the grades which
he made on the freshman orientation
tests taken during the first few days he
is on the campus. Experience has indi-
cated that the registrar's rating made at
the time of entry is a very helpful bit
of information. This rating is the regis-
trar's estimation of whether the student
will secure a degree easily or with great
difficulty or whether the student has an
average opportunity. This estimation is
developed from high school grades, the
record of graduates of the particular
high school from which the student in
question has come, and other informa-
tion available on the application blank.
Then, of course, we have the record
made by the student in the courses he
has elected while registered in this col-
lege. If performance in all of these ob-
jective measures of scholastic ability are
parallel and all, for example, low, it
would appear that an unwise selection
of the course of study has been made, or
that careless habits have been active all
during the student's previous career.
Frequently we find that these predictive
measures of scholastic ability do not all
point in the same direction. The first
three may be high or reasonably satis-
factory and the rest may be low. This
may indicate that scholastic aptitude is
present but that lack of interest mili-
tates against the student's doing well
in engineering work. At times these dif-
ficulties can be adjusted by suggesting
a switch to some other college. In one
instance, for example, an engineering
student somewhat far along in his course
was neglecting his engineering work and
cutting classes in order to take special
music lessons in Detroit. During a
friendly talk with him, the Committee
developed the point that he would be
very much happier in the study of music
than in the study of engineering and
such a switch was arranged. Similar ad-
justments have been made in this con-
nection with other colleges on the cam-
pus, for it does not mean at all that if
a man does not do well in engineering
he could not do well in some other line
of work more fitted to his particular
combination of abilities and interests.
It sometimes happens, unfortunately,
that the line-up of these predictive
measures indicates inability to carry col-
lege work. These are always the most
difficult situations because doggedness
and determination on the part of the stu-
dent and ambition on the part of parents
may make the happy adjustment to ac-
tivities in line with interests and abil-
ities very difficult to make. An idea held
very widely is that simply because a
course of action has been selected it must
be pursued to the bitter end, spurred
on by determination and haunted by
the specter of disapproval of friends and
parents. The student will insist upon
butting his head against the stone wall
when the reasonable course of action
would seem to be to find a way around
it. This way, of course, consists in find-
ing a course of study more in line with
ability and interests.
Reasons for scholastic failure are
many. Broadly, of course, they fall into
two classes. First, lack of ability or lack
of interest or both; and secondly, var-
ious distracting influences which are as
varied almost as the interests of the in-
dividual concerned. When ability and in-
terest are not linked, it must be under-
stood that, frequently, a student will
do a great deal of rationalizing. He will
say that he is not interested in a sub-
ject when in reality his talents and abil-
ities do not permit him to grasp the sub-
ject; and hence he is not interested in
it. To what extent this rationalizing is
done is difficult to say. It is obvious,
however, that in talking to the students
in this category over a period of years
that it is an important factor.
One of the danger signals confronting
the entering freshman in his pursuit of
an engineering course is too many dates.
For example, a short time ago one of
our juniors was in scholastic difficulty;
and in discussing the matter with him,
it was found that he had a library date
five days a week and a real date on Fri-

day, Saturday, and Sunday, and various
coke dates in the meantime. Of course,
leave-taking after the library dates was
apt to require some little time. After
drawing out this information in all its
detail, the question was asked if the
young man did not believe he was spend-
ing a little too much time in this activ-
ity. After thinking for a moment or two,
his reply was "I never thought of that."
It must not be assumed that the atti-
tude of the committee is opposed to
dates. Quite the contrary; and the enter-
ing freshman and the upper classman
should realize that matters of this kind,
just as in any other activity of life,
should be practiced in moderation. In
fact, in many cases it appears that stu-
dent's keeping too much to himself may
be a contributing cause to scholastic
failure and it is recommended that dates
be arranged, but in moderation.
While excessive dating is important,
it does not, perhaps occupy quite as
large a sector in scholastic failure as
does self-support work. A student who
has ambition enough to pursue an engi-
neering course and at the same time to
support himself wholly or in part while
doing so merits nothing but praise. Just
as in dates, however, this activity must
be carried on in moderation if success-
ful scholastic performance is to be the
result. Support work may be detrimen-
tal either because of too many hours or
because the hours, although not exces-
sive, are poorly distributed. This can
happen, of course, when working hours
come at odd and irregular intervals dur-
ing the day and leave very little time
for concentrated periods of study. Hours
which are shifted by the employer from
time to time exert a very bad influence
on scholastic success because the stu-
dent is never able to develop a consist-
ent pattern and habit of study. Too
many hours are bad too as it is fre-
quently found that students are taking
a full schedule of courses in the college
and at the same time working thirty
to forty hours, and in a few cases even
more, at an outside job. Such a program,
of course, indicates towering ambition
but judgment of a rather low order. The
job of rehabilitation in a case of this
kind is to reduce the hours of outside
work, or the hours of school work, or
both. For, even though we may admire
the ambition of a student in this situa-
tion, there does come a time when he
must be required either to work or to go
to school for his own good. Where com-
plete self-support work is necessary,
therefore, an adequate solution is one
which will bring the student back to the
point to which his abilities entitle him
by insisting that he work for a semester
or until such time as he can continue in
school without self-support work. The
character of work done varies to a very
great extent. Board jobs, which require

"Yeh, Louie!"
"That brass melt is hot. We'd better
pour it pretty soon."
Teamwork! Good Nature! Individ-
ual Efficiency! These are the qualities
possessed by two apparently insignifi-
cant men of our University who are
mainly responsible for the smooth run-
ning of the foundry lab. When some-
thing has to be done, each knows exactly
what is expected of him and exactly how
to get it done. Good naturedly, they fight
every day and go home friends every
night. Somehow, they are the kind
against whom a grudge couldn't be held,
anyway.
Bert Sheldon, the molder, is thin, wiry,
and thoughtful. He has been a foundry-
man since he started working in his
youth. Born in Monroe, Michigan, he
began as a helper in the foundry there
and then moved around Michigan until
he landed in Ann Arbor some twenty odd
years ago. After working in some of the
local foundries he came to the university
shop in East Engineering and has been
there ever since.
During the last World War, Bert was
employed in a foundry where cannon
bases and gun slides were cast. He was
a molder then too.
Bert has seen some bad foundry acci-
dents in his time. One man's eyes were
put out when he was shaking down a
mold; another was killed when an air
tank blew up. His most thrilling experi-
ence was in pouring a "y" junction for
a Detroit water main. The hot metal
backed up into one part of the mold and
caused an explosion of the mold and
metal.
These experiences made him continu-
ally cautious during his working hours—
a foundry is no place to play the fool.
As a precaution he now wears foundry
"slippers".
Louis Ruffin is quite a different per-
son. Born in Switzerland of French and
Italian ancestry, he came to the United
States at an early age to learn English
so that he could be a Swiss guide. After
he reached our shores, his money ran
out. He had to work to keep alive and
somehow he just never got back to
impetuous but always good natured,
Louie is continually kidding Bert about
his private life. In his spare time Louie
raises and sells canaries and other small
birds, the last thing a person would as-
sociate with a person of his build and
temperament.
Bert helped Louis get started in the
bird business by becoming one of Louis's
first customers. He bought 'a' bird.
Louis's bird business has grown in a few
years so that he now handles seven dif-
ferent varieties distributed among more
than fifty birds actually on hand.
It is difficult to tear yourself away
from the conversation of these two men,
because once they get started, they can
expound a large volume of interesting

IN the same way that naval power
once revised the art of war and re-
distributed political power, so starting
with the present era, air power will un-
doubtedly establish world dominance
with the few nations having the tech-
nical resources necessary to exploit it.
Strong as this statement sounds the va-
lidity is obvious in the light of released
military reports on the progress of the
war.
Machines and more machines are req-
uisitioned by army and navy officials
the world over. Mechanical monsters
clash on land, sea, and in the air, with
victory invariably going to the side hav-
ing technical superiority. Since the in-
credible fall of France, which was but
the first indication of the terrifying
striking power of modern combat planes,
air power has taken on an aspect very
nearly of world power. And further, nu-
merous naval engagements have con-
clusively demonstrated that battleships
cannot survive or function satisfactorily
unless they are under the protecting
wing of strong air units.
In searching out the roots of air
power one need only analyze the inner
workings of the greatest military jug-
gernaut of all times, namely the Ger-
man army and air corps. The conquest
of Europe by Germany was simply the
matter of a series of rapid thrusts by an
extremely mobile artillery. The effective-
ness of an army is measured by its
power of destruction to enemy forces,
bases, supplies, and supply lines. Ar-
tillery is the keynote to effective destruc-
tion and the amount of artillery brought
to bear on the enemy is the only reli-
able criterion of how soon a victory can
be gained. The bombing plane is essen-
tially artillery on wings—a gun plat-
form that can extend the range of de-
struction to thousands of miles. In the
same way that naval power is measured
in terms of the firing power of its guns,
so real air power is measured in terms
of the bomber.
The heavy bombers carry the brunt
of air offensive in modern warfare. It is
their task to carry heavy loads of bombs
into enemy territory and deposit them
on vital concentrations where the
maximum military destruction can be
wrought. The U.S. leads the world in
heavy bomber performance partly be-
cause of the basic similarity between it
and the big commercial transports with
which the U.S. has supplied the world.
Backbone of the U.S. heavy bomber
squadrons is the famous four-engined
Flying Fortress. The latest and consid-
erably improved version of this model
is the B-17E, reported by English test
pilots to be definitely better than the
new English Stirling and Halifax bomb-
ers of comparable size. This huge craft
weighs thirty tons, and is equipped
with turbo-superchargers that give it
sea level performance at high altitudes.
The plane cruises at 35,000 feet al-
though English pilots have flown it at
39,000 feet. Endowed with a flying
range of 3000 miles with full bomb load
and a top speed of over 300 miles per
hour, the Flying Fortress is distin-
guished in performance. To ward off at-
tack, the B-17E is equipped with three
power turrets on the top and bottom of
the fuselage and a stinger turret in the
tail. The seven man crew consists of a
captain, first pilot, second pilot, flight

engineer, midship gunner, beam gunner,
and bombardier.
Another four-engined bomber playing
a prominent part in the war is the Con-
solidated B-24, known to the British as
the Liberator. This 28 ton craft has the
advantage of four years in basic design
over the Flying Fortress and features
an ability to carry huge loads to high
altitudes and over long distances at high
speed. Specifically the B-24 is claimed

per hour and a range that eclipses that
of the Fortress. The B-24 though has
less protective armament and is more
vulnerable to attack. In design, this
bomber has a high wing, deep fuselage,
twin rudders, and a tricycle landing
gear. Recently, Gen. H. H. Arnold,
Chief of the U.S. Air Forces, said, "The
B-24 is so maneuverable in spite of its
size, that the RAF Coastal Command
has stuck four cannon in the nose,
equipped it with depth charges, and
used it as a fighter."

about these planes which are still in the
design stage, but they are believed to
be in the forty-ton class and probably
will be powered with 2,300-2,500 horse-
power engines, expected to be available
this year. Production will soon begin on
these craft since priorities were granted
for the necessary materials, tools, and
accessories about six months ago. An-
other four-engined bomber that may
soon be placed in production is the
Lockheed B-49, a military version of
the Lockheed Constellation transport of
which three have been built for T.W.A.
The Navy counterpart of the Flying
Fortress is the twenty-five ton Consoli-
dated PB2Y-2 flying boat. Used prima-
rily for patrolling long stretches of coast
line and large areas of water, and for
supplementing work of destroyers and
light cruisers, the ship has a range of
3000 miles. Though powered with four
engines, the large, hulk-like fuselage
holds the top speed down to 225 miles
per hour; consequently, unusually heavy
protective armament is carried to make
the PB2Y-2 a vicious opponent.
A somewhat lighter patrol bomber
that occupies an important intermediate
position in the Navy's patrol system is

about the aerodynamics of big ships and
to determine its possible uses as a troop

twenty ton bomb load.

tion just as effectively as a correspond-
ing fleet of larger planes and at a much
smaller economic outlay; consequently,
these two engined flying boats are
likely to be soon used in larger numbers
for the surveillance of American coast
lines. Martin's experience with the
PBM-1 has led to the development of
a four-engined, seventy ton flying dread-
naught, the Martin Mars, which is now
being test flown. This plane holds great
promise as a troop transport.
It is considered good military prac-
tice never to use an expensive and large
machine when a smaller one will do just
as well. On this hypothesis the medium
bomber has extensive application in
modern warfare. This type bomber
which serves in a revolutionary new tac-
tical capacity, is armed with cannon,
machine guns, and a moderate bomb
load, and is used in cooperation with
ground forces against enemy tanks, gun
emplacements, and infantry. The U.S.
Army favors light bombers over dive
bombers for this task on the argument
that the low-flying, ground strafing light
bomber will be less vulnerable to the
powerful and efficient anti-aircraft guns
that have been recently developed.
Hedge-hopping planes are exposed for
a much shorter length of time to ground
barrage and may perhaps speed past
gun emplacements before gunners have
a chance to aim their guns. Equally im-
portant, the light bomber may not even
be seen by enemy pursuits, which fly
at fairly high altitudes for advantages
in attack position against bombers and
other pursuits.
A very successful U.S. medium
bomber is the Douglas A-20-A, known
to the British as the Havoc, and being
built in considerable quantities for both
Air Corps. This plane features a top
speed reported to be some fifty miles
per hour better than Europe's best, and
to have unusually high maneuverability.
It frequently operates just above the

gun is for use primarily against ground
forces and a semi-rear turret gun on top
of the fuselage is used to ward off diving
attackers. The plane has steel plate ar-
mor for protection of vital places against
ground gunfire.
America's most ultra-modern medium
bomber is a sleek, powerful craft that
races through the sky with all the speed
of a pursuit. The Martin B-26 has many
speed of 315 miles per hour and said to
have an extraordinarily long range.
Just as the U.S. Army uses the me-
dium bomber as an auxiliary in land
offensives, so the Navy also is con-
fronted with the need of special ma-
chines that can best solve certain dif-
ficulties created by the very nature of
ocean warfare. In this war, the U.S., to
be victorious in the Pacific, must take
the initiative from the Japanese and

innovations that make it one of the
least vulnerable and most effective ships
of its type in the world. Among these
innovations are self-sealing gas tanks,
armor plating in vital places, and more
machine gun positions than ever before
built into a U.S. medium bomber. Pow-
ered with two 2000 horsepower P &amp; W
engines, the B-26 has a top speed well
over 350 miles per hour and a range of
about 900 miles with a two ton bomb
load. A lighter but even faster version of
the B-26 is being manufactured by Mar-
tin for the British. This ship, the Bal-
timore, carries a smaller bomb load.
At present, both North American and
Lockheed are known to be developing
new medium bombers. North American,
for some time, has been producing the
B-25, a medium bomber with a top
wage a great offensive. Throughout
such an effort aircraft carriers will as-
sume tremendous importance for they
occupy key positions in naval engage-
ments. At present our Navy officers are
properly worried, for with only seven
carriers in commission and the first of
a series of new ones not to be ready
until 1943, the U.S. has too few. Alone,
Japan is known to have nine carriers
with an unknown number more in pro-
duction. However, what may help to
swing the balance toward the U.S. is
the work now being done to convert fast
passenger ships into small carriers.
On most of the U.S. aircraft carriers
there are four squadrons of eighteen
planes each. Two squadrons are scout
bombers whose duty it is to locate the
enemy and sink or disable him with
bombs. The third is composed of tor-
pedo bombers, designed to carry one
huge torpedo or three large bombs, and
the fourth squadron is composed of fast
fighter planes used to protect the fleet
from enemy air attack.
The American emphasis on Navy
bombing planes has been with dive
bombers, although recent developments
have shown torpedo bombers to be the
more dangerous of the two types. In the
future they will probably work only as
a team. The principal reason why the
Navy has used dive bombers rather
than carrier-based medium bombers is
that experience has shown that the best
way to hit a moving boat is to aim one's
plane directly at it in a dive, changing
course as the target changes.
The Brewster SB2A-1 is America's
newest high speed, long range, heavy
dive bomber. This ship is said to be
considerably faster than any dive
bomber now in use, and has twice the
range and load carrying capacity of the
German Stuka. It can fly non-stop from
New York to Los Angeles. The SB2A-1
was developed for the Navy for opera-
tions from the decks of carriers at sea.
An export version, called the Brewster
Bermuda and designed for land opera-
tion, is now in the first stages of large
quantity production for the air forces
of both Great Britain and the Nether-
lands East Indies. The SB2A-1 is an
all-metal, mid-wing monoplane powered
by a 1700 horsepower Wright Cyclone
engine. There is a crew of two, the gun-
ner being housed in a power-operated
turret in the center of the ship. Special
split flaps in the trailing edge of the
wing act as brakes to slow down the
bomber when diving on its target. Pilot
and gunner are protected by armor
plating and fuel and oil tanks are of the
latest bullet-proof type.
No performance figures have been re-
leased on the Curtiss SB2C-1 Navy dive
bomber. Presumably this ship is ultra-
modern for the Navy contract specifica-
tions called for an aircraft having twice
the load capacity of any production
dive bomber, twice the range and arma-
ment, a four and one-half hour advan-
tage in flight duration and a speed which
is one hundred miles per hour faster.
The SB2C-1 is a two place, all metal,
femi-midwing monoplane with folding
wings for carrier storage and powered
with a single 1700 horsepower Cyclone.
Another scout dive bomber about
which no performance figures have been
released is the Douglas SBD-1. In the

basic design as the Navy's new torpedo

The Douglas A-24 dive bomber scout
is an army version of the well-known
Navy Douglas SBD-3. Increased em-
phasis on dive bombing is reported
scheduled for the Army Air Corps, with
one complete Air Force Combat com-
mand group to be equipped with the
new A-24 bombers now being delivered.
In its various forms, the bomber is
the most formidable military invention
in history. However, as with all new
weapons, there has been developed a
counterweapon with which to neutralize
and parry the advances of the bomber.
This counterweapon is the pursuit plane
of which there are three general cate-
gories: interceptors, convoy fighters, and
fighters.
The function of the interceptor is to
defend a specific objective from enemy
bombers. The interceptor is based near
the objective and awaits word that the
enemy is coming, then takes off with a
high rate of climb to ward off the invad-
ing bomber before it can reach the tar-
get. Only in the past few years have
miles per hour. This single-seat inter-
ceptor is reported to be the fastest
single-engined plane in the world. It has
done about 680 miles per hour in a dive,
which indicates efficient streamlining
and very rugged construction. Although
altitude performance figures are a mili-
tary secret, it is generally believed that
the P-47 may be America's answer to
the great need for high-altitude fighters.
The ship is big and heavy; in fact, it
weighs 13,500 pounds. It is heavily ar-
mored and is equipped with unusually
heavy firing armament.
The Lockheed P-38 interceptor is fa-
miliar to everyone because of the novel
appearance made by its twin-boom con-
struction. Powered with two 1325-horse-
power Allison engines, the P-38, with its
lone pilot, climbs faster than a mile a
minute and has a service ceiling of
30,000 feet. The plane has a top speed
of approximately 450 miles per hour and
a range of six hundred miles.
The second type of pursuit, the con-
voy fighter, accompanies and protects its
own bombers. Convoy fighters are re-
quired to have a long enough range to
stay with their own marauding bombers,
and in addition sufficient speed, maneu-
verability, and fire power to defend the
bombers against enemy pursuits. This
type aircraft is very difficult to design
because the large fuel load cuts down
speed and maneuverability, and a sec-
ond engine to pull up speed also cuts
down on maneuverability.
The Navy Vought F4U-1, or Corsair,
is the outstanding American convoy
fighter. The gull wing design innovates
two radiators installed as sections of the
leading edge. Presumably one radiator
is part of the oil cooling system and the
other serves to cool the supercharged
intake air and thus increase the density
of the cylinder charges. This plane can
accompany bombers a good deal farther
than ordinary fighters, for it has a range
of nearly one thousand miles. Its big-
gest drawback is its size which reduces
the number of fighters a carrier can
carry. Built around the new 2000-
horsepower engine, this pursuit has a top
speed of over 400 miles per hour.
The pure fighter, which is the third
type of pursuit plane, has extreme speed
and maneuverability, and it is charac-
terized further by a short range. Their
job is to rove the home sky and to keep
it cleared of enemy aircraft. These
planes are highly sensitive, and for
proper manipulation require the utmost
in pilot coordination.
The Curtiss P-40 is a sleek, stream-
lined fighter powered by Allison, or by
Rolls-Royce Merlin, if exported to Brit-
ain under the name of Kittyhawk. The
plane has a speed of nearly 400 miles
per hour and a 25,000-foot ceiling.
There are five machine guns in each
wing.
The extensively publicized Bell P-39,
or Airacobra, has about the same per-
formance as the P-40. The two ships
are somewhat similar in exterior design,
but the P-39 features a cannon in the
hollow propellor shaft.
As excellent as all of these planes
may be, their fighting strength can only
be proportional to their numbers. It was
to make the U. S. the world's over-
whelming air power that President
Roosevelt demanded a production rate
of 60,000 planes this year and 125,000
in 1943. This represents a tremendous
acceleration in plane production from
5,000 in 1940 and 19,000 in 1941. Only
in the U. S., famed for its abundant
natural resources and ingenious mass
production, is such a feat possible.

aluminum saver
Since aluminum and magnesium is
needed for bombers, fighters and combat
planes, builders of equally important
trainers must make an effort to reduce
their own consumption of these products.
To this end, one aircraft manufacturer
has developed a new type of plastic-
bonded plywood ship especially designed
for civilian flight training. The plane is
called the Victory Trainer and features
a retractable landing gear.
The plane is built throughout with
wood, fastened with glue. Large molded
sheets without rivets form the wing-
leading edges and fuselage. The body
consists of two shells, one for each side.
When given its finished paint, the fuse-
lage surface is as smooth as glass. Ribs
are constructed of a solid plywood web
with laminated caps and stiffeners for
rigidity. The landing gear is of the hy-
draulic retractable type, folding in to-
ward the fuselage. A hand pump will
raise or lower the gear in six seconds.
Cockpit enclosures of acrylic sheets are
a permanent part of the plane. An en-
gine mount of welded tubular steel sup-
ports the six-cylinder, horizontally op-
posed, 175 H.P., Lycoming engine.
The plane is a step forward in that its
speed is increased 25 mph for the same
horsepower due to the lessened resist-
ance of the rivetless structure. The Vic-
tory Trainer has a cruising radius of
1000 miles, carrying two pilots, neces-
sary equipment and instruments and
fuel and oil. Top speed is over 165 mph
and landing speed is 70 mph.
It required months of study and re-
search for the manufacturer to develop
his special process for molding and form-
ing the plastic-bonded plywood. The
wood is virtually fire resistant, imper-
vious to water or oil and highly resistant
to shock and impact. Development of
this trainer may help speed aircraft pro-
duction by permitting use of Pacific
Coast constructional materials and re-
leasing more aluminum and magnesium
for war-planes.
quick dies
Traditionally an intricate and slow
process, die making, in certain applica-
tions, has been measurably accelerated.
One of the West Coast aircraft manufac-
turers has developed cast Kirksite metal
dies to replace tool-steel dies and zinc
drop-hammer dies now in prevailing use.
The Kirksite metal is an alloy of zinc,
aluminum, copper, and magnesium.
Time saving is the greatest advantage
for this process. A drawing of a newly
tern. In another one and one-half hours,
the Kirksite is poured into the mold.
Three and one-half hours later the new
Kirksite die has been finish machined,
and installed in the punch press. Eight
hours and seven minutes after the draw-
ing was submitted to the pattern shop,
the die is producing parts.
Economy is the second important ad-
vantage to the use of Kirksite. Not only
is money saved on the man hours neces-
sary for construction but also, the metal
can be remelted and cast for new dies
where the tool steel dies could only be
sold for scrap at a loss. The high strength
and hardness of the alloy give it desir-
able wearing qualities. Speed of fabrica-
tion and flexibility of the material make
it especially adaptable to our present
fast production schedules.
rheotron
What the cyclotron does for positive
ions, the rheotron does for negative
electrons, but does it in a different way.
By means of this new unit, electrons are
accelerated to the highest speed ever at-
tained by a man-made apparatus. It
gives the electrons energy corresponding
to 20,000,000 volts and also produces
x-rays of this power.

waiting on table an hour at meal time
three times a day, ordinarily have little
influence on scholastic performance. In
the ordinary course of events, with a
student of average scholastic aptitude,
not much more than this should be at-
tempted if a full time program of scho-
lastic work is elected. It is only the very
good students who can go much beyond
this within any degree of safety.
In this list of reasons for scholastic
failure, one would naturally expect some
comment about the influence of frater-
nities. It is doubtless true that in many
cases fraternities have exerted a stabiliz-
ing influence by taking an entering
freshman by the nape of the neck and
insisting that he buckle down to busi-
ness. If this buckling down process is
successful, the recipient of such treat-
ment does not get into scholastic diffi-
culties and this activity of the frater-
nities does not come into the picture
where it may be appraised as a helpful
influence. It is found very frequently,
however, that among students in scho-
lastic difficulties, fraternities may exert
a detrimental influence, not in all cases,
but in many. It is frequently found, for
example, that a student will start on the
slide to scholastic failure the semester
that he is initiated into a fraternity. It
may be that a lack of maturity on his
part makes it impossible for him to ad-
just himself to this new influence in his
life in a proper way. He is not able to
take the companionship in his house
with moderation but must fritter away
his time in card playing, intramural
sports, and in other activities so entic-
ing to some students.
Lack of maturity, as mentioned above,
accounts for another very important
reason for scholastic failure, it is mani-
fested in a lack of concentration on the
main issue, which presumably should be
the earning of an engineering degree. In-
stead of utilizing available time profit-
ably and developing a workable schedule
of use for the various hours in the day,
time is wasted in excessive reading of
magazines, too much time devoted to
the radio, intramural activities, and per-
haps over-emphasis on athletics. One
student seemed to have developed this
difficulty to a very high degree. It de-
veloped in a conference with him that
most of the free time which he had dur-
ing the day was devoted to taking care
of his personal business. It was very
difficult to get at just what this personal
business was except that it apparently
involved proper selection of shaving
cream, tooth paste, and selection of
proper magazines for his bed time read-
ing, and other such matters. He seemed
happily oblivious of the fact that there
might be things more important than
a precise choice between just the right
kind of shaving cream or tooth paste.
Over-emphasis on athletics inevitably
comes into a discussion of scholastic
failure and here, of course, it must be
realized that what would be excessive
for a student who does not grasp things
quickly might be a perfectly normal
schedule of athletic participation needs
to be defined in terms of the individual
student. However, most of the difficulty
due to athletics is not apt to fall in the
category of one of the major sports such
as football, although this is, of course,
a factor. Intramural activities, as a rep-
resentative of a house or dormitory
team, seem to occupy a more important
position in this field than do the var-
ious varsity sports. Some students in
scholastic difficulties are found to fol-
low the season's round in intramural ac-
tivities. They will start in with touch
football, switch to basketball, hockey.

baseball, and wind up the year with a
good time but with an average which
requires them to withdraw from college.
Like excessive dating and fraternities,
these extracurricular activities must be
taken in moderation and the student
must realize that major concentration
must be devoted to the main issue, that
of getting his degree. He must realize,
furthermore, that he will not be able to
do this unless he is able to develop a
habit and a mode of thinking which per-
mits to him to concentrate upon the es-
sentials rather than on the incidentals
of college life.
Physical exercise is important in a
well-rounded program of college life;
but again, too much is too much, and
the student must develop the ability to
determine with some degree of precise-
ness just how far he can go in these
lines; and he will, if he is smart, develop
this prospective on his own hook before
he has to have the Committee on Scho-
lastic Standing do it for him.
Perhaps we are fortunate here in the
attitude of the coaches of major varsity
sports. They have exemplified a spirit of
cooperation which is very helpful. The
scholastic failure is of no use to them,
of course, for teams are composed of
students who maintain passing averages.
One of the difficulties is that a student
in practicing for a team during a semes-
ter may fool himself and the coaches
into believing that he is doing satisfac-
tory work, and this is a curious situa-
tion and one very frequently found. A
student in scholastic difficulties will
often insist that he thought he was do-
ing good work up to the point where he
received a below passing grade. This ex-
cuse is not a very good one because
freshman are informed twice each semes-
ter as to their standing and upperclass-
men are informed in the middle of each
semester as to whether they are failing
in any course. But it must be recalled,
when we speak of organized athletics,
that injudicious participation in intra-
mural activities, at least for the engi-
neering student, is much more important
as a cause of scholastic failure than is
participation in one of the varsity sports.
This lack of concentration upon the
main issues breaks out in another way.
The student, for example, devotes his
time to drawing ships and reading maga-
zines about naval matters before he is
sufficiently acquainted with the basic
mathematical and mechanical informa-
tion which would permit him to tackle
ship designing in a logical and organized
way, or he may be too interested in
playing around with short-wave radio
to bother about the necessary and
preparatory courses which are a part of
an electrical engineering curriculum. We
had one freshman, for example, who was
very anxious to take a course in hy-
draulic machinery for the purpose of

Injudicious hours of study and sleep
are frequently contributing causes to
scholastic failure. Frequently in confer-

study periods last until 1:30 or 2 o'clock

the same time, the student has to get up

bination may be, furthermore, that the
student begins to study about 9 o'clock,
and when inquiry is made as to why
such a distribution of study time is fol-
lowed, the explanation may be that it
is just difficult to get down to study be-

student feels that he must get his work
done, consequently the 1:30 to 2 o'clock
hour. To be sure a normal amount of
sleep must be secured day in and day
out if satisfactory scholastic perform-
ance is to result. When a student re-
mains up consistently, or even fre-
quently, to 1:30 or 2 o'clock he is men-
tally in a fog the next day and is in no
position to grasp the matters discussed
in class. The net result of such poorly
organized study habits is an accumula-
tion of fatigue, which, as time goes on,
will require more and more time for a
given unit of work to the point of ulti-
mate failure. And the surprising thing
in many cases is that a statement of
these late hours is trotted out with the
appearance of its meriting commenda-
tion. Adjustment in difficulties of this
sort, if no other is present, is compara-
tively easy.
Perhaps over-ambition may be men-
tioned as a separate contributing factor
to scholastic failure. This may be im-
portant even though self-support work
is not involved. For some reason or
other, a student may wish to elect an ex-
cessive number of hours and many con-
vince his classifer that he should be per-
mitted to do so. He may make his choice
with the best intentions but with an in-
adequate realization of the amount of
work involved in the combination of
courses elected. He may begin to slip
and as he begins to slip, doggedness,
pride, or over-active ambition may cause
him to tackle his work with fury, and
may lead him to extend his hours of
study far into the night—with a con-
tinuing and increasing below passing
performance. When queried afterwards
as to why the program was tackled in
the first place, the answer is quite likely
to be that a certain job was in prospect
at a certain time; and if this was not
secured, apparently in the mind of the
student, the world would come to an
end. If queried as why some of the work
was not dropped when it became evident
that difficulties were in sight, the state-
ment is usually, "I thought I was doing
pretty well," or "I thought I could make
it." Apparently the ability to judge
one's progress and status is a talent
which is lacking in a great many stu-
dents. Of course, the classifier can not
be blamed for a situation of this kind.
At periods of classification he is work-
ing under great pressure and the stu-
dent may put up such an insistent de-
mand for an extended schedule that he
may come to the conclusion that it is
part of the educational process to de-
velop a sense of what can and what can
not be done in scholastic work. This
reason for scholastic failure is more apt
to be found in cases of the above aver-
age student than in the below average
student.
For students living in this area, visits
home on weekends occur all too fre-
quently as an contributing cause in scho-
lastic failure. Again it is a matter of
moderation. At times a student whose
home is in Detroit will thumb his way
back and forth every weekend or every
other weekend. The time involved, the
shift in interests, with the absence of
any consistent study is almost sure to
end in dire results. But like injudicious
hours of study, this is a matter of rather
simple remedy, and it has to be rem-
edied wherever found if the student is to
secure a degree in engineering.
Health and study conditions fre-
quently play an important role in scho-
lastic failure. These matters must be
surveyed with care, and where diffi-
culties appear to exist, must be adjusted
in cooperation with the student and with
other departments and facilities avail-
able in the university organization.
In outlining the reasons for below
passing averages, the discussion must
proceed in a straight line—must con-
sider one factor at a time. It is obvious
that, in an individual case, several or
all of these factors may be involved.
The job is to untangle the complicated
skein and to get the trend of the stu-
dent's activities straightened out in such
a way that he sees the mistakes which
have been made. The problem is there
to help organize his ensuing activities
in such a way that he can develop some
appreciation of what is essential and
what is not essential in his career.
Few statistics have been quoted so
far; and, as a matter of fact, statistics
are not too important in this situation,
for generally the question is one of per-
sonal rather than a statistical nature—
if scholastic ability seems to be present.
A few more figures may be interesting.
The list of students whom the rules of
the faculty required to withdraw be-
cause of poor averages is made out at
the end of the fi-st semester in Febru-
ary and at the end of the second semes-
ter in June. We may take figures for Feb-
ruary, 1940 as somewhat representative.
At this time 185 students out of the
total enrollment of 2150 were required
to withdraw. Of this number required
to withdraw 168 appealed to the Com-
mittee on Scholastic Standing for im-
mediate reinstatement. A little over 30
per cent of these immediate requests
were refused and approximately 10 per
cent of the remainder were reinstated
to take work in other departments of

the University. The question naturally
rises as to the ultimate success of the
student who obtains the dubious honor
of making the required-to-withdraw list.
Considerable information is available on
this particular point, but rather than
belabor this article with a detail recita-
tion of figures, it is perhaps sufficient
to say that one in five eventually gradu-
ates or leaves the college for other than
scholastic reasons, in good standing.

THE DEVELOPMENT and production of syn-
thetic aromatic chemicals is a division of
Dow's activities that is rapidly growing and
constantly revealing new market possi-
bilities. They are chemicals necessary for
the creation of both fragrance and flavor
in a wide variety of products.
The delightful fragrances of the rose, the
gardenia and the orange blossom are
being recreated with the aid of an ever
increasing number of perfume bases.
Tobacco, chewing gum, soft drinks and a
host of other well-known everyday products
likewise benefit through the accentuation
of their flavor characteristics by Dow aro-
matic chemicals.
These interesting products, resulting from
Dow's rich background of knowledge and
experience in advanced chemical re-
search, represent a promising phase of
Dow's varied program of chemical develop-
ment and production.

This year's engineering seniors are
proud to have a very versatile girl in
their company. It is only by chance that
Virginia Frey is with this college. Before
coming to Michigan, she attended De
Vilbiss High School in Toledo, Ohio and
also studied at the Toledo Museum of
Art for six years (while attending gram-
mar and high school). She had also be-
come an accomplished musician with the
violin, viola and double bass. "Ginny"
was very interested in physics, mathe-
matics and art. Consequently she asked
Ira M. Smith if he could suggest a good

Ginny Frey
school for her to attend. He sent her to
Dean A. H. Lovell and soon "Ginny"
was showing her ability in electrical en-
gineering.
She has always tried to be a good fel-
low and good engineer. Once during an
M.P. 2 laboratory period, working with
smaller tools, she burned herself with a
hot piece of steel and told the fellows
that it happened while using a curling
iron.
Academically speaking, she is an hon-
orary member of Tau Beta Pi and as
freshman was a member of Alpha
Lambda Delta (which is the women's
equivalent of Phi Eta Sigma).
"Ginny" has other campus interests.
She is well known in the Michigan
League for she has served on various
committees. Among these have been
committees for Theater Arts, the Frosh
Project, Soph Project, Merit System, So-
cial Committee and was Scenery Chair-
man for the Junior Girl's Play. Along
athletic lines, she is a member of the
women's golf team and also belongs to
the Pitch and Putt Club. This year, she
is functioning as president for Mortar
Board (which is the campus honorary
society for senior women).
She has taken courses in the Literary
and Art colleges and is as well known in
those schools as she is to us. The pur-
pose of studying in various schools on
campus has been to secure a broad edu-
cation which she feels is essential for a
woman engineer.
At home in Chi Omega, "Ginny" re-
flects on her training and plans for a fu-
ture. It is a very pleasant future for she
intends to fix her interest in the design
of lighting for the home. Perhaps she
will be a consultant in this field some
day. We believe that she will be as suc-
cessful and as well liked as we knew her
in Ann Arbor, no matter what she may
pursue later in life.
bridger
James Harlan Cissel, Professor of
Structural Engineering, graduated from
Purdue in 1910 as a civil engineer. Ever
since that time he has been connected
with work on bridges and other struc-
tures. VJpon graduating, he obtained a
job with the Bridge Dept. of the Kansas
City Terminal Railroad. At this time he
worked on the development of the Union
Station and on the building of a com-
plete new entry into Kansas City
which necessitated building many street
bridges. In 1915 he was associated in
appraisal work with M.E. Cooley in Ann
Arbor, and in this same year he joined
the faculty of the Engineering College.
At the present time, in addition to his
work on the faculty, he serves as an in-
dependent consultant.
During the period from 1933-36, Prof.
Cissel was on leave of absence from the
College and served as a bridge designer
for the Michigan State Highway Dept.
It was during this time that the Cooley
Bridge, located between Cadillac and
Manistee, was built by the Highway De-
partment and this bridge received an
award as being the most beautiful of its
type built in 1934.

Prof. Cissel
Prof. Cissel has also been associated
with the Mackinac Straits Authority and
has done consultation work on the ques-
tion of building a bridge over the Mack-
inac Straits. The proposed bridge over
the Mackinac Straits was to be similar
to the Tacoma Bridge in the state of
Washington and Prof. Cissel was rather
doubtful of the merits of such a bridge.
When the Tacoma Bridge did collapse,
Prof. Cissel's predictions were borne
out and he became somewhat of a pro-
phet.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


A SHORTER WAY TO LONGER LIFE
Spinning furiously in a bath of fire, gears that will
play a vital part in the nation's production are given
longer, more useful, more productive life ... in a hurry.
Through the swift magic of the oxy-acetylene flame, not
only gears, but a host of other metal parts and articles
can have their wearing surfaces hardened . . . exactly
where hardness is needed to resist wear.
This is something new in metal working. The secret of it is that
heat is applied so quickly and with such precise control . . . and
quenching follows so rapidly . . . that any piece so treated has no
chance to become hardened all the way through. This means that
valuable properties like toughness and ductility are retained in
the core of the metal.
The ad\antages of oxy-acetylene flame-hardening arc manifold. By
its use, hardening can be localized to those areas where wear will
occur. Thus one section of a shaft, or the rim of a wheel, or the
teeth of a gear can be hardened, leaving the rest of the piece in its
original condition for needed properties or easy working. Cheaper
and more plentiful ferrous metals can often be made to do the
work of less readily obtainable steels.
The method is lightning fast, so it saves on operating expenses.
Some pieces) can be hardened in as little as five seconds. Production
is speeded up as costs go down. In many cases, machines can be
simplified in construction by the use of flame-hardened parts.
Materials which can be flame-hardened include dozens of plain
carbon, chromium, manganese, nickel, chromium-nickel, chromium-
molybdenum and chromium-vanadium steels. High strength cast iron
and pearlitic malleable iron can also be hardened by this method.
Linde supplies the oxy-acetylene equipment, also the oxygen and
acetylene for U6e in the flame-hardening process. Inquiries about
oxy-acetylene flame-hardening, (lame-cutting, fabricating, and treat-
ing of metals are cordially invited.
• • •
The important developments in flame-hardening — and other proc-
esses and methods for producing, fabricating, and treating metals
— which hare been made by The Linde Air Products Company were
greatly facilitated by collaboration with Union Carbide and Carbon
Research Laboratories, Inc., and by the metallurgical experience of
Electro Metallurgical Company and Haynes Stellite Company — all
Units of Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation.

did collapse, he said that in the design-
ing of the bridge all precedents had been
discarded and consequently the builders
were not perfectly sure how the bridge
would behave. Instead of having the
conventional ratio of length to width
35:1, the Tacoma Bridge had the pro-
portions of 75:1. Up to the present time
bridge designers have had no definite in-
formation on the behavior of such a
long narrow bridge and consequently
there is a need for investigation in this
field. Prof. Cissel believes that an in-
vestigation of suspension bridges in gen-
eral will be sponsored by the govern-
ment in the near future and he hopes that
some of this work might be carried on
here at Michigan.

An engaging grin, a powerful back-
stroke, a clever engineer. What do these
things add up to, why, Dick Riedl, of
course. Dick is another one of these Buf-
falo boys who seems to go places in
Michigan.
He was born 21 years ago and he says
ruefully, just right for the Army. He will
be registering on February 16 and he
hopes that the leniency of his draft
board will permit him to finish school.
Dick is on the Varsity swimming

Richard J. Riedl
team. He swims the 150 yard backstroke
and the medley relay. Last year he
placed second in Big Ten competition.
He attributes his coming to Michigan
to various attractions, chief among them
the good engine school and the renown
of Matt Mann and his swimmers.
Dick has always wanted to be an en-
gineer. Drawing and math appealed to
him and he considered engineering his
chosen field. However, he scoffs at these
people who at an early age take down
motors and putter in general, for no ap-
parent reason. He doesn't consider such
things essential qualifications for a good
engineer.
Dick is a mechanical engineer and ex-
pects to graduate next January. Tf his
draft board can see eye to eye with him,
Dick would like to get into a small busi-
ness with his brother. He feels that with
all the war deflation and surplus of en-
gineers that there's going to be, a man
that is his own boss will be the best off.
Dick's prominence on the Michigan
campus has gained him recognition and
honors. In 1940 he was elected to Tri-
angles, junior honorary engineering so-
ciety, and this year he was chosen for
Vulcans, the highest campus honor an
engineer may receive. Our prediction is
that a fellow with all that Dick Riedl
shows, will go far.

device. The magnet of the present ma-
chine is only five feet long, three feet
high, and two feet wide. The present
machine in the GE labs weighs about
four tons. The pole faces of the two
electro-magnets are 19 inches in diam-
eter.
A doughnut-shaped glass vacuum tube
between the poles of the electro-magnet
is the heart of the rheotron. Electrons
emitted from a hot filament are whirled
around the tube and steadily acceler-
ated by electromagnetic forces until they
attain speed closely approaching that of
light. The electrons travel along a circu-
lar path for about 400,000 revolutions,
receiving as much as 70 volts push each
time around, and travel some 200 miles
in a small fraction of a second to gain
a speed within one tenth of one percent
of that of light. The radiation that can
be produced by allowing the electrons to
collide with a metal target is equal to
that of more than 1000 grams of ra-
dium.
Since the magnet is designed for use
on alternating current, it is made of lam-
inated silicon steel, instead of being of
solid iron as in the cyclotron. The rheo-
tron seems to have no limit, and its ef-
fective voltage can apparently be in-
creased indefinitely. Electrons have al-
ready been given sufficient velocity to
penetrate an inch of aluminum.
metallizer
A problem which has received con-
siderable attention from engineers is one
of protecting the exterior surfaces of
aluminum alloy aircraft engine compon-
ents from corrosion. The most common
method is that of painting, but even the
best of paints have a limited resistance
to salt spray. Moreover, such a process
is quite slow since both a priming and
finishing coat must be applied and both
of these must be baked for a consider-
able time.
The solution to the problem seems to
be the introduction of the metallizing
process in which pure molten aluminum,
which is highly resistant to corrosion, is
sprayed on the parts. At first, this sys-
tem afforded many difficulties. A slow
hand process was used and then a me-
chanical means of application was de-
vised. This method consisted of a power
driven turntable equipped with a hy-
draulic jack and as the table rotated
and rose the coat was sprayed on by a
mounted spray gun. But even this
method required 18 minutes for each
cylinder. Of course, this slow method
could not satisfy the demand brought
about by the increased armament pro-
gram and consequently an improved
method was required. Now, an automa-
tic cleaning and spraying device is used
which is capable of producing one fin-
ished part every 75 seconds.
The parts are loaded at the first sta-
tion where they are properly supported
and centered and then the machine in-
dexes them to the next station where,
as the part rotates, a single spray gun
passes up the cylinder at one angle and
down at another spraying the fin sur-
faces. The next index brings the part
in front of two such spray guns which
are mounted at fixed opposing angles
and these spray the upper and lower fin
surfaces of the cylinder. At the third
station two more guns are set at still a
different angle. Following this, the up-
per head surface is sprayed manually
and then the part is finally removed and
inspected.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


For a long time we've sought a word to de-
scribe what we all work at hard here at Alcoa.
It takes a very special word to describe
making aluminum cheap, making it versatile,
finding totally new places to use it, and then
helping people use it where they should. In
war times it takes a very special word indeed
to describe, also, the ingenuity and daring that
can make, almost overnight, three and four
and five times as much aluminum as was ever
made before, and make it cheaper than ever.
IMAGINEERING is the word. What alumi-
num did for civilians, what aluminum is doing
for our armed forces, what aluminum will do
in the future, all come out of that one word.
Imagineering is letting your imagination
soar, and then engineering it down to earth.
At Alcoa we have engineers with almost every
kind of diploma, scientists with almost every
"key" we know. Yet whatever career they fol-
low with us, their real field is Imagineering.
They work at it hard. They get results. The
importance of aluminum is their own doing.
We at Alcoa would like nothing better than
that our company be known everywhere as the
place they do Imagineering.

ATTENTION FRESHMEN
NOW that the second semester has
finally arrived all freshmen who
have completed a satisfactory first se-
mester scholastically are eligible for any
and all activities.
Why participate in activities and what
activities shall I try out for? These are
questions a freshman may ask himself as
the various organizations on campus be-
gin to look for new men to fill sophomore
positions next year.
The question "Why participate in ac-
tivities?" is easily answered. In fact
there are a multitude of reasons for such
extra-curricular participation. Probably
one of the major reasons for a student
working on some activity is the person-
ality growth derived from such work.
Most activities require the acceptance of
responsibility on the part of the student.
Decisions must be made and the re-
sponsibility for those decisions is taken
by the student.
If a student is to work his way up to
the top in his chosen activity he must
also develop the quality of leadership.
The ability to get along with one's asso-
ciates and to give them the clear think-
ing and good judgment necessary in any
job, in school or out on the job after
graduation, is of prime importance in the
search for success. The student must be
able to sell himself and his ideas to other
men.
The participation in activities pro-
vides this personality growth so im-
portant to the success of a student after
he gets out into the business world. That
is why the interviewers on college cam-
puses investigate not only the scholastic
record of their prospective engineering
employees, but also the record of their
extra-curricular activities. Employers
feel that, on the whole, students who
have taken part in some form of activ-
ity—publications, technical societies,
sports, etc.—are likely to be more valu-
able employees than those who, with a
similar scholastic record, have not taken
part in any activity.
Here it might be well to inject a note
of warning. There can be "too much of
a good thing." There have been stu-
dents in the past and there will be stu-
dents in the future who are able to
participate in several major activities
and still maintain a good scholastic aver-
age. If you are one of those students
more power to you. However, this type
of student is rare and it is, in our
opinion, the better part of wisdom to
enter into one major activity and devote
all the time you can reasonably spare to
making a success of your participation
in that activity. A major activity is not
necessarily the most important one in
the school, according to our definition,
but it is one that takes a goodly amount
of work and requires the acceptance of
responsibility.
"What activity shall I try out for?"
This question is considerably harder to
answer than the first one. Here, we be-
lieve that it is mostly up to you. What
do you like to do? Are you an "organi-
zer?" Then you will probably work well
on the Engineering Council. Class repre-
sentatives and representatives of the
various engineering societies are elected
each year to serve on the Council.
Are you interested in both technical
subjects and journalism? Then it would
be well worth your while to try out for
the Technic. Both the Engineering
Council and the Technic also offer you
excellent opportunities for establishing
new contacts with your fellow students,
members of the faculty, and men in in-
dustry.
And you will very probably belong to
the technical society of your department
of study. The A.S.M.E., A.I.E.E.,
I.Ae.S., S.A.E., A.I.Ch.E., A.I.M.E.,
A.O.A., and A.S.C.E. all have student
chapters active on this campus. In addi-
tion, there are such organizations as the
Glider Club and Flying Club.
It would be almost impossible to go
into the activities available on the cam-
pus as a whole. Some of you will try out
for sports, either as players or as mana-
gers. Others will find an outlet for their
musical talents in the various musical
organizations on campus. In the past,
the student government body of the
Michigan Union has attracted several
engineers each year.
We have attempted to help you in the
solution of this perennial problem of
"Why and what?" We firmly believe
that participation in some student ac-
tivity will pay you rich dividends in per-
sonality development and new friends.
We just as firmly believe that the aver-
age student is fully capable of "getting
in over his head." Think it over. Figure
out how much extra-curricular work you
can take on without seriously affecting
your scholastic standing, select the ac-
tivity your are most interested in, and
give it all you've got.

The Department of Mechanism and Engineering D-awing occupies tdc crtirc long hallway of the fourth floor of West Engi-
neering Building. It has nine combined recitation and drawing rooms, five office rooms, a library, model room, storage, fil-
ing, and shipping room for drawing exercise sheets, a wood working shop, research laboratory, and the University's Blue
Printing facilities. The Department staff of eleven teach the three subjects of the total course in the graphical language of
the engineer. Engineering Drawing, together with special courses for Business Administration, Dentistry, and Engineering-
Law. The Department assists all of the ten junior Colleges of the State with course outlines, charts, and exercise sheets: It
provides such service also for all of the Junior Colleges of Chicago, and numerous colleges in other States; California. New
Mexico. Montana. North Dakota, Missouri, and New York.
The total enrollment in the various subjects of Engineering Drawing is approximately seven hundred each semester.
Classes arc limited insofar as possible to from fifteen to twenty students and the methods of visual education arc applied
to the limit of their utility. Of necessity the major portion of the students' time is devoted to the acquisition of a thor-
ough working mastery of the language of Engineering Drawing. Modern engineering methods have rendered the one-time
Art of Engineering Drawing relatively obsolete.

With a yo-day deadline, replacements were out ot the

During the next twelve months 10,-
000,000 men will be hired or other-
wise diverted to war manufactures. Of
this number, 2,000,000 will be inexper-
ienced workers and 3,000,000 will be
diverted from non-essential industries.
Thus the nation will be faced with the
problem of training 5,000,000 new men
in one year.
By the end of 1943 we will employ
23,500,000 on war work alone, or double
average employment in all manufactur-
ing industries. With a 6,000,000 man
army to further deplete the manpower,
together with 29,400,000 absolute mini-
mum for essential civilian occupations
(50 per cent below 1940 averages) it
will all add up to the fact that 4,000,000
women eventually must be drafted for
factory and commercial work. Dating
the welder at Lockheed will indeed be-
come a reality.
. . . The recent Jap sub raid on the
West Coast oil field caused a total dam-
age of $500, or $20 per five-inch shell.
... A new dye has been developed for
making "Blackout" clothing. The cloth
is visible as a phosphorescent glow in
ultraviolet light during a blackout.
... In the short space of one week, a
portion of the world's largest auto body
plant recently changed over from car
bodies to assembling hulls for medium
tanks.
. . . As evidence that every available
tool in the country is being put to work
as rapidly as possible, WPB offers some
samples: An old planer that smoothed
decks for the Civil War ironclad vessel
"Monitor" is turning out orders for its
fourth war. Lathes that worked on the
Monitor's engines are still in use. A ver-
tical boring mill that built pumps and
machinery for the Civil War and the

Spanish American War is now planing
castings for a Navy dry-dock, and a
steam hammer that thrilled visitors at
the 1893 Columbia Exposition has been
put back to work.
... A new process has been developed
whereby armor plate up to two inches
thick can be welded almost automati-
cally. It will be used to produce the new
all welded medium tank, the M-4. Other
features of the tank: cast hull, lower sil-
houette, turret mounted 75 mm gun, die-
sel rather than airplane engine and less
vulnerable placement of ammunition.
. . . One of the largest iron ore deposits
in the Eastern United States located in
the Adirondacks, containing an esti-
mated 90,000,000 tons of magnetite and
ilmenite is now being used to produce
the strategic metal titanium. The de-
posit has not been worked since 1858,
when the production of wrought iron
was abandoned partly because the crude
methods of that day were unable to re-
move the now valuable titanium from
the ore.
. . . Though figures are very scarce, it
is known that Japanese chemical indus-
try has made tremendous expansions in
the past five years, in many cases as
much as 25 per cent in a single year.
Abundance of hydroelectric power, raw
materials and cheap Chinese labor (even
cheaper than Jap labor) have enabled
her to reach a capacity approximating
our own normal production in such com-
modities as ammonia and nitric acid.
Unfortunately, production is centralized
in small areas easily accessible from the
air. (Continued on page 6)

. . . Without a great deal of publicity,
the Auto Industry is performing a tre-
mendous job of converting to war
orders. The government is asking these
companies to produce at an annual rate
of 24 times their peak 1941 month. Not
only is this expected to be achieved by
the end of this year, but the three larg-
est auto industries will be producing at
the rate of 10^4 billions annually—2Yi
times their normal peak. In one plant,
which has 65 acres under one roof,
three-fourths of the space will be com-
pletely retooled for new war produc-
tion, the one-fourth is used producing
military trucks. In the engine plant of
this factory, normally capable of turning
out 6,000 motors daily, 95 per cent of
the machinery is useless for war produc-
tion.
... By April 15 United States ship-
yards will be producing at the rate of
two ships per day. By the end of this
year the number will have been stepped
up to three ships daily. Cargo ships will
soon be turned out in 105 days from
keel laying to delivery.

Civilian consumption is no problem how-

She has done without imports of tin

the use of the metal for chemical equip-

it with cadmium and lead in solder and
other alloys. Antimony shortages have
been relieved by captured Yugoslav
production.
Tungsten shortages are still unsolved,
synthetic resins have unsatisfactorily re-
placed Tung oil, and glycerin is synthe-
sized from sugar, molasses and wood.
One of the most acute shortages has
been in industrial diamonds, which
shortage has forced the use of valuable
gem diamonds.

(one for each cylinder) are so con-
nected to the commutator (shown just
below them) that they are successively
switched into circuit as needed. (The
arrangement shown is practically that
used in the Ford Model T for many
years, but Ford usually took his cur-
rent from an alternating current mag-
neto and did not use a battery.) The
cut-out is shown at the right. As soon
as the generator (G) was rotating fast
enough, current passed through the coil
(C) and the switch closed. The charg-
ing current from the generator passed
through coils 26 and 27 and pulled
the switch closed more firmly, but when
the generator slowed down and the cur-
rent reversed, coils D and E acted in
opposition to C and caused the switch
to open. A light spring (not shown)
could be adjusted to cause the switch
to close at the proper voltage.
At first sight, the shunt wound gen-
erator of Riker's patent looks like a
very poor choice. If used without a
battery a shunt wound generator giving
6 volts at 8 m.p.h. would rise to about
40 volts at 40 m.p.h. Connected to a
battery the rise would be much less but
still too much. However, the current in
the armature tends to weaken the mag-
netic field and consequently reduces the
voltage. By using many turns on the
armature and by moving the brushes
ahead this armature reaction can be
greatly increased and the current limited
to any desired value.
It is a peculiar fact that Riker does
not mention the possibility of operating
electric lights from his battery, although
it could obviously be done. There are
perhaps two reasons for this. The
demand for night illumination was not
great in 1902, as practically no one used
cars at night. Moreover, the tungsten
lamp had not yet been invented and the
carbon filament lamps were very fragile
and consumed at least three times as
much current as the lamps we now have.
As late as 1910, I operated cars with
only oil lamps and did not feel the need
for anything better. What you have
never known you do not miss.
Riker's system was no mere "paper"
invention. It is fully described in Dyke's
"Anatomy of the Automobile" edition
of 1908 and was used on the Loco-
mobile, a well known and costly car of
the period. Fortunately at least one of
Riker's generators and its cut-out has
been preserved and I have had an op-
portunity to examine and test it. It was
built in accordance with the patent spe-
cifications and an actual test showed
that current never exceeded five amp-
eres, no matter what the speed.
In the early days of the automobile,
all engines were cranked by hand and
nobody complained. Engines were small,
gasoline was all high test, and there
were no women drivers; but about 1908
the demand for some kind of a starting
device grew and many inventors tackled
the problem. Spring starters were tried
with little success. When the engine was
running it wound the spring which could
then spin the engine, once. Unfortun-
ately, once was frequently not enough.
Large gas engines were (and still are)
started with compressed air and at least
one car (the Winton) used an air
starter. Another plan was to admit a
little acetylene gas to the cylinders and
explode it with a spark. This sometimes
worked if the cylinder was not cracked
by the explosion.
The simplest and perhaps the most
reliable starter was used by some of the
fire engine companies. The station was
built with the floor sloping toward the
street and the fire engine was backed
in. To start, it was merely necessary to
release the brakes, put her in high gear,
and as soon as she was rolling, let in the
clutch. Most private drivers, however,
had to use the good old reliable "Arm-
strong" starter.
Of course many inventors had thought
of using an electric motor to start the
engine but again the tendency of the
human mind to travel in a rut, stopped
progress. A battery of the size com-
monly used today was (and is) rated at
80 ampere-hours, meaning that you
could take 10 amperes from it for 8
hours. Buyers of such batteries were
warned not to exceed this discharge rate.
A few simple experiments and a little
elementary engineering showed that at
the instant of start about 300 amperes
would be needed and about 100 amperes
to keep the engine turning (this is on
the basis of a 6 volt battery as now
used). Right here most inventors quit.
The idea of taking 300 amperes from a
battery nominally rated at 10 amperes
was absurd, and a battery capable of
giving this output at a reasonable dis-
charge rate would weigh entirely too
much. Just what inventors thought
would happen if one did abuse a battery
this way is hard to say. Perhaps it was
thought it would blow up. Apparently
no one tried to find out, but that is
nothing new in human history. Aristotle
taught that the speed of a falling body
is proportional to its weight, and it was
nearly 2000 years before Galileo tried to
find the truth by actually making the
experiment. Of course you know what
happened to Galileo when he tried to
climb out of this "rut".
This attitude of mind was not con-
fined to the inventors. It is a fact that
one inventor wrote to a prominent man-
ufacturer of storage batteries inquiring
about a battery to deliver enough cur-
rent for an electric starter. The com-
pany replied that their batteries were
not intended to deliver any such current
and could not be so used. The inventor
came right back with an order for one,
saying he would take all the risks. The
company replied that they would not
sell a battery for any such fool scheme
and it is a fact that the inventor was
forced to buy a battery through a third
party. Today this same company is
building many thousands of starting
batteries every day and is very glad to
have the business.
Not all inventors, however, were dis-
couraged and among them none deserve
more credit than another forgotten geni-
us, J. A. Heany. On July 28 and August
1, 1910, applications were filed for two
remarkable patents which were finally
issued eight years later (numbers 1,287,-
988 and 1,287,989). Fig. 2 shows the
first of these and is probably the simp-
lest starting, lighting and ignition sys-
tem ever invented.
A single machine (A) was used both
as a motor to start the engine and as a
generator to charge the battery. It was
geared so that it turned about three
times as fast as the engine. As shown,
it was compound wound, the connections
being such that the series and the shunt
windings both helped to magnetize the
field when the machine was functioning
as a motor. This gave a strong field
and consequently a powerful starting
torque. As soon as the engine began to
operate under its own power, the voltage
generated by the armature increased
and at all usual speeds became greater
than that of the battery. The current of
course reversed in the armature and
series field B (but not in the shunt
field C) and thus charged the battery.
The possible current the machine could
generate was strictly limited since the
product of the current and the number
of turns in the series field could never
be so great as the product of the current
and turns in the shunt field. It was thus
inherently self-regulating and gave near-
ly a constant charging current for all
speeds above a few miles per hour. (In-
cidentally, the "bucking field" genera-
12

used in the laboratories of the Univer-
sity of Michigan as early as 1898 but
no attempt had been made to patent it.)
The patent shows a non-stalling sys-
tem since, if the engine slowed down too
much, the current through the armature
close one switch which connected the
starter to the battery and also turned on
the ignition.
The ignition shown by Heany is of
the so-called circuit type practically
identical with that used today and far
in advance of the "buzzer" system
(JQHOJ)

-mmr-

Figure 2. Heany's ignition system
and series field reversed and the machine
automatically became a motor and kept
the engine turning. In practice, switches
d and f were usually connected mechan-
ically so that to start the engine it was
merely necessary to operate one lever.
This system, almost exactly as shown in
the Heany patent, was used on a num-
ber of cars, among them the Dodge
and Franklin. In fact I drove a Franklin
with this system in the West about 1920
and found it operated very well. To start
the engine it was merely necessary to
shown by Riker. Heany secured several
patents upon this ignition system but
lack of space precludes discussion of
them here.
One objection to the single unit sys-
tem is that the power required to crank
the engine is many times that which
the machine should develop as a genera-
tor. At the instant of start the current
may be 300 amperes, which drops to per-
haps 100 amperes while the engine is
being cranked. As soon as the engine
runs under its own power the current
should reverse and should be limited to
10 or 15 amperes. This high ratio of
20 or 30 to one between motor and gen-
erator action made the design very dif-
ficult. Moreover, it was impracticable to
use a gear ratio of more than about
three to one which meant that the
machine as a motor, must generate a
large starting torque and consequently
must be large and heavy. The design
was therefore a compromise and the
result was a machine which was not very
good either as a generator or as a motor.
I designed a great many of them and
while they were successful on small en-
gines, the difficulties became greater as
engines became larger and more power-
ful. To give you an idea of the change
which has taken place in the size of en-
gines, one of the early Franklin cars
had an engine rated at 16 horsepower
but the makers claimed it frequently
developed 24 horsepower. At that time
most people thought that since two
horses could (and frequently had to)
draw an automobile, surely 24 horse-
power was enough for anyone. Today
even a small car has an engine develop-
ing 80 horsepower or more.
In Fig. 3 illustrating the Heany pat-
ent No. 1,287,989 is shown a two unit
system which is essentially the one used
today on practically all cars. Here we
have a series wound motor, 20, whose
only function is to start the engine. It is
geared to the latter with a reduction of
around 20 to one and drives through a
simple roller clutch, so that when the
engine starts it cannot drive the motor.
If allowed to do so it would of course
wreck the motor. The battery is charged
by a compound wound generator, 16,
which is geared to the engine in a con-
stant ratio. To start the engine, switch
22 is closed and 25 is thrown on the
lower contact and as soon as the engine
has started is moved to the upper con-
tact, thus disconnecting the starting
motor and connecting the generator to
the battery.
The only important way in which this
differs from a modern system is that we
use an automatic cut out (such as is
shown in the Riker patent) to connect
the generator to the battery when the
generator is rotating fast enough. Heany
relied upon the fact that when the igni-
tion was cut off by opening switch 22
the generator was also disconnected.
However, the battery could discharge
through the generator if the engine
speed was very low. The ignition sys-
tem is practically that used today and
the battery, except for minor improve-

roller clutch asembly for starting was
used for many years on the Studebaker
and probably other cars, but has now
been largely superseded by the Bendix
gear, which accomplishes the same pur-
pose in a different way.
Although Heany's application was in
the Cadillac car would be equipped with
electric starting and lighting. A full de-
scription may be found in the Horseless
Age of September 6, 1911. The patent
upon which it was based was applied
for by C. F. Kettering, April 17, 1911,
but was not isued until five years later,
as No. 1,171,055.

Figure 3. Heany's second patent
the patent office in 1910, apparently his
system was not used commercially until
some years later. The application was
in the office eight years and was there-
fore not available to the public or other
inventors. One of the serious defects of
our patent system is that an inventor
may work for years on an invention
which is already covered by an applica-
tion slumbering peacefully in the patent
office. Heany was granted several other
patents, two applied for in 1910, one in
1917 and one in 1918. These covered
details of his system, particularly the
ignition, but cannot be discussed here.
In August, 1911, the motoring public
was startled by the announcement that
This patent includes 18 pages of
printed matter and 19 illustrations, and
describes a system that is exceedingly
complicated as compared with Heany's
simple solution. Kettering of course did
not have access to Heany's application
and presumably knew nothing about his
work. Only one machine was used both
as motor and as generator. It had both
shunt and series coils, but only the
series winding was used when starting.
When generating, it was connected as a
differentially compound generator.
The battery consisted of 12 cells, con-
nected in series to give 24 volts for
starting and re-connected with three
cells in series and four such sets in
parallel, giving six volts during normal
operation. The use of 24 volts of course
greatly increased the torque developed
by the motor. To give still more torque,
the motor operated through a train of
gears with a reduction of about 20 to
1. By means of roller clutches it was
impossible for the engine after it had
started to drive the generator through
these gears, but other clutches operated
to allow the engine to drive the genera-
tor at approximately engine speed.
Elaborate precautions were taken to
prevent overcharging the battery. As
stated, the generator was differentially
compounded and in addition the series
field was shunted by a fine iron wire
which forced more current through the
series field when it became hot. As a
further precaution, an ampere-hour me-
ter was connected in the circuit. This
operated somewhat like the meters used
in our homes, rotating in one direction
while the battery was charging and in
the opposite direction when it dis-
charged. If charging continued long
enough, resistance was automatically cut
into the shunt field; later still more
resistance was added and finally the
generator was entirely disconnected from
the battery, when the latter was fully
charged. Discharge of the battery had
of course the opposite effect. In later
models the regulation of the generator
was accomplished by means of a resis-
tance wire in the shunt field circuit,
dipping into a mercury bath, the amount
of immersion being controlled by a sole-
noid. Compared with modern practice
this was very complicated, and if the
system had been poorly built it would
not have lasted more than a few miles.
Let us give full credit to those who de-
signed and built it so well that it ac-
tually worked.
After a couple of years the system
was greatly simplified. A three cell, 6
volt, battery was used instead of the 12
cell battery, and the armature of the
motor-generator had two windings and
two commutators, one winding of heavy
wire being used for starting, and both
in series when running. Other improve-
ments were made and the system was
applied to other cars. About 1917 the
double unit system was introduced and
is now universally used.
By about 1920 all cars were electri-
cally started and lighted. Electric igni-
tion systems had gone through a peculiar
cycle. At first the current was furnished
by primary cells. Then came magnetos,
either alone or in combination with bat-

ANALYSIS
By
ALLEN D. CHRISTIAN, '42E
THE position of the stress analyzer is
becoming more important every
day. With the continual demand to save
on raw materials the question of neces-
sary weight is one of the foremost is-
sues in manufacturing. At the present
time there is a great demand for engi-
neers well grounded in stress analysis.
This is especially true in the aircraft in-
dustry, where weight is of prime impor-
tance.
The aeronautical engineer is largely
responsible for the present developments
in the methods of handling complicated,
so-called indeterminant structures, flat
plates, and curved sheets. An inde-
terminant structure may be defined as
one which cannot be analyzed by the
equations of statics. Before the advance
of the airplane, the methods of deter-
mining the loads in indeterminant struc-
tures were usually approximate to some
degree because the problem of weight
was not important enough to make long,
cumbersome calculations necessary. Ex-
perience was used as a strong leaning
post. In the airplane, however, experi-
ence is still quite limited concerning
many structural problems. Design is
changing so rapidly that the engineers
face many problems today with little or
no past experience.
Flat plates have been used for many
years in various types of structures, but
not until the airplane did the engineer
encounter the problem of thin flat sheets
carrying comparatively heavy loads. To
add a still more difficult problem, thin
curved sheets were introduced to replace
fabric covered wings and fuselages. The
air loads carried by transports and high
speed military planes required metal sur-
faces. In the present emergency our en-
gineers are required to produce faster
and stronger planes than our enemies.
In order to do this, and do it as inexpen-
sively as we can, the stresses in each
item, no matter how trivial, must be
carefully calculated. It is easy to obtain
the required strength in a member, but
often very difficult to keep the total
weight low enough to make the plane
fulfill the military requirements, which
include high speed and extreme man-
euverability. It is obvious that a heavy
plane will not be as capable of fulfilling
these requirements as a light plane. The
the truth that no field of engineering is
independently responsible for advance-
ment.
At the present time there are two lead-
ing theories used in the analysis of in-
determinate structures. These are elastic
stability and elastic energy. The first
is based on the idea that a body under
elastic deformation is stable and any
part of the body is stable due to internal
forces. The second theory is built on
the fundamental idea of all mechanics,
whether static or dynamic, which is that
the total amount of energy cannot be
destroyed. In the use that we are inter-
ested in, it is said that the energy put
into a structure by the forces acting on
it is either stored in the structure or
does work on something else. The
method of analysis involves the storing
of energy in a member by particular,
hypothetical forces. These forces are
then canceled out and the forces from
the actual loading remain.
The first of these methods is much
more commonly used because it is the
best established of the two, but the sec-
ond method is rapidly broadening in
its application because it is more easily
applied to the complicated structures of
modern design. Again, the airplane is
responsible for the increased use of the
second method due to its unusual con-
struction.

Elastic stability? .
problem of compromising between
strength and weight is the job of the
stress analyzer.
At this point we should stop to give
credit to the metallurgist who works
along with the stress engineer in at-
tempting to produce lighter and stronger
alloys. This is just another example of
elastic energy?
Vultee
The theory of flat plates and curved
sheets is by no means as well developed
as the methods of analyzing frame struc-
tures. At the present time the theory of
elastic stability is the most advanced in
development. The problem of the thin
flat plate is quite satisfactorily solved

A familiar figure in the basement of
the East Engineering Building is that of
A. C. Edgerton who is in charge of the
instrument room of the Aero Depart-
ment. Usually he can be found working
on a project for one of the professors or
getting equipment ready for some type
of specialized work.
Mr. Edgerton has been working with
the Aero Department for the past eight
years and he has found the association
quite a pleasant one. In 1933, when he
happened to be in Ypsilanti without a
job, he discovered that the University
needed mechanics so he decided to try
his hand at the job. He was placed with
the Aero Department and he has been
with them up to the present time.
When Mr. Edgerton first came to
work for the Aeros, he didn't know much
about the type of work he was going to
do but he learned very rapidly. After
a year or so, the students gave him the
name "Doc" and he has been called that
ever since. On first coming here he found
that the metal and wood-working shops
of the Aero Department were in one
small room which, as he says, "was
crammed full of junk." Prof. Stalker
gave him full sway over the instrument
room and under "Doc" it has been im-
proved and expanded a great deal.
One of the features of his equipment
room is that it is known as the neatest
one on campus. He has built much of
the equipment himself and one of the
best examples of his work is the "Doc-
saw." Formerly, "Doc" had to cut all
his materials by hand because the Aero
Department couldn't afford to buy a
power-driven hacksaw so he proceeded
to build one in his spare time. Along
with this, he has built a saw-table, jig-
saw, and many other instruments which
can be seen all over the East Engineer-
ing Building basement. He has spent a
great deal of time in building mano-
meters and he also has worked on the
improvement of the structures lab. Ori-
ginally the drop-test apparatus in the
lab was equipped with a chain hoist
which was very tedious to operate so
consequently "Doc" designed and built
an air hoist for the apparatus. While
gan working as a machinist 38 years ago
as a bicycle-rim turner. Since that time,
through hard work on his part, he has
become an excellent machinist and mas-
ter mechanic.
Above all, he has always wanted ex-
perience in all types of fields and has
kept moving on after gaining an expert
knowledge of the particular work he was
doing. Consequently, most of his jobs
have lasted five years or so and, as a re-
sult of this experience, he now has no
trouble in handling any of the problems
that may arise in connection with the
building of models or apparatus for the
Aero Department. Most of his experi-
ence has been gained around Michigan.
He was born in Port Huron and he has
almost always managed to "stick
around" here. In 1920 he went out to

"Doc" started on bicycle rims
here all of his work has been done for
the Aero Department with the exception
of a trainer model for Leonard Aircraft
which was subsequently tested in the
wind tunnel here.
Before working here, "Doc" Edgerton
held a great variety of jobs as a me-
chanic and machinist. He is skilled in
both metal and wood-working, and be-
California but after being there for a
time, he found that he preferred Mich-
igan.
On June 16 of this year "Doc" will
be 64, but he still regularly puts in eight
hours a day for the Aero Department.
When he first came to work for the de-
partment he was living in Ypsi and he
still continues to commute.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


By
RICHARD T.LIDDICOAT
Assistant Professor of Engineering Mechanics
THE problem of finding the center
of hydrostatic pressure on a plane
area is seldom presented in a general
way in American text books on hydraul-
ics. The following development is an
outgrowth of the method sometimes
used, namely, that of considering the
plane area as the cross section of a pris-
matical post with an axial load with
either double or single eccentricity. The
problem in hydrostatics is the inverse of
that in strength of materials. In hydro-
statics the line of zero stress and the
stress at the center of the area are given
and the position of the resultant force
or center of pressure is required. In
strength of materials the position of the
resultant is usually given to find the
stress distribution. The following devel-
opment has the advantage of being based
entirely on hydrostatics.
Suppose we have an area in a verti-
cal plane subjected to hydrostatic pres-
sure. (If the plane were inclined it
would not change the problem except to
introduce the same trigonometric func-
tion [sine or cosine] into every term.)
Suppose the principal axes x and y are known and the the moments of inertia for these
axes (which are maximum and minimum for axes through G) are known.
Depth at G below the surface can be given as ~x sin fi or y cos /J. The force on the
increment of area dA (coordinates x, y) is
w (x sin p — y cos ji — x sin fj) dA
(The part in the parentheses is the depth below the water surface.)
The moment of this force about the y axis is
w (Fsin ft — y cos ji — x sin ji) xdA
The moment of all such forces about the y axis will be
2,w (Fsin ft — y cos fi — x sin ji) xdA = wJsin ji XxdA — w cos ji ~2,xydA — w sin /i SrdA
We equate this to the moment of the resultant about the y axis which is wx sin ji • A • xv.
For the principal axes through G the %xydA = 0, and 2,xdA = 0. Expanding out and
dividing:
wxsin ji%xdA — w cos '2,xydA — w sin ji'Ux'dA 0 + 0 -
A
w • x sin ji . A
xA
Similarly yp =
yA
Note that the center of pressure is always deeper than the center of gravity.
If the x axis is parallel to the water surface. T is infinite and the center of pressure
must lie on the y axis.

MACHINES
THE search for a perpetual motion
machine has, along with the Fountain
of Youth and the philosophers' stone,
been relegated for some time to the realm
of the imagination by men of science.
The perpetual motion machine has had
its uses though, for without it, the es-
tablishment of the principle of conser-
vation of energy would have been long
delayed. The perpetual motion machine
has had a long and checkered career.
It has enjoyed the attention of physi-
cists, mathematicians, engineers, philoso-
phers, and crackpots. Such famous
men as Bishop Wilkins, 'sGravesande.

Figure 1. Arm and weight
Bernoulli, Leupold, and Nicholson have
given the opinion that the design of a
perpetual motion machine was possible,
while De la Hire, Papin, Desaguliers,
Stevinus, Leibnitz, and Newton were
just as sure that it was impossible.
The most popular type was the arm-
and-weight machine. It first made its
appearance in the 13th century and
forms of it were still being patented in
1850. As shown in Figure 1, it consisted
of a wheel which had the arms and
weights mounted on its periphery. The
arms were equipped with stops which
permitted them to turn through a 90°
arc. It was claimed that since the right
side of the wheel overbalanced the left,
By
JOHN S. BURNHAM, '42E
it would turn in a clockwise direction.
And since at every quarter turn another
arm would fall out to the right—it
would run forever.
Figure 2 shows one of the neatest
looking machines ever designed. It was
in the form of a U-tube with water in
one column and mercury in the other.
Iron balls (hollow so they will float in
water) are dropped into the right hand
side until a ball is pushed under the bend
in the U and rises to the top of the
water column. A few more balls and the
first one will be rolled out onto the
power wheel. After a short ride on the
power wheel it will drop into the right
hand column and the machine will run
forev—anyway it looked good.
However, not all perpetual motion
machines were thought out with such
care. Witness Figure 3—the rolling ring
that did not roll. In the same class as
the r.r. were such setups as the steam
engine which runs a generator—which

produces current—which powers a heat-
ing coil—which heats water in a boiler—
which runs a steam engine—which, etc.
Also in this class were the magnetic ma-
chines where steel wheels were revolved
by permanent magnets with the aid of
such insulators as wood, quartz, and
horsehair pillows to keep the magnetic

field from acting on certain parts of the
wheel.
To get away from the absolutely im-
plausible, consider the description of the
following machine which might work if
it only had a valve. (Attention Profes-
sor Sherzer.) A continuous chain of
floats is hung on a pulley and placed so
that half of it is in a vertical tank of
water and the other half is in the air.
Since the half in the tank is buoyed up
by the water, it is lighter than the other
half and the chain will turn on the pul-
ley. The only difficulty arises in trying
to design an automatic valve which will
let the air-borne side of the chain enter
the bottom of the tank without losing
any water.
A very simple perpetual motion ma-
chine which had considerable backing,
before the principles of hydrostatics
were thoroughly understood, consisted of
a tank of water with a pipe coming out
of the bottom, up the side, and with its

goody
financier
One man in almost every engineering
graduating class is known as the typical
business executive type. This person,
usually by the common consent of his
classmates, becomes class treasurer, since
previous to that time has has customar-
ily been the business manager of The
Michigan Tkchnic. This year has been
no exception. Bob Imboden, our current
financier, has upheld these traditions not
only in acquisition but also by function-
ing effectively in these two respective
positions.
Coming to the University of Mich-
igan back in 1938 because he considered
FfiHTlNC

Robert L. Imboden
it the best engineering school near his
home in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, he
chose metallurgical engineering as his
field. Since that time organizations like
Triangles, Scabbard and Blade, Engine
Council, Vulcans, and Slide Rule Ball
Committee have successively added his
name to their lists. Yet even more im-
portant than these has been his work on
The Michigan Technic where he be-
gan in the advertising department and
where he continued with sufficient prom-
ise to become the candidate for the busi-
ness manager's position, which he now
holds.
Bob believes that the Michigan grad-
ing system is so inaccurate with refer-
ence to actually evaluating the worth of
a student, that grade-getting is decid-
edly a secondary measure despite the
fact that he has kept near the top of his
class scholastically. The most important
part of his engineering education, ac-
cording to Bob, has been learning how
to operate a slide-rule. By the use of
this instrument, he claims two years are
chopped off the time required to com-
plete the problem work in an engineer-
ing curriculum. Among other things,
Bob is actually teaching classes, that is,
he has been instructing some heat-treat-
ing sections in the freshman metal proc-
essing course.
While at Aberdeen last summer, train-
ing for his Ordnance Corps commission,
he became one of the 'Night Raiders',
a crew of benevolent individuals who
tried to keep the rest of the boys happy
by throwing them into lakes. Also while
at camp, Mr. Imboden upheld his repu-
tation for familiarity with the fairer sex
by dating the Colonel's daughter. He
hopes to work in the Cleveland Ord-
nance District after graduation until the
country no longer needs his services
when he is going into business with two
of his Delta Tau Delta fraternity broth-
ers to develop and produce electropol-
ishing equipment.
His greatest insult occurred last se-
mester when his English prof told him
that he wrote with a Gargoyle style. De-
spite this, Bob Imboden remains the
ambitious and efficient handler of led-
gers and slide rule. He is probably one
of the best natured men in the engine
school, typified by his universal friendly
spirit which no one can deny.
Charles Winfred Good, our present
Assistant Director of the Department of
Engineering Research, is now entering
his twenty-fourth year as a member of
the teaching staff of the Mechanical En-
gineering Department. He was born in
1893, in Saginaw, Michigan and at-
tended high school in Flint. After his
graduation from high school he worked
for a time in the Flint Division of the
Buick Motor Co.
In 1914 he enrolled in the College of
Engineering of the University of Mich-
igan and in 1918 he graduated as a me-
chanical engineer. Upon graduation he
had planned to go into the automotive
industry, but as there was a shortage of
instructors in the mechanical engineer-
ing department at that time, he was of-
fered a position as instructor.
As his career progressed, C. W. Good
began to enjoy teaching more and more,

Prof. Good
and in 1925 he was promoted to an as-
sistant professorship in mechanical engi-
neering. In 1933 he attained his present
position; associate professor of mechan-
ical engineering. In addition to his teach-
ing assignments, in 1923 he assumed the
duties of assistant to Prof. A. E. White,
head of the department of Engineering
Research. In 1936 Prof. Good became
Assistant Director of the department
and remains so today.

contradicted itself
How Westinghouse Engineers straightened out a paradox in steel
TvyTETALLURGISTS have been heat-
.'.*-*. treating steel for 2,500 years. They've
taken steel parts, subjected them to heat,
cooled them quickly by quenching them
in water, oil, or gas, and so hardened them.
But the heat treatment contradicted
itself.
For while they were heat-treating the
steel to harden it. . . they also softened it.
As the steel was being heat-treated, oxy-
gen combined with the surface carbon,
decarburized and softened the surface.
Naturally, metallurgists had to remove
this softened surface. They had to pickle,
grind, or machine the surface—processes

which not only wasted time and cost
money but also accounted for a whole lot
of inefficiency.
The dimensions of many steel parts,
especially dies, have to be accurate to a
few thousandths of an inch. So, metallur-
gists had to make the steel parts larger to
start with, just enough larger so that
they'd be the right size after the softened
surface had been removed. And that left
room for plenty of mistakes.
► Something, Westinghouse engineers de-
cided, should be done to get rid of all this
heat-treating trouble.
They figured the thing to do was to
find a way to keep carbon-hungry oxygen
from getting at the steel surface. And
that was the thing they did.
First, they settled on using an electric
furnace since it would give them accurate
temperature control and entirely elimi-
nate gas fumes. Then, they created a
special atmosphere for the furnace. They
heated ammonia (NH3) in the presence
of a catalyst and separated it into its
component parts, nitrogen and hydrogen.
The nitrogen is inert and won't combine
with anything. The hydrogen, in the ab-
sence of oxygen and water vapor, also
refuses to have anything to do with the
carbon.
In this special atmosphere, which West-
inghouse engineers called Ammogas, steel
parts could be treated with electric heat
and ... no softening of the outer surface
took place, no time-wasting, inefficient
finishing had to be done. The dies and
other steel parts came out of their heat
treatment bright, shiny, all ready to use.
► The Ammogas furnace that Westing-
house engineers created took care of the
heat-treating of costly parts like dies,
which can be gas-hardened and are not
produced in great quantities. But Am-
mogas is expensive—too expensive for

Here is an Ammogas Furnace.
the ordinary heat-treating of thousands
of machine parts. And it is not suitable
for heat-treatments requiring high tem-
peratures.
So Westinghouse engineers developed
Endogas—a special atmosphere which
would do large-quantity, high-tempera-
ture heat-treating jobs, and do them at
low cost. They heated ordinary gas (nat-
ural or manufactured city gas is all right)
and, by a special but inexpensive process,
changed it into a gas rich in hydrogen and
carbon monoxide and containing a little
water vapor and carbon dioxide.
Endogas doesn't do its work by avoid-
ing all decarburizing agents, carbon diox-
ide and water vapor; it overpowers them
by the inclusion of agents like carbon
monoxide and methane that work in the
opposite direction.
In effect, Endogas maintains a balance
between carburizing and decarburizing
forces. This balance can be so closely
controlled that it is even possible to add

carbon to the steel that's being heat-
treated.
Today, the Ammogas and Endogas
furnaces are hard at work heat-treating
dies, castings, airplane parts, steel parts
of all kinds, helping to turn them out
faster and better—saving industry time,
money, and mistakes—speeding crucial
war production.
There is one reason why Westinghouse was
able 10 create controlled atmosphere fur-
naces and lick decarburization. It is because
Westinghouse is an engineer's company.
There are 3,500 engineers in Westing-
house ... in service, in sales, in design, in
research, in management, in every branch of
the business. Engineers hold key positions
in each of the 17 Divisions of the Westing-
house Company.
Engineers determine our ability to find
better ways to get jobs done. Engineers
direct the creation and manufacture of our
products. Upon engineers our success de-
pends.
Behind our training and our encourage-
ment of individual effort, there is a definite
purpose. Behind our organization set-up of
many divisions, which are like small com-
panies within a company, there is a definite
purpose. That purpose is to develop young
engineers like you into the kind of engineers

sharp cookie
As for the qualities of a Casanova,
engineers are somewhat notorious for
lack of same. This particular story con-
cerns one of the more social-minded
pipefitters who found himself, six days
before J-Hop, with the will, the deter-
mination, the OPM-rationed materials,
and (most amazing of all) the necessary
cash, to attend said blowout. But alas,
our engineer lacked the most essential
accouterment—a date. After giving up
the idea of advertising in the Daily's
Want Ads or waving his tickets at the
first passerby, as too undignified for the
profession, our beleaguered hero sudden-
ly remembered a cute little number he
had met once at a President's Tea. Al-

though he did not know her name ,he did
know she was a sophomore, that she
lived in Mosher, and came from Cleve-
land Heights. With the aid of the stu-
dent directory he readily found the girl
answering this description. When he
found she was home for the weekend he
called her long-distance. She accepted
the invitation to J-Hop, although she
couldn't quite place him. As an after-
thought, he got a date with her for the
Thursday night before.
With all the thrills of a jibbering idiot
our hero called for his date on Thurs-
day, whereupon he received the shock
of his life. He had never seen her be-
fore in his life! At last reports the Ann
Arbor cops were dragging the Huron
River for his remains.

And so ends the sad tale of an Engi-
neer who took a blind date to J-Hop.

The day after Professor Pawlowski
shaved off his goatee, the following liter-
ary gem appeared on the Aero bulletin
board. We pass it on to you without
further comment.
Ode to the Disappearance
of a Goatee
Oh! a certain goatee we'll sorely miss;
Why, ah why, has it come to this—
That some 'bargerous' dope let his razor
slip
And ended your days with a single snip?
Or has that dignified, silver fuzz
Been caught in a whirling propellor
buzz?
Cruel the razor that whacked you away!
Truly momentous this eventful day!
We dolefully mourn your disappearance,
But now 'twixt chin and shirt there's
clearance.
Farewell! Farewell! Oh strands of mop!
What the chin has lost—may it grow on
top.
good advice
For a long time we have thought that
the spirit of rivalry was dead.
To our amazement we found out that
in the breast of at least one student there
still burns a spark from the ancient feud
between the engineers and the lawyers.
The evidence was very simple and yet
expressive.
For the safety of wandering engineers
the University has placed the cryptic
statement, "Danger Pipe Shaft," on cer-
tain doors of the East Engineering
Building. On one of these doors some
thoughtful student has written, "Law
Students Walk In," in letters clear, if
not neat.
rationed?
Every year dozens of stories come out
about the latest edition of the J-Hop.
However, we heard one that we think
is typical of one of the experiences that
students undergo in the pursuit of en-
tertainment.
It so happened that two couples of our
acquaintance attended the J-Hop to-
gether. After the dancing and armed
with the all-important student permit,
they drove over to Ypsi in search of
food. (The old story of the grass is
greener on the other side of the fence.)
Not finding any place that appealed to
them they returned to one of the Ann
Arbor hot spots. The order was duly

taken and the foursome settled back to
await the desired refreshments. Time
marched on and the prospects of re-
freshment seemed just as far away as
ever.
After the first half hour it was evi-
dent that patience was not a virtue and
our heroes and heroines began to show a
certain amount of restlessness. A lone
occupant of the booth across the aisle
observed their plight and finally re-
solved to hurdle the barriers of conven-

Speaking of lawyers, we have just
heard that some of the men being trained
as ordnance inspectors are being put up
in the Law Quad. They aren't honest-
to-God engineers, but we'll bet the law-
yers are plenty burned anyway . . . Our
spies in the Gargoyle office tell us that
sales have been slipping lately. Couldn't
be due to those terrificly funny jokes or
those simply uproarious cartoons, could
it? First thing you know the Garg will

SWEEPING STEEL WITH A BROOM OF FLAME
SWEEPING over metal structures and
structural parts this modern broom
of fire prepares metal surfaces for a
long-lasting, protective coat of paint.
It is the Airco Flame Cleaning Process
and removes rust and scale and dehy-
drates metal surfaces as it cleans. It
provides a warm, dry surface condu-
cive to a lasting paint job and assuring
a faster one. Flame cleaning is the most
effective method yet devised to pre-
pare metal surfaces, new and old, for
painting and repainting. Ultimate main-
tenance costs are lower.
Versatile is the oxyacetylene flame.
It provides better and faster ways of
making machines, engines, ships and

tanks by shaping thin steel plates or
heavy slab forgings and structures with
economical ease and with a high de-
gree of accuracy. The oxyacetylene
flame hardens steel to any desired de-
gree and depth. It softens steel, or
bends it, or straightens it. It removes
scale from billets, castings and forgings.

Just three days too late for a Christ-
mas present, the Hammett family wel-
comed an addition on December 28,
1920. The scene was the future stamp-
ing grounds of Fiorello—New York
City. Lawt now calls West Englewood,
N'. J. home, the family having moved
across the river.
Lawt liked math and considered engi-
neering the proper place to use it. He
started in Mechanical Engineering, but
switched to Electrical because he liked
the circuit angle of it. Power transmis-
(Continued from page 20)
sion is his branch, and future plans are
preferably sales or application.
The low tuition in Michigan drew
Lawt here. However, he was headed for
Michigan State until an alumnus gave

Lawton A. Hammett
him a sales talk on Michigan's superi-
ority in engineering, among other things;
so Lawt stopped in Ann Arbor instead
of traveling farther west.
During his first week on the campus
as a freshman, Lawt saw a notice about
an all-campus tennis tournament. He
added his name to the list and subse-
quently won the tournament. Queerly
enough, though, tennis is not the sport
he likes best. After trying just about
all sports, hockey came out as the one
he liked best. However, tennis took less
time than hockey, so Lawt went out
for tennis instead of seeing Coach
Lowrie. As a result, he is now co-cap-
tain of the tennis team.
Before coming to Michigan, Lawt
went to school in the South. He antic-
ipated meeting some new, and southern,
belles there, of course, but the first one
he met told him she heard he was en-
gaged! Lawt got back on the beam here
though, and in his freshman year de-
cided to take Friday and Saturday
nights off for social affairs.
In addition to playing tennis and
other sports, Lawt is kept busy as Presi-
dent of both Sigma Nu and Vulcans.
Also, the Senior Ball Committee, AIEE,
and the M Club include him in their roll
call.
Even tempered and willing to try any-
thing, Lawt claims no philosophy toward
life or school, but merely says, "Four-
teen years of school are enough!"
PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINES

The inventor reasoned that a hundred
pounds of water in the tank would over-
balance a pound of water in the pipe and
must therefore push the water out of the
pipe. Thus circulation would be set up
which would only cease when the water
dried up.
Another machine, almost as popular

Figure 4. Bent-spoke wheel
(Continued from page 18)
as the arm-and-weight type, is shown
in Figure 4. It is said to have been in-
vented by the Marquis of Worcester
(died 1667) who formed a company and
sold stock to the King of England and
most of the court on the basis of this in-
vention. History does not record whether
or not the Marquis died a natural
death.
The third most popular perpetual
motion machine, said to be almost as
old as the arm-and-weight type, is the
water wheel that operated a pump, to
raise water, to operate the wheel, etc.
But now we are getting back to the class
with the steam engine and generator so
let us consider a machine that works—
at any rate no one can point out a good
reason why it shouldn't work.
As illustrated in Figure 5, it was pro-
posed by Sir William Congreve (1772-
1828). An endless band of sponges car-
ried an endless band of weights, the
whole suspended in water on two rollers.
On the left hand side, the sponges soak
up water by capillary action. On the
right, the weights compress the sponges
at the water's edge and squeeze out the
water. Therefore, the left hand side of
the belt is heavier than the right and it
will revolve in a counter-clockwise di-

the face of the principle of conservation
of energy. What is wrong with our rea-

taper borer
At the Fore River Shipbuilding Yard
in Quincy, Massachusetts, a new piece
of special equipment has been devised
for boring the tapered hole in the rud-
ders of cruisers and battleships.
The work is done on a floor type hori-
zontal boring, drilling, and milling ma-
chine with special fixtures attached for
producing eccentricity and a tapered
feed action of the cutting edge. In Fig-
ure 1, notice the counterweight on the
offset bracket for the drive shaft located
near the spindle. This compensates for
the rotating weight of the boring bar
and tool-head.
In Figure 2, the boring head is shown
with a single fly cutter being advanced
into the work by a star feed. This regu-
lar feed provides the means of obtain-
ing a uniform taper.
Also, the boring bar must be provided
with two points of support for rigidity
and accuracy of the eccentric motion.
The spindle and off-center bracket pro-
vide one support while the other point
is made solid by the steady-rest near the
entrance point of the work hole. This
steady-rest is a circular disc with an ad-
justable center bracket for eccentricity,
all running in another cylinder which is
bolted to the machine bed.
By means of these devices, a uniform
forward motion for uniform taper, an
established eccentricity for the fly cut-
ter, and a pivot in the boring bar to
give a taper, are all provided for.
Through the use of this new machine,
accuracy in boring these holes in the
rudders can be attained with the added
advantage of a speedup in production.
Thus, another step has been made in the
effort to produce a Navy second to none.
coke
In order that a new wartime peak pro-
duction of iron and steel be maintained,
good quality coke must be supplied for
blast and steel making furnaces. The
by-products: nitration toluene, the tar
acids (phenol, cresol, xylenols), naph-
thalene, pyridine, and picoline; are a
few of those items important in defense
work.
Coke-oven design trends, a few years
ago, were to the tapered, high, thin type
where more recently, the trend is toward
a shorter, thicker oven. Narrower ovens
are more affected by unequal expansion
of the coals. The coke operator can
overcome this expansion effect by a more
complete knowledge of his furnace con-
ditions and coal properties. Proper con-
trol of moisture, crushing, blending, and
bulk density, are prime requisites for a
sufficient knowledge of the subsequent
expansions on heating. Since this ex-
pansion causes damage to the ovens
themselves, it is doubly important that
the operator be aware of the conditions
in his oven, not only to maintain the
operation of his oven but also to pro-
duce a uniform product.
Uniformity of the coke is the main
requirement for blast furnace use—uni-
formity of size, ash, and sulphur con-
tent. The size standard is necessary be-
cause of the use of the coke lattice to
support the solid charge above it in the
blast furnace. Composition uniformity
allows quick charge computations to be
made and a minimum of charge addi-
tions are necessary to counterbalance
the impurities present.

teries. Then the high tension magneto
in which the induction coil to step up
the voltage became part of the armature
and at present we have a return to the
battery and coil system, practically in
the form shown by Heany. The mag-
neto, however, finds extensive use on
outboard motors and on airplane en-
gines.
Although the modern two unit system
in its main essentials is the same as that
shown by Heany, the details have been
greatly changed, particularly the meth-
ods of regulating the charging rate of the
generator. The simplest method was
that used by Riker. The bucking field
as used by Heany, Kettering and others
was the next simplest and gave fair re-
sults but it is inherently defective in
that it is poor engineering to have two
coils of wire (the shunt and the series
fields) carrying currents in opposite di-
rections. It is much more logical to use
one weak current rather than two nearly
equal but opposite strong currents. The
third brush generator in which the shunt
field is fed from one main brush and a
third one between the other two, fur-
nished a simple and cheap form of in-
herently self-regulating generator and
was almost universally used for many
years. It could be readily designed to
give its maximum current at about 20
miles per hour and a smaller current at
higher speeds. This was considered a
desirable characteristic a few years ago.
The third brush machine was invented
and patented by an Englishman by the
name of Sayers, but was intended for
use as a motor. It is a peculiar fact that
the combination of a Sayers third brush
motor used as a generator and a storage
battery was apparently never patented,
(Continued from page 14)
although such a patent would have been
very valuable.
All these inherently self-regulating
systems tended to keep the charging
current the same no matter what the
speed. So long as all the current was
used for ignition only, this seemed good
enough, as the generator could be de-
signed to give a little more output than
was needed and the surplus was wasted.
One inherent trouble was that all these
generators gave the greatest charging
current when it was least needed, namely
when the battery was fully charged.
Theoretically what was needed was con-
stant voltage regulation, rather than con-
stant current. With this system, if the
battery is fully charged it takes little or
no current, if it is low it takes a large
current and is quickly restored to proper
operating condition. With constant volt-
age regulation it is unnecessary to burn
the headlights on long day runs to pre-
vent overcharge as was formerly done
by many motorists.
It was the increasing use of current
consuming devices that finally forced
the manufacturers to use the more re-
fined but also more complicated con-
stant voltage system. In a modern car,
ignition requires about 2 amperes, lights
16, car heater and defroster 6, and the
radio 7 amperes. Thus the load on the
battery may vary from a minimum of
2 to a maximum of about 31 amperes.
To take care of such a variable load, a
constant current system was inadequate.
One of the earliest forms of constant
voltage generator was a plain shunt ma-
chine, driven through a slipping clutch.
This clutch was controlled by a centri-
fugal device so as to hold the generator
speed nearly constant. Of course there
was a large loss in the clutch and the
efficiency was very low. Naturally this
method did not last very long.
As has been shown, it is an easy mat-
ter to build a generator which is inher-
ently self-regulating for constant cur-
rent, but so far as we know it is impos-
sible to do so for constant voltage. We
must add some external device such as
the slipping clutch just described. The
method used today was known many
years ago but was abandoned in favor
of the simplier constant current schemes.
A shunt wound generator is usually
regulated by a rheostat in the shunt
field. Many attempts were made to vary
automatically the amount of this resist-
ance so as to hold the voltage or cur-
rent constant through a wide range of
speed. Obviously such a scheme was
complicated and sure to give trouble. It
was a real stroke of genius to substitute
a fixed resistor for the variable rheostat
and arrange to cut it in or out of circuit
rapidly. With this resistor short cir-
cuited, the voltage would be too high;
with it in, loo low. The intermittent
short circuiting of the resistor is accom-
plished by a vibrator much like that of
an old-fashioned induction coil. The
electrical inertia of the shunt field holds
its current to a nearly constant value
and the voltage of the generator shows
no perceptible variation. The action of
the vibrator is controlled by the voltage
or the current or by a combination of
both if desired. This general principle
is applied to very large generators as
well as to the small ones used on auto-
mobiles. All the mechanism is in a small
metal box about which the user need
know nothing, and which rarely gives
trouble.
analytically and many experiments have
been carried out to substantiate the an-
alytical results. Among the basic as-
sumptions made in elastic stability are
that the deformations are small and pro-
portional to the loads applied. These
assumptions seem to be allowable in the
case of the flat plates.
In the case of thin curved sheets,
however, it is necessary to make further
assumptions in order to cope with the
mathematics necessary to handle the
problem and it is now felt by some au-
STRESS ANALYSIS
(Continued from page 75)
thorities that these assumptions can-
not be accurately made. Only a moder-
ate number of experiments have been
carried out to verify the analytical solu-
tions of thin curved sheets and the re-
sults have been that the theoretical and
experimental determinations do not
agree. A few empirical formulas have
been developed for the analysis of thin
curved sheets and these have been veri-
fied within certain limits by laboratory
experiments. Work is being carried on
here at the University of Michigan by
the Aeronautical Engineering Depart-
ment in this field at the present time.
It can be seen from this short review
of the problem of stress analysis in the
aircraft industry that many new diffi-
culties have led to the development and
expansion of new theories. However, the
problems that have been answered are
only a few compared with the many yet
unsolved. The field of stress analysis is
old and yet the modern applications are
new because of the growing demand for
more accurate results.

Return of

Age
Carbon . . . one of Nature's oldest
and most plentiful materials . . . is
making possible some of industry's
newest achievements.
In the chemical industry, massive
black towers of carbon . . . erected in
incredibly short periods of time . . .
speed the delivery of vital acids. The
all-carbon electrostatic precipitator...
built of carbon from the bottom to the
top of the stack is now an actuality.
Such towers can be erected in as little
as a week's time! Staunchly immune
to corrosion and thermal shock, ibey
should last indefinitely.

Today . . . due to basic and ap-
b^ plied research into the proper-
B ties of carbon and graphite . . .
M^5 3l '* 's possible to obtain these
^^3^^ black,wonder-working materials
in such a variety of forms-
blocks, bricks, beams,tubes, pipes, and fittings
... even valves and pumps . .. that almost any
size or shape of structure can be built from
them. For making tight joints, which give the
structure uniform properties throughout, spe-
cial carbon- and graphite-base cements have
been developed.
Undisturbed by the torture of heat,
carbon is also a "must" in the met-
allurgical industry. Carbon cannot
be melted . . . will not soften . . .
and has remarkable dimensional
stability even at incandescent heat.
In addition, it will not flake off and
hot metal will not stick to it. That
is why it is ideal for such uses as
res, and plugs . . . for the lining of
ml for sampling-dippers.

Because electric-furnace graphite
conducts heat even better than

These new uses for carbon and graphite . ..
added to the almost interminable list of uses

VICTORY TO THE STRONG
By
COLONEL W. A. CANOE
February 26, 1942
Dr. H. J. Heneman
War Board
University of Michigan
My dear Doctor:
In answer to your request for sug-
gestions from me on the University's
maximum usefulness in this emergency
without impairing its future educational
value, I present the following observa-
tions for what they may be worth.
Probably no civil institution in our
country has escaped in the last two de-
cades the influence of our government's
aversion to an adequate national defense.
Constant ideas and ideals of appease-
ment which cut appropriations to the
point of improvidence have had their
natural effect upon institutions of learn-
ing.
Coupled with this influence is the
subtle undermining of our former phys-
ical vigor and hardihood throughout the
nation by various coquetting inventions
and softening devices, the overuse of
which is well-known and scarcely blam-
able. Yet a hot-house, indoor, flabby
manhood has resulted, the statistics of
which are so discouraging that they are
not published.
Although it was intensely hot, train-
ing was purposely intensified in order to
accustom the men to great exertion in
extreme heat. During the hottest part
of the day, a strenuous and lengthy
bayonet practice was held. The officers
were not exempt: from ele%'en to twelve
they fenced with Japanese two-handed
swords.
In the embrace of these two forces
the authorities of institutions have been
so subtly and gradually lulled that they
themselves don't recognize the imminent
peril the present graduate faces as a
participant anywhere in this war. Some
do not realize that war is going on, that
it may strike here or anywhere at any
minute, that something quick and dras-
tic has to be done, if we are not going to
be particeps criminis in the slaughter of
our youth.
Physical examples of the backward-
ness of the University of Michigan are:
1. The Boiler-House R.O.T.C.
2. Class rooms for junior and senior
R.O.T.C. men which would be con-
demned by a health officer of New York
City.
3. One-hour drills not worthy of the
name (recently changed, but change not
initiated by authorities).
These and other conditions proclaim
the Tommy Atkins atmosphere prevalent
here.
An offshoot of the same attitude dis-
closes itself in the search for courses—
mental courses—that will ostensibly help
the boy when he arrives in the service.
An inventory of selectees reveals a great
prevalence of college and high school
graduates among those so far inducted.
In reality the services are not in need
of specialized education or general men-
tal training. In a recent responsible duty
I was called upon to perform, I had no
trouble in obtaining plenty of college
and post graduates as privates and spe-
cialists along most any line.
But Washington knows and the serv-
ices know that our men are not hardy,
and that it is doubtful if we by a proc-
ess of ceaseless physical training can
in five years bring them to the rugged-
ness and endurance so vital to a modern
army, so remarkably attained by Ger-
mans and Japs already. The proof I
can adduce for this comparative weak-
ness is endless. Frankly we are not fac-
ing remedial action squarely. We are
actually fussing with evasions. It is a
part of our softness not to recognize the
softness.
Several days after this celebration I
got my first taste of Japanese field serv-
ice. It was our battalion's turn to go to
Camp Johana for a few days' combat
firing. This camp lay about twenty-five
miles inland beyond a range of moun-
tains. We started out at nine o'clock at
night in a driving rain and marched
through a steady downpour until seven
the next morning when we reached Jo-
hana.
We have long maintained that our
educational institutions cultivate all-
round development—both physical and
mental. Too largely have we succeeded
in turning out low-browed gladiators and
high-browed anemics. Just now under
the war impetus there is a great chance
of obtaining more balance in the indi-
vidual by aggrandizing the physical
along with the mental.
As you realize, there is a wide differ-
ence between an athletic man and a
rugged one. In this institution as in
many others I have inspected, we are
far below physical hardihood and endur-
ance. We might fairly be termed ath-
letic lounge-lizards. And all this is in
contrast to the condition of the Jap
soldiers, which condition has had as
much to do with their success as their
weapons, if not more.
The twelve-day autumn maneuvers
were divided into three four-day periods
devoted respectively to regimental, brig-
ade, and divisional exercises. These e.\-
MARCH, 1942

long distances marched and the long
periods without rest or sleep. One day
we marched thirty-seven miles. Twice
the troops went three days and two
nights without sleep except what could
be snatched during ten-minute halts and
brief lulls in the situation. Sometimes
the men slept while walking. The last
four-day period was the most strenuous.
We started out at five in the morning
and marched almost continuously until
ten the next morning. In that time wc
covered fifty-six miles.
Aside from the question of the sur-
vival of the United States, the matter
of our duty to equip our students with
the greatest power to help deal our ene-
mies a maximum blow, and the greatest
training to avoid being killed uselessly,
seems to me to be paramount.
The outstanding department in this
institution for such work is not the
R.O.T.C., as you would expect me to
say, but the Department of Physical
Education. If we are going to stop mak-
ing faces at ourselves under the cloak
of the greatest equipment to the great-
est number, we'll come out into the open
and do the things best promoting the
endurance of our students and our na-
tion, irrespective of personal desires.
The war can and will touch us all. The
fattest will fall and the fittest will ful-
fill. I'm sure you'll agree that this is
no time for faculty jealousies, institu-
tional conceits, normal schedules or sus-
tained prejudices. We are at war. If
we're sincere about winning it, the path
to follow is undeviatingly plain. With-
out lowering any mental standards, there
are, as I see it, three developments to
emphasize:
1. The development of physical
strength and endurance.
2. The development of followship.
3. The development of leadership.
It was the absence of these three that
principally accounted for the 15,000
graves of Americans in France, graves
which need never have been there; that
accounted for the million men we have
lost uselessly in our other wars.
Since no criticism is worth anything
without a constructive remedy, I sug-
gest the following general plan be intro-
duced into the University curriculum as
soon as possible:
1. That it be compulsory for each
student to take two hours strenuous
exercise under the Physical Education
Department five days a week, and that
he receive credits therefor.
In bivouac, virtually everybody who
is not actually on post as a sentry is out
on a patrol of some kind. I remarked
on this to Captain Teshima and he re-
plied that the idea was to keep every-
body busy.
Several weeks ago Colonel W.
A. Canoe, P. M. S. &amp; T. of the
University of Michigan R. 0.
T. C, sent a letter to Associate
Professor Harlow J. Hcneman,
Executive Director of the Uni-
versity War Board. Hitting di-
rectly at our weaknesses, Col-
onel Canoe aimed his main bar-
rage at the physical "unfitness"
of modern America and the fa-
cilities for military education at
the University of Michigan.
We heartily endorse Colonel
Canoe's letter as one of the best
constructive criticisms we have
read in the present crisis and
strongly recommend that every
student read and digest this
letter.
The red paragraphs are ex-
cerpts from Major Harold Doud's
article "Six Months With The
|ap Infantry," which appeared
in the March 1942 issue of the
INFANTRY JOURNAL
"But why not let some of them
sleep?'' I asked.
"Oh. no!" he said. "That is not neces-
sary. They already know how to sleep.
They need training in how to stay
awake."
2. That the R.O.T.C. work in cooper-
ation with the Physical Education De-
partment, loaning it such aid as is de-
sired in the shape of instructors and
supervision, many of the Advanced
Course cadet officers being used for that
purpose.
3. That R.O.T.C. drill be given credit
in the exercise program only for time
spent at drill.
4. That all supervised athletics in the
University be given corresponding credit
for hours actually spent in exercise.
5. That the R.O.T.C. teach a demo-
cratic leadership which will bring out
the maximum team-work, obedience, re-
sourcefulness, punctiliousness, adjusta-
bility, initiative and harmony from the
followers.
6. That the R.O.T.C. in its laboratory
of two hours a week throw such com-
plete responsibility upon its cadet offi-
cers that they will, without interference
from the teaching staff, be in fact in
command of their units while in the drill
hall. They will be required to plan the
drills, be the sole instructors, have the
movements executed expeditiously and,
above all, know each man of the unit by
name and character, seeking out the men
for whom they are responsible between
drills and showing their interest in them.
7. That on drill days, when the
weather permits, the unit be taken to
the Arboretum, there to practice move-
ments under actual conditions of battle,
the ability to take quick cover and con-
cealment being emphasized.
At Johana we put in two days at fir-
ing platoon combat problems and then,
at 4:00 a.m. on the third day, began the
twenty-five-mile hike back to Kana-
zawa. The march was completed in a
burning heat at two in the afternoon.
The 1st Company did not fall out when
the battalion was dismissed. Instead, its
company commander doubletimed it
around the area of barracks two or three
times. This seemed so unusual to me
that I asked "Why?" The company
commander smiled. "I'm just proving to
my men that they still have lots of 'go'
and are not nearly as tired as they may
think they are," he said.
8. That all students undergoing in-
structions indicated here receive full ex-
planation of the reasons behind every
exercise and general possibilities of the
war.
9. That a followship and leadership
be developed which will be as good for
business as for military success; that
such movements and exercises be per-
formed as will best produce rugged en-
durance, protection from the enemy and
the greatest destruction to him; and
that in the only laboratory for practice
in handling human beings in the Univer-
sity there be used only that kind of
leadership methods that will answer the
definition—the ability to make men
want to follow.
The country is quivering for some one
to take the lead in a staunch reply to
Hitler's youth movement. Why not let
it be the University of Michigan?

Creep testing room in the metallurgical laboratories
Nowadays one would not think of specifying metals for special types of service without securing all available information regarding
their behavior under the conditions to which they will be subjected. Tension, compression, shear and other mechanical tests are always
useful but do not give a sufficiently complete picture in all cases. The petroleum industry, for instance, frequently subjects metals to
continuous stresses at elevated temperatures. In the creep testing laboratory, metals are subjected for long periods of time to steady
loading at these higher temperatures and measurements of the "creep" for each loading and temperature are recorded for study. Under
some conditions a given metal will elongate a certain amount and during the elongation will become strain hardened (hardening through
deformation) to such a degree that it will sustain the load indefinitely. Under conditions of higher loads or higher temperatures it will
continue to elongate until failure occurs. Such information is of great value in the design of equipment to be used in many industries.
Students of the Engineering College of the University not only learn from experimental data arrived at in laboratories as indicated
above, but from preliminary courses in mathematics, physics and chemistry they are able to discern the reasons for the results obtained
and to plan and execute further researches.

BLACKOUT WATCHMAN
THE problem ot maintaining a night light in his place
of business and at the same time complying with
blackout regulations was solved by a Schenectady machine-
shop owner by means ot' a G-E photo tube, or "electric
eye." Rules required that all lights be extinguished within
five minutes of an air-raid warning. That meant either
hiring a watchman or turning out all lights at closing
time.
The first night that the lights were turned out, the
shop was broken into. So the owner, Andrew Tessier, put
the "electric eye" to work. He installed the tube in an
upstairs window, pointing at the nearest street light.
When, during a practice blackout or raid warning, the
street light is extinguished, the tube immediately turns
out all lights in the shop. When the street lights go on
again, so do the night lights. The "eye" provides a watch-
man who doesn't go to sleep on his job, and whose total
cost is about two weeks' pay tor an actual watchman.

MOLECULES MARCH/
WITH the increasing use of plastics and of artificial
silk and rubber in defense activities, the structural
qualities of the molecules that make up these materia

all-important to the scientists who are doing the research
work.
Dr. Raymond M. FuoSS, of the General Electric Re-
search Laboratory, in Schenectady, has found that some
molecules wiggle like worms when an alternating electric
field is applied to them. Such molecules are electrically
lopsided, and when in an electric field they tend to line up,
just as compass needles line up with the magnetic field of
the earth.
From this tendency ot the molecules to move to and fro
in an electric field, scientists are able to determine how
the various molecules are built. With this information,
new molecules can be designed to meet specific needs. Since
artificial silk and rubber and many plastics are composed
ot these worm-like molecules which react in an electrical
field, materials of a wide variety of properties may be
expected as a result of these researches.

NOT FOR WILLIE-
Tl 11 General Electric Company is proud of the variety
of services it renders its customers. Nevertheless,
company officials were surprised by one recent request
from a woman who had seen a G-E advertisement in a
magazine.
The illustration in the advertisement contained
picture of a young boy. The woman also had a boy, and
her boy looked very much like the boy in the photograph.
Mother and son had only recently moved to New
York. Since then, she had taken her son to a number of
different barbers, but none of them had produced a
haircut that suited her. And so, in desperation, she wrote
to General Electric to find where the boy in the adver-
tisement had his hair cut. It was just the type of cut she
had vainly tried to get.

Automotive exhaust manifolds must have resistance
to growth, and good strength at elevated tempera-
tures. Competitive conditions demand minimum costs.
An iron containing about 3.30% C — 2.20% Si —
0.70 % Mn — 0.60 % Cr — and 0.60 % Mo does the trick,
while holding down foundry and machining costs.
This Chromium-Molybdenum combination is char-
acterized by high strength and toughness at the work-
ing temperatures encountered in exhaust manifolds.
Its growth resistance prevents warpage and cracking
— saves gaskets.

41 °e ,N u.s&gt;
Engineers responsible for the design of American mechanized armament
and the machines that make it have found that they can successfully
meet every bearing requirement with one kind of bearing—the Timken
Tapered Roller Bearing.
Friction elimination; precision; radial, thrust and combined load capac-
ities; maintenance of alignment of shafts and gears; all of these qualities
are inherent in the design and construction of the Timken Bearing.
You never may be called upon to design military equipment, but a thor-
ough knowledge of the Timken Bearing and its universal application will
be one of your most valuable assets no matter what branch of mechan-
ical engineering you eventually may enter.
We always will be glad to give you any information you may require
—including the solution of specific bearing problems.

Many industrial processes require the application of heat under
controlled conditions which makes the use of direct flames impossible.
Some of the temperature requirements are beyond the safe working
limits of steam so that other heat-carrying media have been devel-
oped. Research on proposed substances for this purpose has been
necessary to determine the characteristics of each and to check their
performance in given applications. The experimental unit shown has
been used extensively for this purpose.
The University of Michigan is offering a research service to indus-
try through sponsored projects and the work on the heat carriers illus-
trates one of the great variety of fields of study coming within the
scope of this service.

. . . New world's record of 41,782 net
tons of pig iron was set in January by
a Pittsburgh blast furnace.
... A new two-part Army helmet is
being considered. The inner part is of
light, strong preformed plastic for ordi-
nary wear. During battle an outer shell
of steel is slipped over the plastic.
. . . Tin recovery from discarded tin
cans is now a large scale operation. Of
the estimated 2,500,000 tons of tin cans
annually discarded, 1,000,00 tons are
reclaimable for detinning. These would
yield about 11,000 tons of tin and 900,-
000 tons of scrap steel.
. . . Plastic will soon replace alumi-
num in the manufacture of trench mor-
tar fuses.
... A newly designed fire fighting
trailer, for use in air raids and to com-
bat industrial sabotage can deliver 500
gallons of water per hour at 120 pounds
pressure. It also carries extinguisher,
fire axes, shovels, and first aid equip-
ment.
. . . Note to post-war auto manufac-
turers: to eliminate accidents caused by
stepping on the wrong pedal, use an ac-
celerator-brake, heel-toe pedal. With
the new type of transmission already in
use, this would leave only one pedal for
one nut to manipulate.
. . . Robot sentinels for protection of
defense plants are being turned out by
the thousands. The mechanical night
watchmen are sensitive microphones
placed at intervals along the steel fences
to detect and transmit to central offices
footsteps, whispers or wire tapping op-
erations.
. . . "Red Shortness" in steel can now
be reduced by adding anhydrous sul-
phite instead of sulphur. Steels thus
treated consequently show superior roll-
ing and machining properties.
. . . Copper deposited on the interior
of artillery gun barrels during firing can
be removed by treatment with an alloy
55/£ zinc and 45r/&lt; lead, thus forming
a low melting alloy with the copper, but
leaving lead alloy in the barrel. This
can be removed by using dilute sulfuric
acid and common salt, with nickel sul-
fate as accelerator.
. . . Cotton seed oil has proved to be
comparable to palm oils as a carrier in
tin plating processes. The abundance of
cotton seed and scarcity of palm oil
marked this a major development.
. . . Within the next few months Can-
ada will go into the magnesium produc-
tion business. The development of
brucite deposits in Quebec will make
Canada independent of other countries
for high grade magnesium refractories.
. . . The answer to the rubber short-
age problem may be forthcoming shortly
in the form of a Russian rubber plant
called Tau-suyz, or mountain gum. Rus-
sians report that the plant yields up to
40% pure rubber.
... An alloy composition checker
called the Identonate has recently been
developed which can detect an extreme-
ly slight difference in composition of al-
loys. It embodies the principle of the
thermocouple.
. . . The President has asked Congress
to appropriate an additional $366,370
for exploring deposits of iron, copper,
zinc, vanadium and minor metals in the
Western States. Plans for the future in-
clude explorations for other metals such
as antimony, chromium, manganese and
tungsten.
. . . Because of lack of material a
West Coast aircraft parts plant is opera-
ing at only 15$ capacity, nineteen
others from 15% to 40%.

About ZINC
In the period of America's greatest
industrial development, ZINC rendered
indispensable service; it is reasonable to
expect that it will be utilized even more
extensively in the greater developments
yet to come.
ZINC has now gone to war, as an
essential element in every form of fight-
ing eguipment, on land and sea, and in
the air. In times of peace, it is used in
an almost infinite variety of applications,
from the tiny elements of zipper closures
to protective coatings for the hulls of the
largest ocean-going ships. You can't get
away from it—ZINC comes into intimate
touch with the life of every individual.
The Zinc industry itself is earnestly
and wholeheartedly striving to do a
worthy job in supporting the nation's
war program. It is also anticipating and
preparing for the day when Victory is
won, when new problems must be
solved.

Are You, Too, Looking
To The Future?

... A complete shutdown of steel
shipments other than those vitally nec-
essary for national defense is expected
in the near future. Such things as bed
springs, spiral bindings, and office sup-
plies must go.
. . . Machine tools will be produced
during the coming year at a rate ex-
ceeding 1,000 machines per day, seven
days per week. This is greater than any
country has ever produced to date, and
considerably surpasses last year's mark,
when 190,000 new machines were manu-
factured and set to work in the U. S.
. . . Wood, steel and plastics are be-
ing substituted for aluminum in the
manufacture of all types of noncomba-
tant aircraft, including transports. At
present one company saves 1,250
pounds of aluminum per plane by this
method. Woodworking subcontracts will
probably go to the furniture manufac-
turers.
. . . Although the axis submarine cam-
paign may appear to be sinking more
ships than we are building, when com-
pared on a tonnage basis, we are in
reality producing more than we lose.
(This is because the axis is sinking
smaller ships than we are building.) We
will shortly be producing more ships
than all the rest of the world combined.
More or less running it into the ground,
however, is the news that a New Or-
leans shipbuilder has received a govern-
ment contract to build cargo ships by
production line methods.
. . . One newly-constructed bomber-
motor factory is so far ahead of sched-
ule that it will produce in the first six
months of this year what it was ex-
pected to produce in the entire year,
and by December will be producing five
times the schedule called for.
. . . When the rotor for a large syn-
chronous condenser was recently forged,
the 192,000 pound ingot was heated for
two weeks before mechanical working
was begun.
... A recent government survey has
shown that automobile tires will last
twice as long at 40 mph as at 60 mph,
only 45% of the tire wear going to use-
ful mileage at the latter speed.
. . . The present shortage of critical
materials has brought silver into use as
an industrial metal; it is used in its pure
form for bearings in airplanes and wir-
ing in electrical equipment. In sintered
form, it is used in the manufacturing
of certain types of welding electrodes.
As an alloy it is replacing nickel and tin
in the manufacture of everything from
battleships to surgical products and sol-
ders. Silver plating is again being used
as a corrosion resistant medium.
... In an effort to conserve vital ma-
terials, a recent Department of Com-
merce report has urged the use of
wooden ball bearings where ever possi-
ble. It is claimed that they will function
quite as well, and last as long as metal
bearings where the strains are not too
great. •
. . . Germany's long-range bomber,
the He 177, is believed by some experts
to have a range sufficient to carry a
thousand pound bomb load from Bress
to New York and return—a range of
7,000 miles.
. . . The highly touted American P47
pursuit, the Thunderbolt, has an even
more powerful counterpart in the Eng-
lish production circles, the Hawker Ty-
phoon. Although the performance figures
on either are secret, the British fighter
sports a 2,400 HP motor compared to
the Thunderbolt's 2,000 HP motor.
. . . Japan has announced the develop-
ment of a parachute made from paper,
which, it is claimed, is as reliable as a
silk chute, and more resistant to sudden
temperature changes.

off the port bow!
Tonight, somewhere at sea, a man
stands on the bridge of a freighter with
the life line of a nation in his hands.
He is straining his eyes for sight of
one of those islands which are our coun-
try's first line of defense. To these islands
must he transported huge quantities of
munitions and food. And the only an-
swer is ships, ships, and more ships.
How is America meeting this tre-
mendous responsibility? You'll get a
fair idea at such great factories as the
Westinghouse plant where the machinery
to drive many of those supply ships is
being built, or at the huge Westinghouse-
operated Maritime Commission plant
which is now being erected alongside it.
The "know how" that works
24 hours a day
There, in these factories is a dramatic
example of how Westinghouse "know
how" is doing a job for National Defense.
A salute to the "Class of '41"
In the all-out Westinghouse war effort,
no group in our entire organization is
more deeply engaged today than the 600
young engineers who last year left your
campus paths to join this company. In
research, design, production—they have
already made important contributions.
This year many more engineers will
come to us from your college and
others to mesh their eager talent with
our "know-how" and apply it to their
country's defense. Certainly nowhere
does there exist a greater opportunity
for them to translate their intelligence,
skill and enterprise into vital service.
For Westinghouse is, always has been,
and we believe always will be, "an en-
gineer's company."
Westinghouse

What is this "know how"? It is the
ability to get things done in the best
possible way—learned in building prod-
ucts for the general welfare and now
used in building materials for the com-
mon defense.
The same skill and ingenuity that
are building those turbines for the mer-
chant fleet, not long ago built more effi-
cient electric refrigerators and washing
machines. Again, the research skill that
developed intricate new radio equip-
ment has found ways of utilizing that
equipment in important defense work.
At 17 Westinghouse Divisions, and in
the plants of more than 300 sub-contrac-
tors, our energies are almost exclusively
turned to the creation of $400,000,000
worth of defense materials. It's our way
of speeding the day when our "know
how" will be serving America again—in
the home, the farm, and the factory.

PRODUCTION
By
PAUL KENNEDY, '44E
WITH an armament schedule of
125,000 planes, 75,000 tanks, and
10,000,000 tons of ships in 1943, the
production of fuel, lubricants, and tol-
uene has become the primary assign-
ment of the petroleum industry.
Of the types of fuel needed, refiners
will concentrate on the production of
100-octane aviation gasoline, so vital to
the high performance of our military
aircraft. Refining of this fuel has grown
in three years from nothing to around
50,000 barrels per day and at the pres-
ent time the only factor holding the in-
dustry from producing the estimated
150,000 barrels per day which will be
needed is the inability to obtain equip-
ment.
One-hundred-octane gasoline is a
blend of ingredients, in general consist-
ing of 409?-45% 95-octane iso-octane,
409f-459r 74-octane aviation straight
run, 15%-209f 90-octane isopentane to
supply volatility and 3-4 c.c. per gallon
of tetraethyl lead.
The straight run gasoline may be
made by straight distillation from high
quality Gulf Coast and California
crudes or from any crude by the Hou-
dry Process, which is able to produce a
gasoline suitable for aviation blending
with a 78-81 A.S.T.M. octane rating.
By the use of this process, the only
proven catalytic cracking process in use
today, the vapor pressure of the debut-
anized aviation base stock is high
enough (7-8 lbs. Reid) so that no out-
side iso-pentane need be added. There
are 16 Houdry units now in operation
or under construction with a combined
cracking capacity of over 200,000 bar-
rels per day.
The Houdry Process is comparatively
new, being discovered in 1926 when it
was found that certain natural clay
catalysts produced high grade gasoline
from Venezuela residuum. The only
problem was in revivifying the catalyst
after use, for the heat of oxidation of
the catalyst was so great and the ther-
mal conductivity so poor that the result
was a mass of fused catalyst and steel.
The problem was solved temporarily by
circulating only small amounts of air
over the catalyst along with large vol-
umes of flue gas so the heat of regen-
eration was removed as sensible heat in
the flue gas. However, this procedure
was so slow that after a few changes

in design, water under pressure was
used to absorb the heat and now a
eutectic mixture of molten salts circu-
lates through pipes in the mass. This
mixture is cooled outside of the cases,
the method being so efficient that the on
stream time is only ten minutes as com-
pared with eight to twelve hours using
air and flue gas.
The iso-octane, formerly obtained by
the selective polymerization of normal
and iso-butylenes to form iso-octenes
from which iso-octane was produced by
hydrogenation, is now made by the
chemical combination of butylenes and
isobutane with sulfuric acid as a cata-
lyst. The reaction in this process, called
the alkylation process, is the addition
of an olefin, butene, to isobutane to
form isoparaffins. This is done by bring-
ing the butene in contact with an excess
of isoparaffin in the presence of a rela-
tively large amount of sulfuric acid be-
tween 30 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
The products yielded by the alkylation
process are very well suited for making
aviation fuel because of their high oc-
tane number, high lead susceptibility,
and low sulphur content. When the ole-
fin, butene and the isoparaffin, isobutane
are used, the boiling point of the prod-
uct is almost entirely in the gasoline
boiling range, 80 to 90 per cent distill-
ing over below 300 degrees Fahrenheit.
This process gives aviation fuels of 92-
94 octane rating.
The question of lubricants does not
seem to be so serious despite the in-
creasing number of aircraft units com-
ing into active service. Since highly-
refined oil will oxidize rapidly at high
temperatures and form organic acids
and other harmful substances, oxidation
inhibitors must be added along with
compounds to keep any sludge formed
suspended in the oil to prevent forma-
tion of engine deposits. Several new
agents have been introduced, one of the
most successful consisting of a sulphur-
ized olefin synthetically produced from
paraffin wax.
Toluene, important to our defense ef-
forts in the making of trinitrotoluene,
is another product of the refining in-
dustry. Formerly the chief source of
toluene was the coal tar industry, but
as the amount produced was only about
one-third of the estimated 60,000,000
gallons per year estimated to be needed,
it became necessary to utilize other
sources of supply, chief of which is pe-
troleum. After the crude oil has been
cracked by the usual methods, toluene
may be removed by a rather simple
fractionation if the cracked oil is not
contaminated with defines or naph-

HIGH scholarship, exemplary char-
acter, recognition of engineering
achievement, and the fostering of a lib-
eral culture in the college of engineer-
ing are the four general principles upon
which the foundation for Tau Beta Pi
was laid. The engineer looks to Tau
Beta Pi as the literary student looks to
Phi Beta Kappa.
The history of the local chapter of
Tau Beta Pi is intimately connected
with Professor H. H. Higbie, who
formed the chapter in 1906. When he
was a junior in electrical engineering at
Columbia University, in 1903, Professor
Higbie was elected to Tau Beta Pi and
became recording secretary of New
York Alpha. This position started him
on a career of officership which finally
led to his becoming president of the
National Executive Council. Besides
holding a B.S.E. in Electrical Engineer-
ing, Professor Higbie was interested in
experimental mechanical engineering
and had been a student assistant in this
line.
He graduated in June, 1904, and it
was this combination of mechanical and
electrical knowledge that brought him
to Michigan. In February, 1905, Dean
Cooley was looking for someone to fill
vacancies in both the mechanical and
the electrical departments, and astutely
chose Mr. Higbie. Instructor Higbie
first taught M.E. 3, 7, and mechanism.
There was no Tau Beta Pi here be-
fore that time, and until he obtained a
charter for Michigan Gamma chapter,
he was the society's only representative
on the campus. Early in 1905, G. A.
Goodenough, then President of the
Executive Council, and Secretary R. W.
Matthews asked Professor Higbie to
start a chapter at Michigan. That was
easier said than done, because there
were many obstacles. One in particular
which must have seemed very formid-
able, indeed, to a cub instructor, was
the attitude of President Angell, who
believed that honor societies were un-
democratic and, therefore, he had an
unfavorable attitude toward them all.
He was especially antagonistic toward
the idea of establishing a new organiza-
tion.
The idea was first presented to Dean
Cooley, who heartily approved of it, as
did the standing committee; and, in
fact, the engineering faculty was almost
unanimously in favor. The Dean offered
his support in presenting the case to
President Angell, and, when the smoke
cleared away, Professor Higbie was left
with permission to proceed, with the

following blessing from the Old Man:
"I don't believe it's going to do the
University much good, as you think,
but I don't see how it will do much
harm."
The next obstacle was the grading
system which made it impossible to de-
termine a man's relative standing in his
class. The system used was "P" for
passed, "C" for conditionally passed,
and "NP" for not passed. Obviously,
no distinction could be made among
those who had passed everything. This
system was replaced by the present one
within a few years, but, meanwhile, it
became necessary to depend upon the
instructors' memories to determine the
relative standings of all the men. For
the next few months Professor Higbie
spent most of his time in personal con-
ference with members of the faculty at-
tempting to organize the classes accord-
ing to rank. It can be said that Tau
Beta Pi had a great deal to do with the
establishing of a new grading system at
the University of Michigan.
It was not until 1906 that complete
data was assembled, whereupon, the
charter was granted. Professor Higbie
initiated the following charter members:
Arthur A. Abel, 07: Henry E. Fletcher,
'07; Joseph A. Bursley, '99; Frank
Burton, '07; John C. Garrels, '07; Carl
Howard Clement, '07; Herbert J.
Goulding, '93; Donald T. Hastings,
07; William S. Haselton, '01; Wallace
X. Osburn, 07; Robert B. Otis, 03:
Horace P. Ramey, 07; Oswald M.
Wagenseil, '07; Edwin Van Doren Wal-
lace, 07; Charles J. Whipple, '07, and
Lawrence C. Whitsit, '07.
After the chapter was under way.
Professor Higbie prepared a report on
all the men eligible for election since
some time in the 1860's that was a con-
tinuous list about eight feet long which
folded up like an accordion. It was
from this list that the chapter elected
honorary members. Professor Higbie
served on the advisory board of Michi-
gan Gamma, and his first national posi-
tion after its installation was that of
vice-president of the Executive Council.
In that capacity he became acquainted
with Secretary R. W. Matthews, whose
ceaseless efforts on behalf of the Coun-
cil and the society have earned for him
the highest praise from all who knew
him.
In 1911, with the young chapter
flourishing, Professor Higbie accepted a
teaching job in a Boston trade school,
but returned in 1913 to a full professor-
ship.

THE MICHICAN TECHNIC


Earn, Learn, and Travel—Join the
U. S. Army! On Friday, June 13, 1930,
Mr. Robert J. Hopkins saw this sign
and became Private R. J. Hopkins.
Promotions added stripes to his sleeves
until he now is Technical Sergeant, 6th
Ordnance Service Company.
Arriving at midnight, January 30,
1908, Sergeant Hopkins presented
Moorland, Iowa, with the problem of
determining whether its population had
been increased on the 30th or the 31st.
Not being sure which day to call his
birthday gives him an opportunity to
celebrate it twice.
Before working for Uncle Sam, he
was employed by the Union Pacific
Railroad in Nebraska. Through the me-
dium of railroad passes he saw a great
deal of the country while with U.P.,
and more on the government's cuff after
enlisting. His army odyssey started with
a trip to Fort Sheridan, Illinois, in the
infantry. After two and a half years
there, he went to the U. S. Signal Corps
School at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey,
then back to Fort Sheridan again as
radio sergeant in the field artillery.
Each summer the field artillery hiked
two hundred and fifty miles to their
summer camp, and back again in the
fall. Nine years of riding five hundred
miles a year began to sour Sergeant
Hopkins on the field artillery, but it
took a rain storm to change his mind
completely. Twenty-five miles was a
normal day's march on the homeward
trek that particular fall: however, while
two days' march away from Fort Sheri-
dan, a storm suddenly came up and lit-
erally washed out their equipment. That
day they hiked continuously from 3:30
A.M. until 10 P.M., with forty minutes
out for lunch, covering fifty-five miles.
Before leaving for summer camp the
next summer, Sergeant Hopkins was in
the Ordnance Field Service School at
Raritan Arsenal!
From New Jersey he was sent to the
6th Corps Headquarters in Chicago,
back to Fort Sheridan again, and in
December of 1940 to Ann Arbor, where
you find him in the R.O.T.C. headquar-
ters "second door to left."
In high school Sergeant Hopkins
played baseball and football. At Fort
Sheridan he continued playing baseball,
but substituted basketball for football
since football wasn't played there.
While at Fort Sheridan, Sergeant
Hopkins came into contact with that
great army pastime, a game of chance
involving the intelligent use of two
ivory cubes. One of the top-sergeants
at the Fort always seemed to have
money, and also was inclined toward
risking the same. As frequently hap-
pened just previous to pay day, the
men would be no longer in funds. Pool-
ing their funds, they would start rolling
the cubes outside his door. He would
soon come out, and after watching for
a while join them. The game always
ended when he either had their three
or four dollars, or they had thirty or
forty of his to divide up.
Reminiscing further about Fort Sher-
idan days, as a buck private, Sergeant
Hopkins recalls an old sergeant at the
post with around twenty years service
behind him. He had risen the hard way
and was a typical hard-boiled sergeant.
On this day the lieutenant had sent
Private Hopkins to saddle his horse,
and told him to use his car to run down
to the stables. The sergeant was drill-
ing a detail, and recognizing the lieu-
tenant's car, called his men to attention
and saluted Private Hopkins.
As supply sergeant for the R.O.T.C.
unit and as assistant to Major Renner
instructing ordnance classes, he has bad
his first contact with college life. Al-
ways ready with a smile, Sergeant Hop-
kins has found his association with col-
lege students pleasant, and claims to
have enjoyed every minute of his time
here. Incidentally, Sergeant Hopkins is
also one of those scarce variety of ap-
preciated gentlemen, who is always will-
ing to go out of his way to be friendly
and helpful to anyone.

Lieutenant for a day!

ALUMINUM, the most abundant
of all the metallic elements found
in the earth's crust, was at one time
more precious than gold and silver and
equal in value to platinum. In less than
100 years its price has been lowered to
19 cents a pound by one of the greatest
industrial developments of modern
times.
The great Danish physicist and
chemist, Hans Christian Oersted, an-
nounced in the year 1825 that he had
obtained aluminum by gently heating
A1C13 and potassium amalgam. The
first great advance, however, was made
by the French chemist, Henri Sainte-
Claire Deville, who exhibited at the
Paris Exposition in 18SS a bar of alum-
inum made by heating a mixture of
A1C13 and sodium.
Napoleon, III, soon became inter-
ested in the metal that heretofore had
been used mainly for expensive jewelry.
He wished to increase the mobility of
his army and to do so he decided to
lighten its equipment. Sainte-Claire De-
ville was summoned to Napoleon's court
and commissioned to find a way of mak-
ing aluminum cheaply and in large
quantities. The result of this was that
by 1859 the price of the light metal
was $19 a pound with the "enormous
world production" of two tons.
The coup d'etat in solving the alum-
inum production problem goes to
Charles Martin Hall and his famous
electrolytic process. Although scores of
processes have been proposed for con-
verting various aluminum ores to alumi-
num, even today, practically all of the
production of aluminum metal from
alumina is done by the Hall process.
Interestingly enough, Hall perfected his
process at identically the same time that
a young Frenchman, Paul Heroult, was
developing the same idea thousands of
miles away.
Unlike many other metals, such as
iron, copper, and gold, aluminum is
never found in the native state, that is.
as actual metal; instead, it is always in
chemical combination with other ele-
ments, the principal compounds being
silicates and oxides. These are found in
every clay bank, some compositions
having as high as 40% Al2Os. Prac-
tically all of our common rocks contain
some aluminum. The cost of separating
the metal from these low-grade ores is
so great that until very recently, alum-
inum has been obtained in the United
States exclusively from bauxite, an ore
of hydrated aluminum oxide.
Impurities such as iron, silica, and
titanium are always present in the ore.
The mineral is found in a wide variety
of colors and textures. The majority of
the ore now being used in the United
States comes from Surinam and British
Guiana, although there are bauxite de-

ouija date
'Twas midway between Soph Cabaret
and Frosh Project—no date bureau was
functioning. An engineer freshman,
finding himself desirous of a date,
called up his entire list of little women.
They were both busy. The situation ap-
peared black, but his native ingenuity
did not desert him. Acting upon an in-
spiration, he spent a brief session with
his ouija board, emerging with a num-
ber. He called up Jordan Hall and
asked to speak with the occupant of
room 219.
He turned on the old personality and
asked her for a date the following Fri-
day. Somewhat to his surprise she ac-
cepted readily. By Friday the young
Casanova had begun to regret his hasty
actions, but decided to see it through.
With hesitant footsteps he approached
the rendezvous and called her number.
With quickening heartbeats he heard
her coming down the hall. Would she
be the campus queen he hoped for? Or
would she be that other type he feared
to get? You guessed 'er, Chester. Ha
spent a rousing evening playing gin
rummv with the house mother.
the worm turns
Among the numerous stories which
we have heard concerning the Slide
Rule Ball one strikes us as containing
a good object lesson. The old order
changeth, and the skyrocketing price
level in this neck of the woods has up-
set the old maxim about the customer
always being right.
A certain couple at the Ball felt the
need of refreshment, so decided to leave
early and pick up a midnight snack at
a local eatery before going home. They
ordered ham sandwiches, which, after
some delay, were served. The lady was
about to bite into hers when suddenly
she dropped it, uttering a low scream.
She pointed a shaking finger at a small
creature moving about on the lettuce
leaf. Close inspection proved it to be
the cutest little green worm you ever
saw.

mkp
The boy friend did his duty as a true
gentleman — he indignantly summoned
the manager, soundly berated him, and
ordered that the offending sandwich be
instantly replaced. But, instead of obey-
ing with obsequiousness and alacrity,
the manager merely said, "I'm very
sorry, but you'll have to keep it. That
meat is too expensive to throw away.
Furthermore, there will be an extra
charge of ten cents for the worm."
The last we saw of the boy friend he
was sitting on the old cannon behind
the library measuring cigarettes.

In keeping with the situation in
which the nation now finds itself, the
ROTC unit is trying to introduce a
more military atmosphere into its af-
fairs. Though it is not trying to be
stuffy, the unit requests that cadets fol-
low the prescribed customs of the serv-
ice in conducting their business. Alas,
some are woefully green when it comes
to matters of military etiquette. Only a
few days ago we heard this story about
a certain advanced course student. Our
scene opens at the sergeant's desk.
Cadet: "Sergeant, Cadet McGinnity
requests permission to see the colonel
on official business."
Sergeant: "You'll have to see the
adjutant first."
The cadet walks to the adjutant's
door, knocks, and enters, saluting with
snap and precision.
Cadet: "Sir, Cadet McGinnity re-
quests permission to see the colonel on
official business."
Adjutant: "Permission granted."
The cadet salutes, performs an about
face, and marches briskly to the colo-
nel's door. Again he knocks, enters, and
salutes, strictly according to regulations.
Cadet: "Sir, Cadet McGinnity has
the adjutant's permission to see the
colonel."
Colonel: "Yes, what can I do for
you?"
Cadet: "Sir, when the hell are we
going to get paid?"

Although we do not bother perverting

As the information can no longer be
of value to the enemy, the Technic can
now reveal the truth about one of the
most violent seismic cataclysms ever
know, and it happened right here in
Ann Arbor. A sophomore in one of the
Surveying 4 sections swears to us and
has shown us his field notebook to
prove it, that between two and four of
a Tuesday afternoon last month the
bench mark in the field near Mosher
Hall was uprooted by an earthquake
from its original position and trans-
ported to a spot twelve feet higher and
twenty-seven feet eastward. No cas-
ualty list has as yet been received.

WORN teeth no longer render crush-
ing equipment useless, nor do they
mean long, costly delays. Today there
is a simpler, faster, less expensive way
— hard facing with the Airco Oxy-
acetylene Flame. Reports indicate that
teeth built up by this proved Airco
process last longer, yet cost only 25%
of a new segment. Cost of replacing
the entire crusher is, of course, far
greater.
Airco Hard-Facing is a versatile
process. Wearing parts of varying
shape and size can be rebuilt econom-
ically, speedily. Standard oxyacety-
lene welding apparatus is employed.
Not only for maintenance of equip-
ment, but on thousands of production
lines, the Airco Oxyacetylene Flame is
on the firing line speeding countless
defense products to completion. It has
been drafted to cut steel to any desired
shape, to flame harden metal parts for
longer life, to weld two or more metal
parts into a strong, lasting unit, to ma-
chine metals with unrivaled speed, to
clean and dehydrate metal surfaces
for lasting paint jobs.
A pictorial review "Airco in the

these many uses of the flame. Write

sub-zero rubber
The behavior of rubber at extremely
low temperatures has continued to be-
come of importance as this war de-
velopes. High altitude flying and mech-
anized arctic fighting have carried the
application of rubber into sub-zero tem-
perature conditions. Rubber was known
to become brittle and inelastic at low
temperatures, but tests and comparisons
were necessary before the applications
could be safely specified.
Two properties of rubber, its elastic-
ity and insulating properties make it
invaluable. Low temperatures cause
cracking and make it inelastic; below
the brittle temperature it becomes use-
less. Brittle temperatures vary widely
depending upon the source, natural,
synthetic, or reclaimed; the size of the
rubber molecules, and the amount of
sulphur and compounds used in vulcan-
izing.
Crude rubber will crystalize at 14 de-
grees Fahrenheit if held for several
days, but it still possesses some elas-
ticity and can be bent slightly. Com-
plete loss in elasticity occurs around
—70 to —80 degrees Fahrenheit. It
acts similar to glass at this temperature,
if bent sharply.
Recently the Bell Telephone Labora-
tories have conducted tests on various
rubber compounds to determine the
brittle temperature. A sample testing
device was used to investigate the brit-
tle temperatures for rubber. A quadrant
mounted on a shaft with a crank for
rotating was arranged to hold the sam-
ples of rubber. This revolved in an in-
sulated tank, cooled by a mixture of
dry ice and acetone. Mounted speci-
mens were immersed in the cooling solu-
tions until they reached the temperature
of the bath shown by the thermometers.
A rapid rotation of the crank impacted
the specimen against a projecting bar.
If the particular brittle temperature
had been reached, it sheared off cleanly.
A summary of tests showed the less
sulphur used in vulcanizing, the lower
the temperature, and that all common
rubber compounds had higher brittle
temperatures than crude rubber.
fluorescent illumination
We can still have our cities lighted,
yet remain invisible from the air during
blackouts. Thus, innumerable civilian
accidents would be avoided, and it has
been found that the greatest number of
casualties during a blackout result, not
from the invaders, but from poor civil-
ian control.
This is all due to recent experiments
carried on at Lynn, Massachusetts.
There twelve specially designed lumi-
naries shaped like an admiral's hat and
using 2j-i-watt argon lamps, spaced 100
feet apart, were tested. With these
blackout lights of about one candle-
power, as compared with the regular
4,000-candlepower street lights, civil-
ians could see objects about twenty-five
feet away. It takes the eye about
twenty-five minutes to become adjusted
to the low illumination.
The lamp also gives off light in the
form of ultra-violet rays. Curbs, sign-
posts, and even vehicles could be cov-
ered with flourescent paints which glow
when activated by the rays. This would
increase ground visibility with the
blackout lighting—and none of this
could be seen from more than a few
hundred feet above the ground. Thus a
whole city could be made invisible to
high-flying enemy aircraft.
ductile zinc coat
In recent years, the Bethlehem Steel
Company has developed an electrolytic
process for zinc coating wire, which has
proved far superior to ordinary methods
of hot galvanizing. Zinc has been the
most commonly adopted protective coat-
ing for steel wire. As the field of appli-
cation of galvanized steel products
widened, however, it became apparent
that zinc coatings applied by existing
methods did not have as good mechan-
ical qualities as progressive industry
demanded. Heavier zinc coatings were
needed, which had to withstand drastic
deformations in the fabrication of wire
and sheets.
Zinc coatings applied by the hot gal-
vanizing process flaked off wire and
sheets when they were subjected to
drastic forming operations. The new
Bethanizing process solved their prob-
lem. By means of this new electrolytic
development, coating weights covering
the full range of zinc coatings could be
applied. At the same time the zinc was
usually pure, and therefore the coating
metal had ductility properties far be-
yond those customarily associated with
zinc.
Bethanizing is distinct from older
electrogalvanizing methods in the fact
that no metallic zinc appears in the sys-
tem until it is electrolyzed from the
solution as virgin zinc on the wire as a
finished process. This is because cal-
cined zinc concentrate is the raw mate-
rial source of the zinc instead of the
zinc anode. In respect to old hot dip
methods, the Bethanized coating differs
greatly. Its ductility is perfect, because
no impurities are present, and because
the hard, brittle zinc-iron alloy found
in hot-dip galvanizing is absent.
continuous weld
Of an estimated twenty-four thousand
welders in about fifty Navy and private
yards, all but a thousand or so are
using the electric arc method by
means of a comparatively new me-
chanical device. The welding head trav-
els on a track feeding welding rod auto-
matically at the rate of one-third to
one pound per minute. An operator with
helper can produce from 2,000 to 4,000
feet of welded joint per eight-hour day
in average ship plate thickness. In large-
size machines welds can be made with
current densities up to 30,000 amperes
per square inch depositing up to one
pound of weld rod per minute. Bt arc
rod is used, flux being fed by gravity
in front of the welding rod and covering
the entire welding zone. Excess flux in
some machines is picked up by vacuum
cleaners. Rod is fed to the arc from
continuous coils. Prefabrication is the
principal field of application. However,
smaller size machines are semi-portable
and may be used upon the ways. On the
ways an overhead weld may be made
first, as on bottom plates and a machine
weld made on the top side.

They Practice Imagineering Here
We've been counting noses here at Alcoa, and
we were amazed to discover the variety of Keys
dangling from watch chains around here.
Keys don't make the man. We mention them
only as a handy way of getting at the interest-
ing fact that it takes all kinds of men and of
knowledge to make an organization, such as
Alcoa, tick.
The striking thing is, how soon most of our
men shed their specific labels after they come
with us only to discover how much more excit-
ing it is to practice Imagineering.
There aren't any grooves to Imagineering.
There aren't any limits, either. A man lets his
imagination soar and then engineers it down
to earth. When he comes down he is just as
liable to find himself in a new department,
with new responsibilities, and a new set of con-
ditions on which to practice his Imagineering.
It is this kind of thing going on continuously
for fifty years that has made Alcoa a use-
ful business and an exciting organization in
which to be.
It is what the future of Aluminum is made of.

ated from Southwest High School in
Kansas City. While attending high
school, John rose to the position of ser-
geant in the R.O.T.C.
The fall of 1938 found John enrolling
as '42E (Mechanical) in the University
of Michigan. In the natural course of
events, he enrolled in the R.O.T.C. He
also joined Sigma Rho Tau in the fall
and tried out for the Technic in the
spring. Since his first year, John has
spent a good part of his time, both
night and day, working in the Technic
office.
Starting out as an assistant in the
Publication Department in his sopho-
more year, he became Editor of the
Publication Department in his junior
year. Last spring his ability and effort
won him the well-earned position of
Managing Editor. To John must go a
lion's share of the credit for the quality
of the Technic for the past year. His
knowledge of the "make-up" of a maga-
zine has been invaluable in producing
a magazine comparable to the prize-
winning magazines of the past.
Just to keep his hand in other things,
John has been active in A.S.M.E. the
past three years and he was in charge
of publicity for that organization this
year. He is also a member of A.O.A.
(Army Ordnance Association to the un-
initiated).
In the spring of 1941, John pledged
Theta Xi. That same spring he acted
as Program Chairman for Slide Rule
Ball and this year he was its Music
Chairman. It is then no wonder that
Vulcans found him worthy of member-
ship last fall.
John lists sleeping and gun collecting
as his two hobbies. Right now he has
been keeping busy cleaning his guns for
the long-awaited invasion of Ann Arbor.
Last summer John spent his time
working as a timekeeper on a pipe line
construction crew in McBain, Michi-
gan, a small town near Cadillac. As he
states it, he spent all his salary keeping
a 1934 Ford going and learned to play
bottle pool. In addition, he found he
couldn't stay away from the smell of
printer's ink for he spent a good deal
of time hanging around the offices of
the local weekly paper.
Looking into the future, John hopes
to be able to use his publication ability
by working on some technical magazine.

A native of Michigan, born in Manis-
tique, Prof. Marin has remained in the
state except for vacation rambles. One
such trip found him in Washington on
Easter. The sergeant of the guards at
the White House turned out to be an
old friend of his, with the result that
he took movies of the egg-rolling along
with the news reel cameramen.

Prof. Axel Marin
While still in high school, he worked
on water and sewer facility extension
work with his father who had charge of
the program. This experience with con-
struction work and keeping pumps and
motors running prompted him to study
engineering.
He entered the Engineering College
in 1916, but enlisted when the U. S.
entered the war. After receiving a com-
mission from the officers' training
school at Camp Custer, he was placed
in charge of the Bayonet School at
Camp Lee. Two days before he was to
leave for France, the Armistice was
signed.
Re-entering the University in 1919.
Axel obtained a job working in a
butcher shop. This and working as as-
sistant to Prof. Van den Broek helped
him to work his way through school.
He was appointed instructor in Me-
chanical Engineering in 1922, and has
been here ever since.
He has been employed frequently by
the Detroit Edison Co. doing every-
thing from repair work to running a

This is a war of machines.
And one of its decisive
battles is being fought
in the tool rooms of
America — with diamonds
as weapons! For the high
speed production of alloy
steel parts depends on
cemented carbide cutting
tools. Tools so hard that
only diamonds can give
them the fine, true edge
necessary for efficient
cutting. Thus Carborundum
Brand Diamond Wheels are
playing a vital part in
helping America re-arm.
Because these cutting tools are the
hardest known, sharpening and con-
ditioning them posed a special problem.
Carborundum solved it by developing a
grinding wheel made of crushed South
African diamond bort. With this wheel,
cemented carbide tools can be finished
to a better, truer longer-lasting edge
in a fraction of the time formerly
required.


Development of new abrasive products to meet
new needs is an old story with Carborundum.

Although there have been a number
of different processes for the refining of
bauxite, the one most commonly used
is the Bayer process, developed by the
German chemist, Karl Josef Bayer,
about fifty years ago.
ALUMINUM SHORTAGE
{Continued from page 14)
where Al(OH):l is precipitated upon
cooling. The Al(OH).t is then calcined
to produce Al^On.
In an attempt to utilize our abundant
aluminum-bearing clay, a process which
was developed after 10 years of re-
search was reported last November by
Dr. Hixon of Columbia University and

The Hall Process
tluminum Co. of Amrrica
Briefly, the Bayer process consists of
drying and calcining the bauxite to re-
move organic matter which would cause
subsequent solution of some iron during
the caustic treatment, followed by pre-
cipitation with the alumina. The cal-
cined bauxite is ground and mixed
thoroughly with NaOH solution. This
mixed solution is heated in autoclaves
at high pressures to form sodium alum-
inate, which, after being separated from
impurities by settling, is decanted, fil-
tered, and run into decomposing tanks.
will probably be tested in the very near
future.
The Hixon process appears to detour
around the main disadvantages attrib-
uted to the other acid methods. These
are: the use of a dilute acid solution,
loss of the acid, complicated methods of
separating out the iron, and large evap-
orating systems to drive off the huge
amounts of water used.
The process uses concentrated hydro-
chloric acid which can be almost com-
pletely recovered. The organic solvent.
iso-propyl ether, is plentiful and re-
moves the iron satisfactorily. This is
also recovered quite easily. The cost per
ton is $31 claimed for the Hixon process
against $30 to $40 by the orthodox
methods.
Still another process, utilizing the
large quantities of Western alunite ores
(alunite is a hydrated basic potassium
aluminum sulphate, Kl,S04:3A1203:-
3SO3:6HaO) will be put into commer-
cial production some time this year,
with an estimated daily capacity of SO
tons of aluminum ingot.
In the process, alunite, containing
15%-35% Al2O3 is first converted to
potash alum, then changed to a hydrous
basic potassium aluminum sulphate in
an autoclave, finally driving off the sul-
phur ores by calcining and leaching the
soluble K2S04 from insoluble alumina.
All the above described processes are
used only to form aluminum oxide. This
aluminum oxide must still be trans-
formed to the pure metal aluminum.
The Hall process is used almost uni-
versally to achieve this result.
At the present time the Bayer pro-
cess, useful only with high grade ore
(50% of which must be imported) is
used almost exclusively in the United
States. This situation, the Justice de-
partment has undertaken to prove, is
no coincidence. Be that as it may, at the
present rate of consumption, the do-
mestic resources of high-grade bauxite
will be exhausted within six years.
Which all adds up to the fact that the
plentiful supply of aluminum-bearing
clays must be tapped if we are to be
assured of a lasting source of aluminum,
our most crucial metal in World War II.
PETROLEUM PRODUCTS PRODUCTION
thenes. In some cases, due to the com-
plexity of the cracked product, treatment
with selective solvents must be used.
Unfortunately, the entire process is
not as simple as it sounds, for, except
for a few foreign crudes, the amount of
toluene formed when the oil is cracked
by an ordinary process does not exceed
10%, thereby requiring a large amount
of material to be handled to obtain
quantity production. It was found, how-
ever, that in some of the newer methods
of cracking and reforming, the percent-
age of toluene in the cracked or re-
formed gasoline was much larger and
can be made the main instead of the
(Continued from page 11)
secondary product of the reaction. In a
recently - developed hydroforming pro-
cess the raw material is heavy naphtha
which is heated and mixed with a gas
rich in hydrogen. The mixture then
passes through a reaction chamber
charged with a special catalyst and
issues as a product from which is ob-
tained a yield of 80% 80-octane gaso-
line. Since the high octane number of'
this fuel is due to the presence of large
amounts of aromatics (xylene and tolu-
ene), by modifying the process the aro-
matics content can be raised to 80%
with a corresponding increase in the
amount of toluene present.
The chemistry of the process lies in
the conversion of n-heptane, CH3CH2-
CH^CH.CHoCH.CH;. which is plentiful
in the naphthas, to the ring compound
cyclohexane, CH3CH2CH2CH2CHoCH2
by the removal of a hydrogen atom.
Then, further along in the process one
hydrogen is removed from each of the
ring carbons giving toluene, CCH3CH-
CHCHCHCH.
In brief, one may conclude that the
petroleum industry is dependent on other
sources for material and although pro-
cesses and methods of operation are
known, production cannot reach its
peak until material is made available.

breaker test
When several AIEE committees col-
laborated to run short-circuit tests on a
circuit breaker, their work made college
lab "tests" look like the flea on the ele-
phant.
This particular circuit breaker was
rated at 15-kv with an interrupting ca-
pacity of 1,500 megavolt-amperes. Tests
were to be run up to 2,000 megavolt-
amperes, which meant the first problem
was to find enough power. The Hell
Gate station, in New York City, was
chosen as the best laboratory, and addi-
tional tie feeders to the Waterside Sta-
tion and the Niagara-Hudson system
were used to obtain the necessary power
capacity.
A complete analysis of short-circuit
forces was made on all the generators,
circuit breakers, connections, and cables
involved. In one instance a force of
5000 pounds appeared as a cantilever
load on the wall bushings entering one
of the station circuit breakers when the
maximum short-circuit current of 200,-
000 amperes flowed. The bushing was
rated at 600 pounds. Furthermore, a
greater force of 6,000 pounds was calcu-
lated which would tend to open the
breaker against the restraint of its latch-
ing equipment. The breaker was shorted
out to allow the short-circuit current to
flow.
Within the station cable vaults, maxi-
mum instantaneous forces of from 3,700
to 11,500 pounds per foot were calcu-
lated. Suitable bracing and wrapping
were provided to hold these cables se-
curely in place during the short circuit.
Disconnecting switches (distinct from
breakers) in the test circuit were re-
moved and replaced by copper bus work.
More calculations were made to de-
termine the likelihood of instability be-
tween generators following the clearing
of the fault. Assuming the fault would
have to be cleared up by the backup
protection, and might last half a second,

no generator was expected to swing
more than 10 degrees relative to an-
other. This was small enough to elimi-
nate trouble on that score. Voltage dips
were calculated and ran to a maximum
of 40 per cent at one of the substations
during the highest capacity fault.
An air raid type of structure was
erected to house the circuit breaker and
prevent possible damage to adjacent
equipment should an explosion result.
The breaker stood up, however.
An independent three-point communi-
cation system was installed to provide
communication between the test control
station, the generating-station control
board, and the generating-station con-
trol-cable terminal room. A public ad-
dress system was also installed for
general announcements and warnings.
Observers were stationed in the gal-
lery corridors to watch for trouble. Men
were stationed on the throttles of the
turbines should trouble develop in either
the generators or turbines. Observers
were also placed at each street manhole
through which the test feeder was car-
ried, all manhole covers being removed
during the test period. Construction and
maintenance crews stood by during the
tests.
Everything did not happen according
to schedule, several circuit breakers
opening unexpectedly during the first
few tests. These were shorted out for
the remainder. Due to the voltage dip
and frequency variation during the
short circuit, a number of railroad syn-
chronous converters tripped out, but
were restored to service within 41/-; min-
utes. Sparks and flashes in the electrical
galleries occurred at the higher levels
of duty, and were attributed to induced
voltages set up by the test currents. Ad-
ditional clearances stopped the fireworks.
Information obtained from the tests
not only proved the design of the circuit
breaker, but also yielded valuable in-
formation on the effects of a short cir-
cuit upon the entire power supply
system.

HERE IS GOOD NEWS for mixers of cold
beverages for home consumption. A
plastic "package" for ice cubes—a new
type of ice tray—is now on the market.
Each cube of ice is frozen in individual,
removable plastic cups—a cup for con-
tinuous use in each of the twelve com-
partments of the tray. The cups are lifted
from the tray and the cubes are easily
removed with but slight pressure. Cups
are then filled and replaced in the tray.
Convenience, ease of handling, and econ-
omy of ice are among the many practical
advantages.
This advance in ice tray design and con-
struction has been made possible through
the development of Ethocel* Sheeting—a
remarkable member of the Dow plastic
family. First, this particular type of plastic
can be "deep-drawn"—just like metal.
Thus, the cups are formed out of a single
sheet. Second, Ethocel Sheeting stands up
under low temperatures and is not ad-
versely affected by moisture.
Ethylcellulose plastic is one of a host of
basic products produced by Dow. You
will find it at your favorite shops in the
form of handsome packages for all
manner of merchandise.
The application of Ethocel Sheeting to
the ice cube problem illustrates how a
versatile, tough, easily fabricated plastic
can give manufacturers an opportunity
to replace much needed strategic metals
now required elsewhere for the vital
necessities of national defense.
This is the underlying significance of
plastic ice trays and why Dow believes
the entrance of Ethylcellulose plastic into
new fields will help materially to allevi-
ate a serious shortage in other materials.

test on the No. 4 boiler of the Trenton
Channel station. Prof. Marin ran the
last two tests on the Hillside Light and
Power plant after finally inheriting the
job. Dean Cooley was the first to run
tests, with younger members of the fac-
ulty taking over in their order until
Axel was reached.
Prof. Marin's interest in air condi-
tioning and ventilating started when he
was asked to do some research on fan-
cooling a house. Most of his recent
work has been along these lines, includ-
ing the air conditioning of the operat-
ing rooms at the Hospital. Another
problem of air conditioning came his
way as a member of the Board of Con-
trol of Athletics. The water vapor in
the Field house would condense on the
ceiling and drip onto the basketball
floor, presenting a definite hazard to
the players. Axel installed ventilators
in the ceiling and ended the "dew."
For recreation he golfs, playing on
the ME department teams competing
against the EE all-stars. One match
with Prof. Bailey on the EE team
stands out. The ME's won when Prof.
Bailey was thrown off his form because
a student nearly beaned him with a
long shot, in both senses of the word.
Prof. Marin is chairman of the Disci-
pline Committees of both the Engineer-
ing College and of the University, fac-
ulty treasurer as a member of the Ad-
visory Board of Tau Beta Pi, member
of the Research Council of the Amer-
ican Society of Heating and Ventilat-
ing Engineers, has been on a number of
technical committees, and was awarded
the Spoofuncup at the last A.S.M.E.
Roast—on a true story!
Progressive and broad minded in
teaching, Prof. Marin believes the most
important thing is to interest his stu-
dents in their work. He has succeeded
in interesting one individual in engineer-
ing, purposely or accidentally, and thus
he may have his daughter as one of his
students in a few years.

From aircraft engine design to horses,
that's "Joe"—Joseph M. Hallissy, Jr.,
'42 ME. Lakewood, a suburb of Cleve-
land, Ohio, is "home'' to Joe and his
local draft board.

H. A'. .Vc/sob
Joseph M. Hallissy, jr.
Following high school graduation, Joe
decided to specialize in automotive en-
gine design. After considering Case,
Purdue, and Michigan, the widely-
known engineering merits of Michigan
won. With a very successful freshman
year under his belt, the bright future of
the ever-increasing aircraft industry
prompted him to change to aircraft en-
gine design.
Amateur radio work led him to choose
the Signal Corps in the R.O.T.C. He's
a bug for electrical gadgets and has his
room at Theta Xi wired to his whimsi-
cal liking. Among the maze of wires,
pictures of horses, and his roommate's
gun collection, you sight an occasional
book in some far off corner.
Joe never rode a horse before coming
to Ann Arbor, but during his first sum-
mer school started the sport. Although
he now makes "Hoppy" look like an
amateur, he dismounted the hard way
five times during his first hour of solo!
"Sonia" Hallissy is also quite an ice
skater and spends his Christmas vaca-
tions on the blades. In local sports Joe
has been the varsity baseball manager
for three years.
Ever since he has been at Michigan
Joe has had the craving to see the inside
of the auditorium in University Hall.
They say it is locked up for fear of
someone falling through the place, but
we think all those Lit students hiber-
nate there after graduation!
Another of J. H.'s ambitions is to
balance the Engineering class dues rec-
ord, as he is the 1941-42 treasurer for
the Engineering council. Membership in
Scabbard and Blade, A.S.M.E., Army
Ordnance Ass'n., Pi Tau Pi Sigma,
steward of Theta Xi, and varsity base-
ball manager are a few of his outstand-
ing extra curricular activities.
Joe attended summer school after his
sophomore year, and he highly recom-
mends summer session for the fun of
college life that engineers hear so much
about. "The women aren't bad, but be-
ing able to drive a car to the old swim-
ming hole is tops." During his junior
year summer vacation he went with the
R.O.T.C. to Camp Custer.
On graduating this May, Uncle Sam
will be requesting Joe Hallissy's serv-
ices, but after the situation is over he
hopes to return to Michigan for gradu-
ate work in Aero Engineering.
For a few parting words, Joe advises
all freshmen to join a fraternity, take
in a summer session, work like hell, and
remember the P-Bell.
TAU BETA PI AT MICHIGAN
While Professor Higbie was away,
Professor Henry E. Riggs started a very
worthwhile and interesting project, the
results of which are still with us in the
West Engineering Building. Professor
Riggs started hunting up some of the
prominent engineering alumni, with the
co-operation of the members of Tau
Beta Pi, and secured pictures of them
taken at the time of their graduation,
and, later, when they had become suc-

cessful engineers. In this way he was
able to accumulate complete pictures of
most of the early graduating classes.
When the classes were large, the prom-
inent members were picked from Who's
Who in Engineering or Who's Who in
America.
Things were going very smoothly with
the chapter, and for the next few years
Professor Higbie's activities were con-
fined to positions on the Executive
Council. After being vice-president and
treasurer, he was elected president in
1913. He held this position for a while,
and in 1917 refused re-election to re-
turn to a more private life, but the vi-
tality that was given to it at its incep-
tion still characterizes the Michigan
Gamma Chapter, and it is Professor
Higbie's greatest pride that Tau Beta
Pi men stand out among the men of
the University at most every endeavor.

HOW TO SEE RED. ..AND LIKE IT!
Friction .. . arch enemy of speed in the machining of
iron and steel. . . meets its match in cutting tools made of
Haynes Stellite non-ferrous alloys. For these alloys ... of
cobalt, chromium, and tungsten . . . have the amazing
property of "red hardness." Unlike cutting tools made of
ordinary metals, they keep their edge . . . and keep on
cutting . . . even when friction heats them red hot.
Making possible tougher, longer-lasting cutting tools is only one
of the vital roles played by Haynes Stellite materials. Because they
stand up under heat, abrasion, and corrosion, they are used to hard-
face many different kinds of metal parts.
Oil well drilling bits . . . steam shovel bucket lips . . . heavy gears
. . . shafts . . . airplane and truck exhaust valve seats . . . crusher
blades . . . mixers . . . plowshares . . . and other pieces of equipment
that must withstand steady punishment have their lives lengthened
. . . and their efficiency stepped up . . . with welded-on hard-facings
of Haynes Stellite alloys.
Use of Haynes Stellite alloys speeds up production .. . lowers pro-
duction costs . . . saves on tool and part replacements . . . reduces
time lost while replacements are being made. In the fabrication of
new parts, base metals can he selected for such valuable properties as
strength and ductility— without particular regard for wear-resistance
— because they can then be armored against abrasion, heat, and corro-
sion by hard-facing with Haynes Stellite alloys.
Further savings can be made by the use of these alloys because worn
parts can be renewed, instead of being sent to the scrap pile . . . thus
eliminating replacement with materials hard to obtain.
Faster production . . . conservation of metals . . . lower costs . . .
these are the contributions made to industry by Huynes Stellite alloys.
The development of Huynes Stellite Company alloys and hard-facing
practice has been furthered by the metallurgical knowledge of Electro
Metallurgical Company, by the research facilities of Union Carbide
and Carbon Research Laboratories, Inc., and by the service organiza-
tion of The Linde Air Products Company — which companies also are
Units of Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation.

SCHOOL SPIRIT?
WITH much recent discussion on
war effort relative to the Michi-
gan campus, and much more controversy
over the students' present physical
adaptability, certainly a discussion of a
related subject is pertinent. Topics of
such material nature as war effort can-
not be properly considered without in-
troducing the abstract idea of personal
attitude. The student reaction is the
basis of any results which might possi-
bly be attained.
Since the war was declared in Decem-
ber, 1941, student point averages have
noticeably declined, attendance at ath-
letic events is lower than the corre-
sponding periods last year, and partici-
pation in campus activity is decreasing.
Fraternities are noticing that it is more
difficult for rushees to make decisions
which concern their future. In general,
we are in a reactionary period. Too near
to the war to disregard it; to far from
actual influence to absorb prewar de-
sires.
On the other hand, in trying to make
definite adjustments in the curriculum,
so that the University could cooperate
to the fullest extent to train needed
men, the faculty have relentlessly surged
forward. Have they yet stopped to con-
sider the more sluggish assimilating
qualities of the students? It is not a
question of whether the students are
willing to cooperate or not — most of
them are already doing their bit; it is a
question of whether the University can
despotically remove many of those for-
mer pleasures from the grasp of the stu-
dents and yet still expect a maximum of
effort from them.
Our entering freshmen and the under-
classmen who have not yet been on
campus long enough to really compre-
hend what college has to offer, but are
presently existing on false visions of
what college life should be as portrayed
by the movies, have little chance to ex-
press themselves by word or deed as
their predecessors. Even three years ago
such blase activities as Black Friday
and Class Games were on their way out.
Now the practice of having outdoor so-
ciety initiations is slowly being re-
stricted. Soon the students will have no
mode of active outward expression other
than class recitations and bluebooks.
If these activities were restricting
other effort directed toward defense,
there obviously would be legitimate
cause for authoritative objection. Re-
cently, a general statement abolishing
"country club parties" was published by
the University administration. More re-
cently, an engineering professor pro-
voked discussion by suggesting that
even formal clothes be discarded admit-
ting in the same breath that he had
worn his lux the previous week-end in
order that he follow popular demand.
Are these points which have been
brought up the real basis for improving
the defense work of our campus?
Our suggestion for possible improve-
ment is that a constructive program of
increasing the friendly attitude of the
people on the campus replace the pres-
ent tendencies toward restriction of
activity. Most people ask only to be
considered human beings and without
doubt, Michigan students are human.
They have had most of their good quali-
ties buried, however, by a stiffness, an
instilled superiority which has been in-
grained since their arrival here. How can
the University officials expect the maxi-
mum effort toward defense projects in
this atmosphere?
Michigan is noted the world over for
its educational accomplishments. We
should further that record by a cordial
and friendly spirit among ourselves to
be demonstrated naturally to our guests.
With the new feeling of friendliness,
athletic events will have greater attend-
ance, people will speak to strangers on
campus with a friendly smile, and every-
one will wonder why something like this
had not been invoked before. School spirit
rises, the students' ideas are more nearly
congruent with those of the administra-
tion, and when some special effort on
the part of the students is needed,
namely the defense of America, then
the response will be effluent not in hol-
low words but in concrete work done.
Think of your neighbor occasionally
and be a humane individual at all times;
these are the precepts resulting from the
above considerations.

Photographic Surveying began in this country about 50 years ago with the University of Michigan offering a fundamental
course for over twenty years and an advanced course during the past 11 years. The camera has been a valuable aid to engineers
engaged in field surveys since photographs make the best record of physical conditions in the field and of the character and
quality of monuments. It is natural that the field engineers keep a record of the progress cf construction by means of frequent
photographs. Today the availability of the airplane and special cameras for taking photographs from the air represent a
highly efficient and specialized technique of surveying. Students who complete the basic courses in our college, together
with a broad training in the fundamentals of surveying, may soon qualify as experts in particular fields as they complete the
necessary specialized training involved.

A I ,S, submarine is essentially an electric-propelled
vehicle, and an amazing amount of electric equipment
is packed away in its steel hull. Responsibility tor opera-
tion, maintenance, and repair of all this electric equip-
ment is in the hands ot two classes ot petty officers chiet
electrician's mates and electrician's mates first cl
For years General Electric has collaborated with the
Navj in providing instruction tor such men. They arc
shown how all kinds ot equipment aboard their ships is
built and assembled. Thus petty officers are better quali-
fied both to care tor electric propulsion and other appara-
tus in normal service and to repair it in case ot emcr
gency, This training has lately been accelerated. (• (.

men, and in the past two years more rli tj 'meets

The fixture contains a 10-watt lamp, so concealed that
the only light visible comes through a circular narrow
piece of plastic around the side. A projecting black canopv
screens the light from the eyes ot aviators. The light out-
put, equivalent to that from a single candle flame, seems
at first sight to be practically zero. But after a little time
eyes become adjusted, as they do in a movie theatre,
and objects can be dimly seen 30 to 40 feet away. Speci-
fications for the new lamp are based on the experieno
the British in their blackouts.

IN the early days of electric lights, economical city
fathers used to turn out the street lamps on nights
when there was a full moon, l-'or the best blackout tech

ELECTRON WHIRLIGIG
WHETHER you call it a "rheotron" or "betatron"
or by its longer name of "induction electron
accelerator," a new science tool recently built by Dr.
Donald W. Kerst in the G-E Research Laboratory 1
of the world's most potent merry -go-rounds. On it
electrons ride to a speed closely approximating that ol
light equivalent to that produced bv 20 million volts.
Copper bombarded by these dizzy, super-speed electrons
becomes temporarily radioactive, and other interesting
possibilities are being investigated.
Dr. kerst, young professor at the University of Illinois,
got the idea tor the device, built a small model, and came
to General Klectric to-build a bigger one. Like the much-
publicized cyclotron, except that it accelerates electrons
instead of positive ions, the device chases the charged
particles round and round in a magnetic field, adding to
their speed at ever) revolution. Scientists are reticent
about predicting what the rheotron's chiet use will be,
but it is promising enough so that a bigger one is being
built in the G-E laboratory lor speeds ot 100 million \

America's unlimited source of
agnesium
EVEN TODAY with astronomical figures
a commonplace, nine billion is a number
sufficiently vast to jolt the attention of
anyone except, perhaps, an astrophysicist.
Imagine trying to count up to nine
billion! Vet that is the total you would
have to reach if you counted every pound
of magnesium that could be produced
from a cubic mile of sea water.
When you recall that magnesium, lightest
of all structural metals, is vital to the con-
struction of airplanes and other war-time
equipment, you begin to realize the im-
portance of those nine billion pounds.
And when you read also that the produc-
tion of airplanes to be reached by the end
of 1913 is set at 18 5,000, it is reassuring
that the ocean can be looked to for this
precious weight-saving metal.
Magnesium is now being extracted from
sea water. The metal has been rolling out
since January, 1941—a chemical and
engineering feat accomplished for the
first time in history.
Fortunately, for our national defense
program, Dow had been producing mag-
nesium from brine since 1915. This had
given American industry 2 5 years of
experience in the characteristics and
fabricating technique of magnesium.
It was this quarter century of magnesium
production by its own American-devel-
oped processes that enabled Dow to
solve the chemical engineering problem

of tapping the inexhaustible waters of the
sea as a basic magnesium source.
Within nine months after construction
started on the coastal plant, the ocean
was giving up its treasure. The waters of
the sea were pouring in and the metal
was rolling out in ever-mounting volume.

In July, 1935, the above caption was used for a circular describing a
problem on the development of a use for a waste product. A manu-
facturer, after reading the circular, telephoned us about a product
of low salvage value which he was producing. A research project was
started which resulted in a product duplicating an imported one.
While the results were profitable to the manufacturer, their true value
was not realized fully until the war shut off the foreign source of
supply.
Much of the sponsored research at the University today is directly
connected with the war effort and some of these projects have as their
objective the replacement of strategic materials with those made
from wastes or low value products.
The laboratory facilities of the University are made available to in-
dustry for sponsored researches through the Department of Engineer-
ing Research.

... In answer to Herr Hitler's plan
for troop movements by glider, Britain
has formulated a similar plan to out-axis
the axis. Close collaboration with the
R.A.F. will be maintained so that the
gliders will have a means of propulsion.
No particulars have been released.
. . . Subtle camoflage: An airplane
parts factory in Germany has gone to no
end of trouble to make itself appear to
be a dummy plan. Blackouts are naively
incomplete, artificial chimneys emit os-
tentatious volumes of smoke, outside
obviously faked airplanes line an ob-
viously unused airdrome. The greatest
success of the venture has been reported
by employees and their girl friends who
find the unused dummy planes a great
convenience.
. . . That phosphorus concentrates on
the surfaces of blow-holes in iron and
steel has recently been proved by using
radio-active phosporus isotope instead
of ordinary phosporus. The rays emitted
by the phosporus were intercepted by a
photographic plate and found to corres-
pond to the blow-holes in the steel.
. . . Uncle Sam's newest headache is
finding storage and shipping space for
his ever-increasing quantity of war prod-
ucts. Arms and armament are piling up
at wharves on both coasts and are back-
ing up in many inland plants. At one
dock in the East, 40,000 military trucks
stand ready for shipment.
. . . The middle of April found esti-
mated steel production at 99.0 per cent
of capacity, a new all-time high. Look
ous axis! The lumbering democratic
giant is beginning to roll.
. . . Two new war plants will use
wooden trusses; two others, concrete pil-
lars to divert valuable steel to more vital
use.
. . . Requests to build a 1,050 mile
pipe line from Wichita, Texas to Savan-
nah, Georgia were turned down because
of "imperative steel requirements of the
war effort." The proposed line would
call for 85,000 net tons of steel.
... An emergency auto wheel has been
devised to replace flat tires. The wheel
can be quickly and easily fastened to the
hub and will enable wifey to drive short
distances to the nearest garage without
ruining a perfectly good casing.
. . . Although labor has had several
black eyes lately and the great union
barons have been accused of getting in
some low punches, the American worker
has shown his true colors. With produc-
tion figures skyrocketing, one company
broke 521 records since Pearl Harbor;
another 127 records.
. . . Two large companies recently con-
verted to war work are experimenting
with new types of tires. One type re-
quires only 1/16 the usual amount of
rubber, the other is entirely rubberless.
... At a recent hearing of the Justice
Department's anti-trust division, a cer-
tain American firm testified that its af-
filiation with Germany's Krupp interests
has increased the production and low-
ered the price of American tungsten-car-
bide. It just doesn't add up.

To Win A War


Behind the guns—behind the machines and the motors
that drive them — is steam, "prime mover" of all
industry. • Each time we find a way to squeeze an
extra B.T.U. from a pound of coal or a gallon of oil,
industrial output is accelerated and implements of
war rush sooner to waiting hands at the front. Because
B&amp;W engineers have always been the first to origi-
nate major improvements in boilers, Babcock &amp;
Wilcox has become America's largest producer of
steam generating equipment. • Today, all our efforts
are devoted to helping
utilities and industrial
plants produce the pow-
er to win this war. In
the victorious tomorrow,
we shall stand ready to
serve you whose hands
will guide the future of
American industry.

. . . The newest step in the production
of fire retardant paint is a product which
contains white lead as pigment with

... A new sponge or powdered form
of chromium recently produced is said
to be 99.8 per cent pure. The new pro-
cess is effective using either low or high
grade chromite ores, thereby permitting
the utilization of a large amount of
American "off-grade" chromite. The
proverbial wrench in the machinery,
however, is the availability and cost of
chlorine which is the chief factor in the
production of this high grade metal.
. . . Latest use for the electron micro-
scope is the examination, after special
preparation of samples, of metal alloys.
The first secret revealed by the micro-
scope was the determination of the struc-
ture of martensite. It was found to be
composed of iron and iron carbide in al-
ternate layers of about 100 atoms in
thickness.

. . . American cooperation in war time:
A shipment of special grade ball bearing
steel wire was lost recently when the ship
which was carrying it was torpedoed.
The British company needed the steel
within four days to make bearings for
badly needed tanks. After some quick
trans-Atlantic phone calls ingots were
made the next day in an electric furnace
in the mid-west and rolled to rods; the
rods were shipped by special truck to
New England for drawing to wire; the
wire was rushed by another special truck
to another plant for heat-treating and
was flown to England in time to be de-
livered on schedule.
... In the construction of a cold-
rolling mill in Los Angeles, an interest-
ing innovation is reported. Instead of
the usual column construction, columns
made of three "I" beams arranged to
form an "H" were used. The pieces were
welded together.
. . . The field of electronics is now a
defender of democracy. That the food of
a field army comes largely out of that
great American institution, the tin can,
is common knowledge; and since an
army marches on its stomach, something
must be done to insure against imper-
fectly tinned cans. This is the duty of
electronics. When the sheet steel races
off the processing machines at 1,000 feet
per minute an electronic devise detects
and marks pin holes in the plating.
... A pH recorder charts on a graph
the pH change over any period of time
and shows a continuous picture of the
fluid-flow system.
... A stainless steel, 10.0 per cent
chromium and 8.0 per cent nickel, if
quenched isn't magnetic until about two
minutes after it enters the magnetic field,
at which time it suddenly jumps toward
the magnet. The effect is partially ex-
plained by a delay in the atomic rear-
rangement.
. . . Much as the potter spins clay in
order to mold it into graceful shapes,
pre-heated steel tubes rotated at high
speed are molded into bombs by the
force exerted on a huge steel ram.

behind Grand Coulee Dam will for the

it releases nitrogen which in turn forms
nitric acid with hydrogen and oxygen

in rain drops and falls to the earth,

magnesium amounted to no more than a
few hours at our present rate of produc-
tion. Newest contributors to this Hercu-
lean task are several plants in Texas
which are extracting the valuable metal
from sea water pumped from the Gulf
of Mexico. Magnesium hydrate is pre-
cipitated from the water, converted to
magnesium chloride, and reduced to
magnesium by a direct current electro-
lytic process. Formerly, rotary conver-
ters were used to change alternating cur-
rent into direct current, but mercury arc
rectifiers housed in steel tanks have
largely replaced the older converters.

Further application of the new develop-
ment might be infra-red lamps placed
above the bed as a substitute for blan-
kets.
. . . Once again U. S. Army Air Force
engineers have set the pace for new de-
velopments. This time it is "dual rota-
tion" propellers. Although this is not an
entirely new concept, the army claims
far more progress than has previously
been reported. The propeller is divided
into two parts, one turning clockwise the
other counterclockwise. The front half
sets up air swirls that make the "bite"
of the other propeller more efficient.
Contrary to many opinions, the new pro-
peller will not complicate but rather
simplify airplane design. Ordinary pro-
pellers churn the air in one direction and
thus create a spiral air current which re-
volves about the plane's surfaces causing
undo resistance. This effect will be
largely eliminated by the new blades.
The dual propeller will also simplify
mounting the engine to resist strain.
... At a large U. S. arsenal, Army
Ballistics technicians are now employing
x-rays to photograph the flight and im-
pact of bullets. The new type x-ray ma-
chine differs from ordinary units in that
it can deliver a charge of 2,000 amperes
at 300,000 volts in a millionth of a sec-
oud; therefore, cutting down the time of
penetration of steel 10,000 times.
... A special balance for studying rate
of corrosion of metals has been devised
which can determine the weight of a sin-
gle layer of oxygen atoms approximately
10/l,000,000,000ths of an inch thick.
. . . English gasworks and other simi-
lar industries are slowly solving the pe-
troleum shortage problem by substitut-
ing viscous tar and pitch for more vital
fuels.
... To vary the light intensity on air-
craft instrument panels two polaroid
lenses—one on a rotating axis—are em-
ployed. This new method replaces the
older practice of using a variable re-
sistance in series with each lamp. Ad-
justable intensity is necessary so that
at night the light is not blinding and in
daylight it is brighter than the light
reflected from the instrument lenses.

By
C. FREEMAN ALEXANDER, '43E
SINCE the time when man devel-
oped the first mechanical prime
mover, he has constantly been in search
of new sources of power. During the
search, he has found many, but only a
few of these have been successfully har-
nessed. Some of these sources are be-
ing used for our needs today, some will
be exploited in the future, and many
will undoubtedly be discarded as "use-
less for all practical purposes." The
methods that are used today are used
simply because they are feasible from
both the engineering and economic
standpoints. This must be true, of
course, of all future developments.
Hundreds of thousands
of dollars and many years
time have been spent by
reputable engineers in an
effort to make some of
these methods industrially
practical. This article will
discuss proposed machines
for each of the new unde-
veloped sources and state
briefly the relative impor-
tance and possible future
for each of the present
means of power develop-
ment.
SOLAR
In the year 1860, Mou-
chot proposed the first
solar engine. His plan
was to construct a large
shallow reservoir to be
used as a heating unit for water by
means of the sun's rays. This reservoir
was to be located on the shore of a
particular lake noted for its cold water.
The warm water, whose temperature
was 50 degrees C, was to boil at low
pressure and drive some sort of con-
densing steam engine. The condenser
water could be gotten directly from the
cold, unheated water of the lake. A
thermal head of 39.6 degrees Fahr.
would be available at such a plant and
Mouchot reasoned that if efficiencies
could be kept up, this would be the
power plant of the future. In 1878, he
actually built an experimental plant
which produced about .5 HP.
Five years later, Ericsson, of New
York, set up some similar apparatus
which had an output of 3.25 HP. Both
of these men employed parabolic mir-
rors for collecting the sun light in their
experimental machines.
The next work was done by Willsie
at Needles, California, in 1908-09. He
employed water to collect the heat from
the sunlight and then used this water
to heat sulfur dioxide which was the ther-
modynamic medium. His machine gave
20 HP.

Cyclotron, Laboratory for Atomic Power
Shuman came forth with a new slant
on the same idea in 1911. He planned
to spread the water in a thin sheet as
Mouchot had done and intensify the
sunlight falling on it by means of plane
mirrors. This method would be cheaper
and perhaps work as well. His first
plant was set up at Tacony and with
the aid of 10,300 sq. ft. of absorbing
surface, he developed about 20 HP.
Two years later he set up a similar
plant near Cairo and using 19,000 sq.
ft. of absorbing surface, he got 40 HP.
The last plant mentioned here cost
about $140.00 per brake HP. From
data gathered from these two test plans,
Shuman estimated that a 1,000 HP
plant could be constructed for $40,000.
At the time of the experiments, the
price of coal in Egypt was $2.40 per
ton so Shuman believed that this was
an economical means of generating
power.
More recently, Abbot and other en-
gineers have been improving on these
ideas and attempting to increase effi-
ciencies. Perhaps someday we may be
able to utilize some of the vast quan-
tities of energy that are being show-
ered on our deserts. A single square
mile is capable of giving
us about a million HP for
a year round, night and
day average.
By a photochemical
process, we may someday
be able to transform the
radiant energy of the sun
to potential chemical en-
ergy, by means of a suit-
able catalyst, and then to
electrical energy as is
done in a primary bat-
tery. Needless to say, the
catalysts are as yet undis-
covered. What is needed
is a process that will be
perfectly reversible and
involve materials whose
cost is not too great.
WIND
The power of the winds was prob-
ably first used in crude sail boats. Then
came the sail-type windmill that is so
common in Holland today. Very little
improvement was made for hundreds of
years. Next came the "American type"
with properly shaped steel blading which
is seen on so many farms. This "utility"
windmill is used principally for pumping
water and in similar operations where
fluctuations of power output is not a dis-
advantage. In more recent years, a pro-

speed applications. This wheel can be
directly attached to a small generator
and thereby supply current for farm
lighting. The trouble with this type of
wheel, however, is that a wind of 7-9
miles per hr. is required to start it. A
considerable part of the time the wheel
will be idle.
Anton Flettnor came forth in the
1920's with a possible solution to this
problem. His idea is to substitute a
cylinder rotating about its longitudinal
axis for the vanes in a windmill and
also for the sails of a ship. This rotor
will be subject to a force perpendicular
to the direction of the wind by the
Magnus Effect. This is the same force
that causes a spinning tennis ball to
curve in flight. The "Flettner Rotor,"
as it was called, was first mounted on
a tiny 3-foot test ship. The rotor was
spun on its axis by means of a clock
motor. After this experimental suc-
cess, much work was carried on both
in the laboratory and under field con-
ditions. In an attempt to prove the
worth of his invention to the skeptics,
Fleetnor built the 3,000 ton rotor-ship
"Barbara." This ship could be entirely
propelled by three vertical rotors which
had diameters of 13'2" and wereS6'l"
in height. The power required to spin
the rotors was less than 10% of the
total power derived from the wind.
In a wind of about 20 miles an hour
the rotor would propel the ship at 10J4
knots. Supplementing the rotors in
times of calm were two diesel engines,
which acting alone could drive the ship
at 10 knots. Thus, the rotors would be
supplementing and not replacing the
engines of the ship. Flettnor believed
that there would be a considerable eco-
nomic gain with such a ship. As proof
of her merits, the "Barbara" competed
successfully for several years with other
commercial cargo ships. Although that
type of ship was to have no future be-
cause of the economies of the modern
steam turbine, it did demonstrate a
revolutionary idea for the extraction of
power from the winds.
A giant windmill was Flettnor's next
application of his rotor. Since the the-
oretical horsepower of any windmill
varies as the square of the diameter and
the cube of the wind velocity, it is de-
sirable to construct as large a wheel as
possible. The difficulty of the existing
type was that its projected area had to
be large for a reasonable efficiency. In
a high wind the windmill would "run
away" or be completely demolished. As
Flettnor's rotor presented only l/10th
of the projected area for the same diam-
eter and as the horsepower extracted
could be regulated by the axial spin of
the rotor, it was ideally suited to large
sizes. The first experimental rotor
windmill had a wheel 65 feet in diam-
eter composed of four equally spaced,
conically shaped rotors. The slowly
revolving wheel drove an electric gen-
erator through a 100:1 transmission.
The generator was specially designed
so as to give nearly a constant voltage
over widely varying speeds. The unit
was wired directly to the transmission
line. Besides excellent control and
safety in high winds, the machine had
the advantage of being able to start in
very low winds by increasing axial ro-
tation. These superior characteristics
were accompanied by a relatively high
efficiency at all speeds.
Savonius became interested in the
Fleetnor rotor in 1927 and conducted
some experiments of his own. In the
first of these, he split a rotor longitudi-
nally and displaced its halves so as to
form an "S" in cross section. This ar-
rangement was found to revolve on its
axis in an air stream. Next,, he moved
the halves part of the way back to their
original position. This had the effect
of eliminating drag which increased the
rotational speed and efficiency of the
rotor. From numerous tests Savonius
determined that his rotor was 70%
better, area for area, than the six foot
standard American windmill.
In testing all sizes of the "S" rotor
he got efficiencies ranging up to 37%
while the standard American ran from
5% to 10%. The "S" rotor may be
constructed to revolve at nearly any
speed by varying the ratio of the diam-
eter to the altitude for any projected
area, a higher ratio giving a slower ro-
tational speed. Savonius predicted that
his rotor would probably never be used
in larger sizes but would provide "stiff
competition" for the smaller units as
used on the American farm.
After Flettnor and Savonius had an-
nounced the results of their work to
the world, many designs were proposed
for large wind power plants. One of
these was to have a one hundred foot
wheel mounted on a 265 ft. tower. The
wheel was to be composed of four Flett-
nor rotors with a small "S" rotor on
the end of each. Thus, the plant would
be completely driven by the wind. At
22.5 m.p.h. the wheel would reach its
maximum output of 136.5 k.w. For any
increase in wind the output would re-
main constant.
The only large unit in use in the
United States today is the Smith-Putnam
wind turbine on Grandpa's Knob near
Rutland, Vermont. It is an experimental
plant from which valuable data will be
obtained to be used in the future con-
struction of other plants. A wind of 30
mph will operate the turbine at rated
capacity of 1000 kw and investigations
show that this wind will prevail more
than half of the year. The turbine wheel
is 175 feet from tip to tip and is mounted
on a tower 120 feet high. The individual
blades of the wheel are shaped like air-
plane wings and are 65 feet in length
and 12 feet wide. Excessive speeds of
rotation are prevented by automatic
feathering and coning of the blades in
high winds. Every conceivable protec-
tive device has been incorporated in this
installation and many of these can prob-
ably be dispensed with after enough
operating experience has been gained.
WATER
The potential energy of the available
water power in the world is something
that is often overestimated. If all avail-
able streams were harnessed, only 4%
of the world's power could be devel-
oped. Furthermore, most hydro-elec-
tric plants can only justify their exist-
ence because of their value in flood con-
trol. Although a great deal of capital
has been invested in such projects, and
as a large power source for the future.
WAVES
The harnessing of ocean waves is un-
doubtedly more interesting than prac-
tical. One of the earliest wave motors
to be proposed and actually built had
as its essential part a huge spherical
float which rode on the waves at the
end of a pivoted arm. The oscillating
motion of this float was transmitted to
a reciprocating pump by an arrange-
ment of cables. The pump delivered
into an elevated tank which acted as a
power reservoir. A water turbine lo-
cated in the same house with the pump
worked steadily, or at any desired rate,
from the water in the tank. The prin-
cipal difficulty with such a plant was
that the power derived was quite small
for the capital outlay.
Another wave motor of little practi-
cal value derives its power from the
inertia of the incoming waves instead
of their vertical motion. A huge fun-
nel protrudes from the beach out into
the wave. Connected to this is a length

at the other end. As the waves come
in, their inertia forces will be directed
by the funnel so as to force water into
the air chamber under pressure. From
the chamber the water will rise to an
elevated tank from which it may be
used as in the previous scheme. Again,
the power output is too small for the
initial expense to say nothing of main-
tenance and repair, the inevitable re-
sults of bad weather and rough waters.
Savonius suggests the use of his rotor
for small wave power installations as it
will work equally well in any fluid. The
rotor is capable of utilizing surging cur-
rents of water as its direction of rota-
tion will always be the same regardless
of the direction of the motivating water.
A device of this sort is in actual use at
an aquarium in France. It employs
three rotors of one square meter each to
pump water against a 200 ft. head. In
small applications and in particular
places the unit will probably prove eco-
nomical.
NATURAL THERMAL HEAD
One of the most interesting schemes
for obtaining power was developed by
M. Georges Claude, the famous French
engineer. It has long been known that
the temperature of the sea remains
fairly constant, and that the farther
down one goes from the surface, the
colder the water gets. This is due to
the sluggish movement of water from
the poles of the earth toward the equa-
tor in the ocean depths and the heat-
ing of the surface water by the sun. M.
Claude's idea was to utilize this tem-
perature difference by means of a heat
engine operating with sea water at a
very low pressure as the thermodynamic
medium. He first demonstrated the
possibilities of this idea before his fel-
low members of the Academy of Sci-
ences in Paris. The apparatus used was
similar to that shown in Fig. 1. Water
is forced up into the low pressure boiler
by atmospheric pressure from the hot
water reservoir "A". Upon entrance
into the boiler the warm water boils
with explosive violence. The steam
thus formed travels toward the lower
pressure condenser where cold water is
forced in by the atmosphere from reser-
voir "B". The steam turbine from
which the power is extracted is placed
in the connecting steam line. Thus, we
have all of the essentials of a heat en-
gine and have disposed of many things
that would reduce efficiency when we
have such a low "thermal head."
Following this success, Claude set up
a more practical unit in Ougree, Bel-
gium. He used a 60 k.w. low pressure
turbine which ran at 5000 r.p.m. After

ROY MATTERN, '42E
'D ATEN'T law today is so vital to the
*• progress of research that all men, es-
pecially engineers, should have some
conception of its importance and appli-
cation. It is not the purpose of this
article to deal with any of the minute
intricacies often involved in obtaining
and safely securing patents, but to give
the highlights of the fundamentals and
importance of patent law.
Because a good share of the time and
capital invested in search of new in-
ventions is spent with the expectation
of a fair return on the outlay, the pri-
mary purpose of the patent laws to the
inventor is the assurance that he will
have a monopoly on the production of
his invention for a period of seventeen
years However, to get a true picture
of the purpose of the patent laws it is
necessary to consider that this protec-
tion for the successful results of the re-
search carried on by individuals and
business enterprises is vitally important
to the future of research, and if patent
rights were eliminated the only way re-
turns on investments in research could
be realized would be through secret use
of the invention. Because of the un-
certainty of maintaining the secrecy,
capital would not be used extensively
in research.
The existence of patent law in this
country dates back to the time of the
ratification of the present Federal Con-
stitution, in which Congress was given
the power to promote the progress of
science and useful arts by securing for
limited times to inventors the exclusive
right to their discoveries. Under the
patent law principles established, an in-
vention in order to have been considered
patentable, necessarily incorporated an
original idea, new and useful within the
meanings of the statue. An invention
was not new if it was previously
known or used by others or described
in a patent in this or any foreign coun-
try. However, the invention would be
considered new if the prior knowledge
of it was secret, incomplete or forgot-
ten, if the use was experimental, or if
accidental and the significance was not
realized.
An invention is useful if it will pro-
duce a result of benefit to the public.
It is not considered useful if capable
only of producing a result which is un-
desirable on the ground of public pol-
icy. The invention must be operative
but not need be entirely practical, effi-
cient, or of definite commercial value.
It is strange to observe that the primary
rules relating to invention tell what is
not invention and what is not patent-
able. Materials or processes occurring
in nature, laws of nature, abstract ideas,
and methods of doing business, for ex-
ample, are not patentable.
A patent is not granted on any novel
idea but must fall into one of four
classes of patentable inventions: an art,
machine, manufacture, composition of
matter, or any new and useful improve-
ments of them.
The term "art" in the patent laws
means a chemical or physical process
other than a process of nature, such as
a procedure for making soap, nitroglyc-
erine, extracting gold, or making steel.
It can even include mechanical proc-
esses such as a method for expanding
metals, but will not ordinarily include
a result that is merely the function or
operation of a machine.
"Machine" means a combination of
stationary and moving mechanical ele-
ments adapted to receive power and
apply it to a useful purpose, or, briefly,
any device for transmitting or trans-
forming energy. It need not be auto-
matic, but usually the parts move
through a regular cycle or cycles of
operation. Machines may include steam
engines, typewriters, dynamos, or a host
of other familiar devices.
A "manufacture" is an article not
occuring in nature and not having its
own definite principle of action. Barbed
wire, razors, and even bridges may be
considered in this class
The term "composition of matter"
means a mixture or chemical combina-
tion of materials such as gunpowder or
nitroglycerin.
If an invention will fulfill the above
requirements, the inventor may apply
for a patent if he is not employed in
the United States Patent Office. The
application for a patent must be filed
by the actual inventor with the Com-
missioner of Patents. A full descrip-
tion of the invention, illustrated when
possible, must be contained in the ap-
plication, along with the full claim
pointing out the reason why the inven-
tion is patentable. If his claim is valid,
his invention being new and useful and
the product of his inventive faculty, the
Patent Office will grant the applicant his
patent.
The purpose of the patent laws is to
encourage invention, and it is believed
that they have been effective in produc-
ing this result. However, there is an
increasing need for the revision of the
patent laws to eliminate the unnecessary
intricacies and apparent mystifications
that prevail. Some law cases involving
infringement of patent rights have been
known to last for twenty or more years
and in some cases have outlasted the
referee hearing the case, necessitating
starting again from the beginning. The
job of reorganization of the patent laws
is one that challenges a man who has
had the benefit of an engineering train-
ing.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


AIRCRAFT
'I 'HE present conflict has revealed
-*• the difficulties encountered by the
entire aircraft industry concerning the
problem of mass production. The
method of increasing production at the
present is solely that of increasing floor
space, machine tools and jigs, and the
payroll of highly skilled labor. An-
other method, however, which is com-
ing to be realized by the engineers, con-
sists of a radical change in production
methods and materials. This new type
of construction will utilize plastics as
basic materials; will require fewer jigs
and less expensive machinery; will
necessitate shorter time and fewer and
less highly specialized personnel.
Since the accidental discov-
ery of celluloid, and shortly fol-
lowing the development of
phenol resins, the aircraft in-
dustry has realized that one
day these materials will have
reached a stage of development
suitable for aircraft structures.
These materials are referred to
as phenol formaldehydes.
This all came about in the
days of all-wood construction.
Then came a period in which
plywood structures were prom-
inent, since they were a consid-
erable advance over the former
all-wood structure. Plywoods
never reached the popularity
which was rightly due them be-
cause of the lack of adequate
binders. With progress in the field of
metallurgy came the advent of the all-
metal stressed-skin structure of light
aluminum alloys. As a result, all plas-
tic developments were shelved as far
as this industry was concerned.
Now, with the entire field in a di-
lemma as to the means to increase pro-
duction, engineers again realize the
value of a plastic molded structure.
These plastics have reached a stage of
development such that we now have
available a series of plastics with ex-
cellent properties. For this reason,
thermo-setting plastics of the phenol-
resin type will take their place as basic

materials for new aircraft structures.
The presentation here will be limited
to a consideration of the manufacturing
processes of the basic "raw" material,
its physical properties, the suitability
of its application to structural part,
and production.
MANUFACTURE
A true plastic is a wood or other base
veneer in which the resin completely im-
pregnates the base. All others should be
called semi-plastics or improved woods,
wood or other base veneer in which the
resin completely impregnates the base.
All others are called semi-plastics.

Drawing hy M. Lfttt-Koop
Figure No. 1
Semi-plastics
The basis for all these products is
a phenolic resin or phenolic resin glue.
Essentially it is produced by a care-
fully controlled chemical reaction be-
tween formaldehyde and a phenol, such
as carbolic acid or cresylic acid. For
use as glue, this reaction is stopped at
the proper stage and it is then placed
between sheets of veneer before the re-
action is resumed. This glue resembles
a dry shellac. It is sometimes used in
powdered form, but more often it is
dissolved in water or alcohol and ap-
plied to the veneer as a spray or with
a roll spreader. Still another method
of application is to impregnate a thin
paper with the resin, which is then
dried and stored in rolls for later use.
Such a glue will keep, so long as it
remains dry and relatively cool. How-
ever, if the temperature rises slightly
above the boiling point, the reaction
which was interrupted during manufac-
ture will again resume. The glue first
becomes soft and will flow under pres-
sure. As the reaction proceeds to com-
pletion, the product hardens and be-
comes what is commercially known as
"bakelite." This product is insoluble
in water, dilute acid and alkalies, and
in many of the common organic sol-
vents such as alcohol, benzine and ether.
A good grade of semi-plas-
tic or phenolic resin glued ply-
wood demands the proper bal-
ance between several variables
such as the glue, pressure, tem-
perature, time, and the mois-
ture. Even glue distribution is
essential. The time and tem-
perature required depend upon
the glue structure, the panels
themselves, and the rapidity of
heating. Pressure is dependent
upon the thickness of the ve-
neer, the rapidity of heating
and the moisture.
Phenolic resin glue when
properly set by heat and pres-
sure is a hard inert solid which
does not deteriorate with time
or exposure; it has no injurious
effect upon the wood, it is not attacked
by fungi, and termites avoid it; it does
not soften when soaked, boiled, or
heated dry. Nevertheless, the base
wood is subject to the effects of mois-
ture and other deteriorating variables.
PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
Semi-plastics
Among the semi-plastics, phenol
resins have the most desirable charac-
teristics of this class. As was previ-
ously mentioned, the bond is unaffected
by all deteriorants normally encoun-
tered in aircraft. The material is quite
light and has a specific gravity only
MAY 1942
13


Woods have specific gravities of about
.8 and the finished plywood about .9.
The strength-weight ratio has been
found to be a function of the ratio
Young's modulus (E) to the specific
gravity (W). The higher this ratio,
(E/W), the more suitable the product.
In wood, Young's modulus is fairly con-
stant; therefore, to increase the ratio
it is desirable to keep the specific grav-
itl as low as is possible. Plac-
ing the plys at a carefully pre-
determined angle tends to raise
the modulus (E).
The bond is strong and yet
it is sufficiently pliable so that
when used in sheets it can be
readily formed in a semi-heated
condition. The chief advantage
realized is the ease of working
the material. It may be treated
as any other plywood, neverthe-
less, it still retains its tendency
to split on working. The chief
disadvantage in the use of the
bonded plywood lies in the ne-
cessity for a large safety factor.
This factor of safety is essen-
tial in view of the imperfections
inherent in the wood itself. This
fact makes it necessary to test each lot
to insure uniformity of the resulting
product. The full plastic does not have
these disadvantages.
True Plastics
If the plywood veneer be coated out-
side as well as between layers and sub-
jected to the same treatment the result
is a true thermo-setting plastic, if all
the variables are properly balanced.
The necessary condition for a true plas-
tic is that the base be completely im-
pregnated with the resin. This plastic
is readily molded, which, as will be
shown presently, is a considerable ad-
vantage.
In the manufacture of such a prod-
uct, considerable expensive equipment
is necessary. Such expenditure is a
result of the need for complete impreg-
nation of the base by the resin; i.e.,
the need of driving the plastic into cells
already filled with air and water in the
case of wood plastics. With this ma-
terial it has been found advantageous
to use a partial vacuum to take out the
air and water. The wood cells are re-
filled with phenol resin under a pres-
sure of 2200 pounds per square inch
and a temperature of 350 degrees Fah-
renheit. Under these conditions the
resulting product is a homogeneous ma-
terial.
Considerable difficulty has been en-
countered in heating the core to the
proper temperature for the required
time without charring the outer sec-
tions. One company has developed
high-frequency apparatus to conduct
uniform heat to the entire section with-
out charring. This process is particu-
larly applicable to thick sections, such
as would be encountered in propeller
blades, but it can be used to consider-

Drawing by M. Ltnt-Koop
Figure No. 2
able advantage even in thin plywood-
base sections to insure proper tempera-
ture control.
The final product needs little or no
finishing and it has very good resist-
ance to abrasion. It is waterproof, inert
to the action of mild acids, alkalies, and
organics such as gasoline and oil, as
might be encountered in airplane opera-
tion. There are other forms of the true
plastic, however, which offer possibili-
ties for aircraft uses. The bases which
are most commonly used for these are
paper, cloth, wood flour and asbestos.
For general structures it will be shown
that the wood-veneer base will form
the most practical type of plastic.
The full impregnated plywood plas-
tic is nearly fire proof and moisture
proof. The strength-weight ratio has
been brought up to that of steel and it
is hoped that in the near future this
ratio, E/W, will pass the value of steel.
When this is possible, the product will
beyond a doubt prove superior to met-
als. The main difficulty with all full
plastics has been their large creep under
load conditions. This creep has now
been reduced to such an extent that it
compares well with that of metals.
One disadvantage yet to be overcome
is its low impact resistance. This re-
sistance can be partially taken care of
by careful selection of the veneer base.
A factor tending to discount this dis-
advantage is the large shock-absorbing
property inherent in plastics. This ma-
terial has nearly five times the shock-
absorption ability of other structural
metals. This fact relieves designers of
any fatigue considerations, which have
been one of the main causes for metal
failures.
These plastics are still in the
very light category, having a
specific gravity of about 1.2 as
compared to 2.7 for aluminum.
In addition the product is en-
tirely dimensionally stable. It
will not crack, warp, or expand
due to atmospheric changes. It
is readily machinable, and the
same considerations are given it
as in the case of brass. The
dent and puncture resistance is
unusually high. A plastic of
this type may also be bent to
acute angles, such as are needed
for the leading edges of wings,
with no danger of cracking or
splitting. The product, how-
ever, should be pre-warmed to
about 140 degrees Fahrenheit
before bending to such acute angles.
The general characteristics are controlled
by the grade of resin, wood, and the
variables of cure. The chief limiting
factor in this, as in all non-metal prod-
ucts, is the bulk necessary to gain the
desired strength.
A new plastic in this field is Dura-
mold. This product has a specific grav-
ity of between .5 and .9. Successful
airplanes have been built and flown,
using this plastic as a basic element of
structure.
In comparing the three different basic
materials reference to Table II will
point out the characteristics of the
products. In the light of this table it
is readily seen that the structures of
full plywood plastic or Duramold have
nearly the characteristics of metals.
APPLICATIONS
In aircraft there are two principal
types of structures; namely, primary
and secondary structures. Primary struc-
tures are those which are essential to the
flying safety of the crew; secondary
structures are those which, while neces-
sary, are not essential to over-all safety
of the crew and plane.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Contrary to any and all rumors, Mr.
Burleson is not an unfathomable char-
acter, but the same as you and I. An
air of mystery seems to surround men
whose work gives them little occasion
to talk, and as a result of this very
thing, Mr. Burleson has become almost
a legendary figure on the campus. Sev-
eral wild guesses about the supposed
mystery have admirably succeeded in
making him appear even more inscrut-
able. So, far from attempting an ex-
pose, the Technic seeks to dispel the
clouds and let the light shine forth.
Mr. Burleson's official position is that
of curator in the Physics department.
In this capacity he has charge of and
sets up apparatus for lecture experi-
ments, and assists in running them. In
addition, he sees that the various lab-
oratories in the West Physics Building
have the necessary equipment in them
when your 45 or 46 lab turns up. En-
gineering labs and lectures are not his
only work, however, for he also has the
Lit Physics courses to look after.
Since Mr. Burleson checks attend-
ance at the Physics lectures, he has at-
tendance facts and figures on hand cov-
ering quite a few years. As an inter-
esting sidelight, he says that up until
two years ago engineers were very con-
sistent in lecture attendance, while the
Lits were seen less frequently. How-
ever, within the last two years, all at-
tendance has become more erratic, one
Saturday morning lecture averaging
75% of the registered number. This
lessening of interest is in line with con-
ditions in colleges throughout the coun-
try, most likely due to the unsettled
future that students face.
Mr. William E. Burleson is a native
of Michigan, having been born in Lan-
sing on July 22, 1880. His father had
a small manufacturing business there
in which he worked during summer va-
cations from school. While working on
a railroad in Colorado, he may have ac-
quired the travel urge, for he is an en-
thusiastic tourist. With Mrs. Burle-
son, he has motored through the entire
country, traveling from Quebec to Key
West, from Washington to California.
One trip was to Maine to view a total
eclipse of the sun, but this summer's
annual ramble will be eclipsed by the
rubber shortage.
Previous to his association with the
University, Mr. Burleson worked as a
machine operator for Hoover Ball Bear-
ing. His first work with Michigan was
with the Building and Grounds Depart-
ment as a janitor in 1923, when the
East Engineering Building was being
readied for use. Happening to be on
night duty in the West Engineering
Building when the hospital burned down,
he recalls turning on the high pressure
pumps in the M. E. 3 lab, and then
helping to fight the fire.
Reminiscing further, and with one
fire leading to another, he recalls the
time when one of Prof. Duffendack's
lectures was livened up by smoke sud-
denly pouring into the room. A quick
trip to the fan room disclosed a fire
there, and even faster work with a fire
extinguisher squelched it.
For a hobby, Mr. Burleson has built
a number of model sailboats. However,
rather than merely making them to
scale, he has made them sailing models.
Finding that his schooners sailed bet-
ter than other types, he concentrated
on them. No pygmies in size, one boat
he fitted to his car—large enough to
just fit into the back seat. The rest
of his hobby combines pleasure with
exercise, for after driving to a lake, he
unravels a quarter-mile of cord, ties it
to the boat, and then follows it in a
rowboat.
Although he says little, Mr. Burle-
son is no sphinx. He has seen much
in his travels and is not at all reticent
about talking of them. Perhaps a bit
shy, Mr. Burleson is nevertheless
friendly and an interesting person worth
knowing.
Having watched the game of life
longer than we, Mr. Burleson has ob-
served that most people when young
have ideas of reform, which usually
leave them as they grow older. "Let
good enough alone" is their policy in
later life, which is perhaps for the best.

carrier current
Communication between stations on
a high-tension line is necessary, but it
costs money to rent telephone lines. A
simple solution is the use of the power
lines themselves for communication pur-
poses. Modern, reliable equipment for
telephone communication by carrier
current over these high-voltage lines has
become as simple in operation as the
ordinary dial telephone and provides a
quality of transmission equal to that of
local telephone circuits. Stable opera-
tion is maintained even with tempera-
tures differing as much as 100 F. be-
tween the two ends of the power line.
The equipment used is actually a
radio transmitter on a small scale, with
the transmission lines replacing the
"ether." The same principle is used
to provide continuous music to restau-

rants, going by the name of "wired wire-
less." In the accompanying views, the
equipment used to provide communi-
cation over the 115 and 230-kv lines of
the Bonneville Power Administration is
entirely contained in the cabinet seen in
the smaller illustration.

precondition the eyes of pilots to ade-
quate night vision have been perfected
after eight months' experimenting by
the medical research section of the Bu-
reau of Aeronautics.
A standardized unit, it can be manu-
factured at one-sixth the cost of the
present type goggles which require a
quantity of leather, metal and cloth,
and must be fitted with individually
ground lenses. The weight of the new
goggle is two and one-half
ounces, including one and
one-half ounces of re-
claimed rubber.
Equipped with the dark
adapter lens, this goggle is
believed to be the answer
to the long existing need,
felt particularly by men
and pilots on aircraft car-
riers and lookout positions,
for a quick method of
adapting their vision to
darkness.
The principle upon which
the dark adapter goggle
works involves a special
lens which allows practi-
, f cally no light to stimulate
the portion of the retina
used in night vision. With-
out stimulation, that part
of the retina becomes dark
adapted almost as rapidly
as it would in complete
darkness.
tournapass
Two and one-half hours is the assem-
bly time of a new portable overpass,
invented by a Georgia newspaper edi-
tor with a bit of "Yankee" ingenuity.
Little wider than a traffic lane, this
overpass can easily be transported to
the scene of an expected traffic jam and
soon erected with the aid of a 15 ton
crane.
Construction details feature alloy
steel, box-beam side girders and floor
joists, and solid steel floor plate. Three
or more spans make up a complete unit,
and will support a 15 ton moving load.
Since each span is a rigid one-piece unit,
passing traffic causes no structure rum-
ble. Giant, alloy-steel bolts hinge the
spans together and permit adjustment
of the Tournapass to different street
elevations.
With the Tournapass installed at a

busy intersection, through travel in both
directions is possible. Traffic is speeded
up, jams eliminated, and time, tempers
and gasoline saved.
carbide economy
Helping to speed its production of
defense items such as aircraft motors
and parts, an automotive company has
eliminated virtually all delays incident
to obtaining special tungsten carbide
tools from tool manufacturers by pro-
ducing cutting tools in its own plant.
The production has been accomplished
at a saving in cost, also.
These carbide cutting tools, as a sub-
stitute, can cut several times as fast
as high-speed steel, and in addition,
save the expense of tungsten. They are
produced by brazing standardized sizes

of carbide tips to shanks of S.A.E. 1340
steel. Carbide tips themselves are read-
ily obtainable from manufacturers of
tungsten carbide, however, and pos-
sibility of delays in obtaining a com-
plete tool is thus avoided.
Shanks are ground to size on all four
sides from hot rolled stock on a water
type surface grinder. Following this
operation the potential tool goes to the
milling department where the recess for
the tip is milled out and the shank is
stamped ready for the brazing opera-
tion. The tip is polished on the bottom
and contact sides with a diamond wheel,
and then brazed into place.
plastic bearings
The problem of finding suitable ma-
rine bearings, particularly in stern
tubes, is as old as the use of the pro-
pellor for driving boats. A stern tube
bearing must last for years under con-
stant and severe stresses and strains.
It is difficult to lubricate, except with
water, and cannot be replaced or re-
paired except in drydock. The coming
of larger, faster ships has increased the
load it carries and further increased the
problem.
Lignum vitae has been the classic
material for stern tube bearings, and
has held its place in this field for gen-
erations It was satisfactory, but also
—no better material had been developed
upon a commercial scale Now a new
laminated plastic has been perfected
that is better in all ways than the lig-
num vitae bearings
A combination of phenol-formalde-
hyde resins and various fillers are used
in this new bearing. The filler is im-
pregnated with synthetic resin, then
processed under heat and pressure. The
resulting material is infusible and sol-
uble, and unaffected by water, brine,
oil, ordinary solvents, most acids, and
weak alkalis. Its structural strength is
extremely high, and it can be sawed,
drilled, punched, turned or cut by ma-
chine tools. It is chemically inert and
has a low water absorption factor.
This tough, resilient material has
many times the life of lignum vitae. Be-
cause of its low coefficient of friction
and high shock absorption qualities,
laminated plastic greatly reduces power
losses. It maintains better shaft align-
ment, and prolonged running serves
only to polish the shaft instead of scor-
ing it. As a stern tube bearing, the rate
Courtesy Compressed Air
of wear in a tug installation was y»
inch in 41 months of service.
With America's shipways humming
day and night, the demand for better
materials, quickly produced and quickly
installed, is steadily increasing. The
stern tube bearing application is but
one of many ways in which plastics in
one form or another are filling this need.
blind rivets
A new type of aluminum rivet has
been developed which can be applied
and headed up in locations where the
workman has access to only one side of
the work. Application and heading up
is accomplished with a pneumatic "gun"
which completes the operation at a rate
of 540 solid rivets per hour or 1200
hollow rivets per hour.
Each rivet is a two piece affair, with
the stem sliding in the rivet body proper.
The stem is so shaped that with a push-
pull motion, the rivet is applied and
then expanded by the stem being pulled
back. When the stem is pushed out, a
hollow rivet remains.

By
W. HUTCHERSON, '43E
This article is drawn from portions of a report of the committee on Coordination and
Teaching of the Engineering College, Prof. E. M. Baker—Chairman, and from inter-
views with Professors Richard Schneidewind of that committee and Prof. Baker.
T\URING May 1940 a series of ques-
*-* tionnaires relating to the quality
of teaching and to the general nature
of the course work was filled out by en-
gineering students. The questionnaires
were filled out not only in all engineer-
ing courses, but also in courses offered
primarily for engineering students in
other colleges. This survey represents
a more serious attempt to obtain in-
formation of this nature than the fresh-
man survey which was conducted two
years previously.
It would be hazardous and improper
to use student opinion as the only cri-
terion by which to measure the success
of a course and of a teacher. Student
opinion naturally does not fairly eval-
uate the quality of the subject matter
or its logical place in engineering train-
ing. Neither does it measure the teach-
er's professional standing or knowledge
of his particular specialty. It does,
however, throw valuable light upon his
classroom presence, his thoroughness of
preparation, the clarity of his explana-
tions, his aptitude in maintaining inter-
est, and his general ability to impart
knowledge. To sum up, the student
questionnaires tell part of the story, and
may be compared, for example, to the
customer's reaction towards an auto-
mobile.
Student opinion has been canvassed
in other schools, notably the School of
Business Administration, which from
time to time surveys student opinion in
order to obtain student reaction to sub-
ject matter, mode of presentation of the
course, and quality of teaching.
Discussion of Questionnaires
The engineering questionnaires of
May 1940 took the form of cards which
were issued in each section. There were
three types of cards. The first, which
was used in lectures, contained the fol-
lowing categories for judgment, namely:
(1) Degree of difficulty of lecture to
you.
(2) Interest and enjoyability.
(3) Quality of teaching—lecture.
The student was requested to grade
the course in three catagories with the
common symbols ranging from "A"
to "E".
The cards issued in recitation sec-
tions contained the following categories:
(1) Degree of difficulty of course to
you.
(2) Interest and enjoyability.
(3) Quality of teaching—this class.
(4) Suitability of text used.
(5) Correlation of lecture, laboratory,
and quiz.
(6) Total hours worked per week in
class and out per hour credit in course.
This time included the amount of time
spent in class or laboratory.
The laboratory card had the follow-
ing categories:
(1) Degree of difficulty of laboratory
to you.
(2) Interest and enjoyability.
(3) Quality of teaching—this class.
(4) Suitability of text used.
On the reverse side of each card,
space was provided for written com-
ment, either adverse criticism or con-
structive suggestions.
Method of Correlating the Results
The cards were separated, section by
section, and the letter grades given by
the student were translated into num-
ber grades with "A" being given four
points, "B" three points, etc., down to
"E" equalling zero points For exam-
ple, in evaluating the difficulty of a
course, the number grades of all stu-
dents reporting were added and divided
by the number of students. This would
give an average evaluation of the diffi-
culty. The same procedure was re-
peated for the other categories, and care
was taken in computing the averages
because not all students voted in all
categories of a course.
Where a course was taught in a plur-
ality of sections, the average course

grade was obtained by adding ail of
the votes cast and dividing by the num-
ber of students voting. The average
value was not obtained by computing
a grand average of the individual sec-
tion averages.
No satisfactory method was found
for correlating the comments on the re-
verse side of the cards. However, the
cards were turned over to the respec-
tive department heads for study by the
department head and the various in-
structors.
In many cases these comments have
led to desirable changes not only in
method of presentation but also in
course content.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


Some qualitative conclusions were
drawn from the results of this survey
without the necessity for any quantita-
tive compilations.
1) It is obvious that the quality of
instruction varies within wide limits.
In many of the larger courses which
are taught in a plurality of sections,
the students of one instructor find the
course to be interesting, instructive and
coherent, while those of another in-
structor report a mediocre course. This
circumstance may be found even in
those courses which permit the indi-
vidual instructors little latitude as to
the nature and quantity of subject mat-

ter and in which all the students take
common examinations.
2) The suitability and quality of the
text is hardly a matter that a student
can discuss any too intelligently. Never-
theless in some cases it may be possible
that student opinion may guide the in-
structor in the choice of a better text
or a more sympathetic use of the pres-
ent one.
Again, in those courses taught in a
plurality of sections, it would seem that
a text may simultaneously be excellent
and mediocre. This leads to a suspi-
cion that the student's opinion regard-
ing a book simply mirrors that of the
instructor.
As an example, in a certain course
the textbook was voted a 3.04 average
grade. Fifty students instructed by the
writer of the text voted it 3.48, and it
is obvious that this instructor used the
book effectively and efficiently. One
hundred and twenty-four students
under four other instructors gave it an
average rating of 3.15, which is a highly
satisfactory figure. Thirty-three men
taught by a sixth instructor thought
the book was worth a mere 2.64. Such
differences can be due only to the at-
titude of the teacher.
More specific conclusions can be
drawn from a study of the quantitative
data available from the cards. It was
hoped that some relationship might be
found, for example, between the diffi-
culty of the course, quality of teaching,
and the time spent. Examination of
a plot in which the ordinate is quality
of teaching and the abscissa is the
hours worked per week per credit hour,
including all the courses from the de-
partments contributing to an engineer's
education, shows no correlation between
quality of teaching and the time spent
by the student. In many cases, quality
of teaching has been rated a4", the
highest possible score, and the time
spent varied from 1.75 to 4.5 hours per
week per credit hour. It can also be
seen for a quality of teaching ranging
from slightly above 2 the spread in
hours worked is just about as great.
An attempt was also made to deter-
mine whether the difficulty of a course
was reflected in the quality of teaching,
and conversely, whether the quality of
teaching might be reflected in the diffi-
culty of the course. Examination of
this data also showed that there was
no correlation whatsoever.
It was found, however, that the in-
terest in a course and the quality of
teaching exhibited a marked relation-
ship to one another.
This relation was substantiated by
the result observed on the frequency
curve (Fig. I) where number of courses
is plotted against interest/quality and
the maximum point is at (interest/-
quality) = 1.
In other words, the interest in a
course mounts in direct relation with
the increased quality of teaching. It
is, of course, difficult to state whether
an interesting course results in a higher
rating for quality of teaching, or
whether good teaching alone can make
a course interesting.

Engineering Courses
The average quality-of-teaching rat-
ings range from a maximum of 3.98 to

''No, I am not related to Wendell!"
If one must have a pet gripe, Alexan-
der C. Wilkie has as his. the attempted
relation.
Being unable to claim fame as kin
to the famous man, Alex has gained
notoriety through his own accomplish-
ments. His extra-curricular activities
read like the Engineering Announce-
ment's list of activities open to engi-

Alexander G. Willkic
neers. Tau Beta Pi tops the list with
him as a member, Eta Kappa Nu
claims him as corresponding secretary,
the class of '42E chose him as their
representative to the Engine Council,
and he is Chairman of the Student
Honor Committee. Triangles, Vulcans,
Scabbard and Blade, Phi Kappa Phi,
Phi Eta Sigma, and A. I. E. E. and
S. A. M. E. also have him on their
books as a member. Alex found him-
self a sophomore track manager in his
second year on the campus, and is still
wondering how and why that happened.
Last year he was Illustrations Editor of
the Technic.
Although someone said there were
"lies, damn lies, and statistics," it is a
matter of record that A. C. was born
in Philadelphia on December 30, 1919.
Further statistics moved him to Port
Washington, Long Island, which is now
his home.
Both Alex and his brother, John, fol-
lowed in their father's footsteps when
they came to Michigan. Wilkie, Se-
nior, was a special student in N. A.
here in 1912. Alex came here con-
vinced by his father that anything ex-
cept Naval Architecture was good. He
chose electrical engineering, specializ-
ing in radio.
For recreation Alex plays tennis, and
a mean game at that; for relaxation, the
piano and a mandolin. He also plays
the radio—constantly, according to his
roommate! Since there are no shades
in his room at the Alpha Sigma Phi
house, and since there is a sorority
across the street, he says he never un-
dresses when he goes to bed. Easy go-
ing, with plenty of time for everything
(we've never seen him in a hurry), his
system of doing homework is to have
no system at all. It seems to have
worked, though. Alex has found his
greatest difficulty in college is trying to
appear interested when a prof lectures.
His method of concentrating, looking
out a window, doesn't please the profs.
Alex terms his love life "an equation
in two unknowns—both women." When
a formal dance turned up last year, he
did things in his usual thorough man-
ner and invited both "X" and "Y",
expecting neither to accept. When they
both answered in the affirmative, Alex
remained impartial in his judgment and
didn't go to the dance. At the same
formal the year before, "A. C." had
also been in hot water. His date's
father was a bit old-fashioned in some
respects, it seems. After Alex had
taken her home at 4 a. m. and settled
himself for ten or twelve hours sleep,
he was rudely awakened by an early-
phone call. Her father had put her
out of the house! Alex's dilemma was
solved when her father relented.
Alex's future plans, like those of
many, involve the army. He expects
to go into either the Engineering Corps,
or if he can transfer, into the Signal
Corps. Alex hopes he will eventually
get into the air raid warning branch,
or Radar, as it is commonly known.
ex-editor
Although the Directory lists Burr as
living in the Stalker Co-op House, the
Technic staff is convinced that since
becoming editor he has really lived in
the Technic offices. His lanky frame
and a Petty drawing have been the most
permanent decorations during the last
year.
Burr had his first taste of publication
in high school working on the school
paper, and has had "printer's ink" on
his hands ever since. The Technic wel-
comed him in his freshman year when he
joined the Features Department. Last
year found him as Features Editor, and
this year as Editor-in-Chief. The suc-
cess of the Technic has in no small
manner been due to the long hours and
hard work that he put in.

The Technic, however, hasn't been
Burr's only work on the campus. As a
freshman he joined Sigma Rho Tau, and

Scabbard and Blade initiates got a
real workout in the art of war during
their recent maneuvers. Armed to the
teeth with wooden rifles and a small
blank cartridge salute cannon, they set
out to capture military objectives in
the neighboring community of Delhi.
Just outside of Ann Arbor the col-
umn was held up by an enemy cow. A
few well-aimed shots of the salute can-
non routed the beast, however, and the
expedition plunged on into a dangerous
forest. Here disaster almost befell
them. A troop of Boy Scouts lured
them into ambush. They dropped from
trees and popped out from behind
boulders to pick off stragglers. With
great effort the unhappy military men
managed to escape, suffering only slight
casualties.
Arriving at their objective, they pre-
pared to storm the bridge across the
Huron. At this moment they were no-
ticed by one of the townsmen, who evi-
dently mistook them for parachutists
and hastened to call out the local vigi-
lantes. But by the time the town's
shotgun brigade had been mobilized the
invaders had departed to carry out an
assault on a large keg of beer.
While we are sorry that our country-
men were needlessly disturbed, we are
yet gratified to observe their alertness.
incidental intelligence
The department of Engineering Re-
search recently received a phone call
from a government agency requesting
statistics on production of all the brass
mines in the United States. ... A cos-
metic manufacturer now offers all six
delicious flavors in lipstick, which give
kisses a strawberry, raspberry, cherry,
orange, lemon or lime flavor. ... A no-
longer German sausage maker is now
producing endless chains of wieners in
which one normal sausage is preceded
by three short ones.
this humorous war
The electrical engineering bulletin
board frequently contains gems of wis-
dom which are missed by many engi-
neers because of its secluded location.
We'd like to pass on to you the latest
item—a list of inventions received at
the British Ministry of Supply which
for one reason or another were deemed
impracticable.

One bright soul suggested putting a
North and South Pole in East and West
England to throw off the compasses of
enemy fliers. Another creation was the
mechanically operated bayonet to be
attached to the right foot. While we
can't visualize this, we can see how dis-
concerting it would be to the foe. Then
there was the anti-airchaft shell fired
with ink, tar, or other opaque substance,
which would blacken the plane windows
and make the pilot fly blind.
One letter mentioned a "radio-acid
bomb." It continued cryptically: "If
you wish to communicate with us, leave
a note under the pile of stones on cor-
ner of Burmead Road (Grove Road
end), Hitchin."
The Supply ministry investigates all
these inventions because it is anxious
to prevent a repetition of the time when,
in cleaning out an old file, they came
across a plan of a tank, dated 1911.
Across the face of it was the official
comment: 'The man is mad."
science marches on
They laughed at Fulton and said the
steamboat was impossible.
They laughed at Edison and said the
electric light was impossible.
They laughed at Ashburne and said
the self-revolving crammick was im-
possible.
(You say you've never heard of a
self-revolving crammick? Naturally
not. It was impossible.)
Latest subject of public merriment is
our Uncle Dudley, who has just devel-
oped a hen which lays cubical eggs.
Says Uncle D., "Cubical eggs will save
up to 50% in storage space. They
will not roll off tables. They are just
what this country has been waiting
for."
Unfortunately, research has been cut
off just short of perfection. Dudley is
unable to get cocaine for the poor hen
and is too kind hearted to go on ex-
perimenting without the merciful bene-
fits of anaesthetics.

Ch. E. 10, the five week course in
fuel testing, is not so bad in itself—in
fact there is much useful material to be
learned. This should prove interesting
to all the boys who wrestled unsuccess-
fully with Morpheus from 7:30 to 12
each Saturday.
Mr. Townsend was a regular fellow
about us class sleepers. He might have
made many dirty digs about how our
sins overtake us in the end when final
exam time came around. But he was
a good sport. Without comment he
passed around a cartoon showing a
classroom in which everyone was asleep
but one unhappy student, who said,
"This is what I get for drinking coffee
for breakfast."

One of the charitable organizations
detailed a high-pressure salesman to go
before a convention of undertakers to
try and get them to come across. Just
before the meeting got under way the
chairman buttonholed the agent and
said, "Now don't expect too much of the
boys. Business has been pretty slow
lately."
Our friend was somewhat surprised
and said politely that he was very sorry
to hear it, adding that he had always
thought that the undertaking business
was quite steady and not prone to ups
and downs.
"Oh no," replied the chairman.
"There are thousands of people who
should be dead who are walking around
today. Sulfanilamide, you know."

Bad medicine for big bombers
One way to spoil a bomber's aim is to
hang a curtain of steel over your ship
and dare him to come down through it.
To get that curtain of steel up there
requires quick-firing, flexible guns.
To the plant of the Westinghouse
Electric Elevator Company the Navy, a
few months ago, brought its plans for
such a gun. And to Westinghouse was
given the important job of building the
mounts that would control the aiming of
these batteries of quick-firing guns.
And the Navy said, "Well done!"
Today, over the Westinghouse plant,
there floats the Navy's "E" pennant—
for excellence—eloquent testimony to
the manner in which this Westinghouse
plant performed the job. How was this
plant able to get into growing produc-
tion of these mounts so quickly? The
answer lies in a Westinghouse character-
istic called "know how"—the ability to
get things done in the best possible way.
This Westinghouse "know how" makes
itself felt wherever Westinghouse crafts-
men build things. Whether for the com-
mon defense or the general welfare, this
"know how" is doing a job. The same
skill and ingenuity that made so many
splendid things for peacetime living are
now being applied to many important
war weapons.

successfully demonstrating to his friends
that this turbine could be operated on
a temperature difference of only 20 de-
grees C, he obtained their wholehearted
financial support for a much larger
plant.
After some study he decided on the
island of Cuba as the location for his
experimental plant. The exact loca-
tion was on the beach seven miles from
Matanzas where is was known that the
surface water was 77 degrees F. and
the water at 500 meters (1970 ft.) was
SO degrees F.
losses in the pipe and the difference in
weight of the column of cold water as
compared to the warmer water sur-
rounding it. Hence, the total work re-
quired to bring the water from a depth
of 500 meters was equivalent to the
work of raising it only three meters.
The low pressure turbine was then con-
nected as previously explained. From
it, Claude obtained an output of 22
k.w. on a 14 degree C. Thermal head.
The unit was using 200 liters of cold
water per second and the same amount
of warm water which produced a boiler
to aip PUMP

For the next two years Claude spent
all of his time and a great deal of money
laying the cold water pipe and making
the cold water pit and power house in-
stallations. Twice he completely lost the
giant 2 meter pipe that was a mile and a
quarter in length. The third tube was
successfully laid in the summer of 1930
with the aid of the cruiser "Cuba" and
part of the Cuban Army.
On the same day that the tube was
completed, the Rateau cold water pump
was put to work. The water tempera-
ture in the cold water pit dropped to 13
degrees C. indicating a temperature
rise of 2 degrees on the way up. For
an output of 1 cubic meter per sec-
ond the level in the cold water pit
dropped 3 meters below sea level.
This 3 meter head represented friction

pressure of 23 mm. and a condenser
pressure of 16 mm.
The results obtained from this ex-
perimental plant further convinced
Claude that his idea would be a com-
mercial success sometime in the future.
He estimated that the installation costs
for plants of several hundred thousand
k.w. would be about $60.00 per k.w.
Soon after his experimental plant was
set up, he commenced plans for a larger
one to operate as a power station for
the Cuban government. As far as I
know, the data and results obtained
from this plant have not been published.
Another idea involving thermal head
has been suggested. At either of the
poles of the earth the atmospheric tem-
perature is about —40° F. Under
the ice in the same locality, however.
the temperature of the water is about
27-28 degrees above zero F. This will
give a 67-68 degree temperature range
which is seen to be about three times
what M. Claude had. Also, the water
to be brought to the surface would not
have to go through such a long pipe
and the efficiency would go up accord-
ingly. As a thermodynamic medium,
butane could be used instead of low
pressure steam which would freeze at
such temperatures. The scheme ap-
pears to have possibilities until we real-
ize that there is no demand for power
at either of the poles. If there existed
a method for transmitting power at a
reasonable efficiency from one of the
poles to civilization, this idea might
easily become a commercial enterprise.
Until that time, it is only an interest-
ing plan.
FUELS
Nearly all of the heat engines that
find industrial application today oper-
ate on heat from the combustion of
coal, petroleum, natural gas. wood, al-
cohol or vegetable oils. Coal is the
fuel for a little more than half of these,
petroleum products are used for about
a third, and the remaining sixth of the
engines operate on the other fuels be-
cause of local conditions.
Many estimates have been made over
the last 50 years as to the available sup-
ply of coal and oil. Almost invariably
these have been of a pessimistic nature.
According to many reputable men, our oil
supply should have been exhausted ten
years ago. New fields are being dis-
covered all the time, but unfortunately
our rate of consumption is a little
greater than our rate of discovery.
Sometime, perhaps within one or two
hundred years, our available oil will be
almost used up. Of course, there is
always the possibility of someone devis-
ing a process by which we can bring
to the surface the great quantities of
oil that now remain there because of
their adhesion to the sand particles.
Our coal, both high and low grade,
should last about 4000 years at the
present rate of consumption. However,
if our rate of consumption increases as
it has in the past, the supply will last
only about 500 years. Probably the
actual number of years lies somewhere
between these two estimates as we will

FASTER than ever before man shapes
steel to meet his needs, slicing it to
the desired shape with the oxyacetylene
flame — the modern cutting tool which
never dulls. It shapes thin gauge sheet
or heavy slabs; forgings and structures
with equal ease, and with truly aston-
ishing accuracy.
New, better and faster ways of
making machines, engines, ships, tanks
and innumerable other products is the
direct result of the efficiency and
proper application of this modern
production tool.
But the oxyacetylene flame does not
content itself merely with being the out-
standing metal cutting tool. Because of

its versatility, it finds wide and varied
application in speeding defense. It
hardens steels to any desired degree
and depth; cleans metal surfaces for
quicker and longer lasting paint jobs;
gouges outmetalwith astonishing speed
and accuracy, and welds metal together
into a homogenous unit. To aid and
expand production schedules by the

be finding substitutes as our power con-
sumption increases.
The increased use of alcohol as a
fuel has been suggested. This alcohol
could be produced in large quantities
from plants, grown for the purpose, and
retailed at about 30 cents a gallon. In
case of a severe gasoline shortage in
the near future, we may be forced to
do this as internal combustion engines
may be made to operate satisfactorily
on it.
Wood as a fuel will never be used
directly to any extent because of its
bulkiness and relatively low heating
value. It will probably be used for a
long time, however, in localities where
it is abundant and for certain
small consumers. Wood is too
valuable as a material for con-
struction to be used in a large
measure for fuel when there
are better substitutes.
Vegetable oils may be used
in Diesel engines in certain lo-
calities but they, also, will
find only limited use.
Natural gas is utilized in
gas engines designed for the
purpose but because of the ex-
pense it is used only where it
is abundant.
A proposed method for uti-
lizing the energy in any of
these fuels involves a more
direct transformation from
heat energy to electrical en-
ergy than is obtained with a
combustion engine and generator. An
example of an inefficient way in which
this may be accomplished is the thermo-
couple. Fritz Haber has done some work
on such "fuel batteries." His reports of
relatively high efficiencies on small units
indicates that we may have something
here. When more work has been done
along this line, we will be able to tell
better what the possibilities are.
TIDES
Most important in the non-solar
sources of power are the lunar tides.
Ideas for harnessing these tides date
back to the 15th century, but only in
recent years have we had necessary
tools and machinery to successfully
carry out some of these ideas. All pro-
posed schemes involve the use of one
or more reservoirs in which we cap-
ture the sea at high tide and then lower
it through suitable turbines, water
wheels, or the like. Theoretically, the
amount of work that could be extracted
from one oscillation of the tide is:
Work = wAH:! w—62.4 #/ft.»
2 A—Area in ft.- of tidal
reservoir
H—Difference in level be-
tween high and low tide
Actually, only about 20% of this
available energy will be recovered be-
cause of necessary operating conditions
and inefficiencies of the machinery. To
get the maximum power output from a
tide water plant, it would be necessary
to discharge all of the water in the
reservoir in the very short time of low
tide. This would mean that turbines
of large capacity and involving a large

Uniflow Steam Engine
capital outlay would be run at full blast
for only a few hours each day. A less
efficient but more practical plan is to
employ smaller turbines that run almost
continuously during both rising and
falling tides and which necessarily op-
erate on a lower head. By using such
a system, we could expect to get in the
neighborhood of 10,000 HP for every
sq. mile of reservoir area if a head of
30 ft. was available. This idea has
commercial possibilities and will un-
doubtedly be developed more in the fu-
ture in suitable localities.
An interesting tide water set-up has
been devised by the Rockland Power
Co. of Rockland, Maine. They employ
a high and a low water basin of 1 sq.
mile each. There is a tidal head of 10
ft. available for use. A huge tube 15 ft.
in diameter and 203 ft. long descends
vertically into the ground from the high
water basin. It is connected by a 30 ft.
horizontal tube to another larger ver-
tical tube, 35 ft. in diameter which
ascends to the bottom of the low water
basin. Around the opening of the first
tube there are 1500 one-half inch air
inlet tubes. As the water flows rapidly
downward through this first tube, it
drags with it great quantities of en-
trapped air which is then caught in an
air chamber in the horizontal tube 195
ft. below the surface of the low level
basin. This compressed air, which in-
cidentally is 3 times as dry as ordinary
air, is then tapped off through a 14 in.
main to a storage tank from which it
drives a compressed air motor. An
over-all efficiency of 75% is
claimed by the company. Five
thousand HP can be produced
steadily by this unit.
EARTH'S HEAT
The rise in temperature of
the earth varies in different lo-
calities from 1 degree per 26
ft. descent to 1 degree per 175
ft. The difficulties of boring a
deep shaft into the earth from
which we could take heat, and
thereby energy, are many.
First of all there is the prob-
lem of getting suitable drill-
ing materials and shaft lining
to withstand the high temper-
atures. More important than
this, probably, are the difficul-
ties of heat transfer through
rock. If the shaft could be successfully
put down, the heated rock in the imme-
diate vicinity would soon be cooled and
would act as an insulator to prevent
rapid heat extraction. The use of water
under high pressure as a circulating
medium has been suggested. Probably,
however, this scheme will not be devel-
oped while there are still so many su-
perior ones in view.
As an example of a more practical
utilization of the earth's heat, there is
a plant in Larderello, Italy, which op-
erates on volcanic steam. This plant
was first constructed in 1836 for the
purpose of extracting the .l-.3% of
boric acid that the natural steam con-
tains. In 1912, the first power plant was
set up to use the heat from this system.
Pure water, which was heated by the vol-
canic steam, was used in the turbines

Primary Structures
Primary structures consist of the
main supporting and control surfaces
and the intermediate framework; i.e.,
the wings, tail surfaces and fuselage.
The ailerons, rudders and elevators are
not considered as primary structures.
The wings have heretofore presented
a number of difficulties in all types of
structure. Now, however, with excel-
lent plastics available, the problem is
readily and simply solvable. Plastic
lends itself admirably to this structure
for several reasons. Excellent aero-
dynamic properties are possible with
its use. An exceedingly smooth con-
tour may be made which has no pro-
truding rivets, as in the case of stressed
skin construction, and has no sag as in
fabric covering. In addition the entire
covering may be made in either one or
two pieces. With proper selection of
the grain direction, the skin can be
made to take a considerable proportion
of the shear and torsion loads. The
structure, however, is somewhat lack-
ing in bending strength due to the high
chord thickness ratio, and therefore
must be supplied with longitudinal
spars.
Two typical structures are shown in
Figures 1 and 2. The first one is for
a pure plastic structure and is exceed-
ingly simple. The second is for use
with semi-plastic structure and requires
considerable hand fitting. With the
true plastic structure, flutter, which is
universally considered disastrous, is al-
most entirely damped out.
These materials are particularly suit-
ed to modern monocoque fuselage
structures as will be seen in the follow-
ing example. A steel cylindrical shell
was constructed with a diameter of 60
inches and carried a load at failure of
63,000 pounds. A similar shell of the
same weight of aluminum alloy sup-
ported 30,000 pounds. A third one of
pure resin withstood 8,000 pounds,
while a fourth of resin plastic supported
113,000 pounds. This points out the
advantage of using these phenol for-
maldehydes for all shell structures.
These materials are not too well
suited for tail surfaces. The reason for
this is the high torsion loads which they
are required to carry, and the conse-
quent need for a large volume of ma-
terial. Nevertheless, several trial sec-
tions have been built with a fair degree
of success. It is hoped that these struc-
tures will soon be advisable when made
of plastics.
Secondary Structures
As to the secondary structures, which,
it will be recalled, are those which are
not vital to the flying safety of the crew.
Secondary structures carry low stresses
and hence any plastic applicable to pri-
mary will also be suitable for second-
ary use. At the present time plastics
are being used satisfactorily for such
parts as cowlings, wheel cover, control
surfaces, cabin interiors and miscella-
neous fittings.
Perhaps one of the most important
features in favor of the use of syn-
thetic plastics is the simplified and eco-
nomical methods of production. With
such materials, parts are easily molded
and fabricated. Numerous parts and
even whole sections may be made inter-
changeable. This, as one can readily
see, would be of untold value now. If
a plane returns damaged, the parts and
even new surfaces could be replaced in
a matter of a few hours. In the pres-
ent planes, the matter of repair and
maintenance takes days to complete.

These materials lend themselves ade-
quately to standard assemblies. Their
workability means less production time
and that in turn results in lower cost.
The use of less complicated jigs, tools
and molds means a tremendous saving
in labor costs, which at the present time
amounts to roughly 80 per cent of the
total production costs. These savings
may be realized only with mass produc-
tion, because initial die costs are high.
Due to increased efficiencies of opera-
tion, however, there is a decrease of
nearly 25 per cent in the power re-
quired for operating.
In conclusion, it has been shown that
favorable physical properties, combined
with ease of fabrication, efficiency of
production and ease of maintenance
make plastics and semi-plastics well
suited for aircraft structures.
to avoid possible damage to the equip-
ment by the impurities of the natural
steam. In 1923, these evaporators were
junked when a method was discovered
for getting rid of 90'* of these im-
purities. Three turbo-alternaters of
2500 k.w. each were then installed and
successfully operated.
A similar installation was made at
The Geysers, Calif., about the same
time. These wells averaged about 450
ft. in depth with an operating guage
pressure of 64-300 psi. Soon after their
drilling, the wells were developing 4500
k.w. The operators believed that they
could maintain an output of 10,000 k.w.
for many years without seriously deplet-
ing the steam supply. As at Larderello,
this steam apparently was formed by a
steady supply of water flowing onto a
great mass of hot magma which has a
tremendous heat content.
ATOMIC POWER
The extraction of power from atoms
depends upon the theory that energy and
mass are interconvertible. If two or
more particles combine so that a loss of
mass results, as in the disintegration of
a radio active material, a corresponding
gain in energy follows.
Uranium 237 offers the best possibili-
ties for commercial development. This
isotope emits neutrons which act as a
catalyst for further disintegration. Thus,
a chain of reactions is set up which pro-
duces 1,000,000 times as much energy,

eluded him, and he became co-director
of elections on the Engineering Council
during his junior year. This year Burr
helped handle the finances of the Senior
Class, and further added to his credit
the job of Chairman of the Slide Rule
Ball. He also acted as counselor at the
Freshman Rendezvous last fall.
Ever since his first glimpse of light in
Mishawaka, Indiana, twenty-one years
ago last January 30, Burr J. French has
been on the move. Beginning his per-
petual motion with a move to South
Bend, he kept going to Chicago, reversed
to New Jersey, and has stayed there
since '29—but not in one spot.
Last summer Burr worked for Allison
in Indianapolis as a student engineer in
the Experimental Engineering Depart-
ment testing motors and parts. On the
campus he has corrected papers for Pro-
fessor Dodge.
Since his home has been in New Jer-
sey, Burr has hitched home several
times. One trip included a dismal six
hour wait on a cold night in April, when
spring vacations were still in existence.
Something new had been added, but it
didn't improve that trip.
After graduation as a Mechanical
Engineer, Burr plans to work with a
Detroit automobile plant for the allied
war effort. He also confidentially tells
his friends that he hopes to have more
time to pursue his hobbies of tennis,
swing music, and his latest love, bowling.
When the big three of The Michigan
Technic, French, Burnham, and Im-
boden went on the annual trip to the
E. C. M. A. convention, French retained
his position as the unofficial date bureau
of the staff. Despite the fact that Burn-
ham was ridiculed for his activity,
Burr's action cannot be left unnoticed.
bare-foot boy
Bill's greatest decision came in his
boyhood days when he first moved to
Schenectady. Brought up on a Ver-
mont farm, the "Barefoot Boy" almost
didn't complete his education when told
he would have to wear shoes to school
in the city.
Major William E. Renner was born
April 28, 1904, in Schenectady, N. Y.
He spent his boyhood days on a farm
in Vermont, later living in Schenectady
and Ithaca. Bill and his sister were
about the only students to graduate
from the little red school house in Ver-
mont and proceed with further educa-
tion.
In 1927 William Renner graduated
from the University of Michigan with
degrees in Mechanical Engineering,

neering, at the same time also receiv-
ing his commission as second lieuten-
ant in the U. S. Army Reserve. Being
very active in college and an outstand-
ing student, Bill was a member of
Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity, Tau Beta
Pi, Sigma Xi, Phi Kappa Phi, Triangles,
Quarterdeck, Scabbard and Blade, and
A.S.M.E.
While driving back home with a
friend during a spring vacation, Major
Renner narrowly escaped being jailed.
One morning around 3 a. m. his car
ran low on oil, but they were unable
to arouse the owner of the next garage
at which they stopped. Determined to
continue on their way, they decided to
operate the oil pump themselves. Just
as they started pumping the attendant
came and caught them red-handed. He
demanded payment of $1.00 for the oil
they had taken or might have taken.
Although they were hot and ready for
an argument, a siren was heard scream-
ing near by, so they hurriedly paid him
and were on their way.
After graduation, Major Renner
worked for the General Electric Co. at
Schenectady in the Domestic Refriger-
ator Department, and was soon placed
in charge of the Cost Engineering De-
partment. In 1939 Mr. Renner became
Professor Renner, head of the Admin-
istrative Engineering Dept. at Syracuse
University. Teaching is his chosen
work, teaching and working with col-
lege engineers his life's ambition.
Professor Renner took active duty
with the army reserves in June 1940.
assuming the title of Captain William
Renner. In September of the same year
he was transferred from Watervliet Ar-
senal to the University R.O.T.C. unit
as ordnance instructor and adjutant.
He was promoted to the rank of major
in July of 1941.
Just inside the R.O.T.C. headquar-
ters, first office to the right, first desk
on your right, you'll meet this popular,
well liked army officer. A "dad" to
students in the unit, he always has time
to help other people.
A full fledged "Daniel Boone." camp-
ing and an out-of-doors life is the ar-
dent habit of Major Renner, his wife
and four children. A thoroughbred
Michigan alumnus, he has followed the
Wolverines in all sports since his fresh-
man days at Ann Arbor. At Schenec-
tady he was the first president of the
Michigan Alumnus' Club.
"The greatest change in Michigan in
the last ten years has been school
spirit," declares Major Renner. Back,
not very long ago, in Bill's college days
at Ann Arbor, there was more class dis-
tinction. Junior and senior engineers
had class jackets to distinguish them-
selves. Major Renner believes there
should be more unified class activities,
class sings, picnics, etc.
He heartily believes that the most
important things one secures from col-
lege are not the precise facts and figures
learned from textbooks, but the char-
acter and leadership you develop
through your associations and acquaint-
ances. You can be a successful scien-
tist and work by yourself, but to be a
successful engineer you mst be able to
work with others.

TAKE a good look at this picture.
For without a ladder you sel-
dom get a close-up of a sprinkler
head.
This one is said to be the last word—
so reliable that industries which
equip their buildings with this little
"fireman" obtain low insurance
rates. Users say it pays for itself.
When the heat of a fire reaches a cer-
tain temperature, the little "Quart-
zoid" bulb you see in the sprinkler
head is shattered by expanding
liquid inside it. A valve is thus
released, and water is directed onto
the fire.
For the engineer, there's more to
that little bulb than meets the eye.
For one thing, it replaces alloys
formerly used. For another, it shows
how glass can now be made into
accurate mechanical parts. The
bulb must shatter at a specific tem-
perature. And it must shatter com-
pletely, with no splinters to hinder
valve action. Too, it must fit its
hardware exactly. So it's up to
Corning to supply glass free from
weakening flaws and to hold wall
thickness and O.D. to the small
tolerances that can make or break
the efficiencv of a sprinkler head.
Fussy? Sure. But fussy and tough
jobs are stock in trade at Corning.
Did vou know for instance that
Corning makes a light globe that
also protects industry because,
unlike the "Quartzoid" bulb,
it will not shatter? That Corn-
ing has developed industrial
glasses to withstand heat that turns
metals to liquid? Or that glass springs
from Corning will outlast metals in
fatigue tests?
These few examples give you an
inkling of the growing usefulness
of glass in these days of material
shortages. No wonder engineers with
urgent problems say "Ask Corning."

Quality of Teaching in the Professional
Departments as Influenced by Staff
Loading
A list of the instructors arranged in
descending order of the quality-of-
teaching ratings is found in the appen-
dix under the individual departments.
The number of students reporting on
the individual instructor and the num-
ber of sections taught by him were tab-
uated. The instructors were divided
into three groups according to the num-
ber of students which they met. The
three classifications and the number of
men teaching in the various categories
are as follows:
1 Teachers meeting less than 35 stu-
dents during the semester, 61.
2. Teachers meeting between 35 and
70 students, 87.
3. Teachers meeting more than 70
students, 55.
a minimum of 1.40, with the median
at 3.19. These ratings were plotted in
Fig. 2, where the quality of teaching is
the ordinate. Since there were 118 men
involved, rather than plotting men as
the abscissa it was felt desirable to
plot the abscissa in per cent. In other
words 118 men equals 100 per cent and
59 equals 50 per cent.
The data are interesting in showing
that the percentage of instructors hav-
ing a quality rating below 2.8 is but
13 per cent of the total faculty whereas
48 per cent had a rating of 3.2 or bet-
ter. It is interesting that the students
on the average have rated their profes-
sors about one point higher than the
faculty rates the students. In other
words, 3.19 is the median for the pro-
fessors, whereas 2.2 to 2.4 would be
the average student's point-average.
A similar graph was made for the
service departments, Chemistry, Eco-
nomics, Physics, Mathematics and Eng-
lish. This group consisted of 86 men
and the individual ratings ranged from
a maximum of 3.92 to a minimum of
1.14. The median proved to be 3.10.
These ratings have been plotted on two
curves and are substantially identical
in shape and position and show similar
data for the service departments. It
may be concluded that the general qual-
ity of teaching is the same in the pro-
fessional and service departments.

Victory for the United Nations in the war
will, to a great extent, be a victory for American
engineering and incidentally, for Timken Tapered
Roller Bearings.
Many lessons will be learned from experience gained
in designing war equipment and the machines that
make it—lessons that you will profit by in future years
when your student days are over and you are called
upon to take an active part in the tremendous work
of world reconstruction.
Among other things you will find—as thousands of ex-
perienced engineers already have proved—a thorough
knowledge of Timken Bearings and their application as
useful as your slip stick. It will enable you to meet
every bearing requirement completely and soundly.
We will be glad to help you with your bearing pro-
blems at any time.

Fig. 2 was plotted with quality of
teaching as the ordinate and the per
cent of instructors in each category as
the abscissa. Three curves were drawn:
one for each category of teachers. It
is obvious from this figure that an in-
structor who has less than 35 students
in a given semester has a tremendous
advantage over his less fortunate asso-
ciates. Whereas the median for all of
the instructors in the professional de-
partments is 3.19, the median for the
instructors with less than 35 students
is 3.55. The lowest rating for an in-
structor in this group is 2.58. The
group teaching between 35 and 70
students averaged slightly better than
those professors having more than 70
students, although the difference is not
great except for the teachers with very
low teaching ratings. We may for all
practical purposes place teachers of 35
to 70 students and of more than 70
students in the same category. The in-
structors teaching less than 35 students
have a 15 per cent better chance than
their colleagues of obtaining a high
rating.
Figs. 3 and 4 show degree of diffi-
culty and student time required in
courses classed according to depart-
ment. The results here are quite in-
teresting in that they show a relation
between amount of time spent in each
department and the difficulty of the
courses within the department. Chem-
ical Engineering courses, consume
much extra time for moderately diffi-
cult courses, while in Economics very
little time is spent for the same degree
of difficulty. Is it not easy to justify
the numerous low marks for engineers
in economics?
It is interesting to note how the graph
shows immediately the method of run-
ning various courses. For example,
drawing is labeled as normally difficult,
but the required work and the place
where it is accomplished, in the drawing
room, can be deduced from the bar
graph data. Surveying shows very simi-
lar characteristics—a comparatively easy
course, most of the work necessarily
being done in the field laboratory period.
Fig. 3 also distinctly shows the range
of acumen or of study habits of men
taking various courses. Out of fifteen
different classifications, only four do not

Future Surveys
The survey also yielded detailed in-
formation on student opinion of indi-
vidual instructors. This information is
necessarily confidential, and was not
discussed with the author. Both the
general and detailed information are
considered to be of sufficient value to
justify repetition of the survey from
time to time, probably at no less than
three year intervals. From a general
analysis of the above collected mate-
rial, it is not too difficult to see points
where both the faculty and the students
could be improved. Definite action
can and has been taken with the fac-
ulty by means of suggestions and dis-
cussions, while on the other hand, the
students are their own masters. They
must become aware of their shortcom-
ings in this educational institution and
pick themselves up by their own boot-
straps. The mere fact that a survey
of this type has been conducted to air
our deficiencies is evidence of our de-
sire for improvement.
It has been suggested that the surveys
recur not oftener than every three years
so that definite trends may be noted in
student opinions and attitudes without
collecting an excessive amount of data.
Since that data that is now being pub-
lished was collected two years ago, it is
evident that a timely interim must be
allowed for the organization and inter-
pretation of that data. Perhaps if the
project can be repeated at regular inter-
vals, a standard set of graphs can be set
up similar to those shown in this article,
and the interpretation of the curves can
be done by comparison rather than by
direct statement as they now are. That
is, the previous graphs will perform a
definite function too by aiding in this
interpretation.

BACKBONE FOR STEEL!
m
J Chromium, the element that imparts pre-
I" cious color to rubies, imparts something
more precious to steel. It gives steel in-
v&gt; credible hardness and resistance to heat
and corrosion. It makes steel strong, yet ductile
and shock-resistant.
Chromium is the key that has opened — and is
still opening — great new fields of application for
steel. Without chromium, the whole wonderful
series of stainless steels would not have been pos-
sible. From tarnish-free tableware to corrosion-
resistant chemical equipment.. . from strong, light-
weight truck bodies to streamlined trains and
airplanes . .. from heat-defiant boiler tubes to high-
temperature steam turbines ... chromium has made
possible a steel with properties of the noble metals.
But the stainless steels are only one great contribution of
chromium. This element has also helped to provide hard,
shock-resistant armor plate and armor-piercing projectiles;
long-wearing engine valves; strong, tough gears, tools, hall
bearings, car trucks, shafts, springs, and dies; and hundreds
of other improved articles.
We do not make steel of any kind. But for over 35 years,
wc have made ferro-alloys and alloying metals used in steel-
making. Among these are chromium, silicon, manganese, va-
nadium, tungsten, zirconium, columbium, and calcium.
It was our research and development that made the low-
carbon grades of ferro-chromiuni available commercially.
Without these, production of a majority of the stainless steels
would have been impracticable. Inquiries about stainless and
other alloy steels — their manufacture, fabrication, and use
— are cordially invited.
The progress made by Electro Metallurgical Company in the
manufacture and use of jerro-alloys and in the development of
alloy steels has been greatly facilitated by metallurgical re-
search in the laboratories of Electro Metallurgical Company
and Union Carbide Company; by the advances in electric fur-
nace electrodes and techniques of National Carbon Company,
Inc.; and by the broad experience in the production, fabrica-
tion, and treatment of metals of Haynes Stellite Company and
The Linde Air Products Company. All of these companies arc
Units of Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation.

OUR HONOR SYSTEM
In place of trying to tell you prospec-
tive freshman on one inadequate page
of printed copy, exactly what college is
or what it could mean to you, The
Michigan Technic is going to take this
opportunity to inform you as thoroughly
as possible about one particular advan-
tage which our engineering college offers
to you. Perhaps, by this means, you
may become early acquainted with a
system whose influence will be near you
all four years in the college.
In 1915, the honor system was intro-
duced to the College of Engineering.
Since that time it has constantly grown
in importance and prestige. This has
been due in part to the support of the
faculty and the wholesome attitude of
the student body. We must continue,
however, to maintain the consciousness
of the students with reference to the sys-
tem, in order that it may continue to
operate effectively.
The principles upon which the hono"
system is based are these:—Since engi-
neering is primarily an individual enter-
prise as far as design and theory are
concerned, cheating now only leads to
failure later. Also, since college men are
individuals, they can be led more easily
to uphold their honor by their own
means rather than being herded like ani-
mals to honesty by a worn-out proctor
system. Without a doubt it gives a man
a warm feeling toward his instructor,
when he realizes that he is mature
enough to be trusted with his own honor.
An honor committee composed of
democratically elected men has been the
judiciary body known as the Honor
Council to which all cases are initially
referred for recommendations. The
Honor Council does have the right to
either dismiss cases or suggest what ac-
tion should be taken. If the case de-
mands further attention it is referred to
the faculty disciplinary committee where
official action can be taken. By means
of these counseling and enforcing de-
leave the room of the examination—
order being maintained by he students
themselves. After finishing his work,
each student is required to write and
sign the following pledge: "I have
neither given nor received aid on this
examination." (Signed). The concrete
basis of the honor system then rests on
the veracity of this signed oath.
We now present this outline of the

vices, the system has flourished and the
cases have been most fairly handled.
Actual evidence of the honor system is
shown whenever bluebooks are given in
the school. The instructor is required to
system to you freshmen for considera-
tion. When you enter the College of
Engineering at the University of Michi-
gan it will be your assurance of fair-
ness. Know it. Use it.

THE MICHIGAN TECHNIC


"Chemical Engineering is that branch of engineering concern d wit'i the dvclopmcnt and application of manufacturing
processes in which chemical or certain physical changes of materials a e involved"—as defined by the American Institute of
Chemical Engineers. The chemical cn-inccr is therefore essentially a process engineer. In the design of varied processes
it has been found that common principles may be successfully applied in processing different materials. These common princi-
ples have been resolved into coordinated scries of unit operations which may be studied in both class and laboratory. Only
by being thoroughly grounded in the fundamentals of chemistry, physics, mathematics, and the application of these funda-
mentals to manufacturing processes is it possible for the chemical engineer to make his proper contribution to the develop-
ment and commercial production of the amazing multiplicity o I new products from modern industry.
The cut above indicates a section in the unit operations laboratory where heat transfer and evaporation arc being studied.
The Department is fortunate in having available equipment for the study of all of the unit operations, and offers undergraduate
and graduate courses in all fundamentals of chemical engineering and in their application to a number of important industries.
The student is afforded an opportunity to apply his principles in process design and in the actual operation of process equip-
ment.
